        "text": "Horoscope and chart of Chas Chandler\n\nAstrological portrait of Chas Chandler (excerpt)\n\nDisclaimer: these short excerpts of astrological charts are computer processed. They are, by no means, of a personal nature. This principle is valid for the 68,582 celebrities included in our database. These texts provide the meanings of planets, or combination of planets, in signs and in houses, as well as the interpretations of planetary dominants in line with modern Western astrology rules. Moreover, since Astrotheme is not a polemic website, no negative aspect which may damage the good reputation of a celebrity is posted here, unlike in the comprehensive astrological portrait.\n\nIntroduction\n\nHere are some character traits from Chas Chandler's birth chart. This description is far from being comprehensive but it can shed light on his/her personality, which is still interesting for professional astrologers or astrology lovers.\n\nIn a matter of minutes, you can get at your email address your astrological portrait (approximately 32 pages), a much more comprehensive report than this portrait of Chas Chandler.\n\nN.B.: as this celebrity's birth time is unknown, the chart is arbitrarily calculated for 12:00 PM - the legal time for his/her place of birth; since astrological houses are not taken into account, this astrological profile excerpt is less detailed than those for which the birth time is known.\n\nThe dominant planets of Chas Chandler\n\nWhen interpreting a natal chart, the best method is to start gradually from general features to specific ones. Thus, there is usually a plan to be followed, from the overall analysis of the chart and its structure, to the description of its different character traits.\n\nIn the first part, an overall analysis of the chart enables us to figure out the personality's main features and to emphasize several points that are confirmed or not in the detailed analysis: in any case, those general traits are taken into account. Human personality is an infinitely intricate entity and describing it is a complex task. Claiming to rapidly summarize it is illusory, although it does not mean that it is an impossible challenge. It is essential to read a natal chart several times in order to absorb all its different meanings and to grasp all this complexity. But the exercise is worthwhile.\n\nIn brief, a natal chart is composed of ten planets: two luminaries, the Sun and the Moon, three fast-moving or individual planets, Mercury, Venus and Mars, two slow-moving planets, Jupiter and Saturn, and three very slow-moving planets, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. Additional secondary elements are: the Lunar Nodes, the Dark Moon or Lilith, Chiron and other minor objects. They are all posited on the Zodiac wheel consisting of twelve signs, from Aries to Pisces, and divided into twelve astrological houses.\n\nThe first step is to evaluate the importance of each planet. This is what we call identifying the dominant planets. This process obeys rules that depend on the astrologer's sensitivity and experience but it also has precise and steady bases: thus, we can take into account the parameters of a planet's activity (the number of active aspects a planet forms, the importance of each aspect according to its nature and its exactness), angularity parameters; (proximity to the four angles, Ascendant, Midheaven, Descendant and Imum Coeli or Nadir, all of them being evaluated numerically, according to the kind of angle and the planet-angle distance) and quality parameters (rulership, exaltation, exile and fall). Finally, other criteria such as the rulership of the Ascendant and the Midheaven etc. are important.\n\nThese different criteria allow a planet to be highlighted and lead to useful conclusions when interpreting the chart.\n\nThe overall chart analysis begins with the observation of three sorts of planetary distributions in the chart: Eastern or Western hemisphere, Northern or Southern hemisphere, and quadrants (North-eastern, North-western, South-eastern and South-western). These three distributions give a general tone in terms of introversion and extraversion, willpower, sociability, and behavioural predispositions.\n\nThen, there are three additional distributions: elements (called triplicity since there are three groups of signs for each one) - Fire, Air, Earth and Water - corresponding to a character typology, modality (or quadruplicity with four groups of signs for each one) - Cardinal, Fixed and Mutable - and polarity (Yin and Yang).\n\nThere are three types of dominants: dominant planets, dominant signs and dominant houses. The novice thinks astrology means only \"to be Aries\" or sometimes, for example, \"to be Aries Ascendant Virgo\". It is actually far more complex. Although the Sun and the Ascendant alone may reveal a large part of the character - approximately a third or a half of your psychological signature, a person is neither \"just the Sun\" (called the sign) nor just \"the first house\" (the Ascendant). Thus, a particular planet's influence may be significantly increased; a particular sign or house may contain a group of planets that will bring nuances and sometimes weaken the role of the Ascendant, of the Sun sign etc.\n\nLastly, there are two other criteria: accentuations (angular, succedent and cadent) which are a classification of astrological houses and types of decanates that are occupied (each sign is divided into three decanates of ten degrees each). They provide some additional informations.\n\nThese general character traits must not be taken literally; they are, somehow, preparing for the chart reading. They allow to understand the second part of the analysis, which is more detailed and precise. It focuses on every area of the personality and provides a synthesis of all the above-mentioned parameters according to sound hierarchical rules.\n\nWarning: when the birth time is unknown, which is the case for Chas Chandler, a few paragraphs become irrelevant; distributions in hemispheres and quadrants are meaningless, so are dominant houses and houses' accentuations. Therefore, some chapters are removed from this part.\n\nFor all paragraphs, the criteria for valuation are calculated without taking into account angles and rulerships of the Ascendant and of the Midheaven. The methodology retains its validity, but it is less precise without a time of birth.\n\nElements and Modes for Chas Chandler\n\nChas Chandler, Fire is dominant in your natal chart and endows you with intuition, energy, courage, self-confidence, and enthusiasm! You are inclined to be passionate, you assert your willpower, you move forward, and come hell or high water, you achieve your dreams and your goals. The relative weakness of this element is the difficulty to step back or a kind of boldness that may prompt you to do foolish things.\n\nThe predominance of Water signs indicates high sensitivity and elevation through feelings, Chas Chandler. Your heart and your emotions are your driving forces, and you can't do anything on Earth if you don't feel a strong affective charge (as a matter of fact, the word \"feeling\" is essential in your psychology). You need to love in order to understand, and to feel in order to take action, which causes a certain vulnerability which you should fight against.\n\nThe twelve zodiacal signs are split up into three groups or modes, called quadruplicities, a learned word meaning only that these three groups include four signs. The Cardinal, Fixed and Mutable modes are more or less represented in your natal chart, depending on planets' positions and importance, and on angles in the twelve signs.\n\nThe Fixed mode corresponds to a majority of elements in your chart, Chas Chandler, and represents the desire for security and durability: you are able to concretely appreciate a situation and its stability. You definitely prefer to play the role of a loyal, obstinate and hard-working person, rather than to try new and risky experiences - beware, however, not to confuse obstinacy with intransigence. You structure, cement, and strengthen everything you find on your way: it is your nature, although you are not especially interested in swiftness: slow and steady...\n\nDominants: Planets, Signs and Houses for Chas Chandler\n\nThe issue of dominant planets has existed since the mists of time in astrology: how nice it would be if a person could be described with a few words and one or several planets that would represent their character, without having to analyse such elements as rulerships, angularities, houses, etc!\n\nThe ten planets - the Sun throughout Pluto - are a bit like ten characters in a role-play, each one has its own personality, its own way of acting, its own strengths and weaknesses. They actually represent a classification into ten distinct personalities, and astrologers have always tried to associate one or several dominant planets to a natal chart as well as dominant signs and houses.\n\nIndeed, it is quite the same situation with signs and houses. If planets symbolize characters, signs represent hues - the mental, emotional and physical structures of an individual. The sign in which a planet is posited is like a character whose features are modified according to the place where he lives. In a chart, there are usually one, two or three highlighted signs that allow to rapidly describe its owner.\n\nRegarding astrological houses, the principle is even simpler: the twelve houses correspond to twelve fields of life, and planets tenanting any given house increase that house's importance and highlight all relevant life departments: it may be marriage, work, friendship etc.\n\nIn your natal chart, Chas Chandler, the ten main planets are distributed as follows:\n\nThe three most important planets in your chart are Jupiter, Pluto and Mars.\n\nJupiter, the planet of expansion, organization, power and benevolence, is quite emphasized in your chart. Like any Jupiterian, you are warm, open, sociable, consensual, active and optimistic. You can use your self-confidence to erase differences of opinion, and you leave the task of analyzing and perfecting things to specialists. Your role, and you know it since you were young, is to gather, to demonstrate your synthesizing and conciliatory mind, and to naturally reap its fruits - power.\n\nYou appreciate legality, social order but also order in general. With you as a leader, every plan or human entity can be organized and structured. You excel at supervising. The Jupiterian type is indeed the politician par excellence, and a positive Jupiter in your chart is synonymous with good integration into society, whatever the chosen path.\n\nIs this idyllic picture really perfect? Certainly not: each planet's typology has its own weaknesses. One of yours is pride, like the Solarian, but your will of expansion at all costs may generate a form of exaggeration in everything, endless pleasure, inappropriate self-confidence that could lead you to rough materialism and the thirst for absurd material comfort - in the worst cases, of course.\n\nWith Pluto as a dominant planet in your chart, you are a magnetic and mighty predator, like the Scorpio sign ruled by this planet, who needs to exert pressure on others in order to \"test\" them. You are always ready to evolve, to risk destruction for reconstruction - including your own - to live more intensely whilst imposing your secret authority on things and on people you encounter.\n\nYou may come across as wicked, cruel or too authoritarian, but actually you only follow your instinct, you sound people out, and you like to exert your domination simply because your vital energy is too powerful to remain inside. You are inclined to be passionate, with hidden motivations. You are sometimes misunderstood but one of your great Plutonian assets is to go successfully through each life ordeal with ever growing strength.\n\nMars is one of your dominant planets and provides you with its efficient energy and enthusiasm: with a powerful Mars in your chart, action - but also will and ability to undertake - is not an empty word for you. You are active, dynamic, willing to fight, courageous, and you are never afraid to move mountains, even though risks are part of the adventures that you start with determination.\n\nHowever, your patience is not always up to your boldness and a kind of feverishness, or even anger, can tarnish the quality of your achievements. That would be a pity since the Marsian is a champion in matters of efficiency! Mars symbolizes display of action, conquering spirit that favours discipline and order - beware of not being fussy - and lies at the frontier between action and brutality, between conquest and potential aggressiveness.\n\nIn your natal chart, the three most important signs - according to criteria mentioned above - are in decreasing order of strength Scorpio, Sagittarius and Aquarius. In general, these signs are important because your Ascendant or your Sun is located there. But this is not always the case: there may be a cluster of planets, or a planet may be near an angle other than the Midheaven or Ascendant. It may also be because two or three planets are considered to be very active because they form numerous aspects from these signs.\n\nThus, you display some of the three signs' characteristics, a bit like a superposition of features on the rest of your chart, and it is all the more so if the sign is emphasized.\n\nWith Scorpio as a dominant sign, you are a strong and astute person, complicated and passionate, sometimes destructive and intolerant, but strong-willed, tough and daring, sometimes bordering on aggressive. So many qualities and dangers combined in one person! Obviously, this often results in a natural selection of people around you: those who stand up to you or admire you and those who can't bear you anymore! But that is precisely what you want. You are what you are and you are not going to transform yourself just to please. You are too proud and you never dread confrontations, although your way of fighting is secret, like your nature that, mysteriously enough, you are so reluctant to reveal even to your close friends who will never understand you. That said... what a hellish charm you have!\n\nSagittarius, an adventurous and conquering fire sign, is dominant in your chart: you are enthusiastic, enterprising, optimistic, very sociable, and mobile - you have itchy feet, both physically and mentally. Nobody gets bored with you because you are always planning things and suggesting excursions, at least... when you are around and not already gone on a trip! Obviously, so many movements for one man may scare people off, and some of them may even criticize your brutality or your tendency to loose your temper, but you are so warm and genuine, so expansive, isn't this a good thing? And all the more so, since your sense of humour is overwhelming...\n\nAquarius is one of the most important signs in your natal chart: it endows your personality - at least one of its facets - with originality, to the point of eccentricity, in spite of a sometimes distant and humane side. Likeable and impassive at the same time, you are a paradoxical man, very hard to define because the two planets Uranus and Saturn blend their qualities to create the so complicated and endearing sign that inspires your character. Saturn's seriousness and impassivity is added to Uranus' rebellion, talent, individualism, charisma, extravagance, and unpredictability! One of your main characteristics is that you never open up on a personal basis, but you tend to do so easily in public. You are actually quite strange. Sexy and charming in public, despite your nice and sociable character, you could frustrate many of your admirers in private because of your impossibility to show deep and warm affection, emotions, tears... But appearance and reality are two different things anyway - you are a kind of a genius, or you have at least a tremendous charm with this sign. You have many friends and an active social life. If you are detached in your love life - only in this aspect, since the rest of chart will confirm it or not - this is no big deal!\n\nAfter this paragraph about dominant planets, of Chas Chandler, here are the character traits that you must read more carefully than the previous texts since they are very specific: the texts about dominant planets only give background information about the personality and remain quite general: they emphasize or, on the contrary, mitigate different particularities or facets of a personality. A human being is a complex whole and only bodies of texts can attempt to successfully figure out all the finer points.\n\nThe Moon in Scorpio: his sensitivity\n\nYour sensitivity is intuitive and clear-sighted Chas Chandler. Your exacerbated affectivity and your emotions are secretive, intense, deep and sensual. Your magnetic nature seduces. You are aware of the strange fascination you exert and you gladly cultivate this mysterious aura. Your feelings are so powerful that you may feel you should repress them sometimes. But the more you try to control them, the stronger they grow. Therefore, your jealousy may reach such levels that it may hurt. Without half-measure, you become aggressive and you can harm because your inner radar instinctively detects other people's weaknesses. Your emotions are often filled with eroticism and you are an explosive blend of lucidity, amorous intensity and constant provocation but... you are so charming! Your nature is attractive, even bewitching. After all, the only persons you offend are the middle course followers...\n\nMercury in Sagittarius: his intellect and social life\n\nYour thirst for learning is considerable, Chas Chandler, and you can spend a lifetime studying languages, geography, philosophy and law, particularly. You are open-minded and you want to abolish all kinds of frontiers. The humanist, who is dormant in you, may turn into a frequent traveller reaching out to others in order to understand them and communicate with them. You express your opinions and your beliefs with honesty and clarity and likewise, you receive others' views with enthusiasm. You have numerous centres of interest and you may be perceived to be superficial, heedless and over-optimistic. However, if you manage to control your tendency to scattering, all your encounters, all your discoveries can positively influence your philosophical life approach.\n\nVenus in Scorpio and the Sun in Sagittarius: his affectivity and seductiveness\n\nIn your chart, the Sun is in Sagittarius and Venus, in Scorpio. These two signs follow each other and are as opposite as they are complementary. The association of restive Scorpio with Sagittarius, open to all winds, is a paradoxical one. Your solar sign gives you an enthusiasm capable of arousing the most unexpected passions. You claim a commendable lack of prejudice and you manage to understand the other person's differences. However, to understand does not mean to accept Often, Scorpio's violent and implacable passions clash with Sagittarius' wide resolutions. For worse and also sometimes, for better. Your paradoxical sensitivity is also part of your strength, your richness and your charm. Sagittarius wants to thoroughly understand and he adjusts his thought process to his beloved partner's. However, this configuration does not describe a quiet conformism. Scorpio is possessive, unyielding and exclusive in his loves and his hatred. Therefore, it is difficult to anticipate your affective reactions. Sometimes, a real understanding of your partner, coupled with an unfailing affective impulse, allows you to experience the intense moments of a shared love. It may be followed by a period of paradoxical, sometimes cruel passions, tears and laughters. A time for if you don't love me, I love you. It is likely that it is your way to avoid what you dread most in the world: boredom born from stiff love.\n\nYou cannot dissociate love from passion, Chas Chandler. Your feelings are immediate, imperious, intense, and it is absolutely impossible for you to think of an amorous relationship without fusion, without the irresistible desire to know everything about your partner: emotions, feelings, sexuality, everything must be experienced in a possessive, absolute and unrestricted way. Actually, your feelings are as complex as they are deep. You seldom love, but when you do, a burning ardour and its torrid, violent frolics consume your couple. It is obvious that such powerful feelings may lead to jealousy and absolute exclusivity, almost bordering on the will to control your partner. If your relationship is genuine, all is fine. But if it is not the case, there are real dangers of shared wounds within your couple; it is hard to reconcile passion with tranquillity and it is clear that for you, sentimental serenity involves a partner who is either as complex as you and who instinctively understands you, or who is complementary, and as calm and steady as your impulses are intense and deep.\n\nThe Sun in Sagittarius: his will and inner motivations\n\nPsychologically speaking, your nature is extroverted and independent, oriented towards expansion and sociability. You have the soul of a leader, energetic and active. Your charisma and your drive are fully integrated into the collective life. Indeed, as an action-oriented fire sign, you challenge yourself and you succeed in accomplishing the task straight away. Sagittarius is hard to follow because his spirit and his independent mind constantly prompt him to go further and higher.\n\nAs you are born under this sign, you are charismatic, fiery, energetic, likeable, benevolent, tidy, jovial, optimistic, extroverted, amusing, straightforward, demonstrative, charming, independent, adventurous, straightforward, bold, exuberant, freedom-loving. But you may also be irascible, selfish, authoritarian, inconsistent, unfaithful, brutal, unreliable, reckless, tactless or unpleasant.\n\nIn love, Sir, you are the mobile fire that consumes everything in your way. You are constantly in love, you are passionate and your energy and your extroversion create a love life that could fit a serialized novel: mobile and changing, you are not the man of a single woman, at least until you find the person who resists you and who arouses a love powerful enough to tame you.\n\nYour need for freedom and independence is so strong that it is difficult for you to settle down. Many break-ups are caused by a feeling of smothering, when your love of the moment becomes too demanding. However, since you are also unstable, you often patch up as if nothing had happened and you will be forgiven: this paradox comes from your explosive mixture comprising ardour, energy, benevolence and fickleness.\n\nSimilarly to the way in which you run your business, you will settle down when you reach your forties or your fifties. You become a good husband and a good father, well acquainted with the rules of your society, full of contentment and joy. Your home will provide the room you need so that you do not feel imprisoned.\n\nMars in Scorpio: his ability to take action\n\nYour iron will is part of your assets, Chas Chandler. It is supported by an ingenuity and a skilfulness that may turn you into a mighty and feared personality. You have the knack of spotting weaknesses in persons you deal with and you can easily hurt them with your innate propensity to drill or to test their force. You are extremely stubborn and you never let go when you are convinced that you are right. Sexually, you are potent and passionate. You are domineering and secretive, with a magnetic personality. It is safer to avoid being taken in a conflict with you because you may be very aggressive and you bear grudges. In some cases, you may also be sadistic. Your personality is as secretive as it is domineering in the areas of action and sexuality.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis text is only an excerpt from of Chas Chandler's portrait. If you want to get your own astrological portrait, much more comprehensive that this present excerpt, you can order it at this page. Do you belong to the Jupiterian type, benevolent and generous? The Martian type, active and a go-getter? The Venusian type, charming and seductive? The Lunar type, imaginative and sensitive? The Solar type, noble and charismatic? The Uranian type, original, uncompromising and a freedom-lover? The Plutonian type, domineering and secretive? The Mercurian type, cerebral, inquiring and quick? The Neptunian type, visionary, capable of empathy and impressionable? The Saturnian type, profound, persevering and responsible? Are you more of the Fire type, energetic and intuitive? The Water type, sentimental and receptive? The Earth type, realistic and efficient? Or the Air type, gifted in communication and highly intellectual? 11 planetary dominants and 57 characteristics are reviewed, quantified, and interpreted; then, your psychological portrait is described in detail, in a comprehensive document of approximately 32-36 pages, full of engrossing and original pieces of information about yourself.\n\nAstrological reports describe many of the character traits and they sometimes go deeper into the understanding of a personality. Please, always keep in mind that human beings are continuously evolving and that many parts of our psychological structures are likely to be expressed later, after having undergone significant life's experiences. It is advised to read a portrait with hindsight in order to appreciate its astrological content. Under this condition, you will be able to take full advantage of this type of study.\n\nThe analysis of an astrological portrait consists in understanding four types of elements which interact with one another: ten planets, twelve zodiacal signs, twelve houses, and what are called aspects between planets (the 11 aspects most commonly used are: conjunction, opposition, square, trine, sextile, quincunx, semi-sextile, sesqui-quadrate, quintile and bi-quintile. The first 5 aspects enumerated are called major aspects).\n\nPlanets represent typologies of our human psychology: sensitivity, affectivity, ability to undertake, will-power, mental process, aptitude, and taste for communication etc., all independent character facets are divided here for practical reasons. The twelve signs forming the space where planets move will \"colour\", so to speak, these typologies with each planet being located in its particular sign. They will then enrich the quality of these typologies, as expressed by the planets. The Zodiac is also divided into twelve astrological houses. This makes sense only if the birth time is known because within a few minutes, the twelve houses (including the 1st one, the Ascendant) change significantly. They correspond to twelve specific spheres of life: external behaviour, material, social and family life, relationship, home, love life, daily work, partnership, etc. Each planet located in any given house will then act according to the meaning of its house, and a second colouration again enriches those active forces that the planets symbolize. Finally, relations will settle among planets, creating a third structure, which completes the planets' basic meanings. A set of ancient rules, which has stood the test of experience over hundreds of years (although astrology is in evolution, only reliable elements are integrated into classical studies), are applied to organize the whole chart into a hierarchy and to allow your personality to be interpreted by texts. The planets usually analysed are the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, which means two luminaries (the Sun and the Moon) and 8 planets, a total of 10 planets. Additional secondary elements may be taken into account, such as asteroids Chiron, Vesta, Pallas, Ceres (especially Chiron, more well-known), the Lunar nodes, the Dark Moon or Lilith, and even other bodies: astrology is a discipline on the move. Astrological studies, including astrological portrait, compatibility of couples, predictive work, and horoscopes evolve and become more accurate or deeper, as time goes by.\n\nPrecision: concerning the horoscopes with a known time of birth, according to the Tradition, we consider that a planet near the beginning (called cuspide) of the next house (less than 2 degrees for the Ascendant and the Midheaven, and less than 1 degree for all other houses) belongs to this house: our texts and dominants take this rule into account. You can also choose not to take this shift into account in the form, and also tick the option Koch or Equal houses system instead of Placidus, the default houses system.\n\nWarning: In order to avoid any confusion and any possible controversy, we want to draw your attention upon the fact that this sample of celebrities is very complete and therefore, it also includes undesirable people, since every category is represented: beside artists, musicians, politicians, lawyers, professional soldiers, poets, writers, singers, explorers, scientists, academics, religious figures, saints, philosophers, sages, astrologers, mediums, sportsmen, chess champions, famous victims, historical characters, members of royal families, models, painters, sculptors, and comics authors or other actual celebrities, there are also famous murderers, tyrants and dictators, serial-killers, or other characters whose image is very negative, often rightly so.\n\nRegarding the latter, it must be remembered that even a monster or at least a person who perpetrated odious crimes, has some human qualities, often noticed by his/her close entourage: these excerpts come from computer programmes devoid of polemical intentions and may seem too soft or lenient. The positive side of each personality is deliberately stressed. Negative sides have been erased here - it is not the same in our comprehensive reports on sale - because it could hurt the families of such people. We are hoping that it will not rebound on the victims' side.\n\nNumerology: Birth Path of Chas Chandler\n\nTestimonies to numerology are found in the most ancient civilizations and show that numerology pre-dates astrology. This discipline considers the name, the surname, and the date of birth, and ascribes a meaning to alphabetic letters according to the numbers which symbolise them.\n\nThe path of life, based on the date of birth, provides indications on the kind of destiny which one is meant to experience. It is one of the elements that must reckoned with, along with the expression number, the active number, the intimacy number, the achievement number, the hereditary number, the dominant numbers or the lacking numbers, or also the area of expression, etc.\n\nYour Life Path is influenced by the number 6, Chas, and indicates a destiny marked with an intense desire for love, conciliation, and harmony. You feel driven by an ideal of perfection which brings about responsible behaviour and devotion to a group, a family, or a homeland... At times, your thirst for balance prompts you to adopt intransigent, even tyrannical attitudes, which is the other side of the coin for your constant concern for equity and justice which is sometimes disappointed by the blunt reality. You undeniably demonstrate devotion to your parents or your spouse, which is a sign that your family life is harmonious. In this field, owing to your sense of duty, you are a reliable person. Your balance depends on a harmonious life and on your capacity to make the good choices. It is on these conditions that your qualities can fully bloom: creativity, altruism, personal radiance...\n\nChas Chandler was born under the sign of the Tiger, element Earth\n\nChinese astrology is brought to us as a legacy of age-old wisdom and invites us to develop an awareness of our inner potential. It is believed that the wise man is not subjected to stellar influences. However, we must gain the lucidity and the distance without which we remain locked up in an implacable destiny. According to the legend of the Circle of Animals, Buddha summoned all the animals to bid them farewell before he left our world. Only twelve species answered Buddha's call. They form the Chinese Zodiac and symbolize the twelve paths of wisdom that are still valid nowadays.\n\nThe Asian wise man considers that a path is neither good nor bad. One can and must develop one's potentialities. The first step is to thoroughly know oneself.\n\nYou frequently show a lot of impulsiveness: passionate and warm, you are very emotional and sensitive to the affective nature of any relationship. You are often reckless and you hardly put up with any links of subordination and subjection.\n\nYou must take control of your life and free yourself from the limits that life imposes on you. You tend to take risky, even totally inordinate stands. It's the other side of the coin for your desire to live intensely...\n\nYou need your entourage's support and esteem. Whether you acknowledge it or you carefully conceal it, your self-confidence is only an appearance: you are vulnerable and more than anyone, you are concerned about the image you project. You manage your life with the constant concern to shine and to be up to all situations. Thus, you do not accept contradictions, errors or failures.\n\nYour qualities lie in your outstanding panache and the ability to constantly transcend your own limitations. Your hatred of mediocre and average situations is legendary! You need elegance and brio. You are enthusiastic and you give your life a dramatic and spectacular turn. It is likely that you have to control your pride, as time goes by. Nobody's perfect, including the Tiger!\n\nChinese astrology has five elements, which are referred to as agents: Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal and Water.\n\nYou have a deep affinity with the agent Earth. In China, this element corresponds to the planet Saturn, the yellow colour and the number 5.\n\nYou are realistic, often cautious, and you plan your life carefully, leaving nothing to chance and handling situations pragmatically. The objectivity you display can but prevent you from being caught into traps and illusions. Therefore, you are a very reassuring person to your entourage: they readily rely on your sense of reality.\n\nFar be it from you to take an interest in fancy projects or chimeras that appeal to a good many people! It is important that you retain only sound viewpoints and orientations, as well as elements that have proved their worth.\n\nOf course, you still have to show a bit of fantasy: some inconsiderate risks may prove to pay off and hare-brained ideas, as trivial as may be, may bring an undeniable pleasantness into a dull and stiff routine. Then, the seriousness with which you manage your life can but bear fruit.\n\nN. B.: when the birth time is unknown, (12:00 PM (unknown)), these portrait excerpts do not take into account the parameters derived from the time, which means, the domification (Ascendant, astrological houses, etc.). Nonetheless, these analyses remain accurate in any case. Regarding the sources of the birth data in our possession, kindly note that the pages we publish constitute a starting point for more detailed research, even though they seem useful to us. When the sources are contradictory, which occurs rarely, after having analysed them, we choose the most reliable one. Sometimes, we publish a birth date just because it is made available, but we do not claim that is it the best one, by no means."
