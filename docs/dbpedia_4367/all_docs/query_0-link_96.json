        "text": "The British Invasion Remembered!\n\nWell before I started this blog, I had my rather ramshackle British Invasion blog site. Then, after a few years, I started PopBopRockTilUDrop and merged the two sites. I haven’t spent a lot of time since then on the British U.S. Invasion. So, I have decided to occasionally tip my hat to Brits who first made their way to our shores!\n\nThe Animals would let us know that there was going to be more to the British Invasion than we first realized. When I first heard “House of the Rising Sun”, the group with the great bluesy lead singer got my attention!\n\nThe Animals grew out of the Newcastle band “The Alan Price Rhythm & Blues Combo” with Price, Eric Burdon, Hilton Valentine, John Steel and Bryan ‘Chas’ Chandler being the originals.\n\nThe band arrived in the U.S., landing in New York in September of 1964 embarking on their first North American tour including their first appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show.\n\nThe first original member to depart was keyboard player Price who left in the spring of 1965 due to some personal differences and also his fear of flying. By late 1966 the lineup had pretty much been revamped and the group became known as “Eric Burdon and the Animals”.\n\nOver time there have been nearly two dozen Animals pass through the ranks.\n\nChas Chandler died in 1996 – Valentine died in 2021\n\nThe Animals U.K. Discography\n\nThe Animals U.S. Discography\n\nEric Burdon Beyond the Animals Discography\n\n1960s-Era Animals Selected
