        "text": "Eric Burdon & The Animals is a renowned British rock band that emerged during the 1960s. Originating from Newcastle upon Tyne, England, the group was initially known as The Alan Price Rhythm and Blues Combo before changing their name to The Animals. They gained recognition for their gritty, bluesy sound and deep-voiced frontman, Eric Burdon.\n\n​\n\nThe band's lineup included Eric Burdon as vocalist, Alan Price on keyboards, Hilton Valentine on guitar, Chas Chandler on bass, and John Steel on drums. Their breakthrough hit was a version of the traditional folk song \"House of the Rising Sun,\" which topped the charts in the UK, the US, and Canada in 1964.\n\n​\n\nThe band went through numerous personnel changes and name alterations, becoming Eric Burdon & The Animals in 1966. This incarnation of the group pursued a psychedelic rock sound, producing hits such as \"San Franciscan Nights\" and \"Sky Pilot.\"\n\n​\n\nDespite their success, internal conflicts led to the band's dissolution in 1969. Eric Burdon continued his music career as a solo artist and with other groups like War. The legacy of Eric Burdon & The Animals endures, with their innovative fusion of rock and blues influencing generations of musicians. The original lineup was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994."
