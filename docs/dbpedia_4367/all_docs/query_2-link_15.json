        "text": "Bryan “Chas” Chandler was a former Heaton Grammar School pupil who found fame with legendary North East rock band The Animals.\n\nA plaque in memory of the talented bass player was unveiled in 2007 at the house in Second Avenue, Heaton, where he used to live with his parents.\n\nWe Gotta Get out of This Place - 50 years old this year - was a hit for The Animals the year after The House of The Rising Sun went to number one in the UK and the US - where it is said to have been popular with troops during the Vietnam War - as well as Canada and Australia.\n\nIt will be 50 years ago next summer that Chas happened upon the man now regarded as the world’s greatest and most influential rock guitarist.\n\nHe was on his final tour with The Animals in the US when he heard about a talented young guitarist and went along to New York’s Cafe Wha to see him in action.\n\nAnd from there a music partnership was born, which saw Jimi Hendrix and his high-volume, blue-based playing style revolutionise rock and set the stage alight - nearly literally sometimes when he smashed and burned his guitar during shows.\n\nChas swiftly formed a band around Hendrix in London - The Jimi Hendrix Experience - and also introduced his discovery to the North East where he performed and is also said to have busked in Heaton.\n\nWhen Hendrix died in 1970, hit albums such as Are You Experienced and Electric Ladyland and singles Hey Joe and Voodoo Chile served to his music alive.\n\nChas managed seventies rockers Slade too.\n\nIn 2013, reflecting on his own 50 years in the music business, the band’s frontman Noddy Holder said: “My manager and producer Chas Chandler was from Newcastle and I had a lot of good times in the North East when I went up there.\n\n“I can’t remember much about it but I know I had a great time!”\n\nIn the 1990s, Chas - alongside his friend and fellow musician Nigel Stanger - helped establish Newcastle Arena, now Metro Radio Arena.\n\nIn 1996 he died after suffering heart problems at the age of just 57."
