        "text": "Greenwich Village, New York, 1966. Late afternoon at the Cafe Wha and a shell-shocked Chas Chandler, bass guitarist with The Animals, sits chatting to an unknown musician shortly to take the world by storm.\n\n\"When I saw him,\" Chandler remembers, \"he was simply awesome. If I ever wanted proof that I should quit being a musician, then just watching him was it. He was light years ahead of anyone I'd ever heard.\n\n\"Now, I never regarded myself as a great musician — although I'd played some pretty good stuff with some pretty good people — but this guy just left everyone I'd ever seen anywhere in the world on a different planet.\"\n\nThe player was Jimi Hendrix. At the time, Chandler was about to begin an American tour with The Animals but, having grown tired of the road and weary of the band, he'd already decided to throw in the towel when the shows were over.\n\n\"After seeing Jimi and talking to him,\" he explains, \"I knew what I wanted to do; I had to work with him.\" The tour finished, Chandler swiftly returned to New York, took his discovery to England and, for two years, managed and produced Hendrix.\n\nDuring their time together, Chandler helped create Hendrix classics like Hey Joe and Purple Haze, but when he went into the studio to begin work on the Electric Ladyland album, he realised it was time to break up the association while the going was still good.\n\n\"Why?\" says Chandler, \"well, Jimi and a guy who'd been involved with us started to take an awful lot of acid. I thought it was a disaster area.\n\n\"They were sniffing a lot of coke, too — but I didn't find out about that until long after I'd split with Jimi. I had no idea about it; I thought he was just doing acid, pot and some booze.\n\n\"The pair of them were really into a lot of drugs and it had really become an ugly scene. They were getting out of their heads. Jimi would turn up at the studio with about 10 or 12 hangers-on and, instead of making a record, he'd be wanting to play with them.\n\n\"Because of all those drugs, the environment became peculiar. I was married to my first wife at the time — she was expecting a baby — and I just looked at things and thought... I don't want my kid to grow up in this fucking set. It was as simple as that. Good bit of judgement that, I think.\"\n\nBut, despite the drug abuse, Chandler remembers Hendrix as a model musician.\n\n\"We shared a flat for two years, and Jimi was terrific. He was great company and intelligent. We never had an argument, we just used to talk music 24 hours a day.\n\n\"We'd go to gigs, I'd stand in the audience, and then go backstage and we'd compare notes at the end of the show. We'd be in the studio, and then come back home and play the tapes all night until we'd figured out exactly what we were going to do the next day. We just lived and breathed his career for two years.\n\n\"He was the easiest guy in the world to manage. He used to get erratic at times — but he was a pro; he'd been playing in bands for years, he knew the discipline of the road.\n\n\"He'd blow off steam and things but, when I was working with him, he never failed to turn up for a show — and he was never out of it during one. 15 months after we parted, Jimi was dead, I've never really been able to talk about it, it's hard to when that happens to somebody so close. It's all still locked up inside my head.\"\n\nUnearthing Hendrix hasn't been the sole slice of musical shrewdness from Chandler, an imposing 6' 4\" native of Newcastle with a thick Geordie accent and a laugh like Frank Carson.\n\nWithin months of leaving Hendrix, and having seriously intended to drop out, exhausted from the business, he'd dug out some more raw talent from a tiny Bond Street disco. \"They sent a shiver down my spine,\" he recalls. \"They were called Ambrose Slade.\"\n\nDrop the Ambrose and you know the rest; Chandler managed and produced the Wolverhampton rockers through their most successful, history-making period — which included six number one singles and three number one albums.\n\n\"Slade were fantastic to manage,\" he says. \"But we did have our rough patches career-wise. You couldn't get arrested with them at one time, they went so cold. Nobody realised just how hard-working a live band Slade were.\n\n\"But then, in the late '70s, there was the Lincoln Festival — they wiped the floor with everybody. It was like taking candy from a baby. I mean, they simply out-experienced all these legendary bands who'd done about eight gigs in the last six years; Slade had been working 200 nights a year!\n\n\"The same thing happened three or four years ago at Reading. I'd tried for years to get them on at the Festival, but the organisers wouldn't touch them, then, that year, Ozzy Osbourne pulled out — and suddenly we were asked to do it.\n\n\"I had to talk the lads into it because they were going through a period where things were so slow they were on the point of breaking up. I just said to them 'If you're going to break up — so what? At least do it and have your last concert on a big stage. After all the success of Slade, do you want to look back on your last gig being at the Scene Club in Middlesborough? Don't you think you owe it to your memories to go out with a bang?'\n\nSo they did it — they went on stage after five years cold and wiped everybody away. Within four months we had a record back in the top ten.\"\n\nBut soon after Chandler packed in Slade.\n\n\"None of us could see the forest for the trees any more,\" he says. \"Our association, instead of being strict — like manager and producer — had become blurred. After 12 years, we knew each other too well, inside out.\n\n\"There's nothing special about my judgement. It's absolutely average, and that's the whole secret of this business\""
