ROCK legend Chas Chandler will be honoured by his home city of Newcastle – 11 years after his death.

Newcastle City Council is planning to place a commemorative black plaque outside the house in Heaton where the world-famous musician grew up.

Mr Chandler shot to fame in the 1960s with The Animals, who took the world by storm with smash hits such as House of the Rising Sun. He went on to become a highly successful musical entrepreneur and businessman, discovering stars like Jimi Hendrix.

And with his friend and fellow musician, Nigel Stanger, he helped establish one of the region’s top entertainment and indoor sporting venues, the Newcastle Arena, now the Metro Radio Arena.

In 1996, the year after the arena opened, Mr Chandler died after suffered heart problems. He was 57.

He was born Bryan James Chandler and the plan is to place the plaque outside the house where he lived with his parents in Second Avenue, Heaton. Mr Chandler, who attended Heaton Grammar School, returned to the North East in the mid-1980s and lived in Cullercoats with his beauty queen wife, Madeleine Stringer and their four children.

Newcastle has more than 90 black plaques in memory of famous people, which are part of the city’s heritage trail.

Ray Laidlaw who played with another legendary Tyneside band, Lindisfarne, said: “He was one of the great characters of rock and roll, and it’s fitting that something should be done to commemorate him in his home city.”

Colin Revell, executive director of the Arena, said: “It’s a great idea. Chas was someone who had a passion for Newcastle.”

Coun Pauline Allen, executive member for culture and heritage, said: “Not only did Chas Chandler help make a major contribution to pop music, he helped establish one of the country’s leading entertainment venues and secure Newcastle’s place on the cultural map.”
