Chas Chandler, whose bass playing helped the Animals hit it big in the 1960s with songs such as The House of The Rising Sun, died Wednesday. He was 57.

Mr. Chandler died at Newcastle General Hospital, where he was undergoing tests related to an aortic aneurysm, said Keith Altham, a long-time friend. "It appears he suffered some form of attack as he slept," Altham said.

Mr. Chandler was playing in the Alan Price Trio in 1962 when vocalist Eric Burdon joined the band. They renamed the group the Animals.

Their first hit song was Rising Sun, a No. 1 in 1964, followed by others including Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood, Bring It On Home to Me and We've Gotta Get Out of This Place.

"We toured non-stop for three years, 300 gigs a year and we hardly got a penny," Mr. Chandler told The Independent newspaper in 1994.

The Animals were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.

After the group split up in 1966, Mr. Chandler turned to managing other rock stars. After meeting Jimi Hendrix, Mr. Chandler recruited Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding to form the Jimi Hendrix Experience.

Mr. Chandler produced the first two Hendrix albums, Are You Experienced? and Axis: Bold as Love, but quit halfway through Electric Ladyland, frustrated with the hangers-on and endless rerecording of tracks. Hendrix died in London in 1970.

"My only obvious regret is I wonder if I didn't walk out maybe he would still be alive. He is a loss; he was a good friend," Mr. Chandler said in a 1991 Associated Press interview.

Mr. Chandler went on to manage other groups. Recently, he and his business partner Nigel Stanger, a one-time Animals saxophonist, developed Newcastle Arena, a 10,500-seat sports and entertainment venue that opened last year.

Mr. Chandler was born Bryan Chandler on Dec. 18, 1938 in Heaton, near Newcastle. He is survived by his wife, Madeleine, their three children, and a son by a previous marriage.
