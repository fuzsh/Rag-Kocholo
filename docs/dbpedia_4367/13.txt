A permanent memorial honouring Tyneside musician and entrepreneur Chas Chandler has been unveiled.

Mr Chandler, who died in 1996, found fame as bass player with 60s pop group The Animals and went on to manage acts such as Jimi Hendrix and Slade.

Later he helped to develop the Newcastle Arena, which remains one of the most popular venues in the region.

A plaque was unveiled at the Newcastle house of his parents, after city councillors agreed to honour him.

The plaque was unveiled at 35 Second Avenue, Heaton, the house Mr Chandler shared with his parents James and Annie Emily.

Guests at the ceremony included Mr Chandler's widow Madeleine and three of his four children.

Chas Chandler died in 1996

In August, Newcastle City Council's conservation advisory committee agreed to honour the musician, who was born Bryan James Chandler, in December 1938.

The former Heaton Grammar School pupil joined his first band at the age of 14 and later joined the Alan Price Combo, playing bass guitar.

The band changed their name to The Animals in 1964 and recorded a string of hits, including The House of the Rising Sun and We've Got to Get Out of this Place.

He died in July 1996 as a result of a heart condition.

A city council spokesman said: "Chas Chandler and The Animals helped to put the city on the global map.

"He will be remembered not only for writing some amazing music and discovering successful musicians, but also helping establish one of the country's leading entertainment venues."
