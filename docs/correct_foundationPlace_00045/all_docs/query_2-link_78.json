        "text": "31 exceptional young Australians will join Australia’s most generous scholarship program for postgraduate study overseas.\n\n264 applications received – more than two and a half times the number of applications received than in the program’s inaugural year in 2021.\n\n113 scholars sent to the world’s best overseas universities in just four years.\n\nScholarship valued at up to AUD$90,000 p.a.\n\nSydney, Wednesday 17 July 2024: The Ramsay Centre is proud to announce the 2024 recipients of our Ramsay Postgraduate Scholarship – 31 outstanding young Australians, committed to advancing a richer, deeper understanding of our civilisation through study at the world’s best overseas universities.\n\nThe 31 scholars form the fourth cohort of Ramsay Postgraduate Scholars. They will be supported with funding of up to AUD$90,000 p.a. for one, two and in select cases three years of coursework and/or research.\n\nThe Centre received 264 applications for the scholarship this year, more than two and a half times the number received for the first intake in 2021. The surge in applications aligns with the scholarship’s growing recognition and prestige, and overwhelming popularity with young Australian leaders, eager to study at the world’s best overseas universities, and return to Australia to make a difference.\n\nIn just four years the program has now offered this transformative educational experience to 113 young Australians.\n\nApplicants were judged by a panel of eminent Australians chaired by NSW Solicitor General Michael Sexton SC. Selection criteria included strength of character, leadership, and service; academic achievement; future goals; and a commitment to advancing a richer and deeper understanding of our civilisation. Applicants must have been accepted into a graduate program at a world-leading overseas institution before applying.\n\nThe 2024 scholars hail from various areas of Australia, across nearly all states and territories. Through the scholarship they will attend premium global tertiary institutions including Oxford, Cambridge, Georgetown, John Hopkins, Sciences Po Paris, King’s College London, University College London, Zurich University of the Arts, Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands and St John’s College, Annapolis.\n\nBetween them these young leaders seek to make a difference in areas as diverse as tropical diseases, education, Australia’s space industry, regulation of state power, traditional architecture, the arts and combatting disinformation.\n\nAmong the scholars is an education economist addressing rising disadvantage in schools, who will study a PhD at the University of Cambridge to research solutions to educational inequality. A medical student will take a year’s intermission from his studies, also to attend Cambridge, where he will investigate the biology of a malaria parasite, to bolster his credentials for future work on tropical diseases in resource-poor communities.\n\nOther scholars include an international security adviser interested in how climate change is shaping conflict dynamics in our region, a cyber and disinformation policy adviser who will explore the intersection of disinformation and AI policy, a historian undertaking research on securing justice for survivors of historic institutional abuse, a constitutional lawyer seeking to contribute to fundamental legal doctrines regulating state power, and a philosopher focussed on computational methods to understand the ideas of the Scottish Enlightenment.\n\nThere are three engineers in this year’s cohort; two seek to improve engineering practices, one to ensure a sustainable space industry, the other to improve planetary health. The third is an engineer turned philosopher who will study a PhD in Philosophy at University College London where he will explore the nature of moral responsibility, particularly notions of just deserts.\n\nPerformers in the 2024 cohort include a violinist and pianist as well as a Shakespearean actor and English literature scholar, who has played lead roles in Shakespeare theatre productions throughout Europe and Latin America, and who hopes to combine her literary studies with her practical knowledge of the theatre to pursue a career in artistic directorship.\n\nThis year five scholars among the cohort will study the Master of Arts in Liberal Arts at St John’s College, Annapolis. All are keen to round out their education with the unique liberal arts model that St John’s offers, with its focus on sustained reflection about the human condition through the close reading and discussion of the great texts which have shaped the Western intellectual tradition.\n\nThe 2024 scholars have been awarded funding from one of two scholarship categories:\n\nthe World Universities Ramsay Postgraduate Scholarship, for graduate study in any field or discipline at a prestigious overseas university of their choosing, or\n\nthe St John’s College, Annapolis, Ramsay Postgraduate Scholarship, for study of the Master of Arts in Liberal Arts at this acclaimed US liberal arts college, as well as participation in an internship program in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe scholarships have been made possible through the extraordinary generosity of our founder and benefactor, the late Paul Ramsay AO. Paul Ramsay founded Ramsay Health Care, now one of the largest private hospital operators, and was also a regional television pioneer, building stations that today form the Prime Television Network.\n\nKnown as a ‘man for others’, Paul Ramsay always wanted to give back to his country and his fellow Australians. He had a profound sense of gratitude for the opportunities Australia had afforded him, as one of many countries that have benefited from being part of the long continuum of Western civilisation. He wanted younger Australians to share that appreciation by learning more about our heritage and to take the lead in passing that knowledge on to others.\n\nThese scholarships in his name support our future leaders to do just that, by supporting their graduate study at the world’s best overseas universities.\n\nA full list of names of the 31 Ramsay Postgraduate Scholars and their bios can be found on the following pages of this release.\n\nFor more information on our Ramsay Postgraduate Scholarships and how to apply visit: https://www.ramsaycentre.org/scholarships-courses/postgraduate-scholarships/\n\nMedia contact: Sarah Switzer 0407 816 098/ sarah.switzer@ramsaycentre.org\n\nFor more information on the centre please visit our website: www.ramsaycentre.org\n\n2024 Ramsay Postgraduate Scholars\n\nWorld Universities Ramsay Postgraduate Scholars\n\nJYE BEARDOW\n\nBachelor of Civil Law – University of Oxford\n\nJye Beardow is a constitutional lawyer in the Australian Government Solicitor’s Constitutional Litigation Unit in Canberra.
