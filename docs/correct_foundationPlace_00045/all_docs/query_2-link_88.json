        "text": "Associate Principal Scientist Immunology\n\nAstraZeneca is a global, science-driven biopharmaceutical company. We are dedicated to discovering, developing, and delivering innovative, meaningful medicines and healthcare solutions that enrich the lives of patients. The vision of AstraZeneca Early Respiratory & Immunology (Early R&I) is centered on delivering life-changing products that advance world health and help fight and cure disease. Early R&I is one of three main therapeutic research areas within AstraZeneca that deliver candidate drugs into late-stage clinical development. Here, you’ll have the opportunity to make a difference in people’s lives every day.\n\nAs a part of the growing Immunology Bioscience team within Early R&I department, we are seeking a highly motivated senior researcher with a strong understanding of adaptive and innate immunity and the key biological pathways underlying immune-mediated diseases in rheumatology and preferably gastrointestinal or dermatology indications. The role will be based in Gaithersburg (US) within AstraZeneca’s state-of-the-art laboratories where you will follow the science to help drive innovation and advance medicines.\n\nIn this role, you would be expected to demonstrate an exceptionally high level of enthusiasm for innovative scientific research supporting clinical assets and the discovery and development of novel therapeutics. You should have a strong scientific pedigree and desire to generate data, collaborate and publish. Ideally expertise in drug discovery across multiple platforms including large molecule, small molecule or cell therapy, and experience transitioning preclinical assets into the clinic.\n\nMain Duties and Responsibilities\n\nLead scientific workstreams to characterize immunological pathways to support the development of clinical assets for the treatment of rheumatological diseases in collaboration with external experts, and global project teams. The candidate will contribute to the identification of novel targets, target validation, and delivery of preclinical and translational data in support of key portfolio program milestones through partnering with multiple functional teams.\n\nDrive technical excellence in bioscience research and contribute to the strategic direction of the Bioscience Immunology leadership team. You will take an active role in growing and developing team members. This job requires strong communication skills and you will have significant opportunity to drive the direction of the work.\n\n• Design and execute in vitro and in vivo experiments integrating both disease and pathway approaches in support of portfolio programs.\n\n• Develop and lead collaborations with disease experts\n\n• Work closely with key leaders in partner functions to ensure project goals are met\n\n• Develop, coach, mentor, motivate and inspire team members in Bioscience, Immunology team.\n\n• Drive innovation and scientific excellence in Bioscience through internal scientific development, external collaborations, publications and competitive awareness.\n\n• Expected to actively establish and manage external scientific collaborations.\n\n• Make AstraZeneca scientifically visible by publishing scientific papers and presenting data at conferences.\n\n• You will collaborate with scientists from a variety of functional teams in Gaithersburg and with our sites in Boston, Cambridge, UK and Gothenburg, Sweden.\n\nEssentials for the role:\n\n• Ph.D in immunology or relevant research area, with multiple years of industry experience is required\n\n• Highly organized and self-motivated, with the ability to work independently as well as collaboratively within a team to conduct a high-level research project.\n\n• Expertise in managing drug discovery projects in immunology or a closely related field of biology is essential.\n\n• Demonstrated ability to run collaborative efforts and utilize external resources to find the most effective solutions to drug discovery problems.\n\n• Experience with mentoring students from the undergraduate to Ph.D level is essential.\n\n• Experience with multiple drug modalities, including large molecule, small molecule or cell therapies is strongly preferred.\n\n• Strong understanding in multiple biochemical and molecular techniques including primary cell culture, quantification of mRNA (qPCR), multi-panel flow cytometry (including both intracellular and extracellular markers) and protein expression; ELISA, Western blot, MSD, Luminex, etc. are strongly preferred.\n\n• Ex vivo culture experience, working with primary human tissue samples, and knowledge of in vivo models of autoimmunity and inflammation are preferred.\n\n• Strong written and oral communication skills and the ability to critically analyze data sets.\n\nAstraZeneca embraces diversity and equality of opportunity. We are committed to building an inclusive and diverse team representing all backgrounds, with as wide a range of perspectives as possible, and harnessing industry-leading skills.
