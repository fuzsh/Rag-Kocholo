        "text": "We seek to build a dynamic portfolio of great businesses led by world-class executives. Historically, our investments have largely focused on businesses in the information services, technology, and education industries.\n\nWe have a long history of growing our portfolio companies through acquisitions and proving our ability to integrate companies successfully. Our primary goal is to expand and grow existing operating companies through strategic acquisitions. CIG concentrates on businesses of any size, location, and technology structure that can leverage our existing platforms.\n\nWe seek to partner with other high quality investment firms to invest in and build great businesses for the long term. Our recent investment partners include Goldman Sachs, Atairos, Abry Partners, and VSS, among others.\n\nOutside of our core businesses, we explore new opportunities with a diversified perspective. We are always seeking to partner alongside businesses with strong management teams and the potential to leverage CIG’s strategic and financial resources. If needed, our team has experience in management buyouts, turnaround situations, and venture-oriented investments. We look for situations in which we can apply our team’s expertise, long-term perspective, permanent capital base, and a partner mentality to help businesses develop and flourish."
