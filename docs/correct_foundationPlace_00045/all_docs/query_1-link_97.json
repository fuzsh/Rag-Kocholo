For universities, one of the key challenges is the mixture of qualifications that an applicant may present. Not only are the constituent countries of the UK providing different styles of existing qualifications, but as subjects are phased in, we are seeing applicants offering a mixture of both old and new style GCSEs and A Levels.\n\nWe look at each applicant on an individual basis, but the reference is key in explaining the teaching within the school to the admissions selector. We ask referees to provide a clear explanation of any restrictions or difficulties the applicants may have faced in terms of funding and subject availability, along with an explanation of the styles of GCSE/A levels they have taken.\n\nPredictions and AS modules\n\nWith the introduction of curriculum reforms, we understand that it will be more difficult for teachers to predict final grades in the initial year of study. In the past, AS modules have been useful as an indication of a student's level of achievement and likelihood to achieve their prediction. As this information will no longer be available, we will be more reliant on applicants' past academic history and references. We would also encourage referees to comment on an applicant's level of achievement in the end of year 12 examinations where these have been held, and to provide a picture of the applicant's progress through both GCSE and A Level study.\n\nCore Mathematics\n\nThe Core Mathematics qualification does not form part of our standard entrance requirements, but UCL welcomes the opportunity for students to be able to continue their mathematics studies. For programmes where GCSE Mathematics is required at grade 6 (or grade B), Core Mathematics will be accepted as a supplement to grade 5 (or grade C) at GCSE."
