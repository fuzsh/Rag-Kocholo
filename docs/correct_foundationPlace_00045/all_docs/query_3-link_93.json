        "text": "Cambridge Primary starts learners on an exciting educational journey. It develops young learners who are confident, responsible, reflective, innovative and engaged, and includes assessment that improves learning.\n\nCambridge Primary develops skills in subjects including English, Mathematics and Science. It is designed to help schools deliver a broad and balanced curriculum that suits their context, culture and ethos.\n\nThe curriculum sets clear learning objectives and focuses on developing knowledge and skills in all subjects, providing excellent foundations for the next stage of education. The curriculum is flexible, so schools can offer any combination of the subjects available.\n\nCambridge Primary helps prepare children for Lower Secondary Checkpoint and IGCSEs/International GCSEs. It gives them a love of learning that will stay with them through school, university and beyond.\n\nA foundation for progression\n\nCambridge Lower Secondary provides excellent preparation for Cambridge Upper Secondary and other educational programmes. Cambridge Lower Secondary Checkpoint tests can be used to monitor learnersâ readiness for the next stage of education.\n\nInternational curriculum\n\nAppropriate and relevant internationally, Cambridge Lower Secondary has been designed to be culturally sensitive. It includes top-quality teaching and assessment resources appropriate for teaching and learning in local and international schools.\n\nCambridge Lower Secondary is typically for learners aged 11 to 14 years. It gives schools a flexible framework for developing skills and understanding in English as a first or second language, mathematics, science, Cambridge Global Perspectives and ICT Starters.\n\nBeneï¬ts for your child\n\nCambridge Lower Secondary starts learners on an educational journey for their ï¬rst years of secondary education, increasing their knowledge and skills at each stage. It provides a natural progression for children from primary education and prepares them for post-14 education programmes that lead to formal qualiï¬cations.\n\nA number of progress checks are built into the Cambridge Lower Secondary programme, which enable teachers to monitor your child's development. The emphasis of tests is on showing where your child is on their own learning journey, rather than simply getting right or wrong answers.\n\nCambridge Checkpoint tests can be taken in the ï¬nal year of Cambridge Lower Secondary. These tests are available in English, English as a Second Language, Mathematics and Science, and are marked in Cambridge, England.\n\nOn completion of Cambridge Checkpoint, your child will receive a statement of achievement and detailed feedback on their strengths and weaknesses. This helps your school to advise on different progression routes after age 14 and choose the one that will be most suitable for your child.\n\nWe have students studying in our Cambridge Section from Belgium, England, Georgia, Hong Kong, Iran, Japan, Malaysia, Nigeria, South Africa, UAE and USA.\n\nCambridge Upper Secondary is typically for learners aged 14 to 16 years. The Cambridge IGCSE (International General Certificate of Secondary Education) curriculum offers a variety of routes for learners with a wide range of abilities.\n\nSchools build a curriculum around their specific needs. Starting from a foundation of core subjects, it is easy to add breadth and cross-curricular perspectives. Encouraging learners to engage with a variety of subjects, and make connections between them, is fundamental to our approach. Cambridge IGCSE offers a flexible curriculum, supported by excellent resources and training.\n\nFor learners, Cambridge IGCSE helps improve performance by developing skills in creative thinking, enquiry and problem solving. It is the perfect springboard to advanced study.\n\nCambridge IGCSE develops learner knowledge, understanding and skills in:\n\nSubject content\n\nApplying knowledge and understanding to new as well as unfamiliar situations\n\nIntellectual enquiry\n\nFlexibility and responsiveness to change\n\nWorking and communicating in English\n\nInfluencing outcomes\n\nCultural awareness.\n\nSchools worldwide have been involved in the development of Cambridge IGCSE. The syllabuses are international in outlook, but retain a local relevance. They have been created specifically for an international student body.\n\nAssessments\n\nCambridge IGCSE assessment takes place at the end of the course and can include written, oral, coursework and practical assessment. This broadens opportunities for students to demonstrate their learning. In many subjects there is a choice between core and extended curricula, making Cambridge IGCSE suitable for a wide range of abilities.\n\nGrades are benchmarked using eight internationally recognised grades, A* to G, which have clear guidelines to explain the standard of achievement for each grade.\n\nFor Cambridge recognition and acceptance, see:\n\nhttp://www.cambridgeinternational.org/programmes-and-qualifications/recognition-and-acceptance/\n\nMy journey at CMS Cambridge started as a shy 12 year old, hesitant to come out of her shell, unsure of whether the world will have a place for her or not. It's been nearly 8 years ever since and, to say the least, the person on this side of the voyage never rejects or fails to seize an opportunity to become a part of something bigger than herself. I was fortunate enough to, at a very crucial age, find peers one can rely on even after we went our separate ways, and teachers who would guide us beyond the curriculums and the classrooms. Stepping into the real world is nothing like what they tell you - it's a wave of unfathomable, overwhelming emotions all at once. However, if I was asked to, I could circle down each step of the way that laid down the foundation for the person I've grown up to be. This fine institution has given me people I can rely on regardless of the distance, mentors who I can always come back to, memories and life lessons that are unforgettable."
