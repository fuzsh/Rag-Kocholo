        "text": "It was 1965 when Anoka-Ramsey Community College enrolled its first students in college. Today, more than 150,000 people have attended courses at the college that has grown to two full campuses in Coon Rapids and Cambridge and ten off-campus locations. Courses range from short-term training/certificate programs to two-year, four-year and graduate degrees. Meeting the needs of the citizens of Coon Rapids and surrounding communities remains top priority as the college constantly adjusts its strategic plan.\n\nEconomic Impact - Wellspring of Higher Learning, Innovation, Culture\n\nThere is a strong, long-standing relationship between Anoka-Ramsey Community College and the residents of Coon Rapids, city officials, business leaders and Anoka-Hennepin School District employees. In fact, more than 3,600 Anoka-Ramsey alumni reside in Coon Rapids today. According to Wilder Research, the College’s Coon Rapids Campus alone adds an estimated $106,204,084 per year to the local economy. Part of this impact is a multi-faceted connection to the labor market including training and employing local residents; college and student spending creates jobs; many students work part-time while going to school; and some students stay in the local area after completing their studies.\n\nAll academic offerings at Anoka-Ramsey are fully accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. This is the same accrediting body for many public and private colleges and universities in several states across the country. All Anoka-Ramsey faculty have master’s or doctoral degrees in their instructional fields, and are held in high esteem across partnering institutions.\n\nAnoka-Ramsey Community College is also a highly regarded hub for cultural activities including the visiting authors Two Rivers Reading series, theatre performances, art exhibits and sales, chorale, concert and jazz band performances, and more. In addition, civic and service learning initiatives allow faculty and students to be active in the community by volunteering in local events and community programs. College clubs, intramural sports and collegiate athletics – including baseball, basketball, volleyball, soccer, fastpitch softball – rounds out a full complement of offerings.\n\nTo meet the needs of each individual at their desired point of entry into college, there is a lifelong commitment to learning at Anoka-Ramsey."
