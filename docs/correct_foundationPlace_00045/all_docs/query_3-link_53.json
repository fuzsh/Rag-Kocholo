In addition, BrandEd will explore launching additional education programs in existing and new locations in association with other brands under the aegis of Condé Nast such as Vogue, Wired, Architectural Digest, and The World of Interiors.\n\nThe transaction expands BrandEd’s portfolio of world-class academic programs with iconic brands, including Sotheby’s Institute of Art, The School of The New York Times, and City Football Leadership Institute (in partnership with City Football Group which owns Manchester City Football Club).\n\nBrandEd has been operating for two decades starting with the acquisition of the London campus of Sotheby’s Institute of Art in 2003. Today, BrandEd delivers relevant, practical education taught by industry leaders from the world’s best brands.

We are also excited to build new schools and programs by leveraging the unmatched portfolio of brands within Condé Nast, including Vogue, Wired, Architectural Digest and The World of Interiors.”\n\n“Driven by our core values, Condé Nast is dedicated to cultivating the next generation of creatives and journalists,” said Christiane Mack, Chief Content Operations Officer at Condé Nast. “BrandEd will help expand that commitment, connecting Condé Nast’s best-in-class community of talent with current and aspiring students in fashion, design, business, media and technology. I’m confident that together we can inspire the next generation of industry professionals and equip them to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow.”\n\nThrough its success in operating Sotheby’s Institute of Art, The School of The New York Times, and City Football Leadership Institute, BrandEd has helped expand three of the most culturally relevant brands in the world into competitive educational programs. In its role, BrandEd has developed a core set of competencies in the education sector, from brand stewardship to managing campuses, building online curricula and marketing the most innovative courses for students.\n\nWith the Condé Nast College of Fashion and Design, BrandEd aims to replicate this pattern of success by expanding course offerings and enhancing the value of experiences offered across its campuses. Chung noted that BrandEd is already looking at curriculum enhancements through the influx of state-of-the-art technologies and advancements in sustainable fashion and design as well as targeting new demographics.\n\nEstablished in April 2013 and based in London, Madrid and Mexico City, the Condé Nast College of Fashion and Design provides a world-class fashion education across numerous areas including styling, journalism, marketing, branding, graphic design, PR, and digital strategy.
