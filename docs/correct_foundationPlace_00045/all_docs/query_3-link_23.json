        "text": "Cambridge, city, Middlesex county, eastern Massachusetts, U.S., situated on the north bank of the Charles River, partly opposite Boston. Originally settled as New Towne in 1630 by the Massachusetts Bay Company, it was organized as a town in 1636 when it became the site of Harvard College (now an undergraduate school of Harvard University). The town was renamed for Cambridge, England, in 1638 and became a county seat in 1643. The old part of Cambridge (around Harvard Square) is regarded as a symbol of American culture and history. It was there that the general synods of the New England churches met in 1637 and 1647 to settle disputed points of doctrine and from there that the clergyman Thomas Hooker’s congregation departed for Connecticut in 1636. At the outbreak of the American Revolution, the first revolutionary army camped at what is now Cambridge Common, where George Washington assumed leadership of the Continental forces on July 3, 1775. The first Massachusetts Constitutional Convention met in Cambridge in 1779–80.\n\nEarly industrial development was slow. Stephen Day (Daye) set up the first printing press in the British colonies at Cambridge in 1638 (forerunner of the city’s modern publishing and printing industry), and the first books to be printed in America came from this press. After completion (1912) of subway connections to Boston, the city experienced rapid industrial expansion. Most manufacturing industries had declined in importance by the late 20th century, but they were replaced by firms developing computer software, electronics, and biotechnology. Photographic equipment and other light manufactures are produced, but services predominate. Institutes of higher education are the largest employers.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nHistorical USA\n\nScientific and industrial research is stimulated by the presence of Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (founded in Boston in 1861 and moved to Cambridge in 1916). Cambridge is also the seat of Radcliffe College (1879; now integrated with Harvard), Lesley University (1909), and the Episcopal Divinity School (1867). The headquarters of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, formerly in Washington, D.C., was moved to Cambridge in 1955; it is now part of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.\n\nCambridge has been home to many notable people, and its Mount Auburn Cemetery contains the graves of the poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow; the poet-diplomat James Russell Lowell; the physician-author Oliver Wendell Holmes; Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of Christian Science; and the actor Edwin Booth. The Longfellow House (built 1759) served as Washington’s headquarters (1775–76), was Longfellow’s home (1837–82), and has been designated Longfellow National Historic Site."
