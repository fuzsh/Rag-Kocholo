        "text": "We have updated this media studies syllabus as part of a wider review of Cambridge International AS & A Level and made some changes in line with the feedback we received from teachers, subject expert panels and universities. The updated syllabus is for examination in 2022, 2022 and 2023.\n\nHow has the syllabus changed?\n\nWe have added a subject content section to make it clearer what needs to be taught. This details skills and understanding relevant to the whole course, as well as showing what should be studied at AS Level and at A Level.\n\nFor the first time, we have included a list of key concepts to deepen students' understanding. These are essential ideas, theories, principles or mental tools that help learners to develop a deep understanding and to make links and connections across the subject:\n\nLanguage.\n\nRepresentation.\n\nIndustry.\n\nAudience.\n\nWe have added a list of command words and their meanings to help learners know what’s expected of them in the exam.\n\nHow has the assessment changed?\n\nThe assessment objectives (AOs) have been revised and updated and the weightings changed.\n\nComponent: 1 Foundation Portfolio:\n\nThe number of marks available in Component 1 has changed to 50 marks.\n\nCollaborative work has been removed: creative critical reflection must be produced and presented individually.\n\nComponent 2: Media texts and contexts:\n\nThe number of marks available in Component 2 has changed to 50 marks.\n\nIn Section A of Component 2 the TV Drama is no longer limited to being American.\n\nComponent 3: Advanced Portfolio:\n\nThe number of marks available in Component 3 has changed to 50 marks.\n\nThe Creative critical reflection section has been replaced with an essay of around 1000 words (including guiding questions) focusing on evaluation of the Component 3 process and outcome.\n\nComponent 4: Critical Perspectives:\n\nThe number of marks available in Component 4 has changed to 60 marks.\n\nSection A is no longer an evaluation of the candidate’s own work in the Foundation Portfolio and the Advanced Portfolio. Candidates must now answer two questions from a choice of three focusing on media regulation, postmodern media and power and the media.\n\nSection B is synoptic and now includes one compulsory question.\n\nWhen do these changes take place?\n\nThe updated syllabus is for examination in June and November 2021, 2022 and 2023. Please see the 2021-2023 syllabus above for full details.\n\nComing soon\n\nWe are developing a wide range of support to help you plan and teach the 2021-2023 syllabus.\n\nSupport\n\nLook out for suggested resources and a coursework handbook that will be available from April 2019 onwards through School Support Hub.\n\nEndorsed resources – coming soon\n\nMedia Studies for Cambridge International AS & A Level (Cambridge University Press)\n\nEnable learners to develop a critical understanding of international media as they approach the Cambridge International AS & A Level Media Studies syllabus (9607). Students engage with key topics, from production processes to media regulation, while developing critical thinking and analytical skills. Unpack the pedagogy and get a comprehensive understanding of the assessment through the robust support in the digital teacher’s resource, with a particular focus on guidance for skills development, project-based learning, and differentiation.\n\nRead more on the Cambridge University Press website\n\nFor some subjects, we publish grade descriptions to help understand the level of performance candidates’ grades represent.\n\nWe paused the publication of grade descriptions in response to the Covid-19 pandemic and the temporary changes to the awarding standard in 2020, 2021 and 2022.\n\nAs the awarding standard has now returned to the pre-pandemic standard, we are working to produce up-to-date grade descriptions for most of our general qualifications. These will be based on the awarding standards in place from June 2023 onwards."
