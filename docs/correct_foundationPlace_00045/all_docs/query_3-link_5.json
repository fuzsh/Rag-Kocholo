        "text": "Oracle agreed on Tuesday to buy the Art Technology Group, an e-commerce software provider, for about $1 billion.\n\nOracle will pay $6 a share in cash, 46 percent more than Art Technology’s closing stock price on Monday. It is the first deal that Oracle has announced since it hired Mark V. Hurd, the deal-making former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, as co-president in September.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Art Technology posted $4.2 million in profit on $50.3 million in revenue for the third quarter, up substantially from a year earlier.\n\nArt Technology, based in Cambridge, Mass., makes e-commerce products like customer analysis software and Internet-based calling solutions. The two companies said that Art Technology’s platform would complement Oracle’s customer relationship management and retail products.\n\nThe deal is expected to close early next year, pending approval of Art Technology shareholders.\n\nShares of Art Technology rose $1.85, or 45 percent, to $5.95. Shares of Oracle, which is based in Redwood City, Calif., rose 40 cents, to $29.53."
