        "text": "SXSL hosted panel discussions throughout the day that explored how leaders in art, technology, food, innovation, and social change are helping to move the country forward. Interactive booths gave attendees a hands-on opportunity to engage with and learn about new products and types of content that are transforming how we interact with our world.\n\nBreakfast Session at the Newseum\n\nHard Things are Hard: A Conversation with James Turrell and David Adjaye (Newseum)\n\nWatch the conversation on Youtube\n\nOn the President’s desk there’s a plaque that reads, “Hard things are hard.” For artist James Turrell and architect David Adjaye, taking on the hard work has motivated them to push physical limits, build audacious structures, and consistently challenge the standards of art and architecture. For over half a century, Turrell has worked with light and space to create works that challenge the limits of human perception. Since the late 1970s, he has been working on Roden Crater, a large-scale artwork created within a volcanic cinder cone in Northern Arizona. Adjaye, has designed innovative structures around the world including to London’s Rivington Place, the Nobel Peace Center in Norway, and D.C’s newest landmark, the National Museum of African American History and Culture. To kick-off SXSL, in a conversation moderated by LACMA's Michael Govan, Turrell and Adjaye discussed challenges and rewards of taking on the “hard things” through their groundbreaking projects. This event was hosted at the Newseum, in collaboration with Events DC.\n\nAfternoon Session on the South Lawn\n\nFixing Real Problems\n\nHow can we harness technology to solve our biggest, most stubborn problems?\n\nWatch the conversation on Youtube\n\nAt South by Southwest® earlier this year, President Obama called on the tech community to focus its attention on making America and the world more tolerant, fair, healthy, and full of opportunities. This panel explored the work of entrepreneurs and social innovators who are leveraging new technologies to address some of our most critical challenges—and asked you to think about how you might lend your own time and efforts toward lasting change.\n\nModerator\n\nJenna Wortham, staff writer for The New York Times Magazine\n\nPanelists\n\nStewart Butterfield, co-founder and CEO of Slack\n\nJukay Hsu, founder of Coalition for Queens (C4Q)\n\nChris Redlitz, managing partner of Transmedia Capital\n\nNina Tandon, co-founder and CEO of EpiBone\n\nLearn more about the Fixing Real Problems panel here.\n\nAfternoon Session on the South Lawn\n\nFeeding the Future\n\nHow will we sustainably feed ourselves in the coming decades?\n\nWatch the conversation on Youtube\n\nBallooning populations, evolving diets, and a changing climate present serious obstacles to our future food supply. This panel introduced us to some of the people leading the charge to make food more accessible, sustainable, and healthy, and explored the role you can play to best prepare for the future of food in your own community.\n\nModerator\n\nDanielle Gould, founder of Food+Tech Connect\n\nPanelists\n\nWill Allen, farmer, founder and CEO of Growing Power\n\nMaria Rose Belding, co-founder and executive director of the MEANS Database\n\nCaleb Harper, principal investigator and director of the Open Agriculture Initiative (OpenAG) at the MIT Media Lab\n\nNikiko Masumoto, organic farmer and agrarian artist\n\nLearn more about the Feeding the Future panel here.\n\nAfternoon Session on the South Lawn\n\nLA, a Case Study in Innovation\n\nHow do we foster innovation and collaboration in cities and local communities?\n\nWatch the conversation on Youtube\n\nLos Angeles offers some good lessons. While the city owes part of its dynamism to the growing presence of new tech and media firms, its progress has been driven by leaders in non-profits, government, and social innovation working together to brighten the future for the City of Angels. Watch the panel to find out how they’re doing it, and get inspired to improve the dynamism and resilience in the community where you live.\n\nModerator\n\nJonathan Gold, Los Angeles Times\n\nPanelists\n\nYael Aflalo, founder and CEO of Reformation\n\nKrisztina 'Z' Holly, Chief Instigator of the MAKE IT IN LA initiative\n\nOscar Menjivar, founder and CEO of URBAN Teens eXploring Technology (URBAN TxT)\n\nBrian Mullins, founder and CEO of DAQRI\n\nLearn more about the LA, a Case Study in Innovation panel here.\n\nAfternoon Session on the South Lawn\n\nHow We Make Change\n\nWhat role do citizens have in bringing real and lasting change to our country?\n\nWatch the conversation on Youtube\n\n\"America is not the project of any one person,\" President Obama said in Selma last year. “The single-most powerful word in our democracy is the word ‘We.’” Indeed, unelected citizens seeking change—people channeling the power of \"We\"—have been behind some of the biggest social and economic movements of the past eight years, from achieving landmark victories in the struggle for LGBT rights to shining a new light on the enduring struggle for civil rights. These agents of change have transformed hashtags into movements and delivered real progress in our society. Find out how they did it, and what you can do to bring about the change you want to see in the world.\n\nIntroducer\n\nThe Honorable John Lewis, congressman and civil rights icon\n\nModerator\n\nAnil Dash, entrepreneur and activist\n\nPanelists\n\nBrittany Packnett, Vice President of National Community Alliances at Teach For America and co-founder of Campaign Zero\n\nCarmen Rojas, CEO of The Workers Lab\n\nEvan Wolfson, founder and president of Freedom to Marry\n\nLearn more about the How We Make Change panel here.\n\n6'x9'\n\nLearn firsthand what it’s like to be locked up in solitary confinement in this virtual reality experience that places the viewer inside a 6-foot by 9-foot cell with little more than a bed and toilet. In the 9-minute experience, people can witness the psychological impacts of confinement like blurred vision, hallucinations, and a sense of floating that may occur after long-term sensory deprivation. The innovative documentary, conceived by The Guardian and created in collaboration with The Mill, was generated using game engine technology, using first person accounts as reference for both the cell design and spatial audio capture.\n\nCancer Moonshot: SXSL\n\nAt the Cancer Moonshoot booth, visitors were able to interact with technology and experience the future of cancer care, share how they’ve been affected by cancer as part of a compiled video diary, and learn about volunteer opportunities in their communities. Visitors engaged with an Internet of Things experience that shows how wearable technology could enable greater collaboration between cancer patients, physicians, and scientists to improve cancer care delivery.\n\nChuck Close: Large Format Polaroid Portraits\n\nChuck Close, President’s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities member, is best known for his large-scale, photo based portrait paintings. He is also an accomplished printmaker and photographer whose work has been the subject of more than 200 solo exhibitions in more than 20 countries, including major retrospective exhibitions at New York's Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and most recently at The State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia. At South by South Lawn, Chuck captured life-size portraits using a 20-by-24-inch Polaroid camera.\n\nDavid Garibaldi: Art with Passion and Purpose\n\nFew modern artists have the ability to transform a blank canvas into an arresting creative work like David Garibaldi. Hailing from Sacramento, David turned his passion for graffiti into an explosive career by mixing the creative elements of street art and popular music and culture into a riveting painting performance in which he can create life-size portraits within 6 minutes. A finalist on America’s Got Talent, David performs at shows across the country, including at events like the NBA Finals and several award shows. To him, every performance is an opportunity to give back, either through teaching young people to explore their talents or through providing resources and support to the community.\n\n#FacesofFounders\n\n#FacesofFounders celebrates the millions of diverse entrepreneurs in America. Startup culture tells us that anyone can bring forward the next big idea. Yet, all too often women entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs of color are left on the sidelines. The Case Foundation, the Blackstone Charitable Foundation, Google for Entrepreneurs, UBS and Fast Company invited visitors get their special SXSL photo snapped and join the movement for a more inclusive approach to entrepreneurship.\n\nFind Your Park Machine\n\nThe National Park Foundation has a new way to inspire the youngest generation of innovators to find their park. As part of the National Park Service’s Centennial celebration and the Find Your Park/Encuentra Tu Parque movement, the Find Your Park Machine is a digital wayfinding sign that gives visitors the opportunity to experience all of America’s 400+ national parks in 60 seconds using audio, visual, and geo-location elements.\n\nFood + Future\n\nFood + Future is a group of entrepreneurs, based in Cambridge, MA, that is exploring the future of food, solving major food challenges, and building food-related businesses. At SXSL, the team—a collaboration between Target, IDEO, and MIT Media Lab—will showcase cutting-edge technologies that are helping people understand more about their food. The interactive space will feature three initiatives. POLY helps kids understand where their food comes from through fun, interactive classroom experiments. Illuminate helps individuals and companies understand exactly what they are selling and buying -- and how their choices will personally impact people. The Open Agriculture initiative helps farmers of all size understand the science of their environment in order to help them create healthier, more sustainable food systems.\n\nInvestigating Normal: Design for Every Body\n\nSara Hendren and the Adaption + Ability Group at Olin College gave visitors an immersive, interactive, and surprising look at technologies for human ability, disability, and body variation. From things you wear to the environments you live in, this large-scale installation invites people to test the basic assumptions we make about what counts as normal. Whether its ramps for skateboarders and wheelchair users, furniture for unusually short stature, or customized prosthetic limbs, visitors investigated the designs that have helped and hindered atypical bodies.\n\nJustice For Us\n\nThrough the signature Justicefor.us digital experience, visitors will be able to take an empathy-inducing look into the system through the eyes of those most entrenched in it. At SXSL, visitors participated in an interactive story-game that allowed them to step into the shoes of a judge and make decisions that directly affect the lives of individuals and our society at large.\n\nOpen Your Eyes\n\nMTV’s Open Your Eyes, an art show taking place entirely in virtual reality, features artists and young people creating 3D immersive visualizations of their personal takes on issues including gun violence, climate change, and immigration, among others. The audience were able to watch an artist create art in front of their eyes; step inside and around the virtual artifacts; and even don a headset and create their own issue-themed art.\n\nAll of the art was created by the artists using Google’s Tilt Brush, a painting application built for virtual reality platforms. Tilt Brush allows users to paint in 3D space, encouraging an entirely new style of expression and establishing a new medium for creation.\n\nPark People by Nathan Sawaya\n\nThe White House South Lawn also happens to be a National Park. So as SXSL visitors toured the grounds, they saw some original art work from Nathan Sawaya, an award-winning artist who creates inventive works of art from LEGO® bricks, including painstakingly crafted, life-size scale LEGO sculptures resting on the park benches that dot the South Lawn.\n\nPresident Obama + Yosemite in 3D\n\nThrough the Ages: President Obama celebrates America’s National Parks transports you on a journey to Yosemite with President Obama as he honors the legacy of our country’s national parks. This first-ever virtual reality experience featuring a sitting president provides an up-close-and-personal look at President Obama’s trip to Yosemite with his family over Father’s Day weekend this year. Visitors could hear from President Obama firsthand as he reflects on the importance of conservation and combating climate change while you explore every angle of the breathtaking surroundings, including El Capitan, the Cathedral Rocks, Mariposa Grove, Yosemite Falls and the Merced River.\n\nRound Robots\n\nThis interactive booth, run collaboratively by Black Girls CODE and Sphero, gave participants the opportunity to paint, program, and play with round robots. The hands-on experience brought coding to life while showcasing how fun it is to learn the fundamentals of computer science.\n\nSoldering Station\n\nFrom the early days of the Homebrew Computer Club to our modern-day wearables, knowing how to connect the dots on electronic boards is a foundational skill for our digital age. To empower even more people with the tools of maker and hands-on computer science, attendees joined Nick Cannon and the team from RadioShack to learn firsthand how to solder and build maker projects.\n\nStartup in the White House\n\nThe U.S. Digital Service and the Presidential Innovation Fellows program are bringing top technologists into the federal government to tackle our nation's most important challenges. From modernizing our immigration system, to improving our veterans' access to benefits, to increasing access to cancer clinical trials, these teams are using design and technology to build a more awesome government for all Americans. Visitors could meet the team on the South Lawn to see demos of their work and learn how we can all help bring public service into the 21st century.\n\nSeed to Stove\n\nAttendees had the opportunity to both see and taste the whole food cycle like never before with the celebrated Chef José Andrés and Bill Yosses. Guests will taste food picked fresh Green Bronx Machine’s tower aeroponic systems and prepared by Bill Yosses. They could see how efficient, sustainable and affordable clean cooking technologies can meet the needs of people around the world through clean cookstove demonstrations led by Chef José Andrés.\n\nTattly: Art You Can Wear\n\nTattly Temporary Tattoos invited artists Karen Steinecke, Hayden Davis and Dirty Bandits (Annica Lydenberg) to create custom artwork for limited edition Custom Tattly to be applied on guests at SXSL.

Attendees had access to the latest information on wearables like DAQRI Smart Helmet™, next-generation phase modulator displays, and cutting-edge computer vision products, delivering on the DAQRI promise to bring AR everywhere.\n\nSXSL Social Media Activated Sign\n\nCreated by Adam Savage with a team of maker spaces in Baltimore, the SXSL sign physically embodies the interactive nature of the whole event. The seven-feet tall letters are internally illuminated with LEDs that respond to social media activity throughout the day.\n\nTo-Do Note Installation\n\nThere is still a lot of work left to do and, with the help of a sticky-note installation designed by Illegal Art, a collective of artists whose goal is to create participatory-based public art, attendees can jot down the actions that they will take after South By South Lawn to continue to make a positive impact in their community, in the country, or the world. This installation of To-Do was made possible by the generosity and expertise of IDEO.\n\nThe Up Next Lounge\n\nThe Up Next lounge provided a place for SXSL attendees to relax and charge their devices, while also highlighting its mobile messaging platform, the Better Make Room campaign, and First Lady Michelle Obama’s \"Reach Higher\" initiative. Up Next provides high school and college students and college graduates with information, encouragement, and assistance with college applications, financial aid, and loan repayment. Visitors to the Up Next lounge got to immerse in the Up Next messaging experience. They will be able to interact with the message flows that students are receiving this fall; create motivational messages and images to send to students in their schools and communities; and see how Up Next texting technology provides real-time, one-on-one college and financial aid advising from an Up Next advisor.\n\nUpstanders\n\nThe Starbucks Upstanders Booth offered an interactive experience to inspire attendees by sharing stories of ordinary people doing extraordinary things to create positive change in their communities.
