        "text": "The Conservatory of Theatre Arts in the School of the Arts at Purchase College offers intensive, highly focused BFA training programs in acting and theatre design/technology for a limited number of students who seek to pursue professional careers in these fields. The theatre and performance BA program is for those interested in exploring the history and aesthetics of world drama and performance and the possibilities of theatrical expression—as performers, directors, and playwrights—within a broader liberal arts context.\n\nCitizen Artists\n\nOur goal is to foster the development of multifaceted artists with a strong sense of purpose in approaching their education and craft. You’ll discover what motivates you. You’ll understand the art form’s place in history. And you’ll explore what you are here to say and do and make.\n\nYou’ll do this exploration in the company of a diverse and tight-knit community of open-minded students as part of the entire Purchase experience.\n\nDiscover how your unique voice can contribute to our world.\n\nWhat Makes Us Unique\n\nAs one of five schools in the Consortium of Professional Theatre Training Programs, Purchase is one of a handful of colleges in the world capable of training artists at this level—and of drawing a faculty from the ranks of professional theatre.\n\nAnd because Purchase is located so close to New York City, you’ll have easy access to some of the best theatrical venues and production facilities in the country.\n\nThe Performing Arts Center\n\nUnique to Purchase College is The Performing Arts Center of Purchase College, a significant regional arts venue that not only attracts national and international performers to the Purchase College campus, but also serves as the central laboratory, classroom and performance and presentation space for Conservatory of Theatre Arts students.\n\nThe Center for Media, Film, and Theatre\n\nThe newly-constructed Center for Media, Film, and Theatre opened in the Fall of 2019. This state of the art facility provides a multitude of workshops, labs, and classroom spaces to promote integration and collaboration between the Conservatory of Theatre Arts, the School of Film and Media Studies, and other arts-related programs.\n\nCampus Culture\n\nThe coming together of arts and liberal arts and science students at Purchase College creates a campus culture like no other. You’ll not only receive world-class conservatory training but the opportunity to engage and collaborate with a broader artistic and intellectual campus community."
