STANTON AVERY DISTINGUISHED FELLOW\n\nSusan Scott Parrish, Professor, English, University of Michigan\n\nTopic: The Talking Woods: Black American Life and Its Forest Materials\n\nScotti Parrish is Arthur F. Thurnau Professor in the English Department and the Program in the Environment at the University of Michigan. Since the 1990s, she has been researching and teaching about the intertwined history of environmental transformation and racial formation in North America, with an ongoing focus on the southern plantation complex. In her first book, American Curiosity: Cultures of Natural History in the Colonial British Atlantic World (UNCP, 2006), she analyzed how English colonials, Native Americans, and captive Africans responded to their environmental dislocations in the Americas, and to colonization and slavery, through their interactions with—and knowledge about—the natural world. Her next book continued to examine how American environments and racialized experiences were mutually constituted. The Flood Year 1927: A Cultural History (Princeton UP, 2017) investigated how a massive infrastructural catastrophe in the Lower Mississippi Valley unfolded, and took on divergent meanings, as it moved across media platforms, across sectional divides, and across the color line. More recently, she has edited The Cambridge Companion to American Literature and Environment and the Norton Critical Edition of Faulkner’s Absalom, Absalom! Prompted by contemporary Black artists now reimagining historical Black experiences in U.S. woodlands, she is researching her next book: The Talking Woods: Black American Life and Its Forest Materials. She has received support from the American Antiquarian Society, the NEH, the Charles Warren Center for Studies in American History, and UM’s Institute for the Humanities.\n\nFLETCHER JONES FOUNDATION DISTINGUISHED FELLOW\n\nSusan Amussen, Professor, History, UC Merced\n\nTopic: Placing Patriarchy in Early Modern Britain and its Empire\n\nSusan D.

The project she’ll be at work on at the Huntington is a group biography, The Stunning Gunnings: Two Generations of Enterprising Eighteenth- and Nineteenth-Century British Women Who Riveted the Public and Transformed Troubled Lives into Bestselling Fiction.\n\nNEH FELLOWS\n\nTara Lyons, Associate Professor, English, Illinois State University\n\nTopic: Her Books: Women’s Libraries in an Age of Rebellion (1640-1660)\n\nTara L. Lyons is a professor of English at Illinois State University where she teaches early modern English literature, bibliography, and Shakespeare. Dr. Lyons’ research delves into newly uncovered sources that document women’s books and libraries in the British Isles and colonies from 1640 to 1660. In this period, women’s libraries were conceptualized as contained domestic spaces, protected from ongoing military conflicts, political uprisings, and colonial violence. However, documentary evidence from this period reveals that women’s libraries became targets of disorder and violence. Lyons’ research demonstrates how these libraries were affected and how women’s books, literally and figuratively, fueled the fires of the age. By interrogating what we know about women’s libraries, how such knowledge was obscured, and how we can continue to uncover it, Lyons’ project offers well-plied feminist historiographical practices from which richer histories of “her books” can emerge. Lyons’ scholarship on bibliography and early modern literature has been published in Shakespeare Quarterly, PBSA, ELR, Philological Quarterly, and a number of edited collections. Her work has been supported by grants from the Folger and Bodleian Libraries, and she is the Katharine Pantzer Senior Fellow in the British Book Trades for 2024-2025, awarded by the Bibliographical Society of America.\n\nSHAPIRO CENTER FOR AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE FELLOW\n\nAlison Hirsch, Associate Professor, Architecture, University of Southern California\n\nTopic: The Other California: Land, Loss, Labor, and Liberated Futures Along Phantom Shores\n\nAlison B. Hirsch is a landscape historian and designer. She is Associate Professor in the USC School of Architecture and Director/Founder of the Landscape Justice Initiative. Dr. Hirsch was the 2017-2018 Prince Charitable Trusts/Rolland Rome Prize Fellow at the American Academy in Rome and directed the Landscape Architecture + Urbanism program at USC from 2019 to 2023. Author of books and publications primarily on urban landscapes and spatial politics, Alison’s fellowship year at the Huntington Library will be focused on a forthcoming book, titled The Other California: land, labor, and liberated futures along phantom shores, that builds on five years of action research in design, planning, and community history work in the Tulare Lake Basin, the lower third of the Great Central Valley. After fourteen atmospheric rivers hit California in March 2023, as another expression of climate whiplash, Tulare Lake remerged, provoking new imaginaries for the future of its existence and the existence of those who call the lake home. Materially and culturally shaped by the geographic condition of this endorheic basin and its disappeared lake that haunts the land by its periodic reemergence, this narrative is a cultural and environmental history of violence and vast inequality created by 150 years of capitalist agriculture, as well as a story of resistance and how land-based practices of insurgent cultural expression have set the foundation for liberated futures. As a landscape historian and landscape designer, Alison will tell this story as a record of human relations to the uniqueness of this physical landscape and a guide on how to support radical change at a pressing moment, as well as provide broader visibility to processes of land loss, structural violence, critical forms of land-based cultural resistance, and methods of repair that have created conditions for the implementation of more just futures.\n\nBARBARA THOM POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWS\n\nChristine Garnier, Fellow, History of Art/Architecture, University of Southern California\n\nTopic: The American Silverscape: Art, Land, and Extraction\n\nChristine Garnier is an art historian of modern and contemporary North America. Her research investigates how objects recalibrate power relations between Indigenous and settler artists to reveal histories of extraction, transcultural circulation, and ecologies throughout the American West. She holds a Ph.D. from Harvard University and was previously a Postdoctoral Fellow in the USC Society of Fellows in the Humanities. At the Huntington, Dr. Garnier will continue to revise her first book manuscript, “The American Silverscape: Art, Land, and Extraction (1848–1905).” This project explores how nineteenth-century silver artworks became flashpoints in debates over land use, natural resources, and Indigenous sovereignty in the United States. A range of silver artworks—presentation vases, exposition monuments, peace medals, soup tureens, and squash blossom necklaces—are resituated within place-based histories of extraction to demonstrate how objects relayed Indigenous protest to land seizure. Short essays on contemporary artworks between historical chapters reveal the legacies of extraction that extend far beyond silver’s decorative forms. By focusing on intersecting histories of aesthetics, ecologies, politics, and value, “The American Silverscape” proposes an art history particular to the mineral foundations of the American West.\n\nBARBARA THOM POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWS\n\nLaura Nelson, Fellow, Humanities, University of Southern California\n\nTopic: After School: Radical Experiments in Education and Collective Life\n\nLaura Nelson has a Ph.D. in American Studies from Harvard University and a M.St. in Literature from Oxford University, where she studied on a Rhodes Scholarship.

Over the past seven years, Laura has taught courses on literature, film, cultural history, and education at Harvard, Deep Springs College, and Tidelines Institute. Alongside teaching and research, she organizes experimental spaces of gathering and learning in cities and has been a part of collective projects including the Library of Study, the Oakland Summer School, and Place Settings.\n\nBARBARA THOM POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWS\n\nDominique Polanco, Assistant Professor, Religion and Culture, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University\n\nTopic: Copying the Colony: The Pintura del gobernadora, alcaldes y regidores de México’s Many Editions\n\nDominique E. Polanco is an assistant professor in the Department of Religion and Culture at Virginia Tech. She is an art historian of Indigenous visual and material culture in Abya Yala. She specializes in amoxtli (books or manuscripts) created by Nahua tlacuiloque (artist-scribes) in sixteenth-century New Spain (colonial Mexico). At the Huntington Library, she will complete revisions for her first monograph tentatively titled Copying the Colony: The Pintura del gobernador, alcaldes y regidores de México’s Many Editions. In it she explores the production, collection, display, and reproduction of the Pintura del gobernador, alcaldes y regidores de México that was completed in 1565. She has published in Latin American and Latinx Visual Culture and along with Nicholas R. Jones and Christina H. Lee, Dr. Polanco is co-editor of the Routledge Companion to Race in the Early Modern Artistic, Material, and Visual Production (forthcoming 2025). Her research has been supported by numerous fellowships and institutions, most recently by the Bibliographical Society of America-Pine Tree Foundation of New York and the Society for the History of Authorship, Reading, and Publishing. Dr. Polanco earned her PhD in Art History from the University of Arizona and her MA in Art History at UC Riverside. She is thrilled to return to where she was born and raised for her fellowship, on the ancestral lands of the Gabrieleno/Tongva Nation (part of which is now known as the San Gabriel Valley).\n\nOCCIDENTAL/BILLINGTON VISITING PROFESSOR IN U.S. HISTORY\n\nDamon Akins, Professor, History, Guilford College\n\nTopic: Las Californias: A Brief History Beyond the Missions, 1821-54\n\nDamon Akins is Lincoln Financial Professor of History at Guilford College. He writes and teaches about the history of Indigenous People, settler colonialism, California, and the American West. His current book project is a history of Alta and Baja California during the Mexican period which challenges the emphasis historians have often placed on the struggle between the missions and the Californios. Instead, it takes a place-based spatial history approach to attempt to capture the lived experiences of the diverse Indigenous peoples who constituted the vast majority of the people who lived in the Californias at that time. He is the co-author, with William J. Bauer, Jr., of We Are the Land: A History of Native California (California, 2021).\n\nFLETCHER JONES FOUNDATION FELLOW IN THE HUNTINGTON-UC PROGRAM FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE HUMANITIES\n\nAlex Mazzaferro, Assistant Professor, English, UCLA\n\nTopic: The Innovation Prohibition and the New Science of Politics in Colonial America\n\nAlexander Mazzaferro is the 2024-2025 Fletcher Jones Foundation Fellow in The Huntington-UC Program for the Advancement of the Humanities. He specializes in colonial American and early U.S. literatures, at the intersection of the history of political thought and the history of science. He is currently at work on a book manuscript that rereads New World settler colonialism and the resistance it met in light of the early modern prohibition on innovation, a pejorative seventeenth-century synonym for rebellion and heresy. The book argues that innovation’s increasing allure, within a culture nominally hostile to it, gave rise to a new way of making knowledge about politics: an experiential mode modelled on empirical natural science that was more amenable to improvisation and experiment than prevailing forms of political reasoning. Colonialism helped to transform innovation into a preeminent Western value—but only through a transgressive remaking of existing lifeways and landscapes that gave anticolonial dissidents of various kinds a surprising ethical high ground in the period. While at The Huntington he will also begin researching a second project on the role that key colonizer technologies like books, guns, and compasses played in scripting settler encounters with Native and African people and shaping early ideologies of racial difference. His research has appeared in Early American Literature, J19, and English Language Notes and has been supported by the American Council of Learned Societies, the Mellon Foundation, the American Philosophical Society, and the University of Chicago’s Institute on the Formation of Knowledge.\n\nFLETCHER JONES FOUNDATION FELLOW IN THE HUNTINGTON-UC PROGRAM FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE HUMANITIES\n\nNydia Pineda de Ávila, Assistant Professor, History, UC San Diego\n\nTopic: Creating Celestial and Terrestrial Environments in the Early Californias.\n\nNydia Pineda de Ávila is Assistant Professor in the Department of History, Associate Director of Latin American Studies and core faculty of the Science Studies Program at UC San Diego. Born in Mexico, she studied a BA in French Literature at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México and went on to complete a Masters in Research and a PhD in English at Queen Mary, University of London. She was a post-doctoral fellow in Instituto de Investigaciones Estéticas (UNAM), and has held fellowships at the Linda Hall Library, Università Ca’ Foscari (Venice, Italy), and the John Carter Brown Library, where she co-curated with Thomas Haddad the digital exhibition Constellations: Reimagining Celestial Histories in the Early Americas. Nydia works at the intersection of the History of Science, History of the Book, and Visual Studies and her research broadly interrogates the gap between practice, theory and representation in images of space and time in early modernity. Her work is informed by the study of historical archives and libraries, as well as through practice-based research including engraving, filmmaking and digital humanities. Nydia is also the initiator and coordinator of the international and interdisciplinary documentary project “American Skies”, with members in Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, the U.S, and Italy. As a returning Fletcher Jones Foundation Fellow in the UC-Huntington Program for the Advancement of the Humanities, she will fully revise her book manuscript Paper Moons: the Poetics of Selenography in the Seventeenth Century on the changing values of moon maps as visual experiments, technical instruments and commodities in the early phases of the development of the telescope. She will also develop her second book project that engages with celestial environmental perceptions and representations in the early Californias.\n\nShort-Term\n\nGrace Ali, Assistant Professor, Florida State University\n\nEl Dorado Undone\n\nOne month\n\nKatherine Anania, Assistant Professor, University of Nebraska – Lincoln\n\nDevour Everything: Hemispheric Art After Agriculture\n\nOne month\n\nFrancisca Marcela Andrade Lucena, PhD Candidate, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro/National Museum\n\nImagining Black Agencies in Colonia Cuba Through the Abakuá Society\n\nTwo months\n\nElena Aronova, Associate Professor, UC Santa Barbara\n\nFrom Biological Time to Molecular Clock: Biology and Temporal Imagination from Darwin to Chronobiology\n\nTwo months\n\nRachel Bani, Assistant Professor, Converse College\n\nScottish Gaelic Song and Popular Reaction to the Highland Clearances\n\nOne month\n\nEmma Bartel, Lecturer, Sorbonne Université\n\nThe Art of Meditation in Early Modern England (1550-1700)\n\nThree months\n\nDaria Berman, PhD Candidate, Washington University in St. Louis\n\nMosaic Identities, The Portuguese Conversos in Seventeenth-Century Mexico\n\nFive months\n\nCharlotte Biggs, PhD Candidate, UC Riverside\n\nLas Floridianas: Indigenous Resilience, Gendered Power, and Atlantic Mobility. 1763-1784\n\nOne month\n\nChelsea Bouldin, PhD Candidate, Syracuse University\n\nPink Notebook, Black Interior: Charting Octavia E.
