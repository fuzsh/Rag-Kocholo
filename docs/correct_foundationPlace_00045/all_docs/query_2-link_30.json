        "text": "From opportunity to reality.\n\nAs product and technology consultants we’ve helped ambitious clients to navigate complexity and achieve commercial success by developing market-leading products and technologies – from concept to manufacture – for over 35 years.\n\n▪ Deep Tech We deliver state-of-the-art solutions for companies across a broad range of sectors, including energy, industrial facilities, telecoms, advanced manufacturing, and autonomous and connected devices.\n\n▪ Healthcare Healthcare is moving from hospital to clinic to home. New treatments are becoming decentralised and more personalised, making the need for high-tech, user-centric, data-enabled solutions greater than ever.\n\n▪ Life Science Building on a long track record in life science instrumentation, we routinely design systems capable of meeting demanding biological and physical hardware requirements.\n\n“\n\nTTP has a world-class reputation for excellence in developing highly complex instrumentation effectively. Their multi-disciplinary team are highly experienced and were able to deliver in a variety of areas from optics to fluidics, from software to systems integration, very quickly. This, coupled with their commercial acumen and drive to bring our idea to reality, made them our ideal partner.\n\n“\n\nTTP has been an incredible partner, complementing our expertise and delivering designs from whiteboard to moulded functional prototypes. With TTP’s support, Achilles Therapeutics is scaling its manufacturing process and bringing transformative therapies from bench to bedside. The TTP team has shown the same level of excitement as us in getting these therapies to the people who need them.\n\n“\n\nWe engaged TTP to help us with the clinical translation of a novel neural interface technology towards first in human trials. Their insights into the full medical device development process, combined with their strong understanding of technology and market, made a real difference. It was a great pleasure learning from their team and their work has helped us progress this technology into the next phase of commercialisation.\n\n“\n\nVeripos selected TTP as a development partner because of their track record in product development and the confidence we gained in their ability to deliver during pre-contract negotiations. TTP were instrumental in achieving our goal, working closely with the VERIPOS team throughout the development, and providing support following transfer to production.\n\n“\n\nThe team at TTP has done a fantastic job expediting the journey to commercialisation of our prototype. We are excited about the potential for Seracam to improve patients’ lives."
