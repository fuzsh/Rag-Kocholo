        "text": "APH: Abacus Bee\n\nFriendly contest enabling students with vision loss to gain math skills while working alongside their peers.\n\nEstablished in 1858 in Louisville, Kentucky, APH is the world’s largest nonprofit organization creating accessible products and programs designed to support the educational, workplace and independent living needs of people who are blind or visually impaired. Though APH serves people of all ages, APH remains exceptionally committed to the educational needs of children in grades K–12.\n\nHistorically and currently, people with vision loss are not perceived as individuals who have an interest in science and technology, nor an inclination to pursue educational opportunities or employment in STEM fields. APH believes this to be counterintuitive to APH’s own experience in engaging with this community. They seek to ensure that students with vision loss can contribute to the STEM discussion along with their sighted peers, while learning and growing, both personally and professionally.\n\nIn 2022, APH is bringing math-oriented skill development and material awareness sessions to the forefront. A large part of this effort is a new initiative: the APH Abacus Bee. The Bee will be a friendly contest, with the goal of enabling students with vision loss to gain math skills while working alongside their peers.\n\nAbacus training is a critical tool for children with vision loss. APH plans for the Abacus Bee to become an annual event that will help to level the STEM playing field for children who are blind or visually impaired.\n\nMore\n\nART±BIO Collaborative\n\nIntegrating art, science and nature and broadening participation through public engagement, outreach, activism and public art.\n\nART±BIO Collaborative is an artist and scientist-led organization that fosters the integration of art, science and nature through novel collaborations, public art, activism, public engagement, education and research. The organization is committed to broadening participation, accessibility and equity in the arts and sciences. It creates cross-disciplinary, inclusive and collaborative opportunities for the leadership and participation of historically excluded, underrepresented and marginalized communities.

Participants engage in scholarly research; read and analyze STEM literature; and gain exposure to relevant concepts to spark their interest in STEM Research. The journal club curriculum is a “hybrid” journal club model focused on teaching students how to critically, read, dissect, analyze, evaluate and discuss research articles while incorporating social media and small group discussions. The journal club also trains students on communicating STEM topics to diverse audiences with the creation of a podcast episode based on a STEM journal article as the students’ final project for the journal club.\n\nMore\n\nSciences at Pioneer Works\n\nA massive cultural center dedicated to experimentation, education and production across disciplines, housed in a converted warehouse in the Red Hook neighborhood of Brooklyn.\n\nPioneer Works is a center for art, experiment, research, education and science. Located in a 25,000-square-foot manufacturing warehouse in Red Hook, Brooklyn, the facility houses artist studios, exhibition and performance spaces, a science lab, a recording studio, and more. The floor plan is open and flexible, encouraging a collaborative environment in which international artists, musicians, scientists and educators can create together.\n\nPioneer Works encourages its artists and scientists to focus on their own disciplines and not feel pressured to cross over into others, although collaborations often erupt spontaneously. What the organization offers to all of its inhabitants is the opportunity to live in a bigger world and play the most important part they can play on that larger stage.\n\nWith support from the Simons Foundation, Pioneer Works is rebuilding its science studios. It is also continuing its popular live science events, which are free and open to the public, and producing podcasts to disseminate its programs to a wider audience. In the later phases of its expansion, Pioneer Works will offer specially tailored scientific residencies and workshops and an incubator space. Pioneer Works hopes to become a model for the natural integration of science into a cultural organization.\n\nMore\n\nSciLine\n\nOn-deadline service connecting reporters to expert sources and research-backed evidence for use in their stories.\n\nBased at the nonprofit American Association for the Advancement of Science and staffed by a team of former journalists and scientists, SciLine is a free service for journalists and scientists with one mission: to help journalists include more high-quality scientific evidence in their news stories. SciLine quickly connects reporters to deeply knowledgeable scientists with solid communication skills and provides rigorously vetted, research-backed text and video resources to enrich their reporting. The organization operates on journalists’ deadline-driven schedules and places special emphasis on the needs of local reporters.\n\nSeparately, the organization regularly tees up scientists with expertise in newsworthy topics and schedules availability for one-on-one, broadcast quality interviews. SciLine also conducts its own video interviews with experts when science-related news breaks, then distributes video and transcripts for free download by journalists. In addition, the organization hosts media briefings in which scientists make short presentations on topics in the news and then take live questions on the record.\n\nWith Science Sandbox support, SciLine is translating many of its reporting resources into Spanish for use by U.S.-based, Spanish-language media.\n\nMore\n\nSeattle Universal Math Museum\n\nMath museum providing math enrichment activities for students that parents can replicate at home.\n\nSeattle Universal Math Museum’s (SUMM) mission is to spark each and every person to love math. The Museum was founded in 2019 to foster positive connections to math, boost math confidence and help students see math as relevant to their future. SUMM collaborates with parents, teachers, school district leaders and nonprofit partners to create in-school and after-school enrichment programs, focusing on third through eighth grade students and their educators throughout King County with a special emphasis on providing no or low-cost programming in Title 1 schools in South King County. Math comes to life through hands-on experiences inside classrooms, libraries and community centers.\n\nSUMM aims to fill a critical need by augmenting traditional learning settings that highlight the creativity in math, its connections to other disciplines and its applications beyond the classroom. Many BIPOC students, girls, neurodiverse and non-traditional learners too often become discouraged and lose confidence in their abilities in third through eighth grade — a critical age when math becomes more challenging for students, when attitudes about math form, and ideas for future careers take shape. Once confidence is boosted and students see math as relevant to their futures, academic performance improves and children thrive.\n\nMore\n\nSing for Science\n\nScience and music podcast where musicians talk to scientists about how their science connects to their most famous songs.\n\nCreated and hosted by New York musician Matt Whyte, Sing for Science’s goal is to increase science literacy for as many people as possible by reaching a variety of musicians’ fan bases. Past guests include SIA, Mac Demarco, Norah Jones, Renée Fleming, Run DMC, Blondie and many more. Listeners come to the show through their love of music and leave with a new piece of knowledge about science and the scientific process. Science literacy and respect for expertise are perhaps more vital now than ever before. The show’s chief tenet is that a more scientifically literate society can only contribute towards greater support for fairer, evidence-based governmental policy.\n\nMore\n\nSociety for Science: STEM Action Grants\n\nThis grant program supports community-driven organizations working to enhance the public’s understanding of science and to increase participation of underrepresented populations in STEM.\n\nThe Society for Science works to promote the understanding and appreciation of science and its vital role in human advancement. In 2015, the Society launched a suite of outreach and equity programs aimed at expanding access to authentic and high-quality STEM education and experiences for students from underserved or historically underrepresented communities. These programs reach millions of students, educators and community members in all 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia and U.S. territories.\n\nOne such program, called STEM Action Grants, is helping to grow the next generation of STEM social entrepreneurs. STEM Action Grants strengthen and support innovative, community-driven nonprofit organizations working to enhance the public’s understanding of science and to increase participation of groups underrepresented in STEM fields. The groundbreaking nonprofits supported by STEM Action Grants nurture potential in underserved communities but are often left out of traditional philanthropic giving. As a result, small amounts of funding and other support can have a disproportionately large impact on their essential work. In addition, grantees gain credibility that they can leverage into future funding success. The Society supports the essential work of these community-based STEM organizations by providing catalytic funds via microgrants of up to $5,000 each in addition to media exposure.\n\nIn partnership with the Simons Foundation, the Society is expanding its grantmaking capacity to launch grantee cohort-building activities to foster collaboration and build knowledge exchange for the STEM organizations supported by the program.\n\nMore\n\nSound+Science\n\nInnovative after-school program in New York City for high school students interested in exploring the profound connection between music and STEM.\n\nSound+Science offers a challenging and supportive environment that pairs high school students with local graduate and doctoral mentors. Together, they develop practical applications that are relevant to musicians, producers and coders, facilitating knowledge exchange and mutual growth.\n\nMore\n\nSTEM From Dance\n\nTwo- week programs, for girls to create a collection of technology-infused dances, to inspire them to consider joining the STEM workforce.\n\nSTEM From Dance (SFD) envisions a world in which Black and Latina women are represented equitably in the STEM workforce. To this end, SFD empowers underrepresented minority girls to prepare for a STEM education that excites them — through the creative and confidence-building aspects of dance.\n\nBlack and Latina women comprise 15% of the American population but occupy only 4% of the STEM workforce. The STEM workforce features some of our country’s most high-impact and lucrative jobs, but women of color are deterred from entering STEM fields due to lack of confidence, readiness, and awareness. SFD breaks down each of these barriers using dance as a “hook” and an environment where girls of color can grow their STEM skill set and sense of possibility that STEM can be an option for their futures. Over the past six years, SFD has impacted the STEM awareness, ability and confidence of over 400 participants across a variety of school and community sites.\n\nIn partnership with Science Sandbox, SFD piloted a summer program in July 2018 to reach girls from schools across NYC in our target population, creating an opportunity to serve more students and further the mission of preparing girls for a future in STEM. Over two weeks, girls create a collection of technology-infused dances that awe and inspire, while learning about computer science, electrical engineering, choreography and how they all work together.\n\nMore\n\nSTEM Greenhouse\n\nOrganization exposing underrepresented students in West Michigan to STEM through interactive, hands-on learning experiences.\n\nSTEM Greenhouse stands at the forefront of educational equity, offering a robust suite of programs tailored to dismantle barriers in science, technology, engineering and math education for underrepresented students.

This approach to supporting both students and their wider support networks is significant, leading to a community-wide uplift in education, career readiness and the overall expansion of the STEM talent pipeline.\n\nMore\n\nSTEM to the Future\n\nOrganization that inspires Black and Latine students ages 4 to 13 to solve injustice and create the worlds they want and deserve.\n\nSTEM to the Future (STTF) is altering the way the world addresses the STEM pipeline gap for Black and Latine students through a scalable social justice and STEAM-based curriculum. STTF positions STEAM as an integrated, hands-on learning experience that leverages competencies from science, technology, engineering and math alongside the arts to solve complex real-world problems.\n\nSTTF’s Theory+Practice (TxP) programs are student-led, after-school initiatives in which youth combine justice, STEAM and activism as they work together to reimagine and create the communities they want and deserve. They are guided through the process of: 1) creating a clear vision for the world they want and deserve; 2) using STEAM to develop projects that support their vision; and 3) connecting with the community and grassroots organizations to build and implement their projects. TxP consists of three programs: Build Em Up Robotics, The Bloom Initiative and Brick by Brick. STTF partners with STEAM Residents, who are creatives, professionals and activists with a passion for STEAM, to provide their students with content experts to support them as they address unmet needs in their communities. Students have used robotics to deliver PPE to elders, used community research to design cookbooks with healthy recipes for kids, and created their own brand to raise awareness and funds for the LGBTQ+ and unhoused communities.\n\nMore\n\nSTEMcx\n\nOrganization promoting access for underrepresented students to the skills and information needed to address scientific and technological concerns of their neighborhoods and our changing world.\n\nSTEMcx is the education arm of the faith-based organization Transforming Lives Community Development Corporation (TLCDC). Partnered with New Psalmist Baptist Church (NPBC), STEMcx is dedicated to inspiring underrepresented minority (URM) students to embrace STEM. STEMcx believes that the STEMcx/NPBC partnership provides a unique and innovative opportunity to discuss science and technology with congregants of the largest minority faith communities in Baltimore. Community engagement and advocacy is an essential component of their programming, and the program believes this integration of advocacy acts as an incentive for its students, driving their desire to acquire science knowledge.\n\nSTEMcx programming began over eight years ago with a free one-day conference exposing more than 250 Baltimore-area students to science and technology through workshops and guest speakers. The program has since grown over the years into a multifaceted community organization exposing thousands of students in grades K-12 to STEM via field trips, conferences, expos and special events. STEMcx offers free tutoring programs in math and science, low-cost summer camps and book clubs, and Saturday school year classes and workshops. Their summer high school program offers paid experiential learning opportunities in coding and cybersecurity, engineering, environmental justice, architecture, health care inequities, and space exploration. These summer experiences inspire the URM student community to connect with STEM disciplines and to see the connection of STEM with their communities.\n\nMore\n\nTechbridge Girls\n\nTackling the issue of inclusivity in STEM by providing best-in-class, hands-on programming to girls from low-income communities.\n\nTechbridge Girls excites, educates and equips girls from low-income communities to pursue science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) careers and to attain economic mobility and better life chances. Today, many girls are locked out of STEM and have to work twice as hard to get half as far. Overwhelming odds are stacked against them: They live in low-income communities, go to high-poverty schools and experience bias due to their race, class and ethnicity. Techbridge Girls aims to level the playing field and empower girls from low-income communities to achieve upward mobility and financial stability.\n\nThe ChangeMakersTM program uses research-based practices and rigorous evaluation to create a year-long program with an engaging curriculum to introduce middle-school girls to a wide array of STEM skills and concepts via \"hands-on, minds-on\" activities. Girls then use their STEM skills to create original Community Impact Projects. Community-centered Showcase events are held at the end of each program year to celebrate girls’ Community Impact Projects with families, teachers and supporters. Examples of past projects include an app that addresses Islamophobia with profiles of Muslim people in the local community as well as highlighting the similarities between Islam and other religions, and a backpack with sensors and LED lights to increase safety for girls who walk home. ChangeMakers also integrates role-model visits from STEM professionals and field trips to STEM employers and the girls' families.\n\nMore\n\nThe Calculus Project\n\nMath organization that helps schools and school districts create a middle and high school pathway for success in advanced mathematics.\n\nThe Calculus Project (TCP) helps schools and school districts use research supported strategies to increase the representation of Black, Latine and low-income students in advanced math. TCP provides district support and ongoing professional learning for teachers and administrators in a school or district to build and implement a TCP program for their students.\n\nStudents participate in five components of TCP, starting in seventh grade and continuing through high school graduation. 1) Summer Program:Students (rising eighth through 12th graders) are pre-taught some of the upcoming year’s math, which provides an opportunity to get ahead and build confidence and teaches them how to develop high capacity, collaborative study groups. 2) Cohorts: Students are grouped into designated sections to drive continued collaboration and a sense of belonging, which allows students to support each other and continue to hone the collaborative study skills learned during the summer. 3) Academic Center:Tutoring support is available through the school year from math teachers and TCP Peer Teachers (see below), which continually supports students and builds teacher to student and student to student relationships. 4) Peer Teaching: Junior and senior TCP scholars can become paid Peer Teachers for the Summer Academy and Academic Center. This component builds off the research showing the benefits of peer tutoring in driving persistence and achievement — for both the student tutor and the student being tutored. 5) Pride Curriculum: Students learn about the accomplishments of STEM professionals of color during Summer Academy, and they explore personal efficacy through lessons which focus on belonging, agency and resilience.\n\nMore\n\nThe Open Notebook\n\nTools and resources to help science, environmental, and health journalists at all levels of experience to sharpen their skills.\n\nThe Open Notebook provides in-depth articles and other tools to help science journalists improve their skills. They support and encourage high-quality science journalism that has the power to engage wide audiences.\n\nThe Diverse Voices program comprises a series of feature-length articles that examine the experiences and perspectives of minority science journalists, who are significantly underrepresented in the science journalism community. Lack of diversity in science journalism is a problem not only for science journalism as a profession but also for readers — and thus for public understanding of science. The people who tell science stories influence whose stories get told (or left untold) and, therefore, how accurately the reading public perceives the scientific enterprise and the opportunities within science for people from diverse communities. What’s more, a science media landscape that is not diverse is missing opportunities for engaging communities of readers who may be interested in science and its role in society.\n\nDiverse Voices, a partnership with the National Association of Science Writers (NASW) Diversity Committee, will bring greater visibility to journalists from underrepresented groups and to scientific and journalistic issues of special relevance to minority communities.\n\nThe Diverse Voices program is an extension of The Open Notebook’s broader mission to strengthen science journalism by helping science writers sharpen their craft.\n\nMore\n\nWhiteswan Environmental\n\nNative-led non-profit educating and strengthening relationships between bio-regional native and non-native government and NGO’s, as well as academic institutions to reconnect Coast Salish youth and community with their culture and ancestral homelands.\n\nWhiteswan Environmental is a Native-led non-profit located on the federally reserved lands of Lummi Nation that is launching Immersive Indigenous Learning through Planetarium Experiences. Students from Whatcom Intergenerational High School (WIHS) and Northwest Indian College (NWIC) will be recruited for an after-school program where they will develop digital storytelling skills in efforts to help preserve tribal history, culture, governance, and language within the Salish Sea, presenting short educational films at community events within a portable planetarium theater system. Whiteswan Environmental co-founded WIHS with the intention to transform the educational system by honoring a balance between Indigenous and Western ways of knowing, supporting knowledge democracy for all. Anticipated new films will highlight Coast Salish connection to cosmology, village sites, camps, reef net fishing locations, journey of the salmon people, and 13 moon food sovereignty. Students from diverse backgrounds will have the opportunity to work intergenerationally with their families to learn culturally safe ways to share stories based on Indigenous values of knowing who we are and where we come from. This project builds off existing planetarium films, including Big Astronomy, a film focused on astronomy facilities in Chile and the diverse STEM careers that make big astronomy possible and Navajo Skies, led by the Indigenous Education Institute (IEI), telling star stories of the Navajo people. Whiteswan Environmental aims to preserve the wisdom of elders while empowering the next generation with new tools and skills to connect with their community, culture, and ancestral homelands.\n\nMore\n\nWillie Mae Rock Camp\n\nFree music laboratory for girls and gender-expansive youth in NYC that empowers them through transdisciplinary music education\n\nWillie Mae Rock Camp (WMRC) empowers girls and gender-expansive youth through transdisciplinary music education programs that combine instrument instruction with STEM-based learning. Through the language of music, WMRC’s students gain confidence in using new technologies to express themselves and build essential skills for future success.\n\nWMRC reaches over 600 students ages 10 to 17 annually at its Brooklyn studio and partner sites throughout New York City through a range of year-round programming, including in-school music education, community workshops and afterschool and summer intensives. Across WMRC’s programs, students learn how to create a musical track; receive hands-on instruction and practice using a range of tech including electronic instruments, software and applications, and creative coding; build interactive electronics; and work together to develop their own collaborative works.
