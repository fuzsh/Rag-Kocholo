Huppert FRS\n\nPreface to the second edition\n\nChapter 1: The unconscious brain\n\nChapter 2: What is lucidity? What is understanding?\n\nChapter 3: Mindsets, evolution, and language\n\nChapter 4: Acausality illusions, and the way perception works\n\nChapter 5: What is science?\n\nChapter 6: Music, mathematics, and the Platonic\n\nPostlude: The amplifier metaphor for climate\n\nReferences and endnotes\n\nChapter 1: The unconscious brain\n\nConsider for a moment the following questions.\n\nWhat is science? What is music? What is mathematics? Are there connections between music and mathematics that go deeper than the usual games with numbers?\n\nWhat is lucidity — of writing, speaking, thinking, and design? How can one branch of knowledge best communicate with another? How can we navigate the vast conceptual minefield known as human language?\n\nWhere does our sense of truth, beauty, and transcendence come from? What is the Platonic world of perfect mathematical forms? Is our Universe part of that world, as some physicists think?\n\nWhy are people instinctively hypercredulous — driven to believe in an Absolute Truth or Answer to Everything, regardless of evidence, not only within the fundamentalist religions and atheisms but also, surprisingly, sometimes even among scientists?\n\nWhy do people instinctively dichotomize or polarize things, regardless of evidence? What are those perilous binary buttons that demagogues and others keep on pressing?\n\nAnd what indeed are these things called instincts? What kind of thing is genetic memory? Have the genetic-blueprint and selfish-gene metaphors been misleading us in any way?\n\nHow can we best understand the power and limitations of science? And what can science tell us about, for instance, the climate problem and its uncertainties?\n\nGood answers are important to our hopes of a civilized future; and many of the answers are surprisingly simple. But a quest to find them will soon encounter a conceptual and linguistic minefield, some of it around ideas like ‘innateness’ and ‘instinct’. Still, I think I can put us within reach of some good answers (with a small ‘a’) by recalling, first, some points about how our pre-human ancestors must have evolved — in a way that differs crucially from what popular culture says — and, second, some points about how we perceive and understand the world.\n\nOne reason for looking at evolution is the prevalence of misconceptions about it. Chief among them is the idea that natural selection works solely by competition between individuals. That ignores the many examples of cooperative behaviour among social animals, which Charles Darwin himself was at pains to point out.1 Saying that competition between individuals is all that matters flies in the face of this and much other evidence. It has also done great damage to human societies.2\n\nOn perception, understanding, and misunderstanding, and on our extraordinary language ability, it hardly needs saying that they were shaped by our ancestors’ evolution. Less obvious, however, is that the evolution must have depended not only on cooperation alongside competition but also, according to the best evidence, on a powerful feedback between genomic evolution and cultural evolution. For instance our language ability couldn’t have been suddenly invented around a hundred millennia ago, purely as a result of cultural evolution, as some researchers have argued. On the contrary, I’ll show in chapter 3 — drawing on clinching evidence from Nicaragua — that our language ability must have developed much more gradually, through the co-evolution of genomes and cultures with each affecting the other over a much longer timespan, probably millions of years.\n\nSuch co-evolution is necessarily a multi-timescale process. Multi-timescale processes are ubiquitous in the natural world. They’re found everywhere. They depend on strong feedbacks between different mechanisms over a large range of timescales. Here we have slow and fast mechanisms in the form of genomic evolution and cultural evolution. I’m using the word ‘cultural’ in a broad sense, to include everything passed on by social learning. Such feedbacks have often been neglected in the literature on biological evolution. Their likely importance for pre-human evolution and their multi-timescale aspects were, however, recognized and pointed out as long ago as 1971 by the great biologist Jacques Monod,3 and by the great palaeoanthropologist Phillip Tobias.4\n\nAnother theme in this book will be unconscious assumptions. It’s clear that such assumptions underlie, for instance, the polarized debates about ‘nature versus nurture’, ‘instinct versus learning’, ‘genomic evolution versus cultural evolution’, and so on. A gut feeling that evolution is either genomic or cultural, with each excluding the other, is typical. At a deeply unconscious level, it’s assumed that you can’t have both together. Further examples will come up in chapter 3. They’re germane to some notable scientific controversies.\n\nThe dichotomization instinct, as I’ll call it, the visceral push toward polarization — toward seeing all choices and distinctions as binary and exclusive — is by no means the only source of unconscious assumptions. Much more of what’s involved in perception and understanding, and in our general functioning, takes place unconsciously. Some people find this hard to accept. Perhaps they feel offended, in a personal way, to be told that the slightest aspect of their existence might, just possibly, not be under full and rigorous conscious control. A brilliant scientist whom I know personally as a colleague took offence in exactly that way, in a discussion we had on unconscious assumptions in science — even though the exposure of such assumptions is the usual way in which scientific knowledge improves, as history shows again and again, and even though I offered clear examples from our shared field of expertise.5\n\nMany other examples are given in the book by Daniel Kahneman.6 My own favourite example is a very simple one, Gunnar Johansson’s ‘walking dots’ or ‘walking lights’ animation. Twelve moving dots in a two-dimensional plane are unconsciously assumed to represent a particular three-dimensional motion. When the dots are moving, everyone with normal vision sees a person walking. To see the animation, click on the black square:\n\nFigure 1: On the left is a single frame from Gunnar Johansson’s ‘walking dots’ animation. The black square on the right is a link to display the animation (and a placeholder for an appropriate QR code in the published book). The animation shows a person walking from far right to near left. The walking dots phenomenon is a well studied classic in experimental psychology and is one of the most robust perceptual phenomena known. Animation constructed by Steve Lay from data kindly supplied by Professor James Maas.\n\nAnd again, anyone who has driven cars, or flown aircraft, will probably remember occasions on which accidents were avoided ahead of conscious thought. The typical experience is often described as witnessing oneself taking, for instance, evasive action when faced with a head-on collision, or other life-threatening emergency. It is all over by the time conscious thinking has begun. It has happened to me, in cars and in gliders. I think such experiences are quite common. Kahneman gives an example from firefighting.6\n\nMany years ago, the anthropologist-philosopher Gregory Bateson put the essential point succinctly, in classic evolutionary cost-benefit terms:7\n\nNo organism can afford to be conscious of matters with which it could deal at unconscious levels.\n\nGregory Bateson’s point applies to us as well as to other living organisms. Why? There’s a mathematical reason, combinatorial largeness. Every living organism has to deal all the time with a combinatorial tree, a combinatorially large number, of present and future possibilities. Each branching of possibilities multiplies, rather than adds to, the number of possibilities. Being conscious of all those possibilities would be almost infinitely costly.\n\nCombinatorially large numbers are unimaginably large. No-one can feel their magnitudes intuitively. For instance the number of ways to shuffle a pack of 52 cards is 52 × 51 × 50 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1. That’s just over eighty million trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion.\n\nThe ‘instinctive’ avoidance of head-on collision in a car — the action taken ahead of conscious thought — is not, of course, something that comes exclusively from genetic memory. Learning is involved as well. The same goes for the way we see the walking dots animation. But much of that learning is itself unconscious, stretching back to the infantile groping that discovers the outside world and allows normal vision to develop.8 Far from being mutually exclusive, nature and nurture are intimately intertwined. That intimacy stretches even further back, to the genome within the embryo ‘discovering’ and interacting with its maternal environment.9 Jurassic Park is a great story, but scientifically wrong because you need dinosaur eggs as well as dinosaur DNA. Who knows, though — since birds are dinosaurs someone might manage it, one day, with reconstructed DNA and birds’ eggs.\n\nMy approach to questions like the foregoing comes from long experience as a scientist. Science was my main profession for fifty years or so. Although many branches of science interest me, my professional career was focused mainly on mathematical research to understand the highly complex, multi-timescale fluid dynamics of the Earth’s atmosphere and oceans. Included are phenomena such as the great jet streams and the air motion that shapes the ozone hole in the Antarctic stratosphere, and what are sometimes called the “world’s largest breaking waves”. Imagine a giant sideways breaker in the stratosphere the mere tip of which is almost as large as the entire USA. That research has in turn helped us, in an unexpected way, to understand the complex fluid dynamics and magnetic fields of something even more gigantic, the Sun’s interior. But long ago I almost became a musician. Or rather, in my youth I was, in fact, a part-time professional musician and could have made it into a full-time career. So I’ve had artistic preoccupations too, and artistic aspirations. This book tries to get at the deepest connections between all these things.\n\nIt’s obvious, isn’t it, that science, mathematics, and the arts are all of them bound up with the way perception works. That’ll be the central topic in chapter 4, where the walking dots will prove informative. And common to science, mathematics, and the arts is the creativity that leads to new understanding, the thrill of curiosity and lateral thinking, and sheer wonder at the whole phenomenon of life itself and at the astonishing Universe we live in.\n\nOne of the greatest of those wonders is our own adaptability, our versatility. Who knows, it might even get us through today’s crises, desperate though they might seem. We know that our hunter-gatherer ancestors were highly adaptable. They were driven again and again to migration and different ways of living by, among other things, rapid climate fluctuations — the legendary years of famine and years of plenty. How else did our species — a single, genetically-compatible species with its single human genome — spread around the globe in less than a hundred millennia? Chapter 3 will point to recent hard evidence for the sheer rapidity, and magnitude, of some of those climate fluctuations.\n\nChapter 3 will also point to recent advances in our understanding of biological evolution and natural selection, advances not yet assimilated into popular culture. One implication is that not only the nastiest but also the most compassionate, most cooperative parts of our makeup are ‘biological’ and deep-seated.2, 10, 11 There’s a popular misconception — yet another variation on the theme of nature ‘versus’ nurture — that our nastiest traits are exclusively biological and our nicest traits exclusively cultural. We’ll see that the evidence says otherwise.\n\nHere, by the way, as in most of this book, I lay no claim to originality. For instance the evidence on past climates comes from the painstaking work of colleagues at the cutting edge of palaeoclimatology, including great scientists such as the late Nick Shackleton whom I had the privilege of knowing personally. And the points I’ll make about biological evolution rely on insights gleaned from colleagues at the cutting edge of biology, including the late John Sulston of human-genome fame, whom I also knew personally.\n\nOur ancestors must have had not only language and lateral thinking — and music, dance, poetry, and storytelling — but also rhetoric, power games, blame games, genocide, ecstatic suicide and the rest. To survive, they must have had love and compassion too. The precise timespans and evolutionary pathways for these things are uncertain. But the timespans for at least some of them, including the beginnings of our language ability, must have been a million years or more to allow for the multi-timescale co-evolution of genomes and cultures.\n\nAs already suggested there’s been a tendency to neglect such co-evolution despite the ubiquity — the commonplace occurrence — of other multi-timescale processes in the natural world. Of these there’s a huge variety. To take one of the simplest examples, consider air pressure, as when pumping up a bicycle tyre. Fast molecular collisions mediate slow changes in air pressure, and air temperature, while pressure and temperature react back on collision rates and strengths. That’s a strong and crucial feedback across enormously different timescales.\n\nSo it never made sense to me to say that long and short timescales can’t interact. It never made sense to say that genomic evolution can have no interplay with cultural evolution just because the one is slow and the other is fast. And in particular it never made sense to argue from the archaeological record, as some researchers have, that language started around a hundred millennia ago as a purely cultural invention — the sudden invention of a single mother tongue from which today’s languages are all descended, purely by cultural transmission.12, 13 I’ll return to these points in chapter 3 and will try to argue them very carefully.\n\nWhen considering the archaeological record it’s sometimes forgotten that language and culture can be mediated purely by sound waves and light waves and held in individuals’ memories — as in the Odyssey or in a multitude of other oral traditions, including Australian aboriginal songlines, the Japanese epic Tale of the Heike, and the many stories in what Laurens van der Post has called the immense wealth of the unwritten literature of Africa.14 That’s a very convenient, an eminently portable, form of culture for a tribe on the move. And sound waves and light waves are such ephemeral things. They have the annoying property of leaving no archaeological trace. But absence of evidence isn’t evidence of absence.\n\nAnd now, in a mere flash of evolutionary time, a mere few centuries, we’ve shown our versatility and adaptability in ways that seem to me more astonishing than ever. We no longer panic at the sight of a comet. Demons in the air have shrunk to a small minority of alien abductors. We don’t burn witches and heretics, at least not literally. The Pope apologizes for past misdeeds. Genocide was avoided in South Africa. We even dare, sometimes, to tolerate individual propensities and lifestyles if they don’t harm others. We argue that tyrants needn’t always win. And guess what, they don’t always win. Indeed, recent reversals notwithstanding, governments have become less tyrannical and more democratic, on average, over the past two centuries, in what political scientist Samuel Huntington has called three waves of democratization15 despite the setbacks in between, and now. And most astonishing of all, since 1945 we’ve even had the good sense so far — and very much against the odds — to avoid warfare with nuclear weapons.\n\nWe’ve marvelled at the sight of our beautiful Earth poised above the lunar horizon. We have space-based observing systems, super-accurate clocks, and super-accurate global positioning, adding to the cross-checks on Einstein’s gravitational theory, also called general relativity. And now there’s yet another, very beautiful cross-check on the theory — detection of the lightspeed gravitational ripples it predicts.16 We have the Internet, bringing us new degrees of freedom and profligacy of information and misinformation. It presents us with new challenges to exercise critical thinking and to build computational systems and artificial intelligences of unprecedented power, and to use them for civilized purposes, exploiting the robustness and reliability growing out of the open-source software movement, “the collective IQ of thousands of individuals”.17 We can read and write genetic codes, and thanks to our collective IQ are beginning, just beginning, to understand them.18 On large and small scales we’ve been carrying out extraordinary new social experiments with labels like ‘market democracy’, ‘market autocracy’, ‘children’s democracy’19, ‘microlending’ conducive to population control,20 ‘citizen science’, and the burgeoning social media. With the weaponization of the social media now upon us — and the threats to democracy, privacy, and safety from, for instance, automated face recognition, reverse-image search, and deep-fake software21 — there’s a huge downside as with any new technology. But there’s also a huge upside, and everything to play for...\n\n* * TEXT OMITTED FROM THIS PREVIEW * *\n\nWhat makes life as a scientist worth living? For me, part of the answer is the joy of being open and honest.\n\nThere’s a scientific ideal and a scientific ethic that power good science. And they depend crucially on openness and honesty. If you stand up in front of a large conference and say of your favourite theory “I was wrong”, you gain respect rather than losing it. I’ve seen it happen. Your reputation increases. Why? The scientific ideal says that respect for evidence, for theoretical coherence and self-consistency, for cross-checking, for finding mistakes, for dealing with uncertainty and for improving our collective knowledge is more important than personal ego, or financial gain. And if someone else has found evidence that refutes your theory, then the scientific ethic requires you to say so publicly. The ethic says that you must not only be factually honest but must also give due credit to others, by name, whenever their contributions are relevant.\n\nThe scientific ideal and ethic are powerful because even when, as is inevitable, they’re followed only imperfectly, they encourage not only a healthy scepticism but also a healthy mixture of competition and cooperation. Just as in the open-source software community, the ideal and ethic harness the collective IQ, the collective brainpower, of large research communities in ways that can transcend even the power of individual greed and financial gain. The ozone-hole story is a case in point.\n\nSo too is the human-genome story with its promise of future scientific breakthroughs, including medical breakthroughs, calling for years and decades of collective research effort. The scientific ideal and ethic were powerful enough to keep the genomic information in the public domain — available for use in open research communities — despite an attempt to lock it up commercially that very nearly succeeded.26 Our collective brainpower will be crucial to solving the problems posed by the genome and the molecular-biological systems of which it forms a part, including the interplay with current and future pandemic diseases. Like so many other problems now confronting us, they are problems of the most formidable complexity.\n\nIn the Postlude I’ll return to the struggle between open science and the forces ranged against it, with particular reference to climate change, the most complex problem of them all. Again, there’s no claim to originality here. I merely aim to pick out, from the morass of confusion and misinformation surrounding the topic,24 some basic points clarifying where the uncertainties lie, as well as the near-certainties.\n\nChapter 2: What is lucidity? What is understanding?\n\nThis book reflects my own journey toward the frontiers of human self-understanding. Of course many others have made such journeys. But in my case the journey began in a slightly unusual way.\n\nMusic and the arts were always part of my life. Music was pure magic to me as a small child. But the conscious journey began with a puzzle. While reading my students’ doctoral thesis drafts, and working as a scientific journal editor, managing the peer review of colleagues’ research papers, I began to wonder why lucidity, or clarity — in writing and speaking, as well as in thinking — is often found difficult to achieve. And I wondered why some of my colleagues are such surprisingly bad communicators, even within their own research communities, let alone on issues of public concern. Then I began to wonder what lucidity is, in a functional or operational sense. And then I began to suspect a deep connection with the way music works. Music is, after all, not only part of our culture but also part of our unconscious human nature.\n\nI now like to understand the word ‘lucidity’ in a more general sense than usual. It’s not only about what you can find in style manuals and in books on how to write, excellent and useful though many of them are. (Strunk and White27 is a little gem.) It’s also about deep connections not only with music but also with mathematics, pattern perception, biological evolution, and science in general. A common thread is what I call the organic-change principle.\n\nThe principle says that we’re perceptually sensitive to, and have an unconscious interest in, patterns exhibiting ‘organic change’. These are patterns in which some things change, continuously or by small amounts, while others stay the same. So an organically-changing pattern has invariant elements.\n\nThe walking dots animation is an example. The invariant elements include the number of dots, always twelve dots. Musical harmony is another.\n\nMusical harmony is an interesting case because ‘small amounts’ is relevant not in one, but in two different senses, as we’ll see in chapter 6. That leads to the idea of ‘musical hyperspace’. An organic chord progression, or harmony change, can take us somewhere that’s both nearby and far away. That’s how some of the magic is done, in many genres of Western music. An octave leap is a large change in one sense, but small in the other, indeed so small that musicians use the same name for the two pitches. The invariant elements in an organic harmony change can be pitches or chord shapes.\n\nMusic makes use of organically-changing sound patterns not just in its harmony, but also in its melodic shapes and counterpoint and in the overall form, or architecture, of an entire piece of music. That’s part of how it can grab our attention Mathematics, too, contains organically-changing patterns. In mathematics there are beautiful results about ‘invariants’ or ‘conserved quantities’, things that stay the same while other things change, often continuously through a vast space of possibilities. The great mathematician Emmy Noether discovered a common origin for many such results, through a profound and original piece of mathematical thinking. Her discovery is called Noether’s Theorem and is recognized today as a foundation-stone of theoretical physics.\n\nOur perceptual sensitivity to organic change exists for strong biological reasons. One reason is the survival value of seeing the difference between living things and dead or inanimate things. To see a cat stalking a bird, or a flower opening, is to see organic change.\n\nSo I’d dare to describe our sensitivity to it as deeply instinctive. Many years ago I saw a pet kitten suddenly die of some mysterious but acute disease — a sudden freezing into stillness. I’d never seen death before, but I remember feeling instantly sure of what had happened — ahead of conscious thought. And the ability to see the difference between living and dead has been shown to be well developed in human infants a few months old.\n\nNotice how intimately involved, in all this, are ideas of a very abstract kind. The idea of some things changing while others stay invariant is itself highly abstract, as well as simple. It’s abstract in the sense that vast numbers of possibilities are included. There are vast numbers — combinatorially large numbers — of organically-changing patterns, musical, mathematical, visual, and verbal. Here again we’re glimpsing the fact already hinted at, that the unconscious brain can handle many possibilities at once. We have an unconscious power of abstraction. That’s almost the same as saying that we have unconscious mathematics. Mathematics is a precise means of handling many possibilities, many patterns, at once, in a self-consistent way, and of discovering surprising interconnections between them.\n\nThe walking dots animation shows that we have unconscious Euclidean geometry, the mathematics of angles and distances. There are combinatorially large numbers of arrangements of objects, at various angles and distances from one another. The roots of mathematics and logic lie far deeper, and are evolutionarily far more ancient, than they’re usually thought to be. They’re hundreds of millions of years more ancient than archaeology might suggest. In chapter 6 I’ll show that our unconscious mathematics includes, also, the mathematics underlying Noether’s theorem, and I’ll show how all this is related to Plato’s world of perfect mathematical forms.\n\nSo I’ve been interested in lucidity, ‘lucidity principles’, and related matters in a sense that cuts deeper than, and goes far beyond, the niceties and pedantries of style manuals. But before anyone starts thinking that it’s all about Plato and ivory-tower philosophy, let’s remind ourselves of some harsh practical realities — as Plato would have done had he lived today. What I’m talking about is relevant not only to music, mathematics, thinking, and communication skills but also, for instance, to the ergonomic design of machinery, of software and user-friendly IT systems (information technology), of user interfaces in general and of technological systems of any kind — including the emerging artificial-intelligence systems, where the stakes are so incalculably high.\n\nThe organic-change principle — that we’re perceptually sensitive to organically-changing patterns — shows why good practice in any of these endeavours involves not only variation but also invariant elements, i.e., repeated elements, just as music does. Good control-panel or website design might use, for instance, repeated shapes for control knobs or buttons. And in writing and speaking one needn’t be afraid of repetition, if it forms the invariant element within an organically-changing word pattern. “If you are serious, then I’ll be serious” is a clearer and stronger sentence than “If you are serious, then I’ll be also.” Loss of the invariant element “serious” weakens the sentence. Still weaker are versions like “If you are serious, then I’ll be earnest.” Such pointless or gratuitous variation in place of repetition is what H. W. Fowler ironically called “elegant” variation, an “incurable vice” of second-rate writers.28 Its opposite can be called lucid repetition, as in “If you are serious, then I’ll be serious.” Lucid repetition is not the same as being repetitious. The pattern as a whole is changing, organically. It works the same way in every language I’ve looked at, including Chinese.29\n\nTwo more ‘lucidity principles’ are worth noting here. There’s an explicitness principle — the need to be more explicit than you feel necessary — because, obviously, you’re communicating with someone whose head isn’t full of what your own head is full of. As the great mathematician J. E. Littlewood once put it,30 “Two trivialities omitted can add up to an impasse.” Again, this applies to design in general, as well as to any form of writing or speaking that aims at lucidity. Quite often, all that’s needed is to use a noun, perhaps repeated, rather than a pronoun. With a website button marked ‘Cancel’ it helps to say what it cancels. And then there’s the more obvious coherent-ordering principle, the need to build context before new points are introduced. It applies not only to writing and speaking but also to the design of any sequential process on, for instance, a website or a ticket-vending machine.\n\nOne reason for attending to these principles is that human language is surprisingly weak on logic-checking, including checks for self-consistency.\n\nThat’s one of the reasons why language is such a conceptual minefield — something that’s long kept philosophers in business. And beyond everyday misunderstandings we have, of course, the workings of professional camouflage and deception, as in the ozone and other disinformation campaigns.\n\nThe logic-checking weakness shows up in the misnomers and self-contradictory terms encountered not only in everyday dealings but also — to my continual surprise — in the technical language used by my scientific and engineering colleagues...\n\n* * TEXT OMITTED FROM THIS PREVIEW * *\n\nWhat of my other question? What is this subtle and elusive thing we call understanding, or insight? What does it mean to think clearly about a problem?\n\nOf course there are many answers, depending on one’s purpose and viewpoint. I’ll focus on scientific understanding.\n\nWhat I’ve always found in my own research, and have always tried to suggest to my students, is that developing an in-depth scientific understanding of something — understanding in detail how it works — requires looking at it, and testing it, from as many different viewpoints as possible. That’s an important part of the creativity that goes into good science. And it puts a premium on good communication, including the ability to listen, actively, to someone offering a different viewpoint or focusing on a different aspect. Another part is to maintain a healthy scepticism, while respecting the evidence. And because it respects the evidence, such creativity is to be sharply distinguished from the postmodernist ‘anything goes’.\n\nFor instance, the multi-timescale fluid dynamics I’ve worked on professionally is far too complex to be understandable at all from a single viewpoint, such as the viewpoint provided by a particular set of mathematical equations. One needs a multi-modal approach with equations, words, pictures, and feelings all working together, as far as possible, to form a self-consistent whole with experiments and observations. And the equations themselves take different forms embodying different viewpoints, with technical names such as ‘variational’, ‘Eulerian’, ‘Lagrangian’, and so on. They’re mathematically equivalent but, as the great physicist Richard Feynman used to say, “psychologically very different”. I’ll give an example in chapter 6. Bringing in words, in a lucid way, is an important part of the whole but needs to be related to, and made consistent with, equations, pictures, and feelings.\n\nSuch multi-modal thinking and healthy scepticism have been the only ways I’ve known of escaping from the mindsets and unconscious assumptions that tend to entrap us, and of avoiding false dichotomies in particular. The history of science shows that escaping from unconscious mindsets has always been a key part of progress, as already remarked,5 including what Thomas Kuhn famously called paradigm shifts. And an important aid to cultivating a multi-modal view of any scientific problem is the habit of performing what Albert Einstein called thought-experiments, and mentally viewing those from as many angles as possible.\n\nEinstein certainly talked about feeling things, in one’s imagination — forces, motion, colliding particles, light waves — and was always doing thought-experiments, mental what-if experiments if you prefer. The same thread runs through the testimonies of Richard Feynman and of other great scientists, such as Peter Medawar and Jacques Monod. It all goes back to juvenile play — that deadly serious rehearsal for real life — curious young animals and children pushing and pulling things (and people!) to see, and feel, how they work.\n\nIn my own research community I’ve often noticed colleagues having futile arguments about ‘the’ cause of some phenomenon. “It’s driven by such-and-such”, says one. “No, it’s driven by so-and-so”, says another. Sometimes the argument gets quite acrimonious. Often, though, they’re at cross-purposes because — perhaps unconsciously — they have different thought-experiments in mind.\n\nNotice how the verb ‘to drive’ illustrates what I mean by language as a conceptual minefield. ‘Drive’ sounds incisive and clear-cut, but is nonetheless dangerously ambiguous. I sometimes think that our computers should make it flash red for danger, as soon as it’s typed, along with some other dangerously ambiguous words such as the pronoun ‘this’.\n\n‘To drive’ can mean ‘to control’, as when driving a car, or controlling an audio amplifier via its input signal. But ‘to drive’ can also mean ‘to supply the energy needed’, via the fuel tank or the amplifier’s power supply. Well, there are two quite different thought-experiments here, on the amplifier let’s say. One is to change the input signal. The other is to switch the power off. A viewpoint focused on the power supply alone misses crucial aspects of the problem.\n\nYou may laugh, but there’s been a mindset in my research community that has, or used to have, precisely such a focus. It said that the way to understand our atmosphere and oceans is through their intricate ‘energy budgets’, disregarding questions of what they’re sensitive to. Yes, energy budgets are interesting and important, but no, they’re not the Answer to Everything. Energy budgets focus attention on the power supply, making an input signal look unimportant just because it’s small.\n\nInstead of the verb ‘to drive’ it’s often helpful, I think, to use the verb ‘to mediate’, as in the biological literature where it usually points to an important part of some mechanism.\n\nThe topic of mindsets and unconscious assumptions has been illuminated not only through the work of Kahneman and Tversky6 but also through, for instance, that of Iain McGilchrist36 and Vilayanur Ramachandran.37 They bring in the workings of the brain’s left and right hemispheres. That’s a point to which I’ll return in chapter 4. In brief, the right hemisphere typically takes a holistic view of things and is more open to the unexpected, while the left hemisphere specializes in dissecting fine detail and is more prone to mindsets, including their unconscious aspects. The sort of scientific understanding I’m talking about — in-depth, multi-modal understanding — seems to involve an intricate collaboration between the two hemispheres, with each playing to its own very different strengths.\n\nConversely, if that collaboration is disrupted by brain damage, extreme forms of mindset can result. Clinical neurologists are familiar with a delusional mindset called anosognosia. Damage to the right hemisphere paralyses, for instance, a patient’s left arm, yet the patient vehemently denies that the arm is paralysed, and will make all sorts of excuses as to why he or she doesn’t fancy moving it when asked.\n\nBack in the 1920s, the great physicist Max Born was immersed in the mind-blowing experience of developing quantum theory. Born later remarked that engagement with science and its healthy scepticism can give us an escape route from mindsets and unconscious assumptions. With the more dangerous kinds of zealotry or fundamentalism in mind, he said38\n\n“I believe that ideas such as absolute certitude, absolute exactness, final truth, etc., are figments of the imagination which should not be admissible in any field of science... This loosening of thinking [Lockerung des Denkens] seems to me to be the greatest blessing which modern science has given to us. For the belief in a single truth and in being the possessor thereof is the root cause of all evil in the world.”\n\nFurther wisdom on these topics can be found in, for instance, the classic study of fundamentalist cults by Flo Conway and Jim Siegelman.39 It echoes religious wars over the centuries. Time will tell, perhaps, how the dangers from the fundamentalist religions compare with those from the fundamentalist atheisms. Among today’s fundamentalist atheisms we have not only scientific fundamentalism, saying that Science Is the Answer to Everything and Religion Must Be Destroyed — provoking a needless backlash against science, sometimes violent — but also, for instance, atheist versions of what economists now call market fundamentalism.2, 25\n\nMarket fundamentalism is arguably the most dangerous of all because of its financial and political power, still remarkably strong in today’s world. I don’t mean Adam Smith’s reasonable idea that market forces and profits are useful, in symbiosis with the division of labour and good regulation.25 Smith was clear about the need for regulation, written or unwritten.40 I don’t mean the business entrepreneurship that can provide us with useful goods and services. By market fundamentalism I mean the hypercredulous belief, the taking-for-granted, the simplistic and indeed incoherent mindset that market forces are by themselves the Answer to Everything, when based solely on ‘deregulation’ and the maximization of individual profit — regardless of evidence like the 2008 financial crash. Some adherents consider their beliefs ‘scientifically’ justified through the idea, which they wrongly attribute to Darwin, that competition between individuals is all that matters.1 That last idea isn’t, I should add, exclusive to the so-called political right.2\n\nUnderstanding market fundamentalism is important because of its tendency to promote not only financial but also social instability, not least through gross economic inequality.2 And the financial power of market fundamentalism makes it one of the greatest threats to good science, and indeed to rational problem-solving of any kind because, for a true believer, individual profit is paramount, taking precedence over respect for evidence — evidence about financial and social stability, or mental health, or pandemic viruses, or biodiversity, or the ozone hole or climate or anything else. The point is underlined by the investigations in refs. 24 and 41.\n\nCommon to all forms of fundamentalism, or puritanism, or extremism is that besides ignoring or cherry-picking evidence they forbid the loosening of thinking that allows freedom to view things from more than one angle. Only one viewpoint is permitted, for otherwise you are ‘impure’. You’re commanded to have tunnel vision. The 2008 financial crash seems to have made only a small dent in market fundamentalism, so far, though perhaps reducing the numbers of its adherents. Perhaps the COVID-19 pandemic will make a bigger dent. It’s too early to say. And what’s called ‘science versus religion’ is not, it seems to me, about scientific insight versus religious, or spiritual, insight. Rather, it’s about scientific fundamentalism versus religious fundamentalism, which of course are irreconcilable.\n\nSuch futile dichotomizations cry out for more loosening of thinking. How can such loosening work? As Ramachandran or McGilchrist might say, it’s almost as if the right brain hemisphere nudges the left with a wordless message to the effect that ‘You might be sure, but I smell a rat: could you, just possibly, be missing something?’\n\nIt’s well known that in 1983 a Russian officer, Stanislav Petrov, saved us from likely nuclear war. At great personal cost, he disobeyed standing orders when a malfunctioning weapons system said ‘nuclear attack imminent’. He smelt a rat and we had a narrow escape. We probably owe it to Petrov’s right hemisphere. There have been other such escapes.\n\nChapter 3: Mindsets, evolution, and language\n\nLet’s fast-rewind to a few million years ago, and further consider our ancestors’ evolution. Where did we, our insights, and our mindsets come from? And how on Earth did we acquire our language ability — that vast conceptual minefield — so powerful, so versatile, yet so weak on logic-checking? These questions are more than just tantalizing. Clearly they’re germane to past and present conflicts, and to future risks including existential risks.\n\nThe first obstacle to understanding is what I’ll dare — following a suggestion by John Sulston — to call simplistic evolutionary theory. The theory is still firmly entrenched in popular culture, with labels like ‘Darwinian struggle’. Many biologists would now agree with John that the theory is no more than a caricature. But it’s a remarkably persistent caricature. It’s still hugely influential. It includes the idea that competition between individuals is all that matters.\n\nMore precisely, simplistic evolutionary theory says that evolution has just three aspects. First, the structure of an organism is governed entirely by its genome, acting as a deterministic ‘blueprint’ made of all-powerful ‘selfish genes’. Second, contrary to what Charles Darwin thought,18 natural selection is the only significant evolutionary force. And third, natural selection works through ‘survival of the fittest’, conceived of solely in terms of a struggle between individuals.\n\nSurvival of the fittest would be a reasonable proposition were it not that an oversimplified notion of fitness is used. Not only is fitness presumed to apply solely to individual organisms, but it’s also presumed to mean nothing more than the individual’s ability to pass on its genes. Admittedly this purely competitive, purely individualistic view does explain much of what happens in our planet’s astonishing biosphere. But it also misses many crucial points. It’s not the evolutionary Answer to Everything.\n\nThere’s a slightly more sophisticated view called ‘inclusive fitness’ or ‘kin selection’, which replaces individuals by families whose members share enough genes to count as closely related. But it misses the same points.\n\nFor one thing, as Darwin recognized, our species and many other social species, such as baboons, could not have survived without cooperation within large groups. Without such cooperation, alongside competition, our ground-dwelling ancestors would have been easy meals for the large, swift predators all around them, including the big cats — gobbled up in no time at all! Cooperation restricted to a few closely related individuals would not have been enough to survive those dangers. And Darwin gives clear examples in which cooperation within large non-human groups is, in fact, observed to take place, as for instance with the geladas and the hamadryas baboons of Ethiopia.1\n\nEven bacteria cooperate. That’s well known. One way they do it is by sharing small packages of genetic information called plasmids or DNA cassettes. A plasmid might for instance contain information on how to survive antibiotic attack. Don’t get me wrong. I’m not saying that bacteria ‘think’ like us, or like baboons or dolphins or other social mammals, or like social insects. And I’m not saying that bacteria never compete. They often do. But for instance it’s a hard fact — a practical certainty, and now an urgent problem in medicine — that large groups of individual bacteria cooperate among themselves to develop resistance to antibiotics. For the bacteria, such resistance is highly adaptive, and strongly selected for. Yes, selective pressures are at work, but at group level as well as at individual and kin level, and at cellular and molecular level,18 in heterogeneous populations living in heterogeneous, and ever-changing, ecological environments.\n\nSo it’s plain that natural selection operates at many levels within the biosphere, and that cooperation is widespread alongside competition. Indeed the word ‘symbiosis’ in its standard meaning denotes a variety of intimate, and well studied, forms of cooperation not between individuals of one species but between those of entirely different species. And different species of bacteria share plasmids.42 The trouble is the sheer complexity of it all — again a matter of combinatorial largeness as well as of population heterogeneity, and of the complexities of mutual fitness in and around various ecological niches. We’re far from having comprehensive mathematical models of how it all works.\n\nOn the other hand, though, the models have made great progress in recent decades, aided by increasing computer power. There have been significant advances at molecular level.18 They’ve added to the accumulated evidence for what’s now called multi-level natural selection or, for brevity, multi-level selection.43–55 The evidence comes not only from better models at various levels but also, for instance, from laboratory experiments with heterogeneous populations of real organisms, directly demonstrating group-level selection.43\n\nThe persistence of simplistic evolutionary theory, oblivious to all these considerations, seems to be bound up with a particular pair of mindsets. The first says that the genes’ eye view — or, more fundamentally, the replicators’ or DNA’s eye view — gives us the only useful angle from which to view evolution. The second reiterates that selective pressures operate at one level only, that of individual organisms. The first mindset misses the value of viewing a problem from more than one angle. The second misses most of the real complexity. And that complexity includes not only group-level selective pressures as demonstrated in the laboratory,43 but also the group-level selective pressures on our ancestors noted by biologists such as Jacques Monod3 and by palaeoanthropologists such as Phillip Tobias,4 Robin Dunbar,46 and Matt Rossano48 to name but a few.\n\nBoth mindsets seem to have come from mathematical models that are grossly oversimplified by today’s standards, valuable though they were in their time. They are the old population-genetics models that were first formulated in the early twentieth century44 and then further developed in the 1960s and 1970s. For the sake of mathematical simplicity and solvability those models exclude, by assumption, all the aforementioned complexities as well as multi-timescale processes and, in particular, realistic group-level selection scenarios.43, 52, 54 And the hypothetical ‘genes’ in those models are themselves grossly oversimplified. They correspond to the popular idea of a gene ‘for’ this or that trait — nothing like actual genes, the protein-coding sequences within the genomic DNA. Very many actual genes are involved, usually, in the development of a recognizable trait, along with non-coding parts of the DNA, the associated regulatory networks, and the environmental circumstances.3, 9, 18\n\n* * TEXT OMITTED FROM THIS PREVIEW * *\n\nAnd what of the changing climate that our ancestors had to cope with? Over the timespan of figure 2, the climate system underwent increasingly large fluctuations some of which were very sudden, as will be illustrated shortly, drastically affecting our ancestors’ food supplies and living conditions. In the later stages, which culminated in the runaway brain evolution and global-scale migration of our species, the increasing climate fluctuations would have been ramping up the pressure to develop tribal solidarity and versatility mediated by ever more elaborate mythologies, rituals, songs, and stories passed from generation to generation.\n\nAnd what stories they must have been! Great sagas etched into a tribe’s collective memory. It can hardly be accidental that the sagas known today tell of years of famine and years of plenty, of battles, of epic journeys, of great floods, and of terrifying deities that are both fickle benefactors and devouring monsters — just as the surrounding large predators must have appeared to our early ancestors, as those ancestors scavenged on leftover carcasses long before becoming top predators themselves.67 And epic journeys and great floods must have been increasingly part of our ancestors’ struggle to survive, as they migrated under the increasingly changeable climatic conditions...\n\n* * TEXT OMITTED FROM THIS PREVIEW * *\n\nTo survive all this, our ancestors must have had not just tribal solidarity but also, at least in times of crisis, strong leaders and willing followers. Hypercredulity and weak logic-checking must have had a role — selected for as genome and culture co-evolved and as language became more sophisticated, and more fluent and imaginative with stories of the natural and the supernatural.\n\nHow do you make leadership work? Do you make a reasoned case? Do you ask your followers to check your logic? Do you check it yourself? Of course not! You’re a leader because, with your people starving, you’ve emerged as a charismatic visionary. You’re divinely inspired. Your people love you. You know you’re right, and it doesn’t need checking. You have the Answer to Everything. “O my people, I’ve been shown the True Path that we must follow. Come with me! Let’s make our tribe great again! Beyond those mountains, over that horizon, that’s where we’ll find our Promised Land. It is our destiny to find that Land and overcome all enemies because we, and only we, are the True Believers. Our stories are the only true stories.” How else, in the incessantly-fluctuating climate, I ask again, did our one species — our single human genome — spread all around the globe in less than a hundred millennia?\n\nAnd what of dichotomization — that ever-present, ever-potent source of unconscious assumptions — assumptions that are so often wrong in today’s world? Well, it’s even more ancient, isn’t it. Hundreds of millions of years more ancient. Ever since the Cambrian, half a billion years ago, survival has teetered on the brink of edible or inedible, male or female, friend or foe, and fight or flight. In life-threatening emergencies, binary snap decisions were crucial. But with language and hypercredulity in place, the dichotomization instinct — rooted in the most ancient, the most primitive, the most reptilian parts of our brains — could grow into new forms. Not just friend or foe but also We are right and they are wrong. It’s the Absolute Truth of our belief system versus the absolute falsehood of theirs, with nothing in between.\n\nYou might be tempted to dismiss the last point as a mere ‘just so story’, speculation unsupported by evidence. But I’d argue that there’s plenty of evidence today. One clear line of evidence is the ease with which polarized conflicts are amplified, expanded, and intensified by the social media, despite the immense harm that they cause.\n\nThere’s also the evidence documented in the book by evolutionary biologist David Sloan Wilson.43 This carefully argued book includes case studies of fundamentalist or puritanical belief systems — religious in chapter 6, and atheist in chapter 7. For instance Ayn Rand, an atheist prophet revered for her preaching of market fundamentalism, held that selfishness is an absolute good and altruism an absolute evil. Personal greed at others’ expense is the Answer to Everything, and the pinnacle of moral virtue. Wilson describes how a well-intentioned believer, Rand’s disciple Alan Greenspan, was “dumbfounded” by the 2008 financial crash shortly after his long reign at the US Federal Reserve Bank. How could a system based on Rand's gospel fail so abysmally? By a supreme irony, Rand’s gospel also says not only that ‘We are right and they are wrong’ but also that ‘We are rational and they are irrational’. Any logic-checking that considers an alternative viewpoint is ‘irrational’, something to be dismissed out of hand.\n\nIt’s the same for any other puritanical mindset. Only one viewpoint is permitted; and unless you dismiss the alternatives immediately, without stopping to think, you’re impure, aren’t you. You’re a ditherer, a lily-livered moral weakling. You’re in danger of sending a heretical ‘mixed message’ when it’s all about Us Versus Them, Truth Versus Falsehood, Good Versus Evil. That’s the force behind the so-called ‘purity spirals’ seen on social media, in which reasoned debates turn into shouting matches between increasingly polarized factions.\n\n* * *\n\nYes, dichotomization makes us stupid. Luckily, however, dichotomization isn’t all there is. We don’t have to see the world this way. It’s a trap we needn’t fall into. Outside life-threatening emergencies, and far more than your average reptile, we do have the ability to stop and think. We do have the ability to see that while some issues are dichotomous many others are not. We do have the ability to see — oh shock horror — that there might be merit in different viewpoints, helping us to solve real problems. And our hopes of a civilized future will depend, it seems to me, upon strengthening those thinking abilities. In the first edition of this book I ventured to hope that, surprising though it may seem, the social-media giants might, in their own self-interest, help with such strengthening.\n\nFor many years now the social-media giants, beginning with Facebook, have amassed vast wealth and supranational power by using the artificial intelligences, the robots, that they’ve built and trained within their secret ‘large hadron collider of experimental psychology’ as I called it — experimentation on billions of human subjects.23 But even today those robots are not yet very intelligent! In some ways they’re downright stupid. Why do I say that? Because, as currently set up, they pose an existential threat to their own survival along with that of the social media themselves, in their present-day entrepreneurial form.\n\nPart of the threat comes from the way the robots have been trained to exploit the dichotomization instinct, alongside other primitive instincts such as fear, anger, and hatred, to make things go viral — reaching vast audiences and raking in huge profits from advertising revenue. Like or dislike, friend or unfriend, follow or don’t follow, share or don’t share, include or exclude, and so on, are not only addictive, attention grabbing data-gathering devices but also, in their own way, examples of what I called ‘perilous binary buttons’. Press or don’t press, and don’t stop to think. In this and in other ways of shutting off thinking the social-media robots have become, among other things, powerful disinformation-for-profit and hatred-for-profit machines. On a massive and unprecedented scale they’ve amplified fear, anger, hatred, and mental illness, and spread `post-truth' confusion in the form of many alternative ‘realities’.35 Stories that don’t let facts get in the way are much easier to compose than accurate, fact-based stories and — when they’re dramatic, and emotionally charged — are much better at grabbing attention. The more it’s emotionally charged, the faster it spreads, making it more profitable — and more politically exploitable.\n\nAll this has created a new threat to democratic social stability that adds to the older, ongoing threat from gross economic inequality.2 Among their billions of users the robots, functioning at lightning speed, far outstripping the snail’s pace of human moderators, have amplified and expanded the purity spirals, the divisive rhetoric and hatespeech, the misinformed echo chambers, the filter bubbles and preference bubbles, the confusion, and the sheer anger, that’s been turbocharging the vicious binary politics and culture wars we see all around us. Ref. 72 describes recent statistical studies of these phenomena.\n\nIt’s almost as if the social-media giants have been bent on self-destruction. The turbocharged binary politics looks set to replace democracy by brutal autocracy even faster than in the 1920s and 1930s — and this time even at home, even at the nerve centre of the entrepreneurial social media, even in freedom-loving Silicon Valley. Autocracy would destroy the private autonomy of enterprises like Facebook, Meta, and Google. It would destroy the freewheeling, freedom-loving, democratic business environment to which they owe their vast wealth and power. Please don’t get me wrong. The social media have their upside and have brought great benefits of many kinds, such as useful networking and the videos showing kids how to make and repair things — to say nothing of new ways to resist autocracy and to aid high-quality investigative journalism. The threat to democratic social stability was no doubt unintended. But that doesn’t make the threat less real, and less imminent.\n\nThe social-media technocrats must surely have recognized their peril, whatever their financial bosses might think. The technocrats aren’t themselves stupid. There’s a good chance, I think, that they’re trying to make their robots smarter and less socially destabilizing, difficult though the task may be, and difficult though it may be to overcome the short-term profit incentive for destabilization and difficult though it may be — on the technical side — to develop robot-assisted moderation at lightning speed. Social scientists are coming up with further ideas that might help,72 as might new experiments with open-source social media structures like Mastodon, which aim to steer clear of the profit incentive. And the storming of the US Capitol on 6 January 2021 and its threat to turn the USA into an autocracy must, surely, have focused minds, along with the arrival of the new deep-fake disinformation and character-assassination techniques.21\n\nSmarter robots could be a game-changer in helping us humans to get smarter too. They could help us to escape from mindsets instead of being trapped by them. With humans and robots there’s a dystopian mindset that ‘they’ll take over’. But that’s yet another binary trap, another Us Versus Them, based on the ‘singularity fallacy’ — the unconscious assumption that there’s just one kind of intelligence and just one measure of intelligence, putting robots into direct competition with humans. When, instead, humans and robots work together on solving problems, with each playing to their own very different strengths, the combination can become much more powerful and exciting than either alone.\n\nA robot can, so to speak, take on the role of a third ‘brain hemisphere’ to help with problem-solving. Included might even be the problem of maintaining democratic social stability, in all its daunting complexity. Instead of shutting off our thinking, robots could help to open it up. They could, if incentivized in new ways, help us to see things from more than one angle.\n\nAn early example was the famous work of the DeepMind team led by Demis Hassabis, with a robot called AlphaGo. In learning to play the combinatorially large game of Go, it discovered winning game patterns that no human had thought of. And now we have its descendant AlphaFold, which in 2020 made a breakthrough toward solving the combinatorially large, and scientifically important, problem of protein folding55 — the problem of deducing the three-dimensional shapes of protein molecules solely from a knowledge of their DNA, hence amino-acid, sequences in cases where the sequence fixes the shape. One of the robots’ special strengths is complex pattern recognition within vast sets of possibilities.\n\nThe most powerful robots are in some ways, within their limitations, a bit like precocious children. They work by being open to learning. As with human children, we need to get to know them and to get better at teaching them and, above all, better at choosing what to teach them and how best to incentivize them. Should we keep on pushing them to amplify the patterns of social instability, just because it’s lucrative in the short term? Is that a smart thing to do? Or should we push them instead to encourage flexible, versatile lateral thinking, and critical thinking, helping to expose things that might surprise us and even make us a bit uncomfortable? Could they help us to become more skilful and adaptable in future? AlphaGo and AlphaFold suggest that the answer is, in principle at least, a resounding yes.\n\nWe can engage with our own children without knowing the wiring diagrams and patterns of plasticity within their brains. Similarly, we can engage with our robots without knowing what their millions of lines of self-generated computer code look like. And we can get them to help reinforce the more civilized human instincts rather than, as at present, mostly the nastier ones to boost profits. They could for instance do a better job on learning the ever-evolving patterns and contexts of hatespeech and catching it, at lightning speed, before it spreads...\n\n* * TEXT OMITTED FROM THIS PREVIEW * *\n\nChapter 4: Acausality illusions, and the way perception works\n\nPicture a typical domestic scene. “You interrupted me!” “No, you interrupted me!”\n\nSuch stalemates can arise from the fact that perceived times differ from actual physical times in the outside world, as measured by clocks.74 I once tested this experimentally by secretly tape-recording a dinner-table conversation. At one point I was quite sure that my wife had interrupted me, and she was equally sure it had been the other way round. When I listened afterwards to the tape, I discovered to my chagrin that she’d been right. She had started to speak a small fraction of a second before I did.\n\nMusical training includes learning to cope with the differences between perceived times and actual times. For instance musicians often check themselves with a metronome, a small machine that emits precisely regular clicks. The final performance won’t necessarily be metronomic, but practising with a metronome helps to remove inadvertent errors in the fine control of rhythm. “It don’t mean a thing if it ain’t got that swing...”\n\nThere are many other examples. I once heard a radio interviewee recalling how he’d suddenly got into a gunfight: “It all went intuh slowww — motion.” Another example is that of the jazz saxophonist Tony Kofi. At age 16 he fell three stories from a roof-repair job. He describes how he experienced the fall in slow motion, and on the way down had visions of unknown faces and places and saw himself playing an instrument. It was a life-changing experience that made him into a musician.\n\nA scientist who claims to know that eternal life is impossible has failed to notice that perceived timespans at death might stretch to infinity. That, by the way, is a simple example of the limitations of science. What might or might not happen to perceived time at death is a question outside the scope of science, because it’s outside the scope of experiment and observation. It’s here that ancient religious teachings show more wisdom, I think, when they say that deathbed compassion and reconciliation are important to us. Perhaps I should add that, as hinted earlier, I’m not myself conventionally religious. I’m an agnostic whose closest approach to the numinous — to the transcendent, to the divine if you will — has been through music.\n\nSome properties of perceived time are very counterintuitive indeed. They’ve caused much conceptual and philosophical confusion. Besides the ‘slow motion’ experiences there are also, for instance, experiences in which the perceived time of an event precedes the arrival of the sensory data defining the event, sometimes by as much as several hundred milliseconds. At first sight this seems crazy, and in conflict with the laws of physics. Those laws include the principle that cause precedes effect. But the causality principle in physics refers to actual times in the outside world, not to perceived times. The apparent conflict is a perceptual illusion. I’ll call it an ‘acausality illusion’.75\n\nThe existence of acausality illusions — of which music provides outstandingly clear examples, as we’ll see shortly — can be understood from the way perception works. And the way perception works is well illustrated by the walking dots animation (figure 1).\n\nConsider for a moment what the animation tells us. The sensory data are twelve moving dots in a two-dimensional plane. But they’re seen by anyone with normal vision as a person walking — as a particular three-dimensional motion exhibiting organic change. The invariant elements include the number of dots. Also invariant are the distances, in three-dimensional space, between pairs of locations corresponding to particular pairs of dots. There’s no way to make sense of this except to say that the unconscious brain fits to the data an organically-changing internal model that represents the three-dimensional motion, using an unconscious knowledge of three-dimensional Euclidean geometry.\n\nThat by the way is what Kahneman6 calls a ‘fast’ cognitive process, something that happens ahead of conscious thought, and outside our volition. Despite knowing that it’s only twelve moving dots, we have no choice but to see a person walking.\n\nSuch model-fitting has long been recognized by psychologists as an active process involving unconscious prior probabilities, and top-down as well as bottom-up flows of information.37, 76, 77 The ‘top-down’ flow comes from the brain’s repertoire of internal models, with their unconscious prior probabilities. ‘Bottom-up’ refers to the incoming data. For the walking dots the greatest prior probabilities are assigned to a particular class of three-dimensional motions, privileging them over other ways of creating the same two-dimensional dot motion. The active, top-down, model-fitting aspects also show up in neurophysiological studies.78\n\nThe term pattern-seeking is sometimes used to suggest the active nature of the unconscious model-fitting process. So active is our unconscious pattern-seeking that we’re prone to what psychologists call pareidolia, seeing patterns in random images. (People see the devil’s face in a thundercloud, then form a conspiracy theory that the government covered it up.) For the walking dots the significant pattern is four-dimensional, involving as it does the time dimension as well as all three space dimensions. Without the animation, one tends to see no more than a bunch of dots.\n\nAnd what is a ‘model’? In the sense I’m using the word, it’s a partial and approximate representation of reality, or presumed reality. “All models are wrong, but some are useful.” And the most useful models are not only representations, but also ‘prediction engines’ giving a sense of what’s likely to happen next, such as whether or not the person walking will take a further step.\n\nModels are made in a variety of ways. They’re usually made with symbols of one sort or another. The internal model evoked by the walking dots is made by activating some neural circuitry. Patterns of neural activity are symbols. The objects appearing in video games and virtual-reality simulations are models made of electronic circuits and computer code. Computer code is made of symbols. Children’s model boats and houses are made of real materials but are, indeed, models as well as real objects — partial and approximate representations of real boats and houses. Population-genetics models are made of mathematical equations, and computer code usually. So too are models of photons, of air molecules, of black holes, of lightspeed gravitational ripples, and of jet streams and the ozone hole. Any of these models can be more or less accurate, more or less detailed, and more or less predictive. But they’re all partial and approximate. And nearly all of them are made of symbols.\n\nSo ordinary perception, in particular, works by model-fitting. Paradoxical and counterintuitive though it may seem, the thing we perceive is — and can only be — the unconsciously-fitted internal model. And the model has to be partial and approximate because our neural processing power is finite. The whole thing is counterintuitive because it goes against our subjective visual experience of outside-world reality — as not just self-evidently external, but also as direct, clear-cut, unambiguous, and seemingly exact in many cases.\n\nIndeed, that experience is sometimes called ‘veridical’ perception, as if it were perfectly accurate. One often has an impression of sharply-outlined exactness — with such things as the delicate shape of a bee’s wing or a flower petal, the precise geometrical curve of a hanging dewdrop, the sharp edge of the full moon or the sea on a clear day and the magnificence, the sharply-defined jaggedness, of snowy mountain peaks against a clear blue sky.79\n\nRight now I’m using the word ‘reality’ to mean the outside world. Also, I’m assuming that the outside world exists. I’m making that assumption consciously as well as, of course, unconsciously. Notice by the way that ‘reality’ is itself another dangerously ambiguous word. It’s another source of conceptual and philosophical confusion...\n\n* * TEXT OMITTED FROM THIS PREVIEW * *\n\nThe use of echolocation by bats, whales and dolphins is a variation on the same theme. For bats, too, the perceived reality must be the internal model — not the echoes themselves, but a symbolic representation of the bat in its surroundings. It must work in much the same way as our vision except that the bat provides its own illumination. To start answering the famous question ‘what is it like to be a bat’ we could do worse than imagine seeing in the dark with a flashing floodlight, whose rate of flashing can be increased at will.\n\nAnd what is it like to be an octopus? Like any other animal, an octopus needs to be well oriented in its surroundings. So regardless of brain anatomy it needs a single self-model, and an accompanying perception of ‘self’ — not the absurdity of eight or nine separate ‘selves’ as has sometimes been suggested. The anatomy of an octopus, whose brain is spread out across its eight arms, is irrelevant to the question. An entirely different question is where to focus your attention. For us humans, we can focus on what our left fingers and right toes are doing. So I daresay an octopus can focus on what its fifth and seventh arms are doing.\n\nAnd what of the brain’s two hemispheres? Here I must defer to McGilchrist36 and Ramachandran,37 who in their different ways offer a rich depth of understanding coming from neuroscience and neuropsychiatry, far transcending the superficialities of popular culture. For present purposes, McGilchrist’s key point is that having two hemispheres is evolutionarily ancient. Even fish have them. The two hemispheres may have begun with bilateral symmetry in primitive vertebrates but then evolved in different directions. If so, it would be a good example of how neutral genomic changes can later become adaptive.18\n\nA good reason to expect such bilateral differentiation, McGilchrist argues, is that survival is helped by having two different styles of perception. They might be called holistic and fragmented. The evidence shows that the first, holistic style is a specialty of the right hemisphere, and the second a specialty of the left, or vice versa in a minority of people.\n\nIf you’re a pigeon who spots some small objects lying on the ground, then you want to know whether they are, for instance, grains of sand or nutritious seeds. That’s the left hemisphere’s job. It has a style of model-fitting, and a repertoire of internal models, that’s suited to a fragmented, dissected view of the environment, with an intense focus on fine details. The left hemisphere can’t see the wood for the trees. Or, more accurately, it can’t even see a single tree but only, at best, leaves, twigs or buds (which, by the way, might be good to eat). One can begin to see why the left hemisphere is more prone to unconscious mindsets.\n\nBut suppose that you, the pigeon, are busy sorting out seeds from sand grains and that there’s a peculiar flicker in your peripheral vision. Suddenly there’s a feeling that something is amiss. You glance upward just in time to see a bird of prey descending and you abandon your seeds in a flash! That kind of perception is the right hemisphere’s job. The right hemisphere has a very different repertoire of internal models, holistic rather than dissected. They’re fuzzier and vaguer, but with a surer sense of overall spatial relations, such as your body in its surroundings. They’re capable of superfast deployment. The fuzziness, ignoring fine detail, makes for speed when coping with the unexpected. Ref. 36 gives many more examples.\n\nRef. 37 tells us that another of the right hemisphere’s jobs is to watch out for inconsistencies between incoming data and internal models, including any model that’s currently active in the left hemisphere. When the data contradict the model, the left hemisphere has a tendency to reject the data and cling to the model — to be trapped in a delusional mindset. “Don’t distract me; I’m trying to concentrate!” Brain scans show a small part of the right hemisphere that detects such inconsistencies or discrepancies. The right hemisphere can interrupt the left with a wordless “Look out, you’re making a mistake!” If the right hemisphere’s discrepancy detector is damaged, severe delusional mindsets such as anosognosia can result.\n\nRef. 36 points out that the right hemisphere is involved in many subtle and sophisticated games, such as playing with the metaphors that permeate language or, one might even say, that mediate language. So the popular-cultural idea that language is all in the left hemisphere misses many of the deeper aspects of language...\n\n* * TEXT OMITTED FROM THIS PREVIEW * *\n\nAnd what of science itself? What about all those mathematical and computer-coded models of population genetics and of photons, of air molecules, of black holes, of lightspeed gravitational ripples, of jet streams and the ozone hole, of invisible pandemic spreading and of the myriad other entities we deal with in science? Could it be that science itself is always about finding useful models that fit data from the outside world, and never about finding Veridical Absolute Truth? Can science be a quest for truth even if the truth is never Absolute? The next chapter will argue that the answer to the last two questions is an emphatic yes.\n\nTake for instance the physicists’ Holy Grail, the ultimate model or ‘Theory of Everything’ that combines gravity and quantum effects. Suppose we were to find a candidate ultimate model, consistent with everything we know today and described by a single, self-consistent set of mathematical equations. It would still be impossible to test it at infinite accuracy, in an infinite number of cases, and in all parts of the Universe or Universes past, present, and future. Within a smaller, but still wide, domain of applicability one might achieve superlative scientific confidence, with many accurate cross-checks including new predictions subsequently verified. The model might be described by equations of consummate beauty. And that would be wonderful. But in principle there’d be no way to be Absolutely Certain that it’s Absolutely Correct, Absolutely Accurate, and Applicable to Absolutely Everything.\n\nCome to think of it, isn’t that kind of obvious?\n\nChapter 5: What is science?\n\nWhere then does all this lead? I think it leads to something simple yet profound and far-reaching. Let me put it a touch provocatively. I’d like to replace all those books on the philosophy of science by just one simple statement. It not only says what science is, in the most fundamental possible way, but it also clarifies the power and limitations of science. It says that science is an extension of ordinary perception, meaning perception of outside-world reality. Like ordinary perception, science fits models to data from the outside world.\n\nIf that sounds glib and superficial to you, dear reader, then all I ask is that you think again about the sheer wonder of so-called ordinary perception. It too has its power and its limitations, and its fathomless subtleties, agonized over by generations of philosophers.\n\nBoth science and ordinary perception work by fitting models — symbolic representations — to data coming in from the outside world. Both science and ordinary perception must assume that the outside world exists, because it can’t be proven absolutely. Models, and assemblages and hierarchies of models, schemas or schemata as they’re sometimes called, are partial and approximate representations, or candidate representations, of outside-world reality. Those representations can be anything from superlatively accurate and strongly predictive to completely erroneous — like the phlogiston theory of combustion, the microwave theory of COVID-19, and ordinary hallucinations.\n\nThe walking dots animation of figure 1 points to the tip of a vast iceberg, a hierarchy of unconscious internal models and model components starting with the three-dimensional motion itself, but extending all the way to the precise manner of walking and the associated psychological and emotional subtleties. The main difference between science and so-called ordinary perception lies in the range of models used, in the data to be fitted, and in a more explicit focus, by science, on estimating degrees of uncertainty.\n\nIn science today we can harness the power of Bayesian causality theory22 to fit sophisticated models to vast datasets in a logically self-consistent way, using the probabilistic ‘do’ operator to represent the actions of an experimenter. The theory also has a natural way of dealing with uncertainty. Problems of the most daunting complexity are thus beginning to be tractable. Examples include the complex biomolecular circuitry that switches genes on and off,3, 9, 18 and the interplay between small-scale ocean eddies and global-scale circulations and weather systems.81\n\nNotice that all our ways — scientific and ordinary — of perceiving the outside world are ‘theory-laden’ as is sometimes said. One might also say ‘prior-probability-laden’. It’s a necessary aspect of any model-fitting process. Consciously or unconsciously, one has to begin somewhere when selecting models to fit. Consciously or unconsciously, one has to propose some pattern of cause and effect before it can be tested against data.22 Some postmodernist35 philosophers such as Paul Feyerabend have claimed that scientific knowledge is mere opinion, just because it’s theory-laden. The point is missed that some models fit better than others. And some have more predictive power than others. And some are a priori more plausible than others, with more cross-checks to boost their prior probabilities. And some are simpler and more widely applicable than others.\n\nTake for instance Newton’s and Einstein’s models of gravity. Both are partial and approximate representations of reality even though superlatively accurate, superlatively simple, superlatively predictive, and repeatedly cross-checked in countless ways within their very wide domains of applicability — Einstein’s still wider than Newton’s because it includes, for instance, the orbital decay and merging of pairs of black holes or neutron stars and the resulting lightspeed gravitational ripples already mentioned, also called gravitational waves. They are ripples in the structure of spacetime itself, and were first observed in 2015 by the famous ‘LIGO’ detectors.16 Observation of the gravitational ripples has provided yet another cross-check on Einstein’s model — which predicted them over a century ago — and has opened a new window on the Universe.\n\nBoth models are not only simple but also mathematically beautiful. And their high accuracies and predictive powers are crucial, for instance, to all our achievements in space science and space travel. The way a spacecraft moves isn’t a matter of mere opinion...\n\n* * TEXT OMITTED FROM THIS PREVIEW * *\n\nMultiple levels of description are not only basic to science but also, unconsciously, basic to ordinary perception. They’re natural. They’re basic to how our brains work. Straight away, our brains’ left and right hemispheres give us at least two levels of description, a lower level that dissects fine details, and a more holistic higher level.36 And neuroscience has revealed a variety of specialized internal models or model components that symbolically represent different aspects of outside-world reality. In the case of vision there are separate model components representing not only fine detail on the one hand, and overall spatial relations on the other but also, for instance, motion and colour. Damage to a part of the brain dealing with motion can produce visual experiences like successions of snapshots or frozen scenes — merely a nuisance if you’re trying to pour your tea, but very dangerous if you’re trying to cross the road.77 Other kinds of brain damage can produce, for instance, colours floating around by themselves and unattached to objects.85\n\nThe biological sciences well illustrate the need to consider multiple levels of description, and multiple modes of description. I’ve already mentioned molecular-biological regulatory networks, or biomolecular circuits.3, 9, 18 They depend on highly specific interactions amongst a variety of molecules including DNA and protein molecules. Shape-changing protein molecules called ‘allosteric enzymes’ function within biomolecular circuits like transistors within electronic circuits. Biomolecular circuits and their actions, such as switching genes on and off, are impossible to recognize from lower levels such as the level of genes alone, still less from the levels of chemical bonds and bond strengths within thermally-agitated molecules, jiggling around and bumping into each other on timescales of trillionths of a second, and from the still lower levels of atoms, electrons, atomic nuclei, and quarks.\n\nAnd again, there are many higher levels of description within the hierarchy — level upon level, with causal arrows pointing both downward and upward. There are biomolecular circuits and assemblies of such circuits, going up to the levels of archaea, bacteria and their communities, of yeasts, of multicellular organisms, of niche construction and whole ecosystems, and of ourselves and our families, communities, nations, cyberspace and the entire planet — which Newton treated as a point mass.\n\nNone of this would need saying were it not for the persistence — even today — of an extreme-reductionist view of science saying, or assuming, that looking for the lowest possible level and for atomistic ‘units’ such as quarks, or atoms, or genes, gives us the Answer to Everything and is therefore the only useful angle from which to view a problem. Some of the disputes about biological evolution seem have to been disputes about ‘the’ unit of selection58 — as if such a thing could, or should, be uniquely identified within the actual complexity of multi-level selection. Yes, in many cases reductionism can be enormously useful; but no, it isn’t the Answer to Everything!\n\nIn some scientific problems, including those I’ve worked on myself, the most useful models aren’t at all atomistic. In fluid dynamics we use accurate ‘continuum-mechanics’ models in which highly nonlocal, indeed long-range, interactions are crucial. They’re mediated by the pressure field. They’re a crucial part of, for instance, how birds, bees and aircraft stay aloft, how a jet stream can circumscribe and contain the ozone hole, and how waves and vortices interact.31, 86\n\nMcGilchrist’s work tells us that extreme reductionism comes from our left hemispheres. It is indeed a highly dissected view of things. His book36 can be read as a passionate appeal for more pluralism — for more of Max Born’s loosening of thinking — for the more powerful, in-depth understanding that can come from looking at things on more than one level and from more than one viewpoint, while respecting the evidence. Such understanding requires a better collaboration, says McGilchrist, between our garrulous and domineering left hemispheres and our quieter, indeed wordless, but also passionate, right hemispheres (or vice versa in a minority of people).\n\nSurely, then, professional codes of conduct for scientists — to say nothing of lucidity principles as such — should encourage us to be more explicit than we feel necessary regarding, in particular, which level or levels of description we’re talking about. And when the levels of description aren’t clear, or when the questions asked are ‘wicked questions’ having no clear meaning at all, still less any clear answer, it would help to say so.\n\nSuch an approach might also be helpful when confronted by all the confusion, and wicked questions, about consciousness and free will. I want to stay off those topics — having already had a go at them in ref. 75 — except to say that some of the confusion seems to come first from not recognizing the existence of acausality illusions, and second from conflating different levels of description. I like the aphorism that “free will is a biological illusion but a social reality”. There’s no conflict between the two statements once they’re recognized as belonging to different levels of description.87 The same goes for statements like “This individual is biologically a man, but mentally and socially a woman.”\n\nAnd once again we’re reminded of the ambiguity, the context-dependence, and the multi-level aspects of the word ‘reality’. I ask again, is music real? is religious experience real? Is mathematics real? Is our DNA real? Is the outside world real? Is our sense of self and gender real? For me, at least, they’re all real but in different senses, relevant at different levels, that keep on being confused with one another. And one of life’s realities is that pragmatic functioning at the mental and social levels depends on accepting our sense of self and gender — our internal self-model — as an entity having, or seeing itself as having, free will or volition or agency as it’s variously called. It wouldn’t do to be able to commit murder and then, like a present-day Hamlet, to say to the jury “T’wasn’t me, t’was my selfish genes did it.”\n\nChapter 6: Music, mathematics, and the Platonic\n\nThe walking dots show that we have unconscious Euclidean geometry. We also have unconscious calculus. Calculus illustrates one of the most wonderful and surprising things about mathematics, namely that a pattern helpful in solving one problem — such as predicting the path of a tennis ball — later becomes key to solving different problems at first sight unrelated, such as understanding electric currents and power grids.\n\nCalculus is the mathematics of continuous change. For instance it deals with objects like those in figure 7:\n\nFigure 7: Some smooth ‘mathematical’ curves.\n\nSuch objects are made of smooth curves — pathways whose direction changes continuously, the curves that everyone calls ‘mathematical’. They include perfect circles, ellipses, and portions thereof, among countless other examples. A straight line is the special case having zero rate of change of direction. A circle has a constant rate of change of direction, and an ellipse has a rate of change that’s itself changing, and so on.\n\nSuch ‘Platonic objects’, as I’ll call them, are of special interest to the unconscious brain. Whenever one sees natural phenomena exhibiting what look like straight lines or smooth curves, such as the edge of the sea on a clear day, or the edge of the full moon, or the shape of a hanging dewdrop, they tend to excite our sense of something special, and beautiful. So do the great pillars of the Parthenon, and the smooth curves of the Sydney Opera House seen from a distance. We feel their shapes as resonating with something ‘already there’.\n\nPlato felt that the world of such ‘mathematical’ objects, shapes, or forms, and the many other beautiful entities found in mathematics, is in some sense a world more real than the outside world with its commonplace messiness. He felt his world of perfect mathematical forms to be something timeless — something already there and always there.\n\nMy heart is with Plato here, on an emotional level. When the shapes, or forms, look truly perfect, they can excite a sense of great wonder and mystery. So too can the mathematical equations describing them. How can such immutable perfection exist at all, and why do we find it awesome?\n\nIndeed, so powerful is our unconscious interest in such perfection that we see smooth curves even when they’re not actually present in the incoming visual data. For instance we see them in the form of what psychologists call ‘illusory contours’. Figure 8 is an example. If you stare at the inner edges of the messy black marks for several seconds, and if you have normal vision, you’ll see an exquisitely smooth curve joining them:\n\nFigure 8: An illusory contour. To see it, stare at the inner edges of the black marks.\n\nThat curve is not present on the screen or on the paper. It’s constructed by your visual system. To construct it, the system unconsciously solves a problem in calculus — in the branch of it called the calculus of variations. The problem is to consider all the possible curves that can be fitted to the inner edges of the black marks, and to pick out the curve that’s as smooth as possible, in a sense to be specified. The smoothness is specified using some combination of rates of change of direction, and rates of change of rates of change, and so on, averaged along each curve. The smaller the rates of change, the greater the smoothness. So we have an unconscious calculus of variations. And that in turn gets us closer to some of the deepest parts of theoretical physics, as we’ll see shortly.\n\nThe existence of the Platonic world glimpsed in figures 7 and 8 is no surprise from an evolutionary perspective. It is, indeed, already there. It’s already there in the sense of being evolutionarily ancient — something that comes to us through genetic memory and the automata that it enables — genetically-enabled automata that can self-organize or self-assemble into, among other things, the special kinds of symbolic representation that correspond to Platonic objects.\n\nOver vast stretches of time, natural selection has put the unconscious brain under pressure to make its model-fitting processes as simple as the data allow. That requires a repertoire of internal model components that are as simple as possible. Some of those components are Platonic objects, smooth curves or portions of smooth curves or, rather, their internal symbolic representations. Please remember that actual or latent patterns of neural activity are symbols — and we are now talking about mathematical symbols — even though we don’t yet have the ability to read them directly from the brain’s neural networks.\n\nA perfect circle, then, is a Platonic object simply because it’s simple. And the illusory contour in figure 8 shows that the brain’s model-fitting process assigns the highest prior probabilities to models representing objects with the simplest possible outlines consistent with the data, in this case a light-coloured object with a smooth outline sitting in front of some smaller dark objects. That’s part of how the visual system distinguishes an object from its background, an important part of making sense of the visual scene.8, 76, 77, 80 Making sense of the visual scene has been crucial to survival for hundreds of millions of years — crucial to navigation, crucial to finding mates, and crucial to eating and not being eaten. Many of the objects to be distinguished have outlines that are more or less smooth. They range from distant hills down to fruit and leaves, tusks and antlers, and teeth and claws.\n\n“We see smooth curves even when they’re not actually present.” Look closely at figure 7. None of the Platonic objects we see are actually present in the figure. Take the circle on the left, or ellipse as it may appear on some screens. It’s actually more complex. With a magnifying glass, one can see small-scale roughness. Zooming in more and more, one begins to see more and more detail. One can imagine zooming in to the atomic, nuclear and subnuclear scales. Long before that, one encounters the finite scales of the retinal cells in our eyes. Model-fitting is partial and approximate. What’s complex at one level can be simple at another. Perfectly smooth curves are things belonging not to the incoming sensory data but rather — I emphasize again — to the unconscious brain’s repertoire of internal model components.\n\nSo I’m suggesting that the Platonic world is very different from what Plato, and others, seem to have imagined.82, 84 Rather than being timeless, it’s only hundreds of millions of years old. Rather than being external to us, it’s very internal. It’s something arising from natural selection. It’s part of the unconscious mathematics we need in order to survive. But to me that’s still wonderful, indeed even more wonderful because, for one thing, it makes a lot more sense.\n\n* * *\n\nThe calculus of variations is a gateway to some of the deepest parts of theoretical physics. That’s because it leads to Noether’s theorem. The theorem depends on writing the equations of physics in what’s called ‘variational’ form. That’s a form allowing the calculus of variations to be used. It’s Richard Feynman’s own example of things that are mathematically equivalent but, as he said, “psychologically very different”.\n\nThink of playing tennis on the Moon. Air resistance is assumed negligible. After being hit, the ball moves solely under the Moon’s gravity. One way to model such motion is to use calculus in the form of Newton’s equations. They deal with the moment-to-moment rates of change of quantities like the position and velocity of the tennis ball. In our lunar example, solving those equations produces a pathway for the tennis ball in the form of a smooth curve, very close to what’s called a parabola. Since the equations describe what happens from moment to moment, one must construct the curve bit by bit, starting at one end.\n\nHowever — and this might seem surprising — the same smooth curve can also be constructed as the solution to a variational problem. It’s a problem more like that of figure 8 because it treats the curve holistically, rather than bit by bit. It deals with all parts of the curve simultaneously. That’s psychologically very different indeed...\n\n* * TEXT OMITTED FROM THIS PREVIEW * *\n\nMusic has its own Platonic objects. Prominent among them are the special sets of musical pitches called harmonic series. An example is shown in figure 9, where the leftmost black square points to an audio clip sounding the pitches one after another:\n\nFigure 9: A musical harmonic series. The first black square, on the left, points to an audio clip sounding these harmonic-series pitches. The second and third black squares point to audio clips of some of the pitches sounded together (see text). The first and lowest pitch, called the ‘fundamental’ or ‘first harmonic’, corresponds in this case to a vibration frequency 65.4Hz (65.4 cycles per second), the second pitch or harmonic to twice this, 130.8Hz, and the third to three times, 196.2Hz, and so on. The fundamental pitch and its octave harmonics, the 2nd, 4th, 8th and so on all have the same musical name C or Doh. If you happen to have a tunable electronic keyboard and would like to tune it to agree with the harmonic series, then you need to sharpen the 3rd, 6th and 12th harmonics by 2 cents (2/100 of a semitone) and the 9th by 4 cents — these differences are barely audible — but also to flatten the 5th and 10th by 14 cents (audible to a good musical ear), the 7th by 31 cents, and the 11th by 49 cents, relative to B flat and F sharp. The last two changes are plainly audible to just about anyone. The differences arise from the fact that the standard keyboard tuning, called ‘equal temperament’, divides the octave into twelve exactly equal ‘semitones’ with frequency ratios 21/12 = 1.059463. Equal temperament is musically useful because of a peculiar accident of arithmetic. That’s the tiny, practically inaudible 2-cent difference between the 3rd harmonic and its equal-tempered approximation, whose frequency is 27/12 = 1.49831, very nearly 3/2, times the frequency of the 2nd harmonic. The tuning of the 3rd harmonic pitch, relative to the 2nd, has critical importance in most genres of music.\n\nThe defining property of a harmonic series is that the pitches correspond to vibration frequencies equal to the lowest frequency, in this case 65.4Hz (65.4 cycles per second), multiplied by a whole number such as 1, 2, 3, etc.\n\nA harmonic series is a ‘Platonic object’ in just the same sense as before, something that’s evolutionarily ancient and of special interest to the unconscious brain. How can that be? The answer will emerge shortly, when we consider how hearing works. And it will expose more connections between music and mathematics. But first, please be sure to listen to the sounds themselves (first or leftmost audio clip in figure 9). Do they not hint at something special and beautiful? Something that could divert you, and Plato, from mundane messiness? Hints of fairy horn calls, perhaps? However they strike you, these sounds are special to the musical brain.\n\nAlso special are subsets of these sounds played together. For instance if those numbered 4, 5 and 6 are played together — they are called the 4th, 5th, and 6th harmonic pitches — then we hear the familiar sound of what musicians call a major chord, or major triad (second audio clip in figure 9). If we play instead the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 8th, and 16th together, then it sounds like a more spacious version of the same chord — more like the grand, thunderous chord that opens the Star Wars music (third audio clip in figure 9). If on the other hand we play the 6th, 7th, 9th and 10th together then we get what has famously been called the ‘Tristan chord’ (first audio clip in figure 10):\n\nFigure 10: Audio clips of the Tristan chord made up of the 6th, 7th, 9th and 10th harmonic pitches shown in figure 9. The first clip (black square on the left) is the chord played with accurate harmonic-series tunings, as detailed in the caption to figure 9. The second clip is the same chord in standard keyboard or equal-tempered tuning. If the first clip is played loudly, through a distorting audio system, then one usually hears not only the chord but also a low C corresponding to the 1st or 2nd harmonic. That’s a consequence of the chord being accurately tuned to the harmonic series. The third clip (black square on the right) sounds the chord in the spaced-out version used by Richard Wagner in the opening of Tristan und Isolde (see text), in equal-tempered tuning, along with the subsequent organic harmony changes that complete the opening phrase.\n\nThe first chord heard in Richard Wagner’s opera Tristan und Isolde is a spaced-out version of the same chord, formed by moving the 7th and 9th harmonics down an octave and the 10th down by two octaves (third audio clip in figure 10). Some people think that Wagner invented the chord, even though it was actually invented — I’d rather say discovered — much earlier. For instance the chord occurs more than twenty times, in various spacings, in another famous piece of music, Dido’s Lament, written by Henry Purcell about two centuries before Tristan...\n\n* * TEXT OMITTED FROM THIS PREVIEW * *\n\nBut — I hear you ask — why are these particular sets of pitches, such as those of figure 9, so special to the brain, and what has all this to do with evolution and natural se"
