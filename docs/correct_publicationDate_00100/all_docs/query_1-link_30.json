The people of this nation hold a prophecy that involves a team of strangers as harbingers of either death or salvation.\n\nWhen a massive flood threatens the island, chaos ensues, and the team faces a series of unexpected challenges. Conflicting information from various team members only adds to the confusion.\n\nAs the reluctant leader of the group, Marty must make a difficult choice between saving the lives of an ancient nation and those of his team members.\n\nUltimately, the fate of the world rests on his decision.\n\nAt the publisher's request, this title is sold without DRM (Digital Rights Management).\n\nBook two in the Ice Trials LitRPG series from best-selling author M.A. Rothman and D.J.
