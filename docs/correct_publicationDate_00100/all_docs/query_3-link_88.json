        "text": "A concise examination of the origin of the universe.\n\nMost readers find it difficult to imagine a universe that has existed forever, but it’s equally hard to imagine it popping out of nowhere 14 billion years ago. Rothman, a physicist and former editor at Scientific American, points out that until the early 20th century, astronomers believed that the heavens were vast and unchanging. Once they learned that the universe was expanding, some simply rewound the clock. This required a Big Bang, but without concrete evidence, other theorists proposed a steady-state universe in which galaxies simply appeared to fill the voids as others receded. This changed after 1965, when astronomers discovered cosmic microwave background radiation. The universe has a temperature. Since it’s expanding, it’s cooling, so it was hotter in the past when it was denser. This killed the steady-state theory, and countless provocative questions have followed, some of which seem embarrassing—e.g., “What came before the big bang?” One of Rothman’s advisers once told him, “If you ask a stupid question you may feel stupid. If you don’t ask a stupid question, you remain stupid.” Readers will not remain stupid after this book, but those curious about black holes, exploding stars, and extrasolar planets must look elsewhere because Rothman concentrates on the big picture, focusing on gravity, the force controlling the fate of the universe, and Einstein, the first to get gravity right. Einstein’s masterful theory of general relativity describes our universe on the large scale but requires quantum theory for behavior at the atomic scale, and the theory fails to explain what happened at the instant of the Big Bang or why ordinary matter makes up only 5% of the universe. Although illustrations are simple and equations absent, Rothman offers mostly clear explanations of complex concepts, including quantum gravity string theory and the nature of dark matter and energy.\n\nLucid and informative.\n\nA warts-and-all portrait of the famed techno-entrepreneur—and the warts are nearly beyond counting.\n\nTo call Elon Musk (b. 1971) “mercurial” is to undervalue the term; to call him a genius is incorrect. Instead, Musk has a gift for leveraging the genius of others in order to make things work. When they don’t, writes eminent biographer Isaacson, it’s because the notoriously headstrong Musk is so sure of himself that he charges ahead against the advice of others: “He does not like to share power.” In this sharp-edged biography, the author likens Musk to an earlier biographical subject, Steve Jobs. Given Musk’s recent political turn, born of the me-first libertarianism of the very rich, however, Henry Ford also comes to mind. What emerges clearly is that Musk, who may or may not have Asperger’s syndrome (“Empathy did not come naturally”), has nurtured several obsessions for years, apart from a passion for the letter X as both a brand and personal name. He firmly believes that “all requirements should be treated as recommendations”; that it is his destiny to make humankind a multi-planetary civilization through innovations in space travel; that government is generally an impediment and that “the thought police are gaining power”; and that “a maniacal sense of urgency” should guide his businesses. That need for speed has led to undeniable successes in beating schedules and competitors, but it has also wrought disaster: One of the most telling anecdotes in the book concerns Musk’s “demon mode” order to relocate thousands of Twitter servers from Sacramento to Portland at breakneck speed, which trashed big parts of the system for months. To judge by Isaacson’s account, that may have been by design, for Musk’s idea of creative destruction seems to mean mostly chaos.\n\nAlternately admiring and critical, unvarnished, and a closely detailed account of a troubled innovator.\n\nYes: it's high time for a de-romanticized, de-mythified, close-up retelling of the U.S. Space Program's launching—the inside story of those first seven astronauts.\n\nBut no: jazzy, jivey, exclamation-pointed, italicized Tom Wolfe \"Mr. Overkill\" hasn't really got the fight stuff for the job. Admittedly, he covers all the ground. He begins with the competitive, macho world of test pilots from which the astronauts came (thus being grossly overqualified to just sit in a controlled capsule); he follows the choosing of the Seven, the preparations for space flight, the flights themselves, the feelings of the wives; and he presents the breathless press coverage, the sudden celebrity, the glorification. He even throws in some of the technology. But instead of replacing the heroic standard version with the ring of truth, Wolfe merely offers an alternative myth: a surreal, satiric, often cartoony Wolfe-arama that, especially since there isn't a bit of documentation along the way, has one constantly wondering if anything really happened the way Wolfe tells it. His astronauts (referred to as \"the brethren\" or \"The True Brothers\") are obsessed with having the \"right stuff\" that certain blend of guts and smarts that spells pilot success. The Press is a ravenous fool, always referred to as \"the eternal Victorian Gent\": when Walter Cronkite's voice breaks while reporting a possible astronaut death, \"There was the Press the Genteel Gent, coming up with the appropriate emotion. . . live. . . with no prompting whatsoever!\" And, most off-puttingly, Wolfe presumes to enter the minds of one and all: he's with near-drowing Gus Grissom (\"Cox. . . That face up there!—it's Cox. . . Cox knew how to get people out of here! . . . Cox! . . .\"); he's with Betty Grissom angry about not staying at Holiday Inn (\"Now. . . they truly owed her\"); and, in a crude hatchet-job, he's with John Glenn furious at Al Shepard's being chosen for the first flight, pontificating to the others about their licentious behavior, or holding onto his self-image during his flight (\"Oh, yes! I've been here before! And I am immune! I don't get into corners I can't get out of! . . . The Presbyterian Pilot was not about to foul up. His pipeline to dear Lord could not be clearer\"). Certainly there's much here that Wolfe is quite right about, much that people will be interested in hearing: the P-R whitewash of Grissom's foul-up, the Life magazine excesses, the inter-astronaut tensions. And, for those who want to give Wolfe the benefit of the doubt throughout, there are emotional reconstructions that are juicily shrill.\n\nBut most readers outside the slick urban Wolfe orbit will find credibility fatally undermined by the self-indulgent digressions, the stylistic excesses, and the broadly satiric, anti-All-American stance; and, though The Right Stuff has enough energy, sass, and dirt to attract an audience, it mostly suggests that until Wolfe can put his subject first and his preening writing-persona second, he probably won't be a convincing chronicler of anything much weightier than radical chic."
