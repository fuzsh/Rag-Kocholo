        "text": "Pan Open Letters Review This kind of flat mumbling happens throughout The Throne, even at moments that are meant to be the dramatic high points of the book ... Everything posterity knows about Machiavelli or thinks it knows is front-loaded onto the innocent year 1502, when no one knew those things and all the tension of Machiavelli not knowing those things is simply ignored.\n\nRave Open Letters Review Brettschneider writes the stories of his five examples with a very enjoyable mixture of gravitas and readability. His readings of his various historical backgrounds feel wonderfully thorough.\n\nPositive Open Letters Review A generous, pleasantly hefty volume ... This collection is about the poetry, although there’s some prose as well, channeling the author’s inimitable (or maybe all too imitable) combination of free-wheeling egotism and a critical reflex that even the author’s titanic efforts at self-destruction couldn’t ever quite extinguish.\n\nMixed Open Letters Review The underlying problem at the heart of Literary Theory for Robots is the irreconcilable conflict between the goal of the book and the goal of its author. The goal of a book like this is to educate the non-specialist reader about the nuances of AI’s interaction with the literary and artistic worlds of human creativity. But the goal of its author is pretty clearly to thrill-frighten a TED talk audience already tipsy on afternoon white wine.\n\nPositive Open Letters Review Takes an informed, readable look at the torturous history of copyright ... Important.\n\nPan Open Letters Review Virtually every noun or phrase this author uses reminds her of something else, and she describes those distractions in detail, every single time, whether or not they belong in the book’s narrative ... This is grotesquely self-indulgent on the part of the author, and it shows up right away in the book ... If you’re lucky while laboring through a poetic miasma, you might bark your shin against a random good passage now and again.\n\nPositive Open Letters Review \\\"The more she’s enveloped by ordinary life, the more distant and uncommunicative her alien superiors become. Almost against her will, almost while she’s not paying attention, Adina becomes human whether she understands it or not, and Bertino’s strange, memorable narrative becomes increasingly moving. By the time the human experience of grief reaches her, readers have been so caught up in her watery strangeness that these scenes hit like a freight train, combining sharp insight with Bertino’s unblinkingly observant prose ... Beautyland offers no easy conclusions, either to Adina’s story or humanity’s, but it works with increasing strength as a portrait of the weirdly widespread alienation of the 21st century. Perhaps it’s fitting that Adina herself never quite coalesces as a character, despite how badly she wants to.\\\n\nPositive Open Letters Review \\\"She fills her 300 pages with, yes, spirited defenses of Margaret Cavendish but also thoughtful and sometimes insightful discussions of her many works and the events of her times ... There are extended readings of every major work and a good deal of commentary...and there are plenty of well-done historical set pieces about the various stages of Margaret’s life. As a biography, much less a debut biography, it’s credible and very engaging.\\\n\nPositive Open Letters Review The central contention of Planta Sapiens is that plants are people ... All of which raises loud questions that Calvo and Lawrence see and echo but spend comparatively little time trying to answer.\n\nRave Open Letters Review Scrupulous and involving ... A deep-breath kind of spotlight, a much-needed assessment of the man and his lifelong passions ... Freedman’s book is elaborately sourced and annotated. His Acknowledgements section starts out silly and quickly becomes preposterous ... But the finished product speaks for itself: short of a full-dress volume to enhance or supplant Arnold Offner’s thoroughly excellent biography from 2018, this is the best insight into Humphrey’s true significance in the new century.\n\nRave Open Letters Review \\\"The many, many fans of Jennifer Ackerman’s 2016 bestseller The Genius of Birds were likely bird-people, if not actual birders then certainly bird-curious, and those readers might have dreamed that this author would some day turn her attention specifically to one of the most charismatic of all birds, the owl. Those readers, and all the many thousands of others who’ve always been fascinated by these birds, will rejoice at the appearance of Ackerman’s new book ... on this ‘did you know’ level, Ackerman’s book is predictable, although every bit as glowingly readable as everything else she’s written ... Owls endlessly fascinate humans; owls can befriend humans; owls certainly need the conservation help of humans. They can look us straight in the eyes, and they very much warrant a book as thoughtful and engrossing as this one, another great bird-book from Ackerman.\\\n\nRave Open Letters Review [Turner] makes no pretense of examining all of those adaptations and interpretations in these pages; rather, she concentrates on an illustrative handful and explores them in depth. It’s fun, thought-provoking popular scholarship at its best ... [Turner\\'s] interest in and affection for the Wife is so consistently apparent and inviting that it makes the book feel like equal parts travelogue and dialogue.\n\nMixed Open Letters Review These are ingredients for a slalom-paced police-procedural, but if you’re expecting to get that in these pages, this is clearly your first go-round with the weird sub-genre of Scandi Noir. Like its predecesso...You Will Never Be Found puts out all the ingredients for a feast, works up both the hunger and the interest of its guests, the readers, and then goes for a long, ruminative, and solitary walk ... At least the ingredients are high-quality ... Readers already addicted to the half-light and lowering snow of Scandinavian Noir will eagerly consume You Will Never Be Found, the latest from a rising star of the sub-genre. Everybody else might want to think about taking a reading vacation to the French Riviera or sunny Italy.\n\nRave Open Letters Review ... Olubas has given readers the towering and richly empathetic biography this recondite author has always deserved ... That long relationship is the heartbeat of the book, and its incremental decline gives these pages an autumnal feeling even as early as the half-way point ... Among its many other joys, this big biography reveals Hazzard’s 2000 memoir Greene on Capri as even more of a plangently joyful masterpiece than it seemed at the time ... turning up revelations and shards of insight so regularly that the reader starts to expect them. This obviously can only happen if the right subject has met just the right chronicler, and that’s what happened here. Virtually every chapter is full of photographic vignettes that are skillfully pulled together from all the sources at the author’s disposal, and all of them put the reader right in the moment.\n\nRave Christian Science Monitor Reading any account of the crisis, much less one as accessible and involving as this crafted by Hastings, always provokes a graveyard chill ... This author has always had a talent for drawing vivid characters, and his various sympathies are clear throughout the narrative.\n\nMixed Open Letters Review A novel full of academic theory and jargon ... People don’t talk like this – except in this book, where they scarcely talk any other way, because the author’s stand-in doesn’t see much of a difference between theory and fiction ... There’s certainly not much difference between the narrator and the white supremacist heteropatriarchal capitalist bigotries he’s forever – honestly, forever – droning on about ... One of the minor annoyances of A Minor Chorus is that it almost tells an interesting story. The narrator’s childhood friend from the Cree reservation, Jack, leads a tough, defeated life actually experiencing the racism and discrimination the narrator never does. His story wouldn’t have been a simple copy-and-paste vanity exercise from the author’s own social media posts.\n\nPositive Open Letters Review Like everything else this author has written, it’s simply beautifully done, with sharp, arresting language and imagery on every page. It’s the story of McCracken’s mother, realized in a supple combination of obviously treasured family memories and the author’s warm but pitiless reflections on those memories. Those memories make unfailingly good stories ... These are touching memories, but the publisher has stamped \\'A Novel\\' on the dust jacket of this book, and McCracken herself periodically steps out of the narrative just long enough to tell her readers that they’re reading a work of fiction, not a memoir.\n\nRave Open Letters Review Fortunately, her good sense saves her; in these pages, she sticks Goethe (who only visited Jena, after all, but never actually signed a lease in town) firmly in the midst of a big cast — and because no other member of that cast is as obdurately monumental as Goethe (the only one who comes close is the poet Novalis), the larger narrative of Magnificent Rebels is saved ... In fact, the larger narrative of Magnificent Rebels is downright terrific, every bit as thoroughly researched as The Invention of Nature but even livelier and more evocative in its human details ... Wulf is succinct and interesting on the various forces that crafted the moment she’s brought to life ... She’s also interesting, if a touch less convincing, on the seminal impact of all that Jena squabbling on the course of Western thought ... There’s an undeniable fascination to reading the daily goings-on of these passionate, brilliant people, especially when their outsized personalities are so wonderfully captured.\n\nPan Open Letters Review ... preserves both the original’s leaden, portentous title and, as an added bonus for the $20 asking price, every other word in this limp and boring bit of memoir is likewise leaden and portentous. And once again, the fault cannot be laid at the feet of the translator; Tash Aw has done everything human ingenuity can do to flush some life into these dead-lily pages. No, it’s the author’s original French that rolls half-upright on its afternoon couch, looks around, and blandly waits to be applauded for at least seeming to be semi-conscious ... If you’ve ever endured the tedium of being slowly, methodically toured through the minutiae of somebody else’s family photo album, you’ll have some sense of what it’s like to read A Woman’s Battles and Transformations (horrifyingly, the book even includes blurry black-and-white family photos). The element Louis adds to that mundane experience is a kind of grim Gallic swampishness, the implication – entirely incorrect – that a universe of profundity can be squeezed out of any old madeleine ... The consistent attempt here is to inhabit the interior experiences of our author’s mother, but Louis, bless his truant heart, doesn’t try very hard ... likewise familiar is the lazy, shorthand-jotted prose ... In the end, for all its surface-level attention to a downtrodden woman married to a brutish man, A Woman’s Battles and Transformations will prompt readers to ask the same question they’ve asked after each of this author’s books: will Édouard Louis ever write a book that isn’t about the sad fact that some people teased him when he was fifteen? Surely the French have a phrase for \\'Don’t hold your breath\\'?\n\nMixed Open Letters Review The basic realities of blood — that it’s pumped by the heart, that it circulates throughout the body, that it carries nutrients vital to life — occupy a strange duality in the lore of human knowledge...For millennia, the basics of volume, production, and all of that pumping were known with intimate familiarity by every marketplace butcher, midwife, and battlefield soldier on the planet...And yet the actual mechanics that every school child and casual amateur knows today (a moviegoer ignorant of biology will instantly know if a bloody wound on-screen “looks real”) were mysteries to those front-line witnesses and to bookish theorizers alike...The story of that slow, piecemeal discovery is the subject of Dhun Sethna’s new book, The Wine-Dark Sea Within...Sethna, an academic cardiologist and contributor to a widely-used cardiology textbook, here takes readers on a brief and necessarily fast-paced tour of how humans learned about the fuel that makes their lives possible...But although other figures abound, the book’s real hero is William Harvey, the caustic, brilliant 17th-century English physician who was the great pioneer of understanding blood and the circulation of blood...Sethna’s portrait of Harvey is quick and frustratingly glib, and although he goes into greater detail as he brings the story down closer to the present day, the glibness sticks around at the same shrill radio-in-the-barber-shop volume...Some of those readers will doubtless opt out of The Wine-Dark Sea Within and drop it in favor of, for instance, Five Quarts by Bill Hayes...The ones who stick around will get some of the benefits of Sethna’s medical expertise, but they’ll have to hack their way through quite a bit of frothing exuberance to get to it.\n\nPositive The Open Letters Review Fans of the poet and completists of his works will zero in on this book fairly automatically...Casual or more generalist readers might encounter some rougher sledding, since the only two people who seem to care more about the minutiae of Lowell’s distant ancestors twice removed than Lowell himself are his two editors this time around, Steve Gould Axelrod and Grzegorz Kosc ... Fortunately, no matter how many Noah’s Arks of Starks we get taxonomized in such clarifications, and no matter how often Lowell himself makes the same mistake all memoirists do — presuming their life is interesting — virtually every page of this fascinating book has the same saving grace: Lowell’s brilliance as a writer. Long-time readers of his poetry will already be familiar with the sometimes oddly shuffling prose-like tempo that infuses so much of it. Now those readers and everybody else can read 400 pages that prove what they must already have suspected, that the same is true in reverse: even at a young age, Lowell could put the sheen of poetry’s incipience on even the most humdrum prose patches ... everything here is worth revisiting, in large part for the superb blending of insight and cattiness ... what a pretty, endlessly interesting set all these volumes make: the collected letters, the collected prose, the collected autobiographical writings, and of course the only thing that really matters, the collected poems. And if the bored, bit-drill eyes of the little twerp on the cover promise trouble, well, that, too is a professional requirement, if the poet’s any good.\n\nRave Open Letters Review Even though Eliot is well shy of middle age at the start of this book, it’s still very much Old Eliot from first page to last ... The lives of poets often make for grim reading, and in this as in so much else, Eliot often outdoes his peers and progenitors ... Crawford completely succeeds. His two volumes combine to form the best life of TS Eliot by such a wide margin that it’s difficult to imagine any future biography equaling, let alone surpassing it. It’s not a happy story, but it’s complex, contradictory messiness is almost hypnotizing.\n\nRave Open Letters Review I Used To Live Here Once: The Haunted Life of Jean Rhys...takes a more thoughtfully plangent approach to its subject than any previous biographical attempt ... Two things become obvious fairly quickly while reading this ghost story. The first is that Seymour has thoroughly researched every last moment of her subject’s life, never resting on consensus and (wisely) never completely trusting Rhys herself about anything. At every turn, even on comparatively minor matters, Seymour seems to have read everything and weighed it all carefully ... The second very noticeable thing about this book is its most pleasant surprise: the crisp, punchy eloquence of Seymour’s own prose.\n\nRave The Christian Science Monitor ... captivating ... Amid plenty of tossed-off bits of fascinating trivia, Randall keeps his eye on the larger picture.\n\nMixed The Open Letters Review ... sets an off-puttingly narrow framing for a book billing itself as a full-dress biography ... In his Note on Sources, Zunz cites his own work (this pernicious academic habit is persistently annoying; as schoolchildren are constantly told, you cannot cite yourself as a source). The book has no Bibliography (another widespread plague; if you want to know the works Zunz used, you’ll have to comb through his 60 pages of End Notes and assemble one on your own) ... Likely nobody alive knows the details of Tocqueville’s political thinking better than Zunz does, which probably accounts for how ready the narrative is in these pages to veer from biography to ideological discussion and back. The dates and locations and people of Tocqueville’s life are all here, from weak lungs to fervent love to the man’s persistent ability to make friends and keep them, but the daily life feels distinctly subordinated to the political theorizing. Reading The Man Who Understood Democracy will leave you with a far better sense of what Tocqueville thought than who Tocqueville was. That may be entirely fitting, but readers who come to biography for more flesh and blood should know about it ahead of time either way.\n\nMixed Open Letters Review If readers encountering Wall Street Journal reporter Tripp Mickle’s new book can get past the whopper in right there in the title – the US Supreme Court notwithstanding, companies don’t have souls – they’re in for a reading experience that’s in equal measures fascinating and subtly soiling ... And always, the book returns to that weird notion, the \\'soul\\' of a phone company. Gradually, over the course of many well-researched and sleekly-written chapters (no book on such a subject has any business being this wonderfully readable), Cook’s pragmatic, materialistic approach transforms Apple into a place where Ive feels like an alien, even though he’s never explicitly alienated by anybody ... That’s where the soiling part breaks in throughout the book, the implication that this pallid Gradgrind sullied the non-financial \\'soul\\' of Apple by turning it into a multi-trillion-dollar company. This is the kind of Saint’s Life that’s only possible in a world of what online commenters refer to as \\'late-stage capitalism.\\' After Steve wallows in this kind of soteriological parsing, and that aspect of the book is purely revolting even though the book itself is tremendously enjoyable. True believers will finish it and gaze at their iPhones with renewed affection – until the new model drops.\n\nRave The Christian Science Monitor Montgomery, whose 2010 book The Soul of an Octopus made her a favorite of animal-book readers, turns her formidable descriptive passion to hawks, and to the world of falconry ... Readers who share Montgomery’s original empathy and compassion for animals might want to proceed cautiously. The protracted, dramatic set-piece that serves as the book’s climax is Montgomery’s evocative description of a field hunt ... Fortunately, there’s plenty of compensation. The book breathes with glorious prose and challenging insights into a very strange world. In The Hawk’s Way, Sy Montgomery and her publisher have crafted a sharp little gem of a book, something fit to stand with classics like T.H. White’s The Goshawk or Helen Macdonald’s H is for Hawk. The next time any reader catches a glimpse of a hawk soaring over a field or highway, they’ll think of this little book and feel an extra shiver of wonder.\n\nPositive Open Letters Review The very premise of Ukrainian writer Markiyan Kamysh’s book [is] stark-staring remarkable ... Stalking the Atomic City,...details in catchy and often evocative language Kamysh’s many clandestine visits to the Exclusion Zone ... He manages to find comrades in this daftest of all adventures, and amidst the rivers of cheap alcohol, the parade of filthy sleeping bags, and the absolutely endless amount of smoking...there are surprisingly frequent moments of happy memories ... There’s a forensic reading that makes all this look like exactly the necrotic grandstanding it certainly was. Bookstores are full of titles extolling the virtues of camping out in the wild, and that makes such titles toxic for a certain rabid strand of anomie-drenched social media orphans, hence the evident need in Stalking the Atomic City to go further, to corrupt the source, to extoll the virtues of camping … in a nuclear wasteland. And if there’s a higher, non-forensic reading, some nonsense about finding salvation even at the extremities of tragedy, here’s hoping readers don’t take it seriously enough to think about booking a trip.\n\nRave Open Letters Review ... an absolutely stunning translation ... succeeds every bit as brilliantly ... One index of skill in any work of historical fiction like this is its ability to maintain suspense despite the fact that the reader already knows how the story turns out. Any even casual history buff knows that Mussolini will be the winner of the political and ideological melee that fills these pages with guessing games; indeed, thanks to the macabre art of photography, readers creep through this book reading about a striding, striving young man while the whole time having in their mind’s eye the infamous photo of an older Mussolini’s corpse strung upside-down like a hog in an abattoir ... The dissonance is only initially jarring, after which Scurati’s skill completely subsumes it. This novel is entirely full of living and even immortal figures, fiery young men and women embracing the future and Futurism ... belongs entirely to \\'Mussolini, the herald of interventionism,\\' and readers are drawn into his passions, disappointments, and increasingly illicit aspirations. The result is magnificently, disturbingly mesmerizing. The second book in the series, M: Man of Destiny, can’t arrive in English soon enough.\n\nMixed Open Letters Review Readers looking to enjoy the fuzzy familiarity of this defrosting-enigma gambit will need to pay a predictable price for it when wading through Girl in Ice, unfortunately: they get the human popsicles, yes, but they also get prose that reads like it was defrosted from freshman writing student’s most purple cast-offs ... Readers looking to enjoy the fuzzy familiarity of this defrosting-enigma gambit will need to pay a predictable price for it when wading through Girl in Ice, unfortunately: they get the human popsicles, yes, but they also get prose that reads like it was defrosted from freshman writing student’s most purple cast-offs ... Too much of this kind of bilge will make almost any reader want to fade into the cerulean depths, but Val’s the stubborn type, particularly once she finally starts to suspect that she might have accidentally accepted an invitation to join the Red Skull and his not-at-all-psycopathic henchperson in an icebound wasteland far from reliable cell service. By the time she’s up to her shinbones in ice eels, she’ll be fighting for her life—and readers who can suppress the occasional giggle will doubtless be enjoying themselves.\n\nPan The Open Letters Review ... has a subtitle that reads A History, a Philosophy, a Warning. Which is a bit puzzling, since the book, slimmed down to well below 200 pages for its summer weight, contains neither a history of the Internet nor a philosophy of the Internet nor any kind of warning about the Internet. Unless the “warning” part refers to the book itself, since any time a professor of anything labels one of their books \\'philosophy,\\' you know you’re probably in for a transcript of largely unconnected quasi-coherent meanderings the professor has had on some subject late at night over bourbon. Such transcripts tend to feel baggy even if they’re only a few pages long; they tend to infuriate with their entitled laziness; and most of all they tend to disappoint by being rain-puddle shallow ... And most of all, there’ll be the pomposity — and it doesn’t take more than a dozen pages for Smith to indulge ... Aside from the generally repellant tweed jacket/leather elbow patch tone of such nonsense, which would be bad enough for the asking price, there’s also the sloppy, imprecise thinking and phrasing that always comes standard-issue in works pretending to philosophy. The whole ponderous pronouncement is intended to sound impressively thoughtful, but each individual component of it is fairly idiotic (call it the Jordan Peterson affect). Worse, by reducing the Internet’s role in modern society to such Deep Thought 101 binaries, Smith sets opening terms that make it virtually impossible to discuss that role in anything but Chicken Little terms. And worst of all, as noted, our author’s framing of the issue positions himself as that modern-day Savior, the Thought Leader ... But the book manages to be annoying in small ways as well as big ones, foremost being Smith’s persistent Twitterisms ... This kind of slippery posturing happens throughout the book, which ends up being a bunch of half-thoughts about a genuinely important subject. Long, long after Smith should have starting getting down the cases, he’s still nattering on.\n\nRave The Christian Science Monitor It’s hardly a picture of visionary leadership, but Frank is often commendably even-handed in that assessment ... looks with refreshing directness at both Truman’s strengths and weaknesses – readers seeking an even-handed account of the major issues in his administration need look no further than this solid volume. They just need to proceed with caution, as Frank himself admits.\n\nPositive Open Letters Review The Turning Point...is doubtless something you’ll find interesting. Keyhole histories like this, looking at one thin slice of a famous person’s life...can often combine the best elements of biography and monograph. Douglas-Fairhurst’s book certainly does that ... Douglas-Fairhurst does a very readable, very energetic job narrating all the day-by-day things going on in the great author’s life during that year—a full-length biography of Dickens by this biographer would be a thing to behold—but he scarcely even seems to remember his titular theory, much less substantiate it ... this book reminds [us]...how infinitely interesting Dickens was, how oddly elusive for such an attention-seeker, how multifaceted despite his constant bustling. The Turning Point won’t convince many readers that Charles Dickens—much less the world—was changed in 1851, but it’ll convince them of something maybe more important: that more Dickens books by Douglas-Fairhurst will always be welcome.\n\nRave Open Letters Review ... the most passionate, engaging, and unabashedly nerdy narrative of the humble index that it’s every likely to get ... Duncan’s book is brightly energetic and unfailingly interesting, from its main meat to its many eager digressions. Writers and researchers of all stripes rely on the index of every book they consult, but even they may not have known how many twists and turns the history of the index took before it reached its current form. And the index of Index, A History of the? It’s very good.\n\nPan The Open Letters Review There are two main problems with Julie Otsuka’s new book, The Swimmers: A Novel – apart from its absurd cover-blurb, that is. Colson Whitehead sighs, \\'Here comes the new Julie Otsuka novel, so we can begin to live again.\\' It’s difficult to know why mainstream publishers think this ridiculous kind of bullcrap is anything but embarrassing, but at least it’s easily ignored ... No, the first real problem is that The Swimmers: A Novel is not a novel ... The second problem is that, a few entirely unconvincing little wisps of reconciliation on the author’s part notwithstanding, there’s nothing connecting The Underground Pool with the book’s other stories ... is actually a pair of novellas lumped together under a bit of false advertising ... At every turn, they wallow in the quotidian plodding of a much-too-long New York Times Magazine profile piece ... There are some moving passages in a couple of the stories here about the undemonstrative creeping ravages of dementia, passages that will certainly resonate with readers who’ve gone through such things with a loved one. But since these passages are written in the completely flat affect of all autofiction, they’re unlikely to resonate with anybody who hasn’t gone through such things. There’s none of the reach or sweep of fiction in these pages, mainly because there’s precious little fiction in these pages ... Given revision and significantly more concentration on the author’s part, such a premise could be worked into a novel. But that’s hardly going to happen if we’ve got Colson Whitehead hyperventilating about how a lumpy, ill-sorted collection of author-jottings allows us all to live again, for Pete’s sake.\n\nPan Open Letters Review ... none of these wispy little half-gestures in the direction of some kind of plot or character form more than a small part of the lumpy, runny spilled-soup mess that is Pure Colour. The bulk of this wretched exercise in pure unstructured egotism is given over to two things - first, to cod-philosophical ponderings that are so banal and juvenile that encountering the first one on Page 2 and realizing you’ve got 200 more pages of such drivel to go might very well prompt a bout of Nietzschean existential despair ... and second, chunks of prose that reads like it was written by a grade school child who’s freshly sustained a traumatic head injury, a stop-and-stare level of appalling prose that legitimately should have embarrassed FSG to publish ... The cover of Pure Colour calls it a novel, but this isn’t true. There is no story here, no characters, no plot, no action, no dialogue, no ideological coherence, no dramatic arc or payoff, no progression, no chapters, no forethought, and no revision. Rather, this is a book-length collection COVID-19 quarantine jottings, most no longer than a paragraph, half-heartedly stitched together with threads of pure cynicism by an author and publisher who are hoping the bamboozled will ask no questions. Those bamboozled will doubtless be helped by the book-chattering class, which praises garbage like Pure Colour because the awful alternative would be the read Anthony Trollope. So, let the think-pieces begin.\n\nRave Open Letters Review ... not only dispels this second looming specter but sees it off with almost prodigal ease. Instead, Douglas Stuart’s second novel verifies the presence of a major new fictional voice in the literary chorus. This is every bit as eloquent and fiercely miserable novel as Shuggie Bain – in fact, it may be a hair stronger on both counts, since the brutality in its pages is both more believable and more savage and the thread of its hope is thinner and weaker (not hope for those birds in the dovecote, obviously – they’re as doomed as a cocky jock in a horror movie – but any adult reader will know that by Page 2) ... Once the two young men know what they feel for each other, two plots begin to unfold in the course of the book: they explore those feelings, and everybody around them attacks those feelings. The first works much better than the second, mainly when the second involves Young Mungo’s family deciding to ship him off to a murky loch with a pair of deeply suspect men. This little decampment is evocatively written but even so very nearly derails the book, since it feels both garish and manipulative ... Far more effective is the nearly-flawless way Stuart captures the almost painful yearning of young ardor. He consistently and cannily pairs it with the same incongruously lovely descriptions of the natural world that poked out everywhere in Shuggie Bain, and he returns again and again to the suggestion of charged and unpredictable electric fields ... The delicacy of such moments is standard fare for gay fiction and yet an almost unbearable counterweight to the brutality literally surrounding the boys at all times. Stuart plays on this contrast so often you’d think it would start to feel tiresome, but that never quite happens, even when some of the passages, though cleanly done, walk right up to the border of Sundance Festival sleeper hit ... as a brace of qualities in common with some medieval morality play: it’s harrowing, surprisingly elegant, and dangles redemption at arm’s reach past a screen of bigotry, cruelty, and blood. There’s doubtless a monograph to be written on how it reflects the current zeitgeist, but thankfully it’s not concerned with such things, so you won’t need to be either. But you might cry a bit.\n\nMixed Open Letters Review It’s a dutifully full-dress thing ... it assembles a varied fellowship; it brims with lore; it serves up a series of MacGuffins (including one on the very last page); it promises sequels. And it raises questions ... The point-of-view shifts are smoothly, convincingly done, and all the tricks Rollins learned from years of writing thrillers keep the plot moving briskly along even in what very much feels like a ground-clearing first volume. But that brings up the questions again, the foremost being: is this a triumphant return or a quasi-pastiche, or a bit of both? There’s certainly an uneven quality to the narrative tone, which runs from slangy thriller-speak...to almost a parody of the cod-medieval lingo that was bird-imprinted on the entire genre by JRR Tolkien ... Or could it be that none of this is really uneven at all? Could the contrast of dialogue styles be an intentional gambit to shake up the conventions so honored by Terry Brooks and company? Could all those familiar archetypes be clubbed together here in order to produce a comfortingly welcoming atmosphere for genre junkies, just like all the exotic locations and central-casting jet-set scientists in those airport thrillers? Could the book’s fairly flat narrative arc be designed to hook readers for an assembly-line of future volumes? Mayhap, dear reader. Mayhap.\n\nMixed Open Letters Review That action is fairly engaging; Waking Romeo is very page-turning YA fiction, even though it shares with most YA what appears to be a requisite for the whole genre, namely large chunks of ghastly prose ... Waking Romeo can’t quite overcome its many flaws; apart from a few quirks of vocabulary and shoehorned diversity, all its characters are essentially the same, the small amount of actual action is vaguely described, the worldbuilding is nonexistent (you have to work extra hard to avoid logic flaws in a time travel story, and Barker doesn’t work at all), the villains are completely unconvincing, and the emotional connections between characters feel entirely stage-directed. There’s undeniable narrative energy here, but you can get that and much more in Shakespeare’s play, if you’re getting all technical.\n\nPositive Open Letters Review ... a combination of Scott Smith’s The Ruins and Little Shop of Horrors, and readers who are already familiar with the signature brand of highbrow creepiness Percy showed in Red Moon and The Wilding will have a juicy anticipation of what’s coming ... This is hardly a boring book, even though its author virtually never denies himself wonky digressions ... The Unfamiliar Garden carries the freight of its nerdy passions very lightly, and always in the service of some genuinely touching human drama.\n\nRave Open Letters Review Inevitably in books like this, the narrative shoals for long, wonderful stretches on personal stories. Ottoman history provides no shortage of larger-than-life homicidal maniacs whose stories make for very colorful reading ... The prominence of all these personalities, so busy bustling about killing their fathers, their uncles, their younger brothers, and all their young brothers’ male children, represents a canny narrative choice; it keeps Baer’s book running along in an entirely enjoyable reading experience and gives readers a series of faces to put on all the social and economic eras that unfurl in the course of the story.\n\nRave Open Letters Review Huge, sumptuous ... In addition to being brilliant, Highsmith could also be rough, and she got rougher as she got older ... What’s produced here instead is something utterly beguiling, a double-track confession of Augstinian proportions. Highsmith kept both a conventional diary and also a series of notebooks that acted more like a jagged, introspective commonplace book ... The contrast is cumulatively dizzying, building the point where the readers feels like a dumbfounded witness to a heated, life-long dialogue between Highsmith’s id and her ego ... The interplay, combined with informative, tastefully minimal footnotes throughout, create a better, wiser, less forgiving, and entirely more involving life of Patricia Highsmith than any formal biography that’s ever been written or ever likely to be written.\n\nRave Open Letters Review ... although his narrative of Crane’s short and incredibly eventful life is very lively, far more lively than any previous life of this author, the book’s consistently strongest element is the one Auster himself has already touted: one writer dramatically encountering another writer at work on the page ... no matter what you might think of Auster’s own fiction, his reactions to Crane’s writings are invigoratingly thoughtful, the kind of genuine appraisals that will prompt even long-seasoned Crane aficionados to return to his work ... electrically honest stuff is the real heart of Burning Boy, the thing that makes it a curiously indispensable Stephen Crane biography, passionately different from anything else that’s appeared about this writer.\n\nPositive Open Letters Review Dimsdale is a brilliantly concise and insightful guide...and this book is as energetic and enjoyable as his previous one. But since every single 21st century individual, reading the above paragraph, is thinking of one example and one example only, Dark Persuasion feels like one unbearably protracted prequel to the main event. Readers wait nearly 300 pages for the shoe to drop. The baleful red eye on the book’s US dust jacket is looking in one direction, at one person - and that person doesn’t even merit an inclusion in the book’s index ... Of course the single greatest, most widespread, and most damaging example of brainwashing in the 21st century is the hold disgraced, twice-impeached one-term US President Donald Trump has over his 150 million American followers ... Aside from a few desultory and parting references to Trump, his book never examines the single greatest example of his subject in modern times—an example that was already old and well-established while he was writing his book ... Doubtless Dark Persuasion was intended as a historical overview of the development of brainwashing. It achieves that goal wonderfully. Nevertheless, many readers will finish it saying \\'But what about …?\\'\n\nRave Open Letters Review Wassef has dozens of sharp anecdotes about that reading public’s learning curve ... a heartfelt, biting, and often quite funny story of some of the best and worst that humanity has to offer. It’s the autobiography of a quiet, bookish revolution - one that’s ongoing.\n\nPan Open Letters Review Le Carré was never satisfied with the book because it was never good enough ... a couple of half-hearted plot-threads ... It’s heartbreaking to think of the various wispy, vampy character sketches in the pages of this book, only fleshed out by Le Carré at the peak of his late-style perception. And it doesn’t feel at all right to finish a Le Carré novel with a feeling of heartbreak. Silverview is more of an Irish wake than it is a novel. The truly faithful will put in an appearance, say a quiet word to the widow...and then go off to remember happier times. If John Le Carré had intended you to read this book, he’d have written it.\n\nPositive The Christian Science Monitor ... strong and optimistic claims about the value of rationality at a moment in history that seems to have turned its back on logic and rationality. And in these pages he makes perfectly clear that he’s not dealing in empty rhetoric ... If Pinker’s Rationality has one weakness, it’s the book’s readiness to dismiss the obvious force-multiplier behind the enormous rise in irrationality: social media ... so elegantly written and so generously packed with data and references ... Rationality will improve your own critical thinking—pass it on.\n\nPositive Open Letters Review \\\"Obvious short stories like Meghan Daum’s \\'Matricide\\' or Charles D’Ambrosio’s \\'Loitering\\' are included here one what can be assumed to be a lark, for instance. Ander Monson’s incoherent \\'Failure: A Meditation\\' is here, as is Floyd Skloot’s \\'Gray Area: Thinking with a Damaged Brain,\\' which is moving in inverse proportion to the likelihood that it could have been written by somebody who’d actually experienced any of the maladies it describes. \\'Dear Friend, From My Life I Write To You in Your Life,\\' in which Yiyun Li assembles 24 random anecdotes, is likewise here for no apparent reason. But...such inclusions total only a small fraction of the Table of Contents here, which is otherwise every bit as strong as those in all other Lopate’s anthologies, with superb pieces ... True, there’s typically self-impressed gibberish from David Shields...but there’s also Darryl Pinckney’s terrific \\'Busted in New York,\\' Samantha Irby’s \\'The Terror of Love,\\' and Lynn Freed’s raucous \\'Doing No Harm\\' ... in the presence of such well-chosen abundance...allowances are easy. \\\n\nRave Open Letters Review In fifteen cheerful, fast-paced, funny chapters, Roach looks at deaths, home invasions, traffic violations like jaywalking, and massive amounts of food theft committed by the various usual suspects: bears, raccoons, mice, deer, elephants, even cougars, and many kinds of birds ... Roach is above all an entertaining writer, so when she touches on such deeper issues, she touches on them lightly ... Fuzz doesn’t pretend to have definitive answers to such questions; this is far more a snapshot of the current situation than a roadmap to future solutions, if such future solutions are even possible. Two things are certain: Roach’s vast audience of fervent fans won’t be disappointed by this latest book.\n\nPan Open Letters Review The novel follows these plot lines in much the same way as one boils noodles: semi-attentively, disinterestedly, and with a limp, flavorless result. The narrative gimmick on which Rooney hangs much of the book is as poorly-conceived as it is poorly-executed: for much of its length, this is an epistolary novel. Alice and Eileen send each other completely unbelievable emails, emails of enormous length and complexity, emails, in other words, that know they’re in a novel ... Roony\\'s...conspicuously talentless ... repulsively self-pitying: Alice the millionaire-phenom author feels victimized ... If we extrapolate anything of the author into the character, it at least adds a seasoning of bathos to this soup of boredom. But the boredom still wins out. The plot in Beautiful World, Where Are You is not sloppy and meandering as some kind of meta-commentary on the shapelessness of modern twenty-something existence—it’s sloppy and meandering because Sally Rooney is incapable of writing anything more coherent.\n\nRave Open Letters Review She’s every bit as ready to write about the healing, uniting power of reading, but her pages aren’t populated with wistful vicars and earnest librarians with tiny apartments crammed with books ... For so short a book, this is a surprisingly sweeping look at books and reading, but it’s a very different one from the norm ... White is emphasizing that reading’s core is molten. It’s an odd thing, for a book about the joys of reading to be such a fierce thing. On almost every page, usually through the method of her thrilling interpretations of dozens of literary works, White explores what she calls \\'the paradox at the heart of reading,\\' which she characterizes in oddly anthemic terms ... both cautionary and uplifting ... a call to arms issued to people who thought all was quiet on the reading front.\n\nRave Open Letters Review Zenith has delved more deeply...than any previous scholar, and he\\'s also investigated Pessoa\\'s life and times so exhaustively (his fine-print chapter notes run for dozens of pages and include some of the most fascinating details in the entire book; one hopes for a biographer\\'s memoir at some point, although sheer exhaustion would be totally understandable in this case) that it\\'s difficult to imagine a more comprehensive life of Pessoa in any language ... What really makes Pessoa: A Biography stand out is how infinitely, companionably readable it is in all its great length.\n\nRave Open Letters Review ... presents endless opportunities for an enterprising writer, and Baldwin has written the best book on the subject since City of Quartz. He helicopters his broader narrative down at carefully-chosen points in the city’s history ... This kind of kaleidoscopic approach is a risk, since it forfeits most narrative cohesion in its quest for momentum, but Baldwin makes it pay off ... It certainly conveys the persistent strangeness of the place, and this is hugely helped by Baldwin’s uncanny ability to get the best quotes out of the endless people he interviews over endless drinks in endless tacky bars. He’s amassed so many of these choice quotes that he can deploy them as punch lines ... If you’re not already under the odd spell that LA so often casts on even people who’ve never visited it, you’ll feel the light brushing of that spell while reading these pages; if you find the whole idea of Los Angeles vaguely, indefinably revolting, Baldwin’s anecdotes will make you seethe delectably with vicarious disapproval; and if you are indeed already bewitched by LA, you now have a new piece of required reading.\n\nRave The Christian Science Monitor ... an enormous amount of research and a refreshing lack of partisanship ... Bird admits at the outset of his fluidly engaging book that Carter was and remains an enigma ... Bird dramatizes the challenges faced by the Carter administration by bringing to life the people involved. The book has vibrant personality portraits of everybody from New York State politician Midge Costanza, the first woman ever named a presidential assistant, all the way to Zbigniew Brzezinski, Carter’s prickly and imperious national security adviser ... This Jimmy Carter is not a saint—but he does come across as a fundamentally decent man who was stubbornly unwilling to surrender his decency, even in the face of challenges more severe than most presidents face ... The United States may never see another presidency like Jimmy Carter’s, and as time goes on his administration increasingly looks like an outlier, the very term Kai Bird uses for its chief. Readers could find no better place to learn about that anomaly than this book.\n\nPan Open Letters Review Bonvicini spends just enough pages taking the reader...inside the opulent yet fearful world of kidnapping fears, armed guards on the way to and from school, and, as one character puts it, bombs going off like in wartime. Then she cuts the action and shifts the scene; much like the book’s two lovers, readers are never quite allowed to get completely comfortable in any era of the story before being whisked away to some new time ... It’s an alluring template, hampered only slightly here by the fact that both Olivia and especially Valerio oscillate between being simpletons and being nonentities. All the narrative’s older characters, particularly Morganti grandmother Manon, are so consistently more interesting than the two stars that some readers may find themselves grumbling ... Neither author nor translator seems like a convincing culprit, but somebody’s guilty of the many, many crimes against style, imagery, and even diction that fill almost every page of this book ... Either Bonvicini’s original prose is every bit as choked with the Italian originals of all these cliches and lazy idioms, or else Shugaar decided to leaven out a lifetime of excellent translations by tossing up a lousy one. Regardless of who committed the crime, the victim is obvious: if the reader can master the mental gymnastics of enjoying a story while overlooking practically everything about how that story is executed, then The Year of Our Love (in this very prettily designed edition from Other Press) will certainly exert real charm.\n\nPositive The Christian Science Monitor ... subtle and extraordinary ... a combination of historical insight and personal discovery perhaps best described by a word from his own title: \\'reckoning\\' ... The problem with How the Word Is Passed—and it’s certainly a negotiable problem in light of the book’s generous array of strengths—is that Smith’s rhetoric sometimes moves from passionate to overblown. It’s a move that may cost him readers who would otherwise agree with him ... Despite such occasional overreaches, How the Word Is Passed is a harrowing journey through historical landmarks ... It’s a challenging text, but ultimately, perhaps, a hopeful one.\n\nPositive Open Letters Review O’Donnell’s account of Revolution-era Marblehead—its prosperous merchant families, its touchy relations with ‘the mainland’ of Massachusetts, etc.—is textured and oddly modular in its feeling, like it could be easily dislodged from the rest of the book, which broadens the story to include the familiar itinerary of George Washington’s early successes and failures. O’Donnell’s prose line almost always registers somewhere between \\'vivid\\' and \\'purple,\\' which, providentially, is also pretty much where most of the prose of the time period also fell. This makes for gripping reading even when the subject matter has been written up countless times by countless historians, as in Washington’s thrill-packed surprise attack on the Hessian encampment at Trenton ... The attempt to give The Indispensables a Marblehead focus often gives the book the awkward feeling of a monograph trapped inside a melodrama, but even so: for sheer energy, this is the season’s stand-out Revolutionary Era title.\n\nRave Open Letters Review ... Cynthia Saltzman has mined a comparatively minor bit of cultural vandalism and produced an absolute gem ... at every moment Saltzman maintains a smooth, easy control over all of it. Plunder is captivating reading, a chronicle full of outsized personalities.\n\nRave The Christian Science Monitor In order to flesh out his case, Rothman makes the masterful dramatic stroke of putting three prosperous slave traders front and center: Isaac Franklin, John Armfield, and Rice Ballard. The Ledger and the Chain is in large part a biographical study of these men, both as individuals and as symbols of Rothman’s larger argument. Readers watch them preen and hustle and manage their finances, and although Rothman regularly reminds us that these men were very comfortable with \\'the intimate daily savageries of the slave trade,\\' he does an eye-opening job of making these three vile men three-dimensionally human ... The thoroughness of Rothman’s research occasionally seems to work against him ... a stunning, unsettling account of a guilt shared more widely and more enthusiastically than many Americans like to think. Everyone knew what men like Franklin, Armfield, and Ballard did for a living, but their money spoke louder than their sin.\n\nRave The Christian Science Monitor ... [an] indispensable new book ... There are new books every year that promise \\'a new history\\' of such a well-studied subject as World War II, but McMeekin actually delivers on that promise ... The author’s extensive use of Soviet archives (the book has 100 pages of often wonderfully discursive endnotes) informs a darkly fascinating look at Stalin’s dealings with Chiang Kai-shek’s government in China ... The anger animating Stalin’s War is about Western complicity: Once the Soviet Union seemed to join the Allied cause, there was scarcely anything Stalin could ask of those allies that would be denied him ... Stalin was allowed almost total victory in a war he had largely engineered for his own benefit. Sean McMeekin has done a fantastic job telling that war’s story.\n\nMixed Open Letters Review Tonelli’s descriptions of what amounts to his workplace are disappointingly fleeting in these pages; even the lay reader will be able to glean that the discovery of the Higgs boson is a major scientific event worthy of a long, detailed chronicle of its own. This isn’t that book. Instead, Tonelli maps those picoseconds of the universe’s birth onto, as the title suggests, the creation account in the Book of Genesis. The rationale behind this is impenetrable and maddening; there is no connection whatsoever between the three-thousand-year-old mythology of primitive tribesmen and the science of cosmology and particle physics, and any attempt to invoke one—especially by a scientist, for the love of Mike—is only counterproductively encouraging to the science-denying religious fundamentalists who already have way, way too much encouragement in the 21st century. The organizing conceit aside, however, Tonelli’s book is such a lively introduction to the current theorizing about the first 10-to-the-negative-30th seconds goings-on in the universe that you might actually find yourself understanding some of it. Talk about something out of nothing.\n\nRave The Christian Science Monitor Tumulty seems aware of the uphill battle involved in writing a thoroughly researched and historically responsible biographical reassessment of a controversial figure like the first lady ... She’s written a masterpiece. Tumulty is well aware of her subject’s shortcomings ... Tumulty, who interviewed a legion of sources, presents a picture of the first lady as surprisingly earthy, an avid listener, and consistently, stealthily, kind ... All future biographies of her will have to start with this one[.]\n\nMixed The Open Letters Review ... very entertaining, very frustrating ... very much a response-volume to the Trump presidency as much as it’s anything else ... [Boehner] is referring to the rabid, scorched-earth tenor of modern American politics, of course, and although he seems unwilling to ascribe the beginning of that tenor to his grandstanding old colleague Newt Gingrich, he’s perfectly willing to blame lots of other people ... Earthy, explicit language runs throughout the book. It reflects the way Boehner sounds in everyday conversation, and it’s clearly intended to convey sincerity. And it does, all too well. The cumulative impression is far from a compliment to its author. He comes across as a shallow, foul-mouthed, opportunistic dimwit who’s the hero of his own story only because he’s not one of the crazies. He implicitly characterizes himself as a rumpled but fundamentally honest avatar of the old, effective, non-crazy Washington of decades past, but it’s not tough to look good when you’re comparing yourself to outright traitors like Ted Cruz or Josh Hawley ... Any reading of Boehner’s book makes unavoidable the conclusion that although he’s not a bad American, he was still a pretty bad politician.\n\nPositive Open Letters Review [a] breezy, chatty overview of what the Bible is, what it isn’t, where it comes from, and, most importantly, what it really does and doesn’t say ... all of the points Swenson makes will strike even entry-level secular participants in Bible study as obvious, pedestrian stuff ... And Swenson’s sometimes lumbering obliviousness doesn’t help matters any ... Nevertheless, A Most Peculiar Book has a very specific patch of ground to cover, and it covers that patch well. This is a talky, hey-did-you-know look at the oddities of the most famous book in the world, and although Kristin Swenson’s fellow students of religion might consider it familiar to the point of redundant, most readers will be surprised and amused on virtually every page.\n\nPositive The Boston Globe ... gripping ... populated with a large cast of well-drawn characters — including some, like JFK’s vice president, Lyndon B. Johnson, who haven’t featured this prominently in most earlier versions ... If rock layer isn’t to be buried by a much thicker one signaling the moment when the human race killed itself, Nuclear Folly reminds us that the time for study — and for action — is now.\n\nMixed Open Letters Review It’s a fundamentally surprising kind of volume, something that already feels like an anachronism encountered in some museum’s dusty basement ... Merrill was a master of that antiquated kind of correspondence ... These letters could often strive for the feeling of being dashed off, but Merrill cared about them quite a bit ... Hammer and Yenser are as conscientious as you could reasonably hope. They carefully footnote every letter, identifying all the names of people, places, and books that fill Merrill’s chatter, and they include a glossary of important recurring names. But that only goes so far. The problem—and, far from being a problem, it was a glorious gift to the recipients of these letters—is that although Merrill was a literary perfectionist of the first water, he never insulted his correspondents by turning his letters into set pieces. Each letter in this volume is written to somebody, about things, with no attempt made at contextualizing. The prompting letters are not included, and neither are the responses, and no amount of either would be sufficient in any case. The result makes for fragmentary reading at best ... The result is a persistent feeling of listening through a keyhole to one half of the middle of a conversation. There are wonderful moments, everywhere ... But such moments are confirmations rather than discoveries—they’ll always tend to reward the faithful while confounding newcomers.\n\nPositive Open Letters Review ... boisterously satisfying ... Here are Heffer’s weaknesses, including a notable tendency to chase hares into the weeds (it requires a certain kind of wayward courage for a writer to hit his readers with five solid pages about Edwardian municipal architecture before they’ve even got their hats off). And here also are his strengths: encyclopedic knowledge, a deft ear for the right quotations, and a flair for dramatic character-portraits ... The Age of Decadence has great swaths of fascinating stuff on, as mentioned, architecture, and also art, music, apparel, as well as social upheavals, financial upheavals, political upheavals, and of course the increasingly audible murmur of war. And through it all, his focal points are people rather than trends ... Heffer is enthusiastically conscientious about making sure that upper-class swagger doesn’t dominate the book, even though most of the events in these pages are owned and moved around by Ribblesdale & Co. ... The Age of Decadence does an indomitable job of warning against the illusion—most of the signs of upheaval had been sporadically visible long before the Somme—and manages to be captivating reading in the process.\n\nRave The Christian Science Monitor The pages of The Last Queen sketch out [Queen Elizabeth II\\'s] biography as a series of embarrassments and tragedies. In each pugnacious and incredibly readable chapter, Irving reexamines all the famous crises of Elizabeth’s reign ...\n\nPan Open Letters Review The author might disclaim any idea that Hello, Habits is meant to instruct or guide readers, but there’s scarcely any other conceivable reason for the book to exist, and my, my is it an unsettling prospect to get life-advice from somebody who, translator Eriko Sugita’s efforts notwithstanding, comes across as more than a little dim ... The book is [...] full of little tossed-off asides from which readers are encouraged to draw deeper life lessons, and virtually every single one of those tossed-off asides should instead be tossed out - as blockheaded, off-point, factually wrong, or all three.\n\nRave The Christian Science Monitor ...captivating ... Years ago, McCarthy impulsively self-published a book outlining some of his earliest thoughts on the subject. He called it North by Shakespeare, and in a neat gesture of writerly magnanimity, Blanding adopts that title in order to tell the story of McCarthy’s journey, North’s adventures, and, ultimately, the whole Shakespeare authorship question ... Blanding dramatizes very effectively the thrill of this literary investigation, giving readers a revelation-by-revelation account of the developments in McCarthy’s thinking without ever drowning them in trivia. The book likewise does a virtuoso job of evoking both the realities of Shakespeare’s world and the twists and turns of the whole Shakespeare question ... a curiously invigorating glimpse of that jobbing, hustling Shakespeare ... this isn’t some silly conspiracy theory. Orthodox scholars who simply ignore it do so at the peril of their reputations.\n\nRave Open Letters Review Readers who ignore Brennan’s peripheral personal comments will nevertheless get the gist of them before they’ve gone 30 pages into this book: Brennan was Said’s friend and former student. This is not a bar to the writing of a biography, of course, but it can present an obstacle to writing an unbiased one. But it’s only an obstacle if you’re trying to overcome it ... Brennan is uniformly excellent in presenting the phenomenon of Edward Said, and in many senses that’s a more fundamental approach than presenting the man. The man, after all, made a nearly life-long career out of being a phenomenon, and a book that didn’t take that square on would be almost as unsatisfying as one that did. Brennan is powerfully eloquent on this fundamental Said paradox ... The brilliance of Brennan’s book is the way it so consistently turns the glare of the spotlight into flattering mood lighting. This is, of course, also its besetting flaw. His Said is the beleaguered humanist in every room of low-browed ideologues and closet (or cloak room) Zionists. When he’s misunderstood, he’s slandered; when he’s thwarted, he’s wronged. In his account, Said is a Caesar (when comes such another?) and it’s always the Ides of March.\n\nPositive Open Letters Review ... heartfelt ... It’s unlikely that Fulfillment will change behaviors. This must be squarely faced. Most people, presented with the option of shopping for literally anything in the world from the comfort of their living room couch and having it seamlessly delivered to their doorstep the next day, will not forsake that mind-boggling convenience for any reason ... But if Fulfillment makes even a few thousand of those consumers more mindful, if it prompts even a few thousand of them to remember that they have shops over on their Main Street that badly need their support and will greet them with smiles rather than an Amazon van dashing away in the dead of night, well, that will be a kind of victory.\n\nPositive Open Letters Vronsky has a great deal of experience researching these stories and then rendering them in vividly readable prose. He adopts a narrative tone throughout that\\'s harsh but fascinated toward the monsters he\\'s chronicling ... Vronsky\\'s \\'epidemic\\' years have an end-point; he notes that the numbers are falling – a hopeful development, although not quite knowing its causes is naturally worrying. If a new epidemic is currently incubating, we can at least hope Vronksy is on the case to analyze it.\n\nRave Open Letters The Volga is enormous, one of the longest rivers in the world, and covers so many different kinds of territory that it might well be said to thread different worlds together on its temperamental path to the Caspian Sea. In telling the story of those worlds, Harley is faced with an impossible narrative; any riparian history can only ever be a judicious culling from an infinite trove of stories ... The Volga tells many of the most dramatic of those stories - tales of war and disaster, famine and long marches played out against some of the most stunning landscapes anywhere on Earth ... Hartley smartly narrates peace and war, exploration and exploitation. The tale necessarily ends on notes of ecological caution; like all other natural features on the planet, the Volga has been greatly despoiled by the humans it’s helped over the centuries ... Janet Hartley has done a superb job writing the biography of a river that, despoiled or not, will be flowing long after its plaguing humans are gone.\n\nRave The Christian Science Monitor ... deeply impressive ... The whole spectrum of [...] passions is marvelously represented in these pages (which, charmingly, are illustrated throughout with the frontispieces of seminal Enlightenment works, rather than tired stereotypical paintings of Catherine the Great’s drawing room and such). Robertson has written a big, enthusiastic book about other books ... Diderot and his fellow valiant thinkers might not have liked the idea that reason, sympathy, and equality are so constantly vulnerable – but they’d have applauded such a big and optimistic book as this.\n\nMixed The Open Letters Review ... gives the very palpable but muffled sense that the author isn’t quite saying what he means ... [Elder] is extremely versed in the period and its huge personalities, and throughout the book he uses a vividly readable prose style. His narration of Calhoun’s political life makes for unfailingly gripping reading ... A smart, bristling new life of Calhoun is no bad or redundant thing, and Elder’s book is a very worthy modern companion to Bartlett’s from 70 years ago...The only problem is the author’s murky justification for presenting the book in the first place, which is an admittedly trivial problem ... The world-wide Black Lives Matter protests of the summer of 2020 - the inescapable candidate for what’s on Elder’s mind here - do not demonstrate in some contorted way that the ghost of John C. Calhoun still somehow dominates the country; the protests demonstrate just the opposite. Calhoun was indeed a dark foil of American progress and freedom, an extreme racist lunatic in his own day, and an extreme racist lunatic today. Good as Elder’s biography is, let’s hope it’s Calhoun’s last.\n\nMixed Open Letters Review Peter Mendelsund’s new novel, The Delivery, is for most of its length a lean, sweaty, hungry thing ... Mendelsund adopts a telegraphic style, with page after page filled with one-sentence paragraphs separated by dashes. At roughly the book’s half-way mark, actual prose starts to infiltrate the narrative and slow it down, but before that it races breathlessly along with the delivery boy on his rounds. ... When the delivery boy finally, inevitably opens his mysterious payload, readers come almost literally to the novel’s last five pages ... It’s possible that Mendelsund saw the revelations of those five pages as some kind of neato-keeno clever twist, perhaps some meta-smart reflection on The Refugee Experience. But they are in fact a total betrayal of all the attention the reader has paid out in order to reach them. Those final five pages profane the spare eloquence of the book’s first half, completely explode any sympathy engendered by the book’s second half, and gut the whole point of telling this story in the first place. That’s no mean feat for only a handful of pages, and it turns any verdict on the book into some kind of mulish enigma. What’s a reviewer to say? The Delivery is an almost addictively engaging book, and that’s why you shouldn’t read it?\n\nRave Open Letters Review Park’s professional credentials are obvious and extensive, but it’s her easy, cheery writing style that carries the book. She makes the smart decision to ground virtually all of the enormous amount of information she wants to convey in the form of individual people - friends, patients, family members; this book is every bit as informative as a diagnostic overview would be, but it couldn’t be more different as a reading experience ... the book probes into every cranny of its many subjects, and Park writes about all of it with a commonizing touch that’s wonderfully inviting, even in the frequent instances where her mom-humor verges on the wince-worthy.\n\nPositive The Christian Science Monitor Tom Stoppard: A Life, has finally appeared. The book dresses out at almost 900 pages. This will be a cause for celebration among the many fans Lee has garnered with her other biographies ... This is about as authorized as an authorized biography can be ... Throughout the book, Lee perceptively discusses Stoppard’s work ... As so often happens in authorized biographies, readers are regularly subjected to appointment calendars in place of historical narrative ... There’s virtually nothing in Tom Stoppard: A Life that reflects even poorly, let alone damningly, on its subject. Is that because Stoppard has no flaws? Or is it because Lee would rather not speak ill of her friends, several of whom she thanks in the book’s acknowledgements, including Stoppard’s third wife and his lawyer? Time will certainly tell.\n\nMixed The Christian Science Monitor Larman takes readers through the byzantine maneuverings behind the scenes .. It’s clear that Larman has much sympathy for Simpson ... Edward, on the other hand, is described as a \\'wretched, quixotic ruler, an obsessed and demanding lover and, bar the odd instance of compassion and decency, a selfish and thoughtless man.\\' Their shared Nazi sympathies, meanwhile, are mentioned mainly as political predicaments and not moral failings ... make[s] the end of the Windsor monarchy seem not only inevitable but imminent.\n\nPan Open Letters Review [Bradford] consults her extensive notebooks and jottings in order to construct and flesh out a timeline of her lovers, and, oddly, the tone of that endeavor throughout is vaguely aggrieved, as though there’s some long-standing historical imbalance to redress...Giving them such prominence smacks of giving the biography a topical angle, always a doomed approach to life-writing ... Equally dicey, when chronicling a novelist’s life, to view everything as notebook jottings. Bradford is all over the terrain on the point ... One thing is clear: if you’re going to claim in your autobiography of an author that the author’s novels are all exercises in autobiography, your readings of that author’s novels should be superbly penetrating...Bradford’s readings of Highsmith often verge on the banal, although they can sometimes raise interesting points ... at least one goal here is to write a ‘gay life’ of this famously bristly and repellant author. This is a necessarily reductive aim, not least because it works at cross purposes to all other aims. The Patricia Highsmith presented to readers in these pages is indeed a creature of lust and lies - but too often merely so, reduced to squalid trysts and corrosive dependencies. Her strange desires never entirely defined her, but they define this book.\n\nPositive The Daily Star ... a lively curiosity and a lively prose style ... This hopscotching approach has its weaknesses, of course: it tends to produce books that can feel scattershot, more conversational than scholarly (and that can lead to occasional slips, as when he asserts that the borders of the United States have \\'little or nothing to do with any physical need for separation,\\' when in fact most US state borders are drawn along rivers or other physically separating features). But the strengths of the approach are equally obvious: it\\'s no small thing to sit down for a long conversation with a thinker and storyteller like Winchester, to find out what\\'s on his mind this time, and which stories about his new subject have captured his imagination ... [a] charming and challenging book [.]\n\nPositive The Open Letters Review In charting Lincoln’s struggle with that conflict - as much an inner, personal quest as a matter of canny workaday politics - Oakes packs an absolutely enormous amount of research and contemplation into barely 200 pages. He’s never willing to exonerate Lincoln, and that makes The Crooked Path to Abolition unfailingly challenging reading. Much longer books have been written about the broiling constitutional issues on everybody’s lips in the 1850s, but as Oakes notes, comparatively little popular history work has been done on antislavery constitutionalism (he cites a 1977 study by William Wiecek as a groundbreaking work on the subject). This brief book works as a powerful corrective to that neglect; it’s a fascinating way to look at Lincoln the thinker.\n\nRave Open Letters Review Readers of Craig Fehrman’s slam-bang fantastic book Author in Chief have been expecting a volume like this follow-up, The Best Presidential Writing. That earlier volume was a rousing, fascinating tour of all the different kinds of writing US Presidents have produced over the country’s two centuries, telling the stories of the stories, the biographies of these works, both the well-known ones and the obscure ones. This follow-up gives readers the writings themselves ... though the book thus ends on a flat, tinny note, it’s still a veritable symphony of presidential faux-profundity, the perfect pairing with Author in Chief and a must-read for the autumn book season.\n\nRave Open Letters Review ... there’s never been a better time for a book like IRL. It’s a book that deals with elemental urges in plain, direct language ... There are dozens of vivid metaphors in the course of this book ... At heart, IRL is a call to break this cycle through what may seem the oddest means imaginable: genuineness. \\'It starts with letting ourselves be vulnerable and attached to the world around us instead of treating our digital lives as spaces where we can optimize and design ourselves out of discomfort.\\' Odds are we’re all going to be living online for the foreseeable future. Stedman’s hard-won wisdom on the subject is well worth heeding.\n\nPositive Open Letters Review [Nichter] is careful to ballast his book with colorful anecdotes; The Last Brahmin is unexpectedly entertaining reading throughout ... Fortunately, the bulk of The Last Brahmin displays a reassuring willingness to examine the multiplicity that was always part of Lodge’s public character, and the portraits of all the other major players - particularly Nixon - ring true.\n\nPositive The Boston Globe ... in part a very erudite detective story in which the author uses the tools of archeology and philology to shed light on a \\'remarkable doctor and thinker\\' ... these textual investigations are likely of more interest to Lane Fox’s fellow classicists than they are to the general reader, who’ll tend to be far more absorbed in the other major narrative strand that runs through the book: the excavation of the early, groping history of medicine as a craft ... thanks to Lane Fox’s patient scholarship, we feel like we’re visiting dozens of sickbeds and holding the hands of dozens of frightened people ... in addition to its more abstruse arguments, it brings the human dimensions of that world alive. You’ll finish it with the strong urge to send your doctor a bottle of wine and a note of heartfelt thanks.\n\nPositive The Christian Science Monitor Stothard makes a seemingly odd but ultimately wise organizational choice: He centers the bulk of his book on an assassin whose name will be unfamiliar to pretty much everybody except his fellow historians: Cassius Parmensis, an amateur philosopher and poet ... Centering so much of the story on Parmensis allows Stothard to craft a more miniature drama that’s at times intensely emotional—almost novelistic. He’s helped considerably in this by the fact that his primary source is Velleius Paterculus, a flamboyant historian not above telling tall tales if they made good reading ... The Last Assassin brings to vivid life the whole extended drama of the death of Julius Caesar and the rise of the young man who would become Augustus Caesar. It’s a remarkable reframing of that familiar old story.\n\nMixed Open Letters Review \\\"This contention, which undergirds most of his book, is entirely true: any strand of behavior that’s lasted throughout the whole length of human history is eminently worth serious study. And for the bulk of Magic, a History, that’s just what Gosden does. His inquiry looks back to prehistoric times and ranges across the whole breadth of the world, from ancient China to the Eurasian steppes to the long Middle Ages in Europe. His endeavor is to understand the role of magic in human societies over the sprawl of 40,000 years, and although that’s a mind-bogglingly enormous goal, the book pulls in a fascinating array of cultures and aspects of magic rites and rituals. The book’s central weakness is, unfortunately, its central tenet: \\'Magical fictions are underpinned by magical fact.\\' There is no such thing as \\'magical fact\\' ... Magic, a History is never less than fascinating, but readers should have their eye of newt handy for some of its more outlandish credulity. \\\n\nPositive Open Letters Review ... even the most intrepid among [readers] may balk at the prospect of spending yet another 800 pages with the same sloe-eyed psychopath who’s already occupied an army of biographers over the course of millions of pages ... Suny’s account of those early years is tremendously heartfelt and psychologically knowing ... throughout the book, Suny regularly reverts to the bigger canvas of ideas and movements, always in evocatively straightforward prose.\n\nRave Open Letters Review ... brilliant ... [other artistic] giants dominate the book, very often stealing the limelight from the deep intellect, mordant wit, and tortured psyche of Jacob himself ... His life is an extremely well-documented mystery, and Warren’s narrative everywhere glows with the ease and compassion of having lived with her research for many, many years. Jacob will never be as well-known to French or English-language readers as all of his friends were, but Warren’s account does more than any previous life in English to convey why so many people were his friends in the first place. She has sifted through that enormous trove of letters, and she’s extensively consulted the best French books on the subject...and the result is a hefty biography that shimmers with the sharpest chatter from the Lapin Agile ... Max Jacob: A Life in Art and Letters will likely stand as the definitive English-language life of this perennially enigmatic figure.\n\nRave Open Letters Review The King of the World [...] tends to take place on a far wider international scale than any previous English-language biography of Louis XIV. The King’s colorful and convoluted Court life usually tends to preoccupy his biographers, and Mansel seeks to counterbalance that with more detailed accounts of French colonial exploits far from Versailles. Mansel has mastered a bewildering array of primary and secondary sources dealing with his man and his time period, and he’s invested his entire narrative with a kind of tightly compressed narrative energy that has the most unlikely effect imaginable: it turns a 600-page biography of King Louis XIV into a genuine page-turner of a reading experience ... King of the World is a fine combination of intriguing and paradigm-shifting, one of the year’s grandest biographies ... there’s something oddly fitting about a Louis XIV biography being such an ostentatiously ornate thing; it’s a perfect finishing stroke for a genuinely impressive work.\n\nRave Open Letters Review Heart Full of Rhythm: The Big Band Years of Louis Armstrong tells the pivotal story of Armstrong leaving the narrow loyalties of Carroll Dickerson’s Orchestra - the haphazard arrangements, the often-tenous finances, the desperate fraternal loyalty, the unmistakable on-stage magic - and stepping onto a much broader stage ... Heart Full of Rhythm is every bit as full and human as What a Wonderful World; in both cases, Riccardi, surely Armstrong’s foremost chronicler, mines the copious primary sources in order to flesh out the often turbulent details of Armstrong’s personal life ... a pricelessly detailed look at crucial periods in Armstrong’s life.\n\nRave The Christian Science Monitor ... magnificent ... If Clark’s goal in writing this big book, nearly a decade in the making, was to swap out that tired, overworked symbol for a three-dimensional human, in Red Comet she has succeeded far beyond the extent of all previous Plath biographies ... Clark is as perceptive about the work of this final year as she is about the rest of Plath’s writings ... Clark has consulted an enormous array of primary sources in order to assemble this life, ranging from unpublished letters and psychiatric records to interviews with virtually everybody who knew Plath or worked with her. The result is a clearer and more comprehensive account of Plath’s life than any that have appeared before, particularly strong in analyzing the complexities of her evolving relationship with Hughes but also wonderfully detailed in giving readers a look at the life of a working author ... although Clark sometimes succumbs to the biographer’s curse of over-documentation (we get the point long, long before every single rejection slip is accounted for), this granular picture of Plath the writer is invaluable in dispelling that image of a death-obsessed high priestess. This is a Sylvia Plath who jokes and loves and encourages and horses around. It’s an intensely human portrait.\n\nRave Open Letters Review Gretton is doing something more generous and more complex than simply chronicling the noxious anonymity of desk-killers—more generous, more complex, and therefore necessarily more daring, more open to looking either distracted or self-indulgent or both ... I You We Them carefully uses this tension between the personal and the historical in order to ratchet up the fascination along these two axes. Half the book is both an unsettling historical inquiry and, by not very subtle implication, a warning, a potential indictment of every single person who reads it and who might some day, under pressure, stamp a lethal memo that crosses their desk. And the other half of the book is the oddly engrossing personal story of the man doing the inquiring. The result is completely, confidently fascinating and naturally sets the imagination wondering about what Volume 2 will be like.\n\nPositive The Christian Science Monitor Drawing on a vast amount of primary sources (including interviews with the man himself), Schwartz carefully charts Kissinger\\'s evolution as one of the 20th century\\'s most controversial statesmen ... Schwartz always remembers to add darkly fascinating personal elements ... readers who watched that history as it was unfolding will almost certainly find Henry Kissinger and American Power disconcertingly evenhanded in assessing how Kissinger acquired the reputation upon which so much political clout rests.\n\nMixed The Open Letters Review Goldsworthy is a first-rate popular historian of the ancient world, but he’s only as good as his primary sources, and in this case that’s a significant limitation. Even in the last twenty years alone, a score of conscientious and sometimes crusading biographies of Philip have appeared, each one attempting to rescue him and his accomplishments from the glare of his son’s renown ... They’re doomed to failure, of course, because we’re dealing with stories here, and Alexander has by far the better story. Goldsworthy’s book is nearly 600 pages long, and Philip takes a knife between his ribs before page 200 ... The two narratives here - Philip’s, full of wives, concubines (of both genders), and militaristic bluster, and Alexander’s, full of dramatic leadership, epic set-piece battles, and a wide swath of the ancient world - can never be made to mesh well, since Alexander’s doesn’t properly start until Philip’s ends. Goldsworthy does as good a job as can be done, although he’s curiously ineffective at one of his main stated aims: the book very memorably belongs to Alexander. As an Alexander biography, it’s lean and very good; as a study of Philip, it feels as strained and perfunctory as all those other studies of Philip. Studies of careful preparation can be interesting, but when the end sequel to that careful preparation is Alexander the Great, even a saint is going to be impatiently fidgeting for the conquest of Persia to begin ... Goldsworthy’s book is inescapably that book, but he brings a careful, often insightful balance to the familiar stories. His Alexander is far more compelling than his Philip, and though the one-eyed old ghost may rage at that, there’s no helping it.\n\nPositive The Open Letters Review ... true to this author’s rather unflinching humanism ... necessarily a Herculean effort at speculation ... we don’t come to Zakaria’s books for their crystal ball. It’s fascinating to watch this author’s mind at work, regardless of the direction or likelihood of that work ... This book ranges across a wide array of possible changes that might be brought about by the plague, and most of the speculation is firmly grounded in the observable present-day realities of shutdown, quarantine, and economic downturn on a global scale.\n\nMixed Open Letters Review ... Marchant [gives] spirited and well-researched overviews of mankind’s long history of trying to understand the cosmos in art, religion, and the first budding steps of science. Those overviews are uniformly superb; Marchant is gifted at telling the stories of artists, prelates, and especially the scientists of earlier centuries. And the book keeps its focus squarely on the many ways all of that understanding, both flawed and sound, filtered outward to ordinary people, always attempting to draw direct connections between the wider world of nature and the intimate world of each individual ... Too often for comfort, she resorts to straw men ... If there’s a benefit to be reaped by taking that rational approach and mixing in some irrationality just to retain a version of the awe or wonder that the Babylonians had four thousand years ago, The Human Cosmos doesn’t make any convincing case for it.\n\nRave Open Letters Review ... a...fitting sideways commentary on our current world, the perfect quarantine novel: confined to its home, always noticing new things, suspicious of visitors, fracturing on the edge of sanity ... Piranesi looks like pure whimsy, which, however entertaining, is the betrayal of craft and the negation of drama. But with Clarke’s fiction there are always layers of complexity shifting tectonically against each other, and here the artifice around those conflicts is sharpened by being fabulized. The enchantment Clarke manages to sustain throughout these pages will leave even the canniest reader completely unprepared for the book’s stunning conclusion. It will leave them wondering, with a hard look of assessment, just how much time they themselves have been spending in Piranesi’s house.\n\nRave The Christian Science Monitor ... easily the best book on the subject since Douglas Brinkley’s 2006 The Great Deluge: Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans, and the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Beyond delving into the tangled history of Louisiana politics, Horowitz’s book thoughtfully attempts to understand the cultural nature of these calamities ... an intriguing look at the social dynamics that so often play out in natural disasters ... the fact that Katrina’s impact fell disproportionately on poor Louisianans raises a host of issues that Horowitz addresses better than any previous narrative history of the catastrophe.\n\nRave The Open Letters Review Toll skillfully shifts his narrative focus throughout all of this from the broad-scale operational side of things to the personal and even anecdotal ... Naturally, the book’s tragic, dramatic high point deals with the main reason for that abrupt surrender: the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Toll narrates this gruesomely familiar part of his story with the solemnity of a modern-day morality play; every detail is familiar from earlier accounts, but he imbues them a very readable austerity, as when he’s dealing with the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima ... the title’s meaning is a bit of a mystery to me ... traffics in such familiar narratives throughout its length, always guided by Toll’s spare eloquence and obvious mastery of his vast array of source materials. The Pacific Theater has had entire libraries of histories written about it over the last seven decades (with many, many more such histories to come, since 2021 marks a nice clean 80 year anniversary of its beginning), and Toll has written a trilogy fit to stand with some of the best of them.\n\nRave The Washington Post Holden obviously relishes bringing to life her famous cast of characters ... Standing out gloriously even from this colorful cast is Queen Elizabeth, by far Holden’s most winning fictional creation in these pages ... this Queen Elizabeth thoroughly steals the show, both from Marion Crawford and from the future Queen Elizabeth, the teenager waiting in the wings throughout the book. Here, as in all other books, that other Elizabeth remains stubbornly opaque ... This can be as much a weakness as a strength when it’s overdone. Holden hardly ever passes up an opportunity to lean on her reader’s shoulder and whisper: Irony, huh? How about that irony? ... It’s an overindulgence, but it’s this author’s only one. In all other respects, The Royal Governess is spirited, virtually clockwork enjoyment, humanizing the Windsor world through the death of two kings, the ordeal of an abdication and the very real dangers of a world war. Through it all, Marion Crawford is convincingly passionate, respected by everybody in her glittering new world ... a very satisfying reading experience. It’s doubtful the queen would enjoy it, but pretty much everybody else will.\n\nRave The Boston Globe ...a rapturously unapologetic hymn of praise to the roughly one quadrillion ants on the planet ... It’s to his credit that he doesn’t sugarcoat the harsh realities of the ant world, which is overwhelmingly matriarchal ... His fascination with them virtually glows in these pages ... full of just such amazement, most of it presented with the infectious enthusiasm that only a life-long teacher and popularizer like Wilson could muster.\n\nMixed Open Letters Review [I]f brainy college students were still allowed to congregate in dormitory lounges, Headley’s Beowulf would certainly start some heated arguments. There are two reasons for this, one good and one bad ... The bad reason is simple: this is very often and at almost all key points a noticeably inaccurate translation of what the surviving manuscript of Beowulf actually says, and the inaccuracies are all intentional and all tending toward the author’s preferred interpretation of the poem ... But the fact that Headley’s book is useless as a translation of Beowulf (once you whole-cloth make things up, you guarantee that) doesn’t in any way undercut the main reason for reading it: as a poetic meditation on the poem, it’s full of startlingly powerful and often raucously lovely language.\n\nPositive The Open Letters Review Draper obliquely acknowledges that subsequent events have conspired to make the whole Bush family look better in retrospect, and although this is certainly true - George W. Bush being a stubborn dimwit but not a free-associating sociopathic monster - it can’t possibly save this book from old and not-so-old angers, as Draper must know better than anybody ... Wolfowitz figures on almost every page of To Start a War, and although Draper is far too wise an old fox to lapse into ventriloquism - at the end of the book, it is still eminently possible to loathe Wolfowitz - there’s an inevitable coloring of the familiar narrative ... Draper is a consistently vivid writer, employing throughout a pugnacious journalistic tone that can at times leave bruises ... Draper’s narrative brings it all back as vividly as any book has done in over a decade. This is a layered, multi-faceted account of a diplomatic, political, and military disaster, a veritable tornado of violence and murder that fed on outrage and national pain in order to reshape the world, clumsily and contradictorily. There’s no sane way to ease the Iraq War into sense or respectability, and Draper doesn’t try. But the quiet, balanced gravity he brings to the whole subject does indeed, miraculously, serve to lower the temperature on the subject a bit ... At the center of the story is George W. Bush, and his portrait in these pages is the most likely barometer of how close that balanced gravity ever comes to the thin-gruel whitewashing that is the heart of ‘time heals all wounds\\' ... an even-handed historical assessment of a chapter in US history that even now resists even-handed treatment. It’s an important book, and important contribution to the understanding of that chapter, and the fact that it’s unlikely to satisfy completely every passionate partisan news-watcher from a decade ago is probably it’s greatest strength.\n\nRave The Christian Science Monitor Cohen has taken her fascination with – and personal dependence on – one great author and transmutes it into something any reader in the world will find downright marvelous ... The reading focus here, of course, is Austen, and even the most dedicated Janeites will find in these pages plenty of fascinating insights into their author. The book is at once an impressive analysis of Austen’s fiction and a first-rate biography of the author herself ... a shining account of how indispensable books can be.\n\nPan The Open Letters Review Fraternity’s eight stories look at Delta Zeta Chi from eight different angles, but the essentials remain the same throughout: the bro-life nicknames like Borat or Oprah or Nutella or Dracula, the deployment of the starched minimalism that has become a staple of contemporary Yaddo/MacDowell fiction, the carefully code-worded misogyny, and, unfortunately, the serial mistaking of poor, jumbled prose for cool-cat idiosyncrasy ... Nugent’s book is only one workshopped story north of 100 pages, and yet it absolutely brims with the anomie and nihilism that gives so much modern fiction the affect of a muttering Goth teenager. His young characters do crappy things to each other for crappy reasons that are only ever transactionally assessed by either the characters or the author. It’s a gray landscape and an inherently uninteresting one, since it’s exclusively inhabited by vacuous, self-obsessed idiots. And since if the characters were to grow or change or improve in any way that would imply that the author is a simp, a cuck, an uncritical tool of cultural propaganda, the characters never grow or change or improve.\n\nPositive The Christian Science Monitor Tye has researched extensively and consulted more archival material than has been available to any previous McCarthy biographer...All of this research allows Tye to correct the biographical record on a few comparatively minor points, but mere corrections do not provide a ringing defense. McCarthy’s postwar career only makes it more difficult for anyone trying to find a relatable human being underneath the myth ... Public opinion turned against McCarthy, the Senate voted to censure him, and he died at age 48 in 1957. Tye narrates all of this in greater detail and with greater sympathy than any previous biographer, and he recognizes not only the uphill task of even partially defending McCarthy but also the dark associations with the present political moment ... does an impressive job of shedding new light on Joe McCarthy, but the more light is shed, the more repulsive he appears.\n\nRave The Christian Science Monitor ... compelling ... George Bancoft’s portrait is only one of many utterly gripping depictions scattered throughout Union. Woodard has wisely decided that a book about history must necessarily include historians ... The stakes are nothing short of determining how a nation thinks about itself, how it teaches posterity about itself. In Union, that battle sprawls out of the narrow confines of academia and embroils the entire country—and the fight is ongoing.\n\nPan The Open Letters Review ... the extent to which you like this novel, maybe the extent to which you fall for the hype, will largely depend on your willingness to agree when the author tells you that two plus two is five ... one of many such decidedly odd narrative decisions Leilani makes in the course of the book ... This is not slice-of-life; this is Slutty Mistress of Narnia ... Is this kind of stuff slyly profound? Or is it just another example of the chic-progressive racism that’s become blandly accepted among the literati in the 21st century? Certainly a white-skinned author who wrote a paragraph like that about black characters would be social-media exiled to Ultima Thule for the rest of time, but Leilani is far more likely to be cheered for real-world tell-it-like-it-is verisimilitude by the same hipsters out in Willamsburg who\\'ve uncomplainingly swallowed all the science fiction that crops up elsewhere in the book ... There is ample intelligence in Luster, but it\\'s unfocused. There\\'s plenty of biting social commentary, but it\\'s scatterbrained and almost wincingly hypocritical. There\\'s some very sharp writing, but it\\'s buried in Twitter posturing and self-pitying ennui. In other words, it\\'s Sally Rooney 2.0. So maybe Leilani\\'s characters aren\\'t the only ones who know how to play the game.\n\nRave Open Letters Review Thuesen is insightful and interesting and even witty on a whole range of natural disasters that have struck America in the last three centuries. He’s combed through the frightened and impressionistic newspaper accounts that tend to follow such disasters, and he’s carefully non-demagogic about charting the interpretations of the countless priests and ministers who’ve sought to explain the inexplicable, to rationalize the irrational, and sometimes to weaponize an omni-directional explosion. Thuesen does this without much more than a trace of anger; the little miracle of Tornado God is that it can tell so many stories of credulousness and hypocrisy without becoming embittered by it all. The book will fascinate the many thousands of Americans who live in tornado country and will hear the familiar dolorous klaxon several times this summer (and perhaps be unfortunate enough to hear various clergy members try to make sense of a ten-block swath of devastation). But Tornado God has points of interest for any reader who’s wondered what an ‘act of God’ may or may not say about the deity. And the book arrives on the doorstep of the American hurricane season.\n\nRave The Christian Science Monitor The horror of fratricide is merely the price of admission to the family drama Penn here relates. By the time Edward has George murdered, readers have already watched these two and Richard plot against and brood about each other for hundreds of pages, and Penn’s superb gifts as a storyteller make those pages as enjoyable an account of this chaotic period in English history as anything since Thomas Costain’s The Last Plantagenets nearly 60 years ago ... despite George’s sociopathic cowardice and Edward’s fratricidal callousness, the villain of any volume like The Brothers York will always be Richard. In the book’s first half, he’s an undoubtedly brave but somewhat slippery figure, and like most biographers, Penn can scarcely disguise his fascination with this most infamous of Shakespeare’s villains. But as the narrative moves forward, as Richard steadily accumulates wealth and influence under his brother’s watchful tutelage, the intensity of the drama increases ..."
