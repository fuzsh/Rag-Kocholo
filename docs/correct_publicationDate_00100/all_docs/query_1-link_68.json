        "text": "This introductory queer studies course explores multiple ways of defining the broad term \"queer\" and the sexual and cultural practices that exceed what is often called \"normal.\" As the LGBTQ acronym continues to expand (+IAP, etc.), we will ask, how and why did human sexuality become an object of study? And why do we frequently use theoretical language to talk about sexuality and gender? To address these questions, we will examine a cross-section of the many academic discourses-spanning the fields of history, critical theory, psychology and psychoanalysis, critical ethnic studies, literary and cultural studies, sociology, and sexology-that have enabled the formation of queer studies as an area of inquiry. At the same time, we will explore queer studies' roots in street protest, desire and \"experience,\" and popular representation. Necessarily, our approach to the field will be intersectional and transdisciplinary: we will take for granted the idea that sexuality and gender cannot be discussed apart from race, class, nationality, religious ideology, and other identifications. The course thus offers a constellated history, i.e. one that is not always linear, in an effort to illuminate the various attempts that have been made to capture and classify the queer experience globally, as well as in the Western contexts with which many of us are so familiar.\n\nCourse number: HSOC-213\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nSound. Sight. Touch. Smell. Taste. These are the means we use to perceive and understand our world. How can we push the limits of our senses to gain knowledge and advance ourselves as human beings? What other modes of perception are out there? As humans, the amount of information we can take in with our physiological sensors (our eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin) is relatively limited. For example, dogs can travel through time with their nose, using smell to pick up past information and predict disease long before we can. Bats can use sound as sight by echolocation. Dragonflies can see perfectly in low light and over 5 times as fast. Advances in science and technology have allowed us to move well beyond our bodily limitations to gain a greater understanding of the material world from the atomic scale to the universal scale. How do these sense mechanisms work? What perceptual devices have we come up with to push each of these senses to their limits? How does this knowledge transform human progress? Can we gain a higher state of consciousness? What happens when our senses get mixed up? How do we make up for an absence of sense? This class will use lectures, discussion, and hands-on experimental work to develop a holistic scientific understanding of how the senses work and advanced sensing technology (i.e. microscopes, transducers, etc) with no need for prior high-level scientific knowledge or mathematics.\n\nCourse number: HSCI-224\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nClimate change is the greatest existential crisis our planet has encountered since modern humans evolved, because it has already begun to radically alter our future. This course will examine our changing understandings of climate change from the late 18th century up to the present day: how we recognized, quantified, ignored, accepted, and embraced it -- and what it has meant for the role of science in a broader social and cultural context. The course will focus on a series of case studies over the decades and centuries, right up to the current moment. This is a story of hope as well as difficulty, and we will look at examples from the past and present which provide potentially positive outcomes.\n\nCourse number: HHIS-199\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nThis course explores key topics in AI for artists and designers. The three-hour seminar will provide an introductory overview of the theories, histories, and debates at the intersection of art and artificial intelligence. We will discuss emerging technologies that include image generators (DALL-E, Midjourney) and large language models (ChatGPT, Bard), as well as prior computational tools and their creative uses. Topics covered will include issues of authorship, multispecies collaboration, algorithmic bias, data ethics and politics, and beyond. These topics will be paired with discussion of works by artists and designers experimenting with AI. The core objective of the course will be to develop a critical understanding of the kinds of artistic futures that might emerge through and alongside artificial intelligences. Creative assignments and responses to the course material will be encouraged, in the medium of each students' choice.\n\nCourse number: HSOC-504\n\nPrerequisite: n/a\n\nThis course explores key topics in AI for artists and designers.

Each student is expected to propose a brand project to work on during the term. A collaborative project between enrolled students is acceptable, as long as the work is divided equitably among teammates. Each student is responsible for setting individual or team goals and a timeline for the term. The culture of the workshop is studio-critique style. Each student is expected to participate fully in supporting their fellow classmates' goals through contributing to peerto-peer well-considered weekly critiques. The class is divided between critical readings and discussions, relevant brand-related topics and case studies led by individual students, and individual progress presentations and feedback sessions. We will engage with other branding professionals through guest lecturers/critics and workshop visits to local branding studios.\n\nCourse number: HSOC-340\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nWrite, develop, create, and finish a self-directed, entertainment-based project. Graphic novels, sock puppets, CG, and everything or anything in-between. An advanced workshop that offers the structure, support, and rigor it takes to complete an ambitious making/writing project. To earn the three Humanities units for this course, students will: Develop a writing and planning process for large-scale projects; write several times every week; write well-composed texts that 1) meet the drafting markers we collectively establish, 2) observe, employ, and experiment with the conventions of the proposed genre and 3) function within the form and context of the proposed finished work; critically read student and published texts; actively participate in constructive discussion of writing during every class. This is a co-requisite class to TDS Advanced Entertainment Project Studio. Concurrent enrollment requirement for 3 credits studio TDS and 3 credits Humanities/Human credits.\n\nCourse number: HNAR-402\n\nPrerequisite: Take TDS-402 Take ILL-253;\n\nThis course explores the connection between narrative and the visual experience in the game design realm. Its goal is to provide students an in-depth framework for how to approach crafting a narrative in this interactive medium, along with an understanding of how game design mechanics are connected with developing player agency, and how visuals support these elements. Additional topics will include how the narrative experience transcends text; sound design; visual themes; animation choices; and core game design decisions. Students will craft five character studies, create copy for marketing a game, generate a character relation chart, write a list of rewards and punishments to motivate players in a game, keep a game diary of their video game experiences throughout the course, and combine these elements into an original full game design document. Students will utilize a combination of hands-on-gameplay, lecture and discussion, in-class exercises, and creative writing workshops to foster a greater understanding of the connection between narrative and visual elements with the process of game development. The students will finish the term with a portfolio of copy that connects the various narrative components of the interactive medium, including all of the elements mentioned above.\n\nCourse number: HNAR-371\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nThis is an advanced screenwriting workshop that provides students the dedicated time, support from instructor and student and structure needed to move a story from concept to the written script form. Each student is responsible for making consistent progress on a script project they commit to on the first day of class. Preferably, this script project is one that they have begun in HNAR-337 Screenwriting and already is in a solid 3-Act Structure format, with well-developed characters. Additionally, each student is expected to contribute to supporting their fellow classmates' goals through reading and well-considered critique. A collaborative project between enrolled students is also acceptable, as long as the writing is divided equitably among teammates. Pre-req: HNAR-337 Screenwriting, or TDS-319 The Storytelling Project.\n\nCourse number: HNAR-437\n\nPrerequisite: Take HNAR-337, Screenwriting, or TDS-319, The Storytelling Project\n\nAlice in Wonderland counts six impossible things before breakfast; can you count six \"impossible materials\"? To do that, we first need to cover a few basics. This course aims to provide students with the necessary foundation and primary tools for their art and design practices in relation to materials science and engineering. Starting from the fundamentals of scientific practice and its relation to art and design, we will learn about the building blocks of animate and inanimate worlds, how materials are produced, classified, characterized and used; constantly relating those to their impact on society's past, present and future. After covering key concepts such as materials ecology, sustainability, bio-mimicking and nanotechnology as well as case studies such as smart screens, comet dust catchers, self-repairing clothes, computer chips made of DNA, or heavy-duty stickers inspired by gecko feet, we will ideate on how to make the impossible -such as flexible glass, transparent metals, or plastics stronger than concrete- possible through novel material design approaches. We will end with reflections on the future of materials science and technology. Apart from regular lectures, we will implement use of online tools, laboratory practices, and/or field trips where the pandemic allows. The assessment will be done via content-based home-work assignments and a final project idea presentation. High school-level proficiency on arithmetic operations is required. Basic knowledge in chemistry or physics is helpful but not necessary.?\n\nCourse number: HSCI-306\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\n1) In the course of the term each student will develop his or her definition of propaganda; 2) They will develop a broad familiarity with the techniques of persuasion, \"\"perception management\"\" and information manipulation & control and they will become familiar with the variety of ways in which the principles and practices of contemporary advertising and Public Relations intersect and overlap with the practices of propaganda; 3) They will be introduced to the ways in which the imagery of contemporary advertising establishes an environment for the dissemination of propaganda; 4) They will learn something of the ways in which the economics of advertising influences the flow of information and the practices of censorship; 5) They will be introduced to examples of \"\"Alternative Media,\"\" and alternative sources of information; and, 6) They will learn the meaning of \"\"full spectrum\"\" information.\n\nCourse number: HSOC-270\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nWhat does it mean for design to be beautiful, or to be considered \"good\"? How do aesthetics fit into design for social change? While aesthetics are often associated with ideas of style or beauty, the study of aesthetics has expanded to include analyzing many forms of sensory experience in relation to values, taste, and power. The Aesthetics of Power will explore the social forces shaping design knowledge and practice while examining how knowledge and resources reproduce cultural, social, and ecological imbalances. This studio course will challenge students to apply what they learn in order to build more sophisticated design and research methods. This course is eligible for the Designmatters Minor in Social Innovation\n\nCourse number: TDS-442\n\nPrerequisite: Must be 5th Term or higher\n\nThis course focuses on a range of dance and movement traditions in the African diaspora as vehicles of cultural expression, political resistance, and identity creation and preservation. We will look at the religious dance traditions of Cuba, Brazil and Haiti; Brazilian capoeira; Martiniquean Bele dance; African American popular and vernacular dance; and the dance technique of African American dancer and anthropologist Katherine Dunham. Understanding embodied traditions as a particular way in which those in the African disaspora have thrived in the face of genocidal conditions, the course also considers the body more broadly as a vector of identity and experience. Students need not be experienced with dance or martial arts, but this course does require full participation in weekly practicums where the traditions in question will be demonstrated.\n\nCourse number: HSOC-252\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nAt a hinge point in American history, the 1960s and 70s brought about radical change and the emergence of social movements like opposition to the Vietnam War, the civil rights movement, feminism, gay liberation and pop counterculture. Movies not only responded to the rebellious ideas of the moment but also helped shape them. Students will watch a breadth and depth of films by Hollywood and indie filmmakers of the era, including Charles Burnett, Francis Ford Coppola and Shirley Clarke. They will develop analytical and critical thinking skills by examining story, cinematography, mise-en-scene, historical context and relevance. They will connect how the rage and social currents of that time ripple through the decades and unify young people today. The goal being, you'll learn to watch films more carefully, communicate ideas effectively and develop your arguments persuasively.\n\nCourse number: HHIS-232A\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nIs the media liberal? Are all politicians in the pockets of corporations? Is dissent unpatriotic? Is the U.S. a nation to be loved or feared? Is it a democracy? An empire? Both? How are we, as citizens (of any country), to find our way through the rhetoric of the left, the right, the middle? How can we make sense out of the increasing flood of political and cultural information that bursts from our computers, televisions, radios, newspapers, and movies? Whom should we believe? This course seeks to provide the tools to help make sense of it all.\n\nCourse number: HSOC-301\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nThis is a class for anyone who wants to know what the hell is going on. It's going to be a week by week examination of the work of Independent Journalists, Commentators, and Organizations whose efforts, insights and information are essential to finding your way to clarity and understanding of issues and events, here and everywhere else, sometimes urgent, sometimes absurd, and often unknown, ignored or misrepresented by the Corporate Mainstream Media and the politicized press. The Instructor will provide weekly reading and examples of techniques of misinformation, insinuation and manipulative innuendo. There will be a research paper, the first draft of which will be a preparatory midterm and the final draft will be the final paper and determine the final grade.\n\nCourse number: HSOC-301A\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nThis course will examine significant examples of the sci-fi film genre from its early development to the present. Social, economic, aesthetic and technological filmic intentions will be considered as well as their literature and historical counterparts. The course will consider various inferences of utopias and dystopias, ecological forecasts and concerns, gadgetry and technology mystification and demystification, aliens and such varieties of otherness as well as when the genre flows into other film categories such as horror, romance and comedy. The course will be defined with lectures, discussions, screenings, readings, and research/writing assignments; allowing students to analyze the distinctive traits of the sci-fi genre, its successes, its spoofs as well as it cascades of cliches. This course introduces students to the essentials of film analysis, cinematic formal elements, genre and narrative structure and supports students to develop skills to recognize, analyze, and describe the complications of our vast film record.\n\nCourse number: HNAR-313A\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nVisual perception includes both observation and interpretation, and ranges from the mere detection of objects being present in the visual field to the construction of reality and the assessment of meaning. In this course we will study the anatomical structures involved in seeing (the eye and the visual cortex), relating them to both \"normal\" and dysfunctional seeing, including characteristics of the visual field, the perception of color, brightness, and depth, and the recognition of faces. The psychological processes relevant in visual perception include attention and selection, seeing emotional content, and the relation between seeing and thinking. We will deal with the neurological equivalent of these processes, and study both normal and abnormal perception of the environment and the body. The objective is to gain an understanding of seeing-as-action, as a neuropsychological construction, and to become more aware of the characteristics of the experiential phenomena of seeing.\n\nCourse number: HSCI-230\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nAndy Warhol was not only a painter, publisher, and socialite, but also a prolific filmmaker. After his death, the Warhol estate counted approximately 600 films of various lengths and in various stages of completion, all produced between 1963 and 1968. This course focuses on a sample of films directed by Warhol, including a few well known titles and many others that have only recently been preserved and have never been shown before at Art Center or in Southern California. Among the rarities are Mrs. Warhol, the only film starring Andy Warhol's mother, Eating Too Fast, the sound remake of Blow Job, and Since, Warhol's film about the assassination of John F. Kennedy. The course reader includes important writings from the 1960s to the present not only about Warhol's films, but also about the times in which he made them. Each class meeting will begin with a screening of a 16mm print of the week's film, followed by a discussion. Because none of these films can be seen on DVD or online, attendance at screenings is mandatory. The course's main requirement is a 12-page term paper, due at the last class meeting.\n\nCourse number: HNAR-226\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nThe ability to negotiate, communicate, influence and persuade others to do things is indispensable to everything you will accomplish in your business and personal life. The most effective people are those who can organize the cooperation and assistance of other people to accomplish goals and objectives; this is the definition of Leadership. This course is designed to assist the student in understanding the multiple styles and traits of Leadership. Everyone has different values, opinions, attitudes, beliefs, cultural values, work habits and goals. Fortunately, leaders are made, not born. You will learn Leadership, by studying what other excellent leaders have done before. Students will be divided in teams and each team will study various greatest contemporary leaders to learn their Leadership styles and traits. This course is designed to give you the critical tools you will need to run a great Design company.\n\nCourse number: HPRO-330\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nArt, Tech and Science have long been in collaboration, engaged in epic challenges to push the boundaries of truth and understanding about ourselves and our world. From Leonardo Da Vinci and Buckminster Fuller to David Hockney and Stelarc, history has often recognized the lone researcher / inventor who diverges from the tradition and the norm, yet only today do we learn of the collaborative team effort necessary to discover and invent new materials, products, new technologies and worlds. With the advent of the digital age, 3-d printing, wearable tech and VR science, collaborative partnerships are forming daily between artists, designers, technologists and scientists, changing health, education, lifestyle and entertainment as we know it. In this course, we will explore ground - breaking designs, discover the history behind unique materials and prototype products, resulting from art, tech and science research. We will lead our conversation from joint histories, theories and conferences of art, design, tech and science. We will examine differences in methods and funding, yet focus deep attention on the ideas and inventions produced by 20th and 21st century arts, tech and science collaborations from Tatlin's constructivist tower and Bloom the computational game to Muse Headsets for wearable tech. Special attention will be paid to light and space inventions that have profoundly influenced the making of art and science research.\n\nCourse number: HCRT-210\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nThis course is an examination of films and documentaries that attempt to depict and reveal painting, sculpture and other forms of art and architecture. The collection of films the course will study will be a nonlinear jaunt through art and architecture histories revealing the predicaments that face the contemporary art and architecture institutional models that press forth to consider their fields in a historical 'blur'; recognizing consciously and unconsciously the challenge of historical fragmentation. The course will explore the trials film faces depicting art and architecture; questioning what stereotypes may emerge or what beneficial information can be had. What do we learn about art and architecture from seeing it on film and what do we miss? Or, when and how are film chronicles, documents and features helping us understand the complexity of these fields or when and how do they misguide the viewer? The arrangements of films curated for the course vary from new world architecture to, realizing essential art and architecture movements, museum exhibitions, then to venture to a wide and diverse variety of modern and contemporary artists. The course will also explore films made by artists or architects who want to be in control of their work avoiding art cliches and stereotypes often circulated by a general audience and film world. The zoom remote course will be presented through lectures, screenings by stream, readings, discussions, and research writing assignments. This course provides that students will analyze the distinctive traits of film and the information it is strategizing or not, to communicate about these fields. This course introduces students to the necessities of film analysis and helps students develop the skills to recognize, analyze, and describe film and the art and architecture themes investigated by the course.\n\nCourse number: HNAR-227\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nIncreasingly, designers use research as a critical component of the design process to establish a strong problem foundation, to discover fresh, uncharted opportunities, and to test their design hypotheses. This course provides you with a toolbox of techniques and methods for design-centric research as an integral component of the design process that can be used throughout your career. Beginning with a short survey of how research has been used historically, the course quickly moves to hands-on projects that explore a variety of research methods and processes: from media surveys to interview techniques and the ethical considerations required with their use. The research methods explored in this class expose students to both non-discipline-specific and discipline-specific techniques, balancing the research process between form-making, community insight, and critical reflection.\n\nCourse number: HSOC-100\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nAs fine artists, we know that concepts, materials, and processes combine to make a work, but how can we nurture our innate curiosity to feed our work more deeply? Get brave with research! In this class we empower your creative process to reach heightened levels of curiosity leading to a richer artistic vision. We will map research strategies to find undiscovered inspiration within areas you are already passionate about. You will chart discoveries and deal with inevitable failures as you expand your process of inquiry to make new work. Faculty will bring unique insights from social science research and visual art practice to help you embrace brave choices in unknown territory. We will study artists' research processes in a variety of areas and mediums and use scientific inquiry, literature, social science methodologies, photography, prototyping, and material applications to explore new avenues in your practice. This class is a 3-hour project-based seminar with weekly assignments including writing, artwork, audio-visual presentations, and field trips.\n\nCourse number: HSOC-102\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nThis course will introduce students to the practice of Design Research with a focus on the history, methodologies, methods, and tools utilized in professional practice. We will examine how research can provide a compelling logic for design, and employ a range of research activities including ethnographic interviews, observations, and generative approaches. Students will learn how to plan and conduct an original design research project, analyze the information gathered, and articulate opportunities for creative projects. The ethical considerations of social research practice will be emphasized and examined through texts and student experiences. Working in small groups, students will participate in reflective, inquiry-based critique models contributing to a collaborative, iterative educational environment. Students will communicate what they learn through weekly presentations, reflective writing, and a final presentation. The final creative brief will communicate the research process, key insights and opportunities, recommendations for design, and speculative visualizations or prototypes.\n\nCourse number: HSOC-101\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nThis class grapples with the hardest and deepest of all questions: Is life a matter of fate? Is knowledge power? Is there a soul? Is existence absurd? Is beauty in the eye of the beholder? Does morality even exist? We will read selections from historical philosophical texts and address intellectual watersheds that haunt the modern mind, from \"Plato's Cave\" in ancient Greece to Michel Foucault's \"Madness and Civilization.\" Above all, we will learn an Art of Thinking, in which there are no answers, but there aremoments of insight and clarity. Students will be expected to read difficult material, write opinionated papers, and contemplate ideas that can profoundly alter our lives.\n\nCourse number: HCRT-300\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nContemporary Questions examines a current topic or theme of critical importance that is affecting life, driving support - or dissent - in Berlin, Germany or the E.U. This class will expand student's view of the world through the lens of EU thinking. How does Berlin's complex past, influence decisions it must make for the future? Understanding the complex relationships within the tightly knit but culturally and economically diverse European Union will be equally as important as addressing diversity in the local demographics inside Germany. We might address issues around immigration and refugees, cultural integration and tolerance, climate change and energy consumption - or how colonialism is being addressed in the EU. Students will take different positions to grasp local, national or continental EU points of view and brainstorm scenarios to offer solutions. Course Learning Outcomes Contemporary Questions will: - promote cross-disciplinary discourse and improve oral skills around collective problem-solving. - connect students with relevant contemporary issues that drive the cultural, political and economic landscape from Berlin (local) to the EU (continental) - examine the complex relationship between communities: within Berlin or between EU countries. - highlight accountability as a Global Citizen - identifying critical local issues within a global context. - utilize critical thinking and strategy skills in non-design disciplines. (economic, political, cultural)\n\nCourse number: HSAP-884D\n\nPrerequisite: Must be Term 3 or higher\n\nBerlin provides a deeper understanding of German culture, the history of the country and the mentality of its people. Being based in the capital of Germany, a strong emphasis is put on the unique situation and position of Berlin in the past, present and in the future. In order to take full advantage of the fact the we are \"vor Ort\", lectures are accompanied by extensive field trips. These include museums, exhibitions and architectural landmarks but - as important - students will experience the rhythm of the city and various urban lifestyles of neighborhoods. Traveling, being outside the studio is an essential part of the course. Open your eyes, your mind, notice the small details, be aware, discover and discuss. Students will always have a camera, pen and paper to sketch and take notes. Rather than memorizing dates, numbers and historical facts, this course is as holistic and visual as possible. Movies, museums, architecture - a sense of 'place' will help students learn about Berlin and Germany but - even more important - to fully immerse and experience your new town.\n\nCourse number: HSAP-884C\n\nPrerequisite: Must be Term 3 or higher\n\nThis course explores media representations of Asian Americans, with a focus on motion pictures, from the early twentieth century to the contemporary period. Starting with the silent film era, we will examine Hollywood portrayals of Asians and Asian Americans and consider how these depictions have changed-and persisted-over time. We will also look at the participation of Asian American performers and filmmakers in both mainstream and independent productions, including the emergence of an Asian American cinema movement and the creation of new or alternative representations of and by Asian Americans. Throughout the course, we will analyze the intersections of race, ethnicity, gender, and class in films while situating these works within their relevant social and political contexts.\n\nCourse number: HHIS-316\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nIn one course it is not possible to show the entirety of avant-garde film history, but only a slender chunk of it, like a core sample taken from a tree commonly thought to be dead. Unfortunately, history (in the guise of the market economy's triumph) has not been very kind to the avant-garde canon: films have fallen out of distribution; texts have gone out of print; whole careers have disappeared. In spite of these depredations, idealists still believe that alternative film practices have not yet exhausted themselves. Avant-Garde Film's screenings and readings may even suggest possible strategies for an independent cinema that conceives of itself as more than just a fawning poor relation of Hollywood.\n\nCourse number: HNAR-331\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nAvant-Garde Film 2 continues the film screenings and readings of Avant-Garde Film 1, however the first is not a prerequisite for this course.

Since the Bauhaus was the center of new ideas and practices in teaching, architecture, design, and the social position of the visual arts, studying its detailed history leads students to the critical understanding of the current position of these issues. The Bauhaus's historical role reveals the exposure of art and design to the politics within and without the walls of the school. A survey of the New Bauhaus in Chicago illuminates the particular American aspects of the Bauhaus, and its afterlife in the U.S.\n\nCourse number: HHIS-294\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nWhere exactly should a story begin? Does the last and final scene seem inevitable? What belongs in the middle? Every fiction writer has questions like these at one time or another. In this creative writing workshop you'll look for answers by exploring short stories by contemporary writers and by workshopping your own pieces. We'll look at various avenues, including some nonfiction, for what's needed to establish a solid foundation for a story. By the end of the course you should have a much better understanding of how basic points of structure in a story change how we receive a piece of writing. Students should have experience writing short stories.\n\nCourse number: HNAR-306\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nAs one of the most vibrant art cultures in the world, Berlin is a highly multicultural with a rich and, most importantly, complex and difficult history. In this course, we will examine how notions of German identity have been shaped by that history and investigate its ramifications in contemporary art. The travel portion of the Berlin trip will visit museums, galleries and historical sites, as well as to meet artists and curators and attend performing art events. This class is composed of a pre-trip (four three-hour classes) comprised by seminars, lectures, readings, screenings and the immersive 10-day study-away experience in Berlin during the Spring/Summer break. PLO: 1. Firsthand exposure to the historical riches in Berlin. 2. The chance to put history into context. 3.

This course focuses on the history and potential futures of biomedicine and biotechnology, with particular emphasis on the social and political contexts of the science. Case studies will explore topics in evolution and ecology, microscopy and cellular imaging, DNA sequencing and genomics, sex, gender, and reproduction, genetic engineering and agriculture, tissue engineering, and neuroscience. Course material will span from reading of scientific texts to analysis of work by bioartists critically engaging with the contemporary biosciences. The course is intended as a broad introduction to issues in biology and bioart; previous coursework in biology is not required.\n\nCourse number: HSCI-223\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nA society in which one's retina can be used as a key, where remote sensing technologies track our daily routines, and where hygiene and policing have reshaped the public sphere - this is what Michel Foucault has called the \"biopolitics\" of modern life. This distinct emphasis on the body and biological life can be found in every domain, from the discipline of the individual to the governance of populations, urban space, and the state. In this class, we discuss Foucault's theory in light of our contemporary situation, drawing on political philosophy, art, film, and our own experiences. Following on from Foucault, we will also look at how other writers and theorists have interpreted and adapted these ideas to look at questions of political activism, immigration and human rights, as well as gender and sexual politics. Seminar discussions and essays will provide students with an opportunity to critically examine these theories and develop their own understanding within the discourse.\n\nCourse number: HCRT-216\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nA society in which one's retina can be used as a key, where remote sensing technologies track our daily routines, and where hygiene and policing have reshaped the public sphere - this is what Michel Foucault has called the \"biopolitics\" of modern life.

The truth is that the gap in mortality rates between black and white babies has existed for decades. And it has not budged. Research is showing systemic racism, lack of midwifery care options, and lack of midwives & doulas of color as the causes for these shocking disparities. In response to the black maternity health crisis effecting black birthing people in this country, Kindred Space LA, which opened to the public in 2018, offers complete midwifery care creating space for the physical, emotional and practical preparation for birth and life with a newborn. Kindred Space LA is the only Black owned birthing center in Los Angeles. Located in South Los Angeles, Kindred Space LA is a fully operational birthing center and clinical training site for students serving the community of color. Women of color were more likely to say they were treated unfairly during birth and more than half said they'd be interested in midwifery care for future pregnancies. America's black babies are paying for society's ills. What can we do as designers to fix it? In this Designmatters and Humanities+Sciences co-hosted studio, students will collaboratively design comprehensive multi-modal awareness campaigns with the goal of facilitating access to equitable child birthing experiences, increasing awareness around black midwifery and improving health outcomes while addressing the Black Maternal health crisis in America.\n\nCourse number: TDS-399\n\nPrerequisite: Must be 5th Term or higher\n\nPrada pulls racist trinkets. Netflix airs transphobic special. Cannes awards gender-biased ads. What do these headlines tell us? Brands are every bit as social as they are commercial. Viewed through the lens of identity, brands hold the power to exploit, marginalize, and even create social identities. Similarly, brands play a vital-and sometimes violent-role in defining the \"other,\" blurring the line between profit and politics. In this studio, students learn how to read brands as belief systems that inscribe social codes. Lecture content and course readings draw on the fields of psychology, political theory, brand strategy, and more to underscore how brands like Prada, Netflix, Cannes (and more) affect race, gender, and class relations, among myriad other sociopolitical categories. Student teams translate course learnings into a brand identity system of their making that resists negative social stereotypes. They may also find some new identities of their own in the process. This course is eligible for the Designmatters Minor in Social Innovation.\n\nCourse number: TDS-432C\n\nPrerequisite: n/a\n\nThe purpose of this class is to gain a more thoughtful and critical understanding of a brand, its history, current trends, social and ethical implications, and cultural context, as well as the brand's relationship to our individual and generational identity. We will explore sustainability and its impact on brand value, and what it means to create truly responsible design. Students will conduct and evaluate various forms of research and develop brand platforms and creative briefs to inform and inspire innovative solutions within their current design projects. Through class discussions of design thinking, critiques of design work, guest speakers, presentation and analysis of case studies, and development of branding strategies and strategy diagrams, we will examine how a brand is defined and translated through environmental design, product, graphics, advertising, and communications. We will work in multidisciplinary teams in a design charette format to created branded projects to directly implement what we have learned over the term.\n\nCourse number: HSOC-210\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nThe objective of this class is to gain a more thoughtful and critical understanding of a brand, its current trends, social and ethical implications, cultural context, as well as the brand's relationship to our individual and generational identity. We will explore what it means to create purpose-driven brands, grounded in values, culture, and authenticity that connect and create meaning. Students will uncover key insights from various forms of research and analysis to develop brand platforms that will inform and inspire innovative design solutions. Through class discussions, studio visits, field trips and case studies, we will examine how a brand is defined and translated through its various touchpoints. We will work in interdisciplinary teams to develop creative briefs and branding strategies to re-position a brand and communicate compelling and relevant stories using the tools that we have learned over the term.\n\nCourse number: HSOC-212\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nBroken Music is a seminar class about the history and practice of sound in the arts beginning in the early 20th century, through post war, and up to the present. We will look at and listen to the sonic Avant-Garde of Europe, experimental sound practices in the United States, in other parts of the world, and alternative histories and practitioners will also be presented. This seminar is particularly interested in the multiplicity of sound in contemporary art practice and how that can be connected to other known art movements and genres of fine art. The history, technological advancements, current discourses, and contemporary practices will be presented as they are related to the sonic fine arts. Readings, reading responses, class discussions and presentations will comprise the class time. A selection of texts that situate and theorize sound in relation to art practice will be provided for reading and class discussion.\n\nCourse number: HHIS-276\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nThis entry-level survey class is intended to provide students with an overview of how businesses operate and the economic environment in which they compete. Its scope is wide, to provide a solid grounding in business and economics to students whether they leave college as freelancers, entrepreneurs, employees of art and design agencies, or employees of companies using art and design to create and sell products and services. For those continuing with further business courses, it will introduce many subjects that are covered in more depth in additional electives. Students will leave the class inspired to be inquisitive about the business side of art and design, and with a basic knowledge of business and economic concepts and terms to help them function and communicate more effectively within a business environment.\n\nCourse number: HBUS-110\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nCampaign Cinema: Politics in American Cinema This course is a review of American dominant films that venture into the themes and visual essaying of American politics and their rituals. The focus on American presidential campaigns is themed since early American film history. The course will outline chronologically that narrative interest and examine films that contemplate subjects of presidential campaign stagecrafting, attempting to connect voter participation, yet often far off from the actual assemblies of administrative and legislative processes. Also to be considered, journalism, a prominent intersecting topic of this film history, as they are the purveyors and tattlers of campaign stagecrafting. What are party platforms and how are they staged in speechwriting and how are they made actual in legislation are grounds for this examination to help the student realize and progress their individual citizenship. Democracy and its configurations will be examined as we parallel consider this history of film and its political propositions. The course will also review and discuss political ads, current and from the past as well as cinematic structures will be examined and critiqued.\n\nCourse number: HNAR-360\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nStemming from the ubiquity of \"Made in China\" in our daily lives, this course focuses on the history of Chinese ceramics from various perspectives. Of the diverse types of ceramics that have flourished in China, porcelain from Jingdezhen has experienced the broadest reach throughout the world. A fundamental objective of the course is to provide a basic understanding of ceramics and to develop analytical skills and critical vocabulary to discuss material, style, and techniques of Chinese ceramics. This course focuses on the porcelain center of Jingdezhen and explore the nature of its global scope. Organized thematically and from cross-disciplinary perspectives, the class will analyze the impact of local resources, social organization, consumer trends, and interregional relations on the production of polychromes, imperial monochromes, narrative illustration, and fantasies and folklore. By studying porcelain from various methodologies including scientific conservation, archaeology, anthropology, material culture and art history, the class will probe how close observation of porcelain-making interrogate conventional boundaries defining art, design, and craft while at the same time challenging the whiteness of porcelain histories.\n\nCourse number: HSOC-327\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nStemming from the ubiquity of \"Made in China\" in our daily lives, this course focuses on the history of Chinese ceramics from various perspectives.

Therefore, fine distinctions between age transitions and the day-to-day experiences of children and teens are often overlooked. Children and teens are a complex user groups where knowledge of child development, children and youth culture today, play behavior, ethics in research and children's rights are all important to create better products, services and environments for healthy child development. This course is for students interested in expanding their research methodologies when creating diverse products and experiences for kids and teens. It is open to students of diverse disciplines that would like to learn new approaches to inform their work from a child-centered perspective. The course will include relevant theories, play exercises, guest experts and collaborative and individual assignments. It covers primary and secondary research methodologies on designing for and with children. Primary methods include observations, concept testing, interviews, surveys, focus groups, play testing, user testing, collaborative design, and post distribution and longitudinal studies. Topics for secondary research include child development theories, historical research, children and youth culture, pop culture, design culture, cross cultural perspectives, trend research, sustainable production materials and technology, safety, human factors, inclusive design, ethical business practices.\n\nCourse number: HSOC-368\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nThis course has you consider children's literature and asks you to write fiction or non-fiction for children. You need not be a writer to take this course--you learn by doing. We will read and analyze stories for children, ranging from myths to modern works, from young children to young adults. We will examine narrative structure and some of the basic requirements for writing books for publication. You should leave the course with a better understanding of the role literature for children plays in their lives, and how to create it.\n\nCourse number: HNAR-310\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nAmerican commercial films have been the subject of sustained commentary and debate for nearly as long as they have been produced. Their work on spectators in society is understood rather well by marketing executives, by intellectuals, and indeed by many \"average\" consumers, if the relentless self-reference of contemporary movies can be accepted as proof. The latest blockbuster -- soon to be commonly acknowledged classics -- address us as though they are the only satisfactory alternative. They (and their flacks) suggest that it would be perverse to want anything more from a movie. And yet, some people go looking elsewhere for film history. There is no unifying theory of works that offer resistance to the dominant model. A number of disparate tendencies and histories must be taken into account. This course takes up a discussion of a few of them in an attempt to suggest possible strategies for those still interested in pursuing a contestatory film practice.\n\nCourse number: HNAR-351\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nYour ability to thrive in an increasing interconnected world is vital to having a successful career. Leadership in a creative context means being able to direct, influence and persuade people of all kinds. Being powerful and effective requires an understanding of when to take charge and when to join forces to work as a team. Collaborative leadership is about working together to achieve goals. This course will explore leadership styles and decision-making; the impact of culture, gender and heritage on leadership; communication and risk taking; motivating and negotiating with people; and team dynamics. You will learn leadership skills via experiential exercises within ever evolving group scenarios throughout the term. Guest speakers and a range of readings on leadership theory will demonstrate a variety of approaches to the concept of modern collaborative leadership.\n\nCourse number: HPRO-331\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nThis course reflects on collaboration as a way of understanding creative practices and, more broadly, as a fundamental human experience. Despite the apparent undermining of the individual genius by the advent of postmodern thought, creative practice is still predominantly an individual enterprise. However, the last few years have witnessed a significant change in the conditions that privilege individual creation: economic crisis and social movements have emerged in every continent, creating spaces that stimulate values of collaboration, alternative economies and social engagement. We will explore recent social and artistic accounts of collectivism by artists, philosophers, sociologists and writers, and revise current examples of collective artistic endeavors. Students will creatively engage in collaboration exercises and present the readings to the class by means of lectures, performance, and/or other resources and artifacts related to their professional practices.\n\nCourse number: HCRT-215\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nThis course will engage students in reading and making comics, zines, and other systems of dissemination, offering these as a site for argument, for curation, where the maker can explore a theme of interest not just by reproducing their own work, but by collecting material from multiple contributors and presenting it in thoughtful combination. These kinds of projects: exercise writing and organizational skills plus critical and editorial thinking; inspire those the maker asks to submit; and foster/promote/demonstrate the idea of creative community, which is especially meaningful in divisive, distanced times. Students of all majors are encouraged to enroll: anyone with a creative practice, regardless of skill set, can work within this form.\n\nCourse number: HNAR-223\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nThis course will focus on the indelible significance of politics in art. One of the regions where the interrelationship of art and politics has been clear throughout history is Eastern Europe, known for its historical and cultural complexities. For students who are interested in a multi-layered cultural landscape, which, although it appears to be far away, is in many ways close to home, this course will offer rich information and insight into the political and cultural contexts that inform and shape art, design, architecture, and the art discourse. The postwar and contemporary arts of Central and Eastern Europe will be examined as a case study that leads to the understanding of the institutional structure of the art scene in our world.\n\nCourse number: HHIS-225\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nThis course traces the emergence of China as a contemporary society through its visual culture. After World War II the country was dominated by a Socialist Realist aesthetic in art, film, and design for publications and posters. During the era of \"reform and openness\" in the 1980s, artists and students were finally allowed to see what the rest of the world was doing, and launched their own experiments in art-making--even inventing a movement called Political Pop, which caught the attention of curators and collectors in the West. Topics to be covered include the dominance and subversion of the written language, the re-use of folk imagery, and the tradition of disguised protest in art.\n\nCourse number: HCRT-330\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nOne of the most exciting cinema cultures to emerge in recent decades is that of Mainland Chinese cinema. Mired in propaganda for the first three decades after the Communist revolution (1949), Chinese cinema finally found its authentic voice with the Fifth Generation, which emerged in the 1980s. These talented and ambitious filmmakers were graduates of the Beijing Film Academy, which had been shut down during the disastrous Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), and they were eager to tell stories truthful to the modern Chinese experience --- while eloquently using cinema language. The films they made --- such as \"Yellow Earth,\" \"Raise the Red Lantern,\" and \"Blue Kite\" --- were often banned at home but found audiences abroad through international film festivals, and the directors were lauded as auteurs. Today, Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou are internationally recognized, and a younger generation steps in to try to capture China in transition. This course will start with examples from the silent era (1930s) and Communist propaganda films (early 1970s), then quickly move into the films that became international sensations. Also covered will be the art films of Feng Xiaogang and Jia Zhangke.\n\nCourse number: HCRT-302\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nWhat defines a place, and how have our notions of place changed and evolved during the modern and postmodern eras? In this course, we'll examine the cultural, social, political, and economic forces at play in the design of spatial experiences. Beginning with industrialism and the start of the modern age, we'll explore how ideas about the nature of everyday life begin to change paradigms of thought in art, politics, and philosophy; eventually altering both the practice and products of design. Following this thread through to postmodernism, we will examine the ways these shifting ideas continue to develop, and manifest in contemporary design work, paying particular attention to the design elements of place; including: commercial, domestic, civic and recreational spaces. Design as a cultural product, will serve as a framework to investigate and discuss the evolution of place in multiple contexts as experienced by many users. In addition to design examples, we will look at precedents in art, architecture, film and literature. Readings will consist of key theoretical texts of the period. As we unpack the meanings of place, we will develop a critical lens through which we can better analyze and apply to our own work.\n\nCourse number: HHIS-393\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nIn this course, students will learn how to write scripts for animated television series and to prepare an original \"pitch bible.\" The class will discuss building compelling families of characters, stages of crafting a script, narrative arcs, the collaborative job of a TV writer, writing effective dialogue, and the distinct job of \"showrunning\" a TV series. Eric Lewald has written for television, primarily in animation, for over thirty years, working for all of the major studios and television networks. He has \"showrun\" 14 series, including the 1990s X-Men, and is the author of two books on that hit show. Whether students hope to become professional writers for television, movies, commercials, or games, the narrative skills needed to create compelling script-based intellectual property are similar. Those are the skills we will focus on in this class.\n\nCourse number: HNAR-315A\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nThis course is designed to provide students with both the historical context and foundational research skills they need to create art, design, and media for both local and global social innovation. During the first half of the term we will analyze social documentary photography, human-centered design, museum exhibitions, films, urban planning, and architecture to help students establish a framework for understanding creative interventions into international development and social advocacy. Building on this context, each student will conduct an independent research project that investigates a topic or opportunity within the field of social impact. Students will create images, objects, and writing as part of an integrated research practice, and revise these materials in ways appropriate to the practices of art and design; they will also practice design research and introductory ethnographic field methods in order to gain fresh insight on their chosen topics. Students will be challenged to think critically about the cultural, political, and economic effects of art and design interventions. Final projects will consist of a presentation and a short paper detailing each student's research experiences and reflections.\n\nCourse number: HSOC-206\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nThis course is designed to focus on collaborating in teams. Stimulating and facilitating creative thinking enables diverse groups to generate innovative ideas that impact business. Creative collaboration is about being able to direct, influence and persuade people of all kinds. The fundamental skills and best practices of successful group dynamics in situational leadership, effective communication, flexible delegation, negotiation, planning and addressing meaningful problems will be explored. Through experiential exercises within ever evolving group scenarios, you will increase your capacity and become confident in your ability to thrive in a variety of collaborative environments. The experimental structure of the course creates an opportunity for you to exercise your imagination and take ownership of the collective learning process. In addition, several team projects and a range of theoretical readings will demonstrate a variety of interesting approaches to creative collaboration.\n\nCourse number: HPRO-332\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nThe goal of the course is to provide an understanding of the structure, relevance, delivery and preparation needed for persuasive and compelling presentations and critiques. This course can raise awareness of what professionals do to develop and sell their ideas. Presenting well is a requirement for the development of the designer's voice and the work itself. This course gives a designer, solo or in a team, what they need to be able to craft effective presentations to large and small audiences, in virtual or physical spaces. Critiquing methods will be reviewed and practiced to enable students to effectively give and receive input on their ideas and the ideas from their teams.\n\nCourse number: HPRO-201\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nThis course, is an exploration of the use of new and emergent technologies in the generation and execution of a creative design process. Students will be introduced to a range of digital tools with both physical and virtual implications, and use these tools to innovate, iterate and develop solutions to discrete problems. Students will explore of a wide range of current technologies and media, as well as the value and nature of human interaction with technology as part of the design process. Subjects will include: prototyping, code as Medium, emerging tech, and interaction. The course will be structured by a series of one-to-two-week long assignments culminating in a longer final project. Course Learning Outcomes: 1. Prototyping: Students will be able to construct working prototypes of experiences across a continuum of technologies and media. 2. Code as Medium: Students will learn how the use of code can be an integral part of the creative process - that code can generate design, not just execute it. 3. Emerging tech: Students will learn about a range of emerging design and production technologies and explore how to apply these to creative project work. 4. Interaction: Students will be able to identify and communicate how, where, when, and why people connect to interactive experiences. 5. Interaction: Students will be able to design with intent: prototype, test and refine an interaction incorporating feedback from users.\n\nCourse number: HSCI-102\n\nPrerequisite: n/a\n\nThe capstone project is a manuscript that each Creative Writing Minor candidate builds and refines during a semester: A collection of poems, a short story or several, image/text hybrid work, a screenplay, stage play, or any combination of genres the candidate wishes to work on. Capstone Seminar offers the time, structure, support, and rigor it takes to complete such a project, plus the opportunity to engage in this process in community. Along with refining their own manuscript to its most successful iteration, each participant will be responsible for contributing to their classmates' progress through thoughtful reading and discussion. At the end of Capstone Seminar, each candidate submits a manuscript that represents the work of which they are most proud, or that they feel to be most representative of their arc of improvement from the previous other four courses of the Creative Writing Minor.\n\nCourse number: HCRW-350\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nThis class is a study of films and videos made by artists who have a unique approach to process and to relationships between form and content. We will look at works by women from around the world in the fields of Experimental Film, Video Art, Independent film and internet based projects, among other practices. Some examples include the films of Akosua Adoma Owusu, Cheryl Dunye, Peggy Ahwesh, Ana Mendieta, Shambhavi Kaul, Yvonne Rainer and Sophie Calle. Rather than looking at the films through established theoretical frameworks of film or women's studies, we will be engaging a more open approach by which we allow the frameworks to emerge from the works themselves. Our involvement with this experimental pedagogy includes reading and discussing primary source materials (artist writings) and other theoretical texts and keeping written entries for every artist and every film. We will ask ourselves questions such as ..what is the role of influence and lineage in these works? How are notions of collaboration conceived and enacted? How does the presence of personal material interact with other types of subject matter? Part of the objective of this class is to expose you to a greater number of works by women than you would otherwise see. There'll be visiting artists and field trips around town. This class is open to everyone.\n\nCourse number: HNAR-352\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nThis course is a weekly 3-hour seminar in which students build a strong foundation in the theories and discourses surrounding visual culture, mass media, and design. Rather than proceeding chronologically, students investigate ideas through a series of overlapping and interrelated thematics with the goal of developing frameworks that enable a robust and critically engaged media design practice. The course materials will address a variety of media and design practices as they intersect with key theoretical discourses. Most of the texts will focus on topics related to American and European visual culture, but not to the exclusion of other cultural and geographic contexts. Course materials will be examined from a variety of perspectives, and will explore questions of modernity, textuality, visuality, technology, gender, race, and globalization.\n\nCourse number: HHIS-401\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nWhat role might artists and designers play in scripting possible futures, at a moment when it has become difficult to sustain imaginaries of any future whatever? Amid conditions of ecological crisis and systemic injustice, who inscribes the future, and for whom is the future structurally foreclosed? In this scenario, artists have increasingly turned to future-oriented practices as a tactic of refusal and survival. Attending to their work, this course will examine a range of global practices spanning Afrofuturisms, Arab Futurisms, Indigenous Futurisms, Latinx Futurisms, Sinofuturisms, and SWANA Futurisms, among others. Artists' projects will be paired with critical texts by Black Quantum Futurism, Grace Dillon, T. J. Demos, Kodwo Eshun, Yuk Hui, Kara Keeling, Jussi Parikka, Sofia Samatar, and others. Students will coproduce the course's assessment rubrics, and will participate in the design of the class as active co-creators of curriculum through student-generated modules.\n\nCourse number: HSOC-420\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nCrowds are typical of modern urban experience: audiences and spectators, commuters and shoppers, protesters and believers all participate in the logic of the crowd. But what does it mean to join the masses, to be counted amongst the population, or to disappear into the multitude? At the turn of the twentieth century we understood the crowd as a dangerous figure to be feared and suppressed, but now we seem to have new categories of both 'crowd intelligence' and 'smart cities'. How should we understand the aesthetics and politics of the crowd today? This seminar course will look at the history and theory of crowds, cross-examining the group psychology of the modern masses with the urban biopolitics of population, circulation, and complexity. Through a range of historical and theoretical readings, the course will provide an interdisciplinary introduction to the crowd and its impact on our understanding of mass media, mass culture, and modern life.\n\nCourse number: HSOC-223\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nCrowds are typical of modern urban experience: audiences and spectators, commuters and shoppers, protesters and believers all participate in the logic of the crowd.

By the end of the course the student should understand the basic institutions of all cultures as well as be able to discuss the traits, rituals, and lifeways of several specific cultures. We will answer the following questions: Why do people in different parts of the world act so strangely and why should design and art students care? How do anthropologists discover the design of culture? Why do mothers in the Beng culture give their babies chili pepper enemas? Why do you speak with an accent when you learn a second language? When is your wife's mother also your father's sister? Why is Indian food served on metal trays? and many others.\n\nCourse number: HSOC-112\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nDigital devices and infrastructures have outsized implications for collective life today. Like all technologies, they are the result of coordinated human activity that produces innovation through research, business, design, and daily life. This class introduces students to the anthropological analysis of these practices, offering tools for thinking critically about the cultural contexts and impacts of emerging technology. What makes particular corners of the world famous as hotbeds of \"disruptive\" thinking? How do online platforms shape their users and how do users transform these platforms in turn? How does technology reflect and inform contemporary struggles over race, gender, class, colonialism, and governance? By asking questions like these, we will develop tools for understanding technology as a product of cultural practice; an agent of social change; and an object of collective deliberation. Constructed as a seminar, this course will include readings from anthropology, science and technology studies, fiction, and other fields, alongside weekly writing responses and a final design proposal.\n\nCourse number: HHIS-381\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nDigital devices and infrastructures have outsized implications for collective life today.

His name was Dante Alighieri, and he became so important to the development of European literature that we have come to know him simply by his first name, Dante. The story he told was of a single person's journey through the Medieval Catholic Otherworld, that is, a journey through Hell, Purgatory and Heaven. He called his work a comedy (Commedia in Italian) and his first biographer, Giovanni Boccaccio (arguably the inventor of the novel as a literary form), pronounced the work \"Divine.\" Since then, the whole trilogy has been know as the Divine Comedy (Divina Commedia, in Italian.) In this course we will closely read the first book of the Commedia, Hell (L'Inferno) in which the main character, also called Dante, is guided through the horrors of Hell by the Roman poet Virgil. The journey is surreal, horrifying, sometimes funny, often touching. It is also, in addition to being one of the great stories, an encyclopedia, into which the author Dante poured all his knowledge of the 14th century world: spiritual, psychological, philosophical, political, astrological and scientific. The Inferno has been an inspiration for artists, writers, musicians, theologians and scholars for almost as long as it's existed. Together we'll delve into the strange, dreamlike, always exciting world that Dante created. The gates of Hell, according to Dante, have an inscription that ends with the famous sentence, \"Abandon all hope you who enter.\" In this course we'll keep hope alive as we lower ourselves into the inferno with one of humanity's great and compelling poets.\n\nCourse number: HNAR-319\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nIn this Design Matters TDS, students will zero in on possible futures of DEAD MALLS. We start by asking two key questions. First: Should dead, unused suburban malls be resurrected or remain ancient commercial ruins of twentieth century spatial planning? Second: If they are to be resurrected, what if Dead Malls could be turned into Healthy Space - healthy for living, learning, working, healing and play? Given the urban and suburban complexity the topic, we will learn from guest speakers, panel discussions, field trips and workshops regarding how to transforming large scale \"dead\" and unused architecture into viable community-centers, such as, Equity housing, Community health centers, educational centers for Green Living or Entertainment Centers. Our focus will be on healthy options - healthy for people, planet and profit. This course is eligible for the Designmatters Minor in Social Innovation\n\nCourse number: TDS-439\n\nPrerequisite: Must be 5th Term or higher\n\nDeath lurks behind everything we do. It generates fear, grief, and shame, but also ambition, hope, and curiosity. To confront it, we'll conduct class more as a philosophical experiment than a traditional academic exercise. You'll be asked to read about death and dying every week, produce new designs and artworks, and participate fully in class discussions. In the process, we'll focus on some traditional philosophical questions: Is death an evil? Is survival after death likely (or even desirable)? How is death related to creativity? to personhood? to eroticism? We'll address difficult ethical issues like suicide, euthanasia, abortion, capital punishment, war, martyrdom, genocide, the exploitation of death, and the eating of animals. We won't conclude much of anything, but ideally we'll each gain a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world.\n\nCourse number: HCRT-306\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nDesign does not unfold in a vacuum. Increasingly, the discipline is called to examine its connections to larger material, economic, and cultural networks. This class offers a window onto crucial domains hidden from the usual view from the studio to see how this broader world lives within the work of design. In dialogue with ideas from anthropology, history, economics and elsewhere and engaging in a series of collaborative projects surrounding the Los Angeles design ecology, the class will examine where design's materials come from; how these resources are transformed through varied forms of skill; and the diverse economies in which design circulates and is made meaningful. Throughout the course, students will work in close collaboration with the instructor and selected designers in the creation of original research and projects.\n\nCourse number: HSOC-326\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\n\"Just squat down awhile and after that things begin to happen.\" - Zora Neale Hurston Ethnographic methods are central to the work of anthropology, and this qualitative approach has been increasingly adopted by designers seeking to understand their users and the cultural contexts in which they intervene. This course offers an introduction to ethnography as it has been practiced and transformed in anthropology and beyond, along with practical tools for generating ethnographic insights for use in the design process. Premised on hands-on engagement across cultural contexts, ethnography traces the varied shape of cultural life, aspiring to grounded, respectful, and dialogic accounts of the everyday. Such insights offer a vital resource for designers interested in developing innovative and ethical solutions to collective challenges. During this course, students will learn a variety of ethnographic methods while employing them at a chosen fieldsite. The resulting data will inform the development of a final project. Course readings and discussions will offer an introduction to debates in ethnographic theory; the application of qualitative methods in design research; techniques for data coding and analysis; as well as the politics and ethics of research.\n\nCourse number: HSOC-230\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nDesign for Social Innovation. Design for Social Impact. Public Interest Design. Social Design. Design for Good. Design for Social Good. All of these terms have been used (sometimes interchangeably) to refer to design that makes society better. But how does Design for Social Innovation (or whatever we call it!) actually happen? What are some roles designers might inhabit when enacting social change? Who might designers need to work with, and how might they work differently when designing with a socially-conscious intent? In Design for Social Innovation, we will trace the histories, theories, and practices necessary for a foundational knowledge of the space. Resources will be drawn from historians, cultural theorists, public figures, and, of course, designers themselves. Real-world case studies of social innovation design projects from around the globe and right here at ArtCenter will be centered in our weekly analysis, yielding important insights regarding successes and failures. Students will leave this class with an understanding of what questions to ask, what methods to pull from, and who to seek out when working on projects intended to lead us to a sustainable, equitable and ethical future.\n\nCourse number: HSOC-206A\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nA social enterprise can be defined as a business (for-profit or non-profit) that dedicates the majority of its focus toward solving a social or environmental problem. In this hands-on course, students will engage with a suite of design strategy tools that will allow them to invent their own social enterprise and/or consult organizations on the development of new products and services that can benefit humanity. The course is a deep primer on the establishment and management of social enterprises, covering topics including the mechanics of social enterprise, business model design, service/product design for social impact, community engagement, and close examinations of various examples. Through the course, students will research the history of prominent business models in the impact space (sharing economy, one-for-one, give-half, micro-lending, etc.), create an intervention and prototype that tests a new model of impact, and design a unique business plan and pitch that will enable the long-term vision for their own enterprise to flourish. The course will also include guest speakers and critics from the social enterprise field, and students will gain context and awareness around the discipline of social entrepreneurship as well as a series of key methodologies that will allow them to be prepared to design a unique social enterprise including: Trends Analysis, Design Futures, Product Development, Service Design, Business Modeling, Public Speaking.\n\nCourse number: HENT-212\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nThis is a team taught class exploring the nature and experience of time. The science fiction of time travel has greatly enhanced the thinking about the nature of time and the role of time in the sciences and in art. Broken into three topical modules, we wondrously explore the conceptual intersections of the neurology, the psychology, and the physics/mathematics around the thread of fictional time travel. In the first and second modules, we study the brain as a time traveling machine, analyzing biochemical arguments ranging from short term synaptic plasticity and dependent networks, to the way the brain creates the experience of past, present and future. In the third module we will explore special relativity arguments regarding time dilation and length contraction, and discuss new research on the role of computational fitness driving the flow of time. We will analyze time travel using novel ideas regarding the black and white holes of general relativity, and multiple time dimensions. Throughout the class we will reflect on how artists have explored the complexities and paradoxes of time travel, and in the final project of the class we will encourage students to find creative applications for the theoretical content of the class.\n\nCourse number: HSCI-272\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nDesign is following the pathway of any professional practice, moving towards taking responsibility for the function at the enterprise level. Design started out making artifacts, then moved into design thinking, and now is at the juncture of getting a seat at the table in the C suite. This course offers students the opportunity to bring a variety of learning acquired from their business minor and design major and apply them to an all-encompassing portfolio piece that can demonstrate their potential for design leadership. During the course they learn from professionals that practice in the industry of their choice, consider trends that are impacting their discipline, and how they can differentiate in face of competition to create an ownable proposition. As basic competencies in design become standard for employees without formal design education, this business minor capstone places the skills of designers and artists beyond the context of artifact making and into that of creating value and impacting change across organizations, and thus across society. The course enables the designer to create a holistic business system around a design solution to further the intent of the artist or designer while harnessing cultural movement and sustainability goals.\n\nCourse number: HBUS-303\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nThis course will provide students with the opportunity to collaborate with INSEAD MBA students and be taught by INSEAD faculty and industry experts while they work on the development, testing and management of a digital product. This course will give you an overview of how to become an effective product manager of digital products. During the INSEAD portion, designers with work with 4-5 MBA students, developing and testing a digital product concept. MBAs are expected to have a hands-on role in all stages of the project and the designers will be both coaches and active participants. ACCD participants be collaborating with INSEAD students in various time zones. In addition to the synchronous INSEAD component, the course will include an ACCD IxD mini course to prepare for the INSEAD project. The first half of the term will focus on fundamentals of Interaction Design with an emphasis on methods relevant to collaborating with Product Managers in a business context. At the midterm, each project team will present an overview of their Minimum Viable Product (MVP), business strategy, product features and functionality, and present interactive demos of primary features of the MVP for a product redesign project. Registration by application only. Please contact Study Away Department for details.\n\nCourse number: HBUS-330\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nDistinctions between \"real\" life and the cultural experiences facilitated by digital platforms are increasingly difficult to maintain. No longer spaces that merely supplement or distract from our ordinary lives, online worlds are integral to the creation and maintenance of contemporary identities, work flows, communities, and more. This class takes an ethnographic approach to understanding the variety and significance of life online. Premised on deep engagement across cultural contexts, ethnography aspires to grounded, respectful, and dialogic accounts of the everyday. Over the course of the term, students will be introduced to anthropological precedents and hands-on methods for learning about and from the digital. As global crisis forces more and more of social life online, the research tools provided in this class are of growing importance-both to scholars interested in understanding transformations to contemporary life and designers working to develop innovative and ethical solutions to collective challenges. During this course, students will learn a variety of ethnographic methods while employing them at a chosen online fieldsite. The resulting data will inform the development of a final project. Course readings and discussions will offer an introduction to debates in ethnographic theory; the application of qualitative methods in research; techniques for data analysis; as well as the politics and ethics of research.\n\nCourse number: HSOC-315\n\nPrerequisite: Must have taken: HMN-100/HWRI-102 Writing Studio, or HMN-101/HWRI-101 Writing Studio Intensive, or Pass the Writing Placement Exam\n\nDocumentary Film is a survey of non-fiction films, most from this century, but all reflecting on concerns left over from the previous one. The topics addressed include the way people work, resist oppression, and invent culture; and, most importantly, how they have persistently envisioned utopia, often with results at variance with their intentions. Spectators and critics have at times declared the practice of making documentaries perverse or meaningless, yet these films continue to have popular appeal; indeed, the public's appetite for them only seems to grow as the notion of non-fiction itself threatens to be evacuated by advances in computer graphics, public relations, and cosmetic surgery. The genre has attracted filmmakers interested in everything from exploitation to edification; what their works have in common is a relationship to life as it is lived. Students curious about how our society came to be how it is today will find some answers in recent documentary films.\n\nCourse number: HNAR-344\n\nPrerequisite: Take HMN-100 Writing Studio, HMN-101 Writing Studio Intensive or Passed Writing Prof Test\n\nHow do we get ideas? Where do they come from? Are they just luck or can we find a path that leads us reliably towards them? It is \"the deep imagination\" that is the source of inexhaustible inspiration. As artists we need to understand what it is and how to establish a relationship with it.This transdisciplinary class aims to further that life long journey to inspiration and p"
