This story has all the elements of historical fantasy, and yet the setting is a science fictional world, settled two thousand years ago by human colonists whose technology has been lost. Vernier's rotation is so slow that daytime inches around the planet, taking centuries to complete one revolution. And as the sun moves across the land, the entire ecosystem must travel with it.\n\nVernier is divided into twelve longitudes named January to December. Knobil was born in the west of January, and by the time he is a very old man, the grasslands have entered June.\n\nThe fire and ice stuck me as incongruous, then I remembered \"Catch the Sun\", a short story by Barry Longyear that I read many years ago in his book of short stories \"It Came from Schenectady\", published in 2001, and originally published in Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine, November 1980.\n\nSpace travellers encounter low-tech nomads living on a slowly rotating planet. The tribe moves constantly towards the sun, staying in the narrow band of habitable temperatures between the sunny side and the dark side. As I recall, someone falls behind and is rescued from the ice that endlessly chases them.\n\nThey also discover a second band living on the other side, constantly running from the sun, which ignites the world behind them...."
