        "text": "This is a series of essays in the same genre as Stephen Jay Gould, who is reviewed elsewhere in these pages. The initial focus is on astronomy and different theories of our origins, which was what whetted my appetite enough to buy the book. While Rothman's points are interesting, I personally know the different theories well enough to know that he's not really giving much credence to the natural skepticism of scientists. Having been to several meetings where such things are discussed, I know that they are filled with a lot more rancor and doubt than Rothman seems to imply here (the \"Galileo\" tone in popular skeptical writing is really annoying when it isn't justified). I'm sure Rothman has, too, which makes his tone even more curious.\n\nIn other words, I think his points are valid, but the context is misleading. There is no \"party line\" among cosmologists, who are subsequently prone to petty fits of anger when someone disagrees with them. It makes good copy, sure, but it just isn't true. Anyway, the second half of the book is on a much more obscure topic of scientific history, and I found myself skimming it. All in all, if you want to write some good popular science writing, Rothman holds his own, but I see no reason not to thoroughly digest everything Gould has written first."
