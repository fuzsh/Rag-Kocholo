        "text": "A.I. is not bad. It's also not good. It's like money; it's what you do with it that can be deemed \"bad\" or \"good\". A.I. cannot take responsibility for the results it creates. And yet, people are using generative A.I. tools like ChatGPT and Gemini to 'create' summarization, recommendations, and even strategies by (unintentionally) giving AI systems the benefit of the doubt. But A.I. can't be trusted with empathetic decision-making any more than a business report \"one-pager\" can have all the relevant context needed to make informed and impactful decisions. I like what Christopher Penn has recommended (and does) on all of his analytical findings, videos, charts, and reports: add a disclaimer about if A.I. was used as part of the process. The reason I think this is so important and helpful is that all A.I. today is created by humans who have biases. So any learning the A.I. does is based on the baseline of data we give it, and that means the biased (intentional or not) data sources will affect the outcome of the matching learning and actually reinforce the bias. Is A.I. great at helping with the heavy lifting of tasks and large data parsing? Yep. Should you disclose that when you generate a report or make a strategic or tactical recommendation? Yep. And that's the point. **This post was made without the use of generative A.I.**\n\nA personal post at the beginning of Pride Month. “Humans matter more than theology.” I am sharing this because these words hit me hard. They remind me that I used to be someone who placed my theology above people. It used to be that my religion overrode everything, often at the expense of others. Of loving others. REALLY loving others. Oh, I could easily say, “I love people … in spite of…” which was really just another way of saying, “I love the sinner, but hate the sin.” But what I didn’t know for so long is that I could actually love people because of who they are. Period. Full stop. Standing at their side, **holding their humanity just as sacred as I hold my faith**, not separate, but wholly integrated. Often we don’t dig deep into ‘what’ we believe and ‘why’ we believe it until we come face to face with our beliefs when they are suddenly, personally impacting us. That was the case with the lgbtq+ community—until my beliefs came face to face with someone who calls me Dad. That coming out day rocked me (and it took me a while to understand that it rocked me *in the best way*) because I was finally forced to reconcile (harmonize) my faith with my humans (family). It wasn’t an easy road —disentangling the humanity of it all from a lifetime of religious conditioning — but it was so worth it. And I use “religious” in the context of teachings that either provoke hate or bigotry toward other humans or focus on conditional/behavioral “love”. That day sent me on one of the most freedom-filled journeys of my life, where love became whole instead of divided and where humans finally mattered more than my religious upbringing. On this journey, I have left many of my long-held beliefs in the past and embraced the wholeness of LOVE personified—and for the better. Now I truly do love people and I love the whole person for who they are, not for what they can do for me. Happy Pride Month! ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🤍💗🤎🖤"
