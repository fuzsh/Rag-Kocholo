        "text": "Clearly, I had just not found the right one for me, which is where “The Ball is Round: A Global History of Soccer” by David Goldblatt comes into the fray. Goldblatt’s intricate dive into the world of soccer is beautifully written and accomplishes its goal of living as the sport’s definitive history. From the true roots of the sport across Asia to the modern game, Goldblatt masterfully captures the essence of the sport I (and so many others) love.\n\nI initially picked up this novel with one simple goal in mind: to learn more about soccer. However, I ended up learning a lot more. The novel taught me about how people master their craft: What makes someone a true expert on a topic? Soccer has so much depth across the world. It is impossible to truly encapsulate the sport in 1,000 pages. Can I judge Goldblatt’s novel based on how well it covered the entire history of the sport? I could, but that would be overlooking the moments of quality from inside the novel simply due to an emphasis on quantity.\n\nStarting with the American edition’s foreword, Goldblatt approaches the topic with a bit of honest brutality to the U.S. audience. He attempts to answer the question of why soccer has fared so poorly in the country. Of course, as I am writing this, the country is doing a bit better. The U.S. women’s national team has seen many successes since the publication of the book in 2008. The U.S. men’s national team is on its way up, with Copa America arriving in the summer and a men’s World Cup in 2026. Plus, the club side has seen an astronomical rise. A multi-billion-dollar deal between Apple and MLS has seen an extraordinary growth in the sport’s popularity, alongside the arrival of Lionel Messi and co. Although the painful reality of American soccer remains (the lack of promotion/relegation, dueling leagues, woeful team nicknames), many Americans would agree that we have made strong progress since the book’s release. Hopefully, we continue to embrace soccer as a country. The sport provides a fascinating medium for emotional storytelling, one that is not appreciated by Americans the same way it is by Europeans. The contrast Goldblatt provides between American exceptionalism and soccer is drawn out brilliantly, and it only makes more sense as the rest of the novel unfolds.\n\nThe haunting recount of Chile against the Soviet Union in 1972 is something I’ll never forget. Each word is meticulously crafted to paint a shocking narrative that I was previously unaware of. If you read the entire book simply for that passage, it’s worth it. For someone who is interested in the cultural impacts of sport throughout history, it’s a fascinating read. This section, as well as the passage introducing the Dutch legend Johan Cruyff are some of my favorite parts of nonfiction sports literature ever. I could just keep using different adjectives to describe the writing, but I think I’m running out of them.\n\nI never knew about the dichotomy between South Korean and Japanese cultures at the 2002 World Cup. I had no idea about the Chinese experiment to give bonus points for headed goals in 1973. To be quite frank, I had no clue about Iran’s fascinating football history. As a sign of my lack of cultural literacy, I am ashamed to admit that I didn’t even know about the Palestine-Chile diaspora. These are the things you’ll learn by reading this book. Maybe you already knew all of this. There will be a new handful of stories you pick up that I don’t, and vice versa.\n\nI could continue to list more of the many anecdotes or statistics in this novel that blew my mind, but I won’t make you read all of that. Instead, I suggest picking up Goldblatt’s novel and finding these stories yourself. The ones that interest you and will stick with you.\n\nThe novel is truly more than a book about soccer. It’s a journey of discovery that will leave an indelible mark on your understanding of the sport, in both remarkable (and occasionally frightening) ways. I could not recommend it more.\n\nAmazon: https://a.co/d/81RSTRG (not an affiliate link or anything like that)\n\nDirect from Publisher: https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/302147/the-ball-is-round-by-david-goldblatt/\n\nOr check out your public library!
