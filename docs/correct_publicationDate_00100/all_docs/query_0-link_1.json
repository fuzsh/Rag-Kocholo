        "text": "July 31, 2013\n\nI was sad to see recently that some Wikipedia editors, in their infinite wisdom and diligent adherence to guidelines, have decided to delete the page for this book on the grounds that it's not \"notable\" enough. So much for the description of the book that I'd added there!\n\nI've read this several times, originally in the early 80s but most recently in 2008, and it remains one of my all time favorite books, so I think it's worth adding a review here to make up for the loss at Wikipedia.\n\nIt starts off as a fun, if slightly dark, space adventure and soon develops a cast of complex and interesting characters who proceed to follow divergent paths on the strange world of Patra-Bannk. In the midst of their exploration of the planet and its native cultures, the story takes a somewhat unexpected but fascinating turn into top notch hard SF.\n\nAs the native inhabitants try to understand the nature of their world, and one local scientist in particular attempts to prove that it's round, the offworlders realize that the planet is an enigma even in light of their more advanced understanding.\n\nThe science is solid, and the revelations about the world are perfectly handled. The writing is polished and clear, with fantastic description, great character development, some emotional drama, and well-placed dashes of humor. Seriously, this book is on another level compared to most SF of its time, and even today.\n\nThe author, now a physicist, wrote this book at age 22, amazingly, and he claims to be embarrassed now that it remains his most successful book. His brief description of the book and his writing of it are here: http://www.physics.princeton.edu/~tro... - but it contains major spoilers, so read the book first if you can possibly find a copy.\n\nNot notable enough for Wikipedia, long out of print, even half-disavowed by its own author, but still a great read - highly recommended!\n\nJuly 30, 2020\n\nI have attempted this one several times, and its time to surrender. Not for me. I am disappointed, as this is exactly the sort of story I love.\n\nThe problem is it is clearly a young person's novel, and so much of he first half is hard to tolerate. There is a familiarity to the proceedings, and given the type of story it is, a concise and light introduction to the characters and the world would have made reading it more pleasant.\n\nThere are requests by readers for an ebook reprint...if Rothman ever does make it available, I hope he edits the hell out of it. Half the length might be ideal. If that happens, I'd consider another try.\n\nMarch 23, 2021\n\nA group of prospectors return to an 'impossible' world in search of metallic hydrogen and become stranded. What follows is a long exploration/adventure trek that unravels the mystery of the world of PatraBank\n\nApril 6, 2012\n\nI remember reading this shortly after leaving university and being impressed by several things about the story.\n\nFirstly, at the very beginning of the tale the author tells you that the characters are not necessarily human but will be talked about as if they were - thus dealing with the issue of why sci-fi stories are (nearly) always about human beings.\n\nSecondly - as the book is based on a giant planet about 50 times the diameter of earth - there is an interesting scientific plot line where a character tries to prove the world is round - and none of the classic tests work because of the scale of the planet.\n\nThirdly there is a large, hard sci-fi pay-off at the end of a very non-hard-core tale - which serves to increase the impact of the ending. It also avoided a lot of the laborious use of science as Larry Niven would present it and so was much more enjoyable for that.\n\nI also read somewhere that the story was inspired by Rothman reading Misner, Thorne and Wheeler's book on Gravitation - which I was also reading at the time - and that Rothman had recently left Cambridge - which I had also recently done. So I suspect that a large part of the impact was hearing a similar mind at a similar age.\n\nOctober 6, 2019\n\n… and a little hollow\n\nI first read TWIR years ago when I was a kid and for reasons unknown I decided to reread it. It’s not a terrible book but I am disappointed by it second time around. Rothman is not a great writer, but I doubt he would claim to be, as he is, first and foremost, a scientist. TWIR is basically an adventure yarn peppered with science. The characters are rather clichéd and the dialogue is often stilted. It could lose about 200 pages without the story suffering much as it contains a lot of padding. There is, however, a compelling idea here, which, in the hands of a more accomplished writer, could have made an excellent story. Not much else to say really. I have fond memories of reading this book first time around but sadly it did not stand up very well to a second reading so many years later.\n\nJuly 11, 2014\n\nOne of my all time favourites - this would be an instant e-book purchase if it became available.\n\nA real pity that Mr. Rothman didn't become a regular author of science fiction - though his books on scientific history have also been good.\n\nJanuary 17, 2014\n\nPossibly one of the greatest science fiction novels I have ever read. I have ready it numerous times, and each time I enjoy it more. I just wish it was available as an eBook.\n\nMarch 14, 2012\n\nOne of my favorite Sci-Fi books. A wonderful story."
