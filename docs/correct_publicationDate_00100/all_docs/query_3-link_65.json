        "text": "For all of you who break out in a sweat at the thought of thermodynamics, or freeze up at the mention of quantum mechanics, like a bolt from the blue, INSTANT PHYSICS will zap you through the fascinating history of our most basic, yet baffling, science.\n\nFrom the thousand-year search for proof of the existence of the ever-elusive atom to the varied and heated arguments behind the big bang theory, INSTANT PHYSICS answers all the heavy questions with a light touch. You'll learn:\n\n* How the Greek philosophers used the sledgehammer of mathematics to break apart the mysteries of the physical universe.\n\n* Why gravity is a \"romantic\" force.\n\n* How to tell the difference between a gluon, a meson, and a quark, even if you can't see them.\n\nINSTANT PHYSICS is crammed with special features, including chapter summaries, who's who lists, biographical and historical tidbits, and a host of illustrations, photos, equations, diagrams, and drawings.\n\nThis book title, Instant Physics (From Aristotle to Einstein, and Beyond), ISBN: 9780449906972, by Tony Rothman, published by Random House Publishing Group (February 21, 1995) is available in paperback. Our minimum order quantity is 25 copies. All standard bulk book orders ship FREE in the continental USA and delivered in 4-10 business days.\n\nUnlike Amazon and other retailers who may also offer Instant Physics (From Aristotle to Einstein, and Beyond) books on their website, we specialize in large quantities and provide personal service, from trusted, experienced, friendly people in Portland, Oregon. We offer a Price Match Guarantee, and QuickQuote form, to make purchasing quick and easy.\n\nPrefer to work with a human being when you order Instant Physics (From Aristotle to Einstein, and Beyond) books in bulk? Our Book Specialists are standing by Monday-Friday 8-5 PST, ready to help!"
