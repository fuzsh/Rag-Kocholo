This is for the conference only. You are responsible for your room, travel, and meals.\n\nRegistration is open. https://craigmartelle.wufoo.com/forms/20books-vegas-2023-conference-registration/\n\nWhat is 20Books Vegas all about?\n\nHere’s a promotional video we had shot at 20Books Vegas 2022\n\nAnd here’s the introduction speeches and high-powered author panel from 20Books Vegas 2022. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTrqmZBt-FWUWnxWD2x5Ucg\n\n20Books Vegas 2022 was by far the biggest and best of the 20Books shows (we’ve had a bunch). It is the biggest show in the world focused on self-publishing although there is something for every author, traditional or indie.\n\nWhy would you come to Las Vegas in November to be with up to 2500 authors, publishers, and industry professionals? Because we believe that everyone deserves a chance to succeed if they take the knowledge and experience and apply it to their author business. What if you could ask a question of someone who is where you want to be? What would that question be? Vegas gives you that opportunity.\n\nWe had over 300 authors making full-time money from their writing. There will be something for everyone. Be warned, no one is going to carry you and make you an overnight sensation. You have to do that for yourself by applying what over 100 guest speakers have to offer. Are you ready to excel, reap the rewards of your good work? Then take control of your author career.\n\nThere is no other conference like 20Books Vegas. This show is predicated on the principle of giving back. It is run without any profit. We run this show because philanthropy is a part of our lives. We make our money off our fiction. We don’t need to make it from other authors. So we don’t. We get our reward when we see others\n\nWe have our Live Events YouTube Channel so you can see the types of presentations we have made along with our daily material. Please follow the 20Booksto50k(R) Live Events channel for a great source of information on all things publishing.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTrqmZBt-FWUWnxWD2x5Ucg\n\nMap of the conference rooms:\n\nMonday, November 6th from 10AM to 4PM, we’ll have nearly every major publishing industry service provider and vendor in the house, in a massive meet and greet for our author attendees. Last year, we have 53 vendors from around the world, nine different audiobook producers, including the top five largest, along with a myriad of other publishers, distributors, and service providers. Browse and talk with the professionals to find out what is right for you.\n\nTuesday, November 7th through Thursday, November 9th – presentations, panels, and sessions galore. Nearly 200 spread out through a welcoming 100,000 square feet. The Event Center can hold 2500 people for a single session. Platinum, Gold, and Silver rooms. Bronze 1, 2, 3, and 4. Palace 3, 4, 5, and 6. So many rooms. So much wisdom. Unlimited amounts of experience. Nearly 200 sessions worth.\n\nFriday, November 10th from 10AM to 4PM in the Grand Ballroom, Bally’s (right on the Strip, Las Vegas). Attendees can buy a spot at a table (until all tables are filled). Must be an attendee to get a table. It is free for all readers and fans to attend! Invite them early so they can make their travel plans.\n\nThis is an opportunity to meet your fans and sign their copies of your books. You can also sell books if you want, although we encourage limited inventory because of the expense and space constraints (and also centralized billing due to Vegas sales tax issues).\n\nWe will have over 300 authors in one place at one time, all of them inviting their fans.\n\nAuthors can sell books directly, encourage their fans to buy copies ahead of time and bring them to be signed, get a bookplate signed and affix it to their book after they return from the show, or pick up a free bookmark or something that you might be giving away. And sometimes, it’s nice to just chat with the fans and strengthen your brand.\n\nWe expect to draw thousands of fans to this event.\n\nThere will be a fan Facebook group setup to\n\nHere’s what the hall looked like in 2021:)\n\nRefund Policy\n\nThe last chance to request a refund is August 31. We reserve the right to pay prorated refunds after the show is over. We may pay before depending on the financial health of this not-for-profit show.\n\nPeers not prey – compatriots not competitors. Here’s our anti-harassment policy for the show. We don’t tolerate discrimination in any form. http://20booksvegas.com/anti-harassment-and-non-discrimination-policy/\n\nWhat’s this all about? No better intro than the opening remarks from Vegas 2022, from our own Craig Martelle.\n\nThis is Michael Anderle and I’m Craig Martelle. Welcome to 20Books Vegas.\n\nWelcome to the greatest gathering of independent authors in the world. Look across the sea of people, single drops that create an ocean and a rising tide.\n\nWe have doctors and lawyers, retirees, people slaving away at a soul-sucking day job, and even students, still learning what life is all about. A wealth of experience and knowledge is right here, along with the wealth of imagination. The greatness that exists within your minds. And the perseverance to put those thoughts on paper. And then publish those words, baring your soul before the world.\n\nThis reminds me of a quote by Teddy Roosevelt which is applicable to all.\n\n“It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.”\n\nThe critics don’t matter. Only the readers, those people who vote with their money. They are forgiving if you’ve told a great story, and why wouldn’t it be great? It was in your mind and great enough that committed a month of your life, or a year to get that story down. It was great then. It should be great now.\n\nWhether your imagination or the words you used to portray what you’ve seen in your mind, all of it can get better with practice. Explore within. Shape the words. And then do it again. Practice is the palette before your easel. I won’t stand up here and tell you that any of it is easy. It’s hard. There’s no passive income with being a writer. You have to work at it. As John F. Kennedy said, who, by the way was the originator of the rising tide quote, “We do this, not because it is easy, but because it is hard.”\n\nWorking hard at the right things can deliver a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, but isn’t the journey through the sunshine worth it? It takes the rain before you can see the rainbow, but it takes the sun to show you how vast the world can be through the prism of the rain. Like the prism of your words.\n\nThe world will turn whether you turn with it or not. Life moves on and those who are staying engaged and building a readership for their current books as well as their future books will be the ones who get to slow down and see what the world has to offer.\n\nSuccess is a harsh taskmaster. You’ll be enticed to push harder and harder. Only you know when you’ve pushed too hard. Balance for those at the top. Balance for those breaking in.\n\nBut always remember why you wanted to write that story. Why did you want to educate unknown people? Because it’s a calling. It’s not a get-rich-quick scheme.\n\nCarl Sagan said, “What an astonishing thing a book is. It’s a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you’re inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic.”\n\nSeven short years ago, Michael Anderle and I wrote our first books. If anyone wonders, look what can be accomplished in seven short years. Millions of dollars earned selling fiction while also changing the entire industry by showing authors what’s possible, showing people who want to be authors what’s possible.\n\nWhen the end is only the beginning, whole new vistas can open before you. After you’ve finished your book, then the real work starts, but there is nothing like seeing kind words from a stranger about your story, about your non-fiction. How it helped them through a tough time by taking their mind off their own problems or helping them fix their problems. There is nothing like giving people an escape or educating people with the power of your words.\n\nDid you know what you were capable of? Have you already written your best story? I say you haven’t because there’s always the opportunity to do a little better, be a little different. Find a new audience. Why do old golfers keep playing even though they can’t hit the ball as far and can’t walk as fast? The joy of the challenge.\n\nNo matter where we are on our journey, we can always look forward. No one has ever reached a peak and said, there is nowhere left to climb. No one. The climb isn’t about finishing. It’s about looking back to see how far you’ve come. From an empty page to a chapter to a completed story. To strangers reading it. And starting all over again, but though the page is blank, you’re not starting fresh. You have learned through the words you have massaged before.\n\nLike a seasoned carpenter shapes wood and bends it to their will, a wordsmith weaves the words to build a prism that translates the images from an author’s mind to the mind of the reader, drawing them into the artistry and majesty of the world that you created.\n\nLet’s get to the business at hand. 20Books Vegas. Look at the craft sessions. Look at the business, or the genre, or deeper aspects of publishing like alternate revenue streams. All of the vendors and industry professionals who are here to answer your questions.\n\nThe 20Books shows have been described as “life changing.” That’s your investment in yourself, because you saw what was possible. Then you grabbed it and held on, refusing to quit. Through the hard days, half blind from staring at your screen from a marathon writing session. To often-conflicting marketing and promotional ideas when you’ve run out of money before you’ve made any. But you persevere because it’s the only way forward. Stopping isn’t what you started for.\n\nAll failure begins with the expectation of success, but failure isn’t final. It’s only a stepping stone to get better. To be better. To join the ranks of those making good money being an author.\n\nSuccess is a mountain that we all climb in our own way, higher and higher. We’ve found that it’s easier going when we reach a hand back to help someone else.\n\nBecause writing is a lonely business, and that’s okay, but sometimes, it’s better to be alone together.\n\nSharpen your eyeballs and brace your ears. All of our speakers are well-established in their genre and in the industry. Watch and listen and if you can, talk to people because someone here will say something that will truly change your life. You have only to hear it. And who knows, something you say could make a difference, too. We’re at different stages in our journeys. And we’re all here for the chance to improve our business, the business of being an author and a publisher.\n\nBe the change you need in your life. Be a part of the rising tide.\n\n20Books Vegas 2023 – Registration is OPEN!\n\nHorseshoe (formerly Bally’s), November 6-10, 2023\n\nComplete the sign-up form including the $399.99 payment part which the form takes you to when you finish it. It’s best to do this from something other than you phone as many phones block the redirect to PayPal at the end. Your PayPal receipt is your confirmation. You’ll also get an email immediately from vegas@craigmartelle.comwith the data you submitted. If you made a mistake, only an admin can fix it. That means me or Elaine Bateman. We’d prefer not to fix things like a typo’ed email. Please ensure your entries are correct before you hit the submit button.\n\nhttps://craigmartelle.wufoo.com/forms/20books-vegas-2023-conference-registration/\n\nYour conference fee is for the conference only. You’ll need to manage your own travel, food, and hotel. Make your own luck by whitelisting vegas@craigmartelle.com so you get our highly informative and educational emails, like the room bloc reservation info.\n\nIn the email you receive immediately following your submission, you’ll find the details for the room bloc reservations (Resort Tower is closest to the venue). You’ll need to go online through the link provided in the email to reserve your room. They’ll require one night payment of $99 plus tax to hold the reservation. You will not be charged your $15 daily resort fee at this time. You’ll be charged the resort fees for all days the week of your stay. Caesar’s refund terms are on that reservation page.\n\nComes out to between $125-$130 per night for check in on Nov 5 and checkout on Nov 10. New this year, the hotel is putting a hold of an additional $50/night on your credit card for your stay. Total commitment to the hotel for the five nights is $900, but you’ll get $250 of that back when you check out if you’ve charged nothing to the room. And if you split a room, your costs will be half, but whoever reserves the room in the first place will be the one who gets the $50/day hold on their card. If you have more than two people in a room, the extra person is $30/night.\n\nIf you want a table at the RAVE on Nov 10, it’ll be $50 on top of your registration and you can reserve your spot when you register. That cost will be added to your PayPal bill. You will know for sure that you have a table as early as January 2nd. Plan ahead.\n\nIf you are a vendor (as in supplier of services or goods, this is not for author sign-ups) for Monday, your table will cost $250 plus $399.99 for a conference fee for one person (all on the same form for 2023). Adding Friday is an additional $50 for a vendor table, but those are limited. This will be a separate form. Do not use the standard conference registration form to sign up if you’re a vendor/industry professional.\n\nVendor/Industry Professional Sign-Up form: https://craigmartelle.wufoo.com/forms/20books-vegas-2023-industry-application/\n\nFebruary 1 – conference fee is $399.99 until July 31st and then the ticket cost goes up to $499.99.\n\nBottom line costs (start saving now)\n\nHotel – $650 (plus a $250 hold on your card that you get back upon checkout)\n\nConference – $399.99 (until August 1st)\n\nTravel – watch for the best airline deals or plan your drive if you’re within driving distance. Taxis/Uber/Lyft from the airport to the hotel will be about $25 each way. There was a shuttle in 2022 for $14 but it’s not specifically for Horseshoe but that is one of the drop-offs.\n\nMeals – Plan for $25 to $50 per day for food, optimal is much more because there are plenty of exceptional dineries in Vegas. You can eat on the cheap in Vegas, but you’ll need to plan ahead.\n\nVirtual attendees can sign up at this time, too – that’s yet another form and the minimum cost to attend virtually is $50. We’ve fixed the issues from last year to create a seamless virtual event. Ingram Spark took mercy on us again. We get a monthly Ingram Spark code to discount the upload of your paperbacks (first time and with your own ISBN, not for revisions, limit of five per month, or 50 total in the year).Virtual Attendee Sign-Up Form – https://craigmartelle.wufoo.com/forms/20books-vegas-2023-virtual-attendee/\n\nOnce you’re signed up, you’ll be added to the 20Books Vegas 2023 email list. We will send a monthly email toward the end of each month with the next month’s details and discount codes if we have any. We will update everyone each month as we progress toward the big show.\n\nThank you for coming on this journey with us.\n\nIt’s Vegas, baby.\n\nRefund policy: Refunds for in-person conference fees will be processed after the show, and the last day to request a refund is August 31. To request a refund for your full conference, send an email to vegas@craigmartelle.com and you’ll get further instructions and of course, a supercool form to fill out. No refunds for virtual attendees. Vendor refunds will be processed through August 31.\n\nPlease join the 20Books Vegas 2023 Facebook group – this is where all the behind the scenes information happens: and where the attendees share information ahead before the big show.\n\nwww.facebook.com/groups/20booksvegas2023\n\n20Books Vegas 2023 – Registration is open\n\nNovember 6 – Vendor Day\n\nNovember 7, 8, 9 – Main show days\n\nNovember 10 – Author sales/signing day\n\nIn-Person attendees can sign up here ($399.99from February 1 through July 31, and $499.99 for registrations from August 1st to the show)\n\nWhat’s the benefit of joining us in person? Besides being up close and personal with over 100 vendors, you’ll be with your tribe. Period. You’ll be in the drink line, sandwiched between two seven-figure authors and won’t even know it, because we are all peers at 20Books Vegas. Kindness, sharing, and a positive atmosphere the likes of which you’ll not have seen other shows. 20Books Vegas is not like any show you’ve been to.\n\nWe’ll have up to 2500 attendees and about 200 sessions. But it won’t seem that big. It’ll be as big or as small as you want it to be because we’re all there for the same purpose – to learn. We have a block of 1000 rooms, heavily discounted from normal Vegas Strip rates. You’ll get the special room reservation link as part of your conference registration confirmation. Make sure you have vegas@craigmartelle.com on your email’s whitelist otherwise this confirmation will go to spam, and then you’ll panic and email us. When there’s no need. Just check around and you’ll find that confirmation. Then click on the link and get your room – first come, first served. After they are sold out, the only way to get a discounted room will be for someone to cancel before mid October.\n\nNetworking is paramount – at 20Books Vegas 2022, we had over 300 authors making a full-time living from their writing. We have about fifty attendees making in excess of half a million a year. Dress for the job you want. No one is going to carry you but there’s significant value in seeing how these people work. You could be next to them at the bar and won’t even know it. There is no better place for networking. We are all peers in Vegas.\n\nVirtual attendees can sign up to watch the presentation for a minimum of $25:\n\nWhat’s the benefit of paying for a virtual ticket? It helps our budget first and foremost. And for you, it gets you access to Ingram Spark’s discount code through the year. We had to do this as one additional level of security to get the scammers out of our feed. Virtual attendees will also have the opportunity to ask questions during the live presentations through our A/V team.\n\nOther people will still be able to access all the material from the show at no cost, but that will be well after the show is over via our YouTube channel and those people won’t have access to the Ingram Spark discount codes.\n\nIndustry Professionals/Vendors\n\nIf you are a vendor (not someone who wants to participate in the author book signing on Friday, Nov 18) then request to reserve a table here (we will vet vendors to ensure the right mix & match is available for our people). And this is just for the industry table – all vendors need to register individually as well.\n\nSide Notes\n\n– No perfume at the show (we have a number of people who are deathly allergic)\n\n– There were will be about 2500 self-published authors at the show. Plan accordingly. We have 100,000 square feet within which to operate so 2500 won’t be as overwhelming as it sounds. Getting a room in the Resort Tower is important as it’s easiest to escape to, if need be.\n\n– Come with a full belly, leave with a full mind – we have minimum catering at the show\n\n– The famous Carlos cake machine is on the left side of the connecting hallway to Paris on the Horseshoe end\n\n– No refunds will be processed until after the show is over and all refunds must be requested no later than August 31 (you have to fill out a form). We run this show as a not-for-profit. We have no slush fund. We confirm our swag and catering costs based on the numbers we have registered – all refunds will be pro-rated once our costs are finalized."
