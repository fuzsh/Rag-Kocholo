        "text": "Article\n\nThe American Home Front and World War II\n\nThe United States’ involvement in World War II did not occur only on foreign soil and in foreign waters and foreign skies. It also affected the lives of Americans on the home front. Much of this impact was associated with mobilizing for the war. People moved to new places across the country to work and to train and their lives changed. Factories re-tooled and ran around the clock to produce weapons and other military supplies. Whole new industrial centers sprung up across the country, often including worker housing. Goods like cars, toys, and fridges disappeared from the market. Even doctors and nurses became scarce. The government rationed other goods like some foods and gasoline. People across the country grew their own food and collected needed materials to support the war.\n\nThese articles explore life on the home front by looking at the things people invented, created, and used and the ways that everyday life changed. They include the effects of war mobilization and of conflict on the home front, especially as it relates to civilians. While the US did not formally enter World War II until December 1941, buildup and war in Europe and increasing tensions in the Pacific affected Americans at home. These articles focus on the full extent of World War II, from 1939 to 1945. They also look at (though not as in depth) the years leading up to the war and the effects of World War II on the home front after 1945.\n\nEach of these entries is supported by additional content providing a deeper dive and additional context. You will find these linked throughout, and also at the end of each entry.\n\nArticles\n\nIntroduction\n\nLife on the Home Front in World War II\n\nThis article sets the stage for the rest of the series. It defines the home front and addresses how we know what we know.\n\nThe Home Front Before World War II\n\nThe Greater United States\n\nTo understand the geography of the American home front in World War II, we need to go back as far as the middle of the 1800s.\n\nThe Home Front Before World War II\n\nWWI, Great Depression, and the New Deal\n\nCircumstances leading up and during World War I, the Great Depression and the New Deal all shaped the US World War II home front.\n\nHome Front Buildup to World War II\n\nPlan for the Worst, Hope for the Best\n\nAmericans knew of the growing conflict during the 1930s. While trying to stay out of it, the government was also quietly preparing for war.\n\nHome Front Buildup to World War II\n\nThe Draft and the Arsenal of Democracy\n\nWorld War II began on Sept. 1, 1939. In the US, the government implemented a peacetime draft and expanded manufacturing.\n\nThe Home Front During World War II\n\nA Date That Will Live in Infamy\n\nOn December 7, 1941 Japan executed a coordinated, multi-pronged attack on the US home front.\n\nThe Home Front During World War II\n\nEnemies on the Home Front\n\nNot only were there several attacks directly on the home front by Axis troops, there were spies planted throughout the US.\n\nThe Home Front During World War II\n\nIncarceration and Martial Law\n\nThe US government incarcerated many Americans and others in camps and prisons across the country. Martial law was declared in Hawaii.\n\nThe Home Front During World War II\n\nRationing, Recycling, & Victory Gardens\n\nAs the US joined the war, huge amounts of resources were needed. This meant that civilians had to do without or find other means.\n\nThe Home Front During World War II\n\nThe Wartime Economy\n\nThe US economy grew during the war, and pop culture boomed. But it wasn't a \"glittering consumer's paradise\" for everyone.\n\nThe Home Front After World War II\n\nThe End of the War and Its Legacies\n\nThe war did not end all at once. Its legacies continue shaping life in the US and around the world, even today.\n\nThis series was written by Megan E. Springate, Assistant Research Professor, Department of Anthropology, University of Maryland, for the NPS Cultural Resources Office of Interpretation and Education.
