Rothman, Tony

Entry updated 19 December 2022. Tagged: Author.

(1953- ) US physicist and author – son of Milton A Rothman – whose sf novel, The World Is Round (1978), though suffering from excessive length and a confusingly overcomplicated story, creates a Big-Planet venue (see Jack Vance) of some interest, in particular through his descriptions of the long year or Great Year (each day is 750 Earth days long) the tale's protagonists must adjust to. He has also written some books popularizing physics, and several of the stories about the USSR assembled in Censored Tales (coll 1989) are absurdist Fabulations. [JC]
