        "text": "Download this press release as a PDF here:\n\nThe Hospital Broadcasting Service (HBS) charity in Glasgow had a successful weekend at the prestigious National Hospital Radio Awards 2023 last week, as they brought home two silver Awards.\n\nEmily Page picked up the Silver Award for Best Newcomer and Robert Craw won the Silver Award for Best Specialist Music Programme, for 'Show Tunes Spectacular'.\n\nthe 2023 awards were held in Bolton, with six other HBS members also shortlisted in different categories. The Tuesday and Wednesday Open Line record request programmes, were shortlisted for the Best Programme With Multiple Presenters category award, while Chiara Marchetti was shortlisted for the Best Newcomer Award.\n\nThis year's awards add to the station's collection of trophies, which now add up to a total of 13.\n\nEmily, who had been with the radio station for less than six months at the time of her award entry, said:\n\nI am incredibly proud to have won Silver for Best Newcomer. I had no experience in radio before joining the Hospital Broadcasting Service, so it was slightly daunting at first. However, the HBS team were incredibly supportive and made me feel right at home! Getting my own show was an amazing opportunity, especially as it allowed me to talk about my favourite things: movies and music.; I am excited to learn more about radio broadcasting and I can't wait for the net HBA award ceremony. I'd encourage anyone with an interest in radio to get in touch with us at HBS and give it a go.\n\nRobert, who is also a member of the HBS committee,\n\nWinning the Silver award for Best Specialist Music Program at the 2023 HBA Awards at Bolton, was such a surprise. How can doing something that you love, be motivated by an award? It can’t’. But I was delighted to have Showtunes Spectacular recognised by my peers at Hospital Radio stations, across the UK. Achieving the award is not just for me. At HBS Glasgow, it’s a team effort and I am very proud of our dedicated team of volunteers who produce entertaining radio for our patients, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Well done Team HBS.\n\nThe Chairman of HBS, Niall Anderson said:\n\nI'm really proud of the team who yet again have shown the judges the quality they produce week after week, and the fact that the judges are drawn from both broadcasting and healthcare professionals makes the awards even more special\n\nThe Hospital Broadcasting Service (HBS) in Glasgow is one of a few hundred radio stations in the UK providing a therapeutic radio service to hospital patients. It has been operating since Christmas day 1970 and is set to celebrate 53 years this year.\n\nMany of today's well-known broadcasters first got behind a microphone at HBS including Ken Bruce (former BBC Radio 2 presenter), George Bowie (Clyde 1 presenter) and Linda Sinclair (BBC). Charles Nove (Scala Radio), Paul Coia (BBC), John Darroch (Smooth Radio) and Ross King (ITV) have all took their first steps in broadcasting in HBS’ studios.\n\nThe radio’s award-winning programmes are broadcast 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. They can be accessed through the station’s website.\n\nWebsite: https://www.hbs.org.uk\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/HBSGlasgow\n\nTwitter: @HBSGlasgow"
