The most common reference is to the daily maximum temperature, or \"high.\"\n\nMaximum Unambiguous Range\n\nThe range from the radar at which an echo can be known unquestionably as being at that range. As the radar sends out a pulse of energy, the pulse hits a target and part of the energy bounces back to the radar, but part of the energy may continue to travel away from the radar. The distance to the target is computed by knowing the time that has elapsed since the pulse was emitted. Then a second pulse of energy is transmitted. If some of the energy from the first pulse strikes a target at a far range and returns to the radar when radiation from the second pulse arrives, the RDA misinterprets the returned first pulse as arriving from a target near the returned second pulse. The maximum unambiguous range is related to the amount of time that elapses between successive pulses of emitted energy.\n\nMaximum Unambiguous Velocity\n\nThe highest radial velocity that can be measured unambiguously by a pulsed Doppler radar.

MCDs are also issued on occasion for heavy rainfall, convective trends, and other phenomena, when the forecaster feels he/she can provide useful information that is not readily available or apparent to field forecasters. MCDs are based on mesoscale analysis and interpretation of observations and of short term, high resolution numerical model output. The MCD basically describes what is currently happening, what is expected in the next few hours, the meteorological reasoning for the forecast, and when/where SPC plans to issue the watch (if dealing with severe thunderstorm potential). Severe thunderstorm MCDs can help you get a little extra lead time on the weather and allow you to begin gearing up operations before a watch is issued. The MCD begins with a numerical string that gives the LAT/LON coordinates of a polygon that loosely describes the area being discussed.\n\nMDFY\n\nModify\n\nMDLS\n\nmodels\n\nMDNGT\n\nmidnight\n\nMDT\n\nModerate (or) Mountain Daylight Time\n\nMean\n\nThe arithmetic average of a set of data (numbers), or the middle point between its two extremes.\n\nMean Annual Temperature\n\nThe average temperature for the entire year at any given location.\n\nMean Areal Precipitation\n\n(abbrev.

The moist adiabatic lapse rate (abbreviated MALR) is not a constant like the dry adiabatic lapse rate but is dependent on parcel temperature and pressure.\n\nMoist-adiabatic\n\n(Also known as saturation-adiabatic process.) An adiabatic process for which the air is saturated and may contain liquid water. A distinction is made between the reversible process, in which total water is conserved, and the pseudoadiabatic or irreversible moist adiabatic process, in which liquid water is assumed to be removed as soon as it is condensed.\n\nMoisture\n\nRefers to the water vapor content in the atmosphere, or the total water, liquid, solid or vapor, in a given volume of air.\n\nMoisture Advection\n\nTransport of moisture by horizontal winds.\n\nMoisture Convergence\n\nA measure of the degree to which moist air is converging into a given area, taking into account the effect of converging winds and moisture advection. Areas of persistent moisture convergence are favored regions for thunderstorm development, if other factors (e.g., instability) are favorable.\n\nMoisture Equivalent\n\nIn hydrologic terms, the ratio of the weight of water which the soil, after saturation, will retain against a centrifugal force 1,000 times the force of gravity, to the weight of the soil when dry. The ratio is stated as a percentage.\n\nMoisture Ridge\n\nAn axis of relatively high dew point values. This axis is sometimes referred to as a 'moist tongue'.\n\nMolecule\n\nThe smallest particle of a substance that retains the properties of the substance and is composed of one or more atoms.\n\nMonitor Stage\n\nThe stage which, when reached by a rising stream, represents the level where appropriate officials (e.g., county sheriff, civil defense officials, or bypass gate operators) are notified of the threat of possible flooding. (Used if different from action stage, and at the discretion of the WFO or river forecast center [RFC].) The term \"alert stage\" is to be used instead of warning stage. Monitor stage or caution stage may be used instead of alert stage in some parts of the country. see/ alert stage/.\n\nMonostatic Radar\n\nA radar that uses a common antenna for both transmitting and receiving.\n\nMonsoon\n\nA thermally driven wind arising from differential heating between a land mass and the adjacent ocean that reverses its direction seasonally.\n\nMonthly Climatological Report\n\nThis climatological product is issued once a month by each National Weather Service office.

Morning glories result from perturbations related to gravitational waves in a stable boundary layer. They are similar to ripples on a water surface; several parallel morning glories often can be seen propagating in the same direction.\n\nMOS\n\nModel Output Statistics - the Hydrometeorological Center (HPC) produces a short range (6 to 60 hours) MOS guidance package generated from the NGM, GFS, and ETA models for over 300 individual stations in the continental United States. These alphanumeric messages are made available at approximately 0400 and 1600 UTC for the 0000 and 1200 UTC forecast cycles, respectively. Model Output Statistics are a set of statistical equations that use model output to forecast the probability of precipitation, high and low temperature, cloud cover, and precipitation amount for many cities across the USA. The statistical equations were specifically tailored for each location, taking into account factors such as each location's climate.\n\nMostly Clear\n\nWhen the 1/8th to 2/8ths of the sky is covered by with opaque (not transparent) clouds. Sometimes referred to as Mostly Sunny if this condition is present during daylight hours.\n\nMostly Cloudy\n\nWhen the 6/8th to 7/8ths of the sky is covered by with opaque (not transparent) clouds. Same as Considerable Cloudiness.\n\nMostly Sunny\n\nWhen the 1/8th to 2/8ths of the sky is covered by with opaque (not transparent) clouds Same as Mostly Clear, except only applicable during daylight hours.\n\nMount Wilson Magnetic Classifications\n\nIn solar-terrestrial terms, a classification system for sunspots:\n\nAlpha: Denotes a unipolar sunspot group.\n\nBeta: A sunspot group having both positive and negative magnetic polarities, with a simple and distinct division between the polarities.\n\nBeta-Gamma: A sunspot group that is bipolar but in which no continuous line can be drawn separating spots of opposite polarities.\n\nDelta: A complex magnetic configuration of a solar sunspot group consisting of opposite polarity umbrae within the same penumbra.\n\nGamma: A complex active region in which the positive and negative polarities are so irregularly distributed as to prevent classification as a bipolar group.\n\nMountain Wave\n\nThe wavelike effect, characterized by updrafts and downdrafts, that occurs above and behind a mountain range when rapidly flowing air encounters the mountain range's steep front.\n\nMountain Wind System\n\nThe system of diurnal winds that forms in a complex terrain area, consisting of mountain-plain, along-valley, cross-valley and slope wind systems.\n\nMountain-Plain Wind System\n\nA closed, large-scale, thermally driven circulation between the mountains and the surrounding plain. The mountain-to-plain flow making up the lower branch of the closed circulation usually occurs during nighttime, while the plain-to-mountain flow occurs during daytime.\n\nMountainado\n\nA vertical-axis eddy produced in a downslope windstorm by the vertical stretching of horizontal roll vortices produced near the ground by vertical wind shear. Mountainadoes, when carried by the mean wind, can produce strong horizontal shears and wind gusts that are much more damaging than the general prevailing wind speeds.\n\nMOV\n\nMove\n\nMovable Bed\n\nIn hydrologic terms, a stream bed made up of materials readily transportable by the stream flow\n\nMOVG\n\nmoving\n\nMR\n\nmore\n\nMRF\n\nMedium Range Forecast model, the medium-range computer model run by the United States (NOAA). The output from this model is part of what is now known as the GFS model, so the term MRF is no longer widely used.\n\nMRGL\n\nMarginal\n\nMRNG\n\nMorning\n\nMSG\n\nMessage\n\nMSL\n\nMean sea level\n\nMSL\n\n(Mean Sea Level) - The arithmetic mean of hourly water elevations observed over a specific 19-year tidal epoch.\n\nMSLP\n\nMean sea level pressure\n\nMST\n\nMountain Standard Time\n\nMSTLY\n\nMostly\n\nMSTR\n\nMoisture\n\nMT\n\n1) Mountain\n\n2) Montana\n\nMTN\n\nMountain\n\nMTNS\n\nMountains\n\nMTS\n\nMountains\n\nMud Slide\n\nFast moving soil, rocks and water that flow down mountain slopes and canyons during a heavy downpour of rain.\n\nMuggy\n\nA subjective term for warm and excessively humid conditions.\n\nMULI\n\nMost Unstable Lifted Index - Lifted Index (LI) calculated using a parcel from the pressure level that results in the Most Unstable value (lowest value) of LI possible.\n\nMulticell Thunderstorm\n\nThese thunderstorms are organized in clusters of at least 2-4 short-lived cells. Each cell generates a cold air outflow and these individual outflows combine to form a large gust front. Convergence along the gust front causes new cells to develop every 5 to 15 minutes. The cells move roughly with the mean wind. However, the area (storm) motion usually deviates significantly from the mean wind due to discrete propagation (new cell development) along the gust front. The multicellular nature of the storm is usually apparent on radar with multiple reflectivity cores and maximum tops.\n\nMultiple Doppler Analysis\n\nThe use of more than one radar (and hence more than one look angle) to reconstruct spatial distributions of the 2D or 3D wind field, which cannot be measured from a single radar alone. Includes dual Doppler, triple Doppler, and overdetermined multiple Doppler analysis.\n\nMultiple Vortex Tornado\n\nA tornado in which two or more condensation funnels or debris clouds are present at the same time, often rotating about a common center or about each other.
