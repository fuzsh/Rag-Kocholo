        "text": "UK Radio Commercials – Rate Calculator\n\nImportant Notes:\n\nThese prices listed are the minimum rates agreed between the radio companies and the Equity Union, as published in their online guides.\n\nImportant: These rates are for commercials produced by the radio stations only, and not for those produced by advertising agencies. For ad-agency rates, see the Radio Generic section of the Rate Guide.\n\nThe rates are per commercial and per voice/character, not per session. Note that individual taglines (e.g. “Offer ends on Monday” and “Offer ends tomorrow”) are treated as separate scripts, and so require additional payment equivalent to the same rate.\n\nRates are for 12 months usage. Re-licensing after this is at the same rates.\n\nStep 1 - Enter the number of Tag lines per Script\n\nScript: Number of Taglines: Script 1\n\nClear All\n\nStep 2 - Select Radio Stations\n\nStation:\n\nRate: (£)\n\nStep 3 - Has the Client participated in the Recording?\n\nHas the client participated in the recording?
