        "text": "Two daytime presenters at the Dennistoun-based station have been told their contracts will not be renewed.\n\nFormer STV presenter Angus Simpson, who fronts an afternoon show, will leave the station and breakfast show host Art Sutter will also be replaced.\n\nIt's believed Art Sutter will be offered a weekend slot.\n\nNew owners Guardian Media Group take over on March 23.\n\nIt announced in December it had bought Saga for an undisclosed sum, but the acquisition was only formally completed in January.\n\nIt's not yet known how many of the 23 staff will be kept on by the new employer, which also owns Real Radio and Rock Radio.\n\nWhat is known is all of the existing management team, with the exception of programme boss Gerry Burke, will not be part of the new radio station.\n\nSaga FM's managing director Norman Quirk left the station in January.\n\nAnd it's been confirmed the radio station will leave its Dennistoun base.\n\nThat will disappoint local politicians who believed the installation of a radio station in the East End provided impetus for commercial regeneration.\n\nSmooth Radio will shift to the company's Baillieston base, which is home to Real Radio and Rock Radio.\n\nOne radio insider at Baillieston said: \"We're going to be packed in like sardines here.\"\n\nA spokesman for GMG said: \"Significant marketing will be invested in the launch as we re-position the stations to offer greater appeal.\""
