For the record, I assume it's the Glittering Prize video as these CDs have been issued by Virgin's \"Give Them Nothing New\" department.)\n\nJoining Sample Minds, The Blowups and New Gold Dream are Simple Minds Tribute 1984 - the latest tribute band on the block.\n\nHaving already played the Etten-Leur Hacel Festival, check out the band's website for more information, and hopefully new gigs to come.\n\nMusic chain Sound Control born in the days of punk rock has become the UK's biggest supplier of musical instruments and equipment after aquiring rival retailer Academy of Sound.\n\nSound Control, founded in Dunfermline more than 2 years ago, has paid an undisclosed cash sum to the two owners of Academy of Sound to create a company with 25 stores and joint sales of £60m.\n\nTexas, Busted and Simple Minds are among the rock bands that are counted among their celebrity customers.\n\nA leading player in Sound Control is marketing director Andy Gillespie, who has played keyboards for Simple Minds for the band's world tours for the past three years. \"The acquisition of Academy of Sound doubles the size of our business at a stroke\" he said.\n\n\"It gives us the ability to reach right across the Uk, to satisfy what is becoming a huge sophisticated market.\"\n\nSound Control already boasts annual sales of £35m. It was founded by Pat Kelly, who began by providing equipment to bands such as The Skids and Big Country.\n\nTerry Murden & Perry Gourley\n\nScotland On Sunday\n\n14th November 2004\n\nPreviously left out on the new album page, was that the album won't be released on Eagle Records. Despite having a two album deal, and only delivering one (which was Cry as apparently Neon Lights doesn't count) the group left the record company early in 2003. All subsequent releases have been through Virgin and Absolutely.\n\nIt's expected that the band will sign up with another major for the release of the new album.\n\nFour albums have been released in SACD format (New Gold Dream (81,82,83,84), Once Upon A Time, Best Of and Cry). Next year, Virgin plan to issue several DVD-Audio versions. Like SACD, the format offers better sound quality than plain CD, but DVD-Audio is only playable in DVD-Audio players.\n\nWith New Gold Dream (81,82,83,84) and Sparkle In The Rain pencilled in for release, Once Upon A Time will be issued on the new format on the 17th January.\n\nI've been asked several times about the Claddagh, so I've added some of its history and its use on Simple Minds releases to the FAQ.\n\nThe covers discography continues with the first release from 1992 (which was a popular year). Eastside Beat took Alive And Kicking and made it their own.\n\nDec. 27th: 9p.m. & 11p.m.\n\nThe Baked Potato\n\n3787 Cahuenga Blvd\n\nStudio City, CA\n\n818-980-1615\n\nFeaturing:\n\nAlan Hinds, Guitar\n\nJ.K. Kleutgens, Bass\n\nHans Zermuehlen, Keys\n\nMark Schulman, Drums\n\nAnd for Christmas, what could be better than a top Simple Minds rarity under the tree? Forget those ultra-rare copies of Promised You A Miracle that are endlessly listed on eBay - this list is the real deal (scroll down to the bottom).\n\nDespite illness preventing Simple Minds from performing at Trevor Horn's concert in London last month, they're represented on Produced By Trevor Horn, a double CD-set of artists he's produced over the last decades. Released on ZTT on November 22nd, the track-listing features The Buggles, Art Of Noise, Frankie Goes To Hollywood, Pet Shop Boys, Seal, Belle & Sebastien and taTu.\n\nSimple Minds are represented by Belfast Child and Mandela Day, the two 'most famous' tracks from the Trevor Horn produced Street Fighting Years.\n\nA great compilation of diverse acts and well worth buying.\n\nUpdates to Our Secrets Are The Same in the discography:\n\nAn image of the original UK non-mastered CD and the matrix number have been uploaded. Seriously anorak I know, but good questions and nice images to compare with anymore copies turning up on eBay.\n\nAll Jim's comments about the Secrets songs from Silver Box have been added to the song pages. As well as writer and publisher info. (Did you know that Swimming Towards The Sun wasn't written by Jim or Charlie at all?)\n\nAll the song times are now correct. So, Hello gets an extra ten seconds due to its new intro.\n\nSpeaking of Silver Box, I've updated the promo discography with the 10-track, rather rare, sampler.\n\nAnd I've added Kelvin to the incomplete, but growing, covers discography. This rather Europopish cover of Alive And Kicking was issued in 2003 to help out Utrecht FC. And now it's been immortalized on Redux.\n\nI promised to this to several people a couple of weeks ago.\n\nThe Melting Point Of GoldONE\n\nTHIS RECORD is something of a glow. Whatever your preference you will find it memorable and instructive. Find its qualities and fix your place. Be swept, be drained ... This is really all I have to say, but I shall not stop on that account. Indeed, I shall begin again.\n\nTWO\n\nMY LOYALTY towards Simple Minds is known to be considerable, yet even I am jarred by the constant beauty of this music. Truly, all I need to say is that New Golden Dream(sic) robs me of my breath - but let's continue. Be swept, be drained, believe me.\n\nTHREE\n\nAfter their last (double) LP it could be said that despite their undoubted ability, the group threatened to settle down into an overwhelming, agitating monotony devoid of nobility: a heat-switch has been turned on, the looming Simple Minds solid has melted, is melting into a bewitching, fresh sound. Suddenly the group sound acutely aware of space and emptiness, and their impact is a lot harder because of that. (When I say harder, I am just as likely to mean \"softer\" - it depends whether you're stood on your head or not.)\n\nSimple Minds took a certain way with rhythm and motion to it limits; they've now shook away what was becoming a kind of concussion, to be left with a very clear head. And, clearly, a heat. 'Melting' is a useful word to use in connection with this record. Not only are the known Minds cliches melting into new forms and shapes, but also more general cliches melt into new meanings. The familiar deliciously fails in on itself. This 'melting' results in an exotic re-orientation.\n\nIndeed, and this is perhaps because the Minds' aspirations sometimes seemed too great for the pop context to hold, the music contained here is as searching a representation of the meltings between what is 'memory' and what is 'imagination' as that which troubles me in the workings of Beckett and Baudelaire. New Golden Dream(sic) is the perfect attack upon those who think POP too small to think big.\n\nThe group, confounding banal limitations and their duff reputation as kids muddling in areas roughly outside their scope, have outgrown what was previously their defiant restlessness, a celebrated stoicism, and turned their song into an adventure: an adventure embedded in memory/imagination, patient and dark, as intoxicating as the adventure of Buckley, as personally aggressive as the adventure of Joy Division. It is responsible to no one and nothing, it is sensation for sensation's sake, but it takes the working listener to wherever, it suggests to the working listener that ... everything is possible.\n\nLet's face it, it's a glorious achievement to produce something that works generously in the usual sweet way tucked inside the trivialised pop context, yet that stretches far beyond those coloured walls to stand strong as an exhilarated, canny comment on the \"state of the world's flow\", on the position of hope and anxiety. There's plenty of light and melody through the 'Dream' to please you; but enough heat to chill you.\n\nThere's a number of outstanding instrumental performances to turn to - Forbes' arrogantly shrewd and eager guitar, MacNeil's expressive and seemingly infallible keyboarding - but 'Dreams' music is something that succeeds smoothly yet provocatively as 'a whole'. A rippling, humming, beating, rustling, driving, melting 'whole', with Kerr's voice, his glancing, broken words, as if tiny holes allowing glimpses into the worldview that enabled such noble music to appear. The 'whole' is an ardent, tender sound that sweeps and sways between the sly and the open with pleasured mastery; as for Kerr's 'holes', there's nothing wrong with his spelling, his spelling is binding, his images and touches spellbinding. If previously he could be irritating, now he and his words insist on response. And measure the words' intrigue by the depth of that response. The working listener will be quietly, carefully, profoundly re-placed.\n\nThe absolutely gripping opening song Someone Somewhere (In Summertime) immediately announces that Simple Minds have shed old skin. What accounts for this shedding, the 'melting', the shaking away of concussion, is the group swallowing the pill of simplicity: rather than try to make a point or point towards mystery through a rush and rush of overcompensation - this is where many other groups, ie. Bauhaus, flip and flop into the muddle of futility - the group have moved out into the opening of understatement, tweaking will and snatching heart through implication.\n\nIt's the kind of simplicity Joy Division smashed into accidentally and to devastating effect: a proof of articulacy and sensitivity through keen selectivity. The two '82 singles Promised You A Miracle and Glittering Prize fit into this record not blatant shows of concession for the charts but as bright, confident celebrations of this simplicity: the group scatter their assault rather than channel it.\n\nListening to the completely satisfying instrumental Somebody Up There Likes You it sounds as though Simple Minds believe they a creating magic: and in a way they are, conjuring up from nowhere such vital, cajoling systems as Big Sleep and King Is White And In The Crowd, systems that will connect themselves to your experiences without wasting your time or minimising your energy. The title track confirms that Simple Minds' diagnosis of what is up and down about the bits and pieces of the world is as shocking, shaming and indignant as any pop group's.\n\nAnd then when Herbie Hancock glides in to embellish the lovely Hunter And The Hunted, one doesn't sense a clumsy, irrelevant intrusion by a name pianist with a huge erratic musical background, just an apt, almost hidden contribution by one musician to the effort of other musicians. It's a fine moment, sealing the group's (radiant) simplicity, and claiming that the group can exist on any terms - no longer must they be locked into a strained art-pop closet.\n\nSo certainly this is Simple Minds' most distinguished collection. It also continues, powerfully, a period of music that melts and scatters around For Your Pleasure, Correct Use Of Soap, Closer, Sulk, Tin Drum, a music that went to follow through how Iggy somersaulted through good and bad possibilities, how Reed reached below the functional surfaces of city life, how Bowie travelled, how Hamill hoped, how Eno twisted and treated the pop song to the edge of 'the marvellous'. A music swerving and unnerving through recollection and recognition and habit and faded sensations ... searching for connections and new vantage points, using pop to mind more about memory than the order of guitar notes.\n\nSimple Minds have produced something as inventive, as cleansing, as suggestive as anything by the musicians, The Heroes, who first inspired them to form around the days and nights in Glasgow. This will thrill them, for it is still in them to be thrilled. And what will thrill you is that it is possible to pluck something as special and triumphant as this out from amidst all the painful failures. Its uses are abstract, but its signifance is universal. And the feeling grows, as I listen, that they're just beginning.\n\nFOUR\n\nAND NOW you begin...\n\nPaul Morley\n\nNME\n\n18th September 1982\n\nDue to a misprint in a press release, Charlie's birthday was incorrectly given in several official Simple Minds publications (including the Real Life tour programme). If you want to wish him a happy birthday, then it's best to wait until the 27th November.\n\nCongratulations Bruce!\n\n< Former Simple Minds manager Bruce Findlay received a top prize at Scotlands Music Industry awards. The event was held to raise funds for Nordoff-Robbins, a music therapy charity, the Tartan Clefs recognise outstanding contribution to the music industry, at home and abroad, the Ex-Minds boss was honoured with the Music Industry Award.\n\nWet Wet Wet claimed the Miller Tartan Clef award, and were set to entertain the 500 strong audience with one of their first live performances since reforming earlier this year. The Darkness guitarists Dan Hawkins and Frankie Poullain were to accept the inaugural T in the Park Best Live Performance award. A spokesman for the flamboyant band said: \"Touring bonnie Scotland is like feasting from a veritable banquet where every flower reveals itself.\"\n\nNicola Benedetti, the teenage violin virtuoso from Ayrshire, collected the Clear Channel Classical award, while songwriter/singer Edwyn Collins received the Performing Right Society Songwriters award. While Donovan received the Sennheiser UK Outstanding Contribution to Music award. Other honours went to Celtic Connections, the winter music festival, which received the Saga 105.2 Your Life, Your Music award, and The Sensational Alex Harvey Band, awarded the Sir Reo Stakis Foundation Lifetime Achievement award.\n\nAll proceeds from the event, which was hosted by Real Radios Jay Crawford, were to go to Nordoff-Robbins, Scotlands first national music therapy charity. Organisers expected the event to eclipse the £127,000 raised last year.\n\nFiona McGregor\n\nScotland On Sunday\n\n7th November 2004\n\nSome French on-line retailers are advertising a six CD set by Simple Minds called A History. This mouthwatering box is due to hit the web-based stores in mid-November.\n\nAll is not what it seems. A History was the original, deemed 'boring', title of Silver Box, and extra disc is a typo.\n\nAnother mythical release from the virtual world.\n\nThe saviour of Radio One, Chris Moyles, recently played Alive And Kicking on his early morning show. As part of the Buzz Off feature, the song is kept on the air by majority support of either the studio team or the listeners texting in. Alive And Kicking made it to the end of the song with 82% of audience approval and Chris enthusing the album version was even better.\n\nAnother one you might want to leave on the shelf in the shop is Seen The Lights: Live In Verona. Released the same day as Silver Box, this cynical repackaging is simply one disc from the Seen The Lights set.\n\nIf you're tempted, find the double set instead. It's probably cheaper as well.\n\nGood luck to sample MINDS who are playing in Crewe tonight. For more details about the gig, or further news about the tribute band, check out their website.\n\nReleased this Monday, the remastered editions of New Gold Dream and Sparkle In The Rain have yet again been be packed up together and sold as a box-set (this being the third time).\n\nIt's Virgin VBX7, a limited edition which you may want to leave on the shelf.\n\nWith the tour finished, and Silver Box on the shelves, Simple Minds are going to return to the studio to complete work on their next studio album.\n\nTherefore it seemed a good idea to gather all the information known about the new album, and gather it all in one place. Expect this section to be updated regularly over the coming year.\n\nScorpio or God Save Us From Our Governements? Information about the new album can be found here.\n\nDespite Virgin's assurances, some copies of Silver Box are faulty. The lack of one or two discs has been widely reported, but in some cases sections of the booklet are either missing or inserted upside-down.\n\nThe morale is: Try to get it from a shop, and check it before leaving.\n\nThe initial batch has now sold out, leaving some on-line retailers without stock. I'm afraid it's just a matter of being patient as Virgin press up more.\n\nOne small detail which has confused me is the 'misprint' on the back of the box itself. It turns out, after being sent a copy, that Simlpe Minds is on the European copies only - looks like the designer asked to put the Copy Protection artwork on the back overstepped his/her brief.\n\nThe 'new' Seen The Lights DVD is now appearing in the shops. It's a single disc from the original double set, comprising of the Verona and Newcastle City Hall gigs. However, the original double set is still plentiful, now being offered at a lower price.... lower than this newly repackaged single disc from the set.\n\nA great review of Johnny And The Self Abusers has just turned up, which paints a vivid picture of those early gigs. Jim is described as \"too motionless\" and \"cool\" before he decided to dance on a table during Pogo Dancing. You'll find the review, first published in Pretty Vacant Fanzine here.\n\nThe Empires And Dance sections have now been added to Dream Giver Redux.\n\n\"The stock should be out there today, but some shops may have taken late delivery - I can't say unless I know exactly which shops people are having trouble with. We did experience extremely high orders for the box and all the initial stock has been allocated. We are currently re-manufacturing stock and will re-supply as soon as possible, however due to the very special nature of the box this is not as swift a process as would usually be the case...\n\nI am not aware of any manufacturing fault and I have just checked with out production department and neither are they.\n\n\" - Virgin Records\n\nI don't think it's a case of a manufacturing fault. Looks like they've already run out of copies.\n\nThe first copies of Silver Box were sent out on Friday throughout Germany. Some fans reported that the fifth CD, Our Secrets Are The Same, was missing from the set.\n\nCome Monday, and the CD has been released everywhere. Or has it? Whilst my local HMV had a couple of the box-sets on display, they'd both been opened, which was odd. Furthermore, some on-line retailers have not issued the box: \"Please note that this item has been temporarily withdrawn from sale(everywhere) due to a manufacturing fault. We have been informed by the record company that it will become available again in November, and we will ship this item to you as soon as it lands in our warehouse!\"\n\nI've so far listened to three of the discs and they haven't been mispressed. It's possible that the withdrawl is due to the 5th disc being missing in some of the sets (hence my local record store opening the packages to check them), but at the moment, the status of this long awaited release is uncertain.\n\nCongratulations Mark and Jen!\n\n\"I am so excited to announce my engagement to my extraordinary lady, Jennifer Kolchier! I asked Jen to marry me in the bubble bath on the gulf coast of Florida; she said yes!!! Life is glorious! \"\n\nMark Schulman\n\nThe following is the start of a track-by-track review of Silver Box. So, spoilers ahead! If you'd rather keep the surprises for October, then skip this section.\n\nSimple Minds: Silver Box Disc #3-#4 1985-1995\n\nLive In Rotterdam\n\nSilver Box: Waterfront/Ghostdancing/Book Of Brilliant Things/Once Upon A Time/All The Things She Said/Alive And Kicking/Sanctify Yourself.\n\nActual: Waterfront/Ghostdancing/Don't You (Forget About Me)Book Of Brilliant Things/Once Upon A Time/All The Things She Said/Alive And Kicking/Sanctify Yourself.\n\nBy the time of Once Upon A Time, Simple Minds was the eighth most bootlegged artist in the world, with the bootleggers having to press up triple albums to capture their entire concerts. From the Rotterdam gig, it's easy to hear why - this is the period of most excess with the songs going on forever. Having listened to the trimmed and lean Live In The City Of Light over the years, and with the band subsequently shortening their live numbers since the 1990s, it comes as quite a shock as to how excessive some of these songs were.\n\nThis gig will be familar to most as it was available as a TV show, broadcast across America (thanks to Westwood One) and bootlegged extensively. Don't You (Forget About Me) even appeared on the flip of All The Things She Said, probably why it's not included here.\n\nBarrowlands 1991\n\nSilver Box: Real Life/See The Lights/Travelling Man/East At Easter/Banging On The Door/Stand By Love/Oh Jungleland/King Is White And In The Crowd/Big Sleep/Let There Be Love/Ghostrider/Belfast Child\n\nActual: Real Life/Love Song/See The Lights/Travelling Man/East At Easter/Banging On The Door/Book Of Brilliant Things/Stand By Love/Oh Jungleland/Someone Somewhere (In Summertime)/King Is White And In The Crowd/Big Sleep/Sanctify Yourself/Let There Be Love/Alive And Kicking/Waterfront/Ghostrider/Belfast Child\n\nOver the years, I've been drowned in Real Life live tracks. From the B-sides of Stand By Love, Real Life and Love Song/Alive And Kicking, from the US radio broadcasts, from the UK radio broadcasts, from the fan club limited CDs, from the TV broadcast, and from the endless bootlegs, Real Life is the most over exposed of Simple Minds live output. Having an almost entire show here, some of which I've already got, is too much. I've listened to it once and then put it back in its sleeve. The only saving grace is that you get the full unedited broadcast, complete with Billy Sloan introduction, but it's not enough to interest me.\n\nRoyal Concert Hall 1995\n\nSilver Box: She's A River/Up On The Catwalk/Hypnotised\n\nActual: She's A River/Up On The Catwalk/See The Lights/The American/Big Sleep/Great Leap Forward/Someone Somewhere (In Summertime)/Hypnotised/Let There Be Love/Belfast Child/Roadhouse Blues-Waterfront/Love Song/Alive And Kicking/And The Band Played On/Don't You (Forget About Me)/Sancitfy Yourself.\n\nIt's interesting as to how bad the sound is here. Jim can heardly be heard through the mix, thus making the last three tracks of disc #4 somewhat of a disappointment. At least Good News From The Next World was represented in part (although why the US live recordings weren't selected is somewhat of a mystery); Neapolis (and everything since) has been ignored. A pity.\n\nSimple Minds: Silver Box Disc #5 1999: Our Secrets Are The Same\n\nFor those whove heard Our Secrets Are The Same as MP3s, as the badly recorded Internet mush from Jordi Tarda, then youre in for a treat. The crystal clear recording here is a revelation, and how the album was intended to be heard. With the exception of Space, Secrets sparkles with subtle instrumentation and effects. For example, Death By Chocolate sounds like a completely different song.\n\nHowever, for those whove got the original leaked unmastered CDs, then the changes are far less dramatic. Charlies work in the early months of 2003 consisted of remixing the songs, bringing the keyboards further up in the mix, and leaving the guitars behind. Do I hear extra new vocal layering on Swimming To The Sun? Is there extra percussion on Happy Is The Man?\n\nHello has changed the most, even gaining a new intro, Jims voice clarified and extra strings added. However, Space still sounds like its been sung in a closet, an incredibly claustrophobic treatment, which stands out amongst the other tracks on the album.\n\nThere's another Simple Minds release on the 18th October. Seen The Lights: Live In Verona will be the second official DVD issued by Virgin. However, it's probably just one of the discs from Seen The Lights packaged separately - nothing to get too excited about.\n\nsample MINDS, a Simple Minds tribute band, now have their own website, which can be found at www.sampleminds.co.uk. Here you'll find audio and video downloads, their discography, and all the latest news: for instance, their next gig is in Crewe on the 3rd Novemeber at the Limelight Club. Check them out: highly recommended.\n\nI've finally got around to adding the Australian CD of White Spaces Featuring Jim Kerr to the discography. Whilst it looked like a new collection of all the various Don't You remixes, the Perky Park remix is slightly different, with the addition of crowd noise over the end of the track. One for the completists but they'll probably already have it!\n\nThe Real To Real Cacophony sections are now on Dream Giver Redux. This includes updates to the news, discography, songs, people, timeline, tours, press releases, reviews and other sections.\n\nWant to win a copy of Silver Box? RememberTheEighties.com have five copies to give away in their easy competition (click on 'news' and follow the link).\n\nThis months Record Collector featured a review of the box set, and a quick Q&A session with Jim:SIMPLE MINDS BOX\n\nIt's a rare, nigh-on impossible opportunity to be confronted with such a vast collection. Rarer still is the fact that it all matters and that each song, whether it's Life In A Day in 1979 or Sleeping in 1999, has been chosen for a specific reason: chronicling where Jim Kerr, Charlie Burchill, Michael MeNeil, Mel Gaynor and the rest of the rotational nucleus that made up Glasgow's most successful band to date have been and, possibly, where they choose to go from here. The last 12 years have seen the Simple Minds back catalogue - well, mainly the hits as opposed to the obscurities - collected together to form ubiquitous showcases of their story: Glittering Prize 81/92, The Best Of Simple Minds and Early Gold, but nothing of the magnitude of Silver Box has been attempted.\n\nEach CD acts as a chapter, skilfully documenting the early, early days, bar Johnny And The Self Abusers, the swift evolution into an enigma way more pivotal than just New Romanticism, the rise to global stardom and stadiums and how Simple Minds managed to sustain the magic and energy before deciding to go it alone and, in many ways, returning to square one where it all began: songwriting culled from the fruits of Jim and Charlie's lifelong friendship. Capturing the band at their earliest critical point between 1979 and 1980, CD 1 shows the transition from avant-garde to John Peel Sessions and John Leckie-produced demos with tracks like Premonition, Changeling, I Travel, Twist/Run/Repulsion and Constantinople Line, to a pan-European sounding group with definition and their own agenda.\n\nThe next disc follows on with raw, radically unpolished demos, courtesy of Steve Hillage, that take in old favourites: The American, Life In Oils, Sweat In Bullet and Love Song while select out-takes from David Jensen sessions in '82 and '83 spawn unedited performances of In Trance As Mission, Someone Somewhere (In Summertime), Hunter And The Hunted and The Kick Inside Of Me. Bridging the gap between the New Gold Dream and Sparkle In The Rain period, a 12-minute live version of the former, complete with Bono at the Glasgow Barrowlands in '85 makes way for a Live Aid rehearsal of Don't You (Forget About Me) where Kerr actually forgets the words at certain points.\n\nThe two discs that follow are primarily made up live recordings: pre-Live In The City Of Light workings of Waterfront, Book Of Brilliant Things, Once Upon A Time and Alive And Kicking at the Ahoy in Rotterdam precede the euphoric crowd roars before Mandela Day live at the first Wembley Stadium event in 1988. Twelve songs from the 1991 Real Life homecoming bash back at Barrowlands cover anything from See The Lights and East At Easter to Oh Jungleland, Big Sleep and Belfast Child before the fifth final platter is represented by the mature, roots-return album Our Secrets Are The Same from 1999 that was never given an official release due to legal wrangles.\n\nAnd that, for the time being, is where the story of Simple Minds' influential musical history signs off. So, until they dust off the rest of their old archives that are yet to be found, sit back and bask in the glory of a band whose new gold dream actually made a difference and, in many ways, still does.\n\nQ&A with Jim Kerr\n\nDid it take a long time to whittle down the final track listing?\n\nA guy called , who was the drummer in a Glasgow band called The Silencers - he's a best mate and has basically grown up around Simple Minds. If it had come down to us, we'd have ended up arguing, so we used Martin because he could bring an outside perspective to it. Martin pulled it together really well.\n\nThe recordings at Barrowlands seem to hold great significance...\n\nBarrowlands has always been a special place to us; my mum and dad even met each other in there! Even big American bands would know about it. It's the place and it's such a pit (laughs)! I think that there's always a moment in a band's career when they're on the cusp and it can go either way, and once they've played that venue it seems to either go through the roof from then on or it just pans out, so I guess some bands use the place as a kind of rocket-launch, if you like; an acid test. That night when we had Bono join us on stage was definitely one of them.\n\nThe atmosphere must have been wild.\n\nThe thing is, I was still in shock that night because Bono and Ali, his wife, had stayed over at my mum's house for a few days and he'd just bought himself a really dodgy new old-car that he thought was cool, so he insisted on driving us to the gig in it. I don't think he knew what he was doing as he drove through the middle of Glasgow. This was while he was completely sober (laughs)! I don't think I'd quite gathered my senses even by the time I went on stage. It was a very over-the-top night, put it that way (laughs). A great night.\n\nWhere next?\n\nWe're always thinking about the next song, the next gig and to the future, but the fact is that if you don't clear out the vaults at some point the tracks will end up online on the Internet anyway: someone will always know someone else who'll have that rare version or that dodgy mix that was never released, and suddenly it's out there for people to download, so you might as well get it mastered and sounding good, with some decent artwork on it and put it out legitimately. It's more a case of us wanting to tidy things up.\n\nSwax M. Thomas\n\nRecord Collector\n\nNovember 2004\n\nAdam Sweeting (originally the band's biographer) reviewed Silver Box in The Guardian this Friday. Giving the set four out of five, the review can be found on the Guardian's website and is reproduced below:\n\nIf you chucked out most of discs three and four from this beefy five-disc box, you'd be left with some fascinating insights and lost nuggets from the past and near-present of Simple Minds. Over a 25-year career, the band have gone from eclectic experimentalism through clapalong mega-pomp and back to something in between, and that trajectory is captured here.\n\nThis collection consists entirely of unreleased material, with demos and radio sessions covering the Minds' earlier years; previously unreleased live recordings documenting the shouty, lumbering 1980s-to-1990s; and a complete unreleased album, Our Secrets Are the Same, on the fifth disc. The album, dating from 1999, was scuppered by legal wranglings, but it's some of the best music the band have made in 20 years. Tracks such as Death By Chocolate or Happy Is The Man recall something of their old pioneering spirit, and show a fascination with the process of recording rather than with prancing about in front of a sea of cigarette lighters.\n\nAnyone interested in the band's history will be gripped by the first two discs. There are 1979 live recordings of their earliest songs, such as Life In A Day and Chelsea Girl, which display precocious focus and imagination. And there's an excellent batch of demos from the Empires And Dance sessions, produced by John Leckie and mostly very close to the finished versions. From 1981, there are demos of songs from Sons and Fascination, including the long-lost Life In Oils, and powerful performances of tracks from New Gold Dream recorded for David Jensen's Radio 1 show.\n\nYou can hear the wheels starting to come off during a horrific 1985 live recording of New Gold Dream from Barrowlands in Glasgow, which goes on for hours and features synchronised bellowing from Bono and Jim Kerr. And the rest of the mid-80s live material is dismally overblown and over-long. But maybe they're on the brink of a critic-defying comeback.\n\nAdam Sweeting\n\nThe Guardian\n\n1st October 2004\n\nThe Open University are using Usura's Open Your Mind as backing music for adverts on BBC 1. Good to hear New Gold Dream on the BBC again.\n\nThe following is the start of a track-by-track review of Silver Box. So, spoilers ahead! If you'd rather keep the surprises for October, then stop reading now.\n\n\"Welcome to the Simply Mindless website. This site was created in July 2004 by Steve Robinson and Lawrie Lowe. The idea behind this site is to encourage and motivate ourselves and others to compete in a range of events, to get ourselves fit and healthy whilst raising sponsorship for charities.\"\n\nTwo Simple Minds fans getting fit and healthy, and bravely reporting their progress on their website. All sponsorship goes to charity. So take a look at www.simplymindless.com and give them your support.\n\nThere was recently a storm-in-a-teacup about the new studio album, originating from a fan's conversation with Jim, and the subsequent write-up (and removal) of the chat on a website. Whilst the website stated that Jim mentioned the new album being released next year, everyone started talking about 2006.\n\n\"Next year\" is 2005 as far as I'm concerned.\n\nMel's been busy recently. After finishing his live work with Simple Minds, he's been teaching at various drum clincs around Europe. He confirmed that his single (Addicted To Love) will be released in France soon, his solo album will be out next year (that's 2005), and he's working with two Danish DJs on a remix/house track.\n\nU2's new single Vertigo features a cover of Kraftwerk's Neon Lights. This will be the second time both Simple Minds and U2 have covered the same song, the first being Dancing Barefoot.\n\nVertigo is released on three formats on November 8th. Neon Lights appears on CD #2.\n\nDespite being released now, U2's version was recorded around June 2001 for an unrealised Kraftwerk tribute album. So it appears that both bands were working on the same track around the same time.\n\nThe following is the start of a track-by-track review of Silver Box. So, spoilers ahead! If you'd rather keep the surprises for October, then stop reading now.\n\nSeen The Lights is going to be reissued as two separate DVDS. Seen The Lights - Live will feature the live material from the set and is set for release on the 18th October. Seen The Lights - The Videos won't appear until the 31st January 2005. It isn't known if the videos will include the 'missing' videos from the original set.\n\nThe Live Aid DVD listing previously published here was incorrect. Simple Minds are now represented by Don't You (Forget About Me) and Ghostdancing.\n\nSee here for more information and a breakdown of each disc.\n\nDream Ticket, a BBC 6 show, will be featuring a Simple Minds album as part of the show on the 30th August. Those who can't hear the show, but have broadband, can wait and listen to the show via the Listen Again option.\n\nNME have reviewed Silver Box. It's shocking.\n\nIt's box-set of the week!\n\nThe early stuff is really great. Honestly, it's really great!!\n\nThey like Our Secrets Are The Same!!!\n\n(Of course, the stadium years are still rubbish - but you can't have everything).\n\nSo, good on the NME\n\nFurther excitment occured when a New Gold Dream 2-CD set appeared in the various retail store listings, set for release in September. However, it all turned to complete boredom and disinterest when it was realized that it's simply a repackaging, of the repackaging, of the New Gold Dream/Sparkle In The Rain double pack that no-one wanted in the first place.\n\nSome more details about Silver Box:\n\nFull listings of the 5-CD promo set are now published.\n\nThe promos include the usual errors on their sleeves. Hopefully this isn't a premonition (ha!) of the booklet. For example, the two demo sets of Empires And Dance and Sons And Fascination were not produced by John Leckie or Steve Hillage (because, they were brought in to polish them up for the albums, which is what producers do.) The Sons demos, including the oft-bootlegged Life In Oils, were produced by Mick MacNeil, a credit which should be recognised, and incidentally was confirmed by Bruce Findlay on the mailing list this week.\n\nThe version of New Gold Dream (81,82,83,84) from Barrowlands featuring Bono clocks in at 12:32. Therefore it's the full version of the song and not an edit.\n\nClive Johnson has picked up the promos, listened, and written the review below.\n\nSimple Minds are a unique odyssey. They have had line-up changes galore, sell-out albums and tours, and, all of this is evident in Silver Box a 5-CD anthology stapling the band's career together in the shape of unreleased demos, sessions, and studio out-takes. From disc 1, Mick Macneil's keyboards are underpinned by Charlies guitar on the live versions of Life In A Day and Chelsea Girl. This introduction is signed off with a flourish by a very timid version of Here Comes The Fool. A young but enthusiastic Kerr sings very nervously on stage, but progresses. The Iggy Pop/Bowie (the band took their name from a Bowie song The Jean Genie) influence can clearly be heard, and lurid scenes of Bowie and Lou Reed starting a fight at an Arista publicity bash can somehow be visualised, as Kerr salutes each song with valour. Disc 1 comes complete with several genres, from New Romantic to the Avant-Garde, and with Jims lyrics differing from the album version, on I Travel, with  Europe, Europe Interpol make love to the criminal, then yes, it's welcomed!\n\nMick Macneil, Simple Minds ex-keyboard player was responsible for producing the unreleased Sons And Fascination demos and, although heavily bootlegged, these, and other out-takes, remained unreleased officially. Fortunately, Virgin have got things right. The ever mystifying Life In Oils was a leftover from the Sons And Fascination album and Kerr, who once declared himself as a cynic, perhaps decided the album was better than the song.\" Fast-forwarding to the haunting version of Love Song, the listener can clearly hear elements of Room the Empires And Dance track that is featured on Disc 1.\n\nAmidst the quantum leap from the New Romantic past of disc 1 and 2, we hit big time. Introduce Waterfront from the well-publicised Alive In Rotterdam concert at the Ahoy Arena on 3rd December 1985, and you miss the visuals that the song produces, and you are trapped inside a musical bubble that you want to see and not only hear. Ghostdancing and the remarkably pacy Book Of Brilliant Things are visually impaired for the listener here.\n\nThe remarkable inclusion of 12 tracks from a show at the Glasgow Barrowlands during the bands Real Life tour in 1991 is very much an overkill of what has been released before. This said, for the fan, any Simple Minds release is an interesting one and they will listen.\n\nDisc 5 is the opus. The lost album Our Secrets Are The Same has, at last, after much bootlegging, and legal disputes, reached officialdom. Recorded in 1999, and produced by Charlie Burchill and Kevin Hunter, we are hearing new reinvented Simple Minds. A new young bassist appeared in 1999 in the shape of Eddie Duffy, who joined Charlie On keyboards for this final CD of the set. The respectful sounding Death By Chocolate is also a rhythmic ode to Yukio Mishima, a Japanese author who committed seppuku (ritual disembowelment) in 1970. The song focuses on one of his books, The Sailor Who Fell From Grace To The Sea, a sharp and clear influence on Kerr, who whilst writing this album, almost lost interest in the band completely. Fortunately we have this box set to prove otherwise. Kerr is joined by a falsetto voice on Happy Is The Man which does the track justice, and like all the tracks on this CD, Charlie is the anchor man here. With invention and innovativeness pouring out of him, especially on the bouncy track number 8, Hello, through to the acoustic on Happy Is The Man.\n\nFrom the curious newcomer, right through to the die-hard fan, this box set is a must for all tastes. Buy, and enjoy!\n\nClive Johnson\n\nThe Ahoy gig was filmed, the first broadcast appearing on The Tube in January 1986. The concert internally publicized by Virgin Vision (an A4 information sheet is shown right) and it also turned up on various late-night graveyard shift TV shows. It has never been commercially released.\n\nSome of the songs ended up as B-side filler for the Once Upon A Time releases. Love Song, Street Hassle and the ever-lasting Don't You (Forget About Me) were all taken from the Ahoy tapes and produced by Pete Walsh.\n\nDespite the commercial unavailability of these tracks, there was a semi-legitimate source. Westwood One broadcast the gig twice, and the transcription discs became highly source after items (as the Superstar Concert Series: one set with Tears For Fears and the other with The Fixx.)\n\nBy the 1990s, the CD bootleggers finally got in on the act, and spawned several illegal recordings of the show (such as Westwood One, Ghostdancing, Alive And Kicking and the imaginatively titled Don't You (Forget About Me).\n\nSilver Box is now available for preorder on a couple of on-line retail shops. It seems to be priced around £30, which is very reasonable for a five CD box-set. Copies can be purchased from www.101cd.com.\n\nCollectors can also look out for the 10 track CD sampler of Silver Box which has started circulating. More copies of the 5 CD promos set have also surfaced.\n\nThe Live Aid DVD will not feature the entire concert, as each artist is represented by one or two tracks (and Led Zeppelin have withdrawn permission for their set). The Simple Minds segment includes Promised You A Miracle and Don't You (Forget About Me); Ghostdancing has been dropped.\n\nFor more information, click here.\n\nThis DVD is set for release on the 1st November.\n\nSaMPLE MINDS played a brief set at drummer Thorsten's wedding on the 7th August, consisting of This Is Your Land and the Live In The City Of Light version of New Gold Dream (81,82,83,84).\n\nThe band might support Then Jerico - but nothing remains confirmed. However, they will be playing in England in November. More news about that will be found on the band's website www.sampleminds.co.uk when it goes live later this month.\n\nAnd it gets more complicated. Completists have another promo of Dirty Old Town to seach out; and this was the one send to radio stations and the press, so it should be more common.\n\nThe Dirty Old Town promo is an odd beast, as it features Shane MacGowan's Road To Paradise as the title track, and not the Simple Minds/Jimmy Johnstone duet.\n\nMore information about the promo can be found here.\n\nBand keeps it simple - and superb\n\nSimple Minds frontman Jim Kerr is a man of few words on the stage.\n\nRepartee with the crowd has never really been his thing. But on Saturday night he had one thing to say - over and over again - \"We love you Liverpool\".\n\nAnd judging by the audence's reaction during this barnstorming, 1980s-inspired gig, Liverpool loves him.\n\nPromising to \"destroy this place tonight\", Simple Minds launched into a nostalgia tinged set that had the big tent rocking from first song to last.\n\nThis was what concerts should be - the band were on top form belting out classic hits from their back catalogue leaving the crowd to do nothing else but enjoy themselves and indulge in some communal handclapping and singalongs.\n\nNo set changes, only one change of shirt for a sweat-drenched Kerr, and a glitch free set meant that all that mattered was the music, and Glasgow's finest did not disappoint on that score.\n\nSimple Minds were hailed by many as the best performers at last year's Summer Pops - when they appeared in Liverpool for the first time in 20 years - and those lucky enough to have a ticket for Saturday's gig will have walked away thinking exactly the same thing.\n\nTaking some time out during a European tour to record their lastest album, due for release this autumn [next year - Simon], the show was a deft mix of classics and future releases.\n\nThe show rattled along at a frightening pace with no let up for the band or the audience. Kerr defied both age and human physiology with a display of hip swirling stage gyrating that left him, and everyone else, gasping for breath at times.\n\nBut the highlight of the almost two-hour long show was the encore. Simple Minds had undoubtedly saved the best until last.\n\nWaterfront, Someone Somewhere (In Summertime), Alive And Kicking and Sanctify Yourself brought the set to a shuddering crescendo and left the crowd screaming for more.\n\nAnd, for the record, the big top was left standing - but only just.\n\nTony Barrett\n\nDaily Post\n\n26th July\n\nAmazingly the promos for Silver Box have already started circulating - 11 weeks before release! This set was snapped up on eBay on the 1st August.\n\nThere's also a collectable CDR promo of the The Bhoys From Paradise single. Oddly Shane MacGowan's Road To Paradise is the title track, being followed by Dirty Old Town and Lord Of The Wing. It's the usual record company clobber: CDR in ink-jet printed sleeve.\n\nThe Live Aid concert is due for release at the end of this year. It isn't known if Simple Minds segment, which was marred by some technical problems, will be included in its full form. For more information, check here.\n\nStill reeling from the disappointment that Farenheit 9-11 doesn't feature one nano-second of Simple Minds, cinema goers will be releaved that Along Came Polly features everyone's favourite 80s movie theme, namely Don't You (Forget About Me).\n\nIn fact, don't take my word for it. Check out the imdb.com's latest poll: When I think \"80s movie song,\" the first song that comes to mind is.....\n\nWell, it polled three times more than Take My Breath Away, and trampled Footloose into third: Don't You (Forget About Me) from The Breakfast Club is the 80s theme song. See the poll here.\n\nSilver Box, the long awaited box-set from Simple Minds, will be released on 18th October. The track listing was published here on the 25th May and here's the press release:\n\nVIRGIN RECORDS\n\nSIMPLE MINDS\n\n'Silver Box'\n\n5 CD Box Set\n\n18th October 2004\n\nIn their 25 year career, there are few things Simple Minds have not done. They have sold tens of millions of albums, filled stadiums all over the world, received critical adulation and achieved extraordinary success. At their peak they were arguably the biggest band in the world and to this day they are still touring, writing and recording new material. However it is long overdue for the band to receive the retrospective Box Set treatment, and this 5 CD set, comprised of demo, live, studio and session material collects what Simple Minds are all about, remarkably containing not one previously released track.*\n\nDiscs 1 & 2 focus on early session and demo material and highlight just how experimental the early Minds were. Far from the stadium stomp that symbolised the band's middle period, much of the band's early work had an edge which set them apart from most other post punk wannabes. Here BBC session recordings and live versions of classic singles like Chelsea Girl and Life In A Day capture the energy of the band at that stage in their career.\n\nDiscs 3 & 4 are comprised of live material from a series of triumphant gigs between 1985 and 1995. Arguably when the band were at their peak, classic tracks such as Waterfront, Alive & Kicking and Sanctify Yourself are delivered with such gusto that it is hard not to have your breath taken away by Jim Kerr's vocal and the chiming power of Charlie Burchill's guitar work.\n\nDisc 5 contains the \"lost\" album Our Secrets Are The Same. Recorded in 1999 the album was stuck at the bottom of a legal dispute, but finally it is to be available to the fans as part of this Box Set. The Box Set's sleeve notes will contain a commentary written by Jim Kerr on the tracks on Our Secrets Are The Same.\n\nAll tracks on this set are previously unreleased*. For more detail on specific tracks please see tracklisting.\n\nPackaged in a long box, the 76 page booklet contains many previously unseen photos from record company and band member archives. Also included is a companion essay to the music written by Simple Minds expert Alfred Bos which includes new interview material from band members and some of the amazing producers that have worked with the band. There is also a commentary to Our Secrets Are The Same, written by Jim Kerr.\n\n* Despite the press release claiming that all the tracks were exclusive, Stand By Love, Banging On The Door, See The Lights, Belfast Child and Ghostrider had been previously released as the B-sides of Stand By Love and Real Life. Additional tracks also appeared on the fan-club only Real Live 91 release.\n\nI've finally got around to uploading the details about the Dirty Old Town single, which was released under the name of The Bhoys From Paradise.\n\nI've updated the 2004 tour page, which was quite easy as the set-list hasn't changed at all. Jim did mention that the songs might change at Liverpool, but it was not to be - however reports filtering back from Liverpool definitely state that the band did not disappoint, and it was the highlight of the tour so far for many.\n\nI was at Charlecote Park (many thanks to Jamie) so I'll write up something about the evening in the next couple of days.\n\nFull information about the 'missed' bootleg remix of Don't You (Forget About Me) by The Deadly Ones vs Simple Minds has now been added to the discography.\n\nIt starts out sounding like a hard-house mix (too much bass with everything resonating about the room) but settles down into a rather pleasing old-skool classic mix. As far as I'm concerned, it's well worth tracking down. It is rather rare now, being released in November 2003 as a single sided white, but www.dancerecords.com had some copies recently.\n\nSparkle Three Day Party Weekend\n\nThe Belgian fanclub, Sparkle Through The Years, are holding their three day Simple Minds party this weekend. For more information, click the flyer. Why not attend? It sounds well groovy.\n\nShaun Edwards has updated his Crashing Beats And Fantasy website. Well, he's actually deleted the whole thing and completely designed it. Check out one of the most comprehensive Simple Minds websites to appear since this one.\n\nWhilst I promoted ATE 1 vs Simple Minds on this website a couple of months ago, we all missed their first release: Don't You by The Deadly Ones vs. Simple Minds which was originally issued at the end of last year. (11th November 2003 to be exact).\n\nIt's a great remix, building up slowly, and keeping the song's structure and style.\n\nwww.dancerecords.com have recently got a couple of copies back in stock if you're interested.\n\nBig Beauty by Simple Minds vs Underworld is the latest in a series of white-label, probably bootleg, remixes to hit the specialist DJ shops. This time New Gold Dream (81,82,83,84) is the subject of a cut-and-paste mix with additional drums and effects. Whether this turns up later as a legit release remains to be seen, but it should be of interest to dance fans.\n\nYou can purchase it, or just listen to a sample, at www.dancerecords.com.\n\nAbsolutely have issued a single-sided 10\" single which features the new Danny McMillian remix of Don't You (Forget About Me). It's very sparce new mix which will appeal to hardcore and completists.\n\nJim was interviewed by Todd at 18:05 (GMT) during Some Sweet Day 2004. The main points were:\n\nThe box set, called Silver Box, will be issued sooner rather than later. Alfred Bos is writing the booklet notes, whilst Marlin Hanlin has been in Glasgow taking pictures and tracking down memorabilia.\n\nDue to their record company contracts, anything recorded live and released by the band would be subject to a re-recording clause. However, the contract expires at the end of 2004, leaving the band free to release what they want. This has been the reason for the lack of a live CD/DVD in the past.\n\nDespite some interest in his journal writing, Jim has no plans to become a writer or publish his essays in a book.\n\nThey're going to take their time with the new album, which will probably be released in 2005. Jim mentioned needing a landmark album, and since they'd released so much in the last couple of years, then a new studio album could wait a while yet.\n\nJim said that the band were at the mercy of the promoters as to where they play. Australia was mentioned again as a possibility.\n\nThe new album will not be released on Eagle. (Simple Minds left the label late last year).\n\nMore new songs are expected to be unveiled during this tour: Premonition, Glitterball and a new version of Life In A Day.\n\nMany thanks to Todd and Aaron for a superb show as always.\n\nHere's a rough transcription:\n\nJK: Is this the fourth or the fifth Some Sweet Day?\n\nTR: It's been around - kind of like your band! So much has gone on. And the box set has finally come to fruitition?\n\nJK: It's truly immenent.\n\nTR: What was your participation?\n\nJK: Virgin, who own the stuff, come to us occasionally; for a greatest hits, or a new compilation (such as Early Gold) and finally this rarities box set: Sessions, outtakes, live things - and the cherry on the cake is that it will feature Our Secrets Are The Same, recorded five years ago.\n\nJK: Our fans are so on the case, that little counts as a genuine rarity. But for the masses, this is all new stuff in a really nice package. Martin Hanlin, who was in The Silencers, has been trawling through Glasgow looking for pictures and memorabilia for the box set, which is called Silver Box. I don't recall the actual release date.\n\nTR: When Silver Box was announced, people thought it was something different from A History.\n\nJK: A History? That title's too boring. And with that title it would be expected to be chronological.\n\nTR: Any possibilities of a new live DVD from Simple Minds in 2004?\n\nJK: The delay is due that when you sign a record deal, there's a restriction on re-recording songs (which is what a live song is). From the end of this year, anything we record live, we can just go ahead and just release it. We can do unplugs. Orchestral versions. Banjo versions. [Laughs] We've held out on doing that. There was going to be a DVD in 2002, but the record company negotiations dragged us down.\n\nJK: Plus there will be the possibility of downloading material from a website. But, in our hearts, is the desire to move forward.\n\nTR: There's been talk of you becoming an author. You should compile your journal entries.\n\nJK: I've never looked at myself as a writer - I'm a song-writer, I like writing songs. When the idea of the website came along, I felt I should communicate the forefront of my thinking on a particular day. It's gone down well. Would I have a story to tell? I probably would. I do enjoy the writing - doing it freely is one thing, having a publisher and having to come up with juicy material - I wouldn't like that. I hope the journal gives that little bit more (but I've been skipping it recently - I will be more regular - and that's a threat!).\n\nTR: Still a new year release for the new album?\n\nJK: It won't be this year. We need a landmark album, something that's really, really good. Just to put out an album for the sake of it is one thing - but we're hanging in there. I can feel the frustration but it'll be done when it's done. We've done the covers album, studio album, Early Gold, remasters, Silver Box, greatest hits - we've toured non-stop, and we've been writing and recording - it's not the case that we're doing nothing.\n\nTR: Writing during the week and playing at the weekends?\n\nJK: Some nights I've felt the band are playing better than ever. And that comes from the continuation. So we're reluctant to disappear into the studio and not play. And we can bring some of that live energy to the record. But the point you've made is the intention.\n\nTR: Mel hurt his hand, but he's OK?\n\nJK: Last week he thought he had a fracture or an actual break. He got X-Rayed and it wasn't as bad as the doctor thought. But I could feel a couple of nights that it was affecting him. But he's over it.\n\nTR: Is there a possibility of touring the USA?\n\nJK: I hadn't been expecting that question! Unfortunately the band doesn't have a large say in it - we can't tour without promoters. They're only going to invite us to play if they get a return. But there is interest there, from a record company I like, who want to take on the next record. We do get asked to do one-off things - something in LA for K-ROCK for example. But we don't want to slip off and do one gig. But you need to be invitied - we need the promoters. For instance, there is interest in Australia as the classic stations still play us. We almost play where we're asked - but if we're not getting the calls, then we can't really initiate it.\n\nTR: The set-list this year has featured some old songs.\n\nJK: It's funny how songs reappear in the set-list and suddenly start working again. And the festivals are short sets, so it's a standard thing. I like to think about the hard-core fans, and I think we've played between 50 and 60 different songs - and then there's the 10 or dozen we always play, but we have been chopping and changing them. Some of them, like Street Fighting Years, have a heavy atmosphere - you need darkness, lights and the production - it becomes more enhanced. At a festival, it's different.\n\nTR: Any other songs to bring back?\n\nJK: We've done five or six at rehearsals we haven't played yet: Glitterball, for one. We keep revisting them. we have a new version of Life In A Day. We have a gig in Liverpool which has become our own gig - we could do some of them then.\n\nJK: We play tomorrow in Norwich in East Anglia. Probably the last time we played there was a university gig. It's a big gig - we need to be blessed with some good weather! When we played Palermo, the heavens opened during the soundcheck - it never rains in Sicily unless we play!\n\nTR: I have a copy of Live And Rare here, which is live material and new studo material. Was White Light/White Heat a recent recording?\n\nJK: It was recent. Autumn last year - Charlie and Gordon Goudie producing. I think it's a really exciting version.\n\nTR: Dirty Old Town has done well for the charity.\n\nJK: They were all done in autumn last year.\n\nTR: I like the new version of Don't You (Forget About Me). It's stripped down and takes on new character. It's a mature version of the song.\n\nJK: There are so many different versions of that. But a good pop song's a good pop song. I like the drive of it. It wasn't something I was wildly enthusiastic about it, but when I heard it on the radio in Italy, it sounded really good.\n\nMusic: Don't You (Forget About Me)\n\nTR: Can you explain the collaboration with Phunk Investigation?\n\nJK: They get enthusiastic about something and they ask and we give them a few things. It's better to give people their shout and space when it's not your genre.\n\nTR: Simple Minds are getting new life with new mixes and releases. It's similar to how your songs change live. They heard songs on Live In The City Of Light and had no idea that they were alternate to how they were originally recorded.\n\nJK: Alfred Bos, a Dutch journalist in Amsterdam, he's doing the sleeve notes for Silver Box; he thinks there's a tendency for Simple Minds to get written out of the rock history, but I tend to agree with him. But when you hear, and see, and notice the amount of remixes, and as the music gets passed down through the generations, you can see that Simple Minds have influenced a lot of people. And long may it continue!\n\nTR: Exciting hearing about old songs being demoed for new sets. Is discovering new songs in the old part of songwriting?\n\nJK: Yes. We were in Spain at the soundcheck - the guys were playing a version of Sweat In Bullet. And Charlie started a new line in a chorus - which sounds like the seed of a new song. I wanted to stop him then! Sometimes you get these echoes, or branches, that grow out of an atmosphere of a song. There's a part of Great Leap Forward that recalls Wall Of Love - you feel this refrain coming through. When you're writing songs you're rarely concious of it.\n\nTR: Is Premonition a possibility in the set?\n\nJK: Some songs feel their age, some feel timeless. Premonition has a great bass line - it's a mood and a dynamic. And it feels relevant. Some of the songs feel like an old jacket that doesn't fit anymore, but other songs don't need dusting down, and they work.\n\nTR: My favourite part of Seen The Lights is the old TV footage\n\nJK: I never watch the videos - it's just too weird watching yourself. You watch them to approve them and I find it difficult to watch myself. And I thought \"God, look at those hairstyles\" and I looked in the mirror and the hairstyle I have now is equally ridiculous. Life goes on!\n\nTR: It's been a great joy speaking with you and catching up on Simple Minds. It's a pleasure and an honour. Anything to leave the fans with?\n\nJK: The same thing. We might not be the most forecoming but we appreciate everyone who gets off on our music. And those who have the patience to hang in there when we don't visit them, have patience, we're not going to stop. Where there's a will there's a way. And for those who travel to see us everywhere - you're amazing. We've not worthy. The gigs wouldn't be the same.\n\nJim introduces Premonition and mentions that there's a good chance to hear it tomorrow night.\n\nThe set-list seems to have stabilised over the last couple of gigs, barely changing. Although the band have been soundchecking Premonition and Sweat In Bullet, neither have appeared at a concert yet.\n\nMel has injured his hand - he's still playing the gigs, but is skipping the soundchecks at the moment.\n\nFurther gigs may be planned for Spain: Probably Torremolinos in August and Madrid in October.\n\nIt's this Thursday! \"Aaron and I are gearing up for this year's show - landing THIS thursday the 15th - 7a-1a USA EST\n\nwww.wbwc.com (listen with real audio)\n\nwww.runninglate.org/marathons/sm.html (online flyer)\n\nWe have TONS of giveaways, thanks to the early ending of last year's show (you should hear the parody we have in this year's promo!) so keep the dialing fingers ready!\n\n\"- Todd\n\n440-826-STING\n\n440-826-2187\n\nrequest@wbwc.com\n\nI've been on holiday for the last couple of weeks. Hence the lack of updates. But enough of that. There's news to be told....\n\nBig Beauty by Simple Minds vs Underworld was issused as a white label at the end of June. It's a hardcore (well, very hardcore) remix of New Gold Dream. www.dancerecords.com have a few copies in stock if you're interested. My copy's on the way, so more information when it eventually turns up.\n\nThe charity record, Dirty Old Town, eventually reached 46 in the official UK singles chart. Not bad for a single that none of the English retailers decided to stock.\n\nA big fan of Simple Minds, Harry Prins died last week. He was only 35. His website, with pictures of him meeting Jim and Charlie can be found here. My condolences to his family and friends.\n\n(Incidentally I hadn't previously linked to Harry's site - for the simple reason that no-one told me about it. Please let me know if you have a Simple Minds site and I haven't linked to you).\n\nDespite being exclusive news on the official site, Farenheit 9-11 does not feature any music by Simple Minds.\n\nAnother Absolutely remix of Don't You (Forget About Me) has just surfaced. The Danny McMillian remix is far more hardcore than previous offerings. Again www.dancerecords.com have copies.\n\nDirty Old Town was finally released on the 21st June, but many shops in England have refused to stock it as it's considered 'just another football' record in a market saturated with football records.\n\nObviously the fact that it's a charity record in celebration of Jimmy Johnstone is clearly lost on them.\n\nThe Internet is your friend - buy it online from HMV.\n\nJam And Spoon released Tripomatic Fairytales 3003 on the 21st June. This includes Cynical Heart which featured Jim on vocals - the video can be viewed here.\n\nFor more information about Jam And Spoon then see their website.\n\nA collection of current tour images can be found on Paola's website.\n\nBBC Radio Wales will again be broadcasting the Kings Dock concert from last year. Tune in this Saturday at 18:30.\n\nThe release of Dirty Old Town has again been delayed and it won't be released until the 21st June. Whilst lengthy delays and set-backs seem to be the norm for Simple Minds' releases, it turns out that demand is so high that they're having to press more copies. There's talk of it reaching number one on pre-orders alone.\n\nAs the release of the box set gets nearer, all the details surrounding the recording and eventual shelving of Our Secrets Are The Same has been added to Dream Giver Redux. This includes new information that hasn't been previously added to the website.\n\nAnd, for the first time, details of the second aborted release has also been collected.\n\nPlus, all the history of the forthcoming box set has been collected and uploaded. Note that at the moment, I'm using Live In The City Of Light artwork to illustrate the pages - not a bad guess considering the style of Seen The Lights.\n\nAs mentioned on the 25th May, Simple Minds appear on a new live compilation DVD. It turns out that they are represented by Alive And Kicking from Verona.\n\nThe tour pages have now been updated with the latest set-lists.\n\nDream Giver Redux is clean now.\n\nDon't go anywhere near Dream Giver Redux for the time being. (www.simpleminds.org). My ISP has been hit by a virus, and all the index files now will attempt to redirect you to malicious sites. This site is on a different ISP and is clean.\n\nDirty Old Town's release date has been put back to the 14th June.\n\nThe set-list of the 'secret' gig has now been added to the tour page, where all the tour information is being compiled.\n\nEarly Gold has been given the Dream Giver Redux treatment.\n\nThe Moaning  but also happy - Review\n\nWhen I think I travelled 1,400 km in 2 days and I did not do what I wanted to Did not take my camera along, got to the place late, just at the end of The Stranglers set which I had not seen on stage for the last 13 years and I barely heard the last three songs . No comments!\n\nOne remark about the crowd at the gig : the audience was rather 40ish, older than, for instance, the Parisian or Geneva audience for Simple Minds in November. And there was a kind of hippy atmosphere throughout this festival, while all bands featured on that day were from the Eighties.. Maybe its normal as we were in the Netherlands.\n\nBut we were lucky enough to make it rather close to the stage, since many people left at the end of The Stranglers set. So two little Frogs crept in and found themselves surrounded by Level 42 fans\n\nDuring this boring set which lasted 1h20 mn my Naughtiness remained very silent waiting for the torture to be over Excellent musicians but not one inch of soul, or charisma. Mark King is a wonderful bass player but he does not know how to make contact with his audience And I never liked Level 42 too much twenty years ago so its not going to change now (stubborn girl, I know )\n\nFinally the end of this set came after the Encore (glurps!) and we patiently waited for the equipment to be installed on the stage. But the show did not start before 9.30 PM (instead of 9.15 PM) while the Naughty Presidents feet were beginning to be sore\n\nJust before Simple Minds came on stage, we got the news about Cannes and it made us quite happy!\n\nAt 9.35 finally, the boys arrive on stage but I got the awful feeling (so did my hubby) that Jim and Charlie were in a very bad mood smiling to the audience yes, but also dark eyes sending bad vibes Fortunately this disappeared rather quickly as the crowd gave the band a warm welcome.\n\nStarting with Book of Brilliant Things was great, but again it was a too short version OK I love the song too much .\n\nThen came War Babies. And I thought: This is going to please several people from the site attending the concert. However I found it a bit too smooth, but it was a good surprise.\n\nA bit of sleep for me on Spaceface and then some jumping and dancing on Up On The Catwalk (excellent version ), followed by Hypnotized and The American.\n\nOne of the jewels then came with New Sunshine Morning. This song is a great one and was amplified during this live performance. I even called poor Cecilia (who could not make it to the gig) to share with her this excellent version.\n\nDon't You (Forget About Me) came afterwards Where are my ear plugs???? I could just hear that Charlie had problems with his equipment which was quickly changed by the technicians, but the problem came back later. After this extended La la la version ( ), Belfast Child came. Very nice as usual.\n\nOur venerated Scottish gentlemen at this moment seemed to enjoy themselves on stage compared with the beginning of the show, and the Dutch audience was getting wilder.\n\nThen the surprise came with Great Leap Forward. A few seconds to recognize it, but sheer excitement among the crowd!\n\nGhostdancing was terrific as usual, we started singing Gloria a bit in advance and Jim decided to croon a bit. Where was the regular Light My Fire?\n\nThen everything gets more chaotic, the songs come out at the speed of light Shes A River, then New Gold Dream (81,82,83,84) (more jumping!!!) but the feared Bye-Bye is already there.\n\nA regular encore then followed : Someone Somewhere (In Summertime), Waterfront and the two usual American market ones come up : Alive And Kicking and Sanctify Yourself.\n\nCest déjà fini!!!! One hour and 45 minutes later the show is over And the organizers start playing music pretty loud : Roxane which is sung by the crowd as they leave the tent OK I will see Sting in Paris later this week (if he has recovered from laryngitis) but I did not want to practice so soon\n\nWhen leaving the site, we meet four British guys who want to rent bicycles (at 11.30 PM) to go back to the hotel . And we slowly go back to our nearby hotel in the darkness of the woods. But fortunately no Dutch wear wolf was hanging around in the night .\n\nJoelle Bonnet\n\nA collection of pictures from the Hellendoorn gig can be found on the festival's website. (Click on 'Fotos' and navigate through).\n\nTheme For Great Cities has been used on the soundtrack of Football Factory which is currently being shown across the UK:\n\n\"The Football Factory is more than just a study of the English obsession with football violence, its about men looking for armies to join, wars to fight and places to belong. A forgotten culture of Anglo Saxon males fed up with being told they're not good enough and using thier fists as a drug they describe as being more potent than sex and drugs put together. Shot in documentery style with the energy and vibrancy of handheld, The Football Factory is frightingly real yet full of painful humour as the four characters extreme thoughts and actions unfold before us.\"\n\nA History, the long awaited box-set, has been delayed until August/September. Unfortunately Virgin don't have any artwork at the moment. Or liner notes. Or, indeed, even the music. Bit of a problem then.\n\nSo A History currently remains, at the moment, a list of tracks.\n\nThe good news is that perhaps something could be done about the choices of material on discs #3 and #4?\n\nForget the news of VH1 filming the band during this tour (posted yesterday). There was some leg-pulling going on between fans, and the story got a little out of control.\n\nThe rumours that Simple Minds were going to tour Australia with Blondie were true. Talks were proceeding until last Friday, but any possible Simple Minds tour down-under have been postponed until next year.\n\nDischi vs Simple Minds, which is actually a cover of Endgames' Waiting For Another Chance, has now been added to the discography.\n\nTracklisting of the long awaited box-set:\n\nSimple Minds: A History.

The rest has all been bootlegged but it'll be good to get it mixed, mastered and released properly.\n\nThe compilers have also omitted material previously released. Hence the sessions of King Is White And In The Crowd and New Gold Dream (81,82,83,84) have not been included - they've already appeared. Nice touch. Likewise Don't You (Forget About Me) has been left off the Ahoy recording - if you want that, pick up the single of All The Things She Said.\n\nUnfortunately a whole glut of Real Life live material has appeared - most of which was previously released on the Stand By Love, Real Life and Love Song 1992 singles. In fact, most of this section also appeared on the fan-club only Real Live 91 CD. It's also one of the most bootlegged tours; so was it really necessary?\n\nInterestingly, none of the new tracks from Live And Rare made it to the box set; so that release has become more desirable. None of the 'remix' album tracks made it either (such as Easy, Precious, So Precious and Speed Your Love To Me). And it looks like the early years material, especially the second set of Life In A Day demos, remains in some form of legal limbo - so you'll still need to search for The Early Years 77-78.\n\nCD1 and CD2 are excellent, proceeding through the albums in an orderly fashion. The compilation gets lost in 1986, becoming an unwielding bulk of live tracks, most heavily bootlegged, skipping major sections. Where's the coverage of Street Fighting Years? Verona? Good News From The Next World would've been better served by the sessions played on Radio One in 1995. What about the Sunset Strip show? And the afterthought inclusion of the single version of War Babies feels like space filling.\n\nThen again, I'm a hardcore fan. Please me? Never.\n\nVH1 are following the band around for this tour. And following them to Australia. And Japan. Obviously some form of tour documentary is being put together, but nothing more is known at the moment.\n\nCover band SaMPLE MINDS are looking for a web-designer to put together a website. All the content has been prepared (including Steve's Journal) - they just need someone to make it look lovely and put it on this Interweb thing. E-mail Simon Hayward if you can help.\n\nSaMPLE MINDS may also be supporting Then Jerico on tour. So keep an eye out for that.\n\nOf course, the album which everyone is talking about, and is the current topic of every discussion, is erm... New Gold Dream (81,82,83,84). So think www.swagshop.com who are offering a rather tasty red T-shirt with the heart-and-rays design on the front with the album's title near the bottom. Far, far nicer than those Our Secret Are The Same T-shirts.\n\nJim gets interviewed on Dutch TV here. And they've received an excellent review in a Dutch newspaper - saviours of the festival apparently.\n\nPlus a new 80s DVD compilation of live material has appeared. Simple Minds are represented by Alive And Kicking but I've got no idea which performance it is.\n\nThe band have built on the collection of songs they played last year, adding several new songs from the 1990s. It's a welcome return to Great Leap Forward (which now features some lyrics from Wall Of Love) and War Babies. Cry is also represented with Spaceface and New Sunshine Morning.\n\nGood stuff!\n\n\"The concert started with \"Book Of Brilliant Things\", which was a pity because I always likeed Mel's drum solo in this song. Because it was the first song on stage, they weren't warmed up yet. The rest of the concert made up for it. Especially the ten minutes plus of \"Ghostdancing\" with \"Gloria\" in the middle; which was brilliant. I'd already heard it from the Liverpool concert, but to hear it live was better.\n\n\"New Gold Dream (81,82,83,84)\" sounded a bit different. It seemed there was a big drum computer playing along, therefore the song sounded more like a dance song (influence from White Spaces?). I kind of missed the oldies like \"I Travel\", \"Chelsea Girl\" and \"Love Song\" which I'd heared at my last concert in Ahoy (Rotterdam).\n\nOverall it was a great night and Jim and Charlie seemed to have a good time as well.\n\n\"\n\nGodfried Mensink\n\nSome pictures from the gig can now be found on the tour page.\n\nSoundcheck at Hellendoorn yesterday.\n\nAnd it's started. At the soundcheck at Hellendoorn, Simple Minds rehearsed Theme For Great Cities, Spaceface, The American, New Sunshine Morning, War Babies, Glitterball, Great Leap Forward, She's A River and New Gold Dream (81,82,83,84).\n\nSimple Minds return to the stage tomorrow, kicking off the 2004 festival tour in Hellendoorn. As usual, all set-lists, pictures, reviews and other bits-and-pieces will be gratefully received and published on the tour page. Send them in!\n\nIncidentally on the eve of the new tour, I thought it would be appropiate to update the Johnny And The Self Abusers tour pages with a review I've just discovered.\n\nAs mentioned here on the 11th February, Don't You (Forget About Me) by White Spaces featuring Jim Kerr has been released in Australia. Sporting a new sleeve, and including the first commercial release of the Stefano Sorrentio remix, the CD can be picked up from www.sanity.com.au.\n\nGiven the news that Simple Minds are potentially lined up for an Australian tour, the release of this single becomes more understandable.\n\n\"In my opinion \"Dont You\" is simply a great pop song. It is already an anthem for the eighties generation and having reached number one in America is still one of the most played radio cuts. Like most great songs it is inevitable that other generations will discover the song for themselves - they will want to re-mix, re-make and re-emphasise. White Spaces have done just that to perfection, I am lucky to be their first choice and look forward to the future output that I promise will be very special and certainly bring them much success!\" Jim.\n\nWhite Spaces featuring Jim Kerr\n\nAbsolutely/Big Records BIGS 002\n\n1.

The magazine were running an 80s Special, concentrating on the New Romantic movement, and interviewing Bob Geldof and Japan.\n\nWhilst Simple Minds were on the sidelines of the New Romantics, the interview concentrates on the band's experiences and growth during the 80s. Obviously the forthcoming 5 CD box set got several plugs:\n\nWhy release the box set now?\n\n\"It's almost part of the deal, if you're in a band which is lucky enough to have a long career like we have, that a thing like this comes out. It's like clearing the vaults. Six or seven years ago I would hae thought, is this stuff meant to be heard? Is it worthwhile? But since the advent of the Internet everything ends up in the public domain anyway, so you may as well take what is there and get it sounding good and packaged well. It's a thing for the hardcore fans, and gives them a chance to get it in its best light.\"\n\nNo Johnny And The Self Abusers material will be appearing on the box set, although Jim mentioned that he would've liked to include some.\n\nI've updated the links section with several new fan sites and tribute band New Gold Dream. If you have a Simple Minds site and it's not included then let me know and I'll add it.\n\nBelfast Child was used has backing music for a short documentary about snooker player Alex Higgins. It was shown a couple of times during the intervals of the World Snooker Championship finals.\n\nSpanish officials at Torrevieja barely contain their excitment whilst unveiling the line-up for a series of gigs at the town hall.\n\nSziget Festival is the largest open-air music festival in Europe. It's being held every year in August, on an island located in Budapest, Hungary. It lasts for 8 days. (Visit here for more information.)\n\nEvery year the organizers ask the public who would they like to see there. In 2002 and 2003 Simple Minds almost appeared, there were talkings between Sziget and the band management.\n\nI would like to ask all of you to help us, and vote for Simple Minds.\n\nPlease help us with voting for Simple Minds and hopefully this year we will finally be able to see Simple Minds playing live in Hungary.\n\nThere are two ways of voting.\n\nWrite an email to info@sziget.hu and tell them that you would like to see Simple Minds perform at Sziget Festival 2004.\n\nAlso please visit www.sziget.hu/fesztival/kivansaggep and type \"Simple Minds\" where it says \"1. eloado:\". At the bottom of the page you can find to buttons, press the one on the LEFT. (The writing on it is always changing.) (The other button always says \"Megsem\" which means \"Cancel\".)\n\nWARNING! You have to confirm your vote on the next page, by pressing the button on the left again.\n\nThank you for your help in advance,\n\nOtto Jung\n\nThe Hungarian Simple Minds Fan Club\n\nPart of the band's 2002 appearance at the Heineken Music Hall (Ghostdancing, See The Lights, Waterfront and One Step Closer) can be found here.\n\nStill unable to track down a copy of Live And Rare?. Then contact Ed Desa who has several copies for sale.\n\nThe dance track underpinning the Frank'O Moiraghi remix of White Space's Alive And Kicking is Tori Amos' Professional Widow.\n\nUnconfirmed news from down-under: Simple Minds will be touring Australia in October with Blondie.\n\nThis time in Spain. Simple Minds will be playing Orense on the 7th July.\n\nSimple Minds will be playing the Liverpool Docks, UK on the 24th July. Tickets can be purchased tomorrow (Saturday 8th May) from 9AM by phoning 0870 151 4000.\n\nDirty Old Town, the charity single released as part of the Lord Of The Wing film of the life of Jimmy Johnstone, now has at least three release dates, all scattered throughout May. However, the single has definitely slipped, and will either be released on the 27th May (some retail sites) or the 31st May (Jimmy's site).\n\nThe single will be released as Jimmy Johnstone/Shane Macgowan. Simple Minds are the backing band for Dirty Old Town and Jimmy takes the mic. (Therefore it's going to be a different version than the one on Live And Rare where Jim's singing).\n\nSome websites are now suggesting a release date of the 21st June for the long awaited A History box set. Whilst this is a further step forward, I'm going to be cautious until the promos start turning up. Why? Some of these same retail websites still display the original aborted release of Our Secrets Are The Same (along with the bootleg sleeve) from last year.\n\nIf you're going to the Hannover gig (4th June), why not check out an After Show Party at the Labor club afterwards? The flyer (right) gives the details.\n\nWhilst researching Simple Minds early history, discarded, rejected and lost songs seem to litter the way between albums. Here Comes The Fool is perhaps the most well known, surviving long enough into the bands career to be pressed on the earliest musty bootleg LPs. Others, such as Caught In A Dream or Take Me To The Angels only surfaced on grotty cassettes, where the band can just be discerned through a wail of feedback, now amplified by repeated analogue copying.\n\nOccasionally a gem surfaces, and history gets rewritten. One such occasion was a manic piano rush by Mick, found languishing on the start of the so-called Rotters tape. Could it have been Sweet Things, a song oft-mentioned by the journalists of the day? It wouldve been easy to match a lone title with this anonymous music; leaving everything nicely packaged and ordered.\n\nToo easy. And too lazy.\n\nIt turned out to be called Hell; a title unknown to practically everyone, a song completely undocumented. Of course, that still left Sweet Things, a song seemingly now completely lost.\n\nToday I was sent a CD copy of the bands Grangemouth gig, recorded in December 1978 at the draughty town hall. The sender shared my quest for Sweet Things, and offered a solution, because the opening number, given the title Destiny, did not sound quite right to her.\n\nSo, I played the CD with interest, hoping, perhaps to be given a clue. In fact, it was more than I couldve hoped for: Simple Minds emerged from the wings that night with this majestic, sprawling, elongated opening that announced to all and sundry that the band were definitely on stage. After three minutes of posturing, they settled, allowing Jim to settle on a melody that sounded like Destiny - but most definitely wasnt. Sweet Things he sang over the chorus and the quest was over.\n\nSo, I sat down and filled in the page on Sweet Things, sighed over the tame, sanitised Destiny, and listened to the rest of the concert. Another epiphany, another realisation; Murder Story was literally one step away from Life In A Day: Mick's plodding backing chords were there, along with Life's characteristic musical game of tag; chasing up and down the scales with Charlie. No wonder it spilled out during the rehearsals for the album.\n\nI had to share. The rough, acoustically horrible, recording of Sweet Things has been uploaded (plus the quick snippet of Hell I put up a couple of years ago). Enjoy!\n\n(So, that just leaves Rosemarys Baby then.)\n\nSimple Minds will be playing Palermo, Sicily on the 13th July. For a list of all the dates, check out the tour dates section.\n\nInformation about this new German remix has been added to the discography.\n\nNot much is known about it at the moment. It's believed to be a German bootleg but hopefully more details will surface soon.\n\nAs for the remix itself, it's a cut-and-paste, resampling of the original 1985 release. And not bad at that - although it is a little on the 'fast' side.\n\nBilly Sloan exclusively played the new single, Dirty Old Town on his Radio Clyde show last night. Released on the 3rd May, this version of the song features a duet between Jim Kerr and Jimmy Johnstone.\n\nSimple Minds finally got national press coverage with this advert which appeared in the Daily Mail on the 10th April.\n\nFor further information, and ticket details, about the NDR Plaza Festival, Hannover, Germany on Friday, 4th June, check out NDR2's website.\n\nOrdering information about Charlecote is given in the press article below.\n\nAnd another new date has been added: 19th June in Portugal.\n\nBlowups, the Italian Simple Minds cover band, will be playing Wild Live And Kickin' at the Magic Bus in Marcon (Venice) on Saturday 8th May. They're teaming up with Duran Duran cover band Notorious for the event.\n\nMore information can be found on Blowup's Website.\n\nA one track DJ promo of Cynical Heart by Jam And Spoon featuring Jim Kerr has just turned up. Full details have been added to the discography.\n\nRemember the news about all the archive recordings being discovered in Radio Clyde's vaults? It turns out that the releases have started already through River Records - a label set up specifically to issue these rare recordings.\n\nTwo recordings of Simple Minds are listed in the archive. Unfortunately, they're not rare and unusual radio sessions, but are the oft-bootlegged Tiffany's gigs (from 29/12/81 and 21/12/82).\n\nThese great Christmas shows aren't listed in the release schedule as yet, but keep an eye on River Records' website for more information.\n\nThe Hungarian Simple Minds Fan Club are reissuing the Brasov DVD. Originally limited to 100 copies, a further 50 have now been made available.\n\nFull details about the release can be found on their website.\n\nTo order, e-mail the club at both of their e-mail addresses: cliftony77@index.hu and simpleminds@freemail.hu.\n\nDream Giver Redux, the successor to this site, moves ever closer to Simple Minds domination.... well, I've almost cleared the 1970s with the all new Life In A Day sections. Explore and enjoy! Lots of previously unpublished pictures and all sorts of new trivia and information.\n\nTo give a small example of the change, the old discography Life In A Day section on Dream Giver consisted of 30 files. The new discography is built from 119 files. And that's just the discography...\n\nBono better watch out Celtic legend Jimmy Johnstone is set to steal his crown as rock's top singer.\n\nWee Jinky has been compared to the U2 superstar after singing on new single Dirty Old Town. So today I am launching a campaign to get the former wing wizard on Top Of The Pops.\n\nI want Celtic fans to buy the CD when it's released on May 3. If just 20,000 of the club's massive support snap up a copy, it's guaranteed a slot in the UK Top 20.\n\nAnd if all 60,000 Celtic home fans buy the single, it could go all the way to No.1.\n\nThe Lisbon Lion who is battling motor neurone disease duets with Jim Kerr of Simple Minds on a brilliant cover of the classic Ewan MacColl song. It's taken from the soundtrack of Lord Of The Wing, a new DVD about Jinky's career.\n\nThe single also features On The Road To Paradise by former Pogues' frontman Shane MacGowan. And the DVD's title track is by Scots songwriter John McLaughlin. John told me: \"Jimmy's voice is absolutely brilliant. I was a wee bit wary at first, thinking he'd just be another footballer who fancied himself as a singer. But he sounds like an older version of Bono. When I first heard Dirty Old Town, I didn't believe it was Jimmy. You'll be amazed.\"\n\nAnd Minds' star Jim Kerr said: \"We wanted to do Dirty Old Town in the style of John Lennon's album Rock 'N' Roll.\"\n\n\"We asked Jimmy to sing on the track, not through sentiment, but because he's got a great voice. He's so good, I was happy to take a back seat.\"\n\nWee Jinky admitted he's nervous about appearing on Top Of The Pops.\n\nHe joked: \"I'd love to do the show but couldn't you get a younger Jimmy Johnstone lookalike?\"\n\nBilly Sloan\n\nSunday Mail\n\n4th April 2004\n\nIt's the end of an era: jo62@dial.pipex.com is no more. Please can you update your address lists and use the catchy simon@simpleminds.org in future. Thanks.\n\nOld 2003 tour clothing merchandise is available from www.swagshop.com. You too could be the proud owner of a T-shirt with the dodgy Our Secrets Are The Same artwork, or a black shirt with the album titles on it. (Well, some of them. And of those, they're in the wrong order and spelt incorrectly.)\n\nA 12\" called ATE 1 vs Simple Minds has just surfaced. Featuring an unauthorised remix of Alive And Kicking, this one-sided bootleg is available from americandisco.net.\n\nFirst impressions (from the clip on americandisco.net) is a cut-and-paste remix of the original 1985 track, sped up slightly with the usual new drum effects. (Some might consider this more friendly than the more hard core remixes released through Absolutely.)\n\nFull details of the double 12\" promo Alive And Kicking single by White Spaces featuring Jim Kerr have been added to the discography.\n\nUnlike the Don't You (Forget About Me) release, these remixes are far more contemporary. Only the White Spaces Electro Decade Mix and Niki B & Christian E.F.F.E. Mix retain the melody of the original. Therefore only get the second 12\" (Absolutely ABR 058) if you're cautious.\n\nTo avoid ordering from separate shops, both are available (with some other White Spaces and Biba-Rom releases) from americandisco.net.\n\nSome websites and small extra details have been added to the tour dates.\n\nFull details of Mel's single have been added to the discography.\n\nAnd more live dates have been added. The current totals are one gig in The Netherlands; one in Switzerland; one in Ireland (where Simple Minds are Special Guests of Bryan Adams - so it might not be a full set); one in Denmark; two in Spain; two in Belgium and three in the UK.\n\nThe following little press release is also floating around:\n\n\"Pop legends, Simple Minds have just been added to the Killarney SummerFest 2004 line up. Simple Minds and Bryan Adams play Fitzgerald Stadium, Killarney on 25 June.\n\nThe performance coincides with the release of their new album \"A History\"[1] that is to be released in June.\n\nFormed in 1978, Simple Minds have been at the forefront of music for more than 25 years. They have released over 20 albums to date and have had a multitude of top ten singles and albums both in the UK and US Don't miss your chance to see Simple Minds play hits like 'Don't You Forget About Me', 'Speed Your Love', 'All The Things She Said' and 'She Moved Through the Fair'[2]. Tickets to Bryan Adams and Simple Minds are on sale now.\n\n\"\n\n[1]: This, of course, being the box-set, featuring the 'new' album Our Secrets Are The Same.\n\n[2]: Or, more likely, Belfast Child.\n\nMeanwhile, Guilfest is the 6th biggest rock/pop festival in Britain with a capacity of 15000 and will be promoted heavily on BBC Radio Two. More details about this festival can be found on their website: Blondie on the 16th July, Simple Minds on the 17th and UB40 on the 18th.\n\nTwo new dates have been announced for Spain: 9th July at Valencia and the 10th July at Torrevieja.\n\nThe current 2004 tour can be seen here.\n\nSome Sweet Day, the now annual all-day radio show devoted to Simple Minds, will be broadcast on July 15th. For 18 hours, 7 AM through to 1 AM (USA EST), Todd Richards will be playing singles, remixes, album tracks and rare B-sides.\n\nNo word on his legendary interviews yet, but here's hoping he'll talk to Jim again.\n\nJim was recently at EMI finalising the track listing for the forthcoming A History box set. This four CD package will feature early demos, rarities and other previously unreleased material including Our Secrets Are The Same.\n\nHaving kept his eyes fixed firmly ahead for so long, Kerr is still not entirely sure why anyone would want to look into various recesses in Simple Minds' history, although he admits that if I was hold a tape of a Roxy Music gig from 1972 he'd grab it out of my hand... \"I suppose I didn't think it would happen with us.\"\n\nHugh Fielder\n\nClassic Rock\n\nSimple Minds, along with Bryan Adams, will be playing Fitzgerald Stadium, Killarney, Ireland on Friday, 25th June.\n\nTickets are on sale now and can be purchased from Ticketmaster.\n\nJim is interviewed by Hugh Fielder for Classic Rock magazine (April 2004). Within its eight page, full colour spread, Jim talks mainly about the early days of Simple Minds and their rise to the stadiums.\n\nIt's worth getting for the colour pictures alone, and one or two new snippets of trivia jump from the pages. However, as a balanced review of Simple Minds, it glosses over the 1990s, forgets Cry and does feature one or two inaccuracies (particularly the picture captions with the current line-up being called 1984 vintage.)\n\nAnd not just the nostalgia seekers. \"Not at all,\" he confirms. \"The other night I noticed two really attractive girls down the front. Unfortunately in between them was their dad. But they were all really into it. And that's great.\"\n\nThere hasn't been a Simple Minds single for a couple of months; so it's time a new one came out.\n\nAlive And Kicking has been given the remix treatment, with several new tracks spread across two 12\" promos from Absolutely Records. Released today, the on-line samples (available via the excellent www.americandisco.net) reveals reworkings that are definitely in Judge Jules' jurisdiction.\n\nReleased under the White Spaces featuring Jim Kerr moniker, it's definitely a Simple Minds remix.\n\nBoth are available from www.americandisco.net.\n\nForget the link I published for the Liverpool downloads. Turns out that he's simply linking to files at Oliver Hilscher's site - well dodgy.\n\nSo, download them directly from www.hypnotised.de and let Oliver know how much you appreciate his work.\n\nEight pages of this month's Classic Rock Magazine are devoted to Jim.
