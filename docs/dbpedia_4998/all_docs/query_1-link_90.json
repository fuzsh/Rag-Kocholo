        "text": "Serum troponin elevation, characteristic of ischemic myocardial injury, has been observed in some acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. Its cause and significance are still controversial. The purpose of this study is to find determinants of troponin elevation and its relationship with stroke severity and location. Between January 2013 and August 2013, 114 consecutive AIS patients confirmed by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging were recruited in this study. Serum troponin T level was measured as part of routine laboratory testing on admission. Ten lead standard electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and stoke severity was assessed based on National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). Troponin T was elevated in 20 (17.6%) of 114 patients. Patients with elevated troponin were more likely to have higher age, higher serum creatinine and ischemic ECG changes. Troponin levels were higher in patients with more severe stroke measured by NIHSS [7.96 (6.49-9.78) vs. 13.59 (10...."
