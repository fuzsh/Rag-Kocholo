        "text": "So I've been having a think about how this whole Smooth-into-Gold thing would work, and I think I've come up with something, specifically a likely schedule for the relaunched station and a look at how DAB listeners will be affected by the changes.\n\nAs regards the schedule, we know Smooth will be required to reintroduce 7hr a day weekdays (including 6am-9am and any four hours between 9am-7pm, if I'm reading the Ofcom guidelines right) and 4hr at weekends of local shows. Currently Smooth Glasgow has local shows 6am-9am and 1pm-5pm, whilst Gold Wales runs local shows which IIRC are noon to 4pm (or at least they were when Gold was still doing local shows at this time on the network). So I've used this to cobble together what the Smooth schedule may look like following the big reshuffle:\n\nWeekdays\n\n0400-0600 early breakfast (this was introduced by Global following their takeover of Smooth, so I'm assuming it's staying)\n\n0600-0900 local breakfast on FM Smooth stations (Glasgow would continue as now) - London FM version on AM frequencies including Wales\n\n0900-1200 midmorning show (possibly Simon Bates, who presented midmornings under Global at Classic FM)\n\n1200-1600 local show on FM Smooths and Wales AM frequencies (Smooth Glasgow local show pulled forward an hour); London FM version on English AM frequencies\n\n1600-2000 network drivetime show, as now\n\n2000-0000 network evening show, as now\n\n0000-0400 overnight programming\n\nWeekends:\n\n0400-0600 'easy early breakfast' (built on Easy Going Gold as currently broadcast on the AM stations)\n\n0600-1000 weekend breakfast (networked)\n\n1000-1400 midmornings (local on FM Smooths, London FM version on AM frequencies)\n\n1400-1800 afternoons (networked)\n\n1800-2000 Smooth Movie Songs / Motown & Soul as now\n\n2000-0000 Saturday Night Fever / Smooth Soul Sunday as now\n\n0000-0400 overnight programming\n\nLocal FM/AM frequencies (as relayed on relevant local DAB) will carry localised news and advertising at key times as already provided on AM/DAB Gold and regional FM/DAB Smooth stations now.\n\nI've also analysed the DAB situation, based on the listings at http://www.wohnort.org/DAB/uknat.html and http://www.wohnort.org/DAB/ukloc.html and have made some predictions for the use of the DAB space; some of this is 'educated guesswork' based on what's happened in other areas where changes have been made, such as the former MXR regional areas. I've made the assumption that Global's first priority will be carriage for Capital, Heart and Smooth, as these will be their three key stations after the changes are made. Areas where none of the affected stations are carried, including Northern Ireland, aren't shown. I've spoilertagged it to avoid overclogging the forum, open the tab to see my analysis...\n\nEast Midlands - Leicester and Nottingham local multiplexes both carry Capital EM, Gold EM, Heart London and Xfm; Nottingham also carries Smooth EM. If the new oldies station replacing Gold on AM goes onto Digital 1, then the Gold local slots here will no longer be required - Leicester can switch to Smooth EM, whilst the Nottingham slot could be released entirely or used by another Global station (Chill?) on a placeholder basis until any permanent use of the slot is determined.\n\nYorkshire - the to-close-soon MXR regional mux carries local Real and Capital along with Gold, Heart London, Real XS Manchester and Xfm London. Given what's happened in other MXR areas, I'd wager Gold will be replaced by Smooth London, and ahead of the regional shutdown Real (to become Heart), Capital and possibly Smooth will roll down to local-layer. Xfm may do too if space allows, though given what's happened in other areas Real XS is unlikely to join them (it didn't roll down to local anywhere else, even in the northwest). As Real is becoming Heart, Heart UK won't join the local roll-down, as we saw in, say, the Northwest.\n\nNorth East - Real, which rolled down to local muxes at MXR closure, will become Heart, but otherwise no change needed\n\nWest Midlands - following rolldown of Heart, Smooth and Capital to local muxes at MXR closure, no further change needed\n\nNorth West - Liverpool and Central Lancs only change, following MXR closure, will be Heart replacing Real. Manchester will also make this change; the area's AM Gold and FM Real XS are currently not on DAB, though if the 'new' Gold goes to D1 that'll restore DAB coverage into this area, and if Communicorp/Global want XS on DAB then perhaps a deal with Bauer could be made to withdraw The Hits - which largely replicates Key 103 - and drop Capital and Magic to 112k/s (same as Real, Smooth) - these changes would free up 112k/s for XS.\n\nWales\n\nCardiff mux currently carries Real Wales, Heart UK, Capital South Wales and Gold Wales; Heart UK could be replaced by another station (Xfm?) when the Real-to-Heart flip happens, whilst Gold would become Smooth Wales. On other Welsh multiplexes the only affected station currently carried is Real, which will become Heart.\n\nScotland\n\nCentral Scotland regional carries local Real and Real XS, local Eddinburgh and Glasgow muxes carry Capital Scotland, Heart UK, Smooth Glasgow. Real XS becoming Xfm on regional would give it the same coverage the prior Xfm Scotland had pre-Galaxy/Capital. Heart Scotland (replacing Real) could take either the existing Real slot or the local Heart UK slot, with the other slot released or used for something else. Ayr will presumably replace Real XS, its only affected station, with the new Xfm.\n\nLondon - currently Capital, Heart, LBC News and Smooth on London 1, Gold and Xfm on London 2 and Chill and The Arrow on London 3. It's likely that L1 with Capital, Heart, Smooth will not change. Gold is replaced on AM by the new retro-hits service also going on AM in Manchester and East Midlands; if this is also transmitted on D1 in place of Smooth then it will be removed from L2. Xfm, Chill and Arrow carriage arrangements may change as a result of any reorganisation. There is also now 80k/s free on L1 following removal of LBC 97.3. If Chill moves here from L3 (it is currently at 64k/s) then LBC News could be upped to 64k/s in remaining ex-97.3 space.\n\nOther areas -\n\nBournemouth, Bristol & Bath, Cambridge, Exeter/Torbay/North Devon, Herts/Beds/Bucks/Northants, Kent, Norwich, Oxford, Peterborough, Plymouth, Reading/Basingstoke, Southend/Chelmsford, South Hampshire, Sussex Coast, Swindon - currently carry Gold (often local AM version), Capital and Heart, and in some cases other Global stations (mostly Xfm) - these would replace Gold with Smooth, but no other change is likely.\n\nIn Gloucestershire, as well as changing Gold to Smooth there is capacity to add further stations, most obviously Capital, which aren't currently carried, without removing existing services.\n\nIn Bath/West Wiltshire, Gold will probably become Smooth - and this mux currently carries Xfm but not Capital, so Global may choose to swap this around too if they want Capital available in all areas ahead of Xfm, as appears to be the plan.\n\nCornwall currently carries Capital, Heart and Xfm but not Gold; to continue Smooth availability in this area after D1 removal it would presumably have to replace Xfm, unless capacity is available to be leased for the addition of Smooth as a separate station.\n\nI'd also predict the new oldies station (London, Manchester, East Midlands AM and possibly national DAB) will be called Heart Time Tunnel, because Heart(space)TT fits the eight characters of a shortcode DAB display (and RDS, though that's not available on AM...)\n\n0"
