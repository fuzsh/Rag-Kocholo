        "text": "Tony Blackburn's weekend breakfast show on GMG Radio's Smooth Radio London is to be networked across four other of the company's network of stations around the country.\n\nBlackburn joined the London station in February this year and will be heard on Smooth stations in the east Midlands, west Midlands, the north-west of England and Glasgow from June 7. The newly networked show will be sponsored by Sky.\n\nJohn Simons, the group programme director of GMG Radio, said Blackburn's show was a \"real appointment to listen\".\n\n\"Tony is a legend and will be an asset to our weekend schedules on other stations in the Smooth Radio network. His show will provide our stations with a strong start to the weekend,\" Simons added.\n\nOne DJ will be leaving the network as a result of the change: Andy Marriott, who hosts the Saturday breakfast show in Smooth in the west Midlands, will exit the station.\n\nDave Croft in Smooth Radio's north-west station and Alastair Alford in Smooth's Glasgow station will both remain doing cover work for other DJs.\n\nIan Chilvers, who currently hosts the breakfast show in the east Midlands, is also its head of production and will be staying with the station.\n\nBlackburn's show airs between 7am and 10am on Saturday and Sunday. It will not be networked on the newest Smooth station, in the north-east, because of local programming requirements.\n\nHe follows the path of another former BBC Radio 1 DJ, Mark Goodier, who joined Smooth in London to host its mid-morning weekday show before being networked to other stations around the country.\n\nGMG Radio is part of Guardian Media Group, which also publishes MediaGuardian.co.uk.\n\nAll of the Smooth Radio stations increased their audience in the first quarter of this year, according to the latest Rajar figures, with a total weekly reach of 2.38 million listeners.\n\nÂ· To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
