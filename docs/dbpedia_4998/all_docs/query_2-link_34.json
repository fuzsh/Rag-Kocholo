        "text": "Listeners in Newcastle will hear their local stories broadcast from Glasgow under plans to centralise news programming drawn up by radio giant Global, which could lead to the loss of up to 40 jobs.\n\nJournalists said the move by the commercial network which owns the LBC, Capital, Heart and Smooth brands, would “decimate local news” at a time when the BBC is also cutting its regional services.\n\nGlobal, home to star news broadcasters including Andrew Marr and Emily Maitlis, informed staff that it plans to restructure its 11 newsrooms across the country.\n\nNews centres in major cities including Leeds and Newcastle would close altogether under the move, which would place up to 40 news reading, reporting and production roles at risk of redundancy, i understands.\n\nStories about Newcastle and the North-East of England would instead be broadcast from a “hub” in Glasgow. News about Leeds and Yorkshire will be reported from Lancashire, through a hub in Manchester.\n\nThe changes would affect Capital, Heart and Smooth, which have networks throughout the country.\n\nThe local news centres affected include Birmingham, Nottingham, Milton Keynes, Bristol, Cardiff, Wrexham and Fareham.\n\nAn insider told i: “Journalists attended a meeting with senior management and were told they would all have to reapply for their jobs as part of a major shake-up of news provision.\n\n“Many jobs are going to be lost, while ‘news hubs’ will replace them in other centres, some hundreds of miles away from the area they serve.”\n\nThe figure said: “This is a huge decimation of local radio news provision for listeners to Capital, Heart and Smooth networks across the country.”\n\nA Global spokesperson said: “Whilst it wouldn’t be appropriate to comment on specific circumstances that may affect individuals, like any business, we’re constantly reviewing our structures and processes.”\n\nPaul Siegert, NUJ national broadcasting organiser, said: “This is yet another blow for local and regional news coverage. This comes at a time when the BBC also wants to cut back on its local radio output and news services and local newspapers have also been cutting back and axing journalism jobs.”\n\nMr Siegert added that “there is a real appetite from local people to know what’s going on in their communities. We call on the BBC and Global to rethink their plans.”\n\nThe NUJ is supporting members at Global through consultation meetings.\n\nAn NUJ spokesperson added: “We’re obviously very concerned about the potential prospect of compulsory redundancies so we are hoping that Global’s management will instead consider a voluntary approach.”\n\nMedia regulator Ofcom is unlikely to intervene. A spokesman said: “All commercial radio licences contain requirements around the amount of local news which they are required to broadcast.”\n\n“We have also published localness guidelines, which indicate ways in which these requirements might be met, but beyond that it’s up to licensees to determine how they will meet the requirements in their licences.”\n\nThe news cuts will not affect the News Agents podcast presented by ex-BBC journalists Maitlis, Jon Sopel and Lewis Goodall, which is produced by an independent company for Global.\n\nBBC journalists in England will stage a 24-hour strike on Thursday, the third walk-out in protest at cuts to local radio programming which have made many popular presenters redundant.\n\nRegional and local newspapers have been hit by further rounds of redundancies at National World titles, with the publisher of the Yorkshire Post and Scotsman announcing 34 roles to go.\n\nReach, the publisher of the Daily Mirror and Daily Express and 240 regional papers including the Bristol Post, Liverpool Echo and Manchester Evening News, has also announced cuts."
