        "text": "A subgroup of patients with ROSC after cardiac arrest (CA) with disturbed cerebral autoregulation might benefit from higher mean arterial pressures (MAP). We aimed to (1) phenotype patients with disturbed autoregulation, (2) investigate whether these patients have a worse prognosis, (3) define an individual optimal MAP per patient and (4) investigate whether time under this individual optimal MAP is associated with outcome. Prospective observational study in 51 post-CA patients monitored with near infrared spectroscopy. (1) 18/51 patients (35%) had disturbed autoregulation. Phenotypically, a higher proportion of patients with disturbed autoregulation had pre-CA hypertension (31±47 vs 65±49%, p=0.02) suggesting that right shifting of autoregulation is caused by chronic adaptation of cerebral blood flow to higher blood pressures. (2) In multivariate analysis, patients with preserved autoregulation (n=33, 65%) had a significant higher 180-days survival rate (OR 4.62, 95% CI [1.06:20.06..."
