        "text": "Is it not? In that case why has the Smooth Network recently achieved it's highest reach on record? And why has the North West station become by far the most listened to station in the region with 860,000 listeners?\n\nIt's the Smooth NW model which has been imposed on the rest of the country (with the exception of two shows a day on Smooth Glasgow).\n\nWhile it clearly works in NW England, the same format has bombed in London where they have tighter formats operated by better resourced media groups.\n\nAs for smart networking, there's none of that on 102.2 in London, except for a pre-recorded travel bulletin from Trafficlink as they've basically simulcasted the Digital One DAB feed and that's your lot.\n\n0\n\nIt's the same as most other pseudo National services offering a mix of live, smart networking and voicetracked programming.\n\nIt's budget cost radio and it's not working too well competing with AM commercial heritage stations offering similar programming or BBC Radio 2 which it was programmed to win audience from.\n\nDo you mean Gold network? Smooth radio reaching over 3 million people over 15, Gold reaching 1.5 million. Magic does have over 4 million listeners, 2.2 million to the London one, so assuming that you mean Magic AM, added to Gold comes to 3.3 million. Think Smooth is doing well, when it huge parts of the country it is only on DAB and to be honest in a region which only has it on DAB it has had little promotion, just word of mouth.\n\n0\n\nIt's the Smooth NW model which has been imposed on the rest of the country (with the exception of two shows a day on Smooth Glasgow).\n\nWhile it clearly works in NW England, the same format has bombed in London where they have tighter formats operated by better resourced media groups.\n\nAs for smart networking, there's none of that on 102.2 in London, except for a pre-recorded travel bulletin from Trafficlink as they've basically simulcasted the Digital One DAB feed and that's your lot.\n\nLooking at Gold in London it has less listeners. But does London's demographics go against it?\n\nI have met a lot of people who went to London when they were 19. they got married and moved to the commuter belt towns. Bearing in mind John Cleese who described London as not an English City, whilst Smooth (and Gold) play music from the 60's and 70's how much of it is based on UK charts? I meet people from Africa/Eastern Europe, and the music they know from those decades (if any) is what they heard on an American Movie. Funny enough Heart when in plays older music selects stuff off soundtrack albums, and less The Beatles.\n\nSo Smooth and Gold may struggle in London, and will in the future as they play music that 'new' Londoners did not grow up listening to.\n\n0\n\nThere's a misconception that Smooth is an oldies station because of the previous Saga format on some of the regional stations. It's not, it's a supposed Easy Listening format with a hybrid of Soul/Motown, some soft rock, classic hits and new music.\n\nI think the only time it came close to being an oldies station in London was during the test transmissions on 102.2 as it changed from Smooth FM where a lot of crooners were playlisted.\n\n0\n\nIt's the Smooth NW model which has been imposed on the rest of the country (with the exception of two shows a day on Smooth Glasgow).\n\nWhile it clearly works in NW England, the same format has bombed in London where they have tighter formats operated by better resourced media groups.\n\nAs for smart networking, there's none of that on 102.2 in London, except for a pre-recorded travel bulletin from Trafficlink as they've basically simulcasted the Digital One DAB feed and that's your lot.\n\nLooks like from the announcement when the station went national all production is done from either Manchester or the Glasgow opt out, with the DJs in London just voicing the links when the producer and news team is now in Manchester.\n\nhttp://radiotoday.co.uk/rajar/\n\nHowever looking at rajar the London figures for 102.2 Smooth have always fluctuated between 1.2 and 2.1% share over the last 5 years so the format has not quite bombed in London, just in a competitive market where older listeners must swap listening between Smooth, Magic, Gold and R2 on a day to day basis!\n\nThe national share is higher at 2.4% and seems to be increasing, but a long way to go to match the NW 6.7% share!\n\n0\n\nLooks like from the announcement when the station went national all production is done from either Manchester or the Glasgow opt out, with the DJs in London just voicing the links when the producer and news team is now in Manchester.\n\nhttp://radiotoday.co.uk/rajar/\n\nHowever looking at rajar the London figures for 102.2 Smooth have always fluctuated between 4 and 6% share over the last 5 years so the format has not quite bombed in London, just in a competitive market where older listeners must swap listening between Smooth, Magic, Gold and R2 on a day to day basis!\n\nWhile you're right to say there's always been a pattern with Smooth's Rajar, this is supposed to be the big change where they can use nationally known presenters on a supposed national radio station. Not even a bunch of ex R1 presenters can get them out of the rhythm of switching between better established stations which have better targeted playlists.\n\nStage 2 should be to switch Carlos and David Jensen. Why a regional presenter is presenting drive and the Kid is on afternoons beggars belief.\n\nIt really does make me wonder if Capital Gold should have been awarded the 104.9 licence in the mid 90s.\n\n0\n\nLooks like from the announcement when the station went national all production is done from either Manchester or the Glasgow opt out, with the DJs in London just voicing the links when the producer and news team is now in Manchester.\n\nFurther to this there are announcements the Simon Bates show is coming from Australia next week, presumably just adding voice with a voice codec and computer link with the production team in Manchester letting him know whats coming up next and playing music?\n\nBut if he can do this from Australia wonder if he does his normal show in a London studio or from his home (in Bucks?)\n\nhttp://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-8497324/Simon-Bates-Disc-jockey-Simon.html\n\n0\n\nAlso, Smooth London is supposed to have a licence agreement to play a certain percentage of songs over a certain age. 40 years springs to mind.\n\nIIRC, they were granted the format change from the old Jazz/Smooth format on this condition, supposedly because there was a gap in the London market for radio for the over 50s.....\n\nMany of the old motown classics like the the Supreme's Reflections they played this morning come into this category, along with Dusty Spingfield which they play a lot, so will be interesting to see if it meets the quota!\n\nHowever some of the new \"easy listening\" music, especially Amy Winehouse and Adele for example, is actually liked by the over 50's!\n\n0\n\nIIRC, they were granted the format change from the old Jazz/Smooth format on this condition, supposedly because there was a gap in the London market for radio for the over 50s.....\n\nThere is a huge gap in the market for a commercial station serving the over 50's but GMG just didn't understand that market! They bought Saga Radio which was a proper over 50's station with exellent local news and features, a wide and varied playlist, unique presentation style and access to the lucrative and expanding over 50's audience who have lots of disposable income. GMG stated that the BBC should cater for the over 50's and ditched the Saga format for Smooth and in the process have lost market share in Central Scotland where they compete with their own Real brand and long established heritage stations.\n\nSmooth may have attracted more listeners in total across the UK but mainly as a result of extending its reach. In Glasgow and Central Scotland the brand has done well to maintain reach but has lost lots of hours. I don't think GMG's performance with either Smooth or Real can be regarded as good in Scotland over the past two years and sadly they seem hell bent on diluting local content making prospects for Real and Smooth poor. At the end of the day I doubt if anyone would shed a tear if Real became Heart and Smooth was replaced with Gold on FM. I know that would result in further networked output but there would be more variety with the removal of duplication of football phone-ins and a proper oldies alternative on FM.\n\n0\n\nTo answer the OP's original question - 99% of the time (including overnights, which is a rarity in a lot of cases) Smooth is totally live. It does have a certain amount of pre-recs, as with any other station.\n\nThe reason you hear local advertising is because each region where a separate regional FM licence is held has it's own sales office, normally in the building the studios for that region were housed in. Local ad's are triggered with a network command from Manchester - so when Mark Goodier hits an ad break, a computer fires local messages in each part of the country.\n\nThere's also a standard news in for each region which is fired in the same way (apart from where the presenter is in which case they read their own news in). Each weather report is recorded before the show for each region and, in the same way, is fired at the relevant time by computer. It's all to make national output in some way relevant to different parts of the country.\n\n0\n\nSaga (the wider organisation) understands the over 50s market better than anyone, but couldn't make their radio stations make money.\n\nBecause hardly anyone wants to advertise to over-50s.\n\nMany of them may well have lots of cash to spend, but they're seen as more set in their ways, less likely to try new brands and less receptive to advertising than younger people.\n\nIf they buy a new car, it'll probably be a make they've driven before or had recommended by friends, not because they've been hooked by an ad shouting about alloy wheels and 12 months 0% finance.\n\nA generalisation maybe, but that's how the agencies work and therefore it's why commercial radio (and TV) is obsessed with attracting 18-39 year-old women.\n\n0"
