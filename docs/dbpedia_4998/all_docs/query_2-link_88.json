        "text": "Smooth Radio has turned to eight of its own listeners to front the marketing campaign for its launch as a national station next week.\n\nThe \"Smooth ambassadors\", recruited after a campaign earlier this year, will appear in the new marketing drive across TV, print and outdoor over the next six weeks. Around 1,000 Smooth listeners applied to be part of the new campaign.\n\nSmooth, owned by GMG Radio, said the listeners were recruited to reflect \"not only Smooth's outlook but the wide-ranging experiences and zest for life shared by the station and its audience\".\n\nEach ad, created by marketing communications agency KLP, features a highlight from the listener's life and a description of what they are doing now â€“ \"Attended saucy Spanish tomato festival ... Travels the world on a motorbike,\" says listener Kym Hofmann.\n\nSmooth Radio, which recently hired Simon Bates as its new breakfast DJ, will launch as a national network on Monday.\n\nThe TV ads, voiced by Nell Bryden, will air in the north-east, west Midlands and north-west in October and November. The outdoor ads will appear in the north-west, east Midlands and Glasgow, with press ads in women's and national listings titles including Woman's Own and TV Times.\n\nStuart Taylor, the GMG Radio chief executive, said: \"Smooth's listeners are passionate about life and music and with a little more money in their pockets than your average commercial radio listener are highly sought after by advertisers.\n\n\"The ambassadors in this new marketing campaign will have a real affinity with millions across the UK and will no doubt encourage new listeners to give the station a try as it becomes a national brand.\"\n\nSmooth Radio had an average weekly reach of 2.801 million listeners across its entire network in the first half of this year, according to the latest Rajar listening figures.\n\nIts five regional stations in England are being combined to create a single station, which will also broadcast nationally on digital audio broadcasting (DAB) platform Digital One. Its Scottish station will also be part of the new national network, but will retain its own breakfast and drivetime shows.\n\nGMG Radio is part of Guardian Media Group, the company that publishes the Guardian, the Observer and the theguardian.com website network, including MediaGuardian.co.uk.\n\nTo contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857. For all other inquiries please call the main Guardian switchboard on 020 3353 2000."
