        "text": "Podcast Priorities\n\n2024/25 Commissioning Round\n\nAs the podcast market has grown so has the challenge to cut through in this ever more congested marketplace. There are an estimated four million podcasts available worldwide and if thereâs a statistic that shows how quality counts in this intensely competitive arena itâs the fact that the top 1% of podcasts account for around 99% of downloads. In a world of massive choice only a minority of podcasts capture our attention.\n\nWe have opportunities for a limited number of high impact podcasts ideas which can cut through and can grow an audience. Be bold and ambitious. Whatever the subject â investigation, true crime, history, culture, entertainment, society and powerful personal stories â it will be expressed in gold standard production values, involve creative audio treatments and will be led by superb narrative storytelling.\n\nRemember the importance of strong portrayal. Our podcasts should be authentically rooted in Scotland while having universal appeal â The Missing Madonna, Dead Man Running are great examples of storytelling that achieves these dual aims.\n\nWeâd love to hear ideas that are genre-shifting or brings some fun, something unexpected, a twist on a story or subject thatâs not been done before and that target under-served audiences.\n\nSuccessful talent combinations can be crucial to podcast success, so we are also looking for high profile, big name talent that can provide their own unique take in the lifestyle, entertainment and comedy areas. We are also keen to look at podcasts which extend the brand of successful TV formats that can bring an audience across to BBC Sounds.\n\nWeâre also looking for ideas which can be returning series.\n\nAligning with Sounds Brands\n\nTo maximise discoverability, we looking to commission into key Sounds brands. Weâre working with audio teams in Northern Ireland, Wales and Local in England and have launched an umbrella brand that will host around four high impact narrative podcasts per year. This new podcast feed Crime Next Door will feature powerful, authentic storytelling from across the UK, rooted in our communities.\n\nTwo umbrella brands on Sounds, where we can feed in Scottish content\n\nCrime Next Door - Devastating crimes, pained communities\n\nDark crime documentaries â individual stories painstakingly told by Scottish communities shocked by murder, assault, horror and gore\n\nTone and treatment\n\nâ¢ Unvarnished, documentary style investigations\n\nâ¢ Intimate, authentic storytelling featuring a collection of voices from a community\n\nâ¢ Passionate, invested presenter typically with strong connections to the city or town where the crimes have taken place\n\nâ¢ Immersive podcast episodes 15-30 minutes long\n\nAssume Nothing\n\nIrresistible factual thrillers â nothing is ever as it seems\n\nTone and treatment\n\nâ¢ Events and stories once understood as true are re-examined with fresh eyes. PI-esque,re-investigating, trawling records and archives and persuading people to speak up\n\nâ¢ Topical or historical â telling audiences something about the place in which they live. Their own history (contemporary or much older) by stealth\n\nâ¢ Often dramatised elements\n\nâ¢ Guiding through events with hooky, thriller-esque narratives, laden with reveals and jeopardy, but based firmly in fact. Each episode finishes with the listener craving the next instalment\n\nâ¢ Episodes vary in length from 9 â 29 minutes dependent on topic and pace\n\nThe above briefs we are running as rolling commissioning, so weâre happy to receive pitches at any time.\n\nProposals need to be submitted via PiCos, the BBCâs commissioning system. If you donât have a log-in, contact radioscotlandschedules@bbc.co.uk for more information on creating an account."
