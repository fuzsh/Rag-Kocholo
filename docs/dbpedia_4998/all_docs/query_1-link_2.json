        "text": "Wondering what opinion is on how to dal with this becoming 105.2 Smooth Radio. The project page says\n\nThis article is rated Stub-class on Wikipedia's content assessment scale.\n\nIt is of interest to the following WikiProjects:\n\n\"If the renamed station retains the existing format Move the article to the station's new name, keeping the old name as a redirect. Then, update the article to refer to any changes to the station's name/ownership. Example: The Bear 102 becomes Touch FM (Stratford-upon-Avon). If the renamed station adopts a new format (in effect, a new station using the existing frequency), or if the station is changed due to regulatory intervention (loss of frequencies, etc.) Create a new article for the new station, but include a brief reference to the old station. Furthermore, the first air date field of the article's infobox should refer to the launch date of the new station. In addition, the article for the old station should be updated to indicate that the station in that form is now defunct. A good way to indicate this would be to append (defunct) to the station's name in its infobox.\"\n\nI'd be in favour of leaving this article and creating a new one on 105.2 Smooth Radio, but is the changeover considered a 'new format'? It's certainly significantly different."
