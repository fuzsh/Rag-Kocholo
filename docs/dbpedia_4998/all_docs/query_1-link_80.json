We present a case of high-grade undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma in the calf of a 48-year-old male that recurred as a thin, curvilinear ''tail'' of enhancing tissue at magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with extremely indolent growth over a 7-year period. The unusual imaging finding of a slowly enlarging ''tail'' should not be dismissed as postoperative changes, even for a high-grade soft tissue sarcoma.

Clinical presentation of scrotal/paratesticular pleomorphic MFH is usually a painless and gradual scrotal swelling. We report a case of scrotal MFH in a 63-year-old man who presented as Fournier gangrene after 10-month painful scrotal swelling and multiple procedures. The specimen of emergent debridement was submitted for pathologic and bacteriologic examination. Microscopically, the lesion had marked architectural and cytologic pleomorphism. The neoplastic cells were positive for vimentin, but negative for all lineage-specific markers. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization showed an aneuploid karyotype and negative results for lipomatous tumor abnormalities. Bacterial cultures of the specimen showed extensive growth of virulent polymicrobes. The diagnosis of scrotal/paratesticular pleomorphic MFH with concurrent Fournier gangrene was made. Thoracic computed tomography scan showed bilateral multiple pulmonary nodules. The patient died 1 month later.\n\nPDGFRa amplification in multiple skin lesions of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma: A clue for intimal sarcoma metastases.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nOsio, AmÃ©lie; Vignon-Pennamen, Marie-Dominique; Pedeutour, Florence; Le Maignan, Christine; Koskas, Fabien; LebbÃ©, CÃ©lÃ¨ste; Janin, Anne; Battistella, Maxime\n\n2017-05-01\n\nA 62-year-old human immunodeficiency virus-positive man was admitted for multiple cutaneous and subcutaneous nodules on his lower limbs, corresponding to an undifferentiated proliferation of spindle and pleomorphic cells, with irregular nuclei and numerous mitoses. The tumor cells were negative for a large panel of immunohistochemical markers, except CD10. MDM2 immunohistochemical staining was also negative, leading to the diagnosis of FÃ©dÃ©ration Nationale des Centres de Lutte contre le Cancer grade III undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS). Array-comparative genomic hybridization showed a highly complex karyotype, with amplification of the 4q12 region, an area that contains only the platelet-derived growth factor receptor Î± (PDGFRa) gene. This amplification of PDFGRa, molecular hallmark of intimal sarcoma (IS), led to the diagnosis of skin IS metastasis. A positron emission tomography showed a hypermetabolic mass protruding in the preaortic area, consistent with the diagnosis of aortic IS. Our study shows that a rare differential diagnosis in peripheral UPS can be IS skin metastasis, and underlines the importance of molecular analyses in UPS. Â© 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

She first noticed the mass one month previously. Core needle biopsy showed connective tissue including epithelioid and spindle cells. The patient underwent total mastectomy without axillary lymph node dissection. Based on examination of the excised tumor, the initial pathologic diagnosis was atypical spindle-shaped and ovoid cells with uncertain malignant potential. Histological findings with immunomarkers led to the final diagnosis of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. This case highlights a rare and interesting variant of primary breast sarcoma and the important role of immunohistochemistry in defining histological type and differential diagnosis. Hence, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma has been a diagnosis of exclusion performed through sampling and critical use of ancillary diagnostic techniques.\n\nMFH classification: differentiating undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma in the 21st Century.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMatushansky, Igor; Charytonowicz, Elizabeth; Mills, Joslyn; Siddiqi, Sara; Hricik, Todd; Cordon-Cardo, Carlos\n\n2009-08-01\n\nThe essence and origin of malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) have been debated for now close to five decades. Originally characterized as a morphologically unique soft-tissue sarcoma subtype of unclear etiology in 1963, with a following 15 years of research only to conclude that \"the issue of histogenesis [of MFH] is largely unresolvable\"; it is \"now regarded as synonymous with [high grade] undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma and essentially represents a diagnosis of exclusion\". Yet despite this apparent lack of progress, the first decade of the 21st century has seen some significant progress in terms of defining the origins of MFH. Perhaps more importantly these origins might also pave the way for novel therapies. This manuscript will highlight MFH's troubled history, discuss recent advances, and comment as to what the coming years may promise and what further needs to be done to make sure that progress continues.\n\nIndistinguishable genomic profiles and shared prognostic markers in undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma and leiomyosarcoma: different sides of a single coin?\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nCarneiro, Ana; Francis, Princy; Bendahl, PÃ¤r-Ola\n\n2009-01-01\n\nSoft tissue sarcoma (STS) diagnostics and prognostics are challenging, particularly in highly malignant and pleomorphic subtypes such as undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) and leiomyosarcoma (LMS).

These tumors are rare overall, making up approx. 0.1-0.4% of all lung malignancies. They are more commonly found in males who are heavy smokers, diagnosed at the age of 60 on average and follow an aggressive clinical course.

Their aggressiveness is local with no potential for metastasis or dedifferentiation. Here we report on a 61-year-old patient who presented a locally advanced breast desmoid tumor diagnosed 20Â years after post-operative radiotherapy for breast carcinoma. After 2Â years of medical treatment, a high-grade undifferentiated pleomorphic soft tissue sarcoma arose within the desmoid tumor. Despite extensive surgery removing both tumors, the patient showed locoregional relapse by the sarcoma, followed by multimetastatic progression, then death 25Â months after the surgery. The arising of a soft tissue sarcoma in a desmoid tumor is an exceptional event since our case is the fourth one reported so far in literature. It reinforces the need for timely and accurate diagnosis when a new mass develops in the region of a preexisting desmoid tumor, and more generally when a desmoid tumor modifies its clinical or radiological aspect.\n\nMRI guided needle localization in a patient with recurrence pleomorphic sarcoma and post-operative scarring\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nChang, Ching-Di [Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Department of Radiology, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung (China); Harvard Medical School, Department of Radiology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA (United States); Wei, Jesse; Wu, Jim S.

Here we introduce an alternative use of this technique to help with surgical resection of a recurrent pleomorphic sarcoma embedded in extensive post-treatment scar tissue. We describe a case of recurrent pleomorphic soft tissue sarcoma in the thigh after treatment with neoadjuvant therapy, surgery, and radiation. Due to the distortion of the normal tissue architecture and formation of extensive scar tissue from prior treatment, wire localization under MRI was successfully used to assist the surgeon in identifying the recurrent tumor for removal.

Firm, solid, white to tan neoplastic nodules, often with cavitated or soft grey-red necrotic centres, were observed throughout most internal organs, subcutaneous tissues and skeletal muscles on gross examination. Microscopically, the tumour consisted of pleomorphic spindle cells forming interlacing fascicles with a focal storiform pattern with large numbers of bizarre polygonal multinucleate cells, frequently within a collagenous stroma. Immunohistochemistry, Masson's trichrome stain and transmission electron microscopy designated the myofibroblast as the cell of origin. This is the first case of a high-grade myofibrosarcoma in a grizzly bear.

UPS of the gastrointestinal tract is known to be rare and only a few cases have been reported in the literature. Based on our case and review of the other relevant literature, the CT findings of primary UPS of the small bowel included nodular bowel wall thickening with homogeneous enhancement. It presents as a rapidly growing tumor without bowel obstruction, and it may be accompanied by distant metastasis.\n\nMyofibroblastic sarcoma of the base of tongue. Case report and review of the literature\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nTakacsi-Nagy, Zoltan; Fodor, Janos; Murakoezy, Gyoergyi; Pogany, Peter; Orosz, Zsolt\n\n2009-01-01\n\nBackground: Mesenchymal malignancies with myofibroblastic differentiation exhibit a spectrum from low-grade myofibroblastic sarcoma mimicking fibromatosis to pleomorphic high-grade sarcoma. Low-grade myofibroblastic sarcoma shows a wide anatomic distribution with a predilection for the head-and-neck region; however, intermediate- and high-grade myofibroblastic sarcomas in this localization are exceptional. Case Report: A 56-year-old woman with intermediate-grade myofibroblastic sarcoma of the base of tongue is presented. She was treated with surgical excision, but computed tomography proved local residual tumor. Reexcision and chemotherapy were refused by the patient. Irradiation was given to a total dose of 66 Gy. Result: 50 months after completion of radiotherapy, the patient is in good health without any evidence of disease. According to the review of the literature, base of tongue as the primary site of myofibroblastic sarcoma has not been published so far. Conclusion: Similarly to the low-grade form, intermediate- and high-grade myofibroblastic sarcomas may also occur in the head-and-neck region. In case of incomplete excision, radiotherapy may be an effective treatment.

In this study we describe a mouse model of soft tissue sarcoma mediated by adenoviral-Cre recombinase injection into Trp53fl/fl/Ptenfl/fl lox-stop-lox luciferase mice. Injection of adenovirus expressing Cre recombinase, either subcutaneously or intramuscularly in two experimental groups, results in viral infection and gene recombination with 100% penetrance within the first 24 hours following injection. Luciferase expression measured by real-time bioluminescence imaging increases over time, with an initial robust increase following viral injection, followed by a steady rise over the next several weeks as primary tumors develop and grow. Intramuscular injections were more commonly associated with evidence of systemic viral distribution than subcutaneous injections. All mice developed soft tissue sarcomas at the primary injection site, with histological examination identifying 93% of tumors as invasive pleomorphic sarcomas based on microscopic morphology and immunohistochemical expression of sarcoma markers. A lymphocytic infiltrate was present in 64% of the sarcomas in this immunocompetent model and 71% of tumors expressed PD-L1. This is the first report of a viral-Cre mediated Trp53/Pten mouse model of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. The bioluminescence imaging feature, along with high penetrance of the model and its immunological characteristics, makes it suited for pre-clinical studies of soft tissue sarcoma.\n\nBiomarker discovery in high grade sarcomas by mass spectrometry imaging\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nLou, S.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis thesis demonstrates a detailed biomarker discovery Mass Spectrometry Imaging workflow for histologically heterogeneous high grade sarcomas. Panels of protein and metabolite signatures were discovered either distinguishing different histological subtypes or stratifying high risk patients with poor survival.\n\nPrimary pleomorphic sarcoma of the ovary with rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMukherjee Sumana\n\n2009-04-01\n\nFull Text Available A 49-year-old patient presented with a right ovarian mass, which, on microscopy, showed to consist of haphazardly oriented large pleomorphic cells with abundant cytoplasm. Periodic acid Schiff stain was positive but negative with diastase digestion. Immunohistochemical staining with Desmin showed intense cytoplasmic positivity in almost all the cells. Cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, smooth muscle actin, HMB-45, S-100 and neurone-specific enolase were negative. Immunohistochemical staining with Myogenin showed intense nuclear positivity. There was no other primary tumor on extensive search. A diagnosis of primary sarcoma of the ovary with rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation was made. The incidence of similar tumors of the ovary are low and therefore little data are available on this uniformly lethal tumor. Thus, such cases need to be reported to pool experience so that the tumor can be diagnosed early.\n\nManagement and prognosis of patients with high-grade soft tissue sarcomas\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAlvegaard, T.A.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nDoxorubicin is one of the most active single agents in metastatic soft tissue sarcoma. This was the rationale for the evaluation og doxorubicin in an adjuvant situation for patients with high-grade soft tissue sarcoma in a randomized, Scandinavian, multicenter joint care program, which was carried out from January 1981 to February 1986, and included 240 patients. These patients comprised the base series for the investigations of the importance of the surgical margin and radiotherapy for local tumor control; the accuracy of malignancy grading and tumor typing; prognostic factors, including DNA content; and epidemiologic risk factors. The results showed that the use of doxorubicin as adjuvant chemotherapy did not have clinical benefit in patients with high-grade soft tissue sarcoma. The overall local tumor control was high (94 %) for radically operated on extremity-located tumors due to strict classification of surgical margins. The only risk factor for local recurrence was marginal surgery without radiotherapy with a four times higher risk than after compartmental or wide surgery. Twelve percent of the operations reported as radical were classified as marginal, demonstrating the importance of reevaluation of surgical margins, and in these patients the local recurrence rate was 37 %. The 5-year metastasis-free survival for the whole patients series was 55 %, with the extremes 79 % for the patients with no or only one risk factor and 0 % for those with four or five risk factors. The five prognostic factors found could be used for selection of high-risk patients for adjuvant chemotherapy in the future. The epidemiologic study gave limited support for an association between occupational phenoxy-acid exposure and soft tissue sarcoma development.

Six months after completion of scheduled therapy, he was found to have a new intracardiac mass, presumed recurrent Ewing sarcoma. EWSR1 fusion was not detected by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction from blood plasma. After no improvement with salvage chemotherapy, he underwent surgical resection that identified a low-grade spindle cell sarcoma. Despite the near-synchronous presentation of 2 unrelated sarcomas, extensive genomic analyses did not reveal any unifying somatic or germline mutations nor any apparent cancer predisposition. This case also highlights the potential role of utilizing plasma cell-free DNA for diagnosing tumors in locations where biopsy confers high morbidity.\n\nExtrauterine Low-Grade Endometrial Stromal Sarcoma\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nYu-Ju Chen\n\n2005-12-01\n\nConclusions: Low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma typically has an indolent clinical course and favorable prognosis. Surgical resection is the primary therapeutic approach, and adjuvant therapy with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or progesterone therapy should be considered for the management of residual or recurrent low-grade endometrial stromal sarcomas.\n\nUndifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma and the Importance of Considering the Oncogenic and Immune-Suppressant Role of the Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type 1: A Case Report\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSergio Lupo\n\n2017-05-01\n\nFull Text Available IntroductionSoft-tissue sarcomas account for 0.7% of all malignant tumors, with an incidence rate of 3 per 100,000 persons/year. The undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS with giant cells, a high grade tumor of soft tissue, is very unusual, especially in young adults before the age of 40. Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1 is a human retrovirus, classified as group 1 human carcinogens by The International Agency for Research on Cancer, that causes an aggressive malignancy known as adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia and a progressive chronic inflammatory neurological disease named HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP. HTLV-1 causes accumulation of genetic mutations in the host genome that could contribute to cellular transformation, one of the oncogenic features of HTLV-1.Case reportWe describe a case of a young woman with UPS who suffered from HAM/TSP with 3âyears of evolution. In 2013, the patient started with neurological symptoms: weakness in the legs and bladder dysfunction. One year later, the patient developed a mild paraparesis in both extremities, anti-HTLV-1 antibodies were detected in plasma and in cerebrospinal fluid, and HAM/TSP was confirmed. In November 2015, a benign ganglion cyst was first suspected without intervention and by March 2016 a sarcoma was diagnosed. Three weeks after surgical resection, the tumor aroused in deep tissue and behaved aggressively, implicating a curative wide resection of the fibula, joint reconstruction, and soft-tissue graft. Histopathological examination confirmed UPS with giant cells.Concluding remarksThe unapparent subclinical immunodeficiency state due to HTLV-1 infection deserves to be considered in order to carefully monitor the possibility of developing any type of cancer. Besides, reaching an accurate and timely diagnosis of UPS can be challenging due to the difficulty in diagnosis/classification and delayed consultation. In this particular case\n\nNon-lethal Clostridium sordellii bacteraemia in an immunocompromised patient with pleomorphic sarcoma.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBonnecaze, Alex K; Stephens, Sarah Ellen Elza; Miller, Peter John\n\n2016-08-03\n\nClostridium sordellii is a spore-forming anaerobic Gram-positive rod that has rarely been reported to cause disease in humans. Resultant mortality from infection is estimated at nearly 70% and is most often correlated with gynaecological procedures, intravenous drug abuse or trauma. C. sordellii infection often presents similarly to toxic shock syndrome (TSS); notable features of infection include refractory hypotension, haemoconcentration and marked leucocytosis. Although clinically similar to TSS, a notable difference is C. sordellii infections rarely involve fever. The organism's major toxins include haemorrhagic (TcsH) and lethal factor (TcsL), which function to disrupt cytoskeletal integrity. Current literature suggests treating C. sordelli infection with a broad-spectrum penicillin, metronidazole and clindamycin. We present a case of C. sordellii bacteraemia and septic shock in an immunocompromised patient who was recently diagnosed with pleomorphic gluteal sarcoma. Despite presenting in critical condition, the patient improved after aggressive hemodynamic resuscitation, source control and intravenous antibiotic therapy. 2016 BMJ Publishing Group Ltd.\n\nHistochemical and ultrastructural study of an elastofibroma dorsi coexisting with a high grade spindle cell sarcoma\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nM Alberghini\n\n2009-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Elastofibroma dorsi is a pseudotumoral fibroproliferative lesion characterized by polymorphic fiber-like deposits of elastinophilic material. Several theories have been reported explaining the pathogenesis of elastofibroma. Recent cytogenetic studies have demonstrated chromosomal instability in elastofibromas, not normally observed in non-neoplastic tissues. These chromosomal defects are commonly observed in aggressive fibromatosis too. Such clinical observations suggest a multistage pathogenetic mechanism for the onset of elastofibroma. This study, using histochemical, immunohistochemical staining techniques, and ultrastructural examination, describes the detection of an otherwise typical elastofibroma contextual to a high grade sarcoma. Hence, the coexistence of elastofibroma and high-grade sarcoma may suggest a causal link between the two pathological entities. The results obtained suggest that the coexistence of the two pathological entities is conceivably coincidental.\n\nHigh-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) of the cervix with bizarre cytological appearances ('pleomorphic HSIL'): a review of 19 cases.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nStewart, Colin J R\n\n2017-08-01\n\nCervical high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) are typically characterised by a proliferation of immature basaloid cells with relatively uniform hyperchromatic nuclei. In this report we describe 19 cases of HSIL exhibiting focal but very marked nuclear atypia often associated with multinucleation ('pleomorphic HSIL'). The bizarre cytological changes mainly involved the basal epithelium particularly in endocervical crypts where the neoplastic cells undermined the native glandular epithelial cells. Superficially invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SISCCA) was present in three cases (16%) and while this was more common than in a comparative series of 40 'conventional' HSIL excision specimens (5%), the difference was not statistically significant. All three invasive cases demonstrated additional histological features that have been associated with increased risk of SISCAA (expansile crypt involvement by HSIL, luminal necrosis, and/or intraepithelial squamous maturation), and the invasive foci were associated microanatomically with conventional-type rather than pleomorphic HSIL. The bizarre cells expressed p16 and p63 proteins but usually lacked mitotic activity and showed less Ki-67 labelling than adjacent conventional HSIL. These findings suggest that pleomorphic epithelial changes in HSIL do not necessarily indicate more aggressive biological behaviour and may, in some cases, represent a degenerative phenomenon.

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of radiation therapy on overall survival among patients with primary soft tissue sarcomas of the extremity who underwent limb-sparing surgery. Methods and Materials: A retrospective study from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database that included data from January 1, 1988, to December 31, 2005. A total of 6,960 patients constituted the study population. Overall survival curves were constructed using the Kaplan-Meir method and for patients with low- and high-grade tumors. Hazard ratios were calculated based on multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Results: Of the cohort, 47% received radiation therapy. There was no significant difference in overall survival among patients with low-grade tumors by radiation therapy. In high-grade tumors, the 3-year overall survival was 73% in patients who received radiation therapy vs. 63% for those who did not receive radiation therapy (p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, patients with high-grade tumors who received radiation therapy had an improved overall survival (hazard ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.57-0.79). In patients receiving radiation therapy, 13.5% received it in a neoadjuvant setting. The incidence of patients receiving neoadjuvant radiation did not change significantly between 1988 and 2005. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the largest population-based study reported in patients undergoing limb-sparing surgery for soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities. It reports that radiation was associated with improved survival in patients with high-grade tumors.\n\nNeoadjuvant chemotherapy for high-grade soft-tissue sarcomas of the limbs\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nRamos, Pedro; Gonzalez, Manuel; Perry, Fernando; Cardona, Andres Felipe\n\n2005-01-01\n\nBackground: the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for high-grade soft-tissue sarcomas of the limbs continues to be an area of controversy; however, the number of clinical studies favoring the use of an anthracycline and iphosphamide-based regimen is increasing steadily. This approach may provide some advantages for facilitating the surgical resection of the tumor and for local disease control. The historical 5-year survival rate of approximately 50% in this high-risk group treated with local therapy alone represents a poor standard of care; thus, there is a need to incorporate systemic therapy early in the management of these patients. Objective: to describe the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of soft-tissue sarcomas. Materials and methods: the records of 42 patients who attended the national cancer institute of Colombia in search for management of primary soft-tissue sarcomas were retrospectively reviewed. Ten patients with high-grade tumors larger than 8 cm, treated from June 2000 to February 2002 with neoadjuvant chemotherapy based on an anthracycline and iphosphamide regimen, plus vincristin and cisplatinum in selected cases, followed by surgery and adjuvant therapy with chemotherapy combined with local radiotherapy, were included. Evaluations of objective tumor response, survival, and toxicity were carried out. Results: after neoadjuvant therapy, s ix patients underwent conservative and limb-salvage surgery, three required radical interventions, and one refused surgical treatment. Seven experienced an objective response: it was complete in four and partial in three; the disease kept stable in two patients, and the tumor progressed in one case. After an average 46-month follow-up, four patients were permanently free of disease. Hematological and gastrointestinal toxicity was remarkable, and no patient had a long-term morbidity related to the treatment. Conclusions: this limited retrospective review suggests an advantage for the use of\n\nPrognostic Metabolite Biomarkers for Soft Tissue Sarcomas Discovered by Mass Spectrometry Imaging\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLou, Sha; Balluff, Benjamin; Cleven, Arjen H. G.; BovÃ©e, Judith V. M. G.; McDonnell, Liam A.\n\n2017-02-01\n\nMetabolites can be an important read-out of disease. The identification and validation of biomarkers in the cancer metabolome that can stratify high-risk patients is one of the main current research aspects. Mass spectrometry has become the technique of choice for metabolomics studies, and mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) enables their visualization in patient tissues. In this study, we used MSI to identify prognostic metabolite biomarkers in high grade sarcomas; 33 high grade sarcoma patients, comprising osteosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, myxofibrosarcoma, and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma were analyzed. Metabolite MSI data were obtained from sections of fresh frozen tissue specimens with matrix-assisted laser/desorption ionization (MALDI) MSI in negative polarity using 9-aminoarcridine as matrix. Subsequent annotation of tumor regions by expert pathologists resulted in tumor-specific metabolite signatures, which were then tested for association with patient survival. Metabolite signals with significant clinical value were further validated and identified by high mass resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) MSI. Three metabolite signals were found to correlate with overall survival ( m/z 180.9436 and 241.0118) and metastasis-free survival ( m/z 160.8417). FTICR-MSI identified m/z 241.0118 as inositol cyclic phosphate and m/z 160.8417 as carnitine.\n\nLeiomyosarcoma Ex Pleomorphic Adenoma of the Parotid Gland: A Case Report and Literature Review\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMichael Coulter\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available There is only one previously reported incident in the English literature of sarcoma ex pleomorphic adenoma of the parotid and there are only 8 cases of primary parotid leiomyosarcoma. In our case, a 79-year-old female patient presented to our care with left preauricular pain, swelling, and facial weakness. After CT imaging, she underwent left total parotidectomy. A spindle cell lesion was identified intraoperatively and the facial nerve was sacrificed. Subsequent analysis of the lesion yielded a diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma ex pleomorphic adenoma. After 30 fractions of radiation therapy, scans were negative for tumor. However, 18 months after first experiencing symptoms, she was found to have metastases to the brainstem and lung. When diagnosing sarcoma ex pleomorphic adenoma of the parotid gland, it is important to perform thorough immunohistochemical staining and exclude a previous history of sarcoma or other sources of metastases. Complete resection is critical due to the tumorâs local aggressiveness and metastatic potential. Although these tumors are not very responsive to chemotherapy or radiation, adjuvant treatment is commonly used when margins are unclear.\n\nHistotype-tailored neoadjuvant chemotherapy versus standard chemotherapy in patients with high-risk soft-tissue sarcomas (ISG-STS 1001): an international, open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3, multicentre trial.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGronchi, Alessandro; Ferrari, Stefano; Quagliuolo, Vittorio; Broto, Javier Martin; Pousa, Antonio Lopez; Grignani, Giovanni; Basso, Umberto; Blay, Jean-Yves; Tendero, Oscar; Beveridge, Robert Diaz; Ferraresi, Virginia; Lugowska, Iwona; Merlo, Domenico Franco; Fontana, Valeria; Marchesi, Emanuela; Donati, Davide Maria; Palassini, Elena; Palmerini, Emanuela; De Sanctis, Rita; Morosi, Carlo; Stacchiotti, Silvia; BaguÃ©, Silvia; Coindre, Jean Michelle; Dei Tos, Angelo Paolo; Picci, Piero; Bruzzi, Paolo; Casali, Paolo Giovanni\n\n2017-06-01\n\nPrevious trials from our group suggested an overall survival benefit with five cycles of adjuvant full-dose epirubicin plus ifosfamide in localised high-risk soft-tissue sarcoma of the extremities or trunk wall, and no difference in overall survival benefit between three cycles versus five cycles of the same neoadjuvant regimen. We aimed to show the superiority of the neoadjuvant administration of histotype-tailored regimen to standard chemotherapy. For this international, open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3, multicentre trial, patients were enrolled from 32 hospitals in Italy, Spain, France, and Poland. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with localised, high-risk (high malignancy grade, 5 cm or longer in diameter, and deeply located according to the investing fascia), soft-tissue sarcoma of the extremities or trunk wall and belonging to one of five histological subtypes: high-grade myxoid liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour, and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive three cycles of full-dose standard chemotherapy (epirubicin 60 mg/m 2 per day [short infusion, days 1 and 2] plus ifosfamide 3 g/m 2 per day [days 1, 2, and 3], repeated every 21 days) or histotype-tailored chemotherapy: for high-grade myxoid liposarcoma, trabectedin 1Â·3 mg/m 2 via 24-h continuous infusion, repeated every 21 days; for leiomyosarcoma, gemcitabine 1800 mg/m 2 on day 1 intravenously over 180 min plus dacarbazine 500 mg/m 2 on day 1 intravenously over 20 min, repeated every 14 days; for synovial sarcoma, high-dose ifosfamide 14 g/m 2 , given over 14 days via an external infusion pump, every 28 days; for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour, intravenous etoposide 150 mg/m 2 per day (days 1, 2, and 3) plus intravenous ifosfamide 3 g/m 2 per day (days 1, 2, and 3), repeated every 21 days; and for undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, gemcitabine 900 mg/m 2 on days 1 and\n\nAdjuvant radiotherapy in high-grade extremity sarcomas\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nFranca, Carlos Antonio da Silva; Penna, Antonio Belmiro Rodrigues Campbell; Carvalho, Antonio Carlos Pires; Vieira, Sergio Lannes\n\n2010-01-01\n\nObjective: to evaluate the therapies utilized in the authors' institution for management of high-grade extremity sarcomas, analyzing the overall survival rates following multidisciplinary treatment. Materials and methods: retrospective study developed in the period from 1993 to 2007 with 36 patients diagnosed with stages IIb/III, submitted to postoperative external beam radiotherapy, with or without boost dose, utilizing high-dose brachytherapy. Results: thirty-six patients underwent surgery followed by adjuvant external beam radiation therapy. Four patients (11%) received boost dose with brachytherapy, and seven (19%) received chemotherapy. The average dose for radiotherapy was 50 Gy (CI 95%: 47-53 Gy), and the four patients with brachytherapy boost received doses ranging from 16.2 to 35 Gy. Chemotherapy was indicated for seven patients (19%) with positive margins. Fifteen patients (42%) presented local or distant recurrence, and all of them progressed to death. Twenty-one patients (58%) remain with no clinical/radiological evidence of local/distant recurrence. The mean follow-up time was 88 months (IC 95%: 74-102). The overall seven years survival rate was 80%. Conclusion: combined surgery and radiotherapy is an effective treatment with excellent outcomes in cases where brachytherapy is associated, with improved overall survival rates.

Previous studies have revealed that isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and IDH2 mutations are present in a significant number of cartilaginous tumors including most conventional chondrosarcomas and dedifferentiated chondrosarcomas. These mutations have not been studied in UPSs of bone. We sought to investigate whether an IDH1 or IDH2 mutation signature could be used as a clinically diagnostic marker for the distinction of dedifferentiated component of chondrosarcoma from UPS of bone. Sixty-eight bone tumor cases, including 31 conventional chondrosarcomas, 23 dedifferentiated chondrosarcomas, and 14 UPSs of bone, were collected for IDH1/2 mutation analysis either using the Qiagen IDH1/2 RGQ PCR Kit or using whole-exome sequencing. IDH1/2 mutations were detected in 87% (20/23) of dedifferentiated chondrosarcomas and 30% (6/20) of conventional chondrosarcomas. No mutations were detected in the IDH1/2 codon 132 or codon 172 among 14 UPSs of bone. Identification of IDH1 or IDH2 mutations supports the diagnosis of dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma rather than UPS of bone while also providing some insight into the pathogenesis of these 2 lesions.

Of 31 cases with a soft tissue sarcoma of an extremity treated by conservative surgery and postoperative radiation of 3,000-6,000 cGy, local recurrence occurred in 12; 5 out of 7 synovial sarcomas, 4 of 9 MFH, one of 8 liposarcomas, none of 4 rhabdomyosarcomas and 2 of 3 others. As for the histological subtyping, the 31 soft tissue sarcomas were divided into spindle cell, pleomorphic cell, myxoid and round cell type, and recurrence rates were 75%, 33.3%, 16.7% and 0%, respectively. From the remarkable difference in recurrent rate, it was suggested that round cell and myxoid type of soft tissue sarcomas showed a high radiosensitivity compared to the spindle cell type with low sensitivity. Clarifying the degree of radiosensitivity is helpful in deciding on the management of limb salvage in soft tissue sarcomas of an extremity.

CASE REPORT We report on a patient with a rare primary undifferentiated high-grade spindle cell sarcoma of the mitral valve and in the left atrium, first diagnosed in 2014. The referring center did a first resection in 2014. In the course of 17 months, computer tomography (CT) scan again showed massive invasion of the mitral valve and left atrium. Partial resection and mitral valve replacement was not an option. We did a subtotal heart excision with total artificial heart implantation. In this report we discuss complications, risk factors, and perioperative management of this patient. CONCLUSIONS Patients with aggressive tumors of the heart can be considered for TAH implantation.\n\nPleomorphic lobular carcinoma: is it more similar to a classic lobular cancer or to a high-grade ductal cancer?\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nCostarelli L\n\n2017-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Leopoldo Costarelli,Â Domenico Campagna,Â Alessandra Ascarelli,Â Francesco Cavaliere,Â Maria Helena Colavito,Â Tatiana Ponzani,Â Laura Broglia,Â Massimo La Pinta,Â Elena Manna,Â Lucio Fortunato Breast Unit, San Giovanni-Addolorata Hospital, Rome, Italy Background: Pleomorphic invasive lobular carcinoma (P-ILC is an uncommon variety of invasive lobular carcinoma with aggressive clinical features. Little is described in the literature regarding this topic.Materials and methods: We reviewed our experiences from 2010 to 2015 and compared 40 patients with P-ILC, 126 patients with classic-ILC (C-ILC and 574 cases of high-grade invasive ductal carcinoma (HG-IDC. We studied the histologic and immunohistochemical features, clinical presentation and surgical treatment.Results: P-ILC is diagnosed at the same age and tumor diameter as those of the other two histologic types. It is associated more frequently with multiple lymph node metastases and high proliferative index, and HER2/neu is amplified in 10% of cases. In spite of sharing some histologic characteristics with C-ILC (same growth pattern, loss of E-cadherin expression, same genetic pathway, its clinical and pathologic features define an autonomous entity. Its surgical treatment is similar to those of C-ILC and HG-IDC.Conclusion: This is the first review comparing these three pathologic entities. Our findings may be useful in understanding this variety of invasive lobular carcinoma, and further studies are certainly needed in this field.

The PERsonalised SARcoma Care (PERSARC) model, predicts overall survival (OS) and the probability of local recurrence (LR) at 3, 5 and 10 years. Development and validation, by internal validation, of the PERSARC prediction model. The cohort used to develop the model consists of 766 ESTS patients who underwent surgery, between 2000 and 2014, at five specialised international sarcoma centres. To assess the effect of prognostic factors on OSÂ and on the cumulative incidence of LR (CILR), aÂ multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression and the Fine and Gray model were estimated. Predictive performance was investigated by using internal cross validation (CV) and calibration. The discriminative ability of the model was determined with the C-index. Multivariate Cox regression revealed that age and tumour size had a significant effect on OS. More importantly, patients who received RT showed better outcomes, in terms of OS and CILR, than those treated with surgery alone. Internal validation of the model showed good calibration and discrimination, with a C-index of 0.677 and 0.696 for OS and CILR, respectively. The PERSARC model is the first to incorporate known clinical risk factors with the use of different treatments and surgical outcomeÂ measures. The developed model is internally validated to provide a reliable prediction of post-operative OS and CILR for patients with primary high-grade ESTS. LEVEL OF SIGNIFICANCE: level III.

In order to improve its aggressive course or prognosis and establish new therapeutic methods, molecular genetic and biological characterizations of UPS are required. A new human UPS cell line (FPS-1) was established from UPS of the upper arm of a 79-year-old man. The cell line has been maintained for over 14 months with more than 60 passages. FPS-1 cells were characterized using molecular biological methods. FPS-1 cells showed the same morphological and immunophenotypical characteristics as the primary tumor. Cytogenetic and molecular analyses revealed a nonsense mutation in exon 6 of the p53 gene. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were expressed in FPS-1 cells. FPS-1 cells might be useful for investigating biological behavior and developing new molecular targeting antitumor drugs for UPS with EGFR or COX-2 expression.\n\nUterine sarcoma Part IIâUterine endometrial stromal sarcoma: The TAG systematic review\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHuann-Cheng Horng\n\n2016-08-01\n\nFull Text Available Endometrial stromal tumors are rare uterine tumors (<1%. Four main categories include endometrial stromal nodule, low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (LG-ESS, high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (HG-ESS, and uterine undifferentiated sarcoma (UUS. This review is a series of articles discussing the uterine sarcomas. LG-ESS, a hormone-dependent tumor harboring chromosomal rearrangement, is an indolent tumor with a favorable prognosis, but characterized by late recurrences even in patients with Stage I disease, suggesting the requirement of a long-term follow-up. Patients with HG-ESS, based on the identification of YWHAE-NUTM2A/B (YWHAE-FAM22A/B gene fusion, typically present with advanced stage diseases and frequently have recurrences, usually within a few years after initial surgery. UUS is, a high-grade sarcoma, extremely rare, lacking a specific line of differentiation, which is a diagnosis of exclusion (the wastebasket category, which fails to fulfill the morphological and immunohistochemical criteria of translocation-positive ESS. Surgery is the main strategy in the management of uterine sarcoma. Due to rarity, complex biological characteristics, and unknown etiology and risk factors of uterine sarcomas, the role of adjuvant therapy is not clear. Only LG-ESS might respond to progestins or aromatase inhibitors.\n\nNUTM2A-CIC fusion small round cell sarcoma: a genetically distinct variant of CIC-rearranged sarcoma.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSugita, Shintaro; Arai, Yasuhito; Aoyama, Tomoyuki; Asanuma, Hiroko; Mukai, Wakako; Hama, Natsuko; Emori, Makoto; Shibata, Tatsuhiro; Hasegawa, Tadashi\n\n2017-07-01\n\nCIC-rearranged sarcoma is a new entity of undifferentiated small round cell sarcoma characterized by chimeric fusions with CIC rearrangement. We report a NUTM2A-CIC fusion sarcoma in a 43-year-old woman who died of rapidly progressive disease. Histologic analysis revealed multinodular proliferation of small round tumor cells with mild nuclear pleomorphism. The sclerotic fibrous septa separated the tumor into multiple nodules. Immunohistochemistry showed that the tumor cells were diffusely positive for vimentin, focally positive for cytokeratin, and negative for CD99 and NKX2.2. Tumor cells were also negative for ETV4, which was recently identified as a specific marker for CIC-rearranged sarcoma. High-throughput RNA sequencing of a formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded clinical sample unveiled a novel NUTM2A-CIC fusion between NUTM2A exon 7 and CIC exon 12, and fluorescence in situ hybridization identified CIC and NUTM2A split signals. This case shared several clinicopathological findings with previously reported CIC-rearranged cases. We recognized the tumor as a genetically distinct variant of CIC-rearranged sarcomas with a novel NUTM2A-CIC fusion. Copyright Â© 2017.

No patients with leiomyosarcoma (n=10) had an objective response. Two (5%) of 40 patients with bone sarcoma had an objective response, including one (5%) of 22 patients with osteosarcoma and one (20%) of five patients with chondrosarcoma. None of the 13 patients with Ewing's sarcoma had an objective response. The most frequent grade 3 or worse adverse events were anaemia (six [14%]), decreased lymphocyte count (five [12%]), prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (four [10%]), and decreased platelet count (three [7%]) in the bone sarcoma group, and anaemia, decreased lymphocyte count, and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time in the soft-tissue sarcoma group (three [7%] each). Nine (11%) patients (five [12%] in the bone sarcoma group and four [10%] in the soft-tissue sarcoma group) had treatment-emergent serious adverse events (SAEs), five of whom had immune-related SAEs, including two with adrenal insufficiency, two with pneumonitis, and one with nephritis. The primary endpoint of overall response was not met for either cohort. However, pembrolizumab showed encouraging activity in patients with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma or dedifferentiated liposarcoma.

A 61-year-old female presented with a gradually growing breast mass with well-demarcated ovoid nodular shape. The tumor was histologically characterized by fascicular-growing spindle cell proliferation with large areas of hyalinized fibrosis and focally ductal epithelial remnants embedded in myxoid stroma, mimicking a fibroadenomatous lesion. It had frequent mitoses of 5-16/10 high-power fields, hemorrhagic necrosis, and focally pericapsular invasion. The spindle cells were diffusely immunoreactive for fibronectin, smooth muscle actin, and calponin, which suggest a myofibroblastic origin. Multiple irregularly thickened vessels with medial or pericytic cell proliferation were found to be merged with the intrinsic tumor cells. The tumor could be diagnosed low-grade myofibroblastic sarcoma arising in an old fibroadenoma. We report a case of a low-grade mammary myofibrosarcoma that showed a background lesion of fibroadenoma first in the worldwide literature and suggest the pericytes or medial muscle cells of the intratumoral vessels as the cell origin of the myofibroblastic sarcoma.\n\nSarcoma pleomÃÂ³rfico primÃÂ¡rio do pulmÃÂ£o\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMarcus da Matta Abreu\n\n2008-07-01\n\nFull Text Available Resumo: A classificaÃÂ§ÃÂ£o recente da OrganizaÃÂ§ÃÂ£o Mundial da SaÃÂºde (OMS para os tumores pulmonares unificou o heterogÃÂ©neo grupo do carcinoma de nÃÂ£o pequenas cÃÂ©lulas (CPNPC, que engloba os sarcomas e os tumores com componentes sarcomatosos, sob a denominaÃÂ§ÃÂ£o Ã¢ÂÂcarcinoma com elementos pleomÃÂ³rficos, sarcomatÃÂ³ides ou sarcomatososÃ¢ÂÂ.

In the present review article, conventional and new imaging modalities are discussed with regard to the monitoring of the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in such patients. Presurgical monitoring of response to chemotherapy may have an impact on modification of neoadjuvant treatment protocols, on patient selection for the performance and timing of limb-salvage surgery and on planning of radiation therapy (in non-operated Ewing's sarcomas) and selection of postoperative chemotherapy regimens. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging, as part of a routine MR protocol, assists in the detection of the most viable parts of the tumour and serves as an initial standard for follow-up of the metabolic activity of the tumour during and after chemotherapy, both in small intraosseous tumours and in tumours with an associated soft tissue mass. In combination with selected morphological features, dynamic imaging parameters are therefore advocated for monitoring the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with osteogenic and Ewing's sarcoma.

One hundred eleven patients affected by locally advanced and metastatic soft tissue sarcoma were selected. PML expression was evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis in pathological samples and in the corresponding normal tissue from each case. PML immunohistochemical results were correlated with prognosis and with radiological response to alkylating agents/antracycline-based first line therapy. PML expression was significantly reduced in synovial sarcomas (P < 0.0001), in myofibroblastic sarcomas (P < 0.0001), angiosarcomas (P < 0.0001), in leiomyosarcomas (P = 0.003), in mixoid liposarcomas (P < 0.0001), and in dedifferentiated liposarcomas (P < 0.0001). No significant difference was found for pleomorphic sarcoma [31.8 (95% CI: 16.7-41.0); P = 0.21]. and pleomorphic liposarcomas (P = 0.51). Loss of PML expression was found to be statistically correlated with TTP (P < 0.0001), median duration of response (P = 0.007), and OS (P = 0.02). No correlation was observed between PML expression and treatment efficacy. PML IHC expression is down-regulated in synovial sarcomas, myofibroblastic sarcomas, angiosarcomas, liposarcoma, and leiomyosarcomas and its expression correlated with prognosis.

There are only a few published case reports/series describing the cytomorphologic features of ALCL on fine-needle aspiration (FNA biopsy specimens. We describe a case of ALK-negative ALCL mimicking a high-grade soft tissue sarcoma of the thigh in a 62-year-old man. The characteristic morphologic findings on FNA and core biopsy along with the immunophenotypic profile are described and reviewed. The diagnosis of ALCL on FNA biopsy may be difficult, but can be done successfully with the use of ancillary tests. Therefore, it must be considered in the differential diagnosis of lesions with pleomorphism, anaplasia, and wreath-like or horseshoe-shaped nuclei to ensure that adequate material is obtained for ancillary studies.\n\nUltrasonographic findings of low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma of the uterus with a focus on cystic degeneration\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nPark, Ga Eun; Rha, Sung Eun; Oh, Soon Nam; Lee, Ah Won; Lee, Keun Ho; Kim, Mee Ran [Seoul St. Mary' s Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul (Korea, Republic of)\n\n2016-03-15\n\nThe goal of this study was to perform a retrospective analysis of the ultrasonographic findings associated with low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma. Ten pathologically confirmed cases of low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma at our institution from January 2007 to April 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. All patients underwent a preoperative transvaginal ultrasound. Two radiologists came to a consensus regarding the location, size, margin, and echogenicity of the tumor, as well as the presence of intratumoral cystic degeneration and its extent and configuration. Low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma manifested as an intramural mass protruding into the endometrial cavity (n=6) or as a purely intramural mass (n=4). The maximal diameter of the lesion ranged from 4 to 9.1 cm (mean, 6.2 cm). The imaging features of low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma were variable: six cases involved predominantly solid masses containing cystic degeneration, one was a predominantly unilocular cystic mass, two were ill-defined infiltrative solid masses, and one was a well-defined solid mass. Among the seven cases with internal cystic degeneration, five patients showed a multiseptated cystic area or a cystic area with multiple small clusters, while a unilocular cystic area within the tumor was found in two patients. Low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma is associated with variable ultrasonographic findings with regard to the location, margin, and configuration of the lesion. Multiseptated cystic areas and multiple small areas of cystic degeneration are common.\n\nHigh-grade myxofibrosarcoma-presented as a large mass of right upper arm\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSunil Vitthalrao Jagtap\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Myxofibrosarcoma is one of the rare soft tissue sarcomas. We present a case of a 65-year-old male having large soft tissue mass over right upper arm associated with surface ulceration. On histopathological study tumor was diagnosed as myxofibrosarcoma - high grade according to modified FNCLCC grading system. Like many other tumors of connective tissue, soft tissue sarcoma exhibits high recurrence. In our case, tumor showed features of high grade with local recurrence, large size; however, no evidence of metastasis was noted. For this unpredictable clinical behavior, we are presenting this case.\n\nPrognostic value of proliferation in pleomorphic soft tissue sarcomas\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nSeinen, Jojanneke M; JÃ¶nsson, Mats; Bendahl, PÃ¤r-Ola O\n\n2012-01-01\n\n= 1.6-12.1), Top2a (hazard ratio = 2.2, CI = 1.2-3.5) and high S-phase fraction (hazard ratio = 1.8, CI = 1.2-3.7) significantly correlated with risk for metastasis. When combined with currently used prognostic factors, Ki-67, S-phase fraction and Top2a fraction contributed to refined identification...... of prognostic risk groups. Proliferation, as assessed by expression of Ki-67 and Top2a and evaluation of S-phase fraction and applied to statistical decision-tree models, provides prognostic information in soft tissue sarcomas of the extremity and trunk wall. Though proliferation contributes independently...... to currently applied prognosticators, its role is particularly strong when few other factors are available, which suggests a role in preoperative decision-making related to identification of high-risk individuals who would benefit from neoadjuvant therapy....\n\nFeasibility of combined modality therapy for localized high-grade soft tissue sarcomas in adults\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBlum, R.H.; Greenberger, J.S.; Wilson, R.E.; Corson, J.M.\n\n1979-01-01\n\nSeventeen consecutive patients with localized, high grade soft tissue sarcomas had resection of their primary tumor, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. The soft tissue sarcoma was primary in 14 patients and regionally recurrent in 3 patients. Chemotherapy consisted of cyclophosphamide 500 mg/M 2 day 1, Adriamycin (ADR) 60 mg/M 2 day 2, and DTIC 400 mg/M 2 days 1 and 2, given every 21 days to a maximum ADR dose of 450 mg/M 2 . Cyclophosphamide and DTIC were then given to a total duration of 1 year. Radiation therapy consisted of 4000 to 5000 rad by megavoltage photons in 5 weeks, and in selected cases, an additional 1500 to 2000 rad by electron beam boost in the tumor bed delivered over 2 additional weeks. Following surgery, 12 patients were treated sequentially with an interval of chemotherapy, radiation therapy and then the completion of chemotherapy. The added morbidity of this sequential approach is minimal: one patient of 12 had delayed primary healing of her wound, 1 of 10 patients required a break in radiation therapy because of skin erythema. Four patients were treated with intensive pre-chemotherapy radiation therapy because of inadequate surgical margins. The median time on study was 18 months from onset of treatment (range, 8 to 41 months). Although there have been no local, regional or distant recurrences, the follow-up time is inadequate to assess the therapeutic benefit of this combined modality treatment\n\nThe Value of Surgery for Retroperitoneal Sarcoma\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSepideh Gholami\n\n2009-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Introduction. Retroperitoneal sarcomas are uncommon large malignant tumors. Methods. Forty-one consecutive patients with localized retroperitoneal sarcoma were retrospectively studied. Results. Median age was 58 years (range 20â91 years. Median tumor size was 17.5âcm (range 4â41âcm. Only 2 tumors were <5âcm. Most were liposarcoma (44% and high-grade (59%. 59% were stage 3 and the rest was stage 1. Median followup was 10 months (range 1â106 months. Thirty-eight patients had an initial complete resection; 15 (37% developed recurrent sarcoma and 12 (80% had a second complete resection. Patients with an initial complete resection had a 5-year survival of 46%. For all patients, tumor grade affected overall survival (=.006. Complete surgical resection improved overall survival for high-grade tumors (=.03. Conclusions. Tumor grade/stage and complete surgical resection for high-grade tumors are important prognostic variables. Radiation therapy or chemotherapy had no significant impact on overall or recurrence-free survival. Complete surgical resection is the treatment of choice for patients with initial and locally recurrent retroperitoneal sarcoma.\n\nUterine sarcoma - current perspectives.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBenson, Charlotte; Miah, Aisha B\n\n2017-01-01\n\nUterine sarcomas comprise a group of rare tumors with differing tumor biology, natural history and response to treatment. Diagnosis is often made following surgery for presumed benign disease. Currently, preoperative imaging does not reliably distinguish between benign leiomyomas and other malignant pathology. Uterine leiomyosarcoma is the most common sarcoma, but other subtypes include endometrial stromal sarcoma (low grade and high grade), undifferentiated uterine sarcoma and adenosarcoma. Clinical trials have shown no definite survival benefit of adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy and have been hampered by the rarity and heterogeneity of these disease types. There is a role of adjuvant treatment in carefully selected cases following multidisciplinary discussion at sarcoma reference centers. In patients with metastatic disease, systemic chemotherapy can then be considered. There is activity of a number of agents, including doxorubicin, trabectedin, gemcitabine-based chemotherapy, eribulin and pazopanib. Patients should be considered for clinical trial entry where possible. Close international collaboration is important to allow progress in this group of diseases.\n\nTumor-targeting Salmonella typhimurium A1-R is a highly effective general therapeutic for undifferentiated soft tissue sarcoma patient-derived orthotopic xenograft nude-mouse models.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nIgarashi, Kentaro; Kawaguchi, Kei; Kiyuna, Tasuku; Miyake, Kentaro; Miyake, Masuyo; Singh, Arun S; Eckardt, Mark A; Nelson, Scott D; Russell, Tara A; Dry, Sarah M; Li, Yunfeng; Yamamoto, Norio; Hayashi, Katsuhiro; Kimura, Hiroaki; Miwa, Shinji; Tsuchiya, Hiroyuki; Singh, Shree Ram; Eilber, Fritz C; Hoffman, Robert M\n\n2018-03-18\n\nUndifferentiated soft tissue sarcoma (USTS) is a recalcitrant and heterogeneous subgroup of soft tissue sarcoma with high risk of metastasis and recurrence. Due to heterogeneity of USTS, there is no reliably effective first-line therapy. We have generated tumor-targeting Salmonella typhimurium A1-R (S.Â typhimurium A1-R), which previously showed strong efficacy on single patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) models of Ewing's sarcoma and follicular dendritic cell sarcoma. In the present study, tumor resected from 4 patients with a biopsy-proven USTS (2 undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma [UPS], 1 undifferentiated sarcoma not otherwise specified [NOS] and 1 undifferentiated spindle cell sarcoma [USS]) were grown orthotopically in the biceps femoris muscle of mice to establish PDOX models. One USS model and one UPS model were doxorubicin (DOX) resistant. One UPS and the NOS model were partially sensitive to DOX. DOX is first-line therapy for these diseases. S.Â typhimurium A1-R arrested tumor growth all 4 models. In addition to arresting tumor growth in each case, S.Â typhimurium A1-R was significantly more efficacious than DOX in each case, thereby surpassing first-line therapy. These results suggest that S.Â typhimurium A1-R can be a general therapeutic for USTS and possibly sarcoma in general.

Material and Methods: Retrospective analysis of 6 cases, studied with CT and/or MRI in patients with retroperitoneal lipo sarcoma during the last 4 years at our institution. We analyzed symptoms, treatment and prognosis with special focus on the CT and MRI findings and their histological correlation. Results: the most frequent histological subtype in our group of patients was the pleomorphic lipo sarcoma (n=3). In the others cases, 2 were well differentiated and one was round-cell type. Retroperitoneal lipo sarcoma, especially the well differentiated, presented certain imaging patterns which allowed to suspect the subtype of tumor. Recurrences occurred in 50% (n=3). Mortality rate was 33.4% (n=2) (follow-up, 16 months). Conclusion: Both CT and MRI are methods which aid in the detection of this rare disorder, as well as in its diagnosis and follow-up.

While surgical resection is the primary treatment, the role of radiation therapy (RT) and chemotherapy remains unclear. This study aimed at defining prognostic factors and treatment strategies. Materials and methods: Data from 103 patients treated between 1976 and 2002 were collected. The median age was 55 years (range: 13-86); the median histological tumour size was 4.45 cm (range: 0.8-22). There were 42 angiosarcomas. Surgery consisted of wide excision in 34 cases, and total mastectomy in 69 cases. A total dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions was delivered in 50 patients. At the completion of treatment, 89 patients had no residual tumour. Results: After a median follow-up of 64 months, 56 patients developed recurrent disease: 38 presented a local relapse and 37 developed distant metastases. The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were 44% (95% confidence interval [CI], 39-49%) and 55% (95% CI, 50-60%), respectively. In multivariate analysis, favourable prognostic factors for better local control were: no residual tumour after treatment, no cellular pleomorphism, and histology other than angiosarcoma. For DFS, the five favourable prognostic factors were non-menopausal status, no residual tumour after treatment, non-angiosarcoma histology, absence of tumour necrosis, and grade 1-2 histology. Conclusion: While angiosarcoma has the worst prognosis, the outcome of the other types of sarcomas may be worsened by residual tumour after loco-regional treatment and high grade histology, a classical prognostic factor of the other soft tissue sarcomas.

Z.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nContext. Immunohistochemical stains for p53 are used as a diagnostic marker associated with malignancy in several histologic types of salivary gland tumors. This marker may be useful in differentiating pleomorphic adenoma (PA) from carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma (CPA), as these tumors are often difficult to distinguish on the basis of morphology alone. Objective. to evaluate whatever inactivation of tumor suppressor gene (p53) increases with the tumor progression from normal salivary tissue to PA and eventually CPA. Design. Paraffin blocks of 29 cases of PA, which were surrounded by normal parotid gland, and 27 cases of carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma were retrieved and validated. In all cases of carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma, a PA âghostâ was identified, and the malignant element was either undifferentiated carcinoma or adenocarcinoma. Results. The results showed negative nuclear expression of P53 in normal parotid gland. Nuclear P53 was expressed strongly in 6/29 (20.7%) pleomorphic salivary adenoma and 10/27 (37%) carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma. Conclusion. Our data suggest that inactivation of p53 may play an important role in the evolution of pleomorphic salivary adenoma and carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma.\n\nUterine sarcoma â current perspectives\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nBenson C\n\n2017-08-01\n\nFull Text Available Charlotte Benson,1 Aisha B Miah1,2 1Sarcoma Unit, Royal Marsden Hospital, 2Department of Radiotherapy and Imaging, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK Abstract: Uterine sarcomas comprise a group of rare tumors with differing tumor biology, natural history and response to treatment.

There were approximately 300 cases described in the literature as of 2006. All histologic types of sarcoma were described, and the most common intrathoracic types reported were angiosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, hemangiopericytoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma. The biological behavior of these tumors is not well-known due to their low frequency. Leiomyosarcomas represent one of the most common subtypes encountered in the lungs, and usually occur during the sixth decade, with male predominance. Although the frequency of metastatic disease is not related to tumor size, prognosis was reported to be poorer in high-grade tumors. In comparison with other sarcomas, survival after complete resection of pulmonary leiomyosarcoma was reported as longer. We report on a patient with primary leiomyosarcoma originating from the bronchus with complete resection and long-term follow-up.\n\nRare aggressive behavior of MDM2-amplified retroperitoneal dedifferentiated liposarcoma, with brain, lung and subcutaneous metastases\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nImen Ben Salha\n\n2016-10-01\n\nFull Text Available Dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDL is a histologically pleomorphic sarcoma, traditionally defined as well-differentiated liposarcoma with abrupt transition to high grade, nonlipogenic sarcoma. It can occur as part of recurrent well-differentiated liposarcoma, or may arise de novo. DDL most frequently occurs within the retroperitoneum, and while it is prone to local recurrence, it usually has a lower rate of metastasis than other pleomorphic sarcomas. We describe a case of retroperitoneal dedifferentiated liposarcoma in a 63-year-old male, who showed MDM2 amplification with fluorescence in situ hybridization, which displayed unusually aggressive behavior, with brain, lung and subcutaneous soft tissue metastases. As previous reports of metastatic liposarcoma have largely grouped DDL in with other (genetically and clinically distinct liposarcoma subtypes, we highlight and discuss the rare occurrence of brain metastasis in MDM2-amplified retroperitoneal liposarcoma.\n\nRadiological and pathological response following pre-operative radiotherapy for soft-tissue sarcoma\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nRoberge, David; Skamene, Tanya; Nahal, Ayoub; Turcotte, Robert E.; Powell, Tom; Freeman, Carolyn\n\n2010-01-01\n\nPurpose: To report radiological and pathological response to neo-adjuvant radiotherapy for extremity and trunk soft-tissue sarcomas. Materials/methods: Fifty patients were identified retrospectively. All patients had MRI imaging pre and post neo-adjuvant external beam radiotherapy. Tumor volumes were measured in 3D on T1 Gadolinium enhanced sequences. Pathological treatment response was quantified in terms of percentage of treatment-related necrosis for each case. Results: Histopathologic responses to treatment varied from 0% to 100%. The median pathological treatment response was 67.5% for low-grade sarcomas and 50% for high-grade sarcomas. The median decrease in tumor volume was 13.8% for non-myxoid low-grade sarcomas, 82.1% for myxoid liposarcomas and <1% for high-grade sarcomas. A partial response on MRI (volume reduction â¥ 50%) was highly predictive of a good pathological response (p < 0.001). Patients with stable disease on imaging or volumetric progression had wide ranging pathological responses. Conclusions: Soft-tissue sarcomas show significant pathological treatment responses in the form of hyaline fibrosis, necrosis and granulation tissue. Despite this, there is minimal early volumetric response to radiation, especially for high-grade tumors. Although radiological partial response was predictive of pathological response, the significance of radiological progression was unclear. Myxoid liposarcoma tumor type was predictive of both pathological and radiological tumor response.\n\nCarbon ion radiotherapy for localized primary sarcoma of the extremities: Results of a phase I/II trial\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSugahara, Shinji; Kamada, Tadashi; Imai, Reiko; Tsuji, Hiroshi; Kameda, Noriaki; Okada, Tohru; Tsujii, Hirohiko; Tatezaki, Shinichirou\n\n2012-01-01\n\nPurpose: To determine the effectiveness of carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) for localized primary sarcomas of the extremities in a prospective study. Patients and materials: From April 2000 to May 2010, 17 (male/female: 12/5) patients with localized primary sarcoma of the extremities received CIRT. The median age was 53 years (range: 14â87 years). Nine patients had primary diseases and eight had recurrent diseases. Of the 17 patients, eight refused amputation, and the remaining nine refused surgical resection. Tumors were located in the upper limbs in four patients and lower limbs in 13. Histological diagnosis was osteosarcoma in three patients, liposarcoma in two, synovial sarcoma in two, rhabdomyosarcoma in two, pleomorphic sarcoma in two, and miscellaneous in six. The CIRT dose to the limb was 52.8 GyE for one patient, 64 GyE for three, 70.4 GyE for 13 in 16 fixed fractions over 4 weeks. Records were reviewed and outcomes including radiologic response, local control (progression-free), and survival were analyzed. Results: The median follow-up was 37 months (range: 11â97 months). Radiological response rate was 65% (PR in 11, SD in 5, and PD in 1). The local control rate at 5 years was 76%. The overall survival rate at 5 years was 56%. Of the 17 patients, 10 survived without disease progression. Four patients had local recurrences, one was salvaged by repeated CIRT and the other three died due to systemic diseases. Distant failure was observed in six patients. One patient suffered from femoral fracture (grade 3) and received surgical fixation 27 months after CIRT. No other severe reactions (grade 3) were observed. Conclusions: CIRT is suggested to be an effective and safe treatment for patients who refuse surgery for localized primary sarcomas of the extremities.\n\nOsteogenic sarcoma of the prostate\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nNishiyama, Tsutomu; Terunuma, Masahiro [Koseiren Nagaoka Chuo General Hospital, Niigata (Japan); Ikarashi, Toshihiko; Ishizaki, Satoshi\n\n2001-04-01\n\nA 76-year-old man was treated with bilateral orchiectomy, estramustine phosphate and pelvic irradiation for prostate cancer. Osteogenic sarcoma of the prostate developed 18 months after the treatment. Postmortem examination revealed that the tumor was 8 cm in diameter and had infiltrated into the bladder and rectal walls and had resulted in peritoneal dissemination. There was no distant metastasis. Macroscopically, the tumor was ashen, firm and relatively homogenous and diffusely spread. Histologically, it was composed of spindle and pleomorphic cells, which were making osteoid with calcification. There was no ordinary tubular formation as shown in adenocarcinoma of the prostate. No positive immunostaining for prostate-specific antigen, epithelial membrane antigen and cytokeratin (AE-1, AE-3) were confirmed. Positive immunostaining for nonepithelial marker vimentin was confirmed. The ultimate diagnosis was osteogenic sarcoma of the prostate.

We retrospectively evaluated the activity of gemcitabine (G) plus docetaxel (D) in patients with relapsed high-grade osteosarcoma and high-grade spindle cell sarcoma of bone (HGS). Patients receiving G 900 mg/m(2) d 1, 8; D 75 mg/m(2) d 8, every 21 days were eligible. Primary end-point: progression-free survival (PFS) at 4 months; secondary end-point: overall survival (OS) and response rate. Fifty-one patients were included, with a median age of 17 years (8-71), 26 (51%) were pediatric patients. GD line of treatment: 2nd in 14 patients, â¥3rd in 37. 25 (49%) patients had metastases limited to lungs, 26 (51%) multiple sites. 40 (78%) osteosarcoma, 11 (22%) HGS. Eight (16%) patients achieved surgical complete response (sCR2) after GD. Four-month PFS rate was 46%, and significantly better for patients with ECOG 0 (ECOG 0: 54% vs ECOG 1: 43% vs ECOG 2: 0%; p = 0.003), for patients undergoing metastasectomy after GD (sCR2 75% vs no-sCR2 40 %, p = 0.02) and for osteosarcoma (osteosarcoma 56% vs HGS 18%; p = 0.05), with no differences according to age, line of treatment, and pattern of metastases. Forty-six cases had RECIST measurable disease: 6 (13%) patients had a partial response (PR), 20 (43%) had stable disease (SD) and 20 (43%) had progressive disease (PD). The 1-year OS was 30%: 67% for PR, 54% for SD and 20% for PD (p = 0.005). GD is an active treatment for relapsed high-grade osteosarcoma, especially for ECOG 0 patients, and should be included in the therapeutic armamentarium of metastatic osteosarcoma.\n\nGemcitabine and docetaxel in relapsed and unresectable high-grade osteosarcoma and spindle cell sarcoma of bone\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nPalmerini, E.; Jones, R.
