The city's reputation was forged as the powerhouse of the Industrial Revolution in Britain, a fact which led to Birmingham being known as \"the workshop of the world\" or the \"city of a thousand trades\"Decline of the city of a thousand trades (April 17, 2006) Birmingham Mail. It forms part of the larger West Midlands conurbation, which has a population of 2,284,093 (2001 census) and includes several neighbouring towns and cities, such as Solihull, Wolverhampton and the towns of the Black Country. There is a distinctive Brummie dialect and accent.\n\nBirmingham is an ethnically and culturally diverse city. At the time of the 2001 census, 70.4% of the population was White (including 3.2% Irish), 19.5% British Asian 6.1% Black or Black British, 0.5% Chinese, and 3.5% of mixed race or other ethnic heritage. In this time, it has grown from a tiny Anglo-Saxon farming village into a major industrial and commercial city.Origins of Birmingham Birmingham.gov.uk\n\nThe Birmingham area was occupied in Roman times, with several military roads and a large fort. It was first recorded in written documents by the Domesday Book of 1086 as a small village, worth only 20 shillings.\n\nIn the 12th century, Birmingham was granted a charter to hold a market, which in time became known as the Bull Ring. As a convenient location for trade, Birmingham soon developed into a small but thriving market town.\n\nBy the 16th century, Birmingham's access to supplies of iron ore and coal meant that metalworking industries became established. Birmingham manufacturers supplied Oliver Cromwell's forces with much of their weaponry during the English Civil War. Unlike many other English industrial cities such as Manchester, industry in Birmingham was based upon small workshops rather than large factories or mills.\n\nHistorical population of BirminghamHistoric Population Of Birmingham Population table Bham.de\n\nYear\n\nPopulation figure\n\n1538\n\n1,300\n\n1650\n\n5,472\n\n1700\n\n15,032\n\n1731\n\n23,286\n\n1778\n\n42,250\n\n1785\n\n52,250\n\n1801\n\n73,670\n\n1811\n\n85,753\n\n1821\n\n106,722\n\n1831\n\n146,986\n\n1841\n\n182,922\n\n1851\n\n232,638\n\n1861\n\n296,076\n\n1871\n\n343,787\n\n1881\n\n400,774\n\n1891\n\n478,113\n\n1901\n\n522,204\n\n1911\n\n840,202\n\n1912-1967\n\nRecords destroyed\n\n1968\n\n900,000\n\n.\n\nRailways arrived in Birmingham in 1837, with the opening of the Grand Junction Railway and later the London and Birmingham Railway the railways soon linked Birmingham to every corner of Britain. And this was soon followed by the Great Western Railway's Snow Hill stationBirmingham UK pages.\n\nIn the early 20th century Birmingham Corporation Tramways operated a tramway network which was the largest in the country to be constructed to the narrow gauge of 3'6\" rather than the more usual 4'8½\". It was linked with the tramways in Walsall, Wolverhampton and the Black Country.\n\nDuring the Victorian era, the population of Birmingham grew rapidly to well over half a millionHistoric Population Of Birmingham Birmingham.gov.uk and Birmingham became the second largest population centre in England and the third in Britain after Glasgow and then London. Birmingham's importance led to it being granted city status in 1889 by Queen Victoria.\n\nThe city built its own university in 1900, The University of Birmingham, which became the first of Britain's Redbrick universities.\n\nBirmingham was originally part of Warwickshire, however the city expanded in the late 19th and early 20th century, absorbing parts of Worcestershire to the south and Staffordshire to the west. The city absorbed Sutton Coldfield in 1974, and at the same time became part of the new West Midlands county.\n\nBirmingham suffered heavy bomb damage during World War II during the Birmingham Blitz, and partly as a result of this the city centre was extensively re-developed during the 1950s and 1960s, with many concrete office buildings, ring-roads, and now much-derided pedestrian subways. As a result, Birmingham gained a reputation for ugliness and was frequently described as a \"concrete jungle\"Tackling congestion in Birmingham (BBC News) Mentions Birmingham's nickname as concrete jungle .\n\nIn recent years however, Birmingham has been transformed, the city centre has been extensively renovated and restored with the construction of new squares, the restoration of old streets, buildings and canals, the removal of the pedestrian subways, and the demolition and subsequent redevelopment of the Bull Ring shopping centre, which now includes the architecturally unique Selfridges buildingMajor Development Birmingham.gov.uk.\n\nIn the decades following World War II, the face of Birmingham changed dramatically, with large scale immigration from the Commonwealth of Nations and beyondBirmingham's Post War Black Immigrants Birmingham.gov.uk.\n\nBirmingham's transition from an industrial centre to a tourism and services economy is best illustrated by the hosting of the first official summit of the G8 at the International Convention Centre (May 15 to May 17, 1998).

Attractions for visitors include Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery, Millennium Point, Bull Ring, Selfridges Building, Cadbury World, Tolkien Trail Tolkien's Birmingham www.virtualbrum.co.uk, Birmingham Royal Ballet, and the National Sea Life Centre.

The characteristic materials of Victorian Birmingham are red brick and terracotta, and many fine Victorian buildings have been retained on New Street and Corporation Street in the city centre. Across the city, the need to house the industrial workers gave rise to miles of redbrick streets and terraces, many of back-to-back houses, some of which were later to become inner-city slums.\n\nContinued population growth in the interwar period, saw vast estates of semi-detached houses being built on greenfield land in outlying parts of the city such as Kingstanding and Weoley Castle, but the coming of World War II and the Blitz claimed many lives and many beautiful buildings too. However, the destruction that took place in post-war Birmingham was also extensive: dozens of fine Victorian buildings like the intricate glass-roofed Birmingham New Street Station, and the old Central Library, were razed in the 1950s and 1960s and replaced with modernist concrete buildings. In inner-city areas too, much Victorian housing was redeveloped and existing communities were relocated to tower block estates like Castle Vale.\n\nThe planning decisions of the post-war years were to have a profound effect on the image of Birmingham in subsequent decades, with the mix of ring roads, shopping malls and tower blocks often referred to as a 'concrete jungle'. There has been a lot of new building in the city centre in recent years, including the award-winning Future Systems' Selfridges building, an irregularly-shaped structure covered in thousands of reflective discs (see picture), the Brindleyplace development and the Millennium Point science and technology centre.
