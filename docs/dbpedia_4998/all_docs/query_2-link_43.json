Originally the station only broadcasted on 95.8 FM in London (hence the name of the station), but it has since expanded to broadcast to many different areas of England, Scotland and Wales. It is branded as “The UK’s No.1 Hit Music Station”. Drivetime shows are local but other programming through the day and night is networked. Capital is also available nationally on DAB Block 11D in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, DAB Block 12A in Scotland andÂ the Channel Islands. Look for ‘Capital UK‘ or ‘Cap UK‘ on your radio display."
