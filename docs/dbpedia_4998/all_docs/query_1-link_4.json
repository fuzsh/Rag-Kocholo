        "text": "80sfan wrote:\n\nOf course listeners notice - you hear presenters openly announce where listeners' letters and calls are from and certainly with the Nottingham station, the whole emphasis is on serving \"The Great East Midlands\". Local accents, local towns and villages and local stories just add to the charm of the station\n\nI didn't say (or mean) that listeners never notice, I just think it may be much further down their list of priorities when chosing a radio station to listen to. National stations like BBC R2 wouldn't be so popular if listeners had localness at the top of their lists.\n\nI accept that listeners do vary and those in particular who opt for BBC locals may have that at the top of their agenda. However I'm not that sure listeners to many of the music based stations are as keen on localness as the stations seem to portray them.\n\nI know whenever a local or regional station is being advertised all the bidders emphasise how their service will be truly local (never understand the 'truly' bit) but isn't it stated because that's what Ofcom want to hear.\n\n0\n\nLes Wires wrote:\n\nNational stations like BBC R2 wouldn't be so popular if listeners had localness at the top of their lists.\n\nI'm always a bit wary when people start talking about what \"listeners\" want to hear. Surely some listeners like localness, and some listeners aren't bothered and they make their choices accordingly.\n\nAlso, Radio 2 isn't that popular. It has a national reach of 26%, which is about the same as BBC Radio Lincolnshire or GCap's 2CR. Lots of people on thse forums (and I'm not accusing you of this, Les) like to say that commercial radio should follow Radio 2's lead, beacuse it is so popular, but no-one ever seems to suggest that Radio 2 should follow 2CR's lead!\n\nThe Saga stations slogan has been \"Your life, your music\" by the way. I think that is a good indication of how important localness is in their make-up: \"Your life\" includes the local elements - news, travel and features etc, but \"Your music\" shows its is also a specialist station with a particular musical style.\n\n0\n\nBingethink wrote:\n\nI'm always a bit wary when people start talking about what \"listeners\" want to hear. Surely some listeners like localness, and some listeners aren't bothered and they make their choices accordingly.\n\nI take your point (and those of 80sfan and dpb) but in many cases listeners have no choice apart from local radio. As an example if I wanted to listen to 80-todays music while driving around the West Mids what would be my choice? Certainly not Radio1 or 2 but probably Mercia, Wyvern Beacon etc, this doesn't mean I want to hear what's going on locally. The same can be said for many other music genres. It is often assumed that listeners tune into local radio because of the localness when often there is no choice, they tune in for the music.\n\nOf course I am not saying all listeners are the same, it's just that I find the 'local' being overplayed. If the local element of a station was so important and this was the reason listeners tuned in would networking ever be considered. We all know most of the large companies would be delighted to increase networking if Ofcom allowed. They know the cost savings involved and they also know it wouldn't upset the listeners.\n\n0\n\nJRU wrote:\n\nSo which station do you want to work on...2CR or NATIONAL Radio Two!!!!\n\nEr..., neither?? (Didn't know it was actually a requirement of the site too be a wannabe radio DJ...)\n\nI know which audience I'd rather have!\n\nI think we can all count, and see that Radio 2 has more listeners than Radio Lincolnshire. But that doesn't mean that Radio 2 is more popular than local radio or commercial radio as many seem to conclude on here...\n\n0\n\nA real disapointment IMO, I was still hoping an agreement for the Saga name could be reached. I love the Saga name becuase it's exactly what it is: Radio targeted to the over 50s, and nobody else. Lets just hope the changes are more extensive than the name to Glasgow's best radio station.\n\nDid anyone catch the outgoing Managing (or Program?) Director on Dave Marshall's show on Saga 105.2 this morning? My phone battery went dead so unfortuantely I wasn't able to, wonder if they covered anything about the changes?\n\nThe simple things like using a Glasgow phone number (0845 for local radio?!) and not being afraid to remain Glasgow based whilst acknowleging their DAB listeners on the East, and those on the web, and always reading out local events information. It all contributes to a great local radio station, and I hope GMG don't forget any of the lessons from Saga.\n\n0\n\nTony Richards wrote:\n\nBasically London based Smooth is changing into a station for older listeners 50+ rather than 35 - 50 and will therefore need to change some presenters to suit the move away from Jazz and R n B type music.\n\nI'm guessing that's bye bye to Mike Chadwick and Rosie Kendrick as well as such shows like The Saturday Night Experience, The Late Lounge, The Dave Koz Radio Show and any other specialist jazz programme that probably won't get a chance to air on theJazz. I wonder if my predictions do come to pass, will it have an impact on jazzfm.com, because most of the Smooth FM presenters who could be culled from the station also contribute to jazzfm.com.\n\n0\n\nmike blair wrote:\n\nHope the Glasgow station keeps Mike\n\nMarwick's Rock 'n' Roll Saturday night!!\n\nThere is a similar show on Saga 106.6 East Midlands.\n\nnot to mention all the 60's and 70's rock that gets played everyday eg. Eagles Hotel- California,Pink Floyd-Brick in the wall,Tracks by Queen,Rolling Stones,Beatles,the Who etc.,\n\nIt will be interesting to see how they fit into the 'Smooth'\n\nlabel .\n\nUnless they are planning to down the 'Easy Listening' road and ignore what the listeners like:\n\nSaga 106.6 top 200 listeners choice\n\nAlso I hope they do not cut down the playlist and play the same songs over and over as ther local rivals do.\n\n0\n\ntghe-retford wrote:\n\nI'm guessing that's bye bye to Mike Chadwick and Rosie Kendrick as well as such shows like The Saturday Night Experience, The Late Lounge, The Dave Koz Radio Show and any other specialist jazz programme that probably won't get a chance to air on theJazz.

The overall musical character of the station will still be broadly drawn from Jazz, Soul, Blues and R&B, but would be broadened to allow the station to APPEAL TO AN OLDER AND UNDERSERVED audience.\" \"(their capital letters not mine!)\n\nand later they talk about\n\n\"our obligation to at least 45 hours of Jazz specialist programmes,\"\n\nwhen giving an example of their daytime playlist and also they say\n\n\"Other genres complementing the main music mix, such as new adult contemporary, big band, specialist soul and motown music may also feature in non daytime shows.\"\n\nhttp://www.ofcom.org.uk/consult/condocs/smooth/\n\n0"
