        "text": "A proposal to cut back peak-time news on BBC Scotland - which will include ending the channel's flagship news bulletin The Nine - has been approved by Ofcom.\n\nIn February, the BBC announced a raft of changes to news programming, which included replacing the hour-long Nine with a 30-minute news programme at 19:00 on the same channel and increased investment in online news.\n\nOfcom ruled that the changes were \"appropriate\" for the BBC's public purposes and that the corporation's wider plans \"have the potential to meet the changing needs of audiences in Scotland.\"\n\nThe media regulator stated it would continue to assess the changes once they take place and report back on them next year.\n\nBBC Scotland welcomed Ofcom's decision.\n\nThe Nine started broadcasting in February 2019 from an open-plan studio space on the third floor at BBC Scotland's Pacific Quay HQ in Glasgow.\n\nIt provides a mix of news from Scotland, the UK and around the world.\n\nHowever, attention on the programme in recent years has often focused on low viewing figures - leading MSPs to quiz BBC Scotland director Steve Carson on the matter.\n\nMr Carson said The Nine reached more than 100,000 viewers every week and Friday to Sunday bulletin The Seven - which will also be axed - reached more than 20,000.\n\nOfcom analysis found that The Nine's average audience had fallen year on year since 2020, to an average of about 10,000 in 2023.\n\nDuring the February announcement, Mr Carson said the changes would \"play to our strengths as an innovative broadcaster that delivers high-quality journalism to audiences across all our platforms\".\n\nAnnouncing its decision, external, Ofcom said: \"Having carefully considered the responses to our consultation, we have decided to approve the BBCâs request.\n\n\"We consider that the revised news quota is appropriate for requiring the BBC to fulfil its mission and promote its public purposes, and that the wider BBC plans have the potential to meet the changing needs of audiences in Scotland. We also consider the risk to fair and effective competition is low.\n\n\"The BBC must be transparent about how it is delivering for audiences in Scotland, and we will hold it to account. We expect the BBC to monitor the impact of the changes it has proposed and be ready to continue to adapt as necessary to meet audience needs.\n\n\"We will also monitor performance and will report on it in our annual report on the BBC next year.\""
