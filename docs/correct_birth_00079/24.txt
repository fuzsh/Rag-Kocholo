Tennis pro Samantha Stosur, of Tampa, is suing a pair of accountants she claims improperly filed her tax returns, leaving her with a bill of $4 million in fines and penalties owed to the Internal Revenue Service.

Stosur filed a lawsuit on Jan. 29 in Hillsborough County Circuit Court, seeking an undisclosed amount in fines from accountants Jay Hans and Francis J. Sands.

The lawsuit states that she began working with Hans, of Bradenton, in 2007. Hans then introduced her to New York accountant Sands in 2013 to help deal with an IRS audit of Stosur’s tax returns. That’s when Stosur said she realized that Hans was not a certified public accountant, court documents show.

Among the errors with Stosur’s returns was the failure to include foreign-asset tax forms on her behalf, along with multiple other tax returns being prepared incorrectly, the lawsuit stated. Stosur settled with the IRS in 2019 and she now owes the agency more than $4 million in penalties and fines.

Calls and text messages sent to a phone number that’s registered to Stosur were not returned Tuesday.

Property records show that Stosur lived in a Harbour Island condo from 2007 to 2019.

The Australian-born tennis pro has earned more than $19 million throughout her career, according to an online sports biography for Stosur. It also states she’s been ranked No. 4 in the world and is currently No. 33.

Stosur is currently competing at the Australian Open. She advanced to the tournament’s second round after a win Tuesday.
