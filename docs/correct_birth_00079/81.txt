Congratulations, Sam Stosur! The Australian became a mother for the first time.

Daughter Genevieve was born on June 16, as Stosur announced via Instagram.

Life in lockdown was a challenging time in many things, but personally one of the most exciting and happiest times of her life, said the 36-year-old. Her partner Liz gave birth to Genevieve, "It was a whirlwind, but we can no longer imagine life without her," continued the 2011 US Open winner. She couldn't wait to see what would happen if Evie grew up, even if it didn't hopefully happen too quickly.

Stosur, it seems, will remain active on the tennis tour. In 2010 she reached the final of the French Open, in 2011 she won the US Open in an emotional final against Serena Williams. 4th place is her highest position so far, but "Sammy" is currently only 97th.
