        "text": "earned a spot in tennis’ history books last fall when she won the U.S. Open, upsetting the heavily favored Serena Williams in a masterful final-round performance.\n\nThousands of tennis fans, maybe even millions, found the outcome deeply satisfying. After all, the Australian veteran is one of the most likeable and mature players on tour. And she has a hard-luck, overcoming-adversity storyline to boot, after beating Lyme disease a few years back. (Check out the video below to get a taste of Down Under’s down-to-earth Sam.)\n\nBut the big win also put her in the running for a dubious distinction -- that of the least accomplished Grand Slam champion of the Open era.*\n\nShe’s not the least accomplished player at the time of an unexpected major-title breakthrough. That would be Mats Wilander, whose very first tour-level championship came at Roland Garros in 1982. The U.S. Open was Stosur’s third career tour title.\n\nNo, we're talking over a whole career. Wilander was 17 when he first tasted Grand Slam glory. He would go on to win six more major titles and more than 30 singles championships total in his career.\n\nStosur, in contrast, is 28. She is probably entering the downward arc of her career. Watching her fall apart in tournament after tournament since Flushing Meadows makes one wonder if she’ll win another title of any sort before she’s done, let alone another major.\n\nAnd that’s not easy to deal with. The U.S. Open changed the dynamic for Stosur fans. Before, the talented but emotionally shaky Aussie was the WTA’s Chicago Cubs, women’s tennis’ loveable loser. This has been a valued slot on the tour roster for years, held by the likes of\n\n, Jana Novotna,\n\nand\n\n.\n\nBut then, as happened with Sabatina and (at the last possible moment) Novotna, Stosur broke through. And she did it by besting the best player of her generation in the final. Oh happy day!\n\nExcept, now that the euphoria has worn off, we’re not sure what to do with Slammin’ Sammy. She’s not a loveable loser anymore, and that means the pain of watching her try valiantly but come up short is no longer bittersweet. Now it’s just ugly.\n\nOur expectations are higher and our forgiveness lower. She’s a U.S. Open champion, so she should be mentally tough, right? She’s the buffest girl on tour (see video below), so she should be able to really paste her backhand, right?\n\nShoulda, coulda, woulda.\n\nClay always has been Stosur’s best surface, where her kick-ass kick serve bounds away like a frisky puppy and her heavy forehand pushes opponents back and back and back. So maybe she’ll get Tour Victory Number 4 this week in Charleston. And maybe that will put her head in the right place as we close in on the French Open.\n\nLet’s hope so. Because we can’t bear watching Sam lose anymore, but we don’t want to stop watching.\n\n--\n\n* Sure, you could bring up Chris O’Neil, who won the 1978 Australian Open, her first and only trophy as a touring pro, but that was when the championship Down Under was a major in name only, at best Tier III level in reality."
