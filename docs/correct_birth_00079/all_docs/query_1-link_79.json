        "text": "Australian veteran Sam Stosur will head to next week’s Australian Open without a win in almost five months after bombing out in the first round of the Sydney International.\n\nStosur looked badly out of touch in the first set and didn’t get any better as the match wore on, falling to a 6-3, 6-1 pummelling by world No27 Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in just over an hour.\n\nThe defeat now stretches the former US Open champion’s losing run to seven matches, dating all the way back to a second-round defeat at Flushing Meadows in September.\n\nIt also includes a disappointing first-round exit in her home Brisbane tournament last week, although she was much more competitive then in falling 7-5, 6-7 (2-7), 7-5 to world No7 Garbine Muguruza.\n\nThe 32-year-old won less than 50% of her points on serve and barely got a look at her Russian counterpart’s game, winning one of two break points.\n\nEarlier on day two, late Australian entrant Arina Rodionova became the first local hope to fall in Homebush after losing her opening match to sixth seed Johanna Konta.\n\nThe world No184-ranked Rodionova had a number of opportunities to break the top-ranked British player but converted on just two of eight to eventually fall 6-3, 6-4.\n\nIn the men’s draw, Australian qualifier Matthew Barton claimed the second biggest scalp of his career, edging British No2 Kyle Edmund.\n\nRanked 153 places below the world No45, Barton went game for game with Edmund for the entire match but earned his 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (7-5) win with timely points in both tiebreakers.\n\nHe will now face either Gilles Muller or Alexandr Dolgopolov in the second round.\n\nThe Sydney-born Barton made headlines last year after progressing to the second round of his grand slam debut at Wimbledon, and also beat then-world No32 Steve Johnson in Auckland.\n\nBarton is one of five Australians in the field at Homebush, including Thanasi Kokkinakis, Christopher O’Connell, Jordan Thompson and Alex de Minaur."
