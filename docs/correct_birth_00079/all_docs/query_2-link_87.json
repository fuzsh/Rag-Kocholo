        "text": "A powerful Queenslander with biceps the size of melons, Stosur overpowered Williams in New York with a magnificent display of aggressive tennis. Yet since returning to Australian soil for the start of the 2012 season, she has gone from Superwoman to Claire Kent.\n\nHer 7-6, 6-3 first-round defeat in Melbourne, against world No59 Sorana Cirstea, from Romania, was not wholly a surprise given that she had lost two of her three previous matches this year. Indeed it was all but predicted last Friday by John McEnroe, who told the audience at the draw ceremony that “right now, she’s reminding me of some of the players who have been overwhelmed by the pressure, like [Amelie] Mauresmo at the French Open”.\n\nAfter breaking serve in the first game of the match, Stosur found herself becalmed, playing steady but uninspiring tennis while her opponent went for daring winners at every opportunity and pulled a high proportion of them off.\n\nCirstea took the first set on a tie-break, and then showed that she was in for the long haul by breaking Stosur to love in the next game. After a few more twists and turns, the Romanian clinched the deal after 91 minutes of agony for the fans on Rod Laver Arena.\n\n“Probably the whole country hates me right now,” Cirstea said afterwards. “Probably when they wake up tomorrow they’ll feel better about me.\n\nFor Stosur, this was a crushing comedown, and she did not dispute that her own feelings of anxiety had contributed to the loss. “There’s not any other word for it but a total disappointment,” she said. “I really, really wanted to do well here and over the summer. For sure it affects you physically, that’s probably the easiest sign for the outside people to see. You tighten up, your shoulders do get tight, you don’t hit through the ball.”\n\nThe wastage rate among the Australian women at this tournament has been high. Out of the nine who started the first round, three have made it into the second, and it is a safe bet — when you look at their opponents — that none will reach the third. The parallels with British players at Wimbledon are hard to avoid.\n\nOn the men’s side, the statistics have been a little better, with four survivors from seven entrants. One of those was Bernard Tomic, who thrilled everyone with his five-set win over Fernando Verdasco on Monday afternoon.\n\nAnd another, late on Tuesday night, was the lion-hearted Lleyton Hewitt.\n\nPlaying Cedrik-Marcel Stebe of Germany, Hewitt needed fully four hours to come through 7-5, 4-6, 6-3, 7-5, thanks to a fist-pumping, vein-popping fourth-set comeback. All of which meant that a disgruntled Serena Williams had to start her own match against Tamira Paszek at just after 11pm.\n\n“At least when you start at 7pm you know when you’re going to be on,” said Hewitt, who was scheduled first in the evening session.\n\n“I don’t really want to have too many of the [Marcos] Baghdatis matches again,” he added, in reference to the infamous 2008 match that finished at 4.34am. “You go home and McDonald’s is already open on the way home for breakfast. The girls can do that for a change.”"
