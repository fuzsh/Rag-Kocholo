On the 16th of June, my partner Liz gave birth to our beautiful little girl, Genevieve. It has been a whirlwind time but we could not imagine life without her now. Mum and Evie are doing well and it‚Äôs so amazing to be home with them both. We are absolutely in love with this little bundle and rolling with the happy chaos. We can‚Äôt wait for what‚Äôs to come and to watch little Evie grow up....Although not too quickly we hope! üëßüèªü•∞‚ù§Ô∏è #babygirl #homecourt #wta #tennisaustralia #family\n\nA post shared by Samantha Stosur (@samstosur) on"
