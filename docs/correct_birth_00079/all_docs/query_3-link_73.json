It has been a whirlwind time but we could not imagine life without her now.\n\n\"We are absolutely in love with this little bundle and rolling with the happy chaos. We can't wait for what's to come and to watch little Evie grow up â€¦ Although not too quickly we hope!\"\n\nAmong the first to congratulate the couple was Tennis Australia who said: \"Congratulations Sam and Liz on the safe arrival of beautiful Evie, with love from the tennis family.\"\n\nAsic Tennis commented: \"Congratulations Sam!\"\n\nNext up it was the Australian Open's official Instagram account sharing their congratulations with the post: \"Major congrats!
