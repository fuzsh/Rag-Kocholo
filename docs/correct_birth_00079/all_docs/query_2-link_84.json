        "text": "New tennis mum Samantha Stosur has dismissed talk of retirement, instead hoping her new-found family bliss may even prolong her career.\n\nAustralia’s former US Open champion has decided to take the rest of 2020 off to savour the joys of motherhood after her partner - former Fed Cup physical therapist Liz Astling - gave birth to the couple’s first child, daughter Evie, last month.\n\nBut the one-time world No.4 now, ranked 97th, is vowing to play on for at least another year.\n\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\n\nThose who know her best say Stosur has never looked happier, or more relaxed, and the 36-year-old hopes off-court contentment translates to more on-court successes - and perhaps an Indian summer to put the exclamation mark on a truly distinguished career.\n\n“Many players have done this same thing and I think the resounding comment is ‘I actually played better and I enjoy it’ and you come off the court and you don’t worry about whether that was a bad loss, or whatever happened on court,” Stosur told Tennis Australia.\n\n“You go out there and all that matters is being with them. I think that’s certainly going to be the case for me.\n\n“Probably help relax me a little bit more as well because there is something bigger and essentially more important than that one tennis match that you’ve just played.\n\n“It’s making sure that they’re okay and you want to be with them.\n\n“I’m actually looking forward to that prospect and being able to play, do my job, come home or if we’re on the road travelling, and enjoy those moments with her because I think that’s something that’s going to be very special.”\n\nStosur says motherhood is “absolutely amazing” and plans to cherish her daughter’s early milestones before returning to her day job next year.\n\n“I could not have imagined it would be this incredible. She’s just an absolute gem,” she said.\n\nThe lightbulb moment\n\nStosur’s belated announcement of Evie’s birth surprised fans who had no idea the tennis player was about to become a mother.\n\nSome even learned only then of the intensely private Stosur’s relationship with Liz, having previously only made a subtle reference after the 2019 Newcombe Medal night.\n\n“To my Mum, Dad, Daniel and Dom and my partner Liz, you have given me the love, support and every opportunity to pursue my dream and I’ll be forever grateful,” Stosur wrote then.\n\nWith that, the tennis veteran was no longer afraid to hide who she is - Evie’s birth following the lightbulb moment last December.\n\n“I was standing up on stage, and talking and talking and thanking all these people, and I got off and I remember walking to the car park afterwards and something just didn’t feel right,” Stosur said this week.\n\n“Because I thanked all these people who were obviously very, very important to me, but not my partner. And she is a huge part of what I’ve been able to do, and who I am now, and everything. That just didn’t sit well with me.\n\n“I thought, you know what, bugger this - I want to thank her, and I want to do this. That’s why I put it on Instagram. I’ve got older, I’m more mature, you kind of reflect more, think about things and thought, ‘well, you know what, this is who I am’.\n\n“All my friends know, my family, anyone who knows me knows who I am and be proud of that. There’s nothing to worry about. And now I’ve got a daughter and I want to share that experience. It’s just been a progression through time.”\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nTriumphant over the great Serena Williams in the 2011 Flushing Meadows final, Stosur is Australia’s first big name to formally announce she won’t be contesting this year’s US Open.\n\nBut she may not be the last, with world No.1 Ashleigh Barty having expressed concerns about the New York grand slam going ahead as scheduled from August 31 despite the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nNick Kyrgios says the USTA is being “selfish” for pressing ahead with the Open, while 2018 quarter-finalist John Millman is another doubtful starter.\n\n“With the schedule coming up, with COVID, with quarantine and with all the other things that you’re going to have to deal with, I’ve decided that I’m going to take the rest of the year off,” Stosur said in her first interview since becoming a mum.\n\n“I’m going to stay here, enjoy being with my family, go through all those little milestones that Evie is going to have in the next six months and just really enjoy being home.”\n\n- with 7NEWS"
