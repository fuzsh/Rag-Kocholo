        "text": "2011 US Open champion, Samantha Stosur is set to retire from tennis after the 2023 edition of the Australian Open. The 38-year-old Australian star will play women’s doubles with Alize Cornet in her final tournament of her career.\n\nBack in 2002, Stosur made her debut in the hard-court tournament at Melbourne. Her best performance in the Australian Open came when she advanced to the quarterfinals back in 2006 and 2010.\n\n\"It was always going to be a hard decision whenever it did come to this point. Like I said last year when I stopped playing singles, I always wanted to finish here in Australia. Last year I wasn't ready to finish everything,” Stosur was quoted as saying.\n\n\"It just felt right to call it a day here, my home Grand Slam where obviously I have huge support and friends and family, lots of people here. It's certainly been a tough decision, but I think it was the right one,\" she added.\n\nStosur also played in the final of the 2010 French Open where she lost 6–4, 7–6(7–2) to Francesca Schiavone. In 2011, she defeated the mighty Serena Williams to win the US Open and, in the same year, achieved her career-best ranking of No.4.\n\nAfter beating Serena, Stosur also became the first Australian woman to win a Grand Slam major since 1980 when Evonne Goolagong won the Wimbledon.\n\nIn doubles, Stosur won the Wimbledon three times, in 2008, 2009 and 2011. She also achieved the No.1 doubles ranking back in February 2006. She finished with nine and 28 singles and doubles titles in her illustrious career."
