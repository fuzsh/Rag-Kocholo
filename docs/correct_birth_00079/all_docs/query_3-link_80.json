        "text": "SAM STOSUR has shown off her new baby Evie - and she says she is an \"absolute gem\".\n\nThe tennis star, 36, and partner Liz Astline posted a video of the little nipper, whose full name is Genevieve.\n\nFormer world No4 Stosur was pleased as punch with Evie.\n\nThe Australian ace, who has been world No1 in the women's doubles, welcomed her new addition on June 16.\n\nStosur said it still “feels weird” to talk about having a daughter of her own.\n\nShe told Australia's Channel 9: “Just very, very happy and excited, and just very proud to have little Evie here.\n\n“Still seems a little bit weird to say she’s my daughter. But I’ll get used to that. It’s just absolutely amazing.\n\n“She’s just an absolute gem, and even the tougher times don’t seem so bad when you just look at her little face and you just want to cuddle her and hold her all day long.”\n\nEvie was born in hospital near the couple's Melbourne home.\n\nDespite parts of Victoria being in lockdown due to the coronavirus, there were no complications.\n\nStosur said she and she and Liz, previously a physical therapist for the Australian Fed Cup team, were “absolutely in love” with their bundle of joy and “rolling with the happy chaos” of having their first child.\n\nShe posted on social media: \"Life in lockdown during coronavirus has been challenging in many ways but personally it’s been one of the most exciting and happy times of my life.\n\n“On the 16th of June, my partner Liz gave birth to our beautiful little girl, Genevieve.\n\n\"It has been a whirlwind time but we could not imagine life without her now.\n\n\"We are absolutely in love with this little bundle and rolling with the happy chaos.\n\n\"We can’t wait for what’s to come and to watch little Evie grow up … Although not too quickly we hope!”\n\nStosur will resume her tennis career next year."
