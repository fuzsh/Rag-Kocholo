        "text": "Australian tennis star Sam Stosur has been a mum for just over one month, but the talented sports person said motherhood has been “absolutely amazing” and she’s so in love with her little bundle of joy.\n\nEarlier this month the 36-year-old made the exciting announcement on social media that her partner Liz Astling had given birth to their first child together – Genevieve – or Evie for short. The country was thrilled for the pair, who have been managing life with a new born and the coronavirus outbreak together.\n\nNow, after settling into her role as a mum, Stosur has shed some light on how they’re coping with their gorgeous baby girl. Speaking to The Courier Mail this week, the tennis great said she “could have not have imagined it would be this incredible”.\n\nStosur said Evie is an “absolute gem” and her beautiful little face makes up for those tougher times when they’re awake at all hours of the night. However, she explained there is some learning to do and like many other mothers she and Liz are experiencing some serious loss of sleep.\n\n“I’ve obviously learned a lot about babies in the last little while,” Stosur told The Courier Mail. “I didn’t know that they would lose weight after birth and that it would be such a struggle to make sure that they put it back on.\n\n“And sleep, obviously. I’m lucky that I get to sleep through the night a little bit more, but there’s certainly been quite a few days where you get up and you’re like, ‘ooh geez, this is going to be a rough one’.”\n\nStosur added: “But, all in all, she’s pretty good We’ve just got to try and move that sleeping pattern to the night time rather than the early evening. I know that’ll come in time.”\n\nStosur’s insight into her life as a new parent comes just over a week after she first made the announcement that she had become a mother. The former world number one shared the exciting news via social media, revealing that she and Liz welcomed baby Genevieve into the world on June 16. She shared the news alongside a sweet image of the pair cradling their baby girl.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CCk1_ggFoq9/?utm_source=ig_embed\n\n“Life in lockdown during coronavirus has been challenging in many ways, but personally it’s been one of the most exciting and happy times of my life,” the tennis star wrote. “On the 16th of June, my partner Liz gave birth to our beautiful little girl, Genevieve. It has been a whirlwind time but we could not imagine life without her now.\n\n“Mum and Evie are doing well and it’s so amazing to be home with them both. We are absolutely in love with this little bundle and rolling with the happy chaos. We can’t wait for what’s to come and to watch little Evie grow up… Although not too quickly we hope!”"
