        "text": "BRISBANE, Australia â€” Russian-born Daria Gavrilova will represent Australia in Fed Cup for the first time, joining Sam Stosur in the home team against the United States in the April 16-17 World Group qualifier.\n\nTennis Australia on Wednesday said the team would also include another Russian-born player, Arina Rodionova, and doubles specialist Casey Dellacqua.\n\nThe matches will be played on a specially-installed clay court at Pat Rafter Arena in Brisbane.\n\nDespite receiving her Australian citizenship in November, Gavrilova had been blocked due to a new International Tennis Federation rule which required players to be citizens for at least two years before representing another country.\n\nGavrilova appealed against the ruling because she was already eligible to play for Australia when the new regulations were announced last year."
