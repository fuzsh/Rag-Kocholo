        "text": "The US Open women’s final five years ago today has become as famous for another of Serena Williams’ Flushing Meadows meltdowns as it has for Samantha Stosur’s upset win.\n\nThe Australian claimed a straight sets (6-2, 6-3) victory in New York over Williams, who was infuriated by a “hindrance call” given against her in the second game of the second set.\n\nShe erupted at umpire Eva Asderaki after being penalised for shouting out “Come on” in the middle of the point. It went to Stosur who broke to lead 2-1.\n\nWilliams yelled “Don’t even look at me, You’re a hater. You’re very unattractive inside.”\n\nIt came two years after another Big Apple bust up for which she was fined £82,500.\n\nOther memorable events to happen on this day\n\n1895: FA Cup trophy is stolen from a shop window in Birmingham.\n\n1985: Sri Lanka beat India by 149 runs for maiden Test cricket win.\n\n1998: 1998 Commonwealth Games opening ceremony in Kuala Lumpur, with Malaysia the first Asian country to host the games.\n\n2005: The US regain Solheim Cup from Europe with a 15½-12½ win at Crooked Stick, Indiana."
