        "text": "The Brisbane born and bred player has returned to the Sunshine State after two-and-a-half months away.\n\nIt was a slow start to the season for Stosur, who crashed out of in the first round of the Brisbane International and Australian Open in the women's singles.\n\nHowever, she's had a standout doubles season so far in 2019 which includes winning the Australian Open doubles title and reaching the Miami Open doubles final with partner Zhang Shuai.\n\nThe title in Melbourne was her third Grand Slam doubles title with the 35-year-old only missing one from Wimbledon.\n\n“I’m playing pretty well at the moment and there are always things to be working on, which I’m constantly doing, and you’re trying to bring that out into these matches,” she said.\n\n“I think in a scenario like Fed Cup, it can certainly bring out the best in me – I’ve had some really good wins in Fed Cup and always enjoy the experience.\n\n“If I’m called on to play, I’ll certainly be really enjoying that moment and trying to make the most of that opportunity.”\n\nStosur will be an invaluable member of Australia's Fed Cup team, having one of the best records of any player to wear the green and gold.\n\nSince her debut in 2003, she has won 29 singles matches and has a perfect 7-0 in doubles rubbers, helping contribute to a combined Fed Cup win-loss record of 36-18.\n\nWhile the match in Brisbane is the first in three years, it's not a happy hunting ground for the Australians, having lost their last two Fed Cup ties to the United States and Germany.\n\nStosur is hoping it is \"third time lucky\" for the team but she knows how tough Belarus will be.\n\n“They’re a very good team, they’ve got many players in the top 60,\" she said.\n\n\"Azarenka a past Grand Slam champion a couple of times so there’s really a lot of depth in their side but I think on paper, looking at rankings to rankings, we’re actually pretty even.\n\n\"I think it’s going to be really hard to split us apart. It’s gonna be a tough weekend for both of us.\n\n“We’re definitely gonna have to play our best tennis to try and get through.”\n\nAustralia's Fed Cup semi-final tie against Belarus will be played at Pat Rafter Arena from April 20-21."
