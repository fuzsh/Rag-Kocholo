        "text": "The circumstances of 2020 meant the vast majority of pro tennis players had a large break from the game. It wasn’t planned, it wasn’t necessarily foreseen and it’s had different consequences.\n\nFor Australian veteran Samantha Stosur, playing the Australian Open for a 19th time, the break between events has acted as a form of “refresh” after years of grind on the tour.\n\n“That’s certainly the way I tried to look at it. Yeah, I kind of thought, OK, well, this is the way it is,” said 36-year-old Stosur after breaking her first-round hoodoo at Melbourne Park.\n\n“Take it as a break, refresh, feel good and healthy in your body again.”\n\nStosur is one of 12 Australians through to the second round - the most since 1992 when the host nation was represented by 15 players - but it was the Queenslander’s name in the winning column on Tuesday that had particular significance.\n\nMelbourne has hardly been the happiest hunting ground for the 2011 US Open champion, her win against young countrywoman Destanee Aiava giving Stosur a slight positive record (19-18) in Australian Open singles matches going back 20 years.\n\nStosur hadn’t won a first round match since 2015. When asked, yes, Stosur was aware of the record. But only because tennis scribes, as they can be inclined, had referenced it.\n\n“I didn’t know, but then I read something about it from one of you guys so then I knew,” Stosur said, smiling.\n\nLoading\n\n“It wasn’t like, ‘Oh, my god, it’s been this long or anything going into the match’.\n\n“It’s just a nice feeling to get a win on the board again. Yeah, [to] be into the second round.“\n\nCrowds at Melbourne Park are well down on previous years - for a combination of reasons. Stosur certainly noticed the difference, having beaten Aiava on one of Melbourne’s Park’s three main roofed stadiums.\n\n“Oh, it definitely felt very different out there, especially in a big stadium like John Cain Arena. I don’t even know what it was, barely full,” she said.\n\nLoading\n\n“It does feel different in a big stadium when it’s like that. Unfortunately that’s just the way it has to be at the moment.”\n\nWhen the pandemic struck last year Stosur stopped playing and took a more substantial break when her partner Liz gave birth to their daughter Genevieve.\n\n“Didn’t hit a ball for two-and-a-half months when my daughter was born, and then started hitting a little bit kind of September,” Stosur explained.\n\n“The last couple of months was in full, you know, normal pre-season kind of training. So it’s a steady, slow progression after many, many weeks off that I haven’t had for a very long time.\n\n“It was certainly a very different year for me, but, you know, an exciting one, as well.”\n\nLoading\n\nLike many women’s players who returned to tour commitments in Australia, there has been an element of readjusting to the grind in the early days of 2021.\n\nStosur noticed a real challenge playing in match-like conditions, against others who’d had match experience at the US Open and French Open.\n\n“Playing competitive tennis, it’s not easy to, you know, step out on court and play those first matches sometimes. That’s kind of the way I ended up looking at it last week was kind of blowing the cobwebs out and doing that,” she said.\n\n“There were certainly some times through the preseason when you start playing points again after such a long time. It was hard against all the girls who just played French and US Open and all that.\n\n“It wasn’t always a good feeling losing set after set, but knew that, ‘OK, I’ve still got another month to play until it really matters’.\n\n“And that’s kind of the steady progression that I was able to give myself I guess, knowing that you’ve got so much time not to kind of burn yourself out and go too hard too early.”"
