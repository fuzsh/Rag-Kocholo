Uses a special last for competition-type court movement. A one-piece resin reinforce covers the area from the heel to the side in order to improve heel stability and minimize slippage between the foot and shoe when landing. In particular, the inner heel reinforcing material is large, providing a strong grip during reversal and allowing quick shifting to the next movement. The front upper is a radial form and features rubber and mesh (Flexion Fit). Pressure on the material is dispersed by creating multiple shallow folds during turns and delivering a supple, superior fit for the foot. The shoe sole is designed with three ovals in the front portion, including the ball of the foot, to concentrate strength and make gripping easier. The midsole of the women’s shoe, has been made more flexible for stepping.\n\n＊Details also available at asics.com\n\nPlease direct any questions regarding this release to:\n\nMedia:\n\nASICS Public Relations Team\n\npr@asics.co.jp"
