        "text": "Australian tennis player Sam Stosur has revealed that her partner Liz has given birth to a baby girl, Genevieve.\n\n\"Life in lockdown during coronavirus has been challenging in many ways but personally it’s been one of the most exciting and happy times of my life,\" Stosur wrote on Instagram.\n\n\"On the 16th of June, my partner Liz gave birth to our beautiful little girl, Genevieve. It has been a whirlwind time but we could not imagine life without her now.\n\n\"Mum and Evie are doing well and it’s so amazing to be home with them both. We are absolutely in love with this little bundle and rolling with the happy chaos. We can’t wait for what’s to come and to watch little Evie grow up....Although not too quickly we hope.\"\n\nStosur, 36, is yet to indicate whether she will travel to compete at the US Open. The New York tournament is scheduled to begin on August 31 and is to be followed by the French Open in September. Wimbledon was cancelled.\n\nSeveral Australian players have expressed concern about going to New York amid the US's escalating COVID-19 crisis.\n\nStosur won the US Open in 2011, defeating Serena Williams in straight sets.\n\nShe has slipped to No.97 in the world rankings and is reported to have ambitions to compete at a fifth Olympics in Tokyo next year."
