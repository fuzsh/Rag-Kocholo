        "text": "When it was suggested light-heartedly to Sam Stosur that an all-Australian final between her and world No.1 Ashleigh Barty could be on the cards, she let out a laugh.\n\n\"Put it on the back page,\" Stosur grinned.\n\nMORE: All the scores from Day 2 at AO 2022\n\nThat might not happen, but Stosur isn't ready to say goodbye to her singles career just yet after a 6-7(5) 6-3 6-3 win over Grand Slam debutante Robin Anderson at Australian Open 2022 on Tuesday.\n\nTo prepare for the pair's first meeting, Stosur visited YouTube to do some scouting but admitted \"there wasn't a whole lot out there.\"\n\nThere were a whole lot of Stosur aces, 12, and she saved seven of nine break points against the former UCLA standout — including in her opening service games of the second and third sets. Pivotal.\n\nMORE: AO 2022 women's singles draw\n\nA packed Kia Arena roared in unison when Stosur's short, precise backhand volley befuddled Anderson on match point. Moments later, Stosur, donning her trademark visor and sunglasses, threw her towel into the stands in jubilation.\n\nThe 2011 US Open champion and mum to 19-month-old Evie announced in late December that the Australian Open would mark her singles farewell, although she'll continue to contest doubles this season alongside Zhang Shuai. Together, the good mates triumphed in Melbourne in 2019 and US Open last year.\n\nIf possible, the 37-year-old hopes to travel with her family on tour in what would be a memorable road trip.\n\nThere is still work to be done at home for the Brisbane-born Stosur, who is making her 20th appearance in the main draw at her home major.\n\nStosur has never quite cracked the code in Melbourne compared to her successes in New York and Roland Garros — reaching a pair of fourth rounds in 2006 and 2010 — but is playing with a freedom that comes with knowing the end is near.\n\n\"It's sort of easier because, yeah, it's kind of like this is your last chance,\" said the wildcard ranked 487.\n\n\"You don't do it now, you're never going to have another opportunity to do it. Kind of like back's against the wall, this is it.\n\n\"It's probably a bit easier because I've been wanting to try to find that in my tennis for a couple of years now. I think when you're kind of chasing something, even though it's not about that, it's always in the back of your mind, 'got to do well here, your ranking is not going in the right direction', all that sort of stuff, it doesn't always allow that to happen.\n\n\"I feel like the last month or so, since I decided this is what I wanted to do, I've kind of found that. I actually think I'm hitting the ball really well, really clean. Probably some of the best striking I've done for a little while.\n\n\"Whatever the case, it's a nice place to feel.\"\n\nStanding in her way to a first third-round place at the Australian Open since 2014 is familiar foe and occasional doubles partner Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova.\n\nStosur leads the head-to-head against last year's French Open finalist 5-4, claiming the last two, both on clay.\n\n\"Obviously it's going to be a tough one, no doubt,\" said Stosur.\n\n\"She's still one of the best players in the world, had a great year last year. It's the second round. I can go out there and have some fun again.\""
