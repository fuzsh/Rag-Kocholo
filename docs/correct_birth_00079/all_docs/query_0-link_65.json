        "text": "Australia’s leading hopes at the Brisbane International, Samantha Stosur and Bernard Tomic, have both received unfriendly draws to start their 2017 season.\n\nSeemingly jinxed at her home tournament where she has annually disappointed, Stosur will again be under immense pressure after drawing world No7 Garbine Muguruza in the first round.\n\nIt will be a replay of their French Open semi-final where the Spaniard beat the Queenslander before going on to upset Serena Williams in the final at Roland Garros.\n\nMuguruza enters the first tournament of the Australian summer as the fourth seed, while Stosur, ranked world No21, is unseeded in a high-quality field which features five top-10 players.\n\nThe victor would set themselves on path for a likely quarter-final against world No9 Svetlana Kutznetsova.\n\nThe other Australian in the 30-strong women’s draw, comeback kid Ashleigh Barty, will play a qualifier but victory would pit her against world No1 Angelique Kerber in the second round.\n\nTomic will lead a charge of three Australians in the men’s field, which also features five from the top 10, but must be on song from the start after drawing eighth-seeded Spaniard David Ferrer.\n\nFerrer, the 2013 French Open finalist, would start slight favourite but the Gold Coast-born local has a fine record in Brisbane where he made the semi-finals earlier this year before falling to eventual champion Milos Raonic.\n\nCanadian world No3 Raonic is back as the No1 seed and is on track to meet drawcard Rafael Nadal in the quarter-finals.\n\nNadal, who is currently playing impressively in Abu Dhabi, has a tricky opening encounter with heavy-hitting Ukrainian Alexandr Dolgopolov.\n\nIf world No26 Tomic prevails over Ferrer he could set up an all-Australian second-round match with wildcard Jordan Thompson who has drawn Swede Elias Ymer first.\n\nFellow wildcard and Olympian Sam Groth will play Frenchamn Pierre-Hughes Herbert in his opening round clash where victory would see him play fourth seed Dominic Thiem.\n\nSecond-seed Stan Wawrinka is drawn to meet either Victor Troiki or a qualifier in the second round."
