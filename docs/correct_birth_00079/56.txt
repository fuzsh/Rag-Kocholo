March 30, 1984

Early days

Samantha Stosur was born in Brisbane, Australia on March 30, 1984. The family moved to Adelaide when she was six, after the family house and business on the Gold Coast were destroyed by a flood. She was given a tennis racquet for Christmas at the age of eight, and started hitting balls with her brother Daniel, who convinced their parents to give her tennis lessons.

Late 1990s

Getting serious

Stosur heads off to the World Cup in Jakarta at the age of 13 and joins the Queensland Academy of Sport under coach Geoff Masters at the age of 14. She turns pro in 1999, and two years later she joins the Australian Institute of Sport's tennis program. She begins working with coach Craig Morris.

In the doubles she finished runner-up at the 2006 Australian Open and won the French Open doubles with Raymond the same year, to reach the number one ranking.

She reached the fourth round in the singles at the Australian Open that year, losing to Martina Hingis. She finished off the year ranked number 29 in singles.

Stosur switched her focus to singles in 2009 and reached two finals, winning her maiden title in Osaka. She made the third round at the Australian Open and the semis at the French Open.

2010

Rise continues

She beat three former world number ones, including Serena Williams, to reach the 2010 French Open final, her first grand slam final appearance. But she lost to Francesca Schiavone of Italy 4–6, 6–7. Stosur and Schiavone both went on to lose in the first round at Wimbledon that year.

September 2011

Grand Slam success

Stosur beat Serena Williams 6-2 6-3 in the US Open final at Flushing Meadows to clinch her first singles grand slam title. She became the first Australian woman to win the US Open title since Margaret Court in 1973.

The last Australian woman to win any grand slam was Evonne Goolagong-Cawley at Wimbledon in 1980. The last man was Lleyton Hewitt at Wimbledon in 2002.
