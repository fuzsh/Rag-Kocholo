A former Tamil MP and pro-rebel newspaper chief has been killed in northern Sri Lanka, police say.

Sinnathamby Sivamaharajah was found shot dead on Sunday night outside his home in the Jaffna area.

He was a member of the Tamil National Alliance which is linked to the Tamil Tigers. It is not clear who killed him.

His death is the latest in a spate of killings this year in Sri Lanka. It comes amid recent heavy fighting between troops and Tamil Tiger rebels.
