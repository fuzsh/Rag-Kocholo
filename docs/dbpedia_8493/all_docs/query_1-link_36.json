        "text": "The students uprising in Tamilnadu occurred after a long period for a social issue. The uprising created an enthusiastic journey for the long-term freedom struggle of Eelam; even, it created many shock waves in the Indian political Status. At present, Many revolutions in many countries erupted against the corrupted social and political administration, in this context, this students uprising getting more importance in the global geo-political moves. The uprising not only erupted by the offensive war actions of Sri Lanka; it fundamentally caused by intrigue Neo-Imperialist offensive actions of the dominant world powers. The uprising arising after four years of the Tamil massacre in Eelam and, it reflected the failure of the global nation building and it justice systems. However, unexpected the students protests failed to achieve the goals and justice for the 2009 Tamil genocide at Mullivaaykkaal in Eelam. Although, the uprising brought the global communityâ€™s attention on the Eelam liberation struggle.\n\n'One man's revolutionary is another man's terrorist.' Madras Cafe,2013. The essay highlights the honour, progressiveness and also false representation of the 'Tamilian Identity' in the Contemporary World Politics and also the Indian Sub-Continent. The essay does not only uphold the struggle of the LTTE as ' a just revolution' in Sri Lanka, which proscribed as 'terrorism' by the Europe and also the US but also romanticizes the culture, an egalitarianism and humility of the 'Tamils' in the World Politics.\n\nNationalism in simple words is a feeling of belongingness to a geographical region or culture. This has been demonstrated repeatedly by the ancient land of what is today known as Tamil Nadu. This paper aims to bring to light those instances of heroic deeds, which can be termed under nationalism. Sangam literature is said to record the history of Tamil land from 1000 BCE. If a land has a king, he thus has a caretaker. Elaborating on these lines, Tamil history continues to talk about their kings, especially Cholas who effectively cared for the land and subjects. The tradition was carried forward even in the colonial times; against the unjust British rule or in the disguise of a social reformer. However, it is noteworthy that all through history men have wanted what was best for their land. The paper attempts to highlight this feeling of nationalism and thence efforts taken for the same. The particular topic will be attempted to be studied, to explore the patriotism, attempts of maintaining and protecting the belongingness, undertaken by the rulers, the population from the land of Tamil Nadu.\n\nThis article on Tamil nationalist politics makes clear that crises of legitimacy and credibility after the January 8th election is not a factor that is limited to politics in the South. Article argues, the victory of the Yahapalana coalition has unexpectedly exacerbated the gap between the priorities of the major Tamil political parties and the needs of the Tamil people in the North."
