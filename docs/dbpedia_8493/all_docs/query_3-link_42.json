To honor their memories, we gathered a selection of their last works to share them widely with the world. Introducing The Last Column , a way to remember those who gave their lives to uncover the truth, and a demand justice so that those responsible for the murders are held accountable. Created in partnership with the Committee to Protect Journalists."
