        "text": "Yes, we recommend students have at least 250 observation hours. The experience helps the student enter the program with a better idea of the field, as well as the hand skills and fabrication basics to ensure a smooth transition from student to clinician. If you plan to apply to the program with less than 250 hours, please state when you plan to earn the remaining hours on your OPCAS application.\n\nFind a clinic in your area and call them. State your need to earn these observation hours and see what they can oﬀer. Be persistent! If you truly want to be part of this field, you must work your way up! If you need assistance finding a clinic in your area, visit www.abcop.org.\n\nYes, the University of Pittsburgh is now offering apartment-style living for graduate and professional students through Housing Services. Check out The Residences on Bigelow. Graduate students who are interested in applying for an apartment lease should complete Panther Central’s online form. Please note that the main area of study for onsite RST students is Bakery Square so while these apartments are still very conveniently located it is a 15-minute walk to our MSPO facilities.\n\nHere is the approximate travel time from the Residences on Bigelow to Bakery Square:\n\nWalk —50 minutes\n\nBus — 25 minutes\n\nCar —15 minutes (depending on the traffic likely more at peak times)\n\nPlease note that the main area of study for onsite RST students is Bakery Square so while these apartments are still very conveniently located it is more than a 15-minute walk to our MSPO facilities.\n\nOnly two courses are currently offered online for this program. This is important to note if you have a scholarship that requires all in-person work. The rest of the courses require in-person synchronous attendance. If you are interested in a career in assistive technology working with end-users, you may want to consider our Master of Rehabilitation Technology program. This program is offered online, offers flexible instruction, can be completed part- or full-time, and has several funding opportunities."
