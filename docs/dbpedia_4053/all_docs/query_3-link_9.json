Evidenced-based approaches for the selection of appropriate wheelchair products are needed. Performance standards establish test methods and requirements for devices. This new strategy will benefit clinicians and consumers during the selection of seating and mobility technology and enhance rehabilitation services by utilizing standardized performance measures to match appropriate and quality products to user needs.\n\nFunding source: HHS – National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR)\n\nLead RST investigator(s): David Brienza, Patricia Karg, Jon Pearlman, Mark Schmeler\n\nLink to website: National Rehabilitation Information Center\n\nAn RCT on Effectiveness of Support Surfaces with Microclimate Management in Prevention of Pressure Injuries\n\nThis study is designed to determine if and when microclimate management in a support surface is effective in preventing pressure injuries and what level of heat and moisture control performance is necessary for prevention effectiveness. The primary aim of the project is to compare the effectiveness of reactive support surfaces with low air loss to reactive support surfaces without low air loss in preventing pressure injuries for people with moisture risk factors in acute care. A secondary aim is to identify which low air loss performance characteristics and what level of those performance characteristics are necessary for the technology to be effective.\n\nFunding source: NIH – National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR)\n\nLead RST investigator(s): David Brienza, Patricia Karg\n\nEvaluation of the Wheelchair in-Seat Activity Tracker (WiSAT)\n\nThe overall objective of this project is to evaluate a newly developed technology known as WiSAT, a system capable of monitoring weight shifting and pressure relief behaviors and informing users of this in-seat activity using a mobile application. The system is used beneath a wheelchair user cushion and empowers users with knowledge about their pressure injury preventative behaviors. This study will assess the clinical effectiveness of the WiSAT for changing the behavior of wheelchair users at risk for pressure injuries.\n\nFunding source: Department of Defense (DoD), US Army\n\nLead RST investigator(s): Patricia Karg, David Brienza\n\nEffect of Temperature Control Liner Materials on Long-term Outcomes of Prosthesis Use\n\nProsthesis users complain about excessive sweat accumulation and subsequent problems with slippage, skin irritation, and discomfort. Recently, prosthesis liners that contain phase change materials (PCM) have become commercially available, holding the promise that the microclimate at the interface between the residual limb and the prosthetic socket can be regulated to reduce the user’s tendency to sweat. The study investigates whether the use of PCM infused liners can increase activity level, gait efficiency, and prosthesis utilization over longer (six-month) periods of use.\n\nFunding source: Department of Defense (DoD), US Army\n\nLead RST investigator(s): Goeran Fiedler\n\nDevelopment of an Innovative Gait Re-training System, MOVISUFiT\n\nGait retraining with real-time visual feedback (RTVF) as an intervention has demonstrated significant improvements in many patient populations. Video and mirror feedback can be used but has limitations, including the lack of mobility, realism, and sufficient quantity of steps the patient can review. Therefore, we are developing a system to provide real-time mobile visual feedback (MOVISUFiT) for gait training using kinetic data derived from the user’s limb itself and displayed wirelessly to smart glasses.\n\nFunding source: University of Pittsburgh Innovation Institute & Center for Medical Innovation\n\nLead RST investigator(s): Goeran Fiedler\n\nInitiative to Mobilize Partnerships for Successful Assistive Technology Transfer (IMPACT)\n\nThe IMPACT Center at the University of Pittsburgh provides tools and approaches to comprehensively understand barriers and facilitators to successful Assistive Technology Tech Transfer (ATTT) as well as raise awareness and increase the capacity of researchers and entrepreneurs to perform successful ATTT. This project consists of two main initiatives: defining the barriers and gateways to commercializing assistive technologies and developing online training resources and in-person seminars to empower those looking to advance assistive technology innovations.\n\nFunding source: HHS – National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR)\n\nLead RST investigator(s): Jon Pearlman, Mary Goldberg\n\nLink to website: IMPACT\n\nDesign and Testing of Wheelchairs for Less-resourced Environments\n\nRST continues to be involved in the development and testing of manual and power wheelchairs that meet cost and mobility needs for less-resourced countries. Examples of this include the SIMPL-WC, a single motor propelled wheelchair for India. Projects focus on design, testing, and clinical evaluation and then the subsequent transfer of the design to a manufacturer or foundation in less-resourced countries.\n\nFunding source: NIH – Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)\n\nLead RST investigator(s): Jon Pearlman\n\nWheelchair Transportation Safety\n\nRST is active in the development of technology and safety standards for the safe transportation of individuals seated in wheelchairs on motor vehicles. When a wheelchair is used as a motor vehicle seat, the vehicle must be modified and after-market equipment must be installed. Technology to meet these needs as well as national and international performance and safety standards to set requirements have been researched and developed.\n\nFunding source: HHS – National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR)\n\nLead RST investigator(s): Patricia Karg\n\nPromoting Mainstream Wireless Inclusion through Technology Services (PROMISE)\n\nThe goal of the Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center (RERC) is to expand access to and support effective use of mainstream wireless technologies among people with varying disabilities by engaging all relevant stakeholders to create and pilot innovative, viable, and scalable technology services.​ RST investigators are conducting a funding and policy study (Schmeler) and evaluating the efficacy of smart speaker training and accompanying resource toolkits (Goldberg).\n\nFunding source: HHS – National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR)\n\nLead RST investigator(s): Dan Ding,Mary Goldberg, Mark Schmeler\n\nWeight Measurement for Wheelchair Users\n\nWheelchair users have considerable challenges monitoring daily physical activities as well as recording physical health and weight conditions. RST investigators developed and are evaluating the E‑Scale, a bed scale system that acquires the weight changes from the legs of a bed. In addition to supporting weight management, the bed scales are being used in research to monitor and classify bed movement activities to identify those at risk for developing pressure injuries and maintain turning schedules to prevent injuries.\n\nFunding source: Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA)\n\nLead RST investigator(s): Jon Pearlman, David Brienza, Patricia Karg\n\nTraining Programs to Improve Outcomes for Individuals with Spinal Cord Injury\n\nRST investigators have developed the Wheelchair Skills Training Program (WSTP) and Wheelchair Maintenance Training Program (WMTP) and evaluated their effects on the participation and quality of life in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI).

This includes development of a roughness standard and tool for accurately measuring the roughness for sidewalks and pathways as well as development of tools for curb ramp design and inspection.\n\nFunding source: USDOT, PennDOT\n\nLead RST investigator(s): Jon Pearlman\n\nHealth App Review Tool: Connecting those Affected by Alzheimer's to Needed Technology Support\n\nThe use of apps to support health and quality of life for those with with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) has the potential to enhance health maintenance, monitoring, and care provision. Such tools have proven to be particularly important during the pandemic as remote health care service delivery is becoming more prevalent. However, an absence of intelligent decision-making support can lead to prescription of poorly matched apps, increasing the likelihood of technology abandonment and rendering otherwise impactful technology tools useless. Standardized methods of app evaluation are needed to improve clinical uptake and sustained use of such apps. The Health App Review Tool (HART) was designed to perform “best match” style assessments of health apps for end users who either live with ADRD or who care for a loved one with ADRD. The goal of this project is to connect those affected by ADRD with effective apps, using the HART. Availability of such a tool is anticipated to maximize the use of impactful health technologies, enabling better disease management and higher quality of life for those with ADRD and their caregivers.\n\nFunding source: a2 Collective funded through NIA, PennAITech\n\nLead RST investigator(s): Julie Faieta\n\nDesign Guidelines for Wheeled Mobility Accessibility\n\nThis project aims to create a suite of data-driven design tools for wheeled mobility accessibility in the built environment using anthropometry data collected on diverse wheeled mobility devices and device users in the US. These design tools will provide technical assistance to accessibility standards developers, government officials, and designer practitioners to help improve wheeled mobility access in transportation vehicles and in the built environment.\n\nFunding source: HHS – National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR), US Access Board, University of Buffalo Center for Inclusive Design and Environmental Access (IDeA Center)\n\nLead RST investigator(s): Clive D'Souza\n\nLink to website: Inclusive Mobility Research Laboratory - Whanthro\n\nAccessible Design of Automated Vehicles\n\nThrough a series of laboratory and field-based human factors studies, this project seeks to develop design information and technical guidance to inform the accessible design of emerging shared automated vehicles for accommodating the diverse needs of people with disabilities and older adults.\n\nFunding source: HHS – National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR), University of Michigan - Mcity\n\nLead RST investigator(s): Clive D'Souza\n\nLink to website: Inclusive Mobility Research Laboratory - AAV\n\nDisability, Aging, and Demand-Response Transportation\n\nMany people with disabilities and older adults in the US experience inadequate access to affordable and reliable transportation. This project examines the interactions between disability, aging, and environmental (e.g., socioeconomic, neighborhood characteristics) factors and use of demand-response transportation (e.g., ADA paratransit) among people aging with and/or into disability.\n\nFunding source: University of Michigan – Center for Disability Health and Wellness (UCU-M CDHW), HHS – National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR)\n\nLead RST investigator(s): Clive D'Souza\n\nLink to website: Inclusive Mobility Research Laboratory - Paratransit\n\n#EmployHer\n\nThe aim of the project is to identify opportunities to improve work and employment for women with psychosocial disabilities in Tana River County, Kenya.\n\nFunding source: Voice (an initiative of and financed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands)\n\nLead RST investigator(s): Ikenna Ebuenyi\n\nVVC Match: Enhancing Health Technology Resource Utilization through Informed Evaluations\n\nRecent efforts to provide care to veterans via telehealth services has led to financial losses due to significant rates of technology and tool disuse and abandonment. In order to address this, technology provision must be paired with appropriate technology assessment and education. Standardized methods of evaluating user specific digital health competencies necessary for successful VA Video Connect (VVC) app use are needed to improve uptake and sustained use of the VVC app among the 9 million veterans serviced through the VA. This project will focus on a user-centered co-design of the VVCMatch assessment, comprised of a technology profile and a user assessment, capable of 1) providing individualized assessments of potential users’ preparedness for VVC app use and 2) illuminating key digital health literacy areas in need of targeted education.\n\nFunding source: US Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center (GRECC) Pilot Project\n\nLead RST investigator(s): Julie Faieta, Jon Pearlman, Dan Ding\n\nCommunity Engagement Research Alliance (CEAL) Consultative Resource (CEACR) to Promote Research Reciprocity and Health Equity\n\nCEACR is developing a precision engagement model to be employed by research teams to help improve community engagement, recruitment, and better research and health outcomes.\n\nFunding source: NIH – Community Engagement Research Alliance (CEAL) Against COVID-19 Disparities\n\nLead RST investigator(s): Mary Goldberg\n\nLink to website: https://covid19community.nih.gov/about/about-CEACR\n\nInternational Society of Wheelchair Professionals (ISWP)\n\nISWP was formed in light of the fact that over 70 million people worldwide require wheelchairs for mobility and function, yet most lack access to appropriate wheelchairs or services to repair them. ISWP’s mission is to serve as a global resource for wheelchair service standards and provision through advocacy, education, standards, evidence-based practice, innovation, and a platform for information exchange.\n\nFunding source: United States Agency for International Development (USAID), JSI Research and Training Institute\n\nLead RST investigator(s): Jon Pearlman, Mary Goldberg\n\nLink to website: International Society of Wheelchair Professionals\n\nFunctional Mobility Assessment Outcomes Management System/Registry\n\nRST collaborates with VGM Group’s US Rehab and Orthotic and Prosthetic Group of America (OPGA) divisions to collect large‐scale Functional Mobility Assessment (FMA) data from their network of accredited equipment suppliers into an FMA Registry. Combined with a de‐identified minimum/uniform dataset (M/UDS), large datasets can be systematically analyzed to demonstrate more scientifically which types of mobility devices and service delivery models work best for given populations based on diagnosis, functional status, and environmental factors. Ultimately, it is expected that large data analyses will confirm that provision of properly fitted mobility equipment improves function and comfort, reduces hospitalizations and secondary medical complications (i.e. falls and pressure sores), and promotes participation.\n\nFunding source: VGM/US Rehab\n\nLead RST investigator(s): Mark Schmeler, Rich Schein\n\nInvestigating Prosthesis Users' Accommodation Time to Changes in Prosthetic Componentry\n\nAccommodation time may vary depending on patient and device-specific factors. This makes it difficult in clinical practice and research to purposefully allocate accommodation times that are neither too short (whenever device fit and alignment changes are conducted in quick succession) nor too long (whenever patients may have to endure prolonged periods using suboptimal devices). This project will evaluate whether measures of gait symmetry correlate with level of accommodation and can be used to assess this variable.\n\nFunding source: Orthotic and Prosthetic Education and Research Foundation (OPERF)\n\nLead RST investigator(s): Goeran Fiedler\n\nVeterans Administration Assistance and Advisory Services for Assistive Technology Labs\n\nFor several years RST has had contracts with the VA to set up Assistive Technology (AT) Labs at the VA Polytrauma Rehabilitation Centers (PRCs) and Spinal Cord Injury & Disorders (SCI/D) Centers. Although clinicians—who have access to some of the most advanced rehabilitation equipment and devices—are actively involved in fitting and prescribing AT devices and services for veterans and service members with disabilities, there was still a strong need to guide existing efforts and develop a coherent program for all aspects of AT service delivery, consistent with the level of expertise at the centers.\n\nFunding source: US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)\n\nLead RST investigator(s): Mark Schmeler, Rich Schein\n\nTelerehabilitation\n\nRST conducts research and develops methods, systems, and technologies that support remote delivery of rehabilitation and home health care services for individuals who have limited local access to comprehensive medical and rehabilitation outpatient services. This includes design and development of information technology infrastructure; development of models for clinical assessment and use of telerehabilitation services; and applications in services such as wheelchair prescription, job coaching, and communication function.\n\nFunding source: HHS – National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR)\n\nLead RST investigator(s): David Brienza, Mark Schmeler, Rich Schein\n\nComprehensive Evaluation Services for Research Centers and Training Programs\n\nCenter or program evaluation is critical to ensure the timely delivery of key outputs and to ensure both short- and long-term goals are met. The evaluations are generally comprised of both an impact and a process evaluation and include qualitative and quantitative components. Our evaluation team is engaged in metrics tracking, tool development, interviews, and focus groups. We develop data visualizations and regular reports to identify trends and recommend any corrective actions.\n\nFunding source: NIH– National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS), NIH – National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), NIH – National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS), NIH – Community Engagement Alliance (CEAL)\n\nLead RST investigator(s): Mary Goldberg\n\nInvestigation into Parallels of PASC and TBI Presentation\n\nWe are working to investigate the similarities between Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) presentation in order to better understand the implications of incidence of PASC on risk of exacerbated negative outcomes of TBI. This study will include investigating similarities in brain structure, genetic factors, and demographic factors relative to PASC and TBI presentation. Following an initial injury, subsequent TBI outcomes can be intensified. Therefore, better understanding of the parallels of PASC and TBI are needed to guide prudent preventative measures for those whose occupation increases the risk of attaining a TBI.\n\nFunding source: Jacob A. and Frieda M.

Current health policy for these devices is very restrictive to the point that devices are not even covered for people to leave their homes to attend work or school, which conflicts with the spirit of the Rehabilitation Act. Modern healthcare is moving towards accountable and value-based care that uses a combination of research, large data, and best practices to determine what services will be paid for. The University of Pittsburgh Department of Rehabilitation Science & Technology in collaboration with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), UPMC Health Plan, The Ohio State University, University of Michigan and key disability, industry, and policy stakeholders will perform a series of interrelated project activities to: 1) evaluate current policies, novel models with stakeholder input; 2) develop a standardized assessment and procurement protocol; 3) perform analyses of existing datasets relevant to CRT; and 4) evaluate the feasibility of a new model. The overall expected outcome is a strategy for the provision and payment of CRT within an accountable and value-based healthcare environment that can inform all stakeholders including health plans and policymakers.\n\nFunding source: HHS – National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR)\n\nLead RST investigator(s): Mark Schmeler, Rich Schein\n\nLink to website: www.crtpolicy.pitt.edu\n\nRehabilitation in the Face of Progressive Decline: Practice and Perspectives\n\nThis is an exploratory study to investigate the utilization of rehabilitative services to support health and wellbeing for individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) and the factors that influence the practice and perspectives of stakeholders in the United States.\n\nFunding source: Pepper Older Americans Independence Centers (OAIC)\n\nLead RST investigator(s): Ikenna Ebuenyi, Julie Faieta\n\nTowards Equitable Provision and use of Assistive Technology (AT) for Persons with Intellectual Disabilities\n\nThe aim of the project is to investigate the facilitators and barriers to AT provision and use for individuals with Intellectual Disabilities using the AT library system and to determine how to best further equitable AT services in Allegheny County.\n\nLead RST investigator(s): Ikenna Ebuenyi"
