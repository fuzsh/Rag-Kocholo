        "text": "Does the University of Pittsburgh offer a chiropractic program?\n\nYes, the University of Pittsburgh is offering a Doctor of Chiropractic (DC) Program housed within the School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences. Read more.\n\nWhat is unique about the Doctor of Chiropractic program at Pitt?\n\nThe University of Pittsburgh is the first research-intensive public university in the United States and only university in Pennsylvania to offer an educational program leading to a DC degree. The program will focus on evidence-based spine care and prepare students to work in real world, interprofessional health care settings and become valued members of team-based care, as well as private practitioners.\n\nStudents in Pitt’s program will gain hands-on, patient-centered clinical experiences starting in the first term of the program.\n\nInterprofessional didactic and clinical opportunities will span across the six Schools of the Health Sciences at the University of Pittsburgh (Dental, Medicine, Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, Nursing, Pharmacy and Public Health). Upon graduation, students will be uniquely qualified to work in an integrated clinical environment among a team of other health care professionals, all dedicated to improving patient outcomes.\n\nWhen will the first cohort begin?\n\nThe first cohort will begin courses in the fall term of 2025 (August).\n\nHow long is the program?\n\nThe program is eight terms (32 months) in length and includes two summer terms. Classes begin each fall term (August).\n\nWhy is Pitt’s DC program shorter (8 terms) than any other program?\n\nTo make Pitt's chiropractic education program more accessible and affordable to all students, our faculty have structured and organized an innovative, high-quality curriculum to meet the profession’s accreditation standards that will enable students to graduate as confident clinicians within a shorter timeframe than other DC programs.\n\nWhat is the structure of the program?\n\nThe program is full time only and offered on-campus (in-person).\n\nWhat will be the average class size of this program?\n\nWe will accept 40 students in the program’s initial cohort in fall (August) 2025, followed by a second cohort of 50 students in fall 2026, and 60 students in all subsequent cohorts. We are keeping our class sizes smaller than many other chiropractic programs to ensure program quality.\n\nWhat are the admissions requirements?\n\nPlease see our admissions page for detailed requirements.\n\nWhen can I apply?\n\nThe application to apply for the fall (August) 2025 cohort will open in fall 2024. Check our admissions page regularly for more information or sign up to receive email notifications about Pitt’s new Doctor of Chiropractic program.\n\nMore information about the application and review process will be announced in summer 2024.\n\nHow do I apply?\n\nApplicants will use GradCAS to apply to this program. The application process will open in fall 2024.\n\nAre interviews a required part of the application process?\n\nAll submitted and completed applications will be reviewed by members of the Doctor of Chiropractic program admissions committee. Personal interviews will be required of the top applicants. Interviews may be conducted by videoconference for applicants who are unable to visit Pittsburgh in person.\n\nWhat can I expect to learn in the curriculum?\n\nStudents will learn how to diagnosis, treat and manage patients with spine and musculoskeletal conditions. The curriculum will include strong training in manual therapy skills, therapeutic exercises and inter-personal communication skills. A hallmark of the curriculum will be the inclusion of real-world clinical training in each semester of the program.\n\nWhere are the clinical affiliation and internship sites located?\n\nThis Doctor of Chiropractic program will offer students several unique clinical training opportunities that are available only in an integrated education and clinical system such as the one that currently exists between the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) health care system and the Veterans Administration Pittsburgh Healthcare System. Additional clinical partnerships are being developed with other health care systems in the state of Pennsylvania such as St. Luke’s University Health Network and with Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). These organizations are also known as community health centers and provide a model of health care focused on specific, targeted populations in under-served communities. FQHCs emphasize a comprehensive approach to health care with integrated clinical services, often including chiropractic services.\n\nThe curriculum is designed to expose students to patient-centered, evidence-based clinical training every term of the program. There will be a stepped approach to this clinical training, starting with observational rounds in the first year, followed by assisting with clinical tasks in the second year and finally with a full-time clerkship in the final semester of the program."
