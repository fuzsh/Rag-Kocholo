Let's take a moment to recognize and applaud the Occupational Therapy Department. These remarkable individuals are an integral part of the Intensive Therapy/Rehabilitation Services program at Perth and Smiths Falls District Hospital, and this month, we celebrate their exceptional contribution. What is occupational therapy? It is a form of healthcare that addresses barriers that prevent individuals from performing activities they enjoy. Occupational therapists assist with daily living tasks such as dressing and eating, as well as being productive in work, school, or community settings. Moreover, they help individuals participate in leisure activities such as sports, gardening, and social events, emphasizing the importance of a holistic approach. #OccupationalTherapy #HealthcareJobs #EmployeeRecognition #OSOT2023 #CAOT\n\nYou heard it here first, #EKU is home to one of the best Occupational Therapy programs in the nation!
