This undergraduate program allows you to learn more about the challenges and issues that surround people with disabilities, and the technologies that can improve their quality of life.\n\nFollow a rigorous curriculum that includes elective and core courses in anatomy, physiology, kinesiology, research methodology, neuroscience, disability rights and more. If youâ€™d like to specialize your degree, opt for one of three certificate programs in the areas of assistive technology, pathokinesiology or psycho-social issues in rehabilitation and personal care.\n\nThis undergraduate degree serves as a stepping stone to graduate work in the areas of physical or occupational therapy, rehabilitation counseling or technology, physician assistant studies, prosthetics and orthotics or many other clinical degrees, including medicine and accelerated nursing and public health."
