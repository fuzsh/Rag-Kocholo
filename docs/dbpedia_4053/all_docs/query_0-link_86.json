        "text": "The University of Pittsburgh, commonly referred to as Pitt, is a state-related[7] research university located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. Founded as Pittsburgh Academy in 1787 on what was then the American frontier, Pitt is one of the oldest continuously chartered institutions of higher education in the United States. Pitt evolved into the Western University of Pennsylvania with an alteration to its charter in 1819, and upon relocating to its current campus in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh in 1908, the school received its current moniker, the University of Pittsburgh. For most of its history Pitt was a private institution, until it became part of the Commonwealth System of Higher Education in 1966.[8]\n\nPitt has consistently placed in the top cluster of U.S. public research universities and among the overall top 25 research universities according to the Center for Measuring University Performance,[9] is listed as one of U.S. News & World Report's top 20 public universities,[10] and has been listed among the best colleges for the quality of life of its students.[11] Pitt has also been named as a \"best value\" by various publications,[12][13][14] and has appeared in multiple rankings of the world's top universities.[15][16][17][18]\n\nPitt is among the nation's and world's most active research institutions as evidenced by its $642 million in annual research expenditures, its standing among the top five schools in the amount of National Institutes of Health research allocations, and its election as one of the 61 North American members of the Association of American Universities.[19] Pitt and its medical school are also closely affiliated with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, one of the nation's leading academic medical centers.[20]\n\nPitt is popularly recognized for its centerpiece building, the Cathedral of Learning, for its central role in developing the first polio vaccine,[21] and for fielding nationally competitive NCAA Division I athletic programs.[22]\n\nHistory of the University[]\n\nMain article: History of the University of Pittsburgh\n\nThe founding[]\n\nFounded by Hugh Henry Brackenridge as Pittsburgh Academy in 1787, the University of Pittsburgh is one of the few universities and colleges established in the 18th century in the United States. It is the oldest continuously chartered institution of learning in the U.S. west of the Allegheny Mountains.[7] The school began its life as a preparatory school, presumably in a log cabin, possibly as early as 1770[23] in Western Pennsylvania, then a frontier.[24] Hugh Henry Brackenridge sought and obtained a charter for the school from the state legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that was passed by the assembly on February 28, 1787, just ten weeks before the opening of the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia.[25][26] A brick building was erected in 1790 on the south side of Third Street and Cherry Alley for the Pittsburgh Academy.[27][28][29] The small two-story brick building, with a gable facing the alley, contained three rooms: one below and two above.[30]\n\nThe Western University[]\n\nWithin a short period, more advanced education in the area was needed, so in 1819 the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania amended the school's 1787 charter to confer university status. The school took the name the Western University of Pennsylvania, or WUP, and was intended to be the western sister institution to the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.[31][32] By 1830, WUP had moved into a new three-story, freestone-fronted building, with Ionic columns and a cupola, near its original buildings fronting the south side of Third Street, between Smithfield Street and Cherry Alley in downtown Pittsburgh. By the 1830s, the university faced severe financial pressure to abandon its traditional liberal education in favor of the state legislature's desire for it to provide more vocational training. The decision to remain committed to liberal education nearly killed the university, but it persevered despite its abandonment by the city and state.[33] It was also during this era that founder of Mellon Bank, Thomas Mellon (Class of 1837), graduated and later taught at WUP.[27][28][29]\n\nFires[]\n\nThe University's buildings, along with most of its records and files, were destroyed in the Great Fire of 1845 that wiped out 20 square blocks of Pittsburgh. Classes were temporarily held in Trinity Church until a new building was constructed on Duquesne Way (on what was the site of the former Horne's department store). Only four years later, in 1849, this building also was destroyed by fire. Due to the catastrophic nature of these fires, operations were suspended for a few years to allow the University time to regroup and rebuild. By 1854, WUP had erected a new building on the corner of Ross and Diamond (now Forbes Avenue) streets (site of the present day City-County building) and classes resumed in 1855. It is during this era, in 1867, that Samuel Pierpoint Langley, astronomer, inventor, aviation pioneer and future Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, was chosen as director of the Allegheny Observatory that was donated to WUP in 1865. Langley was professor of astronomy and physics and remained at WUP until 1891, when he was succeeded by another prominent astronomer, James Keeler. Growing quickly during this period, WUP outgrew its downtown facilities and the university moved its campus to Allegheny City (present-day North Side).[27][28][29]\n\nA move north[]\n\nThe University eventually found itself on a Template:Convert/LoffAoffDbSonNa site on the North Side's Observatory Hill at the location of its Allegheny Observatory. There, it constructed two new buildings, Science Hall and Main Hall, that were occupied by 1889 and 1890 respectively. During this era, the first collegiate football team was formed at Pitt in 1889. In 1892, the Western Pennsylvania Medical College was amalgamated into the University. By 1893, the University had graduated its first African-American, William Dammond.[34] In 1895, WUP established its School of Law and Andrew Carnegie and George Westinghouse were elected to the Board of Trustees, where they joined Andrew Mellon who was elected in 1894. The Pittsburgh College of Pharmacy and Pittsburgh Dental School also joined the University in 1896. In 1898, the first women, sisters Margaret and Stella Stein, graduated from the University.[35] During this period, University engineering professor Reginald Fessenden was conducting pioneering work in radio broadcasting. By 1904, playing at Exposition Park, the University had its first undefeated football team.[27][28][29][36]\n\nA new name and home[]\n\nCiting a need to avoid confusion, distinguish itself from the University of Pennsylvania, and return to its roots by identifying itself with the city, the Western University of Pennsylvania, by act of the state legislature, was renamed the University of Pittsburgh in the summer of 1908. During this time, the University had also outgrown its accommodations on what is now the North Side of Pittsburgh and its departments had been scattered throughout the city for years. To consolidate all of its components on one campus, WUP bought Template:Convert/LoffAoffDbSoffNa of land in December 1907 in what is now the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh and began relocating departments there by 1909.[37] The initial campus plan for the University centered on the winning submission from a national architectural contest that incorporated a Greek Acropolis design by Henry Hornbostel for 30 buildings.[38] However, due to financial and other constraints, only four of the buildings were constructed in this style, of which only Thaw Hall remains today. It was also during this period that the university, led by Chancellor Samuel McCormick, would again fend off pressures to abandon the school's commitment to liberal education in favor of more technical-based training. During his administration, McCormick would also lead the university into a new level of national recognition, expansion, and growth, as well as began institutional support of athletics.[39]\n\nA national landmark[]\n\nIn the 1920s, new university chancellor John Gabbert Bowman declared that he had a vision for a centerpiece \"tall building\" for the university. The Template:Convert/LoffAoffDbSoffNa Frick Acres property in Oakland was soon purchased and plans for the campus shifted focus from the hillside to a neo-Gothic Revival plan that today comprises the Cathedral of Learning, Heinz Memorial Chapel, Stephen Foster Memorial, and Clapp Hall buildings. By 1925, Bowman had settled on a design by Charles Klauder for the \"tall building\": an attention-getting Template:Convert/ft tower whose great height, with open spaces all around, would suggest the \"character that ought to be in an educated man.\" The building's \"parallel lines going up and up...would express courage [and] fearlessness\" and it would \"unify Pittsburgh into a community conscious of its character.\" The Cathedral is \"cut off\" flat at the top to suggest that its lines, like education, have no ending. The building was financed by donors as well as a campaign to collect dimes from local school children. Bowman was a persuasive leader and although the Great Depression intervened, the Cathedral of Learning, on which construction was begun in 1926, started hosting classes in 1931 and was formally dedicated in 1937. Today, it remains the second tallest university building in the world and contains an equally-impressive interior highlighted by a half-acre (2,000 m²) Gothic hall Commons Room with Template:Convert/ft tall arches currently surrounded by 27 Nationality Rooms, however eight more Nationality Rooms are in the making.[40]\n\nDevelopment of the polio vaccine[]\n\nIn the early 20th century, epidemics of polio began to hit the United States and other industrialized countries. As hospital wards filled with patients in iron lungs, and tens of thousands were left disabled, fear of contracting polio grew rampant and led to the closing of many public facilities. Meanwhile, Dr. Jonas Salk had set up the University of Pittsburgh's Virus Research Lab in the basement of what is now Salk Hall. By 1951, Salk and his team had begun immunization experiments in monkeys using dead polio virus. Soon, however, Salk began to test inoculations in paralyzed polio patients and by 1953 human trials among the general population were initiated. By the spring of the following year, the largest controlled field trials in medical history were underway, and by 1955 the vaccine developed by Jonas Salk and his team of Pitt researchers was declared effective. By 1962, Salk's vaccine had reduced the incidence of polio in the United States by 95 percent. The breakthroughs in immunology and vaccine development at Pitt by Salk and his team are considered one of the most significant scientific and medical achievements in history.[41][42]\n\nState relations[]\n\nIn 1966, Pitt was designated by Pennsylvania as a state-related university. As such, Pitt receives public funds ($185.4 million in fiscal year 2011) covering about 9% of its operating budget and offers reduced tuition to Pennsylvania residents. Pitt remains under independent control, but is typically categorized as a public university. Upon affiliation with the state, subsidized tuition led to a massive influx of new students and rapid expansion of Pitt's size and scope. In the 1970s, Pitt's football team returned to greatness with a national championship season in 1976 led by Hall of Fame running back Tony Dorsett and continued success in the 1980s with players such as Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino. In the 1980s, significant medical research in the field of organ transplantation was conducted by Thomas Starzl, establishing Pitt as the world leader in the field of organ transplantation. In 1991, long-time chancellor Wesley Posvar retired after 24 years in office. His administration is best known for elimination of the university's debt from its 1960s financial crisis and for increasing the school's prestige and endowment. Under Posvar, Pitt's operating budget grew sevenfold to $630 million and its endowment tripled to $257 million.[43] Mark Nordenberg has been chancellor of the University since 1995 and is leading Pitt through a period of substantial progress, including a $2-billion capital-raising campaign that is over half-way toward achieving its goal[44] and a $1-billion 12-year facilities plan.[45] In 2010, Pitt's $2.033 billion endowment ranked 28th among all colleges and universities and 7th nationally among public universities.[46] Pitt's endowment now stands at $2.545 billion.\n\nLocation and campus[]\n\nThe University of Pittsburgh's main campus comprises approximately 132 urban acres (0.53 km2) located in Pittsburgh's historic Oakland neighborhood. Much of the campus, including its centerpiece 42-story Cathedral of Learning, falls within the Oakland Civic Center/Schenley Farms National Historic District.[47] The campus contains an eclectic mix of architecture that includes Greek revival, Neogothic, Italian Renaissance, and modern. It has been termed \"a theme park of replica buildings, representing the architecture of the past speaking to the present.\"[48] The campus has won multiple Green Star Awards from the Professional Grounds Management Society.[49][50][51]\n\nThe University of Pittsburgh's main campus can be thought to be made up of four contiguous sections: upper (sports complexes, residence halls); mid (Benedum, Chevron, Allen and Thaw Halls); lower (Cathedral of Learning, Union, Posvar Hall); and on the west end of campus, the medical center complex. The campus is generally bordered by Darragh Street/McKee Place to the west and Bellefield Avenue/Dithridge Street to the east; Forbes and Fifth avenues traverse the campus from west to east. Although generally within walking distance, the university also runs a bus and shuttle service between various campus locations and bordering neighborhoods.\n\nThe main campus abuts or is within a short walking distance of many recreational, cultural, and educational institutions that also populate the Oakland neighborhood. The campus is directly adjacent to Schenley Plaza, the main branch of the Carnegie Public Library, the Carnegie Museums of Natural History and Art, and the Carnegie Music Hall. Carlow University is just west of campus, adjacent to the University's medical center complexes. Carnegie Mellon University, Central Catholic High School and historic Schenley Park, site of the Phipps Conservatory & Botanical Gardens, lie across Junction Hollow on the east end. Some Pitt professors also hold adjunct professorships at Carnegie Mellon and vice-versa.\n\nHistoric buildings[]\n\nThere are two University buildings listed separately on the National Register of Historic Places: Allegheny Observatory (in Pittsburgh's Riverview Park on the Northside) and the Cathedral of Learning.[52] Twenty-one of Pitt's buildings (including the 5 residence halls that make up Schenley Quadrangle, see below) are contributing properties to the Schenley Farms-Oakland Civic Center Historic District that has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district.[47]\n\nDue to the historical nature of various sites in or around Pitt's buildings, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has placed historical markers outside the Allegheny Observatory,[53] Posvar Hall,[54][55] Salk Hall,[56] Stephen Foster Memorial,[57] and the William Pitt Union.[58] In addition, a Pennsylvania Historical Marker has been placed on campus near the Cathedral of Learning to mark the significance of the University of Pittsburgh itself.[59] Another state historical marker has been placed to highlight the significance of Pitt's involvement in the archaeological excavation at the Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Avella, Pennsylvania.[60]\n\nIn addition, the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation has designated the following Pitt buildings as Pittsburgh Historic Landmarks: Allegheny Observatory, Allen Hall, Alumni Hall, Bellefield Hall, Chancellor's Residence, Cathedral of Learning, the Cathedral of Learning interior rooms, Gardner Steel Conference Center, Heinz Memorial Chapel, Thaw Hall, Salk Hall, Schenley Quadrangle residence halls, Stephen Foster Memorial, the University Child Development Center, and the William Pitt Union.[61][62]\n\nOther Pitt buildings not designated individually as landmarks, but listed among the 16 Pitt-owned contributing properties to the Schenley Farms Historic District, include Clapp Hall, O'Hara Student Center, Ruskin Hall, Thackeray Hall, Frick Fine Arts Building, Music Building, and the University Club.[63]\n\nHistoric structures within, adjacent to, or near Pitt's campus, but not belonging to the university, include the Carnegie Museum buildings, Frick School, Forbes Field wall remnant, Magee Estate iron fence, the Schenley Fountain, Mellon Institute, Phipps Conservatory & Botanical Gardens, the Pittsburgh Athletic Association, St. Paul's Cathedral, St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church, Schenley High School, Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall, and the Stephen Foster sculpture. Many of these buildings and their facilities are integrated into the events and activities of the university.\n\nOther buildings[]\n\nMain article: List of University of Pittsburgh buildings\n\nThe majority of Pitt-owned facilities are clustered in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh which includes the Schenley Farms Historic District, however a few prominent facilities are scattered elsewhere throughout the city, including the adjacent Shadyside neighborhood. Pitt also maintains regional Pennsylvania campuses in Bradford, Greensburg, Johnstown, and Titusville, as well as a Computer Center in RIDC Park in Blawnox, the Plum Boro Science Center in Plum, the University of Pittsburgh Applied Research Center (U-PARC) in Harmarville, and the Pymatuning Laboratory of Ecology in Linesville.[64] The university also has a major archeological research site, the Allen L. Cook Spring Creek Preserve, in Spring Creek, Wyoming.[65][66]\n\nAthletic facilities of the University of Pittsburgh Panthers that are located in Oakland in the upper campus and include the Charles L Cost Sports Center, Fitzgerald Field House, the Petersen Events Center, Trees Hall and Trees Field. An approximately $30 million upgrade of on-campus sports facilities, termed the Petersen Sports Complex, is under construction and will include new soccer, baseball, softball facilities, as well as clear space for the future construction of a new track and field and band complex following its completion.[67] Athletic facilities in Pittsburgh that are located outside of the Oakland neighborhood include Heinz Field and the UPMC Sports Performance Complex.\n\nMajor on-campus residence halls include the Litchfield Towers, Schenley Quadrangle, Bouquet Gardens and Ruskin Hall located on the lower campus, Lothrop Hall and Forbes Hall on the medical campus, and Pennsylvania, Panther, and Sutherland halls located on the upper campus.\n\nUniversity of Pittsburgh Medical Center[]\n\nMain article: University of Pittsburgh Medical Center\n\nSee also: List of UPMC buildings in Pittsburgh\n\nThe University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), which is consistently ranked in U.S. News & World Report's \"Honor Roll\" of America's top hospitals,[68] consists of the following hospitals and facilities in the Oakland area, many of which have shared use with various university departments: UPMC Presbyterian Hospital, UPMC Montefiore Hospital, Magee-Women's Hospital of UPMC, Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic in Thomas Detre Hall, Eye and Ear Institute, Forbes Tower (home to the School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences), Iroquois Building, Kaufman Medical Building, Medical Arts Building, 230 McKee Place, and UPMC University Center. UPMC academic hospitals and facilities that are scattered elsewhere throughout the city include the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC campus in the Lawrencevville neighborhood, the UPMC Sports Performance Complex on the South Side, and UPMC Shadyside and the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute in the Hillman Cancer Center both located in the Shadyside neighborhood adjacent to Oakland.\n\nPanthers[]\n\nMain article: Panthers of Pittsburgh\n\nIn the fall of 1909, the University of Pittsburgh was the first college or university to adopt the panther (Puma concolor) as its mascot.[69] Popular as photo sites, there are ten representations of Panthers in and about Pitt's campus, and ten more painted fiberglass panthers placed around the campus by the Pitt Student Government. These fiberglass panther structures are given to a campus group for a year and painted by the group to reflect their interests. The oldest representations are four panthers that guard each corner of the Panther Hollow bridge. Other Oakland locations include both inside and in front of the William Pitt Union, outside the Petersen Events Center, \"Pitt the Panther\" on the carousel in Schenley Plaza, the Panther head fountain on the front of the Cathedral of Learning, and the Pitt Panther statue outside Heinz Field on Pittsburgh's North Side.\n\nEducation[]\n\nThroughout its history, Pitt has been committed to a liberal arts education with a well-rounded curriculum in the arts, sciences, and humanities.[33] Pitt has an increasing emphasis on undergraduate research experience and for providing real-world opportunities such as co-ops and internships.[70] Undergraduate degrees can be earned as Bachelor's of Arts, Bachelor's of Science, and Bachelor's of Philosophy. Along with providing certificate programs, graduate level masters, professional, and doctoral degrees are also awarded. Pitt has also initiated a University-wide Outside the Classroom Curriculum (OCC) that includes a structured series of extracurricular programs and experiences designed to complement students' academic studies and help develop personal attributes and professional skills.[71] Students who complete the OCC requirements receive an OCC \"transcript\" and a green cord of distinction to wear at commencement.[72]\n\nSchools[]\n\nBachelor's, master's, doctoral and professional programs are offered through the following academic units:\n\nDietrich School of Arts and Sciences\n\nCollege of Business Administration\n\nJoseph M. Katz Graduate School of Business\n\nSchool of Dental Medicine\n\nSchool of Education\n\nSwanson School of Engineering\n\nCollege of General Studies\n\nSchool of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences\n\nUniversity Honors College\n\nSchool of Information Sciences\n\nSchool of Law\n\nSchool of Medicine\n\nSchool of Nursing\n\nSchool of Pharmacy\n\nGraduate School of Public & International Affairs (GSPIA)\n\nGraduate School of Public Health\n\nSchool of Social Work\n\nInternational studies[]\n\nPitt’s history of commitment to international education is illustrated by its unique collection of 27 Nationality Rooms on the first and third floors of the Cathedral of Learning. As a further demonstration of this commitment, Pitt is one of the country’s leading producers of both Fulbright scholars and Peace Corps volunteers[73][74] and one of less than 20 American universities to claim five or more area studies programs that have been competitively designated as National Resource Centers by the U.S. Department of Education.[75]\n\nPitt's National Resource Centers include Asian, European, Latin American, Russian and East European, and Global studies,[76] as well as Pitt's International Business Center.[75] In addition, Pitt's Asian Studies Center has been awarded status as a Confucius Institute by the Chinese Ministry of Education.[77][78] Further, Pitt is home to one of just ten European Union Centers of Excellence in the U.S., funded by the European Commission.\n\nThe University Center for International Studies (UCIS) coordinates international education curricula, centers on topical specializations in international studies, and the centers for area studies, including the National Resource Centers, among existing faculty and departments throughout the university. It does not itself give degrees but awards certificates of attainment to degree candidates in the University's schools and also operates certificate programs in African Studies (undergraduate) and in Global Studies (undergraduate & graduate).[79] UCIS also operates the Study Abroad Office,[80] Nationality Rooms and Intercultural Exchange Programs.[81]\n\nPitt's study abroad program, under the auspices of UCIS, helps to facilitate student study in over a hundred different countries, and oversees a variety of programs including the Panther Programs, which are course taught abroad that have been developed and are accompanied by faculty of the university; two-way exchange agreements with foreign institutions; and Pitt-recognized, third-party exchange programs.[82] The university also offers several study abroad scholarships, including those through the Nationality Rooms program.[83] In addition, following the decision to end a 24-year sponsorship of the Semester at Sea program due to academic, administrative and safety concerns,[84] Pitt has created a Multi-region Academic Program (PittMAP) that involves international travel, accompanied by university faculty, to three different continents for the comparative study of one of six rotating global study themes.[85][86]\n\nRankings[]\n\nPitt rankings\n\nARWU World[15] 56 ARWU United States[15] 37 ARWU Life Sciences[87]40 ARWU Clinical Medicine[88] 12 ARWU Social Sciences[89]47 CMUP Research Universities[9]25 FSPI[90]31 HEEACT World[91]24 GUR Global[92]42 SCImago Worldwide[93]26 THES World[94]64 USNWR National University[95]56 USNWR National Best Values[96]39 USNWR National Top Publics[97]20 USNWR Business[98]79 USNWR Education[99]23 USNWR Engineering[100]48 USNWR Law[101]71 USNWR Library & Information[102]10 USNWR Medical (research)[103]14 USNWR Medical (primary care)[104]28 USNWR Nursing[105]7 USNWR Pharmacy[106]19 USNWR Physical Therapy[107]2 USNWR Public Affairs[108]27 USNWR Public Health[109]11 USNWR Social Work[110]14 Washington Monthly National[111] 43 Wuhan International ESI[112] 29 Webometrics World[113] 39\n\nThe Center for Measuring University Performance has ranked Pitt, along with only six other schools, in the top tier of U.S. public research universities and in the 6th tier (or top 25) among all universities according to its 2009 annual report.[9]\n\nIn 2009, U.S. News & World Report ranked Pitt 20th in comparison to other public universities in the United States and 56th among all national universities.[10] In addition, U.S. News ranked Pitt 39th on the dimension of \"best value\" among all national universities,[12] Princeton Review placed Pitt among its \"Best Value Public Colleges\",[14] while Kiplinger rated Pitt the best value in Pennsylvania and eighth best nationally for out-of-state students among public universities in their 2011 rankings.[13]\n\nIn worldwide evaluations of universities, Newsweek ranked Pitt 37th in its \"The Top 100 Global Universities.\"[114] Pitt ranked 50th worldwide (and 37th in the U.S.) in the Shanghai Jiao Tong University's Academic Ranking of World Universities.[15] Pitt ranked 116th in the 2011 QS World University Rankings,[115] coming 39th in the United States, and attaining 99th for Arts & Humanities.[116] Pitt ranks 24th of all universities in the world for the impact and performance of its scientific public publications according to the Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities produced by the Higher Education Evaluation and Accreditation Council of Taiwan (HEEACT).[18] Pitt ranks as the 26th best higher education research institution worldwide according to SCImago Institutions Rankings' 2009 World Report.[93] Other world rankings include 29th in the world in the latest ranking by the Research Center for Chinese Science Evaluation at Wuhan University,[117] 37th in the world in the latest Webometrics rankings,[113] and 42nd in the world according to both the 2006 G-Factor International University Ranking[118] as well as the Russian-based 2009 Global University Ranking.[17]\n\nIn addition to its academic rankings, Pitt has also been recognized for its positive campus atmosphere, with The Princeton Review rating Pitt as having the 8th happiest student body and the 11th best quality of life in the nation in 2010.[11]\n\nMany of university's individual schools, departments, and programs are highly regarded in their particular field as evidenced by the number of Pitt programs that were ranked in the latest National Research Council rankings.[119] Particularly well regarded programs include Pitt's Department of Philosophy, which has long been renowned in the U.S. and worldwide, and is especially strong in the areas of mathematical and philosophical logic, metaphysics, history and philosophy of science, philosophy of language, philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of mind and psychology, and semantics.[120][121]\n\nThe University of Pittsburgh Schools of the Health Sciences, including Medicine, Dental, Nursing, Pharmacy, Public Health, and Rehabilition are also all highly ranked and regarded in their respective fields.[122] In addition, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, is consistently honored as one of America's top hospitals.[68]\n\nThe university's Joseph M. Katz School of Business MBA program is ranked first in the U.S. in \"Value for Money,\" 51st overall in the nation, and its faculty research is ranked 47th in the world by the 2007 Financial Times ranking.[123] The Joseph Katz Graduate School consistently ranks among the top ten public business schools in the U.S. according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nPitt's law school faculty has been ranked 21st in the nation based upon standard objective measures of scholarly impact.[124] Overall Pitt's Law School is ranked 63rd by The Law School 100,[125] is listed among the nation's top law schools by The Princeton Review,[126] and was ranked 71st by U.S. News & World Report in 2011,[101][127] down from a peak ranking of 48th in 2004.[128]\n\nPitt is home to the Gertrude E. and John M.
