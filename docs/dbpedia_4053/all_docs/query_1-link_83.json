The AVPT Certification is a post-professional certification program for physical therapists who want to become experts in vestibular rehabilitation. Wood completed rigorous coursework and demonstrated clinical competency skills to achieve the advanced certification.\n\nVestibular rehabilitation is a type of physical therapy commonly used for conditions such as vertigo and labyrinthitis that focuses on improving the relationship between the inner ear, brain, eyes, muscles, and nerves. The therapy can also reduce the risk of falling and improve balance, body strength, and the patient’s ability to stabilize vision.\n\nWood, who is a Montrose native, joined Allied Services in 2005.
