The program prepares students for practice within the United States and meets the educational degree completion requirements for licensure in all 50 states. Upon graduation, students are eligible to sit for the national licensure exam (NPTE). Students should note that the requirements for professional licensure could vary drastically by state as well as country. Because such requirements can change frequently and often without notice, it is strongly encouraged, and is the responsibility of the student, to ensure the degree they earn will meet the requirements for licensure in the state or country in which they seek licensure. Students are encouraged to visit their state and/or country licensing board website for further information. International students interested in gaining employment within the United States upon graduation are encouraged to communicate with their advisor in the Office of International Studies.\n\nView the licensure information by state and U.S. territory here.\n\nFelony Statement\n\nNotice to Applicants: A prior criminal record may negatively impact your ability to fully participate in the University’s Doctor of Physical Therapy curriculum. Prior to participating in clinical rotations and during the state licensure process, students admitted to the program will be required to complete a criminal background check. Certain convictions may prevent students from entering clinical facilities, which may hinder a student’s ability to successfully complete the program. In addition, certain criminal convictions may prevent a graduating student from being licensed. If applicable, we encourage you to check with the appropriate State licensing board(s) to determine whether your background may be a barrier to your completion of the program and future licensure. Additionally, the University may require an internal investigation to determine if the conviction would preclude the candidate from successfully completing the education requirements for graduation, including the clinical education requirements."
