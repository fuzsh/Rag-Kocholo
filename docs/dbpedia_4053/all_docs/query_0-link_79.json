        "text": "The University of Pittsburgh was initially established as Pittsburgh Academy in 1787 by Hugh Henry Brackenridge on the edge of the American frontier. As the first chartered institution west of the Allegheny Mountains, the school began in a three-room log cabin. In the past two centuries, Pitt has evolved dramatically into a large public state-funded research institution. The University of Pittsburgh enrolls approximately 18,700 undergraduates and 9,800 post-graduates annually. Spread over 132 acres, Pitt has a main urban campus in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. With nearly $900 million in funding, Pitt runs 17 academic schools and countless research centers, including the Aging Institute.\n\nAccording to the U.S. News, the University of Pittsburgh is the 66th best national university, 24th top public school, and 55th best college for veterans. In particular, Pitt is recognized for having America's 16th best medical school with the 10th top geriatrics program. Forbes magazine ranked Pitt as the 97th best research university nationwide. Kiplinger's Personal Finance honored the University of Pittsburgh as the best public value in Pennsylvania and eighth nationally. Pitt is included within the Princeton Review's list of \"Colleges That Create Futures\" and \"Best 380 Colleges.\" Times Higher Education has also crowned the University of Pittsburgh as the 79th best institution globally.\n\nUniversity of Pittsburgh Accreditation Details\n\nLast reaffirmed in 2010, the University of Pittsburgh is regionally accredited through the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE). This is recognized by the U.S. Department of Education and Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education. The Pitt Medical Center is approved by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME). Physical therapy degrees are accredited through the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA). Nursing programs meet the standards of the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE). Social work degrees align with the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE). The rehabilitation counseling program is also granted approval by the Council on Rehabilitation Education (CORE).\n\nUniversity of Pittsburgh Application Requirements\n\nAs an elite AAU member, the University of Pittsburgh has a highly selective acceptance rate of 53 percent. First-year freshmen must be graduating with a diploma from a licensed secondary school. Completing a college-prep curriculum with Honors, AP, and IB classes is encouraged. On average, admitted students have a high school GPA of 3.97. Freshmen also achieve a mean SAT score of 1897 and ACT score of 29. Having no grades lower than \"C\" is necessary. Transfer students can be accepted from other regionally accredited institutions with at least 24 credit hours. Carrying a minimum collegiate GPA of 2.5 is preferred. Non-academic factors like veteran status or significant work experience may be considered.\n\nGraduate applicants to Pitt must already possess a regionally accredited bachelor's degree in a relevant major. For instance, the Medical Center requires a baccalaureate background in the biological, computational, or physical sciences. Most graduate programs mandate a minimum undergraduate GPA of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale, but some require a 3.2. Taking and passing the Graduate Record Exam (GRE) within the last five years is mandatory. GRE scores less than 153 Verbal, 152 Quantitative, and 4.0 Analytical Writing will raise concern. Non-U.S. citizens with a native language other than English must score at least 100 on the iBT TOEFL. Candidates must also exhibit a high level of interest in teaching and leadership positions.\n\nTuition and Financial Aid\n\nFull-time undergraduate students from Pennsylvania will pay $8,646 per term or $17,292 every year. Non-resident undergraduates enrolling full-time are charged $14,029 per term or $28,058 annually. Part-time learners are billed $720 (in-state) and $1,169 (out-of-sate) per credit. Full-time Pitt graduates living in Pennsylvania can expect paying $10,630 per term or $21,260 each year. Non-resident graduate students are charged $17,472 per full-time term and $34,944 yearly. Part-time graduates must afford $858 (in-state) or $1,429 (out-of-state) per credit. The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center specifically costs $50,010 (in-state) and $51,464 (out-of-state) every year. Room and board is estimated to add $11,536 yearly.\n\nApproximately 78 percent of beginning full-time Pitt students earn financial aid. Low-income students often qualify for the Federal Pell Grant or Federal SEOG Grant. In-state residents should apply for the Pennsylvania State Grant, Pennsylvania Chafee Education Grant, or Pennsylvania Postsecondary Education Gratuity Program. There's the Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP) Scholarship too. If needed, students can borrow Federal Stafford, Federal Perkins, Health Professions, or Grad PLUS loans. Federal Work-Study (FWS) is available for 10 to 20 hours weekly. Veterans benefits, tuition waivers, and employer tuition reimbursement programs are offered. Many scholarships are also awarded, including the Stamps Leadership Scholarship, Diversity Scholarship, Chancellor's Scholarship, and Academic Merit Scholarship.\n\nUPMC Aging Institute\n\nHoused in Forbes Tower, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Aging Institute pioneers research that helps older adults live longer, healthier lives. Ranked sixth nationally for NIH funding, the UPMC has proudly been included in America's top 10 hospitals. The Aging Institute brings together world-class researchers, scholars, and clinicians specializing in geriatric care. Partnerships have been formed with the Alzheimer Disease Research Center and Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center. The Aging Institute has built one of the largest portfolios of gerontology research in the country. Cutting-edge studies on topics like dementia, osteoporosis, depression, menopause, grief, and late-life suicide are ongoing.\n\nStudents attending the University of Pittsburgh can become actively involved with the Aging Institute. There's a Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP) offered from May to July at the Medical Center. Students complete intensive, 10-week research experiences under faculty mentors in state-of-the-art labs. It's ideal for students contemplated graduate school in the biomedical sciences. The Aging Institute hosts Research Day each year for students to present findings pertaining to gerontology. Since 2007, there's also been the Pilot Seed Grant Program to award money for innovative, high-risk research in aging.\n\nThrough the Aging Institute and College of General Studies (CGS), it's possible for Pitt students to earn a Graduate Certificate in Gerontology. Requiring just 15 credits, the certificate program gives students from diverse disciplines added knowledge about the aging process. Specialization tracks are offered in Dentistry, Law, Mental Health, Nursing, Occupational Therapy/Rehabilitation, Public Health, and Social Work. Students can earn the certificate with traditional on-campus or online classes. Any University of Pittsburgh Medical Center employees working with older adults could qualify for a scholarship."
