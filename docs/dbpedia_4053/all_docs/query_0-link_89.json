        "text": "Next Article\n\nNew Names. New Faces.\n\nNEW DEPARTMENT ELEVATES TWO IMPORTANT PROGRAMS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe recently approved Department of Community Health Services and Rehabilitation Science is the new home for the undergraduate Emergency Medicine and Rehabilitation Science programs.\n\nThe core mission of the new department is to expand opportunities for education and entry-level employment and to increase access to health care while improving the health of our communities and the nation.\n\nThe change to departmental status reflects the productivity, achievement and potential of the programs’ current faculty, staff, students and alumni. It creates a more defined academic unit and will serve to recruit high-caliber and productive personnel and students in the future.\n\nAssociate Dean for Academic Partnerships, SHRS, and Professor Tom Platt was recently named chair of the new department. Instructor Nicole Cecchini was appointed director of the Emergency Medicine program and Associate Professor Andrea Hergenroeder will lead the Rehabilitation Science program.\n\nCOUNSELING PROGRAM NAME CHANGE.\n\nThe Clinical Rehabilitation and Mental Health Counseling program is now known as Clinical Mental Health Counseling. According to Professor and Program Director Eric Meyer, “This change will enable our program to more intensively focus on training in mental health counseling while still allowing students to pursue optional coursework and field placements in rehabilitation counseling.”\n\nNEW FACES ON CAMPUS.\n\nCOMMUNICATION SCIENCE AND DISORDERS\n\n• Hari Bharadwaj, assistant professor • Leah Fabiano-Smith, professor and director of PhD Program\n\nCOUNSELING\n\n• Michael Pramuka, associate professor\n\nEMERGENCY MEDICINE\n\n• Sarah Johnson, instructor • Christopher Matek, instructor • Sheldon Williams, assistant professor\n\nHEALTH INFORMATION MANAGEMENT\n\n• Ahmad Pahlavan Tafti, professor\n\nOCCUPATIONAL THERAPY\n\n• Avital Isenberg, assistant professor • Cara Lekovitch, assistant professor\n\nPHYSICAL THERAPY\n\n• Peter Coyle, assistant professor • Regan Harrell, assistant professor • Valerie Shuman, assistant professor\n\nPHYSICIAN ASSISTANT STUDIES\n\n• Amy Brown, assistant professor • Julia Dubis, assistant professor • Frances Mulligan, assistant professor • Dipu Patel, professor and vice chair for Innovation\n\nREHABILITATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY\n\n• Ikenna Ebuenyi, assistant professor • Paulina Villacreces, assistant professor\n\nKUDOS!\n\nAwards, grants, commendations—it’s hard to keep up with the many honors bestowed on members of our SHRS community. Every day, in every department, there is news of how they are breaking down barriers, opening up doors and providing innovative ways to improve the quality of life for individuals with disabilities. For up-to-the minute news on the bold moves of our community members, follow SHRS on social media.\n\nWELCOME, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR EBUENYI\n\nIkenna Ebuenyi brings a world of experience to his role as assistant professor in the Department of Rehabilitation Science and Technology (RST). He has spent his career working in mental health and disabilities in Nigeria, London, Amsterdam, Barcelona, Kenya, Malawi and Ireland.\n\n“The inequity in education and employment for persons with disabilities is universal,” notes Ebuenyi. “Even here in the United States, there are opportunities to utilize research to engender policy and community support and socioeconomic empowerment for persons with psychosocial disabilities.”\n\nHe says his previous work demonstrates that persons with mental disabilities can work and desire to work but are often not hired because of cultural perceptions held by employers.\n\n“My plan is to leverage my experiences to pursue research on equity in the use and provision of assistive technology especially for persons with psychosocial disabilities and psychosocial rehabilitation,” he continues.\n\nEbuenyi was hired as part of a $2.8 million school-wide cluster-hire initiative to bring justice, equity, diversity and inclusion change agents into SHRS to train future generations of health care professionals, and to address social determinants of health and health disparities. “We could not be more thrilled to have Ikenna as part of our team, and deeply appreciate the support from Dean Delitto and the senior vice chancellor for the Health Sciences, Dr. Anantha Shekhar, for their support in recruiting him,” says Associate Professor and RST Chair Jonathan Pearlman.\n\n“Ikenna’s work focuses on one of the most critical areas in the disability community, which is to expand access to employment and education,” Pearlman continues. “Using his unique training and experience globally, Ikenna has already made impressive progress in understanding both the opportunities and barriers to expanding access to employment and education for individuals with psychosocial disabilities.” ◼\n\nSHRS CELEBRATES 50TH ANNIVERSARY WITH DISTINGUISHED ALUMNI AWARDS DURING INAUGURAL HEALTH SCIENCES ALUMNI WEEKEND\n\nOn Friday, Sept. 16, the School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences (SHRS) was finally able to come together to celebrate its 50th anniversary of academic excellence at the University of Pittsburgh and to recognize distinguished SHRS alumni on their career achievements. After two years of postponement, faculty and alumni gathered at the University Club in Oakland to reminisce on their time at Pitt and toast to each other’s success.\n\nIf you missed the live event, you can read a full recap of the SHRS 50th Anniversary Award Celebration here.\n\nChange Service Requested\n\nHome sweet healthy home!\n\nFor some people, their home is their castle. For others, it’s where their heart is. But what happens when home is no longer a comfortable—or safe—place to be? When there are many steep stairs from the street to the front door? When there’s no bathroom on the first floor, or doorways and hallways are too narrow to accommodate a wheelchair or other medical equipment? These and other questions will soon be answered in a unique living laboratory located in Oakland, close to the Pitt campus. Known as the Healthy Home Laboratory, this 105-year-old former family residence will soon be transformed into a world-class research and development facility staffed and supported by multiple departments at SHRS and other Pitt programs. The goal is to develop technologies, realworld interventions and best practices that will allow individuals and their caregivers to live healthy and independent lives in their own homes and communities. ◼"
