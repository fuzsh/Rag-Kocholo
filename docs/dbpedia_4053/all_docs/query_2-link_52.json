        "text": "Academics\n\nThere’s a good reason students clamor to attend the University of Pittsburgh every year. After all, the school provides “an amazing balance between an urban and traditional college experience,” along with a “large student body [that manages to] feel small and super connected.” It’s also an institution teeming with resources and opportunities, from scholarships and study abroad to internships and undergraduate research. Student success is a priority, and undergrads have easy access to both career development assistance and tutoring services.\n\nWhen it comes to academics, some students suggest that there’s “a strong lean toward the STEM fields as it is a research university with a medical school.” However, others are quick to highlight the sheer breadth of courses available, “including the history of jazz, love in France, the origins of fashion, Led Zeppelin, and vampires.” Regardless of the class or department, students can expect challenging coursework that will prepare them for their career paths. Much of this can be attributed to “knowledgeable” and “engaging” professors who “know [their] material very well.” And plenty praise their instructors for their accessibility, noting that they truly “make an effort to get to know their students.” As this impressed undergrad sums up, “almost every single one of my professors across all departments has bent over backward to satisfy their students.”\n\nStudent Body\n\nGiven that it’s a large public university, it shouldn’t be too surprising to learn that Pitt has a “student body that’s diverse.” Indeed, the school is a “melting pot of every different type of student you can find.” Though some do argue that it can often feel like most undergraduates hail “from PA, NY, NJ, and OH,” regardless of where they’re from, Pitt students manage to foster “a very encouraging community where everyone wants each other to succeed.” Another undergrad wholeheartedly agrees, adding, “I have been able to meet a lot of incredibly supportive people and surround myself with exceptional student leaders that inspire me to be a better student, friend, and person.”\n\nMany students also bond over the fact that they’re “academically driven” and “enjoy learning.” Additionally, the majority seem to identify as “very socially and politically progressive.” And nearly all of them seem to have tons of “pride in their university.” We’ll give the last word to this undergrad who proudly sums up, “My peers are the smartest, kindest, involved, and motivated people I’ve ever met, and I have all the faith in the world that they will make the world a better place.”\n\nCampus Life\n\nThere is definitely life beyond the classroom at Pitt. To begin with, the university “is always hosting some form of campus-wide program to motivate student engagement.” This can be anything from various dances or bingo nights to flower arranging classes. Additionally, Pitt students are an active lot, and the school’s numerous club sports and intramural leagues tend to draw lots of participants because there are so many options. Students can find everything from club figure skating to volleyball; there’s even a recreational climbing team and a Quidditch team. Don’t sweat it if you’re not into athletics. Pitt also sponsors and organizes plenty of programs such as movie screenings, open mic nights, and art workshops throughout the year.\n\nStudents note that there’s also “a very healthy…Greek [scene] here” for those interested, but there are many other social opportunities too. Finally, undergrads love to venture beyond the confines of the campus and explore the city of Pittsburgh. This is easy to do since students can ride the Port Authority buses for free. Therefore, it’s common to find students heading to the city to try a new restaurant, go shopping, or visit a museum."
