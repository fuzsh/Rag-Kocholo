        "text": "No. ACGME accreditation is a voluntary process programs and the institutions that sponsor them choose to complete. There are residency and fellowship programs that are not accredited by the ACGME. In some cases, this is because the ACGME does not yet accredit a particular specialty or subspecialty. In other cases, programs and/or institutions have opted not to apply for accreditation from the ACGME. Residency programs that are not accredited by the ACGME do not receive Medicare funding from CMS for Direct Graduate Medical Education (DGME) and Indirect Medical Education (IME).\n\nNo. The ACGME only accredits GME programs and the institutions that sponsor them (“Sponsoring Institutions”). The Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) accredits US allopathic medical schools and is sponsored by the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and the American Medical Association (AMA). US osteopathic medical schools are accredited by the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA) of the American Osteopathic Association (AOA)."
