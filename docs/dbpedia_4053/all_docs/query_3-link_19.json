        "text": "Should you switch to chiro? ü§î Traditional medicine isn‚Äôt always what students envision, and exploring alternative paths is more common than you might think. As a medical student, you may already have a strong foundation in science and a passion for helping people. But maybe you crave a more hands-on approach, one that emphasizes natural healing and preventative care. Chiropractic care offers exactly that, and there is a growing demand for healthcare professionals who don‚Äôt have a pill-first mentality. üíä‚ùå üîó See what else a career in chiro can offer: https://loom.ly/UKQydiA #Chiropractic #FutureDoctor #LifeWest\n\nLast Saturday (June 22nd) marked a milestone in the history of Osteopathic Medicine. We are celebrating 150 Years since our founder, Dr. Andrew Taylor Still, first shared his vision for changing the practice of medicine! Reflecting on that vision, I'm proud of how core osteopathic principles‚Äîholistic care, self-healing, and prevention‚Äîare finally being recognized for the value they bring to the practice of medicine. Once rejected and dismissed, Dr. Still's resilience (and ours as a community) has helped to create change in a system that needs improvement. Today, 25% of U.S. medical students are trained in osteopathic principles. A large part of that training occurs in the communities they will serve, including rural and underserved locations across America. Much like Dr. Still in the late 19th century, we find our healthcare system at a crossroads. The principles Dr. Still espoused should resonate more than ever as we choose the direction that best serves society. Our continued growth as a profession positions us well to lead the way in improving care and addressing broader determinants of health, particularly in the sectors of the healthcare system that we have served since our origin. Read more about our journey and future in my article, \"Osteopathic Medicine: 150 Years, and Counting, of Changing the Healthcare Landscape.\" https://lnkd.in/euQuQBrM Together, emphasizing holistic care, self-healing, and prevention, we can improve lives for the next 150 years and beyond! #Osteopathy150 #HealthcareInnovation #MedicalEducation #OsteopathicMedicine #ChooseDO"
