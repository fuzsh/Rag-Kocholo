        "text": "University of Pittsburgh Healthcare Management Programs\n\nThe University of Pittsburgh appears in our ranking of the Top 25 Health Information Management Degree Programs.\n\nDegrees in healthcare management at the University of Pittsburgh are offered by the Department of Health Policy and Management, which has been part of the university since 1950. There are eight programs in health policy and management, and those programs include several graduate degrees, two dual degrees, a doctoral program, and two certificates. Programs are concerned with health services delivery, problems that exist in health policy, patient safety, organizational management of healthcare organizations, leadership, and outcomes measurement. Students who do not yet have a bachelor’s degree have three options for study with two undergraduate degrees and a double degree program in health services and business.\n\nStudents may earn a Bachelor of Arts in Health Services, a Bachelor of Science in Health Services, or enter the double degree program that will reward the student with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration alongside a Bachelor of Arts in Health Services. Students who have already received technical training in an area like anesthesia, radiological technology, or respiratory therapy, as well as many other technical occupations, may be awarded 24 professional education credits for the bachelor of science program. Meanwhile, the bachelor of arts program offers students two areas of focus that include Community Health Assessment or Management Health Services Programs and Projects. Both bachelor’s degrees require students to complete 120 credits.\n\nGraduate and doctoral programs are designed as research-intensive experiences where students pursue work with organizations like the Health Policy Institute (HPI), the Center for Research on Health Care (CRHC), and the Pharmaceutical Economics Research Group. Graduate programs from the Department of Health Policy and Management include a Master of Public Health (MPH), Master of Health Administration (MHA), and a Master of Science in Health Services Research & Policy. Dual degree programs include the Master of Health Administration along with a Master of Business Administration or a Master of Public Health with a Juris Doctor program. Students may also enter the Doctoral Program in Health Services Research & Policy or earn one of two certificates on the topics of health systems leadership & management or health care systems engineering.\n\nThere are additional academic programs offered from the Department of Health Information Management that a student may also pursue for training in health information systems and healthcare management. Degrees include a Bachelor of Science in Health Information Management, a Master of Science in Health Information Systems, a Master of Science in Health Care Supervision & Management, and a Ph.D. in Rehabilitation Science. Students interested in getting into jobs in the field of health information management (HIM) may want to consider these programs that merge business management and information technology within health care systems. Students with an interest in nursing may want to consider the online program in nursing informatics which awards a degree, a minor, or a post-professional certificate.\n\nAbout the University of Pittsburgh\n\nThe University of Pittsburg was established as the Western University of Pennsylvania in 1819, but it existed as a local school called the Pittsburgh Academy in the 1780s. The university operated as a private school for several decades until it was brought into the Commonwealth System of Higher Education in Pennsylvania. The school has more than 28,000 students attending the Pittsburgh campus, as well as through Pitt Online, which offers classes in areas like education, nursing, and computers via online lesson delivery. The university gained fame in the early 20th century when scientist Dr. Jonas Salk used the university’s Virus Research Lab to create the first polio vaccine. The university’s official colors are blue and gold, and the urban campus in the Oakland neighborhood of the city covers 132 acres.\n\nUniversity of Pittsburgh Accreditation Details\n\nThe University of Pittsburgh is accredited by many organizations and is also regionally accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools, Commission on Higher Education. Programs and schools throughout the university are accredited by agencies like the American Chemical Society, the National Athletic Trainers Association, the Council on Education of the Deaf, and the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, Accreditation Council. In the realm of health and human services, programs accredited include the health services administration graduate degree, which is accredited by the Accrediting Commission on Education for Health Services Administration, and the undergraduate health information management program, which is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs.\n\nUniversity of Pittsburgh Application Requirements\n\nProspective undergraduate students at the University of Pittsburgh must submit a completed online application, an application fee of $55, high school information via a Self-Reported Academic Record, and standardized test results. Freshmen applicants must respond to a series of short answer questions that ask the students to think about their intellectual curiosity and how they will work for the public good in their lives. Students aren’t required to submit letters of recommendation. Students who want to enroll in graduate study will contact the school that houses the program to which the student wants to apply. Admissions criteria are similar across most programs, but certain majors require additional materials. Applications for graduate school are handled by the individual graduate and professional schools at the University of Pittsburgh rather than the central admissions office.\n\nTuition and Financial Aid\n\nTuition for students at the University of Pittsburgh varies based on the school a student attends and whether the student is an in-state or out-of-state enrollee. For example, tuition for programs in the School of Arts & Sciences is $18,130 for in-state students and $31,102 for out-of-state students. Students enrolled in the College of Business Administration pay $20,250 if they’re from Pennsylvania or $35,040 if they’re from outside the state. Mandatory fees all on-campus students will pay include a $160 student activity fee, a $260 wellness fee, and a $350 fee for computing & network services. Graduate students at the University of Pittsburgh will also pay tuition based on their program of study and residency status. Students enrolled in full-time study and who are residents will pay $22,846 for programs in the Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences. The tuition amount equals $920 per credit. Meanwhile, full-time students from outside Pennsylvania will pay $38,736 per year or $1,583 per credit."
