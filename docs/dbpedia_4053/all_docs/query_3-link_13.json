        "text": "Research\n\nThe Neuromuscular Research Laboratory (NMRL) is the applied research facility of the University of Pittsburgh's Department of Sports Medicine and Nutrition within the School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences. Â The NMRL also houses the Warrior Human Performance Research Center which was created to study Special Forces Operators and the unique injury mitigation and performance optimization needs of these select tactical athletes.\n\nSince 1990, the NMRL has initiated research in the area of proprioception and neuromuscular control, in an attempt to answer many of the applied questions regarding the role of capsuloligamentous structures and the pathoetiology of joint injury. The objectives of our research are to study comprehensive profiles of an individual's function by evaluating both the sensory and motor characteristics specific to musculoskeletal injury and pathology. Biomechanical and neuromuscular assessments under sports-simulated environments are used to determine specific variables including investigating the influence of weight distribution, muscle function, balance, flexibility, proprioception, gender, aging, and fatigue, as well as the effects of injury, surgery, and rehabilitation on joint stability. Deficiencies in body mechanics and muscle function are used to develop programs not only to improve performance but also minimize injury potential.\n\nCurrently, the main focus of research in the NMRL has been injury prevention and performance optimization in military personnel. Multiple remote research laboratories have been established in military bases across the U.S. to work with several different military groups including the U.S. Army 101st Airborne (Air Assault), Naval Special Warfare Group 2 (SEALs) and Group 4 Special Boat Team 22 (SWCC), and U.S. Army Special Operation Commands (USASOC). These projects are supported through several research grants by the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\nAnother central focus of the departmentâs research is related to the role of exercise and nutrition strategies to enhance wellness while preventing and managing disease.\n\nOne specific focus area is behavioral intervention for the prevention and treatment of overweight and obesityâmore specifically, investigating what individuals can do behaviorally to effect motivation to be physically active and consume a healthy diet, and to this end, relying on the most powerful technologies available for self-motivation and the measurement of oneâs own performance.\n\nÂ"
