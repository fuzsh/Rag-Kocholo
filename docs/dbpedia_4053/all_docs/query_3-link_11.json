        "text": "This degree requires the minimum completion of 33 credits. A comprehensive examination sequence is required following completion of the core coursework. Students must maintain an overall 3.0 GPA in order to be considered a candidate for graduation.\n\nNeuromuscular Physical Therapy, MS\n\nThis program is designed for the practicing physical therapy professional who has already earned an entry-level degree in physical therapy. This post-professional graduate plan of study enables physical therapists to improve their clinical knowledge and clinical skills through a specific program of advanced physical therapy practice and scholarship.\n\nTotal Credits: 33-35\n\nSports Physical Therapy Micro-Credential\n\nMicro-credentials are short stackable courses that are designed specifically to provide students within the Master of Science program with knowledge, skills, and abilities in basic sports physical therapy.\n\nThese are non-credit bearing courses and allow students to learn specialized skills while completing their core degree requirements.\n\nAcute Injury and Illness Management\n\nTherapeutic Exercise and Functional Training for Athletes\n\nReturn to Sport\n\nClick here to learn more!\n\nExamination and Testing Requirements\n\nThroughout the plan of study, a series of written and/or oral-practical examinations are integrated within the formal course work. These examinations are used to determine mastery of the core elements of the plan of study.\n\nThe written examination will be at the levels of \"application and analysis\" and \"synthesis and analysis\" so as to gauge the student's ability to utilize information in their clinical decision making.\n\nThe practical examinations will focus on the clinical application of therapeutic assessment and treatment techniques. Students will be expected to demonstrate appropriate patient handling, awareness of safety issues, application of technique, and decision-making rationale at the level of an advanced clinician.\n\nAdditional Opportunities\n\nThe University of Pittsburgh has rich resources for education. Information about seminars and lectures of interest will be posted in order for students to learn more about specific areas of interest. There are ongoing lecture series and journal clubs available in multiple content areas. New seminars have been added to support foreign-educated physical therapists in their efforts to obtain licensure and prepare for the NPTE examination."
