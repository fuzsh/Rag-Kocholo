Beginning in 1998, the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research mandated that each newly funded Rehabilitation Engineering and Research Center (RERC) hold a state-of-the-science consensus forum during the third year of its 5-year funding cycle. NIDRR&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s aim in formalizing this agenda-setting process was to facilitate the formulation of future research and development priorities for each respective RERC. In February 2001, the RERC on Wheeled Mobility, University of Pittsburgh, conducted one of the first such forums. The scope encompassed both current scientific knowledge and clinical issues. In preparation, expert interviews were carried out to establish the focus for the forum. Because a stakeholder forum on wheelchair technology had recently been held, opinion favored wheelchair seating as the focus and included the following core areas: seating for use in wheelchair transportation, seated postural control, seating discomfort, and tissue integrity management. The aim of this report is to present a summary of the workshop outcomes, describe the process, and increase awareness of this agenda-setting process in order to enhance future participation in a process that critically influences the field of wheeled mobility.\n\nThe purpose of this study was to establish the test-retest reliability and content validity of an outcomes tool designed to measure the effectiveness of seating-mobility interventions on the functional performance of individuals who use... more\n\nThe purpose of this study was to establish the test-retest reliability and content validity of an outcomes tool designed to measure the effectiveness of seating-mobility interventions on the functional performance of individuals who use wheelchairs or scooters as their primary seating-mobility device. The instrument, Functioning Everyday With a Wheelchair (FEW), is a questionnaire designed to measure perceived user function related to wheelchair/scooter use. Using consumer-generated items, FEW Beta Version 1.0 was developed and test-retest reliability was established. Cross-validation of FEW Beta Version 1.0 was then carried out with five samples of seating-mobility users to establish content validity. Based on the content validity study, FEW Version 2.0 was developed and administered to seating-mobility consumers to examine its test-retest reliability. FEW Beta Version 1.0 yielded an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) Model (3,k) of .92, p &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt; .001, and the content validity results revealed that FEW Beta Version 1.0 captured 55% of seating-mobility goals reported by consumers across five samples. FEW Version 2.0 yielded ICC(3,k) = .86, p &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt; .001, and captured 98.5% of consumers&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39; seating-mobility goals. The cross-validation study identified new categories of seating-mobility goals for inclusion in FEW Version 2.0, and the content validity of FEW Version 2.0 was confirmed. FEW Beta Version 1.0 and FEW Version 2.0 were highly stable in their measurement of participants&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39; seating-mobility goals over a 1-week interval.\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to explain the development, methodology, and implementation of an assistive technology (AT) service delivery protocol using a telerehabilitation consultation model for evaluation of remote wheelchair... more\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to explain the development, methodology, and implementation of an assistive technology (AT) service delivery protocol using a telerehabilitation consultation model for evaluation of remote wheelchair prescriptions. The provision of wheeled mobility and seating interventions can be complex when considering people with intricate seating and positioning needs, environmental factors, and wide array of product interventions. The availability of qualified practitioners with specialty expertise in this area is limited, especially outside of urban areas. Therefore, people are potentially isolated from rehabilitation services due to geography or physical limitations. A repeated measure study design is used to evaluate the service delivery protocol measured by the effectiveness of wheeled mobility and seating interventions provided in a remote location by a generalist occupational and/or physical therapy practitioner with consultation from an expert therapist via interactive teleconferencing. Effectiveness is measured by magnitude of change and scored by pre and post scores of the Functioning Everyday with a Wheelchair (FEW) outcome measure tool. Two model programs have been specified and are currently implementing the service delivery protocol. The live interaction has enabled remote therapists the ability to exchange personal and health information to experts in the field from an urban facility. The impact of this service delivery protocol will be augmented as it is to be launched and replicated in three additional sites. Telerehabilitation is a new field that can only be measured by its long-term impact; however, its success can be looked at by its development and implementation into everyday clinical service delivery."
