Students who pursue the OTD program do not earn a Master's Degree.\n\nAll freshmen admitted to Duquesne University's Occupational Therapy program enter the Master's of Occupational Therapy degree tract. In the Fall of the 4th year, students are given the option to declare their intent to earn an Occupational Therapy Doctorate. No additional application to enter the professional phase for either degree is required for students who have declared occupational therapy as their major. Students in the accelerated programs who achieve a a â€˜C' or better in all courses and a 3.0 cumulative GPA in the math and science courses by the end of the pre-professional phase are guaranteed a place in the professional phase of the occupational therapy curriculum beginning in January of the third year of study.\n\nThis graphic reflects the progression through our program for a freshman.\n\nFind out more information about the freshmen admission pathway\n\nOur accelerated pathways to the MSOT and OTD degrees provide you with a BS in Health Sciences after 4 years of full-time study.\n\nIf you chose the MSOT pathway, you will receive your MS degree after an additional 9 months of full-time, post-baccalaureate study.\n\nIf you chose the OTD pathway, you will receive your OTD after an additional 19 months of full-time, post-baccalaureate study. Students who pursue the OTD program do not earn a Master's Degree.\n\nIf you are interested in applying as a transfer student and have not earned your baccalaureate, please visit the Rangos School of Health Sciences transfer page. Please be advised that space in our program is extremely limited and in most semesters we do not offer admission to transfer students. Prospective transfer students must also have a minimum GPA of at least a 3.0, a composite math and verbal SAT score of at least 1,170; or a composite ACT score of at least 24.\n\nFind out more information about the transfer admission pathway\n\nYou may be considered for entry into the Post-Baccalaureate MSOT or OTD program if you've already received a Bachelor's degree in a field other than OT and have satisfied all admission requirements. You can complete the MSOT program in just under 2 years of full-time study, or the OTD program in just 3 years of full-time study.\n\nOur MSOT and OTD programs afford post-baccalaureate students the opportunity to jumpstart their program with prerequisites and foundational courses in the Rangos School of Health Sciences beginning in the Fall. Following that semester, students immediately articulate into the occupational therapy program in the Spring.\n\nPlease note, the overwhelming majority of our students enter our program as freshmen; however, we do accept a few transfer and post-baccalaureate students via OTCAS each year as space allows. The post-baccalaureate programs are rolling admission - we accept qualified applicants throughout the year, and until the class is filled. The sooner you apply, the better your chances will be of gaining admission. Only complete applications can be reviewed. We seek applicants who have demonstrated strong academic performance, active engagement in their community, and a solid record of servant leadership.\n\nIt is recommended that you submit your application by our priority deadline of June 30 each year. After that, applications will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, based upon availability.\n\nFind out more about the post-baccalaureate admission pathway"
