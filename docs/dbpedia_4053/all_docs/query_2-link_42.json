        "text": "We appreciate your interest in the School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences! Through academic research, technology, and rigorous training, we educate the next generation of health professionals who will help others reach their fullest potential. The degrees offered through our Departments prepare our students for health care professions that are increasingly in demand (see the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics). We have over 30 programs at the undergraduate, graduate and doctoral level.\n\nExplore Our Programs!\n\nWe encourage you to contact us if you have any questions. We also invite you to join us at our Fall or Spring Open House. This is an excellent opportunity to learn firsthand about our many programs!\n\nInformation for:\n\nHigh School Students\n\nProspective Undergraduate Students\n\nProspective Graduate Students\n\nProspective International Students\n\nWhat you should know when considering SHRS:\n\nSHRS is an upper division school. What does this mean?\n\nThis means students are required to have a minimum of 60 college credits before entering our undergraduate programs. Each program has a set of “prerequisite courses” that students typically take during their freshman and sophomore years while simultaneously earning general education credits. Students then apply to our programs during sophomore year, roughly after completing 45 credits. Students may be in the process of completing all required credits and admission requirements when applying to SHRS.\n\nHigh school students, do you qualify for a Guaranteed Admissions Program?\n\nHigh school students seeking admission to the University of Pittsburgh for first-year entry should visit and apply through the University’s Office of Admissions and Financial Aid. Incoming first-years have the opportunity to qualify for a number of our “Pitt Guaranteed Admissions Programs” which guarantee students admission into an SHRS graduate or professional program providing they meet all criteria. The first step in qualifying for these guarantees is to identify them in your first-year application to the University.\n\nGraduate:\n\nCommunication Science and Disorders (Audiology/Speech-Language Pathology)\n\nHealth Informatics\n\nOccupational Therapy (OTD)\n\nPhysical Therapy (DPT)\n\nPhysician Assistant Studies\n\nDo you need a specific undergraduate major for each graduate program?\n\nYou'll find that almost any undergraduate background can qualify you for most of our graduate programs. The important thing to remember is that you MUST include courses designated as prerequisites in your undergraduate curriculum and meet all admissions requirements.\n\nWhat should you know as an undergraduate transfer student?\n\nExternal transfer students should visit the University's Office of Admissions & Financial Aid Transfer Student web page. Pitt Connection Guides are available on this site. These guides will help you pick equivalent Pitt courses at area community colleges.\n\nWhat should you know as an international student?\n\nStudents applying to graduate programs from outside the US should allow plenty of time for application processing. Please check each program's admission pages for deadlines and other important information. Also, be sure to visit the University's Office of International Services web site and the SHRS International Applicants page.\n\nWhat type of screening requirements are required for internships, clinical etc.?\n\nSome SHRS programs require the student to complete portions of their education (e.g., fieldwork; clinical preceptorship; internship; practicum) at facilities external to the University to meet requirements for graduation. Many of these external facilities require screening measures such as, but not limited to, background check, child abuse clearance, health appraisal, fingerprint-based background check and/or drug test prior to placement at the facility. The results of these requirements may limit and potentially eliminate placement options for the student which can, in turn, result in an inability to meet graduation requirements. Additionally, conviction of a misdemeanor, felony, or felonious or illegal act may prevent the student from becoming credentialed and/or licensed to practice in the field."
