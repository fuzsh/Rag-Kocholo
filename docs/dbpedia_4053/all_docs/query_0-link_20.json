        "text": "On Sunday, May 1 2016 the Pittsburgh Schweitzer Fellows Program (PSFP) held its annual Commencement to celebrate the accomplishments of its 2015 – 2016 Class of Schweitzer Fellows and to introduce the 2016 – 2017 class. The 2015 – 2016 class of 21 Fellows represented 3 universities from Southwest Pennsylvania and a dozen different disciplines. Collectively, the Fellows provided nearly 3,000 of direct service to more than 6,000 people in our region! PSFP celebrated the accomplishments of these fellows at Commencement, where guest speakers Jim Withers, and Ralph Fucillo spoke to a capacity crowd of more than 200 at the University Club, located in the University of Pittsburgh’s Oakland campus. Jim Withers is the founder of Operation Safety Net, an internationally-recognized leader in street medicine, a 2015 CNN hero, and a co-founder of PSFP. Ralph Fucillo is the President of the DentaQuest Foundation and a former chair of the Albert Schweitzer Fellowship. Dr. Withers told the audience about his experiences providing medical care to the homeless and urged the Fellows to be willing to blaze their own trail in their careers. Mr. Fucillo spoke of dental heath as a social justice issue and reminded those in attendance that everyone has the right to be healthy. PSFP’s vision is of a world in which every person – regardless of race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender identity – enjoys access to quality health care, environmentally safe homes and communities, unqualified respect and avenues for maximizing potential.
