Skidmore, PhD, OTR/L, FAOTA, FACRM, Professor\n\nDepartment of Occupational Therapy, University of Pittsburgh\n\nRehabilitation Institute, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center\n\nLaboratory Description: The Cognitive Performance Laboratory conducts clinical studies examining the associations among cognition, mood, and activities of daily living disability and interventions designed to ameliorate these influences, focusing on two areas. The primary line of research focuses on interventions designed to improve rehabilitation outcomes for individuals with changes in cognition and mood after acquired brain injury (stroke, traumatic brain injury). The secondary line of research focuses on characterizing current clinical and community rehabilitation practices for persons with acquired cognitive impairments and implementing evidence-based practices to optimize patient, provider, and health system outcomes.\n\nLaboratory Projects:\n\nAdapting Daily Activity Performance Through Strategy Training\n\nImplementing Strategy Training in Inpatient Rehabilitation\n\nOptimizing Strategy Training for People with Aphasia\n\nPromoting Community Participation and Health After Stroke\n\nDetection, Assessment, and Rehabilitation of Stroke-induced Visual Neglect\n\nCommunity Participation Following Traumatic Brain Injury\n\nStakeholder-Driven Cancer Rehabilitation Intervention\n\nImplementing Strategy Training in Outpatient Chronic Pain Clinics\n\nPrincipal Investigator: Pamela Toto, PhD, OTR/L, BCG, FAOTA, FGSA, Professor\n\nDepartment of Occupational Therapy, University of Pittsburgh\n\nLaboratory Description: The Productive Aging Laboratory conducts studies examining the implementation and effectiveness of evidence-based programs to reduce disability and promote aging-in-place for older adults. Primary research interests focus on use of behavioral strategies (e.g., goal attainment scaling, self-efficacy enhancing activities) in geriatric prevention programs and on client-centered interventions to reduce disability and prevent adverse events in older adults. Secondary research interests examine client-centered strategies for incorporating increased physical activity into the daily habits and routines of older adults. This laboratory is affiliated and in collaboration with the University of Pittsburgh Healthy Home Laboratory.\n\nLaboratory Projects:\n\nIncorporating Home Environment Exposures Into Assessment Tools for People Receiving In-Home Supportive Care (HUD, CO-I)\n\nExamining the Community Aging in Place, Advancing Better Living for Elders (CAPABLE) Intervention: A Scale-Up Project with Family Caregivers and the Area Agency on Aging (NIDILRR, PI)\n\nModified Application of Cardiac Rehabilitation for Older Adults (MACRO) (NIA, CO-I)\n\nPrincipal Investigator: Angela R. Caldwell, PhD, OTR/L, CLT, Assistant Professor\n\nDepartment of Occupational Therapy, University of Pittsburgh\n\nLaboratory Description: The Pediatric Health Promotion Laboratory conducts clinical studies examining the relationships among early child health and development, family-centered interventions that promote child health, and novel approaches to intervention delivery in the community. Primarily, our research focuses on the development of pragmatic, family-based interventions to advance child performance and enhance development through exploration and play. Interventions are embedded within daily routines and feature innovative approaches to parent-coaching and behavior change. Secondarily, our research focuses on reducing health disparities observed during childhood and the prevention of secondary conditions for children with disabilities.\n\nLaboratory Projects:\n\nDevelopment of an Obesity Prevention Intervention for Young Children with Down Syndrome\n\nFacilitators and Barriers to Health among Young Children with Down Syndrome: FaB Health Ds\n\nPrincipal Investigator: Juleen Rodakowski, OTD, MS, OTR/L, FAOTA, Associate Professor and Chair\n\nDepartment of Occupational Therapy, University of Pittsburgh\n\nClinical and Translational Science Institute, University of Pittsburgh\n\nLaboratory Description: The Prosper in Participation Laboratory conducts clinical studies examining factors that influence independent living for older adults that are at-risk for disability. Factors examined include changes in mood and cognition, as well as informal caregiver support. The primary line of research focuses on the examination of non-pharmacological interventions to support independence among older adults who are at-risk for dementia due to Mild Cognitive Impairment. The secondary line of research examines the needs and potential interventions to support caregivers for individuals at-risk for or with complex disabilities.\n\nLaboratory Projects:\n\nClick here to visit the Prosper in Participation laboratory website!\n\nPrincipal Investigator: Natalie E. Leland, PhD, OTR/L, BCG, FAOTA, FGSA,\n\nProfessor\n\nDepartment of Occupational Therapy, University of Pittsburgh\n\nLaboratory Description: The Rehabilitation Health Services Research Laboratory engages in research that examines healthcare access, quality of care, and outcomes across the care continuum (e.g., post-acute care, long-term care). The primary research focus is on health inequity and includes (a) quantifying current care delivery utilization, practices, and their relationship to desired patient and health system outcomes; (b) exploring the lived experiences of patients, family caregivers, providers, administration, health system leadership, and other key community partners; and (c) evaluating approaches for enhancing the dissemination and implementation of best practices into practice.\n\nClick here to visit the Rehabilitation Health Services Research Laboratory website to learn more about our projects, collaborators, and opportunities to engage with the lab."
