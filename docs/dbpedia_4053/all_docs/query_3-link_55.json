Within 25 years it became part of the University of Pittsburgh and was one of the most cutting-edge medical schools in the region. In 1910, UPSOM was cited by The Flexner Report as the gold standard for University management. Early on, UPSOM was looked up to by medical schools across the country as an exemplary pedagogical institution.\n\nIn 1986, Barbara I Paull published “A century of medical excellence: The history of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine,” which documents the research, practices, and educational advancements of 100 years of UPSOM.\n\nFamous Accomplishments\n\nInnovations at the University of Pittsburgh have contributed to a wide range of technical achievements, including the first ‘heavier-than-air’ aircraft, TV technology that enabled filming on the moon, and the first radio broadcast across the Atlantic Ocean. Here’s a list of notable medical contributions that Pitt and the School of Medicine have given the world.\n\n• The first polio vaccine was developed by Jonas Salk and his colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh.\n\n• Doctor Fisher’s research on breast cancer has led to longer, improved lives for many of those diagnosed with the disease.\n\n• The virus that causes epidemic cancer in HIV/AIDS patients was isolated by Pitt’s Yuan Chang and Patrick Moore.\n\n• More than 17,000 organ transplants have been done by Pitt surgeons, making the city the world’s transplantation capital.\n\n• The protein receptor for insulin was isolated by Dr. Klaus Hofmann at the University of Pittsburgh, who also discovered how peptides bind to proteins.\n\n• CPR was developed by a Peter Safar, a professor of medicine at Pitt.\n\n• UPSOM established the first critical care medicine department in an American medical school.\n\n• Pitt professors William Klunk and Chester Mathis pioneered research to help the early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s, for which they received the Potamkin Prize.\n\n• Professor P.G. Katsoyannis was the first to synthesize insulin, along with his colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh.\n\nCore Values\n\nAccording to Anantha Shekhar, MD, PhD, the Dean of the School of Medicine, Pitt Med values first and foremost leadership, creativity, and compassion. The school’s primary mission is to foster and use top-tier biomedical research and science to improve the health of populations across the globe. Academic integrity, professionalism, and high ethical standards are core pillars of UPSOM’s institutional identity.\n\nWhile Pitt Med’s research credentials are highly prized by the school, patient care is an equally important part of the school’s core values. Students begin working with patients early, and, as with any excellent medical school, compassion and empathy are key elements of the educational process.\n\nPitt’s School of Medicine strives to maintain a diverse student body, and emphasizes recruiting students from underrepresented communities. The Health Sciences Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Department works with students and admissions to amplify the number of professionally trained scientists and physicians from underrepresented backgrounds and communities.\n\nMedical Programs at University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine\n\nPitt Med has a variety of medical programs on offer.

However, many institutions consider certain selection factors more important when assessing candidates. Pitt Med prefers applicants with the following qualities.\n\n• Ability to communicate and interact – Given the amount of collaborative learning environments facilitated in the Pitt Med curriculum, ideal applicants demonstrate a desire to interact with others, as well as strong communication skills.\n\n• Letters from former mentors/faculty – Pitt Med gives special consideration to recommendation letters that give a compelling account of your collaboration skills. If you’ve worked with faculty members on academic or extracurricular projects, prioritize recommendation letters from them.\n\n• Resourcefulness – Leadership, resourcefulness, and creative problem solving are important pillars of UPSOM’s institutional identity. Pitt Med pays special attention to applicants who demonstrate the resourcefulness required to embark on personal projects.\n\nIn additional to this criteria, cultural competency, adaptability, integrity, and more are listed in UPSOM’s selection factors.\n\nUniversity of Pittsburgh Medical School Requirements\n\nHere is a full list of Pittsburgh medical school requirements.\n\n• Recommended areas of study: The Pitt Med Admissions Committee prefers applicants with a strong background in mathematics. They also favor students with a wide range of course work, such as liberal arts students, and those who have studied the social sciences and humanities. As long as the required science course work is met, applicants with non-science majors are regarded positively. The Curriculum Committee also recommends at least on half year of psychology.\n\n• Required coursework:\n\nBiology – 1 full year (including 1 year lab or single 2 credit lab)\n\nGeneral/Inorganic Chemistry – 1 full year (including 1 year lab or single 2 credit lab)\n\nOrganic Chemistry – 1 half year (including 1 half year lab or single credit lab)\n\nBiochemistry – 1 half year\n\nPhysics – 1 full year (including 1 year lab or single two credit lab)\n\nEnglish/Intensive Writing – 1 full year (may include writing intensive classes such as Philosophy)\n\nStatistics – 1 half year (preferably Biostatistics, excludes Calculus)\n\nCourse work that embodies equivalent education may be accepted on a case by case basis.\n\n• GPA and MCAT Scores: UPSOM does not have a required grade point average or MCAT score minimum. Applicants must take the MCAT to apply, and results older than 3 years will not be accepted. If you take the MCAT multiple times, the Admissions Committee will consider the highest score.\n\nWhile there are no hard-line requirements here, excellence is expected. The median GPA for students admitted in 2021 was 3.83. The median MCAT score was 516, and ranged from 492 to 525.\n\nClass Profile and School Rankings\n\nHere are some useful statistics to help you better understand the institution’s standing and expectations.\n\nUniversity of Pittsburgh School of Medicine Class Profile (Acceptance Rate, Demographics, and More)\n\nPitt Med currently has a 2.09% acceptance rate, though this has been as high as 6.02% in recent years. There were 8,601 applicants in 2021.\n\n92% of those admitted to Pitt Med in 2021 had research experience. 87% had clinical shadowing experience, and 86% had medical/clinical community service experience.\n\n64% of new students majored in Science or Math. 25% were under-represented minorities. 58% were female.\n\n41% were in-state residents.\n\nPittsburgh University School of Medicine Rankings\n\nPitt Med ranks #13 for Best Medical Schools: Research, and #34 for Best Medical Schools: Primary Care, according to the 2022 U.S. News & World Report.\n\nUPSOM also ranks:\n\n• #6 in Psychiatry\n\n• #11 in Surgery\n\n• #11 in Obstetrics and Gynecology\n\n• #56 in Most Diverse Medical Schools\n\n• #99 in Most Graduates Practicing in Medically Underserved Areas\n\nAdditionally, the University of Pittsburgh ranks #20 in Top Public Schools.\n\nAMCAS Primary Application and UPSOM Secondary Application\n\nTo apply to medical school, you must complete two applications: a primary and a secondary application. for most institutions, your primary application will be AMCAS. After you submit your AMCAS application, it will be sent to Pitt Med and any other schools you apply to.\n\nPitt Med will provide you with a link to complete their secondary application after you’ve completed the primary AMCAS application.\n\nFor a more in-depth explanation, take a look at our article on understanding the differences between primary and secondary medical school applications.\n\nUPSOM Secondary Application Essay Questions, Sample Answers, and Advice\n\nThe essays you submit on UPSOM’s supplementary application are critical opportunities to communicate your skills and goals in a compelling and engaging manner. Aside from the Pittsburgh medical school requirements, these answers can make or break your application. The Pitt Med Admissions Committee will carefully examine your answers, so take the time and care needed to put your best foot forward.\n\nHere are the essay topics from University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine’s secondary application for the 2021-2022 academic year. We’ve included some example answers and suggestions for how to approach and structure your responses.\n\nFor in-depth tutelage on how to optimize your medical school essay responses, consider IMA’s medical school admissions consulting.\n\nEssay Prompt #1\n\nTell us about a challenging problem you faced and how you resolved it. (Limit your response to 250 words or less.)\n\nWithout preparation, answers to this question can quickly spiral out of control. It’s important to keep your answers confined to a professional or academic setting — the more relevant to challenges you’ll face at Pitt Med and as a doctor, the better. (If you’ve done any voluntary healthcare internships abroad, or have any healthcare related experience, use a story from this.) Explain the setting, the challenge, how you resolved it, and, most importantly, what you learned from the experience.\n\nHere’s an example answer to this prompt. The applicant employs a clear narrative structure and uses their time wisely by highlighting volunteer experience, clinical interests, and personal history. This answer also fits UPSOM’s preference for candidates with collaborative spirits and interpersonal skills.\n\nDuring my sophomore year of college, I volunteered with Women Leaders, an all-girls mentorship group dedicated to promoting confidence and academic success in middle school students. I began to notice that one student had consistently poor attendance. When I talked to her mentor, I learned that the student’s family had recently taken in her grandmother, who suffered from Alzheimer’s.\n\nWhen I was younger, my family took me on weekly visits to see my grandmother, who had been bed-ridden with cancer since I could remember. I didn’t tell this to the student’s mentor, as she had given me a hard time in the past and I was intimidated by her. I felt powerless and frustrated that the mentor wasn’t doing anything to help the student.\n\nI contacted the mentor before the next meeting and told her about my grandmother. The mentor thanked me, and told me it helped her understand the student’s situation. We contacted the student’s parents, who encouraged her to attend the next meeting.\n\nAt the meeting, we veered from our usual agenda and encouraged students and mentors to discuss challenges they were facing. To my surprise, the truant student talked openly about her situation. After that, she continued to attend and participate in the meetings.\n\nThis experience taught me the power of empathy. It also taught me that looking past personal scruples can lead to productive relationships. Finally, it gave me the courage to pursue a career in end-of-life care.\n\nEssay Prompt #2\n\nUPSOM is committed to building a diverse and talented community that will train physicians in delivering culturally competent, person-centered care, and promoting a supportive, collaborative learning environment. To achieve this, we want our fellow students to recognize health disparities and advocate for health equity. We are interested in combating all forms of systemic barriers, and would like to hear your thoughts on opposing specifically: systemic racism, anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination, and misogyny. How will you contribute? (Limit your response to 250 words or less.)\n\nMost applications will have a version of what is called the “cultural competency” question. This is because the medical community understands that underserved populations receive better care when physicians, researchers, and healthcare advocates are diverse and knowledgeable about different perspectives, needs, and challenges.\n\nThis question is quite specific, however. It asks: What will you do to oppose systemic racism, anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination, and misogyny? For candidates without sufficient social science and humanities backgrounds, this can be challenging to answer in a compelling way. Let’s walk through some necessary knowledge about this problem and suggestions for how to answer.\n\n• Systemic oppression, in this case racism, anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination, and misogyny, is the cumulative result of historical, economical, legal, cultural, and sociological discriminatory practices. While individuals are responsible for authoring and perpetuating certain practices, systemic oppression is ultimately a structural phenomenon. This means that systemic oppression happens intentionally and unintentionally, as is the case with discriminatory practices that are seen as “normal” or “just the way things are.” Because of this, the process of unlearning oppressive behavior, listening to marginalized communities, and critically examining institutional norms are essential to recognizing systemic barriers. A competent answer will demonstrate an understanding of what systemic barriers are, as well as the challenge of recognizing them when they don’t affect you.\n\n• Answers to this question could demonstrate openness to critical dialogue for students from privileged backgrounds, or an understanding of intersectionality for those from marginalized communities. Intersectionality is the cumulative effect of multiple forms of discrimination and their unique challenges. (For instance, a gay able-bodied black woman experiences misogyny differently than a heterosexual disabled white woman.)\n\n• Include examples of relevant advocacy, speaking out against discrimination, or your personal challenges with systemic discrimination.\n\n• Include descriptive examples of systemic barriers in the United States healthcare system, such as access to LGBTQ+ friendly healthcare providers or underfunded clinics in communities of color. What role can your specific career play in solving these issues?\n\nEssay Prompt #3\n\nPlease write about anything else you would like to add to your application, or anything you would like to emphasize to the Admissions Committee. (Limit your response to 250 words or less.)\n\n“Anything else?” questions are a wonderful opportunity to discuss other relevant information or go into detail about something you didn’t have the space to elaborate on before. This prompt is very open-ended, but take care to avoid repeating information from your AMCAS or previous responses.\n\nWhen responding to this prompt, considering the following:\n\n• Is there anything more to your qualifications or ambitions that you didn’t have room to address in previous essays?\n\n• What are your other responses missing that prevents you from communicating why you are an appealing candidate?\n\n• Is there anything you previously wrote about that could use additional, relevant details?\n\nInterview Questions and How To Prepare\n\nEvery interview is unique and depends on the institution, the applicant, and the interviewer. Still, there are a few things you should anticipate.\n\nHere are some details about UPSOM’s interview process, as reported by former applicants.\n\n• Number of interviewers: 1\n\n• Length of interview: 45-60+ minutes\n\n• Stress level of the interview: medium to low\n\n• Type of interview: one-on-one and usually closed file\n\n• Interviewees reported few surprise questions and generally found the interview to go as expected\n\nInterview Questions\n\nHere are top reported questions asked in previous Pitt Med interviews.\n\n“Why Pitt Med?”\n\n“What makes you unique?”\n\n“Why a career in medicine?”\n\n“How does your major connect to medicine?”\n\n“What specialty do you want to go into and why?”\n\n“Tell me about your research.”\n\n“Tell me about a time you had to work collaboratively.”\n\n“Have you ever interacted with someone from a culture/group different from your own?”\n\n“Tell me about your volunteer experience.”\n\n“How do you handle stress?”\n\n“How would you talk to a patient that was skeptical of science or the healthcare system (i.e. COVID-19 and mask policies)?”\n\n“What challenges do you think are facing healthcare and medicine today?”\n\n“How have your experiences prepared you for medicine?”\n\n“What are some qualities a physician should have?”\n\n“What is your definition of success?”\n\nHow to Prepare for Your Interview\n\nIn addition to academic excellence, Pitt Med describes the ideal candidate as having great interpersonal and communication skills. The admissions committee looks for creativity, intellect, and compassion. In addition to these qualities, you will also be evaluated based on your knowledge of healthcare in general and your informed enthusiasm for the specialty you’re pursuing.\n\nIt’s normal to feel nervous about this kind of interview — there’s a lot to cover and plenty of things to keep in mind! Don’t worry, we’re here to help. Among other things, this article equips you with a thorough understanding of the school you’re applying to, which is a nice advantage. The admissions committee wants to hear that you are applying to Pitt Med to contribute to and utilize the school’s strengths. By studying the school, you will be able to communicate your ambitions in a way that demonstrates how Pitt Med is uniquely situated to help you succeed.\n\nHere are some things to keep in mind while you’re being interviewed, as well as some preparation strategies.\n\n• Consider medical school admissions consulting. Even those who feel comfortable in interview settings will benefit from mock interviews and structured feedback from medical education experts.\n\n• Throughout the day, practice answering the following interview questions listed above. Note the strong answers you come up with, as well as any questions you tend to fumble with.\n\n• Prepare a small list of good questions for the interviewer.\n\n• Express your enthusiasm for the institution. Go into your knowledge of specific UPSOM programs and accomplishments and why they excite you.\n\n• Answer questions completely and include relevant information, but remain direct. Most of your responses should be 2-4 minutes long.\n\n• Conduct mock-interviews with friends, family, or colleagues.\n\n• Keep things simple and organized the day of the interview. Visit the campus beforehand, have your route planned, and give yourself plenty of travel time.\n\n• Keep in touch with your support network leading up to the interview.\n\n• If you have healthcare experience, such as IMA’s voluntary healthcare internships abroad, work on a compelling, succinct story that encapsulates what you learned.\n\n• Finally, be yourself.\n\nRemember to reflect on what makes you unique and fit for medical school. Take advantage of open-ended questions (such as “tell me about yourself”) by sharing stories that demonstrate your personality and strengths. Think beyond the Pittsburgh medical school requirements and focus on your personal skill set.\n\nAdmissions Consulting and Healthcare Internships\n\nFor students with adequate academic performance and promising MCAT scores, two things still stand in your way when it comes to medical school applications: communicating your strengths and providing compelling healthcare experience. Even the perfect candidate misses opportunities to put their best foot forward when applying or preparing to apply to medical school. It’s a tough process to navigate, especially alone.\n\nWe’re here to help.
