        "text": "Applications for admission to graduate study are processed by Pitt's 14 graduate and professional schools, not by a central admissions office. Financial awards, including graduate student researcher (GSR) positions, teaching fellowships (TFs), teaching assistantships (TAs), graduate student assistantships (GSAs), and other fellowships, are awarded by individual schools or programs, typically as part of an admission offer. Questions about applications, admission criteria (including English proficiency), curriculum, and financial awards should be addressed to the specific school or program.\n\nÂ\n\nInternational students should contact their program directly for admission requirements. Programs may require admitted international students to take additional English-language testing from our English Language Institute. Once an international student is admitted, the Office of International Services will help the student adjust to Pitt, including offering advice for relocating and housing. Many international-student organizations help connect new international students to the University community.\n\nÂ\n\nBeyond ensuring high-quality academic programming, Pitt provides the resources to help our graduate and professional students succeed and engage in the University community. From high-quality health insurance for students holding academic appointments to GPSG-coordinated student representation on University-wide committees, Pitt students can utilize a variety of campus and school resources.\n\nEach August, the Graduate and Professional Student Government (GPSG) welcomes new graduate/professional students to Pitt. The event typically includes featured speakers and a resource fair involving more than 30 Pitt offices and organizations dedicated to helping graduate students get involved in campus life and to providing support that allows students to focus on their studies."
