The Department of Physical Therapy offers a Master of Science in Physical Therapy with a neuromuscular focus.\n\nOur rigorous Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) curriculum integrates didactic education with a rigorous clinical program. Our graduates consistently achieve a near-perfect pass rate on licensing exams and enter the job market with significant internship and clinical experience that sets them apart. Pitt's DPT program is currently ranked 1st in the nation based on the most recent surveys of Best Graduate Schools by U.S. News & World Report. No other program ranks higher within the state of Pennsylvania. Our DPT program is offered in a residential and hybrid format.\n\nThe Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) – PhD in Bioengineering program is a six-year (minimum) program that combines the entry-level DPT leading to licensure as a physical therapist, with a PhD in Bioengineering that will prepare the student to become an independent researcher."
