Enhancing research in the area of disability and the development of new interdisciplinary research teams of disability researchers are some of the most crucial factors that can drive the development improved policies targeting well-being of people with disabilities. There is very little overlap between disability and public health research. Computer Retrieval of Information on Scientific Projects (CRISP) database has only 129 grants mentioning both epidemiology and disability, despite its vast importance.\n\nThe World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) is a classification framework that can serve as a conduit for bridging the disciplines of disability and rehabilitation and public health, as both fields rely on classification tools to document the incidence and prevalence of various condition. Little research has been done in the area of disability classification tools and assistive technology and their applicability for implementation in countries around the world.\n\nAt the University of Pittsburgh, we are forging a link between scientists in public health and rehabilitation sciences. We are working on the development of joint conferences and research proposals with special reference to diabetes and assistive technology, as diabetes is one of the primary causes of long term disability. Our main projected outcome is ultimately the development of a new field of �Public Health Rehabilitation�, where these two important disciplines would finally work together to support improved function and community integration for people with disabilities.\n\nLearning Objectives:\n\nRecognize the need for crossdisciplinary research activities between public health and disability/rehabilitation scientists\n\nIdentify and list the priorities of collaborative research activities between the two disciplines\n\nApply the concepts of crossdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research to the participants' areas of expertise\n\nKeywords: Disability, Disability Policy\n\nPresenting author's disclosure statement:\n\nNot Answered"
