        "text": "Hometown: Lexington, Massachusetts\n\nDouble major: Theater and Economics\n\nActivities and involvement: Commonwealth Honors College, UMass Theatre Guild, UMass Theatre Department\n\nUMass hidden gem: The garden outside Frank is one of my favorite places to visit on a beautiful day. Whether I take a walk through the rows of plants or sit and read a book on one of the benches, it never fails to put me at ease and is always a great way for me to reconnect with nature.\n\nHometown: Pembroke, Massachusetts\n\nMajor: Marketing\n\nActivities and involvement: Commonwealth Honors College, UMass Women in Business Co-director of Professional Events\n\nWhy I chose UMass: I chose UMass because of the extensive support and resources that the university has to offer. I have never once felt under-advised and have always had someone to turn to when I needed guidance. Additionally, UMass offers numerous opportunities for students to thrive, including various clubs, organizations, and support groups on campus.\n\nHometown: Acton, Maine\n\nMajor: Legal Studies\n\nMinors: Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies\n\nCertificate: Reproductive Health and Reproductive Justice\n\nActivities and involvement: Club Swimming, Triathlon Club, Commonwealth Honors College, Pre-Law Club, Legal Studies Undergraduate Board, SBS Rise Mentor\n\nFavorite food location at UMass: I love the wraps at Whitmore Café, a perfect hidden gem in the center of campus!\n\nWhy I Chose UMass: As a transfer student, I was yearning for a school where I could find a strong community for my major, explore more extracurricular activities, continue swimming, and where I could meet someone new every single day. UMass has surpassed every expectation I had, and I have made so many amazing friendships with my peers and professors while also being the absolute happiest version of myself.\n\nHometown: Bourne, Massachusetts\n\nMajor: Electrical Engineering\n\nActivities and involvement: WMUA radio, UMass Wind Energy Club, UMass Outing Club, intramural sports\n\nWhy I chose UMass: I chose to go to UMass because of their top-ranked engineering programs, and how that gives me a smaller, niche community to interact with within the large and diverse campus as a whole. There are so many ways to find your groups while at UMass, but it’s great having the resources of a bigger school. You can really get the best of both worlds at UMass!\n\nHometown: Agawam, Massachusetts\n\nDouble major: Biochemistry and Psychology\n\nActivities and involvement: Commonwealth Honors College, club swim team, Ski and Board Club, lifeguard with Campus Recreation\n\nWhy I chose UMass: UMass was the perfect combination of great academics, great food, low cost, and a vibrant community. There is truly an exciting, fun, and enthusiastic energy at UMass that the students and staff all create. I really enjoy the amount of events, activities, and resources that are offered to students on campus, and even in the surrounding area. There is always something to do, and new things to experience.\n\nHometown: Uxbridge, Massachusetts\n\nMajor: Environmental Science\n\nActivities: Commonwealth Honors College, undergraduate research assistant in the Stockbridge School of Agriculture, EnviSci peer advisor, gallery attendant for the Student Union Art Gallery, UMass Dynamics Acappella, Forestry Club\n\nUMass hidden gem: The outdoor areas around Central and Orchard Hill Residential Areas. I would consider the Durfee Conservatory a must-visit when at UMass, but the gardens and orchards surrounding the greenhouses are just as beautiful. The rhododendron garden across the street is also a great place to check out, especially because you can find some trees and shrubs that make up UMass’s arboretum. Lastly, Prexy’s Ridge is the only old-growth forest in Massachusetts found on a college campus and has awesome trails to explore.\n\nHometown: Alameda, California\n\nDouble major: Sport Management and Marketing\n\nActivities and involvement: McCormack Student Leaders Club (MSL), RAP resident as a freshman, intramural sports\n\nWhy did you choose UMass?: I chose UMass for a wide range of reasons, but the biggest reason I chose it was to have the opportunity to be a part of the most prestigious and best Sport Management department in the country. After taking part in the summer program that the department puts on every year, I knew I wanted to be in the McCormack Department for my undergraduate years. Two tour guides who also are Sport Management majors were kind enough to talk to me before I officially made my college decision and their enthusiasm about the department, the tour guide job, and UMass as a whole solidified my choice to come to UMass.\n\nHometown: Arlington, Massachusetts\n\nDouble major: Psychology and Community Education & Social Change\n\nActivities and involvement: Commonwealth Honors College, Habitat for Humanity, CHAARG, Outing Club, intramural sports\n\nWhy I chose UMass: I chose the University of Massachusetts Amherst for the affordable tuition, their high ranking as a public university, the large student population, and access to a large university's resources. My acceptance to the Commonwealth Honors College is another reason that I chose UMass, with its tight-knit community and smaller class sizes. UMass has something for everyone, and I truly couldn’t be happier with my decision to come here.\n\nHometown: Westborough, Massachusetts\n\nMajor: Psychology with a certificate in Criminal Justice\n\nActivities and involvement: Residential Service Desk (RSD), UMass Transfer Residential Academic Program (Rap), Best Buddies club, Criminal Justice Club, intramural field hockey, basketball, volleyball, and co-ed flag football\n\nFavorite food location at UMass: My favorite dining hall at UMass is Hampshire Dining Commons, or more commonly known as Hamp! I love the layout of Hamp, the variety of food choices, and the huge open windows that overlook the Southwest horseshoe. Not to mention, they have the absolute best oat-ly self serve ice cream for the perfect sweet treat after a well-balanced meal. I always put chocolate sprinkles, caramel sauce, coconut flakes, and crushed up Butterfinger candy pieces on my oat-ly…wow I am hungry now!\n\nHometown: Quincy, Massachusetts\n\nMajor: Kinesiology\n\nActivities and involvement: The Body Shop on campus, physical therapist aide and personal trainer off campus\n\nWhy I chose UMass: I chose UMass because despite how big and intimidating the size of the school may be, the environment and community felt so welcoming and so easy to find my place in! I transferred here from a much smaller school but the liveliness of the campus and extensive opportunities for involvement made the large campus and thousands of students so much easier to navigate. Something that has always stood out to me was how welcoming and kind the entire community at UMass is, both staff and students. This is something that truly can make or break a college experience — for me here at UMass, it made it! Beyond this the classes specifically for my major, kinesiology, were very extensive for several career path outcomes and had exactly what I was looking for! Academic-wise, the transfer process was seamless making my transfer process easier than I ever expected!\n\nHometown: Belford, New Jersey\n\nDouble major: Geography (GIST) and Sustainable Community Development\n\nActivities and involvement: Commonwealth Honors College student ambassador, International Scholars Program, New Student Orientation and Transitions Office, Student Alumni Association, intramural soccer and volleyball, Jewish Student Union (JewMass)\n\nFavorite UMass tradition/event: My favorite UMass Tradition is the Commencement Ball. Every May, senior students are able to attend this formal gala in the Mullins Center to celebrate the success of their undergraduate journey. It is like prom, but for college students! As a member of the Student Alumni Association, I was able to help plan and decorate for this highly anticipated event during my first year at UMass! It was extremely rewarding seeing the final product of my club’s hard work.\n\nHometown: Milan, Italy\n\nMajor: Animal Science\n\nMinor: Art History\n\nActivities and involvement: Animal Science/Pre-vet club, Animal Science RAP\n\nFavorite food at one of the dining commons: My favorite food here at UMASS is the chocolate chip banana bread. It can be found in all of the cafes on campus and on special occasions in the dining halls. It is the perfect snack during a study break or in the morning, especially if paired with coffee. It just never disappoints.\n\nHometown: New York, New York\n\nDouble major: Legal Studies and Environmental Refugee Displacement (BDIC)\n\nActivities and involvement: Commonwealth Honors College, UMass Minuteman Marching Band, intramural soccer, volunteer work at Not Bread Alone Soup Kitchen (CESL Program)\n\nUMass hidden gem: Definitely the courtyard behind Thompson Hall facing the Campus Center Parking Garage. It’s a great outdoor study space that’s tucked away from the main campus walkway just enough that it’s the perfect environment to concentrate in. In the spring, the cherry trees in the courtyard bloom, and you can tuck yourself up underneath the petals on a lawn chair and just relax. I highly recommend!\n\nHometown: North Bergen, New Jersey\n\nMajor: Sport Management\n\nActivities and involvement: Association of Diversity in Sport, McCormack Sport and Analytics, Laboratory for Inclusion and Diversity in Sport, mentee for the Boston Celtics for Corporate Partnerships\n\nWhy I chose UMass: I chose UMass because they wanted me for me, and they accepted what I did inside and outside of the classroom! I am really glad I ended up coming here!\n\nHometown: East Longmeadow, Massachusetts\n\nDouble Major: Linguistics and Communication Disorders\n\nActivities and involvement: Commonwealth Honors College, Period Movement, UMass Permaculture Initiative, Outing Club\n\nUMass hidden gem: Greeno Sub Shop! Located in the basement of Greenough Hall in Central Residential Area, Greeno Sub Shop makes the best grilled cheese sandwich at UMass. Along with Greeno, UMass has a number of completely student run businesses, all of which serve amazing food and are run by your peers (which makes it that much cooler). The menu and atmosphere of Greeno is just the best, and is 100% worth walking up the hill for.\n\nHometown: Rehoboth, Massachusetts\n\nDouble Major: Art and Education\n\nMinor: Art History\n\nActivities and involvement: Art Club, Museum Club, Crochet Club, Ski Club, Outing Club, House Council\n\nFavorite food location at UMass: My favorite food location at Umass is Sweets & More. I go there almost every week and I love supporting them since they are a student-run business. Sweets & More always has new and different themed foods based on holidays or what is happening on campus, and I always get excited to see what new desserts they have each month. My favorite things to get are the shamrock shake for St. Patrick's Day and the caramel apples for Halloween.\n\nHometown: Topsfield, Massachusetts\n\nMajor: Political Science\n\nActivities and involvement: Cru, Club Tennis, 91.1 WMUA Amherst, Outings Club, and intramural soccer, flag football, basketball, and volleyball\n\nUMass hidden gem: The Post & Bean Café in the Olver Design Building is one of my favorite places to study! It has tons of big windows, really great architecture, and faces west, so it’s a great place to see the sunset! Every time I’m there, I grab a latte and set up by the window to grind out my homework.
