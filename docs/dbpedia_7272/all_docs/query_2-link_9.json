        "text": "\"The entire premise of the movie is that Bruce grew to resent and hate God, so God gives Bruce his powers to prove that being 'almighty' is harder than it looks — but let's look at the situation objectively:\n\nSatan would see a much greater opportunity in a mortal growing to hate God. That would allow him to tempt and manipulate the person more than normal. Not only that, but God is supposed to be omnipotent, whereas the being that Bruce met had clearly defined limitations (related to free will). Also, the things that Bruce used the given powers for made me question if they came from God. He made a monkey crawl out of a guy's butt (then jump back in) and, in a deleted scene, he lit Evan Baxter on FIRE with a look of pure maliciousness!\n\nBruce's abuse of these powers eventually caused the city to descend into absolute chaos. I highly doubt that God would allow so many people to get hurt just because one news anchor had a crisis of faith?\n\nSo, my theory is that Morgan Freeman's character is not God at all, but Satan. The story makes much more sense if you think of Freeman's character as some kind of evil demon giving Bruce exactly what he wished for and taking pleasure in the chaos that ensued. I think he just happened to accidentally renew Bruce's faith in the process.\"\n\n—u/MasterLawlz\n\n\"When Harry put on the hat, it mentioned all of the houses as options, but Slytherin in particular. Harry got into Gryffindor because he asked. He didn't specifically ask for Gryffindor, but he ruled out Slytherin, and didn't fit in the other two houses. Same for Hermione: We find out in the books that the hat actually wanted to put her into Ravenclaw, but she asked for Gryffindor.\n\nWhen all of the Gryffindors first come in, none of them actually seem to have the main trait of the house (bravery): Neville is cowardly, Ginny is shy and meek, etc. Whereas, with the other houses, you can tell who belongs in them right away: Malfoy is clearly arrogant and cunning, Luna is clearly clever, etc.\n\nSo, my theory is that Godric Gryffindor set up the Sorting Hat purposefully so that it would never simply choose Gryffindor.\n\nThink about it! We know that the Sorting Hat will sometimes shout out a house instantly, but we never see this occur with Gryffindor. So the test for Gryffindor isn't if someone is brave already, it's if they have the bravery to make this massive choice for themselves.\"\n\n—u/EquivalentInflation\n\n\"In the opening scene, you see Michael spying on Judith and her boyfriend. The boyfriend pulls out a clown mask to spook Judith. A minute later, Michael picks up that mask and wears it when he kills her.\n\nBUT — when we cut away to finally reveal the boy behind the mask — he's in a full-body clown costume. It seems as though the mask was a part of his outfit all along...So, why did Judith's boyfriend have it instead of Michael?\n\nObvious answer: The bratty teens stole Michael's mask as a joke to mock him.\n\nGiven this mask's prominent role in the scene — and his mask's massive role throughout the series as a whole — it makes sense that this would be the final straw that pushed Michael over the edge. After all, it wouldn't take much for the personification of evil itself.\"\n\n—u/SpideyFan914\n\n\"Obi-Wan is dueling his apprentice, Anakin Skywalker. Obi-Wan is one of the premier duelists of the Jedi Order, and taught Anakin everything he knows about the art.\n\nEventually, they are dueling on top of some scrap metal floating on a lava river. We see that the river is leading to a lava-fall, and so the duel must end here one way or another. Obi-Wan leaps from the scrap to an embankment of volcanic gravel and turns back to Anakin, who is now stuck on the aforementioned scrap. Staying on the scrap is suicide. Jumping onto the gravel below Obi-Wan entails high risk, as the lava river continues to rise. Even if he were to land the jump, the duel would not be over and Anakin would be at a disadvantage\n\nBut there is a third option: To jump over Obi-Wan. As we know, Anakin took this path despite Obi-Wan pleading with him not to and (spiritually) died there on Mustafar, becoming Vader.\n\nSo, why did Anakin think to jump over Obi-Wan? Well, to answer that we have to look back at another duel: The first duel between Obi-Wan and Darth Maul. At the end of this duel, Maul has killed Qui-Gon Jin and has effectively defeated Obi-Wan. He stands above the then-Padawan, who dangles over a pit. Maul is overconfident, and lets Obi-Wan marinate in hopelessness. Using the force, Obi-Wan then leaps out of this hole and summons his fallen master's lightsaber. In mid-air, he ignites the green blade and bisects Maul.\n\nPretty heroic, right? Sounds like the kind of story that literally every Jedi ever would be asking Obi-Wan to tell over and over again.\n\nOf course Anakin would have heard this story, but — every time Obi-Wan retold that duel — I think he saw a different outcome. This time, Maul doesn't turn around to face him, he simply turns his lightsaber around and impales Obi-Wan on it in mid-air. He likely never confided in Anakin his fears of that movement's failure, since he'd hyped the story up so much. If he said anything, it was probably that the move was 'too brash' or 'too risky' to duplicate, but Anakin was never a good listener.\n\nSo, Obi-Wan turned to Anakin and said 'It's over, I have the high ground' because he, just like Anakin now, had once been in a position where success required a massive vertical leap over your opponent, and he now understood the risk that move entailed and how he could counter it.\n\nObi-Wan then begged Anakin not to jump, saying, 'Don't try it,' but Anakin, in his hatred and overconfidence, felt Obi-Wan's fear and thought he had finally found a situation where he could best his master, using his master's own move against him.\"\n\n—u/SainttecWalker\n\n\"In Parasite, the architect that built the house was named 'Namgoong.' They never say his last name and we never see him, so we don't truly know who he was. In the movie, they make a big deal about his architecture, specifically the bunker, so he has experience with security design and planning.\n\nIn Snowpiercer, we meet a man named 'Namgoong Minsu,' the security specialist who designed all the door systems on the train. They use him to get to the front of the train by making him disable the door locks.\n\nMy theory is, basically, that the 'Namgoong' in both movies is the same person. That is, Namgoong Minsu in Snowpiercer designed the house in Parasite.\n\nHe already had the security knowledge to create the hidden door for the bunker of the house, and we know that he was popular, so it would make sense that, in the future, Wilford would hire a man of good renown to design the doors on the train. Maybe in exchange for free passage or something of the like?\"\n\n—u/blueliger2\n\n\"When Casper was asked if he remembered his past, he said 'No.' The explanation for this was simply that, when you die, 'life doesn't matter that much anymore.'\n\nThe movie also explained that, if you became a ghost, it meant that you had 'unfinished business.' This was mentioned several times throughout the movie.\n\nBUT, Dr. James Harvey lost his wife and she did NOT become a ghost because, as she specifically states, she had 'no unfinished business.' This was, frankly, kind of rude when you consider that she died PREMATURELY, leaving behind a loving husband and teenage daughter who needed her. So, I don't buy that she had no unfinished business.\n\nAlso, if you die and become a ghost, you forget about your life. The fact that you forget your life when you become a ghost is cruel considering passing on/getting into heaven requires you to remember it.\n\nSo my theory is that — instead of it being 'unfinished business' — everyone who becomes a ghost is an asshole and everyone who was a good person went straight to heaven (despite surely having unfinished business).\"\n\n—u/shahkabra\n\n\"This theory isn't about the movie Joker (2019), but more about the Joker as a character in GENERAL across all media:\n\nAnyway, in the Batman: Arkham City video game, the Joker's plan is to donate his toxic blood to hospitals all across Gotham, which will infect people with his 'disease.' In the game Batman: Arkham Knight, we see at least three different people who have been infected with the Joker's blood.\n\nNow, it's been a while since I've last seen gameplay for Arkham Knight, but I believe the infected people start to behave EXACTLY like the Joker and take on his psychotic mannerisms while wearing clown-like face paint.\n\nAlso, in an old Batman comic, Batman sits upon the 'mobius chair' — a chair that gives you the ABSOLUTE TRUTH. He asks the chair what the Joker's true identity is, and it's revealed that there have actually been three different 'Jokers.' A bit odd that three different people look and act exactly like the Joker to the point that Batman — the world's greatest detective — couldn't tell, wouldn't you agree?\n\nSo my theory is that 'the Joker' isn't a person at all, but rather...a poison. A toxin. What we know as 'the Joker' is just a side effect that happens when you get exposed to that specific toxin.\"\n\n—u/blue4029"
