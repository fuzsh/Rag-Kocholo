When you purchase your ticket from ArtTix, you know that it is priced correctly, the ticket is legitimate, and that you will get the help you need if your ticket is lost or stolen.\n\nWhat are ArtTix Authorized tickets and why is this important?\n\nAn ArtTix Authorized ticket is one that is purchased directly from ArtTix or from the organization presenting an event at any of our venues. Buying your tickets directly from either ArtTix or the event presenter are the only two ways to ensure your tickets are 100% guaranteed legitimate and priced correctly.\n\nBuyer Beware! If you purchase tickets from any other seller you may pay well over face value and could be charged additional, exorbitant fees. In addition, ArtTix is unable to guarantee your seat and cannot offer any assistance should your tickets get stolen or lost.\n\nWhere can I buy ArtTix tickets?\n\nIn person at our ticket offices at Abravanel Hall, Capitol Theatre, Eccles Theater or the Rose\n\nBy phone at 801-355-ARTS\n\nOnline at arttix.org or saltlakecountyarts.org, open 24/7/365\n\nTicket office and phone hours: Monday – Friday from 10 to 6, Saturdays from 10 to 2\n\nWhat payment methods do you accept?\n\nArtTix accepts cash, ArtTix gift certificates, and American Express, Visa, MasterCard, or Discover.

These seats are available at all of our venues and can be purchased at all points of sale – at the ticket window, by telephone, and online.\n\nIf you would like to talk with someone about wheelchair seating, curbside assistance or any of our other accessibility accommodations, please call ArtTix at 801-355-ARTS (2787); toll-free at 1-888-451-ARTS (2787); or at 711 for Telecommunications Relay Service (TRS).\n\nWhen purchasing a wheelchair space, you acknowledge that you or a member of your party requires accessible seating. You are also able to purchase up to three companion seats at the same price for the same performance. You may receive a follow-up call from the ticket office regarding accessible seating transactions. The purchase or use of these seats by non-disabled patrons is prohibited and will result in seat relocation or forfeiture of the ticket and any ticketing costs.\n\nAll Salt Lake County Arts and Culture venues are accessible to people with disabilities and offer wheelchair seating, curbside assistance, and assisted listening devices. Other accommodations are available on request, including ASL interpretation and captioning services; these require a six-week lead time.\n\nWho decides the ticket prices?\n\nEvent presenters own their tickets and determine the ticket prices. In addition, they set any presales, public on-sale dates, inventory, and any other ticketing policies related to their specific event. ArtTix is the Authorized ticketing agent for the event presenters and we are bound by their requirements.\n\nAre there ticketing fees?\n\nYes, there are fees attached to each ticket purchased through ArtTix.\n\nService fees – charged on all tickets and include Presenter and credit card fees\n\nPreservation Fund – charged on tickets for Abravanel Hall, Capitol Theatre, and the Rose\n\n$1 per ticket at the Rose and on tickets that are $15 or less at Abravanel Hall and Capitol Theatre\n\n$2 per ticket that is priced at $15.01 or more at Abravanel Hall and Capitol Theatre\n\nFacility Fee – charged on tickets for Eccles Theater\n\nArts for All fee – charged on tickets for Eccles Theater\n\nHow many tickets can I buy?\n\nOur standard practice is to allow 8 tickets per transaction. Event presenters may increase or decrease ticket purchase limits at their discretion.\n\nCan I get a refund or exchange my tickets?\n\nArtTix does not refund or exchange any tickets. Before you finalize your ticket purchase please confirm you have the correct date, time, and seat numbers.\n\nMy tickets are lost or were stolen, what can I do?\n\nIf you purchased an ArtTix Authorized ticket, please contact our ticket office and we will reprint your tickets for you. Your reprinted tickets will be at will call and the original purchaser must show valid picture ID to pick up the tickets. If you purchased your tickets from a third party seller, we are unable to assist you.\n\nHow do I get my tickets if I buy online or on the phone?\n\nWe have three options for delivery:\n\nPrint-at-home tickets\n\nU.S. Mail\n\nWill Call pickup\n\nSome event presenters may limit delivery options and this will be clearly noted by event.\n\nIf I buy tickets online or by phone, will I receive an order confirmation?\n\nYou will receive an email order confirmation once your online or telephone purchase is complete. Please save this in case you have any issues, it contains your specific order number. If you do not receive a confirmation, please contact ArtTix right away to confirm your purchase was completed.\n\nWhat if my event is cancelled or postponed?\n\nOccasionally, performances are canceled or postponed. If this happens ArtTix will notify you by phone or via email about the refund or exchange procedures for that performance. The event presenter may also notify you via email about the cancellation or postponement. If you purchased your ticket with a credit card through ArtTix, we will automatically issue you a refund for the ticket price and any fees (except any delivery fees) on that credit card. If you purchased tickets with cash, you will need to come to an ArtTix ticket window for your refund. If an event is moved or rescheduled, the event provider may set refund limitations. Be sure to contact ArtTix for details or a refund. Any expenses that you incur in connection with a canceled or postponed event are your own responsibility, not that of ArtTix.\n\nAre there any admission requirements?\n\nAll patrons must have a ticket for entry. Our minimum age recommendation is 8 years old unless otherwise specified by the event presenter and no babes-in-arms. Late seating is available at most events; however, you may not be seated until an appropriate break in the performance. At some events there is no seating after curtain time, please confirm this at the time of purchase. If your ticket is fraudulent, damaged or defaced, reported lost or stolen, or are not purchased from an authorized seller, entry may be refused.\n\nIs there stand-by ticketing?\n\nStand-by ticketing is at the discretion of the event presenter. Stand-by tickets are normally offered for selected performances that have a no-late seating policy. Stand-by tickets can be sold to fill seats of late patrons and any unsold tickets. All patrons must be ready to be seated 5 minutes after performance start time. Tickets for patrons not seated at least 5 minutes after the performance start time will become invalid and non-refundable. Stand-by ticket does not guarantee a seat or seating together and it cannot be used for admittance to any other performance other than the date/time printed on the ticket. Any stand-by ticketed patrons who are not seated for the performance must return to the ticket office immediately and present their stand-by ticket for a full refund.\n\nThe Fine Print\n\nThese ArtTix Purchasing Policies are designed to ensure your understanding of, and satisfaction with, the purchase process on the ArtTix website and the ArtTix app. By purchasing tickets through the ArtTix website and the ArtTix app, you agree to be bound by these policies. These purchase policies may change at any time, and such changes shall be effective upon posting. You agree to be bound by such changes when they take place.\n\nBilling Information Verification\n\nOrders are processed only after a billing address, and other billing information has been verified. Occasionally, we receive incorrect billing or credit card account information for a ticket order that can delay processing and delivery. In these cases, ArtTix customer service will attempt to contact you, using the information provided at the time of purchase. If we are unable to reach you after our initial attempt, we may cancel your order without further notice.\n\nPricing and Other Errors\n\nIf the amount you pay for a ticket is incorrect regardless of whether because of an error in a price posted on this Site or otherwise communicated to you, or you are able to order a ticket before its scheduled on-sale or presale date or you are able to order a ticket that was not supposed to have been released for sale, then we have the right to cancel that ticket/order and refund the amount paid.\n\nLimitation of Liability\n\nYou voluntarily assume all risks incidental to the event for which the ticket is issued, whether occurring before, during or after the event, and you waive any claims for personal injury or death against us, management, facilities, artists, other participants, and all affiliated entities, agents, officers, directors, owners and employees on behalf of yourself and any accompanying minor. You bear all risks related to weather. See the Limitation of Liability section in the Terms of Use for additional limits on our liability."
