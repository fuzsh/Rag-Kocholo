        "text": "I’m a 46 year old, living in Norwich, UK. I have a PhD in Film, Television and Media. My published works include guides to the music of Elvis Presley and Bobby Darin, as well as a monograph on early queer cinema. I am also the author of the young adult novels Breaking Point and Breaking Down, both of which deal with the subject of homophobic bullying and its aftermath. My adult novels are The Successor and The Pied Piper, both of which are set in my native Norfolk.\n\nI have also published articles and chapters on the reception of Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi, and silent horror films (both with Mark Jancovich); the silent film star Jack Pickford; queer silent cinema; queer horror movies; the first African-American director, Oscar Micheaux; the teen TV series Kyle XY; representations of bipolar disorder in the TV series Rookie Blue; and depictions of racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism in the works of Agatha Christie.\n\nPlease visit my blog on mental health issues in the media: http://mentalhealthmediame.wordpress.com/\n\nMy twitter account is: @shanebrown74"
