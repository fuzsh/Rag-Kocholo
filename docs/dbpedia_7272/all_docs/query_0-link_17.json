Broke and hungry, he steals money off of a painter. The painter, however, takes pity on him and decides to help him get his life back together.\n\nA naive young man, raised poor in a small town, comes to New York City to make his fortune. Overwhelmed by the city's hustle and bustle, and entranced by the rich and sophisticated high-society types he comes into contact with, he eventually finds himself caught up in the city's seedy underworld.\n\nBecause her father has strict ideas about what clothing she should wear and with whom she should associate, Anna Hedder leaves home and takes up residence with two girl friends. She meets Madeline Wallace, whose father is extremely lenient, but he soon discovers that she is becoming too indiscriminate in her associates; Madeline rebels, and she is enticed to Anna's apartment by Reynolds, an old roué, while the girls are out. Anna and her friends return in time to save Madeline's reputation. Madeline, having learned her lesson, returns to her father; and Anna's father, having softened his attitude, persuades her to return home too.\n\nGloria, the daughter in a wealthy family, has finally spent most of her father's money. She marries Tony, whose as much of a reckless spendthrift as she is, and they continue indulging themselves. Tony's wealthy grandfather Adam Patch dies, but to their surprise he leaves Tony nothing. The couple try their hands at actually working for a living, but they don't like it and return to their spendthrift ways. Something has to give, and it soon does.\n\nWhen a smart-aleck street kid's police officer father is killed in the line of duty, the boy turns over a new leaf and goes to work to support his mother, brothers, and sisters. He gets a job as an usher in a theater, but really wants to become a police officer to avenge his father's death. He soon finds himself involved in a fake kidnapping, real gangsters, and a tip on the identity of the man who killed his dad.\n\nA beautiful secretary has her pick of the men in the office, but instead of marrying the boss, she takes one of his junior staff. Later, when she is suspected of committing a murder, her husband confesses to it--although he didn't do it--in order to protect her. Complications ensue.\n\nA German Shepherd puppy is \"adopted\" by a wolf pack in the snowy and frozen Great North and raised by them as one of their own. A few years later he comes upon a fur trapper and saves the man from certain death, and begins to feel a kinship with him that is stronger than the one he has with his adopted pack.\n\nBrick Hubbard, a \"printer's devil\", convinces his friend Sid Fletcher to invest in \"The Gazette\", a local newspaper. Sid pens an editorial that infuriates Ira Gates, a local banker and a power in the town--and who also happens to be the father of Vivian Gates, whom Sidney is in love with. To complicate matters, the bank is robbed and Sidney is suspected of the crime.\n\nStephen Lee doesn't want his nephew Wally Sanders to marry chorus girl Violet Dayne, because he believes all chorus girls to be ruthless gold diggers, always chasing after the men's money. Violet's friend Jerry La Mar decides to 'gold dig' Stephen, to show him what a nice and unselfish girl Violet is, but then she realizes that she's really in love with Stephen Lee...."
