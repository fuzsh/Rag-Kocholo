        "text": "01 of 12\n\nJonathan Taylor Thomas as Young Simba\n\nThe '90s teenage heartthrob, who voiced young Simba, continued to thrive in his acting career after the animated film hit it big at the box office. Jonathan Taylor Thomas went on to star in films like Man of the House (1995), Tom and Huck (1995) and I'll Be Home for Christmas (1998), and most famously played middle child Randy Taylor on the sitcom Home Improvement.\n\nHearts broke worldwide when Thomas stepped away from the spotlight during the height of his career. The actor expressed that he had worked long enough and wanted to pursue other interests.\n\n\"I'd been going nonstop since I was 8 years old,\" Thomas told PEOPLE in a 2013 interview. \"I wanted to go to school, to travel and have a bit of a break.\"\n\nAfter attending Harvard, Columbia University and St. Andrew's University in Scotland, Thomas returned to Los Angeles, where he currently resides. He also directed his Home Improvement on-screen dad, Tim Allen, on three episodes of Last Man Standing and appeared in four as an actor.\n\n02 of 12\n\nMatthew Broderick as Adult Simba\n\nBy the time he played adult Simba, Broderick's voice was already recognizable, thanks to the classic 1986 film Ferris Bueller's Day Off, for which he earned a Golden Globe nomination.\n\nSince The Lion King's 1994 release, Broderick has also starred in Election (1999), The Stepford Wives (2004), The Producers (2005), Tower Heist (2011), Manchester by the Sea (2016) and Lazy Susan (2020).\n\nBroderick has been married to actress and fashion icon Sarah Jessica Parker since 1997.
