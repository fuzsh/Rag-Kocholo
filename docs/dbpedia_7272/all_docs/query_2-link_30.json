It looks at American ilm history from the 1890s through the spring of 2011, but it does not always explore this history in a purely chronological way. In fact, it is not (strickly speaking) a history. Rather, it is a cultural history, which focuses more on topics and issues than on what happened when. It begins with a proile of classical Hollywood cinema as a unique economic, industrial, aesthetic, and cultural institution. It considers the experience of moviegoing; the nature of Hollywood storytelling; and the roles played by the studio system, the star system, and ilm genres in the creation of a body of work that functions not only as entertainment but as a portrait of the relationship between an American national identity and an industrialized mass culture that has slowly evolved over the past century. This book assumes that the reader has little or no formal training in ilm history, theory, or aesthetics. It presents fairly basic concepts in such a way as to encourage discussion, not so much of individual ilms, but of ilms in general. For this reason, the book concentrates on large groupings of ilms—on genres, topics, and periods of ilm history. This textbook differs from the more traditional histories of the cinema for certain speciic and important reasons. Over the past forty-ive years, the ield of ilm study has undergone a tremendous transformation. This change has been spearheaded by the work of a new generation of scholars who challenge the traditional way in which ilm history has been written and taught. Introduction to Film courses that, forty-ive years ago, taught ilm as art, drew heavily upon the approaches of New Criticism. Contemporary ilm courses now teach ilm not only as art but also as ilm, and they attempt to situate ilm as an art form within a larger industrial, economic, social, and cultural context. They rely heavily on cultural studies, new historicism, psychoanalysis, and other contemporary critical disciplines. Film history texts have changed over the years as well. In the past, histories consisted of simple, chronological accounts of who-did-what and whathappened-when, and of the stories of great men (sic) and their achievements, and of straightforward accounts of the inluence of technology and economics on the course of a history that unfolds in a linear fashion up to the present. More recently, ilm scholars have begun to rewrite these traditional histories, creating what Thomas Elsaesser refers to as “the New Film History.” At its ■ ■ ■ ■ ■\n\nxv\n\nxvi\n\nPreface\n\n■ ■ ■ ■ ■\n\nbest, this history is driven by a sophisticated, theoretically informed revisionism. It simply refuses to accept the easy answers to basic historical questions that had been offered up by past historians. With the initial publication of American Cinema/American Culture in 1994, the methods and discoveries of “the New Film History,” were applied to an introductory level text surveying the history of the American cinema. That book was an attempt to put the principles of “the New Film History” into action—to present and to make accessible the indings of contemporary ilm studies to college students taking introductory level courses in ilm, American Studies, or Cultural Studies. Traditional histories of the cinema rely upon certain unquestioned assumptions that underlie the way they are written and read. They assume, for example, that the meaning of history is best represented through the timeworn format of the chronological narrative of events. They suggest that the fact that one event takes place after another somehow automatically “explains” that event. In this view, each event derives from a prior event; it comes from a cause-and-effect chain that runs smoothly and linearly from some origin in the past to the present. This book understands that history does not only consist of “one damned thing after another,” but of ideas, problems, and issues. For that reason, the text gives a certain priority in its organization to thematic over chronological concerns. This textbook is designed not as a blow-by-blow account of who did what and when, but as an historically informed portrait of American cinema, provided through a clear and concise description of its most salient features. Nonetheless, a sense of history strongly pervades the book, guiding the structure of speciic chapters and of the book as a whole and providing a survey of the American cinema’s major character traits as they take shape over the decades. Seen from the perspective of a cultural phenomenon, American cinema emerges as a stylistically uniied body of work (as discussed in the chapters on classical Hollywood cinema), generated within a certain mode of production (see the chapters on the studio system and the star system) that is uniquely dependent upon modern technologies developed for the recording of images and sounds. These general characteristics of American cinema underlie the nature of the particular products which that cinema produces—the various genres of ilms discussed within the text, ranging from comedies and Westerns to war ilms and musicals. Traditional ilm histories tend to be unsuitable for introductory ilm courses in that they frequently omit any discussion of aesthetics, presuming that basic matters of ilm form have been dealt with in a prior course. This text, however, doubles as both a cultural history and an introduction to aesthetics and ilm form, introducing and explaining basic vocabulary in the chapters that discuss the narrative and stylistic practices of classical Hollywood cinema. Subsequent chapters refer back to these basic ingredients of narrative and stylistic form. Here, the function of mise-en-scène and editing is explored in terms of their relation to the overall system of classical Hollywood style. Traditional ilm histories present themselves as purely objective accounts of “what happened in the past.” They disguise their own position in relation to\n\nPreface\n\nxvii ■ ■ ■ ■ ■\n\nthat past. This text, however, develops a clearly delineated thesis and encourages instructors, students, and general readers to question and test that thesis by holding it up to close scrutiny. The core of that thesis rests on an assumption that American cinema reveals, both directly and indirectly, something about American experience, identity, and culture. The relationship among American cinema and American identity, as mediated through American culture, is extremely complex. Each shapes and is shaped by the other in a constant process of mutual determination. American cinema plays a crucial role in the process of identity-formation. Films not only serve as texts that document who we think we are or were, but they also relect changes in our self-image, tracing the transformation from one kind of America to another. More importantly, the American cinema plays a crucial role in assisting audiences in negotiating major changes in identity; it carries them across dificult periods of cultural transition in such a way that a more or less coherent national identity remains in place, spanning the gaps and issures that threaten to disrupt its movement and to expose its essential disjointedness. The irst major cultural crisis that American cinema addressed was the trauma in national identity brought about by the transition from an agricultural to an industrial nation, which took place in the United States after the Civil War. The period from roughly 1865 to the beginning of World War I (1916) witnessed a cataclysmic transformation of America from a largely rural to a predominantly urban culture, from an agrarian to an industrial economy, from a nation of producers (farmers, small businessmen, and shopkeepers) to one of consumers, and from a community of individuals to a mass society. Popular response to this rapid urbanization and industrialization combined an enthusiasm for technological progress and economic growth with an anxiety about the threats these changes posed to preindustrial American values. At the same time, urbanization, industrialization, and mass culture brought with them social and economic problems that justiied those anxieties. On the one hand, preindustrial notions of individuality and personal agency (i.e., the ability of individuals to accomplish things on their own) were compromised by the social subject’s new, disempowered status of anonymity within the mass. Victorian America believed that the individual would be properly compensated for his/her integrity, energy, and hard work. But industrial trusts and monopolies had rigged the system in their favor, preventing the individual entrepreneur from securing an appropriate reward for his or her efforts. At the same time, modern mass culture, according to Ann Douglas and others, was believed to have “feminized” traditional American virtues. In response to the “crisis of masculinity,” leaders such as Theodore Roosevelt praised “the strenuous life,” advocating a return to a more rugged way of life in the wilderness in an attempt “to reinvigorate American society.” Roosevelt complained that the youth of America were brought up in a “slothful ease . . . that was creating a generation dominated by the over-civilized man, who has lost the great ighting, masterful virtues” and insisted that the country must struggle “to stave off effeminacy that is one of the dangers of nations that grow old and soft and unwilling to endure hardships.”\n\nxviii\n\nPreface\n\n■ ■ ■ ■ ■\n\nRoosevelt sought to correct these problems. To protect the individual, he sought legislation to bust the trusts. In an attempt to preserve the manly virtues that made this country great, he created ive national parks and ifty-one wildlife refuges where American boys and men could pursue the strenuous life. He also led by example, hunting bears in Yellowstone, leading safaris in Africa and expeditions up the Amazon. He also founded the Rough Riders, a crack company of soldiers he commanded in the Spanish-American War. Two major reform movements—populism and progressivism—arose in an attempt to address the excesses brought about by industrialization, urbanization, and the rise of mass culture. The politics of populism and progressivism were short-lived, roughly spanning the period between the presidential campaigns of populist William Jennings Bryan (1896) and of two progressives, Theodore Roosevelt (1904/1912) and Woodrow Wilson (1912/1916). But as systems of belief, the ideologies of populism and progressivism outlived the rise and fall of the Populist and Progressive political parties. Populist ideology was rooted in the ideals of the Jeffersonian democratic tradition. Thomas Jefferson envisioned America as “a republic of yeoman farmers, each man working his own land, free to develop in his own way.” For Jefferson, the moral virtue of the American citizenry depended upon its association with the land. According to Jefferson, the American character was rescued from the corruption and decadence of the Old World through regenerative contact with nature. But, more importantly, the land became, for him, the basis on which American democracy was to be built. The availability of free land in the West guaranteed each American an opportunity to own land, and, thereby, to have an equal stake in the affairs of the nation. The universal ownership of property would not only empower Americans but ensure their self-suficiency and independence. Populist ideology looked back with nostalgia to the “lost Eden” of preindustrial, agrarian America, to the nation of shopkeepers, artisans, farmers, and small towns that, as historian Richard Hofstadter wrote, existed “before the development of industrialism and the commercialization of agriculture.” In returning to the original values and beliefs of Revolutionary-era America, populism advocated “democracy, honest and unobtrusive central government, leadership by decent men, equality of opportunity, [and] self-help.” Responding to the postindustrial present, populism, as Jeffrey Richards noted, “opposed big business, the political machine and intellectualism as the things most likely to hamper the individual’s pursuit of happiness.” Much of American cinema can be mapped in terms of its relation to notions of political, social, cultural, and economic reform articulated by populist and progressive ideologies. On the silver screen, American masculinity survived the onslaught of modernity in the form of countless male stars from Douglas Fairbanks and Clark Gable to Brad Pitt and Matt Damon. In Jaws (1975), Chief Brody (Roy Scheider) opposes civic corruption and battles a great white shark, proving that in modern America one man (sic) could still make a difference. As for the “lost Eden” of small-town America, it can be found in the Bedford Falls of Frank Capra’s It’s a Wonderful Life (1946); its nightmarish alter-ego,\n\nPreface\n\nxix ■ ■ ■ ■ ■\n\nPottersville, turns out to be a bad dream, prevented from becoming a reality by the heroic efforts of populist reformers such as George Bailey (James Stewart). Even ilms that portray a world dominated by urban alienation, drugs, despair, crime, and corruption, such as Taxi Driver (1976), look back to populist and progressive mythology. They depict the consequences of an industrialization and urbanization that was not held in check. They turn populist and progressive ideology inside out, providing a portrait of their worst nightmares. The boundaries of the American cinema are deined by these two diametrically opposed visions—the utopian vision found in Capra, Spielberg, and others and the dystopian vision found in ilm noir, Scorsese, and others. These two visions constitute a single, larger, more complex vision that represents the deeper contradictions within the American psyche.

John Belton\n\nINTRODUCTION During M-G-M’s heyday as a studio, the end title of every M-G-M ilm read “Made in Hollywood, U.S.A.” Though not every American ilm is or was made in Hollywood, the bulk of American cinema is the product of a speciic mode of production that was perfected in Hollywood and that consists of a unique combination of various ingredients. “Hollywood” is not only a place in California where movies are made. It does not only consist of studios, labs, and other buildings; nor of producers, stars, directors, screenwriters, and the other personnel who are actually involved in the making of movies. “Hollywood” is also a consistent and coherent set of aesthetic and stylistic conventions that audiences readily understand. Beneath these conventions lies an industrial infrastructure that works to maintain and support them. This industrial base includes the studio system and the star system, as well as the movie culture that grew up around these institutions. Movie culture ranges in its scope from the discourses (or ways of representing things) of advertising, publicity, and fan magazines to the experience of moviegoing, which changes from decade to decade. The experience of watching a one-reel short ilm in a nickelodeon in 1908 differs dramatically from that of watching a silent feature ilm in a movie palace in the 1920s. These experiences, in turn, remain worlds apart from going to drive-ins in the 1950s, small-screen multiplexes in the 1960s and 1970s, and mall cinemas multiplexes (8 to 15 screens) and megaplexes (16 or more screens) in the present. The irst section of this text (Chapters 1–5) concentrates on the notion of “Hollywood” as a unique system designed for the eficient production of a rather unusual product—motion pictures. “The Emergence of the Cinema as an Institution” traces the evolution of American ilmmaking from a toy, novelty item, and fairground attraction to a carefully tailored mode of production designed to produce seamless narratives capable of entertaining a mass audience. Subsequent chapters on “Classical Hollywood Cinema” (“Narration” in Chapter 2; “Style” in Chapter 3), “The Studio System,” and “The Star System” explore the nature of this institution, providing a descriptive account of the basic elements that constitute Hollywood as a distinct mode of production. Much as Hollywood turns the craft of ilm production, distribution, and exhibition into an eficient system, so it also systematizes its product. It makes and markets ilms according to yet another system—that of genres. The second section of the text (Chapters 6–12) looks at the way movies work by exploring the relation of major ilm genres to the speciic industrial and cultural machinery that produced them—that is, to the institution of Hollywood and to the institution of American mass culture. ■ ■ ■ ■ ■\n\nxxi\n\nxxii\n\nIntroduction\n\n■ ■ ■ ■ ■\n\nThe system of genres duplicates, in the area of ilm product, the organizational strategies that underlie the ilm industry’s institutional base. This system establishes broad categories of ilm types that have proven their economic viability over the years and that, as a result, work to stabilize the production process by reducing inancial risk. Audiences go to movies that resemble ilms which they have seen before. That is, audiences go to comedies, melodramas, war ilms, Westerns, and other broad categories of ilm types. This section will also relate these ilms to the more general cultural concerns which inform them and to which they, in turn, give form. The arrangement of these chapters follows a quasi-chronological line, corresponding roughly to the decades in which the individual genres are best represented by the production output of the studios. Though the chapter on ilm comedy discusses the genre from the 1910s to the 2000s, it concentrates on the comedies of Frank Capra, Howard Hawks, and other directors of the 1930s. The chapter on the war ilm, though it includes discussion of Vietnam and Iraq war ilms, devotes the bulk of its attention to the 1940s. And so on and so forth with the other genres. In other words, each genre chapter focuses on a particular decade but also traces the history of that genre beyond that particular decade. At the same time, it attempts to link shifts within that genre’s evolution to changes that occur within the larger proile of American cultural history. Finally, the book concludes with a review of the history of recent American cinema. It provides an analysis of the postwar assaults on Hollywood by the anticommunist witch-hunts of the late-1940s and 1950s, by the advent of television, by the social and political upheavals of the 1960s, and by the rise of new generations of ilmmakers in the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. This history of Hollywood in the postwar years describes the dismantling of the old Hollywood as a unique system of production, distribution, and exhibition and the attempts to construct a new Hollywood out of whatever pieces of the old that could be salvaged and adapted to the needs of a changing marketplace. This section looks back to both the irst part of the book, which describes the classical mode of production that is transformed in the postwar years, and the second part, which outlines the histories of various genres, which are themselves altered by this new mode of production. The movies play a crucial role in our lives. They entertain us, but they also educate us. The education which they provide lies not so much in what they show—in what stories or situations we see on the screen. Rather it consists of the attitudes that the movies take to the underlying concerns with which our culture seems continuously preoccupied. The chief concern this book examines is that of twentieth-century America as well—the traumatic shift in identity that takes place as the country evolves from a nineteenth-century, rural, agrarianbased, social, cultural, and economic community into a modern, urban, industrialized mass society. The movies, which were born in the midst of this crisis in American identity, emerge as a crucial factor in its resolution. They serve, in part, to help us to negotiate this transition. This book looks at how they do that.\n\nPART ONE\n\nThe Mode of Production Motion pictures are made in a variety of ways. Some ilms, such as home movies, are inexpensively produced by individuals who own amateur ilmmaking equipment. Initially, they used 16mm, super 8, or 8mm ilm, but more recently have begun to use video or digital video equipment to ilm everyday, nonictional occurrences, such as birthday parties, weddings, holiday celebrations, vacations, and other familyrelated events. They do not always bother to record sound or edit their footage; they show what they ilm as it was ilmed. And, prior to Youtube, they exhibited their ilms in the privacy of their own homes to audiences that consisted of family members, relatives, and friends. At the other end of the spectrum stand expensively produced, feature-length Hollywood productions. These works boast casts of thousands, high-priced stars, lavish costumes and sets, intricate narratives, complicated special effects, dangerous stunts, meticulous sound recording, and elaborate sound design. For their successful completion they require the facilities of a major studio or an independently assembled crew of several hundred technicians and craftspersons. These ilms take several months to a year to produce. They require painstaking preparation in the stage of preproduction, during which scripts are written, parts are cast, and budgets are planned. They demand the expertise of skilled professionals during the production process, when the efforts of the producer, director, screenwriter, cameraperson, actors, costume and set designers, sound recordists, and others are carefully coordinated to transfer the script to ilm. And they call upon the extensive skill and training of sound mixers, editors, and other personnel during postproduction to produce a high-class product that can then be sold to the general public. The distribution, advertising, marketing, and exhibition of the inished product enlist the aid of another team of experts, who design publicity campaigns and prepare marketing materials (such as posters, trailers, and television ads).\n\n■ ■ ■ ■ ■\n\n1\n\n2\n\nPART 1 The Mode of Production\n\n■ ■ ■ ■ ■\n\nBetween these two extremes are a variety of ilmmaking practices. They include avant-garde ilms, which are made by individuals using amateur equipment and techniques but are designed for public exhibition. At the same time, industrial ilms are produced using professional equipment and staff. But, unlike experimental works, these ilms are intended to provide information about the business products and services that fund them. Another mode of production involves the making of documentaries, which rely upon similar kinds of equipment and personnel but are inanced by public funds or grants and tend to explore topical or controversial public issues. Although the largest body of motion picture production (in terms of sheer footage) undoubtedly consists of home movies, the mode of production with which the majority of Americans are most familiar is probably that of the Hollywood feature ilm. The chapters that follow examine the basic features of this mode of production, not experimental or avant-garde ilms, documentaries or industrials, or home movies. Individual chapters look at the emergence of narrative cinema as a medium and the growth of a movie culture that includes the creation of an industry to make ilms, an audience to support them, and movie theaters in which they can be shown. Other chapters also explore the basic narrative and stylistic features of the ilms that dominate this industry. And still other chapters examine the industrial systems—the studio and star systems—that evolve to ensure that motion pictures generate a proit for those who make them. This section of the book argues that Hollywood’s mode of production plays a central role in determining the basic features of American cinema and that these features relect, in part, the nature of the system that produced them.\n\nCHAPTER\n\n1\n\nThe Emergence of the Cinema as an Institution “THE CATHEDRAL OF THE MOTION PICTURE” For the better part of the last century, the movies enjoyed a unique status as the premier entertainment activity for the majority of Americans. The movies, like baseball, became something of a national pastime. Americans not only supported their motion pictures but loved them as well. Going to the movies, though perhaps not a religious experience for most, was certainly an ecstatic experience for many. Ecstasy came not only from the movies themselves but also from the surroundings in which they were presented. Movie palaces built in the 1910s, 1920s, and 1930s resemble gigantic cathedrals. Indeed, the 6200-seat Roxy, the world’s largest theater, was described in advertisements as “the cathedral of the motion picture.” Spectacular theaters like the Roxy inspired awe, and this awe inspired, in turn, cartoons like that in the New Yorker in which a little girl, staring in amazement at the interior of a theater lobby, asked, “Mama—does God live here?” ■ ■ ■ ■ ■\n\n3\n\n4\n\nPART 1 The Mode of Production\n\n■ ■ ■ ■ ■\n\nThe cult status of movies extended to those who appeared in them. Movie fans helped to transform charismatic screen actors and actresses into movie stars, making them the objects of intense popular fascination and even idolization. Although mass-produced, movies have recovered a certain sense of aura or at least a unique sense of novelty and excitement for consumers of mass culture. Unlike preindustrial forms of entertainment such as the theater, the things represented (the characters, the story) were not really there before the audience. Instead, they were only there indirectly; they were present in the form of images on the screen. Although they were mechanically reproduced, they nonetheless continued to create an impression of immediacy and presence. At any rate, audiences regarded them as special. They waited for hours in lines several blocks long to see new ilms that had been highly publicized or critically acclaimed, were controversial—or that merely featured their favorite stars. For twenty years, from the coming of sound in 1929 to the postwar period (1949), roughly 80 to 90 million Americans went to the movies every week. In other words, virtually every American between the ages of 6 and 60 went to the movies at least once a week. Although certain ilms, like Gone With the Wind (1939), drew more viewers than others, moviegoing had become a habit and increasing numbers of spectators religiously went to see whatever was playing at their neighborhood theaters. Though the movies may have resembled a religious institution, they were always primarily a social institution—going to the movies became a way in which people passed their leisure time. However, in even the most common sense of the term, by the 1920s the cinema had deinitely become an institution—an integral feature of the experience of being an American in the twentieth century. Going to the movies became as commonplace as going to school, to work, or to church. For earlier generations, it was as familiar an activity as watching television, checking email, playing video games, or tweeting is today.\n\nDEVELOPING SYSTEMS: SOCIETY AND TECHNOLOGY The cinema is an institution in a number of senses of the term. It is an economic institution, designed to make money. In order to do this, it established itself as an industry. It is a complex organization of producers, distributors, and exhibitors whose job it is to make and market motion pictures. To accomplish its goals, the industry developed a basic technology that facilitates the production and exhibition of movies. It also established various systems—such as the star system (see Chapter 5) and the genre system—which are designed to ensure that individual ilms return a proit to the industry that produces, distributes, and exhibits them. Stars and genres serve as known commodities that guarantee, up front, a certain minimal amount of pleasure that can be expected\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe Emergence of the Cinema as an Institution\n\n5\n\nAuthor’s collection\n\n■ ■ ■ ■ ■\n\nAn advertisement for a new movie palace, the Paramount Theatre, described it as “the playground of the millions, in a Palace worthy of a King.”\n\nby viewers. Thus, in addition to the basic technological machinery required for making and showing ilms, the industry developed a secondary, “mental” machinery that makes audiences want to go to the movies. In other words, the cinema, as an institution, developed on a variety of different levels at the same time. It functions as a social institution. That is, it is a means of providing an appropriate form of social contact for members of an emerging American populace born and bred in the world of mass culture. Indeed, it became an even more appropriate and more modern forum for leisure-time communal activity, for example, than were previous workingclass social institutions such as churches, dance halls, social clubs, and saloons, which belong more properly to an earlier, preindustrial culture. At the same time, the cinema evolved as a technological institution that became dependent for its success on products of the Industrial Revolution—cameras, celluloid,\n\n6\n\nPART 1 The Mode of Production\n\n■ ■ ■ ■ ■\n\nmicrophones, ampliiers, magnetic recording tape, ilm laboratories, electricity, projectors, speakers, and screens. And it serves as a psychological institution whose purpose is to encourage the moviegoing habit by providing the kind of entertainment that working-class and middle-class Americans want. The cinematic institution has changed from period to period, responding, in part, to technological changes, to the changing demands and leisure-time activities of audiences, and to social and economic changes that take place in American culture as a whole. But these changes have taken place within a more or less ixed notion of the cinema’s identity as a medium. For roughly a hundred years, no matter how often the face of the cinema has changed, the underlying structure of the cinematic experience has remained more or less the same. Going to the cinema has consisted of watching life-size images projected on a big screen. Yet even this fundamental feature of the cinema’s identity was not always there. To understand what the cinema is and how it works, it is important to look at how it took shape. The identity of the cinema as an institution remains bound up with the sociocultural conditions in which it was conceived and developed by the growing ilm industry and in which it was experienced and consumed by an emerging society of habitual moviegoers.\n\nEDISON AND THE KINETOSCOPE Capturing Time The origins of the cinema lie in the development of mass communication technology. The cinema serves as the culmination of an age that saw the invention of the telegraph (1837), photography (1826–1839), the typewriter (1873), the telephone (1876), the phonograph (1878), roll ilm (1880), the Kodak camera (1888), George Eastman’s motion picture ilm (1889), Thomas Edison’s motion picture camera (1891–1893), Guglielmo Marconi’s wireless telegraph (1895), and the motion picture projector (1895–1896). Edison, who had played a role in the development of the telegraph, the phonograph, and electricity, used the phonograph as a model for his “invention” of the motion picture. Actually, Edison did not so much invent as produce the irst motion picture camera, the Kinetoscope. The actual execution of Edison’s goal of creating an “instrument which [did] for the eye what the phonograph [did] for the ear” was accomplished through the effort of Edison’s assistant, W. K. L. Dickson, which was itself based on earlier work by Étienne-Jules Marey. The Kinetoscope—along with the telegraph, photography, the telephone, the phonograph, and the wireless telegraph—transformed the face of late nineteenth-century culture. Traditional notions of space and distance, which\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe Emergence of the Cinema as an Institution\n\n7\n\n■ ■ ■ ■ ■\n\nwere based in part on how long it took to get from one place to another, were redeined by the virtually instantaneous transmission of information from one geographical location to another. Traditional notions of time underwent revision as still photographs captured moments of the present in ways that had eluded more primitive forms of representation. Photographs—unlike sketches, paintings, and sculptures—record events instantaneously before they vanish into memory. Thus the present and the past are rescued from the passage of time, lifted out of its continuous ongoing process, and frozen for all to see. Motion pictures record and reproduce the low of time in a way that previously was impossible, even in photography. Photography and the motion picture introduced—and institutionalized— a new, modern conception of time. Time could not only be caught but also replayed. It became, in a sense, a commodity. In the past, time was “spent” and then the experience of that time disappeared. But with still photography, the phonograph, and the motion picture, time was objectiied. It could be marketed, in the form of photos, records, or movies, and it could be ininitely reexperienced. In short, the new communication technologies that arose at the end of the nineteenth century helped give birth to mass culture and the era of mass consumption—in part, by transforming time into a product that could be reproduced and sold. The cinema’s ability to objectify and commodify time became crucial to its success. As a medium, the cinema realized the goals of a twentieth-century consumer society whose desires were shaped by the Industrial Revolution. This society was encouraged by advertising and other forms of mass persuasion to consume what machines produced. These mass-produced products ranged from material goods such as cosmetics, clothes, household furnishings, and foodstuffs to less tangible items such as motion pictures. The cinema emerged as the perfect consumer product in that it not only gave audiences an experience to consume but also functioned as a display window for other mass-produced goods. As Charles Eckert argues, the movies serve as a showcase for consumer goods, including sewing machines, typewriters, telephones, automobiles, furniture, and fashions, which audiences then seek to obtain for themselves.\n\nPeepshows versus Projectors The cinema did not emerge as a form of mass consumption, however, until its technology evolved from its initial format of peepshow into its inal form as images projected on a screen in a darkened theater. Edison’s Kinetoscope was designed for use in Kinetoscope parlors, which contained only a few individual machines and permitted only one customer to view a short, 50-foot ilm at any one time. The irst Kinetoscope parlors contained ive machines. For the price of 25 cents (or 5 cents per machine), customers moved from machine to machine to watch ive different ilms (or, in the case of famous prizeights, successive rounds of a single ight).\n\n8\n\nPART 1 The Mode of Production\n\nEdison’s peepshow Kinetoscope, featuring ear tubes for sound, entertained one customer at a time.\n\nThese Kinetoscope arcades were modeled on phonograph parlors that had proved successful for Edison several years earlier. In the phonograph parlors, customers listened to recordings through individual ear tubes, moving from one machine to the next to hear different recorded speeches or pieces of music. The Kinetoscope parlors functioned in a similar way. More interested in the sale of Kinetoscopes (for roughly $250 apiece) to these parlors than in the ilms (which cost approximately $10 to $15 each) that would be run in them, Edison refused to develop projection technology, reasoning (quite correctly) that if he made and sold projectors, then exhibitors would purchase only one machine— a projector—from him instead of several. Exhibitors, however, wanted to maximize their proits, which they could do more readily by projecting a handful of ilms to hundreds of customers at a time (rather than to one at a time) and by charging 25 to 50 cents for admission. About a year after the opening of the irst Kinetoscope parlor in 1894, showmen such as Louis and Auguste Lumiere, Thomas Armat and Francis Jenkins, and Orville and Woodville Latham (with the assistance of Edison’s former assistant, Dickson) perfected projection devices that were used in vaudeville houses, legitimate theaters, local town halls, makeshift storefront theaters, fairgrounds, and amusement parks to show ilms to mass audiences.\n\nCourtesy of the Edison National Historic Site\n\n■ ■ ■ ■ ■\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe Emergence of the Cinema as an Institution\n\n9\n\n■ ■ ■ ■ ■\n\nMASS PRODUCTION, MASS CONSUMPTION A Public Spectacle With the advent of projection (1895–1896), the motion pictures became the ultimate form of mass consumption. Previous audiences, of course, had viewed spectacles en masse at the theater, where vaudeville, popular dramas, musical and minstrel shows, classical plays, lectures, and slide and lantern shows had been presented to several hundred spectators at a time. But the movies differed signiicantly from these other forms of entertainment that depended on either live performance or (in the case of slide and lantern shows) the active involvement of a master of ceremonies who assembled the inal program. Although exhibitors regularly accompanied movies with live acts, the substance of the movies themselves was mass-produced, prerecorded material that could easily be reproduced for audiences by theaters, with little or no active participation on the audience members’ part. Even though early exhibitors shaped their ilm programs by editing them together in whichever ways they thought would be most attractive to audiences or by accompanying them with lectures, their creative control remained limited. What audiences came to see was the technological marvel of the movies: the lifelike reproduction of the commonplace motion of trains, waves striking the shore, and people walking in the street, and the magic made possible by trick photography and the manipulation of the camera. With the advent of projection, the viewer’s relationship with the image was no longer private, as it had been with peepshow devices such as the Kinetoscope and the Mutoscope, which was a similar machine that reproduced motion by means of successive images on individual photographic cards instead of images on strips of celluloid. In 1896, it suddenly became public—an experience that the viewer shared with dozens, scores, and even hundreds of others. At the same time, the image that the spectator viewed expanded from the minuscule peepshow dimensions of 1 or 2 inches (in height) to the life-size proportions of 6 or 9 feet. The spectator was no longer a Peeping Tom looking guiltily through a keyhole but a voyeur whose activity was shared (and thus semiauthorized) by a larger public.\n\nMiddle-Class Amusements From 1896 to roughly 1905, when the nickelodeon era began, the audience that went to the movies (in the United States, at least) was the same more or less middle-class audience that had previously gone to vaudeville shows, variety theaters, and amusement parks. Indeed, the movies became variety acts of a sort, which played alongside live acts in places that provided a broad spectrum of different kinds of popular entertainment. Although the audiences consisted of all socioeconomic classes, the cost of admission tended to exclude the lower\n\n10\n\nPART 1 The Mode of Production\n\n■ ■ ■ ■ ■\n\nclasses, as did the length of the program, which in vaudeville theaters was 2 hours or more. As a result, working-class laborers, who worked (ca. 1900) 60 hours a week or more and earned less than 4 dollars a week, could only afford to attend on occasion. The ilms mirrored the variety of contexts in which they were presented. Shown primarily in vaudeville houses until 1905, motion pictures appealed to audiences as attractions, a series of acts within the larger act of motion pictures, which was itself often only one of eight other variety acts. The kinds of ilms shown were actualities (documentaries, views of famous or distant places), recorded vaudeville acts, excerpts from popular plays, phantom rides (ilms shot from the front of moving vehicles), and trick ilms, which used the techniques of slow motion, reverse motion, substitution, and multiple exposure to perform tricks or acts of “magic.” Scholars of early cinema such as Tom Gunning describe this cinema of attractions as essentially an exhibitionist cinema. As attractions, ilms with selfdescriptive titles like The Execution of Mary Queen of Scots (1895) or Electrocuting an Elephant (1903) presented or exhibited spectacles for viewers to admire. Strongmen such as Eugene Sandow lexed their muscles for the camera, and exotic dancers such as Fatima performed for the camera. Certain erotic ilms, such as From Showgirl to Burlesque Queen (1903), relied on a more traditional form of exhibitionism, as women undressed before and looked lirtatiously at the camera. Early, pre-1906 cinema stressed showing rather than telling. Most ilms made in this period were actualities, which outnumbered iction ilms until roughly 1906, when the percentage of story ilms began to increase dramatically and actualities became less and less popular. The shift from one kind of cinema to the other took place rapidly. By 1908, 96 percent of all American ilms told stories. The institutionalization of narrative as the primary category of American motion picture production marked the beginning of another stage in the development of the cinema as an institution. It was accompanied by a signiicant change in ilm exhibition.\n\nThe Nickelodeon: A Collective Experience Starting in 1905, theaters devoted exclusively to the showing of motion picture ilms began to spring up in virtually every city in the country. Referred to as “nickelodeons” because the price of admission was initially only a nickel— this igure subsequently rose to 10 cents—these small, 200-seat theaters were quickly installed in or near shopping or entertainment districts in former stores that were converted, often in an extremely makeshift way, to movie theaters. The low cost of admission and the abbreviated length of the programs attracted a new class of patrons, whom previous (and more expensive) forms of popular entertainment had ignored—the working classes. Previously, working-class amusements had been conined to the home, the church, the saloon, or the social club. Nickelodeons drew the poorer elements\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe Emergence of the Cinema as an Institution\n\n11\n\nAuthor’s collection\n\n■ ■ ■ ■ ■\n\nThe exterior of a typical nickelodeon, the Cascade Theatre in New Castle, Pennsylvania (ca. 1903).\n\nof society, including recent immigrants, out of the ethnic social life associated with their local neighborhoods into a more diversiied public space, where members of different classes and religions were transformed into a community of moviegoers. At the same time, these theaters continued to attract members of the middle-class audience that had earlier seen movies in vaudeville theaters. Although the nickelodeons were never the melting pot of American democracy that certain historians have claimed, by 1910 they did provide the 26 million Americans who attended over 10,000 nickelodeons each week a common entertainment program. For the irst time, millions of Americans from different backgrounds watched the same ilms and thus shared a collective experience as an invisible community. As the popularity of the nickelodeons increased and the moviegoing audience expanded, these theaters began to serve as the site for the creation of a homogeneous, middle-class American culture. As a writer for Harper’s magazine noted on visiting a nickelodeon in 1913, once the various members of the ethnically, socially, and economically diverse audience had taken their seats, they became part of a single crowd, caught up in the dreamlike images on the screen. This utopian ideal of a classless (or universally middle-class) community of spectators may never have been realized,\n\n12\n\nPART 1 The Mode of Production\n\nAuthor’s collection\n\n■ ■ ■ ■ ■\n\nMoviegoing as a social institution.

In 1908, the major ilm producers banded together to form the Motion Picture Patents Company (MPPC), which sought to control all aspects of motion picture production, distribution, and exhibition (see Chapter 4, “The Studio System”). Shortly after the formation of the MPPC, exhibitors and ilm producers sought to expand the market of habitual moviegoers to include greater and greater numbers of those who had previously attended only “high-class” amusements, such as the theater and vaudeville. However, in December 1908, the mayor of New York City ordered that all nickel theaters be closed, arguing that they posed a “threat to the city’s physical and moral well-being.” Exhibitors and members of the MPPC responded almost immediately with a campaign to improve the content of motion pictures and the conditions of theaters. At the same time, exhibitors consciously began to court middle-class customers by becoming more “respectable.” They provided half-price matinees for women and children, they upgraded the\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe Emergence of the Cinema as an Institution\n\n13 ■ ■ ■ ■ ■\n\nquality of the physical structure of the theaters, they eliminated lower-class elements such as ethnic ilms and foreign-language sing-alongs, and they raised prices. Producers joined the program to uplift the movies by making ilms that appealed to a higher class of clientele. They engaged in self-censorship to control any content of motion pictures that might prove offensive to middle-class tastes. And they voluntarily submitted their ilms to the national Board of Censorship (an independent body of censors) for review. In an attempt to appeal to middle-class sensibilities, they drew more and more on the classics. Prior to 1908, the source material for movies had come from newspaper headlines, vaudeville and burlesque routines, political cartoons, fairy tales, and popular songs. Between 1907 and 1911, however, Vitagraph released more than ifty ilms that were based on literary, historical, or biblical sources. Filmmakers began to adapt the works of Edgar Allan Poe, Charles Dickens, Emile Zola, Leo Tolstoy, Victor Hugo, and William Shakespeare.\n\nSPECTACLE AND STORYTELLING: FROM PORTER TO GRIFFITH The Camera as Recorder The bourgeoisiication of the movies involved considerably more than merely upgrading motion picture content from strongmen lexing their muscles to Shakespeare. In adapting more complex story material to the screen, ilmmakers were forced to upgrade their own abilities as storytellers. While early American cinema had been exhibitionist in nature, satisied with showing attractions, subsequent (post-1908) American cinema became more and more intent on the perfection of narrative skills. Mere theatrical display proved less and less capable of conveying complex character psychology or intricate narrative complications. Middle-class audiences who had grown up with the highly involved plots and fascinating characters of authors such as Dickens began to demand more sophisticated ilm narratives than had their predecessors. Film directors like D. W. Grifith, who carefully crafted narrative personae for themselves, provided these new audiences with the kinds of narratives with which they were familiar in the theater or in literature. Edwin S. Porter, the major ilmmaker associated with early American cinema, epitomized the presentational style of pre-Grifith cinema. Intent on a theatrical style of spectacle, Porter composed his narratives out of a succession of separate attractions. In one of his most famous ilms, The Life of an American Fireman (1903), Porter showed the ireman’s dramatic rescue of a mother and her baby from the second story of a burning building. In the inal\n\n14\n\nPART 1 The Mode of Production\n\n■ ■ ■ ■ ■\n\nversion of the ilm, Porter presented the action of the rescue as he had originally ilmed it—in two successive shots. Filmed at two separate times as two separate spectacles staged in two separate spaces, the event remained that way for the audiences who saw it in 1903. In the irst shot, audiences saw the interior of a smoke-illed room: the ireman enters, rescues the woman, and returns a few moments later to rescue the infant. In the next shot, audiences saw the exterior of the building: the ireman enters, rescues the woman by carrying her down a ladder, and then, informed that her child is still in the room, returns to rescue the baby. In other words, Porter showed the same action from two different perspectives successively rather than cutting back and forth from the interior to the exterior of the building to follow the unfolding of the drama as it might have been told by a storyteller more intent on suspense and the act of narration itself.\n\nThe Camera as Narrator Primitive cinema presented events but provided little or no reading of them. Events spoke for themselves without the intervention of a narrator or narrating presence that attempted to read or interpret them for the audience. The cinema of Grifith (and later) actively narrated events, shaping the audience’s perception of them. This was accomplished in a variety of ways, but chief among them, for Grifith at least, was the device of parallel editing, which involves cutting back and forth from two (or more) simultaneous events taking place in separate spaces. Tom Gunning described the parallel editing in Grifith’s The Drive for Life (1909), which cuts back and forth between a man who discovers that the woman he has jilted has sent a box of poisoned chocolates to his iancée, and his iancée, who is about to eat one of the pieces of candy. As the iancée picks up a piece of chocolate and is about to eat it, Grifith cuts away, in mid-gesture, to her lover, speeding to her in his car to warn her of her danger. The suspense editing repeatedly interrupts her action, returning to show her being distracted by her sister, dropping the candy, or kissing it. Each time the ilm cuts away from her as she is about to eat the poisoned candy, the presence of Grifith as a narrator can be dramatically felt. At the same time, Grifith used editing to contribute to the psychological development of his characters, giving the audience a sense of what they are thinking. In After Many Years (1908) he cut from a wife to the object of her thoughts—her shipwrecked husband. Other edits were used to explain the motivation or the behavior of his characters. In Salvation Army Lass (1908), Grifith cut away from a burglar on his way to commit a crime to a shot of his girlfriend, still lying on the ground where he had left her after rejecting her pleas that he not go on the job. When Grifith cut back to the burglar, who then changes his mind about going ahead with the crime, he deftly conveyed to the audience the reasons for the burglar’s change of heart.\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe Emergence of the Cinema as an Institution\n\n15 ■ ■ ■ ■ ■\n\nThe “Feature” Film With the emergence of a cinema of narration, which replaced that of monstration or showing, classical Hollywood cinema took one step further toward the institutionalization of the cinema as an American pastime. As narratives became more complex, the 1000-foot, one-reel (10- to 15-minute) format of the motion picture, which had only recently become an industrywide standard in 1908, became more and more restrictive. Critics in the trade magazine Moving Picture World observed that “the ilming of some great opera or a popular literary or dramatic or historical subject requires more than a reel” and suggested that the longer the pictures, the more exhibitors could charge audiences to see them. Multiple-reel “feature” ilms from abroad, such as Dante’s Inferno (ive reels, Italy, 1911), Queen Elizabeth (four reels, France, 1912), Quo Vadis (eight reels, Italy, 1913), and Cabiria (ten reels, Italy, 1914) were showcased in large, irstclass legitimate theaters, which charged from 25 cents to a dollar for tickets. The inancial success of these multiple-reel European ilms prompted American producers to release longer and longer ilms, including Grifith’s biblical spectacle, Judith of Bethulia (four reels, 1914), his adaptation of Poe’s “The Telltale Heart” and “Annabel Lee,” The Avenging Conscience (six reels, 1914), and his historical epic, The Birth of a Nation (twelve reels, 1915). The Birth, which sustains an intricate narrative for 3 hours of screen time, held audiences spellbound. One of Grifith’s assistants, Karl Brown, reported his reactions to seeing the fully assembled ilm for the irst time on opening night. “What unfolded on that screen was magic itself. I knew there were cuts from this and to that, but try as I would, I could not see them. . . . All I knew was that between the ebb and low of a broad canvas of a great battle, now far and now near, and the roaring of that gorgeous orchestra banging and blaring battle songs to stir the coldest blood, I was hot and cold and feeling waves of tingling electric shocks racing all over me.” The Birth ran for 44 consecutive weeks at the Liberty Theater in New York City, where reserved-seat tickets were sold at the unprecedented price of 2 dollars. Its success transformed the nature of American ilm production and exhibition. It marked the end of “the lowly nickelodeon storefront theater, with its tinny honky-tonk piano and its windowless, foul-air smelliness” and introduced “the grandeur of a great auditorium with a great orchestra and a great picture that ran for three hours and illed an entire evening with thrills and excitement in a setting of opulent luxury such as the great masses of working people had never dreamed possible for them.” The Birth was notorious for other reasons as well, chief among them its racist agenda. The Birth illustrated the enormous power of the motion picture medium to communicate ideological arguments. Grifith’s melodramatic retelling of the story of the Civil War and Reconstruction posited a villain. That villain was the African American (and the white politicians in the North who were determined to “overthrow civilization in the South” and to “put the white\n\n16\n\nPART 1 The Mode of Production\n\n■ ■ ■ ■ ■\n\nSouth under the heel of the black South”). For Grifith, the birth of the nation depended on the subjugation of the African American and the restoration of white privilege. If The Birth of a Nation marked the birth of classical Hollywood cinema, then that birth was grounded in white racism.\n\nPRESENTING . . . THE MOVIE PALACE “Gardens of Dreams” The advent of multiple-reel, feature-length ilms was accompanied by a dramatic change in motion picture presentation as the uncomfortable, small, makeshift nickelodeons gave way to luxurious movie palaces and other large theaters especially built for the showing of motion pictures. Though the majority of movie theaters built in the 1910s and 1920s tended to be modest in size, seating from 500 to 800 spectators, more and more large movie palaces, seating from 1500 to over 6000 spectators, were built in urban areas. In contrast to the congestion and oppressive sense of city life experienced by urban residents outside the theater, inside the typical movie palace customers enjoyed the luxury of spacious, stately surroundings and a staff of obliging theater attendants who sought to answer their every need. Movie palaces, boasting a palatial decor that ranged from the classical to the exotic, provided “an acre of seats in a garden of dreams.” Contemporary interior decorator Harold Rambusch declared, in 1929, that “in our big modern movie palaces are collected the most gorgeous rugs, furniture and ixtures that money can produce. No kings or emperors have wandered through more luxurious surroundings. In a sense, these theatres are social safety valves in that the public can partake of the same luxuries as the rich.”\n\nThe Great Showmen The era of the movie palace began in 1913 with the opening of the 2460-seat Regent, “the irst de luxe theatre built expressly for showing movies in New York.” Shortly after the Regent opened, showman S. L. Rothapfel was hired to manage it. He made it the premier motion picture theater in the world. Like the movie palaces that followed it, the Regent featured an organ, an orchestra, a chorus and/or opera singers, ushers to show patrons to their seats, and a lavish atmospheric interior adorned with gilt. Rothapfel, or “Roxy” as he was called by his associates, was subsequently lured away from the Regent, which was located uptown at 116th Street and Seventh Avenue, to operate the 3500-seat Strand (1914), which was downtown at Broadway and 47th Street. The New York Times reviewed opening night, was impressed by the neo-Corinthian decor and the plush seats, and compared the\n\nChapter 1\n\n17\n\nThe Emergence of the Cinema as an Institution\n\nAuthor’s collection\n\n■ ■ ■ ■ ■\n\nThe interior of a typical movie palace, the Brooklyn Paramount.\n\nexperience to “going to a Presidential reception.” Roxy later lent his lair for extravagant motion picture presentation to the 1900-seat Rialto when it opened on Times Square in 1916. By this time, the entertainment program of the movie palace had expanded to include (in addition to the theater orchestra’s overture and musical accompaniment of the silent feature) dancers, opera singers, and other performers in live skits. The ilm program had also evolved to consist of not only the feature ilm but a newsreel and a comedy short as well. In fact, the feature presentation tended to occupy only about 68 percent of the entire program. Roxy continued to provide bigger and better shows in a series of other New York theaters. He took over the management of the 2100-seat Rivoli (built in 1917) and of the 5300-seat Capitol (built in 1919, managed by Roxy in 1920), and then of his own 6200-seat Roxy Theatre (1927). By the time he built the Roxy, the art of exhibition had developed into a science. Not only were uniformed ushers and other theater personnel drilled in their duties like military cadets, but spectators became part of this streamlined system of eficiency as well. As Richard Koszarski points out, “Each seat in the Roxy was wired to a central console so the house staff could immediately direct patrons to new vacancies.” In Los Angeles, impresario Sid Grauman followed Roxy’s example, launching a series of movie palaces that were each more lavish than the other. While Roxy gave his audiences an entertainment program consisting of a variety of different live acts to accompany the ilm, Grauman provided a “Prologue,” a show thematically related to the motion picture. His theater empire began with\n\n18\n\nPART 1 The Mode of Production\n\nGrauman’s Chinese Theater in the late 1920s.\n\nthe Million Dollar Theatre (2100 seats) in 1917, then the Egyptian (1900 seats) in 1922, the Metropolitan (3485 seats) in 1923, and the Chinese (2500 seats) in 1927. As the names “Egyptian” and “Chinese” suggest, a number of movie palaces of the 1920s adopted exotic architectural styles, employing Oriental, Hindu, Italian, Persian, Moorish, or Spanish decor to create a romantic atmosphere in which audiences could consume onscreen fantasies. Other major cities, such as Chicago, built movie palaces of their own. Theater magnates A. J. Balaban and Sam Katz, following the major routes of urban mass-transit lines, put their theaters within reach of a growing urban middle class, building the 2400-seat Central Park Theatre in 1917, both the 4700-seat Tivoli Theatre and the 3900-seat Chicago Theatre in 1921, and the 4000-seat Uptown Theatre in the mid-1920s. In addition to mighty Wurlitzer organs, full orchestras, and live stage shows, Balaban & Katz theaters provided patrons with “free child care, attendant smoking rooms, foyers and lobbies lined with paintings and sculpture, and organ music for those waiting in line.” A staff of nurses and mother’s helpers took care of the young children of patrons in the theater basement, which was equipped like a neighborhood playground with slides and sandboxes. At the same time, starting in 1921, Balaban & Katz theaters also had air conditioning, which gave them a crucial advantage over their competition throughout the summer months. Noting the success of the Balaban & Katz theaters in Chicago, Paramount joined forces with that organization and put Sam Katz in charge of all Paramount theaters. As a result, the model for movie palaces developed by Balaban & Katz found widespread adoption in the Paramount theater circuit. It quickly\n\nAuthor’s collection\n\n■ ■ ■ ■ ■\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe Emergence of the Cinema as an Institution\n\n19 ■ ■ ■ ■ ■\n\nspread to the circuits of other major studios as well, becoming the standard used by the ilm industry as a whole. With the construction of theaters especially designed for the exhibition of motion pictures, the shift from one-reel ilms to the new phenomenon of the feature-length ilm that presented narratives and characters as sophisticated as those found in other typically middle-class forms of representation, and the development of a habitual, moviegoing audience composed of a broad spectrum of the general public, the basic elements of the cinematic institution fell into place.\n\nAN EVOLVING INSTITUTION The cinema began as a technological marvel, as the latest invention from Thomas Edison, the “wizard of Menlo Park.” The early cinema of the prenickelodeon days evolved from a primitive cinema of attractions into a modern cinema of compelling characters, engrossing stories, and hypnotic illusionism. Throughout the 1920s, the presentation of motion pictures retained its origin in the world of amusement parks, vaudeville, and burlesque. The movie palaces are themselves spectacles that frequently overwhelm the ilms shown in them. House orchestras and stage shows also foster an air of variety, as does the presence of newsreels, comedy shorts, and other ilmed material that rounds out the program. Yet the feature ilm holds its own among these other attractions. Its ability to give expression to its characters’ emotions, to explore their psyches, to trace their pursuit of their goals—in short, to tell their stories—has evolved to a point of near perfection. The coming of sound, color, widescreen, and stereo sound would add somewhat to the feature ilm’s expressive capabilities but would not profoundly alter classical Hollywood cinema’s ability to function as an eficient system of storytelling. Today’s ilmmakers draw on essentially the same set of stylistic practices and narrative techniques as those forged by Grifith and others during the period in which the fundamental elements of the feature ilm were established. Other features of the cinematic institution, however, have been dismantled. The 1920s witnessed the creation of a general moviegoing public that habitually patronized the nation’s cinemas. For over twenty years, from 1929 to 1949, more than 80 million Americans went to the movies every week. In 2010, the average weekly attendance was only 25.8 million. The age of the nickelodeon gave way to that of the movie palace in the 1910s and 1920s. In the 1960s, the gigantic movie palaces of the past gave way to the new nickelodeons of the present—to small, minimally decorated multiplexes and mall cinemas. The Roxy was torn down in 1961. Radio City Music Hall, though still standing, ceased showing motion pictures on a regular basis in 1978. Today, an increasing number of viewers watch movies in a non-theatrical setting—at home, on their\n\n20\n\nPART 1 The Mode of Production\n\n■ ■ ■ ■ ■\n\nDVD players or streamed live by Netlix to their computers, PlayStations, or Blu-ray players or on the go, on their laptops, netbooks, cell phones, or iPads. The cinematic institution of Hollywood past has disappeared. It slowly transformed itself, from the 1950s to the present, into a new institution designed to serve the different needs of contemporary audiences and an ever-changing, modern motion picture marketplace. The chapters that follow are designed to provide an in-depth portrait of the cinematic institution in its heyday. They look at its stylistic foundations in classical Hollywood’s stylistic and narrative practices, at its industrial roots in the studio system, and at its basic economic underpinnings in the star and genre systems. The goal is not only to draw a map of the terrain of the institution of American cinema, but also to recover for today’s generation of moviegoers some sense of the experience that previous generations had when they went to the movies. ■ ■ ■ SELECT FILMOGRAPHY The Life of an American Fireman (1903) After Many Years (1908)\n\nSalvation Army Lass (1908) The Birth of a Nation (1915)\n\nCHAPTER\n\n2\n\nClassical Hollywood Cinema: Narration A NATIONAL STYLE “The Temper of an Age . . .” A work of art is customarily associated with the name of the artist, and the history of an art form is traditionally written in terms of those names. Such a history assumes that individual artists either live and work in a social vacuum or so transcend the constraints of time and place that their work stands outside of social history. But if the individual artist transcends society, we should remember that society is also and above all within that artist and that every work bears at least two signatures—that of the artist and that of the world in which the work was created. In the ield of art history, Heinrich Wolflin introduced the concept of “a history of art without names.” Wolflin wrote that history in terms of a typology of artistic styles or schools rather than in terms of isolated, individual works. By subsuming the individual styles of the Great Masters within the larger styles ■ ■ ■ ■ ■\n\n21\n\n22\n\nPART 1 The Mode of Production\n\n■ ■ ■ ■ ■\n\nof the school or country at that particular moment in history in which they worked, he drew attention to the multifaceted nature of style, which became for him an “expression of the temper of an age and a nation as well as an expression of the individual temperament.” The history of the cinema that is offered to students in introductory ilm courses has traditionally been written as a history of names: a history of actors, directors, producers, and writers whose works transcend the times and places in which they were produced. But in the American cinema, individual artistic styles exist in the context of a larger, national style. It was against the background of this general style, which has come to be known as classical Hollywood style, that the distinct individual styles of directors such as John Ford, Alfred Hitchcock, Howard Hawks, Josef von Sternberg, Orson Welles, Martin Scorsese, James Cameron, the Coen brothers, and others took shape. Every American ilm—from recognized masterpieces such as Citizen Kane (1941), which transcends stylistic convention, to run-of-the-mill program pictures such as Andy Hardy Gets Spring Fever (1939), which merely observes convention—draws on the fundamental stylistic principles of classical Hollywood cinema for its means of expression and, in doing so, conveys “the temper of an age and a nation” as well as that of the artists who produce it. Yet every ilm also articulates this style in a different way, inlecting the larger, national style with the individual accent(s) of particular studios, producers, directors, writers, stars, camerapersons, and other craftspeople who make ilms.\n\nA Narrative Machine Unlike the periods of art history, such as the Gothic, Renaissance, or Baroque, in which the overall stylistic features of each period are quite apparent even to the untrained eye, classical Hollywood cinema possesses a style that is largely invisible and dificult for the average spectator to see. Its invisibility is, in large part, the product of American cinema’s proiciency as a narrative machine. Like the industry-based, assembly-line process innovated by Henry Ford and his peers in the business world to make the production of automobiles and other consumer goods as streamlined and economical as possible, American movies rapidly evolved during the 1910s and 1920s into a highly eficient mode of telling stories. Every aspect of the production operation was geared up to facilitate the smoothest possible low of the narrative process. As a result, the narrative is delivered so effortlessly and eficiently to the audience that it appears to have no source. It comes magically off the screen as if spontaneously creating itself in the presence of the spectators in the movie theater for their immediate consumption and pleasure. But, in fact, it is created; it is made according to classical principles of clarity, simplicity, elegance, order, economy, and symmetry. Classical works thus traditionally avoid excess, subjectivity, and undue emotionalism, striving for the Greek ideal of meden agan, or “nothing in excess.”\n\nChapter 2\n\nClassical Hollywood Cinema: Narration\n\n23 ■ ■ ■ ■ ■\n\nEQUILIBRIUM AND DISRUPTION\n\nCourtesy of Paramount\n\nNarrative process follows an orderly pattern in which an initial state of affairs is introduced, after which something occurs to disturb this equilibrium. Subsequent events attempt to restore the original status quo, but this is repeatedly frustrated, and order is recovered only at the end of the ilm. For instance, Alfred Hitchcock’s Rear Window (1954) begins with a statement of the narrative status quo, presenting a survey of the courtyard in which the action of the ilm will be set. The next few minutes of the ilm introduce the minor characters who live in the courtyard, as well as the ilm’s major character, the news magazine photographer L. B. Jeffries (James Stewart), whose point of view provides us with a perspective on the action that will follow. Once the world of the ilm is described, its equilibrium is suddenly disrupted with the introduction of a lovers’ quarrel between Jeffries and his girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly), and with a scream from a woman across the way, whom Jeffries subsequently suspects was murdered by her husband. The action that follows moves toward a resolution of the conlict between Jeffries\n\nThe narrative status quo—the courtyard in which the action of Rear Window is set.\n\n24\n\nPART 1 The Mode of Production\n\n■ ■ ■ ■ ■\n\nand his girlfriend, toward the proof that a murder has taken place, and toward a solution of that crime. With the completion of these actions, order is restored, and the ilm concludes with another survey of the courtyard, revealing the new status quo. Classical narratives routinely begin with an act that disturbs the original state of things and is answered, by the ilm’s end, with another act that reestablishes a new order or balance. Thus a murder mystery, whether a private eye ilm of the 1940s (The Maltese Falcon, 1941) or a police picture of the 1990s (Se7en, 1995), will begin with the discovery of a dead body and end with the solution of the crime. An adventure story or quest (Raiders of the Lost Ark, 1981) is launched with the loss, absence, or lack of a desired object and concludes with its attainment (or at least discovery). A love story (Pretty Woman, 1990) starts with a chance encounter and culminates with a proposal of marriage. A monster (Jaws, 1975) or horror (Halloween, 1978) ilm begins with the death of an innocent victim and ends with the actual or symbolic death of the thing, which is routinely reincarnated for the sequel(s). In between the beginning and the end of the ilm’s overall narrative action, a series of additional, smaller disturbances take place, followed by tentative restorations of order, with each scene or sequence recapitulating the larger process of balance, disruption, and rebalancing of the ilm as a whole. In this way, the narrative moves ceaselessly toward closure, completion, conclusion.\n\nCHARACTERS AND GOALS Problem Solving As David Bordwell explains, classical Hollywood cinema is primarily a character-centered cinema. Its characters are more or less stable, knowable, and psychologically coherent individuals who possess clearly deined, speciic goals. Although this cinema is also a plot-driven or action cinema, characters stand at the center of the action and interact with events. Filmmakers use these interactions in accordance with the classical principles of narrative economy and eficiency to further the exposition of their characters. Plot expectations are set by the speciic goals that individual characters possess or by the problems they are asked to solve. Over the course of the narrative, characters struggle to achieve their goals or solve their problems. They overcome those who stand in their way (such as the villains), triumph over adverse circumstances (such as physical disability, nature, or some other force), and/or transcend their own limitations (such as individual fears or weaknesses). The narrative ends with the\n\nChapter 2\n\nClassical Hollywood Cinema: Narration\n\n25 ■ ■ ■ ■ ■\n\ncharacter’s triumph or failure, with the resolution (or conclusive nonresolution) of the problem, and with the attainment (or clear-cut nonattainment) of the goal. In Vertigo (1958), former detective Scottie Ferguson (James Stewart), who suddenly discovers that he suffers from acrophobia, becomes the unwitting victim of an elaborate murder scheme that takes advantage of his fear of heights in order to effect a perfect crime. Though Scottie’s larger goals in the narrative remain obscure, by the end of the ilm, his more immediate goals have been satisied. He reestablishes the balance or equilibrium with which the ilm begins: he not only discovers the deception and solves the mystery, but also cures his vertigo (although he loses the great love of his life in the process). Much as classical mystery narratives such as Vertigo enlist audiences in the process of problem solving, classical suspense narratives regularly take shape around the forward movement of characters’ attempts to attain goals and around the backward or sideways movements of the delays they experience in trying to overcome the various obstacles that stand (or are placed) between them and their goals. For example, the action in The Terminator (1984) is constructed around the efforts of a cyborg (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who was sent back in time by a totalitarian regime in the future (ca. 2029). He has been programmed to kill a woman, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), to prevent her from bearing a child who is destined to lead a rebellion against that dictatorship. At the same time, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), a (human) rebel freedom ighter, is also sent back in time to prevent the cyborg, or Terminator, from accomplishing his task. The dramatic structure of the ilm consists of alternating sequences in which each of these major characters sets about attempting to solve problems and to reach goals only to discover that his or her attempts have been frustrated by the countereffort of the other. Both Reese and the Terminator pursue their goals relentlessly—to their own self-destruction. At this point, the ilm concludes (with Reese dead but victorious)—only to ind its narrative resolution reopened seven years later in Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991).\n\nThrough Time and Space Often the goals that organize a classical Hollywood narrative are given a precise temporal dimension—a speciic deadline has to be met or a certain task has to be completed by a deinite time. Near the start of Brewster’s Millions (1985), the sixth remake of a popular plot idea that irst reached the screen in 1914, Brewster (Richard Pryor) is told by a somewhat sadistic philanthropist that he will be given $300 million, provided that he can spend $1 million a day for 30 days without acquiring any tangible property or assets. The remainder of the ilm documents his efforts to meet this deadline.\n\n26\n\nPART 1 The Mode of Production\n\nAlice (Mia Wasikowska) is about to fall into a rabbit-hole that will take her to Underland.\n\nBuster Keaton also milks the inheritance idea for suspense comedy in Seven Chances (1925), in which his character discovers that he will inherit $7 million if he can get married by 7:00 p.m. on his 27th birthday, which happens to be that very day. After getting a quick brush-off from his irst seven choices for possible brides, Keaton literally runs through the rest of the movie looking for someone to marry, racing against the clock to meet the 7:00 deadline. In Inception (2010), Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his team have the length of a non-stop light from Sydney to Los Angeles (ca. 12 hours and 45 minutes) to plant an idea in the subconscious mind of the heir to a global energy empire. In a similar way, stories are routinely designed along spatial lines, with their characters moving toward precise destinations or geographical goals. Journeys and cross-country treks have served as the fundamental organizing principle for narratives since Homer’s Odyssey. The journey provides the basic structure for a number of extremely popular motion pictures, ranging from The Wizard of Oz (1939), Around the World in 80 Days (1956), and North by Northwest (1959), to 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), Apocalypse Now (1979), and Alice in Wonderland (2010), where Alice journeys to Underland then sets sail for China. Even in those instances in which the inal destination is never announced, made clear, or reached, the voyage becomes suficient in itself to hold the narrative on course, giving it an all-important sense of forward movement. By the ends of these journeys, the characters not only move from point A to point Z, but they realize other nonspatial goals as well, making deadlines, solving mysteries, falling in love, discovering new worlds, and coming to terms with themselves and their fellow travelers. The purely physical movement of the characters through space provides a sense of narrative development that\n\nCourtesy of Walt Disney Pictures\n\n■ ■ ■ ■ ■\n\nChapter 2\n\nClassical Hollywood Cinema: Narration\n\n27 ■ ■ ■ ■ ■\n\nis immediately coherent, no matter how obscure or incoherent the logic of the dramatic action actually is (as in 2001). The journey ilm always looks forward to getting there; as a result, the spectator always arrives, even when the characters do not and even when “there” is only a hastily tacked-on title that reads “The End.”\n\nHIGH ARTIFICE, INVISIBLE ART Denial and Recognition Ironically, the invisibility of classical Hollywood cinema is the result of great artiice. Its transparency is only an illusion. Beneath the apparent artlessness of the surface lies a solid foundation of highly crafted narrative techniques that all share the same common goal and participate in the same dual mission. They function to deliver the story as powerfully as possible without interrupting its low with intrusive marks or signs that might betray the fact that the story is itself a product of careful construction. Most spectators are aware, either consciously or unconsciously, that ilms are not real—that is, that the blood they see in the shower sequence of Psycho (1960) is really chocolate sauce; that the dangerous stunt sequences in the Indiana Jones ilms are made using doubles; that the attack on the Death Star in Star Wars (1977) is shot using models and miniatures at George Lucas’s special-effects house, Industrial Light & Magic; and that no one really dies during the making of the Terminator ilms. At the same time, most spectators also deny—out of "
