Interestingly, when Condorito and Coné reach the highest part of the temple and meet again with the extraterrestrials, there could be a reference to Indiana Jones' encounter with Interdimensional beings at the end of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Additionally, at the end of the film, the Condor Mummy is shown wearing a similar bag to Indy's.\n\nDeadpool 2 – The shot of Deadpool fleeing an angry mob towards his getaway vehicle was composed as an homage to Indiana Jones' pursuit by the Hovitos.\n\nDespicable Me 2: When Felonious Gru suspects that Eduardo Perez is actually the supposedly deceased supervillain El Macho, he follows him to his secret lair during his party of Cinco de Mayo, where he finds that to access to the lair, he has to go through a platform that activates the door access code sounds music, very similar to the wall-mounted poison dart launchers chamber of the Temple of the Chachapoyan Warriors from Raiders of the Lost Ark.\n\nDora and the Lost City of Gold: The film's climax takes inspiration from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade - upon finding a part of of Parapata's treasure, Alejandro Gutierrez fails to open the doors leading to the city's greatest treasure and falls into a deathly trap while Dora Márquez succeeds on opening it, to which Princess Kawillaka assures her that she chose wisely, much like when the Grail Knight congrats Indiana Jones for selecting the Holy Grail whereas Walter Donovan selected the False Grail. Swiper the Fox then removes the main gold statue, leading to the destruction of Parapata's entrance similar to how Elsa Schneider causes the Temple of the Sun by trying to get away with the Holy Grail and both Dora and Kawillaka see each other one last time before the former leaves with her friends and family like how Indy and the Grail Knight do. The main difference, of course, is that both Gutierrez and Swiper survived.\n\nDuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp: As well as the utilizing the same font as the Indiana Jones films, promotional material - including one by Indiana Jones movie poster artist Drew Struzan - shows Scrooge McDuck sporting a fedora and carrying a rope over one shoulder similar to Jones and his bullwhip which does not occur in the feature itself.\n\nFanboys: While the plot of the movie concerns a group of Star Wars fans breaking into Skywalker Ranch to see a rough cut of Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace in 1998, Indiana Jones items are seen and mentioned as being part of the ranch's prop collection. Lines from the movies are quoted and the three theatrical posters sit on the wall of George Lucas's office.\n\nFinding 'Ohana: When Pili talks with her brother Ioane during their stay at Hawaii, he tries to scare her by telling that if she meets the local Night Marchers, they will melt her face off like the scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark where the Nazis get killed.

The title character, however, was renamed to Tad Stone/Stones in the English and Latin Spanish dub. The movie's plot, similar to Raiders of the Lost Ark and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull due its storytelling and setting, involves Tadeo Jones searching the lost Incan city of Pahititi at Peru along the Peruvian guide Freddy, fellow archaeologist Sarah Lavrof and in company of Tadeo's dog Jeff and Sarah's mute parrot Belzoni. Their plan is to find the city before the evil artifacts hunter corporation Odysseus, Inc. leaded by the evil Kopponen could find the city and become immortal. Sarah's father, Professor Lavrof is a reference to the unseen character of Abner Ravenwood, while Professor Humbert seems to reference National Museum curator Marcus Brody and the film's main antagonist Max Mordon to René Emile Belloq.

Drake, Kate Houghton, Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck discover that the \"Blue Monkey\" diamond is in a small temple full of booby traps which shoot darts that are forced to cross to be able to take the diamond, the scene plays similar to the iconic opening sequence at the Temple of the Chachapoyan Warriors of Raiders of the Lost Ark.\n\nThe Majestic: The Chachapoyan Fertility Idol from the opening sequence of Raiders of the Lost Ark appears in a fictional movie scene called \"The Sand Pirates Of The Sahara\".\n\nMarvel Cinematic Universe\n\nAvengers: Age of Ultron: Brian Tyler's music score for the film pays homage to John Williams' score for Raiders of the Lost Ark (as well as Star Wars and Superman: The Movie).\n\nAvengers: Endgame: When War Machine and Nebula time travel back to 2014 to obtain the Orb before Star-Lord on Morag, War Machine warns his companion that the Orb's tomb must have skeletons on spikes and traps because it's how many other temples with artifacts are protected, indirectly referencing Raiders of the Lost Ark, including Forrestal's fate.\n\nAvengers: Infinity War: When Ebony Maw attempts to obtain the Time Stone from around Doctor Strange's neck, his palm is severely burned thanks to Strange's protective spell in a manner similar to how Toht received the imprint of the Headpiece to the Staff of Ra on his hand in Raiders of the Lost Ark.\n\nBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever: When Princess Shuri of Wakanda is given some Talokani attire to meet with Namor while in the underwater city of Talokan, Riri Williams warns her that it's a supervillain trope for the bad guys to give clothes, citing \"that white chick from Indiana Jones\" as an example, referring the tent seduction scene between Marion Ravenwood and René Emile Belloq in Raiders of the Lost Ark.\n\nCaptain America: The First Avenger: The Red Skull dismisses Adolf Hitler as \"digging for trinkets in the desert\", a nod to the Nazis' search for the Ark of the Covenant at Tanis.
