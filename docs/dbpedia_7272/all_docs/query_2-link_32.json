Swiper the Fox then removes the main gold statue, leading to the destruction of Parapata's entrance similar to how Elsa Schneider causes the Temple of the Sun by trying to get away with the Holy Grail and both Dora and Kawillaka see each other one last time before the former leaves with her friends and family like how Indy and the Grail Knight do. The main difference, of course, is that both Gutierrez and Swiper survived.\n\nDuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp: As well as the utilizing the same font as the Indiana Jones films, promotional material - including one by Indiana Jones movie poster artist Drew Struzan - shows Scrooge McDuck sporting a fedora and carrying a rope over one shoulder similar to Jones and his bullwhip which does not occur in the feature itself.\n\nFanboys: While the plot of the movie concerns a group of Star Wars fans breaking into Skywalker Ranch to see a rough cut of Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace in 1998, Indiana Jones items are seen and mentioned as being part of the ranch's prop collection.

The title character, however, was renamed to Tad Stone/Stones in the English and Latin Spanish dub.

Their plan is to find the city before the evil artifacts hunter corporation Odysseus, Inc. leaded by the evil Kopponen could find the city and become immortal. Sarah's father, Professor Lavrof is a reference to the unseen character of Abner Ravenwood, while Professor Humbert seems to reference National Museum curator Marcus Brody and the film's main antagonist Max Mordon to Ren√© Emile Belloq.
