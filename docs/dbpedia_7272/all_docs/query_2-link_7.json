        "text": "LOS ANGELES\n\nIs Our Home\n\nEverything you know about Hollywood – the sign, the Walk of Fame, the footprints – we are right next to it. Los Angeles (or “The Angels” in Spanish) is the cultural, financial and commercial center of Southern California. L.A. is also billed as the “creative capital of the world”, boasting the highest percentage of creative workers in the country – with more artists, writers, filmmakers, actors, dancers and musicians living and working in metro L.A. than any other city.\n\nA Timeline\n\nHistory Always in the Making\n\nARTS & CULTURE\n\nFilm\n\nFor over a hundred years of moviemaking, L.A.’s studios have shot everything from legendary silent movies to the newest ground-breaking blockbuster.\n\nMajor studios like Universal, Warner Brothers and Paramount Pictures all have tours for long-time Hollywood movie fans. For the more indie-minded, there is the New Beverly Cinema, where owner Quentin Tarantino screens classic and cult films on 35mm, as well as reels from his private collection.\n\nExploring the city, you’ll recognize many iconic locations from both film and TV. Downtown L.A.’s Union Station, The Bradbury Building, Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel and Ennis House are just some of L.A.’s most famous filming landmarks. The natural landscape of Los Angeles is notable too – from Santa Monica Beach seen in Baywatch to Vasquez Rocks used for Star Trek.\n\nMusic\n\nMusic is an integral part of Los Angeles. Our very own campus was once the historic RCA Studio B, used by artists such as Elvis and The Rolling Stones and just up the street from us is the iconic Capital Records Building.\n\nL.A. boasts many world-class venues such as the Nokia Theatre or the Dolby Theatre, where the Oscars® are held each year. The show-stopping Walt Disney Concert Hall is an architectural experience and California’s perfect weather allows for concerts at the outside amphitheaters of the Hollywood Bowl, Greek Theatre and John Anson Ford Theatre.\n\nFor a more intimate setting, check out L.A.’s historic venues like The Wiltern, Hollywood Palladium or the Roxy, famous for live recordings by legends like Bob Marley, Frank Zappa and Bruce Springsteen.\n\nMuseums and Galleries\n\nThere are 841 museums and art galleries in the city of Los Angeles. That is more museums than any other city in the world. Notable museums include LACMA (the largest art museum in the Western U.S), the Getty Center (part of the J. Paul Getty Trust, the world’s wealthiest art institution) and L.A.’s Natural History Museum.\n\nAlong the Miracle Mile, there’s Museum Row where you can explore everything from cars in The Petersen Automotive Museum and The Oscars® in the Academy Museum to L.A.’s prehistoric past with the La Brea Tar Pits.\n\nPerforming Arts\n\nThere are more theatres in L.A. than anywhere else in the U.S. Our school is just blocks away from the landmark Pantages Theatre, which brings all the Broadway hits to Hollywood. A little further down sits the Magic Castle, a secretive venue which hosts magic shows, big and small, for its members and their guests.\n\nDowntown has The Los Angeles Music Center, one of the largest performing arts centers in the country. The center includes: the Disney Concert Hall, Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Ahmanson Theatre, Mark Taper Forum among others. Welcoming over a million people each year, it is the place to see the L.A. Philharmonic, L.A. Opera as well as dances, stage plays and art festivals.\n\nFashion\n\nEveryone loves California style. From La Brea Avenue’s vintage clothing shops to Rodeo Drive’s luxury boutiques, there’s something for everyone in Los Angeles. The hub of L.A.’s fashion industry, however, is downtown’s Fashion District. With one hundred blocks with over 2,000 independently-owned retail spaces, the L.A. Fashion District is the one-stop shop for designers, buyers and retailers.\n\nSports\n\nL.A. is a sports mecca with ten major league professional teams, including decorated teams like the L.A. Lakers and the L.A. Dodgers. The Lakers have won 16 NBA championships and The Dodgers have five World Series titles. With venues like the Staples Center at L.A. Live, Dodger’s Stadium and L.A. Coliseum, to say sports are a favorite pastime for Angelenos, is an understatement.\n\nFood\n\nFrom food trucks to James Beard Award-winning restaurants, the food scene of Los Angeles is bustling and dynamic. Whether you’re craving street tacos or an organic, vegan, gluten-free meal, California cuisine has you covered. Less than a mile from our campus is one California’s greatest culinary institutions, In-N-Out Burger. Founded in 1948, In-N-Out was the first drive-thru hamburger stand in California. Occasionally visiting our school with their food truck, we couldn’t be happier to be neighbors!\n\nFUN FACTS about L.A.\n\nDid You Know…\n\nThe Zamboni, the ice rink re-surfacing machine, was invented in L.A. Using a hydraulic cylinder from an A-20 plane, a chassis from an oil derrick, a Jeep engine and a wooden bin; Frank Joseph Zamboni, Jr. created the first one in 1949.\n\nThere are more cars than people in Los Angeles.\n\nFor all its glitz and glamour, affluent Beverly Hills was once known as the Hammel and Denker Ranch, growing lima beans before it was incorporated in 1914.\n\nThere are at least 11 miles of hidden Prohibition-era tunnels under the city of Los Angeles. Running from Spring and Temple to 1st and Grand in downtown, the tunnels were used to transport people, money and liquor to underground speakeasies.\n\nIt is illegal to lick a toad in Los Angeles, specifically the Sonoran Desert Toad. These toads secrete a highly toxic, hallucinogenic venom.\n\nThe L.A. County Coroner has a gift shop, Skeletons in the Closet, open to the public.\n\nDowntown L.A. has the world’s shortest incorporated railway, Angel’s Flight. The 117-year-old funicular gives passengers a short ride up Bunker HiIl and for $1 you can enjoy a trip made famous by Hollywood movies and TV.\n\nThe largest boulder ever transported can be found at LACMA (Los Angeles County Museum of Art). The 340-ton block of granite took 11 days to move just 85 miles to its final destination.\n\nThrill-seekers can slide down a portion of the 72-story U.S. Bank Tower in downtown Los Angeles, advertised as “tallest open-air observation deck in California”."
