        "text": "As people who read the very first post of this blog will know, Jack Pickford is of great interest to me. Recently while wading through some of the great magazines and journals available through the Media History Digital Library, I came across a surprisingly large number of Pickford pictures and stills from films now thought to be lost forever. I thought it would be nice to bring them together here, and maybe start a series of picture posts about lost films. Anyhow, I hope you enjoy these rarities.\n\nGREAT EXPECTATIONS (1917)\n\nWILDFLOWER (1914)\n\nA STRANGE ADVENTURE (1917)\n\nTHE DUMMY (1917)\n\nHUCK AND TOM (1918)\n\nWITH OLIVE THOMAS ON THE SET OF TOM SAWYER OR HUCK AND TOM\n\nTHE GHOST HOUSE (1917)\n\nJACK AND JILL (1917)\n\nTHE GIRL AT HOME (1917)\n\nWHAT MONEY CAN’T BUY (1917)\n\nFRECKLES (1917)\n\nTHE VARMINT (1917)\n\nBILL APPERSON’S BOY (1919)\n\nTHE LITTLE SHEPHERD OF KINGDOM COME (1920)\n\nTHE PRETTY SISTER OF JOSE (1915)\n\nHIS MAJESTY, BUNKER BEAN (1918)\n\nFinally we have a picture from an unidentified film. Does anyone have any ideas where it might be from? It would be from a film from 1917 or earlier."
