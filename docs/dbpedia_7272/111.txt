Bunker Bean is a meek office clerk. He asks his boss for a raise and is rudely rejected. He's a push-over. He visits a fortune teller who tells him that he is the reincarnation of Napoleon. He gains a fresh sense of power and uses it in his life, even with the daughter of the boss. He inherits a patent from a dead uncle which his work company needs and a large amount of cash. The fortune teller is a crook and starts working another scam on him.

Lucille Ball has a minor role. She has sass but doesn't get to do much. The lead is a little too good at being meek. He's not the most leading of leading men. I really love the Napoleon premise but they could have taken it much further. I don't condone the spanking but it's hilarious. There is a lot of fun potential and it is able to do some of it. The uncle inheritance is way too convenient. It's cheating the story construction. I would be more impressed if the story doesn't need to pull something out of the blue to make it work. This needs some rewriting and a better lead but the overall premise holds real comedic promise.
