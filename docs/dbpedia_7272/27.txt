(1867–1939). American writer Harry Leon Wilson won wide popularity with his humorous novels and plays. Among the best known of his novels are Bunker Bean (1912), Ruggles of Red Gap (1915), and Merton of the Movies (1922).

Wilson was born on May 1, 1867, in Oregon, Illinois. When he was young, he helped set type for his father’s newspaper. Wilson left school at age 16 and shortly thereafter became a stenographer for the Union Pacific Railroad and then helped to gather stories from pioneers. He also began to submit stories to Puck, a humorous magazine that featured cartoons, caricatures, and political satire. From 1892 to 1896 Wilson worked as an assistant editor at Puck, and in 1896 he became editor, staying there until 1902. That year Wilson married his second wife, Rose Cecil O’Neill (divorced 1907). She was known as the creator of the Kewpie doll but was also a writer and illustrator. Wilson’s first book was The Spenders: A Tale of the Third Generation (1902), and O’Neill illustrated it; she would go on to illustrate several of Wilson’s other books.
