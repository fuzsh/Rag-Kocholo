        "text": "Borussia Dortmund chief Sebastian Kehl has poured cold water on rumours that Manchester City have a deal in place to sign Erling Haaland in the summer.\n\nHaaland, regarded as one of the hottest prospects in world football, is set to leave Dortmund when his €75m release clause becomes active at the end of the season.\n\nThe 21-year-old has netted 82 times in 85 appearances for the German club and will not be short of suitors as he plots his next steps, with City, Manchester United, Barcelona, and Real Madrid all said to be vying for his signature, among others.\n\n16 Conclusions: Liverpool beat Man City in FA Cup semi-final\n\nReports have claimed that money will not be a major factor in Haaland’s decision, and that he will instead base his choice on the ‘sporting project’ a club can offer. This has seen the United option dismissed already, with City thought to be the current favourites to land the Norway international.\n\nIn fact, it was reported last month that Haaland to City could be a foregone conclusion, after Dortmund advisor Matthias Sammer appeared to hint that a deal was in place between the two parties. “I’m very excited to see how the Guardiola-Haaland combination will work if it comes to that,” he said in an interview with Amazon Prime.\n\nKehl has now shot down these rumours, replying with a firm “no” when asked by Sky Deutschland if any club had expressed a formal interest in activating Haaland’s release clause.\n\nHe then admitted: “There is a release clause, you know, and there is a deadline.\n\n“We want to make a decision as soon as possible. Erling always wants to play and you always try to make a good decision together with him.”\n\nIn other news, legendary right-back Dani Alves declared last week that Paris Saint-Germain’s Kylian Mbappé is a more complete player than Haaland.\n\nPlaying the role of Barcelona sporting director, Alves told Mundo Deportivo: “I wouldn’t go all out for Haaland. Honestly, I wouldn’t spend a lot of money on him.\n\n“On Mbappe yes, but not on Haaland. I’m playing sporting director, but I’d go for Mbappe first, I think he’s more complete in every aspect.”"
