        "text": "Supporters are used to being let down by their club. Frequent disappointment is part of the one-way deal.\n\nBut in Dortmund, things are different; up to a point at least. The club’s “Echte Liebe” (real love) tagline is easily dismissed as a cynical marketing ploy, but Dortmund try harder than most to live up to the implied promise of reciprocal devotion. The Westphalians have been at the forefront of attempts to make football in Germany as inclusive as possible and have shown a genuine concern for addressing social ills such as racism, antisemitism and homophobia inside the ground and beyond. Thanks to Edin Terzic, the former Yellow Wall regular turned head coach, the traditional boundaries between fans and proponents have also been blurred.\n\nThat renewed sense of being all in it together became movingly apparent when the 40-year-old cried in front of the “Sud” stand as 25,000 were chanting his name in the wake of BVB’s draw with Mainz 05 on the last day of the season. Far from creating division and anger, the team’s late stumble in the title race only strengthened the emotional bond between supporters and those tasked with delivering happiness. Terzic knew what it felt like up on the terraces to see your dreams shattered. Their pain was his.\n\nFor die-hard supporters such as Larissa (who, like all fans quoted in this article want to use their first name only), an editor at digital fanzine schwatzgelb.de, the communal spirit on show in May far outweighed the sadness of losing out on the championship. Like many members of BVB’s active fan scene, she couldn’t wait for the new campaign to start and bring everyone together in Black and Yellow colours again.\n\nThen Dortmund signed midfielder Felix Nmecha from VfL Wolfsburg a week ago. Sporting defeats bear no comparison to the dismay she and other LGBTQI+ supporters have felt over the way the club has handled the transfer of the 22-year-old Germany international.\n\n“We’ve been getting many messages from people affected who are disappointed and can’t believe what’s happened,” Larissa, who describes herself as queer, tells The Athletic. “Dortmund have made a reputation for themselves as role models fighting discrimination in recent years, but they don’t quite understand what the problem is and what this means.”\n\nShe says that as long as the club or the player fails to make amends, she won’t be going to Signal Iduna Park. A friend will use her season ticket in her place.\n\nIn February, Nmecha, a devout Christian, shared an Instagram post by the American conservative pundit Matt Walsh that mocked the parent of a transgender child. Following a social media backlash, Nmecha posted that he didn’t agree “with the majority of what Matt Walsh says and how he mocks people”, but offered no apology. In another Instagram story that coincided with the beginning of Pride Month in June, he shared a message that equated pride with satanic worship.\n\nWhen rumours about a possible €30million (£25.7m; $33m) transfer to Dortmund intensified at the end of last month, the club’s active fan scene voiced their opposition. Larissa and others wrote articles reminding the club of its Grundwertekodex — a code of universal values adopted at the AGM in November 2022. It states that BVB consider themselves “a diverse, inclusive community” and “a home for all Borussen regardless of age, appearance, gender, sexual identity or orientation, culture, religion, skin colour, nationality or social background”.\n\nOutside the BVB club headquarters, anti-discrimination supporters’ group ballspiel.vereint! held up a banner that implored the club to heed their values as well.\n\nBVB president Reinhold Lunow and chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke met with Nmecha. Lunow admitted to having had “great concerns about him sharing Borussia’s values” before and conceded that the player had posted content “that could certainly be interpreted as homophobic or anti-queer”. But Nmecha, he said, had “assured him” that he shared Dortmund’s universal values and would act accordingly.\n\n“He completely convinced us during intensive talks that he does not hold any transphobic or homophobic beliefs,” Lunow added in a joint statement with Watzke, who was quoted by Suddeutsche Zeitung as describing Nmecha as “a very normal boy” a few days earlier. Sporting director Sebastian Kehl called the new arrival “affable and open” and pleaded for him to be given “a fair chance”. The player was “part of our family, we will of course defend him”, the 43-year-old said. Terzic, meanwhile, expressed the hope that Jude Bellingham’s designated successor could “develop as a footballer and as a person” during his time in Westphalia.\n\nNmecha himself posted a photo of himself embracing VfB Stuttgart’s Josha Vagnoman in a shirt with rainbow colours. “I love all people and don’t discriminate against anyone,” he wrote, insisting later that the offending Instagram stories had been taken “out of context”.\n\nIt all doesn’t quite add up, Christian, a speaker for LGBTQI+ fan group Rainbow Borussen, tells The Athletic. “Nmecha is still young and can learn. But these days, professional footballers are all media-trained. It’s hard to believe he didn’t know what he was posting. He says it (the posts) was taken out of context but he didn’t address the substance of it. He could have distanced himself quite easily. BVB should have done the same, but they prioritised their sporting interests.”\n\nThat neither club nor player saw fit to explicitly disavow those hurtful posts also saddened Larissa. “It’s not enough for four straight men to decide for themselves that Nmecha isn’t homophobic. If only Dortmund and the player would have shown the slightest bit of introspection and distanced themselves. BVB should have condemned the posts as discriminatory bulls**t. But nothing. The damage is already done.”\n\nWhen Dortmund contemplated bringing Mario Gotze back three years after his controversial move to Munich in 2016, the club sought out the opinions of supporters beforehand. It’s a mystery to Rainbow Borussen member Christopher why they weren’t consulted in this case. “As an affected group of people, we would have liked to make our opinions and concerns heard (before the transfer). But we weren’t listened to by the club, unfortunately,” he says.\n\nIt’s the sense that their stance and worries were ignored by their own club that upsets the LGBTQI+ supporters the most. “I think BVB believe, ‘We have done this really well and have been very sensitive’,” Larissa says. “But I don’t feel as if they have really paid attention.”\n\nWatzke didn’t help matters when he implied that opposition to Nmecha’s messages was primarily of concern for a niche section of supporters. “The normal football audience doesn’t care,” he said in Sueddeutsche. “They expect football from football, first and foremost.” (According to a club source, speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect their position, Watzke’s quotes were not approved pre-publication, as is custom in the German press. The broadsheet has not made changes to the article, however.)\n\n“When you suggest that ‘normal fans’ don’t really worry, you’re opening the door for those who want to marginalise and discriminate against minorities,” Christopher says. That fear has been borne out by plenty of anti-LGBTQI+ messages on BVB-related social media channels, Larissa has noted. “If Nmecha isn’t homophobic, he must surely be annoyed that many homophobes have come out with hateful comments in his slipstream. I would love to talk to him and understand why he posted this.”\n\nIt’s important, she adds, to understand that anti-LGBTQI+ hostility is not an abstract problem or “some kind of woke madness”. Just last September, Malte C, a transgender man in Munster, an hour up the road from Dortmund, was beaten to death during the Christopher Street Day Pride parade when he intervened to stop the assailant from insulting participants. Hate is on the rise in Germany. Right-wing party AfD regularly poll around 20 per cent nationwide. In Dortmund, an even more extreme nationalist party has a seat on the council.\n\nChristopher believes one positive that can be taken from this affair is that it is been covered extensively in the German media and has sparked discussion. “This whole thing feels as if it belongs to a different, long-forgotten era. There’s no place in society for homophobia and transphobia, there can be no tolerance of intolerance. But it’s good that it’s not just brushed under the carpet. Supporters are taking a stand. This subject has garnered lots of attention, many people have been made aware of the problem and there is a proper debate about these kinds of comments and conduct.”\n\nBut that doesn’t make cheering on Nmecha in a yellow shirt any more palatable for those hurt by his posts. “I will find it hard (to support him on the pitch),” Christian says. “Sebastian Kehl said, ‘He’s one of us, we will protect him’. But what about protecting us?”\n\nThe club have reportedly hedged their financial risk of signing Nmecha by inserting a heavy penalty clause if he posts any more discriminatory messages. They don’t expect wide-scale protests in the stadium though, unlike the masses of banners on the Sud stand that opposed outside investors taking a piece of the league’s TV rights in May.\n\nMost supporters, as Watzke suspects, probably won’t care much one way or the other about a couple of Instagram posts by a 22-year-old. Maybe a few people might hold their noses and keep ostensibly quiet if Nmecha plays well next season, but only the tiniest minority will feel strong enough to contemplate taking Larissa’s lead and staying away altogether.\n\nAnd that’s the crux of the matter. The Nmecha transfer serves as a painful reminder that even in a crowd of 81,000, one section of fans are, at times, still very much on their own.\n\n(Top photo: Hendrik Deckers/Borussia Dortmund via Getty Images)"
