        "text": "Germany international Niklas Sule moves from Bayern Munich to Borussia Dortmund after putting pen to paper on a four-year contract, both Bundesliga clubs confirmed on Monday.\n\nSule will fulfill his running contract with the German record champions until the end of the season before joining the \"BVB\" on a four-year deal to stay with the current Bundesliga runner up until June 2016.\n\n\"We are delighted that we were able to sign with Niklas Sule on a free transfer and bind him for four years,\" Dortmund's sporting director Michael Zorc said.\n\nIn the run-up, talks about further cooperation between the Bavarians and the defender had failed. Sule, who is supposed to stabilize Dortmund's shaky defense, transferred from Hoffenheim to Bayern in 2017 but was repeatedly ruled out with injuries.\n\n\"In personal talks, Niklas has shown us that he is very interested in Borussia Dortmund. He has a lot of experience and the necessary physique to take the next step with us from the summer,\" Dortmund's designated sports director Sebastian Kehl said.\n\nDortmund's 27-year-old new arrival started his professional career at Hoffenheim and played overall 213 Bundesliga appearances, providing 12 goals and 6 assists. He made 32 appearances in the UEFA Champions League and scored once.\n\nThe defender is since 2016 part of Germany's national team and marked one goal in 37 outings. With Bayern Munich, Sule was able to lift four Bundesliga titles and the UEFA Champions League trophy in 2020."
