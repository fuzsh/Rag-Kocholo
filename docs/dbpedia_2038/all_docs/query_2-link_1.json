But Arminia, who spent much of last season fighting for their survival, also kicked off the new campaign with a victory. The U23s earned a point at the Alm last season in a 2-2 draw.<\\/p>\\n<p><b>Personnel matters:<\\/b>&nbsp;Coach Jan Zimmermann made three changes to the starting line-up compared to the 3-0 win against SpVgg Unterhaching. Silas Ostrzinski kept goal for the first time this season. Michael Eberwein, who paved the way for the opening-game victory with a brace, was given the nod over Rodney Elongo-Yombo in attack. Niklas Jessen also made his first start. He came into the team in place of Patrick Göbel.<\\/p>\\n<p><b>The match &amp; analysis:<\\/b>&nbsp;BVB initially sat back, were defensively compact and allowed the hosts to have possession in front of the 19,914 spectators, including approximately 2,000 BVB fans. When they had the ball the Black &amp; Yellows, who had only two over-23 players in their starting line-up, predominantly applied pressure via Antonio Foti and Guille Bueno down the left flank, but it did not result in really good opportunities. A first warning shot from Eberwein from long range was safely parried to the side by Bielefeld goalkeeper Jonas Kersken (14).<\\/p>\\n<p>Despite their first tentative forays towards goal, Dortmund hardly allowed themselves to be drawn out of defence&nbsp;\\u2013 and so Bielefeld's half-hearted attacks did not pose them any problems.&nbsp;Two ultimately harmless attempts from Biankadi (26) and Corboz (27) failed to trouble Ostrzinski.<\\/p>\\n<p>The first minor setback for Dortmund came in the 31st minute. Left-back Bueno had to be substituted with an injury. The 21-year-old was replaced on the field by&nbsp;Baran Mogultay.<\\/p>\\n<p>Shortly afterwards, the home team's goal was seriously threatened for the first time. Foti dribbled at the Bielefeld defence at tempo, carried the ball past a defender with a feint and then pulled the trigger. However, his shot from a centre-right position landed straight in the arms of Kersken. But Dortmund also had to survive a dangerous situation prior to the interval. A cross into the penalty area flew past home and away players alike before sailing wide of the back post. And so the score remained 0-0 at the end of a dogged opening half.<\\/p>\\n<p>BVB initially allowed the hosts to have the ball at the beginning of the second period too. For their part, Dortmund waited for opportunities to switch the play but were not forceful enough: a shot from Jordi Paulina struck the side-netting (61).<\\/p>\\n<p>In Rodney Elongo-Yombo and Babis Drakas, coach Jan Zimmermann brought on two pairs of fresh legs in attack in the 71st minute. Things then immediately got dangerous&nbsp;\\u2013 but in front of the Dortmund goal. Mogultay made a strong sliding intervention to turn a shot from Bielefeld's&nbsp;Marius Wörl onto the post.<\\/p>\\n<p>The striking of the woodwork served as something of a wake-up call for Bielefeld, who were now clearly in the ascendancy. BVB offered very little in the closing stages. In particular, counter-attacks were sometimes seen through too imprecisely. It was to prove costly. A cross from the right flank was headed into the net by&nbsp;Kaito Mizuto to make it 1-0 (89). But it was not to be the final action. Almost immediately afterwards, Kersken clawed a header from substitute&nbsp;Paul-Philipp Besong away from the corner. And things got even more bitter for BVB. In the fifth minute of stoppage time, Dortmund's Mogultay was red-carded for a professional foul.<\\/p>\\n<p><b>Jan Zimmermann:<\\/b>&nbsp;&quot;My boys are totally disappointed and I also feel really sorry for them because we played a really good away match up until the conceded goal. Tactically, the lads performed outstandingly. Our plan came off with the exception of counter-attacking opportunities that were not always well executed. The fact we then conceded a goal is totally frustrating. Nonetheless, I'm satisfied with my team. We're now going home frustrated. But I believe that we're already at a very good level after two rounds of matches.&quot;<\\/p>\\n<p><b>Outlook:<\\/b>&nbsp;The first round of the DFB-Pokal means that the U23s have a fixture-free weekend coming up..

Silas Ostrzinski kept goal for the first time this season. Michael Eberwein, who paved the way for the opening-game victory with a brace, was given the nod over Rodney Elongo-Yombo in attack. Niklas Jessen also made his first start. He came into the team in place of Patrick Göbel.<\\/p>\\n<p><b>The match &amp; analysis:<\\/b>&nbsp;BVB initially sat back, were defensively compact and allowed the hosts to have possession in front of the 19,914 spectators, including approximately 2,000 BVB fans. When they had the ball the Black &amp; Yellows, who had only two over-23 players in their starting line-up, predominantly applied pressure via Antonio Foti and Guille Bueno down the left flank, but it did not result in really good opportunities. A first warning shot from Eberwein from long range was safely parried to the side by Bielefeld goalkeeper Jonas Kersken (14).<\\/p>\\n<p>Despite their first tentative forays towards goal, Dortmund hardly allowed themselves to be drawn out of defence&nbsp;\\u2013 and so Bielefeld's half-hearted attacks did not pose them any problems.&nbsp;Two ultimately harmless attempts from Biankadi (26) and Corboz (27) failed to trouble Ostrzinski.<\\/p>\\n<p>The first minor setback for Dortmund came in the 31st minute. Left-back Bueno had to be substituted with an injury. The 21-year-old was replaced on the field by&nbsp;Baran Mogultay.<\\/p>\\n<p>Shortly afterwards, the home team's goal was seriously threatened for the first time. Foti dribbled at the Bielefeld defence at tempo, carried the ball past a defender with a feint and then pulled the trigger. However, his shot from a centre-right position landed straight in the arms of Kersken. But Dortmund also had to survive a dangerous situation prior to the interval. A cross into the penalty area flew past home and away players alike before sailing wide of the back post. And so the score remained 0-0 at the end of a dogged opening half.<\\/p>\\n<p>BVB initially allowed the hosts to have the ball at the beginning of the second period too. For their part, Dortmund waited for opportunities to switch the play but were not forceful enough: a shot from Jordi Paulina struck the side-netting (61).<\\/p>\\n<p>In Rodney Elongo-Yombo and Babis Drakas, coach Jan Zimmermann brought on two pairs of fresh legs in attack in the 71st minute. Things then immediately got dangerous&nbsp;\\u2013 but in front of the Dortmund goal. Mogultay made a strong sliding intervention to turn a shot from Bielefeld's&nbsp;Marius Wörl onto the post.<\\/p>\\n<p>The striking of the woodwork served as something of a wake-up call for Bielefeld, who were now clearly in the ascendancy. BVB offered very little in the closing stages. In particular, counter-attacks were sometimes seen through too imprecisely. It was to prove costly. A cross from the right flank was headed into the net by&nbsp;Kaito Mizuto to make it 1-0 (89). But it was not to be the final action. Almost immediately afterwards, Kersken clawed a header from substitute&nbsp;Paul-Philipp Besong away from the corner. And things got even more bitter for BVB. In the fifth minute of stoppage time, Dortmund's Mogultay was red-carded for a professional foul.<\\/p>\\n<p><b>Jan Zimmermann:<\\/b>&nbsp;&quot;My boys are totally disappointed and I also feel really sorry for them because we played a really good away match up until the conceded goal. Tactically, the lads performed outstandingly. Our plan came off with the exception of counter-attacking opportunities that were not always well executed. The fact we then conceded a goal is totally frustrating. Nonetheless, I'm satisfied with my team. We're now going home frustrated. But I believe that we're already at a very good level after two rounds of matches.&quot;<\\/p>\\n<p><b>Outlook:<\\/b>&nbsp;The first round of the DFB-Pokal means that the U23s have a fixture-free weekend coming up.. Afterwards, the Black &amp; Yellows will be on the road again. BVB will pay a visit to Hansa Rostock on Matchday 3 (Saturday 24/8).
