        "text": "Speaking to the media (via Ruhr Nachrichten), Borussia Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl has confirmed that Emre Can will remain as captain.\n\nWhen talking about leadership in the squad, Kehl said:\n\nCan was appointed captain by previous head coach Edin Terzic after Marco Reus stepped down from his duties as club captain. Nuri Sahin’s predecessor turned down the opportunity to sign Edson Alvarez and put his trust in the Frankfurt born midfielder.\n\nThe 30-year-old did an okay job with Dortmund’s armband as they finished fifth in the Bundesliga and reached the Champions League final.\n\nHowever, this summer, the arrival of Pascal Groß means that Can’s position as one of the midfielders in the starting 11 is now under threat as the former Brighton midfielder is a lot more comfortable on the ball than Can which is a quality needed in new head coach Sahin’s style of play."
