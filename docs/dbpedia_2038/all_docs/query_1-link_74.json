        "text": "PLEASE READ\n\n1. Submit players leaving on a free transfers (30.6) from official sites OR trustworthy blogs/sites. Avoid submitting transfers ONLY from transfermarkt, for now, they will be rejected. It's all about quality, not quantity.\n\n2. All summer transfers should be submitted as immediate (starting from the start of the game, NO MORE future transfers).\n\n3. Duration on loans should be -1 year. Example: if a loan ends on June 2025 (in real life), the loan should be submitted until June 2024 (on site). If a loan end on December 2024 (in real life), the loan should be submitted until December 2023 (on site).\n\n4. Those who submit STAFF changes, please provide an official source that shows the transfer/release. Transfermarkt isn't always trustworthy when it comes to staff.\n\n5. If a transfer/staff change IS NOT accepted more than 2 times, that means something. So please, avoid spamming in this crucial period. Time is important.\n\nThanks!"
