        "text": "Borussia Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp has urged in-form veteran midfielder Sebastian Kehl not to retire.\n\nKehl, 34, has been one of the few consistent performers for Dortmund during a season that has so far seen them struggle badly in the Bundesliga but excel in the Champions League, winning four out of four matches in Group D.\n\nAt the weekend, Kehl made his 300th Bundesliga appearance, and his 260th for Dortmund, as they clambered out of the relegation zone with a 1-0 win over Borussia Monchengladbach.\n\nHe joined BVB in January 2002 and captained them to two Bundesliga titles, but earlier this year said he would retire from club football at the end of this season and handed the captaincy to Germany international Mats Hummels.\n\nKlopp said he hoped Kehl, who won 31 Germany caps and was part of the 2002 and 2006 World Cup squads, would think again -- and hinted that he might take matters into his own hands.\n\n\"Should he run and fight like this towards the end of the season and remain healthy, I will personally take care of that he'll stay,\" the coach told reporters.\n\nAnd Kehl indicated that he could reconsider, saying: \"I've been on a good run in recent weeks. It's November now. We are entering the holiday season, and that's a period of reflection.\"\n\nBVB sporting director Michael Zorc echoed Klopp's praise, telling Der Westen: \"It's just outstanding how he is playing right now.\n\n\"We will certainly talk about it [his retirement] again. But let's see if he can stay healthy and continue to play like this, and then we'll see. There is no need to decide that now.\""
