        "text": "Borussia Dortmund have refused to rule out a move for Manchester United forward Mason Greenwood and will make a call after Saturday's Champions League final against Real Madrid.\n\nGreenwood, 22, is expected to return to Old Trafford this summer after spending the season on loan at LaLiga side Getafe, where he scored 8 goals in 33 league appearances and was named their player of the season.\n\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)\n\nJuventus and Atl√©tico Madrid have been linked with a move for the former England international and Dortmund, who took winger Jadon Sancho on loan from United in January, have emerged as a possible destination for Greenwood, who has a year left to run on his United contract.\n\nReports in Germany have suggested that Dortmund are prepared to take Greenwood on loan and, speaking at the club's Champions League final media day, sporting director Sebastian Kehl said all plans are on hold until after Saturday's Wembley clash against Madrid.\n\n\"I don't want to talk about any rumours now at the moment because it makes no sense,\" Kehl said. \"Let's play that final on Saturday.\n\n\"Of course we do have our plans for the next season and of course we discuss many scenarios, but nothing for today. Let's focus, let's anticipate that match on Saturday and then we'll see how we move on.\"\n\nWhen asked if Greenwood is a player that Dortmund admire, Kehl said, \"I don't want to talk about that now.\"\n\nGreenwood has not played for United since appearing in a 1-0 Premier League win against West Ham United at Old Trafford in January 2022. A week later, he was arrested on suspicion of rape and assault, with Greater Manchester Police confirming the existence of \"social media images and videos posted by a woman reporting incidents of physical violence.\" United immediately suspended the then-20-year-old from training and matches \"until further notice.\"\n\nIn October of that year, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) announced that Greenwood would be charged with attempted rape, engaging in controlling and coercive behaviour and assault occasioning actual bodily harm with a trial date set for November 2023.\n\nHowever, the CPS dropped all charges against Greenwood in February 2023 due to \"a combination of the withdrawal of key witnesses and new material that came to light meant there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction.\"\n\nUnited subsequently announced they would undertake their own internal investigation.\n\nThat concluded in August 2023, with the club announcing that Greenwood would not be resuming his career at Old Trafford. United said in a statement: \"All those involved, including Mason, recognise the difficulties with him recommencing his career at Manchester United. It has therefore been mutually agreed that it would be most appropriate for him to do so away from Old Trafford, and we will now work with Mason to achieve that outcome.\"\n\nGreenwood's move to Getafe enabled him to continue his career away from United, but while the Spanish club have an interest in signing him again next season, sources have said that United would prefer a permanent move and transfer fee for the player.\n\nSources have told ESPN that United will trigger a one-year extension on Greenwood's contract if he leaves on loan again this summer in order to retain the prospect of offloading him for a transfer fee next year."
