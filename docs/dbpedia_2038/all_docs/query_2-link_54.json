This is what experts like Paul Scholes and Owen Hargreaves claim.\n\n\"They were great footballers, and they are football experts. But I don't know if they are transfer experts too. That Sancho stays with BVB is set in stone.\"\n\nBefore adding: \"We have a good exchange with his advisors. We acknowledge that Jadon responds very well.\n\n\"And he recognises that we have a good team that gives him a lot of fun playing football. He shows this joy every day now. In training. In the game.\""
