        "text": "Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, Nevada will welcome global soccer heavyweights this summer, as two of the world’s most supported clubs in England’s Manchester United and Germany’s Borussia Dortmund face off on Sunday, July 30 at 6:00 PM. General public tickets go on sale Thursday, April 6 at 9:00 AM PT via Ticketmaster at the link found HERE.\n\nThis fixture will provide fans with the chance to see United’s star-studded squad highlighted by top goal scorer Marcus Rashford, fan favourite Bruno Fernandes and World Cup winner Lisandro Martínez take on the in-form Dortmund that features American star Giovanni Reyna, Dortmund’s top goal scorer in the Bundesliga Julian Brandt and German legend Marco Reus.\n\nThis is the second fixture of United’s summer tour of the US to be announced, after last week they confirmed a clash against Wrexham AFC in San Diego, which sold out in days. The Red Devils will play in Las Vegas for the first time in their history, a significant moment for the club as part of their preparation for the 2023/24 season.\n\nFor Borussia Dortmund, this will be the club’s first visit to the United States since 2019 and their fourth visit ever, with their first trip across the Atlantic taking place in 1954. The club has seen a rise in American followers over the last decade, providing many American players with their first taste of elite European soccer.\n\nUnited have not faced Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund since a 2016 tour game in China and the pair have only played six competitive matches in history – making this summer’s encounter a rare opportunity for US fans to see two of the UK and Europe’s leading football clubs go head-to-head in the entertainment and sports capital of the world, Las Vegas.\n\nManchester United Football Director, John Murtough said:\n\n“We have worked with the manager and his staff to provide a mix of competitive opponents to play during our tour of the US and we look forward to the match against Borussia Dortmund.\n\n“As well as gaining valuable playing time, the squad will also be participating in training camps within the best sporting facilities available, giving our players the opportunity to build fitness before the start of the new Premier League season.\n\n“The response we have received from fans since announcing we will be returning to the US has been incredible. We already have a full house for the match in San Diego and I am sure it will be the same for this fixture in Vegas.”\n\nBVB Managing Director Carsten Cramer said:\n\n“I think back with great pleasure to the summer of 2016 when we played Manchester United in front of a large crowd in Shanghai at the time. Now we look forward to returning to North America, where the market is becoming increasingly important in the run-up to the 2026 World Cup and the enthusiasm for football is growing.\n\nNot only does the Allegiant Stadium look great from the outside, but the enthusiastic fans in the USA, who we have missed since our last visit, will ensure that the game in Las Vegas will hold a special place in BVB's history.”\n\nSporting Director Sebastian Kehl added:\n\n“If you take a look at which major clubs are spending part of their pre-season in the USA this summer, also playing high-profile friendlies as part of it, then it is only logical that we as Borussia Dortmund do not miss out on this either. In the coming weeks, our focus in planning the trip will be on creating the perfect mix between training and matches, as well as interaction with the local people.”\n\n\"Manchester United and Borussia Dortmund are two heavyweights of world football and we are thrilled to bring this clash to Las Vegas,” added Geoff Jones, CEO of TEG Sport.\n\n“This is the next chance for fans to experience Manchester United up close in the US and experience all that the iconic city of Las Vegas has to offer. We expect demand to be strong, with fans from across the US, UK and Europe travelling to Las Vegas for this event.”\n\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION:\n\nAdam Geigerman\n\n+1 (678) 575-9338\n\nadam.geigerman@forsoccer.com\n\nOn behalf of TEG Sport and Left Field Live\n\nTiffany Miller\n\ntmiller@allegiantstadium.com\n\nOn behalf of Allegiant Stadium\n\nABOUT MANCHESTER UNITED\n\nManchester United is one of the most popular and successful sports teams in the world, playing one of the most popular spectator sports on Earth.
