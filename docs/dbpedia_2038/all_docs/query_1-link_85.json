        "text": "Former Ajax director Sven Mislintat has been forced to leave German football club Borussia Dortmund after three months. According to various German media outlets, the technical director has made himself impossible to work with at the finalists of the last UEFA Champions League.\n\nThe 51-year-old Mislintat allegedly has a bad relationship with manager Nuri Sahin. Sporting director Sebastian Kehl allegedly blames the former director of football at Ajax for forcing transfers without discussing them first. Mislintat already worked for Dortmund from 2006 to 2017. He then left the club to join Arsenal in England.\n\nMislintat was fired after four months at Ajax. The German then became the subject of controversy over possible conflicts of interest in transfers. KPMG conducted months of independent research into the German, but could not find any convincing evidence of such a conflict of interest."
