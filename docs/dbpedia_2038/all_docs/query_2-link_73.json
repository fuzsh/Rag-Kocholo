        "text": "The future of 19-year-old wonderkid Jude Bellingham is currently one of the hottest topics in football. The Borussia Dortmund and England midfielder has turned many heads since becoming his club’s youngest ever goal scorer. He’s also the third youngest player in history to win a senior cap for England.\n\nReal Madrid Confident of Signing Jude Bellingham\n\nTeenage Star Attracts Widespread Interest\n\nBellingham is said to be in the crosshairs of a number of big clubs. Manchester City, Chelsea, and Liverpool are all interested in him. But now another major club thinks they will be the ones to win the race.\n\nAccording to Ben Jacobs of CBS Sports, Real Madrid are confident in signing Jude Bellingham next summer for under £100m. This is significantly lower than the reported £130m price tag that some have set for the “football prodigy“.\n\nRead More: Real Madrid Expect More From Ex-Chelsea Star\n\nThe red side of Manchester are also interested in signing Bellingham. Manchester United reportedly put in a bid for the then-16-year-old when he was still a Birmingham City player. They’re still interested in him now, but could be at a serious disadvantage. Jacobs writes that Bellingham considers Champions League football essential, which would damage his chances of joining the faltering United.\n\nChelsea and Manchester United Not Considered Front Runners\n\nAnd then there’s Chelsea, who also recently “joined the race” for the Englishman’s services. Owner Todd Boehly has reportedly stepped in to personally make contact with Bellingham’s representatives as Chelsea look to freshen up their ageing midfield. However, Jacobs lumps Chelsea in with Manchester United as not currently frontrunners in the race for the England international.\n\nIt’s worth mentioning that Bellingham is under contract with Borussia Dortmund until 2025. The club’s sporting director, Sebastian Kehl, is keen on offering the player a new deal come the end of the 2022 World Cup, Having lost other big names like Haaland and Jadon Sancho."
