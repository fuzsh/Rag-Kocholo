Yesterday, I experienced another unforgettable moment. After a 0-3 home loss to Fortuna D√ºsseldorf, the odds were against us. Everything was set up in D√ºsseldorf for a huge party, Campino, lead singer of die Toten Hosen and a huge D√ºsseldorf fan himself said prior to the game that \"it feels like Christmas and Easter on one day\". But Bochum did the impossible: equalizing in the second leg, going into extra time, and finally winning in a penalty shootout - one of the biggest comebacks in German professional football history. Our goalkeeper Andreas Luthe ended his career as a hero. Chatting with colleagues over lunch today, I realized just how excited I still was by what happened. The game really showed how important mental strength and coaching are. These qualities matter just as much in the business world. There is certainly many more important things in this world than football. And yet, a sport like this connects and provides joy to so many people in such a unique way. This passion and dedication are mirrored in our professional challenges. Mental fitness and coaching can turn seemingly impossible situations into successes. Here's to extraordinary comebacks and believers ü§ç üíô ..! photo credit: Reuters #coaching #mentalfitness #comeback #vflbochum VfL Bochum 1848 GmbH & Co. KGaA\n\n‚öΩ The Euros Are Here!!! ‚öΩ As a massive footy fan, I‚Äôm really looking forward to the next 4 weeks of tournament football and hoping FOOTBALL IS COMING HOME!!!! üèÜ As a Leeds United season ticket holder, I‚Äôm also very used to disappointment, so if football doesn‚Äôt come home, I‚Äôm well-equipped to deal with it! üòÇ. So, what are our actual chances of Southgate leading us to our first major tournament win in 58 years? Who knows, but one thing‚Äôs for sure, Southgate has led us to the most success we‚Äôve had in a long time! üåü So how has he done this and what can other leaders inside and outside of football take from this? Build a Team Spirit & Great Culture ü§ù For me, this is where the start of the success began for Southgate! His emphasis on unity, togetherness, pride, and working for each other has built a winning and high-performing culture where everyone has each others back. The team spirit is off the charts and can only impact performance in a positive way! üèÖ Have a Clear Vision and Confidence in your Approach üß† Whether you agree or disagree with Southgate‚Äôs team choices or tactics, you can‚Äôt argue that he always sticks to his guns. He has set a clear vision on how he approaches things both on and off the field. He has undoubtably managed to influence the media to be less critical and join that team sprit to get behind the boys! Some say he‚Äôs too defensive, but you don‚Äôt win tournaments if you leak goals! üö´‚öΩ His approach in setting a clear vision with short, medium, and long-term goals, then bringing the team and the nation on that journey. Nurturing Young Talent üå± Before taking on the full England national team, Southgate led the under-21s, working with and nurturing England‚Äôs youth talent. He‚Äôs brought them through and prepared them well for international duties. There are still some big names in this 2024 England squad that he‚Äôs worked with in the youth setup, like Bukayo Saka, Phil Foden, Conor Gallagher, and Trent Alexander-Arnold, to name a few. He also believes in young talent and gives them a chance! üåü Now, I‚Äôm sure some people will have different views on this, but all I can say is whether you agree or disagree, let‚Äôs get behind the team and pray for football to come home! üôè Let‚Äôs see what the next few weeks bring! Fingers crossed for a victorious tournament! COME ON ENGLAND!!! üèÜüéâ Fruition IT #leaders #euro2024 #footballscominghome\n\nThe truth is - Spain were the best team in the whole tournament - we only created mercurial moments. But let‚Äôs be clear Gareth isn‚Äôt boring ‚Äì his tenure has been brilliant. He is one of the most successful managers England has had. Under his leadership, England has reached the quarter-finals in the last four major tournaments, including the 2018 World Cup and Euro 2020. So aside from the emotion ‚Äì here are his stats Total Matches Managed: 100 Wins: 60 Draws: 23 Losses: 17 Beyond his successful stats, he‚Äôs mentored a generation of talent for 10 years. They have become respected role models and represent our diverse nation. He‚Äôs created one of the strongest team bonds around while only having access to them for 40 days per year. In that window, he‚Äôs built a culture of trust, nurture, challenge and dare I say it love! The ‚Äòoutside‚Äô world can be brutal, judgemental and sometimes unrealistic. They want people to defend and attack perfectly, be disciplined and show flare, be consummate pros and media darlings. Inside this team they felt safe, and valued. Gareth hasn‚Äôt been boring ‚Äì he‚Äôs been a consistent shield, protecting his emerging talent from the ravages. He‚Äôs taken the flak so that they can thrive. He won't be everyone's favourite as his strengths are consistency, integrity and stability. But in times of turbulence, these attributes could be amazing for our leaders in schools, businesses and even politics. Spain won every game and create a record four titles. They excited and entertained and that's what sport should do. As for England's players ‚Äì they didn't fully express themselves and ultimately couldn't pull it off. Gareth will choose when it's time, but whenever that is, his foundation will allow another coach to come in and unlock the creativity and exuberance the team need to dominate on the global stage. So it's not coming home. It‚Äôs the hope that kills you. #SPAENG #Football #Euros2024 #mindset\n\nWinning is crucial in football. But club identity is just as important.

Even if you are not into football ‚Äì and bear with me if you are not ‚Äì he is widely remembered for two things: Uniquely wining the World Cup as a player and a manager and leading Germany‚Äôs venture to host the World Cup 2006. ‚ÄúWhy is this relevant?‚Äù you might ask. It is a great case study for leadership, knowing what you are good at, and to remember that things don‚Äôt always go to plan when life starts throwing stuff at you. Reputation matters. Dialling back time into the 1950s in Germany. Munich. Rather than joining what was then the leading and most established club in town ‚Äì 1860 Munich ‚Äì Beckenbauer joined the underdogs ‚Äì Bayern Munich. It was a personal decision because someone from 1860 had treated him badly. A big step for someone who had admired 1860 for many years and had dreamed of playing for them from a young age. My lesson: treat people well because they might otherwise not join you when you need them, even if you are the best. Even more relevant for VC backed companies and others who rely on a small number of people to make them great. Risk and fear of failure. Beckenbauer was twice parachuted into a tricky situation when Bayern Munich did not perform to its high standards. Almost overnight he took control and in the first instance he won the Bundesliga and the second stint ended with the win of the UEFA Cup. Again, uniquely, he did this without any formal coaching license which is usually a regulatory requirement for a Bundesliga head coach. My lesson: he knew what he was good at and what impact he could have ‚Äì as a player, a coach and a leader. I was privileged to interview him as a journalist when he had successfully completed his mission to make Germany the host of the 2006 World Cup. Despite it being a very stressful day, he dedicated himself 100% to my questions for those few minutes, he was calm, collected and carried an aura that only demonstrated balance, confidence and success. Whether he was liked or not ‚Äì he was true to himself. Based on knowing his expertise at each stage in his life he found the appropriate role to impact the world around him. Performance can come at a price. You can say what you want about Beckenbauer; for example mention his three marriages and the bribery claims surrounding the World Cup hosting. What you can‚Äôt take away from him is that he did not join the best but those who were best for him, he was not afraid of risk and adversity. The results and performance make him unforgotten. My lesson: There is always an option to improve and show impactful performance. Chose your impact and be aware of the price."
