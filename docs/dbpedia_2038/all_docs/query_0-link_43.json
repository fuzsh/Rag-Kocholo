        "text": "Manchester United winger Jadon Sancho’s campaign at Borussia Dortmund began on an emphatic note. However, a permanent deal for Sancho with his former side remains highly unlikely. Sancho made a scintillating comeback to Germany, helping Borussia Dortmund earn a victory on his return.\n\nDespite an impressive show against SV Darmstadt in the Bundesliga, Borussia Dortmund’s sports director Sebastian Kehl feels that signing the former footballer is quite a challenge.\n\nALSO READ| Roma Legend Daniele De Rossi to Replace Jose Mourinho as Head Coach\n\nAs per Sky Sports, this is what Kehl said on Sky90 – “Realistically speaking, it’s not that big. Manchester United paid over 85 million euros for this player two and a half years ago and there was now no way to get a purchase option in any way that was economically feasible for us”.\n\n“The salary will be one thing, the transfer package another. If the player develops the way we hope, then completely different clubs will be active in the summer and then he will probably be a category of player that works for Borussia Dortmund may be difficult to realize on this scale,” Kehl added.\n\nSancho joined Manchester United in 2021 for a transfer fee of £73 Million. The Englishman signed a five-year contract that would see him earn £250,000-a-week at the Premier League outfit. Borussia Dortmund cannot match these astronomical figures due to financial constraints.\n\nALSO READ| Australian Open: Sumit Nagal Shocks World No. 27 Alexander Bublik in Straight Sets\n\nRegardless of the transfer complications, Sancho is off to a great start in his second spell at the German club. He came off the bench to help his side earn a 3-0 victory over SV Darmstadt. Sancho entered the fray in the second half of the contest. The 23-year-old provided an assist to help Marco Reus find the back of the net in the 77th minute.\n\nSancho was left out of the Manchester United squad under coach Erik ten Hag following a rift with the Dutchman. The situation got so intense that the Professional Footballer’s Association (PFA) offered to act as a mediator to improve their relationship.\n\nSancho’s refusal to apologise to Ten Hag is understood to have resulted in the winger leaving Manchester United and joining Borussia Dortmund on a loan move. Sancho is currently contracted to Manchester United until 2026."
