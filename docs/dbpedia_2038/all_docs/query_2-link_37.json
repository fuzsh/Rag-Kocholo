        "text": "Berlin, Jan 12, 2022 (AFP) - Borussia Dortmund can expect to know by the end of February whether star striker Erling Haaland will stay past the end of this season, according to reports in Germany.\n\nThe 21-year-old was named Norway's footballer of the year for the second time in succession on Wednesday.\n\nSpeculation is rife that Haaland will leave Dortmund once the current season finishes, with Europe's top clubs lining up to secure the services of a player who has scored 76 goals in as many matches since joining from Red Bull Salzburg in January 2020.\n\nThe Bild daily reported Haaland and his agent will sit down with Dortmund officials \"in the coming weeks\" with a decision expected \"by the end of February\".\n\nHaaland is under contract until 2024, but a release clause in his contract -- reportedly for around 80 million euros ($90 million) -- became active at the start of 2022.\n\nManchester City, Real Madrid, Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain are all reportedly chasing him.\n\nDortmund has ruled out selling Haaland in the current transfer window, with Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke telling Der Spiegel magazine: \"Who would give away one of the best strikers in Europe during the winter break if he didn't have to?\"\n\nThe club is optimistic they can keep their prize forward.\n\n\"We will try everything to keep Erling at Dortmund. I don't think our chances are bad,\" team manager Sebastian Kehl told Sky before Saturday's win at Eintracht Frankfurt."
