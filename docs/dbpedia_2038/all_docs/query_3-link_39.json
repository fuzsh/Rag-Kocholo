        "text": "Borussia Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl was ecstatic after his squad clinched a spot in the Champions League final bying down Paris Saint-Germain 1-0 (2-0 on aggregate) on Tuesday.\n\nWith a spot already set for the final at Wembley Stadium, Kehl immediate turned his attention to who he would like to see emerge the victor from the Bayern Munich vs. Real Madrid semifinal.\n\nNot surprisingly, Kehl is hoping for an all-German finale.\n\n“I would like Bayern,” said Kehl (as captured by Get German Football News). “I have the feeling we still have a score to settle. We should take the goal down and take it to Dortmund with us. Maybe we’ll need it again at Wembley. It was hell in the dressing room: loud music and alcohol.”\n\nCertainly, 2013 is still stuck in everyone’s memory, but how crazy is it to think that two German teams could make the UCL final — and neither would be the actual best team from Germany this season, who we all now know is Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nThat...is crazy to think about...and with the stage set for Wembley once again, it would be really cool to see Bayern Munich vs. Borussia Dortmund go at it once more 11 years later."
