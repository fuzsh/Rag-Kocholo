        "text": "Borussia Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl has slammed Erling Haaland and claimed he was a 'burden' while at the club.\n\nHaaland moved to Man City this summer from the German side for Â£51m after scoring 86 goals in 89 games for Dortmund.\n\nThe Norwegian striker has been in astonishing form for Pep Guardiola's side, netting 12 times in seven games across the Premier League and Champions League so far.\n\nHaaland spent two and a half seasons with Dortmund after joining from RB Salzburg in December 2019 for a Â£17m fee.\n\nIn spite of being prolific while at the Westfalenstadion, Kehl was critical of the wider impact that Haaland had on the team by the end of his stay with the club.\n\n'As much as we have always appreciated Erling and the success he has had with our shirt, in the end the matter had definitely become a burden, both in the dressing room and for the club,' he told Sport Bild.\n\n'In general, for the whole environment, it was just him.Â The timing of the sale was right, both for us and for City. The fact that our first 10 goals this season have been scored by 10 different players proves it.'\n\nKehl also believes Haaland's departure has benefitted the squad as a whole going into this season.\n\n'I would have liked to have been certain (about the Norwegian's departure) a little earlier, because that issue limited our preparation.\n\n'Without him, we have the possibility to trust the other players. The fact that our first ten competitive goals have been scored by ten different players shows that pretty well.'\n\nKehl's comments come just days before Haaland faces his former club with Man City hosting the German side at the Etihad on Wednesday evening in the Champions League."
