        "text": "Football news - Sebastian Kehl: Borussia Dortmund are not planning to sell Erling Haaland\n\nByAlexander Netherton\n\nUpdated 03/04/2021 at 16:56 GMT\n\nBorussia Dortmund director Sebastian Kehl said on Saturday that his side are not making plans to sell their 20-year-old Norwegian striker Erling Haaland this summer. The forward is wanted by Real Madrid, Barcelona, Manchester City and potentially other clubs ahead of the summer transfer window, with a release clause kicking in next summer.\n\nErling Haaland - Borussia Dortmund\n\nImage credit: Getty Images\n\nBorussia Dortmund director Sebastian Kehl has said that the team are not planning to sell Erling Haaland this summer.\n\nHaaland has been linked with a move away in the summer with agent Mino Raiola and father Alfie-Inge Haaland pictured in Spain as they reportedly held talks with Barcelona and Real Madrid, and they are expected to visit Manchester for talks with one or both of Manchester City and United.\n\nChelsea are also said to be in the hunt for the 20-year-old Norwegian international, who has a release clause of 75 million euros that kicks in during the summer of 2022.\n\nTransfers\n\nMan City target £68m Eze, PSG in talks to sign Man Utd's Sancho – Paper Round\n\n23/07/2024 at 07:58\n\nThat has led to speculation that the German side would sell him at the end of the current season to secure a higher transfer fee, with winger Jadon Sancho to then be sold the following year, as they struggle to cope with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on their finances.\n\nSpeaking to Sky in Germany, Kehl said: \"Our position and the contractual situation are clear: We are planning with Erling, we need him to achieve our goals. We have made that clear.\"\n\nThere is a chance that Kehl is merely stating that the club are not willing to sell as part of a plan to maximise the fee they can extract from any deal that will be done, but they did stick to their word when United were linked to Sancho last summer.\n\nOne potential complication could be that Dortmund finish outside the Champions League places, meaning Haaland has to be sacrificed to raise funds, and that could be exacerbated if Germany continues to struggle with the coronavirus pandemic which may further hamper ticket sales for Bundesliga clubs.\n\nBarcelona line-up Serie A duo as Haaland alternatives - Euro Papers\n\nTransfers\n\nSancho still hopes to leave United on permanent deal this summer - Paper Round\n\n04/06/2024 at 07:38\n\nChampions League\n\nSancho exclusive: 'I always knew' - From cage football to the Champions League final\n\n30/05/2024 at 11:07\n\nChampions League\n\nSancho will only return to Man Utd if Ten Hag leaves - Ferdinand\n\n07/05/2024 at 19:14\n\nJoin 3M+ users on app\n\nDownload\n\nScan me\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement"
