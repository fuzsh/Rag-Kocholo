        "text": "German footballer (born 1988)\n\nMats Julian Hummels (German pronunciation: [ˈmats ˈhʊml̩s]; born 16 December 1988) is a German professional footballer who plays as a centre-back.\n\nHe came through the Bayern Munich youth academy before joining Borussia Dortmund on loan in January 2008 and officially signing for Dortmund in February 2009 for €4 million. He rejoined Bayern in 2016 for an undisclosed fee and was sold back to Dortmund three years later, having won the Bundesliga in all his seasons in Munich. He has made over 500 total appearances for Dortmund, winning the Bundesliga twice and finishing runner-up in the UEFA Champions League in 2013 and 2024.\n\nHummels was part of the Germany national team since 2010, earning over 70 caps to date and representing Germany at the 2014 and 2018 FIFA World Cups, and at UEFA Euro 2012, 2016 and 2020.\n\nClub career\n\n[edit]\n\nBayern Munich: Youth, and 2006–2008\n\n[edit]\n\nHummels is a product of Bayern Munich's youth academy, first entering the club as a six-year-old. He signed his first professional contract on 19 December 2006, until 2010. On 19 May 2007, in the season's final match, he played his first Bundesliga match with the first team in a 5–2 home routing of 1. FSV Mainz 05. He also played for the reserve team.[4] He played in one match during the 2005–06 season,[5] 31 matches during the 2006–07 season,[4] and 10 matches during the 2007–08 season.[4]\n\nBorussia Dortmund: 2008–2016\n\n[edit]\n\nIn January 2008, Hummels joined Borussia Dortmund, initially on loan. He finished the 2007–08 season with 16 matches played.[4] During his first full season, he quickly established himself as first-choice, as he often partnered newly signed Neven Subotić, but also missed a great part of its final months due to injury. In February 2009, he was fully signed to the club[6] for a fee of €4 million.[7] He finished the 2008–09 season with a goal in 14 matches played.[8] During the following season, Hummels scored five goals in 33 matches played.[9]\n\nThe 2010–11 season brought increased success for Hummels. He was the regular first-choice centre-back, again paired with Subotić. The duo helped Dortmund to the best defensive record in the Bundesliga, as the team won the league title. Hummels' performances that season displayed great quality in tackling, positioning, passing and composure.[10] He attracted praise from pundits and coaches alike, and he was considered one of the best defenders in the Bundesliga, and in Europe. Hummels finished the 2010–11 season with six goals in 42 matches played.[11]\n\nHummels won the Bundesliga for a second time in 2011–12 as Dortmund set a Bundesliga record with the most points in a Bundesliga season with 81 points. Hummels scored a goal in Dortmund's 5–2 win against Bayern in the 2012 DFB-Pokal Final as the team completed the league and cup double. On 3 June 2012, Hummels signed a new contract that will keep him at Dortmund until the summer of 2017.[12]\n\nOn 25 May 2013, Hummels was in the Borussia Dortmund line-up that was defeated 2–1 by Bayern Munich at Wembley Stadium, London, in the 2013 UEFA Champions League Final.[13]\n\nOn 27 July 2013, Hummels was in the Borussia Dortmund line-up that won 4–2 against Bayern Munich at BVB's Signal Iduna Park, Dortmund, in the 2013 DFL-Supercup.[14]\n\nHummels finished his Borussia Dortmund career with two goals in 32 matches played in the 2014–15 season[15] and three goals in 50 matches played during the 2015–16 season.[16]\n\nHe played for Dortmund in the 2016 DFB-Pokal final against Bayern Munich shortly after having confirmed that he would join Bayern for the following season. After the game, which Dortmund lost on penalties, coach Thomas Tuchel publicly criticised the player. Hummels had asked to be substituted during the game, due to a torn calf muscle.[17]\n\nReturn to Bayern Munich\n\n[edit]\n\n2016–17 season\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 10 May 2016, it was confirmed that Hummels would re-join Bayern Munich from 1 July, signing a five-year contract.[18] The fee was undisclosed, with the BBC citing reports that it was £30 million.[19] He made his 2016 debut for Bayern on 14 August in the German Super Cup against his old team Dortmund and winning 2–0.[20] On 20 August, Hummels scored his first goal for the club in a 5–0 victory over Carl Zeiss Jena during the DFB-Pokal match.[21] On 26 November, Hummels scored his first league goal for the club in a 2–1 win over Bayer Leverkusen.[22] On 24 September, Hummels suffered knee injury in his right knee just before half time and was subbed off in a 1–0 victory over Hamburger SV.[23] He made his comeback as a substitute in the second half in a 1–0 defeat to Atlético Madrid on 29 September.[24][25]\n\nOn 9 April 2017, Hummels missed the Champions League quarter-final first leg against Real Madrid after sustaining an ankle injury in training.[26] He did not fully recover from the injury and had to play the second leg against Real Madrid as defender Javi Martínez was shown a red card in the first leg and there was no more backup player in centre-back position; the match ended 4–2 defeat for his side as they got knocked out from the competition.[27][28] On 26 April, Hummels scored a goal against his former club Borussia Dortmund in a 2–3 loss in the DFB-Pokal semi-final.[29] He finished the 2016–17 season with three goals and two assists in his forty-one matches.[30] Hummels finished the 2016–17 season with three goals in 42 matches played.[20][31]\n\nDuring this time, Hummels was a part of a collaboration between the German Football Association and The LEGO Group, who in May 2016 released a Europe-exclusive collectible minifigure series, with Hummels featured as the fourth of sixteen minifigures in the collection.[32]\n\n2017–18 season\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 5 August 2017, Hummels started the season in fashion by defeating Borussia Dortmund to win the DFL-Supercup in the penalty-shootout as the match ended 2–2 after extra time.[33] He scored his first goal of the season in a 5–0 victory over Chemnitzer FC in the DFB-Pokal on 12 August.[34] On 1 October, Hummels scored a goal in a 2–2 draw over Hertha BSC.[35] On 18 October, he scored his first Champions League goal for the club in a 3–0 victory over Celtic.[36] Hummels sustained an adductor injury at Bayern's training camp in Doha during the winter break which forced him to miss the league match against Bayer Leverkusen.[37] On 2 February, Hummels played his first match of the year after recovering from the injury in a 2–0 victory over Mainz 05.[38] On 31 March, he made his 50th league appearance for Bayern Munich in a 6–0 victory over Borussia Dortmund.[39] On 28 April, Hummels captained his side for the first time in a 4–1 victory over Eintracht Frankfurt.[40] He finished the season with scoring three goals and provided one assist in his forty appearances.[41] Hummels finished the 2017–18 season with three goals in 41 matches played.[33][42]\n\n2018–19 season\n\n[edit]\n\nHummels started the 2018–19 season by starting in the German Super Cup, which Bayern won 5–0.[43]\n\nHummels had a difficult spell midway through the season as he lost his starting place for several matches. Hummels was criticized for his comments after the 3–2 loss against Dortmund on 10 November 2018. Hummels blamed his poor performance on him being sick. Hummels said he had blurred vision before the match but he still decided to play the match. Hummels had to be substituted in the second half because of his poor performance.[44]\n\nOn 18 May 2019, Hummels won his fifth Bundesliga title as Bayern finished two points above Dortmund with 78 points. A week later, Hummels won his second DFB-Pokal as Bayern defeated RB Leipzig 3–0 in the 2019 DFB-Pokal Final.[45]\n\nHummels finished the 2018–19 season with two goals in 33 matches played.[citation needed]\n\nReturn to Dortmund\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 19 June 2019, Bayern Munich came to an agreement with Borussia Dortmund that would see the 30-year-old Hummels rejoin his former club.[46] He clinched his first title following his return by achieving the 2020–21 DFB-Pokal after a 4–1 win over RB Leipzig in the final.[47] On 19 February 2023, he featured in his 454th match in a 4–1 win over Hertha BSC, becoming the second player with most appearances at the club ahead of Roman Weidenfeller, with only Michael Zorc with 572 games ahead of him.[48] Later that year, on 24 May, he extended his contract with the club until 2024.[49]\n\nOn 10 April 2024, Hummels played his 500th match for Borussia Dortmund in all competitions against Atlético Madrid during the Champions League quarter-finals.[50] A month later, on 7 May, he scored the only goal from a header in a 1–0 away victory over Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League semi-final second leg, becoming the oldest German player, aged 35 years and 143 days, to score in the knockout stages of the competition, and securing his club's qualification to the final for the third time in their history.[51] Hummels was given the man of the match award in both games against PSG.[52] Afterwards, his club lost 2–0 against Real Madrid in the final.[53] However, he became the second player to produce more than 50 tackles in a single campaign, following Lúcio in 2009–10.[54] He was eventually named in the Team of the Season in that competition.[55] A few weeks later, on 14 June, his departure from the club was announced.[56]\n\nInternational career\n\n[edit]\n\nHummels was called by the German under-21 national team for the 2009 UEFA European Under-21 Championship; after getting only minimal playing time during the initial four matches, he started in the final, a 4–0 win against England.[citation needed]\n\nHe made his senior team debut in a friendly against Malta on 13 May 2010 in Aachen. He came on as a 46th-minute substitute for Serdar Tasci, taking part in a 3–0 win at New Tivoli.[57] On 26 May 2012, he scored his first international goal when he headed a free kick from Mesut Özil, albeit in a 5–3 friendly loss away to Switzerland at St. Jakob-Park.[58]\n\nHummels was in the starting line-up for Germany's opening UEFA Euro 2012 match against Portugal and helped them to a 1–0 victory. Hummels went on to play all 450 minutes in Germany's Euro campaign, along with teammates Philipp Lahm, Sami Khedira, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Holger Badstuber, and Manuel Neuer.\n\nHummels scored the second goal in Germany's 4–0 win over Portugal in their first game of the 2014 FIFA World Cup on 16 June, heading a corner from Toni Kroos.[59] After missing the team's round of 16 match due to illness, Hummels returned to the team for the quarter-final against France, where he scored the winning goal in a 1–0 victory at the Estádio do Maracanã.[60] He was named on the 10-man shortlist for FIFA's Golden Ball award for the tournament's best player.[61]\n\nOn 10 November 2017, Hummels captained Germany for the first time in a 0–0 draw with England at Wembley Stadium.[62]\n\nHummels was named in Germany's final 23-man squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.[63] On 23 June, he missed the second group stage match of the tournament due to a minor injury[64] though his side won the match 2–1 against Sweden.[65] He returned to the side for the final group fixture against South Korea on 27 June, but missed several chances from headers after moving up front during the second half in Germany's unsuccessful attempts to score; ultimately they were defeated 2–0 and eliminated from the tournament.[66]\n\nOn 5 March 2019, national team coach Joachim Löw confirmed that he would plan without Hummels for the foreseeable future, along with his club teammates Jérôme Boateng and Thomas Müller.[67] On 19 May 2021, Hummels, along with Müller, was included in Germany's final 26-man squad for UEFA Euro 2020 under the same manager.[68] In his first match of Euro 2020, Hummels scored an own goal to grant France a 1–0 win, which was Germany's first own goal in the competition, and the first in a major tournament since Berti Vogts' own goal in the 1978 FIFA World Cup.[69]\n\nHummels was not named in the 26-man German squads for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar,[70] nor for UEFA Euro 2024 hosted on home soil.[71]\n\nStyle of play\n\n[edit]\n\nRegarded as one of the best defenders in the world,[72] Hummels is a large, consistent, and physically strong player, known for his powerful tackling and strength in the air, as well as his positional sense, and his ability to read the game and intercept loose balls,[73][74][75] which allows him to compensate for his lack of pace.[76] A technically gifted and tactically versatile centre-back, he is also capable of playing as a sweeper, or even as a defensive midfielder;[72][77][78] his composure, elegance, ball playing ability, and confidence in possession have led him to be compared to compatriot Franz Beckenbauer.[78][79][80] Hummels is capable of playing either in a back–three or a back–four defensive line-up.[81][82] Beyond his qualities as a defender, Hummels has also stood for his leadership, having captained Borussia Dortmund.[75][83] Despite his ability, however, he was struggled with injuries throughout his career.[84]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nHummels was born in Bergisch Gladbach, North Rhine-Westphalia.[85] His father, Hermann Hummels, was a professional footballer and manager. His mother, Ulla Holthoff [de], was a professional water polo player.[86] His father worked as youth coordinator at Bayern Munich until he was replaced by Stephan Beckenbauer, the son of Franz Beckenbauer, on 30 March 2012.[87] His younger brother Jonas retired at age 25 in 2016, through injuries.[88]\n\nHis wife, Cathy Fischer [de], was named as Germany's WAG of the year for 2013.[89] Fischer and Hummels married in June 2015.[90] The couple have a son, born in 2018.[91] Their divorce was finalised in December 2022.[92]\n\nIn August 2017, he joined the Common Goal Project (an initiative of Juan Mata), being the second footballer to donate 1% of his salary to a collective fund that will support football organizations as a tool to generate sustainable social development throughout the world.[93][94][95]\n\nCareer statistics\n\n[edit]\n\nClub\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of match played 1 June 2024\n\nAppearances and goals by club, season and competition Club Season League DFB-Pokal Europe Other Total Division Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Bayern Munich II 2005–06[5] Regionalliga Süd 1 0 — — — 1 0 2006–07[4] Regionalliga Süd 31 2 — — — 31 2 2007–08[4] Regionalliga Süd 10 3 — — — 10 3 Total 42 5 — — — 42 5 Bayern Munich 2006–07[4] Bundesliga 1 0 0 0 0 0 1[a] 0 2 0 Borussia Dortmund (loan) 2007–08[4] Bundesliga 13 0 3 0 — — 16 0 Borussia Dortmund 2008–09[4] Bundesliga 12 1 1 0 1[b] 0 — 14 1 2009–10[9] Bundesliga 30 5 3 0 — — 33 5 2010–11[4] Bundesliga 32 5 2 0 8[b] 1 — 42 6 2011–12[4] Bundesliga 33 1 6 1 6[c] 1 1[d] 0 46 3 2012–13[4] Bundesliga 28 1 2 1 11[c] 1 1[d] 0 42 3 2013–14[4] Bundesliga 23 2 4 0 6[c] 0 1[d] 0 34 2 2014–15[15] Bundesliga 24 2 4 0 4[c] 0 — 32 2 2015–16[16] Bundesliga 30 2 6 0 14[b] 1 — 50 3 Total 225 19 31 2 50 4 3 0 309 25 Bayern Munich 2016–17[20][31] Bundesliga 27 1 5 2 9[c] 0 1[d] 0 42 3 2017–18[33][42] Bundesliga 26 1 5 1 9[c] 1 1[d] 0 41 3 2018–19[43] Bundesliga 21 1 5 0 6[c] 1 1[d] 0 33 2 Total 74 3 15 3 24 2 3 0 116 8 Borussia Dortmund 2019–20[96] Bundesliga 31 1 2 0 8[c] 0 0 0 41 1 2020–21[97] Bundesliga 33 5 5 1 9[c] 0 1[d] 0 48 6 2021–22[98] Bundesliga 23 1 2 0 7[e] 0 0 0 32 1 2022–23[99] Bundesliga 30 1 4 0 4[c] 0 — 38 1 2023–24[100] Bundesliga 25 3 2 0 13[c] 1 — 40 4 Total 142 11 15 1 41 1 1 0 199 13 Career total 484 38 61 6 115 7 8 0 668 51\n\nInternational\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of match played 21 November 2023[101]\n\nAppearances and goals by national team and year National team Year Apps Goals Germany 2010 2 0 2011 10 0 2012 11 1 2013 5 1 2014 10 2 2015 6 0 2016 11 0 2017 7 1 2018 8 0 2019 0 0 2020 0 0 2021 6 0 2022 0 0 2023 2 0 Total 78 5\n\nAs of match played 29 June 2021.
