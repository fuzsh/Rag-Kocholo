        "text": "Full-time: Dortmund 1-2 Zenit (agg 5-4)\n\nAnd we are done. Dortmund go through but they will not be happy with how they did it. They were less than convincing and really missed the creativity of Rues. But even if he is back for the next game, Lewandowski won’t be there as he is suspended. Zenit will be annoyed that they didn’t play that well in the first game as they might have had a pop at going through then. Thanks for all the emails and chat. Bye!\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 22.38 CET\n\n90 mins Three more minutes to go.\n\nShare\n\n89 mins Hubocan has just got Lewandowski’s knee in his head. It was an accident but it sure looked like it hurt. There is blood everywhere. Yuck. Meanwhile, Hofmann is on for Aubameyang.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 22.34 CET\n\n87 mins Witsel has just been given the requisite time and space to force Weidenfeller into a decent save at his right post. Dortmund’s defence has been dodgy all day.\n\nShare\n\n86 mins This game has gone to the dogs now. It is constantly interrupted by bitty fouls and long balls. Neither side are covering themselves in the glory of the beautiful game.\n\nShare\n\n84 mins In goes Smolnikov, out goes Fayzulin.\n\nShare\n\n83 mins “Well,” starts John T, “the Flash would be #1 on my team sheet, for obvious reasons. And I’d put Plastic Man in net, or more accurately stretched across the front of the goal mouth so nobody can score.” Pressure from Rondón has, meanwhile, brought more action out of Papastathopoulos, who was forced to boot the ball out of his box.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 22.45 CET\n\n81 mins Rondón has been a bit of a nuisance since he came on, hasn’t he? Just now he forced Papastathopoulos to put in a (possible) goal saving challenge on the edge of the area. Imagine if he had scored that. IMAGINE!\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 22.24 CET\n\n79 mins “Surely” says Daniel Schulwolf, “\n\nDr. Manhattan’s ability to generally change the laws of physics and gravity would make him useful anywhere on the pitch. I’m doubt he could be stopped by anybody – footballer or superhero.”\n\nShare\n\n77 mins While I was typing all that, Jojic picked up a yellow for a silly foul on Witsel, who, by the way, has been great tonight. Also, Grosskreutz went off – possibly injured – to be replaced by Durm.\n\nShare\n\nThey just might but they will need a few more of these and quick. This was an odd one. Zenit kind of ambled up the pitch like they were out for a Sunday stroll in a nice park, licking ice-cream, holding hands and drinking pop. They spread the ball out to the left, on the edge of the area, where Criscito picked it up. He curled the ball into the zone of danger, where Hummels was dozing, and Rondón nipped in behind him and did a lovely little diving header past Weidenfeller.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 22.44 CET\n\nGOAL! Dortmund 1-2 Zenit (Rondón)\n\n73 mins They couldn’t, could they?\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 22.22 CET\n\n71 mins Corner to Dortmund on the right. In it goes, Malafeev flaps at it but lucky or him, his defenders are there to do one to the danger.\n\nShare\n\n69 mins “Of course,” says Simon McMahon, “the perfect football superhero may have been under our noses all along - Hot-Shot Hamish. Not forgetting Mighty Mouse.” Not sure what Mighty Mouse would bring to the game.\n\nShare\n\n68 mins Off goes Mkhitaryan and on comes Jojic.\n\nShare\n\n67 mins Speaking of Lewandowski, he has just been chopped down outside the box by Neto – there was more than a hint of drama to his fall. Aubameyang fires the free-kick right into the wall.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 22.43 CET\n\n64 mins Oh what a joy Lewandowski is to watch. The ball is sent in high, he rises and heads it and then takes the ball under complete control with the most beautiful of touches. He then tries to do the most delicate back-heel into the path of Mkhitaryan (I think) but Zenit spoil the party and clear the ball.\n\nShare\n\n63 mins Kerzhakov is done for the day. Rondón replaces him.\n\nShare\n\n62 mins “Hi Ian,” cheers Robin Hazlehurst. “My Dad just got me to write a comic about a superhero called BrianO, who is pretty handy on a football field (of sorts). More traditional characters might struggle though - Batman and Spiderman do too much hand-based stuff, though would probably win a lot of penalties with all the rolling around. Green Lantern and Green Arrow rely too much on outside objects, like, y’know, a bow and arrows. Superman flies, that’s got to be cheating. The Atom can shrink very small and would be tricky to tackle but might just get squashed, so I’m thinking The Flash would be favourite - moves very fast, mostly foot-based, able to run through solid objects like defenders. I’d say he’s your man. (I may have given this too much thought).”\n\nShare\n\n59 mins Dortmund pass from side to side before Schmelzer gets bored and tries to dash down the right like he is on Supermarket Sweep. He is shepherded out for a throw and from that Aubameyang picks the ball up outside the box from a Sahin pass. He boots it over the bar as if he were playing Gaelic football and his side wanted just a point to keep the scoreboard ticking over.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 22.43 CET\n\n57 mins “Invisible Man to ghost in at the back post,” quips Leo Bergin.\n\nShare\n\n55 mins Kehl eats pulls Hulk’s shorts and then pulls the striker down, stopping his forward momentum. He gets a yellow card, the third of the game.\n\nShare\n\n54 mins Zenit continues to attack. Criscito, venturing forward, wins a throw deep in enemy territory on the left. That leads to the ball being rolled to Fayzulin\n\non the edge of the area. His shot goes wide of\n\nWeidenfeller\n\n’s right\n\npost\n\n.\n\nShare\n\n52 mins #MoyesIn.\n\nShare\n\n51 mins Meanwhile, Hulk has tried to put a free-kick in from a full 40 yards out. He misses by this much.\n\nShare\n\n50 mins Zenit started the first half in a positive manner and have done the same with the second. Witsel breaks down the right and puts a dangerous ball across the box. Luckily for Dortmund, there is no one in a Zenit shirt near enough to the ball to do anything with it.\n\nShare\n\n49 mins More superhero chat. This time from Chris Sweeney: “The Hulk is going to be good in the air, quick and would hold the ball up well, but he’s always going to be one silly challenge away from a red card. Plus, if you do get him to calm down, he turns back into Bruce Banner. Never seen Bruce Banner play but I’d have Wolverine on the bench just in case. Other than that, I’d have Spiderman in goal, Superman in midfield with Captain America and Batman at right back. Not thought about the rest of the side.”\n\nShare\n\n47 mins Dortmund stroke the ball around the Zenit half. It is launched long to Aubameyang on the right and Zenit concede a throw. Dortmund get back to stroking.\n\nShare\n\n45 mins And we are back. There is one change to tell you about – Luís Neto is on for Lombaerts – and there is one email to tell you about. It’s from Simon McMahon: “I’d like to have Underdog in my team. If only for the pre and post-match interviews which would be conducted entirely in rhyme. ‘We will play without fear, because Underdog is here.’ ‘Lewandowski got a yellow, he really needs to mellow’. You get the idea.” Who in the Hell is Underdog?\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 22.42 CET\n\nHalf-time: Dortmund 1-1 Zenit\n\nSee, told you it would be fun. Back in a few.\n\nShare\n\n45 mins There is just one more minute to play.\n\nShare\n\n42 mins Miles outside his box on the Dortmund left, Malafeev has absolutely clattered Lewandowski. It was silly to be out that far given he had a defender covering and the potential consequences. But he gets away with it – the Dortmund fans do not like that. Lewandowski looks hurt but is soon back up and A OK.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 21.43 CET\n\nWell that was nice while it lasted. Dortmund had enough time and space to work the ball down the left. It was threaded through to Schmelzer who hung a cross into the box. Arriving late like a bus was Kehl. He leaped above Criscito and bashed a header towards Malafeev. The keeper gets two hands to it but cannot keep it out.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 21.46 CET\n\nGOAL! Dortmund 1-1 Zenit (Kehl)\n\n39 mins Game off again.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 21.41 CET\n\n37 mins Dortmund continually look weak down their right hand side. Aubameyang is not really tracking back and Piszczek is being exposed. Just now Shatov got into a one-on-one with him with the Zenit man coming out on top with ease. Shatov then flashed a dangerous shot across the goal.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 21.42 CET\n\n35 mins Zachary S. Taylor has been in touch. “Were he a footballer, the Hulk’s goal celebration would get him booked every time. Nor would he be popular with the kit man.” Bingo. So anyone got any suggestion for which superhero could make it as a professional footballer?\n\nShare\n\n32 mins A free-kick to Dortmund on the edge of the area as Lewandowski is too quick for Danny. It is just to the right of the D. Sahin steps up, wipes some sweat from his brow ... and hits the ball right into the wall. Kloop looks furious on the sideline. He is blowing up like a Jeff Koons balloon.\n\nShare\n\n30 mins They have been the better side too. Dortmund finding it hard to break them down as Zenit, like Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday, are sitting deep and playing two men in front of the back four.\n\nShare\n\n28 mins Danny gets the ball wide on the right and moves it inside. A one-two here, a one-two there and he is almost through on the Dortmund goal only to be let down by the final pass which is just a touch overcooked.\n\nShare\n\n26 mins Someone else has scored a goal tonight. Want to know who? Well click here to find out.\n\nShare\n\n25 mins Corner for Dortmund. It is sent deep to the back post. Under much pressure, Malafeev palms it away to safety.\n\nShare\n\n23 mins Lombaerts introduces his forearm to Aubameyang’s throat and gets a yellow card for his troubles. Zenit get a free-kick near the corner of the box on the right. Sahin curls it over everyone and out for a goalkick.\n\nShare\n\n21 mins Just saw a quick replay of the goal, it had a touch of swerve on the end that clearly confused Weidenfeller. Down the Zenit end, Malafeev has just pulled off a spectacular sprawling effort from a Grosskreutz curler. The resulting corner comes to nothing.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 21.40 CET\n\n18 mins Hate to say I told you so but ... Lewandowski has just been booked for a handball in the Zenit box. If they make the last eight, he won’t be able to play in the first leg.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 21.05 CET\n\nOh wow! What a effin and jeffin goal this is. Zenit had looked confident from the off but they can only have dreamed of such a start. Hulk got the ball, wide on the right with his back to goal. He is miles out but that does not deter him. He turns the attending Dortmund defenders, (note the plural), brushing them aside and races towards the goal. He then absolutely smashes the ball past Weidenfeller from about 25 yards out with one of the most sensational strikes you will see this season.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 21.39 CET\n\nGOAL! Dortmund 0-1 Zenit (Hulk)\n\n16 mins GAME! VERY! MUCH! ON!\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 21.05 CET\n\n13 mins Why start Lewandowski then\n\n?\n\nShare\n\n11 mins Aubameyang gets the ball wide on the right. He sprints his way past a few Zenit defenders and squares the ball into the box. Zenit snuff it out. However, after that, the away side dally on the ball and Dortmund win it back just outside the box. Some neat plays sees the ball cut inside to Lewandowski (by Sahin) who is given time and space to turn and shoot. Malafeev saves his effort easily enough.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 21.40 CET\n\n9 mins Corner to Dortmund. A commanding header from Lombaerts – I think – clears the danger.\n\nShare\n\n7 mins Meanwhile, down the other end, Zenit have shown that they have not come here to lie down and be walked all over. The ball is cut back to Witsel on the edge of the area. He forces Weidenfeller into his first save of the game.\n\nShare\n\n5 mins Dortmund win a free-kick on the half-way line. They play the ball along their back-line and creep their way forward. Zenit force them into giving the ball away and attack down the right. Dortmund push them back and soon get the ball back. Hummels saunters out of defence and plays a ball out to the left to Schmelzer via Grosskreutz. That is soon swung into the box and it reaches the head of Aubameyang. He has acres of time and space but some how contrives to miss when scoring seemed the only option.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 21.37 CET\n\n3 mins Zenit pass and pass and pass but go nowhere. Dortmund regain possession. Then kick it right back out of play. A few moves later, Zenit do the exact same thing. Cracking start this.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 21.37 CET\n\n1 min Off we go then. Dortmund play left to right in their yellow and black number. Zenit wear a chewing-gum blue.\n\nShare\n\nCan you taste that atmosphere?\n\nShare\n\nThe players are on the pitch. The fans are waving their flags. And we are ready to go! go! go! Over in the studio, Alan McInally is talking about “the Hulk”. Tell you what, that would be one way to improve modern football – more superheroes in teams. (Is Hulk a superhero? And who would you want in your side? Come on! Riff with a brother here.)\n\nShare\n\nSome quotes from the respective managers to send you to sleep get you fired up for the game. First up Sergei Semak of Zenit:\n\nThe situation is not easy for me. The result only interests me if it is good enough for a win and to see us through. It is much more important for us to present ourselves in the best possible light, that the team sticks together and we are not feeling sorry for anything afterwards. Only then will we have a chance to turn this [situation] around.\n\nAnd here is Klopp:\n\nWe put ourselves in a good position for the return leg [with our display in St Petersburg] – nothing more, nothing less. We will not risk a lot, but just going out to defend our lead would be a bit stupid as well, so we will make it a normal game ... Borussia Dortmund don’t just play for a result, Borussia Dortmund means an experience.\n\nShare\n\nHi! Helllloooooooooo! I s it me you’re looking for? There must be someone out there. Anyone? China?\n\nShare\n\nA song for Zenit\n\nShare\n\nTeam news!\n\nThere is but a solitary change to the Dortmund side that lost at the weekend, with Henrikh Mkhitaryan starting ahead of Jonas Hofman. That, of course, means there is no Reus, which is shame given how enjoyable a player he is to watch – although word on the German streets is that Joachim Löw has not being enjoying his recent displays so much and has told him to up his game before the World Cup or else he’ll be watching it from the comfort of his arse, rather than the comfort of the bench. As for Zenit, there is no Andrei Arshavin, which pretty much means they are at full strength. Those teams in full, as well as a pointless mention of who the referee is, are as follows:\n\nDortmund: Weidenfeller, Hummels, Papastathopoulos, Piszczek, Schmelzer, Kehl, Nuri Şahin, Grosskreutz, Lewandowski, Mkhitaryan, Aubameyang. Subs:Langerak, Friedrich, Kirch, Durm, Hofmann, Jojic, Schieber.\n\nZenit: Malafeev, Criscito, Lombaerts, Hubočan, Anyukov, Shatov, Fayzulin, Witsel, Hulk, Danny, Kerzhakov. Subs: Lodygin, Luís Neto, Smolnikov, Luković, Zyryanov, Tymoshchuk, Rondón.\n\nReferee: Alberto Undiano Mallenco\n\nShare\n\nElvis. Manchester United’s hopes of winning a trophy this season.

A media who isn’t biased against those clubs. 2Pac. Lord Lucan. The Loch Ness Monster. Finding a Nessie in the zoo. All of these are more alive, or more realistic, than Zenit St Petersburg’s hopes of progressing to the next round of the Champions Leagues.\n\nFor those of you in the back or those of who had something better to do two weeks ago, let’s have a quick recap of how the first game in this tie went down. It can be summed up in two words: five minutes. Five minutes was all it took for Borussia Dortmund to twice penetrate the Zenit defence and leaving them with face’s redder than a baboon’s back side. Marco Reus set up for the first one for Henrikh Mkhitaryan and it was Reus who scored the second. Oleg Shatov pulled one back for the home side only Robert Lewandowski to score either side of a Hulk penalty.\n\nZenith, who had not played since early December, looked understandably rusty and could not cope with the pace and intensity of the Dortmund counterattacking machine. They were lucky enough to get those two goals – the move for the first one looked to contain an offside player and the penalty was soft – ‘twas more a case of Viktor Fayzulin running into Lukasz Piszczek than the other way around. They were also let down badly by their back-four, whose ineptitude was easy for all to see. In fact, they were badly let down by everybody except Hulk, the only Zenit player to come out of the performance with a bit of credibility. Not to take anything away from Dortmund. They were on top of their game for most of the match and Reus and Lewandowski were magnificent as they continually carved the Russians apart. “We were incredibly active and aggressive” purred Jürgen Klopp afterwards. “It’s not easy to do that. The team put in a fantastic performance.”\n\nSince then, there has been a change or two around Zenit. Luciano Spalletti, for one, was given the chop, in the wake of the Dortmund defeat. “If the coach is fired, the players should take a look at themselves,” said Nicolas Lombaerts staring at his shoes, in an unusually reflective mood for a footballer. “In the end, if he was fired, then we’re one of the main causes.” Those less than cordial relations with the big names in his side will have been another. The form of the side will have been another. Despite two league titles in the last three seasons, they had only one victory from their last 11 competitive games. He was temporarily replaced by reserve coach Sergey Semak, before being permanently replaced by André Villas-Boas (though AVB’s eight months in charge will not kick in till after this evening’s match). They have brushed some of that dirt and rust of their shoulders by playing a few games in the Russian League but a goalless home draw with lowly Tom Tomsk and a 1-0 defeat to CSKA Moscow suggest not much has changed for the better.\n\nThe Schwarzgelben, by contrast, have won seven of their last nine matches in all competitions and two of those victories have come in games since the match in Russia, as they beat Nuremberg 3-0 at home and Freiburg 1-0 away. Somehow, though, they managed to lose to Borussia Mönchengladbach at the weekend. In their defence, they were without Reus (injured) and Henrikh\n\nMkhitaryan (suspended\n\n)\n\n; Aubameyang hit the bar; Raffael’s goal was as scruffy as it was lucky; and Ducksch’s late equaliser should have stood – keepers get far too much protection, don’t you think? Klopp won’t be too worried by those goings-on fore the title race is over.\n\nAs Raphael Honigstein pointed out in his column this week\n\n, Bayern’s Bundesliga “lead is now 23 points. Next week, the title race (haha, “title race”, hahaha) could be over, at last, if Bayern beat Mainz and neither Schalke nor Dortmund win their games.” So all Klopp will care about is this match and this competition.\n\nThis tie is most definitely Dortmund’s to lose. If, however, Zenit can frustrate them, in the same way that Mönchengladbach did at the weekend – by denying their hosts time and space on the ball as well as a defence that played very deep and with plenty of discipline, not to mention two holding midfielders in front of it – and maybe snatch an early goal, then there could be hope that a competitive game of football may just break out in the Westfalenstadion. (“We can’t afford to play [against Zenith] like we did against Gladbach,” moaned Lewandowski after the weekend’s defeat.) However, should Dortmund contain their opposition – and there is no need for them to take any risks with those four away goals tucked safely under their arms – hit them on the break and score early, then expect more of the same from the first leg. Either way, it should be fun! fun! fun! Teams news is on its merry way. Oh. La de da!\n\nShare"
