"Sebastian reminds me of the young Matthaus," says his Borussia Dortmund team-mate Jurgen Kohler, who played alongside the great man in the national team.

"He is very confident in his own ability, and always at his best when the pressure is on, and those are the characteristics which make the difference between good and very good players.

"Sebastian's main strength is his enormous self-confidence. It comes naturally to him, and the other players respect it because he backs it up with his performances on the pitch."

What is self-confidence to admirers, though, is arrogance to detractors, and Kehl has plenty of them, largely because of his single-minded determination to get to the top.

At the end of 2001, while still with Freiburg, the 22-year-old caused an uproar when he broke a pre-contract agreement with Bayern Munich to join Borussia Dortmund, where he was guaranteed the first team football that Jeremies might have denied him in Munich.

The news that he had already agreed to leave infuriated Freiburg fans, his decision to spurn Bayern made him a hate-figure in Munich, and only a public apology ended the threat of legal action from the European champions.

Yet for all the unpleasantness, Kehl has had little trouble settling in at the Westfalenstadion.

"Although he only joined us a short time ago, he has started to take control on the pitch and command the other players," said Dortmund skipper Stefan Reuter.

And that willingness to take responsibility and direct affairs is precisely what Germany have been lacking for years.

"He behaves like someone well beyond his age, like a player who has seen and won it all," said national coach Rudi Voller after the 7-1 victory over Israel in February.

He behaves, in other words, just like Matthaus.
