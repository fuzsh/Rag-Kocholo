        "text": "GEORGIA XANTHAKI-KARAMANOU, Professor of Ancient Greek Philology at the School of Philosophy, Faculty of Philology of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. Hellas The presentation on the “Moral and social values from Ancient Greek Tragedy” deals globally with the history of human and social values from Homer and Hesiod to the end of the fifth century. Special emphasis is given on the moral and social concepts expressed in some fundamental texts of the three major tragic poets (Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides). In archaic Greece, an individual is praised for his presence in war and in public life. Prudence and moderation are prerequisites of aretē. The conflict of violence and persuasion was constant in Greek thought. In the works of Sophocles, the heroic status is confronted with man’s vulnerability to time. Euripides, “the most tragic of the poets” according to Aristotle, depicted the cruelty and the violence of war. The sophists had rejected the distinctions in society. Moral virtues and not wealth or noble origin determine human personality. Consequently, it was of the utmost importance that the citizens should esteem justice in their relationships with each other. The paper is particularly focused on the significant discrimination between the com-petitive values, such as wealth and noble origin, and the cooperative ones, expressed in the concepts of justice, wisdom, temperance, modesty, and nobility of character, as well as the respect for the law and the human and political rights, which shaped the development of de-mocracy.\n\nThis article tries less to give a practical demonstration than to theoretically sketch out and propose a novel approach to a specific aspect of ancient Greek culture, namely τιμή (honor) and the pursuit of it. Its aim is not only to illustrate the potential proficiency of such a methodology (and to set the ground for its application), but also to highlight concrete opportunities in the Humanities to study how the language of civic institutions in epigraphic sources and the moral language of ethical philosophy penetrate poetry in Greece: the idea that inscriptions and ethical philosophy are something that scholars of poetry should leave to ancient historians and philosophers has left lots of room for new scholarship in this area. Special attention is devoted here to Euripidean drama and its characters who, in exhibiting specific virtues (e.g. benevolence, solidarity, and friendship) while establishing reciprocal relationships, stand as socio-ethical examples of the pursuit of an honorable status within one's community. Scholars have not fully explored to what extent this portrayal matches historical evidence for benefactions/exchanges between Greek citizens/cities and, at the same time, it complies with the virtues described by Aristotle's ethical works. By interpreting honor as a means by which people regulate their social lives, the objective of this article is to show how Euripidean drama can serve as a valuable source to be explored for understanding Greek moral attitudes.\n\nThis article attempts to trace the origins of philolaconism among Athenian elites in democratic Athens. It argues that fondness for Sparta among Athenian elites was not founded on a desire for constitutional change to the Spartan political model, and, indeed, that philolaconists were not seen as threats to the democratic order per se. Philolaconism was rooted instead in the Athenian aristocracy's need for an identity in the face of a changing Athens. Indeed, the fondness for Sparta became part of the social strategy through which the elite and wealthy members of Athenian society sought to reassert their threatened identity by adopting Spartan ways, and admiring Spartan values, in order to distinguish themselves from democratic culture. Thus, the cause of Athenian philolaconism was predominantly social not political; and as a social phenomenon it was not primarily based on the content of Spartan culture, but rather on the usefulness of Spartan otherness for the purpose of distinguishing Athenian elites from Athenian commoners. Few can be indifferent to the enduring power of the myth of Sparta bequeathed to history by its unique constitution. Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Charles Montesquieu and, indeed, many modern writers on ancient history have been among those who have lauded the Spartan system of government, due partly to the myths it engendered, but also to the obscuring effects of Ivan Jordović 'The Origins of Philolaconism' C&M 65 (2015), 127-154."
