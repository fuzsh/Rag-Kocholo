Mrs Antonia Nevill has, as always, provided a fluent and readable translation. Professor Brian Sparkes gave advice on technical matters, adapted the Bibliography and guide to further reading for English-speaking readers, and ensured the accuracy of, and in many cases provided new, translations of ancient Greek sources. Professor Pierre Brule, having in the first place written such an excellent French text, then devoted much time to helping in the preparation of the English version. He also chose and wrote the captions for its illustrations for which Mrs Karen Morgan then obtained copies from museums in Greece, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. Our thanks go to all these, and also to the museums and their curators for having provided prints for the illustrations and allowed their reproduction.\n\nNow I am nothing on my own. But I have often observed the nature of women in this way, that we are nothing. When we are young, the life we live in our father's home is the sweetest, I think; for folly always raises children in happiness. But when we come of age and have understanding, we are pushed outside and sold, far from our household gods and from our parents, some to foreign husbands, some to barbarians, some to homes with no joy, others to ones full of abuse. And this, when a single night has joined us, we must commend and consider to be happiness.

The State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg\n\nPROLOGUE\n\nWhich paths will lead us to them?\n\nW\n\nhen setting out to meet Greek women we need to adjust our sights to the memory of a period, and to consider two preliminary questions: where are they spoken about and who is speaking about them? To be born a woman vastly diminishes the likelihood of an individual leaving any traces in history; and the handicap is cumulative, so much so that if the problems of poverty, political exclusion and inferior status are added, women are likely to be consigned to oblivion. This is true everywhere and at all times, even quite recently, but there were many in ancient Greece who suffered from two handicaps: they were- being women and slaves, women and foreigners, women and excluded from the social system. Only chance, therefore, can explain such traces of them that have survived: their contemporaries had no interest in them. One of the few irrefutable facts is this: there must be thousands, millions, of shadowy figures behind a few faintly illuminated foregrounds. As a historian, I can only adhere to the principle of the reality of the sources of information; because it is impossible to do otherwise, this book will generally deal with those whose feminine gender is their one and only hindrance, women who are socially favoured, who form a tiny proportion of the whole gender. As for the question of who is speaking about these women, the answer is simple: it is Greek men who speak. On the one hand, we have fragments of the lines of Sappho, and on the other an entire library written by men. I might as well say it once and for all: nearly everything about women comes from men, and nearly everything returns to men, for one cannot see how they could not profit from their dominance. It is a well-known and well-defined trap, always under my feet: when these men speak of women they are speaking above all of themselves; therefore so do I. My search for Greek women is thus presented with a challenge: to disengage them from this masculine screen that falls between them and my gaze and to catch a\n\n2\n\nWomen of Ancient Greece\n\nglimpse of that 'everyday world' of theirs, tucked away in the heart of the discourse of a culture which took so little notice of them. But since only the words of men are audible, there is no other way than to listen to them carefully. And although it would be an illusion to think we had gained access this way to women's intimate thoughts, or even their view of the world, let us at least try to get some idea of the life men made them lead. Women will not be alone on stage, however, as our enquiry into the feminine obviously teaches us in return a great deal about men, about the 'association' of the sexes (as one of the characters in this book says), about the societies in which they lived, and the culture in which they were steeped. It would surely be impossible to write a book that simultaneously reconstructed the everyday life of Greek women and their history. Not that I doubt the legitimacy of the search for the 'everyday': the habitual is life in its greatest density; it is what makes it bearable. Nor am I complaining of the paucity of the sources, but how are the two opposites of history and the repetitive daily fabric of life to be united? In the matter of the 'daily round', how is one to answer the legitimate, innocent and 'unheard of' request to give an account of one of their days? Which woman would we write about, and when? Of course, there are texts and images (though skimpy and rare); and if one started from those, one could attempt to say, for example, what they did with their hands; but such a reconstruction offers only a utopian day, which is never revealed anywhere. The everyday kills history, whereas history swamps the everyday. And how is one to reply - if possible, at the same time- to that other request to recount how and whither this human maelstrom slipped away, composed as it was of their thousands of days, filled with words, gestures, thoughts; a gradual evolution that could have been called history, if we had preserved more than an ounce of it? Despite being a daily occurrence, the 'everyday' changes, but how can we pinpoint its movement? It would be far easier with men. We know about the development of their ways of building and fighting, their political, philosophical and religious ideas, even their dreams; but their total lack of interest in the actions of their female contemporaries - cooking, washing, spinning, weaving, pregnancy, childbirth, caring for children, to say nothing of their feelings and emotions - deprives us of that history. History gets its own back on the everyday by concealing it. Greek women were in the shade, and stayed there. Bad luck should not be blamed for this 'cover-up'; the absence of a historical 'Greek woman' is explained by the life that their society made them lead, a life whose main characteristic was their inferior status to men. Faced with these two models, at such depressing extremes, the choice must be made: the fixed image, based on a kaleidoscopic accumulation of\n\nPrologue: Which paths will lead us to them?\n\n3\n\nthe objects of 'everyday life' - spindles, distaffs, grindstones and so on gleaned here and there, mixing facts from the day before yesterday and the day after tomorrow to paint the richest picture possible; or the film, with only a few continuous sequences and with many blanks which are the black holes in our documentation. Of the two solutions, I plump for history: history as the route and the means of visualizing a world. Greek women in everyday life, like your sisters in other times, lands and cultures - you are absent, anonymous and silent. What a paradox. For how active and full of sound are those other women who inhabit the 'ideological palaces' of masculine discourse. When it comes to those fictional heroines, whose names are known even outside specialist circles, everything is turned upside down, and what a great deal is said about them. How much more numerous (and endlessly reworked by playwrights, musicians and philosophers) in the whole of Greek, and then western, culture are Ariadne, Iphigenia, Phaedra, Helen, Nausicaa, Andromache, Electra, Antigone and Penelope than the rare Odysseus and Agamemnon. The long and brilliant line of Greek heroines illustrates the incomparable richness of their sex, fixed in accounts which impressed their readers so greatly that for a long time they defined the archetypes on which succeeding imaginations were able to build or reconstruct. A paradox lies in the enduring quality of these feminine models: their dazzling images were born in a culture where masculine domination stifled women's voices to an extent rarely found elsewhere. 1 Was it because of the discreet silence of one group that the voice of the others rang so loudly? Their fame did not prevent their sisters in everyday life from being placed totally beyond the concern of historians - thus doubly mute and anonymous and having to wait until the second half of the twentieth century to slip into their field of vision? They are at opposite poles: the unknown women, concealed 'in the depths of their obscure homes' and absorbed in their habitual tasks, and the heroines whom the Greek poets set before us, whom Offenbach makes sing, Giraudoux makes quiver, Goethe makes weep and Racine makes proclaim. Daily life and private life? The association is automatic, and thus symptomatic: when it comes to women, we look at once towards the private, even the intimate, side because now, as then, it is 'within' that we 'naturally' look for them. But obviously nothing, in these matters, is 'natural'. Open a book about women; we find them less often than the home, the family, their sexuality. As if men had neither home, nor family nor sex. 1.\n\nOf course, the status and role of women were not uniform in ancient Greece, and were sometimes more favourable than in Athens; but it is here that they are best known, and at the same time it was here that the situation was one of the most difficult.\n\n4\n\nWomen of Ancient Greece\n\nHere the chiasmus is obvious: in contrast to the collective masculine, the feminine is shattered into a thousand individual interiors. The wives of men, for whom the most important part of life is elsewhere, are not heard. And they make a virtue out of this misfortune, unless it is the men who attach more worth to their modesty, their way of effacing themselves. Let women achieve this, they say, and their whole being will be greatly enhanced. 'In a woman, silence is an element of beauty.' In a famous speech, Pericles, after devoting all his time to evoking the richness and diversity of a citizen's virtues (of male adults), contents himself with one sentence regarding women: 'If you do not fall short of your nature [physis], it will be a great glory to you; and similarly for those women whose merits or failings cause them to be least spoken of among men (Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War ii. 45.2). Stifle their voice - women suffer also from a real identity problem. Although they receive from their father an 'official' name of their own, their male contemporaries use all manner of expressions, pronouns, demonstratives and grammatical processes to deny them a personal identity when talking about them among themselves. If they do name them, it is in a relative manner- relative to the man, father or husband, as 'daughter-of' or 'wifeof'. Since, at the same time, men were extremely careful about the way in which they named themselves, and the symbolic interpretation of their names, this concealment of the identity of women discloses a certain social nonentity. True, the problem goes beyond Greek women, and a glance elsewhere shows that from this point of view they were not the worst off: for example, the Romans did not even give a woman a name, as she was normally called by the feminine version of her father's family name. The main object of this book is to breathe fresh life into accounts of Greek women which have come down to us through more than two millennia. To fulfil this aim, I have chosen to arrange this discovery of the feminine from the starting point of a few 'lives', because taking this option meant choosing texts as well. The successive stories of several women, from Penelope to Neaera, from the early eighth to the late fourth century BC, will certainly bear witness to some singular destinies, but by their interweavings will also contribute to the reconstruction of the image of a gender. We shall leave the soldiers' barracks of the Iliad to go and visit the 'houses' of Athens, and also its courts of law. 2 Some of our guides will be illustrious, 2.\n\nThe Greek house- the oikos- presents the translator with problems; the term simultaneously designates an ensemble of real estate, such as land and possessions (including livestock), even intangible assets, and an ensemble of people: the citizen's family and slaves, a legal entity and a symbolic and religious unit. Written as 'house', in this book the word will describe this rich whole. Written as \"house\", in Chapter 6, it will refer to houses of another kind, the \"houses\" of prostitution.\n\nPrologue: Which paths will lead us to them?\n\n5\n\nlike Homer, while others are anonymous. From such a perspective, the ideal would be total self-effacement, leaving the bare Greek words; but that is impossible, overlaid as they are by a thick layer of scholia, glosses, footnotes, philological commentaries, historical and anthropological interpretations by generations of the learned. Nevertheless, I shall remain careful to preserve the 'freshness' of these texts; respecting not only the content but also the spirit. I shall therefore fairly frequently, like the Greeks, call a spade a spade; this should not be mistaken for gratuitous licence, so-called improper terms are no longer translated into Latin footnotes. From the special nature of the documents on which the historian of Greek women works, specific ways emerge of getting to them; so among these chapters whose content borrows both from women and a privileged source (Homer and the maidens of the epics, Plutarch and the 'house' of Pericles, Xenophon and that of Ischomachus, Apollodorus and prostitution), two other viewpoints will be interposed, embracing a longer period: the body and religion. The body, and bodies, of females and women, but also of males and men: I shall try to reconstruct the view of them through doctors (the Hippocratics) and Aristotle's biological writings. But the inquiry will begin with what compartmentalized history always places last - religion, an examination of the relations which the women of Greece maintained (or were compelled to maintain) with the sacred. I place religion first (although everyone says that it is what matters most in this world and then promptly forgets this priority), because it is the source of enlightenment least likely to be affected by short-term fluctuations and because it makes a powerful contribution to defining the feminine.\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nThe feminine and the sacred\n\nI\n\nn the quest for the Greek concept of the feminine, it would be unthinkable to neglect the religious trail, which encompasses the broadest framework of thinking and the longest period of time. In that world, it would be impossible to omit this dimension. There and at that time, the major part of what we term religion was completely integrated into social, and even political, life and often formed an essential part of it, with religious practices and beliefs conveying and expressing an entire conception of the world and man's relations with it. The reason for that primacy is deepseated and simple: if religion in Greek lands provides such propitious ground for investigation of society, it is because, far from forming a somewhat exogenous truth, it is imbued with the colours of that period and world. Distinctions that are so familiar, so 'normal' to us, such as those between the profane and the sacred, the natural and the supernatural, existed but did not follow the same dividing lines. Another difficulty arises from our modern ideas about belief. The list of all that the Greek equivalent does not contain would be endless: no prophets, no Messiah, no revelation, no book, no dogma, no clergy in the modern sense, no Church, no belief detached from ritual, no omnipotent, creator god who decides everything.1 Not one god, but gods, each in the comparative and none in the superlative, in great numbers unknown to the Greeks themselves, as well as other divine beings who were not all gods. No soul (in the Christian sense), no 'eternal life', no Manichaeism of good and evil with a celestial accountability ... What did they have, then? The popularizer's problem is that it is far harder for him to say what is than what is not. 1.\n\nI am speaking here of religion, not metaphysical speculation. There is every reason to believe that the philosophers' ideas on these matters - of someone like Plato, for instance- had little or no influence on society.\n\nThe feminine and the sacred\n\n7\n\nThey did have a cosmos inhabited simultaneously by men, gods, heroes and the dead, together with - luckily for men - rules of communication between men and these various manifestations of the supernatural. We commonly lump those rules together under the useful term 'ritual'. Here again, Greek ideas differ from our own: far from being secondary in their 'religion', ritual is, at least, on an equal footing with belief. Here, the social aspect takes precedence. Apart from a few details, it could be said that ritual was more for the collective - there was no strong or significant act in social life without ritual sanction- and that belief was more for the individual. In that human and superhuman were not thought of as radically separate, or even contrasting, the dichotomy of the world in its two parts, male and female- a polarity whose nature and effects I shall examine in the following chapter- obviously cuts across the worlds of both men and gods. It is curious, therefore, that it falls to Greek culture, whose distressing misogyny is so often to be observed, to include in its pantheon some of the most beautiful images of the feminine. A daunting element for reflection on the feminine in Greek lands: there, the gods are also goddesses.\n\nThe Feminine in the Divine In the distribution of genders (and sexes) among the Greek immortals, the feminine position is by no means subordinate. Goddesses such as Demeter, Athena or Hera are not concerned with under-secretaryships of state for the affairs of Olympus. Of course, the long history of those gods and the populations who passed on their images helped to shift the divine sex ratio in favour of the masculine; in other words, from the time that gods were recorded in Greece (the middle of the second millennium BC) up to the period that interests us, representation of the feminine in this pantheon showed a decline. Nevertheless, it still holds a record 'feminization rate' among religions. This femininity is far from evanescent, its image is socialized. The first classification is obvious: goddesses are classed as women in a status whose definition is derived from the sexual, the biological and the social at the same time. This triple conjunction of conditions defines three of the greatest - Athena, Artemis and Hestia - as parthenoi, 'virgins'. Other qualities are associated with them: they are pure, indomitable, fierce. They are proud of their virginity, and proclaim it: 'Grant me, 0 father, eternal virginity', says Artemis to her father (Callimachus, Hymn to Artemis 6). They are daughters-of-their-father, Artemis and Athena of Zeus and Hestia of Cronus, with Athena, especially so. 'For to Athena alone among his daughters ... Zeus granted the same powers as her father; no mother\n\n8\n\nWomen of Ancient Greece\n\nThe judgement of Paris. The shepherd-prince Paris has to choose the most beautiful: in the wake of Hermes, who leads them, each goddess shows herself: first, the parthenos Athena, then the wife Hera, but the young man will choose Aphrodite, veiled like a nymphe at her wedding. Antikensammlung, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin- preussischer Kulturbesitz\n\ngave birth to the goddess, but the head of Zeus himself' (Homeric Hymn to Athena xxviii. 4). 2 If this father arranges no matrimonial strategy with a son-in-law for any of them, it is because the virginity of these fortunate ones is eternal, essential, even spiteful, and may tend towards cruelty. Witness to the dreadful fate awaiting those who violate their privacy are the myths describing how mortals lost their sight or perished for having seen one of them bathing. Another testimony to this implacable defence of their virginity is the foreknowledge of death which the dreamer must obtain from dreaming of intercourse with them. In fact, whereas making love with a god or goddess, 'if they enjoy it, predicts (to the dreamers) help from superiors', that is only so with certain goddesses, while with Artemis, Athena or Hestia, it is harmful to lie, even if it brings pleasure: this dream indeed predicts imminent death for the one who has experienced it; for these are noble goddesses, and tradition has taught us that those who have laid hands on them have suffered terrible punishments. (Artemidorus, Interpretation of Dreams i. 80)\n\n2.\n\nOn this myth and what we learn from it of the father's relationship with his kore, see p. 53.\n\nThe feminine and the sacred\n\n9\n\nAthena making a libation. Covered from head to foot, the virgin (parthenos), absolutely pure, unassailable and invincible, proffers a libation to Heracles (not visible). Antikenmuseum Basel und Sammlung Ludwig, Inv., 418\n\nIn this 'perfect' family, each of the three has her own attributes. Athena is probably the most complex; within her field of action she includes technical know-how, as well as the protection of children and young people, effectiveness in war and, in many city-states, the outstanding position of a deity- that is to say, political.\n\n10\n\nWomen of Ancient Greece\n\nArtemis shares with Athena her characteristics of protectress of childhood and youth, her part being specifically birth, pregnant women and those in childbirth. She also has pre-eminence over the natural world, especially animals, and therefore the hunt. 'She enjoys archery and killing wild beasts in the mountains; she also likes the phorminx lyre, dancing, the high-pitched songs of women and shady woods and the city of just men' (Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite (v) 18-20). In contrast, Artemis features less in the political domain than her sister (by the same father, but not mother) Athena. The third daughter, Hestia, Zeus' sister, specializes far more. She is the goddess of the interior- of the 'house' - and even of the inside of the interior: the home's focal point, the hearth, known as hestia. Taking the citystate as a metaphor for the 'house', we find her as the divine protectress of institutions, buildings and also of the men who are at the centre, the heart and head of the political community. There could be said to be three types of virgin: the first of the world of men, the second of that of wild animals, but also of women in labour, and the third, the real parthenos of the heart of the 'house'. Why are these goddesses virgins, holding these powers and fulfilling these functions? What explanation is there for the virginity of those important goddesses of Greek welfare, Athena and Artemis, whom no fighting community could ever forget at the moment of battle, or beforehand or afterwards? Is it because of the equation virgin = fierce = stubbornly courageous? Could that kind of virginal femininity attain the impossible andreia (virility) (seep. 76)? There is an evident transition from the virginity of the maiden to the inviolability of the place, and a concern for the protection of the community. Other goddesses who inhabit Olympus have a sexual life; These include the Muses, Nymphs and the Mother of the Gods, but those who matter most are Aphrodite, Hera and Demeter. 'Though Aphrodite cannot persuade them, Athena, Artemis and Hestia, or seduce them, no one else - blessed god or mortal - can ever escape her' (Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite (v) 33-4). For Aphrodite's main preoccupation is love: Cypris [Aphrodite's nickname] awakens sweet desire in the heart of the gods and subdues the tribes that fly in the air of mortal men, the birds, all the animals that both land and sea raises in great numbers: they all have a care for the works of crowned Cytherea. 3 (Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite (v) 2-6) 3.\n\nAphrodite's origin is variously attributed: she comes from Cyprus, from the waves or, as here, Cythera.\n\nThe feminine and the sacred\n\n11\n\nThere is no doubt at all that Aphrodite is the force that brings beings together and unites their sexes. True, there is another god, in competition or addition, whose power is feared and vaunted, a more masculine god who also possesses an inordinate ability to arouse desire: 'Eros, the most beautiful of the immortal gods, who shakes limbs and, in the breast of every god and man alike, overcomes the mind and wise counsels' (Hesiod, Theogony 120-2). But unlike Eros, Aphrodite goes beyond these feminine/masc uline categories. With her, the whole of life is embraced, above and beyond pleasure; her law applies to all - men, gods and the cosmos - and sweet is the path for anyone who adheres to her first principles (obviously in contradiction to those professed by the virgin goddesses, above all the untamed ones): The holy Uranus 4 loves to penetrate Gaia (the earth) and love lays hold of earth to join in marriage; and desire moves Gaia to enjoy coitus; the rain falls from the streaming Uranus and impregnates Gaia; and she brings forth for mortals the pasturage of sheep and Demeter's sustenance;5 and from their moist union the season of foliage is perfected. Of this I, Aphrodite, am the cause. (Aeschylus, Danaides fr. 44N, quoted by Athenaeus xiii. 600B) Aphrodite has at her disposal all the effective means of attaining her end, most of all beauty. Her body is a dazzling sight, as are her garments, perfumes, adorments, flowers, smiles, to the extent that upon her arrival the 'Immortals stretched out their hands towards her; each desired to make her his wife and carry her off to his 'house'' (Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite (vi) 15-16). Is this goddess of love a wife? Yes, certainly. But how can it be said of the goddess of love that she is 'married'? Whoever is ascribed to her as 'husband and lord', she has a terrible tendency to love others. The Odyssey contains the most famous episode of her unseemly love affairs, when she dares to sully her husband Hephaestus' very own bed in the company of Ares, god of war. Does her lovemaking make her a mother? Yes, if only of Eros, in certain stories. Yes, because she is clearly in favour of creating children, but she is not the kind of mother one would propose as a role model. If we keep only to Hera's fundamental quality, she is a wife. A great goddess, assuredly, the 'Lady' is, however, merely relative. Without Zeus, there is no Hera. Like Hestia, she is his sister, but above all his wife. Of course, 4. 5.\n\nThe name of the god of the sky, Uranus, means 'he who urinates'; the rain falling from the sky is the sperm of Uranus. This is the cornseed, characteristic attribute of the goddess Demeter.\n\n12\n\nWomen of Ancient Greece\n\nZeus and Hera at the wedding of Thetis and Peleus.

It is said, or whispered, that when Zeus and Hera were very young, and Cronus still ruled the cosmos, they had been in love and that their youthful lovemaking produced four divine children: Hephaestus, Ares, Eileithyia and Hebe. But poets most enjoy recounting their fabulous nuptials. Whether on the summit of Mount Ida or in the Garden of the Hesperides, the divine copulation formed the model for the hieros gamos, the 'divine coitus', or 'sacred marriage', a mythical motif of which the Greeks were extremely fond: husband and wife take their pleasure and are fruitful. In many places in Greece, people delighted in commemorating the event. Hera was represented by a statue dressed as a bride, drawn along in a procession similar to that of a human wedding, to the sanctuary, where she came to a nuptial bed. Zeus' sexual partner Hera was also his 'legal' spouse, and if there was a Greek wife who suffered more than any other from sexual competition, because of her husband's insatiability, it was surely she. Later, on the downhill slope of her marriage, she plays to perfection the role of cantankerous and jealous wife. On Olympus she ceaselessly rails against all his mistresses and bastards. Heracles has no other reason for carrying out his Twelve\n\nThe feminine and the sacred\n\n13\n\nLabours than to expiate Hera's wrath towards him. Her portion is the protection of women and marriage, as an institution, and like Athena in Athens, she sometimes also assumes the much more important place of an omnipotent and sovereign city-goddess (Argos, Samos). There remains Demeter, who is by no means the least of the goddesses. She comes second among the siblings of the principal generation of Greek gods, children of the Cronus/Rhea couple. Rhea yielded to the demand of Cronus and bore him glorious children, Hestia, Demeter, Hera of the golden sandals; and the mighty Hades, pitiless god, who established his dwelling beneath the earth; and the resounding shaker of the ground (Poseidon); and the wise Zeus, father of gods and men ... (Hesiod, Theogony 453-7) This group of siblings is not without interest. On the one hand, although split into three persons - Zeus (sky), Hades (subterranean world) and Poseidon (sea) -the masculine evidently adopts only one form: that of the mature adult (we have only to think of the very similar statues of Poseidon and his brother Zeus). On the other, the feminine appears in many forms, in a perspective in which sexual of social roles are defined straightaway: Hestia is the virgin of the interior; Hera, with her 'golden sandals', is the wife, and Demeter the mother. Demeter is so in her very name. Of course, the indispensable fertility of the fields and vital fruitfulness of animals and men come under the aegis of other immortals, other gods and heroes whom humans propitiate in order propagate and prolong life and increase wealth. The goddesses named above, and others, and even (a Greek speciality) certain gods make their contribution in one way or another. In Greek imagination, however, no divine entity other than Demeter represents the image of the fertile and fertilizing mother. Two other deities may perhaps introduce some confusion: Earth and the Mother of the Gods. Gaia, or Ge, 'broad-hipped Earth', who, as we have just seen, was seized by desire for intercourse and received the fertilizing 'rain' from Uranus or Zeus, forms a gigantic womb producing a large quantity of offspring (she sometimes does so on her own). Strictly speaking, she is genealogically among the ancestors of Demeter. Moreover, although these goddesses who are so akin to Demeter have a formidable rate of conception and childbearing, they are not as attached to their children, or their children to them, as Demeter: the bond between Demeter and her offspring is indestructible. Demeter's maternal qualities are truly and continually at work. Indeed, the goddess is inseparable from her daughter, the beautiful Kore, the divine 'Young Maiden'. Their bond and unity are so powerful that the Greeks call them the 'Two Goddesses'. Zeus is certainly\n\n14\n\nWomen of Ancient Greece\n\nhis niece's (Kore) father (nothing especially extraordinary about this), but is insignificant. Of course, in the same way that the Greek pantheon includes other mothers than Demeter, there are other daughters - the famous trio of parthenoi, Athena-Artemis-Hestia - but if Kore is also a parthenos, she is more than just that. Like the Homeric kourai, like Briseis and Chryseis and Nausicaa (see below), she shifts, she moves on. Kore's story illustrates these 'oscillations' (a word I borrow from Sterenn Quemener), which are typical of the Greek females in the next chapter. First, she is a child, in the company of her childhood friends (including Athena and Artemis), gathering flowers in a meadow and brutally carried off by her paternal uncle, 6 a gloomy adult male god, Hades, lord of the Underworld, who wants to possess her and conceal her below ground. From the moment of that violent assault, Demeter ceaselessly searches for her daughter. Her wrath against gods and men is inextinguishable, and her search stubborn. By her will, the earth becomes sterile. Things are going wrong with the cosmos and Zeus, who had been aware but had let it slide, has to take matters in hand and order his abductor/rapist brother to hand the girl back. But Kore has eaten a pomegranate seed, an almost magical act which binds her to the lord of the Underworld. No one can return 'intact' from the 'house' of Hades. It was a real marriage, so the break is accompanied by a change of name: Demeter's daughter will henceforward be known as Persephone. Like a nymphe, from the kore she was before, lo and behold, she is now an adult. There is a necessary compromise for the return of fruitfulness, the revival of the world, related to the KorePersephone division: in winter, Persephone will be sovereign of the infernal world, wife of Hades, then, each spring, returning to her mother, Kore will rise from the furrows as the crops germinate. The Kore/Persephone myth incorporates the virginity/fertility contrast into a perspective that is certainly divine, but also fully human; it illustrates what Greek femininity will initiate us into: alternative roles, ambivalence and ambiguity. This portrait gallery is inevitably short but is enough to illustrate how, through the divine entities that were born, developed and transformed by it, Greek imagination conceived the feminine supernatural as diverse, varying in type, 'instrumental' and social. Looking at the list again, we find the young girl, Kore, daughter-of-her-father; kore and thygater (daughter as direct descendant), like Athena; the virgin parthenoi Athena, Artemis, Hestia; and nymphai (young brides) (Nymphs); and the legitimate spouse, Hera; and the mother, Demeter. In short, the feminine was defined as usual in several ways: biologically - daughter, virgin, mother; socially-\n\n6.\n\nThe close kinship would not have shocked the Greeks.\n\nThe feminine and the sacred\n\n15\n\nwife; sexually- virgin, young bride, mother. These are the many categories by which men refer to the feminine. It is true that, among the goddesses, only wives and mothers are likely to have lovers. It is no surprise that the Greek supernatural shows such readiness to 'mould' itself on completely human categories, because that is peculiar to polytheism. There remains one blind spot, however, in their series of divine types based on the ages of life - that of widowhood and the menopause; there is apparently nothing akin to an old goddess. Nor does age among mortals confer the same qualities on men and women. From the Nestor of the Iliad, Greek culture interminably praises the attributes of old men. 'To the young, actions; to adults, carefully weighed intentions; to the old, prayers' (Hesiod, fr. 321, H-W). Old age brings wisdom, valuable counsel, the superiority of experience and a life unencumbered by the empty search for pleasures. That is why cities chose fairly elderly citizens for magistrates. Perhaps less expectedly, the Greek taste for the immature body does not prevent an appreciation of the beauty of old men: for instance, in the procession of the Panathenaea in Athens a group of thallophoroi, the handsomest old men in the town, parades bearing olive branches. In contrast with this esteem for masculine old age, the feminine often forms a negative pole of disgust. Thus the most menial, the most drunken, the most dissolute of women (in comedy and paintings) are old. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that female old age is not represented in the family of the immortals. Polytheism, however, has its resources. At Stymphalus (a city-state in the Peloponnese), a Hera exists with three nicknames: she is called, both separately and at the same time, Pais, 'Child', Teleia, 'Fulfilled' Wife, and Chera, 'Empty', that is, empty of man, hence 'Widow' (Pausanias, viii. 22. 2). Here, Hera expresses the complete woman in her three ages or conditions, virgin child, wife and old woman. It is the relationship with man which marks out the rhythm of a woman's life: that of marriage more than that of puberty, widowhood, abandonment, and even of menopause.\n\nHumans seeking the Divine So far, so good with the Greek gods in their polytheism, those beings who are so hard to define, to pin down. But a religion worthy of the name - a sufficiently complex system - does not merely offer the image of a certain deity endowed with a certain form and certain qualities; it establishes and regulates the relationships that men have with one or with many divine figures. Rites are bound up with belief, and vice versa. Either extreme may exaggerate the other's weaknesses, but the one does not exist without the other, lest the whole thing can no longer be called 'religion'. But,\n\n16\n\nWomen of Ancient Greece\n\nfundamentally, what are rites if not a complex instrumental communication system between men-who-eat-bread and the immortals? The problem of ritual arises in an unusual way in polytheisms. In this context, any catechism is unimaginable for want of a rule that can be applied in every instance. In fact, each of the gods, goddesses and immortals who compose the divine is defined according to two main themes: his/her function - in which area has he/she the most influence, or the highest level of skill- and his/her own particular way of intervening in the cosmos - using this quality or that. When Ares, a rather brutish lout, uncovers adultery, he kills his rival; in the same situation, Hephaestus, discovering his wife Aphrodite in her lover's arms, fashions a marvellous net which imprisons the lovers in their bed of debauchery, sheepish and unable to move. I hunt, fish, sow corn, desire good harvests, am a general, want to conquer the enemy, so I propitiate a deity 7 who includes hunting, fishing, cereal growing, or fighting among his attributes; at the same time as choosing from those who have the necessary power, in a given context, I set great store by the way he acts. It is, however, far from being enough to pinpoint with certainty the most efficient deity, because much also depends on the request and from whom it originates. For the warrior or magistrate, the most effective deity for armed violence could be Ares, or it could be Athena: brute force on the other hand, and intrepidity, but also tactics and finesse, on the other. But there are other variables, such as knowing from where and in what circumstances the request for the divine emanates, a question that brings in variables of age and sex. Still on the subject of war, in certain circumstances the young men- the epheboi- would turn to a particular group of deities, some of whom were almost theirs alone, whereas the adults, officers or other categories would address those and others besides. This question of the nature of men's requests for benefits from the gods is of course eminently social. For surely men's powerful dominance over women must influence a negative reply to the nonetheless burning question: if there were goddesses, and priestesses in Greece, did a 'feminine religion' exist there and, if so, what forms did it take? Although the pantheon includes a number of goddesses and heroines, and many priesthoods were undertaken by girls and women, that does not imply the existence of a 'feminine religion', enjoying a kind of autonomy, versus another 'religion' which would then be described as 'masculine'. In the Greek scale of values, it is difficult to imagine feminine access to the divine without the ultimate control of men. On the other hand, the fact that such a 'feminine religion' did not exist does not imply an absence of paths, specific to women, 7.\n\nInitially a simplification, this singular is justified also by the fact that experience most often results in the definition of a single god.\n\nThe feminine and the sacred\n\n17\n\nallowing access to the gods. At all events, if a 'religion' of this kind could be identified, the evidence cited above definitely limits its scope: it could not go against or, above all, harm this masculine domination. One might even wager that it would contribute to it. It may be safely suggested that the political community used women (all or some) as actresses, even as privileged actresses, in the rituals, for its greater gain. It has been possible to show that feminine rituals for Demeter, spread throughout the year, corresponded exactly to the various phases of the growth of cereal crops and the human (masculine) labours involved. Note that I said that women, not the feminine, were used. Men, indeed, used all categories of the feminine, from virgins to old women. We shall see how and why. WHOSE VOICES MAY SPEAK TO THE GODS? The gods hear (each god hears) some messages and some interpreters better than others. Consequently, the community entrusts certain of its members with the task of ensuring the best kind of communication with the divine, and this is the characteristic of priestly functions. As the divine had many forms, priesthoods were distributed throughout all categories of society: the young, adults, the old, men and women. Even if there were numerous exceptions, there were general rules in this area, such as the one expressed by Hesiod, according to which the old are better prayers, and another that caused heroes and gods to have priests, while heroines and goddesses had priestesses. The Greeks were very concerned with liturgy and, city by city and god by god, laid down the rules devolving upon the corresponding priesthoods. For goddesses, matters were quite clear: virgins for the virgins, adults for the adults. Regarding the former, the texts specify what is meant - the priestess must be in the state of parthenos - but was more precision needed? Then her state is defined in respect of the man: the maiden will be a priestess 'until she reaches the moment of marriage', 'until she arrives at her nuptials', 'until the time comes for her to be sent to a man' ... For a better understanding of what is at issue, here are three choice stories of priestesses, as recounted in cities, to explain the reasons that impelled the ancestors to choose a certain type of woman for a certain type of priesthood. These aetiological myths illustrate the fact that feminine priesthoods presented men with quite a few specific problems. 8 Women, as we shall see, were deemed to heed only their impulses and would always be in danger of sullying their surroundings; hence divine wrath. First, a 8.\n\nReal or imaginary problems, it matters little because what we are seeking is the Greeks' way of conceiving the relationship of the feminine with the divine.\n\n18\n\nWomen of Ancient Greece\n\ntear-jerking love story which Pausanias, a traveller in the second AD, picked up in Patras. Over there lie a sanctuary and a temple of Artemis, known as Triklaria ... The goddess's priesthood was held by a parthenos, until such time as she was sent to a man. Formerly, the priestess was named Komaitho ['The Redhead'], one of the most beautiful parthenoi, who was loved by one Melanippus ['The Black Horse'], the best and handsomest of the young men of his age. When he managed to get the parthenos to share his love, he asked her father for the girl. Older people are often opposed to youth in all kinds of matters, and are particularly insensitive to the desires of those in love. Like many others, the story of Melanippus proves that love is capable of breaking human laws and profaning the worship rendered to the gods; indeed, their erotic ardour culminated in the very sanctuary of Artemis, which they used as a bridal chamber. Then Artemis' wrath began to destroy the inhabitants. 9 The land no longer produced crops, and strange illnesses appeared, of an unknown nature. When they appealed to the Delphic oracle, the Pythia (propetpriestess of Apollo at Delphi) blamed Melanippus and Komaitho. The oracle ordered them to be sacrificed to Artemis, and that every year the most beautiful parthenos and the handsomest pais ['youngster'] were to be sacrificed to the goddess. (Pausanias, vii. 19. 1-4) Thus the fairest young couple were sacrificed to the irascible goddess, the one who does not take purity lightly. Happily, this stain arising from amorous sacrilege was washed away thanks to the arrival of one Eurypylus, who instituted a new youth ritual which appeased the goddess. Once again, as before these annoying events, Artemis' priestess was chosen from the parthenoi. She - probably the most beautiful - held the office 'until the moment came for her to be sent to a man' (Diodorus, xvi. 16. 2). Second story: the Arcadians had always chosen a 'virgin maid' (kore parthenos) as the priestess of Artemis Hymnia. But it is the common fate of parthenoi, at least in myths, to be pursed by lustful boys, and a certain Aristocrates fell in love with one of them. The girl resisted him, but the inevitable happened: 9.\n\nThe sexual act performed in such a place sullies it and also sullies the deity. In all myths the consequences are the same: divine wrath expressed by visiting a scourge on men, consultation of the oracle by men to understand the reason and/or know the god's will, execution of this in the form of a new ritual. It is precisely this ritual which is known to the men recounting the myth.\n\nThe feminine and the sacred\n\n19\n\nhe subjected her to the final outrage near the statue of Artemis. When the assault became known to all, the Arcadians stoned the guilty party and took care to alter the law. Henceforward, they would no longer choose a parthenos, but a woman (gyne) who had had enough relations with men. (Pausanias, viii. 5. 12) What else can this mean but that Artemis Hymnia 'hears' an 'old woman' just as she hears a parthenos, doubtless because, vis-a-vis the divine, the new priestess of Artemis Hymnia offers qualities similar to those of a virgin. This crosscheck seems to prove that in the final analysis virginity counts for less than chastity. The last story is about antiquity's most famous priestess, the Pythia, who in Apollo's sanctuary at Delphi explained the god's wishes and answered requests for clarification brought by mortals. According to several testimonies, the Pythia is an 'old woman'. It is said that she is fifty years old, too old to remarry, or that she abstains from marrying a man. It is all the same. The inhabitants of Delphi tell that formerly a parthenos had officiated, but that a young Thessalian named Echecrates had fallen in love with the maiden ... Faced with the danger of such a taint, the people of Delphi changed the rules of the game, and henceforward the priestess would be a 'woman aged fifty' who would have to dress like a virgin (the detail is symbolic). Of course, in all these stories, the 'old woman' is not as good as the virgin; she is a virgin in a minor key. Nevertheless, there is the same outcome. When the virgin is lacking, neither a man nor an adult woman is chosen, but a woman 'who-has-had-enough-relatio ns-with-a-man'. In the liturgy, the life of a Greek woman, like that of Hera, is clearly divided into three parts: before the man, during the man and after the man. So much for the important priesthoods. If divine service was extended to the people who spent a fairly long period of seclusion in the sanctuaries, or even to those who took part in religious processions, the fundamental teachings did not alter. In the many processions for this or that god or goddess, the (men) placed neither men nor women at the head, but virgins. These leading maidens are often called 'kanephoroi', for like the Caryatids of the Erechtheion on the Acropolis in Athens, they carry on their heads baskets containing the cult's sacred objects - ribbons and sacrificial knives -which only pure hands may touch. They are chosen from the most beautiful, they are pubescent, the daughters of citizens (and not the least among them). Purity - therefore strict sexual abstinence - is their golden rule. They are parthenoi of pre-marriageable age. The place? The town, outside the 'house'. The public? The community, men of all ages, citizens. They are jubilant, the god is being feted, and soon there will be feasting. This\n\n20\n\nWomen of Ancient Greece\n\npomp-filled march of the maidens- with as many thygatres 10 as parthenoi - filing past under the masculine gaze, resembles a parade of marriageable girls. All these priesthoods and religious services of virgins in the pre-marital days could not be embraced in a 'feminine religion' or even in specifically feminine ways of gaining access to the divine. The purpose of the processions was to lead men and beasts to the place of sacrifice, and if one looks at the raison d'etre of the entire display and of the actions and of the participants, there is nothing feminine and not a trace of 'femininity' about them. The language used by men in those circumstances, confident as they were of being understood by the gods, comprised nothing peculiarly feminine. On the contrary, what could be more masculine than the bloody sacrifice, with the ritualized slaughter of the domestic animal, its butchery, cooking and communal consumption, which were the aims of these processions? The presence of virgins- or old women- in these ceremonies can therefore be explained only by this reason: their purity. If adult women are kept apart from such divine service, if virgin (or old) priestesses are chosen, if pre-pubescent virgins are placed at the head of processions, it is not so that the latter can take part as women, it is to avoid taint: menstrual blood, contact with men, and having being touched by the wings of death. We return to the axiom of masculine dominance. How can any form of worship be imagined that could challenge it or even, on a minor scale, be content to occupy itself with anything other than the well-being of the political community and its members? Even if feminine ways could find any echo in the divine as conceived in Greek heads, their effectiveness could be exerted only to the profit of men. Nevertheless, even understood as a depraved version of the masculine, the feminine exists in Greek culture, and we shall meet it in misogyny and anatomy, physiology, eroticism, demography, society ... If polytheism really reflects the world here below, 'femininity' must be hiding in there somewhere. If this is so, its ways of access to the divine must have a different resonance, the idiom used must comprise something that contrasts it with, or at least differentiates it from, the language of the majority, that of men. WOMEN SPEAK THE FEMININE RITUAL LANGUAGE Every year in the autumn, in most Greek cities, citizens' wives emerged from their homes to assemble for three days in a sanctuary, often outside the walls, with the intention of celebrating Demeter and Kore. Men were\n\n10.\n\nPlural of thygater: daughters in the sense of lineage.\n\nThe feminine and the sacred\n\n21\n\nexcluded; they were not to know anything about it (including the symbolic 'message' conveyed by the ritual) or, a fortiori, to be present physically. This secrecy explains why not everything is clear when it comes to describing the content of these rites. It is known that, after remaining chaste for three days, some of the participants raised from the depths of natural or manmade pits the putrid remains of piglets which had been thrown into them some months before, accompanied by dough facsimiles of phalloi and snakes. This animal 'humus' possessed powerful fertilizing virtues, and was afterwards mixed with seeds to ensure good germination and growth Demeter's customary and normal fields of activity. The second day, which was inauspicious, was a Fast. In Athens, the women ascended the hill of the Pnyx in a body, and stayed sitting on strewn branches of the wild pepper shrub, an anaphrodisiac plant. In this way they commemorated the mourning of Demeter as she went is search of her Kore. This day was as inseparable from its morrow as a crotchet from its quaver in the heart of a syncopation; their way of putting their body to sleep on that day, and starving it (food and sexual appetite was one and the same to the female belly), made them ready for the coming day, which was the third, that of the Beautiful Birth. From the minor key, as they waited, they passed to the major, in the actualization. The time had come to procreate; the atmosphere was one of gaiety, the women exchanged obscenities, sacrificed pigs, feasted with one another. And all that was for the greater good of the living world: human fruitfulness and the fertility of the fields. Now for a change of scene. These same wives left their 'house' (abandoning it to its fate) for a place that was far from men and even from human beings; they would walk a very long way and meet by night on the mountain. But once there, they became unrecognizable. They had already started on the mimetic process that would bring them closer to their model, their master Dionysus. Barefoot, a garland of ivy on their free-flowing hair, with a typical long, pleated tunic, a girdle of coarse wool, the nebris - a tanned fawn- or goat-skin - over their shoulders, knotted by its feet over their breast, holding the thyrsus - a long wand made of the stem of a large umbellifer - adorned with ribbons and topped with a pinecone - thus appeared the votary of Dionysus, commonly known as a bacchant or maenad. They might also carry the ritual instruments, tambourines, and torches. This get-up was the ritual costume for women, but also for Dionysus, and for the bacchants as well. How are we to understand it? For the god, the answer is easy; he is androgynous, he is the man-woman god. As for the bacchants, if there were plenty of them, it proves that in order to participate in the Dionysiac ritual - the orgiastic ritual - they had to transform themselves into women. In the ecstatic worship of Dionysus, the feminine dominated outrageously, although it was not exclusive. Is there\n\n22\n\nWomen of Ancient Greece\n\nany need to emphasize that, for the faithful follower, this might mean abandoning his manliness, if only symbolically? Donning the Dionysiac costume was an important step in the direction of what, crescendo, the whole being of the female zealot was striving for: possession. Wives, who the day before had been confined in their 'houses' but were now immersed in the rawness of the wild, acted out the orgies of Dionysus which turned them into 'madwomen' (the first meaning of maenads). For the 'costume' of the maenad was that of Dionysus and the imitation of the god, even identification with him, was one of the mainsprings of this cult. The first act of dispossessing oneself, which was in the strict sense an ecstasy- ekstasis, a 'displacement', 'distraction'- putting on the garments, also incorporated the faithful into the Bacchic community, which was at first calm but then gradually led by ritual into trance and 'enthusism'- from entheos, 'having the god inside oneself', whence 'possessed' or 'inspired'. Rendered beside herself by ecstasy, the maenad left room within herself for the coming of Dionysus. That could not happen all by itself.\n\nMaenad. Acting the bacchant also involved 'taking the habit'. The maenadic costume expressed freedom and wildness; garments that flowed free like their hair, thyrsus in the left hand and a leopard in the other, a nebris (fawnskin) slung over their shoulders. Staatliche Antikensammlungen und Glyptothek Miinchen\n\nThe feminine and the sacred\n\n23\n\nFirst of all fatigue had to be taken into account: having left her 'house', she had walked a long time to reach the mountain where, away from her own home, she was in the home of the god. The Delphic thiasos thus ascended to the summit of Parnassus, at an altitude of some 2,500 metres. What kind of state was she in when the nocturnal celebrations began, preceded by the ecstatic dancing? The latter lasted long enough for her to attain that detachment from reality which she was seeking. Here, everything was strange, with strange music, strange rhythms, haunting insistent cries. Each woman reached her state of 'enthusiasm' in a different way. One might have the gift of getting there quickly, the gift of delirium, and paintings would show such a woman with her head thrown back, vaguely waving her arms, a pronounced bending of the small of her back, her hair flying, eyes rolled upwards, a convulsive attitude. These characteristics were both common and idiosyncratic. Another might show less aptitude for trance and remain outside the whole affair. An adage said that there were many thyrsi - many zealous devotees of Dionysus, both male and female - but few of the faithful who reached the state of possession by the god. In many Greek towns, baccheia of women are held every two years, and it is the rule that the parthenoi must carry the thyrsus and take part in the manifestations of possession by giving cries of evoe and honouring the god; as for the (married) women, they sacrifice to the god in a body, act the bacchants and with various chants celebrate the coming of Dionysus, imitating the Maenads, whom history makes the god's companions. (Diodorus, iv. 3. 3) Here what matters is the mimetic aspect of the women who 'act the maenads' by imitating the mythological maenads, companions of the god's coming, and the contrast between the behaviour of the adult women who really act the bacchants and that of the young girls who are merely in a preparatory stage, contenting themselves with holding the thyrsus and uttering the ritual cry. Observation of similar rites such as voodoo teaches this clearly; one must pass through an apprenticeship with those who already know how to attain ecstasy in order to achieve it oneself. But what has become of the wife, mother, mistress of the house? Women loved to fete Dionysus, to celebrate him in all sorts of ways, but above all to lose themselves in order to find themselves again in him. In our search for them, much of what we have to go on comes from what men wrote about them so the sincerity and true feelings of the maenads themselves are necessarily and regretfully missing, and it is left to us to try to recreate and imagine their enjoyment. All the same, let me quote Lysistrata, in the play\n\n24\n\nWomen of Ancient Greece\n\nby Aristophanes, noting the late arrival of the women she has called together to start up the 'love strike' which is to keep the peace: 'Ah! if they had been invited to a baccheion, 11 or to Pan's or Aphrodite's shrine ... there wouldn't be room to slip between the tambourines' (Aristophanes, Lysistrata l-3). We can see in which direction Aristophanes is looking when he associates the Bacchic cult with what H. Jeanmaire calls 'devotions of a questionable kind'. He likens cults, which should certainly have a distinction drawn between them, to one another, but the unbridled feminine libido is a mechanism of comedy whose success is assured. However, it cannot be denied that similarities do exist. The idea of pleasure is connected with maenadism, which is why it is contrasted with domestic work. Those who would set such a great store on virtue that, for the sake of the 'house', they would stoically reject the pleasure of going to 'maenadize' with their friends, must be out of their mind: 'Minyas, the son of Orchomenos, had three daughters: Leucippe, Arsippe and Alcathoe, and they became absurdly workaholic. They had nothing but reproach for the other women who deserted the town to act the bacchants in the mountains .. .' (Antoninus Liberalis, Metamorphoses x. 1). We all know that myths simplify, but here are two opposite ends of the scale. There is that of feminine work, with Athena, in which everything focuses inward - chastity, temperance and hard work - and that of Dionysus and Aphrodite, in which everything is extrovert - love, dancing, music. This conflict is witnessed by one Nicarete who, having 'had enough of working on Athena's shuttles', decides to 'throw into the fire, before the temple of Cypris, her basket, her bobbins and all the other tools of her trade' to become a courtesan: 'Farewell, wretched drudgery of women who are not worthy of the name, who know only how to wither their youth, [I choose] to have garlands and a harp and to lead a joyful life in banqueting and celebrating' (Palatine Anthology vi. 285, Nicarchos?). Any of these attitudes carries a risk. On the one hand, to spend one's time acting the frenzied, tousle-haired maniac up in the mountains, losing the very notion of what is illusion and what is real, what is human and what is divine, going as far as challenging one's own position- from every point of view, sexual, social, religious, men would find it all quite unbearable if they were not reassured by its temporary, localized and ritualized nature. There is no knowing in what condition the mother of the family returned home after those frantic nights on the mountain, but return she did and she resumed the prosaic daily chores. On the other hand, rejecting those mountain rituals of the sake of housework (or temperance), like 11.\n\nLike the thiasos, the baccheion is the material, human and institutional setting of the ecstatic worship of Dionysus.\n\nThe feminine and the sacred\n\n25\n\nMinyas' three daughters, constituted at the very least a proud stance. Above all, it was a challenge to the power of a god like Dionysus, and you did not know him well if you defied him like that. To get some idea of the risk they ran, hear the end of the myth: Dionysus, in the guise of a young girl, exhorted them not to miss his rites and mysteries. But they paid no heed. Irritated by this attitude, Dionysus changed himself, no longer into a maiden but into a bull, a lion and a leopard, and from the height of the weaving looms nectar and milk flowed in his honour. Seeing these prodigies, the girls were seized with terror. Without wasting a moment, all three put dice in a jar which they shook; it was Leucippe's die which fell out; she vowed to offer a victim to the god and, with the help of her sisters, she dismembered Hippasos, her own son. (Antoninus Liberalis, Metamorphoses x. 2-3) When Dionysus showed his power, he made those who resisted him truly mad, taking the effects of the maenads' trance to extremes for those conceited girls. If we try to understand this unheard-of cruelty, a murder committed in common, we must look at the maenads of the world. We know how Leucippe's child was killed: he was torn to pieces with their bare hands. In another version, they 'tore him apart as if he were a fawn'. Then off they went, 'acting the bacchants in the mountains, nibbling at ivy, convolvulus and laurel.' The climax of the experience was the feeling of losing the boundaries between oneself and the others, oneself and the god, oneself and the world, which was a transcedence at the same time as an escape. Not much is known about the ways in which the ecstatic dance became transformed into a chase or a hunt. In this setting there lies a feminized, thus untamed, recollection of the customary sacrificial behaviours - masculine and civilized. The thiasos pursed a young animal, a fawn or a kid (an acolyte may have released it into the wild), hunting it in what was known as 'Aphrodite's hunt'. It was encircled, one of the women pinned it down with her body, the others came up and began to tear at it with their bare hands and rip it to pieces. This was the 'dismemberment', the ritual form of the Bacchic sacrifice, and that was how Leucippe killed her son. Such is the behaviour of those whom Dionysus punishes with his madness. Cries and shouts punctuated the completion of the dismemberment, when they hurled themselves on what the still quivering animal offered them: its blood and flesh, obviously raw. This gorging filled with the powerful odours of the living animal added a dizzying dimension. It was said that the Thracian bacchants ended by devouring one another.\n\n26\n\nWomen of Ancient Greece\n\nWith the chase (which corresponded to the procession), the killing, the meal of flesh, combined in a wild, ferocious, 'cannibalistic', uncivilized and therefore 'feminine' way, we see a reflection of the stages of political, cultural and masculine sacrifice. There is the same inversion regarding Demeter. Men did not sacrifice pigs by throwing them into pits; if they slaughtered that animal, it was not so that it could rot, but to have it cooked and eaten. Against a common backdrop, feminine 'sacrifices' and the customary masculine sacrifice are poles apart. It goes even further in that, while in 'normal' sacrifices the protagonists are kept at a distance from one another, the man from the beast and the god, the beast from the god and the god from the earth, Dionysiac ritual works towards a confusion of types. The fawn or the kid is Dionysus himself. From the ascent onto the mountains, the rite always had as its aim to do away with the distance between the natural and the supernatural but also, within the thiasos, to bind together those who had come to lose themselves collectively. If communities of women, a feminine sociability, existed in Greek cities, it is to be found in these groups of celebrants: among the maenads as among women in their celebrations of Demeter. The tension wound down, the women descended again from heaven to earth and went back to their 'house'. They retained the power of a memory, of the Dionysiac images. Euripides passed it on in his extraordinary play the Bacchae: How sweet it is in the mountains, coming from running with the thiasoi, to let oneself sink to the ground, wearing the holy nebris, to hunt the blood of the goat that is slain, the delight of raw meat, racing to the mountains of Phrygia and Lydia.l 2 The Roarer 13 leads the dance. The ground streams with milk and wine, it streams with the nectar of bees ... (Euripides, Bacchae 135-40) One of the shepherds sent to spy on the bacchants in the mountains by Pentheus, the rather misogynistic and argumentative king of Thebes, who was inimical to Dionysus and his cult, tells us: Your mother, sprang to her feet amidst the bacchants, and gave the ritual signal to awaken them ... Shaking the deep sleep from their eyes, marvels of ordered calm, all arose, all, young and old, and virgins ignorant of the yoke. First, they let down their hair over their shoulders; then I saw them pull up their fawnskins, whose ties had been loosened, 12. 13.\n\nRegions of Asia Minor where the Greeks believed that Dionysus originated. 'Bromios', one of Dionysus' many names.\n\nThe feminine and the sacred\n\n27\n\ngirdling those dappled hides with snakes which licked their cheeks; and others, picking up little fawns or wolf cubs, offered them the white milk of their new motherhood- young mothers who had deserted their children. All adorned their foreheads with coronets of ivy, oak or flowering bryony. And when one of them rapped the rock with her thyrsus, a flow of limpid water immediately sprang forth from it; another having struck the ground with her narthex [the stem of a giant umbellifer], the God made a spring of wine emerge from it. Those who felt thirsty for the white beverage, scratching the soil with their fingertips, collected jets of milk in plenty. Sweet streams of honey dripped from the ivy-garlanded thyrsi . .. When the time was right, they waved their thyrsi for the bacchic dances. With one voice, they invoked Iacchos, the son of Zeus, the Roarer. The whole mountain, and its wild animals, took part in their trance; nothing remained still before their running ... (Euripides, Bacchae 723-7) But the spying shepherds were discovered by the bacchants: We at least were able to escape the bacchants by fleeing, or they would have torn us to bits. But without so much as a weapon in their hands they fell upon our cattle which were grazing in the meadow. You would have seen a bellowing heifer with distended udder seized by one of them\n\nDionysus in his world. The god is on his throne, a vine stock in his right hand (or hanging) and a wine flask in his left, in a setting of enthusiasmos or Dionysiac frenzy. In the dishevelled procession two dancing maenads frame a silen, wild man, playing a double pipe. Staatliche Antikensammlungen und Glyptothek Miinchen\n\n28\n\nWomen of Ancient Greece with her two arms open wide; others tore full-grown cows to pieces; you would have seen ribs and cloven hooves hurled to and fro and strips of flesh hanging on the fir trees, dripping blood. Raging bulls with anger mounting in their horns stumbled to the ground, countless hands of girls attacking them and tearing all the flesh that covered them ... (Euripides, Bacchae 734-46) And like a flock of birds taking flight, they launched themselves towards the plains below ... like an enemy horde ... they laid waste to everything, snatching children from their homes. Everything they bore on their shoulders remained there, without being attached, without falling to the black soil; no, not even bronze or iron. Even fire, mingling with their hair, failed to burn them. The villagers, infuriated by this pillage by the bacchants, took up weapons. 0 king! then there was a terrifying spectacle. The spears' metal tips did not so much as draw blood; but they, merely by hurling their thyrsi, covered their enemies with wounds. Those women made men turn their backs in flight, proof that a god was helping them! Then they returned to the place where their race had begun, to the very springs that the god had created for them; they washed off the blood, and their snakes licked away all traces of the blood dripping down their cheeks. Whoever this deity is, my master, welcome him to your city. He is surely great and, from what I hear, they say he is above all the one who gives mortals the vine that drives away sorrows. (Euripides, Bacchae 748-72)\n\nThere is no doubt that it is a far cry from these bacchants of the theatre to the wives on the mountain. But Euripides' play would have been unacceptable if the public had not recognized in it at least part of the common dimension of the strangeness of the figure of Dionysus and the unique nature of the maenadic experience, individually and collectively. The message was simple: no to the intellectuals, to that 'wisdom' that derives its strength from reason alone and 'superhuman thinking' as practised by 'people who think themselves superior', which 'jibs at the god's call'; it will be dissolved by his will, at the risk of true madness. 'Life is short' and 'what the simple crowd accepts and practises, that is what I would accept,' declares the one who yields to Dionysus. Historically, ecstatic Dionysiac ritual opened its arms to the underprivileged; emanating from the feminine part of society, it is not surprising that it made gains among its neighbours in hopelessness. The thiasoi were gradually filled with slaves and foreigners: new followers of this pure and simple message, of 'communion with nature and simplicity of heart'. Besides this earthly happiness that must be\n\nThe feminine and the sacred\n\n29\n\n'naturally' enjoyed, Dionysus offered 'extras': promises of gentle deaths, if not bliss in the hereafter. AN EPISODE IN THE 'BATTLE OF THE SEXES'? It is a very revealing point that maenadism was essentially feminine, and that when men took part in the orgy they slipped into feminine garments and behaviour. So it is customary to interpret these ritual practices on the basis of what I call the 'safety-valve theory'. Bacchic celebrations are supposed to have formed permissible compensations, tolerated by men, an (inexpensive) counterpart to the confined life of the 'houses', on the lines of 'Go ahead, dance to your heart's content, but then come back calmly, until the next time.' Ecstasy conceived as a periodic behavioural safetyvalve? Certainly. How can it be denied that the rites up in the mountains could form an appropriate backdrop to the expression of repressed desires? In that case, on the social level, Dionysism would be no more than the result of a masculine permissiveness, a 'magnanimity' that would engulf the feminine frustrations which were born and developed in that 'androcracy'. This escape-valve theory can moreover be transposed to the more general level of Greek 'religion'. Indeed, it is certainly not erroneous to understand women's liking for maenadism as a result of the derelict condition in which men's 'religion', political 'religion', left them. When they were still virgins, they certainly played uniquely instrumental, and prestigious, roles. Once women, they appeared only as spectators (if that), whereas, like the cult of Demeter, maenadism let them play the major part. Although the cathartic element of these dances and chases is totally believable, and there is little doubt that they could partly allay the social neurosis caused by the life imposed on women, that does not take account of their raison d'etre. Such an explanation is in fact somewhat fanciful and does not pay enough attention to the primary principle of masculine domination. It would be difficult to explain away this tolerance by a male 'philogyny', which is unexpected here. How can we understand why this hierarchical and repressive society, which fully intended to bend women's necks beneath the yoke, should accept in its bosom such a subversive cult, even if it found its expression far off in the mountains? The answer must necessarily satisfy that first requirement according to which, in the final analysis, it is men who have to derive benefit from the feminine ritual, as they do from the actions of the wives/mothers in their festivals of Demeter, in order to have fine children and good harvests. Since it is hard to picture them as caring about their wives' nervous indispositions, we must look elsewhere. We must rethink the relationship between the partners in the ritual exchange. There are three partners: man in this plea for protection, the\n\n30\n\nWomen of Ancient Greece\n\ndivine as conceived by the human mind, and the language which, by virtue of this conception of the divine, men believe to be effective in expressing that plea. First of all, the divine. Why should we imagine other reasons for the worship of Dionysus than those fundamental ones which prevail for other gods? Like them, he is generous: he distributes growth, youth, vigour, and more specifically, the vine, wine, pleasure and the theatre. There are therefore a 1,000 reasons to propitiate him. But he is also one of the most terrible gods: his speciality is to insinuate himself into the mind of man and to drive him mad. When men witness displays of madness, they think of Dionysiac mania. When Heracles, a prey to monstrous hallucinations, kills his own children, the spectator knows that it is not a matter of the ritual madness of the maenads, but that the causes of the hero's dementia are different; he nevertheless clearly recognizes in Heracles' behaviour the behaviour of a bacchant. Now, the same god who punishes by inflicting dementia is a psychotherapist. This is the usual ambivalence of Greek gods: Apollo sends illness and heals, Artemis sends scourges and institutes rites to appease. Whether to obtain good or prevent ill, human communities must above all not forget Dionysus and his august rituals. Look what happened to the daughters of Minyas. There remains the matter of voice, language and its modulation - in other words, how? How best to propitiate this terrible yet beneficient god; to which form of speech is Dionysus most susceptible? To the voice of women. The linguistic setting in which they used to speak to the god was not radically different from that used by men. It, too, was linked by wandering, chanting (including prayers and dances), sacrifices (peculiar ones) and the eating of meat. Similarly, when it came to organizing the worship of Demeter, the women based their 'institutions' on those of men, gathered in political groupings, held meetings, elected 'presidents' and deliberated like true citizenesses. It is said that they were imitating them, but was there any other way of envisaging social and political life when one lived in a city? Interpreting the Greek feminine as less-than-masculine , one may think that, if there is a feminine pathway leading to a deity, who was himself imagined to be receptive, it expresses less a divergent language - a kind of barbarianism incomprehensible to men -than a different modulation in a common language, less perfect but with a particular colour, scent and tone, and one which the god hears. To absolve Greek culture of the sin of misogyny by pleading the existence of goddesses and priestesses is to bow to appearences. If we examine the imagery and consider all we know of the unfolding of the rituals, we can see clearly that the priestess is on her own in the midst of a wholly masculine world. Her presence in these circumstances by no means implies that we are dealing with a 'feminine' ritual. The opposite is happening.\n\nThe feminine and the sacred\n\n31\n\nWhatever the reason - sometimes given by an aetiological myth - invoked by men for the presence of a female, of a particular female, as a major feature of the rite, she is never there on her own account. Rather, she is used by them as an instrument, to serve them on the social as well as on the political plane, and in the end she merely maintains masculine domination. Religion forms both an accurate and powerful indication of Greek femininity. The means of access to the divine followed by the rituals for Demeter and her daughter and for Dionysus are far more feminine than the rituals for other gods in which girls and women take part; the language is violent, wild and ecstatic, coarse and earthy, sexualized; virgins do not yet know how to express it, only the adult, married woman, mother speaks it well. If for the Greeks there is just one true, single form of the feminine, the feminine with the greatest difference, it is this one.\n\nIntermezzo: Origins of Greek Misogyny The history of the common opinion about women contains enough invariables to defy time, at least partly. Thus there is little so constant in men's discourse on women as their sad refrain of ill-will towards them. Misoygyny runs throughout Greek history, forming a permanent backdrop although, along the way, it temporarily assumes new colours. We enter the subject by way of a strange document that goes directly to the heart of the matter. This Iambic on Women, the work of Semonides of Amorgos, 14 breaks several records: it is the first text in western literature to have woman as its sole subject, and it is by far the most scathing. From the outset, it is no holds barred: 'In the beginning, the deity created the mind, without taking account of woman.' 15 Ontologically, women are inferior beings; this is fundamental, and will remain so, defining woman as a being without a mind, with the immediate result that she is outside humankind. From this metaphysical viewpoint, strictly speaking, we could stop there, if Greek men were concerned with nothing but the human. But they were also interested in their surroundings, in domestic animals for example, and it was from that same perspective that they could take an interest in the women who, like the animals, lived alongside them. The study of women\n\n14.\n\n15.\n\nThis poem was recopied by a compiler of the fifth century AD, Stobaeus, in his chapter 'On Marriage', 'Women rebuked' section (iv. 22. 193). Almost nothing is known about Semonides, who probably lived in the mid-seventh century BC. M. Trede has shown that the sense is programmatic: from the outset the woman is thought of as lacking in mind.\n\n32\n\nWomen of Ancient Greece\n\ncould thus be conducted like that of the subjects of systematic zoology, a kind of zootechnics, which at the time was not without interest. It is this type of science, the essence of woman, which Semonides reveals throughout the poem devoted to it: by virtue of her defects, he embodies each 'breed', or rather, each type of woman, in a kind of 'heraldic' animal. To do this he dips deeply into a shared knowledge where nothing needs to be demonstrated, which can be taken as read, a living knowledge which persists simply because men experience a certain relish in hearing this criticism rehashed. Rather like Aesop (to whom he is chronologically close), Semonides brings animals on stage in order to illustrate the particular features of this abject and non-human being, woman. A BESTIARY TO EXPRESS THE OPPROBRIUM OF WOMEN We begin with the dirt/disorder group of the foul-smelling woman. This feminine defect is expressed in three animal species. The sow model develops it to extremes, for 'never taking a bath' is indeed almost nonhuman. The 'haughty mare with the long mane' also belongs to this breed, paradoxically, considering her appearance: lazy and mad about her body, this strumpet does not even take the trouble to throw out her rubbish. Lastly, the wretched weasel-woman can be imagined only enveloped in an indescribable stench. Laziness can be found in as diametrically opposed behaviours as that of the 'grey she-ass' which has to be beaten and 'does nothing without reluctance', and that of the aristocratic 'long-maned mare', with her tendency to make others do the work. Stupidity is another feminine quality that is much shared. This is the instance of earth-woman, who is so inept that she 'does not realize that it is cold and has not enough sense to move her seat nearer to the fire'. There is also the sea-woman, 'unbearable to look at and be with . . . so wild one cannot approach her', and then the monkeywoman who to her other imperfections adds that of not being aware of her own appearance. And then there is malice, that of the sow-woman, bitchwoman and sea-woman, 'hard and hateful towards everyone, friends or enemies', and also the monkey-woman who 'spends all day wondering how she can do the most ill possible.' The husband, who dreams only of a peaceful life, is at a loss when faced with this aggressive being who '(always) finds something to reproach him with and arms herself for the fray.' Voraciousness, an expected feature of the sow-woman, is also present in others such as the earth-woman and the she-ass-woman who, although beaten, 'eats night and day in the depths of her dwelling, and eats by the hearth', in other words, just as much in the female part of the house as in\n\nThe feminine and the sacred\n\n33\n\nthe part that is open to guests. The champion is the weasel-woman, that 'poor and miserable creature' whose greed drives her to the point of eating raw meat. Eating raw food is feminine (compare p. 25): she is an animal, we keep on being told. Incontinence in the matter of 'Aphrodite's works' is the trait most shared by the women of the various tribes. Moreover, if the bee-woman is the only species that merits attention, it is 'because she does not like to remain seated in the company of women when they are talking about love.' The horrors that are recounted among the battalion of confirmed nymphomaniacs. They include the she-ass who 'accepts any partner whatever' when making love, and the weasel, whose lustfulness ends by making her partner ill. As for the 'long-maned mare', she excels in using her body as a trap into which the husband falls and remains prisoner (like Hesiod's Pandora, see p. 36). In any case, in the everyday Greek imagination, many of the poem's animal models, like the sow, the bitch and the mare, evoke images - sometimes rich and accurate - connected with an unbridled sexuality (see pp. 98-9). Fickleness is included in the models of the vixen-woman and the seawoman. What can be expected of a being who is unable to distinguish between good and evil (vixen-woman; earth-woman), and is therefore incapable of virtue; what of a thief (ass-woman), of one who is eternally dissatisfied, constantly looking to the outside world, 'who wants to hear and know everything, casting avid glances everywhere', like the bitch-woman, nosey and envious? This extrovert nature, allied with laziness (the second linked to the first) and with piggishness, explains why 'whoever lives with a woman ... will not drive Famine, that hateful companion, terrible deity, from his home in a hurry'. It would be less dreadful if the husband managed to suffer in silence and the matter was hushed up, but that is impossible. His misfortune becomes public simply because of the one who is its cause. Even if he 'keeps his mouth shut', his neighbours learn of it and 'like to see him up to his ears in it', and he becomes the object of general derision. Furthermore, having this animal in his home, how could he live up to the sacred demands of hospitality when 'wherever there is a woman, one cannot even keep a warm welcome for the guest who turns up'? Bearing in mind that woman is obviously uncivil by nature, and that hospitality is reciprocal, it is equally not a good thing to find oneself in the company of a bitch-woman 'at one's host's, for nothing can be done to stop her barking'. All this can best be summed up in Semonides' conclusion: 'Women- the greatest evil Zeus created ... ' However, all is not lost: one possible, bearable form of the feminine remains- the bee, the only one to enjoy a flattering portrait:\n\n34\n\nWomen of Ancient Greece Lucky is the man who has received her, for she alone escapes reproach, his fortune prospers and grows thanks to her and she grows old beside her husband who loves her and whom she loves, after giving him fine and praiseworthy offspring; she stands out among all women and a divine grace surrounds her ... This kind of woman is the best and wisest which Zeus has granted to men.\n\nWhat a joy to possess such a 'house', when it thus imitates the hive. An army of workers with, at their head, a worker-in-chief, industrious herself and inspirational. Through her care and her good management of wealth (and thanks to her lack of appetite), she contributes to the prosperity of her husband's 'house'. Then she has this charis, the divine gift which attracts attention and renders her lovable. Charis is far from negligible, and some 1,000 years later, Plutarch makes a neat comment on its power: The union of a man and a woman ... can only lead to love, if only by the 'grace' (charis) that accompanies it. 'Grace' ... is the word used in antiquity to describe the woman's consent to the man's amorous desire. So it was that Pindar declared that Hera conceived Hephaestus 'without grace'. (Plutarch, Eroticus 751c-d)\n\nIf this queen bee, endowed with charis, who loves her 'king' and gives him fine children, exists, then there may be some advantage in living with women in this world. But the battle is lost beforehand, in no way does the bee upgrade the value of the gender to which she belongs; if we take a closer look at her, she has only a relative value, she is worth less in herself than for what she contributes to her husband; she gives endlessly- children (who will look after him), work (which brings riches, building up the fortune) and solicitude (taking care of him when he is old). However, since this 'extreme' example, the bee, is nonetheless a woman, like the rest of the species, she is basically lacking intellect. Systematic as it appears at first, the Iambic on Women is arranged around a small number of key ideas, the main ones to be found in the work of another poet, Hesiod, one or two generations earlier. The tone and subjects are different, however. Hesiod recounts the origin of the world and the gods and, in doing so, the creation of the Greek Eve like that of the mountains or rivers. If Semonides' theme is partly aimed at being amusing, that of this illustrious predecessor is quite different: a brother in misogyny, he is more serious, more sententious.\n\nThe feminine and the sacred\n\n35\n\nHESIOD AND PANDORA, THE GREEK EVE As we read in Hesiod, 16 Pandora is enough to define the 'race of women', since from her came 'the race of women, those female beings. From her came the accursed breed, the tribes of women' (Hesiod, Theogony 590-1). The detail is important: women were born of Pandora. It is clear that, just as Adam was not born of a woman, Greek men were not the issue of their ancestral Eve; only women were descended from her. This comes as no surprise for us, who have just read about Semonides: had not the deity, from the start, 'created mind without taking account of woman', with the result that she belonged to a different species from man? 17 Pandora thus means woman, and she alone. First, her origins: Zeus uses her as a lure in the plan he has formed to take revenge on the deceptions of Prometheus and, further still, on humankind. He has decided to send an evil upon men: not just any evil but, cunning as he is, a 'beautiful evil', a seductive evil. At his request , the gods will take it in turns to manufacture it. Hephaestus models moistened clay and from it fashions 'a pleasant virgin's body' (Semonides' earth-woman); Athena both adorns her and teaches her illico, how to weave cloth (hardly has she been born when she has turned her shuttle to good advantage, and that is part of her power of attraction). The breeds of women never stop working, day and night, summer and winter. Aphrodite endows her with the charis that makes Semonides' queen bee so attractive, and arouses 'painful desire, the cares that gnaw limbs' (Hesiod, Works and Days 60-6); and then she has garlands, spring flowers and gold necklaces. A bride ... that's the good part, but the ill is still to come, which in divine terms means that Hermes has yet to intervene. He gives a name to this lovely object - she will be Pandora he adds speech and pours into her 'a shameless mind, a deceitful heart'. It is exactly that which brings Pandora into Zeus' scheme, the 'deep trap, with no way out, destined for humans'. Then, naively, trusting in divine plans and realizations, Epimetheus, the brother of Prometheus, accepts as his wife the good- what is on the surface- 'and, when he suffers his misfortune, he understands.' After Pandora has lifted the cover of the box, leaving nothing but hope inside it, 'innumerable sorrows were released among men: the earth and the sea are full of evils! ... There is no way of escaping Zeus' schemes' (Hesiod,Works and Days 101--4).\n\n16. 17.\n\nOn two occasions: the myth of Pandora's birth is evoked in expected fashion in the Theogony (lines 570-612) and also in Works and Days (lines 53-105). Following other lines of thinking, Aristotle would later say the same thing (p. 89).\n\n36\n\nWomen of Ancient Greece\n\nEpiphany of Pandora. The first woman is depicted inanodos (emerging from earth), with a diadem and partly veiled, like a nymph; above, an Eros, then Epimetheus, her 'husband', who welcomes her, hammer in hand. Then comes Hermes, who looks at Zeus but goes towards Pandora to breathe the 'deceiving words' into her. Ashmolean Museum, Oxford\n\nWOMAN -AS-SNARE Primordial woman was hollow, and in that empty space lay the trap. Her seductiveness was blindingly obvious. Aphrodite and the deities in her train: Charites, 18 Persuasion and other wearers of garlands and roguish smiles, all carried charis and desire to their apogee. Like that of the 'longmaned mare', this desirable body is the trap into which the husband swoons and is swallowed up. We can easily follow this line of thought but, on the other hand, from the cultural distance at which we find ourselves, we see less clearly how the absence of know-how in the textile field is a handicap to the attractions of primordial woman. Are we to imagine a symbolic and magical construction which likens the fabric woven to the net cast by the woman over the man she covets? Or are we to think that in the archaic\n\n18.\n\nA group of three feminine divinities, personifying 'grace.'\n\nThe feminine and the sacred\n\n37\n\npoets' view of woman the 'economic' element (what she costs, what she brings in) is a determining factor, because having a mediocre weaver for a wife condemns you to wearing only poor-quality garments. To give an account of how Pandora's snare works, Hesiod too uses the metaphor of the hive but looks on the black side, in a scenario with altered roles. Women are now identified with the drones which, lurking in the depths of the beehive, stuff themselves (compare this with Semonides' sowwoman who 'grows fat') on the wealth produced by others. Who? Those who, 'without respite, bustle around every day until sunset' (Hesiod, Theogony 596), those on the outside: men. While they go round about the hive and wear themselves out with toil, the feminine, 19 personified in these drone-parasites, 'stores up in (her) belly the fruit of other people's toil' (Hesiod, Theogony 599). The female does not manage to tame the appetite of this disturbing parasitic belly, she lacks the firmness of soul necessary to be able to adjust to 'hateful poverty'. Conversely, that virtue which sits so well on the poor prevades Greek morality, from Bias, one of the mythical Seven Sages, for whom 'the unfortunate is he who cannot endure misfortune' (Diogenes Laertius i. 5), up to the classical era, when it was considered an honour for the wife to 'bear adversity'. For the Hesiodic wife, 'nothing but plenty' will do. It is from within that the trap shows itself to be most effective. Once in place, the woman 'devours the \"house\"' (Hesiod, Works and Days 704) in the heart of which she is installed. This image of the woman 'always on the look-out for the table' (Hesiod, Works and Days 375) (cf. the sow-, she-assand earth-woman), the parasite on the 'house', is common in Hesiodic poetry. The creature that the peasant has brought into his home is only after his barn, and the poet adds his maxim: 'He who trusts a woman, trusts thieves' (Hesiod, Works and Days 373). Man experiences physically the destructive effect of the insatiable feminine appetite. To live with a woman is to invite in famine, that odious companion, and also to risk one's health in more ways than one. She uses arguments that are impossible to fight against, too easily does he lose the sense of his own interests in the presence of the 'dolled-up rump' of a woman (the mare-woman, Pandora), and moreover she is so eager for intercourse that 'however vigorous he is, he wears himself to a shadow' (Hesiod, Works and Days 705). In ancient Greece, as often elsewhere, eating and copulating were all one. Living in the\n\n19.\n\nAn obviously strange kind of feminine for anyone who knows a little biology: when it comes to the queen, it is hard to find anything more female that she in the hive, whereas the drones are male; only the very interior position of the queen bee perfectly suits the Hesiodic metaphor. The hive will also pose problems for Aristotle (see pp. 78-9).\n\n38\n\nWomen of Ancient Greece\n\ncompany of the mouth-woman or vagina-woman, man loses all his peace, then all his substance. For Zeus, the fact of having sent upon men an evil that is beautiful completely changes the nature of the punishment, which is not temporary but permanent; the attraction which woman continues to exert in fact guarantees the enduring quality of the trap laid by Zeus. Man will go so far as to love what costs him so much and brings him so many misfortunes. In order to avoid the 'disastrous anxieties brought by women' and escape the perpetual snare, the solution would be to do without. But that would be quite another story. Of course, he who does not take a wife into his home 'does not go short of bread'. This is a refrain which is taken up by numerous later misogynistic writings: the father says, a daughter eats, a daughter costs; the husband says, a wife eats ... Daughterless, wifeless, our man is thus better fed and wealthier. But he cannot live by bread alone, he also worries about the future of his possessions. Certainly, 'while he lives', he wants for nothing but 'as soon as he is dead, his assets are shared among the relatives' (Hesiod, Theogony 606). And this leads to the disappearance of the capital on which his 'house' is based. The prospect for his lineage is suicidal (with the subsequent concerns: who will take care of his burial?). If he marries, he knows there is little likelihood of winning the bee 'in the lottery of marriage' (Hesiod, Theogony 219), 'but even so, all his life he (will see) the bad countering the good'. In the contrary, and most frequent case, he must expect 'to bear in his breast a sorrow that will never leave either his soul or his heart, and his ill (will be) without remedy.' A moral Susarion would later proclaim, 'Fellow-citizens ... women are an evil; and yet my companions ... it is impossible to live without that evil; for whether we marry or not, they are still an evil' (Susarion, fr. 1 K-A) .20 It is but a small step from the Hesiodic Pandora to the animal-women of Semonides. They represent the same overall, common and 'vernacular' idea of the feminine. Regarding women, the case is open and shut: a wink of complicity between men is enough for them to agree in the"
