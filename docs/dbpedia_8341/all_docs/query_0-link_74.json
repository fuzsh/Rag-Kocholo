        "text": "Thucydides was very popular among Roman rhetoricians and historians of the first century bce. The Greek critic Dionysius of Halicarnassus, however, criticizes Thucydides for his unnatural style and his inappropriate treatment of subject matter. This chapter explains Dionysius’ criticisms by taking into account the later writer’s rhetorical perspective on the writing of history, as well as the character of his Roman audience, which included the addressee of the treatise, the historian Quintus Aelius Tubero. Dionysius’ criticisms of Thucydides’ anti-Athenian attitude ( Letter to Pompeius 3.15), and his apparently conflicting praise (On Thucydides 8.1) of Thucydides’ commitment to the truth can be reconciled if we take into account Dionysius’ concept of “truth,” his intended audience, and his rhetorical concept of historiography.\n\nThis chapter examines Thucydides’ digression about the tyrannicides, with which the historian questions the Athenians’ memory of Harmodius and Aristogeiton, and explains the truth about the tyrannicides and the Peisistratids. The point that is put forward is that Thucydides, in interrupting with this digression his account about Alcibiades’ involvement in the case of the Herms, not only to criticizes the flaws of his compatriots’ collective memory about the tyrannicides, but he also conveys the message that the story of Harmodius and Aristogeiton was intentionally distorted by politicians and demagogues in their speeches against Alcibiades in the Assembly and in court. Thucydides’ emphasis on the institutional and rhetorical context within which the tyrannicides were evoked as democratic symbols at the expense of Alcibiades’ alleged plan to overthrow democracy emerges from specific verbal choices. The surviving works of 4th-century oratory which refer to the tyrannicides prove that in the Assembly and court the Athenians referred to Harmodius and Aristogeiton in an idealizing fashion, which leads to the conclusion that Thucydides, by offering an account which belied the established idealized image of Harmodius and Aristogeiton, thus wishes, inter alia, to highlight historiography’s superiority over oratory in terms of the degree of validity with which each genre contributed to the preservation of historical truth.\n\nThe possibility that Thucydides might have used Aristophanes as an aide-mémoire was dismissed as “bizarre” by the late Sir Kenneth Dover; this paper is intended to challenge such a view. For there are numerous occasions when the historian (in exile from Athens 424–404) seems to have employed the comic poet in order to refresh his memory. At Knights 128–145, a slave describes Athens’ recent political history in terms of a progression from a “hemp-monger” via “sheepdealer” to a “tanner”, generally identified with Eucrates, Lysicles and Cleon. There are numerous indications, both large and small, that lock in an identification of the next “seller” in the list, namely the “Sausage-seller”), with Alcibiades. The speeches of both the Sausage-seller and Alcibiades in Thucydides are characterized by a frequent use of καί (“and”) to begin sentences, reflecting Alcibiades’ energetic, impatient, and breathless manner. Another clear case of Thucydidean dependence on an Aristophanic model that can be supported statistically is to be found in his account (II,47–54) of the symptoms of the plague of Athens. It would appear that Thucydides had a checklist which he followed to the letter, in the form of the bed-bug scene at Clouds 694–745 which is a parody of one suffering from the plague,and it is striking that the phenomena occur in the same order in both texts. In Acharnians we can perhaps see in the Acharnians’ assertion that Spartans stand by “neither βωμός (‘altar’), nor πίστις (‘trust’), nor ὅρκος (‘oath’)” the seeds of Thucydides’ invention. Peace seems to have provided further material for Thucydides, in the language used byHermes to describe the deserted Olympus; it anticipates the expressions Thucydides uses for the relocation of many inhabitants of Attica at the beginning of the Peloponnesian War. Then, the very last, abrupt, sentence in Thucydides’ Histories has its origin in the closing scene of Thesmophoriazusae; when the Aristophanic aide-mémoire he was using ceased to function, he stopped writing."
