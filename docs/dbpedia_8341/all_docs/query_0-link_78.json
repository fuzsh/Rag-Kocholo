        "text": "General information on Pericles\n\nPericles was a prominent statesman, politician, orator and general of Athens in the 5th century BC, during the city's so-called Golden Age(period also named after him:Age of Pericles). He was a member (through his mother) of one of the most prominent and famous families in Athens: Alcmaeonidae.\n\nHe had such a deep influence on his city that the great historian who wrote about this period, Thucydides, named him \"First man of Athens\" eventhough he officially only held a position of strategos, yearly electorial office, which he shared with 9 other men (there was still at this period no great distinction between political and army leaders, so public officials often held both positions).\n\nHe was a great promoter of arts and literature. During his \"reign\", ambitious projects were started all across Athens under his supervision, building some of the finest architectural and sculptural pieces of art we still admire today, like Parthenon and the works of Phidias (his great friend). Money for these works was provided from the treasure of Delian League (which was intended solely for equipment of ships and it's crews, in the form of payments from Athenian subjects in order to avoid sending men for the defence of the League), which Pericles had moved from the island of Delos to Athens.\n\nHe also further promoted democratic institutions (along with another politican, Ephialtes, Pericles's mentor, who was assasinated in 461 BC), by reducing power of the Areopagus, which was considered a stronghold of conservatism and one of the last remnants of aristocratical power, AND introducing payment for some of the public offices.\n\nIn 462/461 BC, with the assasination of Ephialtes, and the ostracism of Cimon,a leading general and statesman of 470s and 460s, he became his city's most prominent political figure.\n\nPericles and his role in Peloponnesian War\n\nPericles was, generally speaking, as far as foreign policy goes, a conservative (454 BC embezzlement nothwistanding, one of the greatest such acts in history). Stopping any further conquests and subjugations while war with Spartans was still on was, in his opinion, the most important condition for the victory.\n\nHowerer, at the same time, it cannot be denied that (even disregarding all the wars of Athens from 461-433 BC, and there were LOTS of them), he did everything possible to make war with Sparta inevitable, in economic, diplomatic and military terms alike. If there is one single man who can be attributed to have started Peloponnesian War the most, it's Pericles.\n\nFirst,there is no doubt that a political expert of the scale of Pericles would have seen that, sooner or latter, assuming the Athenian rate of progress from the 440s and 430s continues, the major and decisive war for supremacy over the 2 blocks of power would ensue. Athens was growing more powerful every month. By the early 430s Athens and her Delian League had, by all standards, left Sparta and her Peloponnesian League behind in terms of economic and political might. Every passing year would make that gap ever wider. If Sparta wanted to win, it had to declare war sooner, rather than latter, or Athens would be just too powerful to be stopped. It is in that regard analogue to WWI and Germany (also applicable in military terms, since both Sparta and Germany had superior military, but were inferior in resources and economy).\n\nPericles was aware of this, and every legislature he passed ,every law he put through, had the same overall purpose (in foreign policy). Namely, to increase Athens's economy while at the same time put pressure on Spartan one. He was obviously a man who had a much higher opinion and regard for economical power and might, than for the military one (that is not to say that he thought military methods useless, or that he didn't used them, of course).\n\nPerfect case in point: Megarian Decree. The textbook example of passing a law in order to put pressure on your enemy's \"coffins\". He surely knew that, within a few years (at most) from such an act, Spartans would no longer be able to take it. In my view, it was probably a greater cause for war (cassus belli) than Corinth later supporting Potidaea, or the Athenians being present at the Battle of Sybota. After all, it was officially for this decree that Spartans later sent their ultimatum concerning Alcmaeonidae.\n\nAnd it very obvious why he choose this particular city to stangle into submission. Besides Megara being one of the most richest of Sparta's subjects (besides Corinth), it was very close to Athens. It could serve as an excellent staging point for invasions into Attica (which was a main Spartan strategy at the beggining of the war). With such wealth, they could easily have kept a Peloponnesian army supplied while they were deep in enemy territory, and Pericles' degree would all but ensure that they were not in a position to provide this support.\n\nThere was potentially another reason why Pericles decided not to be the one who will declare war, and begin open hostilities. And that was the leverage with Persians.\n\nWe have already established Pericles was an all-round political genius, who always kept all the possible threads and pieces of foreign and domestic policy in view, and how they would be affected by his actions. So,I propose that he wanted Spartans to be the aggressors, in order to be able to picture them as such to Persians, and discourage them from actively helping them, either monetarely or through manpower and ships. Perhaps he even hoped to be able to persuade them to his side.\n\nBecause Pericles knew, in the all-out war betwen the 2 great factions of Greece, victorius side would be, almost certainly, the one whom Persia (and it's practically limitless resources) supported.\n\nIn order to make sure that Spatans would not take it any more, and declare war, he follows Megarian Decree with Siege of Potidae (assuming that's the sequence of event in that crucial year, 432 BC). In fact, I'm amazed that Spartans waited for the following year to declare war, after those two events (although it is possible that the campaigning season was over by that time,and they had to wait for the next one).\n\nAnd therein lies a problem (and the most intriguing question of this topic, at least for me). Even if we disregard whether or not his war strategy was correct (and majority of historians say that it was not, or alternatively, that it would have been viable only under his direct leadership, thus making it very unstable), the question remains: Was it wise to deliberately provoke a war which, the more time passes by, the better your chances of victory are?\n\nAlkibiades,\n\nGenerally,I agree with the points of nicholas milne,but I would like first to make some observations:\n\nPericles...never had a plan...B in anything;even his perception of Democracy\n\nwas rather short-sighted:nothing illustrates that better than the dialogue/debate between him and his nephew,Alkibiades on the subject of Democracy as it is in the \"Pelican History of Greece\" by A.R.Burn,the formost authority in Ancient Greek History;Alkibiades was then only eighteen and it seems that Pericles would have done a service to Athens if he had left such decisions about war to his nephew twelve years later.\n\nMany Historians believe that the Peloponesian War started in 460 BC and continued on and off until 404 BC and did not in fact start in 431 BC;that 'on and off' was rather due to Sparta's inability to continue hostilities rather than the Athenian's desire for peace...what is the meaning of that? in short,Pericles internal politics and his international policies made the war unavoidable;it is made patently obvious that the cooperation between Cimon and Pericles in the decade of the fifties achieved Sparta's military and financial exhaustion and especially after the burning of the Lacedaemonian shipyards in the coast of Gytheion Sparta was,apart from physically,psychologically defeated and hastilly sued for peace.Pericles consented although he knew that Athens would not be able to maintain the peace for long;why? due to the short sighted changes he had made(along with that ..... extremist Ephialtes) to the Athenian constitution.\n\nThe changes effected in 458 BC provided that Athenian citizenship could be claimed as of a right by anyone who had both parents Athenian citizens!(so it was thus...aligned with the Spartan law of citizenship!) so,with one stroke of the pen(or stylus if you like) if Themistocles and Miltiades had been born after 458 BC,they couldn't have been Athenian citizens!...\n\nThat new law gave a lot of power to the lower classes and of course the majority vote in the assembley;where was the Athenian poor earning his living? in the public offices and,mainly,by rowing the ships of the Athenian fleets.So long as Pericles would keep them employed in great works in Athens they were controlled but after? they were looking for every opportunity\n\nto row the triremes,something that gave them a sense of power and superiority in the Aegean and not only...in other words we have a warmongering proletariat which would vote anything in Pnyx so long as the two obols a day kept flowing...\n\n(the above law spelled through the time the weakening of Athens,compare populations in 5th and late 4th century Athens)\n\nPericles developed a concept of High Strategy that touches on that level Politics of War,that didn't foresee an end to the war other than Spartan financial exaustion(coupled with his own longvity-a classic hair-brained scheme detached from reality completely due to his advanced age)...on the other hand his nephew Alcibiades conceived a movement that would put him astride the line of communications of the Peloponnesian alliance,cut the wherewithal of Peloponnese from its Sicilian corn shipments and its Sicilian allies by destroying of subjugating them...a rare ingenuity daring that appeared in the European battlefields 2200 years later introduced by Napoleon;the difference was that Alcibiades move was of Imperial proportions and on the High Strategy level and not confined to the tactics of a battlefield...\n\nThe Persian Factor\n\nThe Persians Alcibiades were not waiting to side with the winner;they had signed few years previously the Peace of Callias ending fifty years that piled defeat upon defeat after Salamis to the Persians and Phoenicians in the hands of the Delian League armies and fleets;they dindn't have any national suicidal tendencies;only one factor would allow them to re-enter the Aegean and re-attempt a conquest or control of Greece:a defeat of the Athenian fleet.\n\nPericles internal politics and his international policies made the war unavoidable;\n\nI am curious to know what you are referring to here. Not that I am necessarily disagreeing, but would like to know your thoughts on it, in more detail.\n\nit is made patently obvious that the cooperation between Cimon and Pericles in the decade of the fifties\n\nThey only cooperated for 1 year, from Cimon' return from exile in 451, until his death in 450. Most of the damage Sparta sustained in the First Peloponnesian War (both physical and psychological) was prior to that, when Pericles was the unquestioned leader of the city.\n\nphysically,psychologically defeated and hastilly sued for peace.Pericles consented although he knew that Athens would not be able to maintain the peace for long;why? due to the short sighted changes he had made(along with that ..... extremist Ephialtes) to the Athenian constitution.\n\nFirst, they only signed a 4-month truce upon Cimon's return, which was subsequently lengthened to 5 years. The first real peace came in 446, after Athens, and not Sparta, suffered terrible reverses.\n\nSecond, I am interested in what prompts you to characterize Ephialtes as \"..... extremist\".\n\nThe changes effected in 458 BC provided that Athenian citizenship could be claimed as of a right by anyone who had both parents Athenian citizens!(so it was thus...aligned with the Spartan law of citizenship!) so,with one stroke of the pen(or stylus if you like) if Themistocles and Miltiades had been born after 458 BC,they couldn't have been Athenian citizens!...\n\nThat new law gave a lot of power to the lower classes and of course the majority vote in the assembley;where was the Athenian poor earning his living? in the public offices and,mainly,by rowing the ships of the Athenian fleets.So long as Pericles would keep them employed in great works in Athens they were controlled but after? they were looking for every opportunity\n\nto row the triremes,something that gave them a sense of power and superiority in the Aegean and not only...in other words we have a warmongering proletariat which would vote anything in Pnyx so long as the two obols a day kept flowing...\n\nSome very good points, but you are also oversimplifying things. There were very strong social and economic reasons for implementing the law of citizenship. Namely, most of the wealthy and well-to-do (basically the first three of the four classes of citizens, according to Solon' legislation) citizens were marrying foreign ....., because it was economically and politically highly advantageous to them to do so. So, it was for the sake of Athenian ..... that Pericles proposed that law, so that they wont remain un-married. Whether the advantages outweighed the drawbacks, or vice versa, I wont argue.\n\nAdditionally, its not like Athenian citizens had nothing to do for a living. Many were being employed as workers by wealthy merchants and craftsmen of all kind. However, you are generally right about citizens relying too much on state to provide them with money.\n\nOh, and Pericles' citizenship law was passed in 451, not in 458.\n\nThe Persians Alcibiades were not waiting to side with the winner;they had signed few years previously the Peace of Callias ending fifty years that piled defeat upon defeat after Salamis to the Persians and Phoenicians in the hands of the Delian League armies and fleets;they dindn't have any national suicidal tendencies;only one factor would allow them to re-enter the Aegean and re-attempt a conquest or control of Greece:a defeat of the Athenian fleet.\n\nYou are right that it was Athenian navy that kept Persia out of the war for the first 19 years. But I wasn't arguing that Persia \"waited to side with the winner\". My argument is that they were hoping to play one off against the other, so that both could be as exhausted as possible.\n\nThe parts of your posts I didn't quote I largely agree with.\n\nI am curious to know what you are referring to here.

My argument is that they were hoping to play one off against the other, so that both could be as exhausted as possible.\n\nThe parts of your posts I didn't quote I largely agree with.\n\n1) The ostracism of Cimon,the laws restricting the jurisdiction of Areopagus(Areios Pagos) and the other populist laws that made him a virtual dictator of Athens(Thucidides writes\"In name democracy,in essence one man's rule\"...eloquent!) giving the right to Sparta to propound the freedom of Greece against Athenian 'tyranny' and as a result anyone of the Athenian allies staging a revolt had previously asked the help of Sparta!\n\nthe Megarian decree that hit mainly Sparta albeit indirectly (a very foolish move) reminded me the Maritime dogma of Cromwell...\n\n2) That crucial time 451/450 helped the Athenian fleet to invade Cyprus and in its return(carrying Cimon's dead body back to Athens) destroy completely the Phoenician fleet that disappears from the Mediterranean for quite some time;an obvious result of that was the total control of south eastern Mediterranean by the Athenian squadrons which must have made Sparta realize that in the event of war,supplies from sister cities in that part would be blocked so greater reliance on the allies in the west.\n\n3)It wasn't exactly peace(in 445 BC-&#963;&#960;&#959;&#957;&#948;&#945;&#953;=armistice-religious obligation to refrain from hostilities)\n\nI don't understand your term first \"Peloponnesian War\" since it is not Thucidides term and I noticed also mentioned in Wikipedia somwhere(not that I take notice of it) but I don't see it in the Historians(Hammond,Bury&Meiggs,Burn,etc) and not \"terrible reverses\" the deafeat in Boetia-not very significant-it cut the way for Athens to central Greece,but Athens couldn't maintain both Continental and sea dominance at the same time....\n\n4) Ephialtes proposed Laws had as a result the complete dominance of his party in Athens to the almost disappearance of opposition turning Athens into the hands of Pericles,an unproclaimed dictator...not a favourable view of Athens in the eyes of Greece at that time!\n\nSo,that far reaching Law of Citizenship was enacted to secure marriages for the Athenian...maidens? I have heard that...now as a far reaching policy it is not an argument for a Head of State signing the eventual death of an Imperial city...\n\nMarrying foreign ..... was also a matter of state policy and to the advantage of Athens as the marriage of Miltiades proved...and what where the economic reasons\n\n(sorry,I don't see any 'social' reasons,I take the argument about Athenian ..... as a generality and exaggeration!)\n\nNow,where do you see the \"oversimplification\"? the argument above your contention is supported by other writers like Bury& Meiggs for example...\n\nThat Athenians had some other occupations is irrelevant because it is expected,\n\nwhat is relevant is that the majority who voted in Pnyx were rowing the warships.\n\nCount that 300 triremes(all the Athenian squadrons at that time) needed 60000 men...and that makes a majority in Pnyx!\n\nI remember I once had much the same views as you did, Cimon (about the time that I joined this site). In the meantime, I read much more about these subjects, and came to know more.\n\nPS:I know the above sounds terribly arrogant and condescending. I am sorry for that, but its just how I see this issue. Please don't take offence, since it is not meant as such!\n\n1) The ostracism of Cimon,the laws restricting the jurisdiction of Areopagus(Areios Pagos) and the other populist laws that made him a virtual dictator of Athens(Thucidides writes\"In name democracy,in essence one man's rule\"...eloquent!)\n\nFirst, that's a misleading rendition of what Thucydides said. What he said was \"in name democracy, but in reality a rule of the first citizen\". Thucydides was oversimplifying the situation.\n\nSecond, those same laws which made Pericles so popular, and which provided him with so much unofficial (it is crucial to stress that) power, also made him extremely and perpetually vulnerable and ALWAYS just one angry assembly meeting away from a complete disgrace and political \"destruction\". All of Pericles' power rested on his ability to persuade the assembly to agree with his views. Bring the general public to question his reputation, character and/or judgament (and his opponents had plenty of both official and unofficial methods of doing that), and all of his vaunted \"powers\" are gone.\n\nNow, that doesn't sound to me like your typical \"dictator\" (with all its strong connotations), now does it? In fact, it doesn't sound like any dictator recorded in history, no matter how benevolent.\n\nto giving the right to Sparta to propound the freedom of Greece against Athenian 'tyranny' and as a result anyone of the Athenian allies staging a revolt had previously asked the help of Sparta!\n\nSpartans had only started to play the card \"freedom for the Greeks\" in the Second Peloponnesian War (the great one). I don't need to tell you it was just propaganda and empty talk.\n\nBut more importantly, it wasn't any ideology or perceived mistakes of Athens that \"allowed\" the enemies of Athens to seek help from Sparta. That was just power-politics and logic. Sparta was the only other great power in Greece, and it was natural that anyone who was dissatisfied with Athens (and there would always be those, no matter how \"light\" Athenian rule may have been) will always try their luck with Sparta. Nothing Athens could do would stop those people from at least TRYING to get Sparta to go to war with Athens.\n\nthe Megarian decree that hit mainly Sparta albeit indirectly (a very foolish move) reminded me the Maritime dogma of Cromwell...\n\nIt didn't hit mainly Sparta. It hit mainly Megara.\n\nBut you are right, it was also intended to destabilize Megara, and to gain the city (which would have a crucial advantage of gaining control of the Isthmus to Athenians, which would, in turn, prevent Sparta from getting out of Peloponnese).\n\n2) That crucial time 451/450 helped the Athenian fleet to invade Cyprus and in its return(carrying Cimon's dead body back to Athens) destroy completely the Phoenician fleet that disappears from the Mediterranean for quite some time;an obvious result of that was the total control of south eastern Mediterranean by the Athenian squadrons which must have made Sparta realize that in the event of war,supplies from sister cities in that part would be blocked so greater reliance on the allies in the west.\n\nDo you mean Cyrenaica?\n\nAnd yes, your analysis is right, but what I was pointing at in the quote to which you answered with the above is that most of the damage SPARTA (and not any others) suffered in the First Peloponnesian War (461-446) came before 451. Nothing you said negates that.\n\n3)It wasn't exactly peace(in 445 BC-&#963;&#960;&#959;&#957;&#948;&#945;&#953;=armistice-religious obligation to refrain from hostilities)\n\nYes, it was. It is known as a Thirty Years Peace, and we even have its charter preserved.\n\nI don't understand your term first \"Peloponnesian War\" since it is not Thucidides term\n\nMost historians nowadays use that term to distinguish the conflict between Sparta and Athens that raged from 461 until 446, from the one (the more famous one) that lasted from 431 till 404. The only alternative to naming them thus (First and Second) is just to call them both \"Peloponnesian War\" (not something scholars do, giving the exact same name to two different events), or to pretend that they were one continuous conflict. But that would be just that, pretension. They were not continuous, if for nothing else, because there was an official and relatively long-lasting (as these things went in ancient Greece) peace between them.\n\nand not \"terrible reverses\" the deafeat in Boetia-not very significant-it cut the way for Athens to central Greece,but Athens couldn't maintain both Continental and sea dominance at the same time...\n\nVery significant, irrespective of whether it was realistic of Athenians to hold on to those possessions (and I agree with you that it was not). They lost all of Central Greece, giving Sparta again the means to leave Peloponnese by land route, and giving them back one of their crucial allies, Thebes.\n\n4) Ephialtes proposed Laws had as a result the complete dominance of his party in Athens to the almost disappearance of opposition turning Athens into the hands of Pericles,an unproclaimed dictator...not a favourable view of Athens in the eyes of Greece at that time!\n\nToo simplistic (and even one-sided) view of Ephialtes, again. As for Pericles, see above.\n\nMarrying foreign ..... was also a matter of state policy and to the advantage of Athens as the marriage of Miltiades proved\n\nSome of them. But not all of the males of the propertied class (and the situation with Miltiades was pretty much unique, as you know; he was a tyrant ruling over non-Athenian, local population, and he did not live in Athens). There were social and economic issues at stake that simply made that a disastrous course to pursue (at least from the point of view of Athenians of the 5th century), irrespective of whether you accept those claims as legitimite or not.\n\nWho do you imagine Athenian ..... coming from rich and well-born families would marry, if almost all the men from those same classes married rich and noble foreigners?\n\nAlcibiades,\n\nArrogance is allowed,it is a human trait and I never felt humble enough to accuse others of it!so don't apologize for it...\n\nThe point is that I have taught the subject on college level,and then in Military History(my inclination) and many courses of action I judge them by results,I have read what I was to read and closed my term on what was interesting there and I came up with conclusions exactly opposite to yours which I consider similar to those of my teachers whose views I had to reject one after the other since reality forced me to do so.So I will answer in different order your arguments in order of importance and since you\n\nwe are speaking about war,that is what we are going to talk about:\n\n1)The great personalities that were Athenians and elevated Athens to prominence were closing their circle,the last of these great men was Cimon and not Pericles.None of these great people agreed with Spartan policies and practices,but none wanted to confront Sparta as their ultimate solution to the supremacy of Athens...there was always a respect that the supremacy of Sparta generated and an understanding that there was plenty of room for both.Pericles thought different,he saw that Sparta must be eliminated at all costs;that was his politics of War(Clausevitz);his war politics forced him on a High Strategy course where he engaged DIRECT strategic methods,too obvious to Sparta which,despite its conservative(forced upon her) polices,had to declare war\n\non Athens at a time when Athens was not ready for war due to overextension,dissent with the allies/subjects of her empire enemies in mainland Greece and the great problem of Potidaea unsolved.\n\nPericles followed a defensive strategy that Kagan(and here I fully agree with him!)\n\ncalled it \"wishful thinking\"-I had a good argument about that with prof. Koliopoulos\n\nand I had to side with Kagan on this because Pericles defensive strategy had no clear objectives and defensive success is sterile if not followed by a successive counter attack(see Monte Cassino)(Pericles operations where quite feeble ) that will destroy the enemy or destroy his will to fight.\n\nAlcibiades,\n\nArrogance is allowed,it is a human trait and I never felt humble enough to accuse others of it!so don't apologize for it...\n\nThe point is that I have taught the subject on college level,and then in Military History(my inclination) and many courses of action I judge them by results,I have read what I was to read and closed my term on what was interesting there and I came up with conclusions exactly opposite to yours which I consider similar to those of my teachers whose views I had to reject one after the other since reality forced me to do so.So I will answer in different order your arguments in order of importance and since you\n\nwe are speaking about war,that is what we are going to talk about:\n\n1)The great personalities that were Athenians and elevated Athens to prominence were closing their circle,the last of these great men was Cimon and not Pericles.None of these great people agreed with Spartan policies and practices,but none wanted to confront Sparta as their ultimate solution to the supremacy of Athens...there was always a respect that the supremacy of Sparta generated and an understanding that there was plenty of room for both.Pericles thought different,he saw that Sparta must be eliminated at all costs;that was his politics of War(Clausevitz);his war politics forced him on a High Strategy course where he engaged DIRECT strategic methods,too obvious to Sparta which,despite its conservative(forced upon her) polices,had to declare war\n\non Athens at a time when Athens was not ready for war due to overextension,dissent with the allies/subjects of her empire enemies in mainland Greece and the great problem of Potidaea unsolved.\n\nPericles followed a defensive strategy that Kagan(and here I fully agree with him!)\n\ncalled it \"wishful thinking\"-I had a good argument about that with prof.
