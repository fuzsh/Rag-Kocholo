        "text": "3. Alkia, mother of Herodes Atticus\n\nSeveral Romans living in Greece around this period with the name Vibullius are believed to be relatives of Alkia, Atticus and their son Herodes. Attempts have been made to construct family trees to connect the known individuals.\n\nAlkia is referred to in inscriptions as the wife of Tiberius Claudius Atticus Herodes, who was previously taken to be Herodes Atticus. She was therefore thought to be Herodes' first wife, and believed to have died in childbirth.\n\nSee, for example: Helen McClees, A study of women in Attic inscriptions, pages 9-10 and 16. Columbia University Press, New York, 1920.\n\nThe couple are now seen as his parents. See, for example an inscription IG III 674, on the base of a statue of Alkia dedicated by the tribe Pandionis:\n\nWilhelm Dittenberger (editor), Inscriptiones Graecae, Volume 3, part 1 (Voluminis tertii pars prior), Inscriptiones Atticae aetatis Romanae, No. 674, page 140, but also Addenda et corrigenda, page 499. George Reimer, Berlin, 1878. At the Internet Archive.\n\nThe subject of Herodes' \"first wife\" appears to have disappeared from more recent scholarship, although it is often remarked that he married Regilla at the relatively late age of 40.\n\n4. Philostratus on Herodes Atticus\n\nLucius Flavius Philostratus (ÎÎ¿ÏÎºÎ¹Î¿Ï Î¦Î»Î¬Î²Î¹Î¿Ï Î¦Î¹Î»ÏÏÏÏÎ±ÏÎ¿Ï) is often referred to as Philostratus \"the Athenian\" to distinguish him from other ancient authors named Philostratus. He may have been a member of a family of professional Sophists from the island of Lemnos in the northeastern Aegean. He was a member of the Second Sophistic (ÎÎµÏÏÎµÏÎ± ÏÎ¿ÏÎ¹ÏÏÎ¹ÎºÎ®), a philosophical and cultural movement which flourished from the 1st century AD to around 250 AD. The dates of his life are unknown, but he is thought to have lived between 160/170 and 244/250 AD, and to have studied and taught in Athens before going to live in Rome. It has been suggested that he may have attended a rhetorical performance by Herodes Atticus or even been at his funeral.\n\nThe lives of the Sophists (ÎÎ¯Î¿Î¹ Î£Î¿ÏÎ¹ÏÏÏÎ½), known in Latin as Vitae Sophistarum, is thought to have been written in the 230s or 240s AD, according to other opinions between 231 and 237 AD. The biography of Herodes Atticus appears in the first section of Book II, referred to as Section a or Section 1, depending on the modern edition.\n\nQuotes and references by Philostratus concerning Herodes Atticus and the Odeion are taken from:\n\nPhilostratus and Eunapius; The lives of the Sophists, Philostratus, Book II, chapter 1 (sections 545-566), pages 138-183 (also references to Herodes on following pages and in the introduction). In ancient Greek and English, translated by William Cave Wright. Loeb Classical Library. Heinemann, London and G. P. Putnam's Sons, New York, 1922. At the Internet Archive.\n\nSee also:\n\nJoseph L. Rife, The burial of Herodes Atticus: Ãlite identity, urban society, and public memory in Roman Greece. Journal of Hellenic Studies, Volume 128 (2008), pages 92-127.

To modern readers this may seem more like an uncritical sermon in praise of Herodes Atticus than a historical appraisal of his life and achievements.\n\n5. Inscriptions mentioning Herodes Atticus discovered in the 17th century\n\nJacob Spon and George Wheler, who travelled through Italy to Greece, Constantinople (Istanbul) and the Levant in 1675-1676, recorded discoveries of inscriptions mentioning Herodes Atticus and Annia Regilla, including two found at Rome at the beginning of the 17th century. Wheler provided drawings and translations of two inscriptions from Athens, one dedicated by the tribe of Antiochis (á¼Î½ÏÎ¹Î¿ÏÎ¯Ï) and the other by the demos, for his \"munificence and good will\" respectively \"to his country\" and \"to the city\".\n\nSee: George Wheler, A journey into Greece in the company of Dr Spon of Lyons, Book V, pages 375-377. Cademan, Kettlewell and Churchill, London, 1682. At googlebooks.\n\nThe dedication by the Antiochis tribe was also mentioned in a note to the second edition of Stuart and Revett's The antiquities of Athens.\n\n\"The following inscription, seen at Athens, on a pedestal, which probably bore a statue of him.\n\nThe tribe of Antiochis have\n\ndedicated this to the Priest\n\nof the Caesars, Tiberius Claudius\n\nAtticus Herodes, the Marathonian,\n\non account of his benevolence\n\nand beneficence to his country.\"\n\nJames Stuart and Nicholas Revett, The antiquities of Athens, measured and delineated, Volume II, Chapter III, page 77. Priestley and Weale, London, 1825. At Heidelberg University Digital Library.\n\n6. Cassius Dio on the education of Marcus Aurelius\n\n\"His education was of great assistance to him, for he had been trained both in rhetoric and in philosophical disputation. In the former he had Cornelius Fronto and Claudius Herodes for teachers, and, in the latter, Junius Rusticus and Apollonius of Nicomedeia, both of whom professed Zeno's doctrines.\"\n\nCassius Dio (ÎÎ¯ÏÎ½ ÎÎ¬ÏÏÎ¹Î¿Ï, circa 155-235 AD), Roman History, Book 72, chapter 35, section 1.\n\nAt Bill Thayer's LacusCurtius website, University of Chicago.\n\n7. Herodes Atticus' villa in Kifissia\n\nThe location of Herodes Atticus' estate at Marathon, his home deme, has been identified by a substantial number of architectural remains and archaeological finds. The site of his villa in Kifissia has not yet been discovered, but it is thought to have been near the Pyrna stream (Î· Î ÏÏÎ½Î±) where the portrait bust of Herodes Atticus (see the photo at the top of page) and a bust of Polydeukes (see above) were unearthed in February 1961 in a private garden in Rangavi Street, near the Late Byzantine Panagia Xydou church (Î Î±Î½Î±Î³Î¯Î± ÎÏ Î´Î¿Ï), and where several inscriptions connected with him have been discovered built into churches.\n\nA marble tomb containing four sarcophagi was discovered in September 1866 on Platanos Square (Î Î»Î±ÏÎµÎ¯Î± Î Î»Î±ÏÎ¬Î½Î¿Ï , Plateia Platanou), in the modern centre of Kifissia. The area is thought to have been part of Herodes Atticus' Kifissia estate, and the sarcophagi the graves of four of his six children who died at a young age. An inscription (SEG 26, 290) found built into the nearby Agia Paraskevi church (ÎÎ³Î¯Î± Î Î±ÏÎ±ÏÎºÎµÏ Î®) around the same time appears to confirm this. (The church, used as a mosque, then a barracks, was later demolished; the present Agia Paraskevi chapel was built in 1950.) The epigram depicts Herodes grieving over the death of a three month old infant son, one of three of his children who lie in coffins. This may refer to his sixth child, thought to have been born prematurely at the time of Regilla's death and to have been buried in the only undecorated sarcophagus found in the tomb.\n\ná¼©Ïá½½Î´Î·Ï Î¿á¼³ Ïá½µÎ½Î´Îµ Îºá½¹Î¼Î·Î½ Î¿á½ Ïá½±Î½ÏÎ± á¼Î½Î¹Î±Ï Ïá½¹Î½\n\nÎ¿á½ÏÎµ Îºá½¹Î¼Î·Î½ Î¸Ïá½³ÏÎ±Ï Î¿á½ÏÎµ Ïá½³, ÏÎ±á¿Î´Î± Ïá½·Î»Î¿Î½,\n\nÎ¼Î·Î½á½¶ ÏÏá½·Ïá¿³ ÎºÎµá½·ÏÎ±Ï á½Ïá½¸ ÎºÎµá½»Î¸ÎµÏÎ¹ Î¸á½µÎºÎ±ÏÎ¿ Î³Î±á½·Î·Ï,\n\ná¼©Ïá½½Î´Î·Ï, Î´Îµá½»ÏÎ±Ï á¼ÎºÏÎ± Îºá½¹Î¼Î·Ï Î´á½±ÎºÏÏ ÏÎ¹,\n\nÏá¿Î¼â á¼ÏÏ Î¼Î¿Î½ ÏÎ±á½·Î´ÏÎ½ ÏÏ ÏÎ±á¿Ï ÏÏÎ¹Ïá½·Î½, á½¥Ï ÏÎ¿ÏÎµ Ïá¿¶Î¼Î±\n\nÎ´á½³Î¾ÎµÏÎ¸â á¼Î½ Î¸á½µÎºÎ±Î¹Ï á½Î¼ÎµÏá½³ÏÎ¿Î¹Î¿ ÏÎ±ÏÏá½¹Ï.\n\nHerodes set in the depths of the earth this his lock of hair,\n\nHaving dampened the tips of the hair with his tears,\n\nWhen for less than the cycle of a year\n\nHe had neither grown his hair nor reared you, dear son,\n\nFor he cut this lock in the third month.\n\nMay it be a true token to you three childrens' souls\n\nThat you will someday receive among the coffins the body of your father.\n\nInscription SEG 26:290 at The Packard Humanities Institute.\n\nThe fourth and largest sarcophagus in the tomb, the \"Leda sarcophagus\" (see above), is thought to be Elpinike's. A fragmentary inscription (IG IIÂ² 12568/9, see note 1) found at Kifissia, mentioning Herodes Atticus and Elpinike, and thought to be her epitaph (funerary inscription), appears to confirm that she was buried there.\n\nAthenais is thought to have been granted the unusual right to be buried within the city walls of Athens (Philostratus, The lives of the Sophists, Book II, section 558, see quote above). Atticus Bradua (ÎÏÏÎ¹ÎºÏÏ ÎÏÎ±Î´Î¿ÏÎ±Ï), the only child to outlive his parents, was disinherited by Herodes, and may not have died in Greece.\n\nThe sarcophagi are now displayed in situ in a small, purpose-built building on Plateia Platanou, just east of Kifissia Metro station.\n\nSee: Ellen E.

At googlebooks.\n\nAulus Gellius (circa 125 - after 180 AD), a Latin grammarian who studied in Athens (probably in the 140s AD), one of many wealthy Romans who studied in Greece to attain cultural kudos, wrote about Herodes Atticus' personality and philosophical attitudes in his book Attic nights. He began by describing the luxury and elegance enjoyed by Herodes, his pupils and guests at his Kifissia villa.\n\n\"While we were students at Athens, Herodes Atticus, a man of consular rank and of true Grecian eloquence, often invited me to his country houses near that city, in company with the honourable Servilianus and several others of our countrymen who had withdrawn from Rome to Greece in quest of culture. And there at that time, while we were with him at the villa called Cephisia, both in the heat of summer and under the burning autumnal sun, we protected ourselves against the trying temperature by the shade of its spacious groves, its long, soft promenades, the cool location of the house, its elegant baths with their abundance of sparkling water, and the charm of the villa as a whole, which was everywhere melodious with plashing waters and tuneful birds.\"\n\nAulus Gellius, Attic Nights, Book I, chapter 2.

The Villa of Herodes Atticus at Loukou and the Astros Archaeological Museum\n\nThe site of the Villa of Herodes Atticus (Î· ÎÏÎ±Ï Î»Î· ÏÎ¿Ï ÎÏÏÎ´Î· ÏÎ¿Ï ÎÏÏÎ¹ÎºÎ¿Ï) at Loukou (ÎÎ¿Ï ÎºÎ¿Ï, ancient Eua, ÎÏÎ±), 2.3 km south of Kato Dolia village (ÎÎ¬ÏÏ ÎÎ¿Î»Î¹Î±Î½Î¬), and around 4 km northwest (uphill) of Astros (ÎÏÏÏÎ¿Ï). It is next to the Byzantine Monastery of Loukou (ÎÎµÏÎ¬ ÎÎ¿Î½Î® ÎÎ¿Ï ÎºÎ¿ÏÏ), built in the 10th century AD around an early Christian basilica with stone from Herodes Atticus' estate, over a sanctuary of the heroized physician Polemokratis (Î Î¿Î»ÎµÎ¼Î¿ÎºÏÎ¬ÏÎ·Ï), dated to the late Classical - early Hellenistic period. An early 4th century BC marble votive relief dedicated to Asklepios has been found at the monastery (National Archaeological Museum, Athens, Inv. No. 1402). The sanctuary, probably an Asklepieion healing centre, was mentioned by Pausanias, who visited Eua in the mid 2nd century AD, although he did not mention the villa.\n\n\"As you go from these common graves you come to Athene, where Aeginetans once made their home, another village Neris, and a third Eua, the largest of the villages, in which there is a sanctuary of Polemocrates. This Polemocrates is one of the sons of Machaon, and the brother of Alexanor; he cures the people of the district, and receives honors from the neighbours.\n\nAbove the villages extends Mount Parnon, on which the Lacedaemonian border meets the borders of the Argives and Tegeatae. On the borders stand stone figures of Hermes, from which the name of the place is derived. A river called Tanaus, which is the only one descending from Mount Parnon, flows through the Argive territory and empties itself into the Gulf of Thyrea.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece, Book 2, chapter 38, sections 6-7.\n\nStretching across an area of over 20,000 square metres, Herodes' estate, in which the villa stood, contains a large complex of buildings, including the villa itself, a baths, an aqueduct with two arches, a sanctuary of the Nymphs and a heroon dedicated to Antinous. Finds include over 100 sculptures, several inscriptions, architectural members, mosaics and other artworks.\n\nThe English traveller William Martin Leake visited the Loukou monastery in March 1806, and noted that a large number of high quality sculptures found there were being shipped off elsewhere, used as building material or destroyed (Travels in the Morea, Volume II, chapter XXII, pages 485-494. John Murray, London, 1830). Subsequently other travellers and archaeologists visited the monastery, including members of the French Morea Expedition in 1831, who took ancient artefacts to Aegina (see above). The site of the villa was identified in 1906 by the Greek archaeologist Konstantinos Rhomaios (ÎÏÎ½ÏÏÎ±Î½ÏÎ¯Î½Î¿ Î¡ÏÎ¼Î±Î¯Î¿, 1874-1966) from two inscriptions relating to Herodes Atticus discovered there.\n\nIt was first excavated in 1977-1978 by Georgios Steinhauer (ÎÎµÏÏÎ³Î¹Î¿Ï Î£ÏÎ±ÏÎ½ÏÎ¬Î¿Ï ÎµÏ) and Panagiotis Faklaris (Î Î±Î½Î±Î³Î¹ÏÏÎ·Ï Î. Î¦Î¬ÎºÎ»Î±ÏÎ·Ï), who published the first findings. Since then excavations have been undertaken by Dr Theodoros Spyropoulos 1979-2002, Alkmini Stavridis 1984-1987 and 1989, and Dr George Spyropoulos 1990-2002.\n\nArchaeological excavations at Loukou have been continuing over recent years, although with limited resources. The continuation of the work there is largely thanks to the commitment and enthusiasm of Theodoros Spyropoulos, head of archaeological services in the Peloponnese, and local people.\n\nSee an excellent short video in English about the Villa of Herodes Atticus and the Archaeological Museum of Astros, including an interview with archaeologist Theodoros Spyropoulos. Miracle in Arcadia, Carmen Films, 2014:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=jqQFyaLRWEY at YouTube. 8 minutes 46 seconds.\n\nFinds from the site are now in the Archaeological Museum of Astros (ÎÏÏÎ±Î¹Î¿Î»Î¿Î³Î¹ÎºÏ ÎÎ¿Ï ÏÎµÎ¯Î¿ ÎÏÏÏÎ¿Ï Ï), many are in a storeroom at the site itself, and others are in the Tripolis Archaeological Museum and the National Archaeological Museum, Athens.\n\nAlthough closed for several years, the Astros museum and the archaeological site at Loukou can be visited by prior appointment with the Ephorate of Antiquities of Arkadia in Tripoli. For contact e-mail address and telephone number, see:\n\nArchaeological Museum of Astros at odysseus.culture.gr, the Greek Ministry of Culture website.\n\nTwo short catalogues of locally found sculptures in the Astros museum were written in Greek the 1990s by the archaeologist Alkmini Datsoulis-Stavridis (ÎÎ»ÎºÎ¼Î®Î½Î· ÎÏÎ±ÏÏÎ¿ÏÎ»Î·-Î£ÏÎ±Ï ÏÎ¯Î´Î·). The contents and illustrations of the two books are about the same, and they include only a small selection of the works in the Astros museum's collection (some now in Tripolis and Athens), but they provide a good introduction to the archaeology of the area, particularly with reference to finds connected with Herodes Atticus.\n\nPDFs of the the catalogues (in Greek) can be downloaded from the ÎÎ¹Î²Î»Î¹Î¿Î¸Î®ÎºÎ· (Library) page of the website of the Zafeiris Foundation of Astros: www.zafeiris.gr/zafeiris_003.htm.\n\nÎÎ»ÎºÎ¼Î®Î½Î· ÎÏÎ±ÏÏÎ¿ÏÎ»Î·-Î£ÏÎ±Ï ÏÎ¯Î´Î·, ÎÎ»Ï ÏÏÎ¬ Î±ÏÏ ÏÎ·Î½ ÎÏ ÏÎµÎ¬ÏÎ¹Î´Î± ÎÏ Î½Î¿Ï ÏÎ¯Î±Ï (Alkmini Datsoulis-Stavridis, Sculptures from Thyreatida Kinouria).

No. 173) was found in 1977 at the Villa of Herodes Atticus, near Loukou, and the torso of a sitting statue of Antinous was discovered there in September 1996. Both are in the Archaeological Museum of Astros [see note 8].\n\nHerodes Atticus built the sanctuary of Isis and Osiris on a man-made islet at the edge of the small marsh of Brexiza (ÎÎ¹Î³Ï ÏÏÎ¹Î±ÎºÏ Î¹ÎµÏÏ ÏÏÎ·Î½ ÎÏÏÎµÎ¾Î¯Î¶Î±, the Egyptian Temple at Brexiza), near Marathon, Attica, in which was found an Egyptianizing statue of Antinous as the Egyptian god Osiris. National Archaeological Museum, Athens. Egyptian Collection. Inv. No. 1. It has been pointed out that the face of this statue does not resemble other portraits of Antinous, and it has been suggested that it may represent one of the adopted sons of Herodes Atticus, perhaps Achilles or Polydeukes.\n\n10. Portrait bust of Herodes Atticus\n\nThis is one of the best preserved portraits of Herodes Atticus. Another is also a draped bust, dated around 161 AD, found in 1789 by Louis-FranÃ§ois SÃ©bastien Fauvel in a tomb at Probalinthos (Î ÏÎ¿Î²Î¬Î»Î¹Î½Î¸Î¿Ï) near Marathon, now in the Louvre. It has been suggested that the tomb may be that of Herodes. Also found there were portrait busts of Marcus Aurelius (Louvre, Inv. No. Ma 1161) and joint emperor Lucius Verus (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, Inv. No. AN 1947.277).\n\nMarble draped bust of Herod Atticus, circa 161 AD.\n\nHeight 62 cm.\n\nLouvre Museum, Paris. Inv. No. 1164 (NIII 2536).\n\n11. Inscription on the Regilla-Tyche statue base in Corinth\n\nLike the other inscribed statue base found at Corinth (see above), the inscription praises Regilla's sophrosyne (ÏÏÏÏÎ¿ÏÏÎ½Î·), a word that has been variously translated as excellence of character and soundness of mind, moderation, prudence, chastity ... It addresses Regilla as if she was Tyche and states that the statue was set up in front of a sanctuary, which has been taken to be that of Tyche.\n\nAlthough the base has been dated around 143-160/161 AD, during Regilla's lifetime or shortly after her death, the quality of the lettering has been described as \"decadent\", \"slipshod\" and \"clumsy\" *, which would have been unacceptable to Herodes Atticus. The inscription has thus been dated to the mid 3rd century AD or later, which has led to suggestions that the base was reinscribed and the monument maintained long after the deaths of Regilla and Herodes.\n\n[á¿¬Î·Î³á½·Î»Î»Î±Ï Ï]á½¹Î´â á¼Î³Î±Î»Î¼Î±.

Letters written by Marcus Aurelius and Marcus Cornelius Fronto\n\nLike Herodes, Marcus Cornelius Fronto had been a tutor of Marcus Aurelius [see note 6]. The two men had been adversaries but later became friends. As a closing remark in a letter written (perhaps around 143-144 AD) to Fronto, Marcus Aurelius informs him of Herodes' overwhelming grief at the death of a son. Since the death occurred on the day the letter was written, it seems that Herodes and Regilla were in Rome at this time.\n\n\"The son of Herodes, born today, is dead. Herodes is overwhelmed with grief at his loss. I wish you would write him quite a short letter appropriate to the occasion. Fare ever well.\"\n\nA letter written by Fronto appears to be to Herodes as a consolatio (letter of consolation) in response to Marcus Aurelius' request.\n\nCharles Reginald Haines (editor), The correspondence of Marcus Cornelius Fronto with Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, Lucius Verus, Antoninus Pius, and various friends, Volume 1 (of 2), Marcus Aurelius to Fronto page 162, Fronto to Herodes pages 169-170.

Triopas\n\nAs is often the case in Greek mythography, the accounts by ancient authors concerning the mythical Thessalian hero Triopas (Î¤ÏÎ¯ÏÏ or Î¤ÏÎ¹ÏÏÎ±Ï, Three Faces) and his genealogy vary considerably. According to some he was son of Poseidon and Kanake, and founded Knidos, Caria (Diodorus, 5.57.6 and 5.61.2), where the city's island Triopion (today the DatÃ§a peninsula) was named after him, and where there was a famous sanctuary of Demeter (see the \"Demeter of Knidos\" statue). Either he or his son Erysichthon (ÎÏÏ ÏÎ¯ÏÎ¸ÏÎ½, Earth Tearer) desecrated the sanctuary of Demeter and was punished by the goddess with insatiable hunger and by being plagued by a snake. Eventually Demeter transformed him and the snake into the constellation Ophiuchus (á½ÏÎ¹Î¿á¿¦ÏÎ¿Ï, Ophiouchos, Serpent Bearer *) as a reminder to others of his crime and punishment. Herodes Atticus may also have chosen the name Triopion as a warning to trespassers and thieves.\n\nPausanias reported that the Knidians set up a statue of Triopas, \"founder of Knidos\", with a horse at Delphi. Pausanias, Description of Greece, Book 10, chapter 11, section 1. At Perseus Digital Library.\n\n* One of many myths to explain the origin of this constellation. Others associated it with Apollo, Asklepios and Laocoon.\n\n14.

See:\n\nWilhelm Dittenberger (editor), Inscriptiones Graecae, Volume 3, part 1 (Voluminis tertii pars prior), Inscriptiones Atticae aetatis Romanae, Nos. 664 and 665, page 139. George Reimer, Berlin, 1878. At the Internet Archive.\n\nSome scholars have believed that the inscription refers to an older sister of Atticus (Herodes Atticus' father), also named Claudia Athenais.\n\nPaul Graindor argued that this inscription must refer to Atticus and his older sister (Herodes Atticus' father and aunt), rather than Herodes and his daughter, on the grounds that the Boule of the 600 had been reduced to 500 members by 124/125 AD (\"or 128/9 at the latest\"). He also pointed out that the \"Tib. Claudius Atticus Herodes of Marathon\" in the inscription is described as a high priest of the imperial cult for life, an office held by Atticus until the end of the reign of Hadrian. Referring to the marble slab as a statue base, Graindor wrote: \"If Athenais was supposed to be Atticus' older sister, it is because her statue was placed to the left of his, that is to say, she occupied the place of honour on the common base.\"\n\nPaul Graindor, Un milliardaire antique: HÃ©rode Atticus et sa famille, chapter 2, page 19.

Herodes' aqueduct and the water supply at Olympia\n\nThe first studies of Olympia's water supply were written by the German architect Friedrich Graeber (1848-1917) for the reports of the German archaeological campaign 1892-1896.\n\nSee: Ernst Curtius, Friedrich Adler (editors), Olympia: die Ergebnisse der von dem Deutschen Reich veranstalteten Ausgrabung, Textband II: Die BaudenkmÃ¤ler. A. Asher & Co., Berlin, 1892. At Heidelberg University Digital Library.\n\nThe volume includes the following relevant articles:\n\nFriedrich Adler, XXV. Exedra des Herodes Atticus,\n\npages 134-139, Tafel LXXXIII-LXXXVI;\n\nFriedrich Graeber, XXVI, Therme am Kladeos,\n\npages 139-140, Tafel LXXXVII;\n\nFriedrich Graeber, XXXIV, Die Wasserleitungen,\n\npages 170-180, Tafel CI-CIV.\n\nThe Kladeos (ÎÎ»Î¬Î´ÎµÎ¿Ï) river is a tributary of the Alpheios (ÎÎ»ÏÎµÎ¹ÏÏ). It flows north to south through a channel below the level of the west side of the area of the Sanctuary of Zeus in Olympia, before merging with the Alpheios, which flows from east to west along the southern edge of the site. It was diverted and channelled in antiquity to control the water supply and prevent flooding in winter. As can be seen from the photo, right, taken in August 2018, the Kladeos sometimes remains a substantial stream in summer. Water from the Alpheios was apparently not drinkable.\n\nThe first baths at Olympia are thought to have been built near the Kladeos in the 5th century BC. The Leonidaion (ÎÎµÏÎ½Î¯Î´Î±Î¹Î¿Î½), the largest building in Olympia, financed by Leonidas of Naxos and built around 330 BC as a residence for official guests, was rebuilt and enlarged during the reign of Hadrian. In its inner courtyard was an artificial pool in which rainwater and water from the Kladeos was treated and stored. At its centre was an island on which stood a well. It has been estimated that the facility could supply water for 800 people during the five-day Olympic Games.\n\nSee: Efstathia Odysseos Valiantza, Examples of environmental engineering infrastructure works from Greek antiquity. In: John G. Dellis, Stephanos A. Paipetis (editors), The Influence of Hellenic philosophy on the contemporary world, pages 243-245. Cambridge Scholars Publishing, Newcastle upon Tyne, 2019.\n\nSo far I have found little detailed information about the aqueduct that fed the Nymphaeum at Olympia, its history, construction or materials. Most of the modern sources I have seen are quite vague on the subject, which suggests that the archaeological evidence has not been discovered or thoroughly researched. Some sources state that it was 4 km long, while others say 2 miles (3.2 km). It appears to have been a pipe conduit, perhaps of stone, which ran for at least part of its course underground. According to Graeber and others water was brought from the valley of Miraka (ÎÎ¹ÏÎ¬ÎºÎ±), a village today known as Archea Pisa (ÎÏÏÎ±Î¯Î± Î Î¹ÏÎ±, Ancient Pisa), 4 km east of Olympia. One or more springs are usually mentioned vaguely as the water source(s).\n\n\"The nymphaeum was a monumental termination of an aqueduct, which brought fresh spring water from a southwestern spur of Mt. Erymanthus to the north side of the Altis.\n\nThe water came from the side valleys of the Alpheus and was carried by an aqueduct (a pillar of which still stands near Miraka, about two miles from Olympia) and by a tunnel through the Hill of Kronos to a reservoir just north of the treasuries.\"\n\nHarry Carracci Rutledge, Herodes Atticus: world citizen, AD 101-177, 17. The Nymphaeum at Olympia, pages 124-126. PhD thesis, Ohio State University, 1960.\n\nIt should noted that the southwestern side of Mount Erymanthos (ÎÏÏÎ¼Î±Î½Î¸Î¿Ï) is in the northeast of Elis, and lot further than 4 km from Olympia.\n\nThe rhetorician and satirist Lucian of Samosata (ÎÎ¿Ï ÎºÎ¹Î±Î½á½¸Ï á½ Î£Î±Î¼Î¿ÏÎ±ÏÎµÏÏ, circa 125 - after 180 AD; see the note on the Ateion page), a contemporary of Herodes Atticus, wrote that the Cynic philosopher Peregrinos Proteus (Î ÎµÏÎµÎ³Ïá¿Î½Î¿Ï Î ÏÏÏÎµÏÏ, circa 95-165 AD), while at Olympia criticized Herodes Atticus (Lucian does not mention his name) whose water supply (the Nymphaeum) \"prevented the visitors to the festival from dying of thirst\". Peregrinos claimed that such a luxury made the Greeks effeminate, for which he was almost stoned to death by the crowds attending the games.\n\n\"Coming at last to Greece under these circumstances, at one moment he [Peregrinos] abused the Eleans, at another he counselled the Greeks to take up arms against the Romans, and at another he libelled a man outstanding in literary attainments and position because he had been a benefactor to Greece in many ways, and particularly because he had brought water to Olympia and prevented the visitors to the festival from dying of thirst, maintaining that he was making the Greeks effeminate, for the spectators of the Olympic games ought to endure their thirst - yes, by Heaven, and even to lose their lives, no doubt, many of them, through the frequent distempers which formerly ran riot in the vast crowd on account of the dryness of the place! And he said this while he drank that same water!\n\nWhen they almost killed him with stones, mobbing him with one accord, he managed to escape death at the moment by fleeing to Zeus for sanctuary (stout fellow!), and afterwards, at the next Olympiad, he gave the Greeks a speech which he had composed during the four years that had intervened, praising the man who had brought in the water and defending himself for running away at that time.\"\n\nLucian of Samosata, The passing of Peregrinus (Î ÎµÏá½¶ Ïá¿Ï Î ÎµÏÎµÎ³ÏÎ¯Î½Î¿Ï Î¤ÎµÎ»ÎµÏ Ïá¿Ï; Latin, De Morte Peregrini), sections 19-20.

Philostratus, The lives of the Sophists, Book II, sections 563-564, pages 176-177, see note 4).\n\nPeregrinos' attack on Herodes Atticus is thought to have occurred at the Olympic Games of either 153 AD or 157 AD, and his apparent change of heart at the next Olympiad, 157 AD or 161 AD. On the day after the end of the Olympic Games of 165 AD he publicly burnt himself to death in a pyre after delivering his own funeral oration.\n\nIn the notes to this edition (note 1, page 24) Harmon agreed with Paul Graindor's theory, estimated from the apparent ages of the statues of the children represented on the exedra, that the Nymphaeum was completed in 153 AD, and that Peregrinos made his speech criticizing Herodes Atticus during the Olympics of that year. He also maintained that the events reported by Lucian concerning Peregrinos occurred at four separate Olympics: 1. his attack on Herodes Atticus, 153 AD; 2. his contradictary praise of Herodes, 157 AD; 3. \"... he devised this ultimate venture of the pyre, and spread a report among the Greeks immediately after the last [previous] Olympic games that he would burn himself up at the next festival\" (Peregrinus, section 20), 161 AD; 4. his suicide, 165 AD.\n\nSee: Paul Graindor (1877-1938), Un milliardaire antique: HÃ©rode Atticus et sa famille, pages 86-88. Imprimerie Misr, Societe Anonyme Egyptienne, Cairo, 1938. At Gallica, BibliothÃ¨que nationale de France.\n\nHowever, this theory is questionable on several grounds. Firstly, the Lucian's mention of the \"last\" (previous) and \"next\" Olympics is somewhat vague, and does not necessarily mean fours year had passed between events 2 and 3. Secondly, the identities and ages of the many of the individuals represented on the statues from the exedra are still far from certain, as are dates in which the statues were made and dedicated. Thirdly, Peregrinos' criticism of the Nymphaeum does not necessarily indicate that its construction was completed (or the statues installed) when he delivered his attack. Even today people protest against building projects (airports, road and railway schemes, luxury apartment projects...) from the time they are announced, and long before a stone has been laid (or concrete poured).\n\nLucian claimed to have been present at Peregrinos' suicide, which he said took place at Harpina (á¼ÏÏÎ¯Î½Î±), 20 stades (around 4 km) east of Olympia (Peregrinus, section 35). This is around the location of Archea Pisa (formerly Miraka), north of which are remains believed to be those of the ancient city. Strabo called Arpina (á¼ÏÏÎ¹Î½Î±) one of the eight cities of Pisatis, a district of Elis, and wrote that the river Parthenias (Î Î±ÏÎ¸ÎµÎ½Î¯Î±Ï, thought to be river now called the Bakireiko, ÎÏÎ±ÎºÎ¹ÏÎ­Î¹ÎºÎ¿) flowed through it (Geography, Book 8, chapter 3, section 32). Pausanias wrote that the ruins of the city Harpinna (á¼ÏÏÎ¹Î½Î½Î±) stood on a river called Harpinates (ÎÏÏÎ¹Î½Î¬ÏÎ·Ï ÏÎ¿ÏÎ±Î¼ÏÏ), and that the Parthenias was nearby (Description of Greece, Book 6, chapter 21, sections 6-8). Both rivers are thought to have been tributaries of the Alpheios.\n\n17. Monopteros\n\nThe form of a monopteros was defined by Vitruvius in his discussion on circular temples.\n\nVitruvius, On Architecture, Book 4, chapter 8. At Bill Thayer's LacusCurtius website, University of Chicago.\n\n18. Lucian on Herodes Atticus and Polydeukes\n\nLucian of Samosata included two anecdotes concerning Herodes Atticus' excessive mourning for the deaths of Polydeukes (Î Î¿Î»Ï Î´ÎµÏÎºÎ·Ï) and Regilla in his Life of Demonax (ÎÎ·Î¼ÏÎ½Î±ÎºÏÎ¿Ï Î²Î¯Î¿Ï), a biography of the Greek Cypriot Cynic philosopher Demonax (ÎÎ·Î¼ÏÎ½Î±Î¾, circa 70-170 AD), who lived in Athens and was a contemporary of Herodes.\n\nSection 24. \"When Herodes, the superlative, was mourning the premature death of Polydeuces and wanted a chariot regularly made ready and horses put to it just as if the boy were going for a drive, and dinner regularly served for him, Demonax went to him and said: 'I am bringing you a message from Polydeuces.' Herodes was pleased and thought that Demonax, like everyone else, was falling in with his humour; so he said: 'Well, what does Polydeuces want, Demonax?' 'He finds fault with you,' said he, 'for not going to join him at once!'\"\n\nSection 33. \"Touching Herodes he remarked that Plato was right in saying that we have more than one soul, for a man with only one could not feast Regilla and Polydeuces as if they were still alive and say what he did in his lectures.\"\n\nDemonax (ÎÎ·Î¼ÏÎ½Î±ÎºÏÎ¿Ï Î²Î¯Î¿Ï).

At Perseus Digital Library.\n\nThe translation by H. W. Fowler and F. G. Fowler (The works of Lucian of Samosata. Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1905) unhelpfully renders Î Î¿Î»Ï Î´ÎµÏÎºÎ·Ï as \"Pollux\". In many older translations of Greek texts, names are often presented by their Latin counterparts (Zeus as Jupiter, Athena as Minerva, etc). On the other hand, the Fowler translation is generally more lively and readable than Harmon's.\n\n19. Portraits of Polydeukes\n\nKarl Anton Neugebauer first presented his tentative identification of the sculpture type as a portrait of Polydeukes in a paper he delivered in 1931, noted in Archaeologischer Anzeiger, in: Jahrbuch des Deutschen ArchÃ¤ologischen Instituts, Volume 46, page 360. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin, 1931.\n\nHe subsequently wrote about the Polydeukes portraits and other artworks connected with Herodes Atticus in two articles.\n\nK.

At Googlebooks.\n\nGazda discusses the history of scholarship of Polydeukes portraits and various known examples. She pointed out that Polydeukes is \"the most frequently represented youth of the 2nd century C.E. who was not in some way connected with the Roman imperial house\".

The Greek inscription refers to a portrait (Î¹Î´Î¹ÏÎ½) of Polydeukes dedicated to Nemesis, which may be the headless bust now at Rhamnous. Wordsworth translated the worn and damaged dedication, restoring some missing letters:\n\n\"A decree of the Senate and people of Rhamnus: Herodes dedicates a statue of Vibullius Polydeucion an Eques, whom he reared and loved as his own son, at his own cost, to Nemesis, to whom he used to sacrifice in company with him, his own affectionate and ever-remembered foster-child.\"\n\nChristopher Wordsworth, Athens and Attica: notes of a tour, pages 29-31. John Murray, London, 1855 (3rd edition). At the Internet Archive. (Pages 29 and 30 of this scanned edition have somehow ended up between pages 20 and 21.)\n\n20. Pausanias and Philostratus on Herodes' dedications at the Temple of Poseidon, Isthmia\n\n\"A legend of the Corinthians about their land is not peculiar to them, for I believe that the Athenians were the first to relate a similar story to glorify Attica. The Corinthians say that Poseidon had a dispute with Helios (Sun) about the land, and that Briareos arbitrated between them, assigning to Poseidon the Isthmus and the parts adjoining, and giving to Helios the height above the city [Acrocorinth].\n\nEver since, they say, the Isthmus has belonged to Poseidon.\n\nWorth seeing here are a theatre and a white-marble racecourse. Within the sanctuary of the god stand on the one side portrait statues of athletes who have won victories at the Isthmian games, on the other side pine trees growing in a row, the greater number of them rising up straight.\n\nOn the temple, which is not very large, stand bronze Tritons. In the fore-temple are images, two of Poseidon, a third of Amphitrite, and a Sea, which also is of bronze. The offerings inside were dedicated in our time by Herodes the Athenian, four horses, gilded except for the hoofs, which are of ivory, and two gold Tritons beside the horses, with the parts below the waist of ivory. On the car stand Amphitrite and Poseidon, and there is the boy Palaemon upright upon a dolphin. These too are made of ivory and gold. On the middle of the base on which the car is has been wrought a Sea holding up the young Aphrodite, and on either side are the nymphs called Nereids.\n\nI know that there are altars to these in other parts of Greece, and that some Greeks have even dedicated to them precincts by shores, where honours are also paid to Achilles. In Gabala is a holy sanctuary of Doto, where there was still remaining the robe by which the Greeks say that Eriphyle was bribed to wrong her son Alcmaeon.\n\nAmong the reliefs on the base of the statue of Poseidon are the sons of Tyndareus [the Dioskouroi], because these too are saviours of ships and of seafaring men. The other offerings are images of Calm and of Sea, a horse like a whale from the breast onward, Ino and Bellerophontes, and the horse Pegasus.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece, Book 2, chapter 1, sections 6-9. At Perseus Digital Library.\n\nThe chryselephantine (gold and ivory) statues of Poseidon and Amphitrite in a chariot described by Pausanias may have replaced the Pentelic marble statues of these deities, dated to the 2nd century AD, fragments of which have been discovered at the site. The base of this earlier statue group was decorated with marble relief panels depicting the myths of the Kalydonian Boar hunt and the slaughter of the Niobids (see the Niobe page for further details).\n\nPhilostratus mentioned Herodes' Isthmian dedications among a number of his works in Greece and Italy:\n\n\"... and there are also the statues at the Isthmus and the colossal statue of the Isthmian god [Poseidon], and that of Amphitrite, and the other offerings with which he filled the temple; ; nor must I pass over the dolphin sacred to Melicertes.\"\n\nPhilostratus, The lives of the Sophists, section 551, page 149 [see note 4]."
