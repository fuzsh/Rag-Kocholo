        "meta_description": "This article analyses ostracism as an instrument urging inner change in those subjected to it and discusses the reintegration of the formerly ostracized into Athenian society. It discusses selected peculiarities of the institution, such as exclusion, isolation and non-permanence, which allow us to presume that the subject was supposed to experience inner improvement during his period of exclusion. By investigating the ostracism(s) of Megacles and presenting analogous instances of impermanent exclusion from Greek literature, it demonstrates that the Athenians employed ostracism against norm-breaking deviants in order to bring about change in their disposition.",

        "text": "Notes\n\nThe draft of this paper was read in Aix-en-Provence at the workshop Political Refugees in the Ancient Greek World. I wish to thank the participants for their comments on my paper. I am also grateful to Professor Nick Fisher for his helpful comments, as well as to the anonymous referees of Pallas for their perceptive insights. I also take this opportunity to thank the Kone Foundation for financial support and the workshop organizer Laura Loddo for allowing me to read her forthcoming articles.\n\nE.g. [Andoc.] 4.3.\n\nVarious ancient sources name Cleisthenes as the lawgiver of ostracism: Androtion, FGrH 324 F 6; [Arist.] Ath. Pol. 22.1; Ael. Var. Hist. 13.24; Philochorus, FGrH 328 F 30; Vat. Gr. 144; Diod. Sic. 11.55.2. However, while [Arist.] Ath. Pol. 22.2 states that ostracism was part of Cleisthenes’ reforms established in 508/7, Androtion, FGrH 324 F 6 indicates that it may have been introduced in 488/7. For a discussion on the possible contradiction in the ancient sources, see, e.g., Kagan, 1961, p. 394-396; Stanton, 1970, p. 180. I find it likely that ostracism was part of Cleisthenes’ reforms. This is the opinion of several other scholars too: e.g., Forsdyke, 2005, p. 282. However, the hiatus of around 20 years between ostracism’s introduction and its first use has provoked much discussion, and scholars have presented several reasons for it: see, e.g., Hands, 1959, p. 71, 76; Kagan, 1961, p. 398; Stanton, 1970, p. 181. Some scholars have argued for the introduction of ostracism in 488/7 by either Themistocles, Aristides or Cleisthenes: see Raubitschek, 1951, p. 221; Hignett, 1952, p. 185, 189; Schreiner, 1970.\n\n[Arist.] Ath. Pol. 22.4-8 lists the five ostracisms that took place during the 480s. For the ostracism of Themistocles, see, e.g., Thuc. 1.135.3; Diod. Sic. 11.54.9; Plut. Them. 22.3; the ostracism of Cimon: Plut. Cim. 15.3, 17.3; Plut. Per. 9.5; Thucydides, son of Melesias: Plut. Per. 14.3, Plut. Per. 16.2; Hyperbolus: e.g., Thuc. 8.73.3; Plut. Alc.13.3-5.\n\nAlcibiades the Elder: Lys. 14.39; [Andoc.] 4.34; Menon: Hesychius, s. v. Menon; Damon: [Arist.] Ath. Pol. 27.4; Plut. Per. 4.3; Plut. Arist. 1.7; Callias: [Andoc.] 4.32.\n\nPhilochorus, FGrH 328 F 30; Plut. Arist. 7.4.\n\nFor example, Raaflaub, 2003, p. 327 has argued that ostracism was employed to exile such persons who were suspected to cherish “designs too great to be good for the community” and being “friends of tyrants or tyranny”, and according to Phillips, 1982, p. 24, ostracism was “designed to check those who had become too powerful”.\n\nE.g., Arist. Pol. 1284a17-36, 1288a25-30, 1302b15-29; [Arist.] Ath. Pol. 22.6; Diod. Sic. 11.55.87; Androtion 324 F 6; Philochorus, 328 F 30; Plut. Them. 22; Arist. 7.\n\n[Arist.] Ath. Pol. 22.6: “For three years they went on ostracizing the friends of the tyrants (τῶν τυράννων φίλους), at whom the legislation had been aimed, but afterwards in the fourth year it was also used to remove any other person who seemed to be too great (εἴ τις δοκοίη μείζων εἶναι μεθίσταντο); the first person unconnected with the tyranny to be ostracized was Xanthippus son of Ariphron.” Trans. H. Rackham. As Herbert Heftner (2002, p. 497) has noted, it is noteworthy that by using the verbal form δοκοίη (“would seem”), the author appears to emphasize the subjective element of ostracizing.\n\nAnti-superiority: e.g., Arist. Pol. 1284a17-37; Diod. Sic. 11.55.3; Thuc. 8.73.3. Usually, the envy explanations of ostracism occur in late sources such as Poll. 8.20; Plut. Arist. 7.2; Plut. Them. 22–24; Plut. Cim. 16; Plut. Per. 13; Plut. Alc. 13.6; however, Pind. Pyth. 7.18–20 implies that Megacles was ostracized because of envy. Of modern scholars, Raubitschek, 1958, p. 109 has argued that the original purpose of ostracism was to kolouein tous hyperekhontas (“punish those who rose above others”), but that one of the original causes of ostracism was phthonos doxês/aretês (“the envy of reputation/virtue”). Raubitschek, 1958, p. 90 has also argued that ostracism was designed to keep in check those “who were outstanding in their arrogance”.\n\nDiod. Sic. 11.55.3; Didymus, Commentary on Demosthenes 23.205. Trans. Phillips, 1982, p. 30.\n\nThuc. 8.73.3. Heftner, 2002, p. 495 notes that the fear felt by the people was irrational and was thus not based on the factual qualities of the “candidate” for ostracism.\n\nVarious scholars have considered that ostracism was an odd institution. See, e.g., Brenne, 1994, p. 13; cf. Hall, 1989, p. 93: “in a direct democracy it [ostracism] is bizarre.”\n\nForsdyke, 2005, p. 143-145.\n\nForsdyke, 2005, passim. See also Carcopino, 1935, p. 28 for an argument that ostracism was a “humane” mechanism and that by introducing ostracism, Cleisthenes intended to regulate violent political competition. In a similar vein, de Ste Croix, 2005, p. 206 has considered that ostracism was intended to be used whenever there was a “deep division within the State on a matter of great importance” and thus to prevent stasis. Likewise, Missiou, 2011, p. 36, 95 has stated that ostracism reflected public good and functioned as a solution to factional struggles which threatened the stability of the polis. Cf. Forsdyke, 2005, p. 170, who stresses, however, that ostracism was, in her view, not intended to solve political issues but to intervene in the struggle between two leaders.\n\nHall, 1989, p. 94, 95.\n\nApproximately 10,500 ostraka have been unearthed in the excavations at the Agora and Ceramicus in Athens. The first ostrakon was identified in 1853, and the excavations at Ceramicus and Agora had revealed 1,658 ostraka before 1966, when the “great discovery” at Ceramicus revealed 8,500 ostraka. The majority of the surviving ostraka contain only the name of the target, inscribed or painted on it. The ostraka bearing anything but the name of the target (such as a comment or a picture) form only a small minority of the preserved ostraka. For “portraits” on ostraka, see Brenne, 1992, passim.\n\nI agree with Raaflaub, 2003, p. 321, 322 that the ostraka testify that a certain person has been voted for but not that he has been ostracized. Raaflaub further observes that since the Athenians were entitled to cast their votes for whomever they wished, there must have been an enormous number of stray votes against a considerable number of persons. Indeed, a large number of scattered votes has been revealed by the excavations at the Agora and Ceramicus: various ostraka exist which bear the name of an individual unmentioned by the ancient Greek sources, and who are thus unidentifiable. For the names on the ostraka and their numbers and distribution: Lang, 1990; Willemsen-Brenne, 1991; Brenne, 2002, p. 43-73; Thomsen, 1972, p. 71-80. Sickinger, 2017 includes a catalogue of ostraka excavated from the Agora in the late 1990s. The only familiar names inscribed on these ostraka are those of Themistocles, Aristides and Xanthippus; other names belong to unknown persons.\n\nAnd perhaps as manifestations of the prevailing “political culture”, to use Benjamin Gray’s term: see Gray, 2015, esp. p. 6-19. The notion of political culture refers to the political assumptions and ideas underlying political actions and interacting with them. Political actions, in turn, reinforce these ideas and assumptions.\n\nFor a different view, see Garland, 2014, p. 138-140, who separates ostracism from other forms of exile.\n\nArist. Pol. 1.2.1253a1-7; Hom. Il. 9.63-64. The same quotation is repeated in Ar. Pax 1096-1098. For a discussion, see Loddo, forthcoming.\n\n[…] ὁ ἄπολις διὰ φύσιν καὶ οὐ διὰ τύχην ἤτοι φαῦλός ἐστιν, ἢ κρείττων ἢ ἄνθρωπος: Arist. Pol. 1253a2-7. The brutish beast and the hero/god are opposed by Aristotle also in his Nicomachean Ethics 1145a15. See also Vernant-Vidal-Naquet, 1990, p. 135, 437 n. 122.\n\nOn the positive attitude of the Cynics on wandering, see Montiglio, 2005, p. 180-203. Stoic philosophers considered that exile was an indifferent rather than a negative experience: see Stephens’ essay in this volume.\n\nMontiglio, 2005, p. 30, 33, 35. For a discussion on the stereotypes associated with the exile, see also Gray, 2015.\n\nPlut. Arist. 7.5.\n\nMirhady, 1997, p. 18.\n\nCanevaro, 2017, p. 57.\n\nDem. 23.45. For a discussion, see also Canevaro, 2017.\n\nManville, 1980, p. 221.\n\nYouni, 2018; Youni, 2019; cf. Maffi, 1983. Emphasizing the connection between atimia and timê, Maffi argues that the verb atimazein meant “dishonour” and expressed the community’s negative judgment about a person. Hansen, 1976, p. 55 has argued that atimia was not identical with disenfranchisement, and van ’t Wout, 2011, p. 126 has argued for a continuity between the legal (disfranchisement) and the non-technical and non-legal (dishonour) usages of the word. Dmitriev, 2015 argues that there was no evolution from a moral to legal concept or from a severe to a mild punishment, and that the ways of using atimia in classical Athens were the result of the extra-legal nature of the punishment.\n\nManville, 1980, p. 216; Hansen, 1976, p. 61-62.\n\nAndoc. 1.73-76. Other forms of partial atimia listed by Andocides included, for example, the loss of the right to speak in the Assembly, to become a member of the Council, or to enter the Agora. See also Manville, 1980, p. 216; Youni, 2019, p. 371-372.\n\nIt is disputed whether the ostracized had to stay within or outside the residential boundaries. For example, Raubitschek, 1958, p. 103-105 and Heftner, 2018, p. 96-98 argue that the ostracized were to stay within the geographical boundaries while Figueira concludes that the ostracized were to stay outside these limits. For a philological discussion, see Figueira, 1987, p. 281-288.\n\nChanging Draco’s homicide law: Dem. 23.62; establishing tyranny: [Arist.] Ath. Pol. 16.10; remaining neutral in civil strife: [Arist.] Ath. Pol. 8.5. For a discussion on remaining neutral in times of civic disorder, see Manville, 1980, p. 217-218. This measure was based on the Solonian law on stasis. The law has survived in [Arist.] Ath. Pol. 8.5, and its authenticity is under dispute: see Hansen, 1976, p. 75 n. 6 and p. 78-79, rejecting the authenticity of the law. For a contrasting view, see Forsdyke, 2005, p. 98, 99, accepting the law as authentic. For recent discussions on the Solonian law on stasis, see van t’ Wout 2010 for a claim that the law was not intended to encourage side taking but, in fact, quite the opposite; see also Schmitz 2011 for an argument that the stasis law may have been an archaic predecessor of ostracism. For a full list of transgressions that led to atimia, see Hansen, 1976, p. 72-74.\n\nE.g., Lanni, 2016.\n\nAgora P 17615 (in Lang, 1990). For a recent study on this ostrakon, a curse tablet and atimia, see van ‘t Wout, 2011.\n\nBrenne, 2002, T 1/150. Sickinger, 2017, p. 457, 475, 501 has observed that two ostraka (P 32941 and P 32587) excavated from Agora in the late 1990s may be interpreted as bearing the epithet katapygôn: a third line on one ostrakon addressed against Themistocles starts with the letters ΚΑΔΑΠ, which may be the beginning of the word katapygôn, assuming that the voter has, erroneously, written a delta for tau. A similar insult may also occur on an ostrakon against an unknown candidate that preserves the traces [- - -] ΠΙΓΟ[- - -]. However, these graffiti are very unclear and they remain open to interpretation.\n\nFor a discussion on the cultural image of a kinaidos, see Winkler, 1990, p. 45, 46, 50, 52, 54.\n\nRademaker, 2005, p. 257; Winkler, 1990, p. 51. In the fifth century, an absence of self-control was perceived as a violation against the prevailing civic ideals, and a lack of self-discipline was thought to make man incapable of leading the state. In other words, if man was regarded as incapable of controlling his personal lusts, he was viewed as incapable of controlling himself; and a man who was not in control of himself was seen as incapable of being in control of a state.\n\nPlut. Them. 22.3. Trans. Bernadotte Perrin.\n\nPlut. Them. 22.1.\n\nDiod. Sic. 11.54.5-55.1.\n\nDem. 23.204-205.\n\nBrenne, 2002, T 1/147.\n\nFor the connection between mega phronein (“thinking big”) and hybris, see Cairns, 1996.\n\nForsdyke, 2005, p. 166, 170.\n\nPlut. Them. 3.1-4 relates that Aristides and Themistocles were political opponents and personal enemies; they were different in their life and character. According to Plutarch, Aristides was gentle, conservative and righteous whereas his opponent Themistocles represented a more innovative type. Themistocles was famous for his ambition and for his competitive spirit: e.g., Plut. Them. 3.1-4; 8.110.1-3, 8.112.1-3, Hdt. 8.123.1-125.2. Furthermore, according to Plut. Arist. 2.1-2, Aristides represented a politician who was in favour of an aristocratic form of government while Themistocles was known as the “champion of the people”. According to [Arist.] Ath. Pol. 22.3, Themistocles was renowned for his military skills while Aristides was famous for his political skills and his justice. On Aristides’ and Themistocles’ enmity, see also Hdt. 7.144, 8.79.2; [Arist.] Ath. Pol. 22.7.\n\nPlut. Arist. 7.1-2. Trans. Bernadotte Perrin, modified.\n\nHdt. 8.79.1.\n\nPlut. Arist. 7.5-6: “[…] as the voters were inscribing their ostraka, it is said that an unlettered and utterly boorish fellow handed his ostrakon to Aristides, whom he took to be one of the ordinary crowd, and asked him to write Aristides on it. He, astonished, asked the man what possible wrong Aristides had done him. ’None whatever,’ was the answer, ’I don’t even know the fellow, but I am tired of hearing him everywhere called ’The Just.’ On hearing this, Aristides made no answer, but wrote his name on the ostrakon and handed it back.” Trans. Bernadette Perrin.\n\nThere is significantly more archaeological than literary evidence concerning the ostracism of Megacles against whom, according to Brenne, 2002, p. 62, 4142 ostraka have been unearthed. According to Brenne, 2002, p. 42, all the Ceramicus ostraka belong to the ostrakophoria of 471 as a result of which either Megacles or Themistocles was ostracized. For a recent discussion on the dating of the Ceramicus ostraka, see Sickinger, 2017, p. 449-451 (he prefers dating the ostraka to the 470s). However, Missiou, 2011, p. 157-158 believes that the Ceramicus ostraka are not from a single ostrakophoria but from several ostrakophoriai organized between the 480s and the 460s.\n\nBrenne, 2002, T 1/111.\n\nBrenne, 2002, T 1/107-108.\n\nHdt. 5.71.1; cf. Thuc. 1.126; Plut. Sol. 12. For another reference to cutting long hair, although in a completely different context, see Anac. fr. 347. See also Harrison, 2003, p. 147. Fisher, 2009, p. 535 notes, without a reference to the ostraka addressed against Megacles, that the Herodotean wording suggests that there was a close relation between a bid for tyrannical power, an Olympic victory, and an aristocratic hairstyle.\n\nBrenne, 2002, T 1/113.\n\nBrenne, 2002; Mattingly, 1971.\n\nBrenne, 2002, p. 118.\n\nDickie, 1984, p. 108.\n\nSeveral of Solon’s poems deal with the destructive effects of hybris. Specifically, his elegy on eunomia (fr. 4 West) discusses the effects of hybristic leaders on the polis, while his Hymn to the Muses (fr. 13 West) focuses on the retribution of hybris by the gods on a more individual level. Fr. 6 West states straightforwardly that koros breeds hybris in such men whose minds are not ready (or firm/solid enough) to receive it. For a recent commentary on Solon’s poems, see Noussia, 2010.\n\nArist., Gen. an. 725b35: ὅμοιον δὲ καὶ τὸ περὶ τὰς τραγώσας ἀμπέλους πάϑος, αἵ διὰ τὴν τροφὴν ἐξυβρίζουσιν […] For a discussion, see Fisher, 1992, p. 19.\n\nSee also Fisher, 1992, p. 19: “In plants the undesirable element in the hybris consists in the plants’ ‘disobedient’ failure to produce crops or fruit.” On hybristic plants, see especially Michelini, 1978, passim.\n\nMichelini, 1978.\n\nCf. Mirhady, 1997.\n\nKosmin, 2015, p. 124, too, has remarked the significance of return and the possible implications of ostracism as a “transformer” of a “dangerous or treacherous politician into a safe member of the Athenian community”.\n\nHes. Theog. 793–806. Trans. Hugh G. Evelyn-White.\n\nAntiph. 2.4.7; Andoc. 1.74. For a discussion, see Youni, 2019, p. 371.\n\nPl. Leg. 854d5, 907d-909a; Pl. Gorg. 478d6; cf. Pl. Crit. 121c2. For a discussion, see Rademaker, 2005, p. 290–291.\n\nHdt. 3.64.5. Cf. Hom. Od. 23.13. See also Rademaker, 2005, p. 252.\n\nRademaker, 2005, p. 253. Given that the man was sane he could, in the words of Rademaker, 2005, p. 254, “with the soundness of mind […] refrain from irresponsible behaviour”.\n\nIn this sense, hybrizein is one of the antonyms of sôphronein. Rademaker, 2005, p. 266.\n\nRademaker, 2005, p. 257-258.\n\nPl. Leg. 881d3-e7.\n\nFor a discussion, see Garland, 2014, p. 137.\n\nAccording to [Dem.] 25.58, 63, 95, “He is an unclean beast; his touch is pollution. Is he not impious, bloodthirsty, unclean, and a sycophant? [… ] His case is incurable, men of Athens, quite incurable. Just as doctors, when they detect a cancer or an ulcer or some other incurable growth, cauterize it or cut it away, so you ought all to unite in exterminating this monster. Cast him out of your city; destroy him.” See also Allen, 2000.\n\nCairns, 1993, p. 432.\n\nCairns, 1993, p. 139-146. For the debate over the question of early Greece as a “shame culture” or a “guilt culture”, see Cairns, 1993, p. 27-47.\n\nAdriaan Rademaker has challenged the alleged contrast between the “intellectual” sense, which translates sôphrosynê as “discreet”, “prudent” and “of sound mind”, and the “moral” sense, which prompts translations such as “self-controlled”, “temperate” and “chaste”: see Rademaker, 2005, p. 7-8. For women, the notion was associated with fidelity, and for boys and girls, it meant quietness or obedience: Rademaker, 2005, p. 251.\n\nPl. Gorg. 480a5-d7.\n\nPl. Leg. 867c4-d5; cf. Leg. 866d-e and 867b.\n\nGray, 2015, p. 127.\n\nSee Gray, 2015, p. 330 and n. 220 on the same page for references.\n\nFor the Stoic views on exile, see Stephens’ article in this volume.\n\nGray, 2015, p. 123, 127.\n\nCohen, 1991, p. 216 asks: “[…] how different is Plato’s legislation from Athenian law? Hasn’t Plato just systematized the traditional notion of asebeia and fitted it into his larger political theoretical framework?”\n\nDem. 25.94: “Now here is Aristogeiton, who has so far outstripped all men in wickedness that his punishments have not disciplined him (οὐδὲ παθὼν ἐνουθετήθη), and he is once more detected in the same illegal and rapacious acts.” Trans. A. T. Murray.\n\nAndoc. 1.144-145. For a discussion on this passage, see Gray, 2015, p. 127, 128.\n\nFor example, Allen, 2000, p. 79-80 has suggested that the Athenians treated wrongdoers as diseased persons who could spread disease within the city. On pollution in general, see Parker, 1983. On the connections between homicide and pollution, see also Harris, 2015, for an argument that the ideas of pollution had continuing influence on laws as late as in the fourth century.\n\nGernet, 1917.\n\nOn the scapegoat ritual in more detail, see Bremmer, 1983.\n\nVernant andVidal-Naquet, 1990, p. 133-135.\n\nPetrovic, 2016, p. 12.\n\nOsborne, 2011, p. 176.\n\nPetrovic, 2016, p. 31 (Table 0.1).\n\nBrenne, 2002, T 1 / 149.\n\nBrenne, 2002, T 1/38 = Lang 44. See also Forsdyke, 2005, p. 157.\n\nΧσάνθ[ιππον τόδε] φ͞εσὶν ἀλειτ͞ερ͞ον πρ[υτ]ανεί͞ον / τὄστρακ[ον Ἀρρί]φρονος παῖδα μά[λ]ιστ᾿ ἀδικε͂ν. Brenne, 2002, T 1/153; Lang, 1990, p. 134. The text is open to interpretation. An alternative way of reading the text (with changed accents on ἀλειτ͞ερον and πρ[υτ]ανεί͞ον) is: “This ostrakon says that the accursed Xanthippus, son of Ariphron, wrongs the prytaneion.” Forsdyke, 2005, p. 156 accepts the latter interpretation, thus dissenting from the scholarly consensus. See Lang, 1990, p. 134 and Brenne, 2002, p. 134 with further references.\n\nSee, e.g., Ogden, 1997, p. 143. According to Ogden, in Hyperbolus’ case, the banishment, harm to the city, and personal obnoxiousness were associated with each other. For a discussion of Hyperbolus and Cleon as scapegoats, see also Ogden, 1997, p. 144.\n\nE.g., Ar.

F 203 K.-A.: καίτοι πέπραχε τῶν τρόπων μὲν ἄξια, | αὑτοῦ δὲ καὶ τῶν στιγμάτων ἀνάξια:| οὐ γὰρ τοιούτων εἵνεκ᾽ ὄστραχ᾽ εὑρέθη. Trans. Forsdyke, 2005, p. 153. The poem is cited by Plut. Nic. 11.6. and Alc. 13.5.\n\nPlut. Alc. 13.3. Trans. Bernadotte Perrin.\n\nPlut. Nic. 11.1-4; Alc. 13.4. Although he emphasizes Hyperbolus’ obnoxious character, Plutarch sees the division of the people into two camps as the primary reason behind the organizing of the ostrakophoria of 415. Indeed, according to Plutarch, the feud between Alcibiades and Nicias had become intense, and the ostrakophoria was an attempt to resolve the situation. Forsdyke, 2005, p. 174-175 agrees with this view, arguing that while the ostracism of Hyperbolus is usually treated as an exception it may have been an example of the dêmos’ intervention in intra-elite strife for political power.\n\nForsdyke, 2005, p. 171-172.\n\nRosenbloom, 2004, p. 55, 56, 58, 65, 97. Rosenbloom concludes that Hyperbolus’ ostracism did not resolve the stasis between the chrêstoi and the ponêroi, but that the stasis continued to exist through the scandalous affairs of the mutilation of the Herms and the profanation of the Mysteries, as well as through the oligarchic revolutions in 411 and 404, and the restoration of democracy in 403.\n\nRosivach, 1987, p. 164 has suggested that Hyperbolus utilized the initial vote in the ekklêsia kyria to provoke the Athenians into reviving the institution of ostracism. According to Rosivach, Hyperbolus had manipulated the emotions of the people to intensify the hatred aroused by Alcibiades through his undemocratic style, behaviour and way of life. Alcibiades’ profligate way of life and his disregard for public opinion brought to the Athenians’ minds the life-style and attitude of a tyrant, and Hyperbolus, by exploiting this and presenting Alcibiades as a potential tyrant, manipulated the people to organize an ostrakophoria. Rosenbloom, 2004, p. 55, 72 considers that Hyperbolus had invoked the ostrakophoria and played the role of the advocate of the people by representing Alcibiades as a symbolic tyrant. As he notes, the tradition which considers the target of ostracism in terms of ill-will against the dêmos or his capacity to subvert democracy is here connected with the symbolic function of ostracism. Rosenbloom has drawn attention to the symbolic function implied in [Arist.] Ath. Pol. 22.3 statement that ostracism was first an attempt to prevent another Pisistratus, but that after expelling the remnants of the tyrannical regime, a “symbolic transformation” took place as the people also started to ostracize those who seemed “too great”. For the symbolic functions of ostracism, see also, e.g., Rosivach, 1987, p. 164-165; Forsdyke, 2005.\n\nSee Jetten-Hornsey, 2014, p. 467-470, with further references and literature.\n\nAccording to Thuc. 1.135, the trial of treason was brought about as a result of information laid by the Spartans after his ostracism. Plutarch, however, does not represent Themistocles as treacherous in his Life of Themistocles.\n\nFor the phases of Themistocles’ journey after his ostracism, see Thuc. 1.135.3-1.138.2. On Themistocles’ life and death: Thuc. 1.138.4-6; Nep. Them. 10.4; Plut. Them. 31.4-7.\n\nForsdyke, 2005, p. 167-168. Ephialtes had deprived the Areopagus of their prerogatives at the end of the 460s and was later assassinated. On Ephialtes, Pericles and the Areopagus: Plut. Cim. 15.1-2. For the chronology of Cimon’s dismissal and the deprivation of the prerogatives of the Areopagus, see, e.g., Cole, 1974.\n\nPlut. Cim. 8.5-6.\n\nCimon had been accused of having been bribed by King Alexander of Macedonia because he was not willing to invade Macedonia in 463: see Plut. Cim. 14.2.\n\nPlut. Per. 9.4. On Cimon’s alleged philolaconism: Plut. Cim. 16.1-4. Zaccarini, 2012 has claimed that the allegation of philolaconism is a product of late sources such as Plutarch, and that their allegations rely on the concept of philolaconism, which was not developed until the late fifth century.\n\nCimon’s recall: Theopompus, FGrHist 115 F 88; Plut. Per. 10.3-4; Cim. 17.6; Nep. Cim. 3.3.\n\nPlut. Cim. 18.1; Per. 10.1, 10.3; Diod. Sic. 11.86.1; Andoc. 3.3. According to Theopompus, FGrHist 115 F 88, too, Cimon was recalled after five years and he afterwards made a truce with the Lacedaemonians.\n\n[Andoc.] 4.33; Plut. Cim. 15.3; Suda, s. v. Kimon: ’Αθηναῖος. οὗτος τῇ ἀδελφῆ ’Ελπινίκῃ συγκοιμηθεὶς διεβλήθη πρὸς τοὺς πολίτας καὶ διὰ τοῦτο ὠστρακίσθη πρὸς τῶν ’Αθηναίων. Suda, s. v. ostrakismos: ὅτι Κίμων τῇ ἀδελφῆ ’Ελπινίκῃ συγκοιμηθεὶς καὶ διαβληθεὶς πρὸς τοὺς πολίτας ἐξωστρακίσθη. Suda s. v. apostrakisthênai: [...] ὅτι ἀποστρακισθῆναι φασι τὸν Κίμωνα τῇ ἀδελφῇ ’Ελπινίκῃ συγκοιμηθέντα ὑπὸ ’Αθηναίων. Gernet, 1917, p. 410 has emphasized the perspective of moral judgment. See also Zaccarini, 2012.\n\nBrenne, 2002, T 1/67.\n\nRosivach, 1987, p. 165.\n\nSee, e.g., Zaccarini, 2012, p. 296 n. 30.\n\nAccording to Zaccarini, 2012, p. 297, “laconizing” was associated with “weird sexuality before political crimes”.\n\nThemistocles Decree: ML 23. There is massive amount of research on the Themistocles Decree and its authenticity has been duly questioned. See, for example, Burstein, 1971.\n\nThis leads him to believe that the recall decree and the Themistocles decree were two different motions: Burstein, 1971, p. 97, 103, 110.\n\nTrans. H. Rackham. Philochorus, FGrHist 328 F 30 is another ancient Greek source on the geographical limits.\n\nE.g., Rhodes, 1981, p. 282. According to this view, the geographical limits were meant to prohibit the ostracized from stepping outside the geographical boundaries. See Figueira, 1987, p. 299 with n. 62. For a philological discussion, see also Phillips, 1982, p. 40-41 n. 68. For a recent discussion, see Heftner, 2018, p. 97-98, for an argument that the residential restrictions were declared in 481/0 to prevent the ostracized from being in contact with the Persians. According to Heftner’s reconstruction, the ostracized “was not allowed to enter the area beyond the promontory of Euboa”: see Heftner, 2018, p. 105.\n\nFigueira, 1987, p. 290-294, 305. According to Hdt. 8.79.1 and Dem. 26.6, Aristides had stayed on Aegina during his ostracism. Unfortunately, we do not have any evidence on the place of residence of the other men ostracized during the 480s.\n\nLoddo, 2019a, p. 9; cf. Loddo, 2019b. See also Gray, 2015, p. 309-310.\n\nGray, 2015, p. 308-309; on the tendency of the exiles to settle peraiai, see Loddo, 2019b.\n\nGray, 2015, p. 308, 330, 333 with further references and literature.\n\nGray, 2015, p. 323 (Table 6.1).\n\nPind. Pyth. 7.18-20.\n\nDem. 23.37.
