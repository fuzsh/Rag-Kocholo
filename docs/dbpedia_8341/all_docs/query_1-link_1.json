        "text": "Elpinice appears twice in Plutarch’s life of Pericles (ruled circa 461–429 B.C.E.), in both instances confronting the Athenian statesman in a forthright and determined manner about issues of state. Her challenges to authority seem to have incited malicious gossip about her (some of which is reported by Plutarch). She was the daughter of Miltiades, tyrant of the Greek colonies, and sister of Cimon, an important Athenian political figure. When Cimon was accused of taking bribes from Alexander I and charged with treason, Elpinice intervened on his behalf by negotiating with Pericles. His response—to allow Cimon’s acquittal—indicates that Elpinice was a formidable person of her time."
