        "text": "Around 470 b.c. the Athenians ostracized Themistocles, son of Neocles, of the deme of Phrearrhioi.Footnote 2 Themistocles went into exile to Argos, and ended his days in the Persian empire to escape a later conviction for treason (Thuc. 1.135–8; Diod. Sic. 11.54–60; Plut. Them. 21–9). Among the ostraka against Themistocles discovered in Athens, one is inscribed with an interesting comment: ‘this ostrakon is for Themistocles of Phrearrhioi, on account of honour (Θεμισθοκλ|εῖ τόδε ὄστ|ρακον [Φ]ρεα|ρίωι [τ]ιμ|ε̃ς hέν̣ε|κα)’ (Kerameikos 8463).Footnote 3 This comment is paralleled in several sources which suggest that Themistocles’ ostracism was intimately connected with Athenian attitudes towards honour (Kerameikos 7262; Hdt. 8.124–5; Dem. 23.205; Plut. Them. 22). The significance of this evidence, however, has mostly been overlooked. Instead, Themistocles’ ostracism is usually interpreted as the outcome of factionalism between Themistocles and the Alcmeonids,Footnote 4 in accordance with a picture of Athenian democracy as dominated by a restricted group of elite politicians competing for power and prestige.Footnote 5 This article uses the case study of Themistocles to argue that ostracism as an institution aimed to enforce appropriate behaviour in matters of honour on the part of politically active citizens. By reassessing the role of competition in the rationale of ostracism in accordance with recent studies of honour, it will shed new light on the nature of democratic politics in Classical Athens.\n\nThe procedure of ostracism is well known. During the sixth prytany of each year, the Assembly voted on whether to hold an ostracism. The Athenians would then carry out the ostracism in the eighth prytany. Each voter would write the name of a fellow citizen on a potsherd (ostrakon). If a quorum of 6,000 votes was met, the man with most votes would be exiled for ten years while being allowed to keep his property.Footnote 6 The rationale of the institution, on the other hand, has long been debated. A popular scholarly trend connects ostracism with aristocratic politics and elite competition. Ostracism would have been an instrument for elite politicians to get rid of their rivals and for the polis to prevent divergences over policy.Footnote 7 This interpretation, however, cannot account for the extreme variety of explanations of ostracism found in ancient sources, which include references to tyranny, Medism or luxurious lifestyle. An influential version of this view has been offered by Sara Forsdyke, who interprets ostracism as a ritualized form of democratic control over the politics of exile typical of archaic elite competition. Ostracism would have been deployed in periods of intense elite conflict in order to act as a symbolic reminder of the power of the people over exile.Footnote 8 While Forsdyke convincingly stresses the existence of a ritual element in ostracism,Footnote 9 her argument necessarily depends on the acceptance of the controversial Cleisthenic origin of the institution.Footnote 10 The conflicts thought to have led to individual ostracisms are also dubiously attested. A prominent example is Cimon's ostracism, which is interpreted as the outcome of his struggle with Ephialtes.Footnote 11 Yet the existence of such a struggle is seriously undermined by recent studies which have compellingly challenged Ephialtes’ centrality in Athenian politics and the historicity of his divisive reform.Footnote 12\n\nOlder views of ostracism ignored elite competition but were equally unsatisfactory. Scholars once regarded ostracism as a weapon against traitors and Medizers,Footnote 13 or as an instrument to prevent tyranny.Footnote 14 These views conflict with the fact that traitors and people suspected of aiming at tyranny could face much harsher penalties than ostracism, such as disenfranchisement and death.Footnote 15 Such interpretations are also not entirely supported by the evidence. Accusations of treason and Medism feature on a series of ostraka but are never found in the literary sources, and are contradicted by the comments on several other ostraka which are unrelated to these crimes. The connection of ostracism and tyranny is supported by Aristotle and the Aristotelian Constitution of the Athenians. However, while the aforementioned ostraka against Medizers might amount to allusions to tyrannical aspirations,Footnote 16 tyranny is never explicitly linked to ostracism in the fifth-century sources.Footnote 17 This is not to suggest that this evidence is unreliable. Suspicions of treason, Medism or tyrannical aspirations may well have played a role in ostracism, but, as we shall see, they were manifestations of the institution's broader concern with honour.Footnote 18\n\nThe most convincing interpretations of ostracism have been put forward by Christian Mann and by Peter Siewert. Their studies have successfully considered several contradictory explanations of ostracism found in the evidence, which encompass both the political and the social domains. Mann has argued that the dēmos viewed ostracism as a means to exert control over influential individuals and maintain equality, and has rightly noted how this institution was often interpreted by the elite as a sign of envy (φθόνος) for their success.Footnote 19 Siewert has similarly proposed to view ostracism as an extrajudicial means to pressure the elite into abiding by the political, social, moral and religious norms of the community.Footnote 20 Yet both interpretations are problematic because they presuppose a clear-cut distinction between the values of the dēmos and those of the elite and underestimate democracy's capacity to produce ideas and values shared by the whole community.Footnote 21\n\nI agree that ostracism compelled politically active Athenians to abide by the social and political norms of the community, including democratic equality. However, I argue that these norms (and the φθόνος against those believed to infringe them) belonged to the broader domain of honour, which was shared by the mass and the elite. Scholars have traditionally understood honour exclusively as a scarce resource pursued through zero-sum competition.Footnote 22 Recent studies across various fields, however, have been increasingly stressing how honour can equally foster cooperative values and social cohesion.Footnote 23 The model elaborated by anthropologist Frank Stewart is particularly appropriate for the Greek world. Stewart defines honour as ‘the right to be treated as having a certain worth’; in other words, a right to respect.Footnote 24 He distinguishes between two interconnected kinds of honour. Horizontal honour is the right to respect owing to all members of the peer group qua equals, irrespective of their individual merits. Vertical honour is ‘the right to special respect enjoyed by those who are superior’, for example the competitive honour enjoyed by virtue of individual merits.Footnote 25\n\nIn the Greek world, the dynamics described by Stewart belonged to the domains of τιμή and αἰδώς. Of these, τιμή referred both to the value one is attributed by oneself or others and to the esteem one is conferred by others; as an expression of one's status and esteem, it could also indicate a right, prerogative or public office.Footnote 26 αἰδώς denoted both the shame one feels in connection with actions and situations which compromise one's own honour and the respect one is expected to show for the honour of others.Footnote 27 The notions of τιμή and αἰδώς (as well as related notions such as hybris and φθόνος) expressed relations of horizontal and vertical honour. Horizontal honour is at work among peers in the Iliad, as attested by Poseidon's claim to equal honour (μ᾽ ὁμότιμον ἐόντα) with Zeus and Hades (15.184–9).Footnote 28 Horizontal honour within the citizen community is implied in the Mynians’ request to share in the Spartans’ prerogatives (μοῖράν τε τιμέων μετέχοντες); the Mynians mention no personal merits but recall their Peloponnesian origins, and the Spartans grant them citizenship because of their connections with the Dioscuri (Hdt. 4.145.4–5). Vertical honour is most evident in the Homeric heroes’ desire to increase their status through prowess in war.Footnote 29 Glaucus, for example, declares that his father sent him to Troy to be the best of all heroes and so that he would not bring shame upon his ancestors (μηδὲ γένος πατέρων αἰσχυνέμεν, Hom. Il. 6.206–10). The same is true of Athenian honorific practices. These granted honours to public benefactors through inscribed decrees and several kinds of gifts, from crowns and exemptions to the μέγισται τιμαί, which included the erection of a statue and the permanent right to be fed at public expense in the Prytaneion.Footnote 30"
