        "text": "Aglaonice (Aganice) is considered the first female astronomer in ancient Greece, known for her knowledge of the moon and its cycles. Her ability to predict lunar eclipses gained her a reputation as a sorceress who could make the moon disappear from the sky. She is mentioned by Apollonius of Rhodes (third century B.C.E.) and Plutarch (C.E. 46â€“after 119), both of whom say that she was the daughter of one Hegemon or Hegetor of Thessaly."
