        "text": "There is a point where Darlington tries to dismiss Stevens after the second question he fails to answer, but the condescending twat keeps him back for a third, and Darlington accedes to his guest. I took it that Darlington was a little uncomfortable at the scene but ultimately not enough to stand in the way of what he thought he ought to do as host.\n\nUltimately it's a fascist scene - the guest is arguing against the principles of democracy, and Darlington, despite his unease, is going along with it.\n\nWhat's also interesting is that the one character who properly stands up to these landed gentlemen with their nazi sympathies is Mr Benn, Miss Kenton's eventual husband: but their life together is portrayed as a disaster and we are given to believe that Miss Kenton would have gotten along much better if she had stayed in service to the landed nobility at Darlington Hall like Stephens did, rather than strike out on her own with a husband trying to make something of himself.\n\nR148 Well, I'm basing a lot of it on Miss Kenton and her eventual husband, Mr Benn.\n\nMr Benn is the opposite of Stevens. Firstly, he doesn't take the 'Master knows best' attitude. He condemns 'Sir Geoffrey and his Blackshirts' and eventually leaves his employment, believing in his own right to stand up for himself and speak his beliefs 'If I don't like something, I want to be in a position to stay \"Stuff it!\"'. There is if I remember correctly a key scene between Benn and Stevens in which Stevens tells Benn that his greatest satisfaction is of being good service to his employer, which Benn demurs at. Later, Benn and Kenton agree that Stevens is wrong to say 'Look after the house and the rest will look after itself' (my quotes won't be precise here). Secondly, Benn actually has the balls to ask Kenton to marry him. Thirdly, he wants to become a self-made man and set up a boarding house together with her. What happens? The boarding house is a disaster, their marriage collapses, and Benn is reduced to crawling to Sally (Kenton) begging her to agree to go together to visit their daughter with him. We are left with the strong implication that she ends up staying with him because she has nothing else she can do. She acknowledges at the end that she has made 'a terrible waste of her life' by deciding to leave Darlington Hall and marry him. Why did the small business plan and the being master of your own life dream collapse for them? We are meant to feel that, but for the tragedy of circumstance and her daughter's pregnancy at the end, she would have been better off back in employment and serving the upper-classes with Stevens, but it's too late to turn the clock back.\n\nSecondly more for cinematographic reasons. Consider the bright, sharp colours, the activity and energy, the thriving house and the handsome young servants (Chaplin, Headley, etc), even funny Mr Cardinal in the 1930s scenes. The montage that follows Stevens' claim that 'in England, order and tradition still prevail'. Now contrast that with the 1950s scenes. Darlington Hall has been saved and has a new master, Mr Lewis. Yet the colour palette is washed-out and depressing, it all seems darker and dingier, there are endless scenes of the house covered in dust protectors looking well past its best, the magic isn't coming back. Mr Lewis is a decent chap but he's a rich, somewhat vulgar American, haute bourgeoisie/nouveau riche rather than aristocracy, he has different values ('the professionals'), and he'll never seem in his right place in the house like Lord Darlington did. Stevens' new housekeeper (a matron at a boys' preparatory school) sounds smart and competent but she'll never replace Miss Kenton. The war cost England too much and it will never recapture its former glory. The pigeon which flies away at the end symbolises a lost love but also the glory of a lost era.\n\nI do think R125 is right to note that the film points up the flaws of the old English values of decency, honesty etc and how they led 'gullible' Lord Darlington to be taken in by the Nazis (again in contrast to the book where I'm told he is portrayed as much more enthusiastically a Nazi himself) but nevertheless that doesn't preclude the film essentially being a work of nostalgia, longing for a world which it nonetheless recognises could not survive modernity, but which will always be a lot better than that which replaced it.\n\nHere's where I would slightly differ: just because Mr. Benn and Miss. Kenton end up in a failed marriage does not therefore imply that staying with Stevens/old world would have been better. I think the film has a profoundly bleak outlook - the whole world of Stevens and Darlington was a moral failure and ends in ruin. But the life of commoners in postwar Britain was no joy either - remember that the modern day scenes of Miss Kenton and Mr. Benn are essentially contemporaneous with the emerging John Osborne/British kitchen sink drama era. And let's of course not forget that Miss Kenton chooses Mr. Benn because he is decisive in his desire for her - not because she was so madly in love with him. But that he had acted where Mr. Stevens could not because of his repression. By the time her loveless marriage has fallen apart, she is ready to go back into service, longing for those days of yore, and yes perhaps the comfort/nostalgia of this vanishing upper class world. But it's too late - her daughter is pregnant and she decides she needs to stay in the unhappy life she chose. But, again, I don't think the film is suggesting at all that she should have - or would have been happier - if she'd stayed at Darlington Hall. At least she has a family, a daughter, and grandchild on the way. Whereas Stevens is left, in the end, with absolutely nothing.\n\nWell, the tone of the movie has to be one of \"failure.\"\n\nWhichever \"side\" you're on, Britain was a poor, broke country at the end of WW2. The movie portrayed it as such. There was a link drawn between people who *prolonged* the inevitable conflict by collaborating with the Nazis.\n\nChurchill was correct. If we had bombed Germany after its invasion of the Rhineland in 1936, they would not have had to strength to conquer all of Europe. So the movie was more a condemnation of people who believe in false ideals. Mr Stevens believing in service at any cost, and Lord Darlington believing in the Nazis.\n\nThe pigeon to me was more a sign of hope. The end of the movie was extremely depressing. I was glad to escape the house on the \"wings of a pigeon\" as it were, to get away from that atmosphere of death and loss."
