        "text": "I recently watched the film The Remains Of The Day. Although my love for Hugh Grant served as my motivation to do so . It struck me as a possible film within which to explore our theme, conflict in context.\n\nThe Remains Of The Day follows Stevens, a devout Butler in a stately English home on a road trip across the english countryside. The film also follows a past narrative in which he recounts his days serving Lord Darlington. He considers these the best days of his life, which is reflective of his blind devotion to his duties.\n\nAs the film progresses, Stevens’ views shift from being strictly dutiful and respectful of his employer to being able to step back and consider the role of Lord Darlington, and how he fell prey to manipulation by the Third Reich. The Lord hosted international conferences, and convinced the British Government to negotiate an appeasement treaty in the German’s favour, which contributed to the outbreak of World War Two.\n\nStevens’ travels allow him to interact with people outside the manor who come from a different social class than the lords and servants he has surrounded himself with. Perhaps it is that Stevens is now finally exposed to the people who were affected by the Darlington’s actions. Or the physical distance from the estate, that allows for Stevens to finally outgrow his sense of subservience and to question rather than blindly follow the actions of his employer, and those in social class above him.\n\nThis film served as a reminder to me that many accounts of war and conflict are deeply affected by their context. Stevens’ role as a butler served to bar him from being able to question the changing political landscape. He was constricted by his inability to question his employer and upper social classes. I think that sitting through a two hour film, of which a predominant theme was Stevens’ outgrowing of such values. Even his acceptance and suggested regret that he had played a part in Lord Darlington’s actions through his blind subservience. Was important in highlighting how individuals’ positions and a multitude of variables such as social class, affect their views and experience of conflict. That it required such a journey, for Stevens’ to be able to reflect over a 20 year period and to realise his own biases and mistakes. Helped me to realise how hard it is to accept and understand one’s own biases, and how crucial it is that we factor these in when reading texts and accounts of war. After all, biases serve as context to conflict.\n\nRelated\n\nlmac562\n\nI am in the second year of my university career, studying an Arts/ Commerce conjoint. I have currently committed to studying Analytics and Sociology, my other majors are subject to change. Since high school, I have had a great love for humanities and social sciences, which has constantly developed with my changing interests. I wanted to study sociology, as I wanted to learn more about social structures and how they were developed. By combining this intent with my commerce degree, I aim to be able to understand and reach helpful and realistic conclusions about social economic health problems and being able to discuss and realise how best these can be targeted and addressed. I want to have a clear understanding of qualitative and quantitative information, and the processes in which they are collected and understood. I intend to continue my studies with a Masters of Public Policy, and such skills would be helpful. These aspirations also explain why ArtSchol appeals to me so much. It gives me an outlet to explore such topics. I want to focus my research on how different forms of data are collected and processed, and how these processes differ. I think that many issues that we are facing in Aotearoa, cannot be looked at from a purely numeric or economic standpoint. The aim of my studies is to develop a balanced perspective, so that I feel confident to address incoming social and economic issues."
