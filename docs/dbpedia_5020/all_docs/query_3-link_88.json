        "text": "The protagonist of Kazuo Ishiguro’s The Remains of the Day is Stevens, an English butler before and after World War II. Throughout the text, he reflects on the various losses that he has suffered throughout his career. In the text, loss is depicted as death, a decline in status, or missed opportunities. Stevens experiences each of these forms of loss, yet does make any changes to his character. Through him, Ishiguro suggests that remaining consistent in their usual activities is how some people get through times of great loss. During each loss that Stevens faces, he holds steadfast to his role as a butler, refusing to let the loss affect him and his work. However, as a result of this behavior, Stevens’s sacrifices time to reflect on these losses …show more content…\n\nThe housemaid of Darlington Hall, Miss Kenton has worked the closest with Stevens. One night, after spending time with a man that she had been seeing for some time, Miss Kenton announced to Stevens that she had accepted this man’s marriage proposal (Ishiguro 217). When Miss Kenton told Stevens of her engagement, Stevens congratulates her and tells her “I will do my best to secure a replacement at the earliest opportunity…Now if you will excuse me, I must return upstairs” (Ishiguro 218). In this moment, Stevens could have shared an array of emotions and thoughts. He is being informed that he was losing his closest coworker and a chance at having an intimate relationship with her. Instead, he chooses to stay focused on his job. Even when Miss Kenton began to provoke him, asking him “you have no more words to greet the news of my possible departure than those you have uttered,” he did not take a break from his duties (Ishiguro 218). Stevens is about to lose one of the few closest relationships that he has. Through this loss, Stevens’s keeps reverting back to his work and uses it as an excuse to avoid a conversation with Miss Kenton. In addition, by immediately returning to work, Stevens sacrifices a chance to process what he has done. Steven was given opportunity to share his emotions and feelings with Miss Kenton. Instead, by focusing on his work, …show more content…\n\nWhen discussing the qualifications for what makes a great butler, Stevens states that a great butler is one who serves a moral man or “gentlemen who were, so to speak, furthering the progress of humanity” (Ishiguro 114). Because his employer and owner of Darlington Hall, Lord Darlington, was perceived as being a moral man, Stevens views himself as being a great butler. However, Darlington loses his position as a moral man. As a result of his actions with and relationship to German dignitaries prior to World War II, Lord Darlington became known as a Nazi sympathizer after the war (Ishiguro 235). As Darlington loses his status, Stevens is losing his; based on his own evaluation of his status. Yet, Stevens does not waver in his commitment to Darlington. Even after Darlington’s death, when Stevens is no longer his butler, he remains dedicated to his role as Darlington’s butler. When questions arise about Darlington after he has died, Stevens does answer these questions fully because he believes “that it is not customary in England for an employee to discuss his past employers” (Ishiguro 125). Even with Darlington being deceased and his status no longer existing, Stevens remains faithful to his former employer. Through all his other losses, staying consistent in his role as a butler is how Stevens got through them. Thus, as he loses his status and Lord Darlington, Stevens does what he has always done during"
