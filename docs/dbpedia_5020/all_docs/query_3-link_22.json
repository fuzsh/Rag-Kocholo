        "text": "The Remains of the Day, novel by Kazuo Ishiguro, published in 1989.\n\nThe Remains of the Day, Ishiguro’s first novel set outside his native Japan and in his adopted England, is typical of Ishiguro’s style: delicate, detailed, and evocative prose which reveals the perceived flaws in a central character through that character’s first-person narrative. Events tend to unfold within the narrative, and the character’s discoveries about himself are revealed to the reader simultaneously, thus allowing us to empathize and identify strongly with him.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nFamous Novels, First Lines Quiz\n\nThe main protagonist is Stevens, a traditional English butler, all reserve, discretion, and decorum; in an interview, Ishiguro noted that P.G. Wodehouse’s fictional butler Jeeves was an influence. The story is set in the 1950s towards the end of Stevens’ career, when he is looking back on his years of service and forward to what is left of his life.\n\nStevens reveals his unquestioning loyalty and devotion to Lord Darlington, his long-term employer, who came under suspicion as a Nazi sympathizer during World War II and suffered social ostracism. He also realizes his love for Miss Kenton, a love that is in conflict with his idea of life in service and which he struggles to acknowledge.\n\nAt the start of the book, Lord Darlington has been dead for several years, and the hall now belongs to an American who wants a more informal relationship with his butler, in keeping with the times. Can the very traditional Stevens change the habits of a lifetime and rise to the challenge of the future?"
