With careful and unfailing devotion, he adheres to a system of old-fashioned propriety. His worldview is challenged and complicated by a vivacious housekeeper who falls in love with him and for whom he cares deeply, though he is unable to directly express it. Stevens must also quietly contend with the fact his master, Lord Darlington, is an influential, yet naïve gentleman under the spell of Nazi sympathizers.\n\nFor more about The Remains of the Day and the The Remains of the Day Blu-ray release, see the The Remains of the Day Blu-ray Review published by Dr. Svet Atanasov on September 13, 2016 where this Blu-ray release scored 4.0 out of 5.\n\nDirector: James Ivory\n\nWriters: Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, Kazuo Ishiguro\n\nStarring: Anthony Hopkins, Emma Thompson, James Fox, Christopher Reeve, Peter Vaughan, Hugh Grant\n\nProducers: Ismail Merchant, Mike Nichols, John Calley, Paul Bradley\n\n» See full cast & crew\n\nThe Remains of the Day Blu-ray Review\n\nReviewed by Dr. Svet Atanasov, September 13, 2016\n\nWinner of BAFTA Award for Best Actor, James Ivory's \"The Remains of the Day\" (1993) arrives on Blu-ray courtesy of Australian label Via Vision Entertainment. The supplemental features on the disc includes three archival featurettes and a gallery of deleted scenes with optional commentary by the American director. In English, with optional English SDH subtitles for the main feature. Region-Free.\n\nMr. Stevens\n\nThe film begins in the present, but the bulk of the story it tells actually takes place in the past. There are a few episodes where the past and present quickly overlap, but it is very easy to follow the chronology of the events and the progression of the relationships between the main characters.\n\nAnthony Hopkins is perfectly cast as Mr. Stevens, an aging butler who has spent most of his life working for the wealthy Lord Darlington (James Fox, The Servant). Now Stevens is the most important man in Darlington Hall -- in addition to overseeing a large team of servants, he makes sure that life has a consistent rhythm there, the type that Lord Darlington prefers.\n\nBut when Lord Darlington hires a new housekeeper, Miss Kenton (Emma Thompson, Sense and Sensibility, Mr. Stevens suddenly discovers that he is not immune to romantic attraction. Initially the discovery annoys Mr. Stevens, but later on it forces him to slowly begin reevaluating his seemingly perfectly organized life.\n\nMeanwhile, sensing that Mr. Stevens is struggling to hide his feelings behind the mask he has been wearing for years, Miss Kenton attempts to get closer to him. But her kindness is misinterpreted and then promptly rejected with a personal warning.\n\nAround the same time, Darlington Hall welcomes high-ranking local and foreign political leaders and they begin debating the future of Europe. Some vow to support Germany's efforts to rebuild its economy and reclaim its spot amongst the traditional European powers, while others warn that Hitler and his party are not to be trusted.\n\nBased on Kazuo Ishiguro's novel, The Remains of the Day is one of the finest period films to be produced by the Merchant-Ivory team. As far as this reviewer is concerned, it is also the most powerful one from the team's terrific roster. It was directed by James Ivory, written by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, and produced by Ismail Merchant.\n\nThe film tells two different stories. The first is about the aging butler who discovers true love but instead of embracing it allows it to slip away. In the process he undergoes a massive character transformation, but it is many years later that he finally comes to terms with the fact that he has made a terrible mistake. The story may sound familiar, but it is infused with a very unique quiet intensity that actually produces all sorts of different surprises.\n\nThe second story is slightly less effective. A few years before WWII, the old-fashioned Lord Darlington becomes involved in a complicated political game which also forces him to reevaluate his life. Unlike the butler, however, he never recovers from his terrible mistake.\n\nThere is classic British eloquence and elegance in this film that nowadays seem completely lost. Bold producers still finance period films, but the sincerity and wit that define the Merchant-Ivory productions have not been recreated. It takes a team of visionaries to do it, and since Ivory, Jhabvala and Merchant, at best there have been only a few decent imitators.\n\nHopkins is incredible as the aging butler. In fact, he is so good that it is impossible to imagine that the film would have been even remotely as effective as it is without him. Thompson is wonderful as the object of his affection. Fox also does not disappoint as the overly ambitious Lord Darlington. There are memorable cameos by Ben Chaplin, Hugh Grant, and the late Christopher Reeve.\n\nThe film was lensed by cinematographer Tony Pierce-Roberts, who earned two Oscar nominations for his contribution to two other Merchant-Ivory productions, A Room with a View and Howards End.\n\nThe Remains of the Day Blu-ray, Video Quality\n\nPresented in its original aspect ratio of 2.39:1, encoded with MPEG-4 AVC and granted a 1080p transfer, James Ivory's The Remains of the Day arrives on Blu-ray courtesy of Australian label Via Vision Entertainment.\n\nThe release has been sourced from the same 4K master that Sony Pictures used for the British release of the film. I like this master a lot. In fact, my one and only very minor complaint is the presence of some extremely light sharpening that pops up in a couple of outdoor panoramic shots (see screencapture #21). The rest of the presentation is truly outstanding. Detail and clarity are excellent and fluidity is as good as one can expect it to be. Depth is equally pleasing, though there are a few segments where minor fluctuations exist. However, these fluctuations are introduced by the unique ways in which light is captured by the camera (see indoor shots with restricted light). There are no traces of problematic degraining corrections. Colors are very healthy and wonderful saturated. Finally, there are no stability or transition issues to report. (Note: This is a Region-Free Blu-ray release. Therefore, you will be able to play it on your player regardless of your geographical location).\n\nThe Remains of the Day Blu-ray, Audio Quality\n\nThere is only one standard audio track on this Blu-ray release: English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1. Optional English SDH subtitles are provided for the main feature. When turned on, they appear inside the image frame. (To access the subtitles, you need to use your remote control).\n\nThe dynamic intensity is unlikely to impress those of you who enjoy the aggressive sound designs of big-budget blockbusters, but there are various sounds and noises that are reproduced with striking precision. Overall balance is also very good. The dialog is crystal clear, clean, stable, and very easy to follow.\n\nThe Remains of the Day Blu-ray, Special Features and Extras\n\nThe Filmmakers' Journey - in this archival featurette, novelist Kazuo Ishiguro discusses the original story that inspired the film while James Ivory explains precisely how it was adapted.

On the Pier\n\nThe Remains of the Day Blu-ray, Overall Score and Recommendation\n\nI have now seen a couple of different releases from Australian label Via Vision Entertainment -- including some exclusive new releases that are currently available only in Australia -- and I have to say that I am quite impressed. Indeed, the technical presentation is always either very good or excellent. The new release of James Ivory's The Remains of the Day is sourced from Sony's 4K master and rather predictably the film looks lovely in high-definition. Australians need to support Via Vision Entertainment because I can tell that the label will be bringing some fantastic releases in the future.
