Hence the book’s title, which is meant to suggest not so much a double subject as a double approach to one subject—the expression, whether on the page or the screen, of certain significant themes, of certain ways of seeing and understanding. I have used the term “English” rather than “British” in the title partly because we still usually speak of English rather than British literature, but mostly because the screen works I consider, along with the literary works influencing or influenced by them, were in fact produced in England rather than in Scotland or Wales. A great many screen works are mentioned in the following pages; I examine a dozen or so at length, from Gracie Fields’s Look Up and Laugh in 1935 to Alan Bennett’s The History Boys in 2006. That examination, I have found, is obliged to take literary connections into account, some of the connections being obvious (The History Boys was a stage play before it was a fi lm), some not (Look Up and Laugh derives stylistic cues, as well as its screenplay, from the novelist J. B. Priestley). For all the distinctiveness of its visual and auditory operations, its purely cinematic qualities, English fi lming turns out to have a great deal to do with writing, especially English filming in the period of its greatest achievement. Michael Powell, a very literary filmmaker indeed, signaled as much with his 1944 fantasia A Canterbury Tale, a film with a Chaucerian title and vii\n\nviii\n\n·\n\nP r e fac e\n\na Kiplingesque village setting, with lettered signs in a bombed street, portentous inscriptions by a doorway, repeated close-ups of books on a study table. Readers of this book should be aware that it is a kind of close-up itself, a look at films sometimes shot by shot, or sound by sound. Many pages are devoted to careful formalist analysis, to the end of achieving a detailed understanding of what filmed sequences mean and how that meaning is conveyed—to the end, that is, of doing justice to works which have been written, photographed, and edited with a detailed genius—and ultimately to the end of gaining the greatest possible pleasure from them. I urge readers to compare my analyses against their own viewings of the sequences in question, just as they would read and think about quoted passages if this were a book on the twentiethcentury English novel. Neither literary contextualizing nor formalist analysis is particularly the method of film studies as currently practiced in the academy (though both are the methods of serious film reviewing), and for that reason I begin the book with a brief introduction setting forth arguments for proceeding in the way I do, taking as examples for analysis My Beautiful Laundrette and Sammy and Rosie Get Laid, two films with script by Hanif Kureishi and direction by Stephen Frears. I would never contend that mine is the only way to approach English screen works, only that it is a valid way, and I believe a rewarding way, given some oddities of the development of fi lm studies as a discipline, and given the richness of screen works which have received nothing like the attention due them. The Third Man has been analyzed to a fare-thee-well, but other ganglord-on-the-run fi lms, for example John Mackenzie’s The Long Good Friday, have not. Two of the works I focus on are not films at all, but television series written by Dennis Potter, Pennies from Heaven and The Singing Detective. My rationale for considering television together with film, in spite of the manifest differences (industrial, technical, budgetary) between the two media, is also given in the introduction. After the introduction, in a chapter largely historical in orientation, I look at two films from World War II, A Canterbury Tale and Humphrey Jennings’s avant-garde documentary Listen to Britain, both selected for their representative as well as their idiosyncratic quali-\n\nP r e fac e\n\n·\n\nix\n\nties. These are what-we-are-fighting-for works, only to be fully comprehended in a broader context of patriotic films and writings, as also in the pleasingly eccentric context of village pageants and wartime political shows, and finally in two seemingly opposed literary contexts, Kipling’s nostalgia and T. S. Eliot’s Modernism. The third chapter, focusing on genre, examines crime fi lms, chiefly because crime as a subject is linked so inextricably with a nation’s understanding of itself, its countenancing of certain kinds of violence and its insistence on certain forms of morality. I concentrate on a limited number of examples—among them No Orchids for Miss Blandish, Stormy Monday, The Long Good Friday, and Get Carter—particularly in their relation, imitative or combative, to American models. The main writer involved here is George Orwell, author of two important 1940s essays about crime, and the screen work considered at greatest length is The Singing Detective, in my view the culmination of a distinctively English tradition of domestic crime dramas. Following that, the fourth chapter considers literary adaptation— the most obvious sort of involvement of fi lm with writing. This is a topic much analyzed theoretically, but perhaps narrowly, with regard only to the transition from page to screen, its success or failure, its fidelity to or betrayal of an original. I am just as interested in the influence of screen on page, or more generally the intellectual entanglement of the two kinds of storytelling, and I examine that entanglement in the Merchant-Ivory Remains of the Day and in the 1985 BBC television serialization of Dickens’s Bleak House. The latter version stands as an exemplary visualization—a more exemplary visualization, in my view, than the BBC Bleak House of 2005—of Dickens’s fog-soaked images and as an enactment of his dark characterizations. The next chapter considers a technique—music in screen works. Here my examples are orchestral scores in older works like the famous Brief Encounter and the almost unknown The Captive Heart; upbeat production numbers in Look Up and Laugh; jazz in Look Back in Anger; popular songs in Pennies from Heaven and other Potter works; and a mixture of popular and classical music in two art-house fi lms by Terence Davies, Distant Voices, Still Lives and The Long Day Closes. What all these filmed performances have in common is summed up in a line from Noël Coward about the strange potency of cheap music—a\n\nx\n\n·\n\nP r e fac e\n\nmuch repeated cliché that finally has more to convey about the strangeness of musical effects than about their cheapness. In a conclusion, I follow the history of involvement between English writing and filming out to its late twentieth- and early twentyfirst-century culmination in the work of the poet Tony Harrison and the playwright Alan Bennett. Harrison’s “fi lm/poems,” like Prometheus or Crossings, a remake of the 1936 documentary Night Mail, merge writing and fi lming into what Harrison considers a thematic (and even rhythmic) hybrid form, while Bennett’s The History Boys, if demonstrating a more modest sort of hybridity, is nevertheless developed from an extraordinary range of dramatic, fi lmed, and televised productions. Twentieth-century English playwrights have routinely undertaken screen work (Coward, Tom Stoppard, Harold Pinter), but Bennett has done more than most, and been more influenced by the cinema and television—and for that reason he seems representative of where the national culture stands at this moment in its history. Dates given for English screen works are those of initial exhibition or broadcast in England; when possible, these have been taken from Denis Gifford’s British Film Catalogue, third edition (London and Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn, 2001). Dates of American or other screen works are as given in the Internet Movie Database (www.imdb.com). Quotations from dialogue are taken directly from soundtracks, not from published screenplays, unless otherwise specified. Bibliographical information for critical and biographical publications which I have consulted is given in the endnotes. Any American writing about modern English culture, in the form of its fi lms and television programs, ought to feel a decent sense of trepidation. I certainly do. No doubt I have misconstrued actions or phrases which English viewers would instantly comprehend, belabored the obvious, missed jokes, erred about a tone or two; in short, gotten things wrong. My rationale for proceeding anyway is that sometimes approaches from afar may be useful precisely because they come from afar, not from within. They engage with a subject freshly and curiously, are drawn to interesting details but also willing to generalize, with an outsider’s daringness. Joseph Losey (born La Crosse, Wisconsin) saw the English class system from afar and so was able to direct an extraor-\n\nP r e fac e\n\n·\n\nxi\n\ndinarily perceptive film about it, The Servant, admittedly with Robin Maugham’s novel and Harold Pinter’s screenplay to guide him. I have not emulated Losey’s creative achievement, of course, but at least been encouraged by his example. Such understanding of English screen culture as I have, I owe in part to my good fortune in being able to do research in England, particularly in the National Film Library at the British Film Institute in London, and in the BFI’s viewing facilities, where works from the National Film and Television Archive, otherwise unavailable, can be seen. I am grateful to many librarians and to staff at the BFI, Janet Moule and Kathleen Dickinson in particular, for their help. Smith College funded more than one research trip to London and made possible the writing of much of this book with the granting of a year’s leave from teaching. For that help, and for generosities extended by the associate provost, Charles Staelin, I am very thankful. Librarians at Neilson and Josten Libraries at Smith were unfailingly energetic in answering queries, obtaining books, and suggesting research tactics. It is a pleasure to thank them: Pamela Skinner, Robin Kinder, Sika Berger, Bruce Sadjak, Janet Spongberg. My Smith colleagues William Oram, Michael Gorra, Luc Gilleman, and Michael Thurston read portions of the text in draft and made helpful suggestions for revision, as did John C. Elder of Middlebury College. They were an ideal audience, the sort of readership every writer would wish to have—generous, encouraging, usefully finicky. My son Andrew Hunter gave last-minute research help. Pamela C. Hunter gave such spousal support and encouragement as made the long labor of writing a book tolerable. Finally, I am indebted to my Smith research assistants, especially Mia Cabana and Jill Testerman, and to the Smith students to whom I have taught British fi lm and television over a number of years. Naa-Adei Kotey, Noelle Lundgren, and Dawn Thornton in particular had good ideas and asked hard questions about the subject. This book is meant to give better, or at least more developed, answers than I was able to deliver on the spot. Lines from W. H. Auden, “Night Mail,” © 1938 by W. H.

If I resist calling screen works texts, however useful the term might be to others, it is because doing so would seem to me to obscure the ways in which films actually work—not textually, in the ordinary sense of the word, or not textually in the main, but rather with images, with sounds, with simultaneity of image and sound, with rapid transitions from image to image and from sound to sound, with (usually) spoken dramatic dialogue and visible gestures, with the enactment of action, with a host of conventions we have learned to interpret in the century of moving pictures’ existence; in short, with a language distinctive to itself. I can see why Dennis Potter once referred to his Pennies from Heaven as a “novel for television,” but without wanting to take anything away from that work’s ambitious scale and seriousness of purpose, or its fiction-like, ample characterizations, I would insist on noticing all the qualities that make it in fact what it is, a multi-part television series. It is, precisely, televisual—or cinematic even, though less cinematic than Potter’s other major screen work, The Singing Detective, for reasons to be explained in a later chapter.\n\n\n\n2\n\n·\n\nEnglish Filming, English Writing\n\nIn one obvious sense, of course, films do resemble texts. They are interpretable, and complex films are interpretable in the same way as complex texts. They invite an attentiveness to detail and require an ability to arrange details into whole impressions, and then they grant a complex pleasure. This pleasure is partly intellectual, that of successful comprehending, of following the convolutions (and the straightaways) of a discourse, but in my experience it is also aesthetic, the pleasure of following the convolutions (and the straightaways) of a carefully shaped work, one given coherence by its artfulness. Explicated, analyzed formally, taken apart into their constituent elements, as poems by Donne or Marvell used to be taken apart in the heyday of New Criticism in the 1950s and 1960s, screen works paradoxically seem more whole than ever. At least, that is the critical position which I take, and which has governed the chapters that follow. Unlike a deconstructionist (such as Catherine Belsey: the “object of the critic is to seek not the unity of the work, but the multiplicity and diversity of its possible meanings”), I am or attempt to be an assembler of parts into wholes. It is precisely the unity of a film or television series, even perhaps of a screen genre, which I am looking for. In a later chapter of this book, for example, I propose a single category (“domestic crime drama”) for many screen works, They Made Me a Fugitive and It Always Rains on Sunday, Traffik and Get Carter among them. Throughout the book, in discussions of individual fi lms, I seek to identify unifying themes and, especially, formal consistencies—the relations of one part to another and to the whole, the sense of proportion among parts, and the management of tone throughout. Formal consistency is not always fully achieved, of course; no one could turn They Made Me a Fugitive into an objet d’art as perfectly realized as the best poems of Donne or Marvell, and in the following pages I have had to acknowledge formal shortcomings when they are there on the screen to be seen. Nor is full-scale analysis always the way to get at formal consistency when it is achieved, especially when analysis marches straight through an entire film, scene by scene or shot by shot. I have avoided that kind of relentlessness, dealing more with sequences than with whole works. Serious criticism of the cinema in England has been practiced for seventy years or so (I am thinking of Charles Davy’s Footnotes to the Film, from 1938, as a starting point, followed shortly by Roger Man-\n\nI n t roduc t io n\n\n·\n\n3\n\nvell’s work in the 1940s), and in that time it might have been expected to give every significant screen work its aesthetic due, but that has not in fact happened. There is a backlog of works awaiting formalist appreciation. The reason is that such an appreciation requires seeing films carefully and repeatedly, in a way that was rarely possible until the spread of videocassette technology in the 1970s and 1980s, and which has now in the era of the DVD become even easier. But by the 1970s, film scholarship had begun to discount aesthetics and emphasize other matters. Its projects became highly theoretical, poststructuralist interrogations (films as sign-systems, fi lms as social codes), inquiries into industrial organization or cinema buildings or audience responses to fi lm, histories of genres, gender studies and queer studies, examinations of stardom, and above all the political contextualizing of film, the assessment of the cinema’s resistance to or acquiescence in, say, Tory policy under Margaret Thatcher. In other words, just when it became possible to watch the screen more closely than ever before, criticism tended to turn aside from close watching; away from a formalist interest in what exactly was happening on the screen, and away from the sorts of judgment—this film is worth watching, that one not—which generally accompany formalist criticism. This situation may now be beginning to change, for example with the arrival on the publishing scene of two different series of short critical books on individual films, several of which have an admirable care for aesthetic matters. Still, Peter Wollen, the British film critic and scholar prominent since the publication of his groundbreaking book Signs and Meaning in the Cinema in 1969, has recently counseled a rethinking of the aims of film criticism: As I read through copious new accounts of British studios or genres or periods or representations of gender or national identity, I begin to wonder where aesthetics fits into the agenda of research and rediscovery. Perhaps the point has come when we need to step back for a moment and make some broad judgements about British cinema, to look at it again as an art form. Which are the fi lms that really count, the fi lms we wouldn’t mind seeing again and again?\n\nThis appeal, especially coming from a figure like Wollen, seems worth paying attention to. I have tried to pay attention to it throughout this book.\n\n4\n\n·\n\nEnglish Filming, English Writing\n\nAmong “the films that really count” for many scholars (and ordinary viewers) is My Beautiful Laundrette, directed by Stephen Frears, written by Hanif Kureishi, and produced by Tim Bevan and Sarah Radclyffe. It was released in November, 1985, after two festival screenings. My Beautiful Laundrette excited interest for many reasons. Its frank sex scenes between the two main characters, the ex-punk Johnny and his boyhood friend Omar, a young Anglo-Pakistani, drew admiration from gays and alarmed vigilance from would-be censors. The fi lm depicts an arresting London, full of money and decay, with hustling Pakistani businessmen on one side and feckless white skinheads on the other. That is, it reconceives urban Englishness as a racially mixed, erotically charged, and economically determined state of being; as a condition of painful ambivalence (“this damned country, which we hate and love” says one immigrant); as a mode of life encompassing both violence and toleration, both cynicism and heartfelt commitment to “the new enterprise culture.” My Beautiful Laundrette thus lent itself to a wide variety of political or historical interpretations, with “The Empire strikes back” being the usual formulation of its politics. It was the first screenplay for Kureishi, who in 1985 was getting to be well known as a playwright (while revising My Beautiful Laundrette he was adapting Mother Courage for the Royal Shakespeare Company), and only the third featurelength directorial assignment, after Gumshoe and The Hit, for Frears, who had first served as assistant director for Lindsay Anderson, then established a considerable reputation in television. Let us take a look at a one short sequence from the fi lm, as an example of the treatment of many fi lm sequences in the pages to follow, and thus an introduction to the general critical method of the book. I will touch on theme, on the politics arising from theme, on fi lm history, and above all on aesthetics—fi lm “as an art form,” as Wollen says. After the close reading, and only after it, we will be able to move on to other considerations, such as the larger cultural context to which Kureishi and Frears’s film belongs. Almost at the end of My Beautiful Laundrette a young woman named Tania makes her exit from the plot. Tania is a highly modern and secularized Anglo-Pakistani, the daughter of Omar’s uncle Nasser and his aunt Bilquis, and so Omar’s cousin. In the view of the older generation, especially Omar’s vodka-soaked and despairing father, she ought by decent\n\nI n t roduc t io n\n\n·\n\n5\n\nfamily tradition to become his son’s wife. Omar drunkenly proposes to her, but he has committed himself fully to Johnny, as Tania has the intelligence to see, and besides Tania is attracted to Johnny, if she is attracted to any man. At the spiff y new laundrette she issues Johnny a teasing invitation (“I’m going, to live my life. You can come”), followed by a warning (her family will swallow him up “like a little kebab”), then strides out. A few moments of screen time later she departs for parts unknown by train, befitting the sense of restless movement—Pakistani travelers arriving from Heathrow with smuggled drugs, cars moving through dangerous, skinhead-infested construction sites, Johnny climbing in and out of squats, London visibly on its way to becoming something else—with which My Beautiful Laundrette is filled. Tania’s train station is visible from the meager balcony of Omar’s papa’s flat, a significant setting, in that it so much recalls the favorite mise-en-scène of 1950s or 1960s English films, domesticity linked with a tired industrialism, factory chimneys looming behind shabby rowhouses. The sky is gray (Frears liked shooting in February because in that month “England looked especially unpleasant”), and the grayness gives the balcony a monochrome dreariness. The balcony also looks cramped. Frears puts Papa and his successful brother Nasser in each other’s faces, framing them tightly, and allows their opening dialogue exchanges to be a little drowned out by train noises. In sum, the effect of the setting is to create a momentary pastiche of, and then show differences from, an older kind of filmmaking, namely the kitchen-sink realism of a Tony Richardson or a Karel Reisz. My Beautiful Laundrette is, let us say, a Saturday Night and Sunday Morning in which a wayward youth is finally not trapped into conformity by marriage with a beautiful young woman. (The filmmakers may have wanted to acknowledge this. In Karel Reisz’s 1960 fi lm, the young wife is played by Shirley Anne Field, who twenty-five years later played Rachel, Nasser’s English mistress, in My Beautiful Laundrette.) As Kureishi originally conceived it, Tania’s departure was to be conventionally filmed: A train is approaching, rushing towards Nasser. Suddenly it is passing him and for a moment, if this is technically possible, he sees Tania sitting reading in the train, her bag beside her. He cries out, but he is drowned out by the train.\n\n6\n\n·\n\nEnglish Filming, English Writing\n\nIf it is not possible for him to see her, then we go into the train with her and perhaps from her POV in the train look at the balcony, the two figures, at the back view of the flat passing by.\n\nIn the scene as actually shot, however, the handling is quite different. We glimpse Tania in a point-of-view shot from Papa and Nasser; she is standing with her suitcase on the distant station platform, wearing a chic and rebellious red scarf. Nasser calls out in surprise, but Tania fails to hear him, already being in departure mode. An Intercity express goes by fast in one direction, blocking his view of her, then another train equally fast in the other direction. Neither train stops or slows, but when the second has passed we see that Tania has vanished, as if by magic— gone off on her journey, presumably, but not in any way that makes realistic sense, not in any way that might have been photographed for Saturday Night and Sunday Morning. How do we explain this odd set-up? In production, it presumably saved money and time, but it also belongs to an overall conception. It seems to involve magic; so do other parts of the story—in keeping with “the tradition of magic realism associated with postcolonial literatures,” the jealous Bilquis gathers herbs, mutters arcanely over them, and so from afar gives her husband’s mistress Rachel a painful skin rash. Furthermore, Tania’s disappearance is cinematically cheeky, a way for the director to “say” something like “you know and I know that all we’re doing here is removing the character from the scene, so let’s not bother with a slowing train and a halt for passengers, etc., let’s just remove her as expeditiously as possible”; cheekiness runs all the way through My Beautiful Laundrette. As Leonard Quart has noted, the film disrupts our sense of order and affirms the value of spontaneity. As Christine Geraghty has noted, it conveys throughout a “sense of cinema as a place for the unexpected,” and it drew reviewers’ praise for being “entertaining, zany, fresh and quirky.” It is playful, allusive (a Bollywood poster stuck on a wall next to a Some Like It Hot poster), and provokingly mixed in tone: brutal violence comes out of nowhere, then suddenly stops, and seriousness gives way to farce, as when earlier in the film Tania bares her breasts at a party, to tease Omar, while “Rule, Britannia” in a back-beat version sounds on the house stereo system. In My Beautiful Laundrette a drug-dealer commands no more attention than a “fluff-drying spin-drier,” as Kureishi puts it in the screenplay. Both\n\nI n t roduc t io n\n\n·\n\n7\n\nwriter and director obviously wanted their fi lm to amuse, to employ the “modern mode” of irony in order to comment on “bleakness and cruelty without falling into dourness and didacticism.” It is a sad irony, admittedly, which caps Tania’s exit. Just before she appears on the platform Papa has said something wistful about his son’s marriage and asked if Tania is a possibility, to which Nasser nods yes, enthusiastically and unconvincingly; but then her sudden and total disappearance makes her an obvious impossibility, and sends Papa glumly back to the bottle. By exiting, Papa ends the scene, after having begun it with his entrance onto the balcony, though the first thing we actually see is the window beside the balcony door: a match to the laundrette window through which the immediately preceding shot has been framed. A few seconds after the entrance, Frears—or the film’s editor, Mick Audsley— matches shots in the direction of Tania’s train station with reverse shots in the direction of Nasser’s disbelieving face; both perspectives include out-of-focus, fast-moving trains, in the foreground and in the background respectively. The spatial organization of the scene is in fact a little hard to read, a little disorienting, but the fi lmmakers seem to have accepted disorientation as the price of filling this minute of screen time with balanced visuals and symmetrical movements (all told, we see six trains in motion, three from left to right, three from right to left). In other words the scene has a careful design of its own, something tidy and predictable to set against the strangeness of Tania’s unaccountable disappearance. This design is unobtrusive. It does not get in the way of the natural-looking staging (train sounds make Nasser and Papa turn their heads toward the tracks, the camera follows the turn in a gentle pan and then continues on to what they are seeing) or of the dialogue. It does not fully compensate for the unpleasantness of February and the shabbiness of the setting. But the design is there in the sequence. To a film which after all has the word “beautiful” in the title it contributes a touch of pleasing orderliness, a modest cinematic beauty. The funds to make My Beautiful Laundrette came from television, the Channel 4 program Film on Four. Shot inexpensively on 16mm film and originally intended for broadcast, Frears’s and Kureishi’s film was only later released theatrically, after its success at the Edinburgh Festival. Film on Four financing was essential to many other successful\n\n8\n\n·\n\nEnglish Filming, English Writing\n\nfilms; in the early 1980s alone it produced such works as Prick Up Your Ears, Experience Preferred, But Not Essential, The Ploughman’s Lunch, Dance with a Stranger, A Private Function, and Letter to Brezhnev. And the involvement of television with independent filmmaking has not been merely financial. Filmmakers and scriptwriters have been profoundly influenced by work seen on the small screen. Kureishi specifically acknowledged his indebtedness to television writers like Alan Bennett, Dennis Potter, Alan Plater, and David Mercer, most of them authors of scripts for the famous BBC series Play for Today. Stephen Frears, who got his directorial start with Film on Four, was no less indebted to the medium. These are all reasons why in this book I have followed an emerging trend in current academic criticism and written about television together with film—the practice, for example, of the gathering of essays in The Cambridge Companion to Literature on Screen, edited by Deborah Cartmell and Imelda Whelehan. To older analysts, the differences between the industrial organizations of the two media (or between their budgetary resources, or their technical capacities) were paramount. Even so fine and generous-minded a critic as Penelope Houston, writing in 1984, felt a sharp sense of these differences. She approved of Channel 4 financing projects but thought there were still distinctions to be made between television and the “movie movie,” which enjoyed “not only a wider vitality but the power to probe more deeply . . . there are crucial aesthetic differences, as well as differences in the quality of the experience . . .” To me, however, the commonalities of the two media seem much more striking, their aesthetic ambitions and achievements—especially in the years since 1984—fully comparable, and accordingly I have discussed them as related components of a national screen culture. Did it matter to viewers in the 1980s if they saw My Beautiful Laundrette on a cinema screen or a television screen? Is there any significant difference, artistically speaking, between Tania’s disappearance in the Frears-Kureishi film and an equally magic disappearance which figures, as we will see, in one of the scenes of Dennis Potter’s television series The Singing Detective—two coal-miners in a working men’s club, at first firmly in place and looking enigmatically at the protagonist, then a second later not there at all? Is there any significant difference between the tricks played with windows and mirrors, the coinciding of images or dis-\n\nI n t roduc t io n\n\n·\n\n9\n\nsolving of face into face, which feature prominently in both My Beautiful Laundrette and A Question of Attribution, Alan Bennett’s television drama of 1992? It seems to me that answers to questions like these should be sought not generally or theoretically, but in the kind of analysis that looks closely at particular films and television dramas, and at films and television dramas comparatively. At any rate that is how I have sought answers. In doing so, the one attitude toward television drama which I have flatly rejected, and which I hope all serious critics would reject, is simple snobbery: the disdain for the broadcast medium perfectly captured in the comment (by a literary agent): “What do you expect, darling? After all, small screens, small minds . . .” Film studies has tended from the start to disregard involvements of another sort, not of cinema with television, but of cinema with literature. As the distinguished cultural critic Raymond Williams observed in 1983, the young discipline wanted to draw “a hard line around the separated subject of fi lm,” defiantly rejecting the idea that theatre or literature could have anything significant to do with it, or claiming indeed that theatre and literature, if admitted to consideration, might have “diluted or destroyed the pure essence of ‘Film’ . . . then not a name for a body of actual practice and works but an idealized projection of supposedly pure and inherent properties.” A prominent current practitioner from within the field, Andrew Higson, has sketched the same history: film studies “established itself as a distinct discipline precisely by breaking away from respectable middle-class English literary culture, by celebrating the central texts of political modernism, by exploring what was seen as the specifically filmic, and by embracing popular culture.” This sort of intellectual exclusivity is an understandable phenomenon, part of the process which new disciplines invariably undergo as they circumscribe their subject areas and define their methods rigorously, ruthlessly even, against those of older and rival disciplines. And it has in some ways been a beneficial phenomenon. To learn how screen works are “specifically filmic” has been no mean or unimportant task. But intellectual exclusivity in the study of film has by now become a serious limitation in approach and a distortion of the subject, especially when, having trickled downward to the level of reviewing, it produces prejudicial misjudgments—say, condemnations of this or that English\n\n10\n\n·\n\nEnglish Filming, English Writing\n\nfilm, or possibly even the whole of the English cinema, for being worddriven, “literate,” derived from some written source which allegedly has left its anti-visual (and “elitist”) traces on the screen. Here too, as with aesthetic concerns, attitudes in fi lm studies are changing. In recent years a less purist, more comparative approach has arisen, producing, for example, discussions (by Wendy Everett) of the influence of T. S. Eliot’s poetry on the cinema of Terence Davies; of analogies between seventeenth-century revenge drama and Mike Hodges’ gangster film Get Carter, with the hard man Carter viewed as an avatar of the malcontents of those dramas (Steve Chibnall); of stylistic resemblances between Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger’s 1946 melodrama A Matter of Life and Death and the Jacobean court masque, two forms of spectacle comparable in the way they combine “verse drama, dance, music, scenery and costume” (Ian Christie); of the pastoral elements shared between Powell and Pressburger’s A Canterbury Tale and Georgian poets like Rupert Brooke and Edward Thomas (Andrew Moor). In the case of A Matter of Life and Death, the yawning historical gap between World War II and Renaissance dramatic poetry might seem too great for even ingenious scholarship to bridge, but the fact is that Powell and Pressburger do some bridging of cinema and literature themselves. Consider the way their films often feature autocratic, action-provoking, visually creative, waywardly brilliant characters—in short, director figures, versions of Michael Powell; there is a particularly complex example in A Canterbury Tale, as we will see. Early on in A Matter of Life and Death, one of these directorial types, a famous consulting neurologist named Reeves, goes to his specially constructed camera obscura and in the oval mirror of its darkened chamber observes street life in his village, musing aloud about what he sees. In doing this, he is visibly acting like a filmmaker, perhaps a documentarian like Humphrey Jennings. After all, what is a filmmaker but a watcher of life through a mechanooptical apparatus, a connoisseur of moving images and a commentator on the meaning of those images? In his mirror Doctor Reeves watches June, a pretty American radio operator, approach, and if a Jacobean court masque does not come to his mind at this moment, Byron’s love poetry does. He murmurs “She walks in beauty, like the night . . .” in appreciation. Conversation ensues:\n\nI n t roduc t io n\n\n·\n\n11\n\nJune Surveying your kingdom? Reeves A village doctor has to know everything. You’d be surprised how many diagnoses I’ve formed up here. June I love looking at the village from here. Looks so different! Reeves (Laughs) That’s because you see it all clearly and at once, as in a poet’s eye . . .\n\nFrom camera obscura operator to fi lmmaker to poet: there is a straight line connecting all these creators, as Powell and Pressburger would have us believe. What this moment of A Matter of Life and Death hints at, what critics like Everett, Chibnall, Christie, and Moor are responding to in their various ways, and what in this book I have undertaken to examine, are elemental qualities of English culture—its distinctive regard for the past, the pleasure it takes in continuities and reworkings, its resistance to creative specializations, its talent for collaborations, and especially the complex interrelatedness, in the twentieth century, of its major forms of expression. A Matter of Life and Death and A Canterbury Tale could not have been produced without the English books which furnished Michael Powell’s and Emeric Pressburger’s imaginations. To that extent, these two filmmakers are poets, or readers of poetry at least. Nor could The Singing Detective have been produced without books. Potter’s television drama is the fusion of Raymond Chandler detective novels with Joycean verbal pyrotechnics and with the biblical description of Eden. One may also come at the interrelatedness in the other direction. Philip Larkin’s poem “Faith Healing,” a meditation on sufferers from disease who file forward at a revival meeting to be blessed, could not have been written without the film documentary which put those sufferers before Larkin’s skeptical gaze. Nor could Larkin’s even betterknown “The Whitsun Weddings” have been written without a film. In this 1958 poem about just-married provincial couples taking the train into London for the start of their lives together, the poet derived the extraordinary image of his last stanza, We slowed again, And as the tightened brakes took hold, there swelled A sense of falling, like an arrow-shower Sent out of sight, somewhere becoming rain,\n\n12\n\n·\n\nEnglish Filming, English Writing\n\nfrom the arrows launched into the sky in the Agincourt scene of Laurence Olivier’s filmed Henry V. In an act of the imagination which no one could have predicted, precisely, but which nevertheless seems fully understandable, the sturdy combativeness of English yeomen becomes, centuries later, the poet’s cautious hope for renewal and regeneration. For Larkin, it is a plain matter of fact that the English cultural landscape includes film as well as literature, just as the literal landscapes—such as are scanned through the train windows by the bridal couples in “The Whitsun Weddings”—include cinemas along with other emblems of Englishness: A dozen marriages got under way. They watched the landscape, sitting side by side —An Odeon went past, a cooling tower, And someone running up to bowl . . .\n\nA whole history of direct influences from English film to literature and from English literature to film might be written, and to accompany it a history of other kinds of indirect involvement, such as the collaboration of writers and filmmakers, the employment of analogous themes or styles, and the straying of apparently purely literary types into the film world. Rudyard Kipling was one such type. His short story “Mrs. Bathurst” (1904) marks the entrance of the newly invented “cinematograph” into serious English fiction, the cinematograph here, projected on to the “big magic lantern sheet” of a variety program, capturing the arrival of the Western Mail in Paddington Station: First we saw the platform empty an’ the porters standin’ by. Then the engine come in, head on, an’ the women in the front row jumped: she headed so straight. Then the doors opened and the passengers came out and the porters got the luggage—just like life. Only—only when any one came down too far towards us that was watchin’, they walked right out o’ the picture, so to speak. I was ’ighly interested, I can tell you.\n\nTwo decades later Kipling got into the business himself, to the extent of co-writing the original scenario for a documentary called One Family, the first venture of the Empire Marketing Board into filmmaking. Some of Kipling’s literary successors would be much more involved in the film world, creating, for example, a whole subgenre of satirical novels on the movie business. There are examples by Anthony Powell (At Lady\n\nI n t roduc t io n\n\n·\n\n13\n\nMolly’s), John Mortimer (Charade), Christopher Isherwood (Prater Violet), and J. B. Priestley (Bright Day)—novels in some cases penned immediately after their authors had themselves strayed into film-studio work and based on the painful or enlightening experience gained there. For his part, the film director Bryan Forbes, who in the 1960s made Whistle Down the Wind, The L-Shaped Room, and Séance on a Wet Afternoon, strayed into literature with his 1972 novel The Distant Laughter, about an embittered 1960s director of films. If the English cinema has for long been engaged in a back-and-forth with English literature, it is so in part because of the bookish twentiethcentury society the cinema reflects. The tokens of bookishness are often enough to be seen in fi lms’ mises-en-scène—volumes lying on a study table, or being read by weary Londoners in wartime documentaries, or for sale in one of the market stalls of Gracie Fields’s musical Look Up and Laugh, a film which, incidentally, could scarcely have been made without the prior example of J. B. Priestley’s novel The Good Companions. In the Merchant-Ivory The Remains of the Day (itself, of course, the film adaptation of a novel), Stevens the butler reads an old-fashioned romance novel and then, when the woman he secretly loves walks in, clutches the book to his heart. Neatly ranged books line the walls of the “library,” the fireplace-lighted, middle-class room to which Laura Jesson and her husband Fred retreat in the most iconic English film of all, David Lean’s Brief Encounter, the screen version, it will be remembered, of a Noël Coward play. Brief Encounter captures suburban England at the precise moment of its cultural history when its inhabitants feel equally devoted to the old medium of books and the new medium of films. Laura regularly visits the cinema. After a lunch with her intriguing new friend Alec Harvey, she goes with him there for a matinee: Laura We have two choices—The Loves of Cardinal Richelieu at the Palace, or Love in a Mist at the Palladium. Alec You’re very knowledgeable . . .\n\nThey watch Love in a Mist, preceded by the trailer for the laughably exotic Flames of Passion, then a week later Flames of Passion itself, or part of it, walking out in disgust at its absurdity. However, in the midst of all this film-going Laura is apparently no less regular in her visits to the\n\n14\n\n·\n\nEnglish Filming, English Writing\n\nlending library at Boots. The critic Richard Dyer has written about the women’s fiction someone like Laura might be expected to borrow there, and about parallels between that fiction and Brief Encounter. Back in the book-lined library of their home, when Fred is doing the crossword and asks Laura (“You’re a poetry addict”) to supply the missing word in the verse line “Huge cloudy symbols of a high . . . ,” she knows her Keats well enough to say, with a puzzled frown, “romance,” and to refer him to The Oxford Book of English Verse. Cinema-going and book-reading feature no less prominently in the cultural background of The Third Man, made two years after Brief Encounter. In Carol Reed’s fi lm, with its script by the novelist Graham Greene, Holly Martins and Anna Schmidt hide from police pursuit in a movie theatre—taking to a melodramatic extreme, one might say, the escapism offered by such places. Later, the English military policemen of the story discuss Martins’s cheap novelettes, Death at Double X Ranch, The Lone Rider of Santa Fe. Sergeant Paine likes a good Western, while Major Calloway in his tough urban way despises them, for their outworn sentiments, for their belief in lone-riding kinds of justice. Five decades after these two films, one of Mike Leigh’s melancholy comedies, Career Girls, examines a very different cultural world, one where books now seem to matter less than rock groups and are useful only in solacing a character’s loneliness. But in a scene or two even Career Girls showcases one book, Wuthering Heights, consulted as an oracle by the main characters in their scruff y undergraduate digs. “Ms. Brontë, Ms. Brontë, will I find a fellow soon?” they ask ritualistically, then in a bedsit version of the Sortes Virgilianae they open the novel at random for an answer, investing the old Penguin Classics paperback with a lingering magic value. That Wuthering Heights occupies some sort of niche in contemporary culture might seem anomalous enough, but consider the presence of an equally classic text in a fi lm made exactly a decade before Career Girls, Sammy and Rosie Get Laid, the second of the Kureishi-Frears collaborations. This text is T. S. Eliot’s The Waste Land, neatly inscribed in black letters on the white-painted side of a caravan parked under a west London motorway—pages of the poem enlarged and published as it were in twentieth-century broadside form. To the caravan the black man Danny and the married white social worker Rosie repair, intent\n\nI n t roduc t io n\n\n·\n\n15\n\non sex. They enter, passing Eliot’s solemn Tarot-deck-reading mumbojumbo (“I do not find / The Hanged Man”), and make passionate love, while outside, strolling musicians, the “Ghetto-lites,” serenade the union with a dance routine and a miming of Otis Redding’s 1965 hit “My Girl.” This is the notorious moment of cinematic ecstasy in Sammy and Rosie Get Laid when not just Danny and Rosie but the other interracial and passionate couples of the film, Anna and Sammy, Rafi and Alice, make love, with the screen momentarily splitting into three horizontal segments to accommodate their simultaneous climaxes. Under that motorway, Danny’s caravan is parked in an encampment of anarchists moving about in free-spirited dress, a tutu worn with combat boots, an academic get-up complete with mortarboard, several ostentatiously befrogged military jackets. There are also a roving jazz band and a chess game played with oversized, abstract-art pieces. In short, we are shown a visual farrago, as is true of the fi lm generally. Earlier, a poster of Virginia Woolf depicts the novelist gazing sadly at a London coming apart into social violence—riots in the street, police crackdowns, crazies in the Tube, homeless people huddled in their cardboard shelters—not to mention into aesthetic chaos: Sammy eats fast food while snorting cocaine and simultaneously listening to Schubert’s “Erlkönig” on his headphones. In all of this, The Waste Land might be thought only one more random element, a meaningless bit of high-toned décor, and yet on the screen it seems meaningful, more than a token of superannuated literariness. The film insists on our noticing the poem, and even on our reading it; the quotations on the caravan are invitingly clear. Is it Hanif Kurieshi who is doing the inviting? He is certainly a literary kind of screenwriter, well educated, well read, the author of plays and prose journalism as well as film scripts. It is significant that he saw to the publication in book form of the scripts for both My Beautiful Laundrette and Sammy and Rosie Get Laid, together with an introduction for the first and a production diary for the second. So published, these texts beg for comparison with other texts. They assume a place in a recognized category of fictions, both reportorial and autobiographical, about London immigrants and London anger—novels by Doris Lessing in the 1960s (The Golden Notebook), by Margaret Drabble in the 1980s (The Middle Ground), by Zadie Smith and Monica Ali in the first decade\n\n16\n\n·\n\nEnglish Filming, English Writing\n\nof the twenty-first century (White Teeth, Brick Lane). A more direct contribution to this category would be Kureishi’s 1990 novel The Buddha of Suburbia, later to be adapted in its turn for a 1993 BBC miniseries. In other words, Kureishi purposely aligns himself with fellow authors. The “best screenplays,” he has said, “are not written by people who call themselves screenwriters, but by good writers, writers who excel in other forms. . . . the substance of a decent screenplay, character, story, mood, pace, can only come from a cultivated imagination.” It is such a cultivated imagination which puts into the published screenplay for Sammy and Rosie one allusion to Dickens’s Miss Havisham, a second to Flaubert’s Sentimental Education, from which Kureishi concedes he has lifted a scene involving an older woman’s letting down her white hair. Apropos of a lesbian kiss in the film, Kureishi, no less poetryminded than Doctor Reeves in A Matter of Life and Death, quotes Byron’s Don Juan, Each kiss a heart-quake,—for a kiss’s strength I think it must be reckon’d by its length,\n\nand he writes dialogue which if not Byronic and poetic is at least epigrammatic and literary. As for that anarchist encampment, the published screenplay renders its disorder in a collage style belonging as much to prose-poetry as to stage direction: Next to one fire, on a crate, is a huge TV which the kids watch. On TV a headless man reads the news. . . . Nearby, two cars are half buried in the mud, as if they plunged over the rim of the motorway and nose-dived into the ground. A huge red Indian totem pole sticks up into the sky. A swing hangs down from under the motorway. A kid swings in it.\n\nThroughout the screenplay Kureishi calls the encampment “waste ground”—but otherwise he makes no reference to Eliot or the quotations from The Waste Land. The caravan texts might not in fact have originated with Kureishi, but been the contribution of the art director David McHenry or the improvisation of a set dresser. Whatever their actual origin, they seem ultimately to come from the whole social and aesthetic world which the film creates. It is a particular 1987 London milieu, full of intellection and dismay, which Sammy and Rosie reproduces, and within this milieu dwell cultivated, ironic, bookish, and occasionally\n\nI n t roduc t io n\n\n·\n\n17\n\ndespairing characters not unlike Kureishi himself. Danny keeps a row or two of books in the caravan (the published screenplay pictures him as lying naked on his bed, reading a paperback, under pictures of Gandhi, Tolstoy, and Martin Luther King), but as London goes up in flames outside, the books do not appear to help him decide between angry rioting and standing peaceably by. The discontented Alice is described as having Jane Austen novels beside her bed. Meanwhile, many shelves of paperbacks are visible in Sammy and Rosie’s flat, and a tattered copy of Raymond Chandler’s The Long Goodbye appears in close-up as husband and wife dispute which of them owns what volumes. Sammy and Rosie like to chaff each other about authors: “If you had to choose between sleeping with George Eliot or Virginia Woolf, who would you choose?” “Virginia,” Sammy says, “on looks alone,” then asks Rosie to make a similar choice between De Gaulle or Churchill. In a montage of intellectual London activities—this is an homage to Woody Allen as montagiste of Manhattan—Sammy speaks of going to special bookstores to buy novels written by women, of attending plays at the Royal Court if they have been well reviewed by the Guardian, or sitting in on evening seminars on semiotics. Some of this intellectual activity may be satirized in the film (Sammy is ironic as he voices the montage), but it is undeniably a part of Kureishi’s overall conception, referred to constantly in the dialogue and made visible in the furnishings of the mise-en-scène. And in this conception, T. S. Eliot and The Waste Land have parts to play—so much so that a full discussion of Sammy and Rosie Get Laid, fuller than I can give here, would have to address the allusion in all its complexity. I can at least sketch the outline of an interpretation. Eliot would seem to be a looming presence in the film, an outsider whose acculturation to England, like Kureishi’s, involves both the sense of belonging and the sense of detachment. Quoted on the side of Danny’s caravan, lines from Eliot’s great poem serve to recollect an earlier period of English intellection and dismay, just as the dour prophets quoted in The Waste Land itself give monitory lessons about the past to a 1922 full of confusion. Surreal touches, sudden transformations and shock cuts, high-toned speeches next to popular songs, ironies in the “modern mode,” a society shown to be sick with competing ideologies, sexual longing combined with sexual malaise, traditions broken or defaced but\n\n18\n\n·\n\nEnglish Filming, English Writing\n\nsomehow vestigially there and rebuking the present—what does this description of Sammy and Rosie sound like but The Waste Land? In the film, there is a threatening ghost; specters also haunt the poem. Both works touch on the playing of a game of chess. Anna the photographer is planning an exhibition to be called “Images of a Decaying Europe,” which would have served Eliot well as a subtitle. Rafi brings an Asian perspective to bear on contemporary London, along with some lines of Punjabi; Eliot looks east for moral principles (Datta, Dayadhvam, Damyata) expressed in Sanskrit. In Kureishi’s city, violence seems to be coming from the periphery to the center, ever closer, ever more threateningly; so too with Eliot’s nightmarish view of “hooded hordes swarming / Over endless plains” towards a city of angry voices and falling towers. Coincidentally, it is even possible, as Hugh Kenner suggested, that those hooded hordes derive from crowds which Eliot saw in World War I newsreels: films influence a poem which in turn influences a film. . . . In the end, there would be a good deal to say about two parallel visions of urban life, that of The Waste Land and that of Sammy and Rosie Get Laid; something to say as well about the subject I will address throughout this book, the significance of context, the forming of a common culture, the contiguities of English fi lming and English writing. If finally I do not think screen works should be called texts, I believe absolutely that screen works and texts have to be discussed together.\n\none WARTIME PAGEANTRY\n\nThis late afternoon I sit & think of you & hear for you the sounds of English summer: the buzz of the fly against the window pane—the bees in the sun—the curious whine of the Spitfire high up in the blue—the children shouting away down the valley. Humphrey Jennings\n\nThree-quarters of the way through Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger’s 1944 film A Canterbury Tale, the main characters find themselves on top of a windswept hill. Six centuries before, it was a vantage point on the Pilgrim’s Way and gave travelers their first glimpse of Canterbury and its cathedral in the distance. Now, towards the end of the Second World War, it affords these new pilgrims equally sweeping views. Back and down to the Kentish countryside where the characters have been plotting and counter-plotting, ahead to the city or up to the sky: at Powell’s direction the camera turns every which way, sometimes getting right down next to the characters beside the blackberry bushes or in the long grass, sometimes taking them in from afar, to emphasize their littleness against the landscape. With each point-of-view shot or pan, the film comprehends more of the country. With its restless energy and its commanding if vague sense of uplift, this scene belongs precisely to the historical moment in which it was created, and contributes to the public rhetoric of that moment. It offers \n\n20\n\n·\n\nEnglish Filming, English Writing\n\nas a visible prize the metaphorical landscape which Winston Churchill had promised in the most famous of all his wartime orations: The whole fury and might of the enemy must very soon be turned on us. Hitler knows that he will have to break us in this Island or lose the war. If we can stand up to him, all Europe may be free and the life of the world may move forward into broad, sunlit uplands.\n\nBut the scene also looks forward to what would become a cliché in postwar English filmmaking—namely, the pastoral escape, when characters go for a walk up the local hill, gain some distance on whatever slum or bourgeois semi-detached existence is entrapping them, and then scan the view with their understandings temporarily liberated (there is a particularly clear example in Tony Richardson’s A Taste of Honey, from 1961). Equally, the hilltop scene looks backward to the elevated panoramas of early twentieth-century English writing. That is, Powell and Pressburger replicate in their film the overviews imagined in Thomas Hardy’s epic poem The Dynasts, or the airborne surveys made from a primitive flying machine in H. G. Wells’s novel Tono-Bungay. Or the moment in E. M. Forster’s Howards End when the novelist turns essayist and displays his country from a hilltop: If one wanted to show a foreigner England, perhaps the wisest course would be to take him to the fi nal section of the Purbeck Hills, and stand him on their summit, a few miles to the east of Corfe. Then system after system of our island would roll together under his feet. Beneath him is the valley of the Frome, and all the wild lands that come tossing down from Dorchester . . . the Stour, sliding out of fat fields, to marry the Avon beneath the tower of Christchurch. . . . Salisbury Plain itself . . . Nor is Suburbia absent. Bournemouth’s ignoble coast cowers to the right . . . red houses and the Stock Exchange . . . Southampton, hostess to the nations . . . How many villages appear in this view! How many castles! How many churches, vanished or triumphant! . . . What incredible variety of men working beneath that lucent sky to what final end!\n\nForster inspects vastly more territory than Powell and Pressburger do, and advances the forthright opinions (“ignoble,” “cowers”) which the film medium can convey only by indirection. Still, the writer and the filmmakers are working beneath the same lucent sky and noticing the\n\nWa rt i m e Pag e a n t ry\n\n·\n\n21\n\nsame details: a river valley, fat fields, a cathedral enacting the part of church triumphant. And the writer and the filmmakers are working to approximately the same end. At this key moment of their fictions they are presenting England visually, as an imagined whole, so that it may be properly valued, and thereafter inherited by those who seem best stewards of it (Howards End) or who are most willing to join in its traditions (A Canterbury Tale). A Canterbury Tale is a film of audacious, screen-fi lling images— “cast your eye on that noble prospect,” says the American sergeant in it, pointing to Canterbury Cathedral standing in the distance, surrounded by barrage balloons—and of some silly plot turns. It solves a series of minor crimes but leaves greater mysteries intact. In dramatizing a communal, allied-for-the-duration theme it recalls a number of other English wartime fi lms, but also stands deliberately apart from them; it takes chances, makes mistakes, improvises solutions. The critics who saw it on its release treated it with cautious respect that turned quickly into bafflement (“remarkable . . . authentic . . . odd . . . untidy . . . queer . . . bewildering”), and in spite of recent critical rehabilitations it still raises questions. In other words, it is like the England of Forster’s passage, seen from afar; it stands in need of proper valuing. What does that valuing entail? In the first place, finding a place for A Canterbury Tale in the cinematic culture of the 1940s, the sum total of fi lms seen and screenplays read by Powell and Pressburger. Throughout their distinguished seventeen-year collaboration, these two filmmakers—“the Archers”—indisputably regarded themselves as being in and of this culture. The cinema shaped their understanding and ambition and gave them successes to imitate or failures to learn from (films in both categories were to hand for the shaping of A Canterbury Tale). The cinema also schooled them in what could be communicated to filmgoers by photography and a soundtrack: Canterbury glimpsed through a curtain of waving grass blades on the hillside, the laughter of a fourteenth-century pilgrimage suddenly sounding in an astonished land girl’s ear, and much else in A Canterbury Tale which, as we will find, requires a close examination, if only to do justice to its makers’ specifically cinematic workmanship. But Powell and Pressburger also created films within a larger culture. Their filmmaking was profoundly influenced by a sensibility formed by\n\n22\n\n·\n\nEnglish Filming, English Writing\n\nbooks, as the similarity of the hilltop scenes in Howards End and A Canterbury Tale suggests. As it happened, neither filmmaker ever declared an affi liation with Forster, but about other literary inspirations Powell in particular was emphatic. “Bunyan and Kipling have conducted me all my life, and they will conduct me into the other world, or that part of it reserved for me.” Early in life, he was devoted to contemporary fiction: “every penny went on little editions of G. K. Chesterton, Hilaire Belloc and H. G. Wells, who, excitingly, was a fellow inhabitant of Hythe and could be seen cycling through the lanes of Romney Marsh, perhaps to call on Henry James at Rye, or on Joseph Conrad at his farmhouse.” Later, the film business seemed to Powell no different from “ordinary story telling or writing plays”; one reason for his liking Kipling was that a Kipling character declared that “all art is one.” If we are to make any real sense of A Canterbury Tale, we will have to examine this aspect of it too: its unusual bookishness, its tendency to focus (sometimes in a strictly literal way) on texts of all sorts, of which Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales is only the most obvious example. Making sense of the film will, in turn, lead to an awareness of how it belongs to a wider national context, how it is accompanied along the way to its hopeful and eccentric conclusion by a whole panoply of cultural productions which attempted to define Englishness and make Englishness seem worth defending in wartime. Constituting this panoply are pamphlets and narratives, anthologies and George Orwell essays, historical-political pageants put on by villages, and especially Humphrey Jennings’s film documentary Listen to Britain, A Canterbury Tale’s only real rival in cinematic bookishness and sophistication.\n\nThe Archers on Pilgrimage The Archers famously insisted that their work be seen as fully collaborative. “Written, Produced, and Directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger,” the final line in the credits always ran, and there is much evidence of extensive consultation between them before and during production. One of the best wartime film critics, Richard Winnington, thought their collaboration made possible the “only consistent unification of script, production and direction in British films.” In actual prac-\n\nWa rt i m e Pag e a n t ry\n\n·\n\n23\n\ntice, however, Powell was clearly responsible for directing, Pressburger for scriptwriting, or more exactly for writing a basic draft which would be rewritten by both collaborators, alternately or together. As Pressburger remembered it, A Canterbury Tale was conceived, prosaically enough, in a car, where he and Powell had escaped to gain some privacy during the shooting of their 1942 behind-the-enemy-lines thriller One of Our Aircraft Is Missing. They started chatting: “I said to Michael, ‘There is so much talk about the country and the people, about protecting the women and children, but who is going to think about the human values—the values that we are fighting for?’ And we sat there and Michael said: ‘That should be our next film.’” From the start, then, A Canterbury Tale was meant to stand somewhat apart from the war and its propaganda, including the cinematic propaganda of such prior Archers productions as the The Lion Has Wings (1939), the fiveminute short An Airman’s Letter to his Mother (1941), and the Nazihunting thriller 49th Parallel (1941). A Canterbury Tale would also depart from the scale, and the color cinematography, to which the Archers were committed in the film which actually came next after One of Our Aircraft Is Missing—The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (1943), a historical saga bringing David Low’s famous cartoon figure to the screen, involving him with an eternal-feminine character played by Deborah Kerr, and putting him into semi-comical conflict with the urgencies of modern Total War. A Canterbury Tale, like the Archers’ Highlands romance I Know Where I’m Going (1945), with which it has a great deal in common, would be intimate, photographed in black-and-white, in a “less combative register,” and far more localized. Though not propaganda, A Canterbury Tale could contribute to an important category of cultural work by teaching traditions, and so confirm everyone’s sense of nationhood at the moment it was undergoing attack. This work, the discursive equivalent of panoramic views from hilltops, took many different forms in the 1940s, including the publication of histories like Arthur Bryant’s English Saga (1941), Sir Ernest Barker’s Britain and the British People (1942), and G. M. Trevelyan’s English Social History (1944), or of more specialized studies like the illustrated volumes in the Britain in Pictures series (1941–1945)—British Education, British Ships and British Seamen, The Englishwoman, and so on.\n\n24\n\n·\n\nEnglish Filming, English Writing\n\nT. S. Eliot contributed to the cause an unusually straightforward and patriotic poem, “Defense of the Islands,” asking that “memorials of built stone” and “music’s enduring instrument” be enlisted to say to . . . the past and the future generations of our kin and of our speech, that we took up our positions . . .\n\nFalling into a considerably odder, more Archers-like category is Francis Brett Young’s The Island (1944), another history of the nation begun in the “distressful days” of 1939, “when the very existence of Britain was imperiled,” but this time a book-length history in verse, with changing poetic modes to describe different eras of the past: alliterative lines for the Anglo-Saxons, a poetic drama for the Renaissance, and so on. Young’s historical sweep and nearly hysterical patriotism allow him to figure RAF pilots as having in their blood the valor of Drake and Hawkins, or The fierce ancestral strains Of Caradoc’s charioteers, who never quailed Before Rome’s armoured legions . . .\n\nPatriotic anthologies were even more characteristic of and copiously produced in the period, some examples being J. B. Priestley’s Our Nation’s Heritage (1939), Collie Knox’s For Ever England (1943), and Clemence Dane’s quintessential period piece The Shelter Book (“A gathering of tales, poems, essays, notes and notions for use in shelters, tubes, basements and cellars”; 1940). The new Archers fi lm would work in comradely solidarity with all these publications but still have to be a fictional narrative, not historical discourse or a compilation. What about a Shakespeare film? Powell and Dane had met in early 1941 to talk about a possible script, but nothing came of this. Or a screen version of The Pilgrim’s Progress? In spite of Powell’s veneration of Bunyan, Pressburger ultimately doubted the “filmic potential” of Christian allegory and decided on a story of his own, more up to date but still historically minded; current events seen in the long perspective of time. In later years Pressburger thought A Canterbury Tale the Archers film that was most his own, but it was Powell who led him to a setting\n\nWa rt i m e Pag e a n t ry\n\n·\n\n25\n\nfor the story in East Kent, where the director had been born. The village of Chilham, a few miles west from Canterbury, would with other Kentish villages become the “Chillingbourne” of the film, and since Powell had walked the nearby Pilgrim’s Way many times, it was easy for him to conceive that the story should involve modern-day versions of medieval pilgrims. According to his later account, these updated pilgrims “crowded in on us, insisting to be used”: There was a loony English squire, who was so anxious to preserve Britain’s traditional virtues that he poured glue on girls’ hair when they went out at night with soldiers. This traditionalist had to be given a good old English name, and we called him Thomas Colpepper. [In the fi lm, spelled “Colpeper.”] The modern pilgrims to Canterbury were three: a young British soldier, in civilian life a cinema organist, a virtuoso on the Wurlitzer, who combined ruthless materialism with sensitive musicianship; an observant young American soldier from a lumber town in Oregon; a young land-girl, one of the Women’s Corps mobilised to take over fighting men’s jobs on the farm, and who is trying to forget a tragic love affair. . . . For different reasons they have all alighted from the train in the dark at the little village of Chillingbourne. The English soldier is training there, Allison [the land girl, spelled “Alison” in the fi lm] is going to work at a farm there, and the American thought it was Canterbury. They all chase the Glueman, but he escapes and they decide to spend the weekend hunting him down. . . . essentially the fi lm is a morality play in which three modern pilgrims to Canterbury receive their blessings.\n\nIn the parts of the loony squire and land girl Powell wanted to use the leading actors from Colonel Blimp, Roger Livesey and Deborah Kerr. But Kerr, with whom he had been romantically involved, went out of his life and off to Hollywood, and in the event Powell cast Eric Portman as the squire and the then unknown Sheila Sim as the girl. The equally unknown Dennis Price became the English soldier-organist Peter Gibbs, while an amateur actor from the American Army, Bob Sweet, whom Powell had seen in a performance of a play called The Eve of St. Mark, became the film’s American sergeant Bob Johnson. Powell unhesitatingly named two other non-Englishmen to key positions on the crew, both of them UFA-trained German émigrés with whom he had worked before, Erwin Hillier as his lighting cameraman, and Alfred Junge as the designer.\n\n26\n\n·\n\nEnglish Filming, English Writing\n\nProduction of A Canterbury Tale took place in the summer and autumn of 1943, half of the time on location in Kent—to which, in an irony which would have to be resolutely excluded from the finished work, Emeric Pressburger, then still technically an enemy alien, was denied access on the orders of the Chief Constable. Powell was present from the start, of course, and while in Kent spent his evenings doing research by reading a thick volume he remembered as The History of British Civilization. Presumably this was Esmé Wingfield-Stratford’s standard work of 1930, and in spite of its snobbish dismissal of films (“the indiscrimination of a twentieth century mob, debauched by cinema . . . monstrously divorced from sense and reality”) the filmmaker may have found it useful for historical background. During the day his first task was to scout locations. At the tiny village of Shottenden near Chilham he found two brothers, a blacksmith and a wheelwright, whose forge and shop (“a prop man’s dream”) would provide a center for Chillingbourne’s traditional life. Shooting of exterior scenes took place in both villages, while scenes in Canterbury were photographed in the streets and among the blitzed ruins of the city. The Cathedral itself, however, the destined blessing-place for all the characters, could not be used, the Dean and Chapter having denied the Archers’ request for fi lming, and in any case it was in a wartime state (organ dismantled, stained-glass taken out) unsuitable for filming. For interior sequences, Junge had to create a nave on the soundstage at Denham, where Olivier’s Henry V, a historical drama of a different but equally patriotic sort, was concurrently being shot. Powell wanted to open and close A Canterbury Tale with a tracking shot through pealing bells, and because this could not be accomplished in the real bellchamber at Canterbury, Junge made miniature bells out of fiberglass, which a team of real bellringers operated with tiny ropes as they listened to prerecorded ringing: “the kind of lark the Archers were always getting up to in those days.” The film produced by these efforts begins, after those pealing bells, with a prologue which we will have to examine later, in considerable detail. The main plot gets under way with the arrival of Powell’s three modern pilgrims at a station so dark that they can barely be seen. (What other filmmakers, the critic Chris Wicking has asked, would have dared to keep the stars’ faces invisible for the first twelve minutes of a film?)\n\nWa rt i m e Pag e a n t ry\n\n·\n\n27\n\nAs the trio walk into Chillingbourne, a shadowy figure wearing a uniform comes out of nowhere to pour glue on Alison’s hair. The land girl and the two sergeants pursue the assailant to the village hall, where he disappears. Having gotten much of the mess out of her hair, and learned that she is the eleventh girl to have been attacked by the mysterious Glueman, Alison goes upstairs to report to Colpeper, whose farm she has been sent to work on. He expresses disdain for the help she, a young woman, could provide—or perhaps it is a fatherly concern for her virtue. Does she not know about the threat to chastity posed by the soldiers encamped nearby? Colpeper chats with Bob Johnson too, and when the American and the land girl confer later they realize that certain clues they have noticed—a hastily closed blackout curtain, a Home Guard uniform hanging in the closet—hint strongly that Colpeper is the Glueman. (Wartime viewers would not have been unduly shocked by such a revelation: two years previously, in Alberto Cavalcanti’s Went the Day Well?, they had seen another authority figure, in this case, a Nazisympathizing squire, preying on his own village.) Predictably, Alison and Bob decide to make a few inquiries into the goings-on at Chillingbourne, and in this effort they are joined the next day by the English sergeant Peter Gibbs. (Collaboration is thus emphasized in a film produced by the collaborating Archers.) Over the course of the August weekend, Alison talks to other victims of the attacks. Bob, working his American charm hard and dispensing quarters right and left, finds some local boys playing at war games, enlists them in the antiColpeper cause, and through them is eventually able to trace purchases of glue back to the magistrate. For his part, Peter pays a call on Colpeper and surreptitiously takes away the latter’s fire-watching rota, which when examined reveals that the Glueman only strikes when the magistrate is on duty. Meanwhile the three amateur detectives have together attended one of the slide-illustrated lectures on local history which Colpeper likes to give to soldiers. The lecture aids the plot by suggesting a motive for the attacks—if girls are afraid of getting glue in their hair, then they will refuse to walk out with the soldiers, who in turn will fill up the long empty evenings learning history from Colpeper—but also allows listeners, the fictive ones in the lecture hall and the real ones in the cinema theatre, to begin to find the loony Colpeper faintly likable, to discover that his antiquarianism is genuine and infectious.\n\n28\n\n·\n\nEnglish Filming, English Writing\n\nPowell and Pressburger present all the detecting with efficiency but not single-mindedness, since almost from the start their film takes as much interest in the investigators’ personal problems as in their pursuit of the Glueman. The multiple and carefully paralleled plot lines (another constant feature of wartime cinema) developed about the three characters are at the heart of A Canterbury Tale. Alison, we learn in the course of several tight-lipped admissions, visited Chillingbourne before the war. She spent an idyllic summer camping in a caravan with her fiancé Geoffrey, an archeologist excavating a part of the nearby Pilgrim’s Way, and would have married him, except for his family’s opposition to the match; now Geoff rey is in the RAF and missing in action. Bob also has a love problem, since his girl back in Oregon has not written to him in months. Peter is more generally dissatisfied with life. His “sensitive musicianship,” as Powell’s description has it, would seem to qualify him for a place behind a church organ, but in Civvy Street he has merely been playing the Wurlitzer in a cinema palace and growing more and more cynical about everything. During the hilltop scene already glanced at, Alison tells the story of her lost love to the now sympathetic and apologetic Colpeper, and these two, withdrawing into the grass, watch Bob and Peter approach, then overhear them talking. The two soldiers know that Colpeper is the Glueman but simultaneously admit to liking the man. The various truths of the film now being out, and Canterbury looming in the distance, all is prepared for a final confrontation. This takes place when the three amateur detectives and Colpeper leave Chillingbourne for the city. Like a pilgrim making her way to the shrine of the martyr Thomas à Becket (the film makes the analogy possible without ever stating it directly), Alison is going to the garage where she has stored the caravan, the venerated relic of her summer on the Pilgrim’s Way. Bob plans to meet another American soldier at the cathedral; Peter will attend a soldiers’ service there before shipping out. In the carriage of the Canterbury train, challenged by the stares of three young people seated across from him, the magistrate implicitly confesses to his misdeeds and quite candidly speaks of the motives behind them: not only did he intend to attract an audience to his lectures, he wanted to help keep local girls faithful to their husbands and boyfriends overseas. But why attack the girls?, Alison sensibly asks. Why not simply invite the girls to the lectures too?\n\nWa rt i m e Pag e a n t ry\n\n·\n\n29\n\nColpeper fails to respond, possibly strengthening Peter’s resolve—the other two are in favor of forgiveness—to report the Glueman to the police in Canterbury. The last twenty minutes of the film follow these individual purposes to conclusions which seem, and are contrived to seem (for example, by special-effect lighting or abrupt appearances and disappearances), miraculous. Alison attends the caravan, weeping over all the dust which has settled on the homely items inside, but then is told by the garage-owner that her fiancé’s father has been trying to reach her with news: Geoffrey is alive after all, safe in Gibraltar. Bob’s army friend delivers the missing letters from his girl: they have been delayed because they have had to come all the way from Australia, where she is serving with the WACs. Finally, Peter the church-organist-manqué encounters a stray sheet of music in the cathedral. It flutters down the organ-loft staircase toward him as magically and invitingly as the theater program fluttering out of the sky at the opening of that other Denham-produced feature of 1944, Henry V. Peter follows the sheet-music’s lead upwards to the great instrument of the cathedral, where the friendly old organist engages him in conversation. We hear the voices of choristers rehearsing somewhere in the distance, and at the moment when Peter sits down at the console of the organ they modulate into the ethereal theme which has been associated all along with the miracles of the fi lm. He plays the Bach Toccata and Fugue in d minor, followed by “Onward Christian Soldiers” as the troops parade in; any remaining thought of a visit to the police is lost in the thundering chords. Bob wonders admiringly at the cathedral’s architecture; Geoffrey’s father puts a protective arm around Alison as he leads her into the service; and Colpeper stands solemnly and silently by, presiding in some unspecified way, his declaration, made on the hilltop, that “miracles still happen,” proved true in the end. Released early in 1944, A Canterbury Tale was unsuccessful at the box-office, the first real failure in the Archers’ career. An older Michael Powell blamed the timing (“the centre of interest had shifted to the Continent”) or the complication of Pressburger’s plot ideas, which, he decided, he should have insisted on simplifying. Meanwhile, in 1949, in an attempt to make the film a hit in the States, the Archers recut it and gave it a new narrative frame. After the war, Bob Johnson and his new bride\n\n30\n\n·\n\nEnglish Filming, English Writing\n\nlook down on Fift h Avenue from the top of Rockefeller Center, and he recalls his adventures in Chillingbourne in an extended flashback. This version too was unsuccessful. Complicated (and original, and tricky to make sense of) A Canterbury Tale may be, but its original audiences would have found in it one thing as unmistakable as Sergeant John Sweet’s country-boy accent on the soundtrack: the wartime theme of Anglo-American cooperation. If an American soldier and two English people can work effectively together on the small scale of village crime-solving, then the Allies ought to be able to do the same on the large scale of a war; so the logic of the film runs. To make the idea of a successful alliance of equal partners as clear as possible, Powell repeatedly pairs the two sergeants, always in uniform, in tight two-shots. Standing shoulder to shoulder, they puzzle out the timing of the attacks or the business of Colpeper’s glue purchases. On top of the hill, they amiably dispute the benefits of tea-drinking, eat blackberries, then race each other back to the village. One or two critics particularly approved of the fact that the Archers’ American soldier was played by a real GI—Edgar Anstey thought Sweet “the best piece of propaganda for America which has yet reached our screens”—as if authenticity somehow had predictive value, and Anglo-American collaboration in a film cast could give promise of the two armies’ successful collaboration in the fighting to come. The idea of Anglo-American solidarity was scarcely original in itself, of course. A Canterbury Tale was one among many 1940s proalliance fi lms. Some of these were imports, like Paramount’s One Night in Lisbon (1941), directed by Edward H. Griffith, which concocts a whirlwind London romance between an English ATS driver and an American pilot, then sets the pair improbably to defying Nazis and unmasking traitors in Portugal. One Night in Lisbon earned a savage rebuke from George Orwell, in one of the fi lm reviews the journalist produced (quickly, for the money) for Time and Tide in 1940–41: “What rot it all is! What sickly, enervating rubbish! How dare anyone present the war in these colours when thousands of tanks are battling on the plains of Poland and tired aircraft workers are slinking into the tobacconist’s to plead humbly for a small Woodbine?” With characteristic honesty Orwell went on to modify this political judgment on aesthetic grounds: “And yet as current films go this is a good fi lm. It moves easily, there are\n\nWa rt i m e Pag e a n t ry\n\n·\n\n31\n\nno gaps or longueurs in it, and the photography is adequate. Its only fault is to be twenty years behind the times in outlook, and since that is almost general in fi lms likely to have a wide appeal, I suppose one ought not to grumble.” Other pro-alliance films were home-grown, like the quasi-documentary San Demetrio, London (1943), with its shipload of British merchant sailors and one American crewmate, or British National’s Welcome, Mr. Washington, directed by Leslie Hiscott, which entertained the same 1944 audience as A Canterbury Tale with the story of an American lieutenant who copes manfully with the prejudices of English villagers, falls for the local landowner, and eventually calls in his men to bring home the harvest. The next year would see a much more considerable fi lm, Anthony Asquith’s The Way to the Stars, a generally realistic depiction of USAAF and RAF flying crews sharing an English airbase. Here, an initial display of national stereotypes (the Americans are brash and loud, the English stuff y and reserved) yields to the development of camaraderie, and at last to a merging of identities (the Americans grow sensitive, the English discover baseball) in the common cause. Finally, just after the war, with A Matter of Life and Death, Powell and Pressburger brought to the screen their own most ambitious treatment of the theme. Developing the film from its simple-minded origin in public relations (the Ministry of Information “wanted it laid down as to why we were all one family”), they showed Americans and English working companionably together—for example, staging a performance of A Midsummer Night’s Dream—but also having their cultural disagreements. Indeed, with typical Archers bravado they transformed the disagreements into a dreamy midsummer playlet of their own: the English pilot of their story, saved from death by a mistake in the divine bureaucratic machinery, falls in love with a beautiful American radio operator, then has to stand trial in heaven to justify his continued existence, which means countering the attacks of a rabidly anglophobe Yankee prosecutor. The national insults fly back and forth, focusing on the boring incomprehensibility of English cricket and the vulgarity of American jazz, until the pilot’s and radio operator’s selfless love finally ends the conflict. For all its imaginativeness, in other words, A Matter of Life and Death is built around the familiar idea of an Anglo-American romance. This cinematic cliché and others A Canterbury Tale resolutely avoids.\n\n32\n\n·\n\nEnglish Filming, English Writing\n\nNo one is seen to fall in love with anyone else. Bob Johnson stays devoted to his girl at home, and the English, innocent of baseball to the last, stay firmly English. Such cultural disagreements as the villagers have with America are kept at a low-key, plausible, non-dramatic level: continued and irritated amazement that Bob’s sergeant’s stripes are turned the wrong way round on his uniform sleeve, mild resentment at his too bright GI flashlight. In outward demeanor the sergeant stays correspondingly American. He is invariably naïve, outgoing, impressed in an aw-shucks way by the quaintness of the village, and in one of the film’s brief slapstick scenes comically frustrated by the arcane workings of Button A and Button B on the inn’s public telephone. Inwardly, however, certain changes do take place in Bob and the other major characters—personal changes, not adjustments of nationality. Thanks to the ministrations of Chillingbourne, they are led to discover qualities in themselves which they have forgotten, and the importance of that process to A Canterbury Tale sharply differentiates it from films like One Night in Lisbon or Welcome, Mr. Washington. In roundabout ways which would have been highly unsuited to propaganda the Archers set out to examine the spiritual damage which modernity has done to Americans and Englishmen alike. The allies of the film really do battle not with Nazis but “materialism,” to use Pressburger’s all-purpose term for the enemy. To take Bob Johnson’s experience first, during the early scene with Colpeper at the village hall, the American admits to a liking for the movies. “It’s a great thing to sit back in an armchair and watch the world go by in front of you,” he says, to which Colpeper responds: “people may get used to looking at the world in a sitting position . . . then when they really do pass through it they don’t see anything.” It seems a pity to the Englishman that Bob should make a pilgrimage to Canterbury and only go to a cinema. The next day the American has apparently taken the warning about a sitting position to heart. As he wanders around the village, noticing things and commenting amiably on them, he strolls at random past the blacksmith’s forge and into the wheelwright’s shop. There he notices some timber (“lumber,” he insists) being stored and, remembering his father’s sawmill business at home, pleasurably exchanges wood talk with the English workman. Their shared knowledge\n\nWa rt i m e Pag e a n t ry\n\n·\n\n33\n\nthat “You can’t hurry an elm” in the process of seasoning identifies them as fellows in the same craft, and an invitation to dinner with the wheelwright’s family soon follows. In other words, the village accepts him, his American lingo notwithstanding. Moreover, rural England redeems the sergeant’s rootless, movie-corrupted existence by making him feel at home abroad. In Canterbury, Bob visits the cathedral, as he promised his mother he would, and so takes another modest step toward being freed of cultural superficiality, of materialism. Wandering about once again, this time to the accompaniment of the Bach which Peter is playing on the organ, the American looks reverently about him; the camera, in a beautifully timed slow tracking shot, goes along with him through the organ screen and into the choir. The stone vaulting shown far overhead in the apse—the one real interior view of the cathedral we get, shot surreptitiously by a crew member, as Ian Christie has noted—makes Bob murmur about the wooden Baptist church his grandfather built in Oregon in 1887. “Well, that was a good job too,” he says loyally. This is the same grandfather, we learn from a scrap of dialogue, who visited Canterbury before him. Bob has simultaneously found beauty and repossessed his origin. It takes no great leap of the imagination to link this fiction about following the right cultural cues, being accepted, getting to share a meal at the wheelwright’s, to Emeric Pressburger’s personal history. The scriptwriter could only have invented these warmhearted sequences in A Canterbury Tale in the course of recollecting and interpreting his own immigrant experience, no doubt with a certain wistfulness, as his biographer suggests. Pressburger arrived in England in 1935 by way of the German UFA studios and then Paris, a Hungarian Jew exiled from his homeland and looking for a new national identity. By 1944 he had not quite found it. “England is a very, very difficult country for foreigners to come to,” he noted, and after all he was still being excluded from the coastal zone in Kent. But Pressburger could well imagine or hope what the experience of acceptance would be like, and he shaped Bob Johnson’s experience accordingly. In later screenplays he continued to meditate on the theme, sometimes denying acceptance to his characters (the European nuns in Black Narcissus, for example, who never succeed in finding a place in their Himalayan community), sometimes allowing\n\n34\n\n·\n\nEnglish Filming, English Writing\n\nthem to earn acceptance (as in I Know Where I’m Going, where the English heroine is cured of a fatal modern waywardness when she falls in love with an impecunious laird and devotes herself to their settled life in the Highlands). When he retired, with these fictions of outsidersmoving-in behind him, Pressburger could confidently deem himself fully accepted, and on his own terms. To the end he kept up a few Continental mannerisms (and his Hungarian accent: like Bob Johnson, he was always marked on the tongue) but settled comfortably into the life of a Suffolk village even smaller than Chillingbourne, and there filled his cottage bookshelves with the works of Charles Dickens and Winston Churchill. As for Michael Powell, that member of the partnership had his own influence on the theme of an American coming to England if, as appears likely, he brought his devotion to Rudyard Kipling to bear on the script of A Canterbury Tale. Kipling came home to England from afar (India, travel through the Empire, a temporary sojourn in America) and once settled in Sussex produced a series of remarkable fictions about village life, local customs, and national history; some of these are transparent allegories of his own experience in rediscovering an English heritage. One Kipling story in particular, though never acknowledged as a source for the film (the Archers may have thought one allusion to English literature in the title was enough), seems nevertheless to have been just that. “An Habitation Enforced,” the lead story in Actions and Reactions (1909), describes a married couple, moneyed Americans wandering about Europe as peevish tourists, who purchase a neglected English estate and bring it and themselves back to life. They wish to modernize, of course, but are taught lessons in patience and age-old traditions by their tenants. Wood lore features here as in A Canterbury Tale, a crucial lesson being that bridges ought to be built from long-seasoned oak. In the end, the Americans realize that in coming to Sussex they have only come home, so complete has their re-identification as country landowners been; their adopted village even turns out to be the place from which the wife’s family left for the New World. They have repossessed their origin, like Bob Johnson. Kipling liked to print companion verses immediately before or after his stories, and those following “An Habitation Enforced” memorably sum up its sentiments:\n\nWa rt i m e Pag e a n t ry\n\n·\n\n35\n\nI am the land of their fathers. In me the virtue stays. I will bring back my children, After certain days. Under their feet in the grasses My clinging magic runs.\n\nThis poem, “The Recall,” could appropriately be delivered by Colpeper in his role as mystagogue, though even Colpeper might well demur at its last two lines—“They shall return as strangers, They shall remain as sons”—knowing as he does that visitors to Chillingbourne or Canterbury are not literally coming to settle there, but merely to recover their own pasts, then move on. In this sense A Canterbury Tale is marginally more realistic than “The Recall” or “An Habitation Enforced.” It is also more up-to-date and evenhanded, since it regards materialism as a problem, and cultural recovery as an obligation, for the English, not just the Americans. Alison Smith and Peter Gibbs, a shop assistant and a cinema organist, Londoners both, are initially as dispossessed as Bob Johnson of the things which Chillingbourne represents. (To make Peter’s alienation from the village visible for the screen, Powell puts him in an armored Bren Gun carrier and sends him careening about the country lanes; the vehicle almost collides with Alison’s horsedrawn farmcart.) The English characters have lessons to learn, and then to teach. They pay quiet attention at Colpeper’s lecture; Peter slips briefly into the lecturer’s mode himself when he points out the local river from the hilltop and informs his fellow sergeant “you’ll be happy to tell your folks you’ve seen the River Stour.” Admittedly, Peter follows this with the casual remark that in London he likes to spend his Sundays playing cards with the boys and waiting for the pubs to open. Powell and Pressburger have no illusions about this sergeant’s cultural education happening overnight. However much or little Peter and Alison may learn about their national heritage in a public lecture, the crucial lessons for them are private ones. They have to be encouraged to seek out their own redemptive pasts, and their mentor is again Colpeper. Asked at the lecture “What have we got to do with this old road and the people who traveled along it six hundred years ago?” the magistrate replies\n\n36\n\n·\n\nEnglish Filming, English Writing\n\nThere are more ways than one of getting close to your ancestors. Follow the old road, and as you walk, think of them and of the old England. They climbed Chillingbourne Hill just as you did. They sweated and paused for breath just as you did today.
