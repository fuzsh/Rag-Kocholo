        "text": "Both stories drew on her love for folk tales, particularly those of Eastern Europe and the Yiddish tradition. Margot Zemach also received Caldecott Honor citations for The Judge : An Untrue Tale and It Could Always Be Worse. The Zemachs collaborated on a number of children's books including Duffy and the Devil : A Cornish Tale, a retelling of a Cornish folk tale that won Margot Zemach the Caldecott Award in 1974. The story drew on the Zemachs' experiences in Vienna and their knowledge of the city. Harvey Fichstrom, under the pseudonym Harve Zemach, authored many of the books Margot Zemach illustrated beginning with Small Boy Is Listening in 1959.\n\nMargot Zemach married Harvey Fichstrom in 1957 they had four daughters including Kaethe who would later become an author and illustrator of children's books. She attended various art schools in California and studied on a Fulbright Scholarship at the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts in 1955-1956. Margot Zemach was born Novemin Los Angeles, California.\n\nHeinlein dedicated his 1985 novel The Cat Who Walks Through Walls to Anderson and eight of the other members of the Citizens' Advisory Council on National Space Policy. He was a founding member of the Society for Creative Anachronism. He was a member of the Swordsmen and Sorcerers' Guild of America, a loose-knit group of Heroic Fantasy authors founded in the 1960s, some of whose works were anthologized in Lin Carter's Flashing Swords! anthologies. Anderson was the sixth President of Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, taking office in 1972. They had one daughter, Astrid, who is married to science fiction author Greg Bear. He received numerous awards for his writing, including seven Hugo Awards and three Nebula Awards.Īnderson received a degree in physics from the University of Minnesota in 1948. Anderson also authored several works of fantasy, historical novels, and a prodigious number of short stories.\n\nPoul William Anderson was an American science fiction author who began his career during one of the Golden Ages of the genre and continued to write and remain popular into the 21st century.\n\nAnd as they team up with the powerful men of London's exclusive Séance Society to solve the mystery, they begin to suspect that they are not merely out to solve a crime, but perhaps entangled in one themselves. With shared determination, the women find companionship that perhaps borders on something more. When Vaudeline is beckoned to England to solve a high-profile murder, Lenna accompanies her as an understudy. Lenna Wickes has come to Paris to find answers about her sister's death, but to do so, she must embrace the unknown and overcome her own logic-driven bias against the occult. Known worldwide for her talent in conjuring the spirits of murder victims to ascertain the identities of the people who killed them, she is highly sought after by widows and investigators alike. At an abandoned château on the outskirts of Paris, a dark séance is about to take place, led by acclaimed spiritualist Vaudeline D'Allaire. From the author of the sensational bestseller The Lost Apothecary comes a spellbinding tale about two daring women who hunt for truth and justice in the perilous art of conjuring the dead.ġ873.\n\nOccasionally his narrator's voice offers comment, speaking from a perspective 700 years in the future, but for the most part he stands back and merely portrays. Druon explores the thoughts and feelings of real people who experienced these events, embellishing only where it serves to fill in the blanks. This is written in the style of my favourite historical fiction, steering close to the actual record. It offers some closure but leaves several balls in the air for the rest of the series to untangle. The story quickly progresses to illicit affairs among the princesses in line for the throne, and the subsequent fallout. Given the preponderance of Templars in fiction, I was happy that they don't long hold the stage. Philip IV of France is putting an end to the Templars, in a bid to grasp their fortune for the crown, and he gets his lineage cursed in the process.\n\nIt was still a present-tense existence.” In this retrospective, which examines a decade that most of his readers lived though, Klosterman acknowledges that “there is always a disconnect between the world we seem to remember and the world that actually was.” Throughout the wide-ranging narrative-from technology and the rise of the internet to key trends in music, TV, and film indelible moments in sports and significant political moments-Klosterman takes pains to ensure that references are addressed in relation to their historical context rather than through the foggy and often inaccurate lens of memory. But that deluge of data remained, at the time, ephemeral and unavail­able. “Almost every meaningful moment of the nineties was captured on videotape, along with thousands upon thousands of trivial moments that meant nothing at all,” writes the author.\n\nKlosterman returns with an entertaining journey through the last decade of the 20th century.\n\nTheir past employer, the Earl of Darlington, has died a broken man, his reputation destroyed by his prewar support of Germany, and his stately country house has been sold to retired US Congressman Jack Lewis. In 1958 postwar Britain, Stevens, the butler of Darlington Hall, receives a letter from the former housekeeper, Miss Kenton. In 1999, the British Film Institute ranked The Remains of the Day the 64th-greatest British film of the 20th century. The film was a critical and box office success and it was nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor (Hopkins), Best Actress (Thompson) and Best Adapted Screenplay (Jhabvala). It stars Anthony Hopkins as James Stevens and Emma Thompson as Miss Kenton, with James Fox, Christopher Reeve, Hugh Grant, Ben Chaplin, and Lena Headey in supporting roles.\n\nThe film was directed by James Ivory, produced by Ismail Merchant, Mike Nichols, and John Calley and adapted by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala. The Remains of the Day is a 1993 drama film adapted from the Booker Prize-winning 1988 novel of the same name by Kazuo Ishiguro.\n\nLinguists have rigorously analyzed what is called “agrammaticality.” A number of very intense examples can be found in the work of the American poet e.\n\nIn all these respects, it has the same force, the same role as an agrammatical formula. Murmured in a soft, flat, and patient voice, it attains to the irremissible, by forming an inarticulate block, a single breath. Its repetition and its insistence render it all the more unusual, entirely so. Certainly it is grammatically correct, syntactically correct, but its abrupt termination, NOT TO, which leaves what it rejects undetermined, confers upon it the character of a radical, a kind of limit-function. But the strangeness of the formula goes beyond the word itself.\n\nThe usual formula would instead be I had rather not. We immediately notice a certain mannerism, a certain solemnity: prefer is rarely employed in this sense, and neither Bartleby's boss, the attorney, nor his clerks normally use it (“queer word, I never use it myself”). But in what does the literality of the formula consist? A gaunt and pallid man has uttered the formula that drives everyone crazy. This is the formula of its glory, which every loving reader repeats in turn. And what it says and repeats is I would prefer not to. It is like the novellas of Kleist, Dostoyevsky, Kafka, or Beckett, with which it forms a subterranean and prestigious lineage. It is a violently comical text, and the comical is always literal. “Bartleby” is neither a metaphor for the writer nor the symbol of any thing whatsoever.\n\nThe Silk Road website was like eBay for the buying and selling of contraband and forged a new frontier of crime in the digital age.Īs the FBI, DEA, and other agencies began to close in on Ulbricht, the book takes us on a high-stakes cat-and-mouse game, with each side using cunning tactics and advanced technology to gain the upper hand. Because the Silk Road operated on the dark web, it existed on a hidden layer of the internet that is accessible only through a specialized browser (IE - it’s hard to get to and was much harder back in 2011 when it was launched).\n\nThe Silk Road was an online black market that evaded law enforcement for years. Ulbricht was responsible for starting and managing the Silk Road website - an underground empire built on illegal drugs, weapons, and other illicit activities. Nick Bilton unravels the double life of Ross Ulbricht, an outwardly unassuming young man who operated online as the notorious Dread Pirate Roberts.\n\nIntroductionĪmerican Kingpin: The Epic Hunt for the Criminal Mastermind Behind the Silk Road is a riveting journey into the darkest corner of the internet known as the Dark Web, where crime and anonymity reign supreme. It’s great narrative nonfiction, but it’s also just a fascinating tale about a young idealistic person who goes way too far.\n\nIn the first round, we were still finding our feet, and the new players had only recently joined us. \"After the game, it was good to have the win, but our focus was already on the Magic,\" Jailens said.Īs the competition reaches its midway point, the Bears aim to avenge their previous loss against Broadmeadow Magic in the first round.\n\nI was pleased with the way we controlled the game,\" Jailens said.ĭespite the triumph, the Bears have wasted no time in shifting their focus to the upcoming fixture against Broadmeadow Magic. In the second half, we came out better and executed the agreed-upon strategies. \"I told the boys I wasn't happy with the first half. This result propelled them into second on the table, just two points behind league leaders Charlestown Azzurri.Ĭoach Kew Jaliens provided an honest assessment of the team's performance, particularly emphasizing their improvement in the second half.\n\nThe Weston Bears demonstrated their premiership potential with a commanding 3-1 victory over Cooks Hill United last weekend.
