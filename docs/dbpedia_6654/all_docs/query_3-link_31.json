        "text": "Shintaro Ishihara, a Japanese author turned firebrand nationalist politician who served as the governor of Tokyo and famously stoked diplomatic tensions with China over disputed islands, died on Tuesday in Tokyo. He was 89.\n\nHis death was confirmed by his sons, who told reporters in Tokyo that Mr. Ishihara had suffered a relapse of pancreatic cancer in October. “He led an era,” his son Yoshizumi Ishihara said.\n\nA contentious figure in the otherwise wan world of Japanese politics, Mr. Ishihara was governor of Tokyo for 13 years beginning in 1999, carrying out a staunch right-wing campaign that he believed would reinvigorate the nation and free it from servility to the United States.\n\nHe called for the development of nuclear arms in a nation still traumatized by the bombings of World War II, and for the abolition of constitutional provisions imposed by the United States that prohibit Japan from waging war.\n\nHis outspoken conservative views at times led to remarks that were criticized as discriminatory toward women or foreigners. And his intense nationalism helped pull Japan into a diplomatic tangle with China in 2012, when as governor of Tokyo he raised millions of dollars to buy a chain of privately owned islands in the East China Sea known as the Senkaku in Japanese and the Diaoyu in Chinese."
