        "text": "Irascible former Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara, who has made a decades-long career out of baiting China and offending Japan's liberals, announced his retirement from political life Tuesday. The 82-year-old, whose Party for Future Generations was almost wiped out in Sunday's general election, told reporters he would not be seeking office again. \"I have worked in politics for more than 50 years, but I have decided to retire after the results of the latest poll,\" he said. Ishihara, a former novelist, was a popular four-term governor of the Japanese capital who rarely shied away from proffering an opinion on everything from homosexuality to the wastefulness of vending machines. As governor in 2012, he raised cash to purchase the uninhabited Senkaku islands, which China claims as the Diaoyus, and planned to develop them with the express purpose of reinforcing Japan's sovereignty. The move pushed the Japanese government into nationalising them in what ministers said was an effort to head off fall out from the inflammatory purchase. But China reacted furiously and relations went into a tailspin from which they are only now beginning to recover. The renewed friction was a delight to Ishihara, who has never made a secret of his dislike of China, a country he refers to by its pre-war name \"Shina\", which is offensive to the Chinese. Ishihara stood for parliament in the 2012 general election, gathering a motley crew of nationalists that eventually joined forces with a party started by fellow arch conservative Toru Hashimoto. However, their short-lived union was not robust enough to contain the two super-sized egos, and they split in May. Ishihara went on to form the Party for Future Generations with several of his loyal lieutenants, all in their 70s. The octogenarian on Tuesday blamed the party's name for its drubbing in Sunday's election, when its previous tally of 19 seats was reduced to just two. \"The naming required some explanation for people to understand. I had expressed objections,\" he said. \"It was problematic as a name for a political party.\" Ishihara said in his retirement he would focus on supporting young artists and spend time sailing."
