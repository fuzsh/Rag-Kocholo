        "meta_description": "This chapter provides the reader with an overview of Fran√ßois Truffaut's films from a number of perspectives. An initial discussion of critical evaluations of his work is followed by an examination of some of the ways in which the films can be grouped and categorised. This leads into a chronological review of the body of work which foregrounds the main themes and discusses Truffaut's working practices as a director, drawing on his own writing about his film-making. From a relatively early point in his career, Truffaut had found his way to America: to see Helen Scott and Hitchcock in order to work on what he often referred to as the Hitchbook; to attend the New York Film Festival; and for English lessons in Los Angeles. As his reputation grew and particularly after he won the Oscar, he received invitations, from those 'nice Americans', to make a film in the USA.",
