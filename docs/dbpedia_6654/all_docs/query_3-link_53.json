The documentary aims to deny Japanese soldiers massacred Chinese civilians and prisoners of war in Nanjing.\n\nANOTHER SOURCE SAYS ... Source: Asia Media News Daily (linked on Ramzy piece) Date: January 25 JAPAN: Filmmaker to paint Nanjing slaughter as just myth Filmmakers depiction of Nanking massacre finds broad support from politicians, academics who hail the film as correction of distorted facts Japan Times Thursday, January 25, 2007 By Jun Hongo About 40 people, including Diet members, university professors and critics, rallied Wednesday behind a Japanese director's plan to shoot a film putting his spin on the Nanjing Massacre in which he claims the butchery of Chinese by the Japanese Imperial Army is nothing more than political propaganda. In a news conference held to\"strike back against an erroneous understanding of history,\" people including Upper House members Hirofumi Ryu and Jin Matsubara gathered to support Satoru Mizushima, director and producer of\"Nanking No Shinjitsu\" (\"The Truth About Nanjing\"), which will depict the filmmaker's account of what took place in 1937. Though not present at the news conference held at a hotel in Chiyoda Ward, Tokyo, supporters of the film also include Tokyo Gov. Shintaro Ishihara and well-known journalist Yoshiko Sakurai.\"Gov. Ishihara has shown his keen support and I am very thankful,\" said Mizushima, 57, who has taken part in the production of more than 300 films and documentaries, including the 1995 war epic\"Minami No Shima Ni Yuki Ga Furu.\""
