        "text": "Antoine and Colette (1962 short, France)\n\nWhen we last saw Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Leaud reprising his role from The 400 Blows), he was a teenager who had run away from home, resorted to petty thievery, thrown into jail, and escaped from an observation center for troubled kids. Three years have passed and the independence that Antoine always relished has finally arrived.\n\nFrançois Truffaut's Antoine and Colette is a thirty-two short film that is contained in a larger 1962 omnibus film named Love at Twenty with other participating directors including Andrzej Wajda (Poland), Renzo Rossellini (Italy), Shintaro Ishihara (Japan), and Marcel Ophuls (Germany, emigrated to the United States).\n\nAntoine is living by himself in an apartment working at a Philips LP manufacturing plant and has discovered classical music as one of the few constants in his life. He is now a regular attendee of the orchestral concerts for youths a few times a week. While attending a Berlioz concert, he freezes, his glance fixated at one girl across the aisle. Enter Colette (Marie-France Pisier), who hails from a background so unlike Antoine’s disorderly and misunderstood past. He falls in love for the first time but their relationship comes to something not at all what Antoine would have expected. His possessiveness drives Colette a bit apart by the ending - by how much we are not certain - as his inexperience with love and romance meet at the twain at the worst possible moment.\n\nIn typical French New Wave coldness, we’re left with an ambiguous ending but the entire short film contains none of the dreariness that was oftentimes part of The 400 Blows. The bitterness that Antoine had gone through - and, to bring about a parallel, the bitterness Truffaut lost at this juncture of his life - has long departed. There is now room for light playfulness and humor. There is now room for others to enter the peaceful but terribly lonely life of Antoine Doniel. Beethoven, Berlioz, Chopin, and other classical music composers can only provide so much.\n\nThough many steps away from matching the emotional and cinematic impact of The 400 Blows, Antoine and Colette shows Truffaut’s knack for improvisation and his understanding with the joys and agonies over the creation of cinema and the emergence of love.\n\nNow to the semiautobiographical aspects of this short. At seventeen, Truffaut fell head over heels with a girl named Liliana Litvin, whom he met at the Cinematheque francaise. Truffaut was so stricken by love (he happened to be one of those folks who love one person deeply and passionately at a single time) he moved apartments to be directly across from Litvin. Antoine does the same exact thing in the short. But, alas, Truffaut’s relationship with Litvin came to nothing and after a failed suicide attempt on his part, he joined the military and soon found himself in a military prison some time after.\n\nOne has to wonder how therapeutic Antoine and Colette must have been for the Frenchman. As painful as it must have been to revisit those days, putting oneself into art without being self-congratulatory or self-accusatory has oftentimes resulted in exquisite works of art (in many mediums). For everyone who isn’t François Truffaut, we laugh and we empathize with Antoine’s inexperience and don’t hold him terribly at fault for what happens by film’s end.\n\nOnce again, we leave Antoine to make sense of his actions. It might not be much and they might be long gone, but Beethoven, Berlioz, and Chopin can help in some part just as Truffaut found solace, affirmation, and self-understanding through the language of cinema. For reasons just mentioned, I found myself personally connecting to a character synonymous with the French New Wave - a movement I thought I could not make any sort of connection with.\n\nMy rating: 7.5/10\n\n^ Based on my personal imdb rating. Half-points are always rounded down."
