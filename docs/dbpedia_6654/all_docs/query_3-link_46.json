        "text": "Yujiro Ishihara, a popular Japanese actor, died of liver cancer Friday. He was 52. A noted singer and movie producer, Ishihara also produced and starred in several movies, including “Alone in the Pacific.”\n\nIshihara died at Keio University Hospital, where he had been treated since May, a hospital official said.\n\nIshihara, a native of Kobe in western Japan, made his movie debut in 1956. He appeared in “Season of the Sun” while he was a student at Keio University. The movie was based on a book writted by his elder brother, Shintaro Ishihara, a novelist and now a member of Parliament. It depicted a modern youth who resisted established ideals in postwar Japan.\n\nIshihara later played leading roles as a rebellious youth in numerous action films, including “A Man Calling for a Storm.”\n\nIshihara is survived by his wife, Mie Kitahara, a former actress."
