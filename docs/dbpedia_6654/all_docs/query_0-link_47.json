        "text": "December 31, 2023\n\nMy take on this book won't be your usual review—it's more like a relaxed discussion about why I was eager to delve into it, a handful of essential aspects about the book, throwing in some critique and counter-arguments, positive aspects of the book and wrapping it up with my actual review.\n\nA few Important Things Regarding This Book: \"The Japan That Can Say No: Why Japan Will Be First Among Equals\" is a 1989 essay originally co-authored by Shintaro Ishihara, the then Minister of Transport and a leading figure from the Liberal Democratic Party who would become Governor of Tokyo for 13 years (1999-2012); and SONY Corporation co-founder and chairman Akio Morita. These essays were derived from their earlier speeches. In general, Ishihara's essays argue that Japan is a world power to be respected, and that Japanese need to assert themselves more when dealing with the U.S. Morita's essays focus more on the tragic flaws of U.S. companies that will eventually lead to America’s decline, and what Japan can do to improve its image and position. Initially a hit in Japan, the book sparked controversy when the Pentagon illegally translated and circulated it in late '80s Washington, filled with numerous mistranslations and significant misrepresentation of the authors' intentions. This controversy prompted Morita's disassociation from the book, primarily due to Sony's thriving business in the USA, to avoid risking Sony's future prospects there. Consequently, the authorized 1991 Simon & Schuster English translation by Frank Baldwin omitted Morita's essays.\n\nReasons Behind Reading This Book: The reason behind picking up this book might seem amusing, but it's a reflection of my strong connection to the name \"Sony.\" Call it an odd coincidence, but being nicknamed Sony inadvertently made me gravitate towards products of the Sony corporation. And as fate would have it, the quality and excellence of their products simply won me over. This admiration for the company grew even more profound as I delved into studying Business Administration. Naturally, I was eager to learn more about the minds behind Sony, particularly Masaru Ibuka and Akio Morita. My journey started with Akio Morita's \"Made in Japan,\" a book that left me utterly captivated and hungry for more of Morita's writings. That's how I stumbled upon this book. However, obtaining the original version of this book proved to be quite the challenge.\n\nCritics: While highlighting concerns about trade imbalances and gaps in innovation, the book is criticized for its extreme, nationalistic tones and lack of depth in providing practical solutions. Anyway, here are the main criticisms distilled into bullet points:\n\n• Nationalistic, divisive \"Japan vs West\" stance advocating Japanese superiority.\n\n• Lack of depth, nuance, and objective analysis; relies on emotional rhetoric.\n\n• Outdated, xenophobic cultural superiority attitudes lacking practical solutions.\n\n• Ignoring complex economic interdependence and making unreasonable demands for independence.\n\n• Extremist tone dividing more than uniting; lacks feasible policies or constructive ideas.\n\nCounterarguments: Here are counterarguments tailored to directly address each of the five bullet pointed criticisms:\n\no The stance aimed to prompt discussion on balancing the Japan-US relationship, not promote inherent superiority. The bold tone was meant to energize leaders to recalibrate unfair power dynamics.\n\no While lacking in nuance, the passion stemmed from valid economic concerns. The goal was to spark thought-provoking debate, not just provide detailed analysis.\n\no Dismissing their ideas as outdated underestimates the continuing relevance they have. Pragmatic suggestions around workforce development were provided.\n\no Independence calls should be viewed against real instances of trade exploitation that Japan was facing at the time. The critique against the West was meant to inject needed confidence in negotiations.\n\no Extremist tone dividing more than uniting; lacks feasible policies or constructive ideas.\n\no The bold tone aimed to prompt a unified national conversation and energize leaders, not divide them. Specific strategic investments were suggested. But most importantly, those writings were collected from their old speeches to express their thoughts rather than provide clear and specific solutions to every problem. That was never the intention of that book.\n\nPositive Aspects of the Book: There are a couple of positive aspects of this book which still after 34 years of its first publication remains quite relevant in today’s geo-political economy. Some of them are:\n\n Catalyzed valuable national conversations about Japanese identity, pride, and global positioning. Sparked crucial debates that remain relevant on Japan's role and contributions.\n\n Advocated for a more confident and assertive Japanese stance in global affairs. Promoted the idea of Japan as an equal partner rather than subordinate.\n\n Emphasized Japan's strengths in areas like technology, innovation, and cultural heritage. Highlighted the country's unique blend of tradition and innovation.\n\n Encouraged critical reevaluation of power dynamics in international relations. Core themes of autonomy and identity in a complex world still resonate.\n\n Served as a timely call to action for Japan to invest in strategic sectors and assert its interests unapologetically in negotiations.\n\n Boosted Japan's national confidence and self-belief. However, confrontational tone needs to be recontextualized to suit cooperative global focus today.\n\n Addresses enduring themes in international relations and power dynamics, aligning with contemporary discussions on national identity and autonomy.\n\nMain Book Review: Journeys Through a Defiant Decade: Revisiting 'The Japan That Can Say No'.\n\nBy Nazmus Sadat (Sony)\n\nStepping into the portal of Shintaro Ishihara and Akio Morita's 1989 manifesto, \"The Japan That Can Say No,\" transports one back to an era of brewing change in Japan's socio-economic identity. This collection of bold essays by an influential politician and the visionary co-founder of Sony ignited heated debates that still echo today.\n\nNow, let me introduce you to what catalyzed my own dive into this intriguing piece of literature: it stems from an uncanny personal connection to the name \"Sony\" and an unquenchable thirst for insights. My moniker 'Sony', rooted in profound admiration for the corporation's innovations, naturally steered me toward Morita's reservoir of intellectual thought. From the absorbing memoir 'Made in Japan' to this controversial opus, the magnetic pull of exploring unfiltered ideas was irresistible.\n\nThe book itself captures a nation at a crossroads, torn between asserting itself as a confident powerhouse and accepting a subordinate status quo. Ishihara pushes forcefully for the former, advocating for Japan's interests against Western mistreatment. Morita contributes critical assessments of American corporate practices in contrast to Japan's rise. Their impassioned interplay mirrors Japan's internal turmoil.\n\nValid critiques point to the confrontational tone and lack of policy specifics. But on closer inspection, the adversarial rhetoric aimed more to sound an urgent alarm against complacency than fuel actual antagonism. The zealous tone was intended to stir the Japanese spirit from resignation to self-assurance in seizing its destiny.\n\nIts enduring value lies in catalyzing essential discussions on Japan's national identity and its position on the global stage. It urges Japan to assert itself boldly, fostering pride in its technological and cultural heritage. The aspiration for Japan to stand as an equal global player remains pertinent, although the confrontational rhetoric requires a contemporary makeover.\n\nHowever, present-day relevancy warrants recontextualizing the dated hints of superiority within a cooperative diplomatic framework. Japan's future prosperity lies in confidently yet sensitively asserting its strengths. Still, the book's role as a historical mirror reflecting Japan's mindset and debates of the era remains instructive.\n\nFor readers today, \"The Japan That Can Say No\" serves foremost as a window into the national psyche during a defiant decade. It captures the zeitgeist of an ambitious country seeking to redefine its place in the world while wrestling with the limits of that self-determination.\n\nViewed in proper context, the book highlights crucial identity questions that still resonate, though requiring nuanced application for modern diplomacy. Its brazen inspiration to awaken Japan's self-belief holds significance as an impetus for change. With thoughtful recalibration, that vision to elevate Japan globally persists, even as specific policies require evolution.\n\nUltimately, this controversial work elucidates and encapsulates Japan's coming-of-age story in the global arena—tensions, flaws, and all. For insights into the mindset fueling Japan's ascent, it remains a compelling historical touchstone even after the book's first release in 1989. Although the writers were not fortune tellers, one was a patriotic political leader and the other was a genius in technology, their thought and analysis proved to be so true in today’s context, and by doing so, they kept the book as an important international relations document. And I hope that one day, when the time is right, Bangladesh will also learn to say NO.\n\nApril 8, 2011\n\nAnother extreme nationalistic book from Japan. This book sold millions when it was published in Japan. Book was translated to Korean and Chinese and sold million more. It fueled another wave of anti-Japanese sentiment in both countries. \"China can say no\" from China and \"There is no Japan\" from Korea comes to mind. Of course, they were sold millions, too.\n\nI read Korean translated version first, followed by original Japanese text. I was told English version omitted some text(mainly Morita's essay) to not to upset American readers. (You gotta love censorship.) I got curious. So I read.\n\nContent is fairly faithful to original. Translation; however, are \"watered-down\". Effect is similar to watching \"sanitized\" horror movie.\n\nKey features that will amuse english readers are...\n\nWhy Japan should just say No!\n\nWhy American A-Bombed Japan instead of Germany.\n\nWhy world should be dominated by superior Japanese gene and it was a grave mistake for American to interrupt(WWII) such humanitarian efforts.\n\nAmusing indeed.\n\nBy the way, Japan crank out stuff(books, manga, movies, and music) like this regularly. And most of 'em comes out in a month of August. Some, believe it or not, are government issued in a form of school textbook.\n\nI'm giving 4 stars for its entertainment value. It's a fun read in a strange way.\n\nOctober 30, 2017\n\nThe reader that can say \"huh?\"\n\nThis is a collection of badly-translated essays written by two gentlemen of Japan back in the late '80s. One was the chairman of Sony Corp., Morita Akio, and the other, a rather unsavory right-wing politician, Ishihara Shintaro, who later became Governor of Tokyo for 13 years. While I think it would be positive if Japan stood up to the US against some of our more dubious activities, the \"Japan That Can Say No\" takes a narrow, nationalistic tack backed by some doubtful facts as well. That the two authors failed to see that Japan's bubble of the 1980s would someday burst and that that day would come sooner rather than later speaks loudly of the \"wisdom\" of their comments. That Mr. Ishihara thinks that Korea and Taiwan benefitted from Japanese colonialism may be true in the same way that India, Vietnam, or Indonesia \"benefitted\" from European colonial rule. But when he suggests that Singapore (under Japanese military occupation for four years) also owes its later prosperity to Japanese tutelage, I just had to laugh. Americans behave like mad dogs, they are shifty, they are doomed....yeah, well, OK, how y'all doin' ? I wouldn't claim any \"knight in shining armor\" role for the US, but Japan's role on the world stage before 1945 was not marked by much altruism. The most telling point to be made about this book is that Mr. Morita, to his credit, disavowed his participation later on. THE JAPAN THAT CAN SAY \"NO\" created a minor splash at the time, but I think that today it can be forgotten. If you are looking for a good book on Japan's situation up to the mid-1990s, you should take a look at \"The Emptiness of Japanese Affluence\" by Gavan McCormick. That book could be subtitled, \"The Japan That Should Have Said No.\"\n\nJune 18, 2013\n\nAs a cultural touchstone of Japanese attitudes toward America in the late eighties, this has some value; but the majority of Ishihara's arguments have been so blunted by Japan's innumerable failures over the last two decades that its hard to take him seriously, even with the benefit of hindsight. By mid-book, his repeated assertions that the Japanese style of management, etc are better than the American ring so hollow as to be laughable. A perfect iteration of the expression \"pride goeth before a fall\".\n\nAugust 8, 2013\n\nThis is former Tokyo governor Shintaro Ishihara's controversial book calling for Japanese politicians to grow a pair and become more assertive in its foreign policy. It contains many anecdotes in which he outsmarts an unnamed American politician to show some flaw in the American character. He has some valid insights on domestic problems in Japan, but when juxtaposed next to some sexist or xenophobic comment, it is hard to take anything he says seriously.\n\nMarch 8, 2020\n\nHet boek is tussen 2 en 3 sterren op goede momenten. Hoewel er leerzame stukken inzitten die zelfs betrekking hebben op Amerika in 2020, blijf ik toch met het gevoel achter dat het vooral zichzelf schouderklopjes geven is aangevuld met hier en daar interessante inzichten.\n\nRead\n\nJuly 4, 2023\n\nDNF\n\nI'm sure I'd have enjoyed the book a lot more had I read it when it was published. Many political and cultural references from when the book was first written over 4 decades ago seem out of context to me today.\n\nThe introduction of this authorized translation of the book also sounds more like an apology to the US, as it backtracks the criticism to the US that made the original book popular in the first place.\n\nAugust 4, 2019\n\nI read this book way back when it came out in the US.\n\nTalk about bad timing... This book talks about how Japan should be more assertive on the world stage because they have their shit together while the US was teetering economically and really should learn from Japan's example.\n\nShortly thereafter Japan's economy went into a crisis which, nearly thirty years later, I'm not sure they have fully recovered from.\n\nThe US did learn from Japan however which is why the Fed reacted so atypically during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nThis book provides a cautionary tale of how current success can reduce your ability to navigate an unexpected crisis. Or how good fortune leads to undeserved (over)confidence in one's abilities.\n\nRead\n\nDecember 4, 2023\n\nThe publisher should be able to say NO, but that wouldn't deter Ishihara. My favorite author. The bestest of the best XD\n\nNovember 21, 2023\n\nThe Japan That Can Say No is a fantastic piece of late 20th century geopolitical memorabilia. The book is seeing a second breath in 2023 after the success of Chip War by Chris Miller, which has a whole chapter titled after the book.\n\nIt is important to highlight that there are two versions to this book. The “original” version was written only in Japanese by Shintaro Ishihara and Sony’s chairman Akio Morita. This version was illegally translated by the pentagon and circulated in Washington in the late 80s. This version apparently had several misleading translation errors and misrepresented the authors significantly. The second and commonly available version was written only by Ishihara (Morita refused to participate in the latter version due to the uproar caused by the first), including his essays in the first version alongside with other content he later expanded upon. This review pertains to that latter version.\n\nThe book is a far as you can get from a sound foreign policy manifesto or a prediction of geopolitical outcomes in the 30 years that followed its publication. If that’s the expectation the reader carries when picking up the book, the experience will be awful.\n\nNonetheless, if the reader comes seeking an account of the mighty Japan of the 80s, context on the importance of semiconductors in nuclear supremacy, and with an open mind to read American criticism, then the book proves incredibly insightful and oddly relevant to this day.\n\nWhile the economic bubble that propelled Japan to become the world’s second largest economy bursted in the early 90s, the book still contains invaluable insights of the geopolitical landscape that would develop in subsequent years between the U.S. and SE Asian countries. In many sections of the book, one needs only to replace “Japan” with “China” or “Taiwan” to get an staggering portrait of modern economic and political conflict in the pacific.\n\nThe book also contains very meaningful and valid criticism to the United States that hold true to this day. Among which are the American racial biases, the growing political internal division, the underinvestment in STEM education, the move of high skilled manufacturing abroad, the short-term economic mindset of American corporations and many other factors.\n\nThe book gets a little repetitive in several sections, has claims that are outlandish (I.e. that SE Asian countries benefitted from Japanese invasion and colonialism in the past), and some plain wrong predictions about the future - chief among them is that Japan would grow to dominate the 21st century alongside the United States.\n\nBut if the reader is sensible enough to put this aside and intellectually honest enough to take Ishihara’s arguments seriously, they will find an insightful evaluation of American quasi predatory foreign practices alongside with some very relevant words of caution for the future of America.\n\nThis book did not strike me as a far nationalist or far right manifesto for Japanese self-righteousness, as many people believed in the 80s or still believe today. It rather felt like an honest wake up call for the great Japan of the 80s and an attempt to prepare it for the challenges that would come.\n\nReally fascinating book.\n\nJuly 26, 2022\n\nVery interesting as a period piece, Ishihara envisions a 21st Century with Japan in the vanguard. Compelling writing, even if some of his predictions (China being a minor player on the international stage) were wildly wrong. Ishihara's recommendations for the United States warrant particular scrutiny, as some are issues still being debated today, such as Americans neglecting mass transit and remaining wed to \"car culture\".\n\nMay 2, 2024\n\nI, too, believe that Japan, or any other country, for that matter, should be less dependent on America or the other neoimperialist powers. But that book was just constantly repeating right winger schlock.\n\nMay 17, 2024\n\nIshihara's book caused quite a storm in Japan and the United States, selling over a million copies. Among American readers, it garnered fury over what was perceived, and I would argue correctly, as a nationalistic and belligerent argument from Ishihara.\n\nIn the book, Ishihara makes bold claims and predictions, with the most important and controversial being that Japan must no longer serve at the whim of the United States. He argues for a more independent and bolder Japan claiming that the U.S. must come to terms with Japan's economic rise(at the time of publishing Japan had undergone an incredible economic revolution and many predicted it would eclipse the United States). He argued for a more equal relationship and believed that U.S.-Japan relations would be the most significant relationship in the 21st century. Ishihara's predictions were bold and antagonizing to many in the United States, where Japan-bashing had become increasingly prominent. Although the collapse of Japan's asset bubble and the subsequent economic stagnation have dismissed many of his predictions, the book serves as an important piece in understanding U.S.-Japan relations.\n\nApril 18, 2016\n\n\"Among themselves, however, they could talk of American irrational, pomposity, ignorance, and inferiority, assuming that it would not be noticed. Frank discussions disparaging non-yellow races, and women who wanted to work or carry on political movements could appear in the Japanese press with little worry about America's different sensibilities.\" (8)\n\n\"If Japan told Washington it would no longer sell computer chips to the United States, the Pentagon would be totally helpless. Furthermore, the global military balance could be completely upset if Japan decided to sell its computer chips to the Soviet Union instead of the United States.\" (21)\n\n\"we owe this talent to our geographic location as an island cul de sac off the continent of Asia, the final stopping point of the religious and intellectual movements that spread across the mainland in ancient times. Energy that might have gone, for example, into transmitting the glory of Buddhist art to other lands turned inward. An accident of geography made us adept at refining, embellishing, and improving.\" (57)\n\n\"Without nationalism -- a strong sense of roots and identity -- there cannot be internationalism, only a shallow cosmopolitanism.\" (76)\n\nNovember 27, 2016\n\nIt is amazing to think about how the balance of power has shifted, since this book was published twenty five years ago."
