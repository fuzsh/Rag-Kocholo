        "text": "On Oct. 25, Tokyo Gov. Shintaro Ishihara announced his resignation from office. He now plans to stand for election to the Diet as head of a new conservative party. He suggested political alliances with other conservative reactionaries and xenophobes, including Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto and Tachiagare Nippon (Sunrise Party of Japan) chief Takeo Hiranuma (Just Be Cause, Feb. 2, 2010). And all before a Lower House election that must be held within ten months.\n\nI say: Bring it on. Because it's time for somebody to make clear which way Japan is heading.\n\nThe world's media has largely misunderstood — or misrepresented — what kind of an elected official Ishihara is, often portraying him as a \"nationalist\" (which sounds like a patriot). He is in fact a hate-mongering racist bigot."
