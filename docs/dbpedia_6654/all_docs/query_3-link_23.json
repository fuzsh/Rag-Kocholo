        "text": "The generation-defining masterpiece penned by Akutagawa Prize-winning author Shintaro Ishihara proved to be Nikkatsu’s first crossover hit. This Sun Tribe film details the frequently scandalous whims of two listless postwar youth. While cruising Tokyo Ginza one weekend, sullen college student and boxer Tetsuya falls for poor little rich girl Eiko, and the pair embark on a mutually self-destructing romance. Yujiro Ishihara makes the vibrant onscreen debut that made him a symbol of postwar youth Sun Tribe rebellion, while the taboo-shattering depictions of sex, gambling, and violence remain striking."
