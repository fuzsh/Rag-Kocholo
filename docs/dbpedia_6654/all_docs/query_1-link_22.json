I was like a lot of other Americans in that era who felt superior to the Japanese for a variety of reasons, including the outcome of the war, the U.S. GNP, the high level of Major League Baseball, Hollywood movies, rock music and any number of other things.\n\nI thought that in my naivete and stupidity during that time that the USA would automatically be loved and respected by right thinking people. It took me a while to realize that I was wrong and that Japan was superior to the U.S. in many ways, that Tokyo was a superior city to New York, and that there were many Japanese who were the mirror image of me, in other words who felt just as superior to me as I did towards them. This was especially so during the Bubble Era."
