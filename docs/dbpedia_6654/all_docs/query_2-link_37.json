        "text": "By Tim Eldred, November 2010\n\nThis is the tribute I knew I’d have to write one day, but I never could have guessed the timing or the circumstances.\n\nYoshinobu Nishizaki, Executive Producer and Creator of Space Battleship Yamato, died on November 7, 2010, by accidental drowning. He was 75. Tokyograph.com reported the news within hours of his passing, as did all the other major news outlets in Japan:\n\nAt around 12:35pm on November 7, the Coast Guard received word that Nishizaki had fallen into the water from a ship named Yamato (485 tons), while it was docked at Futami Harbor of Chichi-jima (part of the Bonin Islands). A rescue boat was able to retrieve him about 20 minutes later, but he died shortly after that.\n\nYamato had docked at Futami Harbor the night before. On the morning of the accident, the ship had completed a trial voyage within the harbor. Nishizaki was wearing a wetsuit and was apparently preparing for a dive at the time that he fell from the ship.\n\nAn ignoble end to a remarkable life. The best that can be said about it was that, like the man himself, it was extremely unusual.\n\nRight from the beginning, he was a very different sort of fellow. When his college friends entered the shadowy world of the salaryman, he followed his bliss into the music and entertainment industries. He was a showman in his 20s, working theaters and nightclubs as host, manager, and occasionally a bartender. He was a showbiz entrepreneur at 27 with the founding of Office Academy to produce live music events, and a world traveler in his 30s when most of his contemporaries stayed on familiar ground.\n\nEighteen months of European travel in the late 60s introduced Nishizaki to a larger world which he evidently brought home with him; his career in music promotion taught him that an audience responded to an individual and this lesson would be applied just a few years after he entered the ranks of anime production as Osamu Tezuka’s business manager in 1970.\n\nHis tenure at Tezuka’s Mushi Pro Studio embroiled Nishizaki in his first controversy, a bureaucratic mixup that gave Nishizaki himself the animation copyright to two Tezuka properties, Triton of the Sea and Wansa-kun. After Mushi’s subsequent bankruptcy, he turned them both into TV series that received only tepid ratings. That’s when he began to develop Yamato as a last-ditch effort to stay in the business. As we know, its initial ratings were also a disappointment. But even as he backed off from anime (and into foreign film acquisition) he didn’t give up on his brainchild…and three years of hard slogging finally brought it back as a feature film.\n\nThat was when Nishizaki the producer became Nishizaki the rock star. When the first news leaked in about the huge crowds massing to see the movie in August 1977, he had to see it for himself. As fans gathered around him in the street, it must have reminded him of the power of celebrity he saw in his days of music promotion. From then on, in the eyes of the fans, he was the voice and face of Yamato. The role of figurehead was something new to anime, and he embraced it with relish. The final crossover occurred when he actually appeared onscreen in Farewell to Yamato, cheering for Yamato‘s success exactly as in real life. (Shown below.)\n\nIn an industry where everyone was expected work in quiet support of one another, Nishizaki tilted heads and raised eyebrows wherever he went. Never content with his lot, he always pushed for something better regardless of the inevitable grumbling that emerged from the trenches. This is the fate of all dreamers who can’t keep their dreams to themselves.\n\nThis is the kind of man it took to create Space Battleship Yamato and revolutionize an industry: a visionary taskmaster who was impossible to satisfy, who always put the work ahead of the workers, and lived by the mantra that if you push yourself past your limits, you’ll have no regrets afterward. Those who were used to a more stable, regimented production environment where expectations were always carefully managed, had to adapt or break. More than one colleague started out with resentment, evolved to grudging respect, and finally developed admiration for him.\n\n“I’m never going to work for that guy again,” was a common refrain uttered by many throughout the Yamato production years, but more often than not those who said it could later be found plugging away at the next Yamato project. There was quite simply nothing else like it. Demanding? Naturally. Infuriating? Without a doubt. Satisfying? Completely. Moreover, it was empowering; everyone else in the business knew what Nishizaki’s Yamato veterans had been through, and they were welcomed wherever they went afterward.\n\nEven when it was supposedly over with Final Yamato in 1983, it wasn’t over for Nishizaki. The very next year he announced his plans to bring Yamato back and he spent the rest of his life trying to bring them to fruition. Plenty of other projects got done in the meantime; Odin in 1985, a live-action teen romance called A Passenger in 1987, the notorious Legend of the Overfiend in 1989, and numerous businesses that came and went along with their temporary fortunes.\n\nThings finally started coming back together in the early 90s when Yamato 2520 and Yamato Resurrection went into pre-production, but critical errors in judgment knocked them off the rails by the middle of the decade and a new phase of Nishizaki’s life began, one of demoralizing complications with the law, the courts, and incarceration. At the lowest point, he was challenged for authorship of Yamato itself. But this was the one thing no one could take from him. Even those who had ended up on the south side of a business deal with Nishizaki could not begrudge him his greatest creation, the one that forever changed Japanese pop culture. And so he prevailed.\n\nEmerging from this personal morass in December 2007, he immediately put his life’s work back where it belonged, at the top of his priority list. The Space Battleship Yamato copyright was now wholly owned by Tohokushinsha Film Company, but Nishizaki retained the rights to make a sequel, and he exercised those rights by establishing Yamato Studio in the summer of 2008 to pick up where he left off with Resurrection.\n\nWe all know the result of that, but only when we have a picture of the personal victory it represents do we begin to appreciate its personal significance. It’s very tempting to imagine Nishizaki in his darkest moments, waiting for the day when creative freedom is back in his hands, Yamato drifting high up in standby orbit until it is called upon to save not just the Earth, but its own creator.\n\nKnowing this, it’s incredibly moving to see the footage of a stooped, 74-year-old Nishizaki on stage at the November 28, 2009 preview screening. His body bent with pain from recently cracked ribs, he struggles to contain his emotions. In what was to be his last appearance before the most devoted Yamato fans in the world, he tries to be the unassuming gentleman his contemporaries would have preferred, but his entire life catches up to him at that moment and his voice cracks sharply as he receives the reward for everything he endured.\n\nThe box office returns from Yamato Resurrection were disappointing, but seemed not to discourage him at all. He had already written his scenario for a followup with the intention of simply reviewing the script and storyboards from the comfort of his retirement. Until that day, he busied himself overseeing a Director’s Cut of the film with restored footage to be presented at some future time. As of this writing, no official announcement has been made about that project, but when completed it will almost certainly be dedicated solely to him.\n\nIn the final analysis, no one can speak for Yoshinobu Nishizaki better than he himself. We’ve been translating and presenting his words for years at this website and will continue to do so for some time. (The man was nothing if not talkative.) The links below will take you to all the major pieces we currently have to offer.\n\nThose who worked with the man have said plenty about him, and will no doubt add to the record in light of his passing. But to close this particular retrospective, nothing could be more appropriate than this passage from Itaru Yoshida. He was Toei’s liaison during the development of Farewell to Yamato, a full participant in the story sessions and an eyewitness to Nishizaki at the peak of his creative power. It’s hard to imagine anyone disputing Yoshida’s sentiment:\n\nI will describe my feelings about working with Mr. Nishizaki, but I have to grasp for words that might sound bad. It is severely demanding. For example, in any meeting even if the conclusion is that a certain idea is good, there is still a push to find a better one. This is what I reflected upon the most as an employee producer. A typical salaryman begrudges these conditions, but I feel such force from Producer Nishizaki that it wakes me up and pushes me past my limits to do the job. The many people whose minds and talents gather around his strong personality cannot help but make incredible work that challenges the field of animation.\n\nAnd now that challenge is eternal."
