        "text": "Crazed Fruit is the first real sexploitation movie I’ve found from Japan. This is an unusual reading of this particular movie, but I think one that should not be ignored. Most of this exploitation focuses on Mie Kitahara who was at the time of this movie still in her very early 20s and one of the most “western” of all of the Japanese actresses, both in appearance and in her roles.\n\nThe plot is fairly simple. Two brothers fall in fall in love with a mysterious woman, played by Kitahara. One brother is naive, the other experienced with women. In this case they both come from a very well-to-do family, which means they operate in the Japanese milieu of spoiled rich kids. This group was referred to as the Sun Tribe by Shintaro Ishihara, the novelist on whose work the movie was based, because they spent a lot of time at the beach, tanning, sailing, water-skiing, or just general partying in their shorts and Hawaiian shirts.\n\nHow many of these Sun Tribe children there might have been is unclear; if they existed at all, they were a tiny, tiny proportion of the youth of the day. But they were an attractive fantasy, especially to young males. And this is a movie aimed at young males. One shot makes the point, almost without needing further comment. The scene at the top where the young brother has his first kiss with Kitahara in her demure party dress seems pure and innocent enough, but this is preceded by this shot.\n\nNotice what is in focus. Everything is out of focus except her breasts. Admittedly, by the standards of 2018, that is still pretty demure and it is certainly a long way from the pinku movies of the seventies, but the tight, sharp focus leaves no doubt that there was nothing accidental about the shot. I’ve seen a lot of American movies from 1955-6 (and at least a few French and Scandinavian ones) with that same dress, but never photographed from that angle. The director and photographer could not have done more to say “Let’s all look down her dress” except perhaps to insert flashing arrows.\n\nThis is immediately followed by a shot looking up her skirt rather farther than her hemline should allow.\n\nAnd just in case we thought these were still accidental, there’s the scene in her babydoll nightie,\n\nor the moment when she pulls his hand onto her breast\n\nor the long lingering view of her walk up the hill from the beach (in shorts, of course, but shorts whose tone fades into her skin.)\n\nGiven all of that, it’s not so surprising that its first American distributor called it Juvenile Jungle.\n\nJapanese movies had long recognized sex as a significant subject, but they had not really sold the physical siren prior to this feature (as far as I have found). The sirens tended to be great beauties, not great bodies, who lure men by their grace and charm (see Ugetsu Monogotari, for example). And Kitahara’s character is no ingenue in spite of her youthful face and age. She lives with an American businessman at least twice her age, to whom she claims to be married, but this does not stop her from a string of affairs, including one with the older brother who purposely sets out to take her from his younger brother and succeeds, leading to the deadly climax.\n\nThis is not to argue that Crazed Fruit should be automatically dismissed. It is a tight little melodrama, well acted (at least by Kitahara) and sometimes photographed with considerable skill. And there can be no doubt that it revealed for the first time in Japan the existence of a new youth market, much as was being discovered simultaneously in America with the rise of the drive-in and of rock-and-roll. For young men trapped in 12-hour-a-day jobs and living in one or two rooms with their parents, it was a beautiful fantasy world where no one worked and had no parental supervision or demands, yet had plenty of time and money to party with young women who were gorgeous and willing.\n\nIts success was of course not dependant entirely on Mie Kitahara’s figure. Young women in particular fell in love with Yujiro Ishihara, who played the elder brother and who was apparently cast for no reason except that he was the novelist’s brother and had supposedly lived the Sun Tribe life. But he also seemed to embody something of the zeitgeist for young men as well, so Ishihara almost overnight became Japan’s biggest box-office star, He was immediately thrown into a string of youth movies, often paired with Kitahara again until her retirement after their eventual marriage. (They were the Bennifer or Brangelina of their era.) Nikkatsu in particular, where this film was made, built an entire brand around Ishihara. They called this “borderless action,” set in a place that only nominally was Japan, with fast cars, beautiful women, and two-fisted young heroes as spies, cops, jazz musicians, and loner criminals all played by a set of actors of similar age and appearance as Ishihara. Few if any of these follow-up features had anything to do with reality, even by the standards of the movies, but they raked in the younger audiences in particular. And few were focused on sex. That would come later, especially at Nikkatsu.\n\nNevertheless, Crazed Fruit stands as another example of the movie that turned out to be far more than it apparently was ever intended to be. By the standards of its time a sleazy little low-budget quickie, it caught a tide that no one really knew was there until it appeared, and it still stands as a remarkable achievement."
