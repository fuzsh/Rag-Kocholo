        "text": "THE JAPAN THAT CAN SAY NOBy Shintaro Ishihara\n\nSimon & Schuster, $18.95\n\nReviewed by George L. Fleming\n\nThe primary thrust of Shintaro Ishihara's The Japan That Can Say No is that the Japanese government and business community no longer will stand for some of the treatment they have been getting from the United States.\n\nIshihara claims the United States has been pushing around his nation for decades, particularly regarding business developments, currency strategies, debtor/creditor relationships and trade practices within the semiconductor and automobile industries.\n\nKeep it up, the author warns, and Japan might sell crucial defense technology to the Soviet Union and to China, and not to the United States.\n\nIshihara is a respected novelist and film director in Japan and has been a member of the conservative Liberal Democratic Party since 1968.\n\nThe publishing of The Japan That Can Say No had its own controversy.\n\nFirst published in Japan last year, Sony chairman Akio Morita co-authored the book with Ishihara.\n\nA bootleg translation soon appeared within the Washington beltway, and protests from American politicians and diplomats followed.\n\n\"In January 1990, I discovered that the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency was behind the piracy,\" Ishihara claims.\n\nHe said a supposedly poor translation caused some of the controversy.\n\nWhen Ishihara proposed an authorized English translation of the book to Morita in late 1990, the Sony chairman refused to allow his portions to be published in the translation.\n\n\"Our situations are different, of course,\" Ishihara said of himself and Morita.\n\n\"As a businessman, he must consider the consequences of adverse publicity, while I am free to speak for myself.\"\n\nIshihara replaced Morita's comments with some of his own previously published articles.\n\nMorita is not totally absent from the text, because Ishihara uses him as a foil to develop his argument.\n\nConsider this example.\n\n\"Half the staff in Japan's embassies should be from the private sector, not part of the career foreign service,\" Ishihara writes.\n\n\"Thousands of Japanese executives have crossed swords with their American or European counterparts in tough business dealings. Akio Morita, for example, would make a splendid ambassador to Washington.\"\n\nThe most inflammatory aspect of this book is its author's claims that Americans generally do not understand the Japanese culture and often are racist toward his countrymen.\n\nIshihara reserves some of his sharpest criticism for corporate America.\n\nHe cites Morita's comment that \"The United States looks 10 minutes ahead while Japan looks 10 years ahead.\"\n\nOur corporations' preoccupation with quick profits and debt accumulation drains managerial energy, Ishihara said.\n\nWhile he mentions some U.S. corporations as demonstrating a longer view toward growth, including Florida Power and Light, he believes that the \"10-minute mentality\" is all too pervasive.\n\n\"Stockholder demands for high dividends not only encourage management to play the money game but also hamper efforts to enhance profitability through research and development, new products, boosting sales, and gradually acquiring a larger market share,\" Ishihara writes.\n\nThe Japan That Can Say No is neither exhaustive nor unbiased. But if it were to be supplemented with other books on Japan and the United States' shared economies, such as David Halberstam's The Reckoning, Albert J. Alletzhauser's The House of Nomura and Daniel J. Burstein's Yen!, then Ishihara's comments will be amply engaging.\n\n- George L. Fleming is a free-lance business writer who lives in Brandon."
