        "meta_description": "In this omnibus film centered on love, François Truffaut's segment is about teenaged Antoine (Jean-Pierre Léaud) who has an unrequited passion for his girlfriend, Colette (Marie-France Pisier). In the story by Renzo Rossellini, Leonardo (Geronimo Meynier) trades in his mistress for one with more money and tenderness. Director Shintarô Ishihara's segment concerns twisted love; Marcel Ophüls' tale is about a single mother; and Andrzej Wajda tells a story of love across the generational divide.",
