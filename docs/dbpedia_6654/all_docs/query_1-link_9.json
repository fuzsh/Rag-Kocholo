        "text": "So what might be the best way to attract your attention to a New Wave classic that is both worth-watching and worth 86 minutes of the time of your life? Well, listing is always more attractive to the eye. So, this film is many things:\n\n- Kô Nakahira's debut, who is one of the important names in the Japanese New Wave.\n\n- Controversial upon its initial release because of its depiction of delinquent Japanese youth.\n\n- Considered as the pioneer work in the Japanese \"taiyozoku\" (sun tribe) subgenre, characterized by a notorious lack of adult presence, and the characters embodying the yearnings of Japan's post-war disillusioned youth.\n\n- A predecessor not to the French New Wave (many Nouvelle Vague followers,…\n\nFifth Review for The Collab Weekly Movie Watch\n\nAm I the only one who noticed the Spongebob Squarepants riffs in the main theme song? Apart from being a bit distracting, the song also caught the fancy tropical (?) setting and the whole \"Summer Love\" concept that really define this movie's romance.\n\nIts jazzy elements make up for the film's darkest and most sensual moments. In the course of our two leads becoming more enthralled into this dangerous romance that will put their friendship in danger, the music in here serves as a great tool to translate many of the emotional twists and turns our leads go through as they go down this rabbit hole that is their relationship with this…\n\nTwo boys that have everything in the world. The adults, curiously absent, either rebuilding the land recently destroyed, or buried underneath it. Boats and clothes and free time are their reward.\n\nBut they want more.\n\nThey want love and power, the two things that money can pretend to buy, but they always end up being cheap knock-offs; missing important pieces and covered in cheap paint that comes off in your hands.\n\nBut they do not learn anything from their impatience. Who is there to teach them? The patient hand misses out in their world. To hesitate is to be last. You must take what you want, lest it go to the more deserving…the weak.\n\nBut, surely, you can’t win all…\n\nViewed with the Amazing Edith's *Collab Film Group*.\n\nIn my high school years I was head over heels for this one girl. Even now I do not know if I could explain the “why”. My freshman schedule was loaded. I was in honors classes across the board, was one of only two froshies to make the school’s symphonic band, did marching band, played football and did lighting for the school play. It was sheer madness. I remember finishing a regular school day, finally having 30 minutes to myself, before I needed to head to football practice for 2 hours to only then go to marching band practice for another 3 hours after that. All of this to say I somehow…\n\nCrazed Fruit is essential viewing for admirers of the Japanese New Wave. It pairs nicely with the collection of Japanese films released between the 1990s and mid-2000s that portray disaffected youth too. Its influence is apparent, and it miraculously still feels ahead of its time rather than dated.\n\nWriter Shintarō Ishihara (who later became a right-wing governor of Tokyo) connected with his fellow young peers in 1950s postwar Japan through the stories he wrote. His stories resonated so much that adapting them to the big screen proved a lucrative and influential decision. He captured their feelings of disillusionment, boredom, and uncertainty – feelings that younger people everywhere were experiencing in the postwar world. In Japan, the older generations described the…\n\nWatched with The Collab.\n\nIn 1959, William R. Vizzard published a remarkably insightful article in Sociologus, comparing the tayiōzoku (\"sun tribe\") movement in Japan with its countercultural contemporaries, American beatniks and Teddy Boys in England. While Professor Vizzard found both similarities and differences across the three, his analysis unintentionally draws remarkably strong links between the sun tribe and American flappers.\n\nBoth groups emerged after a war, an experience which, no matter one's background, often leads to \"loosened moral rules\" at home, alongside increasing resistance to social rules and structures that seem both arbitrary and irrelevant in the wake of widespread destruction and death. Similarly, both groups benefited from increased postwar access to birth control, with American GIs bringing condoms home…\n\nThis movie romanticizes everything to do with being young and beautiful in the Japanese summer except for romance itself. I watched this movie in my cozy air conditioned living room as the Minnesota heat reached nearly 100 degrees, ready to be enveloped by a tawdry and exciting love triangle, but I was drawn in by other things; the brothers' egos and emotions turned into a minor footnote as the movie progressed.\n\nThe glittering ocean, hugging the moonlit beach where you share a first kiss.\n\nThe feeling of electric excitement when you walk into a party, hearing the music before you even open the door, wearing your favorite white dress, ready for your first glass of champagne.\n\nLong days, time slowly…\n\nDaaamn! That ending, though! Haha! Clap hands!\n\nThe upper-class leisure generation born into the “moral decay” of Japanese society after the war, lots of boys posturing to possess women as extensions of their own insufferable inadequacies, and one women making bad choices because of a libido suppressed to a boiling point - it all makes for real smooth - if a little silly - cinema for about 83 minutes... and then, blammo! Clap hands!\n\nMie Kitahara (christ is she stunning) is out here trying to be three women at once. Youthful innocence, “My mom is such a busy body!”; married domestic; and sexually-free coal fire stoked hot enough to give herself over to the world’s most pleasurable impulses. But instead…\n\n1st Kō Nakahira\n\nJapan after WW2 was a devastated country, economically and spiritually. To help them recover, the US-led Allied Powers imposed a period of assisted government and the 1947 Constitution, which prohibits the Japanese from the ability to wage war. This Western power suddenly gave rise to a great deal of American culture entering Japanese society for the first time. Objects like Ketchup, Chrysler cars and refrigerators came to the ordinary consumer for the first time. Ten or so years later, the children born during the war became teenagers, and the more apathetic and bougeois became part of what was called the 'taiyo zoku', or 'Sun Tribe', the focus of this film. Interestingly, 'zoku' means 'tribe' or 'clan' and…\n\nShintaro Ishihara's career as a writer is often overlooked due to his political profession, acting as the Governor of Tokyo from 1999 to 2013 and one of the most prominent right-wing politicians before he retired in 2014 (which resulted in many controversial stances and remarks involving xenophobia, homophobia, contempt towards women post-menopause, and other embarrassing hot takes from a delusional old man), yet his earliest novels found a talent in tapping into the disillusion that the youth in a postwar Japan ended up facing and cutting through the facade of decadent, shallow lifestyles wasted in excessive affluence and nihilism that many teen/young adult readers saw and grew uncomfortable in seeing themselves in. His sophomore novel, Crazed Fruit, is practically impossible…"
