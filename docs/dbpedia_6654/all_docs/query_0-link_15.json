        "text": "Five little \"cinemanecdotes,\" to coin a convenient word, each a minor observation of the working of young love, and each made by a different young director from a different country, are strung together in \"Love at Twenty.\" This French-produced omnibus film, which was postponed for weeks because of the newspaper strike, opened at the Murray Hill yesterday.No particular theme or text runs through it, no consistent theory about love, save perhaps that it is something the youngsters let upset them much more than they should. Somebody suffers a good deal in each of the episodes. Lack of communication seems to be the cause.In the first episode, a French one made by Francois Trussaut, a sensitive young man is put through the wringer by a friendly but unresponsive girl. It is an everyday situation, played with stiff and silent charm by Jean-Pierre Leaud, who was the lonely outcast boy in\" The 400 Blows,\" and Marie-France Pisier, a nimble and provokingly casual mademoiselle. It is a wistful little contemplation of a minor frustration of love.The second tells of the torment of a pretty Roman girl who loses her poor young lover to an older and wealthy woman. And the third is a morbid observation of the frenzy of a young worker in Japan who cannot summon the courage to speak to a girl he has admired.Renzo Rossellini, son of Roberto, directed the Italian bit, which has no particular distinction. However, the Japanese anecdote, directed by Shintaro Ishihara, has a weird, grotesque quality. It makes one wonder whether it fairly reflects the state of young love in Japan.Likewise, a German episode, directed by Marcel Ophuls, son of Max, gives a rather dubious notion of love in Germany. It tells how an unwed mother finally hooks the casual father of her child. It is charming, but somewhat sentimental for the bitter story it tells.The last of the lot, directed by Andrzej Wajda of Poland, is best, being both wistful and reflective of the current temper of youth. A girl is impressed by an act of bravery that an older man performs and takes him home to her apartment. She later shows him the door when he acts in a curious fashion. She thinks he is clumsy or drunk but he is actually remembering a bad experience he had in World War II.These episodes, held together by a series of still photographs of young lovers by Henri Cartier-Bresson, are interesting as youthful exercises, even though they do not tell us much about the \"grand passion\" that we don't already know.English subtitles translate the various languages used in the episode, and a wistful jazz musical theme runs through the whole.\n\nThe CastLOVE AT TWENTY, a collection of five dramatic episodes from five countries.
