        "text": "I haven't seen Kitano in a film in quite a few years. I really enjoyed Battle Royale though! Sonatine is great too.\n\nI've been wanting to see Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence with Takeshi Kitano and David Bowie but the only DVD version I'm aware of is a region 2 PAL disc and I've heard the quality is lousy. I might have to get it anyway since I've been wanting to see this film for years.\n\nAnd of course there are some great Japanese horror films out there. One that I saw recently that seemed to slip off the radar was Marebito. It's a really haunting and surreal film by the director of Ju-On (Takashi Shimizu). Actually, I liked the film even better than Ju-On. It stayed with me for days after I watched it.\n\nThe only thing that would have made Zatoichi better would have been Sergio Leone as director. I think he was inspired by the blind swordsman anyway . . . .\n\nIt's all very stylized.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRNXrKiQRvQ\n\nFrom the recent Beat Takeshi revivial film:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMzDi_-NH8k\n\nHe was a master of iaido (居合道); his weapon the shikomizue (仕込み杖), a Japanese concealed sword disguised as a cane or walking stick, similar to the swordstick.\n\nAttached Files:\n\nzatoichi.jpg\n\nFile size:\n\n14.2 KB\n\nViews:\n\n1\n\nShintaro Katsu was a great actor indeed. As for Zatoichi series, it was lucky for Katsu (which literally means 'win' or 'victory' btw) that the Daiei Studio had a lot of superb directors. One of them was Kenji Misumi who directed the first film of the series, 座頭市物語 (The Tale of Zatoichi) to created the character of Ichi on the screen.\n\nMisumi left a lot of great flicks including the four entries of 子連れ狼 (Lone Wolf and Cub) whose protagonist, 拝一刀 (Ogami Ittou) was acted by Tomisaburo Wakayama, a real elder brother of Katsu.\n\nI own the PAL disc. And I think it is beautifully presented.\n\nCriterion Collection is about to begin the series of Nagisa Ohshima. Perhaps in the future the CC version of MCML will find the way to the US market.\n\nI'm sure you have seen the original RINGU, which is twenty times better than the US remake. The director, Nakata made some other beautiful films including 'Chaos', 'Dark Water' which is again far better than the US remake, and 'Chaos'.\n\n'Chaos' is a sort of a film of 'Vertigo' tradition. It stars Nakatani Miki who appeared in 'RING' as Mai Takano. It is also highly recommended.\n\nThough I don't have good knowledge of Anime at all, I know a few good directors other than Miyazaki.\n\nSatoshi Kon, Makoto Shinkai and Mamoru Oshii are supposed to be familiar names. But one of my best fav director, Keiichi hara, may be a bit obscure. He is known with his six directorial entries of 'Crayon Shin-chan' flicks to the E.U. Some of them like 嵐を呼ぶ モーレツ! オトナ帝国の逆襲 (Los Adultos Contraatacan) and 嵐を呼ぶ アッパレ!戦国大合戦 (Shin Chan el pequeño samurai), along with his recent flick 河童のクゥと夏休み (Summer Days with Coo), are truely masterpieces.\n\nMiike's latest film, Yatterman, the live action adaptation of the 1977 anime of the same name, is enjoying box office success in Japan, while everybody is disappointed by the Hollywood crap, 'Dragon Ball Evolution', another live action adaptation of the comic.\n\nHere is the picture of the lead actress, Kyoko Fukada who was casted in Kitano's Dolls as a pop singer.\n\nOther than Kurosawa, the Criterion box is waiting for you to see.\n\nAnd one more from Criterion.\n\nThanks Yasujiro. I'm not sure where I got my info on a poor transfer but it looks like I might have been mistaken. I went and ordered the DVD from Amazon.UK. I can't believe it as the DVD is only costing me just over $7 plus shipping to the US. I look forward to finally watching it!\n\nYou're very welcome.\n\nCriterion Collection is going to issue two DVDs of Nagisa Oshima, IN THE REALM OF THE SENSES and EMPIRE OF PASSION. The BD of the former will be also available.\n\nTampopo - I will also chime in. The story is about a woman who runs a noodle restaurant meets a truck driver who comes into her place. She wants him to help her make the best noodle restaurant. The story develops as he enlists help to make the restaurant better, but along the way, these other side stories come in, which add so much to the film. The etiquette class, the tooth ache guy, the businessmen, the couple, to name a few. They are not part of the story, but they link together one by one.\n\nGreat contemporary film, hard not to enjoy. These is a US DVD that might be hard to find these days.\n\nAnother vote for Ikiru.\n\nAnother understated piece is Yasujiro Ozu's Tokyo Story is great and features a place I used to live, Onomichi.\n\nSansho The Bailiff, Life of Oharu and Ugetsu Monogatari are great films too by Mizoguchi if you want to dig deeper, happy to see some of these have already been mentioned.\n\nI'd really love to recommend a DVD of the Japanese film with English sub whose author may be lesser known. His name is Sadao Yamanaka and the DVD is Humanity & Paper Balloons(UK R2 only).\n\nHe made 26 films in only 5 years befor his tragic death at 28 in 1938. All 26 films were highly praised as masterpieces, but only three of them are survived today. If he would have survived, he would have been as famous as Ozu and Kurosawa in the world.\n\nA useless trivia.\n\nI watched the DVD of 'Tokyo', an omnibus film by Gondry, Carax and Joon-ho yesterday. In the segment by Carax, a TV announcer was named 'Hideko Takakumo' and there was a picture of an spider ('kumo' in Japanese) in her backdrop. These are references to the Japanese great actress Hideko Takamine and her film 'Ukigumo (or Uki-kumo)' directed by Mikio Naruse. Carax respects the director and the actress very much.\n\nThere's no DVD of Ukigumo with English sub. A shame.\n\nActually, there is, a Region 2 DVD from BFI. The English title is Floating Clouds. I think it's only available as part of their Naruse box set, along with When a Woman Ascends the Stairs and Late Chrysanthemums.\n\nI strongly recommend it too.\n\nThanks for correcting, Matthew. I only checked imdb and didn't notice the box.\n\nNaruse made a lot of films which are on par with the very best of Ozu' masterpieces.\n\nMy best favorite is 'Flowing' (Nagareru). It is an incredible film which is so pure that you can't believe that it is merely a film. IMHO, only some flicks like French Can Can by Renoir could share this kind of purity in the history of cinema.\n\nThis is a picture of Hideko Takanime.\n\nAttached Files:\n\ndeko00.jpg\n\nFile size:\n\n36.2 KB\n\nViews:\n\n0\n\nYou didn't mention Rashomon, which is required viewing. I love High and Low and Ikiru. If you liked Ran you may want to check out Kagemusha too. There are other dircetors obviously but films like Tokyo Story, which is also great, are completely different in tone. Less western.\n\nDid you ever see his another war piece 'Fires on the Plain'? Its approach is more visceral but is well worth to watch. The DVD is available from Criterion Collection.\n\nAnd his 'Tokyo Olympiad' is a grand masterpiece.\n\nI would like to draw your attention to 'Crazed Fruit' directed by Ko Nakahira, which is also available from CC.\n\nThe film was epoch making in some ways. It launched Yujiro Ishihara into the huge stardom in the post war Japan. Virtually it was the first film for which Toru Takemitsu wrote down the music. And it was the film that became a precursor to the French New Wave.\n\nhttp://www.criterion.com/current/posts/373"
