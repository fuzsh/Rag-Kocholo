        "text": "Dear Reader:\n\nToday’s topic is representation in Transitional Hollywood. That’s the era after World War II (the “Golden Age of Hollywood”) but before the New Hollywood era and the fall of the studio system in the late-1960s. Basically, it’s Hollywood, the film industry, society, and the country in transition. We’re talking the end of the star system (i.e. seven-year contracts), the rise of Hollywood agents and independent cinema, competition with television as the great media pastime, shifts in acting style to Method as well as innovations in film technology, but also the nightmares of racism, sexism, and political persecution vis-à-vis the HUAC hearings and McCarthyism. However, we are focusing on racial representation.\n\nTW: Photos of actors in yellowface; racism\n\nIn October 1961, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer released Bridge to the Sun, an American-French co-production adapting the autobiography of Gwen Terasaki (Carroll Baker), a white American woman who married a Japanese diplomat (James Shigeta), and her harrowing experiences in Japan during World War II. While the studio marketed the film’s exotic on-location shooting in Japan and provocative subject matter, critics dismissed the film as conventional and old-fashioned due to its black-and-white cinematography and clear appeal to the “woman’s film” genre of classical Hollywood.\n\nHowever, neither acknowledged, at the time, Bridge’s subtle radicality of casting an Asian actor in a film that both features the rare non-white male-white female interracial romance and reflects on American prejudice against an ethnicity/nationality/culture symbolized by wartime hostilities.\n\nThis entry investigates how Bridge to the Sun, despite its authentic color-conscious casting, portrayal of miscegenation, and direct confrontation of American wartime racism, was less a progressive beacon signaling the transition to more equitable onscreen racial representation but unfortunately, a case study illuminating the industry’s continued legacy of tokenism and lack of meaningful action.\n\nBridge as Text\n\nBridge to the Sun opens with a heavy-handed though still highly symbolic shot of two hands approaching from opposite sides – one fair, one dark – slowly meeting in the middle and clasping. At their first meeting at an embassy luncheon in Washington D.C., Gwen and Terry develop an instant connection. With little travel experience outside her home in Johnson City, Tennessee, the sheltered Gwen cannot deny her attraction to Terry despite attending the party with long-time suitor Fred Tyson. Terry’s behavior is intentionally forward, escorting her to a private room to discuss romantic Japanese art while Gwen unashamedly looks him over.\n\nShe gives him her phone number, and after several weeks of dating, Terry proposes, and they romantically embrace. One broken engagement and a dramatic reunion at a train station later, Gwen and Terry get married, despite the disapproval of his embassy and her family. They honeymoon in Kyoto before returning to his family home in Tokyo. Now living in Japan, Gwen has difficulty adapting to the customs of such a conservative culture, which is tradition-bound and intensely patriarchal even by the standards of the prewar U.S.\n\nInterracial Couples and Asian Representation in 20th-Century Hollywood\n\nForemost, the racial makeup of Bridge’s coupling – a non-white male and white female – was extraordinarily rare in classical (and even postclassical or postwar) Hollywood cinema (Marcetti).\n\nMarcetti’s Romance and the Yellow Peril: Race, Sex, and Discursive Strategies in Hollywood Fiction specifically includes a chapter examining Bridge as an anomaly due to its pairing of a white female and non-white male, which is oft-neglected in favor of other contemporary films featuring Asian-White interracial relations. In the decade preceding Bridge’s production, a majority of interracial romance films with Asian leads were comprised of white males and non-white females (i.e. Chinese, Japanese, and Burmese women), including The Purple Plain (UA, 1954), House of Bamboo (20th Century Fox, 1955), Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing (20th Century Fox, 1955), Sayonara (Warner Bros., 1957), China Doll (UA, 1958), and The World of Suzie Wong (Paramount, 1960).\n\nMany of the popular interracial romantic dramas of the 1950s and 1960s depicted love stories between characters with a significant language barrier, implying that exotic appeal was sufficient to romance rather than mutual communication and understanding. Furthermore, most are plagued by some kind of tragedy. Sayonara does include a subplot implying a developing relationship between Marlon Brando’s American fiancée, Eileen Webster (Patricia Owens), and a Japanese kabuki actor named Nakamura (Ricardo Montalbán) but it is neither central to the narrative nor explicitly stated.\n\nIn contrast, the three memorable Asian male-white female pairings on film were released in the pre- or early classical period of Hollywood, those being The Cheat (DeMille, 1915), Broken Blossoms (Griffith, 1919), and The Bitter Tea of General Yen (Capra, 1933). Sessue Hayakawa’s framing (in The Cheat), during the American period of his film career in the 1910s and 1920s, as an object of desire – less for the female protagonist than for the female spectator – is also an incredibly noteworthy case in Hollywood history as a whole (Marcetti). This sparse representation was weakly bolstered by Anna and the King of Siam (20th Century Fox, 1946) and The King and I (20th Century Fox, 1956), released a decade apart. Samuel Fuller’s The Crimson Kimono (Columbia, 1959), which he helmed four years after House of Bamboo, provides an exception and unique counterexample to be discussed later, however, this survey of Asian interracial cinematic representation reveals the specific strategies Hollywood utilized to mitigate full-blown censure of onscreen miscegenation (i.e., interracial romance).\n\nNonetheless, with certain exceptions, the five films listed prior to Crimson temper their provocative subject matter by 1) casting a white actor in yellowface, 2) omitting any and all physical intimacy between the leads, 3) depicting an often unrequited or at least unequally reciprocated love, and 4) ending every narrative in tragedy. The Cheat is the only example to star an Asian actor (Sessue Hayakawa) but the other strategies remained in place. Yellowface actors included Richard Barthelmess (Blossoms), Nils Asther (Bitter Tea), Rex Harrison (Anna and the King), and the ethnically ambiguous Yul Brynner (King and I). None of the films featured mutual physical intimacy between the leads (aside from a single dance scene in King and I); and, all end in the death/decline of usually the male Asian lead (excepting Lilian Gish’s demise in Blossoms).\n\nThese strategies reaffirmed Asian men as neither sexual nor romantic threats to white womanhood onscreen because the romances were one-sided and not consummated, ending in tragic death for those who participated. The erasure of authentic Asian identity vis-à-vis yellowface further protected the actress’s integrity offscreen. Consequently, the casting of James Shigeta in Asian and Asian-American roles and the characters’ corresponding onscreen treatment was truly radical.\n\nJames Shigeta, Asian Representation in Hollywood, and BRIDGE TO THE SUN\n\nShigeta was born in pre-annexation Hawaii. During World War II, Shigeta and his family were forced into internment camps. Although executed on a smaller scale (relative to the mainland), internment of Japanese-Americans on Hawaii during World War II was still a defining experience for many (Solomon). As a Sansei or third-generation Japanese-American, he was college-educated at the NYU drama school and served in the U.S. Marines during the Korean War (Bergan). However, he only experienced initial fame after moving to Japan, even though he did not speak the language, to pursue a thriving music career.\n\nKnown as the “Frank Sinatra of Japan,” Shigeta broke out on American screens in 1959 in Fuller’s film noir The Crimson Kimono. Like Bridge to the Sun, the film rebels against the conventional strategies by casting an actual Asian actor, portraying a mutual sexual and romantic attraction, and depicting physical interracial intimacy between its Asian male lead (Shigeta’s Detective Joe Kojaku) and the white female love interest (Victoria Shaw’s Christine Downes).\n\nMiscegenation onscreen was expressly forbidden from 1930 until 1956, although more targeted at Black-white relations (Hayes, “The Production Code”). Consequently, physical contact in films past was consciously regulated, from the desexualized nursing of Blossoms and the predatory tactics of The Cheat to the unconsummated yearnings of Bitter Tea and King adaptations. Star Barbara Stanwyck attributed the financial disappointment of Bitter Tea to racist backlash to the film’s depiction of miscegenation and open interracial attraction (McBride 281). In contrast, Bridge’s first half is dedicated to the mounting desire and urgent intimacy of Gwen and Terry.\n\nGwen and Terry’s living quarters create a space where their two cultures can compromise; they bathe together, sleep together, and eventually conceive a child named Mariko. Throughout their marriage, they each yearn for the other, which is painfully tested during the war years when Terry is frequently in hiding.\n\nIn the end, Terry survives only a few years into post-war “prosperity,” before sending his wife and child on a ship to America, by far the most emotionally-charged scene of the film. Years of harsh conditions have taken their toll on Terry’s health. In these final moments, Gwen watches Terry kiss Mariko on the nose before she boards the vessel. Then, she embraces her dying husband. Gwen and Terry both know they will not meet again. She hugs him, like anyone leaving on a long voyage would, but at the last minute with a terribly despaired expression and the shadows evident under her wary eyes, clenches her hands tighter around him, knowing this is the last time she will see him alive.\n\nWhile Bridge does end sadly (unlike Crimson), the key distinction between the two Shigeta films is the approach to American racism.\n\nIn Crimson, Joe interprets the agitation of his white friend Charlie to a potential relationship with Christine as racism. The film’s conclusion argues that this is his internalized paranoia rather than his genuine social and political reality (Gates 31-32). Essentially, the racism is a figment of his imagination, a fantastical manifestation of Joe’s desperate need to assimilate into white American society.\n\nBridge entirely sidesteps that problematic discourse by meaningfully reflecting on American prejudice against an ethnicity/nationality/culture symbolized by wartime hostilities and internment little more than a decade earlier. At the end of Gwen’s first date with Terry, she admits she lied to her aunt in order to see him for fear of judgment. By acknowledging the subtle bias this illuminates, Gwen realizes her own prejudices and how awkwardly they coexist with her growing attraction to Terry. When her Aunt Peggy admonishes Gwen’s association with Terry over the “nice boys” she usually dates, Gwen fiercely checks the underlying racism of that statement which connects “nice” and “clean” with white and American at the expense of a Japanese ‘other.’\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Bridge vividly recreates the anti-Japanese animosity directly following the attack on Pearl Harbor through vicious protesters and the hostile expulsion of all Japanese diplomats. The internment of Japanese nationals and Japanese-Americans on U.S. soil did not begin until early 1942 with Executive Order 9066 with focus on the West Coast, perhaps explaining its exclusion from Bridge’s narrative (Roosevelt). Regardless, the range of racist experiences for and against Terry are depicted with veracity and nuance.\n\nFurthermore, Bridge endeavors to humanize the wartime experiences of Japan and the Japanese people. The film perfectly incorporates stock footage, likely shot by soldiers and correspondents, of planes, ships, and bombing campaigns. These real life war experiences are then integrated in with reenactments of both domestic and foreign conditions of war, including patriotic Japanese parades, ration lines, and crowds gathered in small houses around smuggled radios. Through both Gwen and Terry’s conflicts with imperial forces, the film manages a subtle critique of wartime Japan and the totalitarian/ultranationalist ideology that reigned at the time.\n\nBridge also contains dramatic enactments of the villages and cities being bombed; civilians, including children, killed; railroads labored on by prisoners-of-war; and the legendary broadcasts of Tokyo Rose. “Tokyo Rose” is a term referring to a loose network of English-speaking female radio broadcasters who operated as Japanese propagandists during World War II (Shibusawa). The programs were broadcast on the Pacific Front to decrease Allied morale by focusing on military losses and wartime trauma. Moreover, the film explores the tolls of war on the body, mind, and heart. This is evident in Gwen’s transition from a blushing bride to a nearly-haggard mother and wife struggling to survive in the Japanese countryside during the height of the war.\n\nDue to his perceived lack of patriotism in foregoing a powerful diplomatic or military position, Terry spends much of the war on the run. Exhausted and malnourished from years of exposure to the harsh elements of the wilderness while evading the Japanese secret police, Terry must come to accept that his futile attempts to “hold two countries together with his bare hands” have failed.\n\nAll Mixed Up: Biracial Children, Tragedy, and Hollywood\n\nWorld War II may have placed the two countries at odds, but Gwen and Terry’s union and subsequent child Mariko are the true “bridge between two worlds” as stated by the film’s advertising. The prospect of biracial children resulting from miscegenation is a frequent topic in interracial films, however, even if such offspring does not appear onscreen, the outlook is generally negative. In Toll of the Sea (Metro, 1923), Anna May Wong’s Lotus Flower gives up her son to his white father and the man’s white wife before walking into the sea to her death. In Sayonara, an airman and his pregnant Japanese wife commit double suicide the day he is meant to be forcibly shipped back to America. China Doll ends with a biracial girl returning to the United States after her Chinese mother and American pilot father are killed during the Japanese occupation of China. Lastly, the titular character in The World of Suzie Wong loses her son, who had gone unclaimed after her affair with a white government official, to a lethal landslide.\n\nThe only hopeful proclamation comes from Marlon Brando’s Major Gruver in Sayonara, although the language used lacks consideration of modern sensibilities:\n\n“[Our children] they’d be half Japanese, half American. They’d be half yella, half white. They’d be half you; they’d be half me. That’s all it gonna be.” [YIKES.]\n\nConsequently, Mariko (Emi Florence Hirsch) proves herself an interesting case study. She is conceived, carried, birthed, and raised during the film’s runtime, no longer an abstract idea but a flesh-and-blood result of an interracial relationship. Moreover, Mariko resides in both the United States and Japan, surviving the war in the latter and returning to the former. She is loved and doted on by both her parents and adjusts to both countries relatively well (any bullying she faces results from her father’s lack of military service rather than her American parentage). Unlike the more common tragic mulatto device, Mariko’s existence is not depicted as an inherent tragedy of torn identity nor is her father’s death attributed to the doom of interracial relations.\n\nReviews, Critics, and BRIDGE’s Lukewarm Reception\n\nLooking at the critical reception of Bridge, U.S. critics clearly did not recommend the film to audiences as they found the film conventional and old-fashioned in terms of storytelling and form. Superficially, the critics recognized the well-worn framework and aesthetics, but even the more favorable reviews ignored those interesting transitional or radical elements. Furthermore, they compared it, mostly disparagingly, to women’s pictures, an extremely popular genre of classical Hollywood.\n\nEast Coast publications reached a general negative consensus surrounding the film and frequently use the now-derogatory term “oriental.” Bosley Crowther (New York Times) criticized the direction as “pedestrian,” and the film for lacking a “solid texture.” Moreover, he egregiously compared James Shigeta to Mr. Moto, and concluded, “Obviously, this is not a picture to be compared with ‘Hiroshima, Mon Amour.’” Mind you, Mr. Moto was a fictional Japanese character, popular from the 1930s well into the 1950s, most often portrayed by a white actor in yellowface.\n\nFrederick H. Guidry (Christian Science Monitor) found the film “tidy and prim,” with its traditional plot of East meets West amounting to “charade.” Claiming Bridge made race somehow inconsequential to the film’s tragic storytelling, Guidry admonished how the film “sacrificed the known plusses of color for the questionable gains in authenticity made possible by brief clips of wartime footage.” The Washington Post deemed Shigeta “fine” but panned the film as formulaic and failing to capture America of the 1930s and 1940s. He ends the review comparing it to “that dreary old thing called a ‘woman’s picture,’” that while “sometimes touching,” is essentially “superficial, old-fashioned film-making.”\n\nArguably, Bridge’s use of black-and-white film does stand out amongst the expected aesthetic of Hollywood movies set in Asian countries. Excepting China Doll, all the films discussed above that were released in the 1950s and 1960s were shot in color to capitalize on their exotic locations or rather, to exoticize nations other than the U.S. However, despite critics’ complaints, the rapid development of contemporary black-and-white film technology as well as Bridge’s serious subject matter align perfectly with the overall trend in the industry’s gradual conversion to color (Kindem 29).\n\nUnusually, the Los Angeles Times published two different reviews on the film, one at the time of release in October but the other more than a month earlier, potentially after one of MGM’s planned sneak previews (“What the Showmen,” Oct. 2). Overall, critics in Hollywood were more complimentary of Bridge. Charles Stinson said the film was “intelligently and tastefully done,” with a professional script, realistic on-location shooting, and good direction. He particularly commended Shigeta as “Hollywood’s new Oriental leading man.” Like the Post, Stinson emphasized the film as portraying a “woman’s view.” Furthermore, although it gave “U.S. audiences a very different viewpoint of World War II,” sometimes “ugly,” the film was still “designed for a feminine audience.” The sentiment towards Bridge’s focus on its female protagonist provides a stark divide between the critics as well as a reminder of overall genre trends.\n\nIn contrast to the heyday of the women’s picture in the 1930s and 1940s, exemplified by Bitter Tea and Anna and the King of Siam, the 1950s and 1960s saw its decline (Neale). Subsequently, films like Sayonara, The Purple Plain, and China Doll fall into the more masculine melodramas that rose to take their place (Russel). Lastly, Philip K. Scheuer, in his L.A. Times feature, makes a provocative comment: “the theme of mixed marriage . . . while no longer a cause for raised eyebrows, at least in the theater . . ..” That statement alone, in context with the film and this era, indicates a level of blindness or ignorance that necessitates this analysis.\n\nBridge as (Para)Text\n\nNext, this paratextual analysis of fan magazines, trade journals, and other contemporary films will substantially problematize the hitherto discussed radicality of Bridge to the Sun. Surveying Bridge’s primary materials provides essential information exposing clear industrial and cultural contradictions through its marketing intensity and strategies, and exhibition methods.\n\nFirst, there is no substantial coverage of this film in fan magazines, whether that be posters, advertisements, photo spreads, interviews, or even production or celebrity blurbs. Samplings of exhibitors’ journals reflect positively on the film and predict good box office for the film due to its authenticity, appealing controversial love story, and antiwar message (Independent Exhibitors Film Bulletin, Jun. 26) as well as its preexisting (primarily female) fan base due to the original novel (Starr, Harrison’s Reports).\n\nHowever, reports from local exhibitors – Oklahoma, Kansas, North Dakota, Vermont, and Indiana (Kendrick; Musselman; Christianson; Spaulding; Hardy) – portray the film as either a mild success or moderate failure, citing multiple times the disappointing lack of color cinematography, overused Eastern setting, and general lack of audience appeal as definitive “non-moneymakers.”\n\nIn the coverage of the film’s actual promotional campaign, the primary material illuminates some startling contradictions. The film’s subject matter deals with miscegenation and prejudice, while the official tagline used in the sparse marketing claims “Their love was a bridge between two worlds!”\n\nBox Office, one of the leading American postwar exhibitor trade papers, consistently suggests appropriation of stereotypical Japanese cultural items for promotion. Tie-ins included marketing with travel bureaus that deal with tourism to Japan as well as collaborating with local art schools for Japanese-style art contests to be highlighted on local television stations (Graves; “Japanese Painting Exhibit”; “Looking Ahead”; “Travel Tieups”).\n\nAcross the board, exhibitors were recommended to utilize Japanese lanterns, bamboo items, umbrellas, tea, and temporary Japanese-style architecture to draw audiences to the theater (“[Lake Charles]”). In Syracuse, New York, they built a rickshaw and hired an unnamed white man to pull an unnamed white woman in Japanese dress around town to advertise the film (“Pony Cart”). They also invited Japanese students, some wearing “their native costume,” to the sneak previews for public display.\n\nThe month prior to its October release, Bridge to the Sun also received a three-page spread that provided ‘viable’ promotional suggestions, like recommending “geisha parties” and using Carroll Baker’s controversial role in Baby Doll (Preminger, 1958) to make “fleshier pitches.” Even as they produced and promoted films about greater tolerance, the commercial interests still maintained marketing strategies that utilized stereotypes and tokenized racial minorities, while also playing to the “controversial aspect” as audience draws.\n\nLastly, there is the matter of James Shigeta’s role in the promotional campaign, or the lack thereof. The film had multiple premieres and promotional events, briefly covered in a handful of publications, but Shigeta is always absent, even from the premiere in Johnson City, Tennessee – the hometown of the protagonist (“What the Showmen,” Aug. 21). Carroll Baker, at that time, would have been a larger star but Shigeta may have been intentionally excluded in the marketing to emphasize Baker solely (“What the Showmen,” Oct. 2). He is only specifically mentioned in TV Radio Mirror (Field), however, it does include a unique instance of continuity of Asian representation in Hollywood, as Shigeta recalls meeting Sessue Hayakawa, the first Asian male star in Hollywood.\n\nShigeta’s Film Legacy and Hollywood “Progressivism”\n\nTwo events serve to significantly undercut the progressive momentum represented by Bridge as an independent text: 1) the outcome of Shigeta’s career in Hollywood and 2) the unremarkable impact on color-conscious casting throughout the rest of the 1960s, illustrated by the contemporary release of two other films with Asian characters in 1961.\n\nFollowing the release of Bridge as well as Flower Drum Song (Universal) in 1961, Shigeta, still in his early 30s, never occupied a romantic male lead role on Hollywood screens again (Shimizu). Instead he acted as secondary leads to Elvis Presley in Paradise, Hawaiian Style (Paramount, 1966) and Doug McClure in Nobody’s Perfect (Universal, 1968) or in lower budget foreign productions like the Italian spaghetti western Death Walks in Laredo (Peri, 1967) and the Filipino-produced Manila, Open City (Romero, 1968).\n\nThe unfortunately short period between 1959 and 1961, where Shigeta starred in four films, did not result in long-term Hollywood stardom. Even his casting in Bridge was at the behest of director Etienne Périer while the studio initially scouted Anthony Perkins (“[Bridge to the Sun Casting]”). Not unlike the Asian actors that preceded him (e.g. Hayakawa, Wong, Kwan), Shigeta burnt bright but faded quickly, leading to no substantial change in Hollywood casting measures or expanded opportunities for aspiring Asian and Asian-American artists. Instead, he turned to television, but did play his most recognizable film role at the age of 59 in Die Hard (McTiernan).\n\nMeanwhile, the end of 1961 saw the release of Breakfast at Tiffany’s (Paramount) and A Majority of One (Warner Bros.). Mickey Rooney’s yellowface performance of photographer Mr. Yunioshi has proven to be one of the most enduringly offensive portrayals of Asian identity in Hollywood history. Despite the individual performance’s sheer audacity, it concurs significantly with the standardized industrial modes and practices of “racial masquerade” during the classical period (Phruksachart).\n\nMajority of One, the less studied of the two, is also an interracial drama depicting the romance between a Jewish widow (Rosalind Russell) and a Japanese businessman and widower (Alec Guinness). Like similar narratives prior, Majority utilizes the conventional strategies to de-escalate the provocative premise, including casting a white actor and omitting all physical contact between the leads (perhaps assisted by expectations for the characters’ mature ages).\n\nJapanese-American actor George Takei, cast in a small part as Guinness’ assistant, commented clearly on the production in his autobiography. Finding the yellowface latex make-up “grotesquely offensive” and the Japanese lines “incomprehensible gibberish,” Takei (also a vocal survivor of wartime internment) expressed his disappointment in the performance as well as his own scenes. In retrospect, Breakfast and Majority are evidently offensive, but Takei’s remembrances supply not only a rare insight but an industry insider’s perspective into the potential Asian perception of Hollywood’s yellowface practices.\n\nYellowface performance continued throughout the 1960s with The Manchurian Candidate (Frankenheimer, 1962), 55 Days at Peking (Ray, 1963), 7 Faces of Dr. Lao (Pal, 1964), Genghis Khan (Levin, 1965), The Return of Mr. Moto (Morris, 1965), 7 Women (Ford, 1966), and You Only Live Twice (Gilbert, 1967). This list does not even account for the conversion of these practices through the rise of television.\n\nFundamentally, Shigeta’s subtle performances are a potentially greater aberration in Hollywood’s continuity of Asian representation. For further reading, Shimizu’s chapter in Global Asian American Popular Cultures is exceptional in its examination of James Shigeta’s legacy and is necessary scholarship for discussing the breadth of representation of Asian actors in Late Hollywood. The piece navigates the shifting definitions of masculinity for Shigeta in their resistance to preconceptions of feminization and emasculation for Asian male characters onscreen.\n\nIn conclusion, Bridge to the Sun is a film worthy of study when investigating the history of race and representation in Transitional Hollywood. The casting of James Shigeta and defiance of conventional racist strategies in the depiction of interracial romance illustrate its oft-neglected value for attempting to challenge the preconceptions of popular trends towards miscegenation in postclassical American cinema. Nevertheless, despite the film’s radical elements, Bridge was neither promoted with cultural sensitivity or conceived with the goal for genuine change, and nor did it spark meaningful change in Hollywood.\n\nTo cheer us up, here’s a photo of James Shigeta with a dog he supposedly adopted while filming Bridge:\n\nAnd maybe a beauty shot?\n\nAnd a gif?\n\nPlease, help. Someone stop me . . . (*breathes deeply*) . . . and I’m done. Thanks for reading!\n\nReferences"
