        "text": "Fresh out of prison for homicide, hardened yakuza Muraki discovers that nothing has changed in the outside world. To shake off the monotony of life, he returns to his old gambling dens and is immediately captivated by a daring, enigmatic young woman of exceptional beauty named Saeko. The two grow closer over their shared disdain for mundanity, yet as Saeko’s appetite for pleasure becomes increasingly destructive, Muraki is pushed further down the dark abyss of the criminal underworld.\n\nA seductive yakuza noir imbued with nihilism, Masahiro Shinoda’s Pale Flower is gorgeously shot with striking chiaroscuro and punctuated with an ominous theme song by Toru Takemitsu. Regarded by writer Shintaro Ishihara as the best film adaptation of his works, Pale Flower is among the most stylistically accomplished of 1960s Japanese cinema, showcasing Mariko Kaga’s performance as arguably the most memorable femme fatale of the Japanese New Wave.\n\nThis film will be presented in its latest 4K restoration, which premiered at the Berlinale in 2022.\n\nSupported by CHANEL, complimentary tickets are available on a first-come, first-served basis. To redeem the offer, please select the ticket type ‘Complimentary Ticket supported by CHANEL’ when you purchase tickets. Each person can redeem up to two tickets."
