Then Tokheim took over the company, only some clever executive in his ivory tower did not sign up the organ grinder for the long term. Result the organ started developing bugs but with no organ grinder to fix it. So Tokheim get rid of the lemon and all the businesses who used Flow were left high and dry. Not a company who really value their customers.\n\nHuw\n\nDate of experience : July 08, 2017\n\nIf we would treat our customers the way …\n\nIf we would treat our customers the way Tokheim does we wouldn't excist anymore. But Tokheim has this monoploy position, so they can do what they want I guess.\n\nTheir customerservice is very, very bad. In fact you could say there's no service at all: There's no helpdesk, no frequently asked questions page on the website, no occuring problems page in the manuals. Nothing! Then make a phonecall you suggest?\n\nIf they answer a question by phone, they charge automatically €175....\n\nDate of experience : May 03, 2017"
