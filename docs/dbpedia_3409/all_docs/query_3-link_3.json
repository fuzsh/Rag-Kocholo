Results.\n\nFor many years, retailers have sought to have complete real-time visibility of their business, including transactions, stocking levels, pricing, site equipment, consumer behaviour and successful promotions, without much success.\n\nThe technology is now available to provide end-to-end real-time synchronisation of data to help retailers gain total insight into the operations of a single site or across a network. This new family of integrated retail fuel solutions allows merchants to efficiently manage their business and boost revenue by providing personalised, meaningful customer experiences beyond payment.\n\nTSG is here to help\n\nTSG Systems is here to help retailers understand the range of solutions that can help them simplify operations, improve profitability and drive traffic onto the forecourt and into the convenience store.\n\nTSG has over 30 years of experience in the supply and installation of retail solutions for fuel sites across the UK. With its extensive portfolio of products, TSG can satisfy the needs of any size of operation, from a single independently owned business to a national multi-site network.\n\nTokheim OASE\n\nThe Tokheim OASE facilitates PCI-compliant payments at the EPOS and can accommodate all major credit, debit or fuel cards, with a fixed annual fee regardless of transaction volume. This simple but highly secure payment system reduces the complexity of protocol implementation on the site by using a central switchpoint. It supports both indoor and outdoor payment methods, including in-dispenser, payment terminal, cash, self-checkout and in-app mobile. Transactions are authorised quickly and securely which helps to improve customer experience and cultivate loyalty.\n\nOnce subscribed to DX Retail, fuel retailers are able to create specific groups for different sets of fuelling sites, enabling them to make targeted updates at the touch of a button. The system is supported by an advanced backup and restore function, which decreases the risk of data loss and reduces downtime.\n\nDX Retail users also have access to a wide range of reports, such as shift, day, month, year, or accounting day, which eliminates the effort and workload associated with manually collecting individual reports across each site in the network.\n\nFurthermore, fuel retailers can enhance their after-sales service, thanks to DX Retail’s simple receipt retrieval functionality, which allows duplicate receipts to be printed for the customer.\n\nTo play media on this website, you have to allow marketing cookiesPlay video on Youtube"
