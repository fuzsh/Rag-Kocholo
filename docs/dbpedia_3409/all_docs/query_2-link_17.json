        "text": "Building global relationship by Indian technology folks from serving West to post COVID era of Indian UNICORN. Initially mass migration of IIT graduates to Western countries were going on till around 2004/5 and in parallel mass migration of other engineering college graduates started in around 1997 for Y2K then for dot com boom in around 2000 continued. But ultimately all folks from #developing nations were serving #rich nations. So it was a #win win situation for both till around 2004. India – USA strategic alliance in 2003 end create a massive boom of #outsourcing in India. Massive mixing of West and East population started. This #mixing of people resulted in many good and few bad outcomes. Finally extreme outsourcing led to anti-globalization in West. Few of Indian folks who joined software industry after 2004 onwards added more fuel in this anti- globalization in West. Similar like Mahatma Gandhi event in South Africa. Now India is turning from serving west to era of UNICORN, except few India global technology products in past. So in upcoming years we are going to see a new more strong bonding with world with as usual little sour. My contribution: Personally I missed 2000 migration boom to West. But like French Revolution, I too started with French national(closely working with #Tokheim MD of Asia in our office in 2003). Thank you Sir (Raj Agnihotri PhD, PMP) for giving me value and respect in your organization. This learning helped me understanding Europe particularly in leadership. Finally European journey started in 2007 and landed to Amsterdam. We were hungry to build better relationship with Europeans along with work for our long term strong trade. In that journey got connected with people of #Dutch, #Portugal, #Germany and #Greece. All respected me lot and all were very curious for trade relationship with India. Moving on Tech Mahindra assigned me more responsibilities for other countries along with old ones like Germany. Again as usual I continued and had better relationship with few new countries like #Denmark, #Hungary and #Italy. So landed to #Milan in 2010. Thank you Renato Ghezzi for your great support and respect to us and deep respect for Indian Civilization. Understanding Western and Eastern European countries in term of socio economic factors helped me lot in smooth transition of multiple applications. Because ultimate goal was to help each other for years. Now West and East economic gap narrowed, so a new global and social order would be created between India and other countries. Now technology completely changed world and world is like a small village. So wish world leaders to create a better world. We Indians always worked for humanity. Earlier world got benefited from #Yoga and now you could learn #Vipassana #Meditation to make your life more happier. Happy to be a #family member of #world."
