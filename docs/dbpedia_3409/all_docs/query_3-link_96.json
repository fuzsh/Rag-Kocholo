        "text": "Sustainable development is the primary goal of several countries and global organization like the United Nations. Traditional energy contributes to pollution and increases global warming. Alternative energy sources are essential to achieve sustainable energy goals. Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) is one of the most viable alternatives to traditional fuel energy resources for the automotive industry.\n\nCNG is low in pollutants, high in calorific value and heat yield, economical and available in abundance globally. CNG dispensing systems will be widely used. As a result of the rising popularity of CNG and increasing awareness. For transportation of natural gas within a city, a pipeline is laid from the city gate station where natural gas is pushed at a pressure of 15 bars or even lower.\n\nTo gain extensive insights into the market, Request for Customization\n\nTo dispense gas to CNG vehicles, there are CNG stations at various locations, where the gas is compressed up to 250 bars initially and then administered to vehicles at a pressure of 200 bars. CNG dispensing system consists of compressors, dispenser, cascade, pipelines, tubing, etc.\n\nBased on technology, the CNG dispenser system market can be segmented into fast fill and time fill. Fleets use Time-fill stations while retail outlets use fast-fill stations. Based on flow rate, CNG dispenser system market is divided into up to 15 kg/min, up to 50 kg/min and up to 100 kg/min. Based on ownership, CNG dispensing stations are divided into company-owned, and company-operated, company-owned and dealer operated, and dealer-owned and dealer operated.\n\nThe primary market driver for the global CNG dispenser system market is the increase in demand for the alternate and clean source of energy in automobiles. Also, increasing awareness about decreasing the carbon footprints is even driving the market growth of CNG dispenser system market. Key market restraint for the global CNG dispenser system market is the volatile prices of crude oil. Global trade sanctions and tariff barrier can increase the rates of crude oil and make CNG unaffordable to the common public.\n\nKey Players Covered\n\nSome of the notable companies in the global CNG dispenser market are WEH GmbH, Kraus Global Ltd., FTI International Group Inc., Tatsuno Europe a.s., Wayne Fueling Systems, Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Tokheim, Parker, Tulsa Gas Technologies, Nirmal Industrial Controls Pvt Ltd (NICPL), Hitachi Automotive Systems Measurement, Ltd., Compac Industries, Allport, Greka Engineering, Fornovo Gas Srl and Bennett Pump Company.\n\nSEGMENTATION\n\nRegional Analysis\n\nThe global CNG dispenser market has been segmented into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and Middle East & Africa. North America is the market leader in the automobile sector. Increase in use of CNG vehicles in the USA can provide steady growth for CNG dispenser systems. The regulatory push towards an alternate source of energy in China and Europe is expected to boost CNG dispenser systems. The increasing popularity of CNG in developing countries like India, Bangladesh due to higher mileage at a lower cost has raised the sale of CNG dispenser systems. Retrofitting of CNG systems in traditional automobiles is also gaining popularity.\n\nKey Industry Developments"
