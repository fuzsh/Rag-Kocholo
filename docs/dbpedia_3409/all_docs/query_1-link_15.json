        "text": "Tokheim’s piston meter acknowledged for innovation at ceremony at The International Fair Petrol Station 2013 in Warsaw.\n\nTokheim, one of the world’s largest suppliers of fuel retailing solutions, is proud to announce that its innovative TQM meter received an award of distinction in the “Product of the Year” category at the International Fair Petrol Station 2013 in Warsaw, Poland. The annual event, celebrating its twentieth year, took place on 8th-10th May, and attracted a large local and international audience.\n\nThe jury took the following key criteria into consideration: modern technology, innovation, functionality, compliance with regulations, and aesthetics. The TQM received a special award diploma from the competition jury committee. Prizes and awards were presented at an official evening gala. The ceremony was chaired by Mrs Halina Pupacz, the President of Polska Izba Paliw Płynnych (organizer of the Fair), and accompanied by Mrs Iwona Kozłowska, a member of the Polish Parliament.\n\nDavid MacHale, Tokheim Group Marketing Communications Manager, said “This is a fantastic achievement for a component that has been engineered to offer customers significant TCO savings over the lifetime of our Quantium dispensers. The award acknowledges Tokheim’s leadership in technology and innovation in the fuel-retailing sector. Special thanks go to our local Polish sales and service division who accepted the award on behalf of the organisation.”\n\nThe TQM meter has been carefully engineered to retain its precision over its complete lifetime. It has the lowest drift characteristics in the marketplace, having been tested and certified by Europe’s leading independent test body, NMi. The TQM’s robust design ensures it is suitable to work in the harshest conditions with a variety of fuel types, and comes as standard in Tokheim’s Quantium dispensers.\n\nRelated contents"
