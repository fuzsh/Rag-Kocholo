        "text": "Tokheim, in partnership with Fenotec, develops a new innovative tank lining solution available for the retail, commercial and domestic applications.\n\nThe patented process is significantly safer, faster and cheaper when compared with the traditional method of tank replacement or refurbishment.\n\nThe process is unmanned as no operator enters the tank, limiting the health and safety risks. The installation of the tank lining system can be completed in just a few days, reducing the station’s downtime significantly and minimising the impact on the Customer’s business. The solution is also extremely cost-effective versus tank replacement. The tank liner from Tokheim is suitable in various situations where a tank leak has occurred or a tank needs to be replaced, if a new product/ fuel is to be added, or if tank coating is impossible due to high internal corrosion.\n\nHow it works in five easy to follow steps:\n\nIn preparation, Tokheim cleans the tank via an unmanned process.\n\nTank is measured with Tokheim 3D laser calibration tool and the liner is tailor-made to fit the tank.\n\nA protective mattress and liner are placed in the tank.\n\nThe tank liner is inflated to act as a second skin of the tank, determining its size and shape.\n\nThe tank is commissioned, thoroughly tested and inspected via vacuum leak detection and camera systems. The tank is now ready for use again.\n\nBenefits for a customer and their business:\n\nSafety\n\nCost\n\nTiming\n\nUpgradability\n\nFlexibility\n\nThe tank lining solution from Tokheim has been successfully rolled out in many countries across Europe.\n\nIf you are interested in the tank lining solution for your forecourt, contact your nearest Tokheim sales representative.\n\nRelated contents"
