Industry experts will be available to discuss these findings and assist retailers in implementing insights to improve their customers' experiences and increase profit margins.\n\nDFS will spotlight its recently launched DX Market™ powered by GRUBBRR® solution within the DFS Anthem UX™ platform on the Wayne Ovation® fuel dispenser. DX Market™ is a self-ordering solution revolutionizing retail. It empowers retailers to offer customized promotions and upsells using dynamic videos and static content, meeting the demand for automated fueling stations with enhanced self-checkout options.\n\nDFS will display its DX Promote Auto service for the DFS Anthem UX™ platform, an on-dispenser media management service. Designed to offer retailers the necessary time to prioritize the supervision of daily operations, DX Promote Auto oversees the management, creation and presentation of retailer promotional videos, infotainment and national promotions while also increasing in-store spending and enhancing the customer experience at the pump.\n\nDFS will showcase its DFS Anthem UX™ platform, including the DFS AX12 (12\" color touchscreen display) and DFS AX7 (7\" color touchscreen display) models.
