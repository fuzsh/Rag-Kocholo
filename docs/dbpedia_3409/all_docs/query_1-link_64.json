        "text": "Clients Replacing Tokheim fuel dispenser with Bluesky fuel dispenser\n\nWhy are Clients Replacing the Tokheim fuel dispenser with the Bluesky fuel dispenser?\n\nRecently, one client of Bluesky replaced all their gas stations with old Tokheim fuel dispensers with Bluesky fuel dispensers and got good feedback.\n\nIn this article, I will detail clarify why they will accept Bluesky fuel dispensers, and change all fuel dispensers.\n\n1. Compatibility\n\nThis is the most important, Bluesky fuel dispensers are compatible with their existing fueling infrastructure, like the original Red Jacket Submersible Pump, petroleum transmission pipeline, fuel filling island, and any other integrated components. They only remove the old Tokheim fuel dispensers, then install the new Bluesky fuel dispensers, very easy.\n\n2. Regulatory Compliance\n\nBluesky fuel dispensers have explosion-proof and Metrology certifications, like ATEX, MID, and OIML so that they can comply with their local and national regulations and standards.\n\nAnd Bluesky company has the ISO and PEI certification.\n\n3. Integration with the Tokheim POS system\n\nBluesky fuel dispensers can seamlessly integrate with the Tokheim POS system in their gas station, this client has used the Tokheim POS system for many years, even though Bluesky also has POS systems, but the client doesn’t want to change, luckily, Bluesky fuel dispensers also can connect with Tokheim POS system, it’s through Tatsuno protocol. In the previous articles, we have mentioned Bluesky fuel dispensers can communicate with many famous third-party gas station management systems in the market, through different protocols.\n\n4. More function\n\nBluesky fuel dispensers have some optional items, which can be added to the dispenser, like an LED rolling display, and a Multimedia player, which can play some advertising and welcome words and videos, it will be a good promotion way for gas station operation, Tokheim fuel dispensers won’t have these.\n\n5. Cheaper Price\n\nIn the end, of course is a high performance-price ratio, Bluesky fuel dispensers only need 50% price of Tokheim fuel dispensers, but they can have 100% quality and performance.\n\nBesides this, Bluesky fuel dispensers also replaced a lot of other brand fuel dispensers, like Gilbarco, Wayne, etc."
