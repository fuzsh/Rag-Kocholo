        "text": "1. Purpose\n\nThe Tokheim-type flow meter is an accessory product for the oil dispenser. It comprises three pistons and, per cycle can release 0.525 liters. The structure adopts a connecting rod limiter with high measurement accuracy and long service life. It has a compact structure, easy operation, easy maintenance, safety and reliability, and a novel appearance.\n\n2. Product working principle\n\nWhen the pistons are pushed by the pressure oil, the three pistons each complete one oil inlet and oil discharge in sequence,\n\nwhich completes a working cycle. One working cycle passes The fuel volume is a stable value, that is, the displacement.\n\nAt this time, the upper transmission shaft has rotated twice, so the volume of fuel flowing through the meter can be judged based on the number of transmission revolutions.\n\nThe pistons can release 0.525 liters of oil per cycle. Through gear shifting, the actual output shaft displacement is 0.21 liters per revolution.\n\n3. Structure and technical parameters\n\n1Structure: Tokheim type flow meter consists of flow meter body, upper cover, swing-gear frame assembly, connecting rod, piston, distribution plate, valve seat, regulating device, etc. The materials selected for the design meet standards. For example: the distribution plate and valve seat are made of ductile iron, the connecting rod is made of 45# carbon steel, the cup is made of FD-3 modified PTFE, the seal is made of nitrile rubber, etc.\n\n2Technical parameters:\n\nDisplacement per revolution: 0.21/0.2L (after gear change rate)\n\nDisplacement per revolution: 0.525/0.5L(without changing speed)\n\n4. Main overall dimensions and connection dimensions\n\n5. Testing and adjustment\n\nThe Tokheim-type flow meter undergoes thorough inspection and testing before shipment, ensuring that all parameters comply with the specified standards. If users need to make adjustments during operation or if the metering accuracy of the fuel dispenser deviates from the specified tolerance, fine-tuning can be performed by adjusting the flow meterâ€™s adjustment device.\n\nTo precisely adjust the flow meter, follow these steps:\n\na) As illustrated in Figure 1, break the lead seal located on the upper part of the flow meter handle. Extract the lead seal wire and pin, then carefully rotate the handle either clockwise or counterclockwise. Clockwise rotation will result in a reduced release of oil, whereas counterclockwise rotation will increase the oil discharge.\n\nb) The flow meter is equipped with 14 adjustment holes, and the adjustment handle facilitates the incremental adjustment of hole spacing. Each adjustment corresponds to an approximate 0.05% modification in spacing. Upon completing the adjustment, carefully reinsert the pin and seal the meter.\n\nNote: Before the fuel dispenser leaves the factory, the manufacturer performs measurement verification and installs lead seals on the flow meter adjustment device and counter. After leaving the factory, the measurement management department must adjust the measurement accuracy and the lead seals must be reinstalled.\n\n6. Usual faults and solutions"
