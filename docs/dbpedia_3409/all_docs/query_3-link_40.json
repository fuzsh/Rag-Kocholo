        "text": "Tokheim, one of the world’s largest suppliers of fuel retailing solutions, is proud to announce that its point of sale, Fuel POS™, comes with a brand new graphical user interface in its latest release. The new look is a shift away from Fuel POS’s traditional blue screen to a more modern, sleek design. However, Fuel POS still follows the same intuitive layout of its predecessors to ensure existing users require no new training.\n\nPeter Van Nauw, System Product Marketing Director, says, “The new user interface is the result of more than a year of research with customers and design agencies. Customers liked the ease of use of Fuel POS, but it was felt that we could improve its overall look and feel. The new design ensures a better experience for staff through reduced eye fatigue, clearly marked icons and improved search options. The frequently used flows have also received an overhaul; helping improve the interaction process between the operative and the screen - for faster, more intuitive touch screen selections. All of this has a positive impact on service, as customers have less time to wait, and staff have more time to engage with customers rather than with the till itself.”\n\nTokheim Fuel POS is one of the world’s leading electronic point of sale systems (EPOS) designed specifically for the fuel retailing environment. With customers in 56 countries spread across Europe, Asia, Middle East, Africa and South America it is an international platform adapted to the specific needs of each of the local markets in which it operates - the software is available in 32 different languages. The new user interface is released in version 30 of Fuel POS and will be rolled out across all Fuel POS updates in the future.\n\nRelated contents"
