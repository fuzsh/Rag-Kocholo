        "text": "About TSG\n\nGroup TSG Group provides a wide array of solutions combining equipment sales, services and projects to the energy distribution networks aimed at fueling mobility across Europe and Africa. Headquartered in Paris, TSG Group operates in 30 countries through its six business segments. With 3,500 employees worldwide, TSG Group services over 40,000 gas stations that together process over 500 million transactions annually for fuel and shop sales. For more information, visit TSG-Solutions.com.\n\nThe Challenge\n\nTSG Group is a worldwide mobility service provider, operating in 30 countries across all types of energy—from traditional fuels, natural gas, to electricity and hydrogen. TSG Group CFO, Long Nguyen, joined in 2004, when the group was known as Tokheim, one year after it was set up as a private equity funded company with its headquarters based in France.\n\nThe first task of Nguyen was to implement the Group consolidations, management reporting and analytics system, combining SAP Business Objects Financials Consolidation (BOFC) with Hyperion Essbase.\n\nOver the years as the group continued to grow, collecting data from multiple GL/ERP systems for statutory and management reporting became increasingly difficult as Nguyen and his team were managing several finance systems. Feeding their Essbase management reporting cubes from SAP BOFC caused data latency—with delays over two hours—making it hard to keep data synchronized.\n\nAnd whenever there was an issue with the system, TSG had to work through a third party for external service to support the application. This only added to their increasing lag times. TSG Group needed a single CPM environment for both external and management reporting, and single provider to support the system.\n\nThe OneStream XF Solution\n\nMany components of TSG's existing CPM system were reaching the end of their life cycles—and there was no future roadmap in sight. And with no plan to standardize on SAP for their ERP strategy, Nguyen had no interest in upgrading to SAP Group Reporting on S/4 HANA.\n\nIt wasn't until Nguyen was introduced to OneStream Software that his vision of an attractive new CPM solution was brought to life. The modern OneStream XF platform met his need for a unified environment for consolidation, statutory reporting, management reporting and analysis. The company selected OneStream for its extensible approach—bringing their finance applications together onto a single platform—and for its proven record of customer success.\n\nWorking with OneStream Partner, Inplenion, TSG set up a full-managed service with the XF platform. The system was configured to his needs, yet had the agility to easily scale as needs changed. And throughout the implementation process, Nguyen had full confidence in both the OneStream and Inplenion teams.\n\nOneStream Delivers a Unified CPM Solution\n\nWorking with Inplenion, TSG migrated all financial consolidation, statutory reporting and management reporting to the OneStream platform in the first phase of the project. TSG Group is now live, and Nguyen is happy that the transition was a success. \"The Extensible Dimensionality® of OneStream allows us to support corporate standards while also providing relevance to operating units,\" said Nguyen. \"Another advantage of OneStream is that the financial controllers at each subsidiary can model their budget at the level of detail required for their subsidiary.\"\n\nThanks to OneStream Software, TSG Group is now streamlining its finance operations. By replacing multiple legacy finance systems with a single, unified OneStream XF platform, the company is already seeing time-saving advantages\n\nThe Future\n\nTSG Group is thrilled to have digitally transformed their finance operations with OneStream Software. The company is considering rolling out budgeting and planning, with flexible modeling capabilities aimed at giving each line of business more control of their budgeting process.\n\nSimilar to their management reporting process, TSG looks to streamline budgeting where modeling of the budget is performed by each subsidiary—collected the same way as actuals—and effortlessly consolidated into OneStream.\n\nAbout the Implementation Partner\n\nInplenion is an international management consulting company engaged in projects worldwide. Present in different locations, Inplenion is established in Switzerland (Headquarters), Germany, Sweden, Austria, Greece, Egypt, UAE, KSA, South Africa, India, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
