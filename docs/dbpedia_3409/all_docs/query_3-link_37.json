        "text": "Scott Snowden\n\nscott@snowdenvineyards.com\n\nScott Snowden was five years old when the family first came to the Napa Valley. During high school, college, and graduate school, Scott worked summers at Hanns Kornell Cellars, Inglenook Winery, and Beaulieu Vineyard. He attended Washington and Lee University and the Boalt Hall School of Law at the University of California at Berkeley. He practiced law in Napa before his appointment to the bench in 1980. Scott retired as Presiding Judge of the Napa Superior Court 2005. He is now a mediator-arbitrator with the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service, better known as “JAMS - The Resolution Experts.” Half cowboy and half lawman, Scott regularly quotes Bob Dylan. A fanatic fly fisherman, he is the creator of the Snowdun, a fly pattern sold in sportshops in several western states. He has also appeared as a visiting judge in Craig Johnson's fascinating \"Longmire\" mysteries. Scott is a managing director for Snowden Vineyards.\n\nRandy Snowden\n\nrandy@snowdenvineyards.com\n\nRandy Snowden was two when the family arrived in the Napa Valley. He worked summer jobs in wineries during his school years, including cellar positions at Heitz Wine Cellars (which neighbors the Snowden ranch on the west) and Robert Mondavi Winery; and in the tasting room at Beaulieu Vineyard. Randy earned his undergraduate and law degrees at the University of California at Davis. He practiced law in Richmond, Virginia, and Napa, California, and then went on to be the founding director of two rehabilitation programs for drug addicted teenagers -- Thunder Road in Oakland, and The Wolfe Center in Napa. Randy was the Director of the Napa County Health and Human Services Agency from 2005 until retiring into the family wine business in late 2013. Playing rock bass in his spare time, Randy is a managing director for Snowden Vineyards."
