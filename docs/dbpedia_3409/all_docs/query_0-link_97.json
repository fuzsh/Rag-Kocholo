        "text": "PMJDY has changed the way banks & financial institutions operate\n\nPMJDY's journey over the past decade has been nothing short of transformative. It has fundamentally changed the way banks and financial institutions operate, pushing them to reach the remotest corners of the country and serve the \"Antyoday\" - the poorest of the poor. Today, more than 53 crore Jan Dhan accounts have been opened, with a cumulative deposit balance exceeding ₹2.3 lakh crore. This is a testament to the scheme's success in nurturing a savings culture among previously unbanked individuals. Additionally, Jan Dhan account holders have been provided around 36 crore RuPay debit cards.\n\nUN aviation watchdog auditing India’s security readiness\n\nThe International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has commenced a nine-day audit of India's aviation security, focusing on the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) at Delhi and Kolkata airports. This audit, involving a dozen experts from 10 countries, will assess India’s compliance with global security standards, including regulatory frameworks and operational procedures. The ICAO's last audit in 2018 raised concerns about BCAS's autonomy, a point India has since addressed with recent legislative changes.\n\nSamsung aims to lead premium washing machine segment, launches AI-powered lineup\n\nSamsung India launched a new range of AI-powered washing machines, aiming to dominate the premium segment. The company targets market leadership by gaining quarterly share and capitalizing on the trend of premiumization and festive season. With a focus on front-load models, Samsung anticipates consumer demand for larger capacity machines. The AI-powered lineup promises energy efficiency and reduced wash time, positioning Samsung as a market leader in the premium segment.\n\nPioneer plans to scale up biz with automakers in India for future growth\n\nPioneer, the Japanese car audio and entertainment system maker, plans to expand its presence in the Indian automotive market by focusing on partnerships with local automakers. Historically, Pioneer India has concentrated on the aftermarket sector, but the company now aims to enter the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) space.\n\nGovernment mulls stricter penalties for misuse of national emblems, names\n\nThe Union government is considering significant amendments to the Names and Emblem (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950, to strengthen the law and deter violations. Proposed changes include substantial increases in fines and the introduction of imprisonment for offenders, aiming to raise penalties to Rs 1 lakh for first-time violators and up to Rs 5 lakh for repeat offenders, with a six-month jail term."
