        "text": "The Oslusa area, located within the National Park Tara, is a very specific space, characterized as a “wavy plateau”, due to its numerous valleys, with a huge capacity for the development of tourist potential, especially among those who love nature and mountain tourism.\n\nIt is this fact that incited the Municipal Administration of Bajina Basta to adopt the General Regulation Plan for this area to the end of a rational development of space and defining development capacities, so that a new tourist center, dedicated to those who love nature, would develop in this location.\n\nAccording to the plan, the entire area is covered by the Spatial Plan of the special purpose area of the National Park Tara and encompasses parts of the cadaster municipality Perucac and Beserovina, with an area of 315.6 hectares. The space is under the regime of the 2nd degree of the protection of natural goods, which pertains to areas with partially changed eco-systems of great scientific and practical significance. Therefore, it is forbidden to change forest areas, build industrial complexes, main roads, traffic infrastructure and similar structures in this area, but despite such limitations, there is still room for the development of the tourist potential.\n\nTourist zones\n\nThe development of five tourist zones is planned on the Tara mountain: Predov Krst, Bajina Basta, Perucac, Kaludjerska Bara and Mitrovac.\n\nThe Kaludjerska Bara zone is already partly commercialized, based on the spatial plan for the National Park Tara, but, according to the planning documentation, there is still no sustainable tourist potential, so the plan is for the zone to be made more attractive through the development of new features.\n\nNew features\n\nThe spatial plan for the Oslusa area envisages the reconstruction of hotels Omorika, Tara and Beli Bor. Furthermore, next to Hotel Beli Bor, the plan is to build a sports center with 4,000 m2. In Oslusa, the plan is to build a small mountain hotel, mountain village, a cross-country skiing track, a health track of 2 kilometers with several locations for recreational activities, and systems for pedestrian-cycling lanes.\n\nIn addition to the features meant for health tourism, the plan is also to develop sports activities, which could attract more guests. The plan is to build a golf course on around 60 hectares and to form a horse-riding school with 10 to 15 horses.\n\nThe development of tourist potentials also includes cultural features, so there is a plan to form a calligraphy school in Raca/Ladjevci.\n\nThe development of “touring”, a system of round and linear tourist trips, or tours through national parks, gorges and monasteries, will make the tourist offer special.\n\nTransport infrastructure\n\nThe mountain area intersects with the II B-grade state road 403 (Kaludjerska Bara-Mitrovac-Zaovine-BiH state border) on the south side. A delimitation width of 15.5 meters is planned for that road, as well as the formation of a protective area of 10 meters from each side of the road.\n\nThe plan is also to expand the existing municipal road with a minimal delimitation width of 10.5 meters, and it also entails the delimitation of the two-way road which connects Mitrovac and Sokolina.\n\nThe special characteristic of this area is that the route of the E7 European Pedestrian Corridor passes through the mountain area. It will be used for new traffic routes to develop around it, such as the construction of a two-way cycling lane.\n\nThe General Regulation Plan of the Oslusa area was prepared by Andzor Engineering d.o.o. from Novi Sad, which will be up for public review until September 10.\n\nN.
