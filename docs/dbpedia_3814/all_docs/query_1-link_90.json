        "text": "Ordinances are the laws of the City. City Councils are given the power to pass ordinances through state law, as long as those ordinances are not in conflict with the Constitution and the laws of the State of California or the United States. An ordinance is the most binding form of action taken by the City Council; the violation is a misdemeanor unless by ordinance it is made an infraction. With minor exceptions, ordinances are codified into the Municipal Code (muni code) where they become acts of law within the City’s jurisdictional boundaries.\n\nResolutions, while not generally carrying the full force or weight of law, constitute written action or decision of the City. Resolutions may be adopted by the City Council, the Planning Commission, or the Community Services Commission.\n\nCopies of ordinances may be requested from the City Clerk’s Office during normal business hours.\n\nLocal Legislation: New Laws and Regulations\n\nThe City Council is vested with the authority to adopt laws, also referred to as ordinances. Ordinances are then codified into the City's Municipal Code.\n\nView the Lake Forest Municipal Code for a complete listing of City laws and regulations.\n\nCopies of ordinances may be requested from the City Clerk's Office during normal business hours.\n\nContact Us"
