        "text": "Data protection\n\n1. Data protection at a glance\n\nGeneral information\n\nThe following information provides you with a clear overview of what happens to your personal data when you visit our website. Personal data is all data that can be used to identify you personally. You can find detailed information on the topic of data protection in our data protection declaration, which you will find beneath this text.\n\nThe acquisition of data on our website\n\nWho is responsible for the acquisition of data on this website?\n\nData processing on this website is carried out by the website operator. You can find the contact details of the website operator in the website legal note.\n\nHow do we acquire your data?\n\nYour data is acquired when you provide us with it. This could be data that you enter in a contact form for example.\n\nOther data is automatically acquired by our IT systems when you visit the website. This principally concerns technical data (e.g. web browser, operating system or time of web page access). The acquisition of this data takes place automatically, as soon as you enter our website.\n\nFor what purpose do we use your data?\n\nPart of your data is acquired in order to ensure faultless presentation of the website. Other data may be used to analyse your user behaviour.\n\nWhat rights do you have in relation to your data?\n\nYou have the right at any time to request information free of charge concerning the origin, recipients and purpose of your stored personal data. You also have the right to demand that this data be corrected, blocked or deleted. You can contact us at any time in this regard, and with any other questions on the topic of data protection, at the address provided in the legal note. Furthermore, you have the right to appeal to the regulatory authority responsible.\n\nAnalysis tools and tools from third party providers\n\nWhen you visit our website, your browsing behaviour can be statistically evaluated. This takes place in particular through the use of cookies and so-called analysis programs. The analysis of your browsing behaviour generally takes place anonymously; the browsing behaviour cannot be traced back to you personally. You can object to this analysis, or you can prevent it by avoiding the use of certain tools. You can find more detailed information on this in the following data protection declaration.\n\nYou can appeal this analysis. We shall inform you of the objection procedures in this data protection declaration.\n\n2. General information and mandatory information\n\nData protection\n\nThe operator of these web pages takes the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data in confidence and in compliance with the legal data protection regulations as well as this data protection declaration.\n\nVarious personal data is acquired when you use this website. Personal data is data that can be used to identify you personally. This data protection declaration explains what data we acquire and how we use it. It also explains how and for what purpose this takes place.\n\nPlease note that the transmission of data via the internet (e.g. by way of email communication) may be at risk of security breaches. It is impossible to completely protect data against access by third parties.\n\nInformation on the responsible body\n\nThe body responsible for data processing on this website is:\n\nSecuriton d.o.o.\n\nDanila Lekića Španca 31, Belgrade, Serbia\n\nTel.: +381 11 318 50 17\n\nEmail: info@securiton.rs\n\nThe responsible body is the natural or legal entity that decides, autonomously or with others, on the purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g. names, email addresses, etc.).\n\nRevoking your consent to data processing\n\nMany data processing procedures are only possible with your express consent. After providing your consent, you can withdraw this at any time. Notifying us informally by email is sufficient for this. The legality of any data processing that took place prior to consent being revoked remains unaffected.\n\nThe right to data portability\n\nYou have the right to demand that we furnish you or a third party with data that we process by automated means on the basis of your consent or in order to fulfil a contract, in conventional, machine-readable format. If you demand direct transmission of the data to another responsible party, this shall only take place insofar as this is technically feasible.\n\nSSL or TLS encryption\n\nThis site uses SSL or TLS encryption for reasons of security and to protect the transmission of confidential contents, for example orders or inquiries sent by you to us as the site operator. You can identify an encrypted connection because the address line in the browser changes from \"http://\" to \"https://\" and the padlock symbol is displayed in your browser line.\n\nIf SSL or TLS encryption is active, the data that you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.\n\nInformation, blocking access, deletion\n\nWithin the framework of the valid legal provisions, you have the right to demand information on your saved personal data at any time along with its origin and recipients and the purpose of the data processing, free of charge. You are also entitled to demand that the data be corrected if necessary, blocked or deleted. You can contact us at any time in this regard, and with any other questions on the topic of personal data, at the address provided in the legal note.\n\n3. The acquisition of data on our website\n\nCookies\n\nSome of the web pages use so-called cookies. Cookies do no damage to your computer and do not contain viruses. Cookies serve to make our website more user-friendly, effective and secure. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and by your internet browser.\n\nMost of the cookies that we use are so-called \"session cookies\". These are automatically deleted after your visit. Other cookies remain saved on your end device until you delete them. These cookies enable us to recognise your browser again when you visit next.\n\nYou can set your browser such that you are informed when cookies are set, cookies are only permitted in individual cases, cookies are only accepted for certain cases or generally excluded, and you can also set the browser to automatically delete the cookies when the browser is closed. The deactivation of cookies can limit the functionality of this website.\n\nCookies that are required for the electronic communication process or for the provision of certain functions desired by you (e.g. shopping basket function) are stored on the basis of article 6, section 1, letter of GDPR. The website operator has a justified interest in the storage of cookies for the technically faultless and optimised provision of their services. Insofar as other cookies (e.g. cookies for the analysis of your browsing behaviour) are stored, these are dealt with separately in this data protection declaration.\n\nServer log files\n\nThe provider of the web pages automatically collects and saves information that your browser automatically sends to us in server log files. This information is:\n\nBrowser type and browser version\n\nOperating system used\n\nReferrer URL\n\nHost name of accessing computer\n\nTime of server request\n\nIP address\n\nThis data is not associated with data from other data sources.\n\nThe basis for the data processing is article 6, section 1, letter of GDPR, which permits the processing of data in order to fulfil a contract or pre-contractual measures.\n\nContact form\n\nIf you wish to contact us with questions via the contact form, your information from the contact form - including the contact details that you provide there - will be saved by us for the purpose of dealing with your inquiry and for any subsequent queries. We will not pass on this data without your consent.\n\nThe processing of data entered in the contact form therefore takes place exclusively on the basis of your consent (article 6, section 1, letter a GDPR). You can withdraw this consent at any time. Notifying us informally by email is sufficient for this. The legality of any data processing procedures that took place prior to consent being revoked remains unaffected.\n\nThe data entered in the contact form by you is kept by us until you demand that it be deleted, or you withdraw your consent to its storage, or the purpose of the data storage no longer applies (e.g. once your inquiry has been fully processed). Mandatory legal regulations - in particular storage periods - remain unaffected.\n\n4. Analysis tools and advertisement\n\nGoogle Analytics\n\nThis website uses functions of the Google Analytics web analysis service. The provider is Google Inc. 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.\n\nGoogle Analytics uses so-called \"cookies\". These are text files that are saved on your computer and that facilitate the analysis of the use of the website by you. The information generated by the cookie regarding your use of this website is generally transferred to a Google server in the USA and saved there.\n\nThe storage of Google Analytics cookies takes place on the basis of article 6, section 1, letter of GDPR. The website operator has a justified interest in the analysis of the user’s behaviour, in order to optimise their web presence and their advertising.\n\nIP anonymisation\n\nWe have activated the IP anonymising function on this website. As a result of this, your IP address will be shortened by Google within the member states of the European Union or in other countries which are contracting parties to the agreement on the European Economic Area, before being transmitted to the USA. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transferred to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google uses this information to evaluate your use of the website, create reports on website activities, and render further services relating to website use and internet use for the operator of this website. The IP address that is transmitted by your browser for the purpose of Google Analytics is not associated with other data by Google.\n\nBrowser plugin\n\nYou can prevent the storage of cookies using your browser software settings; however, please note that in this case you will not be able to fully utilise all of the functions of this website. Furthermore, you can prevent the acquisition of the data created by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) by Google, as well as the processing of this data by Google, by downloading and installing the browser plugin available via the following link: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de.\n\nObjection to data acquisition\n\nYou can prevent the collection of your data by Google Analytics by clicking on the following link. An Opt-Out cookie will be set preventing the collection of your data during future visits to this website: Deactivate Google Analytics.\n\nFor more information on the handling of user data at Google Analytics, please refer to the data protection declaration of Google: https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=de.\n\nOrder data processing\n\nWe have concluded a contract with Google for order data processing and fully apply the strict regulations of the German data protection authorities with the use of Google Analytics.\n\nDemographic features with Google Analytics\n\nThis website uses the \"Demographic features\" function of Google Analytics. This enables reports to be compiled containing statements regarding the age, gender and interests of the site visitors. This data comes from interest-based advertising from Google as well as from visit data from third party providers. This data cannot be assigned to specific persons. You can deactivate this function at any time via the display settings in your Google account or you can generally prohibit the collection of your data by Google Analytics as shown in the point “Objection to data acquisition”.\n\nGoogle Analytics Remarketing\n\nOur websites use the functions of Google Analytics Remarketing in conjunction with the cross-device functions of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick. The provider is Google Inc. 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.\n\nThis function enables the advertising target groups created with Google Analytics Remarketing to be linked with the cross-device functions of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick. In this way, interest-related, personalised advertising messages, which have been adapted to you based on your previous use and surfing behaviour on an end-device (e.g. mobile phone) can also be displayed on another of your end-devices (e.g. tablet or PC).\n\nIf you have given corresponding consent, Google links your web and app browser history to your Google account for this purpose. In this way the same personalised web advertising messages can be provided on each end-device that you use to log in to your Google account.\n\nTo support this function, Google Analytics collects the Google-authenticated ID of the user, which is temporarily linked with our Google Analytics data, in order to define and create target groups for the cross-device advertising.\n\nYou can permanently deactivate the cross-device Remarketing/Targeting by deactivating the personalised advertising in your Google account - to do so, follow this link: https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/.\n\nThe collation of the data recorded in your Google account is carried out exclusively on the basis of your consent, which you can provide or withdraw with respect to Google (article 6, section 1, letter a GDPR). In the case of data collection processes that are not collated in your Google account (e.g. because you do not have a Google account or because you have forbidden the collation), the collection of the data is based on article 6, section 1, letter of GDPR. The justified interest lies in the fact that the website operator has an interest in the anonymised analysis of the website visitors for advertising purposes.\n\nFor more information and the data protection provisions, please refer to the data protection declaration of Google at: https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/.\n\nGoogleAdWords and Google Conversion-Tracking\n\nThis website uses Google AdWords. AdWords is an online advertising program from Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States (“Google”).\n\nWe use so-called Conversion-Tracking within the scope of Google AdWords. If you click on an advert delivered by Google, a cookie will be set for Conversion-Tracking. Cookies are small text files that the internet browser saves on the user's computer. These cookies become invalid after 30 days and do not serve to enable personal identification of the user. If the user visits certain pages on this website and the cookie has not yet expired, we and Google are able to determine that the user has clicked on the advert and was forwarded on to this page.\n\nEach Google AdWords customer receives a different cookie. Cookies cannot be tracked via the websites of AdWords customers. The information gathered with the help of the conversion cookie facilitates the generation of conversion statistics for AdWords customers who have decided to use conversion tracking. Customers discover the total number of users who clicked on their advert and were forwarded on to a page containing a conversion tracking tag. However, they do not obtain any information that enables them to personally identify the user. If you do not wish to participate in tracking, you can easily prohibit this use by deactivating the Google Conversion-Tracking cookie via the user settings in your internet browser. Then you will no longer be recorded in the Conversion-Tracking statistics.\n\nThe storage of “Conversion-Cookies” takes place on the basis of article 6, section 1, letter of GDPR. The website operator has a justified interest in the analysis of the user’s behaviour, in order to optimise their web presence and their advertising.\n\nFor more information on Google AdWords and Google Conversion-Tracking, please refer to the data protection policy of Google: https://www.google.de/policies/privacy/.\n\nYou can set your browser such that you are informed when cookies are set, cookies are only permitted in individual cases, cookies are only accepted for certain cases or generally excluded, and you can also set the browser to automatically delete the cookies when the browser is closed. The deactivation of cookies can limit the functionality of this website.\n\nGoogle reCAPTCHA\n\nWe use “Google reCAPTCHA” (hereafter “reCAPTCHA”) on our websites. The provider is Google Inc. 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (\"Google\").\n\nreCAPTCHA checks whether the data input on our websites (e.g. in a contact form) has been implemented by a person or by an automated program. To do so, reCAPTCHA analyses the behaviour of the website visitor using various features. This analysis starts automatically as soon as the website visitor enters the website. reCAPTCHA assesses different information (e.g. IP address, time spent on the website or mouse movements carried out by the user) for this analysis. Data recorded during the analysis is passed on to Google.\n\nThe reCAPTCHA analyses are carried out completely in the background. The website visitor will not be informed that an analysis is being carried out.\n\nThe data processing takes place on the basis of article 6, section 1, letter of GDPR. The website operator has a justified interest in protecting their website from misuse through automated spying and from SPAM.\n\nFor further information on Google reCAPTCHA as well as the data protection declaration from Google, please use the following links: https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/ and https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/android.html.\n\n5. Plugins and tools\n\nGoogle Web Fonts\n\nThis website uses so-called web fonts provided by Google in order to display a uniform appearance of text. When this site is called up, your browser loads the required Web Fonts into your browser cache in order to display text and fonts correctly.\n\nFor this purpose, the browser you are using must establish a link to the Google servers. In doing so, Google is informed that our website has been called up via your IP address. Google Web Fonts are used in the interests of providing a uniform and appealing display of our online presence. This constitutes a justified interest according to article 6, section 1, letter of GDPR.\n\nIf your browser does not support Web Fonts, your computer will use a standard font.\n\nYou can find further information on Google Web Fonts at https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq and in the data protection declaration of Google: https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/.\n\nGoogle Maps\n\nThis website uses the map service of Google Maps via an API. The provider is Google Inc. 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.\n\nIn order to use the functions of Google Maps, it is necessary to store your IP address. This information is generally passed to a Google server in the USA and saved there. The operator of this website has no influence on this data transmission.\n\nWe use Google Maps in the interest of ensuring our online presence is appealing and to enable website users to easily locate places named on our website. This constitutes a justified interest according to article 6, section 1, letter of GDPR.\n\nFor more information on the handling of user data, please refer to the data protection declaration of Google at: https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/."
