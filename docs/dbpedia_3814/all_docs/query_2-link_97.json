        "text": "For almost two centuries, monasteries of Ovcar-kablar gorge attracted attention of many researchers, artists, believers, and in recent times they became pull factors for modern tourists. These monasteries along with natural beauty of Ovcar-Kablar gorge and healing properties of Ovcar-Kablar Spa, make an extremely important area and tourist potential. Although Ovcar-Kablar monasteries by overall artistic achievements are behind Serbian medieval work of art, not many people can remain indifferent for their beauty and spirituality. The appearance of these temples (ten monasteries and two holy places) can be determined only approximately, which leaves a lot of space for numerous assumptions. In opinion of historians Ovcar-Kablar monasteries were built in the late XIV century, during the arrival of The Sinaite monks in Serbia. Monasteries of Ovcar-kablar gorge suffered numerous wars and destruction, but they still represent a place which keeps the true value of Orthodoxy. As religious and cultural-historical objects of great importance these monasteries attracts more and more visitors every year, leading to needs for tourism valorization, since the basic religious functions of monasteries should not be disturbed. Also, care should be taken about tourism impact on active life of the monastery and the environment. According to destination needs in this paper work author will present tourist valorization of these monasteries applying Quantitative and Qualitative research method and Hilary du Cros method. As a final conclusion will be presented comparative analyze of both results."
