        "text": "IN THE TERRITORY OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA\n\nFROM 24 MARCH TO 08 JUNE 1999\n\nDuring the seventy-seven days of the NATO aggression, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has been exposed to extensive civilian destruction, unprecedented in modern history of the world. The NATO systematically attacked and destroyed civilian targets in the entire territory of the FR of Yugoslavia, directly threatening the lives and fundamental human rights of the entire Yugoslav population.\n\nFrom the onset of the NATO aggression against FR Yugoslavia from March 24 until June 8, 1999, the North Atlantic Alliance carried out more than 35 000 assaults against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In air strikes were used: over 1 000 warplanes (among others F-15, F-16, F-117) and 206 helicopters. More than 10 000 cruise missiles were launched and over 79 000 tons of explosives were dropped, including at least 152 containers with 35 450 cluster bombs, thermo-visual and graphite bombs which are prohibited under international conventions. The greatest number of air-strikes were carried out in the wider area of Pristina (374), Prizren (232), Beograd (212), Urosevac (205), Djakovica (190), Kraljevo and Uzice (145 per town), Novi Sad (114), and so on.\n\nDue to total destruction of industrial facilities throughout the country, more than 600 000 workers have become jobless. As a result almost 2.5 million citizens have no means to sustain minimal living conditions and are unable to ensure their existence.\n\nOverall material damage is enormous. Preliminary estimates indicate that barbaric air strikes of the NATO alliance, since the beginning of the unprovoked aggression, against industrial, commercial and civil facilities and infrastructure throughout the territory of the FR of Yugoslavia, have incurred damages in excess of 100 billion dollars.\n\nJump quck to view reports about damaged or destroyed cites:\n\nCivilian casualties Bridges Railways and stations Roads and transporters Airports Industrial objects Rafineries and warehouses Agricultural objects Hospitals Schools Public and housing facilities Infrastructure TV transmitters Monasteries Monuments and museums Diplomatic missions\n\nCIVILIAN CASUALTIES\n\nSeveral thousand civilianswere killed and more than 6 000 sustained serious injuries, while a large number of them will remain crippled for life.\n\nChildren make up 30% of all casualties as well as 40% of the total number of the injured, while 10% of all Yugoslav children (approximately 300 000) have suffered severe psychological traumas and will require continuous medical surveillance, care and treatment. For the most part, children have been victims of the sprinkle cluster bombs, with delayed effect, and will continue to be until all parks, play-fields and open areas have been made safe from the remaining, unexploded, cluster bombs indiscriminately scattered throughout the country.\n\nWhat follows are the most tragic instances of civilian casualties and suffering as a result of the unprovoked aggression of the NATO alliance on the FR of Yugoslavia:\n\nSurdulica:\n\nattack on a peaceful rural town 20 civilians were killed, including 12 children, and over 100 wounded of which 24 critically (27.4.1999);\n\n20 civilians were killed and 88 injured in the attack on a Retirement Home and a Sanatorium (31.5.1999);\n\nKorisa: at least 87 civilians were killed and over 70 injured in the attack on a convoy of Albanian refugees returning to their homes (14.5.1999.);\n\nDjjakovica: Djakovica-Prizren road: in the attack on two refugee columns, with four cruise missiles, 75 killed and 100 wounded, of whom 26 critically (14.4.1999);\n\nin an attack on a refugee settlement housing Serb refugees from the Republika Srpska Krajina (Croatia), 10 refugees were killed and 16 wounded (21.4.1999);\n\nGrdelicka gorge: in the attack on a international passenger train 55 passengers were killed, including on child, and 16 wounded (12.4.1999);\n\nvillage Luzani: at least 60 passengers were killed and 13 injured in an attack on the road bridge during which a passenger bus \"Nis Expres\" on the Pristina-Podujevo route was hit;
