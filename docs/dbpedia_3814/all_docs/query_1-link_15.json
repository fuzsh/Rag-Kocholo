        "text": "Political life in Serbia in 2023 was impacted by several major shocks, from two mass shootings on May 3 and 4 to various events concerning Kosovo, including violence in May and September and agreements reached in Brussels and in the Macedonian city of Ohrid in February and March, respectively. The two shootings led to the largest protests of the century in Serbia, while the events in Kosovo brought pressure on the Serbian government from both the international community and the domestic public. The turmoil culminated in snap parliamentary and local elections held on December 17.\n\nThe Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) won the most votes in the parliamentary election, taking back some of the ground it had lost to its former coalition partner, the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS). Second placed was the wide pro–European Union (EU) coalition Serbia against Violence (SPN), which won almost a quarter of the vote, far surpassing any result of an opposition list since President Aleksandar Vučić of the SNS took power in 2012 A right-wing coalition and a new extreme right movement led by a charismatic pro-Russian conspiracy theorist also managed to enter the National Assembly.\n\nAccording to the official election results, the SNS also managed to win the most votes in the capital city of Belgrade in local elections held that day, besting the SPN coalition by around four percent of the total vote. However, the SNS was not able to form a new city government together with the councilors belonging to the new populist movement, which itself broke apart, triggering new elections in Belgrade. The SNS also won in most other municipalities.\n\nHowever, all these results were brought into question by the opposition, civil society organizations and the European Parliament, as the elections were marred by numerous irregularities and drew harsh criticism from both domestic and international observers. Especially problematic was Belgrade, where the opposition believed it was robbed of a victory, a sentiment publicly shared by some international election observers. Due to this, crowds started gathering in front of the Republic Electoral Commission (RIK) the next day, and the opposition demanded new elections and started a hunger strike.\n\nThe most controversial aspect of the elections were the allegations of that people had been transported to Belgrade from other Serbian cities, as well as from the Republic of Srpska in Bosnia and Herzegovina, so they could vote in local elections in the Serbian capital. Some of them were assembled to central locations in Belgrade and then taken to various polling places throughout the city. Some public officials from the Republic of Srpska even publicly voted in local and provincial elections. Other than those allegations, the elections were marred by the usual irregularities on election day, but also by significant scandals during the preceding campaign, including the mass forging of signatures for the nomination of electoral lists and organized vote-buying schemes. The prosecution remained silent regarding those campaign-trail allegations, and the president publicly defended the vote-buying operation.\n\nTwo mass shootings in May were undoubtedly the dominant events of the year. On May 3, a 13-year-old student killed nine children and a security guard in the Vladislav Ribnikar elementary school in Belgrade. Only one day later, a 21-year-old perpetrator went on a prolonged shooting spree in the villages around the Belgrade suburb of Mladenovac, killing nine people. The shootings shocked the public, and the actions of the government in their aftermath quickly led to historic mass protests that were dubbed “Serbia against Violence,” held in Belgrade and around 40 more cities and municipalities for many months. Some of the gatherings were the largest political rallies that Serbia had seen in the 21st century.\n\nThe protests were mostly organized by pro-EU opposition parties and among their demands were a ban on violent reality TV shows, the revocation of national broadcasting licenses for two propagandistic progovernment TV stations, the resignation of the Council of the Regulatory Body for Electronic Media (REM), and a ban on progovernment tabloids. These demands arose from the perception that Serbia’s toxic media environment, which was controlled by the government and full of hate speech and violence, was responsible for creating an environment in which the shootings were possible. When none of the protest demands were fulfilled, the opposition demanded snap elections for parliament and the Belgrade City Assembly, later forming an election coalition under the title Serbia against Violence once the elections were called.\n\nSerbian politics continue to be dominated by President Vučić, who, despite formally resigning as president of the SNS in May, continued to de-facto run both the party and the state and far overstepped his constitutional prerogatives. Despite not running himself in the 2023 elections, he was a central figure of the campaign, and all SNS lists used his name in their titles. He remained omnipresent on mainstream TV stations.\n\nThe return of the opposition to the parliament in 2022 after 3 years of electoral and parliamentary boycott represented a real opportunity for the normalization of political life. However, parliament remained a dysfunctional institution rife with insults and physical altercations, with the opposition frequently being prevented from properly engaging in the work of the parliament by the ruling majority. For example, when a committee headed by the opposition was established to investigate the circumstances that led to the two mass shootings in May, the ruling majority declined to take part in its work after parents of some of the victims from Vladislav Ribnikar elementary school asked that the committee’s work be postponed until the trial ended.\n\nCivil society organizations in Serbia continued to be the target of frequent smear campaigns by progovernment media in the same manner as opposition political parties and independent media are targeted. Serbia’s civil society sector saw some notional progress with the formation of the Council for Creating a Stimulating Environment for the Development of the Civil Society, but the situation is yet to substantially improve. Some civil society representatives also found themselves under a cyberattack carried out by unknown perpetrators but with characteristics of a state-sponsored attack, the first such cases recorded in Serbia and the region.\n\nMedia freedom in Serbia continued its downward trajectory, as all negative trends from previous years persisted in 2023. The number of cases of pressure and attacks on journalists significantly increased in comparison with last year, and frequent targeting of journalists by ruling party officials and progovernment media continued to undermine the journalistic community’s work. Especially frequent were attacks on journalists at outlets owned by United Group, a privately held multinational media company operating mostly in the former Yugoslavia. One of United Group journalist even had to be relocated abroad for his own safety after receiving credible death threats.\n\nAfter REM decided to award four national broadcasting licenses to propagandistic progovernment TV stations in 2022, it indefinitely postponed its decision on the country’s fifth license, which United Group’s Nova had been expected to win. With more than a year passing since the original deadline for allocating the fifth frequency, REM has clearly showed that it is operating in service of the government and the ruling party, despite its mandate to be an independent regulator.\n\nThe commercial tug of war between the state-owned Telekom Srbija and the United Group continued in 2023, with the government clearly favoring Telekom Srbija. The conflict has vast implications for media freedom in Serbia, as United owns several media outlets that are frequently critical of the government, most notably cable television stations Nova and the 24-hour news channel N1, as well as the cable operator that broadcasts them, Serbia Broadband (SBB).\n\nJudicial reform, a process that started in 2021 with the enactment of constitutional changes and later confirmed via a referendum in January 2022, was largely completed after a set of judicial and prosecutorial laws was adopted in early 2023. The reform was supposed to reduce political influence on the judiciary through the appointment of “prominent lawyers” to the bodies in charge of appointing judges and prosecutors, the High Judicial Council and the High Prosecutorial Council, respectively.\n\nHowever, the appointment process did not follow Serbia’s regular two-thirds majority procedure, and instead used a backup mechanism to bypass the need for political consensus-building to install seven of the eight candidates. Coupled with the controversial transfer of two prosecutors away from the anticorruption unit this year, only days after they had made arrests in a high-level corruption case, these developments cast doubts on the depoliticization of the Serbian judiciary.\n\nSerbia made some progress on paper when it comes to fight against corruption. A National Anti-Corruption Strategy and its accompanying action plan has still not been adopted almost 5 years since the previous one expired, but a measure of progress was finally made in that regard, as the government formed a working group for its drafting and organized a public debate. The Law on Public Procurement was amended in October to fulfil Serbia’s obligations concerning European Union (EU) accession, and the government took steps to address recommendations from the Council of Europe’s Group of States against Corruption (GRECO). Finally, the controversial Law on Linear Infrastructure Projects, which was believed to allow the potential for significant corruption in large projects, was finally annulled in July.\n\nHowever, the existence of genuine political will to tackle corruption is much less clear. Only months after annulling the Law on Linear Infrastructure Projects, parliament adopted a special law exempting EXPO 2027, an exposition being planned to be held in Belgrade in 2027, and the Serbia National Stadium slated to be built in the capital’s outskirts—valued together at more than $1 billion—from the Law on Public Procurement. Additionally, where Serbian authorities have moved against high-level corruption, in some cases the prosecution has remained slow and passive, while government officials and progovernment media attempted to discredit the investigations."
