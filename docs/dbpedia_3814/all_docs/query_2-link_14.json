        "text": "Niš Constantine the Great Airport opened its new terminal building for passenger use this morning following two years of construction, with the state outlining plans to subsidise low cost carriers (LCCs) to boost traffic. Air Serbia passengers bound for Athens this morning were the first to use the new facilities. The terminal’s opening comes at a time when the airport faces declining passenger numbers, handling 168.406 travellers during the first half of the year, down 19% on the same period in 2023. The airport blames the underperformance on Wizz Air which has been forced to reduce its operations due to the grounding of aircraft as a result of manufacturing issues with engines on part of its fleet.\n\nDuring the official terminal opening ceremony yesterday, Serbia’s President, Aleksandar Vučić, said the government would provide subsidies for low cost carriers to expand their respective networks from Niš. “Next year Niš Airport should be able handle over 500.000 passengers, which is why additional low cost carriers need to launch flights. We will now enter into talks with low cost airlines over the introduction of new routes. It is important for us to ease pressure on Air Serbia due to the upcoming EXPO 2027”, Mr Vučić said. The state is already subsidising Air Serbia’s operations out of Niš under a Public Service Obligation agreement. This summer season, Ryanair is Niš Airport’s largest carrier based on available seat capacity, with a 37.4% share, followed by Air Serbia on 35%, and Wizz Air with the remaining 27.6% of capacity.\n\nThe new terminal building in Niš can handle 1.5 million passengers per year and up to six aircraft at the same time. It boasts ten check-in desks, self-check-in stations, eight passport control booths, four passenger gates, a business lounge and one VIP gate. Furthermore, it features a luggage sorting facility. New food and beverage outlets, as well as duty free shops will be added over an area of 700 square metres. Initially, the new terminal will cater for departing passengers with the old terminal to be used for handling arriving travellers. However, the airport plans to demolish the old terminal and construct a new building which will form a single functioning unit with the new terminal. A car park with the capacity for 580 vehicles has also been built. The new terminal is valued at eleven million euros, while a further five million was invested for the purchase of new equipment."
