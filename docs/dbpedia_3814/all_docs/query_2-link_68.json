        "text": "This paper examines Kosovo’s security and defence environment within the context of the Western Balkans. For this purpose, it firstly analyzes the national security and defence policies of the countries of the region, their military capabilities and defence spending, military exports and imports, as well as the distribution of military bases, independently from the influence of the key external security and defence actor – North Atlantic Alliance. Also, this analysis entails a wide range of the official data on these issues. Secondly, it analyzes the impact of NATO’s involvement on the security of the region, and this is done through the analyses of the military involvement, cooperation and membership mechanisms. Thirdly, it discusses Kosovo’s security dilemmas and defence challenges, including those with Serbia, and the prospects for possible official cooperation with NATO.\n\nFighting as a social phenomenon evaluates and changes continuously. While the term \"hybrid war\" has become a key element in the security vocabulary of the Western Balkans and beyond. At the same time, with the recent developments in technology, security organizations/ institutions are interested in increasing their preparedness for possible future wars. Because of the way of how currently security organizations/institutions are operating, there are reasonable concerns to believe that they cannot appropriately respond to new wars if it is approached in the same way as it has been done in the past. In the absolute meaning of technological growth, the security institutions are confronting a change of perspectives and the preparation of a new social and cultural generation about how war will be understood in the future and the change of its shape at a time when it also changes the term \"classical war.\" The term \"hybrid war\" is entering the security doctrine increasingly every day and is becoming an influential part. The threats that come from the hybrid war include propaganda, the creation of various misinformation expressed as fake news known as counterfeit information arranged, processed, and directed specifically to misinform, known as' deep fake'; cyber-attacks, intrusions into computer systems, various economic pressures; sabotage, financing the media, multiple portals; and well-known analysts of particular topics, mainly political security, economic issues, etc. The threats of hybrid war, in recent years, are felt to a large extent in the Western Balkans, so the security institutions have started to treat these issues seriously, and have undertaken various actions to prevent them. Such threats are felt in Kosovo as well. Due to its internal circumstances, regional context, and international developments, Kosovo is a country that can very quickly be exposed to hybrid threats.\n\nThe relationship between major powers in the world determines the level of global stability. Two constellations are imagin-able: balance of power and collective security. The end of major (world or cold) wars offers possibilities for change from one constellation to another. This article tries to explain the origins of the Ukraine crisis. It posits that the crisis in Ukraine is only a symptom of a wider conflict between two major powers (or power blocs), whose origins can only be understood by assessing the post-Cold War security architecture in Europe. Instead of having integrated Russia in a collective security organization on an equal level, the West kept NATO alive and by doing so deteriorated the relationship with Russia. Despite different warnings from Moscow, NATO invited Ukraine to become member, and the EU offered Trade and Association Agreement talks to Ukraine. As a result, the relationship glided back towards a classic balance of power relation with spheres of influences. To prevent similar conflicts in the future, Russia should be integrated into the Euro-Atlantic security architecture. Ideally, the existing collective defence organization (NATO) should be transformed into a collective security organization with the inclusion of both Russia and Ukraine. Policy Implications • The way how the 'losers' of a (cold) war are treated determines the stability in the aftermath. The international community did well after 1815 and 1945, but failed miserably after 1918. The argument of this article is that also after 1989 the West missed an opportunity to integrate Russia into the Euro-Atlantic security architecture (on an equal basis). The end of (cold) wars are perfect times for trying to move from one great power constellation to another (e.g. from pure balance of power to collective security). • Collective defence organizations (= alliances) are inherently unstable as they are constantly looking for an external enemy. This article argues that NATO's prolonged life after the Cold War is not normal, and contributed to the crisis with Russia (by extending NATO to the East, incl. plans to include Georgia and Ukraine). Collective security organizations (like the UN) are more stable. • American and European interests sometimes overlap, but not always, also within NATO. One can observe a pattern whereby the US pushes the Europeans to accept the American view. For instance on NATO extension (certainly in 2008), as well as on missile defence. This article implicitly argues that the European member states within NATO should be more careful to agree with the US view if it does not fit their own interests.\n\nNATO's involvement in Kosovo and its transformation from a military intervention to a UN-authorized peacekeeping operation has played a key role in the evolution of the alliance's strategic and political agenda. This article explores the importance of NATO's engagement with Kosovo in retrospect and in relation to the future outlook for European and global peace and security. It focuses on the centrality of this case for NATO's post-Cold War identity and as a key issue in the renewed political conflict associated with the transitional international order. We make three arguments. First, we argue that NATO's involvement in Kosovo has shaped and exacerbated the broader friction associated with the shifting international order. Second, we make the case that this engagement has played a key role in the strategic, political and operational development of NATO and its evolving identity. Thirdly, as a result of this, we argue that NATO's evolution and transformation in Kosovo was guided by what we call the logic of successful security practices. This entails making prudent political choices and implementing practical steps to harmonize divergent strategic interests among NATO members, adapting to shifting security circumstances, and upholding the organization's significance, credibility and influence both within and beyond the Euro-Atlantic community."
