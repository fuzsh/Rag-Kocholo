        "text": "A QSL from Music Wave Radio, a pirate station on 3940 kHz. The transmitter location is a bit unclear. Some sources state that it is Belarus, with programs produced in Russia. Anyway, it is definitely not the eastern part of The Netherlands, the UK where most of my pirate QSLs come from.\n\nWhen I listened Music Wave Radio was broadcasting Russian pop and rock music. Shazam helped me out to identify some titles and artists, but I still had to decipher them from cyrillic script. Apparently I passed the test because operator Evgeniy confirmed my reception report with in a day. I sent my report to podradio@mail.ru.\n\nI got a nice e QSL document for my reception of pirate radio station Polaris Radio on 6390 kHz. It had with quite a bit of information which I will not share here for obvious reasons. Unlike most pirate stations they are transmitting from the western part of The Netherlands with a maximum power of 2 kW into an inverted V antenna. I sent my report to polarisradio@hotmail.com .\n\nThis morning I listened to Radio City via Channel 292 on 9670 and 6070 kHz. A nice mix of lesser known oldies, including some French songs that always give you that ‚Äúsummer feeling‚Äù. Within an hour I received the above QSL which gives some information about the format. The 2nd page of the QSL (not shown here) gave information about the music that was played.\n\nThe ‚ÄúTower of Power!‚Äù logo on the QSL confirmed what I already suspected. The station is named after the offshore radio station. The original Radio City was active between 1964 and 1967 from the Shivering Sands Army fort in the Thames Estuary. These were the wild days of offshore radio in the UK, culminating in Radio City‚Äôs manager Reginald Calvert being killed by Oliver Smedley, former manager of offshore Radio Atlanta, in a violent row about a transmitter sale.\n\nA QSL for Realmix Radio from southern Finland on 6195 kHz.\n\nWith the major broadcasters leaving shortwave there is a trend of smaller low power stations to step in. If only for the fun of it! The Netherlands seem to be leading with stations like Casanova, Delta, Veronica and Piepzender. But Finland is following with Scandinavian Weekend Radio, Piko, Realmix Radio and Radio Blacksmith Knoll (the latter one is a station I still have to receive).\n\nI heard Realmix Radio around 18:30 UTC for a few minutes in reasonable quality SINPO23332, with the English presenter clearly understandable. Around 19:00 I was able to pick up a few song titles with Shazam. Their SSTV signal was also clearly audible, but did not result in a decent decode.\n\nI sent my report to realmix.sw@gmail.com . Realmix Radio is on air during the weekend, check for the latest schedule on their Facebook page.\n\nA QSL from Xenon Transmitting Company on 6205 kHz, broadcasting from England, United Kingdom.\n\nI sent my report to xtcshortwave@googlemail.com .\n\nAs they write in their email:\n\nXTC (full name the Xenon Transmitting Company) has been on the air since 1993. We like to talk about various subjects rather than just play music. XTC does not have a regular schedule, but we try to be on the air over the Bank Holidays, Easter and Christmas.\n\nIf you google ‚ÄòUK Free Radio Shortwave Memories from the 1990‚Äôs‚Äô you will find a very good blog which has more information about XTC and other stations that were active during that decade.\n\nI received a fully detailed email to QSL Radio √ñ1 Moosbrunn received on 6155 kHz. I sent my report to oe1.service@orf.at .\n\nRadio √ñsterreich International, also known as ‚ÄúAustria Calling‚Äù among English listeners, discontinued operations in 2003. Shortwave operations continued as Radio √ñ1 International, but got reduced in coverage and quality. In 2010 there was only a 75 minute program on 6155 kHz left.\n\nFrom March 2022 onwards, in response to the war in the Ukraine, it was decided to increase the number of broadcasts again. With 300 kW there are now morning, afternoon and evening programs on 6155, 13730 and 5940 respectively.\n\nTo honor the good old days: below the QSL card from ‚ÄúAustria Calling‚Äù as I received it in 1979.\n\nA nice QSL from Radio Voyager. I heard them on 6956 kHz with nice Jazz music. According to their email they are Free Radio from Northern Italy, transmitting with 400 W on a dipole.\n\nI sent my report to radiovoyager@hotmail.com . They have a facebook page shared with ‚Äì guess what ‚Äì Enterprise Radio ! Star Trek fans will understand the connection. Unfortunately I‚Äôve only just applied for membership, so I can‚Äôt tell you much more about this station.\n\nOne of the first things I discovered when I restarted the hobby almost 2 years ago is how easy it is to decode the various digital modes these days. I played with MultiPSK and received a weather fax from JOMOC Royal Navy Northwood on 2618.5 kHz. The quality was quite poor as I was still working with a simple indoor MLA30+ loop, which picked up a lot of noise. But the JOMOC ID was clearly visible:\n\nAs I didn‚Äôt have an email address I sent my report by regular mail. One and a half year later I received a beautiful paper QSL card. And a letter apologizing for the delay. Well, it was worth waiting for:\n\nApart from the long wait there was a complication in receiving this QSL. For some reason or another a customs declaration form was attached to the envelope. Indicating that the value of the contents was 10 GBP. And prior to delivery by PostNL I had to pay 8 Euros taxes and admin fee as the UK is no longer part of the EU. A complaint could only be filed after payment.\n\nUpon reception of the QSL I tried to file the complaint online. But PostNL forgot to properly register delivery in their systems so that didn‚Äôt work‚Ä¶ In other words: basically I was taxed for something they were not even able to demonstrate that it was actually deliveredüòÇ . The PostNL helpdesk explained that all I could do was send a letter to their head offices‚Ä¶ in the end I got a 2.36 Euro refund‚Ä¶ I left it at that‚Ä¶\n\nI did not count on it as I didn‚Äôt had the time to listen to their full 1 hour programme. Just dropped them a quick comparison of the 6070 and 9670 reception quality. But probably out of courtesy towards a regular listener I received the August ‚Äô24 QSL for their broadcast via Channel 292, Rohrbach, Germany.\n\nYou can always listen back to their programs via the website: http://radioatlantic2000.free.fr/\n\nI am a fan of Channel 292. It is a nice platform for enthusiastic producers to share their view on music across international borders. This weekend I listened to Alt Universe Top 40. A nice show that provides context on a Top 40 chart in a selected year.\n\nJohn McMullan is the man behind Alt Universe Top 40. He was so kind to confirm my reception report with a very nice email. Please check out John on his next show, and send him a report!"
