        "text": "On June 3rd, Serbian J-22 \"Orao\" crashed in central Serbia. Unlucky aircraft was recently overhauled #25156 (check pic):\n\npiloted by Major Slobodan Jocic, second from the right in this pic:\n\nJocic managed to point the plane into a nearby lake and eject.\n\nReasons of the crash are still unknown but hydraulics failure and unability to extend the gear is being mentioned as well as the fact that pilot was given an order to eject once he dumps/expends all the inboard fuel.\n\nThere's like 150kgs of fuel left in the aircraft but the water of Knicko lake he chose to crash the plane into is used as a drinking water for population of nearby town of Kragujevac.\n\nHere's a video of Orao in action:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmpylm1MKkI\n\nPilot Maj. Jocic suffered spine injuries but generally he's OK. He was communicating right after ejection with SAR team that flew him with a Mi/Mil-8 to Military hospital in Belgrade. He was subject to surgery but he's recovering and will join his Sqn soon enough.\n\nJ-22 #25156 was overhauled at MOMA institute recently and given operational status with 98.lb regiment of V&PVO on March 2nd, 2010. It took cca 40 flights inbetween and flew for 25 hours in total since overhaul. Maj. Jocic was an element lead yesterday of a 4 ship formation tasked with low alt-high speed formation flight training. Pilots were practising for a Pancevo Airshow flying at 500m AGL at 720kph.\n\nFlight lasted for 45 minutes when formation returned to Ladjevci AB near city of Kraljevo. During final approach Maj. Jocic experienced a left main gear failure, it didn't extend. Pilot tried both hydraulic and mechanical procedures of extending the gear but left gear remained locked inside gearbay. Jocic also performed few touch and go hoping that vibrations would unlock the gear. Nothing helped and with only 200kgs of fuel Jocic was ordered to extend some 15kms away near Knicko Lake and was given order to eject and sink the plane into a juice.\n\nTotal of 120 J-22 were made in Yugoslavia for use with JRV (YuAF). Yugoslavia didn't export Oraos like it's smaller brothers Jastreb, Galeb and Super Galeb but 36 Oraos were scheduled for production in 1992 and rumor had it that Vietnam was their destination. With the break up of Yugoslavia in '91 none these 100 something planes joined Croatian Airforce in it's years of baptism. Such a pity 'cause I'd rather see J-22 than PC-9M over Croatian skies today.\n\nEdited June 4, 2010 by Vekkinho\n\nHi Dimtirije, I never knew it was You hiding under =4C=Destroyer nick so I'm really honoured to have you here at Forums Eagle and I'm proud and glad you're a LOMAC-FC-FC2 fan.\n\nI really admire your work and all the photos and articles we get from you!\n\nSo here's one big thanks from Croatia that You deserved so many times so far!\n\nSalut!\n\nEdited June 6, 2010 by Vekkinho"
