        "text": "Dear Dubravka Đedović, Minister of Mining and Energy, Emanuele Giaufret, Head of the EU Delegation in Serbia, Siniša Mitrović, Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Serbia, Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.\n\nMy name is Matilde Mordt, I am the newly appointed UN Resident Coordinator in Serbia. I am bringing to Serbia more than 30 years of experience in sustainable development, having served the UN, amongst other, as global practice manager in environment and energy at UNDP. I have followed the climate change agenda closely for decades, that despite significant advances through the Paris Agreement and the Nationally Determined Contributions, has not been enough to change the reality of increasing global temperatures and their catastrophic effects – as we are sadly experiencing year by year. More recently, I am coming in from leading the UN’s development programme in Ecuador, that included far reaching and ambitious action in the areas of climate change, ecosystem preservation, management of harmful chemicals, and sustainable production and consumption. Thus, this is a theme that lies very close to my heart and where I look forward to fruitful discussions and collaboration in the future, both in advancing policy frameworks as well as in supporting concrete investments.\n\nI am glad to address you today at this conference and I extend my gratitude to the organizers for their continued dedication to the green agenda.\n\nThe triple planetary crisis—climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution—already impacts every aspect of development. In Serbia, these challenges are witnessed firsthand: air pollution affects our health – particularly that of children and young people - while floods, storms and heatwaves are a threat to the stability of food production, just to mention a few examples. In this context, we welcome the increased investments Serbia is making in the field of environmental protection and decarbonization, and fully support an adaptive vision of development, which prevents and anticipates future needs, while being ready to respond to crisis and emergencies.\n\nMuch remains to be done as Serbia still depends on coal for over 65% of its energy needs, with an economy that is highly carbon and energy intensive. Importantly, as we embark on the transition to a low-carbon and circular economy, our priority remains also to support the most vulnerable. For almost 50% of Serbian households, housing and energy costs are a heavy financial burden. 10% say that they cannot afford to keep their home adequately warm in winter. Also, mining communities, which have long relied on coal for their livelihoods, must be informed and involved in the decisions for their future, as society moves away from fossil fuels. The path to a green future must be inclusive and equitable. Our goal is a just transition—one that ensures no one is left behind and where the benefits of a green economy are shared by all.\n\nSerbia Goes Green is not just an environmental imperative; as we will hear today, it is also a tremendous economic opportunity for the country. The shift towards renewable energy, the adoption of circular economy principles, and the integration of green innovations will transform the economy, boost efficiency in resource use and create new jobs.\n\nIn 2023 and the early months of 2024, there has been significant progress. For example, a three-year auction plan, which started in 2023 and spans to 2025, is expected to double Serbia’s renewable energy production by adding 1,300 MW of solar and wind capacity. New investments are planned to decarbonize and expand district heating, while more municipalities will benefit from subsidies for the adoption of energy efficiency measures by households. From the finance perspective, the issuance of green and SDGs bonds in 2021 and 2024 provides an innovative and essential foundation to the green transformation, as well as for social investments.\n\nPartnerships between the private and public sectors are crucial for realizing green projects that contribute to environmental preservation. We are encouraged by the Declaration on the Green Transformation of the Serbian Economy by the Chamber of Commerce and are committed to continue supporting its implementation. This is also an opportunity to bring in SMEs and value chains that are still reporting challenges to find the resources to invest and fully benefit from the green transition.\n\nThe United Nations is proud to support Serbia in these endeavors. In 2023, our initiatives spanned clean energy, air quality improvement, climate change adaptation, and community resilience. From the installation of air pollution sensors in schools, to the development of Local Waste Management Plans incorporating circular economy principles, our efforts have reached over 880,000 people, also mobilizing youth to take action.\n\nWe have seen the power of innovative business ideas with solutions that contribute to decarbonizing the economy, reducing pollution and delivering environmental, social and economic benefits to local communities. Initiatives such as the 'Liquid Tree' for air purification, or the incubation center for breeding larvae capable of biodegrading certain types of plastic, presented at the Fair of Green Ideas, demonstrate the creativity and commitment of Serbian innovators.\n\nAs we move forward, let us remain steadfast in our commitment to environmental sustainability and social equity.\n\nThank you for your attention, and I look forward to the productive discussions ahead."
