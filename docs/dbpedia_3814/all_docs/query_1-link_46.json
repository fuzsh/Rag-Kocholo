        "text": "China\n\nAnticipated hierarchical structure (general to specific):\n\nChina contains many place types, some of which have more than one possible child types, some of which, in turn, have more than one possible parent type. In the middle levels, each type is identified with a unique qualifier, which is then listed after each lower level that can have that type as a parent. For example, if a type in Level Two is listed under the identifier I, and I appears in the parent column for an entry in Level Three, that means that type of place can only exist under the type identified by I. However, if a type in Level Three is listed as (I, II), that means that type can be found as a child of either Type I or Type II in Level Two. Several Level Four places have Level Two parents. Level Five places can theoretically be found under any Level Four type, while Level Six places can theoretically be found under any Level Five type.\n\nLv\n\nId\n\nEnglish\n\nChinese\n\nPinyin\n\nParent Id(s)\n\nFamilySearch Places Type\n\n1Republic共和国GònghéguóN/ARepublic2I.Autonomous Region自治区ZìzhìqūLevel 1Autonomous Region2II.Province省ShěngLevel 1Province2III.Municipality直辖市ZhíxiáshìLevel 1Major City3A.Sub-provincial-level autonomous prefecture副省级自治州Fù shěng jí zìzhìzhōuIPrefecture3B.Prefectural-level city地级市Dì jí shìI, IIMunicipality3C.Autonomous prefecture自治州ZìzhìzhōuI, IIPrefecture\n\n3D.Prefecture地区DìqūI, IIPrefecture3E.League盟MéngIPrefecture3F.Sub-provincial-level city副省级城市Fù shěng jí chéngshìIIMunicipality4a.District市辖区Shì xiáqūA, B, C, D, E, F, IIIDistrict4b.County-level city县级市Xiàn jí shìA, B, C, D, E, FCity4c.County县XiànA, B, C, D, E, F, IIICounty4d.Autonomous county自治县ZìzhìxiànA, B, C, D, E, FCounty4e.Banner旗QíA, B, C, D, ECounty4f.Autonomous banner自治旗Zìzhì qíA, B, C, D, ECounty4g.Special district特区TèqūB, C, D, FCounty4h.Sub-prefectural-level city副地级市Fù dì jí shìIICity4j.Forestry district林区Lín qūIICounty4k.Sub-provincial-level new area副省级市辖新区Fù shěng jí shì xiá xīnqūIIICounty5i.Subdistrict街道JiēdàoLevel 4\n\nSub-District5ii.Town镇ZhènLevel 4\n\nTown5iii.Township乡XiāngLevel 4\n\nTownship5iv.Ethnic township民族乡Mínzú xiāngLevel 4\n\nTownship5v.District Public Office区公所Qū gōngsuǒLevel 4\n\nDistrict5vi.County-level district县辖区Xiàn xiáqūLevel 4\n\nDistrict5vii.Administrative division苏木Sū mùLevel 4\n\nTownship5viii.Ethnic administrative division民族苏木Mínzú sū mùLevel 4\n\nTownship61.Residential community社区ShèqūLevel 5Village62.Village村CūnLevel 5Village63.Investigation Area嘎查Gā cháLevel 5Village\n\nHistorical treatment in FamilySearch Places:\n\nSpecial Administrative Districts (such as Hong Kong and Macau) have been included as top level (country level) places and are not listed as children of China. China may be included as a Related Place.\n\nNo start date is included for China proper, and the display name in English is set to \"China\" as opposed to \"People's Republic of China\", which is included as an Alternate Standard Full Name.\n\nDue to the language in question, a Full Name variant should be included to contain the place type for most if not all places. The Pinyin representation should also be included as another variant, as many people would be unable to distinguish between a place's true name an the place type. While place types are simplified for the purpose of searching, Additional Type Information should be included where necessary.\n\nIf the historical place's jurisdiction is not found in the chart, then just use an equivalent jurisdiction to describe the place.\n\nTrusted sources:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_China\n\nLinked Wikipedia Pages\n\nLanguage (anticipated default language(s), other significant display languages):\n\nzh-Hans (Simplified Chinese; Default Language); zh-Hant (Traditional Chinese; Expected additional language); zh-Latn-pinyin (used for displaying Pinyin or Romanized Chinese names; also expected; Should include standard diacritics); en is optional where words like \"Province\" appear, but pinyin variants should not be listed as English.\n\nJapan\n\nAnticipated hierarchical structure (general to specific):\n\nCountry; Prefecture(after 1871)/Province (before 1871); City (big urban city-- in the US we have a low-bar for how big a place is to be a city)/County; Town/Village/Neighborhood\n\nIf a city was formed by multiple towns/villages together, add the town/village of the same name as the city as an earlier time period EXCEPT if the town or village is now a child place of the city. Remember in Japan, Cities can contain towns inside of them since cities are basically fully urban counties in Japan.\n\nAnticipated place types and what to do with them:\n\nDistricts were administrative units in use between 1878 and 1921, but this type is no longer in official use after 1921, so these are not input in most cases.\n\nPlace names in Japanese include a suffix that designates the official place type:\n\nPlace Type in KanjiPlace Type in RomajiPlace Type in EnglishFS Places Equivalent県kenPrefecturePrefecture都toMetropolisPrefecture府fuUrban PrefecturePrefecture道dōCircuitPrefecture郡gunDistrictDistrict市shiCityCity町chō or machiTownTown村mura, sometimes sonVillageVillage区kuBoroughBorough (under Tokyo, use City rather than Borough)\n\n( See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_Japan for more details, including additional specialized place types.)\n\nHistorical treatment in FamilySearch Places:\n\nMany places have been cleaned up to be placed in the correct parent Province. Islands outside of province boundaries have been placed within the closest appropriate province.\n\nThe Emperor gained centralized control of the country in 1871 and switched to a prefecture system.\n\nPrior to the Emperor gaining control, Japan was organized into Domains/Provinces where power was more spread out then centralized.\n\nBetween 1868 and 1871, a lot of domains split off of earlier domains. Our standard is to represent all of these new domains.\n\nAfter 1871, there was a lot of different start dates for certain prefectures, our standard is to give these prefectures a start date of 1871.\n\nThere's a common pattern of smaller villages merging into other villages and cities:\n\na. 1868 - The end of the Edo period. There was a lot of redistricting and merging many villages into one. https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B9%95%E6%9C%AB\n\nb. 1889 (Meji 22) - Due to the \"Town and Village System\" a lot more villages merged into a single town or village. https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%94%BA%E6%9D%91%E5%88%B6\n\nc. 1954 - (At least in Fukushima and closeby prefectures) This is a common year for the 1889 towns/villages to merge into cities/larger entities.\n\nLanguage (anticipated default language(s), other significant display languages):\n\nJapanese (ja) will be the Native Spoken Language. Each name added should have the following forms, with each form having a Full version with the place suffix, and a Short version without:\n\nja-Hani Full Name (Kanji)\n\nja-Hani Short Name (Kanji)\n\nen (English) (Note: English translations of Japanese media include the place type; e.g. 'Inada Village,' so this form is appropriate to add as a Full Name alternate name in English. However, the Short Name form should be used as the display name. )\n\nja-Hira (Hiragana)\n\nja-Latn-hepburn (Hepburn Romaji)\n\nYou may need to do more of these varieties if the place has more than one place type over its timeline.\n\nThe Full Name for ja-Hani will be used as the Japanese display name, and the Short Name for English will be used as the English display name.\n\nGiven correct Kanji, we should be able to auto-generate the Hiragana and Romaji name forms in most cases. Rare exceptions will need manual correction. English display names often closely match the Romaji but in some cases are slightly different, so manual entry is preferred.\n\nLike China, existing places may have legacy name types such as ja-Latn-x-nga. Ideally these should be converted to ja-Latn-hepburn name forms.\n\nKeep in mind that kanji can have more than one pronunciation. For example the character 東 is pronounce as 'Higashi' as well as 'Azuma'. This makes searching for places via English dicey for non-Japanese speakers.\n\nAlbania\n\nAnticipated hierarchical structure (general to specific):\n\nCountry\n\nCounty (Top Level)\n\nMunicipality\n\nAlbania is divided into 12 counties, which further divided into 61 municipalities. The municipalities are divided into 373 administrative units.\n\nFrom 1912 to 2000, Albania was divided into Districts (rreth or rrethet). In 1991, the 36 districts were organized into counties. From 2000 to present, the counties have remained without the districts.\n\nBetween 1959 and 1991 there were 26 districts. In 1991 the districts were reorganized into 36 districts. In 2000, the districts were abolished and replaced with top-level counties. Albania's been through a lot of administrative change since 1912. Because of that change, we decided to only track the modern administrative structure for 1912 - present.\n\nHere's some articles about the administrative levels of Albania:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Albania\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_Albania#:~:text=The%20administrative%20divisions%20of%20Albania,its%20administrative%20divisions%2021%20times.\n\nAnticipated place types and what to do with them:\n\nMunicipalities of Albania are relatively large - more like Serbian or Croatian municipalities than the smaller municipalities of Italy or Germany. Because of this, if the municipality is named after its central village, the village and the municipality should each have their own place sets.\n\nHistorical treatment in FamilySearch Places:\n\nFamilySearch Places describes Albania independently beginning in 1912, when the Balkan War began and Albanians sought recognition as an independent state. Before that time, Albania was part of the Ottoman Empire. It was subdivided into at least three separate Vilayets (provinces): Janina (12204060), Ishkodre (12203994) and Monastir (12203010).\n\nLanguage:\n\nAlbanian (sq) will be the native language for the vast majority of places in Albania. Greek, Macedonian, Montenegrin, Serbian could be important alternate names. Ottoman Turkish (ota-Arab), which is written in an Arabic script, for place names may also be needed for the historic, Ottoman period.\n\nBelgium\n\nAnticipated hierarchical structure (general to specific):\n\nBelgium has several layers of administration. FS Places has chosen to use and describe them as follows:\n\nLevel 1: Province (province/provincie)\n\nLevel 2: Municipality (commune/gemeente)\n\nLevel 3: Towns, Villages, etc.\n\nLevels of administration that are described in places but only used as a Related Place include regions (régions/regions), and provincial districts (arrondissments/arrondissementen).\n\nAnticipated place types and what to do with them:\n\nBelgium uses the terms arrondissments/arrondissementen to describe the administrative layer between the province and municipal levels. FS Places will use district/arrondissement as the place type for this level.\n\nBelgium uses the term section/deelgemeente to describe places that are part of a municipality (commune/gemeente) but separate from the administrative center. FS Places will use the village or town types to describe these types of places.\n\nHistorical treatment in FamilySearch Places:\n\nBelgium became an independent state in 1830. Prior to this time its territory was governed by various states, including France, the Netherlands, and the Holy Roman Empire. Most places should be described to the date of independence, which is the current focus of FS Places. If sources are available, places can be described further back but should be carefully documented.\n\nSeveral administrative reorganizations have occurred within Belgium, usually resulting in a reduction of the number of municipalities. These reorganizations should be described at the municipal level.\n\nLanguage:\n\nBelgium has three official languages: Dutch, French, and German. Other regional languages spoken include Flemish and Walloon. Places names should be described in the primary language of the region with alternate names in the other languages included as appropriate.\n\nCroatia\n\nAnticipated hierarchical structure (general to specific):\n\nCountry, County, Municipality/City/Town\n\nAnticipated place types and what to do with them:\n\nVillages, farms, cemeteries, churches and Catholic parishes should be described within the appropriate municipality/city/town. Prior to 1967, Districts are a higher jurisdiction level than cities, but for later place data, including modern data, districts should be within a municipality/city/town.\n\nHistorical treatment in FamilySearch Places:\n\nCroatia is described as is from 1992 to present. Certain sources cite the beginning of the modern period as 1991, but after research and discussion we have decided to use 1992. Croatia has been part of multiple other countries at times during its history; these are provided as Historical Periods and include – in addition to the modern Croatia period - Croatia as a child of Yugoslavia (1918-1992), Croatia as a child of Austria (1526-1918), and the Kingdom of Croatia (600 – 1526). Child places should be listed under one or more historical periods as appropriate.\n\nLanguage (anticipated default language(s), other significant display languages):\n\nCroatian will be the default native language for all places, as this is the national and official language. Some of the minority languages used in Croatia include Serbian, Czech, Italian, Hungarian, Slovak, and Romani. Having place names in these languages would be beneficial.\n\nTrusted sources:\n\nWikipedia articles for Croatian places tend to be relatively accurate. Arcanum maps is also a good source.\n\nCzechia\n\nAnticipated hierarchical structure (general to specific):\n\nCountry, **Region/region (since 1949) - Land/země (before 1949); District/okres, municipality/obec\n\n** Because there are less than 80 uniquely-named districts and because the district level has remained constant, while administrative regions have changed significantly several times since 1949, the Region/region level will be described using the \"related place\" function within FamilySearch Places. This means that the primary means of display for a common municipality will only have three levels: municipality, district, country.\n\nAnticipated place types and what to do with them:\n\nVillages (ves/vsi - that are not also the center of a municipality of the same name), farms, cemeteries, and churches should be described within their assigned municipality. Certain municipalities have been granted town/město status and should be described with the place type town rather than municipality.\n\nHistorical treatment in FamilySearch Places:\n\nCzechia (accepted short form of Czech Republic) is described beginning in 1993, when it split from Czechoslovakia. The Czech lands of Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia are described going back to 850, under the Holy Roman Empire or Austria (Austria-Hungary).\n\nTrusted sources:\n\nLanguage (anticipated default language(s), other significant display languages):\n\nCzech will be the default native language for nearly all places, although German would be acceptable for settlements that were mainly German-speaking before the 1940s (Sudetenland, for example). Many places will need German display names. Portions of the country may need Polish or Slovak display names, as well.\n\nEngland\n\nAnticipated hierarchical structure (general to specific):\n\nCountry (England, Scotland and Wales are countries within UK after 1801), County, city/town/village/parish. More urban counties/large cities (e.g. London, Manchester) may be subdivided into boroughs and neighborhoods\n\nAnticipated place types and what to do with them:\n\nParishes (civil parishes now, Anglican or Ancient Parishes historically) are described within England generically (simply as \"Parish\"). The place type Anglican Parish should notbe used within the United Kingdom.\n\nCivil Registration Districts, Poor Law Unions and Hundreds appear frequently in England. They have boundaries and are integral parts of the \"England Maps\" experience. These places should be retained even when they have the same name as a village or town, as they and their unique boundaries will be part of \"England Maps\".\n\nIn many cases, descriptions of villages in England will also be understood to cover the local civil parish of the same name. Whenever a village and (civil) parish carry the same name at the same location, they should be described once with the place type village. Churches (with churchyards/cemeteries) should be described within villages/towns.\n\nHistorical treatment in FamilySearch Places:\n\nEngland is described independently until 1801 and from that point forward as \"England, United Kingdom\". This has been done to help people who may search for \"London, United Kingdom\" or something like that.\n\nLanguage (anticipated default languages, other significant display languages):\n\nEnglish is the primary native language. Welsh, Scottish or French may be useful display names in certain areas of the country.\n\nFinland\n\n(Written by Heidi Kuosmanen)\n\nAnticipated hierarchical structure (general to specific):\n\nHistorical treatment in FamilySearch Places:\n\nHere is a short version of Finland's parishes and municipalities:\n\nBefore christianity (-1200), people lived in small villages. With christianity Catholic Church and Orthodox Church started forming parishes (area of several villages). Parishes were called pitäjä or kirkkopitäjä (church parish) in Finnish.\n\nAfter the Protestant reformation in the 16th century the church also became a state church (the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland (Protestant), which is the primary state religion and the Finnish Orthodox Church) and as such were charged with administrative tasks like as keeping the civic registry. Parishes were also used as cadastral units (maakirjapitäjä), sometimes with slightly different borders. Eventually religious and civil matters became separated in two entities within the same district (in and after 1865), the religious congregation (seurakunta) and the civil parish or rural municipality (maalaiskunta). The civil parish handled municipal tasks, but the congregation still retained a significant share of influence, including responsibility for schools and maintained a population registers.\n\nIn 1865 and after, the modern municipalities were established as secular entities separate from the parishes. Until 1977 municipalities were divided into cities (kaupunki, stad), market towns (kauppala, köping) and rural municipalities (maalaiskunta, landskommun). The market town category was abolished and these were renamed as cities. The rest of the municipalities were classified as 'other municipalities'. All municipalities called maalaiskunta were eventually either merged to their parent cities or changed their names. From 1995 onwards only 'municipality' is recognized by law and any municipality is allowed to call itself a city.\n\nThen there is a question about counties/provinces. Some sources speak counties and some provinces, most official sources have translated Finnish lääni to Province. Before 1634, in Finland we did dot have any provinces, only 9 regions which borders were not very exact. Then year 1634 Provinces were formed and year 2009 they were abolished. Thus we do not have provinces any more.\n\nBetween 1634 and 2009 there have been 25 changes in provinces!\n\nCurrently if we want to have second level places in Finland, we use regions, which started forming after 1920. First they were unofficial, but 1994 and 1997 regions were officially formed.\n\nFinland was previously ruled by Sweden (1200s-1809) and Russia (1809-1918). Historical periods should not be added for these. According to Heidi Kuosmanen, adding a Swedish period would be confusing to Finns. Finland enjoyed a great degree of autonomy during the Russian period. In addition, the jurisdictions remained stable through the Swedish and Russian periods and into modern Finland through the 1990's. Heidi Kuosmanen also noted that adding a Russian period would not be looked upon favorably by Finns.\n\nIreland\n\nAnticipated hierarchical structure (general to specific):\n\nCountry, County, Town/Village/Parish (civil parish), Townland\n\nAnticipated place types and what to do with them:\n\nAs with England, civil parishes became the primary form of local government during the 1800's. FS Places will use the place type category Village or Town rather than Parish. Additional Type Information can be used to point out that a Village is also a Civil Parish.\n\nTownlands are an important subdivision of Irish Parishes. They are an integral part of land records and can be very helpful to researchers. Townlands should be described within their respective Parish (Village or Town, see above).\n\nSuperintendent Registrar District is the Irish equivalent of a Civil Registration District - Birth, marriage and death records are organized by these districts.\n\nPoor Law Unions had identical boundaries to the Superintendent Registrar Districts and all were centered on a market town. FS Places will seek to simply describe the towns once and use Alternate Names and other notes (Additional Type Information) to share meaning around these additional roles as registration districts and poor law unions.\n\nBaronies are a historical subdivision of the counties of Ireland. FS Places describes many (if not all) baronies, but does not include them in the place hierarchy for villages and towns. They may be added as Related Places (\"Additional Jurisdiction\") for villages and towns (Parishes).\n\nHistorical treatment in FamilySearch Places:\n\nIreland is described as a top level place back into antiquity (it has a \"beginning\" year of 400). We choose not to describe Ireland as a child of the United Kingdom from 1801 to 1922. Instead a Related Place connection to United Kingdom is provided. The counties of what is now (since 1922) Northern Ireland are included as children of Ireland up until 1922.\n\nLanguage: (anticipated default language(s), other significant display languages):\n\nAll places should have English set as the native language. This is a reflection of the current situation and helps data stay consistent and useful. Gaelic names, in addition to English names, should be added to places as the information is available.\n\nTrusted sources:\n\nhttps://www.townlands.ie/ Excellent source for townlands and parishes - including boundaries\n\nItaly\n\nAnticipated hierarchical structure (general to specific):\n\nCountry, Region (official since 1940s, but used in place descriptions from 1860), Province/provincia, Municipality/comune, Village or Hamlet/frazione\n\nAnticipated place types and what to do with them:\n\nVillages (frazione - that are not also the center of a municipality/comune of the same name), farms, cemeteries, and churches should be described within their assigned municipality. If the primary settlement of a municipality shares the same name as the municipality, it should only be described once with the place type Municipality.\n\nIt is a common practice to merge two or more municipalities to create a new municipality by a compound name or a new name. When the municipalities are absorbed into the new municipality, those absorbed municipalities are then commonly reclassified as a village or hamlet (frazione), or as a city (città), and are described within the new municipality.\n\nHistorical treatment in FamilySearch Places:\n\nItaly is described in FS Places as a country, beginning in 1860/1861. Before that time, several kingdoms, papal states or city states controlled various parts of modern Italy. These various historic entities should be used to classify and describe historic versions of Italy's towns and cities.\n\nAlthough Italy's regions have only been an official administrative division since 1948, FS Places includes them in place descriptions as early as 1860/1861. They are recognized cultural areas and it is nice to keep historical periods as simple as possible.\n\nTrusted sources:\n\nhttps://www.tuttocitta.it/\n\nhttps://corrierealpi.gelocal.it/\n\nhttp://italia.indettaglio.it/\n\nhttp://www.diocesitn.it/\n\nhttp://www.elesh.it/storiacomuni/cercacomuni.asp\n\nLanguage (anticipated default language(s), other significant display languages):\n\nItalian will be the native language for all places in modern Italy. Many places in the north will have historical periods with German as the native language (e.g. Tirol). Local dialects and variations should be added as Alternate Names (for example, Sicilian, Slovenian, French, Friulan, etc.), as needed.\n\nSlovakia\n\nAnticipated hierarchical structure (general to specific):\n\nCountry, **Region/kraj (since 1949); District/okres, municipality/obec\n\n** Because there are less than 80 uniquely-named districts and because the district level has remained constant, while administrative regions have changed significantly several times since 1949, the Region/kraj level will be described using the \"related place\" function within FamilySearch Places. This means that the primary means of display for a common municipality will only have three levels: municipality, district, country.\n\nAnticipated place types and what to do with them:\n\nVillages (ves/vsi - that are not also the center of a municipality of the same name), farms, cemeteries, and churches should be described within their assigned municipality. Certain municipalities have been granted town/mesto status and should be described with the place type town rather than municipality.\n\nHistorical treatment in FamilySearch Places:\n\nprior to 1918, the area of present-day Slovakia was ruled by the Hungarian monarchy. Villages and towns within Slovakia should have historic descriptions placing them within counties (župa/župy) of Hungary before WWI.\n\nSlovakia, Czechoslovakia: 1918 - 1993\n\nSlovakia: 1993 - TODAY\n\nLanguage (anticipated default languages, other significant display languages):\n\nSlovak is the official language and should be available for all places. Czech, Hungarian, German and Polish should be added as needed for various towns and in certain regions of the country.\n\nArgentina\n\nAnticipated hierarchical structure (general to specific):\n\nThe territorial organization of Argentina is made up of several levels. Due to some differences between the provinces, the general structure will follow the following model:\n\nFirst-level: 23 provinces (provincias)\n\nSecond-Level: 378 departments (departamentos), 135 Partidos (Buenos Aires Province only)\n\nThird-level: Municipalities (municipios)\n\nFourth-level and smaller: Village, Town, City\n\nOne Independent City: Buenos Aires (Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires), is the capital and largest city of Argentina. It is composed of 48 Neighborhoods (barrios), and 15 communes (comunas) that include one or more of the neighborhoods.\n\nException 1: For the provinces of Mendoza, La Rioja, and San Juan, all of which have districts under the departments, the structure will follow this model:\n\nLevel 1 - Province (Provincia)\n\nLevel 2 - Departments (Departamentos)\n\nLevel 3 - Districts (Distritos)\n\nOther Notes - We will not use the place type \"Municipality\" as both these provinces equate districts (in Mendoza and La Rioja) and departments (in San Juan) with municipalities. As a result, we will include and describe all cities and towns in each district, even those that share the same name as the district.\n\nAnticipated place types and what to do with them:\n\nEach commune of Buenos Aires encompasses one or more neighborhoods (barrios), which are represented in the respective community centers for administrative purposes.\n\nRoman Catholic Parishes should be located under the smallest administrative unit where they are located, usually a city, town or village. Roman Catholic Archdioceses and Dioceses should be located directly under the country.\n\nFor the province of Entre Ríos, we will not describe its districts as they are used primarily for cadastral (tax) purposes.\n\nHistorical treatment in FamilySearch Places:\n\nThe history of Argentina can be divided into four main parts: the pre-Columbian time or early history (up to the sixteenth century), the colonial period (1530–1810), the period of nation-building (1810–1880), and the history of modern Argentina (from around 1880).\n\nLanguage (anticipated default languages, other significant display languages):\n\nSpanish\n\nTrusted Sources:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communes_of_Buenos_Aires\n\nhttps://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizaci%C3%B3n_territorial_de_Argentina\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Argentina\n\nDominican Republic\n\nAnticipated hierarchical structure (general to specific):\n\nThe country's territory is divided into:\n\nLevel 1 - Provinces/Provincias (31) & a National District/Distrito Nacional (1)\n\nLevel 2 - Municipalities/Municipios (158)\n\nLevel 3 - Districts/Distritos (235)\n\nThe country is also divided into three macro-regions that are further subdivided into Development Regions (Regiones de Desarrollo). Both possess some administrtive functions and should be described. They should only be used as related places at the provincial level.\n\nNational District/Distrito Nacional - The National District is a subdivision of the Dominican Republic where the capital of the country Santo Domingo de Guzmán is located. This area is further subdivided into incorporated areas called sectors/sectores, which could be considered a small urban cities. For the National District/Distrito Nacional, we will also describe these subdivisions as follows:\n\nLevel 4 - Sectors/sectores as Neighborhoods/Barrios\n\nLevel 5 - if needed, as Subdistricts/Subbarrios\n\nAnticipated place types and what to do with them:\n\nAs the actual place types for levels 1-3 have corresponding types in FS Places, usage should be rather straightforward. Within the National District, sectors/sectores will be described using the type \"Neighborhood or suburb\".\n\nHistorical treatment in FamilySearch Places:\n\nOverall, the country has three general historical periods:\n\nPre-Colonial Period (Unknown-1492)\n\nColonial Period (1492-1844)\n\nModern Period (1844-Today)\n\nDue to the frequent administrative changes to the country's administrative structure, general historical periods based on administrative changes are not feasible. Each province should generally have one historical period that begins with the year of its creation. Municipalities should follow this same guideline, adding historical periods as the parent province changes. The administrative scaffolding should focus on describing the modern era (1844-Today) completely before moving into the previous eras.\n\nLanguage (anticipated default languages, other significant display languages):\n\nSpanish\n\nJamaica\n\nAnticipated hierarchical structure (general to specific):\n\nJamaica is divided into 14 parishes, which are grouped into three historic counties that have no administrative relevance. The counties will not be used in the hierarchy.\n\nThe structure will be neighborhood, city/town/village, parish, country.\n\nLevel 0: Country\n\nLevel 1: Parish\n\nLevel 2: City/Town/Village\n\nLevel 3: Neighborhood\n\nAnticipated place types and what to do with them:\n\nCounty: These will not be used. There are only three historic counties that have no administrative relevance.\n\nParish: There are 14 Parishes in Jamaica. The parishes of Jamaica are the main units of local government in Jamaica.\n\nMunicipality: These will not be used. Currently there are only two, “Kingston & St. Andrew Municipal Corporation”, and “Municipality of Portmore”. These are administrative services only.\n\nCity: Official city status on a settlement is only conferred by Act of Parliament. Only three areas have this designation.\n\nTown/Village: The Statistical Institute of Jamaica considers an urban area to be any area with 2,000 or more residents. A town would generally be considered to be ranked as a higher populated urban area, and a village as a minor urban area.\n\nNeighborhood: Geographically obvious subdivisions of any of the above.\n\nCivil Registration District (CRD): Many City/Town/Villages have a CRD with the same name. The only places designated as a CRD should be those with not having the same name as City/Town/Village. We will not create CRDs for each one. For those cities/towns with a CRD with the same name, one can just make a note that it is also a CRD with same name. Example: https://www.familysearch.org/research/places/?focusedId=1177881\n\nIf a City/Town/Villages resides in a with a different name and has a place ID, we can add the CRD as a Related Place.\n\nHistorical treatment in FamilySearch Places:\n\nJamaica the country will be treated as one historical period. Jamaica was under Spanish rule from 1509 to 1655 then British rule from 1655 to 1962. In 1962 it declared independence and became its own country. No historic periods places will be used for the time of Spanish and British rule.\n\nThe parent Parish of a town/village/etc. may have changed due to creation, deletion, or border change of the Parish. These changes should be shown with Historical Period Tabs of the town/village/etc. As for the Parish place, we do not create additional Historic Period Tabs for just border changes.\n\nA good resource for these changes can be found at: https://liberalarts.tamu.edu/nautarch/port-royal-archives/port-royal-maps/parishes-of-jamaica/\n\nLanguage (anticipated default languages, other significant display languages):\n\nJamaica is regarded as a bilingual country, with two major languages in use by the population. The official language is English, which is \"used in all domains of public life\", including the government, the legal system, the media, and education.\n\nHowever, the primary spoken language is an English-based creole called Jamaican Patois (or Patwa).\n\nBoth languages should be used when possible. Currently in FamilySearch Places there is no language option for Patwa.\n\nVenezuela\n\nAnticipated hierarchical structure (general to specific):\n\nADM 1: States (23 in total)\n\nADM 2: Municipalities (335 in total)\n\nADM 3: Civil Parishes (1,146 in total)\n\nADM 4: Villages, Hamlets, etc.\n\nADM 5: Religious Parishes, Cemeteries, Schools, Hospitals, etc.\n\nIn addition to the states, the ADM 1 includes other federal entities: the Capital District (which includes part of the city of Caracas), the Federal Dependencies (islands, mostly uninhabited) and the Federal Territories. Venezuela also has a Reclamation Zone. (are subdivided into Villages and Hamlets).\n\nHistorical treatment in FamilySearch Places:\n\nHistorical subdivisions:\n\nPrior to the Federal War (1859–1863), Venezuela was divided into provinces rather than states. The victorious forces were supposed to grant more autonomy to the individual states, but this was not implemented.\n\nBetween 1863 and the early 1900s, there were numerous territorial changes, including the merger and splitting of states. Thereafter, until the late 1990s, the states were left unchanged. Recent years have seen the creation of three new states: Delta Amacuro, Amazonas, and Vargas.\n\n1899-04-22: National Congress decreed a return to the twenty states of 1864. The 1901 constitution defined the states to be the same as under the 1864 constitution, with the following names changed: Barinas to Zamora, Barquisimeto to Lara, Caracas to Miranda, Coro to Falcón, Cumaná to Sucre, Guayana to Bolívar, Maracaibo to Zulia, and Margarita to Nueva Esparta. At the same time, Distrito Federal and the territories of Amazonas, Colón, Delta Amacuro, and Yuruary were created.\n\nLanguage (anticipated default languages, other significant display languages):\n\nSpanish\n\nCanada\n\nAnticipated hierarchical structure (general to specific):\n\nCountry; Province; County or District; Township/City; Village/Hamlet\n\nAnticipated place types and what to do with them:\n\nRegional municipalities will be classified in FS Places as counties or districts, depending on their history.\n\nHistorical treatment in FamilySearch Places:\n\nCanada is described in FS Places as a country beginning in 1867. Before that time, the provinces and places now within Canada are described within \"British Colonial America.\"\n\nLanguage (anticipated default language(s), other significant display languages):\n\nEnglish will be the Native Spoken Language for all places in Canada that are not within Quebec. French should be the Native Spoken Language for Quebec and its subordinate places. French place names could be important for significant towns and cities near Quebec and various Native American language names may be important in certain cases.\n\nAlberta\n\nhttps://www.alberta.ca/types-of-municipalities-in-alberta.aspx\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_municipalities_in_Alberta\n\nMany different types of municipalities.\n\nCities are directly under the province. Towns, Villages, and Summer Villages should be children of the municipal district that surrounds them.\n\nSpecialized Municipalities, Municipal Districts, Improvement Districts, Metis Settlements, Special Areas, and First Nations Reserves should also be directly under the province.\n\nAll these should be District except First Nations Reserves (which should be Reservation or Reserve)\n\nHamlets and unincorporated settlements should be children of municipal districts (or specialized municipalities)\n\nBritish Columbia\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_municipalities_in_British_Columbia\n\nLike, Alberta, many types of municipalities, most directly under the province:\n\nCities, Towns, and Villages are directly under the province.\n\nIndian government districts, island municipalities, mountain resort municipalities, and resort municipalities are directly under the province.\n\nDistrict municipalities are directly under the province.\n\nCommunities may be children of district municipalities if they are not incorporated as a City, Town, or Village.\n\nManitoba\n\nSome guidelines for working with municipalities in Manitoba:\n\nManitoba distinguishes between urban and rural municipalities.\n\nUrban municipalities often use the place types city, town, and village instead of \"municipality.\"\n\nRural municipalities will use the term \"Rural Municipality\" in the display name to disambiguate them.\n\nUrban municipalities will follow our standard practice of using the name of the municipal head without using any other identifying terms, such as Municipality, in the display name.\n\nManitoba did a huge re-organization/update to its municipalities in 2015. Some guidelines for dealing with the mergers/amalgamations that came out of that:\n\nIf only one rural municipality amalgamates with an urban municipality to create a new municipality with a name that does not match the urban municipality's, the new municipality should be created on the pset of the rural municipality.\n\nIf more than one rural municipality is amalgamating into a new municipality, then the new municipality should be created on its own pset.\n\nCreate the new municipality on the pset of the urban municipality with a place type of \"municipality\" if:\n\nThe rural and urban municipalities share the same primary name, AND\n\nThe new municipality shares this same name.\n\nExample: Ethelbert Rural Municipality (place type: municipality; repID: 11801640; pset ID: ), and Ethelbert (place type: village; repID: 2178974; pset ID: ) merged to create the Municipality of Ethelbert (place type: municipality; repID: 12131271; pset ID: ).\n\nNewfoundland and Labrador\n\nCities, towns, and Inuit community governments should be directly under the province. Census divisions should not be used.\n\nOntario\n\nFor counties that permanently united in the mid-1850s, each county should be in its own pset until the year the counties united, when a new pset should be created to represent the larger merged county (see Leeds and Grenville for an example). For counties that only united for a short period of time, the united county time period will be documented through a note and an alternate name with the full name of the united county. No historical period is necessary (see Wellington, Waterloo, and Grey counties for an example).\n\nTowns and villages should be directly under the county in most cases. Townships should be added as related places.\n\nQuebec\n\nAll municipalities (except cities), whether township, village, parish, or unspecified ones, are functionally and legally identical. The only difference is that the designation might serve to disambiguate between otherwise identically-named municipalities, often neighboring ones. See the following Wikipedia article for more information:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_municipalities_in_Quebec\n\nUnited States of America\n\nAnticipated hierarchical structure (general to specific):\n\nCountry, State, County, City/Town/Village/Hamlet\n\nExceptions to this general hierarchy will be in the New England states (including New York) and Pennsylvania, where FS Places will include an additional level of jurisdiction between county and village (see below for details).\n\nAnticipated place types and what to do with them:\n\nVillages will likely be most common (i.e. Census-designated place, unincorporated community, etc.). Cemeteries and Churches should be described within the village/city that they are in - or very close to (cemeteries). Churches or cemeteries in rural areas (i.e. more than 2 miles from a village or city) may be described directly within a county (most states) or a township/town (special states listed below).\n\nMinor Civil Divisions are an important group of place types for US Census records. They are subdivisions of counties. States use various different types:\n\nTown - Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Vermont, Wisconsin\n\nTownship - Illinois (some counties), Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Ohio, Pennsylvania\n\nmagisterial district: Kentucky, Virginia\n\nmilitia district: Georgia\n\nprecinct: Illinois (some counties)\n\nschool district: Montana\n\nIn most cases these Minor Civil Divisions will be described as Related Places for the villages or hamlets that can be described within them, rather than being included as \"parent places.\" Exceptions to this general rule are detailed below.\n\nConnecticut, Maine, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Wisconsin\n\nAnticipated hierarchical structure (general to specific): Country, State, County, Township/Town/Borough, Village/Hamlet/Neighborhood\n\nSmall communities (villages, hamlets, etc.) in these states should be described within Townships (Pennsylvania) or Towns (all states listed above that are not Pennsylvania) rather than directly within counties.\n\nIllinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Michigan, Nebraska, Ohio\n\nSmall communities in these states will be described directly within counties. Related Places may be used to describe the additional and less important township level (useful for census records and little else).\n\nHistorical treatment in FamilySearch Places:\n\nFamilySearch Places describes British Colonial America as a country-level entity for the area of the United States prior to 1776.\n\nIn the future, FS Places will transition to a \"cleaner\" look in regards to states. States of the US and their counterpart territories, will be described once and once only with Alternate Names helping users connect the slight differences. For example, rather than Wyoming (1890-Today) and Wyoming Territory (1868-1890) FS Places will simply describe Wyoming (1868-Today).\n\nCalifornia, New Mexico, Texas\n\nThese states should all have a New Spain era, and a United States era. In addition, California, New Mexico, and Texas should also have a Mexico era.\n\nCalifornia\n\nMissions and pueblos should be described with the place type Village or Town. We can represent mission or pueblo status in Alternate Names. Ranchos may be described with the place type Farm (smaller) or Estate (larger) or feel free to use Village if that feels like a better option based on the place and its context.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLouisiana uses the term \"Parish\" rather than \"County\" for their primary administrative divisions. To be consistent with other states throughout the US, FS Places will use the place type County for Louisiana's parishes. The alternate names for all of these \"county-like\" parishes in Louisiana should include a full, formal name (for example, \"Acadia Parish\"). The display name for Louisiana's parishes/counties should be the simple, short name (e.g. \"Acadia\"), as it is with other counties in other US states.\n\nLanguage (anticipated default languages, other significant display languages):\n\nEnglish\n\nAustralia\n\nAnticipated hierarchical structure (general to specific)\n\nLevel 1 State & Territory. Australia has 6 states, 3 internal territories, and 7 external territories. Each state & territory has its own terms for cadastral divisions.\n\nLevel 2 Cities, towns, hamlets, villages, suburbs (place type Neighborhoods and Suburbs)\n\nLevel 3 Cemeteries, Churches (Place of worship), Hospitals, Schools, etc.\n\nAnticipated place types and what to do with them:\n\nLGAs should be listed as Municipalities in FamilySearch Places.\n\nHistorical treatment in FamilySearch Places:\n\nHistorical Records of Australia (HRA) records begin shortly before 1788,\n\nHistorically divided into Hundreds and Parishes. Later, Counties, Local Government Areas (LGA), Municipalities and Shires. These places are used as Related Places, not as parents.\n\nLanguage (anticipated default languages, other significant display languages)\n\nEnglish is most commonly spoken. Has no other official languages, though there are Indigenous languages, pidgins, creoles, and immigrants' languages spoken.\n\nDual Place Names:\n\nAboriginal names for places, if available, should be included in place descriptions. They should be listed as an alternate name using the correct language code for the aboriginal language. If desired, they can be listed as a display name. However, they should not be used as a display name jointly with the English place name unless recognized by the government as an official name for that place, which is usually indicated by its use in official government documents, such as birth, marriage, death, or census records."
