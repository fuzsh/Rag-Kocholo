FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA FEDERAL MINISTRY FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS DIRECTORATE FOR INFORMATION S P E C I A L I S S U E O V E R V I E W OF DESTRUCTION OF CIVILIAN TARGETS ON THE TERRITORY OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA AS A RESULT OF BARBARIC AND CRIMINAL AGGRESSION BY NATO, FROM 24 MARCH TO 24 APRIL 1999 CIVILIAN CASUALTIES From the onset of NATO aggression against our country up to 24 April 1999, the North Atlantic Alliance made over 10 000 criminal attacks against the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In air strikes were used: 806 warplanes (of which over 530 combat planes) and 206 helicopters stationed in 30 air-bases (situated in 5 states) and on 6 warships in the Adriatic sea. More than 2500 cruise missiles were launched and over 7,000 tons of explosives were dropped. About 1000 civilians, including 13 children, were killed and more than 4,500 sustained serious injuries e.g.: - in Kur�umlija: 13 dead and 25 wounded; - in Pan�evo: 2 dead and 4 wounded; - in �a�ak: one dead and 7 wounded; - in Kragujevac: over 120 workers were wounded during an attack on the car factory \"Zastava\"; - in Vranje: two dead and 23 wounded; - in Aleksinac: 12 dead and more than 40 wounded; - in Nagavac village, Orahovac municipality: 11 dead and 5 wounded; - in Pristina: 10 dead and 8 wounded; - Grdelicka gorge: 55 killed and 16 wounded; - attack on two refugee columns, with four cruise missiles, on the Djakovica-Prizren road: 75 killed and 100 wounded, of whom 26 critically; - in the village of Srbica: 10 killed, among whom 7 children; - Belgrade suburb of Batajnica: a three year old girl Milica Rakic was killed, and five civilians wounded. - in Nis: in the attack on housing flats one civilian was killed while 11 wounded; - in Pristina: in the attack on a Provisional Executive Council building in the suburb Grmija, one civilian was killed while 2 wounded; - in Djakovica: in the attack on a refugee settlement housing Serb refugees from the Republika Srpska Krajina (Croatia), 10 refugees were killed and 16 wounded; - in Belgrade: in the attack on the Radio Television of Serbia office building, 15 employees have been killed and 17 wounded; Three million children are endangered in our country as a result of war and bombardment by NATO criminals. After these barbarian attacks hundreds of thousands citizens have been exposed to poisonous gasses which can have a lasting consequences on the health of the entire population and the environment. After the demolition of the Petrovaradin bridge, Novi Sad and Petrovaradin were cut of water supply (600 000 citizens) since the main and city pipeline was constructed into the bridge. About one million citizens in our country are short of water supply due to the bombardment of NATO aggressors. About 500 000 workers became jobless due to the total destruction of industrial facilities all around the country. Two million citizens have no means for living and cannot ensure the minimum for existence. Overall material damage is enormous. Preliminary estimates indicate that barbaric air strikes of the neo-fashist NATO alliance, since the beginning of the unprovoked aggression on the FR of Yugoslavia, on industrial, commercial and civil facilities and structures throughout our peace-loving country, have incurred damages in excess of 10 billion dollars. In the territory of the northern province of Vojvodine alone, damages have been estimated in excess of 3,5 billion dollars.
