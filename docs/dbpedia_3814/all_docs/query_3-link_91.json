        "text": "I am a fan of Channel 292. It is a nice platform for enthusiastic producers to share their view on music across international borders. This weekend I listened to Alt Universe Top 40. A nice show that provides context on a Top 40 chart in a selected year.\n\nJohn McMullan is the man behind Alt Universe Top 40. He was so kind to confirm my reception report with a very nice email. Please check out John on his next show, and send him a report!\n\nAn e QSL for Scandinavian Weekend Radio on 11690 kHz. According to their website this is the first Finnish legal radio station to broadcast on MW and SW. The 100 Watt transmitter is located in Virrat, some 80 kilometers north of Tampere in central Finland. True to their name they broadcast during the weekend on various frequencies.\n\nYou can also get a paper QSL for 5 Euros, 3 USD or 2 valid and properly stamped IRCs.\n\nI received a nice email to QSL my reception of Jazz AM via Channel 292, Rohrbach, Germany, on 9670 kHz. Jazz AM is brought by gbradio.uk. They can be regularly heard on Channel 292, but on occasion use a U-turn construction to broadcast via Woofferton 3955 kHz, as explained in the email from John at Jazz AM:\n\nA bit of background about Jazz A M. gbradio.uk is a very small scale programme producer located in Hampshire UK. I have had a long history of enjoying Jazz dating back to VOA Jazz Hour and the whole evenings of Jazz and events such as Montereux on Europe 1 and France Entire in the 1960’s during the period Jazz really took off in FRANCE.\n\nThe German Government licences Short Wave Broadcaster who can sell airtime at a reasonable rate. Encompas operate the only shortwave broadcast site in the UK. the BBC ,VOA,and overseas Broadcasters buy time but UK citizens can not as you cannot get UK Broadcast Licence for Shortwave. HOWEVER C292 is licenced by the German authorities and has a relay agreement with ENCOMPASS. So I do occasion broadcasts on 3955 kHz at 125 kW.\n\nBest Regards\n\nJohn\n\nFor those interested: this is the schedule for the coming days:\n\nRelay via Woofferton UK\n\n3955 kHz Sunday 18th August 2100 to 2200 UTC 125 kW\n\n10Kw via Germany Channel 292: (10db gain with beam)\n\n9670 kHz Sunday 11th August 1000 to 1100 UTC Beam R\n\n9670 kHz Sunday 11th August 2100 to 2200 UTC Beam R\n\n9670 kHz Sunday 18th August 2100 to 2200 UTC Beam R\n\n9670 kHz Saturday 24th August 2100 to 2200 UTC\n\nA message from Atlantic 2000:\n\nAtlantic 2000 will be on the air this Saturday, 10th of August, from 0800 to 0900 UTC (1000 to 1100 CEST) on 6070 and 9670 kHz via Channel 292.\n\nStreams will be available at the same time here: http://radioatlantic2000.free.fr\n\nReports to: atlantic2000international@gmail.com\n\nBefore that, you can listen to our 24/7 webstream or our podcasts on our website.\n\nGood listening!\n\nVisit our website and listen to Atlantic 2000, 24 hours a day: http://radioatlantic2000.free.fr\n\nAgain with the help of Artur from Maresme DX I received a very nice email and a scan of a QSL letter from Radio Surco, broadcasting from Tomelloso, Spain, on 91.4 FM. I posted a recording of my reception on YouTube. Radio Surco has two transmitter sites: 2 kW on 91.4 MHz, and 1.2 kW on 99.2 MHz:\n\nDear Peter,\n\nThank you for contacting us and receiving news from the Netherlands. This year, at least, we have received three messages like yours, from different locations. We assume that due to the location of our broadcast tower and the very flat area where we are, the waves work their magic and allow us to reach distant places.\n\nWe are a radio station with two broadcasting centers, but according to your instructions, it is Tomelloso’s that you heard. Radio Surco Tomelloso was born in 1986 and is an independent commercial station. Its cover, being a flat land, covers “La Mancha”, an area of the Autonomous Community of Castilla La Mancha to which four of its provinces belong. Tomelloso is in CiudadReal, specifically.\n\nThe emitting center is located at this point\n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/EZCdtXyXT9uYUA6N7\n\nLocation of the Radio station Surco TOMELLOSO\n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/AMhjJvCLcrBaeRet8\n\nThe Radio Surco Tomelloso station is located about 12 kilometers as the crow flies or cross-country\n\nI attach the certificate you are requesting, although we do not have an official model. Thank you for being on the other side and greetings from Spain.\n\nMontserrat Castellanos Cañones\n\nDirectora\n\nA birthday present! Upon return from a nice birthday dinner I noticed that I was receiving Cupid Radio on 6290 kHz on my SDR receiver. Dropped an email to cupidradio@hotmail.com which was read during the show. The next day I wrote a full report which was answered with a personal email and this nice QSL card.\n\nI was told that they were operating on 15105 towards the US earlier that evening. They moved to 6290 kHz when the band closed, and that’s where I found them playing hard rock music like AC/DC and Kiss. The power is 500 Watts generated by two Russian GU81 tubes… and I like that sort of technology as that is the sort of stuff that got me into radio! This YouTube video gives you a good impression about the size of these things!\n\nCupid Radio has a very interesting Facebook page… I encourage you all to check it out! They run SSTV as well, albeit mainly on 13 and 19 m…. I would really like to catch one of those!\n\nWhere would I be with a little help from my friends? I heard Blue Radio Chella on 90.2 MHz, but my report remained unanswered. Artur Fernández Llorella was so kind to help me to get in touch with Alex Selfa, director of the station. Within a day I got a nice email confirmation:\n\nBlue Radio is a local station broadcasting on 90.2 MHz with 2.5 kW power from Chella. Headquarters are in Xátiva, 50 km south of Valencia.\n\nThank you Artur!!!\n\nMy 2nd QSL in the series of 10 NDBs from Serbia was for NDB VTN-468. It serves as navigation aid for Morava Airport near Kraljevo. Verie signer was Mr. Savic from SMATSA, the air traffic services provider for Serbia and Montenegro.\n\nMorava Airport is the third largest airport in Serbia, after Beograd and Nis. The military part of the airport is known as Lađevci Airport . The civilian part was opened in 2006. Apparently it is struggling bit to really grow to its full potential. Currently there are flights to Tivat in Montenegro, Thessaloniki and Istanbul only.\n\nJST on 405 kHz was one of the first more remote NDBs I heard when I resumed DX-in over a year ago. The beacon is located NW of the Niš Airport in Serbia. I was very interested in verifying this beacon, as so far I was not able to verify a radio station from Serbia. All my “Serbian” QSLs date from the Yugoslavia era.\n\nVia Patrick Robic (thank you!) I received the email address of Slavisa Savic, assessor at SMATSA llc, the company responsible for Air Traffic Services in Serbia and Montenegro. He also confirmed my reception of the TVA beacon on 345 kHz from Montenegro and was so kind to do this for the 10 beacons I received from Serbia as well. With the QSL of JST-405 Niš/Justic I have my 196th radio country confirmed!\n\nNis Airport is located in the South East of Serbia. It is the 2nd largest airport in Serbia. The full name is Nis Constantine the Great Airport, name after Roman Emperor Constantine the Great who was born in Niš (named Naissus at the time). Constantine the Great – as you might have learned at school – was the first Roman emperor who converted to Christianity in 312 AD."
