        "text": "This is one of the oldest and, at the same time, one of the most central Belgrade municipalities. Its name is symbolic – the territory of the municipality resembles a wreath that lies along the right shore of the river Sava, thus following its flow.\n\nIrrelevant of where you reside in Belgrade or what you are doing in the city, you cannot possibly bypass Savski venac. All the passengers, either just arriving into the city or departing from it, have to do it precisely from Savski venac, or at least pass through it. Certain parts of it, like the one known as Savamala, represent the first urban fibres of the city or its first residential dwellings.\n\nIn the 19th century, together with the settlements along the Sava river (Savamala) and the Danube (Dorćol), another settlement developed in Topčider, where the first Serbian prince, namely Prince Miloš Obrenović, made his residence. Considering that at the time, this settlement was nowhere near the above mentioned parts of this municipality, it became clear that the city of Belgrade would continue to develop in this direction, including both the villas on Dedinje, as well as some thirty odd embassy buildings located there nowadays, and that one of the first tram lines would eventually be running through there.\n\nAll sorts of things appeared in Belgrade for the very first time precisely on Savski venac, such as, shops, an open-air market, a tavern, a theatre, a hospital, tram lines, the first government department, as well as The Eagle (SOKO), the first soccer club in Serbia.\n\nAnd while on the subject of soccer, let us just mention that the two greatest soccer clubs before WW2, Yugoslavia & BSK (Belgrade Sport Club) were located on Savski venac, to be succeeded by the Red Star (Crvena zvezda) and the Partisan (Partizan) later on, thus remaining in the same location. The Government of the Republic of Serbia is also located on Savski venac, as well as most of the government departments or ministries, numerous government institutions, the heart of the Serbian Railroads (including the first railway station, the museum and the administration building), Belgrade Bus Depot (Autobuska stanica), Belgrade Fair (Beogradski sajam), all of the Belgrade bridges across the Sava, Clinical centre and Emergency Medical Centre (Klinički i Urgentni centar), respectively, the Military Medical Academy (Vojno-medicinska akademija), most of the Belgrade University, each Faculty being in a separate building, the most beautiful of the city parks, as well as the picnic area of Košutnjak, valuable cultural-historical monuments, architectural heritage, the second residency of Prince Miloš in the Topčider park, the Royal Church of St Peter and Paul (Kraljevska crkva Sv. Petra i Pavla), and the monument to Archibald Reiss.\n\nSome of the toponyms of the city that should absolutely not be skipped or avoided, are also on Savski venac, to name but a few, such as, Zeleni venac, Slavija, Sava’s Square and St Nicholas’ Square, Mostarska petlja, Autokomanda…\n\nIn addition to the above, Dedinje, being the most elite part of this municipality, boasts the Palatial compound, dating from the beginning of the twentieth century. It is a complex of residences built for the Karađorđević royal family between 1924 and 1937. Its history bears witness to the events from the first half of the twentieth century to the present day.\n\nThis municipality also boasts one of the most famous streets, not only in Belgrade but also in the whole region. It is the Užička Street where, apart from the prewar villas and residencies of many ambassadors, another significant building is located, namely the compound where the president of ex-Yugoslavia Marshal Josip Broz Tito resided for over half of the century.\n\nThe entrance into the Museum Complex of Yugoslavia, within which the Memorial Centre Josip Broz Tito and the Old Museum are contained, is located in Mihaila Mike Jankovića 6.\n\nSome of the most eminent cultural institutions are also located on Savski venac, for example, the Yugoslav Drama Theatre (Jugoslovensko dramsko pozorište) and the Students’ Cultural Centre (SKC), also some significant institutions, such as The Palace of Justice (Palata pravde), Department of the Treasury (Zavod za izradu novčanica), numerous hotels, famous restaurants and clubs.\n\nPublic transport:\n\nBuses: 59, 78, 37,23, 74, 58\n\nTrolleybuses: 40, 41"
