        "text": "What counts as a city/town?\n\nAny populated place in the world as determined by U.S. government agencies. Neighborhoods within listed cities are not included.\n\nWere does your data come from?\n\nCities for all non-U.S. countries comes from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. US cities data comes from the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Geological Survey. Population data comes from various sources. Population density data comes from the Center for International Earth Science Information Network at Columbia University in partnership with NASA's Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center. We've made a concerted effort to source our data from public domain and permissively-licensed sources that will not restrict the rights of our customers.\n\nHow do you address border conflicts and territorial disputes?\n\nWe simply use the determination of our primary source which is a U.S. government agency.\n\nSince most of this data is in the public-domain, what value are you adding?\n\nWe've spent countless hours: downloading, merging, cleaning, formatting, and aggregating this data into an accurate and concise product.\n\nWhat am I allowed to do if I purchase the Comprehensive Database license?\n\nA license allows you to use the database internally or to query the database for public-facing applications that you or your organization owns or develops. Attribution is not required. You are not allowed to publicly redistribute the database without prior permission. You can make copies of the database for internal and backup purposes. To learn more, read the full license terms.\n\nWhy should I trust this data?\n\nThis database was aggregated from authoritative sources and carefully processed by SimpleMaps. We've been developing and selling interactive maps to Fortune 500 companies and prominent international organizations for over 14 years. Over this time, we've learned a lot about geographic data. Our data products have been used in production by well-regarded organizations such as The Guardian. To get a sense of the expertise, check out some of the testimonials from our happy customers.\n\nHow do I calculate the distance between two cities?\n\nWe've published free formulas in popular programming languages. Check them out.\n\nCan I get the Pro or Comprehensive Database in Excel or SQL server?\n\nThe Comprehensive Database can be downloaded in CSV or SQL (MySQL) format upon purchase. The database has too many rows to fit in a single Excel worksheet, but we can provide the data in Excel format, broken out by country, upon request. We can also provide the data as a .bak file for SQL server. Please contact us to receive the data in one of these formats.\n\nWhat's the fastest way to import the comprehensive database into MySQL?\n\nWe recommend using the CSV file and following our tutorial on importing a CSV into MySQL.\n\nCan I purchase additional updates?\n\nYes. After updates expire, you can purchase 12 more months of updates for $99 (Pro) or $199 (Comprehensive).\n\nWhat is the difference between the Pro and Comprehensive databases?\n\nThe main difference between the two is that the Pro database generally only includes cities and towns that either have a ranking of 1, 2, or 3 while the Comprehensive database includes all cities and towns for which we have data. For most users, the Pro database is sufficient and will be faster to query.\n\nDoes the data include population data for every place in the world?"
