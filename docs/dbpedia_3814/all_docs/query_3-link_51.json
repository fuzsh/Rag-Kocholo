        "text": "by Andrei Neascu in Kraljevo\n\nMilan's tightly closed lips are barely locking a smile his eyes cannot hide. His thin fingers browse the air in gentle curves drawing an imaginary flower. Is it a rose or a tulip? A very fragile flower for sure, judging the way he holds it between his thumb and forefinger as he offers it to his neighbour Gordana. The ten year-old girl accepts the gift and thanks the boy by crossing her hands over her chest and bowing her head.\n\nSeated on tiny chairs in a circle in a Kraljevo school classroom are 15 boys and girls, deeply plunged in a mime play with their adult companions Marina and Savo. As the game ends the large classroom is suddenly filled with happy voices guessing - wrongly or rightly - what kind of present they were offered by their partners.\n\nThere would be nothing particular to report on the scene if it was not a part of one of the joint Serbian and Danish Red Cross workshops for Children Affected by Armed Conflict (CABAC). Marina Ockoljc is a psychologist with a local NGO while Savo Veljkovic is a former school director, now the Red Cross manager of the programme.\n\n\"It takes 15 minutes to play a game but the impact on children is so important. In just a few months of activity I noticed great changes in children's behaviour\", explains Marina.\n\nAmong their behaviour disturbances are lack of attention and concentration at school, aggressiveness towards colleagues and unusual solitude or isolation from the group. All these in children who are otherwise normal.\n\n\"The CABAC programme is not a therapy for mentally disturbed children\", Ulla Nerenst, the Danish Red Cross co-ordinator of the programme, stresses.\"We are not drawing diagnosis on patients. We are dealing with normal children who - unfortunately - went through abnormal situations and experiences. With trained psychologists we help the children accept to live a normal life once the conflicts are over\", she says.\n\nFour wars and ten years of international sanctions and economic hardship in the Balkans affected all layers of Serbian society. In Bosnia, Croatia and later Kosovo, Serbian civilians were confronted with retaliation from the other parts involved in the conflict, witnessed atrocities and were forced into exile. In Kraljevo, the town's population was exposed to almost daily bombing throughout the 11 week NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999.\n\nFor those involved in the war Kraljevo was indeed a military target. The bombing aimed at the multitude of army barracks, the Ladjevci military airport and radars in Samaila and Babsko-Polje. Unfortunately, like elsewhere in Serbia, collateral damage also occurred: one school in the village Bogutovac was totally destroyed while another was partially damaged.\n\n\"During the day and night bombing, whenever the anti-aircraft alarm went on, my 12 year-old son was urinating in his trousers, he was shaking uncontrollably and could not sleep\", recalls Savo Veljkovic. As a school director, Savo was at work every day and describes the air campaign as a terrible and frightening experience the result of which he calls \"a collective trauma\".\n\n\"All of us, adults and children alike, carry a conflict related trauma so the CABAC programme benefits everyone. What we learn through the workshops we naturally apply at home with our own children\", he says.\n\nThe choice of the Danish Red Cross to start the pilot project in Kraljevo is not surprising. With a population slightly over 60,000 this provincial town hosts some 28,000 additional refugees and internally displaced people from Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo. Most of them live, some since more than eight years, in cramped and inadequate conditions - denounced by a Red Cross Red Crescent vulnerability assessment in 2000 - in 20 collective centres scattered around the city. Some of them have been there for more than eight years.\n\nCABAC is implemented in 15 of the Kraljevo's 21 primary schools, most of them located in the neighbourhood of the collective centres or the bombed areas. More than 100 teachers and five psychologists are involved in the programme. They work with 1,800 children between 10 and 13 years of age.\n\nSays Ulla Nerenst: \"Unlike most organisations who are targeting the affected beneficiaries the Red Cross programme seeks to include not exclude children. The workshops are not about competition and notes. They are not about who's the best or more beautiful. They are about involving all, to give children a chance to express themselves in ways other than those appreciated by the scholar system.\"\n\n\"The results are that kids get closer to each other. Some are surprised to realise that they went through similar experiences. Others are moved by situations they haven't been through. Gradually, children release from the trauma and rediscover the pleasure of studying\", says CABAC psychologist Marina Okoljc as she points at a boy who used to refuse to read or write. After only one month of attending the Red Cross workshops, teachers said the boy is taking an active part in the regular school classes.Naively but profoundly, during the drawing sessions, children express their aspirations.\n\n\"In my palm I drew the house I would like to live in, in a peaceful place\", said one child. The hesitant handwriting on the bottom of the colourful drawing hangs on the wall of the classroom as a sort of reminder to any adult that may be blinded by the rage of conflict.\n\nThe programme, which includes three workshops a week throughout the school year and includes a variety of activities such as sport, drawing, painting, music and drama, as well as a a hygiene and nutrition element. Children receive a hygiene kit and together wash their hands before eating sandwiches, fruits and juices.\n\nWorkshops similar to the ones attended by the children are offered to their parents most of whom, besides being equally affected by the years of conflict and the poor living conditions, are long-term unemployed. The eight parent-workshops held so far were also a successful programme evaluation as parents learned from each other about the changes they noticed in their children. The ultimate idea is to bring children and parents together in the same surroundings.\n\nThe CABAC programme was first implemented - with International Federation's support - in 1996 in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the regions of Bihac, Banja Luka and Bosanska Kruga. Since then, it has assisted over 8,700 children. Since 1999, CABAC is operated by Danish Red Cross in Kosovo."
