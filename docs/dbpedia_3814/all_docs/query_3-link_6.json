        "text": "Kraljevo Airport in 2011\n\nKraljevo Airport\n\nAs was reported a month ago, Serbia’s newest international airport will be located in the town of Kraljevo, in central Serbia. The project for Kraljevo Ladjevci Airpot has received much needed financial backing which could see the military airport open for commercial flights by the fall of 2011. The project is being headed by the town of Kraljevo but also by the nearby city of Kragujevac and ten other towns in central Serbia.\n\nThe 22 million Euros needed for the airport’s conversion into a commercial one will be funded by the Government of Serbia and Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport. USAID-MEGA will finance the business strategy plan for the airport along with local municipalities.\n\nAn airport in Kraljevo, in central Serbia, would benefit many. Kraljevo is an industrial town and the need for cargo flights would be welcome. All industrial companies in Kraljevo have expressed their desire for the reconstruction of the airport. Kragujevac is home to the Zastava-Fiat car maker which will be producing new Fiat models in the city next year and a nearby airport would come in handy. Furthermore, Kraljevo is close to the mountain ski resort of Kopaonik which could see seasonal tourists. Ladjevci Airport was heavily bombed during the 1999 NATO air raids with most of the runway and the control tower destroyed."
