Further, as one who voluntarily and unselfishly devoted some of the best years of her life in the same good cause, it is in all esteem and respect dedicated to the memory of Miss Mary Kingsley, and to the African Society that emanated therefrom, the object and motive of which is to advance the glorious cause of civilisation and progress. PREFACE Major A. G. Leonard has all his life been deeply interested in comparative religion, and having paid especial attention to Aryan and Hindu mythology, as well as to natives of parts of Asia and Africa, he had prepared himself for the detailed study of a particular people. The opportunity came when he went to West Africa, and for ten years he patiently studied native life and thought, never losing a chance of getting into touch with the natives, even at the risk of his life, for some of the tribes he visited were not then amenable to British rule. But knowledge acquired elsewhere and opportunity for research are of little avail unless an investigator be endowed with sympathy, the master-key that unlocks all hearts. An inevitable gulf separates the culture and thought of the black man from the culture and thought of the white man, nor is this lessened when the latter acts the part of ruler over the former, for then other considerations come into play, and mis- conception and prejudice accentuate the differences between barbarism and civilisation. From the first, Major Leonard determined to attempt, as far as in him lay, to remove this misconception, but there was only one way to accomplish this effectually, and that was to study the natives first hand and to endeavour to see everything from theii point of view — in other words, to “ think black,” as Miss Kingsley tersely put if. This is by no means easy to do, as it necessitates much physical hardship, prolonged patient inquiry, and an exercise vii h THE LOWER NIGER AND ITS TRIBES viii of tolerance towards weakness, crime, and brutality. Natives are extremely sensitive, and any exhibition of superciliousness or disgust causes them to be most reticent. For an observer to gain their confidence sufficiently to induce them to give expression to their inmost thoughts, their aspirations, and their sacred beliefs, it is necessary to have that charity that thinketh no evil. It should be remembered that it is by the merits of others that we are what we are, and if our forefathers had lived under conditions similar to those that obtain in the Niger delta, it is improbable that we would have been appreciably better than are the present inhabitants of that reeking district. One great merit of Major Leonard’s method of in- vestigation is his appreciation of the fact that the social and religious expression of the Nature-folk is as much the direct result of their environment as is their material culture. No longer is it possible to dissociate religion from geography. Again and again he rightly insists that religion is a natural result of human evolution, having its ultimate sources in pre- human conditions. Eeligion originated as the response of the emotions and dawning intelligence of man to the world around and within him, and as in the past it served to satisfy certain human needs, so it has continued to do : sometimes widening, but at other times narrowing its scope ; in some instances deepening its experience, in others becoming more and more superficial ; occasionally it is stifled by convention and strangled by ritual, only to break away under the guidance of a reformer — the eternal conflict between the priest and the prophet. But the ebb and flow, periods of growth and resting stages, gradual evolution, and departure along new lines of emotion and interpretation, are all ultimately the outcome of the conditions of existence and the interactions of the human environment. Thus no phase of religious development can be understood apart from the social history of the people. The study of religion by itself is as barren PREFACE IX of real significance as is the study of animals formally arranged in a museum, or of plants in a herbarium. Appreciating these facts, Major Leonard made it his business to consult at first hand the great book of nature as it is manifest in Southern Nigeria, and to see the people as they actually are, as they live, as they do, and as they think and speak. The more he looked, and the deeper he studied, the more evident it became to him that never has the European understood the Negro ; and the present volume is his interpretation of Negro thought and expression. Major Leonard draws a vivid picture of the wonderful Niger delta, and he traces its effects upon the mind and nature of its inhabitants, — a country of moisture, marsh, and malaria in the rainy season, but a land baked and parched, with shrivelled foliage, in the dry season ; to this dramatic change between these contrasted seasons the author traces one of the manifold sources of the inherent dualism of native character and social life. Colonel Ellis has proved in a masterly manner the gradual evolution that has taken place from west to east in the religion of the natives of the Guinea Coast, and with this is associated an analogous progress in the laws of descent and succession to property, and in the rise of government. He has also suggested that differences in the physical character of each country in question have played a great part in this progressive evolution. The conditions of existence in the Niger delta appear to be more similar to those that obtain in the country of the Tshi-speaking peoples than those of their more advanced neighbours to the east. The environment of steamy tropical West Africa is very different from that of the dry steppes and scrub of Central Australia, so it is not surprising that there is a marked contrast in social life and religion between Negroes and Australians. The latter have to contend against a niggard earth, and, not being cultivators of the soil, they depend X THE LOWER NIGER AND ITS TRIBES entirely for their sustenance upon collecting and hunting ; but even among these wandering hunters the religious sense is not lacking. The admirable investigations of Messrs. Spencer and Gillen have shown that these social savages have also developed a large number of ceremonies (which we term “ magical ”) for the purpose of the increase of plant and animal life for human food or for the production of rain. Still greater is the difference between West African conditions and those obtaining in the arid deserts of Arizona and New Mexico, and as marked are the ways in which the religious impulse expresses itself among the Pueblo Indians ; perhaps more clearly here than elsewhere is seen the direct influence of physical environment upon religion, where the numerous intricate ceremonies and the rich symbolism are all the expression of the urgent need for the vitalising rain. Major Leonard also emphasises the close relation that exists between the social condition of the people and their religion. The Niger delta natives have simply transferred human conditions to the unseen world. The main idea of the family centres in several grades of persons : (1) The Father or Fertiliser, who holds in his hand the power of life and death ; (2) The Mother, who fills a position of great trust and reverence, as the nourisher and as the producer of the Eldest Son ; (3) The Eldest Son, who has the confidence of both parents and is the mediator between them and the rest of the household ; (4) The Elders of the various branches of the household, who are respected as being counsellors and heads of departments. The evolution of the gods of a community is synchronous with the actual development and expansion of the community itself. The “ primeval adoration of the father in the flesh,” we are told, “ combining, as it subsequently did, with a belief in the existence of the soul or spirit, developed first into the worship of the father in the spirit, and later on into that of certain deified ancestors, which, co-operating with a belief in PREFACE xi the phallic principle, eventually arrived at a worship of the Supreme God, from whom the origin of all life was traced.” The god of each household or town is but the emblem of some former ancestor, and “ it is from and through deified parents and personalities that the communal and departmental gods can be traced ; it was through them that the god-idea arose, and in this way the origin of the human ancestors, connected and associated as they were with the gods, was traced back to the Supreme Generator or Creator.” The importance of the father, mother, and son in the human family has naturally led to the adoration of analogous family gods ; thus there is recognised “ the fatherhood of the governing and fertilising god ; the motherhood of the pro- ducing and nourishing goddess, his co-operator and spouse ; and the son, as the result of their co-operation.” Tor example, among the Ibani, Adum was the father of all gods, who espoused Okoba, the principal goddess and mother of Eberebo, the son-god, a very intelligent, subtle, and brave deity, to whom children are dedicated, who thereby partake of his good qualities, and especially of his courage. In the Ju-Ju houses of every community in the delta the same trio are to be seen under their own local cognomens. Of late years evidence has been accumulating to prove the spirituality of many savage and barbaric peoples. Because the outward symbolism is usually crude, the observer assumed that the ideas that lie behind it are equally elementary and ignoble. The investigator has frequently been ignorant or wrongly trained, almost invariably he has been prejudiced, rarely has he been sympathetic, and, as a consequence, the ideals and aspirations of natives have remained unknown, and, being un- recognised, their existence has been denied. But the more excellent way of certain investigators has demonstrated in this, as in so many other matters, that negative evidence is not evidence of negation ; and we now know that our brethren most backward in material culture are imbued with ethical Xll THE LOWER NIGER AND ITS TRIBES and religious ideas which do not materially differ from those inculcated by the teachers of the religions of civilised peoples. We learn that the religion of the Niger delta natives is based on the adoration of ancestral spirits, materially repre- sented by emblems, the latter being nothing more nor less than convenient forms of embodiment which can be altered or transferred according to circumstances. These objects, rude and senseless as they may be, are regarded as vehicles of spiritual influence, as something sacred because of their direct association with some familiar and powerful spirit, and not as objects which in themselves have, or carry with them, any so- called supernatural powers. It is not the object itself, but what is in the object, that is the power for good or for evil. Hence, though they may venerate the object itself, they do so only because of the spirit which resides in or is associated with it. The object accordingly becomes nothing more nor less than a sacred receptacle, and its holiness is merely a question of association. The thing itself is helpless and powerless ; it cannot do harm, just as it cannot do good ; the spirit, which is invariably ancestral, even when deified, alone does the mischief and wreaks the vengeance in the case of neglect or impiety, or confers the benefits and the blessings when the ancestral rites are performed with due piety by the household. The insignificance of the object is of no con- sequence, nay, rather, the greater is its insignificance, the greater the reflected glory and power of the spirit. This is the essence of fetichism. Worship consists mainly of homage and adoration. It is in the act, in the offering up of a substantial sacrifice, that the efficacy of propitiation lies. In native opinion prayer is of little avail, and what is said must he short and to the point — action is the only remedy. The following is given as a sample of their prayers : “ Preserve our lives, 0 Spirit Father who hast gone before, and make thy house fruitful, so that we, thy children, shall increase, multiply, and so grow rich and PREFACE xiii powerful.” They act on the principle of, “ Do unto your ancestors as you would they should do unto you.” Eeligion, even in a symbolical sense, is not a public or national affair, but entirely a personal and family matter, or, at most, communal. Usually priests act as go-betweens when the petitioners are supposed not to be on good terms with the spirits, since the former, as is their wont, have imposed upon the people their belief that their intervention is necessary to appease the offended spirits. On the other hand, all in- fluential or powerful families dispense with priests, as in these cases the ancestral spirits possess a power that can make itself felt to some purpose, and the head of the house can appeal directly to the household manes. The interrelation of mortals and spirits, deified or other- wise, is seen in the belief that, as human existence is de- pendent on the spiritual essence supplied by the gods, so the existence of the gods depends on the spirit of human and other sacrifices. Even the good spirit of a benevolent chief, unless he is propitiated by his people and pleased with their behaviour towards himself, is quite capable of not only neglecting, but actually of injuring their interests. As are men, so are gods. A. C. HADDON.

The first of these was to get the truth regarding the faith of their ancestors direct from the natives of Southern Nigeria themselves, and, in the second place, to place on record the truth as it was given to me by word of mouth and through personal contact with the people them- selves. Whether or not I have carried out my original intention in its entirety, and whether I have fulfilled the trust which was reposed in me by those who appreciated the sincerity of my efforts, remains, of course, to be seen. But in that deepest and inmost psychology, which aims at disclosing the internal consciousness of the ego, even the ostensible object must have its underlying motive. While not for a moment professing to be a Negrophile, nor yet again a philanthropist, I must admit that my sympathies for these despised and down -trodden people are of the very deepest and sincerest description. So that the principle which moved me and the sentiment that inspired me to action was one of sheer and simple sympathy for a race who, from the beginning until now, have had the misfortune to be tyrannised over by the inevitable and the inexorable in Nature, and who have never had even an opportunity of emerging from the grip of an environment that has arrested development and kept them in the same backward condition of their forefathers. To effect my object, however, it appeared to me that certain primary conditions were as imperative as they were essential, and these, needless to say, were truth and sincerity. i B THE LOWER NIGER AND ITS TRIBES Qualified as I was at the outset, by virtue of a consider- able and varied experience, which had been gathered in other parts of Africa and in the fervid East, it was quite evident to me, on my first contact with these natives of the Niger Delta, that they were altogether misunderstood by the European. Indeed, this knowledge, added to the abject slavislmess of their position, was sufficient stimulus, apart from any personal sympathy, to spur my energies and in- crease my efforts to the utmost, in order to make them understood. For if it is true, as it unquestionably is, that all the crime and misery in the world is fundamentally traceable to ignor- ance, it is equally true that misconception — its first-born — is also in a great measure responsible for a condition of vain and needless offence, therefore of injustice, that would never otherwise exist, were it not for the unmistakable fatherhood of a potential energy, which in the direction of evil — that is of an uneven balance — is greater even than the force of knowledge. Working on these broad lines, which were based absolutely and entirely on the actual and personal experience of touch and action, the book, containing as it does, the religion, i.e. the philosophy of the people, is the result of a systematic course of investigation which extended over a period of ten years, in addition to the knowledge gained by my official work, which was arranged and organised on scientific principles, arid conducted on the spot among the people. The people as they are, how they live, what they do and say, and how they do and say it — the book of Nature in fact — has been the only book which has been consulted by me. For even in those side issues or comparisons, which from the nature of the work are to some extent inevitable, and in which other people, authors, and books are referred to, the references made, although neces- sary, and in some few cases perhaps unavoidable, are merely casual and subsidiary, and in no sense essential to the real and true significance around which they have been centred and woven. Rather have they been made as the general result of a course of reading which has extended over twenty years, and which, although it is in relation to the subject, was not in any aspect INTRODUCTION 3 a deliberate or premeditated study of the peoples, authors, or books in question. My methods of gaining information and of getting into sympathetic touch with the Delta natives may not have been, from an European standpoint at least, either conventional or constitutional, but they were in every sense natural, and, as the result I trust will demonstrate, most effective and satisfactory from the dual aspect of barbarism and civilisation. For in dealing with a natural people with the object of gaining their confidence, so as to dive beneath the outer surface of their shrinking suspiciousness and timorous reserve, into the inner consciousness of their simple yet subtle existence, it is absolutely impossible to do so on the more highly organised and educated lines of any artificial system. But from the native or natural aspect my methods were strictly legitimate, and, what is more, appreciable, because sincere and sympathetic, and as being thoroughly and agreeably in accord with their own native laws and customs, which I had learnt, and, what is more, not been above learning from the people themselves. Reasonably and justifiably so, when the fact alone is taken into consideration, that in no locality in the world does cir- cumstance alter the case more than it does in these torpid and enervating latitudes. So that in dealing with them every contingency had to be met, every fluctuation of opposing interests to be studied, every approach or loophole of offence and defence to be safeguarded, and every change, in fact, in the mental compass of their personal attitude, not merely provided for, but if possible anticipated. But, above all, remember it was my personal inclination, more than any ambition on my part, to master if possible the psychology of these natural people, so as to represent them to the world of civilisation in their own true colours. But this natural method of administration was not my only method. This does not fully and comprehensively ex- plain the secret of my success in getting, as I did, into so close a touch with these people. All through life I have possessed the power of living a life which was positively dual in existence, of having within my own entity the capacity of absolute detachment, from either internal or external surround- 4 THE LOWE A’ NICER AND ITS TRIBES ings, as the case might be. And it was this power that I utilised to its fullest extent when I was in contact with these sons of Nature, which enabled me to meet them, not merely more than half way, but, in reality, on their own ground or dunghill. For as their condition had from the very outset elicited my sympathy, I threw myself heart and soul into their cause ; so much so that I became oblivious to outside matters, and came in time to look at their own customs from their own point of view. And in this way only is it possible for the European to understand the African ; for if he thinks white and writes black, or vice, versa, writes white and thinks black, the result attained is bound to be an abortion, or only a hybrid. The fact of the matter is, that the civilised European has never been able to detach himself from his own very different intellectualities when studying the barbaric environment. Therefore in constituting himself a critic of barbaric methods, he has not in the true spirit of criticism been at all justified in doing so. Eor he has looked at the barbarian, or savage, from his own European standpoint, and in doing so has taken him much too literally, at the same time that he has not given these sons of Nature credit for the intelligence, the morality, and the knowledge which they in reality possess, quite forgetful of the fact that where religion is concerned they are naturally silent, and disinclined to part with any information. Because, in fact, his picture of them, based as it is on erroneous data and deductions, is altogether a mis- conception, inasmuch as it is drawn from a conception that is his own, and in no sense that of the people whom he is attempting to portray. So, unconsciously though it may be, he lends himself to the perpetration of an act of moral injustice, and in this conflicting way defeats his own good purpose in bringing the savage nearer to civilisation. Apart from all other moral considerations this is a serious blunder, for it goes without saying that where misunderstanding prevails between two human units that are unknown to and dissimilar to each other, in their moods and modes of thought, advancement, that is civilisation, is simply impossible. And the cause of this is most painfully apparent. To the ordinary INTRODUCTION 5 English official of mediocrity, possessing little or no individu- ality and a proportionate sense of responsibility, tied up, thwarted, and sealed as he is at every step by red tape, regulations, and sealing-wax, these natural methods do not commend themselves. So that confronted as he is by con- stantly varying circumstances and fluctuating conditions, which are new to him, with the unexpected, that is newer and stranger, thrown in every now and then, it is not in the least astonishing to find that as between the rulers and the ruled, except in rare and exceptional cases, there is no bond of sympathy whatever. And the fault of this, and I say so un- hesitatingly, lies entirely with the Englishman himself, i.e. with his own unlovable personality, more so even than with his cold and calculating methods. An intense egoist, like the Hebrew of old, absorbed in himself and in his own surroundings, which savour principally of the money market, and his own island belongings, the Englishman is unsociable, not to say selfish. Charity — as regards the sentiments and sympathies of feeling - — begins at home with him. His own personal affairs first of all demand his own individual attention, and outside affairs, except in so far as they touch upon his own, come next, and are seen to, on this principle only, and in no sense as possess- ing any individuality or personal interest of their own. Ordinarily calm, deliberate, and even-minded, he differ- entiates between extremes, religion excepted, and arrives at a correct balance or adjustment of them, dispensing justice accordingly with an even hand. But living in a state of constant suppression of the emotions, as Englishmen for centuries have done, what was formerly an education has developed into a tendency, and the modern Englishman is a human machine of suppressed emotions, devoid of outside sympathy, yet believing in the mission of his race, although forgetful of the fact that the greater the race the greater the faults, presumably as well as comparatively. Thus it is that in administering the negroid races he views matters from his own very exalted yet peculiarly insular standpoint, and judges them by his own immaculate standard. Looking at the question from the deepest sense of imperialism, the Mission, it seems to me, if conducted on these lines, 6 THE LOWER NIGER AND ITS TRIBES can never be the success it ought otherwise to be were it administered on a policy of sympathy, with a rational base. There is, in fact, but one road that in dealing with the Oriental or African leads to success, and that road lies first of all through their own ancestral religion and customs, and then through the heart. For rationalism, although it sub- ordinates the emotions to reason, is full of human sympathies of the very highest and most intellectual order. As an educated and one of the best informed Frenchmen of his time, Monsieur Emile Boutmy, in a study of the political psychology of the English people, says : “ The Englishman is less social than men of any other nationality. I mean that he is less conscious of the ties which bind humanity together, his moral formation owes little to his relations with other men, he scarcely troubles himself about what they think, and if he ever considers the matter at all, it makes no difference in his sentiments and actions. In short, the Englishman is, to a large extent, a recluse ; he is more aloof from the world in which he lives and the neighbours whom he elbows than the men of any other nation.” This analysis of Mr. Boutmy’s explains the situation most explicitly and comprehensively, for the Englishman’s peculiarly unsociable and unhappy egoism, due, as it has mainly been, to the insularity of his environment, also to the possibilities and potentialities of his position, is entirely responsible for the existence of that most indispensable deficit of which we have been speaking. But for the present, at all events, enough has been said on this very deplorable and unfortunate circumstance. To conclude, however, not only am I personally and avowedly in sympathy with my subject, but it has been my sincere and strenuous endeavour, in writing these pages, to put the reader in sympathy with it also. But no effort on my part can effect this unless he himself approaches it from that most Catholic standpoint of all, which sees the good and not only the evil that is in everything, that tolerant standpoint which sees eye to eye, and soul to soul, i.c. without bias and partiality, but with sympathy as well as reason, and which recognises in barbarism a lower and undeveloped phase of natural evolution, with the same human instincts as those of civilisation, but in INTRODUCTION 7 no sense a condition of Nature outside or apart from it, — the standpoint, in fact, of the true and sincere humanitarian, who would work to diminish the evils and miseries of those unfortunate sections of humanity which have never had the opportunity to enable them to rise to the sublimer heights that have been attained by the greater expansion and develop- ment of civilisation. SECTION I PART I A GEOGRAPHICAL AND TRADITIONAL OUTLINE CHAPTER I A DESCRIPTION OF THE PHYSICAL FEATURES OF THE COUNTRY Before attempting in any way to arrive at a conclusion, or, speaking more accurately, in the absence of all history to formulate a theory regarding the origin of a medley of tribes so singularly alike in their sociology, yet differing from each other in language and dialect, it is my intention to deal first of all with a geographical description of the whole country, then with the tribes inhabiting the various divisions, and lastly with the local traditions, which unfortunately are not only meagre but more or less confused, therefore, to a great extent, unreliable. The tract of country now known as Southern Nigeria is a delta, formed by the historic river which, rising behind Sierra Leone, flows in a course so erratic as to have baffled the curiosity and the skill of the keenest geographers, ancient and modern. Taking the Lower Niger, from its junction with the Benue at Lokoja, as the handle of a huge gridiron, the body would be represented by the countless streams and creeks which radiate from the main river at a point some 200 miles below the con- fluence and 120 miles from the sea. At this point the river bifurcates into its two principal branches, the one to the east, which empties itself over a shallow bar at Akassa, being called the Nun, and the western branch, that joins the Warri stream, below Burutu, and enters the sea as the Forcados, being known as the Gana-Gana. The actual depth of the body of the grid is 120 miles, 12 THE LOWER NIGER AND ITS TRIBES PART I with a width at its widest part of not more than 270 miles, and a length of handle of 200 miles. Delimited, however, as Nigeria has been by the British Government into two great divisions, the north and the south, with an utter disregard of racial and political considerations, the northern limit of the latter ends at Idah, curtailing the length by some 60 miles. In a total coast- line of 330 miles there are some nineteen rivers — the Benin and the Escravos to the west of the For- cados ; the Bamos, Dodo, Pennington, and Middleton between it and the Nun ; between this and the Cross river the Brass, St. Nicholas, St. Barbara, St. Bartholomew, Sombrero, New Calabar, Bonny, Andoni, Opobo, and Kwa Ibo rivers ; and to the east of the Cross river and running into it, below Duke Town, are the Old Calabar, the Kwa, the Akpayafe, and the Ofa or Ndiani rivers. Between the Kwa Ibo and Benin river there is a connection right through by creek, which extends in reality from the latter right into the lagoon at Lagos, the creeks, however, being small and much obstructed by snags and vegetable growths. The Cross river and its affluents are altogether distinct, forming, as they do, a small and separate delta. The Benin, Opobo or Imo, and Kwa Ibo rivers, although connected with the Niger, are also quite separate streams, and the two latter, which either rise from the same source or very close to one another, I have myself traced up to the near vicinity of Bende. Out of all these rivers, however, only the Forcados, Bonny, and Cross rivers are navigable for large, ocean-going steamers, although vessels with a shallower draught trade regularly in the Nun, Brass, Opobo, Benin, and New Calabar rivers by side creeks. In all of these, factories, belonging principally to the African Association and Miller Bros. & Co., are established at Duke Town and Creek Town in the Old Calabar district ; at Eket on the Kwa Ibo river ; at Opobo and Egwanga in the Opobo district ; at Bonny in the district bearing that name ; at Bakana, Bugama, and Abonama in the Degama or New Calabar district ; at Brass on the Brass river ; at Akassa on the Nun ; at Burutu on the Forcados ; at Warri on the Warri chap, i THE PHYSICAL FEATURES OF THE COUNTRY 13 river, at the mouth of the Benin river, and at Sapele, 50 miles higher up ; while the Niger Company have factories all the way up the Niger, from Burutu and Akassa, right on into Northern Nigeria. Guarding the entrance to each river is the inevitable sandbar, which decides irrevocably the utility or otherwise of the streams over which it presides, like an evil genius, and in every instance where the decision has been favourable, flourish- ing towns belonging to the middleman, i.e. those who trade between the white traders and the native producers, and extensive, well-stocked factories which carry on an excellent trade, chiefly in palm oil and kernels, in English goods — chiefly gin, tobacco, cottons, hardware, — are an absolute certainty. But as it is not in this direction that the interest of this work lies, I will now proceed to give as good a description as I can of what the country in general is like, so that the reader may form a tolerably accurate idea of the environment by which the people are surrounded, in order to enable him to arrive at a still more faithful conception of their ordinary characteristics, as well as of their special idiosyncrasies. Let the reader imagine a network of waterways, a huge web of mud and water, shaded by the stately but never-changing evergreen mangrove, through which the muddy waters of the Niger, like a main artery, flow, with a swish and a swirl, over the treacherous sandbars into the foam-covered breakers of the grey Atlantic. But it is not possible for any picture, whether drawn by the hand or conjured by the mind, to portray the painful monotony of the mangrove which Nature has smirched in her dullest green, the muddy dinginess of the grey-brown turgid waters, the foetid evil -smelling swamps of slime and ooze, reeking with malaria and with a life that is repulsive, and strangely suggestive of its surroundings : — the loathsome churchyard crabs, recalling hideous memories ; the slimy mud- fish, linking the prehistoric past with the ever -advancing present ; the crafty crocodiles sunning themselves on snags and sandbanks, the huge, ungainly hippos, the hideous iguanas, and the gorgeously painted pythons lurking in the forests for 14 THE LOWER NIGER AND ITS TRIBES PART I unwary victims ; the presuming mangrove flies, who have the audacity to deposit their larvae beneath the human skin, the pestilential sand-flies, and the equally pestiferous mosquitoes, the harmless culex and the much-discussed anopheles, with their fever germs — all of them much too ubiquitous ; and last of all the organ-grinding crickets and the musical frogs, whose chorus at nights, when the bush is lit up by the fireflies in their myriads, adds to the liveliness and gives a distinct solidity to the hum of the insect life which simply teems all round one. These, which are some of the living realities of the Delta, are as a rule to be seen, and without fail to be felt, but regard- ing the picturesqueness of the one and the intensity of the other, I must again refer to the imagination ; but even those readers who possess unusually daring and fertile powers will fail to realise them as they actually exist. This mangrove swamp, however, is merely a belt, averaging 30 miles in width from the sea inland, and extending from one extremity of the Protectorate to the other ; but even within this belt are numerous tracts of good but low-lying laud. At this point inland the mangrove disappears altogether, and the waterways are defined by low banks of solid ground, draped in the luxuriant foliage of various tints and graced by splendid trees of different kinds. Prominent among other varieties, and nearly always denot- ing the presence of farms and towns, are the plantains and palms — “ oil ” and “ wine ” chiefly, — the towering cotton tree, the African oak, iroko, sasswood, mahogany, and a kind of teak, which, with their different shades of green and the occasional colouring of certain flowers — -the bright red of the cotton trees, a crimson blossom like that of mountain ash, and the ordinary convolvulus being among the commonest, — blend into a beautiful harmony. From this point, too, the mainland virtually commences, and as one walks away from the Niger into the interior, either to east or west, it rises very gradually and with a gentle slope up to an elevation of about 20 O', that covers a width of some 70 miles. Then the country assumes a broken and undulating aspect, which in the locality of Bende, to the east, and Uromi, chap, i THE PHYSICAL FEATURES OF THE COUNTRY *5 westward, swells into hills that north of Idah rise to the dignity of mountains. Looking at Southern Nigeria from a purely geographical standpoint, it is naturally divided by the Niger into two distinct sections, the eastern and the western. Both these divisions, as far as can be estimated, are populous, while the country, a very considerable area of which I have walked over, is, as I will point out later on, undoubtedly rich in natural and economic products. It is well intersected by numerous rivers and streams in the eastern division, flow- ing either towards and into the Cross river or the Niger, and in the western running to east and west in the same way — a more or less practical demonstration of the existence of a watershed midway in each division. Most of these streams are fringed by swamps on both banks, varying in width from a hundred yards to a mile, according to the size of the stream. From whatever point of view it may be looked at, whether from the practical standard of navigation or from the less useful but more ornamental one of artistic effect, the Niger, to be understood and appreciated, must be seen in two distinct phases, which it has to undergo within the year : during the dry season, for instance, when the river is at its lowest and sandbanks and islands appear everywhere, making the naviga- tion ever so much more intricate and difficult ; and in the rainy season, when it is at its highest, rising from 40' to 60' in different localities, until it overflows its banks below Onitsha, where the country on both sides is flat. These inundations, according to native reckoning — in other words, experience, — are unusually high every seventh year. Then the riverside towns are swamped, and the people sit on raised platforms inside their huts, paddling from one to the other in canoes, and in no way annoyed by the vagaries or rude attentions of the river god. For they are essentially fatalists, believing firmly in the principle that the evil which cannot be prevented or cured has to be endured with patience, and as their ancestors lived on the river bank and faced the swollen floods, they feel bound to do the same thing. So they are patient to a degree, neither thwarting nor offending the i6 THE LOWER NIGER AND ITS TRIBES PART I demons of the devastating waters, although in the interior the people invariably desert their homes when smitten by disease. But if the river, averaging 1000 yards in width — a width that in places increases to 2000 yards and over, — is, from a spectacular aspect, an interesting sight in the dry season ; with its grass-clad islands and hanks, it is most certainly a splendid spectacle in the rains, as it rushes down from Lokoja to Onitsha, a mighty muddy torrent, so far kept in bounds by the greater elevation of the country ; but below this point pouring over the unprotected banks, and spreading itself all over the low-lying swamps and into the countless creeks of its still lower delta. A scene in every way worth seeing, although, when considered from the practical standpoint of utility, it is sad to see so much power and so many possibilities running year by year to sheer waste. The villages and towns, all throughout the whole Protec- torate, are very numerous, while isolated homesteads are unknown, except occasionally, on farms and plantations ; but there are no cities of any great size or importance, certainly not one that can be compared to Ilorin or Abeokuto in the country behind Lagos, or to Bida, Sokoto, and Kano in Northern Nigeria ; for even Benin city, previous to its capture, was neither extensive nor populous, and certainly of no importance from either a civilised or architectural standpoint. CHAPTER II A CLASSIFICATION OF THE PRINCIPAL TRIBES It will be absolutely impossible for me, so numerous are the tribes and clans in Southern Nigeria, to do more than describe the largest and most important. Going from east to west, and beginning with the Old Calabar district, we have the Efik, an offshoot of the Ibibio, who occupy the country from the mouth of the Cross river 60 miles up to Itu, with Duke Town their capital and the headquarters of the Southern Nigerian Administration, a large and prosperous town of over 20,000 inhabitants. To the east of Old Calabar are the Akwa, generally known as Kwa, living on the Akwa and Akpayafe rivers ; to the north-east are the Ekoi, practically the same as the Akwa ; northward, on the east bank of the Cross river, are the Uwet, Okoyong, and Union tribes ; while on the east bank, above Itu, are various sections of the Ibo race, chief of whom are the Aro, who were until quite recently so celebrated for having in their possession the great and supreme divinity of the universe. Between the Cross and Opobo rivers, to a distance of 60 miles from the coast, is the Ibibio country ; while at the mouth of the Kwa Ibo river are the Ibeno, a miserable mixture of the Ibibio and the Efik ; and along the coast, up to the Opobo river, are a few more Kwa settlements. At Opobo is a colony of the Bonny or Ibani 1 people, who many years ago left Bonny and settled there. The town, con- 1 The vowel U is more frequently used than not in the use of this word Ibani, but either vowel can be used. i7 C i8 THE LOWER NIGER AND ITS TRIBES PART 1 taining some 15,000 inhabitants, is on the right bank of the river, two miles from the bar ; and the people, who are keen traders, trade in all the Ibo and Ibibio markets, some 60 miles up the Opobo and Ivwa Ibo rivers. From Opobo to Bonny, along the coast, are the Andoni, a small tribe of fishermen said to be connected with the Kwa ; and between them and the Ibo to the north, another small tribe called Ogoni are wedged in. Bonny, corrupted from Ibani, is a town on an island at the mouth of its own river ; but its glory and trade have long since departed, although, with the exception of the Cross river, it forms, after Forcados, quite the best and safest harbour in the Protectorate. Twenty-five miles up the Bonny river is a small tract of country inhabited by the Okrika, one half of whom are fishermen and the other half traders. To the north-west of them is the habitat of the New Calabar people, a pushing and a progressive tribe, who have their principal town at Abonama, 30 miles from the mouth of the Sombrero river ; north-west of the New Calabar district, up the Engenni or Oratshi river, are the Abua and Ekpafia. Westward of Bonny live the Brassmen, fine traders, whose chief town, Nembe, is also situated at a distance of 30 miles from the sea. North of Nembe, and between it and the Engenni, also towards the Niger, a small tribe called the Ogbayan are settled. The Oru occupy the tract of country on each side of the Nun branch of the Niger, and along the coastline between it and the Ramos river. Then, in the triangle formed by the Nun and G-ana-Gana, also outside it, to a small extent, both eastward and westward, dwell the I jo, the most important tribe in the lower Delta, and indeed, after the Ibo, in the whole of Southern Nigeria. On the Warri and Benin rivers we find the Jekri middle- men, who are not only the most intelligent and tractable, but quite the best mannered of all the tribes. To the north of the Jekri are the Sobo, and to the east- ward are the Igabo — shy and timid, no doubt, but treacherous chap, ii A CLASSIFICATION OF THE PRINCIPAL TRIBES 19 and rude ; while to the west are the Bini, belonging to what was once the ancient and powerful kingdom of Ubini or Bini, i.e. Benin. Proceeding up the main river, we find at first a mixture of Ijo, Igabo, and Ibo, as far as Abo, i.e. about 135 miles from the sea, and from this point pure Ibo up to Asaba ; then a mixture on the east bank of Ibo and Bini as far as Illushi, or at least from where the Kukuruku country commences, and on the west bank up to the boundary of the Igara or Igala, who at one time owned a large and extensive kingdom, which has recently, however, very much dwindled both in size and importance. But as this work principally concerns only the Ibo and other tribes already mentioned, further detail regarding any of the more northern tribes, such as the Kukuruku, will be quite unnecessary. Lastly, but first in importance — not only numerically, but politically — are the Igbo or Ibo, occupying the heart of Southern Nigeria, i.e. the country between the Niger and Cross rivers, extending to the south within 60 miles of the seaboard, and to the north along the Cross river as far as the sixth parallel of latitude and up to the seventh degree in the direction of the Niger. Going westward, and crossing over the Niger from Abo on the right bank up to and beyond Asaba, we find the Ibo in occupation of a narrow strip of country that is bordered on the west by the Igabo and Sobo country, and on the north by the Kukuruku ; and although it is difficult to speak with any certainty, I think it more than probable that some of the tribes to the east of the Cross river are merely sections of the Ibo race, or are at all events of Ibo origin. CHAPTER III TRADITIONS Among a people whose intelligence has not risen to the height of caligraphy, it is needless to say that no record, therefore no history, exists ; while even tradition, relying solely on the mental effort of memory, is but a meagre and at times a not too reliable record of the past — a past that as a rule, except in the case of some very special event, such for instance as a migration from one locality to another or the invasion and occupation of territory belonging to a different tribe, does not go back for more than fifteen to twenty generations, or from three to four hundred years at the most. This, at all events, is the position of affairs as they exist in the Niger Delta, and is not to be attributed so much to the difficulty of obtaining information as to the fact that the old, old traditions have long, long ago been forgotten. It is not in the least surprising, therefore, that there is an utter absence of all mythology amongst these natives, so that, with the exception of the myth relative to the creation of the two primary brothers, the elder of whom was black and the younger white, which is more or less common to all negroid tribes ( vide Section III.), there are no others — certainly none that it was my good fortune to hear of. Yet in their folklore, or rather beast fables, which deal principally, almost entirely, with the animal world, and also in their deities, it is possible to trace the sole surviving relic of a very ancient mythology. Commencing with the Efik, now officially and commercially known as the Old Calabar people, it appears that in the early 20 CHAP. Ill TRADITIONS 21 part of the eighteenth century they were a community of the Ibibio tribe, living close to but on the west side of the Cross river. Driven by the other Ibibio, or because of local pressure of some kind, they abandoned their old homesteads, and crossing over the Cross and Old Calabar rivers, established a new settlement on the east bank of the latter river. A few years later a further division took place, and the “ Eyo ” portion of the community, attracted by the slave trade that was then being carried on by European vessels, descended the river and founded Ikorri-tungo, now known as Creek Town, from its position on a creek which runs off the main stream. But amid the wealth and prosperity which trade brought the canker of dissension soon arose, so that after much bicker- ing and strife, which resulted in an open quarrel, the weaker party, consisting of several households, were expelled, and proceeding only a few miles farther down the main river they settled at Obuton or Old Town. The immense advantage of this position, cutting off the Creek Town community as it did from the European shipping, soon made itself apparent. But the latter, stronger as they were, were not to be outdone. A colony was soon established by them on the eastern bank of the river, a couple of miles below Obuton, on the slope of the rising ground that falls away into the belt of mangrove swamp to the south of it. The site so admirably chosen, named Akwa-Akpa, i.e. “ New Town,” now called Duke Town or Old Calabar, was so advantageous in every way, absolutely commanding as it did that portion of the river which the European vessels selected for anchorage, that it succeeded in attracting many families who took up their residence there, so much so that in a few years’ time Akwa-Akpa had grown more extensive and powerful than either Creek Town or Obuton. Thus the people of this latter place, now quite hemmed in, found it difficult to go either up or down the river in any safety ; but, making a gallant struggle for existence, they held their own for years, until one day treachery laid them low. Invited on some occasion to a friendly conference on board an English ship, the chiefs of New Town waylaid and massacred 22 THE LOWER NIGER AND ITS TRIBES PART I them, and in this way they secured practically the whole of the foreign trade. Under Efium, in the beginning of the eighteenth century, New Town was pre-eminently prosperous. A strong personality and a powerful ruler, he made his power felt both up and down the river, and as far as to its mouth in the latter direc- tion. Further than this, he enacted laws by which the persons and ships of white men were rendered secure in the country under penalty of death. Yet, fearing aggression from the white men, he guarded strictly against their establishing factories or settlements of any kind on shore. It was this same Efium, christened Duke Ephraim by one of the masters of the English vessels, who gave to the town its present name. There is little more to tell, except that as Duke Town grew in importance Creek Town diminished, and that while prior to the British administration of the country the latter had as rulers eight kings — all of the house of Eyo Honesty — the former has had several Duke Ephraims and an Eyamba or two. Passing over the Akwa and the Ibibio, a wild and truculent race about whom nothing is known and from whom it was impossible to obtain any information, it is possible among the Bonny and Opobo people — the original Ibani — to go back even farther than in the case of the Efik, to about three or four hundred years. There seems to be some difference of opinion, however, as to their origin. One tradition of the elders is that the Ibani are derived from the Ngwa section of the Ibo race, one Alagba-n-ye, a hunter, having, it is said, come down the Azumini Creek on a him ting expedition, and settled finally with his family on Breaker Island — not the one now in existence, but another that lay more towards the eastern side of the river, beyond Ju Ju Town Creek. The original name given to the first settlement, which was only a small town, was Okuloma (called Okuloba by the Brassmen), so christened after the “okulo ” or curlews who inhabited the island in large numbers. Another version has it that the original Ibo settler was one Opobo or Ogulu, who intermarried with a woman from a CHAP. Ill TRADITIONS 23 country to the west of New Calabar ; but as this could only have occurred about 140 years ago it is much too recent, con- sidering the fact that since the sixteenth century down to 1832 Bonny was in reality probably the greatest slave mart of West Africa. Barbot, in his Voyage to New Calabar, 1699, speaks of it as Culebo, and of the king and his brother Pepprell, evidently referring to Perekule, who afterwards was called King Pepper, or Pepple, because of his trading in this article with the Europeans. Yet strangely enough, according to my informants, there is one point on which the Bonny people seem to be fairly well agreed, and that is the relationship existing between them- selves and the Brassmen. According to this tradition, they have at all events always been on the very closest terms of friendship with and have never made war on each other ; and this they attribute to the fact that their gods are in some remote ancestral or spiritual way derived from the same stock — Ogidiga, the Brass, and Ekiba, the Bonny god, having been somehow related in spiritland. Both these deities, so the old people say, were gods of war who a long time ago mutually arranged to go out into the world, each one to choose a separate country for himself, for the purpose of creating war ; so they parted, and it happened that Ogidiga went to Brass and Ekiba to Bonny. The real fact of the matter, however, after a careful analysis of all the facts, is that the connection was originally one of blood brotherhood, which was no doubt cemented all the closer by marriage ties. Still, it is of course possible that some of the original Bini following of Alepe may have left Nembe and thrown in their lot with the Ibani, and this idea is to some extent supported by the fact that even at the beginning of the nineteenth century the latter acknowledged the suzerainty of the King of Benin, and despatched envoys to that city annually to tender their allegiance to him ; although, of course, it is quite possible that the tribute in question was one of religious supremacy and not of heredity. Leaving this for future comment, an examination of the pedigree of the Ibani royal family {vide p. 47) is tolerably strong evidence in favour of the assertion that Alagba-n-ye 24 THE LOWER NIGER AND ITS TRIBES PART I was its rightful founder ; but, as we shall see later on, another foreign element must have been introduced. Beyond the fact of the division which occurred, that ended in the separation of Opobo from Bonny, there is nothing of any further interest in the Ibani traditions. This separation occurred as follows : — After King Perekule’s death, his sons Foubra and Opobo reigned together. As the former, who was the elder, died without leaving a son, the head slave Ibmani took charge of the house. At the time Bonny happened to be at war with New Calabar, Okrika, and Andoni. Taking each in turn, com- mencing with the latter, Opobo subdued them all, and not long after he followed his brother into the land of shadows, leaving behind him an only son, Dappa by name. This youth, being a minor at the time, was, in accordance with the laws of the country, placed iinder the authority of Mmadu, who, although a slave, was, as in the case of Ibmani, also placed in charge of the household. The fact that two slaves were at the head of affairs seemed to a certain extent to have displeased the other chiefs, and, a disagreement having taken place over some question of domestic economy, Mmadu withdrew the whole of his late master’s household eastward across the Andoni flats to the Imo river, where he founded the settlement now known as Opobo. All the Okrika know, or will tell of themselves, is that their forefathers originally came to Okrika from Afam, a place beyond Obu-akpu in the interior Ibo country, which points to, if it does not determine, an Ibo origin ; and the fact of their close contact with the Ibani on one side, and to a lesser degree with the New Calabar on the other, at once accounts for their dialect being affiliated to both of these as well as to the Ijo. Of the Ogoni, all that my agents and myself were able to find out was that one Ogbe-saku, who was the first founder and king, lived in a town called Joko, which is situated in about the centre of the southern half of the country. By this ruler the latter was divided into four sections or districts, which were named after the principal towns, viz. Joko, CHAP. Ill TRADITIONS 25 We-o, Bewa, and Boam ; the first of these being the capital of the N’galabia Ogoni, the second of the Gogara branch, the third of the Bewa, and the fourth of the Boam ; the people of the last-mentioned locality being derived from Joko, while those of the We-o and Bewa are related. Including the chief towns, there are some seventeen communities in all ; but of the northern portion I was unfortunately unable to get any further information beyond the fact that the Ogoni are con- sidered by the Ibani to be treacherous and excitable, and, in these respects especially, similar to the Ibibio in temperament and character. Unlike them, however, they are bad farmers and traders, and have the reputation of being the dirtiest people as well as the greatest cannibals in the Delta. With regard to New Calabar, tradition is not only meagre but again at variance, and it is difficult at first either to reconcile or account for the differences except from the broad basis of tribal union or mingled origins. One version maintains that the New Calabar people are an offshoot of the Efik from Old Calabar, from whom they divided themselves because of civil war. Driven out of their town, they took refuge, it is said, in the Ibo country, and were conducted by some Aro down to the locality lying between Isokpo Market and Bugama. Here it was that, during one of their fishing excursions towards the sea, they fell in with a Portuguese ship at the entrance of the channel now known as the New Calabar river. The captain of the vessel having made an offer to trade with them, they were so pleased at the idea that they left Isokpo and formed a settlement on the right bank of the river close to its mouth, which resulted in a large slave trade being carried on between them and the Portuguese or Spaniards. According to the New Calabar section, who now live at Bakana, a portion of their tribe at all events originated from the Ijo ; and the tradition is that formerly when the people of a town or community went hunting it was customary to make an equal division of all the game that had been killed. On one occasion, however, the division appears to have been carried out unequally, or at all events in such a way as to 26 THE LOWER NIGER AND ITS TRIBES PART I have caused serious dissension — so much so, in fact, that the community in question split up into at least three sections, one migrating to Brass, another to Okrika and Bonny, and the third combining with the original or at least the then existing inhabitants of New Calabar and Kulu. There is something more substantial to go upon concerning Brass. Here one tradition is that a man, by name Alepe, presumably a chief, and a Bini, of Benin City, left there to go on a fishing tour accompanied by his family, and after roving about the creeks and rivers of that part of the Delta lying between the Benin and Brass rivers, he settled down on the small tract of land now known as Nembe, but formerly called Alepe after its founder. Another, and evidently a more reliable version, states that a long time ago there was a great king of Benin who sent his people to war. His eldest son, anxious to go, requested that he might be allowed to join the expedition, but was refused. In spite of this, however, the son managed to get away from Benin, attached himself to the force, and, as it appeared, was the first man killed after the fighting had begun. Bearing the consequences would be disastrous to them- selves, a general consultation was held among the leaders of the expedition, and at the suggestion of Alepe, the commander, it was agreed that the whole party should migrate to other parts and found a place for themselves, which was immediately acted upon ; and there can be little doubt that in choosing the site they did so because of the security of its position. In support of this tradition it is well known that formerly, and indeed until quite recently, it was customary on the death of the Bini king for certain of the Brass notables to be present in Benin City to vote in the election of the new king as well as to take part in the coronation ceremonies. Here, in course of time, Alepe was joined by a certain number of people from Ekulema in the New Calabar district, a place that, according to the tradition of the families who originally came from there, is also referred to as having supplied the original inhabitants of the present Brass. Subsequent to this a further reinforcement was received in the form of a band of Ijo from Obiama. Pirates and CHAP. Ill TRADITIONS 27 desperadoes of the very worst description, these people had been the scourge of the whole neighbourhood in which they had lived, and the inhabitants, no longer able to tolerate their depredations, had combined and driven them out of their town. This is one account ; but another version, naturally enough from those who have descended from the Obiama section, maintains that the real cause or origin of the war was a quarrel over some venison. This tradition, however, is common to so many localities, particularly in this portion of the Delta, that it makes the unravelling of the original knot all the more difficult ; for again a precisely similar story also prevails among the original inhabitants of Degama, who, although outnumbered by the New Calabar people, and a degenerate lot, still cling to the same locality and maintain a miserable existence by fishing. In one sense, these various traditions, identical as they are in substance, would altogether simplify this complex question of origin, that is, if we were prepared to accept them as originating from the same source. This, however, is scarcely possible, so difficult is it to arrive at any authentic basis as to the story being purely traditional or merely mythical. Still, for all that, it would point to the possibility of a common origin at some remote period, which is partially corroborated by the existing affinity of their dialects, and entirely so by the identity of their sociology. Three different tribal elements then, it will be seen, have combined together in the formation of the Brass tribe, and it is interesting to notice that while the religion — and the tribal god more particularly — has remained Bini, the language now in general use is that of the Ijo. From the former circumstance there is little room for doubt regarding the true origin of Alepe, while from the latter the evidence of the domination of the Bini and New Calabar elements by the Ijo is equally convincing, and, due as it undoubtedly was to inter- marriage, the extinction of two languages, and the adoption of a third language entirely different from them both, seemed to the most intelligent of my Brass informants an altogether in- explicable matter ; but it is not quite so inscrutable as it appears, for, as I will endeavour to show later on, it was not so much a case of adoption, as of absorption, which 28 THE LOWER NIGER AND ITS TRIBES PART I was all the more enhanced through social and commercial intercourse. Nembe, low lying, marshy, and absolutely surrounded by a network of creeks and mangrove swamps, is, from barbaric considerations of secrecy, safety, and convenience, splendidly situated, commanding the head-waters of various waterways. In regarding the network as a spider’s web, Nembe is the centre, from which ever so many large channels radiate in all directions, southward to the Brass and St. Nicholas rivers, eastwards to the Nun branch of the Niger, northwards towards the main river itself and the Engenni, a fine stream connecting this with the Degama river, and westward towards the Santa Barbara, St. Bartholomew, and the Sombrero rivers. So that a more ideal spot for a pirate or a slaver — in both of which occupations Alepe and his immediate descendants no doubt engaged — cannot be well conceived. For it was not only skilfully concealed, but easily defended, as it commanded the heads of the converging creeks, which, in case of necessity or defeat, could be utilised as so many ready-made lines of retreat. Of the Jekri also there is much more definite, although to a certain extent contradictory, evidence. According to one account they are said to have been closely connected with the Yoruba, the Warri kingdom having extended to and embraced Lagos as well as some of the surrounding territory. To this day, in fact, Jekri inhabit the strip of country stretching along the coast from the Benin river westward to Lagos. Another and undoubtedly the true version, in spite of the fact that their language is cognate with Yoruba, affirms them to have been derived from the Bini, although now, on the eastern side especially, their blood has mingled very much with that of the Soho, Igabo, and, in a lesser degree, the Ijo. According to native tradition, Lagos, or Eko, as it is called by the natives, was originally founded by a Bini army, who had in the first instance been despatched by the King of Benin to collect tribute from his refractory vassals at “ Ogulata,” a place to the north of the island on which the present town is situated. Having failed in his mission, the commander, fearing to return, settled on the island with his warriors, and, in spite CHAP. Ill TRADITIONS 29 of the pardon that was promised and the hopes which were held out to them, they steadily refused to return to Benin. Subsequently, however, they and the Ogulata people — with whom, through intermarriage and other social relations, they were on good terms — acknowledged the suzerainty of the Bini monarch, and became incorporated into a dependency that paid an annual tribute. In this way the name given to the islet and the settlement on it by these warrior settlers was Aonin or Awani1 — afterwards corrupted to Oni by European traders — as showing its connection with Benin City, and the stock from which they were descended. Conflicting as this may appear, it is not in reality so contradictory, when the fact is taken into consideration that in olden times the Benin empire, quite apart from its numerous dependencies, was divided into two separate states — Benin proper and Warri. This, it seems, had been a purely amicable division that had occurred through the excessive growth of the royal family, by which an arrangement had been effected that provided for the removal of the younger branch to the latter place as a tributary vassal to the elder. And from all accounts it is more than possible, if not evident, that the army of warriors who founded Lagos proceeded in reality from Warri, but doubtless by command of the King of Benin. It is also a matter of certainty that many of these outlying dependencies or tributaries of the parent kingdom were established in exactly the same manner as Brass and Lagos : as a result, in the first place, of the failure of some specific mission, carrying with it the fear of retributive consequences ; and, in the second, the natural desire for personal independence, and to shake off the oppression of a yoke which threatened to consign their spiritual existence to an eternal doom of disembodiment. That Warri is the same locality which Barbot and other travellers or writers allude to under various cognomens — among others, Awerri and Oveiro — is quite certain ; also the fact that the chief town of the kingdom to which it belonged was Aoni or Awini,1 i.e. descended from Ini or Bini. Indeed, until quite 1 This, as being traditional, cannot be given as final, for both pronunciations are quoted by the natives. THE LOWER NIGER AND ITS TRIBES PART I 30 recently — and even now among the natives themselves — the Jekri were certainly known to the Abo as Iwini, and to the Brassmen as Senama ; and, notwithstanding the fact that during modern times Warri has been practically independent, prior to the destruction of Benin City by the English in 1897 the reigning prince and chiefs always paid tribute and acknowledged the supremacy of the elder branch — a fact which speaks for itself. Similarly, it is unquestionable that the Oedo of Barbot and the older authors was the Idu of the Niger and surround- ing natives, and the Benin City of the English ; for not only is this confirmed by tradition, but the name is still in use at the present day among the Abo tribe, as well as among the Ibo of the Lower Niger, between Abo and Idah. Coming now to the Ijo, we are more than ever confronted with a lack of traditional material, which converts a difficult matter into a task that is well-nigh impracticable. Wild, unruly, and practically inaccessible ; divided, too, into many different clans and sections, isolated from each other and speaking several dialects, it was absolutely impossible to obtain information that was either reliable or authentic. So that it was only possible by means of other local traditions and cer- tain lingual affinities to trace the connection that at one time un- doubtedly must have existed between them and the Bini ; and in this way it is tolerably evident that they first of all originated from the latter, and then, after breaking away from them, remained under the suzerainty of their king. But it is also manifest that as time went on, and synchronously with the dwindling power of the parent monarchy, this connection loosened and lessened gradually until it ceased to exist, except perhaps in a mere nominal and certainly in a religious sense ; although even in this latter direction it is quite certain that the oracle of the Aro Chuku was more often appealed to than that of the once far-famed and paramount Benin. That Benin, as the capital of a once famous kingdom, was first discovered by the Portuguese under Affonso de Arrio in 1485, and sixty-eight years later visited by Captain Thomas Wyndham, an English seaman, are facts that have long since passed into history. Ages prior to this comparatively modern chap. Ill TRADITIONS 3i date, however, it is only reasonable to conjecture that this kingdom, which even in its diminished state was powerful, had at one time formed a mighty and extensive empire that covered in all directions a great area. For the origin of the Bini, unlike the more civilised races of Chaldea, Assyria, and Egypt, who have left behind them records and memorials that are practically imperishable, must ever remain enshrouded in mystery. Yet it is just possible, when curiosity is healthy and directed in the right channel, for speculation to arrive at or near the truth — a contingency that it is hoped may have occurred in this particular instance. But if the problem that so far has engaged our attention has been extremely intricate, that which concerns the origin of the Ibo is still more so, for it is a very maze within a maze. Here, except from a philological aspect, we are face to face with an evolution which is practically interminable, for certain important complexities have to be taken into con- sideration. These people form a tribe, but in no sense a nation, with a population numbering anything between five and six millions, scattered over a large area, and divided into numerous clans speaking different dialects, and split up again into in- numerable communities, which not only hold aloof from but are inimical to each other, as if belonging to entirely separate nationalities, so that the absolute hopelessness of finding a clue or of tracing any connected associations to a common source has no doubt become apparent — all the more so in the face of a country that was unfortunately disturbed in many portions and unsettled throughout, with a population who were in con- sequence either unfriendly or at least suspicious. By way of illustration, a few instances of local traditions selected at random will in every way substantiate all that has been advanced with regard to the insuperable difficulties that, in this specific direction more particularly, it was my lot to contend against. Commencing with Ohumbele, a large town of the Ndoki clan, situated on a small creek that runs into the Imo river some 50 miles from the mouth, all that the old people would or could tell me was this. In the time of their fathers who 32 I HE LOWER NIGER AND ITS TRIBES PART I lived before those fathers whom they could remember, a hunter, by name Ebele, was the progenitor to whom they all owed their origin. Where he himself came from they were not able to say. All they knew was that he was first of all living at Ohanko, a town about 8 miles to the north of Ohumbele. In those days it happened that there were two towns, by name Intsina and Eberu— presumably to the south, — the inhabitants of which, who were at war with those of Ohanko, were con- stantly attacking the latter with long spears and poisoned arrows. In this way many deaths had resulted, when Ebele appeared upon the scene. He, it appears, was armed with what at that time was known as “a king’s gun,” one of the old flint-locks — a fact which seems to point to his having come from the direction of either Old Calabar or Ibani, — and was present one day when the enemy made one of their periodical attacks on the friends with whom he was staying. Going to their assistance with his regal and trusty weapon, he shot several of the enemy. The others, who had never even heard of a gun, seeing their comrades fall as if struck by an invisible hand, came and shook the bodies, but finding them lifeless, they fled in terror, and never again ventured to attack Ohanko. After this remarkable occurrence Ebele, hailed by the people as their saviour, settled down amongst them, and very rapidly became a man of great influence, as well as substance. Many years passed by in peace and quietness, when suddenly a dispute arose between the two leading factions of the town. Unable to settle the matter amicably among themselves, they called him in as mediator. That this unknown hunter was no less distinguished in the double-tongued art of diplomacy than he was in the science of war is quite evident, — a fact that is in no sense surprising ; for among a natural people the leader invariably is not only a man of action but a man of words — a thinker and talker, yet a doer as well. So, grasp- ing the fact that matters were too far gone for settlement, and in order to avoid an open rupture, Ebele decided on separating the contending factors. In this way it was arranged that while one of them remained at Ohanko the other removed to Obaku, only some three or four miles off. The division, CHAP. Ill TRADITIONS 33 having been agreed to by both parties, was effected without any further disagreement or disturbance, and as soon as it was completed Ebele himself took possession of what is now called Ohumbele. At Akwete, only 7 miles distant, the people, like the former, belong to the Ndoke clan of the Ibo race. Yet their principal deity is “ Nkwu Abasi,” which means “ the God from the ‘Sea’ — literally ‘Bigwater’ — far away.” As “Abasi” among the Ibibio and Efik is also the supreme god — the Creator, in fact — this would seem to imply the existence of a former connection between the Ndoke and Ngwa clans of the Ibo and the Ibibio, who live contiguous to them. Nkwu, too, is evidently derived from the same root as Nkwa or Kwa, i.e. Ibibio, while the fact that the divinity is believed to have come some distance from the big water — probably a large river or estuary — demonstrates that at an earlier period of their history these people were all of one origin and a coast tribe. Yet on looking into the history of “ Oga,” the second deity in importance to “ Nkwu Abasi,” we find that the worship of him is common to Obu-akpu, Okrika, and Afam ; the former, which is an offshoot of Akwete, having introduced him from the latter. But as this place “ Afam,” which lies towards the Ibo interior, is pure Ibo, the question of origin becomes more complicated than ever, for so continuous have been the expansions, yet so constant the intermingling of these various units, that it is practically impossible to trace the end of one or the beginning of the other. In the interior the same absence of all except recent tradition, which even then is extremely meagre, is most marked. To take just one example. All that the people of Umudru-onha know with regard to their past is that they are descended from a family called “Oba,” which lived in a country by name Amadgwio. Subsequently, when the family had grown too big, an exodus of several of the households took place, and there was a general scattering of them in all directions. Ever since then they had remained in their present location, but they still adhered to the same god Ogidi, who had always been the god of their ancestors, and D 34 THE LOWER NIGER AND ITS TRIBES PART I who was represented by a pillar of chalk in the water beyond Umudru-onha. Going up the Niger, and selecting Asaba on the western bank, which, by the way, is called Ahaba by its own inhabitants and Araba by the people in the neighbour- hood, we find that it originally belonged to a community on the eastern side of the river, by name N’tege, which lies at the back of Onitsha ; the separation having occurred in the time of their forefathers, presumably some two or three hundred years ago. For a reason they could not divulge, but due no doubt to the fact that they believed themselves to be the off- spring, therefore subject to Nri — a district some 40 miles eastward of Ahaba, the kings and chiefs of which had been the head of the original household, — the privilege of crowning the kings of the latter place is still possessed by the former. In addition to this ancient rite the chiefs of Nri, as well as of Igbuza — a town V miles to the west of Ahaba — who belong to the elder or patriarchal branch, possess the privilege of both circumcising and ornamenting with indigo the bodies of their younger kinsmen, the only explanation of this weird custom being ascribed to the inability of the former to perform these operations for themselves. Nri or N’slii — evidently the same place, but a different pronunciation of it — is a town which is situated about forty to fifty miles to the east, i.e. behind Onitsha, on the east bank of the Niger, just below its confluence with the Anambara, in the district of Isu or Isuama, or the country of Isu. The inhabitants of this particular town are known as “ king-makers ” — in other words, they possess the sole prerogative of conferring the title of royalty in all the Ibo country lying on the right bank of the river, the distinguishing insignia being an anklet made out of pineapple fibre. They also, it appears, enjoy the privilege of walking untouched or unharmed through any portion of the same — a privilege which lower down to the south is extended to the Ama-Ofo, or people known as Aro or Inokun, just as among the Ibibio all members of the Idion fraternity are entitled to a similar privilege within the borders of their own territory. It is in a certain measure evident that somewhere in this locality of CHAP. Ill TRADITIONS 35 Isuama, in which the purest Ibo is said to be spoken, is to be found the heart of the Ibo nationality ; consequently it is quite reasonable to look among its people for the original fountain-head from which all the other clans have sprung. This inference too is supported not only by the purity of the language, but by this right of dispensing or rather of confer- ring royalty which is undoubtedly the prerogative of the Nri or N’shi people. Once more let us return to the vicinity of the Niger, to a place called Onitsha-Mili, lying a few miles to the north- west of Asaba. Here the tradition is that this place, along with the towns of Onitsha-Olona, Onitsha-Ukwu, Onitsha- Ugbo, and Onitsha-Ukwuani, migrated or were driven out, presumably between two to three hundred years ago, from the near vicinity of Benin City, which they speak of as Ado-n-Idu. Crossing over the river to the east bank, some four or five miles below Asaba, is another community, comprising a prin- cipal town and several outlying villages, which is merely called Onitsha, that in olden days was undoubtedly the parent stock from which those now on the western side had been derived. According to its elders, fourteen generations since Ado-n-Idu was the capital of an extensive kingdom embrac- ing many countries, but having religion, customs, and language in common, over which Oba ruled as king. At the time in question Onitsha, situated to the westward of Benin, and between it and the river, was one of these countries. It happened one day that Asije, the royal mother of this great monarch, went on to one of the farms belonging to Onitsha- Mili, for the purpose, it appears, of gathering sticks, for which she was seized and beaten by the people to whom the farms belonged. On her return to Benin she reported the matter of her ill-treatment to the king, and he at once ordered his younger brother Gbunmara, the commander -in -chief of his forces, to punish the insult which had been offered to his royal mother. Gbunmara immediately mustered a large army, and lost no time in invading the territory of Onitsha, the king of which, with all the available men whom he could collect, opposed him. After two days’ severe fighting, however, the 36 THE LOWER NIGER AND ITS TRIBES PART I latter were defeated, and, sooner than surrender, the entire community retired to the locality on the western bank which is now occupied by the greater majority of their descendants, but a small portion made their way southward towards Abo. Tsima the king, however, with his two sons Ekensu and Oreze and their households, retreated right across the river, and settled in the same spot that their successors now occupy. But in leaving Ado-n-Idu behind them, these people then and for ever abandoned their Bini nationality and language. For even those who have remained on the western bank, and who are therefore within easy touch of Benin, are Ibo in every essential, talking pure Ibo, and not a mixed language, or even a dialect, in which Bini words are to be found. Yet the spirit of Tsima, their more modern founder and ancestor, is still with them, living and embodied in the same tree which he planted with his own hand. In succession to him, the following kings have reigned over Onitsha : — Tsinwukwa, Nafia, Atasia, Tsimezei, Tsimefi, Azoli, Tsimedie, Omozele, Ijelakpe, Udogwu, Akazue, Diali, Anazonwu. With regard to the election to the kingly office, there are in Onitsha four communal divisions, viz. Ulutu, Gbeneke, Ado, and Eke n’ubene, to whom all matters are referred. To Ugwu n’obamkpa belongs the absolute right of conferring what is called “ Ofo ” — the god of truth and justice — upon the chief or individual who is elected king. This rite is absolutely indispensable, and without it no one can be elected to the office — so much so that when a member of one of the few royal families of Onitsha has been nominated, his nomination, to be valid, must be ratified and sanctioned by Ugwu n’obamkpa. It is useless, from a practical standpoint, to pursue this subject of tradition any further, for the same woeful lack of material and the same hopeless confusion confronts us at every turn. Even among the Aro section, which is undoubt- edly the most intelligent of all the Ibo clans, there was nothing either definite or reliable. The reverence and precedence which is accorded to the Nri section by all the other Ibo clans proper in their vicinity, is evidence in favour of the belief which prevails CHAP. Ill TRADITIONS 37 among them, that the latter are descended from the former. For when all the circumstances in connection with the matter are inquired into, it is quite evident that the homage in question has nothing whatever to do with con- siderations arising from social and commercial intercourse, or from any question of martial or material supremacy (because the Nri are now not only more or less scattered, but are in no sense either a powerful or a warlike family) ; but, on the contrary, because it is acknowledged that they are the highest representatives of sacerdotalism in the Ibo race — an office carry- ing with it certain sacred attributes, which has undoubtedly been handed down to them as an ancestral heirloom by virtue of the. law of primogeniture. Yet, with the exception of this proverb, “ The street of the Nri family is the street of the gods, through which all who die in other parts of Iboland pass to the Land of Spirits,” there are no traditions of any kind in support of this. But, in addition to this evidence of descent, the fact that the presence of some of these priests at all of the most import- ant religious functions and ceremonies in Iboland proper is considered indispensable, is additional evidence in respect to their origin. Thus, when a chief is about to assume the king- ship of his community, he is obliged to have a representative from Nri, who becomes the master of all the necessary cere- monials ; for without his presence the whole function becomes irregular, if not invalid. In connection with this specific ceremonial it is also essen- tial that the budding monarch should receive from the Nri priest certain requisite ornaments, without which the former is unable even to offer kola-nuts to the tribal gods. Further than this, the latter is allowed to have free access to the person of any king, whose prerogative is practically an empty sound, so far as he is concerned. Again, there are certain actions which, as being, in native opinion, inconsistent with the requirements of the earth, are regarded as serious offences. Whenever, therefore, any one belonging to a community commits an offence of this nature, the rest of the people take alarm, because it is generally regarded as an upsetting of the order and harmony of things, 38 THE LOWER NIGER AND ITS TRIBES PART I both in their spiritual and temporal affairs. At this juncture the Nri people step into the breach, as peacemakers, to effect a reconciliation between the offenders and the gods ; for misconduct of this nature is always considered to be a crime against the land, or a general pollution of the material earth. The Nri theocracy, having intervened, at once prescribe certain essential objects as victims of purgation. In some cases the shedding of blood is absolutely necessary. This ceremony is invariably performed by a special representative from Nri, who, after he has performed the sacrifices at different shrines or centres belonging to the community, endeavours to allay the fears of the people by assuring them that the blood has become a sure and effective ransom. But with regard to the sanctity of Nri origin, in addition to the evidence that has been brought forward, it is further believed that no religious rite is so striking or so effectual as that which is performed by these priests, who hold their office merely as a divine and sacred right ; for by virtue of this priority they are said to be in possession of numerous attributes that have been imparted to them by their ancestors, and which are reserved for the use and purpose of the gods alone. Moreover, they have a special and peculiar method of utilising or expressing these attributes. Indeed, their manner of conducting religious ceremonials, more especially with regard to touch, and to the way in which they handle the various emblems of worship, is considered to be particularly practical and effective. As in some measure supporting these statements, the following are the communities who, as more or less paying an annual tribute to the Nri to this day, acknowledge in the most direct way of all their ancestral lineage : — 1. Abam Uny-agu, occupying the southern district of Iboland proper, and comprising the communities of Isu-ama, Aba-mili, Agbaja, Ube, etc. 2. Abum Akpukpa, occupying the western district, and including the communities of Ada, Isi n’Agidi, Umutsu- kwu, Enugwu, Ezi-owele, Achala, Okuru, Nteji, Abagana, Ifite, Urn, etc. 3. Abum Bianko, occupying the northern district, in CHAP. Ill TRADITIONS 39 which Adani, Ukpabi, Ukpologwu, Ubulu Odolu, Ikefi, etc., are incorporated. 4. Oka and Nne-ogu. These, it appears, are the principal divisions into which the Ibo proper are divided, of which the following are said to be offshoots : — 1. Aba teghete, or Agbaja, from which have sprung the towns of Umu-oji, Nkpo, Ogidi, which still bears the name Iteghete, and Obosi. 2. Nteje, from which have been derived Umu-diolca, Asaba, Achala, and Agubri. 3. Nimo ; also the Nimo on the opposite bank of the Niger. 4. Ukpo, on both banks. 5. Odumodu, with which are incorporated Umunya, Mgbakwu, Otobo, Nnewu. G. Okuzu and Nzam. V. Obosi, to which have migrated portions of Ezetsima, Ugamuma, Iruoghulu, Makwum. But, decisive enough as this evidence appears to be regard- ing the origin of the Ibo, it brings us no nearer to that of the Nri, although it certainly confirms the impression that the latter are distinct from and have never been affiliated with the Bini. CHAPTER IV A GENERAL ANALYSIS OF EXISTING DATA It now remains for us to examine the data which have been presented in the previous chapters for the purpose of reducing, if possible, at least a certain amount of order and coherency into the conflicting and chaotic elements. Yet, meagre and disconnected as these data are, they are not, however, entirely valueless, as I will endeavour to demonstrate ; but before attempting to do so, a brief capitulation, or summary, is essential to enable us to arrive at conclusions which are in any way definite or intelligible. It has already been seen that the Efik of Old Calabar, although they claim descent from the Ibo, are most un- doubtedly derived from the Ibibio ; but from whom these in turn have sprung, unless they are an offshoot of the former, is buried in mystery. That the Ibani, i.e. the Bonny and Opobo people, although they trace their origin to an Ibo and can speak that tongue, also claim connection with Brass. That the New Calabar natives appear to have been a com- bination of Efik from Creek Town and of Ijo on the coast, who divided into three sections — one remaining as the New Calabar, the other two separating in the direction of Brass and Bonny. That the Brassmen, while tracing their origin to the Binis, acknowledge at the same time an influx of Ijo and New Cala- bar blood. That nothing is known about the Ijo, except the question of their Bini descent, which, however, rests on the slenderest of evidence. That the Jekri are most undoubtedly of Bini origin, in spite of their language being affiliated with Yoruba. 40 chap, iv A GENERAL ANALYSIS OF EXISTING DATA 41 That the Bini origin, similar to that of the Ibo, has unfor- tunately been lost in the oblivion of the past. This, as has already been remarked, is extremely contra- dictory, and scanty detail to work upon ; but by throwing upon it the light of philology it is possible to obtain a clearer aspect of, if not insight into, the tangled question. The language of the Efik, Kwa or Akwa, and Ibibio is practically identical. At Bonny and Opobo the Ibani, while able to speak Ibo, have a distinct tongue of their own, which is unknown to the Ibo. Quite unlike and different from the Ibibio group, which includes Andoni, it is the same as Okrika, and different only in dialect from New Calabar, as a reference to the Appendices will show, while it has many words in common and a distinct dialectic affinity with Brass more particularly, and with Ijo in general. Spoken of as Ibani-yen, it is said by the people to be the tongue of their forefathers, just as “ Ibani ” or “ Okuloma ” is, without doubt, the proper name of Bonny, which is only a corruption of the native term. But although the Ibani and Okrika peoples speak the same dialect, they consider themselves to be of different origin from each other, as also do the New Calabar and Brass. Yet the Okrika are also obviously of Ibo descent, though very prob- ably from another part of the country to that from which the founder of the Ibani originally came. Taking the Ijo language next, a comparison made between it and the Ibani, Okrika, New Calabar, and Brass dialects reveals the fact that all four of them, also Oru, are dialects of the Ijo. Andoni, on the other hand, is connected with and of the same derivation as the Ibibio or Akwa language. Yet right in the midst of the Andoni clan is a town called N’Koro, the inhabitants of which, who are said to have deserted from Okrika, speak a dialect that is not understood by their present countrymen. The Ogoni, again, speak a distinct tongue of their own, which, so far as I could discover, is quite different from Ibo or Ijo, and about which I was unfortunately unable to get any reliable information. Going to the Ogbayan district, another lingual problem, more complicated even than that of the Ibani or the Jekri, 42 THE LOWER NIGER AND ITS TRIBES PART I confronts ns. Tracing their origin, as these people do, to a Brassman named Olei, who deserted from Oma-mabiri and settled at Olobiri, the meaning of the word “ Ogbayan ” is that of “ a country which has been resettled or reconstructed through misfortune.” Comprising as it now does a population number- ing over 30,000, living in some ten to twelve towns, the people, in spite of their Brass descent, speak quite a different language, and, what is more, one which is said by the natives to be distinct from any of the principal languages in the Delta. But this is not all, for right in the middle of their district and mixed up with them are some people calling themselves Alisa, who belong to a separate tribe with a tongue of its own, yet who speak Ogbayan. From what, so far, is known of the I jo, Jekri, and Bini languages, the former is said to have but a slight resemblance to the latter, and this again to the Jekri, which resembles more, or rather is cognate with, the Yoruba. This curious circumstance is all the more significant and worthy of remark when the facts are taken into consideration, that the Ijo and Jekri are direct descendants of the Bini, and that in spite of their separation, presumably for the last few centuries at least, they have all the same been more or less in touch with one another. Yet an examination of the six or more dialects of Ijo and the five of Bini, of which Sobo and Igabo are practically one, shows that they are dissimilar not only to each other, but to the other neighbouring tongues. The Ibo country, as has already been pointed out, is both extensive, populous, and divided into numerous clans and communities, speaking dialects which vary in degree from slight to considerable. I speak, of course, entirely with regard to that portion of it with which I was associated, and the people with whom I came into personal touch. These were the Aro or Ama-Ofo, Abarn, N’doke, Ngwa, Omuma, Ohuhu, Grata, Isuama, N’kweri, Ekwe, Mbeari, Oratshi, Engeni, Abua, Abaja, Akpam — all of them situated between the Niger and Cross rivers, — Abo and Niger Ibo, i.e. the dialect spoken by the people on the eastern and western banks. Comparing the language as it is spoken in all of these different localities, the dialectical variations are not very chap, iv A GENE"
