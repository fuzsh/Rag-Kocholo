        "text": "Oil Rivers Protectorate\n\nIn 1855 a British protectorate was declared for much of the coastal area of Nigeria apart from the region around Lagos. From 1891 a consular postal service was set up, based primarily around Old Calabar in the \"Oil Rivers\" area, becoming authorised post offices in 1892. The first stamps were issued in 1892, and almost immediately the authorities kept running out of particular values - or claimed to have done so to justify the production of some rather philatelic provisionals.\n\nOne further provisional overprint appeared later in 1894, but overprinting continued on postal stationery, which can therefore appear with either the \"Oil Rivers\" or the \"Niger Coast\" overprint.\n\nAll stamps are overprinted \"BRITISH PROTECTORATE OIL RIVERS\", including the provisionals.\n\nNote: this numbering system was drawn up by the Society for the website, and may not be used without permission.\n\nQueen Victoria\n\n20 July 1892\n\n1 ½d orange\n\n2 1d lilac\n\n3 2d green & red\n\n4 2½d purple on blue\n\n5 5d purple & blue, die II\n\n6 5d die I\n\nNote: the die I stamp with this overprint has been included in catalogue listings since the 1980s, but no independent references to it have been located, nor the existence of any copies documented.\n\n7 1/- green\n\noverprint varieties\n\n2 v1 1d overprint transposed (\"Oil Rivers\" at the top)\n\nThis was caused by a vertically misplaced overprint, so that \"OIL RIVERS\" also appeared in the bottom margin (at least one copy of this is recorded); very few copies escaped recall and destruction. Image from Rossi collection, courtesy of Warwick & Warwick.\n\n5 v1 5d overprint partially double\n\nThe stamps (and postal stationery) were supplied with red waxed paper interleaving to prevent them sticking together in the damp climate, as shown in the example below: mint items often still show traces of this, and it is quite normal.\n\n3 September 1893 provisionals\n\nNote: most used copies of the bisect appear very philatelic, casting doubt on the need for the issue. Forgeries are also frequently offered for sale, mostly very convincing, both mint and used.\n\nOverprint in violet\n\nThis was only used on the top row of the first sheet to be overprinted. The ink was clearly unsuitable and smudged badly, so red was used for the rest of the half-sheet and the other 3 half-sheets overprinted. Although the overprint was ostensibly done in one row of 6 at a time, it is strange to note the existence of double overprints on single copies.\n\n8 \"½d\" in violet, bisected diagonally\n\nillustration below.\n\noverprint varieties\n\n8 v2 ½d in violet: surcharge double\n\nfor copies se-tenant with the red surcharge see below.\n\nOverprint in red\n\n9 \"½d\" in red on half of 1d lilac, bisected diagonally\n\nillustration below.\n\noverprint varieties\n\nNo 9 v4, ie Nos 8 (pair) and 9 (pair) se-tenant, ex Rossi collection,\n\nillustration courtesy of Warwick & Warwick\n\n9 v1 ½d in red: surcharge reversed (line top left to bottom right)\n\n9 v2 ½d in red: surcharge reversed and inverted\n\n9 v3 ½d in red: surcharge double (pair with normal)\n\nNote: this wording in catalogues presumably means \"doubled on one half, still joined to other half with normal overprint\", but it is ambiguous.\n\n9 v4 ½d in red: se-tenant with surcharge in violet (vertical pair, rows 1 & 2)\n\nNote: this wording in catalogues appears to mean a vertical pair of unsplit stamps, ie 2 complete stamps, but it is ambiguous. See illustration above.\n\nDecember 1893 provisionals\n\nThe provisionals below are deemed to be highly philatelic, and some are not known used. It is alleged that in preparing the emergency issue the post master arranged for all conceivable permutations of the available fonts and colours to be tried out in various orientations, in order to see which combinations worked best. These alleged trial sheets came on the market and produced some remarkable (and highly-prized) se-tenant varieties. Nonetheless they must be regarded at best as \"philatelic\", and at worst as prepared purely for collectors, though some of them certainly saw genuine postal service. The quantities of some of the scarcer versions are exceedingly small (some as few as 3 or 4), and are often well outnumbered by the number of copies on the market. Forgeries abound.\n\nOn many examples of the overprints the line at the bottom is faint or almost entirely missing; these are not different types.\n\nThe first four types shown below can be found on the 2d and on the 2½d Oil Rivers overprints, types 5-8 only on the 2½d value.\n\n\"HALF PENNY\" on 2d green & red\n\ntype 1, squat block capitals top line 9½mm, 14½mm line, 1½mm spacing\n\nNo. 10

together.\n\nnote: examples with the full stop not showing properly look like the later version, but the latter is only recorded in vermilion.\n\nNo 27 (courtesy of David Allen)\n\n26 \"HALF PENNY\"

of David Allen)\n\n37 \"HALF PENNY\" in green\n\n38 ditto in vermilion\n\nHigher values\n\nNote: the need for these higher values was highly questionable, especially the issue of 1/- surcharge on the 2d at the same time as 1/- stamps themselves were being used for the 20/- surcharge.\n\nOne shilling\n\nThere are 3 subtypes of the \"One Shilling\" overprint:\n\nType (a): \"n\" of \"One\" lines up with the \"ll\" of \"Shilling\"\n\nType (b): \"n\" of \"One\" lines up with second \"l\" of \"Shilling\"\n\nType (c): \"n\" of \"One\" falls between the two \"ll\" of \"Shilling\"\n\n39 \"One Shilling\" on 2d green & red surcharge in black, type (a)\n\n40 ditto type (c)\n\n41 surcharge in vermilion, type (a)\n\n42 ditto type (b)\n\n43 surcharge in violet, type (a)\n\n44 ditto type (b)\n\noverprint varieties\n\nNote: as catalogues and other listings and study papers do not distinguish the above types when discussing varieties, they are listed with two numbers below.\n\n39/40 v1

black (Dec 1893)\n\n48 ditto, surcharge in vermilion\n\n49 ditto, surcharge in violet\n\noverprint varieties\n\n49 v1 violet surcharge inverted\n\nJune 1894 provisional\n\nA large figure \"1\" handstamped on the left or right half of a bisected 2d green & red. There are many forgeries.\n\nWhether or not this provisional was needed, a large number appear to have survived on rather philatelic-looking pieces. The overprint is reported to have been made from 3 different carvings by hand on blocks of wood.\n\n50 \"1\", 12mm on half of 2d\n\n51 \"1\", 4¾mm on half of 2d\n\n52 \"1\", 3¾mm on half of 2d\n\noverprint varieties\n\n50 v1 12mm surcharge double (either half)\n\n50 v2 12mm surcharge inverted\n\n51 v1 4¾ mm surcharge se-tenant with 3¾mm\n\nIn 1893 the protectorate was enlarged and renamed \"Niger Coast Protectorate\". The dies for stamps ordered with the country name inscribed had unfortunately already been engraved, so Waterlows simply engraved the new country name over the old one, looking like an overprint but not being one. This set was issued on 1 January 1894, though clearly the previous overprinted stamps continued in use, as is shown by the June 1894 provisionals.\n\nselect bibliography\n\ngo to top\n\ngo to country list\n\ngo to home page\n\npage last updated: 11 March 2007, 5 May 2011, 6 March 2013, 7 March 2016\n\ngbos: GB Overprints Society"
