        "text": "After more than a century of paramount British influence in the area, British consuls, responsible to the Foreign Office, were appointed for the eastern part of the Niger coast from 1849. The Oil Rivers Protectorate was established over that part of the coast in 1885, and in 1891 a commissioner and consul-general replaced the consul at Old Calabar. In 1893 the protectorate was extended and named the Niger Coast Protectorate. In 1899 responsibility was transferred from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office, and in 1900 the protectorate was united with the southern portion of the territories of the Royal Niger Company to form the Protectorate of Southern Nigeria."
