The original name for Calabar was Akwa Akpa, from the Efik language, later was a need to remove the ambiguity from the name Akwa Akpa later.The spelling Calabar remained till the British came and pronounced Calabar as Calabah.\n\nSettled in the early 17th century by the Efik branch of the Ibibio people, the town became a centre for trade between white traders on the coast and natives farther inland. Fish, cassava, bananas, palm oil, and palm kernels were traded at Calabar for European manufactured goods, and the town also served as a major slave-trading depot.\n\nThe city is watered by the Calabar and Great Kwa Rivers and creeks of the Cross River (from its inland delta).\n\nThe neighboring town of Ataba took over the name and its Efik Efut/Biase/Akampkpa indigenes became known as Calabar pronounced Calabah till this day. Calabar is a large metropolis today with several towns like Akamkpa, Akim, Bakassi, Ikot Ansa, Ikot Ishie, Kasuk etc.\n\nCalabar is the capital of Cross River State. For the purpose of administration, the city is divided into Calabar Municipal and Calabar South LGAs. It has an area of 406 kmÂ² and a population of 371,022 at the 2006 census.\n\nAs far back as the 16th century, Calabar had been a recognized international sea port, shipping out goods such as palm oil. During the era of the Atlantic slave trade It subsequently became a major port in the transportation of African slaves. Most slave ships that transported slaves from Calabar were English, at around 85% of these ships being from Bristol and Liverpool merchants. Old Calabar (Duke Town) and Creek Town, 10 miles northeast, were crucial towns in the trade of slaves in that era. The first British warship to sail as far as Duke Town, where she captured seven Spanish and Portuguese slavers, may have been HMS Comes in 1815."
