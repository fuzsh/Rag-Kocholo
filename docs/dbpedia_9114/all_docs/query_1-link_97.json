        "text": "The Slave Trade and Culture in the Bight of Biafra The Slave Trade and Culture in the Bight of Biafra dissects and explains the structure, dramatic expansion, and manifold effects of the slave trade in the Bight of Biafra. By showing that the rise of the Aro merchant group was the key factor in trade expansion, G. Ugo Nwokeji reinterprets why and how such large-scale commerce developed in the absence of large-scale centralized states. The result is the first study to link the structure and trajectory of the slave trade in a major exporting region to the expansion of a specific African merchant group – among other fresh insights into Atlantic Africa’s involvement in the trade – and the most comprehensive treatment of Atlantic slave trade in the Bight of Biafra. The fundamental role of culture in the organization of trade is highlighted, transcending the usual economic explanations in a way that complicates traditional generalizations about work, domestic slavery, and gender in precolonial Africa. G. Ugo Nwokeji is assistant professor of African American studies at the University of California, Berkeley. His research focuses on the cultural history and political economy of Africa since 1500, with particular focus on international commerce in the Nigerian Niger Delta and its hinterland. Professor Nwokeji is the author of the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy’s The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation and the Development of the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry: History, Strategies, and Current Directions (2007) and multiple journal articles and book chapters, as well as co-editor of Religion, History and Politics in Nigeria (2005).\n\nThe Slave Trade and Culture in the Bight of Biafra An African Society in the Atlantic World\n\nG.

Some of the most persistent questions are why Africa supplied so many captives; how the trade was organized; what its political, social, and cultural implications were; what the gender and ethnic composition was; and how the trade affected the societies involved. The answers to these questions are the primary focus of this book. They are addressed from the vantage point of the Bight of Biafra, a major exporting region, extending from the Niger Delta (exclusive of the River Nun) in modern Nigeria to Cape Lopez in modern Gabon. The region supplied an estimated 13 percent of all captives exported between 1551 and 1850, which made it the third most important supply region after West-Central Africa and the Bight of Benin. What marked out the Bight of Biafra slave trade was its unusual trajectory. Departures of captives from the region increased fivefold between the last quarter of the seventeenth century and the last quarter of the eighteenth century (Table 0.1). Concomitantly, the majority Igbo of the hinterland were probably the largest single African group arriving in North America and several Caribbean destinations for much of the eighteenth century. The traffic closed down quickly in the 1840s, but for most of the preceding century, the Bight of Biafra had been the second most important region for captives taken to the Americas (though lagging well behind West-Central Africa). How did a region that once supplied a small number of captives so quickly become the second most important supply region in the eighteenth century, in spite of the absence of large centralized states? In comparison to the well-known ever-increasing demand for African slave labor that the sugar revolution stirred in the xiii\n\nPreface\n\nxiv\n\nTable 0.1.

Numbers with decimal points are not precise because of rounding.\n\nAmericas, there is still much to explore about how African regions met this demand. The Aro, who call themselves “Aru,” inhabit a conspicuous place in the history of the inglorious slave trade. They dominated the slave trade in inland Bight of Biafra from their Arochukwu homeland, north of the Cross River–Enyong Creek estuary in the southeastern portion of the Nigerian section of the region. The Aro were a peculiar group. Though the region was marked by “stateless” societies, Aro organization did in fact have characteristics of a state. Yet, it was rather a peculiar organization as a diaspora – rather than a state – which explains the rise and expansion of the region’s transatlantic slave trade. The following chapters elaborate this proposition. This study treats the Aro trading network as a trade diaspora, in spite of the relatively small geographic space of the Bight of Biafra. The enormous ethnolinguistic diversity and the evolution of ethnic identity of the region warrant such a perspective and explain the treatment in this study of the slave-trade-era Aro as a separate cultural phenomenon, even though they are today little more than a subgroup of the Igbo. By the seventeenth century, Arochukwu culture and dialect had emerged as a hybrid of Igbo, Ibibio, and Akpa elements; Arochukwu itself is located in the Igbo-Ibibio-Ejagham borderland. Hybridity – a process undergone in\n\nPreface\n\nxv\n\ndifferent forms and degrees by much of Atlantic Africa during the slave trade era – continued in the Aro diaspora. The process was perhaps more marked among the Aro than was the norm in the Bight of Biafra. Although the vast majority of present-day Aro people either identify themselves or are identified by others as Igbo, to impose such an identity on the period covered in this study is an anachronism. Arochukwu’s multiethnic origin shaped Aro social structures and identity during the period covered in this study. Contrary to the sections of pre-twentiethcentury Aro population that originated among groups that came to see themselves as Igbo, the case with the Aro tracing their own origins elsewhere is different. Neither can we simply conflate as Igbo the Aro communities that still remain outside Igboland, principally among the Ibibio in the Cross River region and the Igala in the Middle Belt. It should be noted that the Igbo group covered a much smaller area before the late nineteenth century than they came to occupy in the twentieth century. That an Igbo group in the sense that we have come to know them in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries did not exist in the era of the transatlantic slave trade is not in question; what is subject to debate is whether there were any people who identified themselves as Igbo and, if so, when they began to do so.1 For the most part, the application of “Igbo” to much of the period covered in this book is not meant to project a pan-Igbo identity as currently exists but to refer to a group of societies that later constituted Igboland. A reading of historical and anthropological studies of the region, as well as ethnographic observations during the late twentieth century, suggests that Igboness came to involve (perhaps not exclusively) four basic elements in addition to a common language – two deities, the Ala/Anị/Ana earth deity and Chi personal god, and reverence for two crops/foods, yam (ji) and kolanut (ọjị). Except for peripheral societies that migrated into the Igbo area after the overseas slave trade had gathered momentum in the region, the societies that became Igbo seem to have in the main shared a strong social and spiritual attachment to yam and kolanut, but only those within the perimeter referred to as the Igbo heartland and which had additionally subscribed to Ala and Chi deities are assumed to have 1\n\nThe earliest written reference to the group was when Spanish missionary in the Americas Alonso Sandoval entered “Ibo” in his collection of ethnolinguistic groups, which was how some people located in a place we now know as Igboland were referred to and probably how some people referred to themselves as well ([1627] 1956:94). For various perspectives, see Leith-Ross 1939:56; Oriji 1994:5; Gomez 1998, chapter 6; Nwokeji 2000:629–33; Northrup 2000; Chambers 2002; Byrd 2008:17–33, 56, 261n.\n\nxvi\n\nPreface\n\nbecome Igbo at the onset of the overseas slave trade.2 At any rate, the process of Igboization would seem to have begun with – at least in part – the embrace of yam and kolanut reverence.3 These two foods/crops – as will be shown in this study – played important roles in shaping the structure of the slave trade in the Bight of Biafra. 2\n\n3\n\nExplicitly and implicitly, anthropologists have identified Ala as the most important deity among the Igbo (Meek 1937:20, 24–33; Ottenberg 1959:136). There was a larger number of units in the Igbo pantheon, but some of these were not pan-Igbo even at the turn of the twentieth century, in the sense that nearly all the groups that referred to themselves as Igbo had come to be associated beyond Ala and Chi. The heartland is the home of an inner core, the “autochthonous” communities of Igboland – a group of societies whose peoples have continuously occupied the area for so long that their traditions locate their origins in the vicinity of their present abodes. For the autochthones, see J.O. Ijoma 1986c:11; Ifemesia 1979:21; Isichei 1976:67; G.I. Jones 1963; Ohadike 1994:12; Oriji 1994. The autochthones may be deemed the first-order Igbo, followed by the rest of the heartland. Beyond the heartland, we find an outer ring of groups that had significant non-Igbo elements, such as Arochukwu, several other Cross River Igbo groups, southern Igboland – principally the Ngwa, Ndoki, and communities to their south – as well as the societies around and beyond the city of Enugu. Finally, there are groups that migrated into the region in the course of the transatlantic slave trade, mostly in riverine regions, such as Onitsha, Oguta, Abo, Igga, and many of the West-Niger Igbo societies. Historian John Oriji (1994:5) has drawn attention to the presence in the Igbo heartland of Amaigbo (Ama-Igbo, meaning “Igbo Square”), the ancient town to which many Isuama Igbo communities trace their origins, and the historic Igbo-Ukwu (“Grand Igbo”), in which the archeologist Thurstan Shaw (1970a, 1970b) uncovered artifacts of ninth-century vintage, which suggests that the nucleus of Igboland was perhaps the Amaigbo/Igbo-Ukwu axis of the so-called Igbo heartland. The human figures found among the artifacts had the distinctive ichi marks on their faces, a practice that continued in the Nri-Awka area up to recent decades (Ifemesia 1979:18–19, 89). There is a dialectical variation in the ways people of the Amaigbo and Igbo-Ukwu subregions of the Igbo heartland pronounce the earth cult – Ala in the case of Amaigbo and Anị/Ana in the case of Nri. There are no dialectical variations in the pronunciation of the other key terms – ọjị (kolanut), ji (yam), and Chi, except for the nasalization that mark some dialects. The cultural landscape of the region was, however, more fluid than this schema might imply. A given group may have combined cultural forms that related more to groups outside than the ones inside the category it is placed in, a reflection of relentless movement of people and ideas. Aro diaspora communities were in very recent centuries established in areas long settled by autochthones and heartland groups. Originally, Ikeji itself celebrated the beginning of yam harvest among the Aro, although the festival changed significantly after trading became the principal occupation of the Aro. Kolanut also played a central role in Aro covenants with their trading and political allies as well as in inducting newly acquired slaves into the household (Kanu-Igbo 1996b; J.G. Okoro 1996). The present writer has not seen any evidence in support of the existence of Chi and the Ala cult among the Aro before the nineteenth century. An instance of Ana emerges among the Aro diaspora of the Ndieni cluster, located in the Nri-Awka region, in the late nineteenth century. Ikeji, Ihu, and to an extent the Ana cult (Ajana) are discussed in detail in Chapter 4. The role of yam and kolanut in shaping the structure of the slave trade is analyzed in Chapter 6. Aro traditions refer to gifts of kolanuts and yams accompanying the Ihu “homage” rite, and to wives giving their husbands kolanuts during the Ikeji festival (Arodiogbu 1996; Nwankwo and Okereke 1996).\n\nPreface\n\nxvii\n\nWith their Arochukwu homeland located in the southeastern periphery of what we now call Igboland and having significant sections of their population speak languages and subscribe to customs significantly different from what was later recognized as Igbo, the Aro had not subscribed to Ala and Chi at the onset of the overseas slave trade, even though most of them seem to have adopted kolanut and yam reverence. The process of Aro Igboization intensified with Aro expansion into the Igbo heartland in the mid-eighteenth century, and the process accelerated during the twentieth century. As emerges in the following pages, there is a difference between the Aro who left the Igbo-Ibibio-Efik borderland to establish settlements in the Igbo heartland and present-day inhabitants of those settlements, themselves mostly descendants of non-Aro Igbo immigrants who joined incoming Aro charter groups. The ethnolinguistic diversity of the Bight of Biafra, the close relationship of trade and culture, and the need to cast light on the background of the African diaspora in the Americas justify a cultural perspective to the study of the region’s slave trade. The pivotal role the Aro diaspora played in the rise of the Biafra Atlantic trade shaped and was shaped by both external forces and the region’s political economy, defined as the totality of the region’s economic, political, cultural, social, and ideological processes. The Aro built their influence mainly by extending preexisting commercial infrastructure and adapting spiritual norms to new circumstances (Ijoma and Njoku 1991:307; Northrup 1978b:142). And expanding trade in the eighteenth century was, in the first instance, the function of increasing Euro-American demand. Although shaped by internal developments, the trade and its aftermath affected the region in many ways. By asserting the collaborative relevance of both internal and external factors, this study departs from the strong tendency in African studies to see historical agency as deriving from either one or, and the other. The interactive approach seeks agency in both internal and external processes and examines how their interaction produced change. This approach throws light on the Atlantic world into which the Aro sold people, not only for pecuniary ends but also for other reasons touching on particular visions of the political and social order. By focusing on one region of Atlantic Africa, the present study provides some basis for understanding developments in the Atlantic region. The following chapters explore African patterns of supply, American patterns of demand, and the sociocultural processes underpinning them. This study should thus be read more than simply as an analysis of the slave trade in the Bight of Biafra. It makes pertinent connections and comparisons with other regions at many junctures; two\n\nxviii\n\nPreface\n\nof these connections – the use of the average daily loading rates of slave ships to measure the intensity of slaving interregionally and the implication for the gender structure of the slave trade of the culture and commerce that developed around kolanut – are introduced here for the first time. The arrangement of the chapters is both chronological and thematic. There are chronological overlaps, but even within the affected sections, I have strived to present the material chronologically. Chapter 1 details the historical and historiographical contexts of the Biafra Atlantic slave trade, and stakes out the claim that the rise and expansion of the Aro merchant group and their organization as a trade diaspora were pivotal to the massive expansion of the Biafra trade in the mid-eighteenth century. In Chapter 2, I relate the chronology of Aro expansion during its first and second phases to the oscillations in the Biafra Atlantic trade up until 1807, when the British, carriers of the bulk of the region’s trade, abolished the traffic. Focusing on the second and third phases, Chapter 3 situates Aro slaving in the regional context with an emphasis on Aro organization between the 1740s and 1850s, a period that captured both the expansion and decline of the Biafra Atlantic slave trade. I link cultural and economic processes within the Bight of Biafra to the Atlantic slave trade in Chapters 4–6, presenting slaving within the region, not just in terms of economic relationships, but also in terms of collateral, social, cultural, and ideological systems. Chapter 4 illustrates how the formation and expansion of the Aro diaspora as a result of the expanding overseas slave trade reconfigured the geocultural landscape of the Bight of Biafra hinterland. On the other hand, endogenous sociocultural practices, such as slavery, means of enslavement, and conceptions of the Atlantic world helped to shape the composition of export captives. The means, process, and structure of slaving are thus the subject of Chapter 5, with a focus on who got enslaved or retained in the region, and who got shipped to the Americas, how and why. Chapter 6 engages with the unusual gender structure of the Biafra slave trade and explains it by patterns of domestic consumption, ritual, warfare, gender division of labor in agriculture, and long-distance trade. Chapter 7 continues the story of cultural changes imposed by the Atlantic slave trade into the final phase of Aro expansion between 1850 and 1902, highlighting the increased incidence of warfare both as the long-term effect of slaving and as the immediate impact of the end of the overseas slave trade. Detailed analysis of the demographic impact has been left out because it has received attention elsewhere (Nwokeji 2000). It suffices here to affirm that the demographic impact was less severe in the Bight of Biafra and its hinterland than in most other\n\nPreface\n\nxix\n\nregions, not because fewer captives were removed from here, but because the region gained population from immigration from outlying inland areas, and did not suffer the adverse effect of the additional slave trade from across the Sahara. Unlike other West African regions, that trade was marginal in the region. Chapter 8 summarizes and concludes the study. A detailed note on the sources appears at the end. In the course of writing this book, I have accumulated debts of gratitude to numerous individuals and organizations. At the University of Toronto Ph.D. program where it all began, the history department, School of Graduate Studies, and the Center for International Development gave generous funding. Over the years, funding has also come from the history department and the Institute for African American Studies, both of the University of Connecticut (UConn), as well as from the African American studies department and the Chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley. This book has benefited from the congenial atmospheres and resources afforded me in the following institutions where I have held visiting positions over the years – the history department of Emory University, the DuBois Institute for Afro-American Research at Harvard University, the Gilder Lehrman Center at Yale University, and Zentrum Moderner Orient, Berlin, Germany. I enjoyed the assistance of many librarians and archivists in several countries, but I would like to single out U.O.A. Esse of the Nigerian National Archives, Enugu, and Father Leo Laden of the Holy Ghost Provincialate, Dublin, Republic of Ireland. Among the elders who taught me aspects of Aro and Igbo history are the late Eze John O. Dike and Eze Jonas Ekemezie Uche, as well as K.G. Ufere, the late Aaron Muotoh, Michael Sunday Igwe, the late Jacob Okoro, Ukobasi KanuIgbo, J.G. Okoro, Thomas Okereke, the late Eneanya Akpu, and Azubuike Nkemakonam Nwaokoye-Emesuo (Periccomo). The late Princewill Imo gave me an insight into the Izuogu lineage in a way few are able and willing to offer. Obi and Ngozi Uche helped me clarify some items in the Aro vocabulary. Ohiaeri Okoro, Aloy Igbo and Fritz-Canute Ngwa, and my cousins Ifeanyi Ike and Emeka Okoronkwo, helped during crucial junctures of the fieldwork; Udi Ojiako provided me invaluable material about and insight into Nri-Awka history. I would like to single out J. Okoro Ijoma and the late Rev. Canon Amos Egwuekwe D. Mgbemene (“AED”) for their assistance during my fieldwork, including giving access to sources and contacts and their own invaluable intellectual reflections on Aro history. All my colleagues in the history department of UConn during 1999–2003 and in the African American studies department at Berkeley since 2003 have given me every support possible.\n\nxx\n\nPreface\n\nNumerous scholars have contributed in many ways to the extent that it is possible to inadvertently omit several, and I apologize to those who I may leave out. I count myself extremely lucky to have been a student of Martin Klein, who introduced me to slavery studies and supervised the dissertation that gave rise to this book. He always asked the hard questions, gave generously from his time and personal financial resources, and has tirelessly motivated me over the years to publish this work. Almost like a guardian angel, Paul Lovejoy has always been there from the time of my introduction to slavery studies to now, giving me as much attention as he would his own formal students, and he shared generously from his extensive knowledge of the slave trade. David Eltis has been a wonderful mentor, inspirer, and friend, and has always done more than I could ask for. Michael Levin and Nakanyike Musisi were of great assistance at the University of Toronto. Southeastern Nigerian scholars of my generation owe enormous intellectual debt to those who have paved the way for us, most prominently the late Adiele Afigbo, Ebiegberi Joe Alagoa (my teacher), the late K. Onwuka Dike, the late Felicia Ekejiuba, Robin Horton, the late G.I. Jones, Elizabeth Isichei, David Northrup, and Simon Ottenberg. Many others deserve credit for comments on drafts of this book – five anonymous reviewers for Cambridge University Press; Toyin Falola who commented extensively on an advanced draft and has always provided useful advice; Gloria Chuku, Jonathan Sadowsky, and Bob Shenton who offered insightful comments on a very early draft, just as Steve Behrendt, Robin Law, and Sean Hawkins did on several draft chapters. John Thornton has been extremely supportive of this work and my career over the years, among other things, drawing my attention to useful sources and sharing his translations of pertinent passages from the writings of Christian Georg Andreas Oldendorp (2000). Three other friends have also helped me with translations – Heike Raphael-Hernandez Onyinye Obidoa with portions of Oldendorp 1995a and 1995b, and Victor Madeira with passages of Alonso Sandoval’s book. David Dickson, the late Felicia Ekejiuba, Jane Guyer, Susan Hargreaves, the late Martin Lynn, Obi Nwakanma, Ikem Stan Okoye, John Peel, Richard Rathbone, Obiora Udechukwu, and Innocent Uzoechi graciously helped with various resources when I intruded in their lives. Over the years, I have benefited enormously from advice by Jerome Handler, the late Ogbu Kalu, Richard Roberts, David Richardson, and Chris Youé. The following people – many of whom are also great friends – have supported me in various ways: Ibrahim Abdullah, Bendi Agocha, Andrea Arrington, Johnson Asiegbu, Edna Bay, Eli Bentor, Carolyn\n\nPreface\n\nxxi\n\nBrown, Alex Byrd, Michael Echeruo, Felix Ekechi, Peter Ekeh, Michael Gomez, Gwendolyn Hall, Axel Herneit-Sievers, Jocelyn Jacquot, Joseph Inikori, Ray Kea, Tony Kirk-Greene, Joseph Miller, Kristin Mann, Phil Morgan, Ben Naanen, Onwuka Njoku, Chidi Nwaubani, Onaiwu Ogbomo, Andrew Okolie, Rachel Sullivan, Vincent Bakpetu Thompson, Maureen Warner-Lewis, and Hans Zell. My thanks also go to the late Don Ohadike, to whom this book is dedicated. Finally and by no means the least, I salute my family for doing everything for me. My parents, Godwin Ukobasi and Christiana Ejenene Nwokeji, challenged me to be the best I can be but they are no longer around to see this book. I am grateful to my wife Nnenna and our children Anaezi, Nwaka, and Ukaobasi, who have come to enrich my life and have sacrificed much in the long course of writing this book. I also salute my siblings and their spouses for their support: Georgy Umenaa and Philip Umunnakwe, May Enda and Tony Okafor, Uche Cele and Fab Amobi, Oby and Uche Ikoro, and Maureen and Obi Anadi.

Of course, I alone am responsible for any remaining errors.\n\nForeword Paul E. Lovejoy\n\nThe interior of the Bight of Biafra has been somewhat of an enigma in the attempt to reconstruct the history of Africa during the era of transatlantic slavery. Its importance in the peopling of the Americas is clear. Perhaps one in six enslaved Africans came from the region. And while there is disagreement in estimating the relative proportions of people who can be identified as Igbo, Ibibio, and other ethnic categories and, indeed, in the meaning of these categories, it does seem certain that most people came from the relatively densely populated areas immediately inland from the coast behind the Niger Delta. Although Portuguese and other European traders did acquire some enslaved Africans from the Bight of Biafra in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the overwhelming majority of people from the region left in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and especially in the century after circa 1730. The enigma is that it has been difficult to document this migration, the causes of enslavement, and any relevant political and economic factors that might explain the phenomenon and its timing. The reason for this difficulty relates to two factors. First, there is a paucity of documentary and oral sources that might be used in historical reconstruction for the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Second, there seems to be what might be called a “wall of silence” in the region about the past. Perhaps the lack of centralized institutions that can preserve details of the past explains this problem. There seem to be few historical benchmarks, such as the accession to office of political figures, their deaths, major battles, and such chronologically specific details that can be useful in historical reconstruction. There is historical memory, of course, but it is often connected with titled societies and associations that xxiii\n\nxxiv\n\nForeword\n\nrequire initiation and secrecy rather than the accumulation of knowledge about the chronological past. The political and social titles were related to positions of rank, but these are difficult to identify with specific individuals within a precise chronology. History tends to be telescoped, therefore, which has meant that historians have had to be innovative in attempting to provide a structure to analyze change over time. For these reasons, G. Ugo Nwokeji’s study of the Aro is important. One of the exceptions, the Aro have retained memories and traditions that help to establish a chronology for the interior of the Bight of Biafra. As the principal merchants in slaves and other commodities of long-distance trade, Aro merchants have left traditions of origin, settlement, and internal migration that coincide with the expansion of the slave trade in the Bight of Biafra. Nwokeji follows in the footsteps of K.O. Dike, F. Ekijuiba and David Northrup, whose pioneering work established the Aro role in the history of the Bight of Biafra. But the difficulty of historical reconstruction tied to a chronological framework plagued their research. By drawing on the latest estimates of the scale and timing of slave departures from the Bight of Biafra, Nwokeji is able to establish a chronology that can be correlated with Aro settlement patterns and oral traditions in the interior. The results of his analysis will be subject to debate and refinement, but the methodological breakthrough deserves notice. How are historians to deal with gaps in documentation and historical memory that is telescoped? Why is it that in some places there is a wealth of historical documentation, while in other places it is difficult to reconstruct the basic chronology of the past? It seems as if some societies and some eras want to remember and document events, whereas in other contexts, such detail is not considered necessary and perhaps is even not desirable. Does the effort to restrict knowledge as “secrets” of titled societies interfere with historical memory? Can we talk about the interior of the Bight of Biafra as an area that was “without history” in that historical details were secondary to the focus on attainment, as measured in titles and membership, in which inheritance and tradition were tailored to the future rather than to chronicling the past? How did such constructions of knowledge and society affect those who were taken to the Americas as slaves? Nwokeji attempts to confront these questions in a provocative new interpretation of the history of the interior of the Bight of Biafra.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nIn about 1733, Izuogu Mgbokpo, an Aro merchant from Arochukwu, in the Cross River region of what is now southeastern Nigeria, settled his people, or ndị (a generic term for offspring, henchmen, followers, clients, and slaves), on a major trade route located some 30 kilometers west of the upper Imo River in the densely populated central Igboland. Called Aro-ndi-Izuogu (Izuogu’s people’s Aro, conventionally written as Arondizuogu), this settlement eventually became the largest and most populous Aro settlement. Other Aro merchants soon established settlements farther northwest and in the densely populated part of Ibibioland south of Arochukwu. These merchants were part of an intricate network that accounted for the huge increase in the numbers of captives leaving the Bight of Biafra after 1740. Neighboring people supplied the Aro with produce, captives, and some porterage services, while the Aro, in turn, provided foreign goods, indicating the extent of the region’s entanglement with the emerging world economic system. Among these goods, guns and gunpowder came from various European centers, “george” cloth from the Netherlands and most other cloth from India, while tobacco was being produced in the Chesapeake Bay region in today’s United States, principally by Biafrans who had been exported as captives of the overseas traffic.1 1\n\nI reconstruct the foregoing detail from the following sources: NAE 81/27-OKIDIST 4/9/70; NAE OR/C/823-ORLDIST 3/1/359; NAE 12481A-MINLOC 16/1/1326; NAE OKIDIST 19/1/1 1908–25; NAE ORLDIST 14/1/3; NAE 35/1920-OKIDIST 4/2/32; NAE 38/22 OKIDIST 4/4/29; NAE CSE 1/85/6197A; Arodiogbu 1996; J.O.

Okoro\n\n1\n\n2\n\nSlave Trade and Culture in the Bight of Biafra\n\nThe Atlantic slave market provided attractive profits, but the Aro always ensured that they retained within their group many of the people they traded. As a small group, the Aro concentrated on group expansion and depended economically on slaves as both merchandise and laborers. Aro political contests, such as the civil wars and succession disputes, as well as such social facts as marriage, tribute, and the incest prohibition were deeply entangled with slaving. The people’s belief system and their media of worship were grounded in, and reinforced by, slaving-related processes. Their value system celebrated the ownership and proliferation of people and encouraged the sale of captives into Atlantic slavery. The decision regarding whom to send into Atlantic slavery and whom to retain was central to Aro political economy and, ipso facto, to this study. Aro slave trade involved both business and social engineering. The overwhelming majority of captives that Aro traders bought from the non-Aro people were random victims of war, kidnapping, and sundry methods but many were innocent. The Aro welcomed craftsmen, artists, medicine men, fortune seekers, refugees, and others who desired the prestige and protection that Aro citizenship conferred during that time. But even these noncaptive immigrants found that they could enter Aro society only as protected persons under Aro patrons – normally males – who were already well established there. The Aro concept of mmuba, meaning, at the most basic level, “proliferation,” captured the phenomenon of expansion. Aro oral history and folklore often refer to mmuba as an end in itself, but this ideology also encapsulated the people’s desire to increase the labor pool and to strengthen the Aro population for geopolitical purposes. By the mid-nineteenth century, the Aro world comprised more than 150 diaspora settlements across the Biafra hinterland. These communities celebrated common observances and maintained linkage institutions, such as the annual Ikeji festival, the Ekpe society, and the Ihu routine homage system. These institutions fostered and sustained a strong pan-Aro identity that facilitated Aro political interests and commercial hegemony. Yet, in spite of these linkage institutions, the Aro diaspora was susceptible to the cultural influence of host societies and\n\n1985:23–28; J.E. Uche 1996; Umo n.d. One enslaved African of Ibibio origin told German Moravian missionary Christian Georg Andreas Oldendorp in Pennsylvania in the late 1760s that the Aro, whose land “was not too far from [Ibibioland],” supplied the Ibibio with “riffles, sabres, powder, lead, linen, and the like” (Oldendorp 1987: 167).\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nof the societies from which the Aro drew immigrants. For example, an estimated more than 1 million inhabitants of the Aro settlements in central Igboland, the vast majority of whom descended from people who were not Aro 250 years ago, speak a dialect that deviates substantially from the one spoken in metropolitan Arochukwu.2 The frontierspeople also brought with them new media of worship and developed new taboos and even notions of class consciousness. These developments did not result simply from the routine domestication that is associated with frontier societies, colonists, or immigrant groups adapting to a new environment; they were also shaped by the Aro struggle to dominate trade in various parts of the Biafra hinterland. Ironically, while the Aro diaspora altered Aro ways, sometimes radically, the Aro nevertheless often remained aloof and distinct from the preexisting communities in their immediate neighborhood, ostensibly in order to maintain strict fidelity to Aro culture. After the trade in palm oil replaced the Atlantic slave trade in the midnineteenth century, most of the region’s food-producing groups devoted more of their efforts to the production of palm oil and palm kernel oil. Other groups became actively involved in the new trade, giving the Aro keener competition than they had had in the days of the overseas slave trade. These developments restructured the Aro economy and affected Aro relationships with the non-Aro. By the 1890s, the Aro had begun to produce foodstuffs for domestic consumption and, increasingly, for the market, while continuing to dominate what was left of the slave traffic, until the British Aro Expedition of 1901–02 overthrew the Aro and imposed a new order. The present study elaborates the foregoing story and situates it in Atlantic and regional contexts.\n\n2\n\nThis estimate is from a 1.5 percent compounded annual growth rate of 45,000 inhabitants in 1927 for Arondizuogu, by far the largest Aro diaspora settlement, plus a roughly equal number of inhabitants for the rest of Aro settlements in central Igboland. A 1927 estimate put Arondizuogu’s population at 30,000 (see NAE 81/27-OKIDIST 4/9/70. “Anthropological Report on Aros of Ndizuogu and Others”). The report itself shows that colonial officials made their estimate based on one part of the town alone, the part that fell into the Orlu District (making up most of the Arondizuogu territory west of the Imo), leaving out the part that fell into the Okigwe District (east of the Imo and some territory on the west bank). One 1935 report again covered only the Orlu part, as did the map accompanying it (see Mayne 1935). I have increased this figure to 45,000 because the 1927 estimate underrepresented the population after leaving out east-Imo Arondizuogu. This situation obviates any attempt to derive reliable census figures. Theresa Nwankwo (1991:10) has claimed that a 1931 census put the population at 180,000, which would drastically escalate present estimates. I have not seen this census.\n\n4\n\nSlave Trade and Culture in the Bight of Biafra\n\nMain Features, Organization, and Expansion of the Overseas Slave Trade Although the Biafra trade grew dramatically in the eighteenth century, it represented a small part of the overall African Atlantic trade before the 1740s. The region’s share of captives exported from all African regions combined was only 5.5 percentage points in the first half of the seventeenth century. Although there was an appreciable increase in trade in the third quarter of the seventeenth century, the Biafra trade quickly entered a long period of decline.3 By the 1670s, Bende, the principal slave mart in the Biafra hinterland, was already well established (Nwokeji 1997a). Captives leaving Bight of Biafra ports were carried mainly on English ships; some 80 percent of Biafra captives ended up in English America colonies during the eighteenth century.4 The region’s share of total African trade rose by 13.6 percentage points between the 1700s and the end of the century. Eighteenth-century British slave trader John Hippisley must have echoed his contemporaries’ sentiments when he wondered “how Africa [was] able to supply … such prodigious numbers” (Hippisley 1764:1). In the Bight of Biafra, the big surge in slave trade took place in the 1740s. The region exported an annual mean of about 13,800 captives between 1741 and 1800; that number increased to about 20,000 a year in the 1780s. Taking up only about 270 kilometers of coastline, the southeastern Nigerian portion of the Bight of Biafra was during this period the site of the most intensive slaving in Atlantic Africa, accounting for 90 3\n\n4\n\nExcept when otherwise stated, overall Biafra export figures are calculated from the Expanded Online Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database (Slavevoyages.org). There are many contending estimates. See Anstey 1975; Behrendt 1997; Curtin 1969, 1976; Eltis 1978, 1987, 1989b, 1995; Eltis and Richardson 1995a; Inikori 1976a, 1976b, 1978, 1992b; Lovejoy 1982b; Richardson 1989a, 1989b; Richardson and Behrendt 1995. See Henige 1986; Inikori 1994a, 1994b, 1998; Lovejoy 1989; and Manning 1998b for analyses of the historiography. For the Biafra Atlantic slave trade to 1700, see Thornton 1999. John Thornton states: “Undoubtedly … the greatest source of slaves for New Calabar [then the dominant port] was the Igbo-speaking region” (11). As early as 1627, Spanish missionary priest Alonso de Sandoval reported that Caravalies, as Biafra captives were then called, were “innumerable” in Spanish America and spoke a variety of tongues (de Sandoval [1627] 1956:94, 96). A 1790s British House of Lords survey shows that the Bight of Biafra and West-Central Africa accounted for 78 percent of all captives arriving in Jamaica from known African ports. This pattern reflects that of other English colonies. Between these two regions, the Bight of Biafra exported more (H. Klein 1978, 147–48, 150, 173). It accounted for 40 percent of all British purchases just before abolition in 1807 (Law and Lovejoy 1996).\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\npercent of the region’s overseas trade. The mid-century surge had implications for Biafra’s major ports. Bonny, serving mainly the trade from the Igbo heartland, superseded Old Calabar as the region’s preeminent port between 1726 and 1750; by 1750 it was the single busiest slaving port in Africa north of the Equator. Turnaround rates at Biafra’s ports also became significantly shorter than they were elsewhere. Indeed, the 1740s marked a turning point in the Biafra Atlantic trade. By the third quarter of the century, the “trust” system, by which Europeans advanced goods to African merchants on credit, had been well established (Lovejoy and Richardson 1997, 1999). In addition to this extraordinary expansion of trade, the Bight of Biafra exported higher proportions of females than any other major coastal region. This characteristic deviated from the focus of New World demand, which tilted heavily toward males. To properly understand these unique features of the Biafra Atlantic slave trade, a close examination of the institutions and processes that underpinned the trade in Africa is imperative.5 The Nigerian section of the Bight of Biafra was home to numerous ethnolinguistic groups. The Igbo and Ibibio people predominated in the region south of the Benue River, known today as southeastern Nigeria. These two groups had long provided most of the export captives.6 Germanborn Moravian missionary Christian Georg Andreas Oldendorp reported a substantial Igbo and Ibibio presence in the Caribbean and North America during the late 1760s. By the mid-eighteenth century, Biafrans had become the largest African group in the Chesapeake.7 They were also a substantial presence in the British Caribbean. Most of the captives exported from Biafra – some 70 percent, according to most estimates – passed through the Aro network (K.O. Dike and Ekejiuba 1990, 250; Ijoma and Njoku 1991:300). The Aro were also the largest slaveholders in the hinterland. More than any other group, they were linked directly to region-wide institutions. Along with the coastal city state of Old Calabar and Cross River Igbo warrior groups, the Aro participated in 5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nEltis 1986; Eltis and Engerman 1992, 1993; Galenson 1986:97–114; Geggus 1989:37–38, 40–41; Inikori 1992a; H.

The Aro controlled the Ibiniukpabi oracle, which served as the highest court of appeal, including for the coastal city-states and communities on the west side of the Niger River. Further, they maintained alliances with Cross River Igbo warrior communities that facilitated Aro wars in different parts of the region, operated the region’s rotational slave fairs, and zoned virtually all parts of the region to individual Aro lineage-groups as spheres of influence (mbia). Overseeing these mbia on a day-to-day basis were a variety of permanent diaspora settlements corresponding to the respective Aro lineage-groups. These settlements ranged from small, peacefully established Aro presences within preexisting non-Aro lineagegroups to large conquest settlements. The existence of Aro settlements in areas separated by distance, language, and cultural practices within the Biafra hinterland was an Aro hallmark. In spite of this highly visible role, Aro organization and its basic chronology are still in need of integration into Atlantic scholarship. Perhaps the most promising line of inquiry is to relate Aro expansion to the expansion of the Biafra Atlantic trade and to explain the correlation of the two processes. Aro expansion occurred in four main phases. The first phase – lasting from the beginning of the seventeenth century to the end of the 1730s – witnessed the consolidation of the Arochukwu metropole, the establishment of Aro influence in the Cross River Region, the foundation of the principal market at Bende, Aro forays into Ibibioland and central Igboland, and the rise of Old Calabar (the city closest to Arochukwu) as Biafra’s principal port. The second phase – beginning in about 1740 – witnessed great expansion in the Biafra export slave trade, the establishment of Aro settlements in the Biafran hinterland, and Bonny’s supersession of Old Calabar as Biafra’s principal port. This period ended in 1808 when the British, carriers of some 80 percent of Biafra captives, abolished slave traffic. The third phase of Aro expansion began in 1808, following British abolition, to the end of the Atlantic slave trade by 1850, the region’s deeper involvement in the overseas palm oil trade, and the expansion of the domestic slave market. The fourth and final phase began in the 1850s and ended in 1902, when the British 8\n\nThis society took the name Okonko in other areas, such as the Niger delta states and southern Igboland where the Aro exported this institution. The role of this variant of the society comes out most clearly in the work of John Oriji (Oriji 1982, 1983). The examination of the role of the Ekpe society as an agency of slave procurement awaits future research.\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nconquered Arochukwu. By the 1890s, the Aro had vigorously embraced agriculture in an effort to minimize the pangs of the world depression in the oils trade and to cope with their food needs. Along with a host of domestic social implications, Aro adoption of agriculture generated conflicts when the group expanded into agricultural regions at the expense of the preexisting communities. The Aro case highlights the interconnectedness of major changes in the Bight of Biafra with changes in the overseas trade and its aftermath over three centuries.\n\nThe Aro in the Historiography of the Biafra Slave Trade The literature of the Bight of Biafra slave trade has often dealt separately with the hinterland and coastal sections of the region rather than considering the two in their relationship within the Atlantic system. This tendency has impeded the effective study of the region’s involvement in the Atlantic slave trade. Consequently, Joseph Inikori has lamented the neglect of the region in the production of studies dealing with the Atlantic slave trade, despite a massive surge in captive export there in the second half of the eighteenth century (Inikori 1994a:9). The literature of the Atlantic slave trade has dealt with the coastal states rather than the hinterland, even though much of the trade was subject to influences from the hinterland, while the work dealing with the hinterland did not actively link the Aro to the Atlantic context.9 Aro historiography effectively began in the mid-nineteenth century, when Europeans and Sierra Leone–based African returnees from Atlantic slavery traveled the Niger River and began to pay special attention to the Aro. Based mostly on hearsay, their reports focused on Aro omnipresence in the region via trade and/or oracular activities.10 British attention to the Aro and efforts to suppress them left a trove of paperwork, ensuring that Anglo-Aro relations and the Aro role in the domestic slave trade during the postoverseas slave trade era – rather than the overseas trade itself – loom large in the historiography. Interest in the Aro continued into the early colonial period, although much of the colonial-era literature was nonhistorical. Even the historical work that 9\n\n10\n\nFor studies dealing with the Atlantic slave trade with a focus on coastal states, see Alagoa 1964, 1970, 1971a, 1971b, 1972, 1986; Cookey 1974; Hargreaves 1987; Latham 1973; Nair 1972; Noah 1980; Wariboko 1991.

Instead, it concentrated on Aro origins (G.I. Jones 1939:101). In tune with the Hamitic hypothesis – the tendency to attribute “civilizations” found in Africa to descendants of the Biblical Ham – the British seemed bent on locating external provenance for the Aro, one that would ultimately be linkable to Caucasian influence. The resulting theories of Aro origins were so speculative that historian Adiele Afigbo has insisted on putting them on the same footing as Aro sagas. Afigbo’s analysis has itself come under severe criticism, illustrating the continued interest in the subject.11 Major Arthur Leonard’s firsthand account of the Aro market at Bende during 1896 was the first published work on the Aro. While Leonard provided useful glimpses into a changing Aro society, as a harbinger of British invasion, he was interested mainly in immediate strategic matters (Leonard 1898). Several British military officers generated useful ethnographic information in a round of publications that appeared in the wake of the Aro Expedition of 1901–02.12 The multivolume work by colonial officer and anthropologist Amaury Talbot, published in 1926, provided equal measures of useful and chimerical information on Aro organization.13 In the 1920s and 1930s, the colonial government commissioned “intelligence” and anthropological reports that produced significant knowledge of the Aro.14 From the 1930s through the 1960s, local historians and other scholars in many communities in the region did much spadework.15 The aforementioned sources did not, however,\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14 15\n\nAfigbo (1971b, 31; 1972a). Afigbo’s critique has, with some justification, been termed a stretch (Nwauwa 1995, 110). As made clear in Chapter 2, however, Afigbo’s comments on the genealogies collected by colonial administrators should be taken seriously. A.G.

For an illuminating scholarly account of Aro-British relations up until the invasion, see Anene 1959. Instances of the latter category are his claims that the Aro were of Carthaginian provenance and that they ran a theocracy (Talbot 1926a:183; 1926b:50, 52, 338; 1926c: 592, 821).

Serious historical inquiry into the Aro role in regional trade, however, began with the seminal work of historian K. Onwuka Dike. Although he focused on the coastal trading states, Dike referred to the Aro as the “economic dictators of the hinterland,” and emphasized the role of their oracle, Ibiniukpabi (K.O. Dike 1956:38). The role of oracles in Igbo social organization has since been studied, as have the workings of Aro influence and the importance of Ibiniukpabi, leading to the finding that this oracle was not a major source of captives (S. Ottenberg 1958; 1971:24–26).16 It was, however, the former British colonial officer and anthropologist G.I. Jones who began to place the Aro in a regional chronological framework. Based on the traditions of the coastal port states, Jones suggested that the Aro had been formed by the mid-seventeenth century (Jones 1963, 134). This means that the Aro had been well established by the eighteenth century when the Biafra Atlantic trade became prominent. Together, the aforementioned works established the significance of the Aro in the region’s political economy and commercial history. Unfortunately, however, these important contributions did not stimulate scholarship in the hinterland. Systematic analysis of hinterland trade began during the late 1960s. The genealogy of this historiography starts with regional geographer Ukwu I. Ukwu’s pioneering study of the regional marketing system, trade routes, and delivery systems. Ukwu identified the conscious coordination of diaspora settlements with fairs and trade routes as the distinctive feature of the Aro system (Ukwu 1967:1969). His work foreshadowed the scholarly interest in regional trade, as well as in Aro operations and the institutions that underpinned them, that developed during the 1970s. Similar studies proliferated in the early 1970s (Ekejiuba 1972a, 1972b; Northrup 1972; Ofonagoro 1972). Further, Afigbo mapped the extent of regional trade and highlighted the hitherto neglected trade links between southeastern Nigeria and the Middle Belt to the north, complementing extant studies on Igbo–Middle Belt relations.17 It is noteworthy that the relevant scholarship of the late 1960s and early 1970s concentrated on trading mechanisms, trade routes, goods, and supply systems. It had little to say on the implications of these processes for politics, culture, and social organization. 16\n\n17\n\nK.O. Dike and Ekejiuba 1990, 250; Ekejiuba 1972b, 12; J.O.

Elizabeth Isichei’s (1973, 1976:49–67) work dealing with Igbo history was the most notable example of this trend. The underlying theme of Isichei’s work is transformations in the Igbo social economy. She traces the process by which trade-induced migrations between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries helped to shape modern Igboland. The efforts of many other scholars – university thesis authors, nonprofessional local historians of increasing sophistication, and professional historians – have since further clarified our understanding of this process through a plethora of cases studies. These contributions did not, however, relate Aro expansion to the Atlantic slave trade.18 In their study of West Africa as whole, historians Paul Lovejoy and Jan Hogendorn see the rise of the Biafra Atlantic trade in the mid-eighteenth century as the culmination of four developments: expansion in the structure and organization of the coastal states; the role of the Ekpe society in guaranteeing credit; the division of the lower Niger trade among the Ijo and the Niger riverine states; and the consolidation of the Aro network in the hinterland (Lovejoy and Hogendorn 1979:225–31). Lovejoy and Hogendorn’s critical insight that the African slave trade was organized around self-conscious regional cartels has received implicit support from empirical findings about the institutional basis of the Aro network in southern Igboland (Oriji 1982, 1983, 1987). Because Lovejoy and Hogendorn’s study did not primarily focus on the Bight of Biafra, it did not resolve the important question of the timing of the developments they identified, an essential step in establishing the extent to which the trading groups caused or resulted from them. The developments may have been repercussions of major environmental and geopolitical changes in latesixteenth- and early-seventeenth-century West Africa, as Robert Sargent has argued (Sargent 1999:15–20). One common limitation of the Biafra literature is that, while gender relations in the societies of the region have sometimes received attention, the gender structure of the Atlantic slave trade has suffered neglect, even though it has long been discernible to scholars not primarily focused in 18\n\nFor examples of pertinent studies done by professional historians, see Afigbo 1977, 1981a, 1981b, 1987; Ifemesia 1978, 1979; Ijoma and O.N.

Yet, the Bight of Biafra is of particular interest in understanding African conceptions of gender. If, in other regions, the Euro-American drive to secure men was only partially successful, it all but broke down in the Bight of Biafra. In this region, the character of African warfare and the role of women in the indigenous economy and in social institutions shaped the age and gender structure of the slave trade differently from elsewhere. Key elements in this process were African conceptions of slavery and the division of labor, reproduction in the context of the lineage, polygyny, and methods of enslavement. Because of the failure to tie the Biafra trade to its Atlantic context, the implications for the aforementioned processes of the Aro being the preeminent trading group remain unexplored. Despite its limitations, the scholarship since the mid-1970s has represented two significant shifts. First, it reintegrated trade with its politics in the manner Onwuka Dike enunciated in 1956. Some scholars now argue that the Aro dominated regional trade precisely because they developed strong state structures (see also K.O. Dike and Ekejiuba 1978, 1990; Ijoma 1986b; Stevenson 1968). Second, this scholarship located the Aro within the region-wide socioeconomic process. The Aro phenomenon became central to the analysis of the regional political economy.\n\nState and Diaspora If there is a consensus about the Aro role in regional political economy, the exact character of their social organization has been the subject of fierce debate among specialists, best exemplified in David Northrup’s Trade without Rulers (1978) and Onwuka Dike and Felicia Ekejiuba’s The Aro of Southeastern Nigeria (1990). Each of these studies has been up until now the basic reference on its subject – Northrup’s on regional trade and Dike and Ekejiuba’s on Aro political economy, two themes that are central to this study. Because these studies share a key concern with Aro organization, the questions they raise are essential to the present study. 19\n\nFor gender relations in the region, see Hargreaves 1987; Martin 1988, 1995; Oriji 1982. For studies that have commented on the gender structure, see Eltis 1986, 1998; Eltis and Engerman 1992, 1993; Eltis and Richardson 1997; Geggus 1989; Inikori 1992a; H. Klein 1983, 35–37; Manning 1998a.\n\n12\n\nSlave Trade and Culture in the Bight of Biafra\n\nLike the present study, Northrup’s admirable and meticulously researched work attempts to explain the existence of a complex commercial structure in a region where decentralized political arrangements were the norm. In a chapter titled “The God Men of the Slave Trade,” Northrup correctly observes that the Aro were neither the only nor the oldest trading group in the region, but that they transcended and combined “into a single marketing grid the already existing regional networks of trade through alliances with other leading trading people to bring them into this economic structure” (Northrup 1978, 142). Northrup argues that the people of the region evolved this complex commercial organization without corresponding complex political institutions. The uncommon nature of Aro organization does in fact invite scrutiny. Perhaps the most conspicuous question mark on Aro statehood is the fact that many Aro wars were indeed orchestrated and prosecuted by Aro lineages and, increasingly, by individual merchant-warriors, rather than the Aro as a whole. This was certainly not the case with such prominent West African states as Benin, Dahomey, Asante, and even Oyo in its heyday.20 Northrup’s argument refreshingly departs from state-centric approaches to the study of precolonial African history by making a genuine attempt to study and understand noncentralized societies on their own terms. Indeed, the existence of states was not essential to the development of the slave trade. Northrup insists, however, that Aro organization closely resembled that of the rest of the Igbo. For him, the Aro “differed more by degree than by kind” because they depended on, rather than transcended, the segmentary organization that pervaded the region. He points to brutal intra-Aro disputes as evidence of the weakness of Aro political organization, and to their supposed lack of “substantial state structures and military force” as being responsible for their “inability to break through to the coast to trade directly with European ships” (Northrup 1978:137, 139, 140–42, 145). Such far-reaching assertions deserve scrutiny given that more evidence on Aro institutions has percolated in the more than thirty years since Northrup’s remarkable work first appeared; that interest in questions about the state persists; and that Aro organization and regional trade are pivotal to the present study.21 20\n\n21\n\nThis observation has been confirmed by Martin Klein’s recent survey of slaving in decentralized societies, of which the Igbo region provides a prime example (M. Klein 2001, 63). Peter Ekeh has gone as far as arguing that slaving was actually heaviest in decentralized societies (Ekeh 1990:680–82). Although the Aro were central to Northrup’s work, his respondents were overwhelmingly Ibibio (Nwauwa 1995:114). Northrup’s interviews with Aro people, although not\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nTo argue that politics played an insignificant role in Aro organization is to separate economics from politics. It is not otherwise possible to claim both that local alliances were indispensable to Aro organization and that Aro expansion was economic, not political, as Northrup has done (Northrup 1978:121, 142).22 Aro alliances have been widely linked to Aro warfare precisely because they were a political phenomenon.23 The reality of social existence can be more complicated than the heuristic distinctions scholars may seek to make between the concepts of trade and politics. The people of the Bight of Biafra and, indeed, the rest of Atlantic Africa, did not distinguish the political, spiritual, and material aspects of their life as sharply as these categories imply at first sight. Aro “inability to break through to the coast” and intra-Aro conflicts have no necessary connection with state structures. A polity’s ability and/or disposition to conquer all states in a given region is not a precondition for a state. The Aro, in fact, experienced many more disputes than Northrup highlighted, but such disputes do not necessarily mean the absence of state structures; conflicts occur in all societies.24 Political philosophers tell us that cooperation, competition, and conflict normally characterize relations within the “political class” (see, e.g., Bottomore 1964:9). Much more than in the Aro case, brutal civil wars visited eighteenth-century Kongo Kingdom, often resulting in the overthrow of constituted authority, decimation of the population of the capital, and its recolonization with out-of-province people (Thornton 1992). Yet, the appeal of Kongo political institutions and the legitimacy of the capital remained intact. As Northrup himself recognizes, the “ability to achieve voluntary agreement in time of crisis was the key to Aro organization,” and their tendency to set up permanent diaspora settlements and commitment to a common identity distinguished them from other groups (Northrup 1978b:104, 140, 142, 143). Contrary to Northrup’s claim, the diasporic characteristic\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\nalways indicated or necessarily borne out by respondents’ names, are self-evident in the content of the interviews. In my estimation, seven of Northrup’s forty interviews were among the Aro. They are Asiegbu 1973; Inokun 1972; Merem and Nwankwo 1973; K. Oji 1972; F.E.S. Okoro 1973; Okori 1972; J. Udo 1972. For the transcripts, see Northrup 1972–73. Northrup argues that the Aro were a political force only in Afikpo in Cross River Igboland but were only economic imperialists elsewhere (Northrup 1978b, 121). Such a distinction is unstainable given that such settlements as Inokun, Arondizuogu, and the Ndieni cluster dominated both economic and political affairs. Bentor 1994:104–08; K.O. Dike and Ekejiuba 1990:165–71, 174–86; Isichei 1976:82–87. See, for example, K.O. Dike and Ekejiuba 1990:180–81; Igwegbe 1962:15–16, 43, 46–47, 91–93, 114–19; J.G. Okoro 1985:40–42.\n\n14\n\nSlave Trade and Culture in the Bight of Biafra\n\nof the Aro was a difference in kind, not simply of degree. The Aro were the only group in the region that deliberately and consistently established settlements abroad for the purposes of trade that were tied to the homeland through systemwide institutions. Fitting the Aro tightly into a stateless mold merely draws from and reinforces the idealized notions of Igbo segmentarism rampantly assumed in the literature.25 A detailed study of the Niger riverine states of Abo, Oguta, Onitsha, and Osomari revealed that generalizations about an Igbo political framework are only meaningful after each Igbo “cultural area” has been studied in detail (Nzimiro 1972). Such research as has been carried out in the past forty years or so no longer sustains the idea that the region lacked rulers, or what Northrup (1981) called a “ruling class.”26 For example, after examining the empirical evidence the members of a multidisciplinary panel of Igbo social scientists generated, a colloquy declared in 1986: “It will probably come as a surprise to many of us, nurtured as we are on the principle [that is] now clearly under severe pressure that Igbo enwegh eze (the Igbo have no king), to learn that in traditional Igboland the ultimate authority figure was very often a monarch of some kind” (Ahiajoku Lecture Colloquium 1986:ii). The fact that the region had many rulers is not evidence that it had none (Afigbo 1981b). We cannot understand indigenous slavery and the Atlantic slave trade by laying undue emphasis on leveling structures. The power held by some individuals in the region over others determined people’s fate – whether they would be enslaved and, if so, whether they would be enslaved within the region or sent to the Americas. Some of the most effective arguments against overemphasis on leveling mechanisms come from Dike and Ekejiuba, who focus on stratification and state institutions, as these characteristics concerned the historical development of trade in the region. They insist that analyzing what the Aro did, instead of pinpointing what they did not do, is more useful in determining the true nature of their political organization. The ultimate measure of Aro hegemony should emerge from a comparison with regional polities unanimously acknowledged to have evolved state structures: the Middle Belt Igala kingdom suffered decentralization, disintegration, and defections; Bonny (Biafra’s premier port state) split after a\n\n25\n\n26\n\nMeek 1937; Green 1964; Carlston 1968:190–210; Echeruo 1979; Horton 1976; Henderson 1972; Nwaubani 1994.

Decentralization and disaggregation usually happened to states – including Arochukwu – as a result of trade (K.O. Dike and Ekejiuba 1990:81, 83–85). Dike and Ekejiuba periodize the history of the Aro state into three phases – the pre-1650 period, the post-1650 period, and the nineteenth century. The pre-1650 period corresponded with the segmentary lineage system usually ascribed to the entire Aro history. The period after 1650 was when King Akuma initiated state building, when primogeniture prevailed, and Omu Aro (Aro coat of arms) was introduced as a symbol of central authority.27 Finally, the nineteenth century witnessed the accommodation of ethnic heterogeneity and a “dynamic response” to external regions, such as “the absence of a centralized power to challenge and compete with the Aro in the control of the [trade] of the vast hinterland” (K.O. Dike and Ekejiuba 1990:81–82, 96–103, 123). The existence of spheres of influence among the respective Aro lineagegroups is characteristic of state organization. Yet, it is unlikely that the Aro had a high degree of centralization at any point in their history. For instance, if the wars that produced Aro settlements resulted from the initiatives and efforts of “a handful of Aro households,” as Dike and Ekejiuba posit, these settlements can hardly have simultaneously been private enterprises and state-sponsored projects (K.O. Dike and Ekejiuba 1990:165). The crucial point perhaps is that Aro expansion up to the early eighteenth century was state sponsored – as illustrated in the appointment in a newly settled area of a resident Mazi (Consul), usually a trusted confidant of the Aro king (K.O. Dike and Ekejiuba 1990:69) – but had become the responsibility of private individuals just before mid-eighteenth century. This change perhaps resulted from the rapid proliferation of diaspora settlements and the concomitant expansion of the Bight of Biafra slave trade. This scenario contrasts sharply with Dike and Ekejiuba’s own characterization of a trend toward 27\n\nOkoro Kanu stresses Eze Agwu before Akuma was the first Aro to be addressed as “Eze” as a title rather than a first name (Okoro Kanu 2000:15). Possibly, “Eze” was his first name but because he turned out to be – in the words of Kanu – a “powerful” and “accomplished ruler,” the largely acephalous Igbo adopted the name as a title to refer to a person who exhibited authoritarian power, barring contrary evidence from elsewhere in Igboland, notably Nri. Scholars are unsure of when such an institution emerged in Nri, but they generally suggest a date much later than indicated by ninth-century artifacts suggesting concentration of power in the hands of an individual or individuals. While M. Angulu Onwuejeogwu asserts that the institution of Eze Nri did not emerge until “the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries,” Thurstan Shaw suggests the end of the fifteenth century (Onwuejeogwu 1975:49; Shaw 1978:124).\n\n16\n\nSlave Trade and Culture in the Bight of Biafra\n\nincreased centralization. Further, placing too much emphasis on a high degree of centralization overstates the “assimilation” of immigrants and slaves into Aro culture. While immigrant assimilation was crucial to the Aro system, overemphasizing it obscures the profound impact that the incorporated groups made on Aro culture, especially in the diaspora.28 Finally, the penchant for the centralized-state model promotes reference to Aro settlements as “colonies,” a term that fails to capture Aro communities in their variety and complexities. However, as is typical of the debate about precolonial African political organization, which seems to assume that despotism is an essential state characteristic, the aforementioned studies share a fixation with the presence or absence of a centralized state. A state is effectively assumed to be present wherever despotism exists and absent where it is lacking. While Northrup showed successfully that nothing of the kind existed in the region, he equates this absence with the absence of state structures. On the other hand, political theorist Robert Stevenson who, like Northrup, could not locate a despotic regime, lamented that, although the Aro developed a state, it was not “full blown” (Stevenson 1968). Finally, Dike and Ekejiuba constructed an early autocratic state that never was. Rather than accept the proliferation of settlements as an essential feature of a trade diaspora in the context of expanding trade, they bemoan the fact that this development “eroded the monopoly of power by the central government” (K.O. Dike and Ekejiuba 1990:72). A high degree of centralization is not a necessary attribute of a state and was not necessary for Aro expansion. Social scientists have only recently begun to realize that the functions and effects of states – including the most powerful ones – are enacted outside “institutionalized politics and established bureaucracies” (see Trouillot 2001:133). Like Michel Rolf–Trouillot, who made this observation, some scholars may perhaps view this as a characteristic specific to the state in the age of globalization; but states have exhibited this characteristic for ages. One can speak of an Aro state. The anthropologist Ronald Cohen offers a simple but nuanced insight into state theory, which is relevant to this argument. For Cohen, the distinguishing characteristic of a state is “the formation and development of institutions counteracting the normal fissioning of the polity,” and he holds that “if a society fissions as a 28\n\nJudith Okely (1996) has reiterated the pitfalls of the nondialectical characterization of culture contact.\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\nnormal or expectable part of political process,” it is not a state, regardless of the central government’s continuing ability to enforce decisions. This is because states are “highly adaptive,” irrespective of the location or specific characteristics of its constituent parts (R. Cohen 1981:81, 87, 92, 95). The Aro fit neatly into this formulation. Critically important is the fact that no Aro groups ever seceded from the Aro fold at any point in Aro history, in spite of their dispersion. The operations of specific Aro institutions that promoted Aro interests and enabled the state to counteract fissioning are analyzed in the following chapters. Even though one can speak of an Aro state, however, the key to understanding Aro organization and regional trade is not the presence of a state system or, for that matter, its absence, but in seeing the Aro as a trade diaspora. Although so far ignored in regional literature, the systematic study of trade diasporas has been growing since the late 1960s.29 What Northrup described merely as Aro “predilection for commerce” or “skill and single-mindedness” was, as anthropologist Abner Cohen (1969:9, 98) illustrates with the Hausa experience, “not associated with a basic personality trait, but with a highly developed economico-political organization.” Placing Aro settlements in the context of a trade diaspora throws light on crucial aspects of trade organization, commercial politics, institutional change, and cultural development. Thus, neither the variation in the sizes of Aro diaspora communities nor their mode of organization was fundamentally peculiar. These elements made them a diaspora and gave the Aro a distinct advantage in regional trade. “In short,” writes Abner Cohen, who originated the concept of trade diasporas, a diaspora “is a nation of socially interdependent, but spatially dispersed, communities” (A. Cohen 1971:267). If there is a dominant theme to Aro history, it ought to emerge from a systematic understanding of trade diasporas, not in the existence or absence of a centralized-state system. The concept of the trade diaspora has theoretical significance because trade diasporas are a universal phenomenon (Curtin 1975:62–63; 1984). They exist today in the form that modern economic anthropologists refer to as ethnically homogenous middleman groups (EHMGs) (see, e.g., Landa 1994). The Aro trading network was, therefore, a cultural phenomenon. Anthropologist Karl Polanyi was correct in observing that the market is only one of, and susceptible to, “a great variety of institutions” that 29\n\nBaier 1980:57–67; A. Cohen 1969, 1971; Curtin 1971b, 1975, 1984; Eades 1993; Lovejoy 1980:28–45; 1982a; Lovejoy and Hogendorn 1979; Meillassoux 1971a; Roberts 1987.\n\n18\n\nSlave Trade and Culture in the Bight of Biafra\n\nunderpin human existence.30 Thus, this study takes into account, not only the market mechanisms, but also the geocultural context and implications of the slave trade. The Aro diaspora presents a challenge for contemporary Igbo and Nigerian cultural studies. The settlements are incompatible with the existing taxonomies of Igbo subcultural areas. Daryll Forde and G.I. Jones identify five subcultural groups for the Igbo: northern, or Onitsha; southern, or Owerri; western; eastern, or Cross River; and northeastern (Forde and Jones 1950). This spatial framework has advanced regional cultural studies, but it is singularly inadequate for understanding the Aro cultural experience. It restricts Aro settlements to Igboland, whereas many Aro settlements existed and still exist in non-Igbo areas, such as Idomaland, Igalaland, and Ibibioland. Inokun in Ibibioland was one of the largest Aro settlements. Second, the Forde-Jones taxonomy locates the “Aro” in the eastern or Cross River subgroup where the Aro metropole of Arochukwu is located, and places Aro diaspora settlements in the cultural categories of their respective vicinities. This framework implies that Aro settlements lacked cultural personalities and had completely assimilated into neighboring subcultures. Also, by not applying the Aro cultural category to these Aro settlements, the taxonomy unwittingly collapses Aro (a group) with Arochukwu (a place). Perhaps, a more appropriate taxonomy is the one, advanced by Afigbo, based on interregional variations in the manifestations of pan-Igbo achievement norms. For Afigbo, two distinctive ways by which rewards and recognition were allocated to individuals sprouted two subcultures – Igbo-Ọzọ, which emphasized title – taking, prominently the Ọzọ, and Igbo-Abamaba, which emphasized membership of secret societies (Afigbo 1991d). The Aro diaspora, like the homeland, clearly falls into the latter category. Although this taxonomy is based on more measurable criteria and does not claim to embrace all Igbo communities, it shares the focus in Forde-Jones’s model in “areas” and so places different Aro settlements in different “culture areas”. In short, the aforementioned taxonomies ignore the distinctiveness of the Aro. Certainly, the Aro factor renders futile any attempt to subdivide Igboland into subculture “areas” and to straitjacket the Aro into being one more Igbo group. There is a distinction between the terms “Arochukwu” and “Aro,” and recognizing this distinction is crucial to understanding the Aro. Arochukwu is a place, and Aro refers to a people and/or their culture 30\n\nPolanyi 1957:245–46; Polanyi et al. 1957b:241; Bohannan and Bohannan 1968:220; Curtin 1984:14; Ekkehart 1998.\n\nIntroduction\n\n19\n\nfound in many Igbo and non-Igbo locations, including Arochukwu. This distinction is distinguishable from art historian Eli Bentor’s claim that the Aro diaspora has little cultural similarity with the Aro metropole. For Bentor, Aro is primarily an identity – a way in which groups of people represent(ed) themselves, rather than a cultural reference per se – and the cultural and linguistic forms of Aro settlements are similar to the communities in their immediate neighborhoods (Bentor 1994). By implication, the Aro diaspora settlements cannot be located within an Aro cultural frame and are not even a diaspora. Like Forde and Jones’s approach, Bentor’s glosses over the cultural dimension of Aro-ness, a conclusion he derived primarily from his observations of masquerading in Arondizuogu – the most spectacular aspect of the Aro annual Ikeji festival in the late twentieth century. Bentor is correct in observing that deviations from Arochukwu practices are particularly striking in masquerading, which is a “a complex mixture of Aro, local, and innovative cultural practices” (Bentor 1994:211).31 However, this observation does not warrant conflating Aro diaspora cultures and those of their neighbors or a conception of Aro-ness defined solely in identity terms. Rather, it underscores the persistence of aspects of Aro cultural practices, despite the incorporation of non-Aro ways. This was the case for both homeland and diaspora; the Ikeji festival is in itself a pan-Aro institution, which by virtue of its inherent yam reverence was rooted in Igbo culture. The performance aspects of Ikeji may have changed in the diaspora, but the rituals remained essentially the same as in the homeland during the twentieth century. The most radical observation possible is that “Aro” is primarily an identity and secondarily a cultural reference, but as Ikeji rituals show, the cultural dimension has remained significant. Culture was thus a principal element of Aro-ness. The development of the Aro culture was tied to the history of the Atlantic slave trade.\n\nPerspective The rise and expansion of the Aro was the key influence that shaped the character of the Biafra Atlantic slave trade. Aro incursions into the densely populated Igbo heartland and the establishment there of their most important settlements in about the mid-eighteenth century coincided with the steady increase observed in the Biafra trade during this 31\n\nFor the Ikeji festival, also see K. Ike 1972; C. Okafor 1986:127–28; N. Okoli 1972 and for masquerading in Igboland, see Nwabueze 1984.\n\n20\n\nSlave Trade and Culture in the Bight of Biafra\n\ntime. The establishment of Aro frontiers in close proximity to the densely populated Nri-Awka region coincided with another major shift in the Biafra Atlantic slave trade; centrally located Bonny superseded easterly Old Calabar as Biafra’s premier port during 1726–50. No previous studies have made the foregoing claims. The 1726–50 estimate locates the time of this change more firmly than the recent estimate of 1730–79 offered by Lovejoy and Richardson (2004, 368–72). The shift of major activity from Old Calabar to Bonny has been attributed to developments in the port states and, especially, to the preferences of Euro-American buyers (Hargreaves 1987; Latham 1973). So also are “important political advantages at Bonny in credit security, commercial efficiency and the promotion of impersonal exchanges” (Lovejoy and Richardson 2004, 372). While these developments at Bonny are important, they provide at best a partial explanation for the shift. In actual fact, the shift in the relative importance of the ports, the dramatic growth in the Biafra trade, and higher volumes of captives largely reflected changes in existing trade routes that accompanied the establishment of the Aro diaspora settlements in densely populated central Igboland. Several of these communities were unusually large. Arondizuogu and the Ndieni cluster (including Ujari, now Ajali, and Ndikelionwu) on the banks of the Mamu River were established virtually contemporaneously and through violence in the mid-eighteenth century.32 Inokun in Ibibioland was the only other Aro settlement that shared all these characteristics. This expansion followed such seventeenth-century internal developments as consolidation of Arochukwu in the Cross River region, the formation of the Niger riverine states, and the expansion of the coastal states and changes in their organization, including the introduction of the credit-regulating Ekpe society in Old Calabar.33 This study is self-consciously interactive, highlighting relationships between the Aro and the rest of the region, between the Bight of Biafra and the rest of Atlantic Africa, and between Atlantic Africa and external\n\n32\n\n33\n\nNdieni is a cluster of several Aro settlements on the northeastern fringes of the NriAwka region in present Anambra State. The rest of Ndieni more or less proliferated from Ujari and Ndikerionwu (Ndikelionwu) over time. For example, Ndiokwaraeze proliferated from Ujari when the descendants of Ujari’s founder’s first son Okwareze and their dependents and clients left Ujari to establish it. Another Ndieni settlement Ndiowuu proliferated when the descendants of Owuu Mgboro and his people, who had existed as an appendage of Ndikerionwu, left Ndikerionwu to establish it (see Eni 1973:19–21). Old Calabar adopted Ekpe “as early as the seventeenth century” from the Ekoi (Aye 1967:70).\n\nIntroduction\n\n21\n\nregions – trans-Atlantic and trans-Saharan. Without suggesting that Aro history is synonymous with the history of the Bight of Biafra, West Africa at large, or the external world, it can be said that Aro history makes sense only in the context of regional and Atlantic history. Aro expansion took form within the framework of the political economy of the Bight of Biafra and West Africa, and it correlates with the expansion of the Atlantic trade. The Aro were associated with region-wide institutions, were central to regional commerce, and incorporated persons from virtually every part of the Bight of Biafra. The Aro were affected by economic, environmental, and political change that originated elsewhere in West Africa and beyond.34 These identifiable sociocultural processes in the hinterland accompanied and mutually complemented the rise and expansion of the Biafra slave trade, and shaped its composition.\n\n34\n\nFred Cooper (1996) has explicated the interactive approach, distinguishing it from the comparative method. Sargent (1999) has shown how environmental, economic, and political change in one place in West Africa could affect other regions.\n\n2 The Aro in the Atlantic Context Expansion and Shifts, 1600s–1807\n\nThe dramatic rise of the slave trade in the Bight of Biafra during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was remarkable, notwithstanding the dense population of the region’s hinterland. Of all the captive-exporting regions of Atlantic Africa, Euro-American buyers had the least incentive to trade in the Bight of Biafra. Its harbors were apparently the most unpleasant, discouraging Euro-American slavers from building permanent bases. The mortality rates of captives from the region were significantly higher than other African regions – 18.3 percent, compared to 10.8 percent among captives from all other regions combined. In the Americas, EuroAmerican slavers got lower prices for captives from Biafra than from any other African region. The region supplied the largest proportion of females in a trade that placed a premium on males. During the seventeenth century, when the proportion of females embarked on African ports was at its highest, only the Bight of Biafra actually sent more females than males to the Americas – 50.6 percent as opposed to the African average of 41.5 percent (Table 6.1). That the region’s slave trade experienced rapid expansion after 1650 despite the aforementioned impediments is attributable, at least in part, to its ability to deliver captives quickly and efficiently during the sugar revolution in the Americas. The outlines of the process by which the Aro attained dominance of the inland Bight of Biafra trading system that fed the region’s ports are clear enough, but linking the process to oscillations in the Biafra Atlantic trade and working out its basic chronology are another matter.1 The 1\n\nFor these outlines, see K. O. Dike and Ekejiuba 1990; Ijoma and Njoku 1991; Northrup 1978b; Ukwu 1969:132–36.\n\n22\n\nThe Aro in the Atlantic Context\n\n23\n\nchallenge, then, is to periodize Aro expansion and correlate its dynamics with those of the Biafra Atlantic trade, mapping how the development of the Aro trading complex and demand conditions impacted each other. What emerges is that the foundation of Arochukwu and the development of the Aro diaspora corresponded neatly with basic trends in the region’s Atlantic trade. The Aro case is unusual because, unlike the West African states whose commercial expansion during the slave trade era relied on the imposition of direct suzerainty over large areas, such as Oyo in the Bight of Benin and Asante in the Gold Coast, the Aro built a trading pax in the Bight of Biafra through a network of diaspora settlements. By placing the Aro trading system in the Atlantic context, therefore, we gain a fuller understanding of how African societies helped shape the overseas slave trade. Efforts to describe and explain the expansion of the region’s Atlantic trade have focused on the coastal city-states and concentrated on structural changes related to trade in the nineteenth century.2 Detailed studies of the individual trading states Bonny, Brass, Opobo, New Calabar (Elem-Kalabari), and Old Calabar (Calabar) have thrown light on the patterns and dimensions of regional trade but, except for studies emphasizing the role of internal long-distance trade in the institutional development of the coastal states, little work has been done on the hinterland, encouraging the implication that the hinterland did no more than reflect coastal impulses. This paradigm was perhaps inevitable for two reasons. With few exceptions, these studies dealt with the nineteenth century, especially the later part, that is, after the Atlantic slave trade era, when coastal traders had taken some initiative in hinterland trade.3 Second, such studies drew heavily on European sources and explained Biafra trade from the European perspective.4 A critical reading of this literature is necessary to understand the system that produced the captives sent to the Americas from the Bight of Biafra. Attempts to understand this system must involve analysis of the relevant structures and processes with a focus on the Aro. The captive, which had become the principal “commodity” of the Aro by the eighteenth century at the latest, opens a vista into the Aro political economy and Aro expansion. 2 3\n\n4\n\nDike 1956; Jones 1963; Alagoa 1970, 1971a, 1971b, 1972; 1986. Notable among these exceptions are Alagoa 1970, 1971a, 1971b, 1986; Cookey 1974; Latham 1973; Lovejoy and Richardson 1997, 1999. On Bonny, Hargreaves 1987; Brass, Alagoa 1964; Opobo, Cookey 1974; New Calabar, (Elem – Kalabari), Wariboko 1991; and Old Calabar (Calabar), Latham 1973:26–28; Nair 1972; Noah 1980).\n\n24\n\nSlave Trade and Culture in the Bight of Biafra\n\nTo the Aro, the captive was both a commodity and a resource within an institution of slavery. This connection between indigenous African slavery and the Atlantic slave trade is an important theme of African history. The question of whether slavery was important in African societies before the Atlantic slave trade era or whether it resulted from the slave trade itself has been of particular interest.5 Did the Atlantic slave trade feed on an entrenched slave system or did slavery emerge because of the trade? Both sides of the debate agree that the Atlantic slave trade interacted intimately with indigenous slavery, but any role of preexisting slavery in the development of the overseas slave trade – would likely differ from region to region, according to the extent and spread of slavery.6 The extent of slavery in the Bight of Biafra vis á vis the export slave trade unfolds from a few pertinent facts of regional history. First, up to the beginning of the seventeenth century, the coastal city-states were still fledgling formations. Second, the later large-scale slaveholders of the hinterland – Arochukwu, Abo, Asaba, Oguta, and Osomari – were only just emerging at this time, out of a series of migrations.7 Third, if the theory that abundant land (relative to population) promoted slavery has any validity, the case for large-scale slavery in the Bight of Biafra is weak. The region does not seem to have experienced abundant land at any point in the last millennium. Localized cases of depopulation resulted from the Atlantic slave trade, but they were a consequence of the overseas slave trade rather than a cause of indigenous slavery (Nwokeji 2000a:632–33; 1997c:707–10).8 But none of the foregoing observations in itself proves the nonexistence of slavery in the Bight of Biafra prior to the Atlantic slave\n\n5\n\n6 7\n\n8\n\nFor the first view, see Fage 1969, 1975, 1980; Thornton 1998: chap. 3. The second view is most closely associated with Davidson 1961, 1971; Rodney 1966, 1967; Inikori 1982b, 1992a, 1994a; Noah 1980:76–77; Thompson 1987. Other scholars have explained the expansion, not the origin, of slavery in terms of the influence of the Atlantic slave trade (see M. Klein 1978, 2001:56, 58; Klein and Lovejoy 1979; Lovejoy 1979, 1983, 1989; Manning 1981, 1982:10; 1990; Meillassoux 1982). Except for Meillassoux, the scholars in the third category describe nineteenth-century political economies as slave modes of production. For details, see Nwokeji forthcoming K.O. Dike 1956:25–26; Henderson 1972:41–65; Noah 1980:1–19; Northrup 1978b:45–47; Ogedengbe 1971; Ohadike 1994:xvi, xviii–xix, 46–48, 49–50; Onwuejeogwu 1987:34; Oriji 1994:11, Nwokeji 2000a:629–30. As Latham explicitly states, “it is unlikely that the Efik [of Old Calabar] were owners of many slaves when they were simple fishermen” (Latham 1973:31). The coastal city-states had also come to depend on slavery by the end of the eighteenth century, about which period relevant work exists (Hargreaves 1987:87, 91–92, 93, 101; Nair 1972:37). For surplus land as a determinant of slavery, see Nieboer 1900; Hopkins 1973:24–25.\n\nThe Aro in the Atlantic Context\n\n25\n\ntrade era. Our concern here is not the existence of slavery per se – because it most likely existed in some form – but the extent to which it was practiced and its relationship to the export slave trade. The “crucial issue,” Inikori persuasively argues, “is what the export slave trade [Saharan and Atlantic] did to the extent and character of slavery in the region” (Inikori 1982b:45; 1992a:127, 130, 157).9 The Atlantic slave trade was however but one of the factors that shaped domestic slavery in the region. Slavery does seem to have become widespread by the second half of the eighteenth century, however. Even if we assume that Olaudah Equiano’s description of Igboland was based on accounts he garnered from Igbospeaking people in the Americas, his references to gifts of slaves and fines paid in slaves, and to a man’s “family and slaves” sometimes being “numerous” are instruc"
