Its narrative leads to events between 1945 and 1948 when the imperial gaze of police, press and politicians was focused on a series of mysterious deaths in south-eastern Nigeria attributed to the ‘manleopard society’.These murder mysteries, reported as the ‘biggest, strangest murder hunt in the world’, were not just forensic but also related to the broad historical impact of commercial, Christian and colonial relations on Annang society. David Pratten is Lecturer in the Social Anthropology of Africa at the University of Oxford, and Fellow of St Antony’s College.\n\nINTERNATIONAL AFRICAN LIBRARY Editors J. D.Y. Peel, Suzette Heald and Deborah James\n\nThe International African Library is a monograph series from the International African Institute and complements its quarterly periodical Africa, the premier journal in the field of African studies.\n\nEdinburgh University Press 22 George Square, Edinburgh EH8 9LF ISBN 978 0 7486 2553 6 www.eup.ed.ac.uk For further details of the International African Institute, London, visit their web site at www.iaionthe.net\n\nHISTORY AND SOCIETY IN COLONIAL NIGERIA\n\nEDINBURGH\n\nCover image: Annang Funeral Cloth (Cotton appliqué and patchwork, c. 1950) Reproduced with kind permission of the University of Michigan Museum of Art Gift of Lewis and Margaret Zerby (1987/1.251)\n\nTHE MAN-LEOPARD MURDERS\n\nTHE MAN-LEOPARD MURDERS\n\n‘Pratten’s book is a triumphant achievement.Taking its cue from the sensationally reported leopard killings of 1945–7, it opens out into a rich meditation on the nature of Nigerian society in the twilight years of colonialism.Wide-ranging and subtle, this is a major contribution to African studies and a wonderfully well realised conversation between the concerns of the anthropologist and the historian.’ T.C. McCaskie, School of Oriental and African Studies, London\n\nPRATTEN\n\n‘This is historical anthropology in full splendour. Pratten takes a series of enigmatic ‘manleopard’ murders as a seminal starting point for sketching a surprisingly full picture of the explicit tensions in colonial Nigeria.The man-leopard murders prove to be about a breakdown of trust, particularly in the intimate sphere, but this interpretation leads in all sorts of directions. A true masterpiece!’ Peter Geschiere, University of Amsterdam\n\nINTERNATIONAL AFRICAN LIBRARY\n\nInternational African Library 34 General Editors: J. D. Y. Peel, Suzette Heald and Deborah James\n\nTHE MAN-LEOPARD MURDERS\n\nThe International African Library is a major monograph series from the International African Institute. Theoretically informed ethnographies, and studies of social relations ‘on the ground’ which are sensitive to local cultural forms, have long been central to the Institute’s publications programme. The IAL maintains this strength but extends it into new areas of contemporary concern, both practical and intellectual. It includes works focused on the linkages between local, national and global levels of society; writings on political economy and power; studies at the interface of the socio-cultural and the environmental; analyses of the roles of religion, cosmology and ritual in social organisation; and historical studies, especially those of a social, cultural or interdisciplinary character.\n\nPratten_00_Prelims.indd i\n\n5/4/07 9:53:11 AM\n\nInternational African Library General Editors J.

I extend my sincere thanks to them for their patience and invaluable insights. I would, however, like to acknowledge my enormous debt to Obong Dr Frank A. Umoren, the Paramount Ruler of Southern Ukanafun, and his family for their generous hospitality during my fieldwork between 1996 and 1998 and again in 2001, 2002 and 2004. I also owe Imoh Frank Umoren my sincerest gratitude for his work with me during these years. I would like to extend my thanks to those who assisted in my archival researches. By far the largest proportion of source material for this work was compiled from the Nigerian National Archives in Enugu. Mr U. O. A. Esse and his staff, including Comfort Umoh, Felicia Ibe and Isaac Iheakaram Amaechi, deserve special mention for their careful and patient assistance. Zofia Sulej and Mary-Ann Alho of the University of Witwatersrand were of enormous help in copying M. D. W. Jeffreys’ papers, which are held in the library archives there. I must also mention the staff at Rhodes House Library, Oxford, at the Library of Congress, Washington D. C. and at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London, for their help. Thanks also to John Cardoo of the Qua Iboe Fellowship for facilitating my access to the Church’s archives held at the Public Record Office in Belfast, and to Tim Hutchinson at the University of Saskatchewan Archive. I should also like to thank Ursula Jones for permission to consult Dr G. I. Jones’ papers in Cambridge. Thanks also to John Messenger, Rosemary Harris, John McCall, Ken Barnes and John Manton for their observations and personal papers. For his friendship and his translation of the Spirit Movement papers I am especially grateful to Obong Walter Idem. Along with colleagues at SOAS, Edinburgh, Sussex and Oxford, I am very grateful to Tom McCaskie, Richard Rathbone, Axel HarneitSievers, Charlie Gore, Ruth Ginio, Robin Horton, Kay Williamson, Turner and Miriam Isoun, Violetta Ekpo, Martin Lynn, Mike Rowlands, Peter Geschiere, Richard Fardon and Colin Murray for their help, insight and advice. During my fieldwork I enjoyed the hospitality of the Sociology Department at the University of Port Harcourt and the Faculty of Social\n\nPratten_00_Prelims.indd viii\n\n5/4/07 9:53:14 AM\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nix\n\nSciences at the University of Uyo. I owe particular thanks to Steve Wordu for his amiable assistance during my first months in Port Harcourt. I am grateful to the Economic and Social Research Council for a studentship award which supported my initial research and to the British Academy for a postdoctoral research fellowship and fieldwork funding which saw the project through to this point. For encouraging me many years ago to make the history I write ‘my own’, I should like to thank Cliff Davies. Since I had the good fortune of becoming John Peel’s research student I have been inspired by his passion for a thoroughly historical ethnography, by his intimate knowledge of African societies and by the style and scholarship of his research. Most of all, though, I want to thank him for his belief in my work and for the persistence and generosity of his guidance over the many years of this project. My research and writing would not have been possible without the support of my parents and family to whom I will always be grateful.

Again and again the people have appealed to Government for help. They have wailed for a long time, but no help has been forthcoming. Day after day reports are made of loss of several lives due to the ravages of these ferocious animals. Nobody knows what Government thinks of this state of affairs. Recently the house boy to Court Messenger Okon Bassey was attacked and killed while on his way to tap palm wine near a riverside. The people are like sheep without a shepherd. Nigerian Eastern Mail, 10 March 1945 This newspaper article launched the official investigation into the ‘manleopard’ murders. From this moment, and for the next three years, the Imperial gaze of police, press and politicians was focused on Calabar Province in south-eastern Nigeria. At the time the police investigation was reported as the ‘biggest, strangest murder hunt in the world’,1 and it would become the last major investigation in Africa into killings linked to a shapeshifting cult. Three years later, when the police wound up their enquiries in early 1948, they calculated that 196 men, women and children had been victims of the man-leopard murders, though they also conceded that there were almost certainly more murders that were never brought to light. During this period ninety-six men were convicted of murder, seventy-seven of whom were executed. Despite these facts, those closest to the investigation feared that the origin of the so-called ‘man-leopard’ murders would probably never be discovered with any degree of certainty, and that the events would remain shrouded in mystery.2 Every murder mystery starts with a body. Yet no one had reported the suspicious circumstances surrounding the death of Dan Udoffia, Okon Bassey’s house-boy, until this article appeared in a weekly newspaper published in Calabar, the provincial headquarters and coastal trading hub. The first report of Udoffia’s death was prompted by an anonymous tip-off from two men, a court clerk and a school teacher, who were both stationed in Ikot Okoro, the scene of Udoffia’s death. They believed that he had been\n\nPratten_01_Ch1.indd 1\n\n5/4/07 9:54:35 AM\n\n2\n\nTHE MAN-LEOPARD MURDERS\n\nmurdered by ‘human-leopards’, and their intention was to alert the new Colonial Officer to their suspicions. The District Officer in question, Frederick Kay, had been posted to Abak that same month. His reputation as a stickler had preceded him. On reading the article in the Nigerian Eastern Mail Kay launched a preliminary enquiry. The victim’s body was exhumed, and a post-mortem examination carried out in the nearby town of Ikot Ekpene revealed that Udoffia had died from shock and haemorrhage caused by two puncture wounds made by a sharp instrument. The doctor’s autopsy report stated categorically that it was a man and not a leopard that had inflicted the wounds. With this evidence Kay began to believe that there was some substance to the suspicions voiced in the newspaper article and that, as he put it, murder was manifest. Despite the medical evidence the initial investigation drew a blank. Kay spent fourteen hours taking twenty pages of statements from six witnesses, including an eye-witness to the fatal assault. In his statement Akpan Etuk Udo said that after tapping palm wine he had been walking home with Dan Udoffia on the evening of 22 February when he heard the sound of a commotion behind him. As he swung round he saw, just seven paces away, a leopard pinning Udoffia to the ground. He shouted and ran at the leopard, which disappeared into the bush. Though Udoffia was wounded he got to his feet and the two men ran home to the court compound in Ikot Okoro. The next day Udoffia’s master and neighbour, Okon Bassey, took charge of the patient and moved him to his own house. Along with Akpan Etuk Udo and Frank Umoren, the court clerk, Okon Bassey marched several miles to fetch Nchericho, a ‘native doctor’, to attend to him, but before dawn on the following morning, 24 February, Dan Udoffia succumbed to his injuries. So far so innocent, Kay reported. But the finger of suspicion had begun to point to the very person who had apparently tried to save the dying man, Okon Bassey. He was a head court messenger with seventeen years’ service and had been at home on leave in Ikot Okoro at the end of February 1945. There was no direct evidence implicating Okon Bassey, but suspicion fell on him because of his role in a bizarre series of events on 23 February. When Udoffia was moved to Bassey’s house that day several people were known to have visited the victim, including the local headmaster, other schoolteachers and the court clerk. Yet Bassey had refused to allow the local dispenser, James Ekpat Ekpo, who was the closest thing to a medical doctor in the vicinity and who lived just opposite, to see or treat the dying man. Then, when he died, Bassey buried Udoffia’s body himself without making any report to the authorities. Perhaps, the District Officer reflected, the dispenser’s intervention might have saved Udoffia’s life; perhaps Okon Bassey had something to hide. After ten days’ investigation the police at Abak arrested Okon Bassey for manslaughter as he was not accused of physically taking part in the attack.\n\nPratten_01_Ch1.indd 2\n\n5/4/07 9:54:35 AM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nLocal rumour had it, however, that he was in league with accomplices, two fellow members of a secret man-leopard society. ‘It was commonly canvassed,’ wrote the District Officer, ‘that the man had met his death at the hands of the leopard society’. At the time Kay himself was no more convinced of this idea of a secret society having been employed to kill Dan Udoffia than he was of Akpan Etuk Udo’s eye-witness evidence that he had seen a leopard at the scene of the attack: It may be that Akpan Etuk Udo’s story is a tissue of lies – that there was not the semblance of a leopard or of a member of the leopard society, and that he and his associates destroyed deceased.3 A week later, however, the police investigation revealed a motive for the murder. Returning to his station in southern Ukanafun, Bassey was not only accompanied by his second of five wives, Maggie, but also by Dan Udoffia’s widow, Unwa Obot. Plain-clothes police established that noisy quarrels were heard between the two women and Okon Bassey because he insisted on having sex with Udoffia’s widow. Returning to his house in Ikot Okoro, the police took statements from Bassey’s other wives, which would prove crucial to the prosecution’s case against him. The police investigation was completed in July 1945 and although Kay remained sceptical about the leopard society theory and whether Bassey had himself ever been among its members, he was convinced that Okon Bassey had killed Dan Udoffia in order to carry on an affair with his wife. Okon Bassey was subsequently charged with murder and the case was heard before a packed Supreme Court, with Mr Justice Manson presiding, on 27 November 1945. Prosecuting for the Crown, Barrister L. N. Mbanefo stated that Bassey had ambushed Udoffia on account of past disputes between them, and disguising himself as a man-leopard seriously wounded his neighbour with a sharp instrument and left him for dead. After the attack Bassey was further accused of refusing Udoffia medical treatment, of concealing him in his house, and of secretly and indecently burying him.4 Bassey’s defence counsel, Barrister J. M. Coco-Bassey, offered little to refute the charge. His case hinged on calling Bassey’s wives as witnesses to establish his alibi, but their evidence on oath was dismissed under crossexamination as it was contradicted by statements the police had taken from them previously in Ikot Okoro. These statements claimed that Bassey had not been in the compound with his wives at the time of the attack as he had claimed. Bassey’s senior wife, Edima, had stated that Bassey had threatened to kill Udoffia just hours before the murder and that he had taken her to Udoffia’s grave the day after he was buried where he showed her faked leopard pad marks and where he had said that ‘a leopard always dances on the grave of its victim’.5 With his alibi broken the defence case collapsed and Okon Bassey was convicted on the evidence of his own wives. On 29 November 1945 he was sentenced to death by hanging.\n\nPratten_01_Ch1.indd 3\n\n5/4/07 9:54:35 AM\n\n4\n\nTHE MAN-LEOPARD MURDERS\n\nIn January 1946 the Resident of Calabar Province informed the regional Government of the unanimous desire among local councils and the District Officers for Okon Bassey, now a ‘famous figure’, to be hanged in public. Though he recognised that public executions had been abolished in 1943, the Resident endorsed this request in order to correct a widespread rumour that condemned murderers were not in fact hanged but taken to work as slaves in distant parts of the country or else exiled abroad.6 At 9 o’clock on the morning of Saturday, 30 March 1946, just over a year after Dan Udoffia died, Okon Bassey was hanged in the yard of Abak prison. Thousands of people gathered outside and three chiefs were allowed to witness the execution along with a handful of officials, including Kay, who had requested to be there for ‘political reasons’. Apart from being the first man-leopard enquiry, the Udoffia case has a particular significance for the writing of this book. Fifty years after the man-leopard murders, by coincidence, the court clerk from Ikot Okoro who had anonymously written to the Nigerian Eastern Mail calling for the Government to act in the war against the human-leopards, Frank Akpan Umoren, became my guide to Annang history, and my friend. Umoren was the court clerk who, as a result of wartime under-staffing in 1945, covered both Ikot Okoro and Mbiakot Native Courts. DO Kay mentions that one ‘Frank’ along with Okon Bassey met Dan Udoffia and Akpan Etuk Udo returning from the attack, and that Frank trekked some distance to bring a ‘native doctor’ to treat Udoffia the day before he died. Umoren’s own recollections of the Udoffia case are revealing. Though his junior within the Ikot Okoro court compound, Bassey had once threatened Umoren that he would soon be killed by a leopard believed to stalk the area. This was no mere insubordination, however, as to forecast death in this way was tantamount to a declaration of his own criminal intentions. Umoren had also heard Bassey threaten Udoffia that he would not live to marry a new wife. Umoren’s account of the motive in the Udoffia case differs from that presented in court. He claimed that the dispute between Bassey and Udoffia was about wives as DO Kay had thought, but was not as straightforward. Udoffia owned land which he had rented on a pledge agreement to one of Bassey’s wives. But Udoffia himself wished to marry again and needed money to complete his brideprice. He therefore redeemed his plot from Bassey’s wife and re-pledged it to a man from Ikot Okoro called Abraham, at a higher rate. The reason for the master’s ominous threat to his servant was this personal snub, and that he had been denied access to farmland at a time when food prices were especially high for poorly paid court auxiliaries. Frank Umoren left the colonial service soon after the war to take up a more lucrative trade in piassava, palm oil and kernels. Fifty years on Obong (Dr) Frank Umoren is the paramount ruler, an officially recognised chief,\n\nPratten_01_Ch1.indd 4\n\n5/4/07 9:54:36 AM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n5\n\nFigure 1.1 Obong (Dr) F. A. Umoren (© David Pratten) of the southern Ukanafun clan in what is now Akwa Ibom State. On 29 December 2000, in a ceremony marked by the dispensation of honours upon his family and supporters, he celebrated his centenary. His recollections of the last century encompass histories of clan migration and knowledge of Annang social order prior to the violence of colonial arrival, along with a personal story of education, conversion, colonial service, and the rise and fall of political fortunes. All of these aspects would intrigue a curious new arrival to Chief Umoren’s village of Ikot Akpa Nkuk, but none so much as the intimacies and accusations he revealed surrounding the man-leopard murder mysteries. It was this personal connection to the murders that led me to re-examine the published record, to try to exhume the colonial archive in Nigeria, Britain and America, and it was this introduction which suggested the possibility of unmasking further details of the murders from men and women of the villages in and around what was once known as the ‘leopard area’. *\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThe mysteries surrounding the man-leopard murders are of two distinct but related kinds: the immediate and the historical. The immediate problems of the criminal investigations are those related to the evidence available\n\nPratten_01_Ch1.indd 5\n\n5/4/07 9:54:36 AM\n\n6\n\nTHE MAN-LEOPARD MURDERS\n\nin particular cases: the means and the motive of each killing. The broader historical questions concern why these deaths happened when and where they did. Dan Udoffia’s murder, though it was probably not the first manleopard murder in Calabar Province during the 1940s, is nevertheless the natural beginning to this book. It was the first investigation to be launched, aspects of the case would shape subsequent inquiries, and as such it introduced many of the forensic puzzles of the man-leopard mysteries. The Udoffia case was indicative of a set of forensic questions concerning who or what was responsible for the deaths, questions that were complicated by problematic physical evidence and by contradictory witness statements. How the killings might be seen as being of their time is the longer narrative of this work, but they were unquestionably of their place. The ‘man-leopard’ murders were committed in a landscape of flat, dense oil palm on the west bank of the Qua Iboe river. The physical landscape of this southern Annang territory was natural leopard habitat and the killers used this to their advantage. The location and timing of the attack on Udoffia and subsequent victims mimicked that of a leopard. Most of the murders happened on an isolated and deserted bush path. It was the sort of path villagers were known to pass regularly in the course of harvesting forest products, especially palm wine (as Udoffia had been) or áfân leaves used in preparing soup. The killers also attacked at dusk as leopards are known to do and as they had in the Udoffia case. Even if the victim’s body was discovered quickly, the rapidly setting sun would soon discourage anyone sending for the police and would delay any search for clues or suspects until the following morning. It was not unusual, in fact, for crime scenes to be disturbed, sometimes with the addition of elaborate details to throw the police off track, between their discovery and any investigation. In this habitat it was hard to distinguish between real leopard attacks and those which simulated them. The victims appeared to have been killed in the same way a wild leopard attacks its prey, from behind and biting at the neck and throat. Hence, the evidence of who or what was responsible for the attacks, leopard or man-leopard, is an enduring puzzle of the murders. The answer depended on the forensic medical evidence. The effectiveness of the techniques and tests of the 1940s, at least those available to doctors in Ikot Ekpene and Port Harcourt where most of the post-mortem examinations were carried out, was limited, especially when they were confronted with the severity of mutilation and decomposition which was typical of the victims’ remains. It was not uncommon for victims to have been buried, as in the Udoffia case, and sometimes for years, before the police became aware of the suspicious circumstances surrounding the death. Udoffia’s case, in which his wounds were consistent with stabs from a sharp pointed object, possibly a readily available farming tool like a yam spike or a file, was also similar to most of the subsequent deaths. The line in distinguishing between\n\nPratten_01_Ch1.indd 6\n\n5/4/07 9:54:37 AM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n7\n\nmurder and mauling, between yam spike and leopard claw, was a fine one and required precision in its detection. The forensic evidence would swing overwhelmingly in favour of human agency, but the doctors had apparently been duped for several years prior to Kay’s investigation into the Udoffia case and there remained sufficient room for further suspicions to emerge. Nagging doubts regarding the physical evidence were compounded by inconsistencies in witness statements. The details of the eye-witness testimony in the Udoffia case, in which Akpan Etuk Udo claimed to have seen a leopard from the bush attack Udoffia, would be repeated with remarkable frequency throughout the investigations. For whatever reason, because they were telling the truth and this was how it appeared to them, or because they were concealing the identity of the killer, a high proportion of eye-witnesses testified to the police in their initial statement that they had seen a wild leopard attack the victim. In many instances, however, the eye-witnesses subsequently changed their stories. Again, whether they did so because the police allayed their fears or they spoke under duress would become a moot point, but these eye-witnesses invariably recollected, sometimes weeks later, that it was a man, sometimes two and usually someone they could name, whom they had seen stalking and assaulting the victim. In this context where witness evidence was inconsistent and unreliable, the main problem that arose was that of distinguishing between credible information and malicious accusation. Personal animosities, threats, grudges and resulting accusations, all of which emerged during the Udoffia case, would characterise almost every subsequent killing. In two crucial respects Dan Udoffia’s death differed from other manleopard murders, and these features were probably why the case was the first to be exposed. Udoffia was not killed in the initial assault. His body was therefore not subject to the elaborate mutilations which served to disguise his wounds and simulate a leopard attack. As a result it was easier to establish pathologically the cause of his death. Yet these circumstances also expose a glaring evidential inconsistency. Since Dan Udoffia was well enough to walk home, why is there no mention of him definitely identifying who or what attacked him? Of course, this may well have been why Okon Bassey shielded his ward from outsiders; Bassey and others may well have conspired together; and the fear of being identified by this group may well be why the schoolteacher and the court clerk (who both saw Udoffia) alerted the authorities anonymously and rather circuitously. If the means of murder in the Udoffia case were problematic, the question of motive was equally complex and bound up in a number of assumptions and suspicions. Local rumours fuelled colonial concerns that the strange deaths in western Calabar Province were the work of a secret leopard society. Experience of secret society ‘revivals’ across the Province and knowledge of Annang shape-shifting beliefs, coupled with the apparent conspiracy in\n\nPratten_01_Ch1.indd 7\n\n5/4/07 9:54:37 AM\n\n8\n\nTHE MAN-LEOPARD MURDERS\n\nthe Udoffia case, suggested the operation of a covert network. Whether the murders were conducted by a secret society or a gang of hired assassins would became one of the most significant questions of the entire investigation. The reticence of local chiefs in providing information in the Udoffia case and those that followed further suggested that this was a subversive movement led by arch-conservatives within the village hierarchy. Question marks over the precise organisation of the group conducting the killings were linked to the question of their intentions. Were the killers’ motives ritual or revenge? The Udoffia case revealed marriage, brideprice, land tenure, debt and money to be central issues of dispute between the victim and the convicted. The puzzle, however, was this: could such apparently mundane motives, disputes which filled the court record books before, during and after the murders, account for all the killings? These commonplace disagreements might be expected to spill over into violence in only a handful of extreme and isolated instances, so was it feasible that they could explain almost 200 deaths in such a short space of time? There did not appear to be any ritual component to the Udoffia case, but the connection with secret societies meant the question was raised from the outset, as was the possibility that the killings were linked to performances at secret village shrines. As more and more victims were discovered the question resurfaced. Was it possible that the wounds on the victims’ bodies disguised more than the human hands that had inflicted them? Did the serial nature of the killings and the consistently precise pattern of mutilation not only conceal but reveal a ritual motive, the removal of human flesh and body parts for use in the performance of ceremonies to confer wealth or power on the killers and their confessors? This would become the most significant puzzle of the entire investigation, and for its three years’ duration the debate over motives, whether ritual or revenge, would pass backwards and forwards from police posts to the provincial residency, and from Lagos to London. These forensic puzzles, the identity of the killers and their means and motives, have provoked heated and long-running debates in which lives and careers have been lost. Yet this was not the first time such questions had arisen on the continent. To these puzzles from Calabar Province we may add a comparative context and an array of murder mysteries posed by ‘human-leopards’ and their crimes, actual or imagined, from elsewhere in Africa. LEOPARD MEN IN FACT AND FICTION\n\nFrom isolated anecdotes to widespread ‘outbreaks’, reports of the ‘leopard’ killing subterfuge have displayed a wide regional distribution and variation across the African continent over the past two centuries.7 The cases from Sierra Leone at the end of the nineteenth century, from the Congo in the\n\nPratten_01_Ch1.indd 8\n\n5/4/07 9:54:37 AM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n9\n\n1920s and from Tanganyika in the 1940s, however, are among the most wellknown and reviewed cases. The sensational nature and high profile of these incidents and the way in which they seemed to confirm the most sinister of European colonial fantasies about Africa meant that the figure of the ‘leopard man’ featured prominently in fictional depictions of the continent in novels and films from the turn of the twentieth century onwards. Africa represented a blank space in Europe’s collective imagination and could therefore be populated by all manner of invented creatures, sometimes noble, sometimes monstrous, that were the visual and visceral products of European fears and desires.8 Both the context of comparative ‘big-cat’ killings elsewhere in Africa and their fictional portrayal shaped the setting of the man-leopard killings in Nigeria and the range of ideas colonial investigators applied to them. From the mid-nineteenth century onwards reports of deaths disguised by the simulation of injuries inflicted by wild animals on their prey emerged from Sierra Leone to become the most notorious theriomorphic murders in West Africa. These deaths were linked to societies of human-leopards, human-alligators and human-baboons. Reports emerged from the Sherbro chiefdoms in the Sierra Leone hinterland in 1882 that ‘the witches that transformed themselves into leopards, [had] destroyed and eaten over 40 persons’.9 From the evidence presented in subsequent trials and investigations a common modus operandi emerged. The ‘leopards’ went out at night as a group and killings were conducted by one or two disguised with leopard skins over their heads and armed with five blades set as a claw-like instrument. After the killing, human flesh was cooked and consumed, it was alleged, and human fat was rubbed on a ‘medicine’ known as bofima. The Sierra Leone ‘human-leopards’ posed a set of puzzles that would re-surface decades later along the coast in Nigeria. These included questions about what people meant when they referred to a ‘leopard’, what they meant when they claimed the killers ‘ate’ their victims, the origin and organisation of the human-leopard society, why those accused were often linked to chieftaincy politics, and how the colonial authorities would manage their response. The most significant feature of this episode, however, was the problematic ritual meanings that were attributed to the murders. The underlying puzzle was the ontological status of the killers. In the Upper Guinea forest the generic Mende term referring to murders of this indeterminate type is boni hinda (‘leopard business’).10 For some the victims were killed at night by witches with supernatural, theriomorphic powers, while others believed that the ‘human-leopards’ were men and women who disguised their crimes by simulating a wild leopard attack. The disparities between Mende and European modes of perception and understanding underpinned these contradictions. While European thought considers shape-shifting an interior process of altered consciousness, the peoples of\n\nPratten_01_Ch1.indd 9\n\n5/4/07 9:54:37 AM\n\n10\n\nTHE MAN-LEOPARD MURDERS\n\nthe Guinea Coast perceive it as a change in objective reality and hence describe it as an exterior event.11 European perceptions dismissed Mende accounts of supernatural causes in favour of finding a human culprit. In the murky space in between these views opportunities arose for political plotting, private intrigue and for lodging cynically motivated accusations. Indeed, for many, the crucial aspect of the investigation was not in understanding the murder motives so much as the motivations behind these accusations. The accusations of boni hinda coincided with a particular historical moment of political crisis and social tension within rural Mende society. An underlying historical transformation was the shift in the centre of economic power during the late nineteenth century from the slave-trading coast to the palm oil-producing hinterland.12 The subsequent colonial takeover of the Sierra Leone hinterland in 1886 was associated with an intersection of commercial rivalries, trade disputes, government backing for a new class of chiefs and the associated collapse of confidence in indigenous political structures. In the new colonial constitution chiefs were better able to exploit new opportunities to exact exorbitant levies and fines from their subjects. It was these exploited dependants who were willing witnesses in the colonial courts against their powerful patrons and other groups such as clerks, traders and missionaries who were accumulating wealth under the Protectorate. Accusations of leopardism against chiefs and headmen resonated with local conceptions of chieftaincy and its animal symbolism. Chiefs, like their counterparts elsewhere, were already ‘human-leopards’ of a sort since hunters were obliged to give them the skin, teeth and claws of a leopard they killed. The human-leopard murders may consequently be seen as resulting from the collapse of a system of egalitarian norms, from rampant political individualism of newly emergent classes, and from popular perceptions that the seizing of power involved the magical consumption of the vital organs of the most vulnerable in society.13 In contrast, some suggest that the human-leopard societies in Sierra Leone were a form of insurgency and rebellion in the face of the colonial encounter both in its political context and in terms of personal and psychological meanings. It has been argued that the magical manipulation of consciousness involved in shape-shifting embraced the ideals of personhood, of generosity and magnanimity represented by totemic animals such as the leopard. The different modalities of shape-shifting on the Guinea Coast revealed a personal agenda and a search for individual autonomy, meaning and control in a world that appeared unpredictable and ungraspable. Motivated by a ‘concatenation’ of personal grievances, political resentments and economic frustrations perhaps the leopard-men sought power and control over their own situation by realising ‘the wildest imaginings and worst prejudices of their oppressors’.14\n\nPratten_01_Ch1.indd 10\n\n5/4/07 9:54:38 AM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n11\n\nOne of the key features of reports about human-leopards in Sierra Leone was their association with accusations of ritual cannibalism and the use of human body parts in the manufacture of charms. In order to make the bofima medicine’s owner rich and powerful, it was thought to need to be anointed with human fat and smeared with human blood.15 The link between the murders and the medicine led the investigation directly to the activities of the wealthy and powerful in Guinea Coast society. Bofima might be held collectively or it might be the personal charm of individuals aspiring to enhance their charisma, wealth and status. The human-leopards were therefore thought to be the cohorts of political aspirants, especially chiefs, and it was thought that the killing cycle reproduced itself. Each person who received power from the revitalised bofima incurred a ‘flesh debt’ which could be satisfied only with the death of a person whom they ‘owned’, like a slave, a ward or a consanguineous descendant; ‘one eats what one is attached to’, and this was usually a low-status adolescent.16 The cannibal might be perceived as an anti-colonialist, anti-modernist sign, as with other ‘traditional’ forms and poetics of violence.17 The degree to which the extensive reports of human-leopard attacks on the Atlantic coast represented specific and real accounts of actual cannibalistic rites, however, is a key puzzle.18 Eating and consuming are polysemic terms of the utmost ambiguity. Cannibalism can be taken as a metaphorical mode of explaining death, and as a politically motivated representation. Indeed, later enquiries with descendants of those from this region related how their ancestors had reported cannibalism cases to the District Commissioners in order to undermine the claims of their political rivals. Although contemporary informants may have their own reasons for not wanting to implicate their ancestors in ‘leopard business’, those who might take the archival records of these accusations at face value are therefore warned to exercise circumspection.19 The organisation and origin of the human-leopard society in Sierra Leone raised further problems. The human-leopard society was organised like the various sodalities of Mende, Temne and Sherbro society, including Poro, Sande and Thoma, and involved initiation, the use of ‘medicine’ and oaths of secrecy. In contrast to these groups, however, which stood for the social reproduction of the community in preparing children for adulthood, upholding the moral and physical order, and acting as the counterbalance to chieftaincy, the human-leopards were anti-social and stood for the accumulation of selfish, individual power.20 The cases in Sierra Leone raised the question of whether the human-leopard society had formed a part of the social fabric in perpetuity, or whether reports of their crimes not only coincided with but were caused by colonial arrivals. The possibility of links between the ‘leopard murders’ and the Atlantic slave trade were never far from the surface.

Before the establishment of the Colony, when slaves and captives from internecine wars were more readily available, it was thought that there had been no need for the subterfuge of the leopard-style killing in securing victims for the bofima rites. Hence it was argued that the humanleopard society was of relatively recent origin, the early nineteenth century perhaps, and that its formation was linked not with the slave trade per se but with its abolition and the extension of colonial rule from Colony to Protectorate.21 There was therefore a functional and literal colonial supposition that the human-leopard subterfuge was invented to conceal abduction and murder from watchful European eyes.22 More recent analyses of the murders in Sierra Leone also link the humanleopards to stories from the Atlantic slave trade era.23 Memories of cannibalism linked to the Atlantic trade formed a lens, it has been suggested, through which the predatory and extractive relationships of the legitimate trade era could be evaluated.24 The argument is that the ‘leopard scare’ in Sierra Leone at the end of the nineteenth century reworked the memories of earlier rumours of eating the vanquished in warfare and of European cannibals carrying away slaves to be consumed. This problematic re-historicising therefore tends to rework the very same narratives and fantasies that it is trying to contextualise. The danger indeed is that the reconstruction of a nineteenth-century political imagination begins to look suspiciously like the recirculation of a familiar narrative adopted by colonial commentators. In his 1915 account, for instance, one of the judges in Sierra Leone, K. J. Beatty, related historical precedents for stories of cannibalism from the 1600s onwards in order to signal a narrative of backwardness and barbarism. The official response to reports of these murders in Sierra Leone was not against the leopard men specifically, but rather against those who accused and denounced them. The Tongo players’ dance and performance was officially proscribed in 1892 because of the suspicion that it ordered punishments, including public burnings, of those accused of employing the leopard killing ruse for the purpose of cannibalism. Subsequent ‘leopard-style’ murders led to the introduction of extraordinary legislation in 1895, the year before Protectorate status was extended to the Sierra Leone hinterland. Between 1903 and 1912, seventeen cases were heard by a circuit court in which 186 people were charged with murder under the Human Leopard Society Ordinance. The scope of leopard society activities appeared to escalate in July 1912 when a murder was foiled in Imperri and one of the assailants turned King’s evidence. The information he gave on a further thirty murders led to the arrest of almost 400 people, of whom 108, including several paramount chiefs (mahawa), were committed for trial before a Special Commission Court.\n\nPratten_01_Ch1.indd 12\n\n5/4/07 9:54:38 AM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n13\n\nThe ambiguities and uncertainties surrounding the events in Sierra Leone at the turn of the century compounded the difficulty of investigating accusations of covert assassination. The colonial investigations on the Guinea Coast therefore reveal a number of points which are of comparative insight. Despite the severe provisions of the legislation in place and the status of the judges shipped to the colony, the effectiveness of the colonial enquiry was undermined by the problematic nature of the evidence. Several cases, for instance, hinged on trying to identify human-leopards from supposed initiation marks on their buttocks.25 In many ways the lack of corroborative evidence to support the accusations served precisely to confirm colonial fears about the covert nature of the human-leopards and the overwhelming and terrorising influence they had upon local people: In cases of this sort where the principal men are bound together by the bonds of guilt as well as of secrecy, where the victim is provided by the head of the family, who, instead of ferreting out the crime, uses all his influence to have the matter hushed up, and where the whole people cower down in dread of the terrible vengeance threatened by the aweinspiring Borfima, it is not to be wondered at that it is exceptional to be able to procure independent evidence.26 Rather than investigate the motives behind the accusations, in fact, efforts were made to enquire into the reticence of informants and witnesses. A District Commissioner’s Enquiry of 1913 believed that when government officers were making enquiries, an attempt was made ‘to swear’ the whole country and to put the entire population under an oath of secrecy.27 These difficulties were compounded by the presence of arch-sceptics who were unwilling to entertain the notion of human-leopards and who dabbled in the zoological sciences to prove their point. ‘Leopard’ murder inquiries were launched only when the authorities gave credence to the accusations, and when particular Colonial Officers refused to entertain the possibility of human-leopards the official murder rate declined. From 1912 to 1939 only three of the animal-related murders were reported in Sierra Leone. This period coincided with the tenure as Provincial Commissioner of Captain W. B. Stanley (based in Pujehun, Northern Sherbro) who was convinced that the cases of ‘fetish murder’ were in fact genuine cases of killing by wild animals – leopards, alligators and chimpanzees.28 Stanley believed that his colonial predecessors had misjudged the situation because they refused to accept that Sierra Leone’s wildlife was killing human beings and he sought to prove that chimpanzees were carnivorous. Stanley’s intervention marks a striking parallel between events in Sierra Leone and those that would unfold in Nigeria. Reports of the ‘human-leopards’ in Sierra Leone had a formative impact on conceptions of covert killings throughout the British colonies. The rela-\n\nPratten_01_Ch1.indd 13\n\n5/4/07 9:54:38 AM\n\n14\n\nTHE MAN-LEOPARD MURDERS\n\ntionship between the knowledge of secret societies and human sacrifice along the West African Coast in the late nineteenth century became a regular topic of talks at Royal Anthropological Society meetings in London.29 The human-leopards and lions in the eastern Congo which were involved in several ‘outbreaks’ had a similar effect on the francophone world. Belgian museum collections of human-leopard paraphernalia, including spotted ‘leopard’ costumes and knife-holding gloves, which came from the investigations in the eastern Congo, are responsible for much of the visual imagery of the big-cat killings.30 There are two specific issues raised by accounts of human-leopards and lions from the Congo which have a bearing on subsequent events in Nigeria. The first is how they have been interpreted as the ‘social heroes’ of political resistance movements; the second is the way in which they have been seen as specialist assassins hired to intimidate rivals in local conflicts. A series of outbreaks of human-lion killings in the Tabwa region of Congo near Baudonville (Moba) ran episodically from 1886 to 1942. The earliest coincided with European arrivals: those at the turn of the century took place against the background of the imposition of taxation, those in the inter-war period were set against famines, the influenza pandemic and the effects of the depression, and the last reported cases were associated with newly implemented British-style indirect rule, exacerbated by mobilisation efforts during the Second World War. Of these outbreaks, the murders during the 1890s have been interpreted within the broader historical process of colonial encounter and have been subject to claims that these lion-men attacks were ‘a political strategy of terrorism’.31 Tabwa lion-men (visanguka) had the power to make themselves invisible. They killed using iron claws while disguising themselves with animal skins and their crime scenes with carved pad prints.32 During 1894 ten victims were killed near the White Fathers’ mission station at Baudonville. Though other motives figured in these cases, including debt and adultery, it was the victims’ connection to the missionaries that was perceived to be the critical feature. From April 1895 to March 1896 there was evidence of a concerted attack on mission followers, and the missionaries obtained permission from the Congo Free State forcibly to prevent converts from deserting their stations. This has led to the suggestion that the man-lion killers were ‘social bandits’ or ‘heroic criminals’ leading a liberation movement against colonialism and mission Christianity.33 ‘The whole movement’, it was claimed, ‘was a conservative reaction against ... collaborators with the colonisers’.34 A common theme in the historiography and ethnography of human-leopards, indeed, is to link them with resistance to alien or indigenous elites. This leads us to consider the possibility that the leopard men were African social bandits or antiheroes and to the question of whether they expressed pre-political sentiments and a desire for a just world.35\n\nPratten_01_Ch1.indd 14\n\n5/4/07 9:54:39 AM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n15\n\nTwo decades later, from 1919 to the mid-1930s, leopard-related killings emerged in the Bali region of Congo’s Stanleyville District. Here, the leopard men were known as anioto (from the Bafwasea verb nioto, to scratch). The anioto functioned both as a weapon of war between rival chieftaincies, and as a means to right the wrongs of local justice, especially over brideprice cases.36 Against a backdrop of administrative reforms in which the Belgian authorities sought to introduce British-style ‘indirect rule’ and in which customary law was afforded greater legitimacy, the anioto killings were seen as a political device by which rivals could undermine a chief ’s capacity to maintain law and order. As elsewhere, the leopard men were thought to be organised as a secret society, in this case as the exclusive upper-echelon of the mambela society. Initiation was said to involve practising the leopard method for the first attack, which was always to be on a relative in order to prove fealty to the association. The colonial response was to regulate secret societies, including the registration of members, and in 1936 the District Commissioner of Stanleyville insisted that women and children should see and therefore undermine the power of the otherwise secret regalia and practices of the mambela. Congolese leopard men also became intimately linked with acts of political assassination. In 1933 and 1934 the Belgian authorities waged an extensive campaign against ‘human-leopards’ in north-eastern Congo. The ‘aniotique campaign’ began in 1933 with a mysterious death in Beni (Eastern Province) when a victim’s left arm had been severed and a subsequent thirty-eight cases were investigated. A public prosecutor held an enquiry in January 1934 and a man known as Luluma was arrested. He denied having committed the murders but admitted to being a member of a sect, the human-leopards known as wahokohoko. A second magistrate’s enquiry was launched in May 1934 (assisted by Joset, whose account is our main source). From the enquiries and the trials the killings appeared to be linked to inter-clan conflicts provoked by tensions over the payment of taxes and tribute, the installation of chiefs and disputes over land. The wahokohoko, then, were specialist assassins hired by prominent chiefs to further their ambitions, exact revenge, extract tribute or exert coercion during these inter-clan conflicts.37 Stories of the human-leopards in Sierra Leone encouraged the Nigerian investigators to look for ritual motives, while evidence from Congo pointed to assassination and resistance. Contrasting evidence of human-lion killings in Tanganyika, however, suggested two further issues that would dominate the investigations in south-eastern Nigeria: everyday motives for assassination and a connection between the killings and tensions within the household. The Usure area of central Tanganyika had apparently been visited by ‘lion-men’ in the 1920s, though investigations into over 200 deaths at the time were inconclusive. The suspicion was, however,\n\nPratten_01_Ch1.indd 15\n\n5/4/07 9:54:39 AM\n\n16\n\nTHE MAN-LEOPARD MURDERS\n\nthat witch-doctors could control or turn themselves into wild lions (mbojo in Turu; antu nsimba in Swahili).38 Evidence from deaths attributed to the mbojo which began to appear in the neighbouring Eastern Singida Province in 1946 was more revealing, and by July 1947 103 cases had been reported.39 The ambiguous identity of the killers was, as elsewhere, a key question. While the killers could have been men dressed in animal skins using iron claws, or men who had transformed themselves into a lion, the overriding explanation was that they were real lions controlled by a witch. These witches were usually women, since all women in Turu society were believed to possess latent witchcraft (aroghi) powers. Abnormal deaths, especially the mbojo-related deaths, were therefore attributed by men to women who had hated the victim and had commissioned the murder. Further evidence from later investigations revealed that the mode of the human-lion killings was peculiar. Mbojo assassins were named in the trials but never apprehended. They were people, many of them children, who had disappeared several years previously and who, it was claimed, had been abducted and trained to kill as a lion. These human-lions were hired for between 15 and 30 shillings and were assisted by the conspirators in mutilating the bodies of their victims to resemble a lion mauling. One man, for instance, claimed he had ‘changed’ a girl into the shape and habits of a lion by repeated doses of drugs (hashish the police thought) then hired her out to kill for 30 shillings.40 The Tanganyika cases were also explicitly linked to the shifting features of the colonial political landscape. First, the 1940s ‘outbreak’ followed a series of reforms which sought to empower decentralised traditional political structures. A government anthropologist, Hans Cory, who was brought in to investigate the murders, linked the deaths to local failings of indirect rule and argued that opposition to the human-lion practice was hampered by the recognition accorded village headmen by the German and then the British governments, which undermined the authority of more influential clan and sub-clan elders. Second, the deaths were linked to the impact and innovations of the colonial judicial systems.41 Since witchcraft accusations could not be presented in these new courts it was suggested that perhaps local people substituted them with an embodied equivalent, a human-lion, whose identity could be revealed and who might be brought to trial not for nocturnal flights of imagination, but for plain murder. Compared to the cases in Sierra Leone and Congo, the motives in the Tanganyika murders demonstrated marked differences. Fifteen of those who hired the mbojo were brought to court. The conclusion drawn from the evidence in these cases, which led to six executions, was that ‘no mystical significance is attached to the despatch of the victims but this is done for the basest motives’.42 In each of the cases in which convictions were upheld the apparent murder motives were petty and mundane, and included a\n\nPratten_01_Ch1.indd 16\n\n5/4/07 9:54:39 AM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n17\n\nwoman’s refusal to sell beer, a quarrel between relatives over a small debt and a wife’s complaint that her husband was not supporting her. These motives, combined with accounts of how the lion-men were controlled by female witches,43 have led to the conclusion that the human-lion killings in Tanganyika were the result of a collapse in gender relations and ‘a coalescing of men against women’.44 All of the mysteries confronted in the big-cat killings elsewhere on the continent would figure in the man-leopard murders in Nigeria. The extent to which the investigators there were aware of the events in Sierra Leone, Congo and Tanganyika, however, is unclear. It seems unlikely that there was any formal liaison between the British colonial services. The Nigerian police files contained short press clippings and a copy of a report concerning the Singida lion-men. Senior officers in the Nigerian investigation tried in vain to consult accounts of events from Sierra Leone: one police officer on leave in London was frustrated in his efforts when he found that an account of the trials in Sierra Leone was out of print at Foyles bookshop. *\n\n*\n\n*\n\nWhile their knowledge of the details of these cases was limited, it is clear that the officers investigating the man-leopard cases in Nigeria nevertheless approached the murders armed with the vivid imagery of African leopard and lion-men. One of the magistrates sent to Opobo to hear the ‘leopard murder’ cases recalled having read an illustrated boys’ magazine featuring the leopard men of Sierra Leone which ‘depicted a group of hideous-looking monsters with cloaks and masks made of leopard-skin savaging their victims with specially fashioned steel claws’.45 Fascination with African were-beasts and human-leopards was very much in vogue during the first half of the twentieth century. The leopard men began to appear in literature, comics and films from the 1900s onwards.46 They became regular protagonists in dramatic tales set in the African colonies which played on the image of savage murder and barbaric rites, and served to embed popular perceptions of Africa among a European readership. The leopard and lion men stories were popular allegories for both European encounters with the African continent, and of African encounters with Europe. They invariably portrayed characters who straddled these boundaries – Europeans in Africa and Africans who had been educated in Europe. The human-leopards of Sierra Leone became a stock in trade of colonial fiction. A 1900 novel by John Cameron Grant, The Ethiopian, claimed to be based on events of 1876 in Sierra Leone and tells the story of a chief ’s son, Jowé, who seeks to uncover the secrets of his culture deprived him by his missionary education in London but who, in the course of exploring his past, forms the Human Leopard Society of Westeria.47 In Mary Gaunt’s The Arms of the Leopard, an educated African, James Craven\n\nPratten_01_Ch1.indd 17\n\n5/4/07 9:54:39 AM\n\n18\n\nTHE MAN-LEOPARD MURDERS\n\nMD, is engaged to an English woman. She falls for a political officer on the boat to West Africa and out of jealousy Craven enlists the Leopard Society to kill his rival.48 During the depression era the economic importance of the African colonies greatly increased, and authors and filmmakers in the 1930s were reinforcing and legitimising colonial political practices. For East Africa, lion-men societies figured as a feature of the safari genre, especially in novels relating the exploits of lone female explorers. John Crosbie’s 1938 novel The Lion Men, for instance, is a Kenyan tale of game-hunters, colonial officers and a Russian countess and their encounter with the lion-men of Wa-Ndoro. With the initiation rites of aspiring warriors, which required the killing of a lion or a man, criminalised by the colonial government, the lion-men’s underground society was overpowered by a punitive expedition, the burning of idols and the swearing of oaths of allegiance by the local chief.49 Two of the most popular figures of European boyhood fiction in the 1930s, Tintin and Tarzan, also encountered the leopard men in the pages of comics and pulp fiction of the period. In Hergé’s 1931 comic, Les aventures de Tintin: Reporter du Petit ‘Vingtième’ au Congo, the eponymous hero’s attempts to fend off diamond-smuggling gangsters led him to encounter the Anioto, a secret society of human-leopards organised, he is told, to halt the advance of the white men.50 Rice Burroughs’ Tarzan and the Leopard Men was serialised in the Blue Book magazine during 1932. The secret cult of the steel-clawed leopard men terrorised villages in the hunt for victims for their ‘savage rites’. Only Tarzan could save Kali Bwana, the white woman held captive in the village of the Leopard Men. The book, first published in 1935, was made into a film by Kurt Neumann and released in 1946 as Tarzan and the Leopard Woman, in which trader caravans were ambushed by an ‘evil leopard cult’ led by the beautiful but deadly Priestess Lea. Like the werewolf genre, leopard men as a literary subject became something of a standard for the horror adventure. Radio listeners in the United States heard Sherlock Holmes investigating the case of the ‘African Leopard Man’ in August 1944. In addition to the colonial narrative set in Africa, however, the detective dimension of the human-leopards, the unmasking of a cunning and lethal subterfuge, became a favourite for crime writers and movie-makers. The 1943 RKO movie The Leopard Man, directed by Jacques Tourneur, is a thriller set in New Mexico. A leopard (a panther in fact) belonging to a circus act is accidentally freed during a nightclub performance. A series of murders of young women killed at dusk is attributed to the prowling beast. It is the story of death foretold through prognostication and of outsiders confronting their colonial legacy. It is not a shape-shifting mystery, however, as the killer’s ruse of murder in the style of a leopard is the key dramatic device. The real killer is not the leopard, the circus act or\n\nPratten_01_Ch1.indd 18\n\n5/4/07 9:54:40 AM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n19\n\nthe glamorous nightclub performers. It is an expert in history and culture seconded to the investigation – the washed-up university lecturer! By the 1950s human-leopard stories continued to figure prominently in both English and French fiction, especially in boys’ stories and comics, in which young white men encountered the human-leopards in Africa and Europe. Many, including René Guillot’s adventure set in a game reserve, involved the ‘educated African’ figure.51 Through the 1950s and 1960s the leopard men continued to feature in European adventure comics, and as adversaries in the stories of Henri Vernes’ Bob Morane and Victor Hubinon’s Tiger Joe. The human-leopards of pulp fiction and ‘B-movies’ entered the television age in the late 1950s, featuring in an episode of Sheena: Queen of the Jungle in December 1956 when the heroine discovered uranium miners had been attacked not by leopards but by the ‘dreaded and despised’ ‘Leopard Man’. As with novels set in Sierra Leone and East Africa, the leopard murders of Nigeria also became the subject of fiction. James Shaw’s 1953 novel The Leopard Men was evidently influenced by the events described here and is an account of confrontations with humanleopards set on the English south coast and on the Cross River in southeastern Nigeria.52 Just how significant these factual and fictional accounts were to the human-leopards or their pursuers in Calabar Province of Nigeria between 1945 and 1947 is difficult to say. Questions were asked at the time as to whether the various ‘outbreaks’ were linked by the secret knowledge and transmission of a pan-African leopard murder organisation. The trail on this line of enquiry in Nigeria went cold and the idea was dismissed. It is difficult to deny, however, that factual and fictional accounts contributed to a range of assumptions that came to the fore during the murder investigations. Ideas about the very possibility of shape-shifting ‘leopard men’, that the Annang leopard men used costumes and claws, and that there was a formula for the rites they performed at the murder scenes were assumptions derived from this body of evidence. Despite the differences between the African ‘big-cat killing’ outbreaks in time, place, aesthetics and meanings, the comparative insights from colonial archives and fiction, set across the continent from the mid-nineteenth to mid-twentieth centuries, point to a broad set of ‘man-leopard mysteries’. These range from understanding the meaning and motives of the leopard subterfuge to the organisational possibilities revealed in initiation and shadowy secret society-type organisations. The central themes of ritual and resistance and of the social cleavages of gender and generation are also shared by fictional and academic interpretations alike. The puzzles that surround the human leopards encompass the difficulties of establishing forensic proofs and are further underpinned by questions about the cultural construction of truth, perception and explanation. And common to all\n\nPratten_01_Ch1.indd 19\n\n5/4/07 9:54:40 AM\n\n20\n\nTHE MAN-LEOPARD MURDERS\n\nthe human leopard accounts are apparently indeterminate links between murders and historical moments of social tension. A SOCIAL HISTOR Y OF MURDER\n\nThe purpose of my account is not only to revisit the criminal and forensic dimensions of the murder enquiries suggested by events in Calabar Province and elsewhere across the continent, but also to place the murders in their historical context. My aim is to ask how life in colonial Nigeria, in its cultural, social, political and economic aspects, contributed to the murders, and in turn what the murders and their investigations say about life in colonial Nigeria: [This] … does not imply that historians, disguised as judges, should try to re-enact the trials of the past … The specific aim of this kind of historical research should be the reconstruction of the relationship between individual lives and the contexts in which they unfold.53 To hope that a synthesis of actors and their motives would expose the ‘real’, as yet uncovered, reason for the man-leopard murders would be to claim access to insights and information that are now buried secrets, and to fall into precisely the trap of expecting an overarching explanatory theory that beset the police at the time. Rather, faced with the complex and contradictory evidence, we have to countenance complex and contradictory analysis. The lure of the sensational murder in Africa as elsewhere, therefore, is to interrogate the broader social concerns revealed by the investigation of the crimes.54 My account is informed throughout by this perspective and by the understanding that the murders reflected the historical trends of which they were a product. This lends itself to a way of writing which employs detailed investigation of individuals and their cultural worlds and of relating these to wider comparative and historical narratives. The importance of narrative in this context, and more broadly for the writing of historical anthropology, cannot be underestimated: It is a critical instrument of human agency, for it is the principal means by which agents integrate the temporal flow of their activities. Putting it another way, human beings produce sociocultural forms through an arch of memories, actions and intentions. Narrative is the way in which that arch may be expressed, rehearsed, shared and communicated. It is this which gives human action its inherent historicity or lived-in-timeness and which requires an anthropology that, to be adequate to its subject matter, should be essentially historical.55 Narrative, of course, offers the space for contradiction as well as temporalisation.56 Within such narrative discourse events serve as frames. Taking the murders as a single event, albeit an extended and complex one, is not a form of explanation in itself but ‘permits an intelligibility’ by framing and\n\nPratten_01_Ch1.indd 20\n\n5/4/07 9:54:40 AM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n21\n\ndelimiting a cluster of historical analyses.57 The event in this context serves less as a catalyst of change than to stage ‘the mingling of the prescribed and the contingent’.58 What I also hope to show is that narrative and structure, contingency and culture, history and anthropology, are not discrete methodological options; narrative bends to structure and structure shapes narrative. The structuring here is not exclusively Annang, Christian or colonial in origin, but is rather a structuring of the encounter between them and concerns the ‘existence and interaction between the cultural order as constituted in the society and as lived by the people: structure in convention and in action, as virtual and as actual’.59 These encounters produced persistent, contradictory and often unresolved effects. Recognising that history is re-authored, reinscribed and reconfigured, the emphasis on narratives and temporality in this account is an important check on a mode of historical anthropology that suggests resonances between past and present, but which elides an intervening period, and which avoids the forensic archive work necessary in accounting for historicity. This emphasis on historicity is especially important when we are reminded that colonialism was neither monolithic nor unchanging through history. As a result: We are confronted with the obvious fact that every document in a colonial archive – no matter how ignorant its author was of indigenous society or how unimportant his ideas were to future policy – is layered with the received account of earlier events and the cultural semantics of a political moment.60 Colonial conquest concerned both the territory of the ‘oil rivers’ hinterland, and the epistemological space associated with it. The exercise of power and the accumulation of knowledge were part of the same system. This project of documentation was both a product of the state bureaucracy and a set of technologies that bolstered state governance. It is in the colonial archives, the ‘cross-sections of contested knowledge’, therefore, that this study, in part, is based. The task here is twofold: to read between the lines and against its totalising classifications, but also to assess its rubrics of organisation and the continuities of its conventions: If a notion of colonial ethnography starts from the premise that archival production is both a process and a powerful technology of rule, then we need not only brush against the archives’ received categories. We need to read for its regularities, for its logic of recall, for its densities and distributions, for its consistencies of misinformation, omission, and mistake along the archival grain.61 One reason why the leopard murders lend themselves to this mode of analysis and cast such particular light on Annang society was because the\n\nPratten_01_Ch1.indd 21\n\n5/4/07 9:54:40 AM\n\n22\n\nTHE MAN-LEOPARD MURDERS\n\npolice had very little idea of why the murders were happening. They were so perplexed as to how the killings originated and how they could continue in the face of unprecedented surveillance that their search was extended over an ever-wider sociological and historical terrain. As reports of suspicious leopard-related deaths continued through 1946 and 1947 it became clear that the murders were linked not only to the ruses and rituals of the killers, but also to the broad impact of commercial, Christian and colonial relations on Annang society. These stories begin with the global political economy of the nineteenth century whose shifting contours were reflected in the Annang political and symbolic landscape. Annang livelihoods had been intimately connected to the Atlantic slave trade and from the mid-nineteenth century onwards were dependent on palm oil exports. Annang concepts of personhood and agency, along with the cultural significance of animals, beliefs in shapeshifting and Annang ways of perceiving and explaining, became the subject of speculation and investigation during the murder enquiries, and were shaped in part by these economic trajectories. Leopards, palm fruit and oil became powerful signifiers of gendered contests within household agricultural production and of the transformations wrought by new sources of wealth. The relationships between human society and nature, between men and women, and between young and old are thus central to grasping the meaning of the murders as a whole. Despite the economic significance of the palm oil-producing hinterland the villages in which the murders occurred constituted a remote administrative backwater far from the political and commercial centre of Calabar. The effects of the fluctuations of the global palm oil market, however, were intensified in this region because of a peculiar economic feature: a dual currency of shilling and manilla. In 1948 the manilla was redeemed and demonetised at a rate of 1 per 3d, precisely the rate of exchange almost a century earlier in 1856. While this might suggest that the manilla had been an especially stable currency, it would overlook a volatile history of exchange rate fluctuations that would create clear winners and losers in the Annang economy and corresponding patterns of protest and violence.62 The complex nature of power and authority in the Annang past became crucial to questions about relationships and rights in the colonial present of the 1940s. Annang is a lineage-based society, and the narrative here traces the ‘awkward fit’ of lineage incorporation into the colonial state apparatus.63 The rights in people and property, especially the rights of judicial sanction, which were contested by an Annang chieftaincy hierarchy would also prove central to an understanding of the murders. A feature common to ‘outbreaks’ of human leopard murders was that they appeared to coincide with historical moments of profound political disjunction in these ‘lineage trajectories’. Specifically, they were associated with shifts in the constitution\n\nPratten_01_Ch1.indd 22\n\n5/4/07 9:54:41 AM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n23\n\nof British-style modes of indirect rule in which the identity and authority of chiefs in relatively decentralised societies was reconfigured. Indeed, two of the leopard murder ‘outbreaks’ were connected by the administrative legacy of one man. As Governor of Tanganyika and then Nigeria, Sir Donald Cameron had introduced to both countries during the 1920s and 1930s a blueprint of procedures to accommodate ‘decentralised’ societies within the scheme of indirect rule.64 The powers of leaders from lineages, villages and clans, however, were counterbalanced by those of secret societies, especially the leopard society (ékpê), the ancestral masquerade (ékpó) and the warrior cult (áwíè òwò or ékón). The shady origin and organisation of the ‘man-leopard society’ linked the murders to another trajectory, that of the history of Annang secret societies. After initial ambivalence, secret societies were the subject of subsequent criminalisation and across Nigeria ‘an organization that started off as the defender of traditional values ended up as a thoroughgoing criminal enterprise’.65 Yet, throughout the period the secret society provided a powerful and persistent idiom to characterise the organisation behind nefarious acts, including rioting, prostitution, kidnapping, night guards and robbery gangs. The murders were also set against a shifting religious landscape. Narratives of Annang religious encounters highlight the imperatives of conversion in the early years of the Qua Iboe Mission and stress the cultural continuity and localised meanings of religious change. The analysis of pathways to conversion in this context points to the critical role of brokers of religious power and knowledge, along with the dispossessed, the old and the young who first entered the enquirers’ classes.66 Despite the Qua Iboe Mission’s predominance in this region, the murders took place amid an apparent crisis with the growth of prophetic Christian congregations which capitalised on the Mission’s formalism and the syncretic charismatic impulse of the ‘Spirit Movement’ which had swept across the Province in 1927 and annually throughout the 1930s. Those most threatened by this development were the Annang diviners (ídíbn) and their monopoly on healing and prognostication. The colonial history of the Annang villages affected by the murders, like south-eastern Nigeria as a whole, was punctuated by three pivotal events: the Aro Expedition in 1901, the Women’s War in 1929 and the Second World War of 1939–45. The legacy of each event would contribute directly to the way in which the murders were perceived. The British subjugation of the Aro’s shrine at Arochukwu in 1901 had a direct impact on Annang populations by bringing Abak on the western bank of the Qua Iboe river within colonial circuits, and on the way in which Annang social organisation and religious practice were framed within long-running suspicions of slavery. The fallout of the Women’s War would have profound implications\n\nPratten_01_Ch1.indd 23\n\n5/4/07 9:54:41 AM\n\n24\n\nTHE MAN-LEOPARD MURDERS\n\nfor the governance of south-eastern Nigeria as reforms to the local courts and councils in its aftermath, which were designed to resolve an emerging intergenerational rift, instead turned them into spheres of intense political contest. The immediate backdrop to the murders was the fallout from the Second World War and an economic landscape of commodity shortages, cutbacks in administrative personnel and demobilisation. It was also a moment at which the antagonism of seniority which dominated political life throughout the colonial period appeared to shift decisively in favour of the educated nationalists at the chiefs’ expense.67 As a political structure and a condition of being, the colonial state was riven by contradictions located between the imperatives of mission and mercantilism, and between stasis and reform.68 As a cultural project of control colonialism transformed domination into a variety of effects that masked both conquest and rule.69 As an ethnography of empire, my account is an attempt to focus on the contingencies of colonial rule, to understand how it altered the form and terrain of conflict and introduced ‘new political languages, new powers, new social groups, new desires and fears, new subjectivities’.70 Analysis of the tensions of empire is often limited by the failure to study critically indirect rule’s discourse of representation and indigenous resistance and accommodation to it.71 This study, therefore, looks beyond the grand oppositions and seeks to explore ‘in the interstices of power structures, in the intersection of particular agendas, in the political spaces opened by new and renewed discourses and by subtle shifts in ideological ground’.72 These included tension in relations between colonial rulers and their subjects, between norms of reciprocity and capitalist exchange, between young and old, and between men and women. The underlying theme of this narrative is of tensions along the lines of gender and generation, though we are well reminded that: There is nothing surprising in the fact that ‘women’ and ‘minors’ should have turned the colonial change of scale to their advantage in order to further their ancestral struggle against social elders. We should beware of any teleological or populist faux pas.’73 Relations between the sexes are often the first aspects of social life to be affected by historical change.74 Today it is widely held that, ‘You cannot talk of the leopard men without talking of women’. This statement speaks to the uncertainties within the household that were current at the time of the murders. More generally, it relates to the need to analyse a series of contested discourses in which men sought to control or oppress women on the one hand, while women effectively challenged social and cultural restraints on the other.75 Throughout the period covered in this account, marriage, divorce, adultery and prostitution were ‘telling witnesses of the factors of power, ideology and differentiation’.76\n\nPratten_01_Ch1.indd 24\n\n5/4/07 9:54:41 AM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n25\n\nThe narrative of generation traces the shifting engagement of progressives and nationalists as critics of their fathers and their chiefs, and as the self-appointed intermediaries between society and the colonial state. Within this social history of Nigerian nationalism the role of the Ibibio Union’s development during the 1930s was pivotal and should be seen in relation to a competitive imperative ‘to fill the vacuum of leadership created by the conservatism and ineffectiveness of the colonial administration, and the poverty of missionary enterprise’.77 The dichotomy of citizens and subjects – citizens in the racially segregated urban world of colonial civil society, and subjects in the ‘decentralised despotism’ of traditional rulers – is an overplayed distinction since these orbits were as interwoven then as they are today.78 This analytic should not be confused with the emergence of a colonial public sphere, especially during the Second World War, which was constructed on the reification of these categories. This was a sphere of discourses and claims to the rights of citizenship during this period that was led by the ‘been-tos’, the ‘Uncle Toms’, the self-proclaimed ‘reading public’ and the ‘improvement unions’, which had long represented an attempt to attain some form of ‘accommodation with modernity’.79 The significance of the man-leopard murders and the investigations into them is that they revealed the fault-lines that these encounters produced. To use a theatrical metaphor, the whole cast were present on stage simultaneously. It was an ensemble of husbands and wives, chiefs and elites, churchgoers and cult members, judges and litigants, nationalists and conservatives, criminals and policemen. And their script, though extraordinary, was also familiar. These characters’ stories spoke most clearly of the ways in which social and political cleavages – gender, generation, religion, justice and relationships between society and state – were worked out in Annang society. A paradox of the murders, therefore, is the way in which some of the most mysterious and secretive events in colonial Nigerian history reveals rarely glimpsed intimacies of everyday life.\n\nPratten_01_Ch1.indd 25\n\n5/4/07 9:54:41 AM\n\n2 OF LEOPARDS AND LEADERS: ANNANG SOCIETY TO 1909\n\nThis chapter concerns the constitution of Annang society and the intersections of corporate and individual modes of identification. It outlines the key elements of Annang personhood in relation to lineage, initiation and conceptions of the soul. It links the genealogy of shape-shifting beliefs and a shifting symbolic landscape to gendered and generational tensions wrought by a succession of changes from yams to slaves, and from slaves to palm oil, in local modes of production during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Finally, the chapter examines the relationship between Christianity and colonialism in patterns of conquest and conversion within Annang society at the turn of the twentieth century. P OWE R A N D P E R S O N H O O D\n\nIdentities in Annang society are conceived in intimate and intersecting relationships between people, place and the past. Personhood concerns ancestral relationships within the lineage, relationships with cohorts through initiation, and relationships with the natural world through animal affinities. Annang selfhood is therefore internally constituted of various external elements.1 These three main components, which are changing and contingent, configure social and political identities, shape conceptions of agency and explanation and, crucially in Annang beliefs, they configure a further aspect of the self, power. Ancestral links to the lineage (ékpûk) are established at birth when burial of the umbilical cord connects the newborn to the village soil on which their ancestors lived and in which they are buried.2 Concepts of belonging in Annang society are primarily conceived in terms of such associations with the earth and of being a ‘child of the soil’ (áyín ísbn). The close proximity between young children, earth and ancestors is captured in the saying ‘ptb áyín èdè ékpó’ (‘children are the spirits of our ancestors’).3 Each person is a reincarnation of the spirit of one such ancestor returning from a previous life in the village of the ghosts (óbíò ékpó). This re-identification is acknowledged soon after birth because of a physical resemblance or familiar trait, and is confirmed when the child assumes the ancestor’s name (a relationship known as àkpbn).4 An individual’s sense of selfhood is therefore conceived in relation to knowledge of the family’s past, and to patterns of settlement that\n\nPratten_02_Ch2.indd 26\n\n5/4/07 9:55:34 AM\n\nOF LEOPARDS AND LEADERS\n\n27\n\nconstituted patrilineal identities. As individuals traced themselves through fathers and grandfathers in their personal names, so places were resonant of the past as farms, compounds and villages recalled the names of their founders. This ‘landscape of names’ was and remains a changing model of segmentary society, at once both topography and history.5 The lineage founders to whom these relationships are traced were the frontiersmen of southern Annang society, though they were often marginal characters. The first settlers were outcasts and refugees, along with hunters and hungry farmers. The founders of Annang villages were fleeing from inter-village skirmishing and chieftaincy disputes, and settled permanently in the lodges they had built for hunting trips and expanding yam farms. Though epic journeys involving heroic river-crossings form part of the narrative tradition, individually these settlers had not travelled far. Local accounts suggest that the primary centre of Annang distribution was the nucleus of villages around Abak from where the bulk of the population was derived.6 Contemporary village and lineage charters suggest that expansion commenced at least twenty generations ago and ended fifteen generations later, when all the land to the west of Abak was occupied.7 Abak represented the key axis of migration for both the Ibibio and Annang and was structurally divided into two parts which faced respectively east and west; the eastern became the Ibibio, the western the Annang. In its simplest form the pattern of settlement and expansion consisted of a line of settlements reaching away from the parent village to occupy a strip of territory which widened only when it extended beyond the communities on either side of it.8 Unlike the Ibibio, however, who expanded along contiguous trajectories to form largely integral groups, the Annang experience was more complex and resulted in a mosaic of villages and affiliations. Conflicts and inequalities in land supply led lineage segments with sufficient labour to sustain rotational slash-and-burn cultivation to break away and request land from the families of original settlers elsewhere.9 The process by which settled lineages became divided between ‘landowners’ (àmànà ísbn, first settlers) and ‘latecomers’ (àdídún, strangers) then involved the exchange of a genealogical for a territorial definition of group identity. Consequently, this ‘disjunctive’ pattern of lineage expansion meant that equivalence and opposition between segments (in a pure segmentary system) was replaced by the principle of non-equivalence and complementarity.10 A husband and his wife with their children formed an ìdíp, literally the ‘belly’, and as this unit extended with the addition of wives and generations it formed a household (úfck). These family compounds combined as exogamous patrilineages (ékpûk) in which the head of the most senior family was recognised as lineage head (èté or óbcn ékpûk). They presided over a lineage meeting (àfé úkct), named after the day on which palm wine was presented\n\nPratten_02_Ch2.indd 27\n\n5/4/07 9:55:38 AM\n\nFigure 2.1 Annang and their neighbours Pratten_02_Ch2.indd 28\n\n5/4/07 9:55:38 AM\n\nOF LEOPARDS AND LEADERS\n\n29\n\nto them, and which distributed land and adjudicated in minor disputes between lineage members. As new lineages formed, either through fission or new arrivals, the ékpûk heads formed the core of a village council (èsòp) and the senior man of the founding lineage was recognised as the village head (óbdn ísbn).11 As this process reproduced itself, so new villages (óbíò or ídún) were formed and allegiance to the parent village, the home of the original settlers, was expressed in common observance of a communal deity (qdêm), food prohibitions (ìbét) and recognition of the àkúkú (pl. okúkú), a descendant of the original settlers and the group’s ritual and political head.The sphere of an àkúkú’s influence was mapped onto the landscape by an annual rite of ‘first fruits’ (ndònò).12 Allegiance to the àkúkú was distinguished by attendance at his court (èsòp ìkpá ísbn), the fees and fines from which constituted the major part of his economic base. Intermediaries from each village (áyáráfbt – literally, the ‘man in-between’) provided the physical and political link between parent and satellite villages which together formed a village group or clan (ìkpá ísbn).13 Àkúkú chieftaincy, however, was subject to competing claims of genealogy (between factions within the parent village), of geography (as distances increased between parent and satellite villages) and of ritual performance (in which failure to redistribute incurred sanction and the loss of followers).14 As elsewhere along the West African coast the relationship between the symbols and vocabularies of animals and chiefs were intimately woven; animals were the ‘ideal incarnations … that conjured forth intense ontological speculation’.15 Allegiance to the àkúkú was also recognised in tribute in the form of hunted leopards. The right to receive a leopard and to carry out the appropriate purification and sharing rituals concerning it marked, as in Banyang society, the independent and superior status of the leader of one order of residential grouping above less significant groups.16 Leopards were therefore a means of acknowledging a chief’s authority, although the animal associations of Annang chieftaincy were not exclusively linked to the leopard in the same way as Banyang leaders where the leopard (nkwo) was associated so closely with leadership and political authority. Other animals – elephants and vultures – were also of symbolic importance to the Annang hierarchy. As messengers of the highest deity (àbàssì énybn) vultures were necessary witnesses at the installation of a chief, and the elephant’s tusk (qnûk éníìn) was a key element of the chieftaincy regalia. Its physical possession staked a claim to the office, and it summoned the village to war and to peace. Nevertheless, by redistributing leopard meat on the basis of seniority between fellow village or lineage heads, chiefs could in turn mark out allegiances and obligations. This tribute also acknowledged the chief ’s position as the paramount public peacekeeper. In such a dynamic and fluid political context, the popular recognition accorded to those who settled\n\nPratten_02_Ch2.indd 29\n\n5/4/07 9:55:40 AM\n\n30\n\nTHE MAN-LEOPARD MURDERS\n\ncases, mediated in conflicts and supervised the disposal of poisons was a key index of power. Only a chief could remove those parts from a leopard which might be used in the preparation of poisons – its bile sack (èdídôt) and whiskers (pkám).17 The leopard’s whiskers are not in themselves poisonous. When ground up in a mortar and mixed into soup or stew, however, the chitinous powder becomes an undetectable and lethal cocktail since the shards can scarify the gut when consumed. Like all medicine (íbdk) leopard’s whiskers had to be rendered impotent by burning or by throwing them into a pit latrine. The python’s (àsáwe) similarly potent properties also had to be disposed of publicly by the chief. As the makers of this history of settlement, and the basis of individual and collective identity, ancestors and ancestral worship formed a key aspect of Annang religious life. From lineage and village founders onwards, generations of ancestors are recalled and invoked at household shrines (ísó ékpó – the"
