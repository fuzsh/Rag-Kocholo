        "text": "​© Chris Sam\n\nCalabar which is also referred as “Canaan City”is a city in Cross River State, in south southern Nigeria. The original name for Calabar was Akwa Akpa, from the Efik language. The city is adjacent to the Calabar and Great Qua rivers and creeks of the Cross River (from its inland delta).\n\nCalabar is the capital of Cross River State. Administratively, the city is divided into Calabar Municipal and Calabar South LGAs. It has an area of 406 square kilometres (157 sq mi) and had a population of 371,022 at the 2006 census.\n\nCurrently with an estimated population of over 1.4 Million residents, Calabar is truly the Tourism Haven of Nigeria. The ancient city which is watered by the Cross River and the Great Qua Rivers has a long history and a fascinating heritage. Nearly after a century of contact with European sailors, Calabar gained recognition as an International Sea Port in the 16th century. From 17th to 19th century, Calabar became a major slave trade port. Although Calabar seating in the Bight of Biafra does not have the impressive forts found in Ghana and Senegal because the estuary was a safe haven for slave traders and the people on its shoreline were cooperative and acted as trading agents to the slave merchants creating a buffer from inland attacks, the region accounted for approximately 30 percent of Africans carted away to the new world (America) as slaves from Africa, representing the largest exit of slaves from a single point in Africa\n\nThe ancient city of Calabar was the first to utilize money as means of mercantile in West Africa. This ancient money in Efik was called ‘Okpoho’. This money was later known as the manilas. With the abolition of slave trade in South Eastern Nigeria from 1820 – 1850, Calabar’s main export became palm oil.\n\nCalabar is truly a city of firsts and the ancient city is credited with developing one of the first African alphabets and scripts for communication called the Nsibidi. It is a set of traditional ideographic symbols developed by the Ekpe Society a traditional association responsible for protecting and defending the kingdom against all foreign influence. Nsibidi is still in use today by the Ekpe Society.\n\nOn the chronicle of the city’s firsts, is the fact that Calabar was the seat of the Government of the Oil River Protectorate and then the Southern Protectorate, the building that is today known as the Old Residency Museum was ordered by Consul Hewett in 1882 from Britain and it arrived Calabar in 1884 where it was assembled. It became the residence of the Consuls and High Commissioners that administered the Protectorate.\n\nMost historical records indicates that Calabar gains prominence during the early part of the 17th century. This was largely due to the increasing trading relations between the African tribes like the Efik and Ibibio people. Calabar turned into a major port with fish, bananas and cassava being traded among the surrounding communities. However, the increasing trade eventually caught the attention of the colonial powers which were aggressively increasing their presence in Africa during this time.\n\nCalabar has a great potential in hospitality & tourism. Its relative peace and tranquility, coupled with low crime rate, clean and natural environment, choice tourist attractions and second to none hospitality nature of the people has made it a tourism haven with vast potentials and opportunities."
