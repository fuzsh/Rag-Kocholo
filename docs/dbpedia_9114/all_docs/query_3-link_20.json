        "text": "The Oil, The War and The Forgotten Amalgamation:\n\nAs you make your way through the Nigerian educational system and peruse through its attendant litany of mediocre texts, you’ll more or less, come ‘only’ of the knowledge that there was an amalgamation between the Northern and the southern Protectorates in 1914 which led to the formation of Nigeria as a single cohesive British-administered territory; with Lagos as the colonial capital. Hence, the term; 'The Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria’.\n\nThis is not ‘entirely’ true. There was another very significant amalgamation which preceded the 1914 amalgamation; the 1900 amalgamation of the British Niger Coast Protectorate and the Chartered Territories of Royal Niger Company to form the Protectorate of Southern Nigeria.\n\nThe Niger Coast Protectorate was originally called; 'the Oil Rivers Protectorate' and lasted from 1884 – 1900. The regions making up the protectorate were apportioned to Britain at the Berlin conference of 1884/85. The protectorate was situated in the areas designated as the 'Niger Delta' to include present Nigerian states of; Abia, Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross River, Delta, Edo, Imo, Ondo, and Rivers.\n\nAlthough, all the above states are oil-bearing states, its name 'Oil Rivers Protectorate' derives from the 'palm oil' that was the chief produce of the delta area and nearby hinterlands, replacing slave trade. Palm oil was highly sought-after by the British, for use as an industrial lubricant for machinery - following the emergence of industrialisation in Britain. Crude oil was subsequently found (in commercial quantities) in 1956, Oloibiri, present day Bayelsa state.\n\nAs a result of the unfavourable palm oil trade agreements between king’s and Oba’s of this protectorate, a series of revolts and wars ‘oil wars’ broke out between the kings and the Royal Niger Company – backed by the British Government Royal Navy. These revolts had led to the exiles and deaths of King Jaja of Opobo and Oba Ovonramwen of Benin. The revolt – straw which broke the Camel’s back was the Oil war of 29 January, 1895. King Koko led more than a thousand men in an attack against the Royal Niger Company’s headquarters, which was in Akassa in present day Bayelsa state. King Koko had captured over 40 British workers and wanted to use them to negotiate better trade deals but was rebuffed. He, allegedly, killed and ate these hostages, ceremoniously with his men. On February 20, 1895, Britain’s Royal Navy, under Admiral Beford attacked Brass, and burned it to the ground. Many Nembe people died while an outbreak of smallpox killed more. King Koko went into exile and subsequently died (in exile).\n\nFollowing the Brass Oil war, there was public outrage against the Royal Niger Company on the way the company treated the people and their acceptability declined. The charter which enabled the Royal Niger Company to administer the Niger Delta region was revoked in 1899. The Royal Niger Company was forced to sell its holdings and territories (which would later be merged to form Nigeria) to the British government for a paltry £865,000 and this provided the inroad for full-fledged colonialism in 1900 and amalgamation in 1914.\n\nDo you see it now? Nigeria was a figment of George T. Goldies’ distorted imagination. Both amalgamations were tactical moves to create a huge – monstrous, single-cohesive economic entity which will be more convenient (to administer), viable and beneficial to the motherland – England. Pre-British advent, the geographical territories which presently constitute Nigeria were previously; divided sovereign Empires, Kingdoms, Caliphates, City-states and autonomous nations.\n\nThe first ‘1900’ amalgamation is as important as the 1914 amalgamation, especially to the South-South and South-Eastern people of Nigeria because it tells, inter alia, the tale of two regions united by Oil, potent pre-colonial civilisations and a long-standing comradeship — bond which has existed between these two sister regions."
