Reflecting several emphases in recent scholarship, Professor Isichei focuses on the changing modes of production, on gender relations and on ecology, laying particular stress on viewing history ‘from below’. A distinc-\n\ntive theme is to be found in her analyses of cognitive history.\n\nThe work falls into three sections. The first comprises a historiographic analysis, covering the period from the dawn of prehistory to the end of the Early Iron Age. The second and third sections are, for the most part,\n\norganised\n\non\n\nregional\n\nlines;\n\nthe\n\nsecond\n\nsection\n\nends\n\nin the\n\nsixteenth\n\ncentury; the third carries the story on to 1870. Explaining each facet of the continent’s history with exceptional erudition, balance and sympathy, Professor Isichei displays both an immense learning and a thorough command of the literature. A second volume, now in preparation, will cover the period from 1870 to\n\n1995.\n\nA history of African societies to 1870\n\nA history of African societies to 1870 ELIZABETH\n\nISICHEI\n\nUniversity of Otago\n\nPublished by the Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge The Pitt Building, Trumpington Street, Cambridge CB2 1RP 40 West 20th Street, New York, NY 10011-4211, USA 10 Stamford Road, Oakleigh, Melbourne 3166, Australia © Cambridge University Press 1997 First published 1997 Printed in Great Britain at the University Press, Cambridge A catalogue record for thts book 1s available from the British Library A catalogue record for this book 1s available from the Library of Congress\n\nISBN 0 521 45444 1 hardback\n\nISBN 0 521 45599 5 paperback\n\nContents\n\nList of illustrations Acknowledgements\n\npage 1x\n\nNWN\n\n&\n\nW\n\nDh\n\n—\n\nPart |: Continental perspectives Perimeters Prelude: Africa and the historians\n\nOut of Africa: the precursors Environment, language and art c. 10,000 — c. 500 BCE Producing more food c. 10,000 — c. 500 BCE\n\nCopper and iron c. 600 BCE to c. 1000 CE Models: production, power and gender\n\nPart Il: Regional histories to the sixteenth century 79 9 10 11 12 13 14\n\nCentral Africa Eastern Africa Africa south of the Limpopo Northern Africa to the seventh century CE Northern Africa from the seventh century CE The North-East The Western Sudan West Africa: from the savanna to the sea\n\n101 103 120 141 151 172 196 213 239\n\nPart Ill: Regional histories toc. 1870\n\n261\n\n15 16 17 18 19 20 21\n\n263 291 313 323 341 360 389\n\nNorthern Africa The Western Sudan in a ume of jihad The Eastern and Central Sudan The Atlantic slave trade West Africa to 1800 West Africa 1800 to 1870 Central Africa\n\nVill 22 23\n\nContents Southern Africa East and East Central Africa\n\nNotes Some suggestions for further reading Index\n\n409 431 456 559 570\n\nIllustrations\n\nOm\n\nWh\n\n=\n\nFigures Human evolution Long-term climate change African language families: Afroasiatic African language families: Nilo-Saharan African language families: Kordofanian and Niger-Congo\n\npage\n\n31 41 48 50 51\n\nCON\n\nDAU\n\n&\n\nWN —\n\nMaps Human evolution: archaeological sites African language families Bantu languages Cradles of domestication Central Africa Eastern Africa South Africa Northern Affica in antiquity Northern Africa (seventh to twelfth centuries)\n\nEgypt and the Near East: Fatimids and Mamluks The North-East The Western Sudan (to c. 1600)\n\nLower Guinea The Western and Central Sudan: the nineteenth century\n\nSouthern Africa: the nineteenth century East and Central Africa: the nineteenth century\n\n26 49 52 61 104 121 142 164 174 183 197 214 240 292 410 432\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis book was begun at Cambridge in 1991 and so it seems particularly appropriate that it 1s published by Cambridge University Press. I am deeply indebted to Jessica Kuper, for her patience in waiting for the manuscript, and her flexibility about its length. I am also profoundly grateful to the book’s three anonymous readers, whose assessments were enormously encouraging and helpful. I visited Cambridge during a seven-month sabbatical leave. I am most grateful to the Fellows of Clare Hall, Cambridge, who elected me first to a Visiting Fellowship, and later to a Life Membership. During my sabbatical I also visited the University of Washington at Seattle, where I have the warmest memories of the kindness of Simon Ottenberg. I acknowledge, with gratitude, research funding from the University of Otago Division of Humanities Research Grants Committee, and a most timely grant from the University Research Grants Committee towards the costs of maps and indexing. I am grateful to my invisible friends of the Internet, especially the members of Nuafrica. Much of this book has been written while I have been running a university department and carrying a heavy teaching load. I am greatly indebted to the helpfulness and efficiency of the Religious Studies Secretary, Sandra Lindsay, and of the staff of the University Library, particularly the Reference Department, for whom no interloan request was too obscure. My beloved youngest son, Frank, was my companion during my sabbatical, as he is now, in Dunedin. It 1s dedicated to him.\n\nPart\n\n|\n\nContinental perspectives\n\nPerimeters\n\nThe lyf so short, the craft so long to lerne, Th’assay so hard... Chaucer, The Parlement of Foules, I\n\nI began original research into the African past in 1967, and taught history in African universities, first in Tanzania, and then in Nigeria, for sixteen years. My research led me to fieldwork in remote villages, and to both European and local archives. I was the first historian of the Igbo people of south-eastern Nigeria — whose population is greater than that of many independent nations — and of Plateau State. Now that I am much closer to the end of my career than its beginning, I felt drawn to attempt the history of the continent to which I devoted the best energies of my adult life. A legend recorded among a small people in central Nigeria tells of a hero who plucks a blade of grass and through the hole reveals a whole new world.’ He is then empowered by its discovery. Something of this magical transformation 1s experienced both by the westerner who embarks on a voyage to the cultures of other peoples and by the African who explores her own past. And the end of all ous exploring Will be to arrive where we started And know the place for the first time.”\n\nThe difficulty, of course, is that there is an infinite number of possible Afmcan histories. Our choices are limited by the available source materials, and also, to an extent greater than we might care to admit, by convention — the paths trodden\n\nby our predecessors. A historian who confined himself to a single region and a single theme reported, ‘Scholars who attempt to synthesise a wide range of material quickly discover that they have a limited number of tools and an infinite\n\narray of intractable difficulties.’*\n\nI have spoken of directions chosen by other historians, but there are many such paths. At one level, this book is a series of conversations with alternauve views of the African past — particularly, though not exclusively, those most conveniently called Africanist and radical — categories explored in the pages which follow. These are debates to which my own earlier writings have contributed; my own voice in the past is one of those with which I engage. No single model does justice to the complexity of a multidimensional past. This book is organised around a number of interlocking themes. Perhaps the\n\n4\n\nContinental perspectives\n\nmost important 1s ecology, the interaction between African communities and their very different environments. Consciously or unconsciously, historians reflect the preoccupations of the present in their interpretation of the past. For obvious reasons, contemporary historians pay considerable attention to famines, epidemics and droughts, and these are themes which recur in the pages which follow. But a model based on scarcity does not do full justice to economies which often produced a surplus both of food and treasure. ‘Here hunger is not known,’ said the nineteenth-century Lozi on the Zambezi flood-plain.* Scarcity is a powerful explanatory tool for exploring the African past; but West and West Central Africa had some of the most varied currencies of the pre-industrial world. Like Africa’s art treasures, they do not reflect want. At the heart of all African history is the productive base — agriculture, pastoralism,\n\ncrafts,\n\nmineral\n\nextraction,\n\nfishing,\n\nhunting\n\nand\n\ngathering.\n\nspinners\n\nand\n\nweavers;\n\nA true\n\nintegration of gender into historical writing is to be attained not by concentrating on real or imaginary queens — though both find a place in this history — but by analysing production. Women often did the farming, and always processed and\n\ncooked\n\nfood;\n\nthey\n\nwere\n\noften\n\nthe\n\npotters,\n\nthe\n\nin some\n\nsocieties they processed salt, and panned alluvial gold. Off the coast of Angola, they dived for shells used as currency. In West Africa, women usually controlled trade in foodstuffs in local markets; men traded in slaves, ivory or gold.” The relations of production are central to an understanding of the political process. Radical history, however, has sometimes been criticised for concentrating on structures to a point where the particularity of the local community, or the life of the individual, becomes invisible.\n\nThis book is an essay in history from below. It required no conscious effort to populate it with people — they found their way into the narrative naturally and those who found no space fought for inclusion. History from below assumes a knowledge of the political superstructure; a study of the Crowd in the French Revolution presupposes some knowledge of a particular sequence of events in time. The historian of Africa cannot ignore the rise and fall of empires, which provide a much-needed chronological structure, and which impinged, of course, in varying ways and to varying degrees, on the life of the poor. African history has moved beyond an exclusive preoccupation with Great States and Big Men, but the study of the past, at least on a continental scale, can find no intelligible shape without them. And when we focus on individual experience, we find, inevitably, that it is the captains and the kings who are most fully documented. Cognitive\n\nhistory\n\nis a central\n\nespecially in the Islamic world, be gleaned from oral literature. verbal forms, such as sculpture, difficult or impossible to locate\n\ntheme\n\nof this\n\nstudy;\n\nsome\n\nAfrican\n\nsocieties,\n\nhave left a legacy of wntten texts, and much can But many cognitive maps are represented in nonbody painting or texule designs. These are often in time, and when we interpret them in written\n\ntexts there is a danger that we are in fact inventing something new. In a sense, of course, the whole business of writing about Africa ts an invention, and much has been written in recent years on the artificiality of the enterprisc. A fundamental insight of much writing on Africa is the paramount importance of people (rather than land, or possessions). This is abundantly documented tn\n\nPerimeters\n\n5\n\noral sources, and is often adduced to explain domestic slavery. This leaves us with a problem — why were people sold abroad in the Atlantic or Indian Ocean slave trades, or killed in religious rituals? (Neither phenomenon, of course, was universal.) There seems to have been, in the thought of many African societies, a profound tension between different loci of value — the need to share and the need to accumulate, the desire for followers and the retention of treasures. Kings accumulated treasures — regalia, valuable cloth, sculptures in ivory, copper or gold. But in the nineteenth century, the home of an Igbo villager was also likely to include a sealed room for the family’s wealth, often in cowries or manillas. It is a profound irony that these currencies, introduced by Europeans, became worthless in the colonial period. African peoples tended to view the world as a zero sum game, where the prosperity of one is obtained at the expense of another. Witchcraft stereotypes grow out of this tension; it has been called the dark side of kinship.° This book falls into three sections. The first deals with questions of historiography and interpretation, and with prehistory, ending with the Early Iron Age. The second and third sections are organised on a regional basis — the dividing line between them lies, very approximately, in the sixteenth century. History, of course, refuses to fit neatly into chronological or regional divisions. Zwangendaba’s career began in Natal and ended in Tanzania. To reflect this extreme artificiality, I have deliberately used different geographic units of analysis in successive sections. The sixteenth century can be taken as a dividing line between ‘states based on local resources’ and ‘political structures heavily reliant on outside sources’’ — largely through the impact of merchant capitalism. This period has been called an age of commercial elites and warlords — African, Muslim and European.® But many peoples were little affected by the outer world until well into the twentieth century; the states of the Western Sudan or the Swahili coast were involved in it long before 1600. This book ends in 1870; a second volume is planned, to cover the period 1870-1995. I am mindful, however, of the Igbo proverb that no one is certain of his meal until he has eaten it! It is very\n\nfully documented,\n\nand\n\nI have\n\nsometimes\n\nthought\n\nuneasily\n\nof the\n\nMoroccan scholar of the early eighteenth century, who gave 2,100 lectures on the particle ‘b-’.”? Data about sources are located primarily in notes, to integrate them closely with the text and thus enable the student to explore the literature on which a particular interpretation is based. I have tried to provide, within the covers of a single book, materials with which to explore themes as diverse as whether the Almoravids conquered ancient Ghana, and the impact of internauonal capitalism on the San. The great weakness of general histories of Africa is reductionism; because they cover vast expanses of space and time, they move at a very high level of generality, and the variety and multiplicity of African realities become invisible. Reductionism is not necessarily avoided by writing at considerable length, but it is certainly not avoided without it. I have endeavoured\n\nto write, not only history\n\nfrom below but a history in the round, a history which finds a place for art on the\n\n6\n\nContinental perspectives\n\nrocks,\n\nwitchcraft\n\nbeliefs,\n\nmasking\n\nand\n\nspirit\n\npossession\n\ncults,\n\nas\n\nwell\n\nas\n\nfor\n\ncooking and the kitchen garden. The modern study of Africa began in a state of euphoria; scholars believed, with Nkrumah, that if the political kingdom was attained, everything else would follow. The rapid collapse of parliamentary democracy and an ever spiralling external indebtedness soon undermined this optimism, which a partial return to democracy has done little to restore. The hopes of the optimists now focus on tny Eritrea, and on the fragile balance of Mandela’s South Africa. Africanists sometimes fail to realise how little is known about Africa in the world around them. They would do well to reflect on the extent of their own ignorance of the history of Melanesia, or of Siberia. They are fond of affirming that it is no longer necessary to defend the existence of African history as a discipline. But, engaged in intricate debates among themselves, they often fail to realise how narrow is the beam of light all their industry sheds. The general reader’s image of Africa 1s derived from television and the press — a melancholy composite of Aids, famine, coups and civil war. Racial prejudice feeds on ignorance, as do political misjudgements. In contemporary Africa, hard-pressed governments sometimes question the utility of academic history. But both coups and corruption spring from despair — a despair which in its turn is rooted in a lack of historical perspective. A knowledge of the past is a necessary dimension of African self-esteem and sense of identity. None\n\nof this, of course,\n\nromanticised.\n\nmeans\n\nthat the African past should\n\nbe idealised,\n\nor\n\nSpeak of me as I am; nothing extenuate, Nor set down aught in malice.\n\nOthello’s words are an excellent guideline for the historian of Africa. The crisis of Africa has become a truism, not only among journalists but in the scholarly community. Many believe that there is indeed a cnisis without precedent, attributed variously to exploitation by the so-called developed countries, ecological catastrophe, African misgovernment — or a combination of all three. African scholars have been particularly resolute in their analysis of the last variable. Others believe that the crisis lies less in objective reality than in our perceptiens of it,'° that it is one more in a long series of distortions in foreigners’ perceptions of Africa. Undoubtedly, exploring Africa’s past sheds light on the dilemmas of the present. I would not wish to begin this study, or end it, on a note of gloom. Instead, I would like to borrow the words ofa much earlier expatriate in Africa, which were substantially true of my own long stay. (I cannot, in all honesty, endorse his praises of the water supplies!) They come from the Kebre Negast, the national epic of Ethiopia, finally committed to writing in 1320. In it, Azariah, the Jewish pricst who accompanies Menclik to Ethiopia, has this to say: ‘And from the ume that we have arrived in your country everything that we have seen hath appeared\n\ngood to us. ... And\n\nas for what we have seen there is nothing detestable, and\n\nthere is nothing malign in what we hear.’!!\n\nPrelude: Africa and the historians\n\nAfter a while the truth of the old tales changed. What was true before, became false afterwards. A Kuba elder’\n\nWritten sources\n\nAll history is ideological, because all history reflects the concerns of the individuals and societies which produce it. What is remembered, and, where possible, recorded is what is felt to be of enduring importance. Because of this, we continue rewriting history — not because new facts come to light (though they often do) but because we have learned to understand them in new ways. A general work of synthesis is the visible apex of a pyramid, based sometimes on original research, but more often on specialised studies written by others. These rest in their turn on many different kinds of evidence. ‘African history’ is a shorthand for many very different specialisations. The historian of medieval Ethiopia works from manuscripts in Ge’ez — which few non-Ethiopians read — and only Egyptologists (who do not consider themselves historians of Africa) can understand the original records of ancient Egypt. The histonan of Benin (the Edo\n\nkingdom,\n\nnot the modern\n\nnation)\n\nstudied\n\nrecords\n\nin Portuguese,\n\nItalian,\n\nFrench and Dutch, as well as English.* There is a vast body of material on the African past in Arabic, much of it written by Africans, and also a corpus of work in African languages, such as Fulfulde, Hausa and Swahili, transcribed in Arabic script.” A history written in Arabic by a scholar of Timbuktu in c. 1665 is called Kitab al Fettash, The Book of the Seeker; it would in many ways be appropriate for the present volume. Language skills are only part of the expertise required of the historian of Africa; some studies have led their authors into subjects as arcane as the properties of copper oxides and sulphates, or the different ‘races’ of sorghum. Historians of Africa are perhaps unique in their readiness to absorb the findings of other disciplines — archaeology, linguistics, human palaeontology, botany, animal genetics, and geology — the list is far from complete. In European sources, we perceive the African past through a glass, darkly. Its authors rarely spoke the languages of the peoples they described (this is also true of many modern academics) and they have always, inevitably, seen Africa through the ‘I-glasses’* of their own culture. A nineteenth-century English visitor sketched the bronze pectoral mask which forms part of the regalia of the king of Igala, in central Nigeria. He called it ‘not unlike ‘‘the man in the moon’’’ and\n\n8\n\nContinental perspectives\n\ndrew it accordingly.” Because this sculpture still survives, we know his drawing 1s a travesty. But what if the original did not survive? Some of the source material in European\n\nlanguages\n\nwas\n\nwritten\n\nby Africans;\n\nmuch\n\nof this, but not all, dates\n\nfrom the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The autobiography of the Igbo, Olaudah Equiano (1745-97), is a justly celebrated example. He fell victim to the Auantic slave trade as a child, but won his freedom and settled in England. Narratives from within, of course, are not immune from their own distortions. His account contains a number of literary echoes; his childhood home cannot be\n\nidentified and its inconsistencies suggest it is a palimpsest of his own memories and those of other Igbo victims of the slave trade.° Oral literature\n\nThere is a sense in which African studies are somewhat marginal, in universities outside Africa. And yet it has been claimed that African historians have been at the cutting edge of research methodology; those who suggest this are thinking, above all, of oral history.’ The collection and analysis of oral literature — not only material of an overtly historical character — is of crucial importance in the study of the African past. Many African societies kept no written records, and because the spoken word is more difficult to preserve than the written one, oral traditions are rigorously selected. What is omitted is as revealing as what is preserved, and traditions sometimes speak most eloquently through their silences. Certain patterns tend to recur. Traditions of origin are preserved as the founding charter of a state’s identity. They are often symbolically rather than literally true; their interpretation tends to be obscure and disputed. The Mbundu of Angola have at least three different traditions of origin, and the Kuba of Zaire have no less than seven alternative creation myths. The question we must ask is not ‘Which is true?’ but ‘What kind of truth do these embody?’ In kingdoms, traditions often have a court bias, the justification of a dynasty’s right to rule. This often means that facts which run counter to this claim are elided or reinterpreted — a successful usurper becomes a younger son. Whole historical epochs were personalised, and their innovations attributed to a culture hero who is often a king. Shyaam, magician and first king, 1s such a figure among the Kuba. In the colonial period, traditions were often changed or even invented, to support one or the other claimant to political office, and the process continues. e spread of western education has led to the publication of oral histories, a task pioneered by western-educated Africans in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. This has preserved information which might otherwise have been lost, but books of this kind — Johnson’s history of the (Oyo) Yoruba, Egharevba on Benin - tend to become an Authorised Version, making the collection of alternative traditions impossible. For, in only too common a paradox, informants trust the printed word rather than the continuation of that oral tradition on which the book was based in the first place. Historians have tended to concentrate on centralised kingdoms rather than on peoples\n\nwho\n\nlived\n\nreasons for this\n\nin small\n\nautonomous\n\nvillages.\n\nThere\n\nare\n\nobvious\n\npractical\n\nitis much easier to write a history ofa unified state than of, for\n\ninstance, the 2,240 village groups\n\nof the castern Igbo!\n\nBut sometumes\n\nthey have\n\nPrelude: Africa and the historians\n\n9\n\nimplied that centralised kingdoms were 1n some way more advanced than miniature polities — though those who think so would not consider Zaire more developed than Monaco.® Historical research tends to focus on large states and major ethnic groups, and the study of small peoples, such as the Yako or Rukuba. is generally left to the anthropologist.” The History of West Africa to 1800, edited by Ajayi and Crowder, is a justly celebrated work which has been through three editions, in each of which chapters\n\nfelt to be out of date have been replaced. But the chapter on ‘stateless societies’, written by an anthropologist, continues to appear in it — and to be very widely cited — though the approach is ethnographic rather than historic, and it concludes with a discussion of the growth of states. Great States re-emerge, even in a chapter devoted supposedly to the so-called ‘stateless’ polities.‘° And sadly, papers which set out to make a case for the study of small-scale states sometimes ignore the growing corpus of work in this field, in a most determined fashion.’? Oral] history has often been unconsciously elitist, because it has been collected from\n\nprofessionals,\n\nsuch\n\nas\n\ngriots,\n\nwho\n\nlooked\n\nto\n\na court\n\npatron.\n\nA\n\nrecent\n\nvaluable paper pointed out that a kingdom consisted of a number of social groups, each with its own oral history. The kingdom of Jaara, in modern Mali, was overthrown by al-Hayj Umar in 1862. Almost half the people in the region where it was located are of slave descent, and women of slave ancestry are the custodians of their oral tradition. It is a profound irony that those who were abruptly cut off from their history by enslavement join the custodians of the history of the captor society.'* There is a further paradox: the African scholar who drew attention to these traditions does not, as a male, have access to them. Oral tradition proper refers to testimonies which have been passed down, as distinct from reminiscence. But the latter is a precious source for the history of our own times, recording voices which are otherwise silenced. Historians who collect oral traditions must also do archival research, but the reverse 1s not always true. Archival research and fieldwork require different skills and, to some extent, different temperaments.\n\nArchival research is solitary; some\n\nof its most gifted practitioners feel ill at ease with the constant encounters with strangers which oral history requires. Whatever the reason, an otherwise excellent book such as Freund’s Capital and Labour in the Nigerian Tin Mines (1981) is marred by his inexplicable failure to interview living tin miners. Some historians obtain a comparable insight into individual experience by studying sources such as the popular press — but only a tiny minority of the African population was literate. Popular songs, folk tales and proverbs speak from the heart; they are a valuable source for cognitive history — the problem is that they are often undatable. African historians collecting oral history among thet’ own people have great advantages in fieldwork, especially in their command of the appropriate language. They may well not have the language skills or opportunity for research in widely scattered European archives. For most European historians, a facility in different European languages is more readily acquired than competence in a tonal and perhaps little-studied African language. This became evident to me in my years in Africa, in the course of innumerable encounters with historians from\n\nabroad grappling with what was then the obligatory rite de passage of fieldwork.!?\n\nIO\n\nContinental perspectives\n\nIn the case of some historians, this was a brief sojourn in the field, using interpreters, providing what was essentially a cosmetic veneer for a history in fact based on archival materials.'* I made attempts to bridge this gap, first in Igbo Worlds, an anthology of both oral and archival sources, and later in the series Jos\n\nOral History and Literature Texts.!°\n\nSome excellent works published in recent years have been based on archival\n\nsources alone. The author of one of them suggests an informal division of labour, European historians concentrating on the archives and African historians on fieldwork.'° Scholars are coming to realise that the polarity between written and oral sources is itself an artificial one. The European authors of published and unpublished accounts of African history or ethnography relied on local informants, whose words are the submerged subtexts of their narratives.”\n\nHistory and anthropology Both oral historians and anthropologists do fieldwork in Africa, and the relationship between the two is a complex and changing one. In the past, historians were often critical of anthropological writing which was frequently — but not invariably — located in a timeless and imaginary ethnographic present. But anthropologists came much closer than historians to an understanding of African societies in their total complexity, studying variables such as kinship, ritual and culture. The divorce between the two was due less perhaps to doctrinaire considerations than to the impossibility of doing justice simultaneously to both structure and process. Meanwhile, anthropologists have become increasingly sensitive to the variable of historical change. Some of the finest studies of the African past are the work of anthropologists — Peel’s history of Ilesa, Horton’s accounts of cognitive change among the Kalabari, Janzen’s study of Lemba.’® Historical writing has become richer and more densely textured, concerned with ecological factors including climate, famine and disease, religion and kinship. Anthropological analysis has undergone an intensive rethinking from within; much of this has been the work of African specialists, such as Fabian.’? Hard questions have been asked about fieldwork and it is realised that much anthropological enquiry has been formulaic — a classic instance of an invenuen of Africa. Vansina points out, with characteristic insight, the remarkable degree of similarity in the vast corpus of published and unpublished ethnographic wnung on the Zaire basin. This undoubtedly reflects stereotyping in the questions asked.7° Functionalists and structuralists\n\nDifferent schools of anthropology have mounted significant challenges to the methodology of the oral historian. The first form this took was functionalist ~ ora] traditions were interpreted as a ‘mythical charter’ for present social realities. They often ummdoubtedly do do work in this way, but this does not, in itself, invalidate them as a record of past events. Claude Lévi-Strauss is the founding father of structuralist _anthropology, a school which was, for a time, immensely influential. He interpreted oral traditions not as more or less accurate mirrors of\n\nPrelude: Africa and the historians past events but as stateme\n\nThe mind, he Ce\n\nich\n\nII\n\nembody a different kind of symbolic truth.\n\neee Unive ealy TD perteive-reanty ik Teme of paived\n\nopposites — such as Nature and Culture (symbolically expressed as the Raw and\n\nthe\n\nCooked,\n\nthe\n\ntitle of one\n\nof his most\n\nfamous\n\nbooks),\n\nor Life\n\nand\n\nDeath.\n\nLegends which apparently tell of the foundation of states, for instance, are really essays in cosmic speculation, and belong rather to the history of ideas (which is not in itself to diminish them -— rather the reverse). Lévi-Strauss worked on Native American mythologies; his ideas were applied to central Africa in an enormously influenual study by the Belgian anthropologist Luc de Heusch (see p. 112 below). Some historians of Africa, notably Christopher Wrigley, absorbed the structuralist viewpoint to a degree which cast doubt on the literal veracity of virtually all historical traditions.”! J. B. Webster and his collaborators were at the other end of the ideological spectrum, extrapolating the reigns of precisely dated kings far into the past, in a way most of their colleagues found unconvincing.” Some historians are moving towards a more sophisticated synthesis in response\n\nto structuralism, where traditions are seen as neither entirely symbolic ror\n\nwholly true,-but rather as a composite of myth and real event.7> To disentangle the two is a task requiring great skill and subtlety. It was once assumed that oral traditions comprise a core of truth and a penumbra of myth. But it has been suggested that the core is a cliché, and the accretions mirror real events. But of course the symbols and clichés are also ‘real’, mirroring landscapes of the mind. Historians’ increasing agnosticism about the literal truth of the traditions they collect is mirrored in a recent dictum by the scholar who pioneered the critical use of oral testimonies: ‘For the most part [traditions of érigin] represent cosmological speculation.’** These clichés, or recurrent core symbols, pose many problems of interpretation. Sometimes they are clearly part of a single farflung complex: the myth of the immigrant hunter-king found throughout Africa’s southern savannas is an example. But essentially the same myth is found far away, among various peoples in Nigeria. Woot, the Kuba culture hero, is a Drunken King, insulted by his sons, defended by his daughter. His wife discovers salt when she is a fugitive. Does this story embody echoes of missionary stories which gradually penetrated the Zaire basin from the Atlantic coast or are such stories the great archetypes of the mind which Jungian analysis attributes to the collective unconscious? Historians are increasingly conscious of the way in which oral traditions are shaped both by the way in which human memory operates and by the fact that\n\nthey are always related for an audience. The tendency for the concrete rather\n\nthan the abstract to be remembered contributes to the crystallising of events and processes as cliches. Feedback from an audience helps make the testimony a collective product. The basic tool of historical research is the quest for independent confirmation from different sources. This is a complex task, for sources are often not truly independent.\n\nThe\n\nking\n\nlists\n\nof\n\nBunyoro\n\nand\n\nBuganda,\n\nin\n\nUganda,\n\nlargely\n\nconfirm each other; a chronology based on them, and other evidence, was hailed as a tnumphant step towards locating the African past in a firm temporal context. Later critiques showed first that the Bunyoro list was not truly independent, but\n\nI2\n\nContinental perspectives\n\nwas consciously constructed to fit the Buganda data — which itself has come under increasingly critical scrutiny.2? More profoundly, it has been suggested that the very making of lists is the product of a literate culture.”° The distortion in the Buganda and Bunyoro king lists seems to be that of lengthening. But the limitations of human memory more commonly result in the telescoping of history. The process of settling in an area and the formation of large political units are entirely distinct phenomena, and the former is undoubtedly in most cases far more ancient. But even remembering this caveat, it is clear that the available evidence leads us to place the origins of many states far too late, and events which really belong to the Early Iron Age are transposed to the fifteenth or sixteenth centuries or even later. This is true of the interlacustrine kingdoms, and of much of Central Africa. It is also demonstrably true of some West African polities. All available evidence suggests that the Igbo have lived in much their present homes since the dawn of human history. But a dense network of mutually consistent family genealogies places the formation of many settlements in the\n\nsixteenth or seventeenth centuries.7’ Where\n\nwritten\n\nsources\n\nextend\n\nfar\n\ninto\n\nthe\n\npast,\n\nthey\n\nprovide\n\na precious\n\nresource against which oral testimonies can be checked. Where they are lacking, until the nineteenth or even twentieth century, historians tend to rely on linguistic and ethnographic data, as well as a sensitive awareness of the dynamics of the traditions themselves. Where written evidence exists, it sometimes suggests\n\nthat oral testimonies have a truly astonishing reliability.7®\n\nIt has been suggested that both oral histories and traditional written chronicles focus on political events to the neglect of socio-economic change.” Vansina says of the Kuba, in words which are applicable to many other societies as well, ‘For the most part, political events dealing with succession, war, law, administration, and the royal personality were remembered.”*” Yet they do, in fact, preserve much socio-economic data, and these data are particularly valuable because they are not the primary focus. At the present time, the interpretation of oral tradition is at least as individualistic as art criticism. A highly reparded and sophisticated study of the Mbundu of Angola and their neighbours suggests that the people mentioned in historical traditions represent titles in the possession of particular lineages.?’ There is evidence to support it, but it cannot be conclusively proved,\n\nand the postulate is the basis on which the whole book rests. The scholarly community tends to see the oral traditions of any given people through the eyes of its specialists — literally for much of Nigeria (but not Igala), symbolically in Central Africa. Despite these caveats, oral history is often both remarkably accurate and strikingly truthful. Buganda, at the apogee of its power and influence, preserved\n\ntraditions, both of its humble origins and of defeats at the hands of Bunyoro. Africa’s historians\n\nWe have seen how both the wnitten and oral sources for African history are shaped by the conscious or unconscious aims of their authors. This 1s, of course, equally truc of modern historians. Nothing shows the way in which historical and\n\nethnographic literature is shaped by one’s preconceptions more clearly than the\n\nPrelude: Africa and the historians\n\n13\n\nhistory and ethnography produced during the colonial period. Its authors were naturally preconditioned to be aware of the creative role of white invaders from the north. It was initially assumed that the stone structures of ruined Great Zimbabwe were the work of Phoenicians or built for the Queen of Sheba. Cecil Rhodes welcomed the theory of its exotic origins as it offered a positive precedent for intruders from afar.’ Frobenius saw the corpus of Ife sculpture, the relics of its glass industry, as proof that it was the site of an ancient colony of Etruscans, the reality underlying Atlantis. Colonial ethnographers saw traces of Egyptian influence everywhere, bolstering their theories with amateur etymology.** The belief that sacred kingship and iron smelting diffused into black Africa from Egypt and Meroe respectively was to have a long history, surviving well into the period of modern scholarship. There were other versions of the so-called Hamitic hypothesis,*? which attributed the foundation of states in the Western Sudan to a Berber or Arab héros civilisateur.°° Sadly, some African writers welcomed such theories — sadly, because they had internalised the assumption that Egyptian civilisation was superior to that of black Africa.?’ European writers tended to glorify the achievement of ancient Egypt, while they marginalised not only black Africa but also the Maghrib, which a French author called ‘one of those rare Mediterranean countries which made no original contribution to civilisation’.*® We should not, of course, dismiss the work of colonial ethnographers. The writings of colonial officials such as R. S. Rattray or C. K. Meek contain much of enduring value, and it is a sign of a maturing discipline that historians of Africa are increasingly willing to acknowledge this. A natural reaction against the Hamitic hypothesis led a generation of scholars to emphasise the indigenous roots of everything. Now they are more open to an understanding of black Africa’s many linkages with the ecumene. Jan Vansina says — in this case, probably wrongly — of a distinctive theme in Nupe, Benin and Yoruba art, “The whole motif derives from the Hellenistic Mediterranean.’?” It is no coincidence that the study of African history took shape as a serious field of academic endeavour at the tme when many African states gained their independence. Both African and expatriate historians shared in the hopes those years engendered. Those historians who chose African history as a research\n\nfield*° did so out of a generous sympathy for African aspirations.\n\nThe dominant impulse in the 1960s — which I shared — was to prove that black Africa had a history at all, a history as worthy of study as any other. This was a salutary reaction to a historiography which saw Africans as the passive backdrop to the deeds of white proconsuls and missionaries. Not only the ignorant believed that black Africa had no history worthy of study: it was an Oxford historian justly\n\nfamed for his scholarship who described the discipline as the study of the unrewarding gyrations of barbarous tribes,*’ thus drawing on his head the obloquy of a generation of Africanists. Max Weber, one of the founding fathers of sociology, had made much the same point earlier; he was ‘indignant that the history of the Bantus could be studied as much as that of the Greeks’.** The great art critic Roger Fry, admiring African sculpture, reflected: ‘It is curious that a people who produced such great artists did not produce also a culture in our sense of the word.”*”\n\n14\n\nContinental perspectives Historians\n\nwhich\n\nit was\n\nof Africa were critical of colonialism, imposed,\n\nits often unconscious\n\nracism,\n\nstressing the violence with its zmmobilisme.\n\nThey\n\nlaid\n\ngreat stress on resistance to its imposition, which was seen, both by scholars and by African politicians, as a prelude to the triumphs of political nationalism.** The first generation of politicians in independent Tanzania were the conscious heirs of Maji Mayi, the great anti-German uprising in the early years of this century. Historians focussed primarily on political and economic history, studying great states partly to show that Africans were capable of creating and maintaining them. They wrote about long-distance trade, successful entrepreneurs, the rationality of African\n\neconomic\n\nchoices, in a conscious\n\ncorrective to\n\nstereotypes of African inertia and backwardness.*? For similar reasons, they devoted considerable attention to indigenous forms of literacy. By the late 1970s, something of a crisis had developed in African historical writing.*° The optimism which had heralded African independence became increasingly difficult to sustain. Civil wars, military coups, a cycle of impoverishment and indebtedness and recurrent famines, had a traumatic impact on a discipline which had been shaped by the exigencies of the present. Many historians — myself among them -— interpreted these various afflictions as the (presumably temporary) consequences of particular historical circumstances. Thus political instability could be explained in terms of colonialism’s divisive and artificial boundaries, and ethnic conflicts through its invention of ethnicity (pp. 97, 106, 123 below). The historiography of the 1960s and early 1970s had undoubted weaknesses, including a reluctance to confront the deficiencies of African societies, past and present. However well-intentioned, this produced many imbalances of historical judgement. We have noted one example — the tendency to regard state formation, whatever the cost, as a Good Thing. Nowhere was this more glaring than in studies of the transatlantic slave trade, where the desire to depict the African as homo economicus rather than as victim or comprador led to an undoubted tendency to minimise its evils, and stress its positive by-products.*’ Shaka and the marauding captains of the Mfecane were depicted as creative state founders, with minimal emphasis on the enormous misery and loss of life for which they were responsible.*® There was a tendency to ignore the exploitative aspects of pre-colonial states, and to idealise the traditional rulers who led resistance to colonialism, assuming that their interests were identical to those of the ruled. There was a marked tendency to eulogise African entrepreneurs of all varieties; gradually, the shortcomings of at least some of them became evident, and ‘kleptocracy’ became part of the vocabulary of academic discourse. Reductionism was a weakness as fundamental as elitism. The initial focus of Africanist history was political; within this, it tended towards the analysis of Great States, and, in the words of a seventeenth-century visitor to West Africa, to the study of ‘Kings, rich men, and prime merchants, exclusive of the inferior sort of Blacks’.”” Peoples organised in small-scale states tended to be overlooked; here my own work, first on the Igbo and later on the Jos plateau, was a corrective.” The Africanists of the 1960s and 1970s were attempting to demolish the mistaken stereotypes on which racism rests. hey were also, in a sense, engaged\n\nPrelude: Africa and the historians\n\n15\n\nin a conversation which may have been the wrong one to choose. In a partly unconscious endeavour to prove to critics like Trevor-Roper that Africa indeed had a history, they cast their own work in a quasi-European framework. Wilks’ vast study of nineteenth-century Asante is a classic example. He was reacting against stereotypes, in early European accounts, which depicted Asante as bloodthirsty and barbaric. He constantly uses words such as bureaucratisation, and the less acceptable face of Asante life — human sacrifice — is interpreted as judicial execution.?! The work is meticulously documented and researched; it has been criticised’* on the grounds that by assimilating Asante life to western models, it diminishes and impoverishes it. Looking back on my own ‘Africanist’ years, I can see that I too was involved in a perpetual dialogue, both with the biases implicit in my sources and with the assumptions of other historians of Africa, who tended to define the African past in terms of Great States. I began The Ibo People and the Europeans with a quotation from Margery Perham: ‘the groups of the south-east have no history before the coming of the Europeans’.?? I felt that I needed to prove that the study of Igbo history itself was a valid enterprise. It seems to me now that this essentially defensive attitude was unnecessarily restricting. The largest single cluster of African historians in the 1960s and 1970s was associated in various ways with the University of Ibadan. All were agreed in denouncing the shortcomings of missionaries and colonial governments. But there were considerable areas of ambiguity. Ajaye and Ayandele wrote books covering a quite similar area, concentrating on Nigeria’s early educated Christians, the predecessors and in many cases the ancestors of the nation’s later elite.°* But in a later study, Ayandele denounced them furiously; significantly, it was not for any shortcomings in their social vision, but for their cultural ambiguity, their distance from their African roots.?? Traditional rulers were sometimes idealised for their opposition to colonialism, sometimes, in a proliferation of studies of Indirect Rule, critiqued for their opposition to the modernisers. To a striking extent, the Ibadan school focussed either on resistance to colonial conquest or on aspects of government; many Nigerian historians came to take an active role in government, often as state commissioners in military regimes. Surprisingly little attention was paid to social history.?°\n\nThe Marxist perspective\n\n~~\"\n\nThe most sustained and trenchant attack on ‘Africanist’ historiography came from Marxists (who often called themselves neo-Marxist, materialist or radical). At their most doctrinaire, they compressed all other historical writing about Africa into a single school, variously termed liberal, bourgeois, nationalist, historicist or Africanist. How sad and inexplicable it would once have seemed that ‘Africanist? should become a term of condemnation, or empiricism be rejected as ‘nihilism’.?’\n\n‘Liberal’ historians of Africa (to use the least pejorative term) do not form and have never formed a single united school. They have often been, very properly, enthusiastically at variance with each other. We have noted Wrigley’s critique of\n\n16\n\nContinental perspectives\n\nFage; one might equally well note a myriad other controversies, including a famous exchange about the so-called Dar es Salaam school.?°® Materialist historians, of course, do not form a united school either and beyond the core of those who consider themselves Marxists or neo-Marxists there is a large circle of scholarship, bearing the clear imprint of Marxist insights — as, indeed, the present work does. Iliffe’s study, The Emergence of African Capitalism, takes Marx as its starting point.°? Marxist writing on Africa has sometimes been barren and doctrinaire; there was once a sterile quest to accommodate\n\nAfrican\n\nhistory to the writings\n\nof the Master,\n\nwhose\n\nreflections\n\nwere based on the experiences of industrial Europe. This led to unpromising lines of enquiry: in the 1960s there was much unprofitable debate concerning whether the African experience was an example of Marx’s Asiatic mode of production. In 1972, the French Marxist Coquery-Vidrovich made an interesting attempt to define an African mode of production in terms of the way in which rulers reaped a profit from long-distance trade. This was widely criticised, not least because it emphasised exchange rather than production.©° The rejection of experience in favour of dogma, somewhat in the style of a medieval theologian, is not entirely dead. In words which became, perhaps, for the historians of the 1980s what Trevor-Roper’s sentiments on barbarian tribes were for their predecessors, two Marxists wrote: ‘We reject the notion of history as a coherent and worthwhile object for study.’°! This approach, especially associated with the French Marxist Althusser, provoked in one of Britain’s most celebrated Marxist historians a furiously indignant polemic.°* The forms which the rejection of experience can take are many and strange. A writer on the medical history of Tanzania is an example. ‘In a Marxist construction of social reality ... only human agency js causal ... If only human action has causal efficacy, then germs cannot be said to cause disease.’ And yet Marxist insights have inspired some of the most perceptive writing on the African past. A group of French Marxist anthropologists working in West Africa, and especially Claude Meillassoux, have had a great impact on African historical writing. Meillassoux made a plea for a more complex and nuanced study of modes of production, reacting against the (western) stereotypes of\n\nclassical economics.°* He focusses on what has been called the polities of\n\nreproduction, and in particular on the conflict between village elders and youths over the control of resources in general and wives in particular. Marxist and feminist analysis has shed much light on the division of labour by gender, and created a new awareness of women’s role in production. Some have criticised Meillassoux on the grounds that the polarities he describes are not peculiar to Africa. This does not in itself invalidate his insights. Inevitably, he stresses structure rather than process; in a sense he extrapolates the experience of a few West African societies into a generally applicable model.®’ But he has had a transforming effect on historical writing — nowhere more than in South Africa, where,\n\nbecause\n\nof both\n\nits\n\nindustrialisation\n\nand\n\nits\n\nclass\n\nstructure,\n\nMarxist\n\nconcepts are most readily applied. Marxist history has led to a more holistic approach to the African past, a greater awareness of matcrial culture. It is a great strength of ‘mode of producuon’\n\ntheory that it Concentrates\n\nattention\n\nboth\n\non the actual process\n\nof wealth\n\nPrelude: Africa and the historians\n\n17\n\ncreation and on its distribution in society.®° It is a weakness that the application of the theory over vast areas may lead us to underestimate their differences, the particularities of local historical experience. Different scholars define and locate modes of production somewhat differently. A widely accepted sequence runs as follows: lineage mode of production, tributary mode of production, slave mode of production, merchant and then industrial capitalism. It tends to impose a false sense of a linear and inevitable development. It is by no means always self-evident who is, and who is not, a Marxist — and it should be noted that marxisant is not a term of approval. (I was startled but not displeased, years ago, when a reviewer called me a disciple of Frantz Fanon, something of which I was hitherto unaware!) Wilks described his history of Asante as Marxist. Terray, whose Marxist credenuals are indisputable, endorses Wilks’ Marxist approach, but a critic pointed out that Marxism first appears on page 700!°” Even Coquery-Vidrovitch, a central figure in French Marxist writing on Africa, refers to her own intellectual preferences as ‘supposedly Marxist’.©® Klein says of himself, in words many historians of Africa would echo: ‘my Marxism\n\nis rather diluted. I have difficulty accepting the labour theory of value\n\nand find it impossible to reduce all history to class struggle. Nevertheless, I find that the concept of a mode of production is a very powerful tool for historical analysis.’°? Another historian endearingly compared his own studies of French Marxist literature with the adventures of Winnie the Pooh in pursuit of a Woozle!’° A mode of production has two parts: the forces of production (ecology, labour, technology, raw materials) and the relations of production (the extraction and distribution of a surplus). Clarence-Smith suggests some detailed questions: Who controlled (not owned) the means of production and how? If... a restricted group, what right of access did the majority of the population have, and in return for\n\nwhat kinds of payment? Was the extracted surplus redistributed, or was it wholly, or partially retained by the restricted group? If it was retained, how was it realised, in economic investment, letsure activities, conspicuous consumption, or the maintenance of repressive political and ideological apparatuses? ... Did the dominant group interfere directly in the process of production?”!\n\nAn awareness of the changing relations of production informs some of the best writing on archaeology.’ It shapes some outstanding historical monographs: Kea’s densely textured work on the seventeenth-century Gold Coast is enormously richer than its ‘Trade and Politics’ predecessors.’* The difficulty is that the study of a large number of variables tends to obscure the chronology of events. It is a central problem in multidimensional history. And the model, while shedding light on reality, should not be confused with reality itself. ‘Modes of production do not exist.’’* Some exponents of Marxism have written as if the world of culture and ideas was simply the reflection of the material base. There are, of course, passages in Marx which say just this: ‘The mode of production of material life conditions the social, political and intellectual life process in general. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that\n\ndetermines\n\ntheir consciousness.’’>\n\nMarx,\n\nhowever,\n\ndid say that he was\n\nnot a\n\n18\n\nContinental perspectives\n\nMarxist!’° One of the most important differences between palaeo — and neoMarxists is the latter’s increasingly sophisticated awareness of the autonomy of cognitive history.’’\n\nDependency theory There is a fundamental division in radical thought about the merits of dependency theory.’® It draws its inspiration from the writings of André Gunder Frank, who was concerned with ‘the development of underdevelopment’ in Latin America. Frank regarded the impoverishment of the Third World as an ongoing process, the result of the exploitation of the metropolitan countries. The late Walter Rodney and Samir Amin were influential proponents of this viewpoint in the African context. The title of the former’s most widely read book, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, still worth reading for all its polemicism and oversimplifications, encapsulates the theory.”” Orthodox Marxists are critical of dependency theory on several grounds: that it emphasises trade rather than production, and that it negates Marx’s emphasis\n\non the positive aspects of capitalism. They also point out that it tends to replace class with regional conflict. I was greatly influenced by dependency theory when I worked on the impact of the Atlantic slave trade on the Igbo, since it seemed to cast much light on this encounter. Dependency theory critiques the comprador, the local collaborator who makes external exploitation possible, whether the king who sells slaves, or the modern politician or military ruler who enriches himself by collaboration with the big multinationals. But dependency theory has its limitations. It reduces\n\nAfricans to the helpless victims international of market forces and sheds ‘no no light\n\non_the Tong peroas oF fime when _external hternational capitalism\n\nexploitationwas unimportant.\n\nhad no Impact at all on the Anaguta of Jos plateau in\n\ncentral Nigeria until the early twentieth century. As late as the 1950s, its impact was \\nsignificant, in part through the conscious choices of the Anaguta themselves *°f Dependency theory ignores the enormous differences between the different peoples who experienced the impact of international economic forces and responded to them in one of a wide variety of ways. It is profoundly pessimistic about their capacity to transform their own lives. Perhaps, in its own way, it is just as Eurocentric as the Hamitic hypothesis. The basic inspiration of both Marxists and dependency theorists is concern for the poor. But this has, increasingly, become a central preoccupation of African historical writing in general. It derives, in part, from a tradition of ‘history from below’®! in English scholarship. Often specific insights from historical research elsewhere\n\nhave\n\nfed\n\ninto African\n\nstudies;\n\nHobsbawm\n\nwrote\n\na famous\n\nbook\n\non\n\nbandits, and in due course, a collection of essays on banditry in Afnica appeared.*?

I pointed out long ago that a belief in the verbal inspiration of sacred texts, intolerance of alternative views and conviction of one’s own infallibility have long since been unacceptable in theology. Should it be otherwise in African history?®*? But having said this, it is important to acknowledge that some of the most original writing in African history is the result of materialist insights, and its influence is writ large on the pages which follow. All research is in some sense ideological; facts neither select nor explain themselves. What is important, is that theory should illumine historical research, and never replace it. Goethe said, ‘Grey is every theory, and green and gold is the tree of life.’\n\nAlternative models: Braudel and Ia longue durée Fernand Braudel, who died in 1985, was one of Europe’s most celebrated historians. His masterpiece was his two-volume study of the Mediterranean in the age of Philip 11,94 a work of great erudition, full of finely observed social detail — the walnut trees which shade villages in the High Atlas, fuel shortages in Cairo. It was immensely influential, not least as an example of history in the round.\n\nBraudel was impatient with sociologists, feeling that they paid too little attention to social change.®° But he was also critical of ‘the history of events: surface disturbances, crests of foam ... surface manifestations of these large\n\nmovements and explicable only in terms of them’.®° He He stressed the importance\n\nof social eae En occurring over centuries — la longue d durée. The expression threads 1 ough his writings, and is echoed in much historical literature. which appears “to owe little else to his work. It has become part of the baggage of historical writing. There has been a reaction; some notable modern scholars have\n\nwritten in defence of narrative history.°’ Dates and ‘events’ are necessary points of reference in an otherwise unnavigable sea — and it is notable that part of Braudel’s great work was in fact concerned with ‘events’. Braudel paid much attention to the physical environment; scholarship has moved beyond his rather simplistic and static geographical determinism. His book is full of pictures of Mediterranean ships but he does not reflect on the consequences of the timber cut to build them.®® Braudel’s impact on African studies has been limited.®? This is partly because he began his research in 1923, and published the first edition of The Mediterranean in 1946, relying, therefore, for his North African material on French\n\nethnographers writing in the inter-war period whose work has long since been overtaken by more recent scholarship. Not surprisingly, his influence has been greatest on those working in related fields, that is, on historians of the Maghrib.”°\n\nLandscapes In The Ibo People and the Europeans, published over twenty years ago, I wrote of ‘a people in a landscape’, a theme to which I reverted in my History of Nigeria. This emphasis grew, not from Braudel, whom I had not at the time read, but\n\n20\n\nContinental perspectives\n\nfrom the experience of living successively in very different African environments. The importance of ecology is one of the key insights of contemporary writing on Africa. Book titles and subtitles reflect this — The Ecology of Survival?! or The Historical Anthropology of an African Landscape.?* It grows out of the too evident impact of a deteriorating environment on contemporary human lives. A treatise al-Maghili wrote in the late fifteenth century for the benefit of a king of Kano has a curiously contemporary resonance: ‘Cherish the land from the spoiling drought, from the raging wind, the dust-laden storm ... and the beating rain.’??\n\nSometimes a failure to locate historical writing firmly in a changing landscape reflects an inadequate familiarity with it; southern Nigeria is often described in books and atlases as located in a belt of ‘rainforest’; there 1s indeed a substantial\n\narea of which this is true — the Benin forest — but most of southern Nigeria has been transformed for many generations by human industry. It was said of Yorubaland, in 1891: ‘Far and wide, the land has for generations, and indeed for\n\ncenturies, been cultivated by these industrious natives. The hatchet, the fire and the hoe have removed all traces of the original forest.’”* Famine\n\nand\n\ndisease,\n\nfor obvious\n\nreasons,\n\nloom\n\nlarge\n\nin modern\n\nhistorical\n\nwriting. Ford’s pioneering study of the impact of tsetse fly, published in 1971, was a precursor.”” Alternative models: the frontier\n\nInteresting attempts have been made to adapt Jackson’s concept of the frontier,\n\nwhich has been so seminal in American historical writing.°° In an African\n\ncontext, this becomes less a tide sweeping across a continent than an infinite series of internal frontiers, a recurrent pattern of pioneer settlers who then become ‘owners of the land’ in relation to later immigrants. Often this movement is essentially conservative — the migrants endeavour to recreate the social structures of the society they have left, but with a more favourable position within it. Like the white settlers of America, the frontierspeople very often moved into areas which were already inhabited. One strength of this approach is that it moves beyond the invention of watertight and monolithic ‘tribes’ and finds room for the — often multlingual — people of the borderlands. An alternative, independent form of the model focusses on the Islamic frontier.?’\n\nThe problem of gender Half Africa’s people are women. They are responsible for virtually all food preparation and child rearing, and often play a dominant role in agriculture. Crafts are gender-specific, and in many areas women control trade (specific commodities are often sold only by men or only by women). But in much historical\n\nwriting\n\nwomen\n\nare\n\ninvisible,\n\nexcept\n\nfor\n\nthe\n\nrare,\n\nand\n\nsometimes\n\nlegendary, queen. This is equally true of some of my own earlier work. I felt alienated from the feminist writing of the 1960s and early 1970s because of its white middle-class character limitations which mainstream western feminism has long since recognised and reacted against.\n\nI felt that it was self-indulgent to\n\nPrelude: Africa and the historians\n\n21\n\nagitate about matters such as inclusive language in liturgy when millions were threatened by famine. Partly because of the admiration I felt for the vitality and achievements of the Nigerian professional and market women with whom I was in daily contact, I did not sufficiently recognise the way in which colonialism eroded the position of women, or the fact that they are often the poorest of the poor. Women’s invisibility in academic writing in the colonial period and later did much to cause their neglect in many development projects, which too often left women both poorer and more burdened than before. This distortion was recognised and in part corrected, largely through the writings of feminist scholars. Feminist, like radical, scholarship has fed important insights into Africa studies as a whole, inspiring, for instance, some notable studies of the history of the family. But studies of women and the family have often been compartmentalised — books and papers are either totally concerned with women, or not at all. There is an increasing awareness of gender in work which is not specifically feminist. The anthropologist van Binsbergen studied the Nkoya, a Zambia people\n\nalso known\n\nas the Mbelwa,\n\nand while\n\ndoing\n\nso translated\n\na traditional\n\nhistory by a local pastor, assuming that rulers whose gender was unstated were male. It ws only when he was asked to contribute to a conference on the Position of Women in the Early State that he read the text with new eyes, and came to understand it as describing a transition, from ‘a peaceful stateless situation when\n\n. women were politically and ritually dominant to male-headed systems in which violence predominated’.”® Conventional histories concentrate on political and economic change, and many fine studies focus exclusively on men in positions of authority, the Captains and the Kings. The balance is not to be redressed by concentrating on the rare historical instances of women in authority, such as Nzinga (p. 399 below), but by directing our attention, as Marxist historians urge us to, to the forces of production. Cultural expression tends to be gender-specific too: men are metal workers, wood carvers or masked dancers; women have their own outlets which vary from culture to culture but may include particular genres of oral art (like the grinding songs of northern Nigeria) or textile design or body painting. These have often been little studied; if they change at all, the process is difficult to document. Much of their communication is non-verbal. Can these unheard voices and unseen symbols find a place in a general study? I grapple with this problem in the pages which follow. Whose\n\ndiscourse?\n\n-\n\nAfrican history has been written either by westerners, or by Africans trained in western traditions. It has been suggested that ‘the study of Africa, more\n\nthan of\n\nany other continent, has been dominated by aliens and their theories’.”” A recent pamphlet by a group of eight church leaders in South Africa, six of whom were women, and most of whom\n\nUntul\n\nnow\n\nall the\n\nresearch\n\nwere illiterate, made the same point.\n\nand\n\nall the\n\nliterature\n\nabout\n\nthe\n\nso-called\n\n‘African\n\nIndependent Churches’ has been the work of outsiders. Anthropologists, sociologists\n\n22\n\nContinental perspectives\n\nand theologians from foreign Churches have been studying us for many years and they have published a whole library of books and articles about us. Each of them has had his or her own motives for studying us. Generally, their motives have been purely academic. We have become a fertile field for the kind of research that will enable a person to write an ‘interesting’ thesis and obtain an academic degree ... It is therefore not surprising that we do not recognise ourselves in their writings. We find them\n\nseriously misleading and often far from the truth. They are full of misunderstandings, misconceptions and falsehood. In trying to understand us outsiders suffer serious handicaps. They have their own frame of reference, the assumptions of anthropology or sociology or a Western theology. We find ourselves judged in terms of these norms. 100\n\nThese words make sobering reading for a historian of Africa. Scholars have become aware that all ethnographic description is, in a very real\n\nsense, an Invention of Africa.'°'\n\nSome\n\npeoples — the British, French\n\nand\n\nDerrida,\n\nand\n\nAmericans among them — conduct ethnographic studies, and others are perpetually studied. Those studied would not recognise themselves in the accounts which are written of them, to which they tend not to have access anyway. The problem is not solved by learning an African language, or entering with great empathy into the world of the Other. We are prisoners of the rationalism taken for granted in the western world. An example makes this clearer. In 1873-4, British forces defeated the Asante. The western historian will explain it in various ways: the disparity in armaments and resources, or various factors which weakened the Asante. Asante tradition has a different explanation: it was caused by the loss of the Asantehene’s war charm in the Pra river.!° The concept of academic history, its diverse subdivisions — political, economic, social, religious — grew up in the western world. Those who study the African past, myself included, are the prisoners of intellectual categories which did not develop in Africa. The alternative is not to invent a system of ‘African thought’ and work within its categories. Such endeavours have been made and found wanting.'?° A facile solution is to place everything in inverted commas - ‘slaves’, ‘Nguni’ — but this becomes little more than a stylistic affectation. Anthropologists of Africa, rather than its historians,'°* have been influenced by thinkers conveniently called postmodernists or poststructuralists. Some of the best known\n\nnames\n\nare those of Foucault,\n\nRicceur and Toulmain,\n\nthe semiotician (and novelist) Eca. They are, in many respects, at variance with each other, but they share certain basic assumptions. A key word 1n their writing is ‘discourse’, by which they mean the total system of language and meaning in a given society, which, unconsciously, shapes our thinking from the cradle to the grave. Foucault regarded it as an instrument of coercion, and in studies of the European past used the approach of the ‘archacologist’ to resurrect forms of discourse which have been forgotten or marginalised.'°” Foucault was oblivious to the Third World: his vision was not only Eurocentric but francophone, but his insights have been applied to other parts of the world in a number of thoughtprovoking studics. Edward Said wrote of ‘orientalism’ as the creation of European thought.!°° Its implications for anthropology were explored in a series\n\nof important books, where specialists in Africa made major contributions. /°”\n\nPrelude: Africa and the historians\n\n23\n\nThe problem is perhaps most acute in the case of symbolism. A symbol, by its very nature, has many dimensions of meaning. What is the relationship between the symbolic universe the scholar analyses in an African people and their own perceptions? The late Victor Turner described the extremely rich symbolic universe he found among the Ndembu. If the Ndembu themselves did not — could not — analyse their own rituals in the same way, does this kind of description truly mirror their own cognitive world? In Mary Douglas’ fine study, Purity and Danger, she states explicitly, with reference to her account of the Lele pangolin cult: “The metaphysical implications have not been expressed to me in so many words by Lele ... No one member of the society 1s necessarily aware of the\n\nwhole\n\npattern.’!°8\n\nIn\n\nother\n\nwords,\n\nshe\n\ndiscerns\n\npatterns\n\nin\n\nthe\n\nLele\n\nexperience which are not apparent to the Lele themselves. We have referred to the increasing readiness of materialist historians to accept the validity of African cognitive maps. An important collection of essays on South African history is subtitled ‘African class formation, culture and conscious-\n\nness’.1°9 A valuable study of a Zionist church in South Africa describes its thought, often expressed in non-verbal ways, as appropriate for its members’ life situation.!!° Religion is often of great importance in African cognitive maps, past and present, though in the holistic universe of the ‘traditional’ way there was no word for religion, and no concept of it as a distinctive mode of being. ‘If a people’s behaviour is in part shaped by their own images and concepts, to the degree that these images and concepts are ignored and alien ones imposed or applied, that behaviour will be misunderstood and faultily explained.”?\"\" An influential book published in 1980 was called The Invention of Culture. It was echoed in the title of a study by a brilliant Zairois scholar, V. Mudimbe, The Invention of Africa.'’* Historians and anthropologists have come to realise that we invent cultures, rather than describing them, that their books are ‘true ficuons’. The anthropologist’s field notes describe one social fact but not another. She attends one ceremony but not another held at the same time — or, of course, those held before her arrival or after her departure. Her informants have their own silences: some are intended, and some reflect the fact that people describe what they think of, what seems important at a particular time. The historian does the same: she takes notes on a tiny fraction of what she reads, selecting those passages which seem significant at that particular tme. Studies have been made of the silences in famous texts: the invisibility of Nuer and Dinka women in Evans-Pritchard’s writing on the Nuer, Lienhardt’s Divinity and\n\nExperience (on the Dinka).'!?\n\nWe have learned to look askance at the academic conventions which once ruled unquestioned. The poststructuralists have not created a new paradigm but have taught us to see the limitations of old ones. They have reminded us of the artificiality of the various academic disciplines into which we divide our interpretation of reality. Neo-Marxists have long symbolised their critique of these divisions by their adoption of the term ‘political economy’. Poststructuralists tend to opt for ‘ethnography’. Points are easily scored off the poststructuralists, who sometimes write as if they\n\nalone\n\nstood\n\noutside\n\nthe\n\ndiscourse\n\nof their time.\n\nNo\n\none\n\ndoes.\n\nOne\n\nmay\n\n24\n\nContinental perspectives\n\ncatch glimpses of another cognitive world in a society like nineteenth-century Asante, where the primary documentation is abundant and the secondary literature perhaps uniquely rich. Nothing more. Societies, like individuals, make a series of decisions, which are often subconscious, about what is important to them; these decisions are reflected in their\n\nlives more than in their words. It has been said that the Australian Aborigines have chosen not to accumulate possessions, in order to be free to elaborate complex worlds of religion and art. In Africa, much of the most advanced technology went into bronze sculpture. Iron, smelted at great cost in fuel and labour, was used in sculpture, as well as for utilitarian purposes. Wood carving (with built-in obsolescence in a tropical environment), the energy expended in dance, masking cults, religious rituals, all embody cultural choices. It is difficult to reflect them in a book of this size, but I have attempted to do so, in so far as the existing literature allows. The study that follows is a theme in counterpoint which concentrates, above all, on three variables — the ecological factor, the economic base, which made everything else possible, and the cognitive maps\n\nAfricans constructed to make their world intelligible. Silences\n\nOral and written sources sometimes speak most eloquently in their silences. These silences are deafening, but it is not always easy to know what they mean. Historians are becoming aware of the importance of ‘listening for silences’, aware,\n\ntoo,\n\nof a ‘past containing\n\nmany\n\nvoices,\n\noften\n\ndiscordant\n\nones’.!!*\n\nThe\n\ndifficulty is that many of these voices can no longer be heard. Historical texts reflect, not the totality of historical experience, but that small fracuon of it which is preserved in various kinds of source material. These sources themselves are often explicit about their silences. In the words of one version of the Sundiata epic: If you ask whether in that intervening period [between two famous kings] there were other kings, Of course there were, . 115 But their names are not known.!!\n\nIn the 1820s, it was said of the Akan, ‘Little kingdoms have been annihilated ... whose names have almost become obsolete.’''° In the words of a modern historian, summarising one dimension of the work of a generation of French poststructuralists: “The historian is never a specialist of past events ... He [sic] is... a specialist of past signs [sources]. More accurately, he is a specialist of those past signs which have survived into the present)?” We construct our own maps to makc sense of both familiar and unfamiliar landscapes. But ‘map is not territory’.’’® Of this, we must continue to remind ourselves.\n\nOut of Africa: the precursors”\n\nAll interest in the past is a dialogue ... The more precisely we listen, and the more we become aware of its pastness, even of its nearinaccessibility, the more meaningful the dialogue becomes. In the end, it can only be a dialogue in the present, about the present.\n\nM. I. Finley\n\nWhere should a history of Africa begin? Any answer is essentially arbitrary. I have opted\n\nfor an\n\nextreme\n\nform\n\nof Ja longue\n\ndurée,\n\nand_begin\n\nat the very dawn\n\nof\n\nhuman history, Lévi-Strauss once pointed out that history consists of ‘areas each of which is defined by a frequency of its own ... Dates do not form a series, they belong to different species. Coded in the system of prehistory, the most famous episodes of modern history would cease to be relevant.’? Here we deal with millions of years; as we come closer to the present, the entire time frame alters. Contemporary Africa, as presented in the media, often appears as a chaotic backwater. But if we enlarge our ume frame sufficiently, we find that humanity began in Africa.

The first hominid fossil in the Olduvai Gorge, in modern Tanzania (Map 1), was found by Mary Leakey in 1959, and the partial skeleton which became internationally celebrated as Lucy in 1974. An article by molecular biologists, published in 1987, claimed that we are all descended from an African Eve; this research has now been very seriously quesuoned. New hominoid species were discovered in Kenya in 1985-6, and in Namibia in 1992.* As research continues, the frontier of knowledge advances rapidly, and out-datedness is a standard complaint which recurs in reviews by archaeologists of general books in their own discipline. The interest of all this is not purely antiquarian. In what other branch of study do the latest discoveries figure prominently in Time? The findings of prehistory shed a most fundamental light on the human condition. The debate between ‘Out of Africa’ and ‘Regional\n\nContinuity’ theorists (p. 36 below) has momentous implications, because it is basically about whether ethnic differences are relatively recent, or go back to the dawn of humanity.

It is now generally accepted that the weight range of both ‘gracile’ and ‘robust’ forms was much the same, between 33 and 57 kg, hence the conventional use of inverted commas. All australopithecines were much smaller than modern humans. The real distinguishing mark of the ‘robust’ form was a massive jaw and a crest of bone on the skull (needed to support the jaw), which is also found in the male gorilla. The form now called Paranthropus robustus in South Africa and Paranthropus botsei in East Africa is first attested 2 million years ago and was extinct a million years later. The small-brained A. aethiopicus 1s known from a single skull (‘the black skull’), thought to be 2.5 million years old, discovered west of Lake Turkana in 1988. The South African species cannot be dated directly, and we rely on analogies with their East African counterparts, dated by the potassium-argon method. It was once assumed that Homo developed out of the gracile australopithecines, because we resemble them more closely than we do the robust form. It is now generally accepted that A. afarensis is ancestral to all later hominids, and A. aethiopicus to the robust forms. Some believe that A. afarensis was the direct ancestor of the earliest form of Homo (A. africanus, like the robust forms, dying out) and others that A. africanus was an intermediate form. It is clear that different genera of hominids lived at the same time, and sometimes in close proximity to each other. . The dating of protohumans, and the relationship of different forms to each other, has been\n\nmuch\n\nrevised in recent years; as new\n\ndiscoveries are made,\n\nthe\n\nprocess will continue. Problems of classification are due largely to the fact that most of these fossils survive in fragmentary form. A further difficulty is that we do not know how much variation existed within a species (all forms of modern man belong to a single species) or between male and female (the sex of these fossil bones is seldom ascertainable). An armbone\n\nlarger than Lucy’s,\n\nand\n\nthe footprints\n\nfound in the Hadar was much\n\nat Laetoli were\n\nthose\n\nof individuals\n\nof\n\n32\n\nContinental perspectives\n\ndifferent height, the taller being five feet. (The male mountain gorilla is much larger than the female, apparently because he must fight with other males.) A considerable difference in size between male and female australopithecines is now widely accepted. We know little about the australopithecines’ way of life. It seems unlikely that they made stone tools, though the matter is debated, or that they could speak, though all the evidence 1s necessarily indirect. A study of teeth suggests that A. africanus was an omnivore, like modern man. P. robustus lived on a vegetarian diet\n\nin which nuts and seeds predominated — hence a massive jaw and very thick dental enamel. Vegetable food probably predominated in the diet of A. africanus as well, as among most — but not all — modern hunter-gatherers, but it usually leaves no trace in the fossil record.”® Studies of their life expectancy have been made,7? based on dental evidence. One suggests that 36 per cent of australopithecines died before they reached their teens, and that far more gracile than robust individuals reached childbearing age. In a South African study, none of those examined had lived beyond forty. To see these figures in perspective we must realise that they could be paralleled from many fully modern pre-industrial populations. Homo\n\nhabilis\n\nOne of the most interesting implications of the discoveries of recent years is that the genus Homo (man) 1s far older than anyone had surmised, and first appeared 2.4 million years ago, and perhaps earlier.°° It has been surmised that this development was linked with global cooling at that time.?! There is considerable variation within the earliest form, H. habilis, and it may comprise more than one species.°” Homo habilis had a brain of, on average, 630 cubic centimetres (a ‘robust’ australopithecine brain was on average 520 cm, a ‘gracile’ one 442).*° It is noteworthy that although an increasing brain size is invariably taken as an index of hominid evolution, modern human brain sizes vary greatly and bear no relation to intelligence. Homo habilis means handy man and s/he was probably the first tool maker. Earlier hominids had used ready-made tools of various descriptions, just as modern chimpanzees use straws to extract termites. H. habilis deliberately fashioned pieces of stone into useful shapes. Older books divide prehistory into the Early Stone Age, the Middle Stone Age, and the Late Stone Age. Despite their inadequacy, these labels are occasionally used in this book, for clarity’s sake. Each tended to be idenufied with a particular artefact — the handaxe (now called biface), the Levallois core, the microlith. Like most oversimplifications, this contains an element of truth, but it 1s now realised that it is not possible to idenufy a technology with a chronological period, and that conventional distinctions between the Middle and Late Stone Ages in particular leave much\n\nto be desired.\n\nIt is also recognised\n\nthat the same\n\npeoples\n\nmade different types of tool in different contexts, and that many artefacts of wood or bone have not been preserved at all. (Often, stone tools are found some distance away from the place of origin of the raw material; their transport, and that of fruit, vegetables and nuts, probably implies the existence of some kind of bag.)\n\nOut of Africa: the precursors The\n\nearliest\n\nstone\n\ntools — called\n\nOldowan,\n\nfrom\n\nthe\n\n33 type\n\nsite,\n\nthe\n\nOlduvai\n\nGorge — were crude flakes and choppers made from modified pebbles. It is generally thought that H. habilis made and used these tools. (The pebble minus the flake was originally thought to be the tool; now it is thought that 1t was simply a by-product of flake manufacture.)** The earliest stone tools in the entire world which have been identified with certainty are stone flakes from the Omo valley, dated to 2.5 mya. It was once the fashion to study the lifestyle of modern hunter-gatherers such as the Hadza of Tanzania or the San (‘Bushmen’) of South Afmca, and extrapolate it back to the remote past — ‘Man the Hunter’. This stereotype was based partly on the large numbers of fragmented animal bones found in caves throughout Africa. (These are now largely attributed to animal — including leopard and porcupine — agency.)*”> Many now think that, since H. habilis weighed under 45 kg and was less than 1.52 m tall, it is likely that s/he was not a hunter but a scavenger.°° H. habilis was still mainly vegetarian, but competed with hyenas, jackals and vultures for the carcasses left by lions and leopards (or of beasts which died a natural death). These hominids used Oldowan tools (which would have been useless for hunting) to break bones and extract the marrow.”’ It seems likely that they turned to this additional source of calories as a means of surviving in the dry season, when there is little vegetable food available. Homo\n\nerectus\n\nHomo erectus developed some 1.8 mya, and survived until 200,000 ya. H. erectus was larger and more intelligent than his predecessor — about 5 feet 6 inches tall, with an average brain size of 1,000 cm. From the neck down, H. erectus was much\n\nlike a modern\n\nhuman,\n\nbut s/he lacked a chin, and had the flattened brow\n\nof a chimpanzee.*® The only relatively complete*’ skeleton discovered to date was that of a 12-year-old boy who would have grown to be 185 cm tall and to weigh 68 kg? (males were probably still larger than females). It was found in 1984 by the outstanding Kenyan fossil hunter, Kamoya Kimeu, at Nariokotome; its recovery took five seasons. It 1s thought to be 1.6 million years old, and is the most complete\n\nfossil hominid\n\nyet found\n\nwhich\n\nis older than\n\n100,000\n\nyears. H.\n\nerectus fossils have been found not only in East Africa and Ethiopia but also in Algeria and\n\nMorocco,\n\nwhere\n\nthey have been\n\ndated\n\nto 700,000\n\nand\n\n500,000\n\nya\n\nrespectively. A specimen found in South Africa may belong to H. erectus, and so may Tchadanthropus, found in Chad.*! It was H. erectus who made Acheulian tools, which are found from Spain in the west to India in the east, as well as in much\n\nof Africa.** The\n\nname\n\ncomes\n\nfrom the type site, the town of St Acheul in France. Binford rejected historicocultural explanations and saw the making of Acheulian tools as a biological response of the species, like the migration of birds.*? The intercontinental distribution of a distinctive artefact is one of the mysteries of prehistory, as is the fact that handaxes have not been found in Java, though both Java Man and Peking (i.e. Beijing) Man are examples of H. erectus. The absence of Acheulian tools in Java has been attributed to an environment where\n\n34\n\nContinental perspectives\n\nthey were unnecessary or to the construction of versatile — but not durable — tools from bamboo. It was, until recently, generally accepted that H. erectus migrated from Africa, where the earliest specimens are found, into Europe and Asia, some 700,000 ya, bringing Acheulian tools with him, and establishing himself rapidly in new environments with their help. Recent research has suggested that H. erectus in Java may date from 1.8 mya,** as old as the oldest African exemplar. If the very early dates for H. erectus in Asia are confirmed, it means that Homo left Africa before the invention of Acheulian tools. ‘Elephants left Africa several times during their history ... No other animal needed stone tools to get out of Africa.’*? The oldest human remains in Europe are about half a million years old, with the exception of a mandible from the Republic of Georgia, claimed to date from 1.5 mya. (If this is confirmed, it will be the earliest hominid found outside Africa.) The most characteristic Acheulian tool is the tear-shaped biface, so carefully shaped that it seems to reflect aesthetic as well as practical imperatives. A few stone tools have been found zm situ at butchery sites, but with these exceptions, we do not know their functions with any certainty. Without the cutting surface they offered, to cut through tough hides, it would have been difficult to consume game. The earliest known Acheulian tools date from 1.5 mya, the most recent, from\n\naround\n\n100,000\n\nya.\n\nThe\n\nAcheulian\n\nbiface\n\nhas\n\nbeen\n\ncalled\n\nthe\n\nfirst\n\ndistinctive product of human intelligence.*° It is possible that it was during this period that speech evolved, though some scholars place it much later. The sites where Acheulian artefacts are found are much larger than those which preceded them, reflecting settled communities rather than butchery sites, and perhaps this implies verbal communication. Since two particular areas of the left hemisphere of the brain produce speech, attempts have been made to shed light on the question by the study of ancient skulls.\n\nBroca’s area, which co-ordinates the muscles producing verbal sounds, seems to have existed in the earliest forms of Homo and even australopithecines, but few\n\nbelieve that speech developed so long ago. The larynx of an australopithecine was like that of apes and monkeys, that of H. erectus on the way to that of modern humans.*’ Attempts have been made to teach chimpanzees to communicate; since they are physiologically unsuited for speech, they have been taught sign language, or one of a variety of artificial symbolic languages. But the interpretation of the results is disputed. Myths from Africa, the Pacific and ancient Greece describe the controlled use of fire as one of the great watersheds in the human past. The controlled use of fire, and the ability to make fire,*® provided warmth, light and protection from predators and made cooking possible. There is evidence that H. erectus made use of fire, although some scholars attribute this development to archaic Homo sapiens.\n\nWhile the hominid brain grew steadily larger, the size of the pelvis remained much the same.*” This had important consequences; human young are born with an undeveloped brain, and are virtually helpless. The brain grows rapidly in the first year of life and the dependent human infant needs constant care; many of the calories it consumes go to neurological development. The young of the baboon or chimpanzee are born with their brains almost fully developed, which\n\nOut of Africa: the precursors\n\n35\n\nexplains their earlier mobility. H. erectus babies, like their modern\n\ncounterparts,\n\nwere totally dependent on the warmth, care and food provided by their parents. The heat and protection provided by fire may well have played an important role. H. erectus lived in caves in China half a million years ago; without fire, this would be disagreeable or impossible. H. erectus was triumphantly successful; s/he survived for a million and a half years, and colonised half the world. One\n\ntends to write of a succession of protohumans\n\nand forms\n\nof Homo,\n\neach\n\nlarger and cleverer than an immediate predecessor, and this is, very broadly, true. But it is clear that it is a series of oversimplifications, a kind of shorthand for a wide variety of archaic populations, often living at the same time, who have not been, and cannot be, fully categorised because of the incompleteness of the fossil evidence. Many skeletal remains are intermediate forms, showing, for instance, elements characteristic of H. erectus, and elements which belong to archaic H. sapiens — the classification of particular bones is a matter of fine judgement. If we add to this the difficulty of establishing an absolute chronology, it is not surprising that experts in this field are so often in profound disagreement.\n\nArchaic Homo sapiens There were a number of distinct forms of archaic Homo sapiens, and the labels we\n\nuse bear little relationship to their real complexity. The famous skeleton found in Broken Hill mine at Kabwe, in Zambia, differs markedly from the Neanderthals,\n\nbut is similar not only to specimens found elsewhere in Africa, but also to some non-Neanderthal remains in Europe.”° Its cranial capacity is 1,280 cm, significantly larger than that of H. erectus. A skull, found in north-eastern Ethiopia (Bodo), was, like the Kabwe skull, intermediate between H. erectus and archaic H. sapiens. So are specimens found at Laetoli, West Turkana and in South Africa. The best known and most studied populations of archaic Homo sapiens were the Neanderthals of Europe and the Near East, who died out 30,000 years ago. (The first specimen was found in the Neander valley in Dusseldorf in 1856, hence the name.)?’ Their physiology embodied a very effective adaptation to the last Ice Age, their culture was in many ways indistinguishable from that of early modern\n\nhumans\n\n- they\n\nused\n\ntools,\n\ncontrolled\n\nfire, wore\n\nbody\n\nornaments\n\nand\n\nprobably clothes, and buried their dead. Their brain was larger than that of modern humans.?” Why did they disappear, ‘snatching evolutionary defeat from the jaws of adaptive victory’??? Were they among the ancestors of modern Europeans, or did they die out, supplanted by invading H. saptens saptens? Specialists debate every aspect of their life, including the extent of their command of language. But there were no Neanderthals in Africa, and their fascinating history lies outside the scope of this study. Homo sapiens sapiens It is generally agreed that Homo first evolved in Africa, and from there colonised first the Near East and later West Asia and Europe.\n\nUntl\n\nrecently, this process\n\nwas associated with H. erectus and Acheulian tools; the redating of ancient Asian skeletal remains suggests it may be earlier, perhaps with the earliest H. habilis.?*\n\n36\n\nContinental perspectives\n\nThis problem should not be confused with the Out of Africa controversy, which is concerned with a much later period, and the evolution of anatomically modern humanity, Homo sapiens sapiens. The Out of Africa controversy began in 1987, when a group of molecular biologists published a paper based on the study of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).”° They used mtDNA from 147 individuals of differing ethnic origins to construct an evolutionary ‘tree’.°° The results suggested that they all “stem from one woman who is postulated to have lived about 200,000 years ago’.?’ This gave H. sapiens sapiens an age up to twice that of\n\nthe earliest known fossil, but there is no reason why genetic and anatomical differentiation should have evolved at the same time. These findings seemed the more convincing because of fossil finds, which, if not as old as ‘mitochondrial Eve’ were much older than earlier views of the emergence of H. sapiens sapiens (previously estimated at 30,000 to 40,000 ya) had suggested. Skeletal evidence from South Africa Klasies River Mouth in the southern Cape, Border Cave in Natal, and Florisbad in Orange Free State — suggest an antiquity of between 80,000\n\nand\n\n110,000\n\nyears,\n\nas\n\ndid\n\ntwo\n\nsites\n\nin\n\nIsrael\n\n(which\n\nwas,\n\nof course,\n\ncompatible with the Out of Africa theory). A site in the Omo valley was older (perhaps 130 kya).?° Because of the significance of the finds, the dates of each excavation are hotly debated, but they are mutually confirming, and the great antiquity of the fossils seems clear.°” They were much older than fossils of Homo sapiens sapiens elsewhere. Of equal significance is the fact that some of these specimens seem clearly intermediary between archaic and fully modern man. The Rapid Replacement (‘Out of Africa’) model, whose leading advocate was Stringer, claimed that anatomically modern humans first evolved in Africa, and then displaced all archaic populations elsewhere, including the Neanderthals. There was no admixture because they belonged to different species and hence could not mate and produce fertile offspring.” The Regional Continuity model, whose foremost advocate was Wolpoff, postulated an independent parallel evolution from distinct archaic populations, whose H. erectus ancestors did, he agrees, come from Africa.°’ This parallel evolution occurred in Europe, China and Java, as well as Africa. He and other regional specialists claimed that there were"
