Igboland is the indigenous homeland of the Igbo people located in southeastern Nigeria. It has been inhabited since at least 4500 BC and was a center of ancient bronze and iron working by the 9th century AD as evidenced by the Igbo Ukwu archaeological site. Igboland was influenced by the Nri Kingdom starting in the 10th century and engaged in extensive trade along river networks. It was colonized by Britain in the late 19th century and amalgamated into Nigeria in 1914. Igboland played a key role in the Nigerian-Biafran War of the late 1960s seeking independence as the Republic of Biafra.",
