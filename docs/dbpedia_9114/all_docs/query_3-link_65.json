        "text": "Stamp collecting opens up a world of history, geography, economics and politics. The former British colony of Oil Rivers is one such example. When Germany annexed Togoland and Cameroon, the British and French realized that decisive action was required before they started losing more of their colonial territories in Africa. A major Conference was held in Berlin (1885) where the major European powers carved up Africa for colonization, thus, with the exception of Ethiopia and Liberia, all of Africa was to be ruled by the Europeans. Needless to say, no African ruler was invited. Britain was given the area that would later become Nigeria.\n\nHistorical Background\n\nIn 1807 the British Parliament passed laws prohibiting British subjects from engaging in the slave trade. The subsequent decrease in trade indirectly led to the collapse of Oyo Empire.\n\nBritain withdrew from the slave trade when it was the major transporter of slaves to the Americas.\n\nThe French had abolished slavery following the French Revolution,\n\nthey briefly re-established slavery in their Caribbean colonies under Napoleon\n\nby the end of the Napoleonic Wars, France officially ended slavery in its possessions.\n\nBetween them, the French and the British had purchased a majority of the slaves sold from the ports of Oyo.\n\nThe Oyo economy suffered from the decline in the slave trade but smuggling of slaves to the Americas continued for years.\n\nin 1817, when the transatlantic market for slaves increased, Oyo was invaded and its own people taken into slavery.\n\nIn order to create an alternative to the slave trade, the British tried to develop “legitimate” trade – the principal commodities were palm oil and palm kernels, which were used in Europe to make soap and as lubricants for machinery. Although this trade grew—palm oil exports alone were worth £1 billion a year by 1840—it was concentrated near the coast, where palm trees grew in abundance. Thus the Niger Delta and Calabar, which once had been known for the export of slaves, became notable for the export of palm oil and the Niger river delta streams were called “oil rivers.”\n\nDue to the hazards of climate and tropical diseases for Europeans, merchants moored their ships outside the main harbours or in the delta, and often used their ships as trading stations and warehouses. In time they built depots onshore and eventually moved up the Niger River to establish stations in the interior.\n\n1841, one third of the people associated with the Niger River Expedition died\n\n1849, John Beecroft was accredited as consul for the bights of Benin and Biafra\n\n1850, a Liverpool merchant, Macgregor Laird, opened the river and expanded inland\n\n1857 the present settlement at Lokoja was established by the British explorer William Baikie\n\n1886 Royal Niger Company established its headquarters far at Lokoja\n\n1914 Lokoja became the capital of the British Northern Nigeria Protectorate\n\n1862, January 1 – Lagos Island is annexed as a colony of Britain\n\n1884, Britain announced formation of the Oil Rivers Protectorate\n\n1885, Oil Rivers Protectorate proclaimed by the British after they had defeated King Jaja of Opobo\n\n1885 the Oil River Irregulars were established, a unit of Africans commanded by British officers.\n\n1891 re-named the Oil Rivers Constabulary; they served in several campaigns against native emirates.\n\n1892 the British undertook an expedition against Ijebu, the only Yoruba state to refuse access to missionaries.\n\nThe Ijebu army was routed; the Yoruba states recognized British military superiority and signed treaties.\n\n1893, Oil Rivers Protectorate expanded and renamed Niger Coast Protectorate\n\n1900, Southern Nigeria Protectorate formed by joining Niger Coast Protectorate with territories from the Royal Niger Company\n\n1906, Lagos became part of Southern Nigeria\n\n1914, Southern Nigeria and Northern Nigeria were combined to form the colony of Nigeria\n\nThe First Stamps\n\nThe main post office was established at Old Calabar in November 1891; sub-offices existed at Benin, Bonny, Brass, Opobo, and Warri.\n\nInitially the postage stamps of Britain were used; and these would have cancels from the above post offices. Some stamp collectors (and postal historians) limit their collections to British Stamps “used abroad” which would usually have been quite a narrow timeframe, i.e. the time between setting up a colony and that colony’s administration issuing its own stamps. In July 1892, these British stamps were overprinted with “BRITISH / PROTECTORATE / OIL / RIVERS”.\n\nA pressing need for halfpenny values in mid-1893 resulted in a variety of surcharges on 2d and 21⁄2d stamps. While most simply read “HALF / PENNY”, with a horizontal bar to obliterate the old value, some were overprinted “1/2 d” twice, with the intent that they be bisected diagonally to produce two 1/2d stamps.\n\nThen, in 1893, the Oil Rivers Protectorate was expanded and re-named Niger Coast Protectorate. In 1895 the British took the city of Oyo under artillery fire, to force the ruler of Oyo to accept British conditions. When several Englishmen had been killed in the Kingdom of Benin in 1897, the British launched an expedition, confiscated their art treasures (most famously, the Benin Bronzes which are still held by the British Museum in London) and burnt their capital.\n\nA new stamp design was required.\n\nIn 1900, the Southern Nigeria Protectorate formed by joining Niger Coast Protectorate with territories from the Royal Niger Company. Once again, a new stamp design was required.\n\nIn 1906, the previously autonomous colony of Lagos became part of Southern Nigeria. They too had their own stamps up until this merger.\n\nFinally, in 1914, the protectorates of Southern Nigeria and Northern Nigeria were combined to form the colony of Nigeria – just before World War I erupted. The map below illustrates how the area developed under British colonial rule.\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nStamps of the World / Stamp-Issuing territories since 1840\n\nIf you found this article useful, please connect with me and endorse some of my skills on Linkedin\n\nTheCollectorsShop\n\nor follow me on Twitter\n\n@collectorsshopdublin\n\nor follow me on Pinterest\n\nThe Collectors’ Shop\n\nThank you."
