Ray Allen was part of the Boston Celtics 2008 championship-winning team. However, his tenure ended sourly, as he left to join the LeBron James-led Miami Heat in 2012. Nevertheless, Allen enjoyed a strong five-year run with the Celtics, averaging 16.7 points, 3.4 rebounds and 2.7 assists in 358 regular season games.

During a recent appearance on JJ Redickâs âOld Man and the Threeâ podcast, Allen discussed his tenure with the Celtics and his time with the Heat. He also touched on his championship runs and what heâs been doing during his retirement from the league.

Allen also discussed the sacrifices it takes to win a championship, especially when playing on a team that is stacked with talent. He was the third star next to Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce during the 2008 run, and then behind LeBron and Dwyane Wade with the Heat.
