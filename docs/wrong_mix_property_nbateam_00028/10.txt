College career[]

Allen attended the University of Connecticut from 1993 to 1996, where he earned All-American status and was named USA Basketball's Male Athlete of the Year in 1995. In 1995-96, his final college season, Allen was a first-team All-American and won the Big East Men's Basketball Player of the Year award. Allen finished his UConn career third on the Huskies' career scoring list with 1,922 points and set a single-season school record by connecting on 115 three-pointers in 1995-96.

In 2001, he was named honorary captain of the 25-member UConn All-Century Basketball Team. On February 5, 2007, his name and number were honored at Connecticut's Gampel Pavilion during the "Huskies of Honor" ceremony at halftime of the men's basketball game against the Syracuse Orange.

Milwaukee Bucks (1996–2003)[]

Allen was drafted out of the University of Connecticut by the Minnesota Timberwolves with the fifth pick of the 1996 NBA Draft. Immediately after his selection, Allen and Andrew Lang (basketball) were traded to the Milwaukee Bucks for the rights to fourth pick Stephon Marbury. Allen was a member of the NBA's All-Rookie 2nd Team in 1996. His most successful season with the Bucks occurred during the 2000-01 season as he won the 3-point shootout during All-Star Weekend, was selected to the All-NBA Third Team, and led the Bucks, as part of Milwaukee's "Big Three", alongside Sam Cassell and Glenn Robinson, to the Eastern Conference Finals, where they lost to the Philadelphia 76ers.

On February 13, 2008, Allen was named by NBA Commissioner David Stern to replace injured Eastern Conference (NBA) All-Star Caron Butler of the Washington Wizards, who was out with a left hip flexor strain, for the 2008 NBA All-Star Game in New Orleans. While LeBron James was given the All-Star MVP Award, many analysts, including the TNT commentators of the game, felt it should have gone to Allen, who scored 14 points in a stretch of 3 minutes and 14 seconds in the fourth quarter to seal the win for the East team.

On March 28, 2008, Allen was honored as the 3rd best of the 20 greatest players in franchise history during Milwaukee's 40th Anniversary Team Celebration, but couldn't attend the festivities because of the Boston Celtics' game against the New Orleans Hornets.

On June 17, 2008, in the series-ending 2008 of the 2008, Allen tied an NBA Finals record with seven three-pointers in the Celtics' 131–92 victory of the Los Angeles Lakers, and also broke the record for three-pointers made in a NBA Finals series with 22, eclipsing the previous record of 17 by Dan Majerle and Derek Harper.

Acting career[]

In 1998, Allen co-starred alongside Denzel Washington in the Spike Lee movie He Got Game as high school basketball phenomenon Jesus Shuttlesworth. Roger Ebert praised Allen as a "rarity: an athlete who can act," while New York magazine described him as "graceful and fast in the basketball scenes" while giving "a somberly effective minimalist performance." His role as Shuttlesworth earned him the nickname "Jesus" from teammates and fans.

Allen also appeared as Marcus Blake in the 2001 film Harvard Man.

Trivia and popular culture[]

He is a 12 handicap golfer and has a bowling average over 150.

His favorite movie is Schindler's List.
