While Allen isn’t expected to be there due to the Celtics’ training camp in Newport, R.I., Shannon Allen as well as the Celtics’ Women’s Group, mothers of NBA Players and Celtics front office representatives will be in attendance to help raise money to cure juvenile diabetes through The Juvenile Diabetes Foundation. The Allen’s young son, Walker, was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes when the Celtics were in Los Angeles during the 2008 NBA Finals last June. All Walkers must pre-register at www.jdrf.org (enter team name: WALK FOR WALKER)."
