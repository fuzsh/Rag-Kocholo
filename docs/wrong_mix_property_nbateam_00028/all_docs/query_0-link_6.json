        "text": "Ray Allen was in the holiday spirit while handing out Thanksgiving meals at the Boston Center for Youth & Families in Mattapan. Allen donated hundreds of meals over multiple Thanksgiving holidays in Boston through his Ray of Hope Foundation. “I think about my childhood and the things I didn’t have and I felt like I was rich even though we weren’t financially rich,” said Allen in 2013, when he continued the Thanksgiving program as a member of the Miami Heat. “Now as I’m in the position that I’m in I try to make sure to give back as much as I can because there are so many people that don’t have just the basic minimums. Just having food in the pantry. That’s the cornerstone of Thanksgiving.”"
