        "text": "The Nike Peach Jam is heating up after the weekend as pool play is underway at the Riverview Activity Center in North Augusta.\n\nThe top youth basketball players from across the country will face off throughout the week as a part of the Nike Elite Youth Basketball League. With a couple of games under everyone’s belts, leaders and chasers are starting to emerge from each pool.\n\nThe top four teams in the 17-and-under pools remained undefeated as of Monday, including defending champions Team Takeover, who were 3-0 with wins over Alabama Fusion, New Heights Lightning and Houston Hoops. However, the DC-based team isn’t alone at the top with the undefeated WhyNot team at their heels in the B pool. The two teams will play for the top spot on Wednesday at 1:30 p.m.\n\nBoo Williams caught Nightrydas Elite by surprise on Monday in the A pool, coming out aggressively on defense and dominating possession for the entire first half. Despite trailing for the first two and half quarters, the Nightrydas outlasted the Virginia-based team for a 73-66 win to remain the only unbeaten team in the pool. Boo Williams fell to 1-2 after the loss and sits in fourth place.\n\nIt was the Boozer brothers who came in clutch when the Nightrydas were in trouble. Cameron Boozer led the team with 22 points and 13 rebounds while Cayden Boozer and Dante Allen contributed 14 points each to keep the game close going into the later periods. Cameron leads the entire league in rebounds with an average of 10.7 rebounds a game while Cayden leads in assists with an average of six per game.\n\nThe real drama in the A pool was between Arizona Unity and City Rocks as the two teams battled for second place. Sitting in third place at 1-1 coming into the game, Arizona played with a purpose on Monday, dominating the 2-1 New York team 72-51 to take second place. Unity led the entire game, not giving City Rocks any opportunities to make a comeback late into the game like the Nightrydas did.\n\nShooting guard Kaden House took care of scoring for Arizona on Monday, tallying 28 points with a 73.3% field goal percentage and making three of four three-point attempts. House is the son of former NBA basketball player Eddie House, who won an NBA championship with the Boston Celtics in 2008 and was known for his 3-point scoring.\n\nIt was a team effort defensively for the Unity with 31 rebounds, 10 blocks and four steals. They played a clean game against New York, only turning over the ball seven times and capitalizing on scoring opportunities.\n\nThe Oakland Soldiers lead the C pool along with Canada’s UPlay at 2-0 coming into Tuesday when the two top teams are scheduled to face off with first place on the line. The D pool is led by Drive Nation and the Florida Rebels at 2-0. Those two teams won’t play each other until Friday.\n\nJerry Easter from Team Final led Peach Jam in points per game after Monday with an average of 24.5 while Jalen Reece of the Florida Rebels topped the leaderboard in steals with 3.5. Team Final failed to make it into the main tournament during the play-in games and is now playing through the play-in tournament, where they sit in second place in the B Pool.\n\nThe 16-and-under league was led by Team Takeover, the Florida Rebels, Houston Hoops and Expressions Elite while Arizona Unity, Team Herro, PG Elite and Team United sat at the top of the 15-and-under pools.\n\nTeams continue pool play through Friday and the top teams from each pool will move on to the championship bracket starting on Saturday."
