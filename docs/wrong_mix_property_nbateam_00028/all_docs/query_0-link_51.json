        "text": "Doc Rivers seems profoundly unconcerned with the fact that a number of people are picking teams other than the Celtics to win the NBA championship. Even the league’s general managers are taking the Lakers.\n\n“Oh, I don’t care one way or the other,” the coach said as his club returned to practice yesterday after a two-day break. “We pick us. We picked us last year, too.\n\n“The bottom line is we have to be a better team than we were last year to win it. We believe that. To us, that’s a process that we’re going to have to go through all year to improve as a basketball team. And I think I have a group of guys that are willing to do that.”\n\nThe Celts still have time to iron things out between now and Tuesday night’s season opener against Cleveland.\n\nOf his short-term goals for the lads, Rivers said, “Just getting on page with everything, getting their timing back and getting it to the point where it’s game ready instead of preseason ready. There’s a difference.\n\n“We understand it’s going to be 82 games of being attacked every night. That’ll probably in the long run be a good thing for us, but it’s something that we’re going to have to get used to.”\n\nThe Celtics also will have to get used to some new jewelry. Before they break a sweat Tuesday, they get to revel in the raising of the championship banner and the presentation of the championship rings.\n\n“You play for all of it,” Rivers said. “You play for that night when you win it. You play for the parade. But I think the two things that are the most special are the banner going up and when you get the box and you can open it up and you have a ring. Because when you think about it, that’s the only thing you get to take home. Everything else is hanging or stays in someone else’s cabinet. So I think the ring is something that’s going to be very, very special.”\n\nNice ring to it\n\nThe Celtics brass last night offered a sneak peek at the honkin’ piece of $30,000 championship bling that the team and coaches will score.\n\nAt its annual Shamrock Gala at the Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel, a replica of the NBA championship ring was viewed on the big screen during a live auction. It looked big, heavy and, if you believe it, rather understated.\n\nThe 14-carat white gold ring sports 64 pave-set diamonds, 20 princess-cut diamonds and scores of emeralds in the shape of a shamrock on the face. There’s also the Celtics logo, the player’s name and his number.\n\n“I’ve got big hands and this ring even looks bigger on my hand,” Ray Allen said. “I think my hand is going to be dragging on the pavement.”\n\nFor photos of the ring, visit bostonherald.com.\n\nStill building\n\nYou can expect to see a lot of Tony Allen, Leon Powe, Glen Davis and Eddie House coming off the bench at the start of the season, but Rivers noted that the supporting cast still is a work in progress.\n\n“I saw them enough,” he said of their stints in preseason games and practices. “We know who we want to play, at least now. As the season goes on, that doesn’t mean that someone doesn’t take another guy’s spot. It always is competitive. We know that.”\n\nAsked if he’s told the players the rotation, Rivers said, “No. They’ll figure it out.”\n\nThings are a good deal more certain atop the depth chart, with Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen, Kendrick Perkins and Rajon Rondo back as starters. The continuity is appreciated.\n\n“This is my ninth year starting a season, and this is the first time in my coaching career (having the same starting five),” Rivers said. “So that’s how rare it is, and it means a lot.”"
