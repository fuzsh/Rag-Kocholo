Paul Pierce signed this poster-sized commemorative issue of Sports Illustrated that celebrated the championship. Director of Basketball Operations Danny Ainge, who put the team together, said these five made Boston an attractive location. “With our team right now, we have a lot of people who want to come play for the Boston Celtics,” he said."
