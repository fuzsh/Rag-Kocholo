Pierce revealed that after the news broke, Allen never responded to his phone calls.\n\nExpressing his disappointment, he said, “We consider ourselves brothers, you talk to us and be like look you all, I am gonna go here right.” He added, “I don’t care you went to Miami but like if it was something with management you needed more money, I would have stood up for you, I would have been like, give him a couple more million, man we want him here right.”\n\nWhen the host asked whether he would have got a pay cut to have Allen on the team, he had no hesitation. “Yes,” came the answer.\n\nREAD MORE: “Isn’t It Crazy?”: Revealing Mind-Boggling Michael Jordan Fact, Matt Damon Unveils Extra Special Day for Himself and His Wife\n\nRay Allen’s feud with Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nFor the 2012-2013 season, Allen left the Celtics and inked a $6 million deal with the Miami Heat.
