        "text": "GREENBURGH, N.Y. - When the Knicks lost in Charlotte Monday night, they were rightly disappointed. It was an ugly performance, their four-game winning streak coming to an end with a one-sided loss to a team that had lost 10 of its last 12 games.\n\nIn their comments it brought to mind Christmas Day a season ago, when the Knicks expressed similar disappointment when they fell short against the Boston Celtics at Madison Square Garden. With the loss they fell to 16-14, the same record at the same spot in the schedule as the team sits this season.\n\nWhile they moaned about how that game got away from them in the final minute, the Knicks could not have known what was to come. The loss was the first of six straight and nine of 10. The Knicks never won two games in a row again the rest of the season and before they would take the floor for the first time this season, the team president would be fired, the star, Carmelo Anthony, would be traded, and the young franchise foundation piece, Kristaps Porzingis, would skip out on his exit interview and spend the summer in exile from the team.\n\nThe Knicks aren’t looking ahead to the remaining 52 games, trying to focus on the meeting with the Celtics at the Garden Thursday night and not even the brutal stretch of the schedule unfolding in front of them. But it’s worth visiting the ghost of Christmas past as the Knicks seek to avoid the same fate as last year’s team.\n\n“I believe if we stick together as a team and we follow what we’ve been doing and find that energy on the road we’ll be fine,” Porzingis said. “We have the fundamentals as a team this year to survive those bad moments and not, I don’t want to say break, but kind of bring our heads down. We’re going to keep pushing and keep doing what we’ve learned and what we know how to do, keep playing the same way even in bad moments. That’s going to take us through those bad moments.”\n\nMORE: Knicks' Enes Kanter stands firm as Turkey seeks to jail him\n\nMORE: Knicks head into the hard times without Hardaway\n\nThe bad moments may come, too. The Knicks host the Eastern Conference-leading Celtics and then head to Detroit for the second half of a back-to-back set. On Christmas Day they face the young and talented Sixers and then embark on a brutal stretch, facing 16 of 20 games on the road. For a team that is 2-9 on the road that is a daunting task. Injuries and itinerary combine to make it unlikely.\n\n\"Man, that’s not an excuse,” Jarrett Jack said after Monday’s loss. “Teams in the league go through it. Injuries are part of this just like practice. Cleveland is down a couple of guys. You deal with it. Houston was down a key part to their team. You deal with it. You deal with it. You step up and you figure it out. That’s what the NBA season is all about. Nobody is going to feel sorry for us, it’s a very unforgiving league. They’re not going to feel sorry for us and we can’t feel sorry for ourselves. That’s not how we going to get this thing going.”\n\nThe Knicks may not survive this stretch with their playoff hopes intact even as Porzingis is hopeful of returning to the lineup after missing the last two games with a sore left knee. The road hasn’t been kind, Tim Hardaway Jr. is still sidelined and the team just isn’t built to contend right now and only a contender could make their way through this schedule.\n\nJack’s comment leaves out the reality that the Knicks don’t have LeBron James or James Harden, the sort of player who can almost singlehandedly carry a team through a difficult situation.\n\nBut they don’t have to come out of this still in contention, still challenging for a playoff spot to make this season successful. While they speak boldly about a playoff chase the Knicks are in a rebuild, whether they want to admit it or not, whether they want to whisper the word tank or not.\n\nThe Knicks fell apart last season not because of a huge talent gap with the top teams. They crumbled with the most dysfunctional atmosphere permeating every level of the organization.\n\nThe carnival music could have played at Madison Square Garden rather than whatever the deejays were pumping through the speakers as Jackson sat grimly from a few rows up with Anthony glaring up at him at times, the two biggest names in the organization at war. There was James Dolan having Charles Oakley dragged out of the arena by security. And the players watched as coach Jeff Hornacek was forced to give up his own game plan to appease Jackson’s continued tilting at windmills, trying to prove it was the triangle offense rather than the star-studded rosters that won him his championship rings.\n\nThe Knicks have managed to avoid that sort of insanity this season, the stuff that had current front office members pointing out earlier this season that the first goal was to not be the laughingstock of the NBA. General manager Scott Perry and team president Steve Mills have orchestrated a calming of the waters through the first months of the season and no less an authority on the dysfunction than Carmelo Anthony noted Saturday that he sees a new mood among the players.\n\nThat is step one, no matter what this next stretch of the schedule brings. There is a nightmarish path ahead, but even if the Knicks stumble at the end of the road a lottery pick awaits and maybe, just maybe a process beginning to take shape that you can believe in.\n\nEmail: popper@northjersey.com"
