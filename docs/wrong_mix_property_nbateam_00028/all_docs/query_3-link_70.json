        "text": "The 07-08 Celtics were one of the most fun basketball teams to watch that I can remember. And they were even more fun to hate. As a then-tortured Cavs fan, seeing LeBron coming into his own only to run into the murderer's row of Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, a young Rajon Rondo, and, of course, Jesus Shuttlesworth himself Ray Allen was maddening. But under Doc Rivers, that team, and their obsession with the idea of community and being there for each other (\"ubuntu\"), was a sight to see. Closer to a family than a group of professional athletes paid to work together.\n\nBut as good as things were, they didn't end that way. No, Ray Allen chose to leave the Celtics to join LeBron James in Miami on his way to another ring, and Garnett, Pierce, and company treated the whole thing like he had left the mob. Remember Ray's first game against the Celtics with the Heat? To say KG was cold would be an understatement:\n\nBut that was five years ago. Surely, they've gotten over it by now. What's that? KG hosted a Celtics reunion on his TNT show and pointedly didn't invite Ray? And then they proceeded to go down the line and talk shit about how Ray had betrayed them one by one? Oh damn.\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nIt sounds like all any of these guys want is Ray to apologize for leaving them for LeBron. Paul Pierce even explicitly compares it to a bad break up with a girlfriend or wife. Well, I wonder if Ray will get the message and reach out...\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nAllen's post has since been taken down, but the feud continues. Does it seem dumb? Yeah. Do I love it so much? Of course. Sports are so stupid-slash-amazing.\n\nWatch Now:\n\nSteph Curry Plays H-O-R-S-E"
