        "text": "Today, Ray Allen's \"Ray of Hope Foundation held its annual Holiday Giving Tree Event at the Natick Collection. Beginning at 10 AM this morning, patrons could stop by and pick an ornament off of the holiday tree. Each ornament had a child's name with a particular present that he or she wished for. Later on in the afternoon, Ray stopped by to thank fans for purchasing these gifts and signed autographs to show his appreciation (hyper-extended finger and all!).\n\nThis event was very rewarding for me. During these busy times, I sometimes lose track of how lucky I am. I have a stable job, a house over my head, a wonderful family and a number of great friends. I will wake up on Christmas morning with presents under the tree. Some people are not as lucky as I am. I figured this was a wonderful opportunity to spread the holiday spirit."
