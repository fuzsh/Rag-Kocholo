        "text": "Ray Allen was decidedly unhappy about how the Coral Gables Police Department handled seven teens who broke into his home in the middle of the night.\n\nBut after meeting with the Florida State Attorney's Office, authorities have charged all seven teens with first-degree misdemeanor trespassing of an occupied structure.\n\n\"Ray and Shannon have been advised that the Miami-Dade County State Attorney's Office has filed trespass charges against the seven intruders to their home,\" attorney Gregory Victor said via a statement. \"The determination as to what specific charges to file was entirely within the discretion of the State Attorney's Office and the Allens are satisfied with both the decision to prosecute and the charges being pursued.\"\n\nThrough the statement, the Allens expressed satisfaction and gratitude that no one was hurt.\n\nSee also: Ray Allen Is Not Happy About How Cops Handled His Home Being Broken Into\n\nAccording to police, six men and a woman between the ages of 18 and 19 from a party next door entered the Allens' home through an unlocked back door that had a busted lock on it at around 2:30 in the morning last Thursday. But Allen's wife, Shannon, was startled awake by the group's noise and began shouting at them until they ran out.\n\n\"I just sat up in bed and said, 'What the fuck are you doing in my house?'\" she told a 911 dispatcher.\n\n\"They were inside, not outside?\" the dispatcher asks.\n\n\"They were in my bedroom; they were in my bedroom with flashlights,\" Shannon says. \"I sat up in bed and screamed.\"\n\n\"How long ago was this?\"\n\n\"About two minutes ago,\" Shannon answers. \"The back door is open by the pool; you can see where they came in. I was dead asleep, but I saw flashlights and I heard voices, so I sat up in bed. I think it was like five or six kids.\"\n\nThe teens explained to police that they thought Ray Allen had decided to join LeBron James in Cleveland and that the house was empty.\n\nPolice did not charge the teens at the time, much to the ire of Ray Allen, who released a statement over his disappointment.\n\n\"The suggestion that anyone can unlawfully enter into someone's locked home and then into an occupied bedroom in the middle of the night without consequences is unsettling,\" Allen's statement said. \"Regardless of the stated or actual reason for such unlawful entry... everyone deserves to feel safe in their own homes.\"\n\nThe main reason the Coral Gables PD could not press charges at the time was because of a law that says there has to be intent of burglary. The teens walked into the home wanting to take a look at the NBA legend's home, according to police.\n\nCoral Gables City Attorney Craig Leen says he's going to push to have that law changed, so that more stringent law can be applied anytime someone decided to walk into a home that isn't theirs without permission.\n\nAccording to TMZ, Leen will push for an \"emergency ordinance to change current occupied trespassing to an arrestable offense without an officer having to witness it.\"\n\nLeen wants this kind of trespassing to become a felony.\n\n\"Ray Allen and his family -- they're the victims here -- and we never want something like this to happen again,\" Leen said via TMZ.\n\nMeanwhile, the suspects -- Ernesto Romero, Kevin Ramos, Alana Garcia, Christian Lobo, Angel Sanchez, and Jorge Guerrero, all 18, along with Jonathan Ramirez, 19 -- could be facing up to one year in jail and a $1,000 fine for their trespass.\n\nAccording to Local 10, it was one of the teens' friends' mom who eventually turned the seven in.\n\n\"Eight of [my] daughter's friends did something stupid,\" she said.\n\nSend your story tips to the author, Chris Joseph.\n\nFollow Chris Joseph on Twitter\n\nFollow @NewTimesBroward"
