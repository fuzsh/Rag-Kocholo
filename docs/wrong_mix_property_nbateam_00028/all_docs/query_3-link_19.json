Here are some of his biggest shots.\n\n— Setting an NBA Finals record eight 3-pointers vs. the Lakers: In Game 2 of the 2008 NBA Finals, Allen hit 8 of 11 threes, setting a Finals record for the most in a game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKSxMu8iSBs\n\n— Nailing this game winner vs. Derrick Rose’s Bulls: The last three of Allen’s 30 points came off a brilliant out of bounds play.\n\n–More playoff heroics vs. Chicago: Allen had 51 points vs. the Bulls in Game 6 of that series, including a ridiculous three to send the game to a third overtime.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtqX6NACG6I\n\n— This game-winner in Philly: Allen slips to the corner, makes the shot. Chest bumps for everyone. Allen even got to rub Sam Cassell’s head.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MHuqPn-Q24\n\n— Beating the Bobcats…twice: Come for the critical steal to regain possession, stay for Allen being nails.\n\n–Willing his way to this 2011 playoff game-winner vs. Knicks: The Knicks knew Allen was taking the shot, but they couldn’t stop it.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/lBw5C7HgF40?t=5m23s\n\n— Crossing over Sasha Vujacic for a critical layup in Game 4 of the Finals in 2008.\n\n— Bonus: Allen takes out Allen Iverson in the 1996 Big East title game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcmfjKTA9Sk"
