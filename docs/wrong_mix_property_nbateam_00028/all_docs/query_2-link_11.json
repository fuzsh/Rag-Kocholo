        "text": "The top-seeded Boston Celtics and Oklahoma City Thunder have rolled to convincing victories in their opening NBA playoff series.\n\nEastern Conference top seeds Boston laid down a marker with a 120-95 rout of the fourth-seeded Cleveland Cavaliers at the TD Garden on Tuesday.\n\nOklahoma City, meanwhile, were made to work harder by Luka Doncic and the Dallas Mavericks before finally pulling clear to seal a 117-95 victory in their Western Conference semifinal series opener.\n\nIn Boston, Jaylen Brown scored 32 points while Derrick White added 25, including seven three-pointers, in an emphatic win for the Celtics, who are chasing a record 18th NBA championship.\n\nBoston were in complete control for most of the game, holding a double-digit lead through the second half to close out an emphatic win at the TD Garden.\n\nBoston star Jayson Tatum added 18 points but had an off-night shooting-wise, making just 7-of-19 from the field.\n\nDonovan Mitchell led the scoring for Cleveland with 33 points, with Evan Mobley adding 17 and Darius Garland 14.\n\nBrown said the Celtics’ defence had laid the foundation for the win.\n\n“It starts with defence, we wanted to set the tone on defence and we kept them under 100 (points),” Brown told TNT television.\n\n“But we feel like we’ve got an answer for everything so we just play the game the right way, and see what they want to take away and then we play after that.”\n\nGame two in the series takes place in Boston on Thursday.\n\nThunder edge Doncic’s Mavericks\n\nIn Oklahoma City (OKC), the Thunder and the Mavericks fought a nip-and-tuck duel before the top seeds pulled away decisively in the fourth quarter.\n\nTrailing by nine points at half-time, Dallas rallied in the third quarter to get within one point at 66-65.\n\nBut the youthful Thunder lineup began to find their range, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander adding 10 points in the third quarter to help OKC build a 10-point cushion heading into the fourth quarter.\n\nOklahoma City’s barrage of scoring continued in the fourth with Jalen Williams adding 10 points as the Thunder outscored their visitors 28-16 to seal victory by a 22-point margin.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander led the OKC scoring, finishing with 29 points, nine rebounds and nine assists while Chet Holmgren added 19 points and Williams 18.\n\nKyrie Irving led Dallas with 20 points while Luka Doncic, struggling with a sore knee, finished with 19 after shooting six-of-19 from the field.\n\nOklahoma City, who have an average age of just over 23, are the youngest team to win a second-round playoff game and were the youngest team to win a postseason series after sweeping the New Orleans Pelicans in the first round.\n\n“We don’t worry about all the statistics and the stats, and how young we are,” Gilgeous-Alexander said after the win. “We just want to win basketball games at a high level and that’s what we focus on.\n\n“We try to get that done every night and tonight we did so.”\n\nDoncic said the Mavericks would need to improve dramatically for Game Two taking place in Oklahoma City on Thursday.\n\nThe Slovenian star brushed off questions about his own shooting performance.\n\n“Who cares? We lost. We’ve just got to move on to the next one. I’ve got to be better, we’ve got to be better,” Doncic said.\n\n“They’re a great defensive team and a great offensive team, so it’s not going to be easy at all. We’re going to have to play very good basketball, focused basketball, for 48 minutes.”"
