        "text": "Located steps from home court, the Boston Celtics’ new headquarters at The Hub on Causeway presented a unique opportunity to design a space that incorporates the energy of the game and embodies the team’s iconic brand. The new workplace creates a “home” for each staff member with custom-designed workstations and offices, complemented by a variety of open and enclosed focus, collaboration, creative, and meeting spaces. The balance of space types allows for enhanced productivity, flexibility, and connection among in-person and virtual staff. A robust amenities program includes locker rooms for game-day prep, a café and flex space with sweeping city and harbor views, and a video-production studio. Throughout the space, the interior and environmental graphic design work together to showcase the team’s winning legacy, from wood parquet floors to installations of championship banners and retired numbers."
