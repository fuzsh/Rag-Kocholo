        "text": "Boston Celtics champion shooting guard Ray Allen saw his career 3-point record shattered by Golden State Warriors star point guard Steph Curry, with a passing of the torch from one of the game’s greatest shooters having taken place in the same sort of way Indiana Pacers legend Reggie Miller once did when Allen broke Miller’s career 3-point makes record.\n\nBut it might surprise younger readers to learn that the Connecticut product was not always known for being a lethal shooter alone, and actually had a fairly diverse offensive arsenal he would later downplay to fit into Boston’s schema, which he discussed in an extensive interview with NBA.com’s Shaun Powell.\n\n“Once I got to Boston, I was playing in prime time, and based on the way we were playing, I’m suddenly no longer a pick-and-roll player, I’m no longer a post-up player,” he explained. “I’m strictly a space guy who can shoot the 3s.”"
