        "text": "Enjoyment for Mazzulla is not enjoyment for most. He let loose a bit during the Celtics’ victory parade. He displayed emotion that was as much relief as jubilation because his master plan to turn the Celtics into an offensive and defensive juggernaut came to fruition.\n\n“That’s funny, I’ve been asking myself and my family, what does enjoy it mean?” Mazzulla told the Globe. “To me, enjoy it doesn’t mean get completely wasted for a week and just run your mind and your body until you’re dead. That’s not enjoying it to me. I think everybody has a different definition of it. I think that’s how you enjoy it, being present in the gratitude, being present in all the things that led to this. Connecting with people. Showing the fact that the analytics team or sports science team, connections between people and how we were able to get this.\n\n“To me, the enjoyable part is finding a way to re-create all those values and mind-set things we were able to do. You’re never going to re-create winning, but you can re-create the environment and the mind-set. I’m having the most fun already figuring out how we’re going to re-create the environment, the mind-set, the connectivity of all the things we talked about this year. How do we create them to be better and to be different?”\n\nThe Celtics essentially brought back the entire band for another run. Luke Kornet, Neemias Queta, and Xavier Tillman re-signed. Jayson Tatum signed a $314 million extension. While rivals such as the Knicks and 76ers have ramped up with impactful roster moves, the Celtics will enter the 2024-25 season with a loaded roster that likely will have to win differently.\n\nThe challenge of repeating fascinates Mazzulla.\n\n“I know greatness is only looked at in society as a trophy and a championship, but the process toward winning, that is what has been in the Celtics organization long before I got here, when I got here, and that’s the goal, to continue that process toward greatness,” Mazzulla said. “The organizational alignment that we have, the relationships that we have, sustainability that we’ve been able to have as an organization, those things have been going on before banner 18.\n\n“The goal is to continue that process toward greatness, the process toward winning, by focusing on the right things, the values that we talk about, the relationships, the mind-set, and the process of winning. That’s the No. 1 goal.”\n\nMazzulla was challenged on several occasions, including by this reporter, over the past year, yet the Celtics went 64-18 in the regular season and 16-3 in the playoffs. There had been questions about Mazzulla’s ability to lead a veteran team, to compete against the league’s elite coaches, and to be open-minded enough to adjust in clutch situations. He checked all of those boxes, but there is little delight in silencing his critics. He will not boast about the improbable run to a championship at age 35. That’s not his style.\n\n“I can honestly tell you no, there’s none of that,” he said. “This job is, in my opinion, ordained by God, and I knew I was supposed to be here, so I knew the whole time we were going to go after something and we were going to get it through faith. I just believed that. I just stuck with that, and one of the reasons why I was able to be so comfortable in those circumstances is because of my faith and because I had an understanding, and because there’s a plan and because I trust that plan.”\n\nIn the days after the Celtics won the title, the headstone of Mazzulla’s late father Dan, who died in 2020, was decorated with championship gear. Mazzulla said it was done by his cousin, Ronald, because he knew how Dan Mazzulla would have reacted to his son leading the most prestigious basketball franchise in history to a title.\n\n“That was cool because he would have appreciated that,” Mazzulla said. “And he would have been [excited]. If anyone knows my dad, when we went to the Final Four at West Virginia, he rallied around, drove to the regional. When we won the regional to go to the Final Four, he ended up on the court. He had a special hat that became a thing for the West Virginia people, so he was really passionate toward that. He would have been there with that type of passion and he would have loved it.”\n\nIt’s been four years, but Mazzulla said he’s just now fully digested the death of his father from cancer at 61. It’s been a process of accepting the harsh reality while trying to concentrate on his ascending career. He essentially hadn’t had time to mourn and reflect until he became coach of the Celtics and began hearing his father’s voice when he sought guidance.\n\n“It probably took me three or four years to actually grieve that he was gone because it happened during COVID and we went right to the bubble, and then the bubble was over and we started the season right after that,” Mazzulla said. “So everything happened so fast, and it takes time. I really went through that process during the playoffs last year, my first season, I was like, ‘What would he have done in these situations? What would he have said? How would he have coached me through these situations?’ I really started to grieve and feel his absence during that season and then I was able to process through that.\n\n“Heading into this [season], I just felt like he was with me throughout the season and I had an understanding of the principles he taught me throughout it. I had a better understanding of how to apply those and it was a really cool process to go through that the last two years.”\n\nIt would be easy for Mazzulla to bask in the adulation with all of those who were part of the championship journey. But the Celtics made some tough decisions on the way to this title, such as trading Marcus Smart, who put in nine years in Boston and fell just short. There are players who gave their bodies, such as Isaiah Thomas, or retired because their bodies couldn’t give any more, such as Blake Griffin.\n\n“The one thing that has really stuck out is all the people that have played and worked for this organization that didn’t win one,” Mazzulla said. “That has really been on my heart because the difference between winning and losing, once you win, you’re not better than other people. I truly believe that. I’m not better than any other coach that’s coached just because I won. It’s just been a group of people that’s been able to accomplish something together and so there’s such a fine line between winning a championship and losing a championship. It can come down to 10 plays, 15 plays, and for the Celtics organization I felt both sides of that. I felt like a burden of having to win banner 18 and I watched people, players, and coaches go after banner 18 and not get it.\n\n“It doesn’t mean that their work wasn’t great. It doesn’t mean their work wasn’t validated. It doesn’t mean they weren’t great coaches and great players. It just meant that it wasn’t time.”\n\nDuring the NBA Finals, Mazzulla made it clear that his faith and his family are his foundations. Dealing with the national media was a learning experience, and Mazzulla said he wanted to keep the conversation about basketball. But his beliefs have so much to do with his coaching style, his desire and philosophy, and they will have a major impact on how he approaches his future. He is proud of his transformation from a troubled college kid into a championship coach, but the transformation never ends. Mazzulla constantly evolves.\n\n“For starters, whenever we talk about faith, I want people to understand just because I’m strong in my faith doesn’t mean I’m perfect or better than other people,” he said. “That’s just how I’ve decided to express myself. I make a lot of mistakes. I think that’s the first thing to do when it comes to that. I have the faith because I know I’m imperfect and I need that faith because of who He is, not who I am. To me, it was everything. It’s been everything for most of my life and to me it was a culmination of being patient and following the steps.\n\n“Everything that happens within this realm is exactly how it’s supposed to go. I need to be faithful and patient.”"
