        "text": "It's been almost eight years since Ray Allen ditched Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett and the Boston Celtics to sign with the Miami Heat.\n\nSo, why can't the two sides mend fences?\n\nAllen recently joined Cedric Maxwell on the former Celtics forward's podcast and spoke candidly about his fractured relationship with Boston's players and fans since leaving the team in 2012.\n\nDownload the MyTeams app for the latest Celtics news and analysis\n\n\"I left as a free agent,\" Allen told Maxwell, via CLNS Media's Josue Pavon. \"I left because there were so many unresolved issues that the team wasn’t considering or willing to change.\"\n\nAllen turned down a two-year deal from the Celtics in 2012 to join LeBron James and the Heat, who had just defeated Boston in the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nMany members of that Celtics team -- Garnett, Pierce and Rajon Rondo in particular -- viewed Allen's move as a betrayal, and Allen says they still haven't forgiven him.\n\nBoston Celtics\n\n\"These guys kind of removed me from the 'Big Three,' said so many negative things about me and I haven’t had one negative thing to say about any of them,\" Allen said.\n\n\"We had tough times, we’re brothers. We went through a lot. But that doesn’t change anything that we’ve done. It hurt me over the course of this time just to hear some of the things that have been said.\"\n\nListen and subscribe to the Celtics Talk Podcast:\n\nPierce and Allen briefly called a truce for an Instagram photo a few years ago, but the 2008 NBA champion Celtics largely have distanced themselves from Allen, even when reminiscing about that season.\n\n\"We’re supposed to be celebrating in these times, having won (an NBA title) in 2008 ... but instead they want to be mad at me because I left and went to Miami,\" Allen said.\n\nFormer Celtics head coach Doc Rivers said recently he hopes Allen will return to Boston for Garnett's jersey retirement ceremony next season, noting that C's fans would give the Hall of Fame guard a standing ovation.\n\nAllen doesn't sound so sure, though.\n\n\"You’re talking about nine years now and I’ve gotten so much hate, death threats, vitriol from Boston fans,\" Allen said.\n\n\"As far as me being there, I think that is a subject that is really undecided yet. It would take Kevin and I to have a conversation moving forward.\"\n\nMaybe Allen and Garnett will have that conversation and an olive branch will be extended. But for now, it seems like the chill between Allen and his former teammates hasn't thawed one bit."
