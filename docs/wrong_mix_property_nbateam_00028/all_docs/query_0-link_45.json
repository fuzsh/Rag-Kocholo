        "text": "Ray Allen Booking Agent Details\n\nRay Allen is a former NBA guard who played from 1996-2014 with the Milwaukee Bucks (1996-2003), Seattle SuperSonics (2003-2007), Boston Celtics (2007-2012) and Miami Heat (2012-2014). Allen averaged 18.9 points per game during his career and became a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2018. He additionally was a 10-time NBA All-Star (2000-2002, 2004-2009, 2011). Known for his clutch shooting and long-range shooting skills, Allen in 2001 won the NBA Three-Point Contest.\n\nIn 2008, his first year with the Celtics, Allen averaged 17.4 points per game during the regular season and led the team along with teammates Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett to the NBA Finals, where Boston defeated the L.A. Lakers, 4-2. Allen averaged 15.6 points per game in the postseason. He won his second NBA title in 2013 after joining LeBron James, Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade in Miami.
