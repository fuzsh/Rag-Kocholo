        "text": "Over the next few days, Ray Allen's very publicly contentious split with the Boston Celtics will once again be under the national microscope as Allen is inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield.\n\nDoc Rivers, who coached Allen in Boston, returned to the city on Tuesday for ABCD Hoop Dreams event at the TD Garden. When asked about Allen, Rivers said he regrets how the Big Three era ended.\n\n\"As years have gone on, things have been fractured and I hate it,\" Rivers said. \"I hate seeing it. I would love this celebration for Ray. Not a lot to say here about it. Ray won us a title. He really did. I think he should be celebrated. I think he should be celebrated in Boston. He's responsible for that banner. If I had one wish, I wish I could do a better job of getting that group back together. I can get a lot of them back together, I just can't get the whole group. There really should be because they were so close and it really hurts me to see what's going on. \"\n\nAllen seems to have had disagreements with Paul Pierce -- the only player with whom he says he has since reconciled -- and Kevin Garnett. But point guard Rajon Rondo has drawn most of Allen's ire in recent comments to the media. Rivers said he doesn't know what could have been done about the fallout between the two.\n\n\"I've tried, I can tell you that,\" Rivers said. \"It's a lot of little things. Here's the thing: You have two Hall of Fame guys as far as their competitiveness. The reason that Ray was who he is, Rondo was who he is, Kevin, Paul -- I think Paul has done the right thing as far as throwing out the olive branch. It's also why we were really good is why they don't get along: Very stubborn, very tough, very competitive and no one wants to give in. The phrase I used to use a thousand times in arguments with the team: 'It's about getting it right, not who is right.' I hope we can get that right because they are all probably right in whatever they are saying in some way or form, but they need to get it right and get together.\"\n\nRivers said the rift didn't start right away. During the run to the '08 title, the Celtics were a tight and competitive roster.\n\n\"It was a close group, it really was,\" Rivers said. \"That team, the 2008 group, was as close of a group as you could ever coach. Everyone bought into their roles. It wasn't a perfect group all the time. We had our arguments and our differences and that's fine. On the floor, I'd take that group every night to go to war. If I had one game to win for my life, I'm taking that 2008 group and we're going to go to war because you know they were going to show up and do it together.\""
