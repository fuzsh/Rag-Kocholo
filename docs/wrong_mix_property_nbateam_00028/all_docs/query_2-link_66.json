        "text": "NBA Basketball star Jayson Tatum won a gold medal as a member of Team USA at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics that took place in 2021 —and he’s preparing to do it again at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nHe’s had a career that’s been a slam dunk. During his senior season at Chaminade College Preparatory School in Missouri, he averaged 29.5 points and 9.1 rebounds during his senior season. He reaped several awards including being named 2016 Gatorade Male Athlete of the Year, Gatorade National Player, a Naismith Trophy All-American, a Max-Preps All-American, and USA Today All-USA First Team pick. He played one year at Duke University before declaring for the NBA Draft. He was drafted by the Boston Celtics in the first round, number 3 overall of the 2017 Draft. He has been with the team ever since. In fact, Tatum led the Celtics in both scoring and rebounding during the 2023-24 season, averaging 26.9 points, while helping lead the Boston squad to the top seed in the Eastern Conference with a 64-18 overall record.\n\nRELATED: Brittney Griner Credits Wife Cherelle for Getting Her Through \"Hardest\" Part of Her Life\n\nThe 26-year-old has been named an All-Star in each of the past five seasons. He earned his first All-NBA First Team designation in 2022.\n\nTatum also created the Jayson Tatum Foundation, and each year the organization sponsors 100 boys and girls to attend an all-expenses paid one day summer Basketball Camp and Leadership Program.\n\nHere’s a look at Jayson Tatum’s personal and professional life.\n\nHis Relationship with Singer Ella Mai\n\nPhoto: Theo Wargo/Getty Images; Corbis/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nJayson Tatum may share a portion of his personal life, but his romantic life seems to be under wraps.\n\nFor years, it's been rumored that the basketball player is dating British R&B singer Ella Mai. On multiple occasions, they have been spotted at each other’s houses and made their first public appearance at Michael Rubin’s Fourth of July White Party in 2022, according to the NY Post. Then, speculation reached an all-time high when the Celtics star and the singer were both in attendance at his former teammate Marcus Smart’s wedding in 2023. The NY Post shared one photo in which Tatum had his arm around Ella Mai at the wedding, seemingly confirming the rumors.\n\nThat being said, there’s no word on how the pair met or if they are officially dating.\n\nRELATED: Why We Don't Know Yet If Caitlin Clark Will Be on Team USA for the 2024 Olympics\n\nHis son Deuce Tatum is his biggest fan\n\nPhoto: Maddie Meyer/Getty Images\n\nJayson’s rookie year in the NBA was extra special because he and his high school girlfriend, Toriah Lachell, welcomed son Jayson “Deuce” Christopher Tatum Jr. on December 6, 2017. Since then, Deuce has become an honorary part of his dad’s team and his biggest cheerleader.\n\nNot only has he become a fan-fave amongst the Celtics players, but he has stolen the spotlight in several of Tatum’s post-game interviews by jumping into his father’s lap. Deuce has supported his dad at many games, including a May 2023 match where he participated in a kids' dunk contest and met the dog who does halftime performances — it's no wonder Deuce is also a highlight on the team’s social media. He frequents the locker room and has a courtside seat, often hyping up the team by giving players high-fives.\n\nWhile Deuce isn’t on the court during the game, he is never too far. Tatum writes Deuce’s name in all of his game day shoes according to PEOPLE. And, in August 2023, Tatum was invited to throw the first pitch at a St. Louis Cardinals baseball game, and his biggest fan, Deuce, was right next to him as he delivered a strike to the catcher.\n\nHaving Deuce by his side has been Jayson's favorite aspect of his career, which allows him to be a constant presence in Deuce's life.\n\n\"I'm around him every day. I think being able to go through this journey together, because I was 19 when I got drafted, it's kind of like we're growing up together. As he's gotten older, I'm going through my career, sharing these moments, experiencing this together as we grow up,\" Jayson said in a post-game conference.\n\nTatum's Olympic Career\n\nPhoto: Adam Glanzman/Getty Images\n\nThis won’t be Tatum’s first go round with the Olympic Team. He was on the 2020 USA Team that played in Tokyo. The United States men’s basketball team won against France for its 16th first place finish in the Olympic Games. Tatum was the youngest member of Team USA, and he finished second on the squad with 19 points and a team leading seven rebounds. He became the first Celtics player to win Olympic Gold since Larry Bird in 1992 according to the NBA.\n\nFor the 2024 team, Tatum is a part of the 12-player roster consisting of LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Joel Embiid, Kawhi Leonard, Devin Booker, Jrue Holiday, Anthony Davis, Anthony Edwards, Bam Adebayo, and Tyrese Haliburton."
