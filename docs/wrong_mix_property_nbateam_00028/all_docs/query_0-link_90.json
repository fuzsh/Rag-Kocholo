        "text": "The Celtics were one of the most entertaining franchises during the 2021–22 season. Led by Jayson Tatum, Marcus Smart, Jaylen Brown and a strong supporting cast, the C’s won the division and the Eastern Conference championship en route to another NBA Finals appearance. Find out more about the players running it back for another season […]\n\nNot many athletes make the “greatest of all time” debate, but Bill Russell is not like many athletes. There is no player in history with more NBA World Championship titles than Russell’s 11. No Celtics player has won more NBA MVP awards than his five. And no player of his era perfected the defensive arts […]\n\nNot many uniforms in NBA history are as classic as Boston’s. The team’s iconic green and white threads have remained largely unchanged since the Celtics first took the court in 1946. As they say, don’t mess with perfection. Take a look at our collection of game-worn, autographed and replica uniforms connected to some of the […]\n\nFor the Celtics, the 1980s can be summed up in one word: dominance. The original Big Three rose to power with superstars Larry Bird, Kevin McHale and Robert Parish. Celtics legend K.C. Jones made his triumphant return to Boston as the team’s head coach. And the Celtics made the playoffs every season of the decade, […]\n\nOver the franchise’s 75-year history, the Celtics have called only two venues permanent homes. That’s because both Gardens have been among the NBA’s premier arenas. Forever immortalized for its place in Boston sports history, the original Boston Garden hosted the Celtics for nearly a half century. (In the early years, the team played several home […]\n\nWhile the Celtics are one of the most successful franchises in sports history, we’ll admit it – following the title win in 1986, Boston hit a rough patch. It would take over two decades to realign, but by the late 2000s the Celtics had built a team destined for another ring. Led by the “new” […]\n\nThere was only one Red Auerbach. In 1950, the young basketball coaching prodigy took over a struggling, four-year-old NBA franchise and transformed the Celtics into a dynastic powerhouse unmatched in all of sports history. Auerbach led Boston to nine NBA World Championship titles as head coach, then won another seven in the front office as […]\n\nBasketball shoes are as important to the NBA uniform as jerseys. Over the years, Celtics players have won big games and set fashion trends while sporting cool kicks – think Bob Cousy’s PF Flyers, Larry Bird’s rotation of Converses and Jayson Tatum’s multi-colored Air Jordans. It doesn’t take a sneakerhead to admire our collection of […]\n\nJohn Havlicek bridged the gap between two important eras in Celtics history with one thing in common: winning. Known for his smooth jump shot, smothering defensive skills and endless heart, “Hondo” became a fan favorite over his 16 seasons wearing a Celtics uniform. Havlicek arrived in the middle of Boston’s first dynasty in 1962 and […]\n\nBobbleheads are classic collectables among sports fans. It only makes sense that a franchise as classic as the Celtics would produce some of the best bobbleheads out there! Take a look at a few of our favorite Boston bobbers.\n\nNo one can question Paul Pierce’s loyalty to Boston. Over 15 seasons and a Hall-of-Fame career, “The Truth” played with heart and dedication each time he stepped on the court. He never gave up during the challenging early years, enduring the team’s inconsistent seasons and his own recovery from a near-fatal attack. Pierce blossomed into […]\n\nFrom 1957 to 1969, the Celtics did something no other NBA franchise has ever done. Apart from two seasons, Boston won NBA World Championship titles every single year in that span. That’s 11 titles in 13 seasons, including eight straight! Led by the likes of Bill Russell, Sam Jones, John Havlicek, Satch Sanders, Tommy Heinsohn, […]\n\nDuring 13 seasons with the Celtics, the truly legendary Larry Bird shined as one of the greatest to ever play the game. Leading the charge during the 1980s as a member of the original Big Three, Bird outhustled and outworked anyone who dared to test his skills. Despite his immaculate individual resume – NBA Rookie […]\n\nBoston sports fans are known for their diehard passion. With a team as exciting as the Celtics, it’s no wonder why the franchise has had some of the most loyal supporters in the NBA since 1946. Being a Celtics rooter is serious business: fans welcome players to their hometown, learn encyclopedic knowledge of franchise history, […]\n\nOn December 30, 2021, the Celtics and the entire basketball community lost a legend with the passing of Sam Jones. Nicknamed “Mr. Clutch” for his frequent postseason heroics, Jones won 10 NBA World Championship titles in 12 seasons with Boston – second-most in NBA history behind only his teammate Bill Russell. Jones was known for […]\n\nEvery Celtics fan loves to show off their team pride with apparel, gameday giveaways and other collectables. Who wouldn’t with Green and White swag as awesome as this? Scope out some of our favorite C’s gear – maybe you’ll find something already part of your own collection.\n\nBostonians love supporting the Celtics on the court, and the team loves supporting the community in return. For decades, the Celtics organization has given back to the city with chartable efforts and philanthropic works. Through the Boston Celtics Shamrock Foundation, league programs and individual initiatives by players, the C’s are dedicated to bettering Boston and […]\n\nThey don’t call him “Mr. Basketball” for nothing. Bob Cousy completely revolutionized the game when he first suited up for the Celtics in 1950. Over 13 glorious seasons, Cousy flaunted slick ball handling, skilled footwork and deadly shooting in a never-before-seen fashion that felt truly magical. He also led the league in assists eight times, […]\n\nThe Celtics faced a transitional period during the 1970s, but they didn’t suffer from lack of success. As Boston’s first dynasty came to an end with Bill Russell’s retirement in 1969, newcomers Dave Cowens and Jo Jo White along with veteran leaders like John Havlicek, Don Nelson and Head Coach Tommy Heinsohn worked to get […]\n\nThe Celtics had built a NBA World Championship-caliber team by the mid-2000s but needed an extra boost to go the distance. Enter Kevin Garnett. Coming to Boston on a blockbuster trade, the veteran forward was a perennial All-Star and rebounding champion known for his high-flying dunks and relentless defensive energy. In his first season as […]\n\nIt’s the most essential piece of equipment in the game, and we’ve gathered some of the coolest examples around. These basketballs have been signed by Celtics legends and passed through the hands of stars. What could be better? Dive into our collection of rare and historic basketballs here.\n\nTommy Heinsohn was there for it all. With nine seasons wearing a Celtics uniform, another nine as head coach and 39 years calling games as a color analyst, Heinsohn had a hand in the franchise story over six decades and 17 NBA World Championship titles. Along the way he won NBA Rookie of the Year […]\n\nCeltics fans see a whole lot more than basketball at TD Garden. With in-game entertainment featuring Lucky the Leprechaun – the team’s beloved mascot of more than 50 years – and the talented Celtics Dancers, there’s no shortage of excitement between the whistles. Off the court, these performers play a crucial role in community and […]\n\nWith 75 years of hoops glory, the Boston Celtics are one of the oldest professional basketball teams still in existence. But before the Celtics were good, they had to get off the ground. Walter Brown founded the Basketball Association of America (BAA) franchise in 1946 with a dream of making Boston one of the nation’s […]\n\nThe Celtics have such a long, rich history that it can sometimes be difficult to keep up – think about all of those Hall-of-Fame players, NBA World Championship titles and unbelievable on-court moments. Fortunately for us, the franchise has kept tabs on it all with annual yearbooks. In the 1950s and 1960s, the team’s “yearbook” […]\n\nIt’s hard to find a more impressive basketball career than that of K.C. Jones. During Boston’s first dynasty, Jones won eight NBA World Championship titles in nine seasons, becoming only one of three players in league history with eight rings. Soon after his playing retirement, Jones got back into the game as a coach. After […]"
