        "text": "Stevens prepares all year for the deadline, making the rush of the week leading up to it less hectic for him.\n\nMarcus Smart describes electrifying Celtics Game 2 locker room feud\n\nSmart agreed with teammates that the blowup in the locker room reportedly centered around his frustrations showed that the Celtics care.\n\nBrad Stevens consistent in Celtics moment of crisis for better or worse\n\nA 1 a.m. meeting, subtle challenges and respect all the way. You may want Brad Stevens to turn red and explode as the Celtics crisis, but that won’t make the team respond any more than they already are.\n\nThe Celtics shot 13-for-23 from the free throw line, bricked threes all night, but Grant Williams and the starters escaped the series on defense as Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum combined for 50 points.\n\nThe Celtics need to beat the Raptors in crunch time\n\nOutside a self-sabotaging Raptors finish in Game 2, the Celtics have only won the blowouts in this series. Tonight they’ll need an elite effort in the clutch to close out the champs.\n\nI miss Ray Allen and the Celtics should too\n\nThe Celtics should go all-in next season to embrace Allen as part of their history — and that may even include putting his jersey in the rafters.\n\nUntil the NBA returns let’s do what we can to help the world heal\n\nHappy birthday to both CelticsBlog and myself. To show both (or one) of us love, please consider donating to The Boston Foundation or any charity today.\n\nDoc Rivers blames himself for not making Ray Allen amends\n\nRivers wishes he pushed harder for Allen to be involved in the Paul Pierce jersey retirement. “I really thought that Ray should’ve been there.”\n\nMarcus Smart will donate blood plasma to COVID-19 research\n\nSmart was cleared of coronavirus and now his antibodies could lead to a possible treatment of the virus currently ravaging the world.\n\nWith basketball in the balance, Jaylen Brown puts everything in perspective\n\nSports will come back. The Celtics will come back. This is bigger than that.\n\nGrant Williams fitting in as Celtics small ball center\n\nMontrezl Harrell’s thunderous dunks on Grant Williams revealed the rookie’s limitations as an NBA center. However, the Celtics still won his critical overtime minutes against the Clippers as Brad Stevens continues to experiment with his big men.\n\nCeltics Make No Deadline Trades at Perfect Time to Consolidate\n\nBoston also appears in perfect position to make a run at the NBA Finals with no overwhelming competitors for No. 2 in the east.\n\nBoston Celtics interested in Evan Turner if he’s bought out\n\nThe Celtics saw Evan Turner play his last game with the Hawks on Monday night. Now he’s heading to the Timberwolves in the biggest NBA trade since 2000.\n\nBoston Celtics ready for rise of zone defense in the NBA\n\nBrad Stevens used some himself, but as others use it on as many as 10% of their defensive possessions, it forced him to make it a major point of emphasis in training camp."
