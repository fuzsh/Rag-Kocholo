Alec Douglas-Home (1903 - 1995)

Sir Alexander Frederick Douglas-Home, Baron Home of the Hirsel, formerly 14th Earl of Home (/ˈhjuːm/ HYOOM), KT, PC was a British Conservative politician who served as Prime Minister from October 1963 to October 1964. He is notable for being the last Prime Minister to hold office while being a member of the House of Lords, prior to renouncing his peerage and taking up a seat in the House of Commons for the remainder of his premiership. His reputation, however, rests more on his two spells as the UK's foreign minister than on his brief premiership.
