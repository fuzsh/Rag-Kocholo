        "text": "Former Prime Minister David Cameron has been appointed the new Foreign Secretary as a Cabinet reshuffle takes shape following Suella Braverman’s sacking on Monday morning.\n\nMr Cameron, who will take a seat in the House of Lords to enable him to take up the post, quit as Prime Minister after losing the Brexit referendum to Vote Leave in 2016.\n\nFollow the latest reshuffle news on our live-blog here.\n\nHow can a Lord be in the Cabinet?\n\nThe UK’s unwritten constitution does not dictate that a person needs to be in the Commons to take up a post as minister, or even in the Cabinet.\n\nIn the past, you didn’t even need to be in the Lords to run the country. Alec Douglas Home, who was Prime Minister from 1963 to 1964, was in neither house for nine days while holding the most powerful office in the land.\n\nAlthough the constitution hasn’t been amended since then, the ministerial code now says that you must be either in the Lords or the Commons in order to be a government minister.\n\nHow long does it take for someone to become a Lord?\n\nIt typically takes several weeks from the time a potential new member is announced before their actual appointment.\n\nA title has to be agreed and legal documents must be prepared, including Letters Patent and Writ of Summons.\n\nHowever, No 10 announced that King Charles has already conferred the dignity of a Barony of the United Kingdom for life upon David Cameron.\n\nCan they be held to account?\n\nTaking the post from the Lords means that directly elected MPs cannot hold her to account like they would be able to with a fellow MP.\n\nHowever questions can be put by peers during scheduled question times, as they would be in the Commons. Ministers in Baroness Morgan’s department, who are MPs, will be accountable in the Commons as usual.\n\nHave other people ruled from the Lords?\n\nHistorically speaking, there have been many examples of peers sitting in the Cabinet. Indeed the leader of the Lords attends Cabinet, although they do not run a department like a Secretary of State does.\n\nBaroness Warsi served as a foreign minister under David Cameron until 2015.\n\nPrior to that, Lord Peter Mandelson was Business Secretary and, effectively, deputy prime minister in Gordon Brown’s government, despite having left the Commons in 2004. Lord Andrew Adonis also served as Transport Secretary in the same government, having never been elected to the Commons.\n\nLord Salisbury was the last peer to serve as Prime Minister after he was appointed in 1885.\n\nThe 14th Earl of Home also held the top position in 1963, but renounced his peerage within a year of being appointed.\n\nDominic Cummings, the Prime Minister’s most influential adviser, is reported to have mooted allowing Lords to be questioned in the Commons. However this would be a significant change in constitutional precedent, as Lords are not allowed to enter the Commons at present."
