        "text": "Sir Alec Douglas-Home (born July 2, 1903, London, Eng.—died Oct. 9, 1995, The Hirsel, Coldstream, Berwickshire, Scot.) was a British foreign secretary from 1960 to 1963, prime minister from Oct. 19, 1963, to Oct. 16, 1964, and, after the fall of his government, Conservative opposition spokesman in the House of Commons on foreign affairs. He was also foreign secretary from 1970 to 1974.\n\nAs Lord Dunglass, the courtesy title he held until he succeeded in 1951 to the earldom of Home, he sat in the House of Commons as a Unionist (1931–45, 1950–51). He served as parliamentary private secretary to Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain (1937–39), undersecretary of state for foreign affairs in Winston Churchill’s “caretaker” government (May–July 1945), minister of state for Scotland (1951–55), secretary of state for Commonwealth relations (1955–60), deputy leader (1956–57) and leader (1957–60) of the House of Lords, and lord president of the council (1957–60) before his first term as foreign secretary. In October 1963 he disclaimed his peerages for life, took the name Sir Alec Douglas-Home, and succeeded Harold Macmillan as prime minister during a Conservative Party crisis, the most spectacular feature of which was an adultery scandal involving John Dennis Profumo, secretary of state for war from 1960 to 1963."
