        "text": "41. Memorandum of a Conversation, White House1\n\nsubject\n\nSoutheast Asia\n\nPARTICIPANTS\n\nBritish Side\n\nSir Alec Douglas-Home, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom\n\nR.A. Butler, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs\n\nSir Harold Caccia, Permanent Under Secretary, the Foreign Office\n\nSir David Ormsby Gore, British Ambassador\n\nSir Timothy Thigh, Principal Private Secretary to the Prime Minister\n\nSir Burke Trend, Secretary to the Cabinet\n\nU.S. Side\n\nThe President\n\nThe Secretary of State\n\nGovernor Harriman, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs\n\nDavid K.E. Bruce, Ambassador to Great Britain\n\nMcGeorge Bundy, Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs\n\nWilliam R. Tyler, Assistant Secretary, EUR\n\nRichard I. Philips, Director, P/ON\n\nWillis C. Armstrong, Director, BNA\n\nThe President suggested that the Secretary of State comment on the situation in Southeast Asia, and the Secretary remarked that good progress had already been made by representatives of the two governments in a common approach to Southeast Asian problems. He explained the talks of February 10 and 11,2 and went on to say that agreement had been reached to have some language in the communique to cover our understanding on Southeast Asia, particularly on Viet Nam and Malaysia.3 Mr. Butler made the point that Britain supported US efforts in Viet Nam and was quite prepared to say so in the communique, whereas Britain was anxious to have a comparable reference to Malaysia in the same paragraph.4\n\nThe Secretary reported further that there had been agreement to have a good thorough NATO discussion next week, with the US talking about South Viet Nam and Laos and with the UK speaking of Malaysia and Cambodia. He also noted the intention of the British to consider with the French what they mean by neutrality in Southeast Asia. Mr. Butler referred to the message from Couve de Murville explaining that neutrality for Cambodia was separable and separate from any efforts with respect to Viet Nam. The Secretary emphasized further that a review with Mr. Butler in an earlier conversation had indicated that in general the US and UK were approaching Southeast Asian problems very much in the same way, should keep in close touch with each other, and should move forward along various lines to be mutually helpful.5\n\n[Page 70]\n\nThe Prime Minister said to the President that he thought that the visit of Attorney General Kennedy had been extremely helpful in the harmonization of views on Indonesia and Malaysia.6 He again referred to British support for US efforts in South Vietnam. The President said this was helpful, because there were always questions in the US as to the extent to which our allies were also committed to support such efforts. The Secretary commented that the object of the NATO discussion on Southeast Asia was to alert all the allies to the problems caused there by Communist forces and to identify their interests. The Prime Minister added that the message from Couve de Murville had indicated a willingness to make a public statement on Cambodiaâ€™s neutrality, separating it from any question of South Viet Nam.\n\nThe Prime Minister wondered whether the situation in South Viet Nam was worse, or whether it was holding. The Secretary of State said the situation was worse, since there had been a real increase in the capability of the Vietcong. He noted that the resources, human and material, exist, but pointed out that the local Vietnamese have not been sufficiently vigorous. He said we must see what more can be done to help the Vietnamese to do the job, and that the next several weeks of the dry season are critical.\n\n[4 lines of source text not declassified] The President remarked that it was very hard to get a clear picture of the facts in the Vietnamese situation."
