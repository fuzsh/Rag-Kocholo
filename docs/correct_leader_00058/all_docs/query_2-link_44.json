Born in Georgia, he joined the Bolsheviks, and after the death of Lenin in 1924 he became leader of the Soviet Union. At the outbreak of the Second World War he signed a pact with Hitler, dividing Poland between them, but after Hitler attacked the Soviet Union in 1941 Stalin joined the Allies. After the war, Eastern Europe was under his control until his death in 1953.\n\nThis cartoon was published during the Berlin Airlift\n\nNikita Khrushchev\n\n1894-1971\n\nBorn in 1894, Khrushchev became First Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party after the death of Stalin in 1953.

He was ousted in 1964, and died in 1971.\n\nThis cartoon shows Khrushchev walking on the Berlin wall with a hydrogen bomb on his head.\n\nLeonid Brezhnev\n\n1906-1982\n\nBrezhnev joined the Soviet Communist Party in 1929, and fought during the Second World War.

He was responsible for signing the SALT treaties, reducing the number of nuclear weapons, and remained First Secretary until his death in 1982.\n\nThis cartoon refers to the anti-Soviet protests in Czechoslovakia in 1968 and 1969.\n\nCharles de Gaulle\n\n1890-1970\n\nThe son of a schoolmaster, de Gaulle joined the army and fought during the First World War. By 1940 he had become a senior officer, and was made Minister of War. After the fall of France, he led the Free French Government from the UK, and upon the liberation of France he became the head of the government from 1945 to 1946. He was appointed Prime Minister in April 1958, and later that year was elected President, a post he held until 1969.\n\nThis cartoon refers to De Gaulle's firm stand against communists in France.\n\nWinston Churchill\n\n1874-1965\n\nWinston Churchill served in the army until 1899, when he became a reporter.

He held several jobs in the government until 1922, when he lost his seat, then, returning to the Conservatives, he was back in Parliament two years later. In 1940, he was appointed Prime Minister after Chamberlain's resignation, and he led Britain through the Second World War. He lost the election in 1945 to Labour, but then returned as Prime Minister between 1951 and 1955.\n\nThis cartoon refers to the 1945 General Election\n\nClement Attlee\n\n1883-1967\n\nAttlee trained as a barrister but developed an interest in social problems.

He was appointed Deputy Prime Minister in 1942, and after Labour won the general election in 1945, he became Prime Minister.

He was appointed Deputy Leader of the Conservative Party in 1945, and became Prime Minister after Churchill retired in 1955. He held that job for less than two years before he resigned because of ill health, brought about by the stresses of the Suez Crisis.\n\nThis cartoon refers to a plan to give independence to Cyprus.\n\nHarold Macmillan\n\n1894-1986\n\nAfter fighting in the First World War, Macmillan became a Conservative MP in 1924. His comparative left wing views were not popular within the party, but he was appointed to the government in 1940. He became Prime Minister after the resignation of Anthony Eden in 1957, and held that post until he retired due to ill health in 1963. He led Britain through a period of economic growth, and became famous for his 'winds of change' speech on Africa, and his slogan 'You've never had it so good' referring to the economy.\n\nIn this cartoon Macmillan is portrayed as Earl Kitchener, in the 'Your country needs you' poster of the Great War.\n\nAlec Douglas Home\n\n1903-1995\n\nEarl Home held several jobs in the governments of Winston Churchill, Anthony Eden and Harold Macmillan, before he was appointed Prime Minister after Macmillan resigned in 1963.

He suffered from polio, but recovered and was elected as Governor of New York State in 1928. Roosevelt offered something different to the American electorate during the Great Depression, and was elected as President in 1932. He became famous for the New Deal, a programme that offered social security and help for industry during the hard times. He was re-elected 3 times and at the start of the Second World War, he offered aid to Britain under the Lend-Lease scheme, and joined the allies after the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941. He died in office, a few weeks before the end of the war in Europe, in 1945.\n\nThis cartoon refers to the Democratic Convention in Chicago, where protesters persuaded Roosevelt to run for a third term in office.\n\nHarry Truman\n\n1884-1972\n\nTruman became President of the USA after the death of Roosevelt in 1945. He was responsible for the decision to drop the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and he took a lead role in the establishment of the United Nations. He developed policies similar to those of Roosevelt, the Fair Deal, to regulate the economy, and he was instrumental in designing the aid package to Europe, known as the Marshall Plan.

He led the USA during some of the most difficult periods in the Cold War, working for a truce in the Korean War. He was re-elected in 1956, and served until 1961, but his second term was marred by race problems at home. He called the National Guard out to escort black children to school in some states.\n\nThis cartoon refers to tension in the US-Soviet relationship.\n\nJohn F Kennedy\n\n1917-1963\n\nAfter serving in the navy during the Second World War, JFK was elected a senator in 1953. He fought a hard campaign against Nixon to win the US Presidency with a tiny majority in the 1960 election. His aim was to spread American idealism across the world, and he was a strong believer in civil rights at home. He faced Khrushchev during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and encouraged the space programme, but made a miscalculation by allowing Cuban exiles to try to overthrow Castro in a failed mission. He was assassinated at Dallas, Texas, in 1963.\n\nThis cartoon refers to the failed Bay of Pigs mission, when Cuban exiles tried to overthrow Castro with the backing of Kennedy, and failed.\n\nMao Zedong\n\n1893-1976\n\nMao became leader of China in 1949 after a long civil war which ended in defeat for the government of Chaing Kai-shek, who then retreated to the Island of Formosa. Mao enjoyed a varied relationship with its communist neighbour, the Soviet Union, which became worse towards the end of the 1950s. He modernised China through a series of five-year plans, but his Great Leap Forward was mostly a failure. He presided over the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s, and saw improved relations with the USA during the 1970s\n\nThis cartoon related to tensions over the border between China and India."
