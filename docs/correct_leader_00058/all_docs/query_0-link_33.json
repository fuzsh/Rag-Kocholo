        "text": "Alec Douglas-Home (2 July 1903 – 9 October 1995) was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 19 October 1963 to 16 October 1964, succeeding Harold Macmillan and preceding Harold Wilson. He was a member of the UK Conservative Party.\n\nBiography[]\n\nAlec Douglas-Home was born in London, England in 1903, and he was educated at Eton and Oxford. He was elected as Conservative Party MP for South Lanark in 1931 and, in 1937, became Neville Chamberlain's Parliamentary Private Secretary. He accompanied Chamberlain on the visit to Adolf Hitler which led to the Munich Agreement, and he would lose his seat in 1945 before regaining it in 1950. In 1951, he left the House of Commons for the House of Lords, succeeding his father as Earl of Home. In 1951-1955, he was Secretary of State for Scotland, presenting the Conservative case for union against the growing strength of nationalism there. In 1955, under Anthony Eden, he became Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, holding the post until he was made Foreign Secretary by Harold Macmillan in 1960."
