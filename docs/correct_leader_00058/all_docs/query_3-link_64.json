        "text": "Britain’s new Prime Minister, Sir Alex Douglas-Home, was on a visit to Canada on this date in 1964. He had taken office as PM in October 1963, after Harold Macmillan stepped down due to his increasing poor health.\n\nIn Toronto, Douglas-Home addressed a crowd of nearly 2,000 gathered at Toronto’s Royal York Hotel to mark the 150th anniversary of the founding of the Empire Club. During his address the distinguished British visitor called on Canada to increase its efforts in helping developing countries, particularly Commonwealth nations, transition from colonialism to independence.\n\nIn considering his remarks, it is interesting to note the British visitor was a direct descendant of both Lord Durham and Lord Elgin, two leaders from Britain’s past who made profound impacts on 19th century Canada.\n\n“When I spoke at the Montreal Economic Conference in 1958, I quoted, as I quoted to you tonight, what my great grandfather said about the future of the Commonwealth and the future of nations; how they were bound to move from dependence to independence to interdependence and that is good,” Prime Minister Douglas-Home said. “So let Canada and Britain, who sowed the seeds of independence, who are working together for interdependence, help the world to reap the harvest.”\n\nYou can read Douglas-Home’s entire address at the link below."
