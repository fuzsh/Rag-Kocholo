        "text": "The UK has had 56 Prime Ministers so far with each of these coming from various political parties like Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Party (now the Liberal Democrats).\n\nThe political leaning of this office is not the only thing that has altered over the years with the pay packet given to those in power also changing.\n\nWho was the shortest-serving Prime Minister in the UK?\n\nLiz Truss was the shortest-serving Prime Minister in British history, having held the position for just 44 days in 2022.\n\nThe person who previously held the title was the Tory statesman George Canning, who spent 118 full days as prime minister in 1827 before dying in office.\n\nThere have been several prime ministers who for various reasons failed to last a year in the job.\n\nThey include two Conservative PMs in the past 100 years: Andrew Bonar Law, who racked up 211 days from 1922 to 1923 before resigning due to poor health, and Alec Douglas-Home, who managed 364 days in 1963-64 until losing a general election.\n\nRecommended Reading:\n\nThe last time Labour was in power in the UK as general election announced\n\nWhen was the last general election in the UK and what was the result?\n\nHow much is the British Prime Minister paid?\n\nThe Prime Minister is paid two separate salaries with one being for their role as an MP (£91,346 in 2024) and another for leading the government (£75,440).\n\nCurrently, the PM has a combined allowance of £166,786 but they do not need to claim all of this.\n\nDoes the Prime Minister pay tax on their salary?\n\nAccording to the House of Commons website, MPs \"pay the same rates of taxation and National Insurance as any other employed person.\"\n\nThis is also the case for the Prime Minister. Last year, it was revealed that Rishi Sunak paid 22% tax which equated to around £508,308."
