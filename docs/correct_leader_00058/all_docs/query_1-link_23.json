        "text": "Lord Home who has died at the age of 92, was in manner unobtrusive and undemanding yet reached the height of his political career, first as foreign secretary and next as prime minister, in melodramatic circumstances. He was the first foreign secretary for 20 years to be a member of the House of Lords he was the first (and surely last) man ever to disclaim six peerages to become prime minister and he was responsible for arranging that his successor should be chosen by secret ballot held among Conservative members of the House of Commons, with equally melodramatic consequences.\n\nHis period of supreme power was short. He became prime minister on October 19 1963, and resigned on October 16 1964, when Labour won the general election. He remained leader of the opposition and of the Conservative party from that date only until July 28, 1965, when he resigned, and was succeeded by Edward Heath. In turn, his leader appointed him foreign secretary when the party returned to power in June 1970.\n\nThe explanation of his brief tenure of power lies in a combination of circumstances. The events leading to his appointment as prime minister in succession to Harold Macmillan enveloped the Conservative party in a cloud of Tory recriminations that challenged his authority as party leader. Hence Sir Alec's decision that the next leader should not be left to 'emerge' by a series of private manoeuvres. He did not foresee the constitutional turmoil this apparently straightforward arrangement would cause when a party election was forced when the Conservatives were in power, so that Conservative MPs would be electing not merely a party leader but a prime minister as well.\n\nThe succession to Macmillan was contested by Rab (later Lord) Butler, Lord Hailsham (later Quintin Hogg and later still Lord Hailsham), and Reginald Maudling. Sir Alec did not appear to be a candidate at all, but he emerged because he disunited the party less than any of the others. The delicacy of his position was shown by the fact that he did not inform the Queen that he could form a government, on October 19 1963, until he had first secured, earlier that day, the agreement of Butler and Maudling to serve in the cabinet. Even so, Iain Macleod and Enoch Powell refused invitations to join the new government and Macleod published in the Spectator a caustic account of all the skullduggery.\n\nAfter this inauspicious start, the Conservatives lost the general election a year later. Although the number of Conservative MPs fell from 350 at Parliament's dissolution to 303, Tories loyal to Sir Alec - and several independent observers - held that no other leader could have held as much ground as he did, keeping Labour down to a majority of four over Conservatives and Liberals combined. Yet the campaign fed doubts among party managers about Sir Alec's ability to personify enterprise, yout hfulness, and relevance to contemporary circumstances.\n\nConservative Central Office became obsessed with the effect of Sir Alec's television 'image', then a new ingredient in electoral politics. These doubts grew when he became leader of the opposition. In the end, none of his political virtues protected him from an atmosphere of doubt within the party hierarchy which he chose to regard as a notice to quit. So he went, but retained his membership of the House of Commons. His support was indispensable when his successor, Edward Heath, within a few weeks of his election as leader, had to manage a Conservative party that was made extremely restless by the Labour government's action following Rhodesia's illegal declaration of independence. Seldom, before or since, has a defeated leader behaved so magnanimously to his successor.\n\nSir Alec's virtues, by Conservative party tests, were his political 'soundness' (he was an instinctive Conservative of the centre, or perhaps a little to the right), his detachment from normal party rivalries which his birth and training secured for him, his seriousness and integrity as a public figure, and the impression he gave of being 'all of a piece.'\n\nHe had no gifts of imagination or of oratory, and he knew it. In a broadcast he made on the day he became prime minister he said: \"No one need expect any stunts from me - merely plain, simple talking.\" Nor was he flamboyant in private. A great Scottish landowner, taken with the gentlemanly pursuits of hunting, shooting and fishing, he had a lifelong interest in cricket, and carried about with him a form-book for the Turf. Racing, observed his playwright brother William, was always Sir Alec's main interest.\n\nSir Alec was the eldest son of the 13th Earl of Home and Lilian, daughter of the 4th Earl of Durham. Until he succeeded his father in 1951 he was known by the courtesy title of Lord Dunglass. He went to Eton where he was known as a cricketer and as President of 'Pop,' that exclusive society over which Jo Grimond, his Liberal rival, was later to preside.\n\nA weirdly prescient vignette in Cyril Connolly's Enemies Of Promise (1938) called Dunglass \"a votary of the esoteric Eton religion, the kind of graceful, tolerant, sleepy boy who is showered with favours and crowned with all the laurels, who is liked by the masters and admired by the boys without any apparent exertion on his part, without experiencing the ill-effects of success himself or arousing the pangs of envy in others. In the 18th century he would have become Prime Minister before he was 30 as it was, he appeared honourably ineligible for the struggle of life.\" From Eton he went to Christ Church, Oxford, where he failed to get a cricket Blue. But the 18th century eventually caught up with the 20th.\n\nThe Homes were an old-established Scottish family, and Sir Alec decided to contest a Scottish seat for parliament. In 1929 - a superb year for claret but a bad year for the Conservatives - he stood for Coatbridge, a Labour seat, and came second in a three-cornered fight. Two years later - a stunning year for his party - he was elected as member for South Lanark and sat until Labour's 1945 landslide. He lost his seat (the family butler's tearful concern at the cataclysm stimulated William's imagination to produce his famous comedy, The Chiltern Hundreds.) He did not re-enter the Commons until the general election of 1950 when he was returned for Lanark: a year later, on the death of his father, he had to go to the House of Lords as the 14th Earl of Home.\n\nIn this phase of his career, Sir Alec did not become in any way eminent. As a young member, during the period of mass unemployment, he had few economic remedies to offer. Labour MP Emrys Hughes recalled in a critical biography (1964) that the young member for South Lanark had suggested in the Commons that unemployed coal miners and their families might be brought down from Scotland to the London area to work as domestic servants.\n\nThe one event of the pre-1939 period for which he was remembered was his service as parliamentary private secretary to the prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, from 1937 to 1939 and his identification with Chamberlain's appeasement policy. His political role at that time was modest enough for him to be forgiven. After Churchill became prime minister in 1940 Sir Alec faded into the background. He was an officer in the Lanarkshire Yeomanry, but an injury to his back limited his activity during the war. When Churchill formed his 'caretaker' government (May-July, 1945), Sir Alec was given his first ministerial appointment, as under-secretary for foreign affairs, under Anthony Eden. But Labour's term of office from 1945 to 1951 dismissed him once more to the shadows.\n\nThe return of the Conservatives to office in 1951 was the true start of Sir Alec's rise to power. When Churchill formed his government in 1951, Sir Alec, now Lord Home, was appointed minister of state at the Scottish Office and held this post until 1955. He was then promoted commonwealth relations secretary which he remained until 1960. In this office, he was given other duties, first as deputy leader of the House of Lords (1956-57) and later as leader (1957-60).\n\nFrom 1960 Sir Alec's career became positively dazzling. In that year, prime minister Harold Macmillan appointed Sir Alec as foreign secretary. No member of the House of Lords had held that office since the late Lord Halifax, who was foreign secretary from 1938 to 1940. (Members of the House of Commons prefer to have the principal ministers in their sights.) But the direction of foreign policy was essentially in the control of the prime ministers of the day - Chamberlain and Churchill over Halifax Macmillan over Home. And from 1940 onwards there had been a growing tendency for prime ministers to make the great policy decisions in personal contact with the heads of other states - wisely or not.\n\nSir Alec had one outstanding quality for his work as foreign secretary: to some foreigners he was the very embodiment of a moderate, British, Conservative tradition - although Americans missed a democratic touch in him.\n\nThe foreign policy was Macmillan's, but Sir Alec made one personal contribution that provoked hot controversy in parliament. On December 28, 1961, he made a speech strongly attacking the United Nations. He spoke of \"a crisis of confidence\" at the UN arising, as he put it, from the double standards that were being applied - one for the democracies, and another for the Communist and Afro-Asian countries.\n\nHe criticised in particular the Security Council's vote in favour of India's attack on Goa - the first time, he said, that the UN had \"voted publicly and without shame in favour of the use of force to achieve national ends\" - and also the tendency of newer members of the UN to concentrate on \"ending colonialism\" without regard \"to the primary Charter obligations to maintain international peace and security.\" For Labour, with the taste of Suez still in their mouths, Hugh Gaitskell described this as \"the worst humbug and hypocrisy.\"\n\nOne other notable event occurred while Sir Alec was foreign secretary. On August 5, 1963, he signed for Britain the nuclear test ban treaty which had been arranged with the US and the USSR.\n\nBy 1963 a succession of crises and scandals, culminating in the resignation of war minister John Profumo in the Christine Keeler affair, led to Macmillan's retirement. That October Sir Alec succeeded to the premiership. Constitutionally, the means by which he qualified himself to be prime minister were novel at the time and remain relevant.\n\nNo member of the House of Lords had been prime minister since the time of Lord Salisbury's last administration (1895-1902), and Sir Alec's career must have fixed the convention that the prime minister must always be a member of the House of Commons. The Peerage Act 1963 permitted members of the House of Lords, in certain circumstances, to disclaim their peerages for life and thus to be free to stand for election to the Commons.\n\nThe first politician who announced his intention to disclaim his peerage, in order to compete for the succession to Macmillan, was Lord Hailsham. But Lord Home used the machinery of the Act to disclaim his own peerages after he had been appointed prime minister. He was then the first beneficiary of Anthony Wedgwood Benn's successful constitutional campaign to disclaim his own peerage, somewhat to the discomfiture of Benn and other Labour MPs.\n\nOn October 23, 1963, Sir Alec signed an instrument of disclaimer of four titles of Scotland - the earldom of Home, the lordship of Dunglass, the lordship of Home and the lordship of Hume of Berwick, one United Kingdom peerage - the barony of Douglas and one British peerage - the barony of Hume of Berwick. He remained 'Sir' Alec because he had been created a Knight of the Thistle in 1962.\n\nHaving disclaimed his peerages, he was elected a member of the House of Commons for Kinross and West Perthshire. To allow the byelection the opening of a new session of parliament was postponed from October 29 until November 12.\n\nThere is little to tell of Sir Alec's year as prime minister. The statutory life of the parliament elected in 1959 was running out, and the most awkward problem his government had to face was the usual increasingly adverse balance of payments and a growing threat to sterling. Sir Alec had no gift for handling such a problem, and the Conservatives were naturally not anxious to enter a general election with a programme of economic austerity.\n\nSir Alec's attitude towards the up-and-coming Margaret Thatcher was admiration tinged with awe. When they were cabinet colleagues under Edward Heath he is on record as remarking that \"she's got the brains of all of us put together, and so we'd better look out.\" In personality and political style the two were a world apart, yet the turbulent and confused political scene revealed, as it unfolded, strange similarities.\n\nBoth found themselves leading their party from the right of centre, against what most people took to be the tide of the time. Thatcher, when she came to assume power, had no hesitation in following the Macmillan-Home precedent by making another peer, Lord Carrington, her foreign secretary. Yet Eden, decades earlier, had wanted Lord Salisbury for the post but had decided that his appointment would be unacceptable to the Commons.\n\nIn practice Home's occupation, as of right, of the two Houses had proved a convenience and at times even a benefit to parliament. Yet he seemed more truly at home in the better-behaved Lords, where his modest style was less likely to be misinterpreted. He enjoyed quiet jokes and liked telling an interviewer that he could never be prime minister because he did his sums with matchsticks. A year later he was in Number 10. A year after that, from the opposition front bench, he was able to make the mild claim that his matchsticks seemed to work at least as well as Labour's economic devices and advisers.\n\nThen there was the joke about the 14th Mr Wilson, in retaliation for Harold Wilson's repeated jibes about the 14th Earl. He could be the target of more punishing wit, as when Michael Foot, noting a tendency to be tougher abroad than at home, called him \"a belligerent Bertie Wooster without even a Jeeves to restrain him.\"\n\nBut these occasions were uncommon. Home on the home front made a frustrating opponent because his habitual courtesy, rare in the modern Commons, acted as an independent deterrent - an armour which was so defensively effective that he hardly needed weapons of attack.\n\nHis second spell as foreign secretary carried us relentlessly into modern times: Europe and the cold war, the American relationship, conflict and arms sales in the Middle East. Aware always of what he called \"the desperately thin ice\" we walked on, he surveyed the world and our place in it with a pensive realism, striking no heroic postures. It was with complete if ever-quiet authority that he was able to assure James Callaghan, handing over the foreign secretaryship when Labour assumed office in the mid-seventies, that \"we have both been the shadow but the substance is very different.\"\n\nThat had to be true on the home front, too. Any idea of Lord Home moving into history as an agent of change, forward change at least, must seem bizarre. Yet the 14th earl could hardly have made his final return as plain Lord Home of the Hirsel, a humble life peer, without reflecting that after the constitutional disturbance which had enabled him to shed his earldom, and become prime minister, the House of Lords could never be the same again.\n\nIn 1991-92 Margaret Thatcher's acceptance of a life peerage may have been eased by the Home example of moving House in the necessary direction at his country's call. The delights and perils of the British constitution are that you never quite know.\n\nHis wife Elizabeth predeceased him. They had a son, now the 15th Earl, and three daughters.\n\nLord Home (Alexander Frederick Douglas - Home ) politician, born July 2 1903 died October 9 1995"
