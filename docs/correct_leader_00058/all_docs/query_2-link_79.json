        "text": "Her Majesty the Queen's reign spanned 15 Prime Ministers\n\nHer Majesty Queen Elizabeth II reigned for longer than any other monarch in British History and saw a huge amount of change, including having 15 UK Prime Ministers.\n\nAs Head of State, Her Majesty worked with both Conservative and Labour Prime Ministers, in what the official Royal website describes as \"special\" relationships.\n\nAlthough not permitted to vote in elections and remaining firmly neutral on political matters, her role was actually very important, retaining the right to appoint the Prime Minister as well as inviting the winners of general elections to form a Government in her name.\n\nOne of her final acts as sovereign was to meet with Liz Truss and ask her to form a government.\n\nShe had weekly one-to-one confidential meetings with all the serving Prime Ministers which took place behind closed doors with no-one else present.\n\nAs we mourn the death of Queen Elizabeth II, we've taken a look back at each of the Prime Ministers who served her during her reign.\n\n1. Winston Churchill 1952-1955\n\nQueen Elizabeth’s first Prime Minister when she came to the throne in 1952 was Conservative leader Winston Churchill.\n\nWhile the Queen was only 25 when she ascended the throne, Churchill was 67 and already had years of experience to his name, having served as the Prime Minister from 1940-1945, before being re-elected in 1951.\n\nThe pair's relationship is thought to have been strong, with Queen Elizabeth granting permission for Churchill's state funeral, which are usually only held for members of the Royal family.\n\n2. Anthony Eden 1955-1957\n\nChurchill was succeeded by his deputy, Anthony Eden, in 1955. Eden is considered by many to be one of Britain’s least successful Prime Minister’s, serving for two years before resigning on the grounds of ill health.\n\n3. Harold McMillan 1957-1963\n\nHarold McMillan followed Eden, becoming Prime Minister in 1957. A former pupil of Eton school, his tenure lasted 6 years, during which time he appointed 35 fellow Etonians to Government posts. He resigned in 1963 after various scandals and growing concerns he was “out of touch”.\n\n4. Alec Douglas-Home 1963-1964\n\nAnother Conservative politician took the reins in 1963, however Alec Douglas Home did not even hold office for a year, making his premiership the shortest of the Queen's reign.\n\n5. Harold Wilson 1964-1970, 1974-1976\n\nThe Labour party won the 1964 general election, marking the end of the 13-year period that the Conservatives had held office.\n\nHarold Wilson was the Queen’s first non-Conservative Prime Minister, leading the country for two stints during her Majesty’s reign, from 1964-1970 and 1974-1976.\n\nIt is reported that the Queen and Wilson had a strong relationship. Historian Francis Beckett, writing for BBC History magazine, even went as far as to say \"after Churchill, Wilson may have been her favourite PM.\"\n\n6. Edward Heath 1970-1974\n\nBetween Wilson’s two periods of premiership came Conservative leader Edward Heath, who led a Conservative Government from 1970-1974.\n\nSir John Major, another of the Queen's Prime Ministers, once revealed that Edward Heath had fallen asleep during a dinner with Her Majesty. According to Major, the Queen took it very well, saying: \"he’ll wake up a little later and we’ll say nothing about it\".\n\n7. James Callaghan 1976-1979\n\nAlthough Harold Wilson once again took office in 1974, he resigned as Prime Minister two years later making way for James Callaghan, who took on the role as Labour leader, and therefore Prime Minister, in 1976.\n\nHe held office until 1979 when the Conservatives took hold of Government.\n\n8. Margaret Thatcher 1979-1990\n\nMargaret Thatcher became Prime Minister in 1979, making her the first woman to hold the role in Britain.\n\nHer premiership lasted from 1979-1990, making her the longest serving Prime Minister of the 20th century.\n\nIn 1986, following a front-page story in The Sunday Times titled \"Queen dismayed by 'uncaring' Thatcher\", the Palace released a statement dismissing the claims.\n\nThe statement read: \"As with all previous prime ministers, the queen enjoys a relationship of the closest confidentiality with Mrs. Thatcher and reports purporting to be the queen’s opinions of government policies are entirely without foundation.”\n\n9. John Major 1990-1997\n\nJohn Major succeeded Thatcher as both Conservative leader and Prime Minister in 1990, holding office for 7 years.\n\nHe once commented that his meetings with the Queen were completely private apart from her corgis who were often \"scattered around\" the room.\n\n10. Tony Blair 1997-2007\n\nIn 1997, the Labour party won in a landslide victory making Tony Blair Prime Minister. He was the youngest Prime Minister in the UK since 1812 and Labour Party’s longest serving Prime Minister.\n\nBlair has since spoken of his meetings with the Queen, stating that her \"accumulated amount of experience and knowledge is immense and very valuable for whoever in Prime Minister.\"\n\n11. Gordon Brown 2007-2010\n\nFollowing Tony Blair’s resignation in 2007, his Chancellor Gordon Brown took office as Prime Minister. He was Prime Minister during the 2008 economic crash.\n\nFollowing the death of the Duke of Edinburgh in April 2021, Gordon Brown said that when he used to ask the Queen about her husband, \"you could see her eyes light up, and how much this partnership mattered to her, how much this bond between them was so strong.\"\n\nHe went on to describe the Queen and Prince Philip as \"two great public servants who the country must be very grateful for\".\n\n12. David Cameron 2010-2016\n\n2010 saw the return of a Conservative Government, with David Cameron as Prime Minister serving for six years before stepping down following the 2016 Brexit referendum.\n\nHe has since said that he asked for the Queen's help before the Scottish independence referendum in 2014. On the subject, the Queen advised people to \"think very carefully about the future.\"\n\n13. Theresa May 2016-2019\n\nTheresa May took over from David Cameron in 2016, making her the second female Prime Minister of the UK.\n\nTheresa May was criticised for her curtsey technique in front of members of the Royal Family, which according to etiquette experts looked \"very awkward\" as she stooped \"so low\".\n\n14. Boris Johnson 2019-2022\n\nIn 2019, Theresa May resigned making way for former journalist and former Mayor of London, Boris Johnson.\n\nLess than a year into Johnson's premiership, the Covid-19 pandemic hit, causing mass distress across the nation. Johnson himself took ill with Covid-19 and spent time in intensive care at the height of the first wave of the pandemic.\n\nBoris Johnson was among the first to pay tribute to Prince Philip when he passed away aged 99 in April 2021.\n\n15. Liz Truss 2022-present\n\nAfter Boris Johnson resigned, Liz Truss went to Balmoral to visit the Queen in September 2022 and was asked to form a government.\n\nUsually, this ceremony happens at Buckingham Palace, but the Queen was advised to stay in Balmoral due to ongoing mobility issues.\n\nIt was one of the last official duties Her Majesty undertook.\n\nQueen Elizabeth - The longest serving UK Queen\n\nFirst for all the latest news from across the UK every hour on Hits Radio on DAB, at hitsradio.co.uk and on the Hits Radio app."
