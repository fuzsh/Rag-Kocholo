I hope you like it).\n\nOh, and she’s got a day job too. Because, well, bills.\n\nBut this, made my eyebrows stick to the top of my forehead.\n\nIt was a real mind-bender. It turned my stomach inside out and made me spit my morning brew all over my Mac’s screen.\n\nWhat on earth?\n\nWhere did this come from? How? Why? What? Too many questions going through my mind.\n\nIs this the real you, Eve, or is this the real price of fame?\n\nI’ve encountered many twists and turns throughout my blogging journey.\n\nA while back, I wrote an e-book. It was selling like sugar.\n\nUnfortunately, my delight didn’t last long. A clever individual took an interest, downloaded, copied, and replicated my content on an identical website, reaping all the financial rewards.\n\nThe alarm bells rang when my sales figures plummeted, and it wasn’t long before a fellow blogger alerted me. I was confused. Why me? How could anyone do such thing?\n\nI wondered.\n\nI learned a lesson that day. It was time to grow up.\n\nYou are writing on the internet, baby — a realm where no antivirus can protect you from the predators."
