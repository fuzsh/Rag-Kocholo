        "text": "1988\n\nCity Locations\n\nCentury City (USA), Los Angeles (USA)\n\nLocation Types\n\nFilm Studio, Unusual\n\nLocation Styles\n\nOffice Building Style, Muscle, Modern Building, Modern Car\n\nAbout Die Hard\n\nâDie Hardâ is a 1988 American action film directed by John McTiernan and written by Steven E. de Souza and Jeb Stuart. The story's foundation is rooted in the book Nothing Lasts Forever, which was written by Roderick Thorp in 1979. The movie features an ensemble cast, including Bruce Willis, Alexander Godunov, Alan Rickman, and Bonnie Bedelia, in leading roles, with supporting performances from Paul Gleason, Reginald VelJohnson, William Atherton, and Hart Bochner. John McClane, portrayed by Willis, is a detective based in New York City. When he visits his separated wife, who is at Nakatomi Tower in Los Angeles for a Christmas party, he gets caught up in a terrorist attack. Die Hard was not eagerly awaited during its initial release, and some marketing materials did not feature Willis's image, instead focusing on the setting's importance to McClane. The movie received mixed reviews upon its debut in July 1988, with critics praising McTiernan's direction and Rickman's performance as the villain Hans Gruber but criticizing the violent plot and Willis's acting. Despite these initial reactions, Die Hard became a massive success, grossing approximately $140 million at the box office and becoming the highest-grossing action film of the time and the tenth-highest-grossing film of the year. The movie also earned four Academy Award nominations, propelling Willis to leading-man status and launching Rickman's career as a celebrity. Today, the movie is often considered one of the greatest action films ever made, thanks to its innovative depiction of John McClane as a vulnerable and flawed hero that challenged the invincible hero tropes that were popular at the time. In addition to its innovative hero portrayal, the movie's themes, which include masculinity, gender roles, vengeance, and American concerns about foreign influences, have been thoroughly analyzed by critics in recent years.\n\nDie Hard Locations\n\nThe 1988 film Die Hard was entirely shot on location in and around Fox Plaza in Los Angeles. This iconic skyscraper is part of Century City, an area that has been the backdrop for countless Hollywood movies since the 1970s. This building stands out with its unique âXâ shape design, offering viewers an impressive skyline shot for the movie. Most of the filming occurred in and around this building, providing a realistic setting for Bruce Willis to save his wife from terrorists. Besides Fox Plaza, other locations used during production were the Wilshire Boulevard Theater (which served as the site of a hostage negotiation) and streets near Dodger Stadium (where McClane makes his daring escape). These areas contrast the sleek modernism of Fox Plaza, showing off both the urban and suburban sides of Los Angeles. Visiting these places today can still give you a great sense of what it was like when Die Hard was filmed. A trip to Fox Plaza is worthwhile as it offers breathtaking views of Los Angeles, and you can even get up close to the same glass windows that McClane jumped through! Strolling down Wilshire Boulevard Theater will also bring back memories from this classic action movie, while stopping by Dodger Stadium lets you relive the scene where McClane commandeers a car. Overall, visiting these locations will give fans of Die Hard an unforgettable experience as they explore different parts of LA that served as iconic settings for this beloved film.\n\nUpon arriving in Los Angeles, John McClane (Bruce Willis) heads to Nakatomi Plaza, where his wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) works, hoping to reconcile with her at the company Christmas party. He is dropped off by Argyle (De'voreaux White), a limo driver who offers to wait for him in the garage. While McClane changes clothes, a group of heavily armed terrorists led by German radical Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), including Karl (Alexander Godunov) and Theo (Clarence Gilyard), seize control of the building. One of Century City's most notable landmarks, 2121 Avenue of the Stars, is a prominent skyscraper designed by renowned architect Minoru Yamasaki and completed in 1969. The building's sleek and modern design, characterized by blue glass windows and a unique triangular shape, has made it an iconic feature of the city's skyline. Moreover, 2121 Avenue of the Stars is highly coveted at the heart of Century City, one of Los Angeles' most desirable business and residential areas. The building's prime location makes it easily accessible via various modes of transportation and offers convenient access to major freeways, public transportation, and the Los Angeles International Airport. If you prefer public transportation, you can take a bus or train to the nearby Westwood/Rancho Park station and then transfer to a local bus that stops near the building. Alternatively, you can take a taxi or ride-sharing service to get there.\n\nGruber (Alan Rickman) is pretending to be a terrorist to gain access to the $640 million in untraceable bearer bonds stored in the vault of Nakatomi Plaza. When executive Joseph Takagi (James Shigeta) refuses to reveal the access code, Gruber kills him and assigns Theo (Clarence Gilyard) to crack the vault's security. Meanwhile, McClane's (Bruce Willis) presence is detected, and Gruber sends one of his henchmen, Tony, to take care of him. This scene was filmed at The Fox Studio Lot. Initially known as the 20th Century Fox Studios, it is a historic movie studio complex in Century City, Los Angeles. The lot covers over 50 acres and is home to 15 soundstages, numerous production facilities, backlot sets, and other on-lot locations. The Fox Studio Lot was built in 1935 and has since been the site of countless iconic movies and TV shows. Some of the most notable productions filmed on the lot include \"Gone with the Wind,\" \"MAS*H,\" \"The Sound of Music,\" and \"The Simpsons,\" among many others. You can use GPS or a map to navigate the location if you drive. There are parking options available nearby, including street parking and parking garages.\n\nAfter conducting a thorough search of the Nakatomi Plaza, Sgt. Powell (Reginald VelJohnson) is ready to leave when he suddenly sees a terrorist's dead body falling from above and landing on his car. Shocked by this unexpected turn of events, Powell calls for backup, and a SWAT team rushes to the building to try to take control of the situation. However, their attempt is met with violent resistance from the terrorists holding everyone hostage. Located in the western part of Los Angeles, California, West Olympic Boulevard is a prominent street parallel to Santa Monica Boulevard. Over the years, it has become a popular destination for business and leisure activities. West Olympic Boulevard hosts several noteworthy occasions throughout the year. For instance, every June, the street serves as the venue for the LA Pride Parade, which draws large crowds from all over the world to celebrate and promote diversity and equality. You can use a map or GPS to navigate to the location if you are driving. Alternatively, hop onto bus number 7 and get off at the Pico WB and Kerwood NS stop. From there, you can walk for a few minutes to reach your destination.\n\nDie Hard is an iconic action-thriller that has become a Christmas classic. The movie was filmed almost entirely on location in and around Fox Plaza in Los Angeles. It is only fitting then that the main fight scene between McClane and the terrorists occurs on top of one of LAâs most famous skyscrapers. In addition, viewers are also treated to several other memorable locations, including an airport terminal, nearby roads and buildings, an underground parking lot, and even inside an elevator shaft! With its combination of gritty action sequences and engaging characters, Die Hard has secured its place as one of the greatest action films ever made."
