        "text": "Tommy Fleetwood is one of the world's best players, and one of the best ball strikers, too - which he illustrated in a viral TaylorMade video earlier this week where he was seen demonstrating a plethora of different shots with his fairway wood.\n\nThe Englishman, however, won't be playing this weekend after a card-wrecking 10 on the par 5 6th hole at Bay Hill ensures he'll be one of the players to miss the Arnold Palmer Invitational cut.\n\nFleetwood's 10 started in good fashion, with a 318 yard drive but he required nine more shots after sending three balls left into the water.\n\nBy the time he reached for his fourth ball, the Ryder Cup star was playing his eighth shot and it ended up being a beauty. From 202 yards he struck it to within 25ft to set up a chance for nine, which he two-putted for a dreaded 10.\n\nIt dropped him well down the leaderboard after a poor start that included three bogeys in his first five holes. He turned in 45 (+9) after another dropped shot at the ninth.\n\nHis 10 is nowhere near the highest score recorded on the hole, after John Daly's infamous 18 on the par 5 back in 1998, where he hit six balls into the lake.\n\nFleetwood has had a brilliant opening to 2024, having started with a victory at the Dubai Invitational where he birdied the 72nd hole to pip Rory McIlroy. He was also T10th at the Genesis Invitational and T14th at the Dubai Desert Classic.\n\nGet the Golf Monthly Newsletter\n\nSubscribe to the Golf Monthly newsletter to stay up to date with all the latest tour news, equipment news, reviews, head-to-heads and buyerâ€™s guides from our team of experienced experts.\n\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThe World No.12's next start will be at TPC Sawgrass in the Players Championship, where he was T5th in 2019.\n\nWatch: Tommy Fleetwood's ball striking prowess in TaylorMade video -\n\nElliott Heath is our News Editor and has been with Golf Monthly since early 2016 after graduating with a degree in Sports Journalism.

He has been obsessed with the sport since the age of 8 and currently plays off of a six handicap. His golfing highlights are making albatross on the 9th hole on the Hotchkin Course at Woodhall Spa, shooting an under-par round, playing in the Aramco Team Series on the Ladies European Tour and making his one and only hole-in-one at the age of 15 - a long time ago now!\n\nElliott is currently playing:\n\nDriver: Titleist TSR4\n\n3 wood: Titleist TSi2\n\nHybrids: Titleist 816 H1\n\nIrons: Mizuno MP5 5-PW\n\nWedges: Cleveland RTX ZipCore 50, 54, 58\n\nPutter: Odyssey White Hot OG #5\n\nBall: Srixon Z Star XV"
