        "text": "Ron Arnold (Deceased)\n\nCredentials\n\n“2 years transfer credits and alumni staud, Business Administration” — University of Washington (1958 – 1962).\n\n“2 years 1954-1956, transferable credits to University of Washington” — The University of Texas as Austin (1954 – 1956).\n\nBackground\n\nRon Arnold has been called “the father of the Wise Use movement,” and also claimed credit for coining the term “eco-terrorism.” He worked as the Executive Vice President of the the Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise (CDFE), alongside the group’s President Alan Gottlieb. Arnold proclaimed himself the “Darth Vader for the capitalist revolution.” Ron Arnold passed away on January 24, 2022.\n\nArnold was the first president of the American Freedom Coalition (AFC) from 1989 to 1991, a group that reportedly acted as the political arm of the Reverend Sun Myung Moon‘s Unification Church. Arnold served as president for three years at AFC, and Alan Gottlieb was a director for two. The American Freedom Coalition shared offices and staff with CDFE.\n\nArnold, while working at CDFE, has declared his goal is “to eradicate the environmental movement.” Apart from ExxonMobil, which provided at least $290,000, one of CDFE‘s largest funders is the Mercer Family Foundation. The foundation controlled by Rebekah Mercer (daughter of hedge fund manager Robert Mercer) contributed total of $800,000 between 2013 and 2014, Newsweek reported.\n\nDocuments on file at Polluterwatch note that, in 1990, Arnold and Gottlieb created another organization called “Earth Citizens Alliance for Resources and the Environment” with the stated goal to “educate the public about the wise use of resources” according to documents from Washington Secretary of State. Earth Citizens shared offices with CDFE at the Gottlieb-owned “Liberty Park” building at 12520 NE 10th Place, Bellevue, WA.\n\nAccording to a 1991 New York Times article by Timothy Egan, Ron Arnold received $3,000 per day as a speaker or organizer of groups combating environmentalists, while public 990 forms for the CDFE list no compensation for Arnold.\n\n“Wise Use” Movement\n\nCommon Dreams reported that Ron Arnold likely appropriated the term “Wise Use” from Gifford Pinchot, the first chief of the U.S. Forest Service, who is quoted as saying “Conservation is the wise use of resources.” Arnold used the term during a multiple use strategy conference in Reno, Nev., where he suggested that “wholesale mining, logging and grazing are possible while simultaneously preserving the land.”\n\nRon Arnold helped organize the 1988 founding conference of the Wise Use movement in Reno, Nevada, where he also published the “Wise-Use Agenda.” Some of The Agenda’s top 25 goals included:\n\nClear Cutting old-growth in national forests\n\nRewriting the Endangered Species Act to delist “non-adaptive species” such as the California condor\n\nImmediately start drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge\n\nOpen all public lands, including national parks and wilderness areas, to mining and oil exploration\n\nAccording to the Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise, Arnold also wrote an essay that was “the seminal expression of the ideas that have evolved into the richly diverse wise use movement.”\n\nIn 1991, Ron Arnold told Outside magazine that he picked the term “Wise Use” because it was ambiguous and fit neatly in newspaper headlines. “Facts don’t matter; in politics perception is reality,” Arnold said.\n\nArnold has said the goal of wise use is to “destroy environmentalism once and for all.” He was quoted in a fall 1992 interview with Common Ground of Puget Sound:\n\n“The goal of the Wise Use movement is very clear. Referring to environmentalists, Arnold explains, ‘We’re out to kill the fuckers. We’re simply trying to eliminate them. Our goal is to destroy environmentalism once and for all.’”\n\n“Wise Use”, CDFE and the Unification Church\n\nSource: Walter Hatch, “Big Names Lend Luster to Group’s Causes: Church Leader Gains Legitimacy Among U.S. Conservatives,” The Seattle Times, February 13, 1989. Reprinted in ”SHARE GROUPS IN BRITISH COLUMBIA.”\n\nNumerous investigative newspaper accounts from the late 1980s linked the Wise Use movement to the Unification Church, a group run by Rev. Sun Myung Moon. The Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise shared offices and directors with the American Freedom Coalition (AFC), a group known as a front group for the Unification Church.\n\nAFC received at least five million dollars from the church, as the national president and founder Robert Grant admitted in a Washington Post article. Grant said the church had donated a third of the group’s $17 million budget since its founding, and also noted that “Unification church members paid by a church organization, make up more than half of the AFC‘s staff.”\n\nThe Seattle Times described the American Freedom Coalition as a “marriage of the Unification Church and Christian Voice,” pointing to ACU leader Gary Jarmin who also helped run Christian Voice and its PAC, Moral Government Fund. The Times listed Arnold and Gottlieb as two of seven key people in the Unification Church in the Northwest. The network was reportedly headed by Matthew Morrison, a regional coordinator for AFC and church member, who at the time rented an office space from Gottlieb in Bellevue, Washington. Arnold was a member of the speaker’s bureau of CAUSA (Confederation of Associations for the Unification of Societies of the Americas), formerly the political action arm of the Unification Church.\n\nArnold has denied any connection between Moonie’s church and the Multi Use Conference in Reno, and has said “I am not a Moonie.” He added that CDFE does not receive funding from the Unification Church. “We never get a dime,” he said. At first he claimed that “The Unification Church has no connection to the Centre whatsoever,” then clarified that “The Centre for the Defence of Free Enterprise is allied in a movement (with the Unification Church) but has no affiliation with it in terms of money exchange.”\n\nInfluence on Canadian “Share” Groups\n\nArnold spent several years touring North America where he set up “community” coalitions, many of which used the word “care” or “share” in their names. He has advised the B.C. forestry industry. According to one report, many share groups in British Columbia originated from Arnold’s “Wise Use” movement in the U.S. The original Wise Use Conference in Nevada included a range of affiliate groups from British Columbia, including several representing the forestry, mining, and logging industries.\n\n“Ron Arnold and the Wise Use movement have been credited as having done more than counsel and organize Share Groups in B . C .; they have evidently influenced the rhetoric and vocabulary used in the resource debate, as seen in the use of words and phrases such as ‘archetypal symbolism,’ ‘unfinishable agenda,’ ‘wise use,’ ‘multiple use,’ ‘sharing[…],” The report noted.\n\nStance on Climate Change\n\nMay, 2015\n\nIn a 2015 Canada Free Press article, Arnold argued that “President Obama had it all wrong” when he said climate change deniers are a threat to national security. Arnold wrote:\n\n“In fact, climate change true believers are the real threat to our national security. That includes the notorious Seattle mob of Greenpeace ‘kayaktivists’ who were recently paddling around Puget Sound, in kayaks made from petroleum, trying to stop Shell Oil’s Polar Pioneer Arctic drilling rig from making a layover at the Port of Seattle to gear up for Alaskan waters.”\n\nDecember 21, 1991\n\nThe following is from a 1991 interview of Ron Arnold at the Toronto Star:\n\n“If chlorflourocarbons really destroy ozone, why isn’t there a hole over chlorflourocarbon factories? As for the greenhouse effect, he was emphatic. ‘There isn’t any such thing’.”\n\nKey Quotes\n\nMay, 2004\n\nIn a 2004 interview with Playboy magazine, Ron Arnold outlined some of the ideas behind the “wise use” movement. He told Playboy about a “list of demands” he had made at a 1988 meeting in Reno:\n\n“Number one was educate the public about the use of natural resources. Immediately develop petroleum resources in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Cut down remaining old-growth forests on public lands and replace with new trees. Cut down 30,000 acres of the Tongass National Forest each year to promote economic forestry practices. Open all public lands, including national parks, to mining and oil drilling. Construct roads into all wilderness areas for motorized wheel chair use. Stop protecting endangered species, such as the California condor, that were in decline before man arrived. Force anyone who loses litigation against a development to pay for the increase in costs for completing the project, plus damages. But the idea of wise use has become embedded. It’s no longer a list like that.”\n\nDuring the interview, Arnold also described the original idea behind the “Wise Use” movement:\n\n“To renew the conservation movement of President Teddy Roosevelt and his sidekick, Forest Service chief Gifford Pinchot. Pinchot once said that conservation is the wise use of resources. It’s an attempt to revitalize the conservation movement against the ‘don’t use it at all’ thinking that has evolved in environmentalism.”\n\nJune 20, 1993\n\nArnold was quoted in a 1993 Washington Times article:\n\n“Since the Democrats got into power, our income has doubled.”\n\nMay 30, 1993\n\nThe following is from a May, 1993 interview with Ron Arnold at CNN:\n\nVOICE OVER: “Arnold’s followers consider this a battle for personal freedom.”\n\nARNOLD: “And that sword has two purposes: to carve out a niche for your agenda, to reshape the American law in your image; and, kill the bastards.”\n\nINTERVIEWER: “Describe yourself as you would like others to think of you.”\n\nARNOLD: “As I would like others to think? People in industry, I’m going to do my best for you. Environmentalists, I’m coming to get you.”\n\n1992\n\nHe was quoted in a fall 1992 interview with Common Ground of Puget Sound:\n\n“The goal of the Wise Use movement is very clear. Referring to environmentalists, Arnold explains, ‘We’re out to kill the fuckers. We’re simply trying to eliminate them. Our goal is to destroy environmentalism once and for all.’”\n\nFebruary 4, 1992\n\nIn an ABC New Nightline show, Ron Arnold was quoted:\n\n“The environmental movement is the establishment now, and now we are the rebels coming to tear them down. Now they’re Goliath, and we’re David, and we intend to put the stone in their head.”\n\nJanuary 13, 1992\n\nArnold was quoted in a 1992 Boston Globe article by Marla Williams, as reported by SourceWatch.\n\n“We are sick to death of environmentalism and so we will destroy it. We will not allow our right to own property and use nature’s resources for the benefit of mankind to be stripped from us by a bunch of eco-facists.”\n\nDecember 21, 1991\n\nIn a 1991 interview with Toronto Star reporter Katherine Long, as reported by SourceWatch, Arnold said:\n\n“Our goal is to destroy, to eradicate the environmental movement […] We’re mad as hell. We’re not going to take it anymore. We’re dead serious – we’re going to destroy them,” he said. “We want to be able to exploit the environment for private gain, absolutely […] and we want people to understand that is a noble goal.”\n\nLong added that he didn’t believe in the greenhouse effect.\n\n“If chlorflourocarbons really destroy ozone, why isn’t there a hole over chlorflourocarbon factories? As for the greenhouse effect, he was emphatic. ‘There isn’t any such thing’.”\n\nDecember 19, 1991\n\nIn a 1991 New York Times article by Timothy Egan, Arnold is quoted as saying:\n\n“We want to destroy environmentalists by taking away their money and their members.”\n\n“We [CDFE] created a sector of public opinion that didn’t used to exist. No one was aware that environmentalism was a problem until we came along.”\n\nDecember, 1991\n\nAccording to a profile Outside Magazine, Arnold has said:\n\n“Facts don’t matter; in politics perception is reality.”\n\nArnold also claimed, at a speech at the New Mexico Wool Growers Association at the Las Cruces Hilton:\n\n“[G]reen organizations aren’t really concerned about protecting the environment; they simply ‘invent the environmental threats in order to recruit members and make money.’”\n\n1991\n\nAs reported by The New York Times, Arnold said in a speech to a group of New Mexico wool growers in 1991:\n\n“Environmentalism is a new paganism that worships trees and sacrifices people.”\n\nKey Deeds\n\nMarch 28, 2018\n\nPaul Driessen and Ron Arnold co-published the second edition of their book, Cracking Big Green: To Save the World from the Save-The-Earth Money Machine.\n\nThe book bills itself as “A stunning expose of Big Green – the modern environmental movement and its hidden financial masters.”\n\nThe first version of their book, bearing the same title, was published in 2014 by the pro-fossil-fuel, climate change denial organization CFACT.\n\nApril 10, 2017\n\nWriting at the Washington Examiner, Ron Arnold promotes a Pacific Legal Foundation petition that describes the listing of Preble’s meadow jumping mouse from the “threatened” list of the Endangered Species Act.\n\n“The Endangered Species Act does not regulate species but habitat, which is land-use control,” Arnold wrote. “The Fish and Wildlife Service uses its power to separate land from use.\n\n“The Endangered Species Act does not regulate species but habitat, which is land-use control. The Fish and Wildlife Service uses its power to separate land from use.\n\nJuly 7 – 9, 2014\n\nArnold was a speaker at the Heartland Institute‘s Ninth International Conference on Climate Change (ICCC9).\n\nApril, 2004\n\nThe “Earth Day Information Center,” a project of the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), listed Ron Arnold as a public policy expert available for interview.\n\n“Arnold is an expert in eco-terrorism, the funding of the establishment environmental movement, the Endangered Species Act, federal land management and property rights,” the website declared.\n\nOther “experts” listed included Patrick Michaels, Henry Miller of the Hoover Institution, Steven Hayward of the Pacific Research Institute, and Margo Thorning of the American Council for Capital Formation.\n\nFebruary 15, 2000\n\nAfter publishing a book titled Undue Influence: Wealthy Foundations, Grant-Driven Environmental Groups, and Zealous Bureaucrats That Control Your Future with CDFE, Ron Arnold testified before the U. S. House of Representatives, Committee on Resources, Subcommittee on Forests and Forest Health.\n\nIn his testimony, Arnold promoted the message of the book and claimed there is a “powerful ‘iron triangle’” of environmental groups and funding that “unfairly influences federal policy to devastate local economies and private property.”\n\n“Madam Chairman, in my researches I found that every segment of America’s resource extraction economy – food, clothing and shelter – has been targeted by some coalition funded by wealthy foundations. This is an intolerable program of rural cleansing,” Arnold said.\n\n1993\n\nIn 1993, Arnold and Gottlieb issued a new Wise Use publication titled Trashing the Economy, subtitled “How Runaway Environmentalism is Wrecking America. It was published by Free Enterprise Press and distributed by Merril Press, the latter run by Gottlieb.\n\nAccording to the book’s forward, it served as a catalogue of the “secrets the environmental movement does not want the public to know.” Ron Arnold claimed that “every sentence” had been checked for source and accuracy.\n\nAugust, 1988\n\nThe Wise Use Movement was unveiled at The Multiple-Use Strategy Conference at the Nugget casino hotel near Reno, Nevada. According to an October, 1994 report in Eastsideweek, the conference was a meeting place to determine a common ground to fight environmentalism. 250 delegates were invited, representing industry and lobbyists.\n\nCompanies included The American Mining Congress, the National Cattlemen’s Association, the DuPont Co., Exxon Co., USA, Louisiana Pacific Corporation, Northwest Independent Forest Manufacturers, Willamette Forestry Council, and Timber Association of California.\n\nEastSidweek reported that “There was a sufficient sprinkling of small grass-roots organizations names in the roster to provide some cover, though very few of the small groups listed in the conference report actually attended. This would become the familiar trade-mark of Wise Use: little guys carrying the banner for the big boys”:\n\n“The lobbyists, promoters, flacks and ‘leaders’ were industry supporters like Gottlieb and Arnold with CDFEPLUS\n\n“The little guys were represented in the ‘Index to the Wise Use Movement’ by property owners associations and recreational clubs such as Bremerton Cruisers, Eastern Washington Dirt Riders, Roadrunners Motorcycle Club, Skagit Motorcycle Club, Tacoma Motorcycle Club, the Idaho Gem and Mineral Society, the Magic Valley Trail Machine Association, the Arizona Bowhunters’ Association, and the Yakima Valley Dust Dodgers. Most of the organizations listed did not attend, but rather “supported the Wise Use Movement” through their participation in umbrella organizations like the Blue Ribbon Coalition or the Public Land Users Society. It is questionable if the members of these organizations approved of, or even knew what the Wise Use Movement is all about. These are the spear carriers, the foot soldiers, the grass-roots. The ones who send Gottlieb money in the mail.\n\n“There was also one other sponsor that has garnered a lot of attention: the American Freedom Coalition.”\n\nA key document to the newly dubbed “Wise Use Movement” would be The Wise Use Agenda, The Citizen’s Policy Guide to Environmental Resource Issues, A Task Force Report to the Bush Administration by the Wise Use Movement.\n\nThe agenda outlined a number of the “two hundred twenty-four citizen organizations government agencies and individuals” who attended the Multiple Use Strategy Conference. View the attached spreadsheet for a complete list of the “Index of the Wise Use Movement” (xlsx). Notable Groups included:\n\nConsumer Alert\n\nGeorgia Pacific Corp.\n\nPacific Legal Foundation\n\nExxon Company, USA\n\nMountain States Legal Foundation\n\nAccuracy in Academia\n\nCompetitive Enterprise Institute\n\nNational Rifle Association\n\nBlue Ribbon Coalition Inc\n\nNational Council for Environmental Balance\n\nBoise Cascade Corporation\n\nOregonians for Food and Shelter\n\nJames D. Peterson\n\nCenter for the Defense of Free Enterprise\n\n1986\n\nArnold visited New Zealand, sponsored by the Agricultural Chemical and Animal Remedies Manufactuers, where he described himself as the the “Darth Vader for the capitalist revolution.” He defended the use of herbicides that had been identified with the dioxin 2,4,5-T while warning that the US had experienced an “upsurge in eco-terrorism.”\n\nHe was quoted in The New Zealand Herald:\n\n“We have had power stations blown up, bridges burned, electrical transmission towers collapsed, forest trails booby trapped with wired shotguns, attacks on forestry pesticide application crews, Forest Service officers shot to death and numerous other acts of violence in the name of the environment.”\n\nAccording to ScienceCorruption, Arnold was later asked to cite the sources for these statements. When asked, he pointed to a government report and claimed the incident happened in Southern Oregon regarding a marijuana patch. Regarding the tie to environmentalism, he referred to one of his own articles in a conservative magazine. The article had no connection to either marijuana or to Southern Oregon.\n\nMarch, 1985\n\nRon Arnold gave a speech at a conference sponsored by the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association where he described his experience fighting the anti-pesticide movement. According to Arnold, a “small but vociferous minority in North America” was opposing “the use of vital agrichemicals.” He claimed that this movement constituted “less than 2% of the entire North American population.”\n\nHe concluded his speech, saying environmentalists were “not likely to abandon their ideology because they hold their misguided beliefs with religious fervor.”\n\nFebruary, 1983\n\nBefore he joined the Center for Defense of Free Enterprise, Arnold wrote a piece on “Eco-Terrorism” at Reason Magazine.\n\nResponding to a September 2007 Indypendant article on the origins of the word “Eco-Terrorism,” Arnold claimed credit for coining the term “eco-terrorism” in his initial Reason Magazine. Arnold’s comment below:\n\nRon Arnold Says:\n\nSeptember 17th, 2007 at 5:20 pm\n\nI coined the term “ecoterrorism” in a 1982 Reason magazine article. Denson borrowed it late in the game after many other uses. I want the credit and you want to get it right. When you write about me, call me at 425-454-9470. It’s a common journalistic courtesy, I answer most questions, and I don’t bite. My 1997 book “EcoTerror: The Violent Agenda to Save Nature” was voted into the Random House Reader Survey of the 100 Most Important Books of the 20th Century. I left this message at your website contact email. Please let your readers know about the REAL birth of the buzzword. I’ll tell you the whole story if you’re interested.\n\nRon Arnold\n\n1981\n\nArnold co-authored At the Eye of the Storm, a biography of the new Reagan Secretary of the Interior, James Watt which Watt himself helped to edit.
