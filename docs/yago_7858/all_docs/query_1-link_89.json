        "text": "More often than not, it is a common occurrence that actors like to take souvenirs to keep them as a memory. Such souvenirs translate into the time spent at a particular set while filming for a specific scene or movie. Whether it is Daniel Radcliffe taking home the Harry Potter glasses or Ryan Reynolds keeping his Deadpool costume, it is only natural for actors to confide in a souvenir to treasure their emotions somewhere. Legendary bodybuilder-turned-actor Arnold Schwarzenegger is no different.\n\nOne of his movie producers once revealed that Arnold Schwarzenegger made a peculiar deal to hold on to one of his costumes. As Schwarzenegger was not allowed to take it home forever, he decided it rent it instead. But which one of his costumes was it? Is it from his iconic movie Terminator, or something else?\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger struck a deal for a costume\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nIn June 2015, British film producer Peter MacGregor-Scott appeared in an interview with the Hollywood Reporters. Herein, while talking about the movie, Batman & Robin, McGregor-Scott revealed how Arnold Schwarzenegger wanted to take Mr. Freeze’s costume from the set. However, when he couldn’t convince the management to let him have it, he struck a deal to rent it instead.\n\nExplaining the ordeal to Hollywood Reporters, Peter MacGregor-Scott said, “Arnold Schwarzenegger wanted a costume of Mr. Freeze. It went all the way up to the top of the studio. He had to sign a contract, and I think he pays $1 per year to borrow the costume. The lights in those costumes last 9,000 hours. He doesn’t have them on all day long, but he does turn them on quite frequently.”\n\nRead More: Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Co-Star in Netflix Spy Series Reveals Nerve-Wrecking Moment While Strapped Up With the Terminator: “He Smelled It on Me”\n\nWhile no one else was allowed to take something from the set, the villain of the movie eventually got what he wanted. This isn’t the only instance related to this movie when the management seemed to have favored Schwarzenegger more than the rest.\n\nWhen the villain earned more than the hero\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nIn one of his interviews, George Clooney revealed that Schwarzenegger was paid several times more than he was. According to Clooney, Arnold Schwarzenegger was paid a whopping $25 million for the 1997 movie. He claimed this amount was 20x more than what he had earned from the said film.\n\nAlthough the two veteran actors acted in the same film, they did not work together for more than a day. Since the movie did not perform as well as it was expected to, Coolney received the most criticism. However, the veteran actor is not bitter about it. In fact, he believes neither his acting nor the script was up to the mark.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nWatch This Story: Arnold Schwarzenegger vs Andre The Giant: Who Is Stronger?\n\nThis was another one of the many instances where Schwarzenegger charmed his way into making things work for him.
