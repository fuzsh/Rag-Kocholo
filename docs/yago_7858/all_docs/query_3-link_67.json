        "meta_description": "Presented by the Alamo Drafthouse and recorded live from The Regent Theater in Downtown Los Angeles, Matt speaks with screenwriter Steven de Souza about the 1987 film The Running Man and 1988 film Die Hard. Steven lays urban myths to rest and goes in depth about both films including the unavoidable political aspects of the now 30 year old film The Running Man compared to today’s political climate and the ever changing script almost down to the wire of Die Hard. Plus, we hear a bit how the cult classic Hudson Hawk become what it is thanks to Bruce Willis’ input. This episode is brought to you by Mack Weldon (www.mackweldon.com code: WASTHERE) and Hullo (www.hullopillow.com/IWTT).",
