        "text": "A former Nottinghamshire church saved from the wrecking ball by councillors is once again set for demolition.\n\nNew homes were proposed at the site of the disused Beacon Baptist Church in Arnold, but Gedling Borough Council blocked plans in April 2023 saying it would be a \"travesty\".\n\nHowever, following a successful appeal, applicants Direct Land Investment can now knock the church down.\n\nIn its place it plans to build two detached and six semi-detached houses.\n\nThe building had closed due to water damage and the discovery of asbestos inside, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.\n\nA total of 193 people signed a petition to save the facility, which previously hosted an after-school club, a jobs club and a Christmas fair.\n\nThe planning committee felt a new community centre for the area, rather than housing, would be a more appropriate use of the Killisick Road site.\n\nBut the Planning Inspectorate sided with the applicant, saying there were two other Baptist churches in nearby Daybrook and Mapperley that could play the same role.\n\nIt added: \"Given the length of time that the premises have been closed, any parishioners have made alternative arrangements where necessary, so there is no need for replacement premises to be provided.\"\n\nThe building was listed as an Asset of Community Value in 2021, allowing community groups the opportunity to express an interest in - however no firm offer has ever been made on the deteriorating building.\n\n'Desperate need'\n\nCouncillor Henry Wheeler said at the 2023 planning meeting: \"It would be a travesty to see this turned into residential development.\n\n\"I am all for the building being demolished but I would like to see it replaced with a new community hub.\n\n\"There's a desperate need in that area. That site has so much potential.\"\n\nThe recent decision by the Planning Inspectorate is due to be discussed at the planning committee on Wednesday."
