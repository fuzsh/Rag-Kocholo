Click here to see where we sit amongst the best!\n\nThank you, thank you, thank you for the continued support, and expect great food, drink, and festivals from us for years to come.\n\nToday's Beer\n\nA Cold IPA is an IPA brewed with a lager yeast at colder temperatures, creating a crisp, drinkable yet generously hopped India Pale “Ale.” We brewed this beer using 5 different forms of the American grown Chinook hop. Chinook CO2 extract, INCOGNITO, Whole Leaf, Pellets and Cryo Pellets all went into this bitter and refreshing IPA. An intense piney/resinous bitterness that is followed by notes of soft tropical fruit and citrus dankness. Brewed with our friends at Crooked Culture Brewing. Tap date 5/18 16.1°P ABV 6.8%\n\nEnglish Bitter is often overlooked as a style in modern craft beer circles. As such, we decided to brew one as it is a quintessential session beer. Light amber in color, ours has a unique balance of caramel and toasty malt, esters reminiscent of orchard fruit, and a firm hop bitterness. Being true to style, we are serving this beer at a lower level of carbonation to make it as quaffable as possible Tap Date 5/25 OG 1.039 IBU 35 ABV 3.9%\n\nThis new batch of Juice Willis is hopped with Australia Vic Secret, American Equanot, Mosaic and Mosaic INCOGNITO. We utilized biotransformation technique in the brewing process to fully showcase the hop aromas and flavors. Expect intense dank pineapple, blueberry, passionfruit, and refreshing pine and citrus aroma! Tap Date 5/15 13.6°P IBU 60 ABV 6.5%\n\nA Scottish Light carries very similar characteristics to that of a Wee Heavy, just not as big or as bold. Our version uses a hefty amount of Briess Extra Special Roast malt which carries dominant notes of wood, burnt caramel sugar, toast marshmallow, and dry raisins. Moderately hopped and low ABV makes this beer crushable! Tap Date 3/12 10.2°P IBU 18 ABV 3.4%\n\nThe \"beautiful house\" is back! This beer features a combination of Pilsner and Heritage malts as well as Malted Corn from Riverbend Malt in NC, providing notes of toasted bread, soft caramel, and a subtle graininess. A healthy addition of Czech Saaz hops rounds out this thirst-quenching concoction designed to help you beat the heat! Tap Date 11.16 OG 1.049 IBU 20 ABV 5.1%\n\nBrewed with 666lb of malt, this is one hell of a glass of beer! We boiled this beer for 3 hours with the addition of 20 pounds of molasses to achieve a very smooth and pleasant mid palate beer that finishes rich and malty yet not overtly sweet. Moderately hopped to help balance the large complex malt flavors of gooey caramel, burnt sugar, molasses, and dark fruit. A strong beer drinkers must try!! Tap Date 1/19 25°P IBU 38 ABV 10.5%\n\nOur house gose, soured with yogurt then salted with a blend of sea salts we've perfected with our friends over at Beautiful Briny Sea in Grant Park. The beer was then dosed with Thai and sweet basil, fermented on grapefruit juice and pulp, and aged on grapefruit zest. Tap Date 9/20 OG 1.044 IBU. 5 ABV 4.5%\n\nOur take on a traditional Vienna-Style lager. Brewed with a blend of Vienna, Munich, Pilsner, and CaraAmber malts, expect a toasty and dry lager base with a subtle caramel finish. A smooth noble hop bitterness provides contrast to the malt base. A beer meant to be enjoyed at any occasion. Easy enough for new beer drinkers, yet complex enough to please every palate. Tap date 11/20 OG 1.054 IBU 30 ABV 5.6%\n\nFor those that want a beer with complex malt flavors, without the extra roastiness of a stout, our Oatmeal Porter is your beer. This Porter contains prominent notes of chocolate, biscuits, and dark fruit and is smoothed out by a big portion of flaked oats, with just enough English hops to balance. Tap Date 1/10 OG 1.056 IBU 30 ABV 5.2%\n\nThis is a very delightful and funky American Farmhouse Ale that is fermented with Brettanomyces. We used barley, wheat, rye, and oats for a simple malt bill to help the unique fermentation characteristics shine. Earthy, funk, acid, grain, hay, and bright plum fruit are the many flavors derived from this mixed-fermentation ale. Cheers! Tap Date 4/6 11.8 °P IBU 24 ABV 4.9%\n\nDance for the arrival of Spring. Breath deep the green. Hear the buzzing of bees. Celebrate the end of death, greet life with open arms! Maibock is a beer for celebration and renewal. Have a sip, or a hearty draught, let its warm bready malt notes revive you. Delight in its floral and vinous hop tones. Drink and enjoy. Prost! Tap Date 5/1 OG 1.069, IBU 29, ABV 7.5%\n\nCzech Pilsner-the King of Pilsners! Inspired by our brewer's favorite beer, Pilsner Urquell, this pilsner is the perfect example of a Czech Premium Pale Lager. Rich, complex, bready malt flavors combined with spicy Czech Saaz hops to bring you a true Bohemian Pilsner experience! Tap Date 8/5 11.5°P IBU 42 ABV 4.6%\n\nThis is a classic IPA using English pale malted barley. The sole hop used is New Zealand’s Nelson Sauvin, which flavor with an aroma of gooseberry, Sauvignon Blanc wine, and tropical fruits. Tap Date 3/14 12.5°P IBU 69 ABV 5.7%\n\nA traditional Munich Helles brewed with 100% Weyerman malts. This delicious lager has a subtle sweetness to it that is accompanied by a predominate malty flavor that exhibits toasted, bread-like characteristics. Hallertau Mittlefruh, Halleratua Hersbrucker, Tettnanger hops all play a small role in balancing this quaffable German Lager delight! Prost!. Tap Date 6/15 9.7 °P IBU 25 ABV 4.8%\n\nBEER\n\nBrewing on a 7 barrel system, Tim Schiavone runs a beer program that focuses on perfecting classic styles such as Helles, Pilsner, ESB, IPA, barrel aged strong beer and session styles. This classic list is balanced with more experimental styles: fruited gose’s and farmhouse ales, to name a few. Over the last seven years we’ve also developed a barrel aging program, aging stouts, barleywines, and scotch ales in bourbon and rum barrels to bring out the beers best characteristics, winning a Silver Medal in Barrel Aged Strong Ales at the Great American Beer Festival in 2018 for our Willett Bourbon Barrel Aged Ye Old Sprinklerhead Barleywine.\n\nFOOD\n\nOur Executive Chef, Matt Crutchfield, is bringing fresh farm-to-table flavors, while staying rooted in pub classics. We source from local bakeries, dairies, and farms, and believe it’s important to support the local economy and build relationships. The menu keeps a few classics on constantly, while the rest changes to reflect the season, highlighting produce and flavors at their peak.\n\nABOUT\n\nHoused in a late Victorian building that was once a home, a church, a dance studio, and an architectural salvage store, the Wrecking Bar Brewpub has worked to become a cornerstone of the neighborhood.

Kriegshaber House is historically significant for its association with Victor Hugo Kriegshaber, who was a leader in the cultural and economic development of Atlanta during the first third of the century, and the original owner of this house. He commissioned the building to be designed by architect Willis F. Danny just before 1900 and lived there with his family until 1924.The Kriegshaber residence is a fine example of Denny’s work; he practiced only a few years in Atlanta before his early death at 31 due to pneumonia, but managed to design many of the city’s most prestigious public and private structures before 1905. Stylistically, the house is a noteworthy transitional statement combining late Victorian and eclectic details.\n\nKriegshaber was born in 1859 to Prussian immigrants living in Louisville, Kentucky. He did not make his home in Atlanta until 1889, when he left his civil engineer’s position with the Central of Georgia Railway to become a contractor and soon after president for forty-three years of his own building materials supply company. Nine years after his arrival in Atlanta, Kriegshaber was able to afford his elegant showplace on the periphery of Inman Park. He served in executive positions for countless businesses, civic, philanthropic, and cultural organizations. In addition to his building material supply business, Kriegshaber was the founder and first president of the Atlanta Terra Cotta Company, a director of the Atlanta Art Glass Co. and vice-president of the National Builders’ Supply Association. He was a director of the Chamber of Commerce and, in 1914, was part of the committee from the Chamber that spearheaded the new development at Lakewood for the Southeastern Fair. The Fair opened in 1916, the same year that Kriegshaber served as president of the Chamber of Commerce.\n\nA charter member of the Rotary Club, Kriegshaber also served as director of the local council of the Boy Scouts of America, as president of the Jewish Charities and of the Jewish Educational Alliance and was director of the Hebrew Orphan’s Home. He was instrumental in establishing the city’s first public playgrounds for children and was later vice-president of the Playground Association of America. In 1905, Kriegshaber was one of the organizers of the Standard Club, serving as its first vice-president.\n\nKriegshaber served on the executive committee of the Atlanta Music Festival Association from its founding in 1909 until his death. The first Atlanta Music Festival, held in 1909 in the just completed Auditorium, was such a tremendous success that the Atlanta Music Festival Association inaugurated in 1910 the first of nearly twenty annual spring visits by the Metropolitan Opera to Atlanta’s Municipal Auditorium. In addition, his belief in the ability of local musicians and choristers led to the establishment of the Atlanta Philharmonic Society, of which he was president at his death in 1934.”\n\nWrecking Bar Brewpub\n\nTuesday - Thursday: 5 - 10 pm\n\nFriday: 12 - 11 pm\n\nSaturday: 12 - 11 pm\n\nSunday: 5 - 10 pm\n\nMonday: Closed\n\nContact us\n\ninfo@wreckingbarbrewpub.com\n\n292 Moreland Ave NE, Atlanta, GA 30307\n\n(404) 221-2600\n\nGift cards and merchandise now available to purchase online!\n\n© 2021 Wrecking Bar Brewpub\n\n[wpgmza id=\"1\"]"
