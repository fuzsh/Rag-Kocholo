        "text": "The American Heritage Dictionary defines jalopy as a word to describe an old, dilapidated motor vehicle especially an automobile. The origin of the word itself is hazy.\n\nThe Ultimate Hot Rod Dictionary goes further, suggesting the word may have come into being as a result of many dilapidated automobiles sent to the Mexican city of Jalapa. The second definition of the word is the very automobile seen here. Any rough, crudely constructed automobile used in circle track racing.\n\nThis car raced in Los Angeles area at tracks such as Gardena Stadium, Culver City and Ascot Park throughout the 1950's. For a time these races were televised. Drivers such as Parnelli Jones started their career in the Jalopies.\n\nâ€‹ This car features a 1932 Ford Sedan with a 221 c.i. Ford Flathead engine."
