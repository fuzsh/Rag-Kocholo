        "text": "\"Hudson Hawk,\" a $51 million action comedy starring Bruce Willis, produced by Joel Silver and filmed on locations ranging from the Brooklyn Bridge to Budapest, is either an example of free-spending folly or the kind of grand entertainment that will always be a part of Hollywood. It depends on whom you ask.\n\nEven at that lofty price, \"Hudson Hawk,\" which opened Friday to some unenthusiastic reviews, is not the costliest film of the summer. That honor belongs to the forthcoming \"Terminator 2,\" which, at $85 million, may well be the most expensive film ever made. That movies cost too much to make is an old story. But with budgets becoming alarmingly expensive, productions are being scrutinized as never before, both by industry executives and the public.\n\nFrom the start, \"Hudson Hawk,\" with its assortment of strange mechanical devices and global locations, resembled a Jules Verne novel more than a movie, says Daniel Waters, who shares the screenwriting credit with Steven E. de Souza. Plans called for filming in Rome, Budapest, London, New York and Los Angeles. The sheer logistics of transporting a film company around two continents, constructing elaborate props and executing exacting stunts and action sequences, including a chase on the Brooklyn Bridge and a flight in a Renaissance glider, dictated a costly undertaking.\n\nAdd a script that was constantly being rewritten, an inexperienced director who has said on record that he was often challenged by his high-priced star, and a producer with a reputation for extravagance, and the formula seems written for a film destined to exceed its budget.\n\nMr. Willis and Mr. Silver had teamed up twice before, to make \"Die Hard\" (1988) and the sequel, \"Die Hard 2\" (1990), which also ran over budget and wound up costing a reported $70 million. \"If you put Joel Silver at the helm of a movie, you know you're going to get a film made the Joel Silver way,\" says Michael Dryhurst, the co-producer of \"Hudson Hawk.\" \"And that's a large way.\"\n\nFilm making is neither an exact science nor a precise art. Rather, it is a process of assembling hundreds of elements in the hope that somehow they all fit together. But things invariably go wrong: actors leave, locations change, scripts are rewritten and budgets soar. In some ways, \"Hudson Hawk\" was no different from any other production, except that it came at a time when cost-consciousness was a major concern in the film industry.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
