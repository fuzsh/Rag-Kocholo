        "text": "Spirtas Wrecking Company begins demolition of Crossroads Mall in Omaha Nebraska for redevelopment\n\nSpirtas Wrecking Company is beginning the demolition of the old Crossroads Mall in Omaha Nebraska to clear way for redevelopment. Before commencing with any major work, our team coordinated with firefighters and other first responders to provide a scene for realistic emergency training. On December 9th, we began with the exterior demolition of the old Crossroads Mall as we tore down the old Sears Auto Center along Dodge Street. This made the local Omaha news, and the developers of the property joined Mayor Jean Stothert to mark the start of the demolition.\n\nSpirtas Wrecking Company awarded Specialty Contractor of the Year for Environmental Remediation and Demolition by Associated General Contractors of Missouri\n\nThe Associated General Contractors of Missouri (AGCMO) has named Spirtas Wrecking Corporation as its Specialty Contractor of the Year for Environmental Remediation and Demolition services. Spirtas was voted ‘First Place’ in this discipline by the General Contractor members of AGCMO, who were asked to consider their overall experience with Spirtas including timeliness in regard to completion of projects and ability to stay within budget. The awards program highlights the creativity and talents of Missouri’s construction industry.\n\nSpirtas Wrecking Company progressing with emergency stabilization at Lemp Brewery\n\nSpirtas Wrecking Company is progressing with stabilization and debris removal of one of the buildings at the Lemp Brewery complex that partially collapsed Sunday August 23. Spirtas starts all emergency work by having our in-house expert project managers assess the situation, and then the project manager devises a plan for stabilization and restoration of what can be retained and safe demolition of structures and building features that need to be removed. Mitigation of hazards drives the design of the plan. We are working with stakeholders and City officials to ensure the safest and most expedient process.\n\nSpirtas Wrecking Company’s mug was in the movie Mr. and Mrs. Smith!\n\nThis is an interview with Arnold Spirtas concerning the use of a Spirtas Wrecking Company's mug in the movie Mr. and Mrs. Smith which starred Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Spirtas Wrecking was founded in 1954 as a local St. Louis dismantling and hauling company by Joe Spirtas. Still based in St. Louis Missouri, Spirtas Wrecking is proud to serve the Midwest and North America.\n\nSatisfying Multiple Stakeholders – Demolition as Part of Property Transfer and Remediation\n\nDemolition contractors fill the needs of all classes of property owners, helping these owners to ready their properties for reuse. Demolition contractors work with governmental clients to clear obsolete infrastructure, institutions to ready their campuses for new facilities, and commercial enterprises to reposition and redevelop their properties. SPIRTAS WRECKING CO. of St. Louis, MO, has met client needs for all of these kinds of projects."
