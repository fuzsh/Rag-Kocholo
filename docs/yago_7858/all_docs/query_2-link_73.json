        "text": "luv’s 420 joint\n\nwhen dj luv’s records started i had the idea of making a mixtape dedicated to marijuana. every mix up here was made in a haze of pot smoke so it was inevitable that time and inspiration would coalesce into luv’s 420 joint. an epic journey that crosses many genres and eras exhibiting how this glorious weed is for everyone and all can reap it’s benefits. to quote Louis Armstrong :\n\n“We did call ourselves Vipers, which could have been anybody from all walks of life that smoked and respected ‘gage’. That was our cute little name for marijuana… We always looked at pot as a sort of medicine, a cheap drunk and with much better thoughts than one that’s full of liquor… the respect for it (gage) will stay with me forever. I have every reason to say these words and am proud to say them. From experience.”\n\nso from one viper to another, happy 4/20. now take a hit off luv’s 420 joint.\n\nimage : Don Willis on weed\n\nTracklist:\n\nexcerpt from The History Of Marijuana : A Child’s Garden Of Grass (A Pre-Legalization Comedy) – Ron Jacobs – Elektra (1971)\n\nI’m Gonna Get High – Tampa Red and The Chicago Five – Bluebird / Stash Records Inc.
