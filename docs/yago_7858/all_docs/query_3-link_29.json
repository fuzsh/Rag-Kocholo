        "text": "Once again Matt has lovingly pieced together a collection of the best anecdotes told on I Was There Too about experiences on the set of the Star Wars trilogy, Back to The Future, Die Hard, and many more. You’ll hear from Steven de Souza, Tom Wilson, Lauren Lapkus, Ahmed Best, Jimmy Pardo, and more on topics ranging from beating Michael Jackson for the role of Jar Jar Binks to down to the wire re-shoots for Die Hard. Plus, Matt checks in with Starship 1, the mysterious real person that auditioned for Star Wars Episode 8: The Last Jedi to hear her real time reaction of the trailer and some of the moments from the Star Wars Celebration in Orlando.\n\nThis episode is brought to you by Generation Tux (www.generationtux.com code: IWTT), Harry’s (www.harrys.com/iwtt), and Blue Apron (www.blueapron.com/iwastheretoo).\n\nPresented by the Alamo Drafthouse and recorded live from The Regent Theater in Downtown Los Angeles, Matt speaks with screenwriter Steven de Souza about the 1987 film The Running Man and 1988 film Die Hard. Steven lays urban myths to rest and goes in depth about both films including the unavoidable political aspects of the now 30 year old film The Running Man compared to today’s political climate and the ever changing script almost down to the wire of Die Hard. Plus, we hear a bit how the cult classic Hudson Hawk become what it is thanks to Bruce Willis’ input.\n\nThis episode is brought to you by Mack Weldon (www.mackweldon.com code: WASTHERE) and Hullo (www.hullopillow.com/IWTT)."
