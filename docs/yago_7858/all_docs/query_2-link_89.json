        "text": "Keeping Aware of the Fire Dangers\n\nA substantial swath of two of Lake Superior’s shores are considered at elevated risk for wildfires this week and a third in need of more rain.\n\nThe Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources marks the Thunder Bay area, plus a portion of the Ontario shore from Sault Ste. Marie to about Marathon with an “extreme” forest fire danger rating. The remainder of the shore has an “elevated” rating, according to the OMNR’s map, which you can see here (you’ll need to accept terms of viewing).\n\nTwo new fires started near Wawa this week – now under control, according to the OMNR – and 17 new fires were reported in Northwestern Ontario, according to the TBnewswatch.com staff. “The MNR confirmed 17 new fires across Northwestern Ontario between Friday evening and Sunday evening, pushing the number of active fires to 38,” they reported Monday. Listen to a broadcast here. Fighters of wildfires from Northern Ontario, meanwhile, have been shipping out to western Canada to battle blazes there. See the TBnewswatch story here.\n\nAlmost all of Michigan’s Upper Peninsula – as seen on the U.S. Forest Service map pictured – ranks either high or very high for fire danger. The Forest Service explains: “The fire danger rating is derived by applying local observations of current or predicted conditions of fuel, weather, and topographic factors to a set of complex science-based equations. These calculations result in a numeric scaling of the potential over a large area for fires to ignite, spread, and require fire suppression action.” The map is provided through MapTiler and Open Street Maps. The U.S. Drought Monitor shows a portion of the Wisconsin eastern shore around the Apostle Islands and the Bad River Reservation and Michigan’s Keweenaw Peninsula as “abnormally dry.”\n\nThe good news is that the National Weather Service Marquette station is forecasting storms for today through the weekend … and you can follow the action via the webcam links at Explore Munising (like the image here pulled from Pictured Rocks Cruises in Munising).\n\nA Few Buckets from Our Lake's Shores\n\nA fun listing arrived in our emails that we thought would be worth a note. It's Honest Eco's top 150 alternative bucket list places to visit in the United States. We noticed that sites within the Big Lake neighborhood took up seven of the buckets.\n\nHere's what Honest Eco says of its survey: \"Visiting iconic destinations like the Grand Canyon, Disney World or the Hoover Dam are staple bucket list experiences for many families. However, America's vast landscape is dotted with lesser-known adventures that are equally captivating and enriching. Picture the excitement of swimming with dolphins in Florida, the intrigue of exploring the Biosphere 2 in Oracle, Arizona, or the charm of discovering the Thimble Islands in Connecticut.\n\n\"To shed light on these hidden gems, HonestEco.org, a Florida-based eco tours company, commissioned a survey of 3,000 families to uncover their most coveted alternative bucket list destinations. From this survey, a ranking of the top 150 destinations was compiled, showcasing a variety of unique and unforgettable experiences for families to enjoy.\"\n\nSo, without further delay, here are the Lake Superior buckets chosen. We hope you've already visited some multiple times … or will add them to your own list:\n\nSplit Rock Lighthouse State Park, Minn. (No. 28; the lighthouse seen here)\n\nTahquamenon Falls State Park, Mich. (No. 33; the Lower Falls seen here)\n\nIsle Royale National Park, Mich. (No. 54)\n\nPictured Rocks National Lakeshore, Mich. (No. 64)\n\nBoundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, Minn. (No. 101)\n\nVoyageurs National Park, Minn. (No. 126)\n\nPorcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park, Mich. (No. 142)\n\nAnd, since those surveyed did not have the good sense to name it, may we add Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, Wis. (No. 151).\n\nSomething Fishy\n\nAbout 1,400 dead fish were found in Tischer Creek in Duluth on Aug. 1, several local news outlets are reporting.\n\nThe Minnesota DNR received reports from residents, including Natalie Rickert-Trieschmann, a Hunter’s Park resident who lives along the creek, reported Mikayla Rentsch for Northern News Now. \"She said her kids went down to the creek that morning and saw the dead fish and ran back home to alert her. She said she knew something wasn’t right when she saw the alarming number of dead fish.\"\n\n“They were just all over, mostly trout, chubs, and minnows,” Natalie told Mikayla. “I walked about a half-mile upstream, and it just kept going so I knew right there that wasn’t normal, so I reached out the DNR.”\n\nThe DNR and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency are both investigating the cause of the fish kill. The MPCA released a statement that\n\n\"While the MPCA continues its investigation into possible causes of the fish kill, evidence indicates that this fish kill likely did not occur naturally. Field crews from the two agencies have collected fish and water samples and are analyzing results to help determine the cause. The fish kill was observed following a release reported by the city of Duluth to the Minnesota Duty Officer of between 400,000 to 500,000 gallons of water from a reservoir owned by the city of Duluth. The MPCA has no evidence to indicate that nearby construction contributed to the fish kill.\"\n\nFacebook page, the MPCA urged reporting of fish kills if you spot dead fish or unusual runoff in a lake or stream. \"People should call the Minnesota Duty Officer at 1-800-422-0798 right away,\" it encouraged. \"Timing is critical to determine the cause.\"\n\nMaking Waves of Music All Season\n\nWe know summer is the season of sun and swimming in the Lake, but increasingly around our Big Lake neighborhood, it's the season of outdoor music – live and local.\n\nAs we enter the dog days of summer, we want to remind you to schedule at least one \"date\" with a concert on your shore. This is literally just a \"small\" sampler.
