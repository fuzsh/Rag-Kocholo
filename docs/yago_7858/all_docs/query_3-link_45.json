        "text": "Easter eggs are always a fun thing for fans of specific franchises and/or directors to look for in new films. A hint at the existence of Dr. Strange in Captain America: The Winter Soldier? Awesome! A throwaway joke about Gotham City on CBS ’ Supergirl? Awesome! A tease about Robert Patrick’s Terminator past in John Cena’s The Marine? Ok, maybe not all of them are awesome, but you get the point.\n\nIn most cases, such references and in-jokes are nothing more than throwaway gags meant to honor the works of other filmmakers and elicit smiles from fans. Sometimes, however, they can be the secret mortar that connects a handful of disparate films and franchises together, even if they never actually interact cinematically. Fox holds one such mega-franchise, and I’m not really sure if they even know it.\n\nWhat is the “Val Verde-verse”? To put it simply, it is an unofficial cinematic universe comprised of films (and their franchises) that have referenced or taken place within the fictional Latin American country of Val Verde. The country was created by screenwriter Steven E. de Souza for 1985’s Arnold Schwarzenegger actioner, Commando. In the film, a former South American dictator named Arius (Dan Hedaya) wants the man who deposed him from power, Delta Force commando John Matrix (Arnold Schwarzenegger), to assassinate the nation’s current leader. That nation is the fictional country of Val Verde.\n\nVal Verde comes up again two years later in 1987’s Predator, when Major Dutch Schaefer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his Special Forces team are sent into Val Verde by the CIA under the pretense of rescuing a kidnapped cabinet minister and his employees. As anyone familiar with the action/sci-fi classic knows, things don’t exactly go as planned for Dutch and his team. We’re two films into a secret cinematic universe and we already have two different Arnolds running about it. Can one think of a better mega-franchise?\n\nSteven E. de Souza, who was not involved with Predator (at least to my knowledge), once again conjures up Val Verde in 1990’s Die Hard 2: Die Harder. In the ever-unlucky John McClane’s (Bruce Willis) second bought with a terrorist takeover, he finds himself up against a rogue paramilitary unit bent on rescuing General Ramon Esperanza (Franco Nero). Esperanza, the current dictator of Val Verde, is being extradited to the United States for his country’s involvement in drug trafficking. Much like Commando’s Arius, however, Esperanza never gets to regain control of his fictional homeland, courtesy of our hero.\n\nVal Verde also later made appearances in two TV series that de Souza worked on: 1988’s Supercarrier (technically the 3rd usage of the country) and 2002’s Adventure Inc. The latter marks the final usage of the country to this writer’s knowledge, unless we count de Souza’s time on the Devil’s Due revival of comic book character Sheena. The connections don’t end here, however.\n\nVal Verde might step out of prominence from here on out, but there are other films connected to this cinematic universe. The Alien vs. Predator films (as well as a xenomorph skull cameo in Predator 2) automatically pull in the five (soon to be six) Alien films into this mega-verse of movies. That alone racks the total up to 16 films. That’s 5 Die Hards, 5 Aliens, 3 Predators, 2 AVPs, and Commando; which doesn’t even consider Fox’s upcoming installments of these franchises (Die Hard: Year One, Ridley Scott’s Alien: Covenant, and Shane Black’s The Predator). Still, even now totaling at 19 films, the connections don’t end here.\n\nIn John McTiernan’s Die Hard (1988), Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) and his fellow thieving terrorists use a stolen Pacific Courier vehicle to quietly sneak into Nakatomi Tower. McTiernan keeps this going in 1995’s Die Hard with a Vengeance, with the company’s Eastern seaboard offshoot, Atlantic Courier, appearing in a similar fashion. Jan de Bont, who was McTiernan’s director of photography on Die Hard, also used Pacific Courier in his own terrorist-themed actioner, Speed (1994). As a result, the two Speed films unofficially become a part of the Die Hard franchise. Due to Die Hard 2’s usage of Val Verde, this in turn connects them to the “Val Verde-verse” as a whole, totaling out mega-movieverse out at 21 films spread out across 4 franchises. All of which fall under the ownership of Fox.\n\nThere's also the Warner Bros./HBO Films production, Ricochet. Directed in 1991 by Russell Mulcahy, this Denzel Washington-starring crime thriller was co-written by Shane Black pal Fred Dekker and produced by Joel Silver (Die Hard, Predator). While lacking connections via Val Verde or Pacific Courier, it does share a character with an above film. Mary Ellen Trainor, best known for her role as the precinct psychologist who is constantly harassed by Mel Gibson's character in the Lethal Weapon films, actually reprises her role from Die Hard in it. That's right, news anchor Gail Wallens pops up in both films. It's a fun nod to find in a film from another studio and one that I was completely unaware of until a friend pointed it out.\n\nFrom a monetary standpoint, we’re now looking at a secret cinematic universe comprised of 19 films (soon to be 22) that have grossed a combined $5.3 billion worldwide (adjusted for inflation). That’s one hell of an asset to have on hand. Does that mean we will ever get to see John McClane (Bruce Willis), Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves), Adventure Inc.’s Judson Cross (Michael Biehn), John Matrix (Arnold Schwarzenegger), or a returning Dutch Schaefer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) face off against a horde of Predators and Aliens in some future film? Probably not, but continuity-wise, the possibility is there."
