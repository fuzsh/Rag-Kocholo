        "text": "Carl Barton had become weary of the building industry stress and had a strong desire to develop his real estate holdings. Arnold Malow, on the other hand, was well-known in the industry and had a host of friends in prominent business positions. He never got too involved with operation details, but his expertise in financial matters and sales was astounding.\n\nDuring this time period, following in my forefathers’ footsteps, I was ordained a minister in the Evangelical Baptist Church (Apostolic Christian) as my grandfather had been before me after he had emigrated from Switzerland. In our faith, except in the mission field, all of the ministers are expected to be self-supporting, following the practice of the apostles. This unquestionably placed additional responsibilities on my life. Carl and Arnold were well aware of my convictions and were very supportive.\n\nReorganization and Dramatic Changes\n\nI was approached by Carl and Arnold to be a member of a company reorganization plan. As the father of four small children at the time with a wife to support and a poor country boy background, obviously there were no assets to draw upon. However, they were extremely understanding. The slate of officers and the new ownership consisted of Mrs. Malow and Mrs. Barton, who would both invest $50,000 in the new corporation. Harold Butler and I would each purchase $15,000 worth of company stock, which the company loaned me at a reasonable rate of interest on my signature only.\n\nProbably in the history of our company, this period of time had the most dramatic changes and tremendously impacted me personally. When I purchased stock for the first time, it opened avenues that I had not anticipated.\n\nCarl Barton became President, Arnold Malow, Executive Vice President and Treasurer, Harold Butler, Vice President and Chief Estimator, and I as Vice President and Director of Field Operations. The four of us, along with our accountant Kins Collins, were Directors. I was 29 and overwhelmed at the responsibility and opportunity that was before me, and frightened by what I considered an awesome debt.\n\nHarold was 52 and well versed in the industry, moderately fixed financially, and extremely capable. The two of us were very compatible, had an excellent working relationship and our efforts from the onset were profitable. The two senior statesmen provided excellent support. Carl was active in the community and Arnold continued to make contacts and provided financial strength that was essential to a thriving enterprise. The scripture well states, “Except the Lord build a house, they labor in vain that build it,” and from inception the blessings of Almighty God were upon us.\n\nIn 1952, the company became the first construction firm in the U.S. to establish a profit-sharing/pension plan for the benefit of employees. We set aside a portion of our profits in an irrevocable trust to accrue to the employees’ benefit to be made available upon retirement, termination of employment, disability or death. The money was tax-free until the recipient had the money in hand. There is no question that this plan contributed immeasurably to the stability and growth of our company.\n\nIn the early 1950’s we spread our operations to adjoining states, particularly in partnership with Udylite Corporation in the installation of automated plating equipment. We had approximately 2,000 employees on the National Steel account where we performed all trade work, including the installation of all of the equipment in the rolling mills, track maintenance, and the relining of blast furnaces.\n\nIn June of 1953, Carl Barton resigned as President and became Chairman of the Board. Arnold Malow was elevated to President and me to Executive Vice President of the company. Several new major accounts were added in 1953, which included the Ebling and Detroit Creameries, which later merged into National Dairies and Gobel and Koppitz, major breweries, which were eventually brought under the umbrella of the Stroh Company.\n\nGross sales for the year ending 1954 approached $18 million; dividends were paid regularly to stockholders and yield on investment was 75% in 1952, 67% in 1953, dropping to 37% in 1954. In 1954, a crippling strike by the CIO steelworkers union brought the industry to its knees.\n\nThe settlement of that dispute completely revolutionized the construction methodology throughout the unionized industrial world. The settlement addressed the right of the various in-plant unions to regulate and their first right to any ongoing maintenance or support work in the plant. Almost overnight, we were faced with the sad task of a massive layoff of approximately 1,000 employees. This situation resulted in a full-scale analysis of the company’s philosophy, and we concluded that never again would we have all of our eggs in one market basket, a very dramatic turning point in our company’s history."
