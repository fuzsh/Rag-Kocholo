        "text": "Ah, it’s that magical time of year! When the Hudson hawk nips at the nose, and the skyline over the New Jersey Palisades bruises by midafternoon. When chimney smoke from private houses spices the air, and strings of colored lights adorn windows and fire escapes. And, of course, when the Internet engages in its annual bullshit debate as to whether perennial holiday favorite Die Hard, currently celebrating its thirty-fifth anniversary, is a Christmas movie. And since “bullshit debates” are my brand…\n\nIn fourth grade, I scored what was, by 1980s standards, the holy grail: a best friend with HBO. Over the following five years, I slept over at his house every weekend, where we watched R-rated action movies into the night. Whatever HBO was showing that week, we delighted in it, no matter how idiotic (Action Jackson) or forgettable (Running Scared). For a pair of preadolescent boys, that Saturday-night cinematic grab bag abounded with illicit wonders.\n\nMuch as we enjoyed those movies, though, they were for the most part—this isn’t a criticism—ephemeral crap. We howled at their profane jokes and thrilled to their improbable set pieces, but seldom if ever revisited any of them (Beverly Hills Cop [1984] and its sequel [1987] being a rare exception), and certainly none inspired us to playact their scenarios as we had with PG-rated adventures Ghostbusters (1984) and Back to the Future (1985). They entertained us, sure, but didn’t exactly impress upon our imaginations in any lasting or meaningful way…\n\nThat is, not until an action thriller with the snarky guy from Moonlighting (1985–1989) and Blind Date (1987) came along. I still remember seeing Die Hard (1988) for the first time, on a thirteen-inch television with side-mounted mono speaker at my friend’s Bronx apartment. As a viewing experience, it was about as low-def as they come, but that didn’t diminish the white-knuckled hold the movie had on us; we watched it in astonished silence from beginning to end. From that point on—and this was the year no less than Tim Burton’s Batman had seized the zeitgeist, and our longstanding favorites Ghostbusters and Back to the Future got their first sequels—Die Hard was almost all we could talk about.\n\nAt the time, Manhattan College was in the process of erecting a twelve-story student residence overlooking Van Cortlandt Park, and we would gather with our JHS pals at the construction site on weekends, running around the unfinished edifice with automatic squirt guns, playing out the movie’s gleefully violent plot. Hell, at one point or another, every multistory building in the neighborhood with a labyrinthine basement and rooftop access became Nakatomi Plaza, the setting of a life-and-death battle staged and waged by a group of schoolboys, our imaginations captive to the elemental premise of Die Hard.\n\nWe obsessed over that fucking movie so exhaustively, we passed around this still-in-my-possession copy of the pulp-trash novel it was based on—Roderick Thorp’s Nothing Lasts Forever (1979)—until every one of us had had a chance to read it:\n\nThe thirteen-year-old boys of the late ’80s were far from the only demographic taken with Die Hard. The movie proved so hugely popular, it not only spawned an immediate sequel in 1990 (which we were first in line to see at an appallingly seedy theater on Valentine Avenue), but became its own subgenre throughout the rest of that decade. Hollywood gave us Die Hard on a battleship (Under Siege), Die Hard on a plane (Passenger 57), Die Hard on a train (Under Siege 2: Dark Territory), Die Hard on a mountain (Cliffhanger), Die Hard on a bus (Speed), Die Hard on a cruise ship (Speed 2: Cruise Control), Die Hard in a hockey arena (Sudden Death), Die Hard on Rodeo Drive (The Taking of Beverly Hills), Die Hard at prep school (Toy Soldiers)…\n\nChrist, things got so out of control, even Beverly Hills Cop, an established action franchise predating Die Hard, abandoned its own winning formula for the third outing (scripted by Steven E. de Souza, co-screenwriter of the first two Die Hards) in favor of a half-assed “Die Hard in an amusement park” scenario. This actually happened:\n\nNone of those films has had the staying power of the original Die Hard. Mostly that’s owed to Die Hard being a superior specimen of filmmaking. Director John McTiernan demonstrates uncommonly disciplined visual panache: He expertly keeps the viewer spatially oriented in the movie’s confined setting, employing swish pans and sharp tilts to establish the positions of characters within a given scene, as well as imbue the cat-and-mouse of it all with breathless tension.\n\nMcTiernan consistently sends his hero scuttling to different locations within the building—stairwells, pumprooms, elevator shafts, airducts, the rooftop helipad—evoking a rat-in-a-cage energy that leaves the viewer feeling trapped though never claustrophobic. The narrative antithesis of the globetrotting exploits of Indiana Jones and James Bond, Die Hard is a locked-room thriller made with an ’80s action-movie sensibility. It was and remains a masterclass in suspense storytelling—often imitated, as the old saying goes, never duplicated.\n\nPerhaps another key reason for the movie’s durability, its sustained cultural relevance, is owed to its (conditional) status as a celebrated Christmas classic. Like It’s a Wonderful Life (1946) and National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation (1989) and Love Actually (2003), Die Hard is a feel-good film—albeit with a considerably higher body count—one is almost compelled to watch each December. Yet whereas nobody questions any of the aforementioned movies’ culturally enshrined place in the holiday-movie canon—nor that of cartoonishly violent Home Alone (1990)—Die Hard’s eligibility seems perennially under review.\n\nWhy does the debate around Die Hard die hard… and is it, in fact, a Christmas movie?\n\nNow I Have a Machine Gun… HO-HO-HO\n\nDie Hard is, notably, but one of many R-rated action films of its era set within a Yuletide context, alongside the likes of First Blood (1982), Invasion U.S.A. (1985), Cobra (1986), Running Scared (1986), Lethal Weapon (1987), and The Last Boy Scout (1991). Who knows why Christmas became such a go-to backdrop for these kinds of films. Action movies tend to be conspicuously conservative in their values, often featuring a solitary law-enforcement officer (usually a white man) who will go to any lengths necessary to protect the “little folks” under his auspices from drug traffickers, international terrorists, communists—all the standard-issue cinematic bogeymen of the Reagan era.\n\nPolice officers are, historically, defenders of the status quo—keepers of the peace (meaning existing power structures, with all the rights and privileges those socioeconomic hierarchies confer/withhold)—and what if anything symbolizes peace and traditional values with greater universality than Christmas?\n\nWithin the context of the latter half of the twentieth century, “peace” can be understood as a euphemism for “law and order,” with its dog-whistle connotations, and “traditional values” as consumerism and materialism—the raison d’êtres for suburbanization, for white flight. Therefore, when our action heroes are placed in mortal danger at Christmastime, the stakes are far higher than one cop’s survival or the thwarting of some nefarious criminal plot; the American way itself—read: social privilege—is under assault.\n\nChristmas notwithstanding, is there a more accurate sociocultural barometer of male insecurity than a given era’s action heroes? It isn’t happenstance the decline of the British Empire coincided with the creation of hypermasculine MI6 operative James Bond in 1953. Half a century later, hypercompetent counterterrorist agent Jack Bauer of 24 would offer similar reassurance to rattled American audiences in the wake of the 9/11 attacks and ensuing War on Terror.\n\nIn the 1980s, midway between Bond and Bauer, the archetypal Stallone and Schwarzenegger action heroes—John Rambo, Dutch Schaefer (Predator)—provided a revisionist heroic narrative for the American male left permanently demoralized by Vietnam. (A steel-haired Rambo came out of retirement during the Trump administration to violently dispatch brown-skinned sex traffickers coming across the border from Mexico. Thank you for your service?) Time and again, whenever masculinity—usually in the form of either patriarchy or Western supremacy—is existentially threatened, our action heroes come to the rescue.\n\nIn 1985, Rambo took care of our unfinished business in Vietnam in Rambo: First Blood, Part II, and Rocky won the Cold War—on Christmas Day! on Christmas Day!—in Rocky IV. Those aspirational fantasies were more or less realized in reality by the late 1980s, when Ronald Reagan vanquished communism that glorious morn he “knocked down the Berlin Wall using his nutsack as a wrecking ball” (Stephen Colbert, “Billie Jean King,” The Colbert Report, season 9, episode 145, aired September 9, 2013, 22 min.).\n\nIt was around this same time—the dissolution of the Soviet Union—that so many hit TV series of the ’80s featuring macho Vietnam vets as their protagonists (The A-Team, Magnum, P.I., Miami Vice) were winding down. Hell, even Stallone’s versatile heroes seemed out of place in a world devoid of commies, with Rambo living anonymously in a Thai monastery in Rambo III (1988), and Rocky back on the streets of Philly once again in Rocky V (1990), no money in his pocket or anyone left to fight.\n\nThe ’90s offered a kinder, gentler Arnold, with Schwarzenegger softening his image by appearing in a series of successful Ivan Reitman–directed family comedies, and rehabilitating the T-800 from the unstoppable killing machine of The Terminator (1984) to a cyborg who discovers his inner Mary Poppins in Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), in which he acts as a wish-fulfilment father figure to the young boy whose very existence he was originally programmed to snuff. The end of the Cold War inspired the action hero to embrace his sensitive side. Enter John McClane.\n\nI Will Never Even Think About Going up in a Tall Building Again…\n\nMany have observed how McClane, at the time of Die Hard’s release, represented a new kind of action hero—a physically and emotionally vulnerable one, in contrast with the steroidal stoicism of mid-’80s Stallone and Schwarzenegger. This is true. It wasn’t brute strength that was McClane’s superpower so much as his stubbornness, hence the movie’s title. To my view, however, the more salient difference is the personal issue that motivates him—the then–au courant threat to traditional manhood McClane is meant to grapple with and, for the target audience’s vicarious pleasure, assert dominion: second-wave feminism.\n\nAs portrayed by Bruce Willis in Die Hard, John McClane is a proudly old-fashioned New York cop. He carries a single duffel bag with him on his visit to L.A. He sits in the front seat of the limousine sent to fetch him from LAX. He bemoans the intrusion of hip-hop in the sanctified genre of traditional Christmas music. He scoffs at the touchscreen directory in the lobby of Nakatomi Tower (“Cute toy,” he mocks). He’s frustrated by his estranged wife’s professional use of her maiden name (“Christ,” he mutters at the sight of it in the directory). And he feels totally out of place at the office Christmas party, full of white-collar assholes drunk on cheap champagne and high on coke (“Fuckin’ Californians…” he sneers out of one side of his mouth).\n\n“You throw quite a party,” he tells his wife’s boss (James Shigeta). “I didn’t realize they celebrated Christmas in Japan.” Right—Christmas is an American tradition, goddammit! Don’t you watch action movies?\n\nWhen McClane reunites with his wife, Holly Gennero (Bonnie Bedelia), it’s their first face-to-face in six months, since she accepted a job as a corporate executive that necessitated a move to L.A. McClane, by his own admission, didn’t bother to go with her—or the kids (more on their festering resentment later)—erroneously reasoning she’d come crawling back to him in short order.\n\nThrough this backstory, we’re introduced to an action hero who has less in common with super-soldiers John Rambo and Schwarzenegger’s John Matrix (from Commando, also scripted by de Souza) than he does the male Baby boomers of Thirtysomething (1987–1991), born into a postwar world of conventional gender roles only to find themselves struggling, as young husbands and fathers, to adapt to the reality of increasing equality between the sexes. (Willis was 32 at the time of filming.) McClane’s masculinity is challenged, if not fully threatened, by a corporate ladder–climbing wife with zero interest in playing Suzy Homemaker.\n\nAnd while McClane learns humility from his life-and-death ordeal—during the film’s Dark Night of the Soul, he confesses to his new pal, LAPD Sgt. Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson), that he regrets not being more supportive of Holly—it’s hard to view the film’s closing statement as anything close to progressive:\n\nThe very theme of the movie is violence as redemption; it is only by means of his heroic effort to fight the terrorists that McClane saves his marriage, just as Al, through violence, saves his police-hood—in effect, his manhood. There are no female officers involved in the mission and, for that matter, no female criminals. . . .\n\nRichard Brody, “Eighties Action Movies I’ve Never Seen: Die Hard’s Culture of Violence,” New Yorker, August 3, 2017\n\nRight. At the climax, McClane saves Holly from plummeting down the side of the building along with the villain clinging to her wrist by unclasping her corporately gifted Rolex—the very emblem of her independence. She at that point explicitly recommits to her married surname, and then, when confronted down on the street by an opportunistic reporter (William Atherton), punches his lights out. By the film’s coda, Holly has not only adopted her husband’s name, but his preferred mode of problem-solving, as well.\n\nI am, admittedly, far from the first critic to note the symbolism embedded in the wristwatch. Scores of books and articles have been written about the subtext of Die Hard, with particular respect to its deeply conservative ethos: that the primary antagonist, Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), has ties to a militant left-wing West German terrorist organization, meaning he’s a commie at heart, even if his criminal agenda—stealing corporate bearer bonds—is textbook capitalism (commies and socialists are all hypocrites, anyway, right?); that the Nakatomi Corporation itself “is an emblem of the then widely stoked fear that Japanese high-tech businesses were threatening to dominate the American economy” (ibid.).\n\nOn that point: The L.A. high-rise in Nothing Lasts Forever, the publication of which coincided with the 1979 oil crisis, is not a Japanese-owned multinational, but rather the corporate headquarters of Klaxon Oil, and the terrorists’ program—exposing Klaxon’s illicit transactional association with the Military Junta of Chile—is political/ideological. But positioning American fossil-fuel extractors as morally dubious wasn’t really gonna fly in the Reagan era—not after the Gipper had the solar panels installed by that tree-hugging pussy Jimmy Carter torn off the White House roof.\n\nIn the conference room, as Hans admires the scale models of Nakatomi’s various global-industrialization projects on imperialistic display, note how one is a petroleum refinery and the other an offshore-drilling platform. Implicit in this throwaway detail is the notion that extractive exploitation is only something to worry about when it stands to enrich foreign competitors.\n\nBetween the publication of the novel and the release of the movie, the Reagan presidency codified the end of—the reversal of—the progressive economic policies and social programs that seeded and nourished the very postwar prosperity that created the American middle class. But Die Hard would prefer to see second-wave feminism as the prevailing social cancer of its era, not neoliberal capitalism.\n\nBut as I said: Die Hard’s themes and motifs have been exhaustively analyzed elsewhere. And besides which, I doubt any of its subtextual imagery is intentional, anyhow. I don’t actually think Die Hard is trying to say anything; there’s no more meaning to take from it than there is from a ride on the Coney Island Cyclone. It’s an entirely visceral experience, not an intellectual exercise—the kind of empty-calorie entertainment Hollywood’s been serving up for decades. As Stephen King observed in 1981:\n\nIn place of the ideas that books and novels give us, the movies often substitute large helpings of gut emotion. To this American movies have added a fierce sense of image, and the two together create a dazzling show. Take Clint Eastwood in Don Siegel’s Dirty Harry, for instance. In terms of ideas, the film is an idiotic mishmash. In terms of image and emotion—the young kidnap victim being pulled from the cistern at dawn, the bad guy terrorizing the busload of children, the granite face of Dirty Harry Callahan himself—the film is brilliant. Even the best of liberals walk out of a film like Dirty Harry or Peckinpah’s Straw Dogs looking as if they have been clopped over the head… or run over by a train.\n\nStephen King, Danse Macabre (New York: Gallery Books, 2010), 57\n\nAdd Die Hard to that list—and Rambo, James Bond, and 24, while you’re at it. Die Hard is an idiotic mishmash of ideas, manipulating its audience by appealing to both our violent fantasies and, incongruously, our holiday sentimentality. That’s why it works—it pushes all the right buttons. (Home Alone succeeds for much the same reason.) But that’s not to suggest Die Hard doesn’t promote some noxious ideas, not least of which is the way it glorifies the “solitary hero” trope.\n\nHe’s Alone, Tired… and the Only Chance Anyone Has Got\n\nEveryone in Die Hard save McClane is either arrogant (Nakatomi executive Harry Ellis), incompetent (the LAPD), unscrupulous (the on-scene reporters), dismissive (the 9-1-1 operators), distracted (the limo driver), corrupt (Gruber’s gang), inefficient (the FBI), or authoritatively clueless (the news anchors and pundits). Everyone. McClane is the lone voice of reason in a world filled with idiots.\n\nAnd while popular fiction and media have always mythologized the righteous loner—through the hardboiled whodunits of Humphrey Bogart and Westerns of John Wayne; the sundry police officers and gunslingers portrayed by Eastwood and wasteland warriors of dystopian sci-fi—Baby boomer McClane represented the most relatable and accessible iteration of that American archetype to date: the Reaganite cowboy.\n\nMcClane possesses none of the sneering cynicism or emotional aloofness of Sam Spade, Ethan Edwards, Harry Callahan, or Snake Plissken; there is, refreshingly, a genial warmth about him, a self-effacing humor—the same qualities Reagan demonstrated to win over a country demoralized by Watergate and Vietnam and the energy crisis. In contrast with Carter’s downbeat message of consumption-doesn’t-supplant-community, Reagan championed the spirit of American individualism via deregulated capitalism: our God-given right to have what we want, when we want—and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. (Certainly not anyone from the government!) Die Hard is suffused in the Reagan ethos:\n\n“Die Hard” is a furiously anti-bureaucratic, anti-governmental film. The movie displays thoroughgoing skepticism toward authority, toward officialdom, toward those in power at all levels, from the local L.A.P.D. captain (Paul Gleason) to the F.B.I., whose takeover of the mission is greeted as sneeringly by McClane (“The feds?”) as it would have been by Ronald Reagan himself. McClane’s braggadocious response to the first terrorist he catches, who stands up to him, serves as the movie’s own statement about the right way, rather than the approved way, to dispatch a miscreant:\n\n“You won’t hurt me.”\n\n“Yeah? Why not?”\n\n“Because you’re a policeman. There are rules for policemen.”\n\n“Yeah, that’s what my captain keeps telling me.”\n\nBrody, “Die Hard’s Culture of Violence”\n\nThe message embedded in Die Hard, however unintentional, is that the social compact applies to everyone else, not the “hero.” He’s too good, too smart, too capable, too fucking righteous to be hamstrung by rules. Those are for idiots so woefully devoid of his impeccable instincts. He is the hero; he is everything.\n\nAgain: Die Hard is hardly the first movie to promote such an idea. But what makes it different from the Westerns and policiers before it is that it was a hyper-successful, trendsetting example of what’s known in screenwriting parlance as a Dude with a Problem movie.\n\nAs defined by Blake Snyder in his Save the Cat! storytelling program, the essence of Dude with a Problem (DWAP) is that an innocent hero quite suddenly—and through absolutely no fault of his own—finds himself in an unfolding crisis whereby the stakes are nothing short of life and death. Misery (1990), Mission: Impossible (1996), The Martian (2015), Gone Girl (2014)—all DWAP movies. Implicit in this story model is the notion of a protagonist (again: typically a straight white man) as both victim and hero.\n\nThat is certainly true of Die Hard (and the endless knockoffs it inspired): McClane is not only a victim of circumstance, but also, consequently, of the sheer ineptitude of everyone around him. Not only can he expect no help from anyone else, but it becomes his responsibility to save those everyday dummies from themselves—to be, however “reluctantly,” the hero of the story.\n\nMake no mistake: Movies like Die Hard and its ilk inadvertently trained a generation of viewers (largely but by no means exclusively men) to view themselves as the righteous protagonist of their very own heroic narrative—cursed to be the smartest guy in a world teeming with morons who, owed to their incurable idiocy and groundlessly inflated sense of self, don’t recognize his moral and intellectual preeminence.\n\nThat Die Hard is violent, and that it inspired scores of other wantonly violent action movies, isn’t why it’s so culturally pernicious. It’s that it helped to breed a generation of what I pejoratively call “everyday heroes”: assholes for whom the rules don’t apply, who treat everyone else as obstacles to be circumvented or steamrolled, and who, contradictorily, see themselves as victim-cum-hero. This worldview is evident in the impatient and aggressive way drivers conduct themselves behind the wheel these days, and it’s certainly the animating spirit of the MAGA movement (of which Reagan could arguably be considered the grandfather, Newt Gingrich the father, and Trump the prodigal son).\n\nHere’s an Oscar-winning DWAP that deftly avoided those tropes: The Fugitive (1993). Wrongly convicted of his wife’s murder, Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) is an innocent hero thrust into a life-or-death struggle, but he’s no smarter or more competent than anyone else, including law enforcement and the criminal conspirators. The movie doesn’t position Kimble as the only virtuous or capable person in the world of the story, and he seldom if ever resorts to violence to solve problems. It isn’t only Kimble that has a brain; the movie does, too. It’s the thinking person’s Die Hard, and it’s just as suspenseful and entertaining. It isn’t so goddamn insecure that it needs to exalt the hero by denigrating everyone around him.\n\nOrphan of a Bankrupt Culture\n\nIt’s fitting that John McClane should’ve inspired a legion of “heroic” disciples, both on- and offscreen, because he, too, was an explicit product of his own formative pop-cultural influences:\n\nThe culture of violence in “Die Hard” isn’t merely practical, it’s national—Hans Gruber mocks McClane over the walkie-talkie: “Who are you? Just another American who saw too many movies as a child? Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he’s John Wayne, Rambo, Marshal Dillon?” (Of course, McClane’s response is famous: he prefers Roy Rogers, and takes to the battle purring, “Yippie-ki-yay, motherfucker!”)\n\nibid.\n\nExactly—McClane, having grown up on Westerns like any good boomer, purposefully adopts a TV-cowboy persona, just as Ronald Reagan channeled that same affected swagger as a politician. (And like Reagan, Roy Rogers—also born 1911—was a Republican. Again: I doubt the filmmakers were trying to make a political statement, but McClane’s choice of alter ego offers insight into the unconscious ethos of the storytellers.) And much like Reagan was our first screen-trained president, it could be argued John McClane was our first pop culture–savvy action hero, consciously fashioning himself after and fancying himself a mythic American archetype. Like us, he’d grown up watching—and loving—action movies.\n\nThe late ’80s seem to be the point at which pop culture, like Skynet in The Terminator, became self-aware. Only a year before Die Hard, the teenage characters in Joel Schumacher’s The Lost Boys (1987), when confronted with a vampire coven in their California beach community, relied on their knowledge of such supernatural perils from the countless TV shows and horror comics they’d consumed. They weren’t subject to the steep learning curve that challenged the ignorant protagonists of earlier monster movies, and they diffused tension with pop-referential humor: “It’s the attack of Eddie Munster!” one adolescent vampire-slayer cries when confronted by a frothing ten-year-old bloodsucker.\n\nSuddenly, filmmakers, critics, and viewers all became aware that they were functioning in an environment of pop culture, as if fish had suddenly become aware of living in water, and the attention paid to the most prominent productions of mass media further amplified them, turning filmmaking into a mighty feedback machine of cultural self-reflection.\n\nibid.\n\nIt wouldn’t be until the mid-’90s that metatextual self-commentary achieved cinematic apotheosis through Scream (1996), and emerging screenwriters like Quentin Tarantino (whose forte was crime thrillers) and Kevin Smith (slacker comedies) and Joss Whedon (pseudofeminist SF/horror) made pop-cultural references in dialogue de rigueur, but Die Hard was a harbinger of all to come; John McClane and Mr. Brown (Tarantino) from Reservoir Dogs (1992) probably would’ve liked one another (… before they blew each other away, of course). Hell, in those embryonic days of Hollywood’s chrysalis to the industrial-scale cultural “feedback machine” it is today, Willis reprised the role of McClane for a self-satirizing cameo in National Lampoon’s Loaded Weapon 1 (1993).\n\nBut even before McClane went meta, he was a character that related to (and positioned himself within) his world through the two-way lens of pop culture. He even celebrates blowing Hans away at the movie’s climax with a fanciful smoking-barrel blowout, wishing his bested adversary “Happy trails.” John McClane might even be one of the unheralded founding fathers of contemporary nerd culture: a comfortably violent, wisecracking badass—the kind social outcasts dream of being, hence their devotion to grimdark superhero fiction—who learned everything he needed to know in life from the junk-food entertainment he was raised on.\n\nThe erudite antagonist of Die Hard, Hans Gruber, refers to McClane as “another orphan of a bankrupt culture.” Fuck that pretentious douchebag’s “classical education” and subscriptions to Forbes and Time! McClane shows him: Hans is a left-wing elitist who’s carefully orchestrated robbery is foiled by a street-smart, improvisational, wisecracking, working-class hero for whom “facts from newspapers” are just the boring version of trivia on Jeopardy!\n\nIf Ronald Reagan demonstrated to a demoralized nation that a B-movie actor was the right man to conquer the Soviet Union, Reaganite cowboy John McClane showed us there is nothing more noble than getting your values and your most critical life lessons from Hollywood entertainment—that what elitist foreigners like Hans Gruber, with his manicured beard and tailored suits, refer to as a “bankrupt culture” is, in fact, everything great about being an American. Yippie-ki-yay, muthafucka—and Merry Christmas, too!\n\nIn the 1980s, pop culture produced a president who inspired an action-movie avatar who assured his impressionable audience that individualism is heroic, violence is masculine, and there’s no greater virtue—that nostalgic paean to all-things-’80s Ready Player One (2011) will back me up on this—than being a lifelong fanboy of the idiotic entertainment you grew up on. To hell with Rambo—John McClane is the most Reaganesque character Ronald Reagan never played.\n\nAnd did I mention he’s a cop?\n\nDrop It, Dickhead, It’s the Police\n\nWhile Die Hard may have no use for bureaucracy or government institutions—lest we forget the nine most terrifying words in the English language—it certainly venerates the go-it-alone lawman with a license to kill (who’s not afraid to use it!). The filmmakers demonstrate this not only through McClane, but through the movie’s only other virtuous character:\n\n[T]he main sidekick to [McClane] is the uncle from the Steve Urkel show, and more importantly a fellow cop in the movie (and also the Urkel show). . . . This good, wholesome cop made only one innocent and totally forgivable mistake in his life, killing a (undoubtedly black) kid with a toy gun. Now he’s too psychologically damaged to engage in police-sponsored-murder of civilians ever again. Thankfully, [McClane] comes to the rescue, and his inspiring courage and heroism show him the light. When the end of the film finally comes, and one last Communist is still standing, [Powell] becomes the hero [by] blowing him away with his standard issue firearm, finally able to murder for the bourgeoisie once again!\n\nDash the Internet Marxist, “Marxist Movie Review: Die Hard,” Medium, November 4, 2021\n\nWhile that may be a comically exaggerated interpretation—again: I don’t think the movie is intellectually ambitious enough to have anything near a conscious political agenda—it nonetheless rightfully indicts Die Hard as one more entry (a massively popular one, at that) in a long tradition of pro-police propaganda, compliments of Hollywood, that began in earnest with 1950s procedural Dragnet (the catchphrase from which McClane notably quotes in Die Hard 2, as he surely would have grown up watching it) and continues to this day through, among other media, the Law & Order juggernaut, the cultural influence of which is absolutely alarming, as John Oliver details in this essential half-hour analysis from 2022:\n\nEver notice how much we love the police in this country? I can’t walk around my block—in as ostensibly liberal a city as New York, of all places—without spotting half-a-dozen bumper stickers burnishing pro-police messaging (“I Support Law Enforcement”) or imagery (those thin-blue-line U.S. flags that are somehow more insidiously potent than any on-the-nose sloganeering).\n\nYou know what I never see? Bumper sticks that read “I Support the Postal Service.” Or “I Support the Department of Sanitation.” And yet if either of those agencies disappeared tomorrow, I daresay we would miss them both immediately and immensely. But, alas, they don’t have a multibillion-dollar PR apparatus portraying them as exciting or sexy—building an entire lifestyle culture around what’s supposed to be a taxpayer-funded public service. We can appreciate the police, sure, but is it really healthy to love them?\n\nTwo kinds of police appeared on mid-century American television. The good guys solved crime on prime-time police procedurals like “Dragnet,” starting in 1951, and “Adam-12,” beginning in 1968 (both featured the L.A.P.D.). The bad guys shocked America’s conscience on the nightly news: Arkansas state troopers barring Black students from entering Little Rock Central High School, in 1957; Birmingham police clubbing and arresting some seven hundred Black children protesting segregation, in 1963; and Alabama state troopers beating voting-rights marchers at Selma, in 1965. These two faces of policing help explain how, in the nineteen-sixties, the more people protested police brutality, the more money governments gave to police departments.\n\nJill Lepore, “The Invention of the Police,” New Yorker, July 13, 2020\n\nAudiences—particularly those of the privileged white variety—have been trained by Hollywood to view police as noble in intention, wise in judgment, and justifiably violent when necessary, because they exist for the righteous purpose of protecting good people from bad people, simple as that. That’s certainly how my friends and I, those of us who used to play “Die Hard at Manhattan College,” viewed them, having grown up on movies like Die Hard and TV procedurals such as NYPD Blue. And God only knows what they’ve trained police officers to think about themselves. Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who murdered George Floyd, is exactly my age—a mere three weeks older. I’ll bet he play-acted Die Hard with his pals, too.\n\nA friend of mine—a career officer for the NYPD—once told me that many people who pursue a line of work in law enforcement don’t actually have any discernable personality or identity of their own; this is a quality (or arguably lack of one) he’s observed in multiple colleagues, he said. They join the force precisely because it offers a well-defined culture to which they can readily assimilate. And there is no doubt police culture has been amplified and mythologized by Hollywood, through its crime procedurals and action thrillers—the police–entertainment complex.\n\nNowhere is this cultural ouroboros more evident than in the sitcom Brooklyn Nine-Nine (2013–2021), in which Andy Samberg’s fun-lovin’ Detective Jake Peralta—sure he’s immature as hell, but goddammit if he doesn’t have the best arrest rate in the precinct!—overtly and incessantly cites Die Hard as the precise reason he became a cop, even going so far as to name his firstborn son “McClane.” It’s a classic Hollywood setup: An Italian-American cop with a prized muscle car, unconfronted daddy issues, and a Die Hard fetish gets assigned to a precinct in Central Brooklyn… and comedy ensues!\n\nSamberg is two years my junior, meaning he’s part of the same cohort that grew up hero-worshipping John McClane. He’s a member of the home-video generation, like the Gen-X teens in Scream and technocapitalist-sociopath James Donovan Halliday (Mark Rylance) in Ready Player One, for whom popular entertainment became a kind of socioreligious belief system, and the VCR its study bible. Jake Peralta doesn’t consider himself an orphan of a bankrupt culture at all; like Halliday’s brainwashed protégé Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) and video-store virgin Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy), he’s a blissfully indoctrinated disciple of it .\n\nGee, I wonder if Samberg/Jake ever saw the Die Hard sequels… because they offer a far more instructive lesson as to what becomes of orphans of a bankrupt culture.\n\nLast Man Standing\n\nDespite also being set on Christmas Eve, there is little evidence to suggest so much as a single discussion has ever occurred as to whether Die Hard 2 qualifies as a Christmas movie. It’s not a film anyone talks about at all, really. I find that at least a little odd, since of all the sequels, Die Harder comes closest to recapturing the cowboy spirit of the original.\n\nIn Die Hard 2, set at Dulles International Airport, McClane is still the most capable man in a crisis, stymied by short-sighted bureaucrats and needlessly hostile local law enforcement. He still disdains technology (“As far as I’m concerned, progress peaked with frozen pizza,” he says). And he’s still comfortably violent, inventively dispatching bad guys by crushing one terrorist’s head in luggage flattener, stabbing another in the eye with an icicle, and kicking one through the whirring turbofan of a jet engine. Ya know—Christmassy stuff!\n\nThe only real difference is McClane and Holly are enjoying a renewed honeymoon period following the events of the first movie. But that—and several other characteristics of the franchise—would conspicuously change with the third Die Hard…\n\nBy Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995), which abandoned both the “contained thriller” approach and Christmas Eve setting of the first two films in favor of having McClane run his ass all over New York City in late summer, John and Holly have separated (for unspecified reasons), and are now living on opposing coasts once again. “He’s stepped on so many toes in this department, by this time next month he’s going to be a security guard,” McClane’s commanding officer comments. “His own wife wants nothing to do with him, and he’s about two steps shy of becoming a full-blown alcoholic.”\n\nExcept… it isn’t merely that McClane has seen better days; it’s that his character is hardly recognizable in Vengeance. While nominally “John McClane,” Willis has by all evidence reprised the wrong role here: that of burned-out detective Joe Hallenbeck from The Last Boy Scout. The Reaganite cowboy of the first two Die Hards is gone. No longer is McClane the smartest person in the room; in fact, he’s so hung over for most of the movie, new sidekick Zeus Carver (Samuel L. Jackson) is saddled with the task of deciphering the riddles in a high-stakes citywide game of Simon Says they’ve been coerced into playing by the villain (Jeremy Irons). Meanwhile, McClane and Zeus’ on-the-fly dialogues mostly consist of accusing one another of racism—to both considerable viewer discomfort and no discernable narrative purpose.\n\nOther than “redemption through violence,” the original Die Hard may not have been about all that much, but at least it had an unambiguous worldview: the individual is good; institutions are bad; formal education is snobby, pop culture is noble; foreign corporations empowering American feminists is the new threat to traditional gender roles. I suspect the reason for all that pointless bickering in Die Hard 3, even though racism has nothing to do with the movie’s theme (not that it has one) or the characters’ arcs (not that they have any), is because the movie has no appreciable weltanschauung, consciously or otherwise, so the filmmakers were overcompensating: The “buddy cops” have to talk about something, so why not skin color?\n\nExcept Die Hard with a Vengeance isn’t about racism, or vengeance (despite the title), or individualism (in this movie, it’s the police force that has its act together and McClane, under suspension at the start of the story, who’s mired in personal and professional dysfunction), or any discernable theme. It’s the second sequel to a hit movie whose DWAP formula had been so overfarmed throughout the early ’90s, and it’s desperately trying to come up with a new and bigger spin on an increasingly tired premise. As a narrative concept, Die Hard proved to be particularly susceptible to the law of diminishing returns.\n\nSo, it seems, did John McClane. Five years after his previous adventure, the former Reaganite cowboy, now an ostracized drunk, resurfaced to find himself irrelevant in the early years of the Clinton presidency and third-wave feminism. In the film’s original, unused ending, the villainous Simon Gruber actually succeeds, and McClane, suspected by the FBI as an accomplice to the heist, is fired from the NYPD. Some months later, McClane tracks Simon down in Hungary and murders him with premeditated sadism. This is far cry from the feel-good codas of the first two films, in which McClane and Holly ride off into the Christmas-morning sunrise to the romantic (and old-fashioned) tune of Vaughn Monroe’s “Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!”\n\nThough that uncharacteristically nihilistic climax was scrapped at the behest of the studio in favor of a conventional (and logic-defying) shootout sequence along the U.S.–Canadian border, complete with a hopeful dénouement in which a victorious McClane reaches out by payphone to his estranged wife, the John McClane we meet a dozen years later more closely resembles the man with nothing left to lose—which includes his family, sense of humor, and soul—from the intended epilogue of Die Hard 3.\n\nIn Live Free or Die Hard (2007), McClane stumbles into the plot of what could’ve been a season-long story arc on 24, in which cyberterrorists knock out the nation’s telecommunications capabilities and power grid. The villain (Timothy Olyphant) describes McClane as a “Timex watch in a digital age,” and is he ever. Holly has divorced him. His daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) openly hates him, and has even assumed her mother’s maiden name of Gennero. (Turns out, the threat to his masculinity first identified in Die Hard was not unfounded. Fuckin’ feminists…) And he’s saddled with escorting an “amusingly” manic, Millennial computer hacker (Justin Long) from New Jersey to D.C.; the obnoxious kid delights in denouncing everything McClane stands for, from neoliberal Reaganomics to classic rock.\n\nHe may still be a gainfully employed New York cop, but this is otherwise the down-and-out McClane from the discarded postlude of With a Vengeance. McClane keeps the wiseass one-liners a-comin’, just like the old days, but sans the yippie-ki-yay swagger from the first two films, or even the embittered cynicism of the third one. In other words: Die Hard with a Valium.\n\nDirector Len Wiseman shoots Live Free like a glossy technothriller, full of fluid camera movements in chrome-and-concrete environs; McClane’s usual apparel—wifebeater and trousers—is notably replaced here with an earth-toned ensemble—chocolate-brown leather jacket and army-green henley—to contrast him with all the besuited cyberterrorism agents and the film’s desaturated cyan color palette. McClane quite literally wears his analog-age values on his sleeve. (If only the characterization, alas, had been given half as much creative consideration as the costume design and cinematography.)\n\nIn this way, the John McClane of Live Free or Die Hard reminds me of latter-day Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) in Michael Mann’s Heat 2: a shell of his former self; a twentieth-century hero who had the misfortune of surviving—of dying hard?—to a new millennium that had no place for him. Watching Live Free, you can’t help but wonder: Was Jack Bauer not available to deal with this shit?\n\nThings get even weirder in A Good Day to Die Hard (2013), which takes McClane to Russia for a noisy and convoluted Bourne-style spy thriller. (Seriously.) Turns out, it isn’t just McClane’s wife and daughter who hate him; so does his estranged son (Jai Courtney). The bad-dad trifecta!\n\nSeems John Jr. (who now goes by Jack, because none of McClane’s relatives wish to be associated with him even by name) resented his father’s absence, growing up in California while McClane was drinking himself to death in New York. Despite having no one to model violent masculinity for him, Jack nonetheless grew up to be a CIA operative even more artfully adept at and comfortable with killing than his absentee father. However, like his fellow War on Terror–era action heroes Jack Bauer and Jason Bourne, and decidedly unlike his onetime Reaganite-cowboy father, no-nonsense Jack McClane has no sense of humor or appreciation for pop culture.\n\nBut by those days, John McClane didn’t have much of a sense of humor, either. (“Reagan is dead,” one of the bad guys reminds him, and I guess we’re meant to assume the Gipper’s spirit lives on—dies hard—in McClane?) So, when he and Jack Bauer team up to foil some byzantine Russian terrorist plot (I was too goddamn bored to even try to understand it), they discover blowing away bad guys is the best mode of family therapy.\n\nThe father/son relationship has all the simmering tension of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade minus any of its subtlety, wit, or emotional depth, but eventually John and Jack bond over their mutual love of pornographic carnage. After a tender moment of healing before the film’s climax, a warm-cockled McClane literally says, “All right, let’s go kill some motherfuckers.” Ah, the son becomes the father and the father, the son. And a new generation of righteous heroes comes of age!\n\nNobody’s Hero\n\nWhile Good Day is so braindead and artless it makes the original Die Hard look like a Godard film, it nonetheless bears that franchise hallmark of “redemption through violence.” Only in “killing some motherfuckers” can McClane and his son express their mutual affection and begin to heal the ties that bind, much the way violence paved the way for McClane and Holly’s reconciliation in the first film.\n\nAnd yet the arc of the Die Hard narrative—the story of McClane’s life, and that of Mann’s men Vincent Hanna and Neil McCauley’s, too—demonstrates that solitary, self-righteous heroes have a limited shelf life. That when you’re the most sensible, most capable person in a world full of half-witted plebeians, eventually there’s no place left for you in that world. The smartest guy in the room tends to be the loneliest. Just ask Ebenezer Scrooge, who justifies his perdurable antisocial misery by stating, “What else can I be when I live in such a world of fools as this?”\n\nYeah. Because being a solitary hero means exactly that: You are a solitary hero. (“Why are you now determined to prove that this Penguin is not what he seems?” Alfred the butler asks Bruce Wayne in Tim Burton’s 1992 Christmastime actioner Batman Returns. “Must you be the only lonely man-beast in town?”) Or as McClane himself explains it:\n\nYou know what you get for being a hero? Nothing. You get shot at. You get a little pat on the back—blah, blah, blah. Attaboy. You get divorced. A wife that can’t remember your last name. Kids don’t wanna talk to you. Get to eat a lot of meals by yourself. Trust me, kid—nobody wants to be that guy.\n\nFrom Live Free or Die Hard, screenplay by Mark Bomback\n\nNobody should want to. Except movies like Die Hard—and action heroes like John McClane—have systematically trained entire generations of moviegoers to celebrate that archetype, and even to aspire to its smarter-than-thou certitude in our everyday lives.\n\nIt isn’t merely that the original Die Hard brilliantly serves up cathartic violence and Christmas sentimentality in one delicious dish. Rather, it’s that it affirms the culturally ingrained presumption that we are, each of us, the sole voice of reason in a world of shitheads; that police culture is inherently noble (and state-sponsored violence, therefore, warranted); that obsessing over pop culture is itself virtuous. John McClane of Die Hard embodies the American birthright Reagan restored to a demoralized nation: that of Randian individualism, law and order, and conspicuous consumerism.\n\nSuch is the reason why Die Hard gets rewatched every Christmas while the sequels go overlooked: No one cares to be reminded that the guy who emerged triumphant for knowing better than anyone else wound up all alone, like Mr. Scrooge, taking his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern. At the holidays, we would much rather cheer on the guy McClane was: the profane wiseacre who acted like a self-righteous asshole with impunity and was rewarded for it. Die Hard thumbs its nose at the spirit of community championed by earnestly prosocial Christmas classics like It’s a Wonderful Life and How the Grinch Stole Christmas! It’s a Christmas movie for an audience that delights in the postmodern irony of citing Die Hard as its favorite Christmas movie.\n\nWhile I have moral reservations about Richard Donner’s Lethal Weapon, at least that Christmastime thriller was about a solitary hero (Mel Gibson’s Riggs) who finds healing in partnership (with Danny Glover’s Murtaugh), and eventually becomes integrated into a family—a family that expanded its membership with each sequel. All the characters had a permanent and vital place in that group, from Joe Pesci (Lethal Weapon 2) to Rene Russo (Lethal Weapon 3) to Chris Rock (Lethal Weapon 4); they all contributed something of value to the team.\n\nWhereas McClane’s circle of associates shrunk with each successive sequel, Riggs’ broadened—such was his cosmic reward for ultimately recognizing he was too old for this shit (that is, being violently vengeful). For my money, Lethal Weapon is arguably endowed with a far purer Christmas spirit—at least for a violent action movie—than Die Hard ever was. “Die Hard is a Christmas movie, I’ll give you that,” concedes film critic Richard Roeper. “Lethal Weapon is a Christmas story.”\n\nDoes Lethal Weapon, then, occupy a place in the Christmas-movie canon? Who knows. More to the point: Who gives a shit. Such a debate is, after all, exactly the kind of obsessive-compulsive elevation of disposable entertainment to essential literature that took root in the ’80s, was given steroidal amplification in the Internet Age, and has, nearly a quarter century into our new millennium, made us all willing agents—or, alternatively, hostage buyers—of a bankrupt culture, indefinitely consigned to a state of commercial adolescence.\n\nInquiries as to whether Die Hard is a Christmas movie—or which actor delivered the best interpretation of Clark Kent, or how the 007 theme songs stack up—are the kind of juvenile deliberations that once, within my lifetime, occurred exclusively on schoolyards; now there are blogs (including this one) and podcasts and YouTube videos devoted to endlessly relitigating such inconsequential nonsense in earnest.\n\nBecause this is what social media does: It puts arguments in front of you over and over again, tempting you to think that you just might be the one special person who can cut through the nonsense and be rewarded for your clarity and insight with attention from your peers. We all know that this is not true, and that we will fail, but that doesn’t make us stop. . . . This is the way in which many of us have chosen to live for most of the year. Must we live this way at Christmas, too?\n\nKaitlyn Tiffany, “Is [REDACTED] a Christmas Movie?”, Atlantic, December 24, 2021\n\nI recall another of Alfred’s wise observations from Batman Returns: “Sometimes it’s a diversion to read such rubbish. Most of the time, it’s a waste of time.” Hear, hear. Moving forward, I’m not sure I’m going to give any more of these bullshit debates oxygen. Such is my hopeful New Year’s resolution.\n\nIn that spirit, the salient question isn’t “Is Die Hard a Christmas movie?” Rather, it’s “Why are we still discussing this?”\n\nBetter yet: Why are we still watching Die Hard at all?\n\nShadows of Things\n\nFor me, Die Hard is most decidedly a Ghost of Christmas Past—and no longer a welcome one, at that. Some Christmas movies of yore still put me in touch with my then-me, like A Christmas Carol (1984), pretty much the only movie I ever watched with my late father (and, by my subjective appraisal, the best screen adaptation of the story), and Home Alone, the first movie I ever went by myself to the theater to see (and consequently learned, like Kevin McCallister, the not-insignificant difference between solitariness and solitude). The experience of watching those each Christmas is twofold: I remember what it felt like to see them the first time, as well as enjoy and appreciate their storytelling from the perspective of a middle-aged writer.\n\nTo be sure: I admire the scrappy filmmaking spirit of John McTiernan’s Die Hard. But to me the movie is a time capsule of the Reagan era, whose ethos I have come to actively oppose. I am a democratic eco-socialist, and I lament having lived my entire life in the neoliberal shitstorm Reagan welcomed—one of rising wealth inequality and carbon emissions, of increased instances of mass shootings and road rage. Like Reaganism itself, Die Hard is a movie I wish to God we’d leave behind in the twentieth century, not literally adapt as illustrated storybooks to read to our children at Christmas. As I’ve noted elsewhere:\n\nInterrogating the stories we have long taken for granted is healthy, especially the comforting ones. When the narratives and mythologies still feel helpful and true, resolving to do more to live up to them is also healthy. But when they no longer serve us, when they stand in the way of where we need to go, then we need to be willing to let them rest and tell some different stories.\n\nNaomi Klein, On Fire: The (Burning) Case for a Green New Deal (New York: Simon & Schuster, 2019), 173–74\n\nReflexive disdain for government and the normalization of violence are key selling points of the presidential campaign of next year’s likely GOP nominee. I suspect Die Hard, in its own small (but not insignificantly influential) way, helped condition the culture to accept and even adopt such a nihilistic mindset. I wonder if it would surprise the thirteen-year-old kid who used to regard Die Hard as a paragon of storytelling excellence that, thirty-five years later, his first novel would stand in opposition to the values it espouses?\n\nThe Dogcatcher is a horror/comedy about a municipal animal-control officer whose Upstate New York community is being terrorized by a cryptid. It’s a story about the crucial role our public servants and institutions play in civil society, the moral obligations and social responsibilities we have to one another; it champions a spirit of We’re in this together that is all but absent from the movies and television shows that have been produced in my lifetime. (And it eschews pop culture–heavy dialogue, a persistent and tiresome artifact of ’90s screenwriting I can’t tolerate.) Donating my Die Hard DVDs to the public library and publishing The Dogcatcher, both of which I did this past year, is my small way of honoring Naomi Klein’s recommendation—to let old stories rest in favor of producing new narratives.\n\nSome old narratives, admittedly, still feel helpful and true. I’m reminded of this passage from the granddaddy of all Christmas stories, itself a screed against the kind of 19th-century industrial capitalism that seems downright quaint when measured against globalized neoliberalism:\n\nBut I am sure I have always thought of Christmas time, when it has come round—apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that—as a good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys.\n\nCharles Dickens, A Christmas Carol, 1843\n\nWith its Randian ethos and redemption-through-violence message, that sure as shit doesn’t describe Die Hard. Is it a fun movie? Sure. Is it a Christmas movie? Not for me it isn’t; you decide for yourself. Its values aren’t anything I care to celebrate, at Christmas or otherwise.\n\nPretending to be John McClane at thirteen was a blast; in 2023, navigating a world full of John McClanes, of “everyday heroes” for whom the rest of us are bit players in their personal heroic narratives—idiots who won’t get out of their way, not fellow passengers to the grave—is dispiriting and exhausting. Even Andy Samberg, who produced and starred in an Emmy Awards–honored tribute to Die Hard, had a come-to-Jesus epiphany on this matter:\n\nBrooklyn [Nine-Nine] is facing a significant challenge in the wake of George Floyd’s killing by a police officer. “The writers are all rethinking how we’re going to move forward,” Samberg, who also exec produces the series, told People in July. “[Everyone is] discussing how you make a comedy show about police right now, and if we can find a way of doing that that we all feel morally OK about? I know that we’ll figure it out, but it’s definitely a challenge.”\n\nLesley Goldberg, “‘Brooklyn Nine-Nine’ to End With Abbreviated, Delayed Season 8 on NBC,” Hollywood Reporter, February 11, 2021\n\nWhat they figured out was that the sun had to set on the fictional 99th Precinct. When Brooklyn Nine-Nine returned for its belated ten-episode eighth season in 2021, Jake’s partner Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz), motivated by the George Floyd protests, had quit the force. Jake briefly tries to prove he’s one of the “good ones,” but by series’ end he, too, has retired from the NYPD to be a stay-at-home dad—the very thing his proudly recalcitrant idol John McClane never did. Good for Jake.\n\n“Men’s courses will foreshadow certain ends, to which, if persevered in, they must lead,” Charles Dickens wrote. “But if the courses be departed from, the ends will change.” Jake—and, really, Samberg—at some point realized Die Hard is a stupid, even arguably dangerous, movie to venerate. And so, putting his money where his mouth is, he let it go. So did I. As Dickens himself would’ve surely concurred, redemption-through-humility makes for a much better Christmas story.\n\n2023 was the first full year in which I reduced my blogging output from monthly to quarterly; I reallocated that time and creative energy for The Dogcatcher. Given how much fiction I intend to produce in the coming years, I may blog less frequently still in 2024. The blog’s 120 posts will remain open for comments, and new essays will continue to be published here, however irregularly. I appreciate the support I’ve received this past year with respect to both the blog and The Dogcatcher, and I wish one and all a happy holiday season and healthy, prosperous, peaceful New Year!\n\nFootnotes"
