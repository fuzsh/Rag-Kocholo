        "text": "Bodybuilder-turned-actor Arnold Schwarzenegger ruled the action genre at one point in his decorated acting career. Working with the legend is bound to give cold feet to the new-age actors. The Mindy Project actor, Adam Pally, was no different. Pally recently gave a detailed account of his experience working with Schwarzenegger.\n\nAdam Pally recently appeared on a late-night talk show to promote his upcoming movie ‘Who invited Charlie?’ Among the other topics, Pally opened up about why he feels offended when people ask about what he’s watching.

The interview featured the 40-year-old American comedian and actor, Adam Pally, who worked with Arnold Schwarzenegger in a Netflix original action series. Remembering the shoot, the Happy ending alum said, “I did a little action…On my first day, I was a little nervous. We were strapped together in a tandem parachute. It was nerve-wracking, you know.” Narrating Schwarzenegger’s response to the nervous wreck that Pally was, he added, “And, like, he smelled it on me right away.”\n\nImitating Arnie, he added, “This is your first time in a parachute?” What happened next made everyone burst out in a fit of laughter. After getting a yes from Pally, Schwarzenegger turned and started talking to his crew in Austrian and laughing. This left the Jewish boy, who did not understand the language, stunned. Later, he realized they were discussing how nervous he was since it was his first time. The next time Arnie turned to him, Pally asked what they were saying. To this, Schwarzenegger casually replied, “Oh! This said you’re not gonna like it.” On this, a flabbergasted Pally exclaimed, “That’s all they said? Their conversation went on for like an hour!”\n\nRead More: 7x Mr. Olympia Arnold Schwarzenegger Once Was Baffled by 33 Years Younger Hollywood Superstar’s Ripped Physique: “The Body Was Really Extraordinary”\n\nHowever, summarizing his experience of working with the legend, Pally says it felt like a “fever dream.” While Schwarzenegger is known to make people around him nervous, there was a time when the Australian Oak felt nervous too.\n\nThe ever-confident Arnold Schwarzenegger was nervous.
