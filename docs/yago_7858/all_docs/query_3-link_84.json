        "text": "One of cinema’s great debates has become as much of a Christmas tradition as putting up the stockings: Is Die Hard a Christmas film?\n\nAround this time every year, fans go back and forth discussing whether the Bruce Willis classic should be in the same category as holiday movies Christmas Vacation, Christmas Carol, Home Alone and so on.\n\nThe film was released in July 1988, but the plot events take place on Christmas Eve.\n\nPerhaps helping to finally turn the tide, Die Hard screenwriter Steven E. de Souza weighed in via Twitter, responding to a fan who wrote, “DH is about love, devotion, sacrifice, generosity, and resisting evil — how could it not be a Christmas movie?”\n\nDe Souza added, “Plus a woman about to give birth features prominently.” He even joked Fox “rejected the Purim draft,” using the hashtag “Die Hard Is A Christmas Movie.”\n\nDie Hard stars Willis, Bonnie Bedelia, Reginald VelJohnson and the late Alan Rickman."
