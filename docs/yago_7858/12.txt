Arnold's Wrecking Co. is a very bad movie with bad acting and a bad plot that would never work. Arnold (played by Mike Renshaw) owns his own drug company that sponsors little league teams and appears at major hotel chains. It all starts out when Kenny (played by Steve De Souza) and his friend Rollo (played by Edie Henderson) try to turn Kenny's nerdy cousin into a drug addict. After resisting, Arnold gives in and enjoys the drug. After realizing how much his cousin paid for the drug, Arnold decides to eliminate the middle man in the drug business, and make his own company that sells drugs, that's right sells drugs. In a matter of a few hours, Arnold gets his own company (Arnold's Wrecking Company), office building, and a few dozen workers (mostly spouses of the stars of the film). After a few months, AWC becomes profitable. But now, a bad acting police man is investigating the drug chain. This film is filled with bad acting, especially Edie Henderson. The only thing decent about this movie is the movie within the move "The Story of Dope" and the somewhat decent soundtrack. Don't waste your time, skip this movie!
