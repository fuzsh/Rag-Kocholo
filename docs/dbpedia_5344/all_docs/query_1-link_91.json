        "text": "Construction Updates\n\nConstruction Site and Permit Tracker\n\nThis construction/Permit tracker represents all Active/current Street permits, including Street opening, Street occupancies and Lead pipe replacements. This tracker is updated on a weekly basis. You can also find a particular permit and its details in our Permit Database.\n\nIf you have additional questions or difficulty using this map tracker, please contact Public Works at 617-466-4200.\n\nalign=\"right\"\n\nInfrastructure + Transportation\n\nLatest updates (as January 2024)\n\nChelsea DPW continues to move forward with our project to requalify for Quiet Zone status along the commuter rail corridor. The plans require significant review and approval by both local and federal agencies.\n\nThe project includes two parts: the upgrades of the gates and lights at the intersections as well as improvements to the software that controls how the trains and the signals communicate with each other.\n\nFor example, the new safety features will automatically make a train slow down and stop if a vehicle is detected stuck on the tracks.\n\nWe hope to receive approval to begin work on the intersections this spring.\n\nUnfortunately, the signal improvements are more technically complex and rely on other changes being made by the MBTA. The full Quiet Zone may not be complete for over a year.\n\nWe know this is disappointing but the safety of drivers and pedestrians is critical and until these changes are approved and complete, the train horns are the best way to keep everyone safe.\n\nThe Tobin bridge is over 75 years old and has been painted over a number of times and that old paint has become brittle. MassDOT has been working in the area for the past several months and vacuuming up paint chips that have fallen from the bridge. The paint chips are then being disposed of offsite in accordance with environmental regulations.\n\nChelsea Paint Chip Clean-up Schedule (4/17/2024)\n\nThe paint chips from the Tobin are known to contain lead, which can cause serious health issues in children. Do not handle or ingest any paint chips and do not allow children to play with paint chips.\n\nA Community hotline has been established (English & Spanish) for questions/concerns: 857-492-0221.\n\nThe paint chip cleanup is being followed by a $100 million-plus project to repair steel, remove old paint and repaint the bridge. Work includes:\n\nPutting up temporary protective shielding/work platforms\n\nCleaning steel, removing old paint, and repainting\n\nMaking repairs to existing steel superstructure elements\n\nCheck the latest updates on the Construction Schedule on the city's Traffic Advisory page.\n\nThe 911 Dispatch Center is a critical part of our public safety infrastructure, and the building has reached its usefulness and needs to be significantly renovated.\n\nThe total cost is $3.9M for design, construction, and temporary relocation of the staff. Fully funded with ARPA funding, this project represents a major investment in the City's Public Safety.\n\nThere will be a significant construction impact, particularly with parking in the City Hall lot. Construction is expected to be completed in the Fall of 2024.\n\nUtility, Road, and Traffic Improvements\n\nThe work consists of new water, sewage, and drainage utility installation and service connections on Central Avenue, Willow Street, Watts Street, and a small portion of Eastern Ave. Subsequently, sidewalks, roadways, and ramps will be rendered along the project limits. This project runs concurrently with the Innes Apartments Redevelopment Project.\n\nProject Components\n\nUtility Work: Combined sewer separation, new gravity sewers, storm drains, and water main and service alterations.\n\nRoad Work: Full width pavement reclamation and overlay, reset granite curb, curb extensions, new concrete and bituminous sidewalks, pedestrian curb ramps, and driveway aprons, new traffic signal at Central Ave. / Willow St., street lighting, new pavement markings and signs, decorative crosswalk markings and new street trees.\n\nLatest updates (as of July 12, 2024)\n\nTwo week look ahead:\n\nInstallation of drain line on Central Ave from Eastern Ave up to Willow St begins Wednesday, 9/17. Work will take two weeks.\n\nFor more information regarding this project, please contact:\n\nJorman Mota, City of Chelsea, Department of Public Works, Assistant City Engineer, (857) 206-4750\n\nAfter completing the water and sewer improvements in 2022, the City of Chelsea is pleased to announce the Upper Broadway Drainage and Surface Project, an effort to improve the safety and operations of Broadway between City Hall Ave. and Route 16. Funded through a $11 million federal grant, the project will include the reconstruction of drainage, sidewalk, roadway, and traffic signal infrastructure.\n\nThe project area extends down Broadway from Marlborough Street through Clinton Street to the Chelsea-Revere border. The projected completion date is April 2025. The State, through the Mass Department of Transportation (MassDOT), has hired Aqua Line Utility, a construction contractor, to carry out this work. Per federal requirements, MassDOT will administer the construction phase.\n\nExisting issues such as bus stop spacing, insufficient rider amenities, narrow/congested sidewalks, accessibility challenges, and service delays will all be addressed during the construction. Project goals are improving intersection safety, reducing congestion, and enhancing pedestrian/bike/transit accommodations.\n\nImprovements include new sidewalks, bus stops, bike lanes, parking areas, and appropriate turning lanes at intersections. Signal technology and equipment upgrades will be installed at the four signalized intersections in the project area. New pavement will be installed, new/reset granite curbing will be featured, and ADA/AAB-compliant sidewalks and curb ramps will be featured. New signage and pavement markings will be included. Damaged or unhealthy trees along Broadway will be replaced with new native tree species.\n\nCommunity Meeting Presentation - April 11, 2023\n\nLatest updates (as of July 12, 2024)\n\nThe sidewalk and roadway rehabilitation for the Upper Broadway corridor is underway; projected completion date is April 2025. Construction occurs Monday through Friday from 7 AM to 3:30 PM.\n\nTwo week look ahead:\n\nPaving on the final stretch of roadway from Stockton St to Cabot St will take place on Tuesday, 7/16.\n\nCurrently resetting curb on Broadway northbound from Cary Ave to Eleanor St. Concrete will be poured next week then the crew will move to the southbound side.\n\nFor additional questions: Elias Pomales | Const. Manager/Project Engineer, 857.343.4250, epomales@chelseama.gov\n\nThis work will take place from 7AM to 4PM daily, Monday thru Friday. On-street parking is prohibited during the times and dates posted on the construction signage distributed throughout work zone. We kindly ask that you do not park in these areas. One lane of travel will remain open on Broadway and sidewalks will remain accessible.\n\nLatest updates (as of July 12, 2024)\n\nTwo week look ahead:\n\nWater line on 4th to be completed by the end of next week.\n\nSewer installation on the south/east side of Broadway starting next week.\n\nFor questions, concerns, or to be added to an email list for project updates, please the contact City Hall at 617-466-4209 or email construction@chelseama.gov. More project information at chelseama.gov/broadwayconstruction.\n\nOpen Space & Resiliency\n\nThe cemetery, an important facet of the City's rich heritage, is a historic and cultural resource for the City, yet it has fallen into disrepair. Its original design represented a major step forward in the development of the modern cemetery design. Restoration has been historically deferred due to complexity and lack of resources. The 2018 master plan for the cemetery identified the components of a major rehabilitation project necessary to reopen the cemetery for public use and enjoyment. Restoration of this important historic asset will eventually enable public access to the cemetery.\n\nLatest updates (as March 30, 2022)\n\nGarden Cemetery (Phase III)\n\nAfter completing Phase II of the restoration program, the City, in consultation with its landscape architect, CBA Landscape Architects, is undertaking the design of Phase 3. Phase 3 entails the restoration of crypts, 100 grave stones, and interior pathways, coupled with tree planting and landscaping. Presently, the City's historic preservation consultant is finalizing the gravestone restoration plans, after the City expanded the number of grave stones subject to restoration. Subsequently, a construction contractor will be procured, with a targeted construction start date of Fall 2022.\n\nChelsea Garden Cemetery Master Plan\n\nHousing\n\nRegular construction updates are available at https://info.chelseainnesapts.com/\n\nResidents that would like to receive the 60-day construction updates going forward are encouraged to sign up for the emails and/or paper postings by contacting jmc@jmcandco.com or calling (781) 849-7111 to provide their contact information.\n\n25 Sixth Street offers 56 affordable apartments and six homes for sale in downtown Chelsea.
