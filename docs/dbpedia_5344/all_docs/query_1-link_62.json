        "text": "This week, as the Democratic National Committee was preparing to announce that Philadelphia will host the Party’s 2016 convention, Hillary Clinton’s still undeclared Presidential campaign was running into a media squall about money—two of them, actually. First, David Brock, the conservative activist turned liberal activist, resigned from Priorities USA Action, a big money-raising group that is supporting Clinton, and accused the group of taking part in an “orchestrated political hit job” on two other pro-Clinton groups that Brock is involved with. Then, the Guardian revealed that a number of wealthy donors to the Clinton Foundation, a philanthropic organization set up by Bill Clinton, were clients of the Swiss division of H.S.B.C., a big bank that is embroiled in a tax-avoidance scandal.\n\nThe upshot of the Brock story was that Hillary’s money guys and gals are squabbling, and that Priorities USA Action, the political-action committee that spent seventy-five million dollars supporting Barack Obama, in 2012, is off to a slow start this year. (According to Politico, it had less than half a million dollars in the bank at the end of 2014.) The Guardian story, which was based on leaked documents from H.S.B.C., identified seven rich donors to the Clinton Foundation who had bank accounts at H.S.B.C.’s Geneva branch. One of them, Richard Caring, a British entrepreneur, “used his tax-free Geneva account to transfer $1m into the New York-based foundation,” the newspaper reported. “The HSBC records suggest Caring’s $1m donation was paid in return for former president Bill Clinton’s attendance at a lavish costume charity ball organised by Caring in St Petersburg, Russia.”\n\nOutside of the political bubble, I doubt that one likely 2016 voter in twenty noticed either of these articles, or the follow-ups. But, at a moment when Hillary is reported to be consulting with numerous experts about how to tackle rising inequality, the articles raise anew an awkward question: How far will the Clinton family’s ties to moneyed interests complicate Hillary’s efforts to fashion a populist campaign built around the theme of defending the middle class?\n\nOne way of seeking to answer that question is to point out that, in politics (and philanthropy, too), cultivating donors and raising a lot of money are unavoidable parts of the business. And, although some people, myself among them, will never be wholly persuaded that he who pays the piper doesn’t call the tune, the average voter doesn’t seem to judge candidates by their financial backers. In 2008, and, to a lesser extent, 2012, Barack Obama’s campaign received a lot of cash from Wall Street. That didn’t prevent him from running as an agent of change, and as someone who was willing to take on vested interests. Hillary, too, has already shown some aptitude in this regard. After falling behind Obama in the campaign of 2007 and 2008, when she seemed to lack a defining theme, she did a pretty good job of reinventing herself as a scrappy fighter for the working stiff, even if, ultimately, it wasn’t enough to save her campaign.\n\nPerhaps Clinton can recapture the spirit and message she displayed in the summer and fall of 2008. First, though, she will need to reinforce her defenses against the attacks that are sure to come from the left and the right.\n\nOne way to do that is to put together a formidable campaign apparatus and a big war chest. Until the Brock story broke, few people in the political world had believed that these objectives would present a major issue. Evidently, they might. The first task facing John Podesta, the departing White House official who is slated to become chairman of the Clinton campaign, will be to gather together the various Democratic fund-raising groups and persuade them to coöperate. That won’t necessarily be easy. The Brock flap made clear that there are residual tensions between veteran Clintonites, like Brock, and some Obamaites who are preparing to support Hillary. Priorities USA Action was created by two former officials of the Obama Administration, and its co-chairman is Jim Messina, Obama’s 2012 campaign manager. In a Times article that appeared after Brock’s departure, Nicholas Confessore and Amy Chozick noted that “the marriage between the two camps … now appears more uneasy than at any time since Mr. Obama asked Mrs. Clinton to serve in his administration after the 2008 election.”\n\nThe issues relating to the Clinton Foundation, which Bill Clinton founded in 2001, go beyond internecine conflict and bruised egos. Some people close to the Clintons have long been concerned that the foundation’s biggest venture, the Clinton Global Initiative, could present some vulnerabilities for Hillary. In its own words, the C.G.I. “convenes global leaders to create and implement innovative solutions to the world’s most pressing challenges,” For years, it was managed by a handful of longtime aides to Bill Clinton, at least one of whom, Douglas Band, also acted as a highly paid consultant to some of its corporate donors—a fact highlighted in a lengthy 2013 Times article by Confessore and Chozick. The C.G.I.’s high-profile annual conferences, which bring together politicians, chief executives, and celebrities, have always attracted as much attention, or more, than its efforts to tackle problems like hunger, disease, and environmental degradation. Plus, there has been lingering suspicion that some of the organization’s donors were motivated by a desire to gain access to the Clintons.\n\nIn the past couple of years, perhaps partly in an effort to counter some of these concerns, the Clinton Foundation and the C.G.I. have both been overhauled. A new leadership team was appointed to the foundation, Band left the C.G.I., and Hillary and Chelsea Clinton took much more central roles. Today, they are both directors of the Clinton Foundation, and Chelsea is its vice-chair. The Clinton Foundation’s Web site says that she “focuses especially on the Foundation’s health programs, including the Clinton Health Access Initiative, which strengthens health care and access to lifesaving services in the developing world; the Alliance for a Healthier Generation, which fights childhood obesity in the United States; and the Clinton Health Matters Initiative, which addresses preventable disease in the United States.” In 2013, the foundation was officially renamed as the Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea Clinton Foundation, and last month a longtime aide to Hillary, Maura Pally, was appointed as its interim chief executive.\n\nThe Guardian story, by highlighting the fact that some of the Clinton Foundation’s donors have been maintaining bank accounts in Switzerland, has focussed attention on its sources of financing rather than its makeover or its philanthropic activities. Among the donors named by the Guardian were the British retail mogul Richard Caring; Frank Giustra, a Canadian mining magnate who appeared earlier this week at C.G.I.’s annual winter meeting, in New York; and Jeffrey Epstein, a New York financier who was jailed in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from underage girls. According to the Clinton Foundation’s donor database, Giustra and charities linked to him have donated at least fifty million dollars. In 2006, Epstein gave twenty-five thousand dollars, the Guardian said. Other donors to the foundation who were identified as clients of H.S.B.C.’s Geneva office included Eli Broad, the Californian entrepreneur and philanthropist, and Denise Rich, whose former husband, the fugitive commodities trader Marc Rich, was pardoned by Bill Clinton just before he left office, in 2001.\n\nThe Guardian was careful to avoid any suggestion of illegality. “It is not unlawful for US or other non-Swiss citizens to hold accounts in Geneva and there is no evidence any of the Clinton donors with Geneva accounts evaded tax,” the story said. The paper cited lawyers for Giustra saying his H.S.B.C. account was for investment purposes and complied with Canadian laws. Caring was “legitimately permitted to keep his assets offshore by a hereditary quirk of UK tax law, under which he is registered as ‘non-domiciled’, courtesy of his Italian-American father,” the story noted. And, in addition, “it is not against US law or charity regulation to accept donations from non-US citizens, or from overseas accounts.”\n\nStill, to the public at large, Swiss bank accounts are often associated with tax avoidance. In Britain, the allegation that H.S.B.C. helped some of its wealthy clients dodge taxes has become a hot political issue. The Guardian story quoted a speech that Hillary gave at a C.G.I. meeting in 2012, when she said, “One of the issues that I have been preaching about around the world is collecting taxes in an equitable manner, especially from the elites in every country.... There are rich people everywhere. And yet they do not contribute to the growth of their own countries. They don’t invest in public schools, in public hospitals, in other kinds of development internally.”\n\nWhat should we make of all this? In a statement to the Guardian, a spokesman for the Clinton Foundation, Craig Minassian, said, “We are a philanthropy through and through, and we take pride in our programs, our efficiency, and our transparency.... The Clinton Foundation has strong donor integrity and transparency practices that go well beyond what is required of US charities, including the full disclosure of all of our donors. The contributions of these donors are helping improve the lives of millions of people across the world.”\n\nThe organization has some evidence to back up this claim. Unlike other philanthropies, C.G.I. doesn’t hand out grants or develop its own programs from scratch, such as building schools and hospitals in Africa. Instead, it identifies specific challenges somewhere in the world, solicits commitments from governments and nongovernmental organizations to meet them, finds corporate sponsors willing to finance the projects, and undertakes to help out with expertise, contacts, and encouragement. Last year, it released the results of an internal review of nearly three thousand such commitments made since 2005. The review concluded that they had affected the lives of four hundred and thirty million people in a hundred and eighty countries.\n\nTo be sure, this was an internal study, which relied on data provided by C.G.I.’s partners. An independent appraisal would have carried more weight. But when you read about some of the projects C.G.I. is involved with, as I have been doing, it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that its staff of three hundred and fifty people is doing some good in the world—or, at least, trying to do good. Here, selected more or less at random, are a few examples:\n\nIn 2007, C.G.I. teamed up with F.H.I. 360, a New York-based not-for-profit that, among other things, promotes family planning and reproductive health in poor countries. F.H.I. 360 made a commitment to increase the number of women and children it tested for H.I.V./AIDS, and to provide antiretroviral therapy for those who tested positive. By 2012, according to an update on the C.G.I.’s website, F.H.I. 360 had tested more than four million women and children, in such countries as Kenya and Rwanda, and had enrolled nearly thirty thousand children in retroviral therapy.\n\nIn 2010, C.G.I. partnered with the Mexican government, a classical-music foundation, and a bus company called Estrella Blanca to expand youth orchestras throughout Mexico. By September of 2013, according to a press release from C.G.I., this effort had established working orchestras in twenty-nine of Mexico’s thirty-one states, serving more than ten thousand young musicians.\n\nIn 2011, C.G.I. partnered with Women for Women International, a Washington, D.C.-based charitable organization, to help female farmers in the war-torn Democratic Republic of the Congo. Women for Women International committed to enrolling ten thousand Congolese women in a series of classes covering topics like crop rotation, numeracy, and coöperation with other farmers. By March of 2014, according to a C.G.I. update, more than six thousand women had taken the classes, and twenty-seven new farming coöperatives had been formed.\n\nWould some of the many projects with which C.G.I. is involved have gone ahead anyway, without its intervention? Perhaps. But in bringing together charitable organizations and corporations looking to make philanthropic donations, it has carved out a unique role. In the words of Tom Watson, the founder of Cause Wired, a consulting firm that advises not-for-profits, “It’s an investment banking service—old style—for causes and philanthropy.” These days, investment banks aren’t exactly popular, of course. When they were originally formed, however, they played a valuable role in raising capital for entrepreneurs and businesses that needed funding. C.G.I. does the same for not-for-profits."
