        "text": "She was born when her father, Bill Clinton, was governor of Arkansas and grew up inside the White House.\n\nBut tonight Chelsea Clinton, 36, makes her most high-profile appearance on the political stage when she introduces her mother, Hillary Clinton, the first woman to win a major party's nomination and Donald Trump's opponent in the general election this November.\n\nFor years, Chelsea Clinton's parents protected her from the spotlight - a practice she continued as an adult until she started doing select magazine interviews several years ago. She also served a stint as a correspondent for NBC News.\n\nHere's a quick rundown of the person she has become.\n\nFamily life: She married hedge-fund manager Marc Mezvinsky, whose mother, Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, was a member of Congress. They have a daughter, Charlotte, who turns two in September, and a son, Aidan, who was born in June. They live in Manhattan.\n\nScholarly pursuits: She graduated from Stanford University with a history degree and holds a master's degree in international relations from Oxford University. After a stint on Wall Street, she earned a master's degree in public health from Columbia University and a PhD from Oxford University.\n\nSo many professional hats: She is vice president of the Clinton Foundation, which funds and launches projects on global health, climate change and female empowerment.\n\nShe spent six years in the private sector, worked for the Wall Street consulting firm McKinsey & Company and a hedge fund.\n\nShe was a special correspondent for NBC News, earning $600,000, according to Politico. Media critics sharply questioned the hire.\n\nTrivia: Her Secret Service codename was \"Energy.\" Her speeches have fetched $65,000 a pop, which is donated to the foundation. She skipped the third grade and studied ballet."
