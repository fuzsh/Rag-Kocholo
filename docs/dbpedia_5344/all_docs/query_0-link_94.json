        "text": "By Mark Schnyder\n\nLOUISVILLE (WAVE) -- The Clinton machine continues to roll through Indiana. Friday, Chelsea Clinton spent time in four small towns. Her first stop was in front of about 900 people in Salem. But as WAVE 3's Mark Schnyder reports, almost none of those people can vote for her mother.\n\nChelsea Clinton spent the morning at Salem Middle School with some of the best behaved kids I've ever seen. But none of them have a voter registration card. However, the 500-plus 12, 13 and 14 year olds did show an interest in the political process.\n\nSchool kids would go to anything if it means an hour out of class. But this was a most unusual opportunity. Presidential primary campaign stops in Indiana haven't happened in 40 years. Now they happen almost daily.\n\nThe questions tossed at Chelsea weren't as policy driven as they typically are when adults are asking the questions.\n\n\"Oh gosh, no,\" said Chelsea responding to a child's question. \"Her question was do I think I would ever run for president? No.\"\n\n\"Someone asked me recently if I thought my mom would be a better president than my father and I said that I did,\" said Chelsea. \"And I believe that she will be a better president because she's more prepared.\"\n\nBut when Chelsea is asked what her mother would do about social security, gas prices, the war, etc, she is ready with detailed answers. I wanted to ask Chelsea how she remembers all this stuff and how she liked meeting the people of rural Indiana, but the campaign advisor traveling with Chelsea told us not to approach her. The 28-year old who's getting a lot of air time these days, does not do interviews -- period.\n\nI approached the senior Clinton advisor traveling with Chelsea, Philippe Reines. I asked Reines, \"I realize she's not a candidate, but most candidates or people that campaign for them will take 5 minutes to talk to the media afterwards, why does she refuse to do that?\"\n\nReines response did not answer my question.\n\n\"I think what she's doing is very unique,\" he said. \"I think not a lot of people take an hour to just answer questions. A lot of people deliver speeches. She gets on stage and says what's on your mind?\"\n\nMost of the students got exactly what they were looking for - a social studies lesson not found in textbooks.\n\n\"I think she's gonna do a lot for us,\" said one sixth-grader.\n\nWhen I asked another sixth-grader what they liked about having Chelsea Clinton come to your school, they replied, \"To see what actually is going on around about George W. Bush and other presidents. I'm probably going to vote for her. (I mean) My parents (will).\"\n\n\"She talked about important subjects and stuff so it was really important,\" said another sixth-grader.\n\nWhen Chelsea was middle school aged, she was living in the White House and the students knew it. One girl asked Chelsea if she ever got to have slumber parties in the White House to which she said, \"Oh yeah.\"\n\nHillary Clinton will be back in the Hoosier state Saturday with campaign stops in Fort Wayne and South Bend. Bill Clinton will make four stops on Sunday in central Indiana including one in New Castle."
