        "text": "— There are lots of folks in Arkansas with an interesting Chelsea Clinton tale.\n\nChelsea Victoria Clinton was, after all, born in Little Rock in 1980 during Bill Clinton’s first term as governor, and we watched her grow up, take dance classes and attend public school.\n\nMy contribution is watching Chelsea and her dad, then-Gov. Bill Clinton, enjoying a private moment at the zoo. She was 4 years old and fascinated by the elephants. It was an iconic father/daughter moment.\n\nChelsea was 12 when the family packed off to the White House, and we haven’t seen much of her since thanks to the Clintons’ efforts to allow her to grow up as normal as possible.\n\nBut we’ve watched from afar as Chelsea turned into a poised and confident woman.\n\nShe has been busy. Chelsea studied at Stanford, Oxford and Columbia universities. She’s currently pursuing a doctorate at Oxford and working at New York University.\n\nOh, yeah. Chelsea and longtime beau Marc Mezvinsky finally got hitched last year.\n\nOn the job front, Chelsea has worked at the New York consulting firm McKinsey & Co. and the global investment firm Avenue Capital Group. In addition, she serves on the boards of the Clinton Foundation, the School of American Ballet, Common Sense Media, the Weill Cornell Medical College and the Internet media company IAC/InterActiveCorp.\n\nAll of that, fellow slackers, by age 31. Now, Clinton has been named a special correspondent for NBC News.\n\nWe’ll be able to see her on Rock Center With Brian Williams reporting stories within the “Making a Difference” segments.\n\nI think this is a swell idea. After all, George W. Bush’s 29-year-old daughter Jenna Bush Hager has a gig as a monthly education correspondent for NBC’s Today show.\n\nWhen Chelsea’s hiring was announced last week, Williams said, “Our ‘Making a Difference’ segments have become a signature of the broadcast. They adhere to a simple goal of highlighting the good works being done across the country and around the world.\n\n“Chelsea Clinton has led a remarkable life. She possesses an uncommon understanding of humanity - on city streets, across this country and around the globe.”\n\nChelsea told NBC News, “People who imagine and implement solutions to challenges in their own lives, in their communities, in our country and in our world have always inspired me. I hope telling [these] stories will help me to live my grandmother’s adage of ‘Life is not about what happens to you, but about what you do with what happens to you.’”\n\nRock Center With Brian Williams airs at 9 p.m. Mondays on NBC.\n\nMonkey shines.\n\nAETN is planning “a three-movie Holiday Spectacular event” Wednesday morning. Gather the kiddies and pass the bananas.\n\nCurious George airs at 7 a.m., followed by Curious George 2: Follow That Monkey at 8:30 and Curious George: A Very Monkey Christmas at 10.\n\nThat’ll occupy the little rugrats until 11 a.m.\n\nDiscussion questions for after the event: Since he has no tail, what kind of monkey is George? Why, exactly, is George so curious? And why did the film’s producers decide that the never-named Man With the Yellow Hat must be called Ted in the movie?\n\nFinally, what’s with his all-yellow outfit? Dude looks like a big banana himself.\n\nSeries moved.\n\nIf you’ve lost A&E’s Storage Wars, it might be because the series has a new night. Look for new episodes at 9 p.m. today.\n\nAt 4.7 million viewers, this is A&E’s most-watched series of all time. It involves storage lockers, unpaid rent and auctioneers.\n\nWait. There’s more.\n\nAt 9:30 p.m. Dec. 6, Storage Wars: Texas debuts. There’s a thrift store and its owner and a bidder fellow and more auctions. Only these are Texans. See the difference?\n\nThe TV Column appears Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday. E-mail:"
