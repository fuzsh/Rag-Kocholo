        "text": "💸 \"A single dollar invested in women's health yields a three-dollar growth return\" 💸 Thrilled to have been invited to a symposium hosted by Deputy Marie-Pierre Rixain at the National Assembly yesterday, focusing on the crucial role of women's health in our economy and society. 🔍 Key Insights 🔍 🏥 Elyès Jouini highlighted the critical but neglected role of gender in health outcomes, noting that women face more severe secondary effects in conditions from asthma to neurodegenerative diseases. This points to a significant oversight in clinical trials—a shortfall in gender-specific analysis, impeding the creation of inclusive treatments. 💰 The investment in the health and FemTech sector, poised to hit $50 billion by 2025, faces significant hurdles, including funding and market access. This calls for a concerted effort to remove these barriers and unlock the full potential of the sector (Maya Noël, Clémence Lejeune, Juliette Mauro, Romain Sion) 📣 Marine Darnault highlighted the importance of recognizing women's health as a critical public health issue, urging action from both private and public sectors. 👉 A fascinating theme I've been working on for the last few months with Chloé Geoffroy. Beyond biological sex, it's essential to consider gender, age, body shape, ethnic origin, and environmental factors to more effectively treat populations. And We are convinced that AI can help us achieve this. A heartfelt thank you for this inspiring event. Moments like these reaffirm my commitment to pushing boundaries and working towards a future where healthcare is inclusive and equitable for everyone. #InclusiveHealthcare #AI\n\nSetting in motion. The word \"hormones\" comes from the Greek word \"ὁρμή\" (hormē), which means \"impetus\" or \"urge.\" The term was first introduced by the English physiologist Ernest Starling in 1905, who used it to describe chemical messengers produced by endocrine glands that travel through the bloodstream to regulate physiological processes in the body. The hosts of our conference and panel last week in London where two experts in hormones: Dr Nicky Keay & Prof Joyce Harper. Both live their passion for the complexity and beauty of women’s health and brought that impetus on stage at UCL. Our panel with Jack Pearson, Henry Potts, Tamar Loach and pioneered by Bola Grace, PhD, MBA evolved around the question: Are we empowering or exploiting women with and in healthtech? Is it better to use direct to consumer health tech or visit your doctor? Joyce asked the audience for a vote at the end. The majority said, health tech empowered women, some were neutral. Very few thought it exploited women. New questions came up: How can we ensure accessibilty to health tech? Are we creating the ‘worried well’? Is it better to use direct to consumer health tech or should you always visit your doctor? The jury is still out on these. Thank you for making us think, relate, connect Polly Marston Van Alstyne and Bhavna Malkani. I got home inspired - academically but also personally by spending a whole day with women thinking and living inclusivity. Especially great to reconnect with Rohini Bajekal! As the amazing Karen Arthur of put it: You can hear a story seven times. It only clicks when it comes from a person who looks like you, eats like you, dreams like you. #ucl #womenshealth #healthtech #inclusivity\n\n🌟 Imagine a world where universal basic income, free healthcare, and education, along with progressive drug policies, are not just ideas but reality. 🚀 I've explored a visionary society that prioritizes wellness, equality, and innovation, proving that a more compassionate and inclusive world is within our reach. 🌍💡 This isn't just about dreaming big; it's about actionable steps towards a future where everyone has the opportunity to thrive. From boosting mental health to fostering economic resilience, the benefits are undeniable. Let's start a conversation on how we can apply these principles in our communities and workplaces. Because together, we can build a society that reflects our highest ideals. 💼🌱 #Innovation #Wellness #Equality #FutureSociety #ChangeMakers"
