        "text": "I don't judge people without knowing them and Chelsea was always a quiet kid; as far as I know she is guilty of nothing, not even her last name. As for an Oxford education (or Harvard, or Georgetown, etc.) being a guarantee of big bucks, there's never been any question about that regardless of political party affiliation.\n\nThe only thing I can say about an elite education is that I've been told by those who should know that \"it's the refuge of the mediocre, used by the parents, or by the kids themselves, to help assure status and income to those who are not outstanding in any other significant way and might not make it on their own resources.\"\n\nI have no reason to disbelieve that. On the other hand, I still wouldn't lump Chelsea into that generalization without knowing anything about her.\n\nMonica, on the other hand, does NOT deserve six figures, and probably wore out her knees too early in life to obtain one.\n\nLife NRA Member\n\nT. Jefferson: \"[When doing Constitutional interpretation], let us [go] back to the time when [it] was adopted. [Rather than] invent a meaning [let us] conform to the probable one in which it was passed.\"\n\n0 ·\n\nI agree with Offeror. Chelsea's done nothing wrong and irrespective of what you think of her folks, these personal attacks on her overstep a great many lines in my book. Chelsea has broken no laws (unlike the Bush family daughters), yet I hear nothing but scorn and derision for her.\n\nSo she got a high-paying job after graduating with a master's from Oxford. How many of you would be proud as hell of your kid if he/she accomplished that? But in your rush to rally for the Right, you wind up sounding petty, spiteful, and jealous.\n\n0 ·\n\nI'm not going to diss Chelsea other than to note she has worked hard to get Mommy elected and has political ambitions of her own.\n\nBut, excuse me, a 23 year old, fresh out of college, is hired as a *CONSULTANT*??!! Consulting on what? The font used in her text books? She knows nothing but theory and what she picked up from the First Philanderer whose foreign policy was so bad he had to have Jimmy Carter bail him out - twice! Sure she's worth $100K as a consultant, and Mommy is the next George Washington.\n\n0 ·\n\nTell me fellas, is it painful to be that biased? Which of you have seen her grade transcripts? Anyone who gets into Oxford, earns the right. She competed with thousands from all over the world, and was found acceptable on merit. Some British royalty have been denied entry so it's not a matter of who you know.\n\nShe is no more responsible for her last name than your own children are for theirs. I hope you can all be as proud of yours as our despicable first pair are of Chelsea. She may be the only worthwhile thing they have contributed. And 100 thousand a year, in NYC, for a new Oxford grad (or Harvard, Stanford or even Brown) is not at all unusual.\n\nI loath the Clintons, like most on this board, but it's low to attack their child.\n\nClouder..\n\n0 ·\n\nYeah clouder, you are probably right. I shouldn't have called her ugly. Heck, I'm not too good looking at my age! The reason I say \"probably\" is yes, I haven't seen her transcripts. On the other had, what good would that do? Say old Jeff was an english teacher for Stanford (or where ever she started). I have the presidents daughter as a student. Would Jeff give her a \"C\" if it was deserved? Heck no. Now before all you guys say that \"that's not right - I would never do that\" sure, maybe you wouldn't but I just bet many teachers would. Especially if they don't happen to have tenure yet. I wish her well. Let's all hope she didn't learn her sense of values from her parents.\n\nAs for ugly, I met the Johnson girls back in the mid 60's. Chelsea would get my vote for homecomming queen anyday!\n\ncbxjeffIt's too late for me, save yourself.\n\nIt's too late for me, save yourself.\n\n0 ·\n\nClouder -\n\nYou say that $100,000 really isn't out of line, but who said she's going to be making that amount? The story said \"six figures\", and that she had turned down a job for the 100 grand. Seems to me that her yearly pay could be anything from 100 grand to $999,999.00\n\nIf it turned out that the actual salary for a 23 year-old, fresh out of college, was closer to a million bucks a year than 100 grand, would that make any difference at all in the way you think about this? Not arguing, just curious.\n\n0 ·\n\nThe $100,000 figure was in the news; I saw it in another headline. In the big city, that number is not really unusual for the young executives from Ivy League schools who go to the large corporations. It's a nice salary, but not nearly as much money as it would be in Fort Wayne, Indiana, because rents are so high in NYC and LA, and houses are out of sight.\n\nLife NRA Member\n\nT.
