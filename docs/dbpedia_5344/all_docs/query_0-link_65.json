        "text": "Clara Lemlich also was very, very communist. She started sneaking copies of illicit anti-capitalist literature as a child in Ukraine and was already a dedicated Marxist revolutionary by the time she came to the U.S. at age 17. As she led her factory co-workers in forming their own local of the International Ladies’ Garment Workers Union (ILGWU), despite the objections of its conservative male leadership, she was arrested by the cops 17 times. She led three strikes in the lead-up to the famous Uprising that were, in her words, “broken by the police and gangsters hired by the bosses.” Hired thugs followed her home from a picket line in September 1909 to break her ribs and leave her bleeding in the street. After the famous strike, she was blacklisted from both the garment industry and the ILGWU for her radicalism. Later she went to work for a women’s suffrage organization to mobilize working-class women to win the vote… where she also got kicked out for being a Communist.\n\nIn fact, the only political organization from which Clara Lemlich was never banished was the Communist Party and its front groups, where she made her political home for the next several decades organizing working-class housewives. She protested the executions of the Rosenbergs in 1953 and the U.S. military intervention in Guatemala in 1954 against a popularly elected leftist leader who supported redistribution of land to poor peasants. (Some members of your family, Chelsea, might know something about this history of U.S.-backed coups in Central America.) Under McCarthy, she was summoned before the House Un-American Activities Committee and her family was investigated and put under government surveillance for the rest of her life.\n\nFar from a warm-and-fuzzy story about a plucky, non-ideological girl who was spontaneously moved to strike to win better treatment for “both women and men,” Clara Lemlich’s story is about militant confrontation with the forces of state and capitalist power that sought to violently repress her efforts toward workers’ power at every turn. Movements to win things like “better pay, shorter hours, and safer working conditions”—along with civil rights and women’s freedom—have always counted radicals like her among their ranks. When history books describe the 1912 Bread and Roses Strike in Lawrence, Massachusetts as a spontaneous outburst of worker frustration—not the product of years of deep organizing by members of the Industrial Workers of the World—and when children’s books in the same vein as yours depict Rosa Parks’s famous act of defiance as a product of tired feet, not a deliberate act of civil disobedience by a long-time organizer who faced economic repression and death threats for the rest of her life—these revisions matter.\n\nIn contrast to Clara Lemlich, you, Chelsea Clinton, have spent your life being paid to glide from one patronage job to the next. You have floated on a nepotistic cloud from consulting gigs to board positions at McKinsey, IAC, the Clinton Foundation, and Expedia. In 2011 you snagged a “special correspondent” position on NBC and were paid $600,000 for producing 23 minutes of aired content, a sweet $26,724 per minute. You live in an apartment that costs $10.5 million and your millionaire parents have tax-sheltered your inheritance. (Thanks to Matt Bruenig in Jacobin for compiling a lifetime of patronage here.) I don’t know if you knew that Clara Lemlich was a communist whose life was dedicated to the abolition of the owning class you represent when you chose her for the book, but it seems relevant that you should know.\n\nI hope that every girl in the world gets the chance to be inspired by Clara Lemlich. Her legacy might inspire young women to organize strikes in the garment sweatshops created by your parents’ free trade zones in Haiti, to work against U.S. empire through groups like the Stop the War Coalition that you protested against while at Oxford, or to become card-carrying communists committed to the end of class society. When we do, I can only imagine that we will be warned. We will be given an explanation. And nevertheless, we will persist.\n\nMay our foremothers’ memory be a blessing that inspires us to rise towards revolution,\n\n–Haley, Portrayer of Clara Lemlich in the Boston Workers’ Circle Purim Spiel, year 5777\n\nHaley Kossek is a labor organizer and member of the Workers’ Circle for Jewish Culture and Social Justice in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect those of Lilith Magazine."
