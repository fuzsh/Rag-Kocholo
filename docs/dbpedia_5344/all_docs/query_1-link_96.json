        "text": "Marie Walker, President & CEO of The Corps Network, with Bruce Saito, Executive Director Emiritus of the Los Angeles Conservation Corps (LACC) with two LACC Corpsmembers before the ServeAYear Campaign launch event in Los Angeles, CA.\n\nTune into Jimmy Kimmel Live! tonight at 11:35 p.m. (EST) on ABC to watch Chelsea Clinton publically announce the Serve A Year Campaign; an effort to unite the most influential names in national service, entertainment, technology and business to inspire Americans to serve.\n\nLos Angeles, CA – Today, The Corps Network (TCN) joined leading national service organizations to participate in the launch of the Serve A Year campaign at the Jimmy Kimmel Live studio in Los Angeles, CA. First announced at the Clinton Global Initiative Annual Meeting in September 2014, Serve A Year is a long term effort to unite some of the most influential voices in entertainment, technology and business to inspire millions of young people to serve a year in their communities. The launch event featured appearances by Chelsea Clinton and Jimmy Kimmel; audience members included over 200 Hollywood executives, writers and producers, and senior corporate executives.\n\nManaged by ServiceNation, the Serve A Year campaign focuses on raising public awareness about national service with the help of celebrities, writers and producers from influential shows, and viral video creators. The campaign is supported by innovative companies, including Airbnb, Tumblr, Comcast and NBCUniversal, as well as the country’s leading national service organizations. Along with YouthBuild USA, The Corps Network represents the Opportunity Youth pillar of the campaign, championing the idea that participating in national service can be a transformative experience for disconnected young people.\n\n“National service has a huge impact on communities and on the lives of those who serve,” said Mary Ellen Sprenkel, President & CEO of The Corps Network. “I have heard many Corpsmembers say that they gained so much more out of their service experience than they possibly could have given. I am proud that The Corps Network is part of an effort to make sure all young people know about what an amazing opportunity a service term can be.”\n\nServe A Year has already experienced success in engaging Hollywood. Since the announcement of the campaign last fall, AmeriCorps has been mentioned in several TV shows, including True Detective, Parks & Recreation, and Melissa & Joey. Today, as part of the launch event, the creators of the ABC sitcom The Middle announced that one of their main characters will join AmeriCorps next season.\n\n“Today, the expected path is high school, college, and then a career,” said Zach Maurin, Executive Director of ServiceNation. “We want to redefine growing up to include a service year that will help tackle our nation’s challenges and empower the next generation. We envision a day when you’re as likely to hear young people ask each other, ‘where will your year of service be’ as you would, ‘where are you applying to college?’”\n\nIn addition to speaking at the launch event, Chelsea Clinton will appear on Jimmy Kimmel Live tonight, March 23, 2015 at 11:35 p.m. (EST) to publically launch the Serve A Year campaign.\n\nRepresenting The Corps Network at the launch event were Marie Walker, Vice President of The Corps Network; Bruce Saito, Executive Director Emeritus of Los Angeles Conservation Corps (LACC) and a member of TCN’s Board of Directors; Wendy Butts, CEO of LACC; and several current and former LACC Corpsmembers. Kendrick Collins, an alumni of LACC, spoke during the event about his national service experience."
