        "text": "Associated Press\n\nNEW YORK Chelsea Clinton will start a six-figure consulting job after she receives a masters degree from Oxford University later this year, Newsweek magazine reports on its Web site.\n\nThe daughter of former President Clinton will work in the New York office of London-based McKinsey & Company, newsweek.com reported Friday.\n\nClinton, 23, accepted the position Friday after she reportedly turned down McKinseys offer of $100,000 a year to work at its London headquarters, according to the Web site.\n\nA spokesman for McKinsey did not immediately return a call for comment Saturday, nor did Bill Clintons office.\n\nClinton, who is studying international relations at Oxford, will be one of 5,000 McKinsey consultants worldwide who research topics ranging from health care to corporate finance.\n\nStalker sentenced\n\nLOS ANGELES A Chicago man pleaded guilty to stalking rapper Master P and was sentenced to one year in jail.\n\nIn a court appearance Friday, Antwan Kevin Baker, 32, was also ordered to stay at least 100 yards from the rap star for the next decade and placed on three years probation.\n\nBaker did not explain why he stalked the rap singer.\n\nA telephone message left after business hours for Master Ps lawyer, Donald K. Wilson Jr., was not immediately returned.\n\nProsecutors said Baker followed Master P for two years and was arrested in April 2002 after allegedly making threatening telephone calls to the rappers security guards.\n\nMaster P also is a producer under his No Limit Records label. His teenage son is rapper Lil Romeo.\n\nKrauss must rest\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. Doctors have recommended vocal rest for bluegrass artist Alison Krauss, causing her to postpone next weeks taping with Aerosmith singer Steven Tyler for the cable TV show Crossroads.\n\nKrauss had been ill with coldlike symptoms and is having a difficult time singing, her manager, Denise Stiff, said Thursday.\n\nDoctors will re-evaluate her condition next week.\n\nKrauss and Union Station are scheduled to perform March 19 for the National Association of Record Merchandisers in Orlando, Fla. The concert has not been canceled.\n\nKrauss March 13 taping with Tyler will be rescheduled as soon as possible, Stiff said.\n\nCrossroads, which airs monthly on the Country Music Television station, pairs country artists with those from other musical genres. Past shows have featured the Dixie Chicks with James Taylor, Hank Williams Jr. with Kid Rock and Travis Tritt with Ray Charles.\n\nBatman collects\n\nLOS ANGELES Adam West has more than fond memories of playing superhero Batman in the 1960s television series.\n\nWest kept old costumes and all the original scripts with his handwritten notations from the ABC show that aired for three seasons.\n\nIve gotten calls from people in Japan. They want to pay a lot of money for my scripts, West told The Associated Press recently.\n\nAsked if he would sell, West replied, Not unless I have to put another kid through college.\n\nThe 72-year-old actor and his third wife have six grown children between them.\n\nWest and Burt Ward, who was Batmans sidekick Robin, play themselves in Return to the Batcave: The Misadventures of Adam and Burt airing Sunday on CBS.\n\nWest said hes excited about the TV movie after some initial doubts about reviving the franchise.\n\nIn the wee small hours, you might have an anxiety or two, Am I riding a dead horse here? he said. I realize Im not. This Batman is a very spirited, lively thoroughbred Im riding. I might as well enjoy it.\n\nBoss plays Atlantic City\n\nATLANTIC CITY, N.J. The Boss finally played Atlantic City the city and the song.\n\nBruce Springsteen, whose bleak ballad of redemption Atlantic City was released in 1982, had never headlined here before Friday, when he played to a sell-out crowd of about 12,500 at Boardwalk Hall.\n\nTaking the stage to the strains of There She Is, Miss America, Springsteen and his eight-member band wasted no time in giving the crowd what it came to hear, playing Atlantic City.\n\nThe show was filled with New Jersey references. Springsteen recounted the first time he visited Atlantic City as a child, when his mother took him to see Chubby Checker perform.\n\nSpringsteen, 52, a native of Freehold, has only appeared in Atlantic City once before. In 1989, he jumped on stage at the end of a Jackson Browne concert, joining Browne for the last part of Running on Empty and singing Born to Run with him.\n\nSniper book coming\n\nNORFOLK, Va. Charles Moose, the public face of the Washington-area sniper investigation, said Saturday he will not delay the release of his book despite lawyers concerns that it will taint jury pools for the suspects trials.\n\nMoose, police chief for Montgomery County in Maryland, has a deal with Dutton Books to write about his experience last October leading the three-week search for suspects Lee Boyd Malvo, 18, and John Allen Muhammad, 42.\n\nThe book, tentatively titled Three Weeks in October: The Search for the D.C. Sniper, is set to be published this fall, about the same time Malvo and Muhammad are set to go to trial.\n\nThe pair have been linked to 19 shootings, including 13 deaths, in Virginia, Maryland, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana and the District of Columbia. Both face the death penalty.\n\nBoth prosecutors and defense lawyers have said they have concerns that the book will contain information that should be revealed in a courtroom.\n\nMoose has said previously he will not improperly disclose information and has offered to let prosecutors review the book before it is published.\n\nIn remarks after a speech Saturday to the Virginia Press Association, Moose criticized the scrutiny that his book is getting.\n\nThe Washington Post is writing a book about it. Nobodys asking them about it. Its all about what Im going to do. If I owned a newspaper, nobody would ask me about it, I suppose, Moose said.\n\nWashington Post reporters who covered the sniper shootings also have a book deal.\n\nMooses book is also the subject of a county ethics review. County rules bar disclosure of confidential information and prohibit public employees from using the prestige of office for private gain. An ethics panel is scheduled to consider Mooses book deal Thursday\n\nNEW YORK (AP) Head designer Brian Rennie of Escada began approaching Hollywood stars in early February about wearing his elegant gowns on Oscar night.\n\nAt that time, the stars and their stylists wanted sexy, body-conscious, sherbet-colored gowns and no one wanted anything in black, Rennie told The Associated Press in a recent phone interview.\n\nAlthough he wouldnt mention names or give details of the designs, Rennie said two custom dresses being made by Escada for the March 23 Academy Awards show in Hollywood are very colorful.\n\nBut with a threatened U.S.-led war on Iraq looming, Hollywood is now considering a more subtle look for the red carpet, he said.\n\nPeople are being a little slow on making a final decision. They are waiting to see what happens, said Rennie, who designed the turquoise-and-white outfit worn by Oscar nominee Queen Latifah (Chicago) at Januarys Golden Globe Awards show.\n\nIf war goes ahead there will be a scramble for toned-down dresses with modest necklines and simple jewelry, he said.\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) Tom Sizemore, who plays a police detective in the CBS series Robbery Homicide Division, pleaded innocent to charges that he hit and threatened a woman.\n\nSizemore, free on $2,500 bail, pleaded innocent Friday to five misdemeanor charges domestic violence, battery, violating a restraining order, making criminal threats and dissuading a witness.\n\nSuperior Court Commissioner Mark Zukman scheduled a preliminary hearing for Wednesday.\n\nSizemore, 41, could face up to a year in jail if convicted.\n\nA woman, who has not been identified by authorities, told police on Dec. 7, 2002, that the actor had punched her in the face and threatened her. Officers went to an address provided by the woman and took Sizemore into custody without incident.\n\nThe woman was not a girlfriend and the facts do not support the charges, Sizemores attorney, Robert Barta, said Friday.\n\nA few hours after entering the pleas, Sizemore was at a Century City hotel doing interviews to promote his upcoming sci-fi film Dreamcatcher.\n\nI didnt do it. There are a lot of misconceptions about who I am as a man, the screen images and the problem I had ancient history with drugs, he said. Im not the person they say I am ... this tough guy, gin-swilling Steve McQueen.\n\nSizemore, whose film credits include Saving Private Ryan and Black Hawk Down, said hed been off drugs for eight years.\n\nSYDNEY, Australia British conductor Richard Hickox will take up the baton as Opera Australias next music director.\n\nHickox, 55, is the principal conductor of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales and an associate guest conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra.\n\nHe takes up his new position in 2005 and will replace Australian conductor Simone Young, whose contract with Opera Australia was not renewed at the end of last year amid controversy over her vision for the company.\n\nHickox said he was delighted to get a chance to lead Opera Australia.\n\nIm thoroughly honored and privileged to be invited to take this position and particularly as the mandate from the company seems to have been so strong, he told reporters Thursday.\n\nHickox has already led Opera Australia as a guest conductor on several occasions over many years, including last years production of Lady Macbeth."
