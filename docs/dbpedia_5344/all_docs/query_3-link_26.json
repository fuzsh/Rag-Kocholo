        "text": "01 of 35\n\nBABY MAKES THREE\n\nChelsea Clinton entered the world in Little Rock, Arkansas, on Feb. 27, 1980. According to the New York Times, her name was inspired in part by the Judy Collins song, \"Chelsea Morning.\"\n\n02 of 35\n\nFAMILY PORTRAIT\n\nThe world first met Chelsea when Bill Clinton took office as the 42nd President in 1993. Then a shy, studious 12-year-old, Chelsea remained fiercely close to her dad and mom, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. In a 2001 interview, Bill proudly told the New York Times that his daughter \"has her mother's character and her father's energy.\"\n\n03 of 35\n\nPOWER TO THE PEOPLE\n\nAt the 1992 Democratic National Convention, Chelsea was all sorts of excited - and who wouldn't be? Her father had officially become the Democratic nominee for president.\n\n04 of 35\n\nROCK THE VOTE\n\nThough she was only 12 years old and couldn't yet cast a ballot of her own, Chelsea accompanied her dad to the voting booth in Little Rock, Arkansas.\n\n05 of 35\n\nFIRST FAMILY\n\nChelsea stood with her parents after her father was sworn in as the 42nd President of the United States.\n\n06 of 35\n\nHAVING A BALL\n\nBeing a member of the First Family isn't all work and no play. In 1994, Chelsea took in an Arkansas Razorbacks basketball game with her parents.\n\n07 of 35\n\nFAMILY VACATION\n\nChelsea accompanied her parents on many of their visits abroad, including this one to India and South Asia with her mother in 1995.\n\n08 of 35\n\nDADDY'S GIRL\n\nAn earlier milestone: It was not without sadness that Bill and Hillary celebrated Chelsea's high school graduation from Sidwell Friends (described as the \"Harvard of Washington's private schools,\" and where First Daughters Malia and Sasha Obama attended). During his address to her class, the president said, \"A part of us longs to hold you once more.\"\n\n09 of 35\n\nON COMMON GROUND\n\nChildhood pals, fellow Stanford alums and future husband and wife, Marc Mezvinsky and Chelsea (here, attending a football game on Hilton Head, South Carolina, in 1996) have plenty in common - including family politics. His parents, former Rep. Ed Mezvinsky (D-Iowa) and former Rep. Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky (D-Pennsylvania), are longtime pals of the Clintons. \"They had that connection,\" a friend of the couple told PEOPLE in 2009. \"When not-such-great things were happening in [Chelsea's] life, he was the protector.\"\n\n10 of 35\n\nPATRON OF THE ARTS\n\nChelsea, who is a chairperson on the board of the School of American Ballet (and attended its winter ball in 2007, right), studied dance at the Washington School of Ballet - and even appeared in the school's 1996 production of Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker at age 16.\n\n11 of 35\n\nGRADUATION DAY\n\nWith her parents looking on, a jubilant Chelsea celebrated her graduation day with Stanford's class of 2001 on June 17. Earning a bachelor's degree in history, Chelsea wrote her 150-page thesis on the Northern Ireland peace process, for which she interviewed the former President, her dad Bill.\n\n12 of 35\n\nMASTER CLASS\n\nThat wasn't the end of academia for Chelsea, who followed in Bill's footsteps and enrolled at Oxford University the following fall. She went on to earn a master's degree in international relations before joining the N.Y.C. consulting firm McKinsey & Company, becoming the youngest person hired in her class.\n\n13 of 35\n\nRHODES TO ROMANCE\n\nChelsea and then-boyfriend Ian Klaus, a Rhodes Scholar whom she met at Oxford, became fixtures on the London-New York social scene. Though the two broke up in September 2005 after three years, Klaus told the New York Observer in 2007 that he and his ex were still good friends. In fact, the dedication of his first book, Elvis Is Titantic, reads, \"To my mother and Chelsea, for understanding.\"\n\n14 of 35\n\nFASHION ELITE\n\nA month before turning 22 on Feb. 27, Chelsea looked at ease - alongside Gwyneth Paltrow and Madonna - at a 2002 Versace show in Paris. Between whispers with her front-row pals, she exclaimed \"wow\" as models sashayed down the runway. But it was the former First Daughter - debuting a sleek new bob, smoky eye makeup and a chic Versace pantsuit - who sparked that reaction from the fashion in-crowd.\n\n15 of 35\n\nSEALED WITH A KISS\n\nChelsea and Mezvinsky, seen here in 2006 in N.Y.C., went public with their romance in fall 2005. \"They're best friends who fell in love,\" a friend told PEOPLE of the couple. Described as being \"goofy and laidback,\" another source close to the pair added that Mezvinksy is \"good for her.\"\n\n16 of 35\n\nOFF TO THE RACES\n\nChelsea got a rare break while campaigning for Hillary during the Democratic presidential primary - to attend the Kentucky Derby. The then-28-year-old, who took a leave from her job at a Manhattan hedge fund in 2008 to stump for her mom, put in 10-hour days and visited more than 100 college campuses to reach young voters.\n\n17 of 35\n\nPOLITICAL CLOUT\n\nThe rising star joined Bill to fête Nelson Mandela at his 90th birthday dinner in Hyde Park, London, on June 25, 2008.
