We believe that education is a powerful tool in empowering individuals to take control of their health. This radio show episode highlighted the critical role of oral bacteria, viruses, and yeast in affecting systemic health. It's not just about a healthy smile; it's about fostering a healthier body too. Understanding how these microorganisms can impact various aspects of our health is a pivotal step towards making informed decisions about oral care. The mouth serves as a gateway to the body, and maintaining its health can contribute to preventing a range of health issues. https://lnkd.in/gj6y7V94 #wellnessdentistrynetwork #wecandomore\n\nIt's Women's Health Month, and at QuidelOrtho, we're dedicated to changing lives one test at a time. With precision and passion, we provide the clarity needed for better health outcomes. Did you know, women are likely to need more diagnostic tests than men over the course of their lives; however, access to essential tests, particularly those unique to women, can sometimes be challenging. For example, Graves’ Disease, a type of Thyroid Disease , affects women five times more than men, and a diagnosis requires a series of diagnostic tests, some of which are only available in hospitals or medical imaging centers. Check out this empowering story of how Olympian Gail Devers was diagnosed with Graves’ Disease and how she took control of her health and became her own advocate. This Women's Health Month, let's prioritize our health, support each other and continue our collective journey toward better health outcomes. Together, we can make a difference. #WomensHealthMonth #QuidelOrtho #HealthcareInnovation"
