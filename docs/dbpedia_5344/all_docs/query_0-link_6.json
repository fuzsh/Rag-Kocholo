        "text": "Chelsea Clinton takes on the historic role of introducing the first woman ever nominated for president by a major political party: her mom, Hillary Clinton. \"I hope to convey just a small sense of why I am so proud and grateful to be her daughter, why I'm grateful for the example she set for me as a mom,\" Chelsea, 36, said on the Today show. \"I'm going to talk as her daughter. I'm an only child, so it's unique position that I have.\"\n\nHere's what you should know about the woman who could be the first person to have both parents be the president:\n\n1. Chelsea made front-page news when she was 1 day old.\n\nChelsea was 12 years old when her dad, Bill Clinton, was elected president. But before that, Bill was governor of Arkansas.\n\n\"My father was governor when I was born,\" Chelsea told Vogue. \"I was on the front page of the newspaper the next day.\" Chelsea's best friend, Elizabeth Weindruch, told the magazine: \"She's always lived her life as if she's being watched, by which I mean she was always very well behaved and very well spoken.\"\n\nWhile her dad was still in the White House, Chelsea left for Stanford, where she was accompanied by plainclothes Secret Service officers and had bulletproof windows in her dorm. Chelsea was away at school when news broke of her dad's affair with intern Monica Lewinsky, which, Hillary wrote in her book Living History, left Chelsea \"confused and hurt,\" and led to her being more protective of her privacy.\n\n2. She's tried out a few different careers.\n\nAfter graduating from Stanford, Chelsea went to Oxford to get a master's degree in international relations. Chelsea worked as a consultant at McKinsey & Company, then tried working on Wall Street for a bit, then went back to school to get a master's degree of public health from Columbia University, where she became an adjunct professor. She also earned a doctorate from Oxford.\n\nThen, she tried her hand at news, as a special correspondent for NBC, where she reportedly pulled in $600,000 for the part-time gig. It lasted about three years.\n\nEventually, Chelsea landed at Clinton Foundation, her family's global philanthropic organization, where she holds the title of vice-chair.\n\n3. She's the married mom of two.\n\nChelsea met her husband Marc Mezvinsky in 1992, shortly after moving into the White House. She was 12 and he was 15. They remained friends and reconnected when Chelsea got to Stanford, where Marc was a sophomore. They married in 2010 in upstate New York in front of 400 guests. The event reportedly cost around $3 million.\n\nThe couple had their daughter, Charlotte, in 2014, and their son, Aidan, in June 2016.\n\n4. Ivanka Trump is a friend.\n\nThe pair met through their husbands, according to Politico. And despite the competition between their parents, they remain friendly. Though there have been reports that the women have put their friendship on hold during the election, Chelsea said this week they're \"absolutely\" still friends.\n\n\"We're both incredibly supportive of our parents, as we should be,\" Ivanka told People recently. \"But we also continue to have great respect for one another.\"\n\n5. She's a runner.\n\n\"I think I have run on every street in Manhattan,\" she told Vogue, explaining that she always runs alone. \"Running is my prophylactic stress relief for the day. Or the segue so that I can go home and be with my husband in a kind of clearheaded way. Running is the one part of my life in which I fundamentally feel like the observer instead of the observed.\"\n\n6. She lives in New York — and intends to keep it that way.\n\nChelsea and her family moved into a 5,000-square-foot home in Manhattan, which they bought for $10.5 million in 2013, according to real estate website, .\n\nChelsea told Vogue that living in New York gives her a sense of normalcy. And even if her mom moves back into the White House, Chelsea has said that she plans to stay put.\n\n7. She wrote a book.\n\nChelsea's first book, It's Your World: Get Informed, Get Inspired & Get Going, . It's aimed at inspiring kids and teens to get involved in their communities.\n\n8. She hasn't ruled out following in her parents' footsteps.\n\n\"Not now,\" Chelsea told CNN of her interest in politics. \"I'm ... grateful to live in a city and a state and a country where I really believe in my elected officials, and their ethos and their competencies. Someday, if either of those weren't true and I thought I could make more of a difference in the public sector, or if I didn't like how my city or state or country were being run, I'd have to ask and answer that question.\""
