        "text": "The Clinton Foundation vice chair and founder of Common Sense Media discuss the changing impacts of tech on the mental and physical health of kids and teens.\n\nA recent report by Common Sense Media shows that during the pandemic, social media has helped to keep young people connected and informed. Tech offers resources for health, self-care, empowerment, and self-expression. At the same time, exposure to hate speech online is up significantly, and young people who report moderate to severe depression are nearly twice as likely to be on social media constantly. How tech is impacting the health of kids and families is among the many questions in the new book, Which Side of History? How Technology is Reshaping Democracy and Our Lives, released by Common Sense Media founder and CEO Jim Steyer. Steyer speaks with one of the book's contributors, Chelsea Clinton, vice chair of the Clinton Foundation. They'll explore the changing relationship, for better and for worse, between teens and tech. What are the impacts on mental health, critical thinking, empathy, and more? How are opportunity gaps and the digital divide impacting who benefits most? And what do youth need from adults to help manage their relationships to technology?\n\nPresented in partnership with Common Sense Media.\n\nThe program will be streamed live on this page.
