Do you think her former business background, nonprofit work and years of watching her parents deal with the public will make her the perfect person to bring human interest stories to viewers?\n\nHead over to our comments section and sound off — we want to hear from you!\n\nPhoto courtesy of WENN\n\nread on for more Nbc news\n\nIs Howard Stern heading to America’s Got Talent?\n\nRock Center with Brian Williams debuts\n\nJimmy Fallon schools us with rap"
