        "text": "In December 2008 Obama selected Clinton to serve as secretary of state, and she was easily confirmed by the Senate in January 2009. Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state was widely praised for improving U.S. foreign relationships. She resigned from her post in 2013 and was replaced by former Massachusetts senator John Kerry. Hard Choices, a memoir of her experiences as secretary of state, was published in 2014. The following year it was revealed that she had used a private e-mail address and server while secretary of state, which raised concerns over both security and government transparency. The FBI eventually launched an investigation into the matter.\n\nIn April 2015 Clinton announced that she was entering the U.S. presidential election race of 2016, and she immediately became the favorite to win the Democratic nomination. However, her campaign faced an unexpected challenge from Bernie Sanders, a senator who was a self-described “democratic socialist.” Clinton, seen as a political insider, initially struggled to counter Sanders’s populist policies, which she criticized as unrealistic. Instead, she advocated a “sensible agenda,” which was based on traditional Democratic goals, notably tax increases on the wealthy, an increase to the minimum wage, and immigration reform. In addition, she supported stricter Wall Street regulations, though her past connections to the banking and investment industry—notably in the form of corporate speeches and campaign donations—drew scrutiny. As a former secretary of state, Clinton highlighted her foreign-policy experience, and she backed a strong U.S. presence overseas.\n\nAlthough Clinton entered the primary election season in February 2016 with a number of questions surrounding her campaign—including the ongoing e-mail scandal—by the following month she had emerged as the clear front-runner. On June 7 Clinton claimed the Democratic nomination following wins in several states, notably California. The following month the FBI concluded its e-mail probe, with Director James Comey recommending that no charges be brought against Clinton, though he stated that she had been “extremely careless” in her handling of classified material. The decision drew criticism from her opponents as Clinton looked to move past the scandal. On July 12 she was officially endorsed by Sanders.\n\nLater that month Clinton selected Sen. Tim Kaine as her vice presidential running mate. On July 26, 2016, at the Democratic National Convention, she was named the party’s nominee. Clinton’s Republican opponent was Donald Trump, a businessman whose outsider status and political incorrectness had helped him appeal to previously underappreciated voters and secure his party’s nomination. As the two faced off, the campaign became increasingly negative and highly acrimonious. Trump accused Clinton of being “crooked” and stated that she should be jailed over the e-mail scandal. In addition, she faced quid pro quo allegations in connection with her husband’s charitable organization, the Clinton Foundation. Notably, she was accused of granting special treatment to donors while serving as secretary of state. She denied the various charges, but many polls indicated that the majority of Americans found her untrustworthy.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nWomen’s History: Leaders Quiz\n\nClinton countered by raising doubts about Trump’s temperament and political inexperience, portraying her lengthy career in public service as an asset. She also questioned his business dealings and tax returns—which he refused to release, in contrast to the standard practice for major-party presidential candidates since the 1970s. However, she struck a particular chord when she repeatedly challenged his treatment of women, notably highlighting a series of negative comments he had made. Then in October 2016 a hot-mic video from 2005 surfaced in which Trump stated that “when you’re a star…you can do anything,” including grabbing a woman’s genitals. He dismissed it as “locker room talk,” but a series of women subsequently accused him of past sexual assaults. Although he denied the allegations, support for Clinton increased in the following weeks, particularly among women voters, a demographic with which Trump struggled.\n\nAs election day neared, many polls showed Clinton with a sizable lead, and she appeared to be making inroads into traditionally Republican states. Those polls apparently had failed to capture the support enjoyed by Trump in several key Midwestern states, however, and on November 8, 2016, Clinton was defeated in her bid for the presidency; although she won the popular vote by more than 2.8 million, she lost in the electoral college, 227 to 304. In What Happened (2017), she wrote candidly about the election and offered reasons why she lost. In May 2017 she launched Onward Together, a political group that aimed to fund and support progressive causes. Two years later she wrote (with her daughter, Chelsea) The Book of Gutsy Women: Favorite Stories of Courage and Resilience. In 2020 she became the first female chancellor of Queen’s University Belfast, Northern Ireland. The four-part documentary Hillary (2020) chronicles Clinton’s life and career. In 2021 she turned to fiction writing with State of Terror, a collaboration with Canadian mystery writer Louise Penny. The geopolitical thriller centers on a female secretary of state who races to stop a nuclear attack."
