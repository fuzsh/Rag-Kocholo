        "text": "Like a good crime novel, the WikiLeaks disclosures are beginning to tie up all the loose ends of the long and mysterious story of Hillary Clinton’s private email server.\n\nThe key revelation is a 12-page memo about the intertwined finances of the Clinton Foundation and the Clintons personally. It was written by Doug Band, a longtime aide and associate of former president Bill Clinton and founder of business consulting firm Teneo. The memo discloses details of what the Clintons were doing when President-elect Obama said they couldn’t do it anymore if one of them was going to be secretary of state.\n\nIt was then, after the 2008 ethics agreement was reached, that Mrs. Clinton had aides set up a private email server in her home in Chappaqua and declined a state.gov account. Years later, when the State Department asked Secretary Clinton to turn over her official records, she and her legal team deleted 33,000 emails she deemed “personal.”\n\nThe subject line of Band’s memo, dated Nov. 16, 2011, was “Background on Teneo and Foundation Activities.” He sent it to two lawyers from the firm of Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett LLP, which was hired by Chelsea Clinton to review the governance of the foundation after she got an inside look at its finances. Copies were sent to President Clinton, Chelsea, board members Terry McAuliffe and Bruce Lindsey and special advisor John Podesta.\n\n“Throughout the past almost 11 years since President Clinton left office,” Band wrote, “I have sought to leverage my activities, including my partner role at Teneo, to support and to raise funds for the Foundation. This memorandum strives to set forth how I have endeavored to support the Clinton Foundation and President Clinton personally.”\n\nIn a nutshell, Band used glittering foundation events to pitch potential clients, and he urged clients to donate to the foundation and hire the former president for paid speeches and lucrative advisory positions.\n\nMoney and gigs came in from clients like Coca-Cola, UBS and Dow. Another Teneo client was Laureate International Universities. “Teneo partners have helped manage this relationship, which is very time-consuming,” Band wrote. “Laureate pays President Clinton $3.5 million annually to provide advice and serve as their Honorary Chairman.”\n\nBand said he personally secured more than $50 million in “for-profit activity” for President Clinton, along with $66 million in future contracts. “Justin Cooper and I have, for the past 10 years, served as the primary contact and point of management for President Clinton’s activities,” he wrote, listing those activities as politics, business, foundation work, speeches, travel, books and “family/personal needs.”\n\nBand, who called Chelsea a “spoiled brat,” wasn’t happy at all to be questioned by lawyers from Simpson Thacher. Chelsea wrote in an email on Nov. 1, 2011, “Doug called and yelled and screamed at my Dad about how could he do this to Justin and him, he would be nothing without him, etc.”\n\nChelsea wasn’t happy at all with the way Band and Cooper treated her father. “Multiple people shared with me how upset they were at hearing how Justin referred to my father in the last week — in very derogatory ways,” she emailed Podesta and others on Nov. 4, writing that her father had been told of “multiple examples of Teneo ‘hustling’ business at CGI [Clinton Global Initiative].”\n\nStill, the former president signed on as an adviser to Band’s firm a short time later. “I don’t believe in coincidences,” Chelsea wrote cryptically in an email to Podesta.\n\nThe Simpson Thacher review found serious problems with the foundation’s governance, including the complete lack of a required policy on conflicts of interest. Chelsea worried in a Dec. 2011 email that the foundation’s non-profit status might be at risk.\n\nBefore Doug Band was a consultant, he’d been the “body man” for President Clinton, the person who traveled with him everywhere. In 2012, Band hired Huma Abedin, the woman who travels everywhere with Hillary Clinton, to work for Teneo. In her simultaneous government job as deputy chief of staff, Abedin dutifully checked with Band to see whether people who sought meetings with Secretary Clinton were “legit CGI people,” according to a Dec. 4, 2012, email sent from Abedin’s State Department account.\n\nHillary Clinton was no bystander. Emails from Abedin about a $12 million donation to the foundation from the king of Morocco show the concerns of the staff about the appearance of Clinton’s personal request for the money and her promise to appear at a CGI event to be held in Morocco in May 2015. “She created this mess and she knows it,” Abedin wrote.\n\nIt’s perfectly clear, as President Richard Nixon used to say. Corporations and foreign governments seeking favorable treatment from the U.S. State Department were courted for cash. Access to government officials was “leveraged” to bring in money for the foundation and the Clinton family bank account. Hillary Clinton hid her correspondence on a private email server, hired BleachBit-wielding contractors to destroy subpoenaed evidence, claimed memory failure 39 times in an FBI interview, and tolerated a choir of staffers pleading the Fifth Amendment without firing anybody.\n\nIf it was a crime novel, this would be the final chapter."
