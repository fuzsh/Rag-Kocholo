In an innovative blend of newly-unearthed audio recordings, dramatic reconstructions and personal archive, the film traces Charlie Chaplin's meteoric rise from the slums of Victorian London to the heights of Hollywood superstardom, before his scandalous fall from grace. Refracting his life through a kaleidoscope of previously unheard voices and perspectives, the film sheds new light on the many sides of a groundbreaking, controversial and visionary artist. For decades he was the most famous man in the world but who was The Real Charlie Chaplin? The Real Charlie Chaplin is directed by doc producers / filmmakers Peter Middleton & James Spinney, both co-directors of the doc Notes on Blindness previously. This initially premiered at the 2021 Telluride Film Festival this year. The film opens later in UK cinemas next March. Showtime will first open the doc in select US theaters (NY & LA) on November 19th, 2021, then streaming on Showtime starting on December 11th this fall. Interested?"
