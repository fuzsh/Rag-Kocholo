        "text": "Charlie Chaplin in THE CIRCUS (1928) 72 minutes\n\nChaplin believed his Tramp character should not speak onscreen, and would make two more silent-based movies well into the 1930s. Today's film is his last to be released in the silent era. It finds the Tramp taking refuge in a traveling circus and unknowingly becoming the star of the show. He falls in love with a horseback rider whose stepfather, the ringmaster, mistreats her. His efforts to survive, and protect her, create a seemingly personal film about love, comedy and the price of fame, climaxed by his attempt to walk the tightrope while attacked by monkeys.\n\nDirected by Charlie Chaplin\n\nNOTE: This feature will be played with music that Chaplin composed on the soundtrack\n\nPreceded by a Laurel & Hardy short:"
