        "text": "Best known for his tragicomic character \"The Little Tramp,\" Charlie Chaplin revolutionized cinema, both during the silent era and the talkies. Almost a century later, The Gold Rush, Modern Times, The Kid, and The Great Dictator are still considered essential cinematic works. His writing, producing, directing, acting, and scoring of his own films received just as much attention as his controversial personal life. The London-born Chaplin had a penchant for marrying teenage women, and ended up fathering 11 children. Though his outspoken political views would eventually force him out of America for good in 1952, Chaplinâs Hollywood legacy still burns brightly. Here are 10 facts about the legendary filmmaker, who was born on this day in 1889.\n\n1. HE COLLABORATED WITH A FEMALE FILMMAKER (WHICH WAS A RARITY IN THOSE DAYS).\n\nMabel Normand was a silent film actress as well as a writer, producer, and directorâwhich was unusual for the mid-1900s. She starred in 12 films with Charlie Chaplin, including 1914âs Mabelâs Strange Predicament, which marked the onscreen debut of Chaplinâs The Tramp character (though Mabelâs Strange Predicament was filmed first and technically was his first Tramp appearance, it was released two days after Kid Auto Races at Venice, the actual film debut of the character). She also directed Chaplin in 1914âs Caught in a Cabaret and the pair co-directed and starred in Her Friend the Bandit, which was released the same year.\n\n2. HE CO-FOUNDED A BIG-TIME MOVIE STUDIO.\n\nIn 1919, Chaplin and fellow filmmakers Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, and D.W. Griffith formed United Artists as a means to finance their own movies so that they could retain creative control. The first film released under the new studio was 1919âs His Majesty, the American, starring Fairbanks. The studio took off and eventually branched out to build a chain of movie theaters. But in 1955, with movie attendance at a new low, Chaplin sold his shares. UA released the first James Bond movie in 1963. Today, MGM is UAâs parent company.\n\n3. HE COMPOSED THE MUSIC FOR MANY OF HIS FILMS.\n\nBeginning with 1931âs City Lights, Chaplin composed scores for his filmsâ soundtracks. His song âSmile,â used in Modern Times, became a classic. In 1954, Nat King Coleâs versionânow with lyricsâpeaked at number 10 on the Billboard charts. Michael Jackson also recorded a cover. Chaplin won his only competitive Oscar in 1973 for composing the theme to his 1952 film Limelight (the film wasnât released in the U.S. until 1972).\n\n4. HE WAS A PERFECTIONIST.\n\nThere was a reason Chaplin did everything himself: perfectionism. When he worked on his short film The Immigrant, Chaplin shot 40,000 feet of film, which was a lot for a 20-minute short. Chaplin cast actress Virginia Cherrill in City Lights to say just two words, âFlower, sir,â but he forced her to repeat them for 342 takes. âHe knew exactly what he wanted and he would have preferred not to have any other actors in his filmsâhe even tried making a film once where he was the only person in it,â Hooman Mehran, author ofÂ Chaplin's Limelight and the Music Hall Tradition, told CNN.\n\n5. HE WAS EMBROILED IN A NASTYâAND GROUNDBREAKINGâPATERNITY SUIT.\n\nIn the 1940s, actress Joan Berry was allegedly having an affair with Chaplin. At one point, he invited Berry to travel from L.A. to New York City. While in New York, she spent time with Chaplin and claimed that the director âmade her available to other individuals for immoral purposes.â This violated the Mann Act, in which a person isnât allowed to cross state lines for depraved behavior.\n\nWhen, in 1943, Berry gave birth to a daughter, she stated that Chaplin was the fatherâa charge he adamantly denied. Though blood tests confirmed that Chaplin was not the father, because the tests werenât admissible in California courts, he had to endure two separate trials. Despite the blood evidence saying otherwise, the jury concluded that Chaplin was the father. Not only was his reputation ruined, but he also had to pay child support. On the bright side, the ruling helped reform state paternity laws.\n\n6. HE ACCEPTED HIS 1972 HONORARY OSCAR IN PERSON.\n\nIn 1952, because of his alleged Communist politics, the U.S. denied Chaplin re-entry to the United States after he traveled to London for the premiere of his film Limelight. Incensed, he moved his family to Switzerland and vowed heâd never return to Hollywood. But 20 years later, possibly to make up for his exile, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences honored the 82-year-old Chaplin with an honorary Oscar (his second of three). Chaplin attended the ceremony and received an enthusiastic standing ovation. When he finally spoke, he said, âThank you for the honor of inviting me here. Youâre all wonderful, sweet people.â\n\n7. A RUSSIAN NAMED A MINOR PLANET AFTER HIM.\n\nIn 1981, Russian astronomer Lyudmila Georgievna Karachkina, who has discovered more than 100 minor planets, named one of them after the legendary director: 3623 Chaplin.\n\n8. THEREâS AN ANNUAL CHARLIE CHAPLIN FILM FESTIVAL.\n\nIn the 1960s, Chaplin and his family enjoyed spending summers in the village of Waterville, located on the Ring of Kerry in Ireland. In 2011 the town founded the Charlie Chaplin Comedy Film Festival, which is held each August. (A bronze statue of him resides in town.) The festival features a short film competition with categories like Chaplins of the Future. Last year the fest tried to break the Guinness World Record of the largest gathering of people dressed as Chaplin.\n\n9. HIS FORMER HOME IN SWITZERLAND WAS CONVERTED INTO A MUSEUM.\n\nOn April 16, 2016âwhat wouldâve been his 127th birthdayâChaplinâs World, a museum dedicated to the filmmakerâs life and work, opened in his former home in Switzerland. The museum has welcomed around 300,000 visitors in its firstÂ year. Visitors can see his home, the Manoir de Ban, at Corsier-sur-Vevey, by Lake Geneva. The estate also houses a studio where his movies are screened, wax figures, recreations of some of his film set pieces, and a restaurant named The Tramp.\n\n10. THIEVES GRAVE-ROBBED CHAPLINâS BODY AND HELD IT FOR RANSOM.\n\nEven in death, Chaplin created controversy. Chaplin died on Christmas Day 1977 and was interred near his home in Corsier-sur-Vevey, Switzerland. Almost three months after his death, on March 2, 1978, his widow, Oona Chaplin, received a call from the police saying, âsomebody dug up the grave and heâs gone,â Eugene Chaplin told The Independent.\n\nThe thieves demanded $600,000 to return the body. Oona tapped the phone lines, which led authorities to the two men, Roman Wardas and Gantscho Ganev. They confessed to the crime and showed the police Chaplinâs body, which they buried in a cornfield near his original gravesite. The men went to jail, but not before writing âIâm sorryâ letters to Oona, who forgave them."
