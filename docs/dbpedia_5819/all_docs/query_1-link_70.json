        "text": "Chaplin’s wives were all considerably younger than he. When he was 29, he married 16-year-old Mildred Harris, but they divorced two years later. When he was 35, he married another 16-year-old, Lolita [!] McMurry, in Mexico, to dodge California’s statutory rape laws. Their marriage ended three years later in a highly-publicized divorce case. His third wife, Pauline Levy, was 20 when they got married in 1936. Chaplin - still aging, unlike his brides - was 47. They divorced after six years, “without public fuss,” according to Chaplin’s New York Times obituary. Finally, Chaplin’s last wife - Oona O’Neill, daughter to playwright Eugene O’Neill - was 18 when he was a whopping 54. Their marriage “proved happy and lasting, and it produced eight children.”\n\nWas Charlie Chaplin born to romani in the back of a caravan? That’s what one letter Chaplin kept locked up in his house claimed. Found by his family in 1991, the letter from a man named Jack Hill claimed that Chaplin was born \"in a caravan [that] belonged to the Gypsy Queen, who was my auntie. You were born on the Black Patch [a Romany community] in Smethwick near Birmingham.\"\n\nChaplin’s birth certificate has never been located, but prior to the discovery of the letter, biographers put his place of birth as East Street, Walworth, in South London (that's 7-year-old Charlie in the center of the above photograph). The truth remains unknown, despite an MI5 investigation into his background in 1952, inspired by American allegations that Chaplin was a “high-risk communist.”\n\n\"After scouring the files at Somerset House in London for his birth certificate, MI5 concluded: 'It would seem that Chaplin was either not born in this country or that his name at birth was other than those mentioned.'\"\n\nSome suggested Chaplin was not his real name, and that he was born Israel Thorstein, perhaps changing his name to conceal his Jewish identity.\n\nIn 1975 - nearing the end of his life - Charlie Chaplin decided to enter a Charlie Chaplin look-alike contest in France. You can just picture him, coyly smiling at his own joke, totally sure of his eventual success, since he was, ya know, the actual person the contest was trying to find a match of. Here's the thing, though, he didn't just lose the top spot; he actually took third place in his own look-alike contest. Some think that perhaps his eyes - which were piercingly blue when seen in color - were the thing that lost him the prize, given that the judges and audience would've only seen their grey appearance in his black-and-white films."
