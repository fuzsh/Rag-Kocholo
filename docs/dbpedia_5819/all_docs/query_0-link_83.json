        "text": "(1914–84). American actor Jackie Coogan was the first major Hollywood child star. He rose to fame in the silent-film era and was best known as the sad-eyed little boy in The Kid (1921) and in similar movies.\n\nJohn Leslie Coogan was born on October 26, 1914, in Los Angeles, California. The son of a vaudevillian and an actress, he appeared in his first film, Skinner’s Baby (1916), when he was 18 months old. Charlie Chaplin later noticed Coogan in a stage act and featured him, aged six, in The Kid, which gave him immediate international fame. This exposure led to roles in such films as Peck’s Bad Boy (1921), My Boy (1921), Trouble (1922), Oliver Twist (1922), Daddy (1923), Circus Days (1923), Long Live the King (1923), A Boy of Flanders (1924), Little Robinson Crusoe (1924), Old Clothes (1925), The Bugle Call (1927), Tom Sawyer (1930), and Huckleberry Finn (1931). In 1923–24 Coogan was making $22,000 a week and earning 60 percent of the profits from his pictures.\n\nIn 1935 Coogan survived an auto accident that took the lives of his father and three others. In 1938 he sued his mother and stepfather (his former business manager), only to learn that his parents had spent his multimillion-dollar fortune. Because of his circumstances, the California legislature enacted the Child Actors Bill, popularly called the “Coogan Law.” This bill ensured that child movie actors gained such rights as having their contracts approved by the courts and their income governed by financial institutions."
