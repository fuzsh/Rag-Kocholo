        "text": "It can be said that the familiar concept of film became prominent in 1895 when the technologies for recording and replaying moving pictures were successfully produced. Although the same technologies already existed and were used for the production of photographs, the pioneering of new techniques allowed the film footage to be played faster and for longer.\n\nIn effect, film was a number of still images that were taken one after another and shown at a speed in which fooled the audience’s eyes to perceive the shots as movement; cinemas nowadays use 25 frames/ second to show their films. However, in 1895, there was a difficulty in producing a smooth movement with films only showing the moving pictures 8 frames/second. Moreover, the problem of adding sound to the film ,also, proved hard to solve: sound is an analogue system that was not able to synchronize itself with the jerky movements of the machinery that was playing the film.These problems were predominantly seen all around the world and , therefore, the improvements in the technology were developed in parallel with other people from other countries producing their own solutions. In 1927, the first commercially available film with sound was produced however, other people found loop holes with the lack of sound; they had actors reading lines and making sound effects during the screening.\n\nThe idea of film as an art form differed from country to country meaning that the familiar and recognisable ‘rules’ regarding films did not exist, allowing each country to individually experiment with their ideas of the concept of film. Despite the twenty-first century being dominated by North-American film making, in 1895, there was no prominent voice and each country produced their own ideas of conveying their own messages through film.\n\nIn Russia, film was heavily linked to the political situation as a means of informing and manipulating the public.This was an easy way for the government to effectively convey specific information to the vast population of its empire. Furthermore, in Soviet Russia, editing became the focal point of their film industry. The concept of the Soviet montage was created where they rapidly edited a series of film sequences together in order to give the audience understanding through the juxtaposition of the edits. This idea-focused method of cinema , taken advantage of by Soviet director Sergei Eisenstein, differed from the idea of cinema in Germany, for example.\n\nIn Germany, however, the idea of German expressionism became prominent where mise-en-scene was the focal point of film to convey meaning through its symbolism and metaphors. The use of constructed sets allowed the German film directors to tell a story in an abstract way , opening up different meanings for the audience watching.\n\nIn America, film can be argued to have been similar to what the modern audience is used to seeing now. The use of narrative storytelling combined with the techniques of continuity editing developed rapidly and became immensely popular. This popularity triggered the rise of the recognisable commercialized film industry where film makers began to produce films in order to increase their profits. Developed cinemas and revolutionized methods of distribution allowed the film industry in America to boom because films were now easily shown , transported quickly and produced significant amounts of money which could then be used to produce even more, better quality films.\n\nFollowing this, the idea of the studio system was created where lots of competing individuals set up independent studios and began to produce their own films. This offered a variety of different films to the people and began to see people experiment with unique methods of film form; each studio wanted to produce something better than any other things seen before in order to make the most money and become the most famous.The innovations of the ‘two-reeler’ allowed films to be shown longer than ever before making the concept of films even larger. The new studios contributed to the rise of film stars who soon became very powerful and influential.\n\nHowever, there were only four or five stars that completely dominated American film at this time. The first being the well-known Charlie Chaplain, a British actor who rose to fame in Vaudeville theatre and then moved to America to find his fortune within the ever-growing film industry. He was one of the few film stars that survived the transition from silent to sound films , naming him a global success. He is best known for his iconic role as the ‘tramp’ in his slapstick comedy films.Harold Lloyd was another prominent film star at that time and he was best known for his daredevil stunts that he pulled in his films. His disregard for health and safety and expectations appealed to a wide audience because he achieved things that nobody had ever done before.Stanley Laurel and Oliver Hardy were an iconic duo act who made lots of films and became global megastars. Laurel came from a humble background in Britain but , like Chaplain, wanted to find his fame in America. There, his genius combined with Hardy’s confident acting, they survived the transition through to sound films quite successfully. However, they earned little money from their films because they were exploited by the studio that promoted them yet their creativity and quality of entertainment completely dominated films all through to the first half of the twenty first century.Buster Keaton , arguably one of the most successful auteurs of all time, proved to find his fame through his inventive ideas and physical acting skills. As a renaissance man , he valued the art of comedy and tried to explore new ways of making unique entertainment; he never pulled the same stunt twice. The perfectionist was extremely successful but technology gradually got ahead of him and that was where he made his end.\n\nMeanwhile, film was becoming a respected art form so was film criticism which influences the different directions that filmmakers would steer to to make their entertainment. Andre Bazin came up with the theory of the realist and expressive explaining the true object of film forms.\n\nFor over a century , film has been a prominent and growing part of people’s lives, beginning with the invention of the first ever partially successful camera image created in 1816 by Nicephore Niepce. He used a camera of his own making and a piece of paper coated with silver chloride to create his image however, it was not permanent and gradually grew darkened due to light exposure.\n\nIn 1926 , developing his work however, Niepce created the world’s first ever successful camera image which depicted the view of an upstairs window of his estate , in the Burgundy region of France. this is a vital part of photography, later leading to the development of images.\n\nFrom this point, photographic technique improved rapidly, capturing people’s imaginations and increasing in popularity. Since we were able to capture still images, people wanted to invent a way to capture moving pictures too. Thomas Edison explored this by taking a series of photographs and playing them back together one after another.Therefore in 1889, Edison created his first experimental movie.\n\nIn 1897,Thomas Edison’s kinentoscope proved a significant invention in the history of film since it was the first successful camera showing moving images. It could be viewed by one individual at a time through a peephole it introduced the basic approach that would become the standard for all cinematic projection ,by creating the illusion of movement.\n\nHowever prior to this in 1878, British photographer Eadweard Muybridge made a series of still photographs of a horse that when viewed in sequence, appeared to be galloping.\n\nThis series of images , when played together, created the impression of movement and that the horse was galloping.\n\nMoving images were created by moving a long reel of photo-sensitive plastic celluloid through camera, where every 16 pictures that were rapidly taken gave the impression of movement ,when playing them back. The frame rate at this time was 16 frames per second.\n\nHowever, people were not totally satisfied and so worldwide the frame rate was increased to 24 frames per second where the illusion of movement worked best by fooling the audience’s eyes into thinking that there was movement. This change enabled film to develop in more complex ways since now the moving images looked as if they were at a more realistic rate than before.\n\nThe technology of cinema stayed largely the same through the 20th century but the cinema itself gained its popularity and began making its own money. At the beginning of this century is where the cinema industry really took off and began making and monetising films for the public eye.\n\nSince the actually film itself was very expensive, the existing films would have to be physically taken around the country to villages and towns for people to view them in tents and in put-up buildings. This proved to become a problem though since the popularity of the films was expanding and so: many theatres were , then, turned into cinemas were the communities would gather in masses to witness the innovation of moving pictures: they were easy for the cinema industry to take over because they were ready-made.\n\nBy this time films began to stop travelling around and were held in the cinemas and lent out to different cinemas once they had been seen in that area. However, this required them to be transported in big vehicles to the cinemas because the film reels were so large and heavy which could have caused many problems if they were stolen or broken during transport: they were extremely valuable and rare.\n\nThe cinema industry became a huge opportunity for business and money-making, where people would pay to get into the cinema and watch the films. However, different businesses now had the problem of having to constantly outdo the others since it was such a competitive market.They did this by creating different genres and styles of film such as horror. In addition to this, there was competition on which companies could solve the solution into creating colour cinema since the audience demand for new innovations was so high and every company wanted to offer the best quality of their films.\n\nIn 1927 ,the first colour film was produced which changed the cinema industry indefinitely. Although colour segments had been present in films since 1902, the new innovation generated mass income to cinema businesses who featured these films that nobody had ever seen before. One of the most successful and best known colour films of that time was ‘The Wizard of Oz’ which used three strip technicolor.\n\nSound was another big problem to film which companies desperately sought to solve in the early 20th century: it proved extremely difficult to synchronize sound to the picture being shown on screen since the reel of film did not go smoothly through the camera. Companies attempted to cope with this problem in a number of ways by trying different methods to synchronize the sound to the movement and actions in the picture.\n\nMeanwhile, films often had live pianists, orchestras and musical performances in place of the lack of sound which were seen as a spectacle and drew more people in to watch the films. Inter-tiles were also used throughout the film which stood in place of the missing spoken dialogue and helped push the narrative forward to the audience.\n\nHowever, in the late 1920’s , an optical soundtrack was introduced which consisted of a white line running down the side of the film reel which used light to turn it into sound. The sound on the line was recorded ahead of the frames it responded to in order to synchronize it with that frame: the jagged movement of the film frames through the camera postponed its timing so the white line was synchronized to that jagged movement. This technological innovation introduced motion picture to the film industry which would later be developed into what it is today.\n\nDuring the late 1920’s , television was successfully demonstrated by Philio Taylor Farnsworth, in San Francisco. Since the cinema industry was so huge , it began to hit a crisis where people began to want to have the same experience of watching films in their own homes.Therefore, companies began testing out methods which could make this happen and the invention of the television was born.\n\nAlthough it was an amazing invention , it was very slow-burning since only the very rich could afford one in their own homes and forcing the rest of people to continue attending the cinema if they wanted to see any films.\n\nBy the 1950’s , however, televisions were cheaper and ,therefore, most homes would have been able to afford and watch one regularly.This led to an even bigger cinema crisis since people could just watch things at home for free instead of paying to use their cinemas. This meant that there was now not only competition within the cinema industry but with the upcoming television industry as well.\n\nCinema tried to provide a better experience which they attempted in numerous ways. Companies wanted to make the screen bigger and better than that of a television so that it would entice more customers back to cinemas to watch films ,with a bigger and clearer picture.They achieved this by widening the shape of the screen, since they couldn’t raise its height through the roof. This made it easy to watch because the eyes’ peripheral vision allows you to see things with a wider perspective.\n\nSome companies decided to cut the top ad bottom of the picture off the screen and stretch the image , making it more rectangular which did produce a worse quality image but kind of worked. Others , in the 1950’s, created cinema scope which used a special lens to squash the picture when it was filmed and then later un-squash it in the cinemas using another special lens. This created a large , good quality image which was easily squashed back down to fit the normal screens.\n\nThis clearly demonstrates the difference in screen size between cinema scope and standard screen films.\n\nThe cinema industry also found a compromise in picture size to stop the black lines that often appeared on the films , making the cinema experience better by showing a clearer, more realistic image. Surround sound and 3D films were , also, introduced during the 1970’s and 80’s however, they were quite poor and unsuccessful until they were later developed into what they are today.\n\nSince cinemas were very affordable, the costs of producing films went down and therefore, the number of people making films increased. This was because many companies saw the opportunities to make money by producing films and gaining masses of profit from viewings. Distributing films now became free, via digital steaming, so it was easy for companies to get hold of unseen new films and send off films they no longer needed to show. Since companies now streamed films, they could be shown on the same day in cinemas all over the world , meaning that everyone would watch it at once and have the same experiences as everyone else. This also meant that if you lived far away from the big cities where the film was originally being shown, you could still see it at the same time in your local cinema for predominantly the same price.\n\nThis leads the technology of cinema up to the present day, showing how it has changed and developed over the years. Now we have new technological innovations such as: 4D cinema and virtual reality.\n\nThe history of cinema is not simply based on the technology innovations but on the people who dedicated their time to take those things happen.The actors, directors, producers and inventors who pioneered new routes of cinema and films.\n\nIn 1911, Nestor established the first ever permanent motion picture studio in Hollywood, California, and produced the first Hollywood films. This enabled the film industry to branch out and now professionally film within a professional workplace.\n\nThe first ever feature length, The Story of The Kelly Gang, took place in 1906 and seven years later , on December 29th, the first full-length Hollywood feature film , ‘Squaw Man’, was created.\n\nThe film industry became a magnet for women, immigrants and Jews , who were not accepted in any other job roles in society. Alice Guy was the first ever female pioneer filmmaker, active from the late 19th century, and one of the first to make a narrative fiction film. From 1896 to 1906 she was argued to be the only female filmmaker in the world meanwhile, she experimented with sound syncing systems, color tinting, interracial casting, and special effects.\n\nAnother key female in the film industry was the American silent film actress, screenwriter, producer, and director :Lois Weber. She was considered as “the most important female director the American film industry has known” and is best known for her lead role in the 1913 silent film ‘ suspense’as ‘The Wife’.The film features early examples of a split screen shot and a car chase which were new editing innovations of that time.\n\nFrances Marion was another key female figure in the 20th century who had an impact on the film industry. She was an American journalist, author, film director and screenwriter; she was often renounced as “the most renowned female screenwriter of the 20th century alongside June Mathis and Anita Loos”. What’s more, she was the first writer to ever win 2 Academy Awards; The Big House (1930) and The Champ( 1932).\n\nWhen talking films were created , in 1927, Wall Street began investing more money into the film industry which changed attitudes to the public ,who now were taking the industry much more seriously. This led to men wanting the same jobs, as the woman had in the industry , in order to find their fortunes and opportunities to make money.\n\nD. W Griffith was an American director, writer, and producer who pioneered many modern cinematic techniques. He is argued to be one of the greatest American directors of all time , winning the Academy Honorary Award in 1938. He is probably most remembered for The Birth of A Nation(1915) and Intolerance (1916).\n\nThe Birth of A Nation was an American silent , epic , drama film which was very controversial for its portrayal of black men , played by actors in Blackface, as stupid and sexually aggressive towards the white women, and the portrayal of the KKK as a heroic force.This caused many black protests in places like Boston , while thousands of white Americans were keen to watch the film and encourage the racial hatred for the Black Americans. There had been many attempts to ban the film at this time too, none of which were successful enough and the popularity of this film with the White Americans introduced a new area of film where racism was tolerated and enforced. Many black people were attacked and beaten because of this new film ‘ craze’.\n\nHowever, it was not only American who was producing great and successful film:\n\nSouls On The Road (Minoru Murata, 1921) was a Japanese silent film critiqued as “the first landmark film in Japanese history.”\n\nScandinavians used the ‘ art of light’ in their films to emphasise the affect of how natural and artificial lighting could be used to create different atmospheres.\n\nThe movement of surrealism in the 1920’s was the modernist approach to film theory, criticism, and production. The movement used shocking, irrational, or absurd imagery and Freudian dream symbolism to challenge the traditional function of art to represent reality. Examples of the new area of film were: The Seashell and The Clergyman (Germaine Dulac/ 1928) and Rose Hobart( Joseph Cornell/1936). Movements like these opened up new possibilities to cinema and granted access to film makers to express themselves in their own ways.\n\nAs investment in film increased, major film studios were brought to life such as: Warner Bros, Paramount Pictures and MGM. These major studios are still hugely successful today and still continue to produce award-winning feature-length films.\n\nCitizen Kane ( Orsen Welles ,1941) formed a production line system that all films still use today where different people are allocated different roles to oversee the writing, making, producing and advertising of the film. This is a significant point in the film industry where it was recognised that to make the best-selling films , a new system was needed to ensure different aspects of film were developed separately so that they can be eventually brought together for the final product of the film. Talent Scouts were ,also, created at this time where people would search through cities, newspapers and photographs to find the right people for each role. This method is sometimes used today if he director wants a specific person.\n\nFigures such as Marilyn Monroe were key in the development of the film industry since new makeup, hair and fashion techniques and trends were able to be advertised and shown all around the world. Her iconic ‘blonde bombshell’ hair and red lip influenced women all around the world to follow her style and beauty. Not only this, but a new movement of romantic film was reinforced during her time as a global icon.\n\nDifferent hair and makeup trends of that time were mostly influenced by actresses playing lead roles of the best selling and newest films and therefore, the film industry was now able to influence an aspect of society which it had never done before. Now, branded companies would pay film companies to feature their brand of clothing , accessories and other products in their films in order for them to be advertised and recognised. This is still seen on films to this day; in particular in James Bond films.\n\nThe movement of comedy was a massive aspect to the history of film, where people, such as; Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, rose to fame.\n\nCharlie Chaplin was an English comic actor, filmmaker, and composer who rose to fame in the era of silent film but introduced a new movement of comedy. Chaplin became a worldwide icon through his screen persona as ” the tramp” and is considered one of the most important figures in the history of the film industry. His slapstick comedy was found to be hugely popular and humorous all around the world and his style of a bowler hat, mustache and a cane is highly recognised.\n\nBuster Keaton an American actor, comedian, film director, producer, screenwriter, and stunt performer ,who is best-known for his silent/ comedy films where he used physical comedy and a deadpan facial expression which earned him the title of ‘ The Great Stone Face.’ His film ‘ The General ( 1926) is argued to be is best and most popular.\n\nThe film industry has changed dramatically over the past century with technological innovations , new movements of film , major industries being formed and specific influential individuals having an iconic impact on cinema.\n\nMy favourite era of film definitely has to be the introduction of glitz and glamour into film with figures such as Marilyn Monroe and Audrey Hepburn showing Hollywood to be glamorous and full of romance."
