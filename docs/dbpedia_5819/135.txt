Charlie Chaplin was a small man who had a big impact in early 20th century movies. He began performing on stage as a child in the 1890s. In the early 1900s he joined a comedy troupe and began acting in films. His iconic "Tramp" character debuted in 1914 and became hugely popular. Chaplin eventually founded his own film studio and wrote, directed, produced and starred in many classic silent films. He won an honorary Academy Award in 1972 for his contributions to cinema over his long career.
