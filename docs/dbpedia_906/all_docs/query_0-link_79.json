One of the constant line of Turkish policy toward Kosovo is the insistence on the participation of the Turkish minority in the peace talks. This minority has rather tenses relations with the Albanian majority and tend to stand on the Serbian side. But Turkey can make use of the « Islamic » or « ethnic » discourse only in moderation. Moreover, in the case of Kosovo, the fear of a parallel with the situation in southeast Anatolia prevented it from exerting diplomatie pressure, as it had been the case in the first phase of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina.",

        "text": "1In February-March 1998, tensions in Kosovo between Albanians and Serbs suddenly rose to an armed level. The appearance of a Kosovo Liberation Army (UCK, Ushtrica Çlirimtare e Kosoves) had seriously worried the Serbian authorities who decided on several arrests and attacked villages where UÇK fighters were finding - or were supposed to have found - support. Massacres of some Albanians took place and continued sporadically the following year, notably during the summer of 1998. The international community tried to mediate between the two opposed peoples but without any success. Finally NATO members, concerned that the Serbian authorities were organizing - or were about to organize - an ethnic cleansing, launched air strikes against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (March 1999-June 1999).\n\n2During the entire conflict, Turkish leaders did not take major initiatives in the international diplomatic arena. They even refrained, especially during the first phase of the fighting, from commenting on the events and the whole issue did not give rise to passionate political debate (as it had for Bosnia-Herzegovina). After the decision of military intervention was made by its NATO allies, here again, Turkish military and political leaders looked rather reluctant to invest in this military operation. Turkish leaders did not oppose the intervention (as they did in the case of Greece and Russia for example) but expressed their willingness to remain on the side.\n\n4A few years later, in 1998-1999, the conflict between Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo did not at all arouse the same concern and the same scandalized reactions - even though Albanians are almost entirely Muslims and were also subject to Serbian assaults. Concern for massacred fellow Muslims was not as visible, not as widely denounced and not so widely instrumentalized by some Turkish political factions. Turkish officials were extremely cautious in their public declarations on the responsibilities in this conflict and on the suggested diplomatic or military (re)-actions. Indeed, it seems that Turkish officials had some other concerns in mind and that the political and juridical nature of the conflict itself was embarrassing for them. Comparisons between the situation in Kosovo and the situation in South-East Turkey were actually made by some Western leaders here and there. Therefore, whatever the religious aspects of the conflict in Kosovo - or the reality of massacres of civilians - it was a matter of political priorities to stick to the principle of national unity over the claims of some “ terrorists ” and to the principle of non-interference in internal affairs. The numerous Turks of Albanian origin in Turkey did not play any major political role, nor did - at first - the Turkish minority in Kosovo whose presence and situation aroused interest but which only became a subject of political interest or political maneuvers later in 2000.\n\nA Cautious Diplomacy in the Balkans\n\n5The policy of the Turkish government concerning the conflicts in the Balkans has been very cautious since 1991. The options for Turkey were limited. It could act only in accord with the West, unilateral action was not possible or even wished for (in political or financial terms). It should not be forgotten that Turkey and Turkey's initiatives were carefully watched by the other Balkan countries, suspicious of its real intentions, and prompt to denounce any move on its part. Turkey's long domination of the Balkans sets it up as a suspicious actor in the eyes of most of the countries in the area ; it was against the Ottoman Empire that the Balkan nations forged their independence. This phenomenon of “ fundamental enmity ”is not a particularity of the Balkans, but what is particular in this case is the inability of the Balkan people to overcome their antagonism.\n\nKosovo: Another Dilemma for Turkey\n\n10As during the war in Bosnia, Turkey condemned the violence of the repression in Kosovo and proposed its participation in an international peacekeeping force, but, in contrast to its reaction toward the events in Bosnia, it did not display an intense diplomatic activism.\n\n16But Turkish leaders maintained their commitment to the preservation of the territorial integrity of the FRY and were extremely reluctant to intervene in the internal affairs of Kosovo. To reject the parallel with the situation in the southeast of Anatolia, they put forward two kinds of arguments :\n\n24 Hürriyet, 13/04/99.\n\nThe repression in Kosovo was on such a large scale that no comparison was possible. President Demirel even called this repression a “ genocide ” .\n\n25 Anadolu Ajansi. 28/04/99.\n\nThe nature of the conflict was completely different. “ They call them a minority in Kosovo but we do not have minorities in Turkey ”, declared Siileyman Demirel .\n\nThe Albanians in Istanbul:a Lobby for the Kosovo Cause?\n\nThe Turkish Minority in Kosovo\n\n32This is, here, a typical case of a minority squeezed between a majority (the Serbs in the RFY) and “ a minority in majority ” in its own province (the Albanians), fighting to get some rights. These Turks would be more comfortable in a multicultural society - and a federal administrative structure - than in a country dominated by Albanian nationalists. In sum, they are concerned with their long-term viability in Kosovo as an ethnic group. Their relations with the Albanians are therefore tainted with suspicions. On the other hand, Albanians view the “ pro-Turkish policy ” of Serbian authorities as an “ evil alliance ”. The Albanians notably accuse the Turks of having “ collaborated ” with the Serbs during the 1999 massacres and expulsions.\n\n75 The Turkish Democratic Union (TDB) became the Turkish Democratic Party (KTDP) during the Summer of (...)\n\n76 For example, forms for the elections were printed in English, Albanian and Serbian, as these were (...)\n\nthe Turkish Democratic Union (Turk Demokratik Birligi, TDB) , which is opposed to an Albanian domination and often perceived as pro-Serb, or, in any case, closer to the Serbs. For example, it opposed the boycott of the official (FRY) elections and schools after 1990. It is actively lobbying for the restitutions of the rights that the Turks were granted under the 1974 Constitution, and notably the restoration of Turkish as an official language since the UNMIK did not recognize it .\n\n77 Enter (Albanian Independent Press Agency), 22/03/98.\n\n78 It is apparently notably opposed to the addition of Turkish in registration forms for the election (...)\n\n79 Kosovalive, 07/09/01,28/0901.\n\nThe Turkish Popular Party (Turk Halk Partisi) is, on the contrary, close to the Albanians. It presented candidates at the “ illegal ” local elections of 22 March 1998 and it is opposed to the restitutions of the rights of the Turks. It is sometimes referred to, in the Turkish press, as the party of the “ Albanized Turks ” . This party is said to be close to the LDK leader, Ibrahim Rugova. Its support in Kosovo is, however, much less higher than its counterpart - and opponent - the TDB. For example, it failed to gather the required 1 000 signatures in order to be qualified for the November 2001 general elections .\n\nConclusion\n\n37Turkey did not make any significant contribution to settle the conflict in Kosovo. The fear of a parallel with the situation in southeast Anatolia prevented it from exerting diplomatic pressure, as it had been the case in the first phase of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. But Turkey was as well, and as it had been the case for Bosnia, careful not to antagonize Balkan populations highly sensitive to any Turkish interference in the area. Last, Turkey is not such an important actor in the Balkans and, in any case, its influence remains in the shadow of the US and Europe."
