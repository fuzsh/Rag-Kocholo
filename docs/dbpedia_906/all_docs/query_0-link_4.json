        "text": "Today’s Zaman was the English-language offshoot of the Islamic-conservative daily paper Zaman. Like its sister paper it was seen as a mouthpiece of the Gülen movement and had close ties with news agency Cihan, but adopted a more liberal tone. On 27 July 2016 it was banned and closed down by decree together with 44 other newspapers as part of the purge that followed the failed coup. Many of its employees have since been sent to prison or gone into exile."
