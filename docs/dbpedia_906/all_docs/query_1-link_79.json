        "text": "Turkish riot police have fired plastic bullets and tear gas to disperse hundreds of protesters who gathered outside an opposition newspaper the day after it was seized by authorities in a violent raid.\n\n\"Free press cannot be silenced,\" the protesters shouted.\n\nPolice used large amounts of tear gas, water cannons and plastic bullets to disperse the crowd of around 500 protesters outside the Istanbul premises of Zaman daily, witnesses said.\n\nThe Zaman newspaper, closely linked to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's rival Fethullah Gulen, was ordered into administration by Istanbul prosecutors yesterday.\n\nIt today published a defiant warning of the \"darkest days\" in the history of the press after authorities seized control of its headquarters in a dramatic late-night raid by riot police.\n\n\"The Constitution is suspended,\" the newspaper, which managed to print its latest issue after the violent takeover, said on its front page in large font on a black background.\n\n\"The Turkish press has experienced one of the darkest days in its history.\n\n\"Turkey's mass circulation newspaper was seized despite Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu's assurance that 'free press is our redline'.\"\n\nShortly before midnight (local time), a team of police arrived with two Turkish-made TOMA water cannon trucks, which are used by the police and exported to several countries.\n\nThey advanced military style towards the waiting supporters, firing the freezing water directly at them.\n\nUsing bolt-cutters to unlock the iron gate in front of the building, dozens of police then marched into the premises to seize the headquarters and formally place it under administration, pushing aside anyone who stood in their way, media images showed.\n\nOnce the building was cleared, the court-appointed administrators — lawyers Tahsin Kaplan and Metin Ilhan and writer Sezai Sengonul — were bussed inside the complex to begin their work, state-run newspaper Anatolia said.\n\nEU 'extremely worried' about press freedoms\n\nThe swoop against the paper, staunchly opposed to President Erdogan, caused immediate concern in Washington and Brussels over declining media freedoms in Turkey, a key EU ally.\n\nLeaders from two sides plan to meet in Brussels on Monday in a bid to fully implement a stalled November agreement under which Turkey is to curb the flow of migrants to Europe in return for aid and promises to speed up talks for its accession to the EU.\n\nEU enlargement commissioner Johannes Hahn said he was \"extremely worried\" about the move \"which jeopardises progress\" made by Turkey in other areas.\n\n\"The EU has repeatedly stressed that Turkey, as a candidate country, needs to respect and promote high democratic standards and practices, including freedom of the media,\" the EU's diplomatic service said in a statement.\n\n\"Free, diverse and independent media constitute one of the cornerstones of a democratic society by facilitating the free flow of information and ideas, and by ensuring transparency and accountability.\n\n\"Any country, and in particular those negotiating EU accession, needs to guarantee fundamental rights, including freedom of expression, and due judicial process, in line with the European Convention on Human Rights.\"\n\nOn an official visit to Iran, Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu denied any Government interference in the seizure of the newspaper.\n\n\"They are certainly not political but legal processes,\" he said in remarks carried by Turkish television.\n\nThe United States said the court order was \"the latest in a series of troubling judicial and law enforcement actions taken by the Turkish government targeting media outlets and others critical of it\".\n\n\"We urge Turkish authorities to ensure their actions uphold the universal democratic values enshrined in their own constitution, including freedom of speech and especially freedom of the press,\" State Department spokesman John Kirby said.\n\nThe daily Cumhuriyet newspaper's editor-in-chief Can Dundar and Ankara bureau chief Erdem Gul were released on an order from Turkey's top court last week after three months in jail on charges of publishing state secrets.\n\nBut they still face trial on March 25.\n\nIndependent pro-Kurdish television channel IMC TV was taken off air in Turkey last weekend following accusations that it broadcast \"terrorist propaganda\" for militants.\n\nMeanwhile almost 2,000 journalists, bloggers and ordinary citizens, including high school students, have found themselves prosecuted on accusations of insulting President Erdogan."
