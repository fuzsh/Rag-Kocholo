        "text": "Â An Overview\n\nÂ Iraqi Media\n\nÂ The Reports\n\nÂ Rare Voices of Dissent\n\nÂ Essential Reading\n\nIraqi workers check the al-Zaman newspaper, owned by Uday Hussein, Saddam's eldest son - October 2002.\n\nCredit: Agence France-Presse\n\nby Kimberly Tabor\n\nNot only is the press not free in Iraq, journalists must attempt to gather facts from wary -- and some would say terrorized -- Iraqis who are highly reluctant to criticize Saddam's regime. (Insulting the president is punishable by death.) Here's a brief introduction to the Fourth Estate in Iraq along with links to reports chronicling the country's dismal record regarding press freedom.\n\nAn Overview\n\n\"As far as the Arab world, Iraq has one of the most restricted medias, if not the most restricted,\" says Joel Campagna, Middle East program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) in New York City. Indeed, in a region where most countries in recent years have lessened the state's grip on media, Iraq's government continues to wield extraordinary control over the press. \"We haven't noticed any change in press freedoms in Iraq,\" says Campagna. \"They've remained consistently poor. The [Iraqi] government has given no indication that it will allow legitimate dissent or criticism.\"\n\nReporters Without Borders, a French organization that monitors press freedom worldwide, says that Iraq is one of the 10 countries that it considers most hostile to journalists and independent media. The group says that Saddam Hussein is a \"predator of press freedom\" and reports that the \"Iraqi regime uses every means to control the press and silence dissenting voices.\" It is, in fact, spelled out in Iraqi law that journalists in Iraq must not make \"any declaration or suggestion that might benefit an enemy at the expense of the country.\"\n\nUday Hussein, Saddam's oldest son, controls about a dozen newspapers in the country as well as Iraq's most influential television and radio stations. Further, the Iraqi Ministry of Information appoints all of the country's journalists, who must be members of the ruling Ba'ath Party and of the Journalists' Union, which is chaired by Uday. In a move ridiculed by some Western analysts, Uday was elected Journalist of the Century by the union in April 2000.\n\nForeign journalists who cover Iraq are faced with a variety of obstacles, from government censorship to limits on visa stays, says Campagna. In \"Air War: How Saddam Manipulates the U.S. Media,\" Franklin Foer, an associate editor of The New Republic, described the process of applying for an Iraqi visa as \"labyrinthine\":\n\nFirst you send the Iraqi consulate in Washington, D.C., a copy of your curriculum vitae and passport. If the Iraqis decide that you are eligible to apply, you fill out a form provided by the consulate that asks about your religion and relationship to the American government. During moments of crisis, such as the current one, four separate committees in Baghdad review the application. (The New Republic, Oct. 28, 2002)\n\nFoer says that visas are, in fact, the Ministry of Information's most salient tool for controlling the movements of foreign journalists in Iraq. Another tool is the ministry's provision of \"minders,\" state-sanctioned individuals who shadow a visiting journalist's every move and arrange interviews on the journalist's behalf. Anthony Cordesman, an expert on national security issues at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and an analyst for ABC News, has reported that the Ministry of Information \"maintains a long list of seemingly private Iraqis who are fluent in foreign languages.\" Those Iraqis are allowed to give \"private\" interviews, Cordesman says, and though they may appear to be somewhat critical of the regime, they've been handpicked to serve as mouthpieces for state propaganda.\n\nAl-Shabab (Youth) Radio producers at work in Baghdad - May 2002.\n\nCredit: Agence France-Presse"
