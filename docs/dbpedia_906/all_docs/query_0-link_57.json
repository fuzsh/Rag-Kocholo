        "text": "Andrew Finkel online lecture: âTales from the Turkish newsroom: Why Newspapers Sometimes Lieâ, 15 April 2021 - flyer:\n\n1- You first came to Turkey as a child presumably with your parents on a tourist trip. Do you recall much from that first sightings and do you think they have any bearing to your later basing a good portion of your life in that country?\n\nThe first glimpse was far more dramatic than you suggest! If you will allow me to quote from something I wrote a while ago (I am not sure I could put it as clearly now):\n\nâThat first sight is difficult to forget. My own was one snowy evening in January 1967. An impressive city at the best of times, Istanbul seemed paradise after a month on my back in a Bulgarian hospital. The school Christmas holiday had got off to a poor start when the family Volvo, one of those ungainly hunchback affairs that looked like a silicone-injected VW Beatle, made an unscheduled stop against a Bulgarian tree trunk somewhere on an icy road outside Sofia. I spent New Yearâs Eve with my family in a hospital room, munching hard-boiled eggs and cheerful to be alive. I remember the benign ministering of an English-speaking nurse called Vera, acquiring a deep dislike of rose flavoured anything, and the kindness of a stranger who discovered my spectacles among the car wreckage and brought them unbidden to the hospital to make me see again.\n\nBy contrast, Istanbul was a world of opulence. We were extracted from an over-heated compartment of the Orient Express, poured into a wide-finned white Chevrolet, that was vintage even then, to be driven not along the coast but overland through a snowstorm into a wilderness beyond MecidiyekÃ¶y. The same journey would be impossible now. The green plateau of mulberry trees through which we travelled is now planted with the tall glass towers of Istanbulâs financial district. There were intimations of change, even then. Some of the land was fenced off and there were a few advertising billboards â a naÃ¯ve depiction of a stork delivering a baby and the name of the bank that would help you build your nest. (âDonât they have any respect for nature!â I still hear my father say from the front of the car every time I pass through what is now a thicket of shopping malls wrapped in the spaghetti junction of commuter roads). The car stalled in the ice as it approached the heights that looked down on Tarabya, just over halfway up the towards the narrows where the shores suddenly widen at a great elbow-bend. The grey sky, mirrored in the water below was nothing like the inviting cobalt blue of the Bosphorus on a spring day. It is hard to explain why, half a century later, the spectacle of that stormy bay, bleached of colour, is still etched in my mindâs eye or why Istanbul has become a city I can never quite bring myself to leave.â\n\n2- Who was your first Turkish language teacher and is there a tale behind finding this person who clearly was good at this task?\n\nI was taught by the famous - some might say infamous GÃ¼zin Berkmen - a pioneer of teaching Turkish to foreigners including young British diplomats who were to go on to become ambassadors in later years. I first met her that winter I arrived in Turkey. My parents were eager that we do something constructive while we recuperate from our car accident so we went several times a week to an apartment in Taksim for lessons. She was a strict grammarian, eager that we learn the fundamentals of the language, but she was equally concerned that we understand the rules of Turkish life. And the most basic was how to drink a cup of Turkish coffee. As our lessons began, the first words I learned were the sugary Åekerli all the way down to sade - plain and unadorned. I may have struggled to put one word in front of another, but lesson after lesson, cup after cup, I began to acquire the conviviality and manners the language required. It is impossible to think ill of any nation when one of the first people you meet is quite so vivacious and steeped in charm. I am totally devoted to her memory. I am pleased to have proposed that she be given an MBE for having done probably more than any other human being alive to increase understanding in a literal way between the UK and Turkey.\n\n3- Turks in general are amongst the most hospitable people on the planet but unlike us Westerners who have lived for a generation in very mixed societies and are used to it, their experience of foreigners / occupiers in their history not a happy one, so perhaps the strong notions of âyabancÄ±â puts an invisible barrier to fully enter their worlds, though of course talking here in big brush-strokes. Do you think foreigners have to work extra hard, beyond good language skills, to become fully âlocalâ in this society?\n\nA difficult question to answer. As you say foreigners are made to feel welcome in Turkey - until you reach a space where you are not so much made to feel unwelcome as not expected to be able to fit in. It would be an exaggeration to say the opposite is true of England but I realise I did not really acclimatise to life in the UK until I went to university and had literally won a place in British society. I think what many foreigners feels so attractive about Turkey is how easy it is to gain admittance to families and friendships. In recent years Turkey like elsewhere has become more polarised and this has made some more suspicious of foreigners whom they assume are on an opposing side. The converse of this is that foreigners are no longer the novelty they were when I first came here and people are less curious about visitors But I still think people appreciate those who make the effort to understand their society and unlike many places do not feel patronised by such interest.\n\n4- Turkey is clearly a fascinating world where all evolution / change, from cultural outlook, politics, relations with the outside world etc. is on a much faster track and at times partly chaotic shift and clearly with a degree collateral damage to these individual strands along the way. Dealing with the social / cultural side, do you these âcultural degradationsâ in terms of âold fashioned manners of Anatoliaâ eroding in the vast sprawls of big cities or do you think it is a nationwide loss in âgentle mannersâ?\n\nWell, clearly Turkey - or more particularly Turkish cities - change at a a pace that that makes standing still feel like falling through air. The worst part of that change is really the erosion of green space and natural and historical value and this is of great concern - far more so than the erosion of the civility that characterises many aspects of everyday exchange. It is true that cities which were populated by first and second generation in-migrants are now populated by fourth or fifth generation urbanites and this has produced a variety of cultures and counter culture which I am probably too old to appreciate or understand. On the other hand, it also means that women are no longer reluctant to enter public space the way they might have been decades ago. When I first came to Turkey it was unusual even to see a woman in most restaurants.\n\n5- You are amongst a tiny handful of foreign journalists who worked in Turkish media such as the now defunct Zaman newspaper. Did you seek this position or were you invited based on your earlier writings viewed by the decisions makers in those publications?\n\nI never applied for a job on a Turkish paper with the exception of my first job on a short-lived English language paper some thirty-odd years ago. I was always recruited. The flip side to this is that I was frequently fired for things that I wrote, including the English language Zaman paper where I criticised my own newspaper for appearing to defend the imprisonment of journalists. Sabah fired me on the orders of the military back in the late 1990s. Etc, etc. Working in the Turkish press was a bit like riding a wild horse, fun but a bit bruising.\n\n6- Early on in your journalistic career in Turkey you knowingly put your name to a false article whose claims were so ridiculous it was to be taken by a pinch of salt by any self-respecting reader, so you could say the moral hazard was limited. Do you think age / experience comes to it, so say today, would you take a different stand?\n\nWell, that was the one paper I quit rather than was fired from - not at the time of that incident but not long afterwards. The reason for my delay is that I had a position of authority and I felt some obligation to the people I was working with so it wasnât that simple just to walk off in a huff. That, and I needed a job to go to! What I discovered as I continued in the Turkish press was a deeply corrupted industry. The proprietor of the paper you refer to was arrested for petty fraud. My next proprietor went to jail for serious fraud, as did the next one after that. And of course I was to stand trial myself a some years later not for telling lies but trying to tell the truth. I realised that the media in Turkey was so compromised that they were unwilling or unable to stand up for honest reporting. It took me long enough, I confess, to develop a concern for the integrity and independence of the press not to mention trying to do something about it. Part of the problem was finding allies. In the end I ended up founding, with colleagues, P24 - an NGO dedicated to defending independent journalism and free expression. Not quite 25 years after the false article about smuggling heroin in cauliflowers appeared.\n\n7- Though this is clearly well before your time, when the Taksim Opera House burnt down in 1970 a short-while after its long construction, the state on very flimsy evidence pointed the finger at âcommunist saboteursâ, who were held in detention and after 5 years these 40+ people who could have been hung were released without a pardon. Similarly the 1955 anti-Greek pogroms were blamed by right-wing newspapers of the time on âcommunistsâ. Do you think it is ironic that it was early Soviet Russia who provided the crucial arms to help repel the invading Greek armies and later British and allied occupation forces by the Kemalists in the early 1920s yet the term continues to be used as the âbogeymanâ by generations of Turkish civil and military leaders?\n\nKind of you to think I am too young to remember the Opera House fire though I was not living in Turkey at the time. And it is true I was not quite a toddler at the time of the 1955 pogroms. Curiously enough my daughter is writing a book about the witch hunt that followed the 1970 conflagration and I am toying with writing a book set in 1955. I suppose what you refer to is just one of the many ironies of history , along with the pro-Russia faction in Turkish politics today. But Turkey was a Cold War stalwart - a stance which played into domestic politics. Now a majority of Turks see the US as the enemy.\n\n8- Looking at the columnists in the many pro-government newspapers such as Sabah, Hurriyet, Milliyet, we see many veterans still writing stories as they were back in the 1990s when the had clearly had more freedom to criticise, and investigate. Presumably with such a long-track record many do not have the financial stress of having to work but choose to work in this âgilded cageâ, presumably some of their colleagues are forced out of work or worse. Do you think this is an ego thing and people can be like a frog in pot slowly warming up?\n\nMy own theory for the reason Turkish columnists became so powerful is that people âunderstoodâ at a some level that the front pages of their newspapers were flexible with the truth so they trusted the individual who name, photo and reputation was on the top of the column. In 1990 along came private television which made those columnists household names on the endless news analysis programmes. I guess I benefitted from the same phenomenon and would appear on Turkish screens from time to time. By the end of the decade the government under pressure from the military began to weed out critical voices. I remember when I first got a column on Sabah in 1996, I had a phone call from an older, wiser friend congratulation me for joining the club and getting a job for life. Instead I ended up going on trial for insulting the Turkish military. True, several years later I got a job on Milliyet, but it wasnât quite the same buzz. Of course I never really understood the red lines or thought they applied to me. Those you refer to who remain âin postâ obviously do. And there is a new generation of columnist who âchannelâ government thinking - some of whom are designated hitmen to discredit government opponents. This a relic of the old days when politicians used to have their avatars who reflected their views in the media. But of course newspapers and even television is less influential than it was, thanks to social media.\n\n9- These old newspapers of Turkey are kept up by a new generation of press barons who get the cream of lucrative mostly construction based tenders, as clearly tendering is heavily biased along political lines in modern Turkey. So news-stands have a whole collection of newspapers on offer, with similar political / analysis contained within, so the âcake slicesâ must be very thin indeed today, as people have the internet to access in all its flavours. Is the price of being close to the 'select few' in terms of âjuicy contractsâ being a press-baron today? What happens if the government falls - are there a lot of secrets that make such a scenario itself a dangerous proposition?\n\nI write about this quite a bit (I attach a short bibliography below) and describe what I call the Midas Touch where government captures media groups, makes them loyal to itself but at the same time emasculate the ability of those very press organs to convey information. The major change I observe is that in the 1990s newspaper owners used their influence to commercial advantage or to secure favours that would allow them to acquire bank licences or privatisation issues. Now newspapers have very little influence and those who already enjoy government favour are commanded to acquire media - a loss making proposition and they do reluctantly. So the question you ask is the right one. What happens when the government is no longer and private media owners are left holding a very expensive bag? I think we saw a bit of that in the 2019 municipal election when the ruling party lost the Istanbul municipality and came under pressure from (I speculate) media organisations to resit the election - even though wiser councils would have told them this was a foolish option. Despite 90% of heritage media being pro-government, the ruling party candidate lost the election by an even greater margin.\n\n10- Turkey has a growing cadre of internet based critical journalism both individual and group based such as Ahval, Halk TV etc. The Turkish government has never used the ânuclear optionâ of closing the internet down (or banning these Youtube platforms), could this be on the cards in the future if poll ratings show a continued slide in their fortunes?\n\nWell we have seen bans on Twitter in 2014 and even access to Wikipedia has been blocked. An amendment to the law governing the internet requires large platforms - Facebook, Tic Tok, Instagram or Twitter- to maintain data and offices on Turkish territory - and we are seeing a cat and mouse game whereby such companies do the minimum to comply. The penalty for disobeying the law is to see a reduction in bandwidth which would make those platforms unusable. But of course the danger here is not just that you court resentment (Twitter usage is reported to have gone up while it was banned with people using VPNs) but that you deny yourself a useful tool. After all, the Turkish president has 17.7 million followers on Twitter. There would be a huge public outcry if Facebook were banned.\n\n11- Under Ottoman law virtually all land belonged to the state or vakif institutions connected to the state. For the past 60 years perhaps there has been an on-going stealing of this land and politicians later giving title-deeds to these âgece-konduâ which over time gentrify a bit and become the massive aprons of concrete around all large towns of Turkey. Do you see this as the âoriginal sinâ, so this moral greyness at best, then provides a basis for a culture of âout to get whatever the state can provideâ allowing for corruption, mismanagement and waste of funds, so the country is left behind in development?\n\nThis of course was the great insight of Turkish social science during the 1970s - that government was losing the ability to plan for the great urban expansion because it was squandering control over the great public good it held, urban land. I write about what I call a culture of complicity in which ordinary individuals were forced into an illegal status (no planning permission or in some cases title deeds to their homes) and thus tolerated greater malfeasance from their political betters. Instead of seeing the cycle between democracy and martial law as alternatives, I see them as part of a cycle. You act âillegallyâ during periods of populist democracy by occupying state land and then see those gains legitimised by the new slate ushered in by a military regime. With the possibility of a coup - or at least a successful coup- so much diminished, that cycle has been made synchronised - which is another way of saying government is more authoritarian.\n\n12- The 2001 economic / banking crash had devastating effect on the country and the newspapers which folded were effectively then sold on the cheap to the companies close to the government. Perhaps Turkey is still trying to recover from this economic / journalism crash? Did the press before that time not warn of the huge risks the country was running before this crash and is there an organisation of standing today which can accurately also monitor and report on debt levels / leverage etc. that is the crux of a future possible repeat of a melt-down?\n\nIn the 1990s Turkish media groups were very eager to obtain bank licences (this was a period of high inflation where banks took money from depositors and lent to the government with high spreads - so even I could have been a banker) and were thus actively complicit in the process which led to the 2000 and 20001 financial crises. Media today cooperates closely with government because it is owned by groups which have substantial non-media commercial interests - while independent media faces penalties and legal sanctions if it is outspoken. You even see brokerage firms self-censoring in the information it privates to private clients out of fear of prosecution. This, as you suggest, does not encourage good governance. I do not believe that they current government believes media can be independent - any more than it believes the Central Bank can be independent. On the other hand the Western financial press, to take the obvious example, did not have a sterling record in alerting the world to the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. But there is another phenomenon which is the rise of low or no-cost social media - which not just in Turkey but everywhere in the world changes the dynamics and economic logic of news gathering. Rather naively I believe that information does get through which is different from saying that public opinion accurately reflects legitimate concerns. It is no great secret that the Turkish economy faces serious perils even if the future remains opaque.\n\n13- You are also a founding member of P24, an Istanbul-based NGO that supports independent journalism. Clearly this organisation has a delicate and difficult job in these days. Despite the huge erosion in rights there is still a functioning judiciary that seems to try to do its job despite massive governmental interventions. Do you think part of the remit of this NGO is just being there as a moral support to those who seek to do their job and follow the letter of the law, based on the original very liberal Swiss law?\n\nP24 was founded by journalists - including three former editors-in-chief - and journalism is what we know best - and while we advocate on behalf of those who face judicial peril we are happiest providing platforms and opportunities for writers and journalists to do their best work. So we create as a mix between being reactive to injustice and pro-active in providing innovative content. As you suggest, we believe that things have to happen in the light. So one of the things we do is monitor courtroom proceedings. At the same time we have a programme to improve the quality of environmental reporting. The best defence of free expression is to use it.\n\n14- Your upcoming novel, âThe Adventure of the Second Wifeâ will be published later this year. Has this anything to do with your dear wife who is also a long-term Turkophile?\n\nCaroline is a distinguished Ottoman historian but not the second wife in question (Iâve only had the one). Much of my book is set in the late nineteenth century and while Carolineâs chapter in Osmanâs Dream on that period is really very good, it is not her specialist topic. My book has two premises: The first is that Abdulhamid II was a great Sherlock Holmes aficionado and would have the stories translated and read to him by his foster brother, like Scheherazade, before he went to sleep at night. The second, not a matter of historical fact, is that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was asked on his deathbed which of the Sherlock Holmes adventures he liked the best. He replied that he resented them all for distracting from his more serious work, but that there was one that continued to intrigue him - that of the Second Wife. Of course there is no Adventure of the Second Wife and that is a mystery which continued to obsess Sherlock Holmes enthusiasts down the ages. Happily, it is one I am able to solve.\n\n- Hereâs that bibliography I promised:\n\nâUsing Old Media to Capture New in Turkeyâ in Media Capture in the Digital Age ed.
