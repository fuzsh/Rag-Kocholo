        "text": "Turkish authorities have seized control of the opposition newspaper Zaman, one of the country’s last remaining opposition media outlets.\n\nZaman is linked to Islamic cleric Fetullah Gulen, a former ally of\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Now the president says Gulen has been plotting against his government by building a network of supporters inside Turkey’s judiciary, police and media.\n\nAuthorities have seized and shut down opposition media outlets associated with the Gulen movement before.\n\nErdogan has led a crackdown against the Gulen movement after police and prosecutors seen as sympathetic to the cleric opened a corruption investigation into Erdogan’s inner circle three years ago."
