        "text": "The Art Newspaper is expanding its international network with the launch of a Turkish edition in September. The new publication is owned by Ali Güreli, the founder of Contemporary Istanbul, the leading art fair in the region. He says: “We are happy to be joining The Art Newspaper family, and to be spearheading a new era in Turkish art publishing and cultural discourse.”\n\nInna Bazhenova, the publisher of The Art Newspaper Group, says: “The creation of The Art Newspaper Türkiye is an absolutely natural phenomenon. Modern Turkey is becoming one of the world leaders in the art process, and an increased interest in art is always associated with the search for information. The Art Newspaper exists to ensure that people have enough information about art.”\n\nOverseen by The Art Newspaper Group and a team of local writers, the Turkish-language title will publish 11 issues per year, with English language versions available during the week of Contemporary Istanbul (28 September-1 October).\n\nThe launch of The Art Newspaper Türkiye was celebrated at a reception at Les Trois Rois Hotel in Basel earlier this week organised in collaboration with Turkish Airlines, Contemporary Istanbul and The Art Newspaper Group.\n\nThe 18th edition of Contemporary Istanbul will be held in a new venue, the historic Tersane Istanbul located at a former Ottoman-era shipyard on the shores of the Golden Horn. The fair is due to include 65 galleries and art initiatives from 22 countries. This year’s edition of Contemporary Istanbul will also unveil CI Photo focus, a new photography focus section organised in collaboration with the Borusan Contemporary institution."
