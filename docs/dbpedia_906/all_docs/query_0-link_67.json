        "text": "Question for written answer P-008129/2011\n\nto the Commission\n\nRule 117\n\nMaria Eleni Koppa (S&D)\n\nIn an interview with the ‘Zaman’ newspaper (4 September 2011) the Turkish Minister for European Affairs, Egemen Bagis, made a number of provocative statements, including the assertion that the Republic of Cyprus was acting illegally in carrying out exploration activities outside its territorial waters, indicating that this had already occurred and that Turkey had responded by sending in navy vessels. He went on to add, ‘That is what the fleet is for. That is why we have trained our marines. That is why we have equipped our navy. Anything is possible’.\n\nIn view of this:\n\nWhat view does the Commission take of this direct threat of force by Turkey to undermine the sovereignty and sovereign rights of an EU Member State and what action does it intend to take in response to this?\n\nWhat view does it take of these utterances by the Turkish Minister, given that the Republic of Cyprus is clearly entitled, under international law and under its agreements on the delimitation of the economic zone of February 2003, January 2007 and December 2010 with Egypt, Lebanon and Israel respectively, to explore and make use of its natural resources ?\n\nDoes the Commission consider that Turkey's tactics are in accordance with the image that it has recently been trying to project of a country seeking to contribute stability and peace to a troubled area?\n\nOJ C 154 E, 31/05/2012"
