        "text": "Country Context\n\nTürkiye\n\n2023\n\nPopulation, million\n\n85.8\n\nGDP, current US$ trillion\n\n1.024\n\nGDP per capita, current US$\n\n11,938.8\n\nLife Expectancy at Birth, years\n\n76\n\nTürkiye is the 17th largest economy in the world, according to IMF, with a GDP of $1.024 trillion as of 2023. It is a member of the OECD and the G20 and an increasingly important donor of official development assistance (ODA).\n\nTürkiye pursued ambitious reforms and enjoyed high growth rates between 2006 and 2017, which propelled the country to the higher reaches of upper-middle-income status and reduced poverty. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 5.4% between 2002 and 2022, resulting in income per capita (in real terms) that was more than doubled over the same period. Growth was accompanied by rapid poverty reduction; the poverty rate decreased by more than half from above 20% in 2007 to 7.6% in 2021.\n\nFor Türkiye to preserve and further its progress, it must navigate through significant challenges that encompass economic resilience, poverty and inclusion, and sustainability. Key among these is revitalizing economic growth in a post-COVID era marked by a challenging macroeconomic climate and a downward trend in productivity observed since the mid-2010s. Furthermore, although economic expansion has continued, the reduction in poverty rates has lost momentum since 2016, hindered by increasing inequality. On the environmental front, Türkiye's industrial base and transport heavily relies on carbon-intensive processes and fossil fuels, presenting both challenges and opportunities in light of the European Union's forthcoming Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism—a critical consideration given the EU's role as a major market for Turkish exports. Lastly, Türkiye's distinct geographic and socioeconomic conditions significantly increase its vulnerability to the adverse effects of climate change, underscoring the imperative for comprehensive adaptation measures.\n\nTürkiye is addressing the effects of the earthquakes that hit the country on February 6, 2023. With magnitudes of 7.8 and 7.5, the earthquakes were followed by thousands of aftershocks and another 6.7 magnitude earthquake on February 20. According to official statistics, they caused more than 50,000 casualties, injured 107,000 people, damaged or destroyed 1.9 million housing units, and displaced 3.3 million people, of whom two million needed shelter. An assessment by the Government of Türkiye with support from the EU, the United Nations (UN), and the World Bank Group estimated the recovery and reconstruction needs associated with the earthquakes at around $81.5 billion. Risks also remain high, with about 70% of the country’s population living in first- and second-degree seismic zones.\n\nFollowing the May 2023 elections, the newly appointed economic team has launched a comprehensive policy set to address past macroeconomic imbalances, especially high inflation. Since then, Türkiye has been moving to normalizing its macroeconomic strategies. The country experienced a robust economic expansion of 4.5% in 2023. However, this growth rate is expected to decrease to 3.0% in 2024, before picking up again in subsequent years on a stronger basis. Longstanding macro and structural challenges that undermine potential growth—including high inflation, low productivity growth, low labor force participation, and employment levels, and weakening foreign direct investment—would require robust fiscal measures and ambitious structural reforms to help accelerate sustainable economic growth.\n\nLast Updated: Apr 09, 2024\n\nStrategy\n\nThe Türkiye Country Partnership Framework (CPF) is the World Bank Group strategy to deliver impactful solutions at greater scale and speed in Türkiye over FY24-FY28. The CPF is fully aligned with the Bank Group’s mission of ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity on a livable planet and with the Government of Türkiye’s 12th National Development Plan (NDP) 2024-2028. It aims to accelerate progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and support recovery and reconstruction from recent shocks. The CPF outlines how the Bank Group will further scale up impact in one of its largest country portfolios to meet priority country and global challenges.\n\nA key focus of the CPF is to help the country mobilize private capital to address key emerging challenges on the growth, poverty and inclusion, and sustainability fronts.\n\nDuring the CPF period, the Bank Group will focus on selected challenges under three broad areas:\n\nHigh and sustainable productivity growth: The focus will be on promoting climate-smart agriculture to strengthen resilience against climate change and bolster food security; greening the industrial sector to reduce carbon emissions and maintain trade competitiveness; supporting economic recovery in areas affected by the 2023 earthquakes.\n\nInclusive services and jobs: To address income and other inequalities, the focus will be to improve jobs for women, youth, and vulnerable groups; reduce disparities in health and education access and quality; and support resilient municipal infrastructure and services.\n\nStrengthen resilience against natural disasters: To help protect Türkiye’s people and economy, the Bank Group will prioritize disaster resilience and preparedness, management of natural resources and the transition to clean energy.\n\nThe CPF also emphasizes the need to accelerate digitalization, vital for boosting productivity and public service delivery. The Bank Group will work across many fronts to accelerate the use of digital technology, including improving the digital business ecosystem, supporting seismic and climate-resilient urban planning, extending hybrid education opportunities and improving financial inclusion.\n\nThere are 30 active IBRD operations amounting to $11.7 billion. The portfolio also includes one project financed by the Global Environment Facility (GEF)and six trust fund-supported projects, including almost $600 million in European Union trust funds through the Facility for Refugees in Türkiye.\n\nKey Advisory Services and Analytics (ASA) Activities: The ASA portfolio is strategically consolidated around core and extended core ASAs including: Country Climate and Development Report, Programmatic Public Finance Review, Pandemic Preparedness and Response, Country Green Growth, Quality Learning and Emergency Response Roadmap, Understanding the Drivers of Regional Disparities in Türkiye and Sustainable, Efficient and Safe Transport for Türkiye.\n\nLast Updated: Apr 09, 2024\n\nIn 2023, Türkiye's GDP expanded a 4.5%, fueled mainly by robust increases in private consumption (12.8% in real terms), investment (8.9%), and government consumption (5.2%). Exports contracted 2.7% in 2023 while imports grew firmly at 11.7%, dragging on growth. Sector-wise, the service sector grew by 4.8% and construction by 7.8%, benefiting from earthquake recovery efforts. The labor market remained resilient, with a 9.1% unemployment rate in January, despite the low labor force participation.\n\nThe current account deficit improved to $45.4 billion in 2023 (4.2% of GDP) from $49.1 billion in 2022, notably in the latter half of the year. Factors such as reduced foreign exchange volatility, the steady depreciation of the lira, a rebound in portfolio inflows, and a significant drop in the CDSs on Turkish assets (from over 700 to 320 by the end of March) contributed to a recovery in the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) net reserves, from -$5.7 billion to +$19.6 billion as of March 15.\n\nInflation decreased from 57.7% in January 2023 to 38.2% in June 2023. Still, it escalated to 68.5% by March 2024, driven by factors including the lira's depreciation, significant minimum wage hikes, tax adjustments, and strong demand. Despite easing credit market restrictions, the high inflation and moderately strong capital levels have restrained bank loan growth. The banking sector, while facing maturity mismatches, has shown improvements in its foreign exchange position and capitalization, with non-performing loans decreasing and the ratio improving significantly.\n\nThe overall fiscal balance deteriorated to below -5% of GDP in 2023 (from -0.8 in 2022) due to rising expenditures and earthquake-related investment needs, and the primary balance was close to -3% of GDP (from +1.4 in 2022). However, the fiscal deficit is relatively low excluding earthquake-related expenditures. Public debt remains moderate at around 30% of GDP in 2023.\n\nPoverty continued to decline but inequality widened between 2020 and 2021; the Gini coefficient increased to 46.0 in 2021 as the bottom and top income deciles reaped the largest benefits of growth. The bottom decile experienced the highest real increase in labor income (26%), likely driven by the minimum wage increase that in 2021 exceeded CPI inflation; while the top decile reaped the highest benefits from real increases in business incomes (96%), likely due to the surge in asset prices. Poverty reduction was largely due to increased labor earnings.\n\nLooking ahead, economic growth is expected to slow to 3.0% in 2024, on the back of policy tightening and slower global growth, before picking up pace in subsequent years. Due to stringent monetary policies, inflation is expected to gradually decrease after peaking in May 2024, while the current account balance is anticipated to improve from 2024 onwards. The general budget deficit is likely to remain elevated in 2024 despite fiscal consolidation efforts, partly due to earthquake recovery needs.\n\nAddressing structural issues and implementing pro-growth reforms are critical for enhancing private sector productivity and investment in the mid-term. Poverty reduction is expected to continue in the short term, driven by wage increases outpacing inflation. However, without changes in growth distribution, inequality might rise, potentially hindering long-term poverty alleviation efforts.\n\nThe economic forecast hinges on the continuation of current policies, with balanced risks. Downsides include low net reserves, geopolitical tensions, fiscal vulnerabilities, and political pressures against policy normalization. Conversely, increased credibility of the economic team could attract more investments, stabilizing the currency and expediting economic adjustments.\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\n2024f\n\n2025f\n\n2026f\n\nReal GDP growth, at constant market prices\n\n11.4\n\n5.5\n\n4.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.6\n\n4.3\n\nPrivate Consumption\n\n15.4\n\n18.9\n\n12.8\n\n2.3\n\n3.1\n\n4.2\n\nGovernment Consumption\n\n3.0\n\n4.2\n\n5.2\n\n2.5\n\n2.1\n\n1.7\n\nGross Fixed Capital Formation\n\n7.2\n\n1.3\n\n8.9\n\n2.9\n\n2.9\n\n3.1\n\nExports\n\n25.1\n\n9.9\n\n-2.7\n\n4.5\n\n5.2\n\n5.9\n\nImports\n\n1.7\n\n8.6\n\n11.7\n\n3.7\n\n4.2\n\n5.6\n\nReal GDP Growth, at constant factor prices\n\n12.7\n\n6.2\n\n4.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.6\n\n4.3\n\nAgriculture\n\n-3.0\n\n1.3\n\n-0.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.5\n\n1.5\n\nIndustry\n\n13.0\n\n-0.6\n\n3.7\n\n4.6\n\n4.8\n\n5.0\n\nServices\n\n13.2\n\n10.1\n\n4.7\n\n2.5\n\n3.3\n\n4.2\n\nInflation (CPI), avg.\n\n19.6\n\n72.3\n\n53.9\n\n57.8\n\n28.9\n\n16.4\n\nCurrent Account balance (% of GDP)\n\n-0.9\n\n-5.4\n\n-4.2\n\n-2.8\n\n-2.4\n\n-2.5\n\nNet Foreign Direct Investment (% of GDP)\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n0.7\n\n0.9\n\n1.1\n\n1.4\n\nFiscal Balance (% of GDP)\n\n-2.6\n\n-0.8\n\n-5.4\n\n-5.4\n\n-3.7\n\n-2.4\n\nDebt (% of GDP)\n\n40.4\n\n30.8\n\n29.7\n\n29.9\n\n30.5\n\n31.2\n\nPrimary Balance (% of GDP)\n\n0.0\n\n1.4\n\n-2.5\n\n-0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\nUpper middle-income poverty rate (USD\n\n6.85 in 2017 PPP)\n\n7.6\n\n7.0\n\n6.6\n\n6.4\n\n6.1\n\n5.7\n\nTotal GHG emissions (KTCO2e) (growth)\n\n9.7\n\n-5.2\n\n1.8\n\n2.3\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\nLast Updated: Apr 09, 2024"
