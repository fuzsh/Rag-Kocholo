As of Sunday, or rather as of today, we are publishing a Zaman issue which is no longer in cooperation with Zaman in Turkey because it was seized by the state. This is the edition our subscribers in Germany receive. In Germany, we have 14,300 subscribers to the print version.”\n\nDark day for free media. Raids of #Zaman unacceptable. #Turkey must be better than this. #FreeMediaCannotBeSilencedpic.twitter.com/cO07bJOrcq\n\n— Kenan كنان (@KenanRahmani) March 5, 2016\n\nThe clampdown on the pro opposition paper by the Turkish state has been internationally condemned with German politicians joining in the criticism\n\nGerman Green Party, Cem Ozdemir said:\n\n“This must have consequences on our relations with Turkey.The European Union is a community of values and those who want to become part of this community of values must respect the freedom of the press and the freedom of opinion.”\n\nThe Turkish authorities seized control of Zaman on Friday in a widening crackdown against supporters of US-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, an influential foe of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Zaman has been affiliated with Gulen.\n\n#Eu is making a 3 BLN € deal with dictator #Erdogan who raids indipendent #Zaman newspaper! #ThisIsNotMyEUhttps://t.co/n0zQ1l0PVI\n\n— Giuseppe Fiamingo (@italianestero) March 5, 2016\n\nIn a further development the private Cihan News Agency which is a sister company of Zaman daily has also been taken over.\n\nThe agency was one of only two main sources providing election results. The other one being the state owned Anatolian News Agency."
