        "text": "Zaman was founded in 1986 and was the first Turkish daily to go online in 1995. Mission & Vision Zaman UK will be offering developments in Turkey and the world through the perspective of the Zaman Media Group and it is the top aim of these brand-new newspapers. Another major target of these newspapers is to attempt to lay out a clear picture of the societies in which our readers from any background live. From this point of view, Zaman UK will support people wishing to preserve their essential values, the values that make them who they are, while also aiming to contribute to their integration in the society they live in. Another crucial objective of this paper is to articulate the demands and problems of Turks living in the UK and to convey them to officials. Its target group is certainly not only the Turks. That its publication language is predominantly English is a clear indication of this. Zaman UK will act as part of a vision of interpreting Turkey to foreign nationals, including Turkey’s perspective and stance on global and local developments, Turkey’s people, their culture, values, etc. This newspaper will span 40 pages in Britain, with 20 pages in English and 20 in Turkish. We are launching this paper with the intention of producing a lasting work, invoking the assistance of the Divine for success. We hope you will accompany us on this journey.\n\nWebsite\n\nhttp://www.zamanonline.co.uk\n\nExternal link for Zaman UK\n\nIndustry\n\nMedia Production\n\nCompany size\n\n11-50 employees\n\nHeadquarters\n\nLondon\n\nType\n\nPublic Company\n\nFounded\n\n2010\n\nSpecialties\n\nWeekly Zaman, Newspaper, Zaman Britanya, Design, Advertisement, Print, Articles, and News"
