        "text": "Capture by creating its own private media\n\nAt the end of 1990s four major holding companies were dominant in the mainstream media sector in Turkey: Doğan, Bilgin, Uzan, and Çukurova. According to the report presented to the Media Inquiry Committee of the Turkish Grand National Assembly in 2002, 84% of the daily newspapers sold in Turkey belonged to the Doğan, Bilgin or Çukurova group (cf. Özsever 2004, p. 125). The 2001 economic crisis brought about a crash, especially in the banking sector, which directly influenced the Bilgin and Uzan groups. The Tasarruf Mevduatı Sigorta Fonu—the Savings Deposit Insurance Fund (TMSF) expropriated their media assets, including several newspapers, television and radio outlets. While these two important groups were excluded from the media sector, two new big actors joined the club of media patron, namely Doğuş and Ciner (cf. Yeşil 2018, p. 245). Although there were important differences and even some conflicting interests among these media patrons (cf. Özsever 2004, p. 122), they had at least two areas in common. Firstly, as supporters of neoliberal policies, they were opposed to any kind of journalist organization. Secondly, they were not members of the AKP’s close circle.\n\nDuring its first term the AKP government tried to influence the mainstream media dominated by these groups using a carrot and stick strategy, like previous governments. At the same time, some other media groups such as Ihlas, Albayrak, and Gülen1’s newspapers and TV channels with Islamist backgrounds were becoming richer (cf. Özsever 2004, p. 120). However, the circulation numbers and ratings of these partisan media group outlets were limited. The AKP realized soon that they had to develop a new ownership profile to have more direct control over the management of newspapers and TV channels to influence the “construction of public knowledge”. Businessmen from Erdoğan’s inner circle who had started to prosper under the AKP government had to be encouraged and, if necessary, pushed to buy mainstream media outlets. To create a partisan mainstream media, the AKP used two main strategies.\n\nThe first strategy was confiscation followed by a manipulated tender. This scenario first took place over the Star (a daily newspaper) and Kanal 24 (a news channel), which had belonged to the Uzan group before the 2001 crisis. In 2004 the TMSF confiscated different media outlets belonging to the Uzan group, including Star and Kanal 24 (cf. Hürriyet 2004, February 14). In 2007, both outlets were sold to a businessman through a public tender organized by TMSF. However, there was another change of ownership of these outlets and they were sold to the AKP-friendly Sancak Holding group (cf. T24 2009, May 20). The second scene was played out in the same year. This time the TMSF confiscated from Ciner Group ATV and the Sabah newspaper, two of the biggest mainstream outlets at the time, on the grounds that Ciner and its previous owner, the Bilgin group, had signed a secret protocol. The timing of this decision was very meaningful because it was less than 4 months before the 2007 general elections. Neither ATV or Sabah had a critical position but they were not under the full control of the government and their ratings and circulation were high. So, it was advantageous for the government to silence two important mainstream news outlets for 4 months before the elections. The AKP managed to gain the majority in the 2007 elections once again. After the elections, TMSF organized a public tender, and the only company to make an offer was Çalık Holdings the then chief executive officer of which was Beraat Albayrak, Erdoğan’s son-in-law (cf. Diken 2014b, February 13). For the third act of the confiscation method, in 2013, TMSF confiscated different companies belonging to the Çukurova group, including Digitürk, Show TV, SkyTürk 360, and Akşam. In the same year, Sky Türk, Akşam, Güneş and some other radio channels and magazines were also sold to Sancak Holding.\n\nThe AKP’s second strategy for changing the profile of media ownership is to apply tax mobbing and to force them to avoid the media market. The most obvious example was that of the Doğan media, which had controlled more than half of the domestic non-state media market since the mid-1990s. The problems between the Doğan group and the AKP started with the trial of Deniz Feneri launched in Germany. The allegations against the Islamist Deniz Feneri charity were that part of the money it collected was used for other purposes. The indictment cited some members of the AKP, including the then prime minister Erdoğan. When the Doğan media carried the trial on their first page, Erdoğan attacked the Doğan media and blamed media patrons for acting like prosecutors and the courts (cf. DW 2008, September 13). Then, suddenly, the ministry of finance decided to audit Doğan’s financial records for the previous three years (2005, 2006, and 2007) and fined them first $500 million and later $2.5 billion for tax irregularities found during the audit (cf. Arsu and Tavernise 2009, September 9). The first consequence of these fines was that the Gözcü newspaper, known to be critical of the AKP, had to shut down, and some critical voices in the mainstream papers Hürriyet and Radikal were dismissed. Soon afterwards, two important newspapers owned by the Doğan group were sold to Karacan and Demirören Holdings (Bloomberg HT 2011, April 20). Although the Doğan group started to decrease its share in the media sector and reduced the level of anti-government criticism, it faced a tacit threat through a continuing criminal case “on charges of ‘establishing an organization for the purpose of criminal activity’, forging official documents and violating Turkey’s anti-smuggling law” (IPI 2016, July 8). Finally, in 2018, the Doğan family decided to leave the media and to sell all its media outlets, including Hürriyet, Kanal D, and CNN Türk, to a conglomerate whose majority shareholder is Erdoğan Demirören, a businessman with close ties to Erdoğan (cf. Bucak 2018, May 29).\n\nIn brief, in the last 13 years, using these two strategies the AKP government almost completely changed the ownership profile of the mainstream media. Today, 90% of the mainstream media in Turkey is under the direct control of the AKP government, or more precisely, of President Erdoğan.\n\nCapture through financial sanctions\n\nThe AKP government has also used financial sanctions to discipline those media outlets that they cannot completely capture. The first of these methods targets the advertisement revenues of media companies. This kind of sanction does not often immediately attract attention, but it is very effective. Since most media outlets depend on the advertising revenue, advertising remains a control tactic for governments, especially in non-democratic regimes. The media outlets in Turkey have two sources of advertising revenues: from public announcements and advertisements and from private advertisements. The first group is distributed by the state-run Press Bulletin Authority (Basın İlan Kurumu; BİK), which is controlled by the government. BİK tends to use official adverts and announcements as carrots or sticks, depending on the position of the newspapers and their owners’ relations with the government. According to data compiled by Yanatma, in two years the value of official advertisements given to Akşam newspaper increased from TL 5.6 million (in 2013) to TL8 million (in 2015) after the TMSF took control of this newspaper and sold it to a businessman loyal to President Erdoğan. In the same period, due to the confrontation between the AKP and the Gülen movement, official adverts and announcements given to the Zaman newspaper (the flagship newspaper of the Gülen movement) decreased from TL 13.5 million to TL5 million (cf. Yanatma 2016, p. 56). A recent example of dropping all official adverts and announcements given to Evrensel and BirGün, two newspapers known as being leftist and critical of the government, illustrates how BİK can also act as a punitive institution (cf. Köylü 2020, February 5). Given the fact that official adverts constitute important items of revenue, especially for small national newspapers, we can argue that the government aims to silence even miniscule alternative voices using the BİK.\n\nThe second group, private advertisement revenues, are also not free from governmental pressure. In his very detailed report, Yanatma studies data showing advertising space (in square centimeters) and analyzes the distribution of advertising in six major public firms (the state-run banks Halkbank, Ziraat Bankası, and Vakıfbank; Turkish Airlines, Turkcell, and Turk Telekom). After a quantitative analysis of advertisement distribution, the author concludes “that the only criterion for public firms advertising distribution is their coverage of the government and circulation did not play any role in this allocation. While these apparently partisan and unfair practices were apparent before 2013 they subsequently turned into a more direct way to punish or support individual newspapers.” (Yanatma 2016, p. 36) During my field research, one of the interviewees who works as a manager at a private TV channel2 also referred to an “advertising embargo” by public firms. They argued that once the Minister of Treasury and Finance Berat Albayrak and some partisan columnist known to have close relations to Erdoğan directly criticized and targeted them, an embargo followed. They noted that the negative or critical speeches by high-level AKP members also spread the message to other firms. They added that private firms wanting to keep up good relations with the government stop adverting in these media and this kind of advertising embargo by public firms and companies has an indirect effect on the total of advertisement revenue acquired.\n\nThe other method of financial sanctions is more direct and is applied by the Radio and Television Supreme Council (RTÜK).3 RTÜK can impose broadcasting bans or heavy penalties to broadcasters for reasons only vaguely defined by law and this can easily become a powerful stick in government hands. Recent experiences show that the government, or more often Erdoğan himself, did not hesitate to use RTÜK as a stick against any critical voice. In response to a parliamentary question from the main opposition party CHP (Cumhuriyet Halk Partisi—Republican People’s Party), RTÜK revealed that it had imposed more than 16,000 sanctions on the media and TL250 million (nearly $45 million) in fines over 8 years from 2010 to 2018 (cf. Güneysu 2019, March 30). The reasons given for these fines include what was defined by the Turkey’s top media watchdog as “targeting, insulting, and threatening Turkish President Erdoğan, in addition to calling for a military coup against the constitution” (cf. IPA 2018, December 27) or critical reporting on the government’s efforts to combat the Covid-19 crisis (Hürriyet 2020, April 15). Whatever the content, as underlined by Erol Önderoğlu, the representative of RSF in Turkey, it is true that alternative media outlets that reject the official discourse are exposed to broadcasting bans and heavy fines (cf. Hacaloğlu 2020, April 17). Additionally, for the first time in the history of RTÜK, media ombudsperson Faruk Bildirici, selected from the CHP quota, was dropped from the council since he criticized almost all the decisions it made and made his criticisms public via social media (cf. Bianet 2019). This exemplifies that the council is reluctant to debate its fines and sanctions and is intolerant to opposition.\n\nCapture by intimidating and criminalizing journalists\n\nMedia patrons or institutions have not been the only target of the AKP. At the same time, it developed a three-step strategy of intimidating journalists trying to do their job. During their first term in office, before full control by ownership of the media had not yet been achieved, members of the AKP government or their representatives made direct contact with the chief editors of TV channels and newspapers. Daily newsroom meetings increasingly took into account their instructions. One of my interviewees4 who was working in one of the most important news channels at this period noted that the instructions on which news items to cover started very early. One example was the Pamukova train accident in 2004 where journalists were permitted to cover the tragedy only from limited perspectives and they could not ask questions about the responsibility of the ministry and high-level bureaucrats. The more the AKP reinforced its position within the state bureaucracy over consecutive election victories, the more direct and effective these instructions became. Journalists and correspondents who had good relations with the prime minister were appointed to the positions of chief editor and helped to establish a “red phone line” between the newsroom and the office of the prime minister (cf. Dağıstanlı 2014, p. 102). For example, Nermin Yurteri, who had been the correspondent following Erdoğan, was appointed as the news coordinator of NTV (cf. T24 2011, December 15) and Fatih Saraç5 became a member of the management board of the Ciner media group (cf. T24 2014, February 6). Another interviewee6 said that there were rumors about WhatsApp groups among new directors of different newspapers and TV channels set by representatives of the prime ministry or presidency. It is also claimed that government representatives can share a complete news article ready to be “copied and pasted in next day’s paper” on these WhatsApp groups (Özer 2018).\n\nThe second step for controlling newsrooms was to dismiss journalists who resisted instructions from their chiefs or coming directly from the government. It is difficult to reveal the real number of journalists fired from newsrooms for their critical points of views or refusal to apply instructions dictated by the government. A list of sacked journalists, editors and correspondents prepared by Turkey’s Journalists Union during the Gezi protests alone includes seventy-two names (cf. Muhalefet 2013, July 22). The visible part of this iceberg includes famous columnists, chief editors or anchor persons, such as Banu Güven, Hasan Cemal, Ayşenur Arslan, and Ruşen Çakır (cf. Arsan 2013), who resigned or were dismissed as they could no longer defend the essence and the ethics of journalism.\n\nAlthough the mainstream media have been captured by the government, step by step, “alternative” or “critical” newspapers or TV channels try to survive against legal and financial sanctions. The third step of intimidation by the government has targeted journalists working in these niche7 newsrooms. The AKP’s strategy has been based on the illiberal clauses of the Press Law, the Penal Code and the Anti-Terror Law, which can be very broadly applied according to the desire of the judiciary. The first large-scale judicial attack on journalists started with the Ergenekon case. This began as an investigation into a “deep state” military-led plot to overthrow the AKP government, but soon was transformed into a witch-hunt targeting adversarial voices in media and non-governmental organizations (cf. Steinvorth 2013, August 12). In this period, journalists came up against two categories of charges. Firstly, an important group of journalists who were following the Ergenekon trials were charged, based on the Articles 285 and 288 of the Penal Code, with “the violating of the secrecy of an ongoing trial”. A second group of journalists including famous names such as Mustafa Balbay, Tuncay Özkan, Soner Yalçın, Ahmet Şık, and Nedim Şener was accused of colluding with the so-called Ergenekon ultra-nationalist conspiracy and was jailed pending trial (cf. Yeşil 2016, pp. 99–100). As underlined by one of the interviewees8, this harsh judicial suppression orchestrated by AKP’s proxies in the judiciary constituted a breaking point and led to the criminalization of all journalists who do not toe the line. After this moment, journalists who speak truth to power realized in concrete terms that not only their job, but also their freedom was at risk.\n\nAfter the Ergenekon case, in 2011, 36 journalists working for pro-Kurdish media outlets, namely the Dicle news agency and the daily Özgür Gündem, were arrested and journalists were charged with membership of KCK (Koma Civaken Kurdistan—Kurdistan Democratic Communities Union) and the PKK, within the framework of police operations that continued for 6 months and targeted administrative staff from the Peace and Democracy Party (BDP), then some academics, and then a large group of lawyers (cf. Ergin 2011, December 28). Journalists were charged with the dissemination of terrorist propaganda and criminalized on the basis of the vague language of the Anti-Terror Law provisions.\n\nThe criminalization of journalists gained unprecedented momentum after the failed coup d’état in 2016. A series of judicial suppression targeted journalists with different backgrounds. The first targets were journalists working in media outlets financed by the Gülen movement. Ten days after the coup, arrest warrants were issued for 89 journalists suspected of links with the Gülen movement, some of whom were immediately taken in police custody. More tragically, they found it difficult to get lawyers to defend them (cf. RSF 2016, July 28). On July 28, 2016, all media outlets and print houses close to the Gülen movement were closed down and their movable property as well as all real estate belonging to them were transferred to the Treasury in terms of Decree No. 668. Almost two years afterwards a verdict was handed down and “six former columnists for Zaman were sentenced to heavy prison terms for ‘membership in a terrorist organization’” (RSF 2018, July 6).\n\nThe second target was the pro-Kurdish newspaper Özgür Gündem. The suppression of the newspaper’s editors and journalists was so high that human rights defenders, academics, and journalists initiated a campaign on May 3, 2016 (the day of the Freedom of the Press) to protect their colleagues. Each of the 56 supporters of the campaign became for one day the substitute editor-in-chief of Özgür Gündem until August 9. However, the judiciary decided to close down the newspaper temporarily on August 16, 2016 for “regularly making PKK terrorist organization propaganda and serving as a broadcasting organ for an armed terrorist organization” (Akgül 2016, August 16). Next day, some journalists and workers at the daily were detained during a police raid. In addition, the prosecutor charged 38 participants in the solidarity campaign with Özgür Gündem with “terror organization propaganda” under the Anti-Terror Act (TMK) Article 7/2 and “releasing or publishing terror organizations’ statements or declarations” under Article 6 (Akgül 2017a, March 7) and their trial started on September 20, 2016 (cf. Duran 2016, September 20). Two different trials related to Özgür Gündem lasted for more than 3 years. In brief, the process of jailing and trying defendants in the Özgür Gündem trials, as well as the penalties imposed on them, illustrates very well what journalists who do not accept the journalism framework imposed by the government can expect.\n\nThe third target was Cumhuriyet, one of the oldest newspapers from Turkey’s Republican era. On October 31, 2016 Turkish police detained board members, executives and some columnists following a series of raids (cf. Cumhuriyet 2016, October 31). Nine months after their detention the first hearing of the Cumhuriyet trials took place on July 24, 2017. The prosecution claimed that the daily had published news and articles legitimizing the July 2016 coup attempt and given their support to three terrorist organizations—“FETÖ, PKK/KCK and DHKP/C” (a small far-left group) (cf. Akgül 2017b, July 24). The indictment presented all the news and articles criticizing the authoritarian policies of the government as support for terrorism and the court sentenced 13 journalists to prison on terrorism charges on April 25, 2018 (cf. Gall 2018, April 25). As in previous cases against different journalists, the indictment, pretrial detention and trial proceedings of Cumhuriyet violated the basic human rights of the defendants. However, the symbolic nature of this trial was even more devastating, as the daily has always had an important place in Turkey’s journalistic history. In addition, one of my interviewees (see footnote 8) noted that the Cumhuriyet trials showed that, starting from the Ergenekon case, the AKP government was able to create a very insecure environment and intimidate an important proportion of journalists as well as human rights defenders by using judicial coercion. They explained that it was relatively easier to organize resistance when Ahmet Şık was first arrested during the Ergenekon case. However, they said that everybody was more reluctant to participate when they again tried to organize a campaign to support Ahmet Şık and other Cumhuriyet journalists on trial for the second time.\n\nApart from these major trials, there are several legal investigations against individual journalists. Since the failed coup d’état, the “famous” Article 3019 of the Turkish penal code has been put into use again against critical intellectuals including academics, lawyers, and journalists. News covering Turkey’s incursion into Afrin in January 2018 and military operations in Syria were regarded as insults to the Turkish state (cf. Cengiz 2019, October 28). Since 2017, the Media Monitoring Database has registered 36 judicial interferences based on the Article 301 (cf. Medya Gözlem Veritabanı 2020). Turkey’s renewed use of Article 301 as a weapon points out the increasing suppression on journalists.\n\nAdditionally, in their report published at the end of 2019, the Committee to Protect Journalists ranked Turkey the second-highest jailer of journalists in the world after China (cf. Beiser 2019). Pretrial detention can last for months and sometimes years and has been used as a method of punishment. In 2017, several cases were brought by journalists to the ECtHR and in March 2018, the Court took an important decision. For the application of Şahin Alpay and Mehmet Altan, the Court held that there had been a violation of Article 5 § 1 (right to liberty and security) and a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and ordered to release these journalists from prison. However, almost immediately another warrant was issued for their arrest on charges and they were sent back to jail (cf. IPI 2020). The last developments show that ECtHR rulings are no longer effectively applied by Turkish government. The fact that Turkey is still a member of the Council of Europe despite the systematic violations of the ECHR ruling creates serious doubts on the capacity of European democratic institutions to deal with new authoritarian regimes such as Turkey.\n\nOn the other hand, the huge numbers of prosecutions after the coup attempt in 2016, the use of pretrial detention and the criminalization of any critical views under the state of emergency have increased the number of detainees in prisons and created a very unhygienic and unsafe environment in jail, especially at the time of the global pandemic. Although the Turkish government passed a new prison release law on April 13, 2020, the law fails to include many “political” prisoners who are already convicted or in pretrial detention, including journalists, lawyers, and political and human rights activists. The insistence of the Turkish government on not releasing them brings to mind the question whether it is a conscious choice to leave all political opponents in jails and at a high-level of risk during the Covid-19 pandemic."
