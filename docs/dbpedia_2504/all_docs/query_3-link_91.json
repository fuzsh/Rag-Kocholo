        "text": "Nina Bergman is an actress, singer, songwriter and model. She was born in Denmark and is the granddaughter of Russia's greatest actor, Pavel Kadochnikov. Nina spent her early childhood traveling around Europe with her Russian Gypsy grandparents.\n\nAt 14, she received a scholarship to the musical theatre school Urdang Academy in London. A year later, she found herself in Moscow attending the world-famous Bolshoi Theatre. From there, she moved to New York City and was accepted at NYU Tisch School of the Arts. At that time, she got her first agent and began booking various jobs in plays, movies, commercials, and modeling. She also started singing in underground bands.\n\nBeing an adrenaline junkie, she found herself making extra money as an amateur boxer which later on helped her book movies like \"The Car,\" a remake by Universal Pictures, and the franchise \"DOOM\" movie also with Universal Pictures. Her other work includes the starring role of Marie in \"Hell Hath No Fury,\" a Jesse V Johnson movie, playing a French resistance fighter, and she played the lead role of \"GG,\" who was based on a 90s goth singer in the film \"Carpe Noctem,\" which was directed by Gene Blalock. In addition to film, she also played video game characters like \"Battery\" from \"Call Of Duty.\"\n\nShe has two movies coming out this year; \"Chief Of Station,\" starring Aaron Eckhard, and \"Cold Meat,\" starring Nina and Allen Leech, which screened at Fright Fest in London and will be in theaters later this year.\n\nHer performance in \"Assassin X\" earned her the Honorable Mention Award for Best Actress from the AOF International Film Festival for her role as the notorious Trinidad. She starred as \"Wonder Woman,\" directed by Jesse V Johnson, which stars Timothy V Murphy and Marina Sirtis. She also played a cold-hearted killer in \"The Wayshower,\" with Peter Stormare and Eric Roberts, and she starred in \"Know New Art,\" a Newport Beach Film Festival project by the Freise Brothers and Biscuit Filmworks.\n\nHer other work includes playing the lead opposite actors like John Malkovich, David Arquette, Vivica Fox, and Ron Perlman. She's been featured in numerous skits on The Late Late Show with James Corden and Craig Ferguson, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, and has hosted various shows like E! Entertainment, Fuse, and The Grammys as a Trophy Presenter. Her reality show credits include Battleground Earth with Tommy Lee and Ludacris and Hollywoodfruer, the Danish acclaimed TV show.\n\nA passion for the stage drew her back to her roots as she performed in various plays such as \"The Cherry Orchard\" with A Noise Within, and her favorite, the portrayal of Marlene Dietrich in \"Garbo's Cuban Lover\" with the Macha Theatre. Her theatrical agent introduced her to Paul Anka, who shortly after began managing her music career and helped her sign a six-album contract with Warner Bros. Record by their President Rob Cavallo. They called her new solo project \"N.I.N.A.\" which led to her last band, \"Letters From The Fire.\"\n\nNina worked on soundtracks for Lionsgate Films, singing the theme song for \"Catacombs,\" \"Repo the Genetic Opera,\" and \"Sharknado\". She sang the end title song in \"Black Limousine\" and was the voice on the soundtrack for \"All About Her.\" Additionally, she performed live for the World Series and the NCAA College Football Season.\n\nHer work in music videos includes a starring role in Gnarls Barkley's video \"Gone Daddy Gone,\" Sick Puppies video \"All the Same,\" and Trey Songz \"Foreigner\". She has been seen in over 50 commercials and hundreds of print campaigns, ranging from La Perla to Apple Computer, Sprite, Nike, and her well-known Nature Valley and Dos Equis with the Most Interesting Man in the World. Her most recent commercial campaign is the Carl's Jr. Beyond Meat and her notorious \"Balls Commercial\" for Saxx Underwear, where she was the spokesperson.\n\nAlong with her career, Nina is an avid animal rights activist with an active voice for the ethical treatment of our companions. The life-long vegan champion for animals continues to participate in numerous charities."
