        "text": "Deadpan comedian Charles Sidney Grodin was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania of Russian/Polish ancestry and raised in a Jewish orthodox home. He attended the University of Miami but dropped out, opting instead for the life of a struggling actor. The movie Ein Platz an der Sonne (1951) was said to have steered him towards his chosen profession. In his own words: \"It was two things. One is I think I developed an overwhelming crush on Elizabeth Taylor. And two, Montgomery Clift made acting look like 'Gee, well that looks pretty easy - just a guy talking.'\".\n\nAfter a spell with Uta Hagen (1956-59), he attended Lee Strasberg's Actors Studio before making his stage debut on Broadway in 1962. Though he appeared on screen from as early as 1954, Grodin did not make a great deal of headway in this medium until he attracted critical notice playing the small but crucial role of obstetrician Dr. C.C. Hill in Rosemaries Baby (1968). More substantial roles soon followed. His first major starring turn was in Pferdewechsel in der Hochzeitsnacht (1972), a black comedy written by Neil Simon and directed by Elaine May. Grodin managed to inject charm and humanity in what was essentially an egotistical central character. Film reviewer Roger Ebert praised his performance, describing the actor as a \"kind of Dustin Hoffman-as-overachiever\", an opinion which was echoed by Vincent Canby of the New York Times. Ironically, Grodin had earlier turned down the pivotal role in Die Reifeprüfung (1967) which propelled Hoffman to stardom (he also -- probably unwisely -- spurned the role of oceanographer Matt Hooper in Der weiße Hai (1975) which instead went to Richard Dreyfuss).\n\nGrodin's ultimate breakthrough came on the Broadway stage in \"Same Time Next Year\" (1975) (opposite Ellen Burstyn), a hugely successful romantic comedy about two people, each married to someone else, who conduct an extramarital affair for a single day over the course of 24 years in the same room of a northern Californian inn. Though the two leads left the show after seven months, Grodin was now much sought-after in Hollywood as a droll comic actor and cast in a string of hit comedies: Der Himmel soll warten (1978), Fast wie in alten Zeiten (1980), Ein Single Kommt Selten Allein (1984) and Midnight Run - 5 Tage bis Mitternacht (1988). He also appeared to sterling effect in the underrated farce Der Couch-Trip (1988), in which he co-starred with Walter Matthau and Dan Aykroyd as the brittle psychiatrist and radio host Dr. George Maitlin. Arguably his most popular box office success was opposite the titular Saint Bernard canine in the family-oriented comedy Ein Hund namens Beethoven (1992). Despite less than enthusiastic critical reviews, the film was a hit with audiences, grossed $147.2 million worldwide and spawned a sequel.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Grodin reinvented himself as a television host (Charles Grodin (1995)) and political commentator. He made frequent guest appearances on talk shows with Carson or Letterman, typically adopting the persona of a belligerent tongue-in-cheek character to facilitate \"comically uncomfortable situations on the set\". Grodin was also a prolific author, both of fiction and non-fiction. An autobiography was entitled \"It Would Be So Nice If You Weren't Here: My Journey Through Show Business\" (1989). Charles Grodin died at age 86 of bone marrow cancer on May 18, 2021 at his home in Wilton, Connecticut.\n\nRobert James Smith was born 21 April 1959 in Blackpool Lancashire, England to Alex and Rita Smith. He was the third of four children (Richard, 12 July 1946, Margaret, 27 February 1950, and Janet, 30 August 1960). Robert lived in Blackpool until he was three and then his family moved to Horley, Surrey, England where he later attended St. Francis Primary school and in March 1966 his family moved once again to Crawley Sussex, England, where he then attended St. Francis Junior School until 1970 where he spent two years at a middle school called Notre Dame which was an experimental school whose teaching methods were supposed to be revolutionary. From 1972 to 1977 he attended St. Wilfrids Comprehensive School where he also met Mary - the girl who would become his wife and also the inspiration behind so many of The Cure's songs.\n\nIn 1976 The Easy Cure was formed by Robert Smith, Michael Dempsey, Lol Tolhurst and Porl Thompson. It wasn't until 1978 that the band dropped Easy from the name - because Robert thought it sounded too Hippy/East Coast. Porl Thompson also left, as unfortunately the old name had been his idea. After rejecting the German record label, Hanza, The Cure met Chris Parry and decided to give Polydor a chance. It turned out that Parry was in the process of creating a record label of his own, and wanted The Cure to be the first on it's roster. So the new label, Fiction, was born and as well as signing up - The Cure even played a part in naming it.\n\nIn 1979 the single Killing and Arab was released and was soon followed by the band's debut album Three Imaginary Boys. While touring around the UK two more singles were released; Boys don't Cry and Jumping Someone Else's Train. By the end of the year Michael had left the band and was replaced my Bass Guitarist Simon Gallup, and keyboardist Matthieu Hartley. In 1980 the new four piece produced the dark, minimalist album titled Seventeen Seconds. This featured the band's first major cult classic single, A Forest. After touring Matthieu left the band and then there were three. 1981 saw the release of the somewhat funereal but enchanting album Faith. Though not a single, it's title track remains a mainstay of live performances and is highly regarded amongst fans to this day. It is also one of Robert's own personal favourites.\n\n1982 saw the production of The Cure's 4th studio album - Pornography. The tour which followed was cut short in Berlin, due to complete disintegration of the band. Robert and Simon had a punch-up in a bar. This resulted in Robert going home and not talking to Simon for a year. Robert and Lol continued to record material - which led to the creation of the single Lets Go To Bed. 1983 saw the release of Japanese Whispers\n\nbasically a compilation album of the singles produced by Robert &\n\nLol. In 1984 the band expanded to include base guitarist Phil Thornalley, drummer Andy Anderson and lead guitarist Porl Thompson. The Top was the first album resulting from this new line-up. Robert Smith would later describe The Top as being more like a solo album than a Cure album. This was followed by The Cure's first live album - Concert. This featured recordings from the band's 1984 UK tour. 1985 saw the departure of Phil and Andy, but the return of Simon Gallup. There was also a new addition - drummer Boris Williams. The 1985 album was titled The Head On The Door. This launched a massive tour, for the first time including the US. The band's commercial success exploded as a result. Following this, a compilation album of all the band's singles spanning the past decade was released in two formats. Simply titled Staring At The Sea (CD) & Standing On A Beach (vinyl LP). In 1986 The Cure released their concert film The Cure In Orange, directed by Tim Pope. This amazing performance was filmed live at the perfectly preserved Roman amphitheatre in Orange, Provence. Robert managed to cause much excitement by revealing his newly cropped hair on stage. In 1987 after months of recording in Miraval (France) & Nassau (Bahamas), The Cure unleashed the adventurous, flamboyant and beautiful double album Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me. This featured the newly acquired keyboardist Roger O'Donnell - poached from The Psychadelic Furs. The music video for the single Just Like Heaven features a very special appearance by Mary.\n\n1988 was a year for members of The Cure to take a break and get married. On 13th August that year, Robert married his childhood sweetheart Mary Poole in a private ceremony at Worth Abbey, Sussex. In the autumn of 1988 work started on the recording of demos for the next album. Sadly during this time Lol Tolhurst was dismissed from the band, due to the devastating extent of his alcoholism, which had caused his input to taper off completely. The recording sessions between autumn 1988 & early 1989 would result in the creation of The Cure's most iconic, timeless, successful and inspirational album to date. In May 1989, The Cure released Disintegration. During early 1990 after a relatively short time with the band, Roger left and a former roadie, Perry Bamonte, was welcomed in. Perry would double up as guitarist and keyboardist until Roger's return in 1995. In 1990 Mixed Up was released, which was a compilation album of various remixes.\n\nIn 1991 The Cure won their first Brit Award. That same year they took part in the Great British Music Weekend at London's Wembley Arena. The band released a documentary video titled Play Out, which basically chronicled their 1991 UK tour & performances. In 1992 The Cure released Wish. This was their most commercially successful album in the UK and came in at No.1 on the US Billboard chart. Following the release of the album, the band launched the massive Wish tour. During the US leg of the tour, the band made their second concert film - Show. It featured a mix of their performances from two nights at the Palace of Auburn Hills in Michigan, Detroit. This film and it's soundtrack [a 2-CD set also titled Show] were released in 1993. That same year another live album was released titled Paris. In 1994 the band produced music for the score of The Crow, in the form of the song Burn. They also released two different cover versions of the Jimmy Hendrix song Purple Haze. It was also that year Lol Tolhurst took the band to court, disputing ownership of the band's name. He was unsuccessful and the lengthy process was a drain on both sides - not just financially. Robert took no pleasure in defeating his old friend.\n\nIn 1995 The Cure found themselves looking for a new drummer, after the sudden departure of Boris Williams in 1994. The band placed an anonymous advert in the newspaper. It read \"Very famous band seeking new drummer - No metalheads.\" Jason Cooper answered the advert and successfully passed the audition. Roger O'Donnell returned as the band's main keyboardist. The band contributed music for the Judge Dredd soundtrack. The song was titled Dredd Song. The band spent several months during 1995 - 1996 recording songs for their new album. They chose to hire a residential studio in St Catherine's Court, Bath. Out of those recording sessions came Wild Mood Swings. Wild Mood Swings was exactly what it said on the tin, and was hugely successful in Europe and the US.\n\nIn 1997 the band released their second singles compilation - Galore. This featured all the band's singles from the last 10 years. A compilation of the band's music videos from the same period was also released - also titled Galore. The same year Robert contributed a song for the X-Files soundtrack titled More Than This. This song would later be included in the 4-disc set Join The Dots, released in 2004. Robert also made a guest appearance [as himself] on an episode of South Park - one of his favourite programs. Also in 1997 Robert was invited by David Bowie to perform onstage with him at his 50th Birthday Celebration in Madison Square Garden, New York. 1997 saw The Cure's first collaboration with guitarist Reeves Gabrels on the single Wrong Number. Robert Smith also recorded the track Yesterday's Gone with Gabrels for Gabrels album Ulysses.\n\n1999 was spent recording songs for the new album Bloodflowers. Once again the band were back at St Catherine's court, but this time there were also sessions at RAK Studios in London. Bloodflowers was released in 2000 and was followed by the extensive Dream tour. The album was very well received and won a Grammy Award. In late 2001, The Cure released their Greatest Hits album. This featured singles from 1979 to 2001. The box set included a DVD of the corresponding music videos and a cd featuring newly recorded acoustic versions of all the singles. The singles from 2001 being Cut Here & Just Say Yes. The original version of Just Say Yes featured Saffron, from the band Republica. She is also in the music video.\n\nIn 2002 The Cure were very busy. They played several concerts, kicking off with a particularly spectacular performance in London's Hyde Park, to a crowd of 20,000. This was followed by a concert in Belgium. Finally in November, The Cure played two nights at the Tempodrome in Berlin. These were the legendary Trilogy concerts. Both concerts were captured by HD cameras and the best of both were released as a 2 DVD set. The Trilogy shows were live performances of three albums in their entirety: Pornography, Disintegration & Bloodflowers. These three albums, Robert felt were some how bound together. Robert's inspiration to perform Trilogy came from seeing David Bowie perform his album Lodger.\n\nMcAvoy was born on 21 April 1979 in Glasgow, Scotland, to James, a bus driver, and Elizabeth (née Johnstone), a nurse. He was raised on a housing estate in Drumchapel, Glasgow by his maternal grandparents (James, a butcher, and Mary), after his parents divorced when James was 11. He went to St Thomas Aquinas Secondary in Jordanhill, Glasgow, where he did well enough and started 'a little school band with a couple of mates'.\n\nMcAvoy toyed with the idea of the Catholic priesthood as a child but, when he was 16, a visit to the school by actor David Hayman sparked an interest in acting. Hayman offered him a part in his film Die Hölle nebenan (1995) but despite enjoying the experience McAvoy didn't seriously consider acting as a career, although he did continue to act as a member of PACE Youth Theatre. He applied instead to the Royal Navy and had already been accepted when he was also offered a place at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (RSAMD).\n\nHe took the place at the RSAMD (now the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland) and, when he graduated in 2000, he moved to London. He had already made a couple of TV appearances by this time and continued to get a steady stream of TV and movie work until he came to attention of the British public in 2004 playing car thief Steve McBride in the successful UK TV series Shameless (2004) and then to the rest of the world in 2005 as Mr Tumnus, the faun, in Disney's adaptation of C. S. Lewis's Die Chroniken von Narnia - Der König von Narnia (2005). In Der letzte König von Schottland - In den Fängen der Macht (2006) McAvoy portrayed a Scottish doctor who becomes the personal physician to dictator Idi Amin, played by Forest Whitaker. McAvoy's career breakthrough came in Abbitte (2007), Joe Wright's 2007 adaption of Ian McEwan's novel.\n\nSince then, McAvoy has taken on theatre roles, starring in Shakespeare's 'Macbeth' (directed by Jamie Lloyd), which launched the first Trafalgar Transformed season in London's West End and earned him an Olivier award nomination for Best Actor. In January 2015, McAvoy returned to the Trafalgar Studios stage to play Jack Gurney, the delusional 14th Earl of Gurney who believes he is Jesus, in the first revival of Peter Barnes's satire 'The Ruling Class', a role for which he was subsequently awarded the London Evening Standard Theatre Award's Best Actor.\n\nOn screen, McAvoy has appeared as corrupt cop Bruce Robertson in Drecksau (2013), a part for which he received a Scottish BAFTA for Best Actor, a British Independent Film Award for Best Actor, a London Critics Circle Film Award for British Actor of the Year and an Empire Award for Best Actor. More recently, he reprised his role as Professor Charles Xavier in X-Men: Zukunft ist Vergangenheit (2014), X-Men: Apocalypse (2016) and X-Men: Dark Phoenix (2019). He began his depiction of Kevin Wendell Crumb, also known as The Horde, a man with an extreme case of dissociative identity disorder in M. Night Shyamalan's thriller Split (2016) and continued it in the sequel, Glass (2019). Also in 2019, he played Bill Denbrough in Es Kapitel 2 (2019), the horror sequel to Es (2017).\n\nMcAvoy and Jamie Lloyd look set to continue their collaboration in December 2019, with a production of 'Cyrano de Bergerac' at the Playhouse Theatre in the West End, London. The project has been on the cards as long ago as 2017, when McAvoy posted a picture of him reading the script and wearing a false nose.\n\nJack Nicholson, an American actor, producer, director and screenwriter, is a three-time Academy Award winner and twelve-time nominee. Nicholson is also notable for being one of two actors - the other being Michael Caine - who have received an Oscar nomination in every decade from the '60s through the '00s.\n\nNicholson was born on April 22, 1937, in Neptune, New Jersey. He was raised believing that his grandmother was his mother, and that his mother, June Frances Nicholson, a showgirl, was his older sister. He discovered the truth in 1975 from a Time magazine journalist who was researching a profile on him. His real father is believed to have been either Donald Furcillo, an Italian American showman, or Eddie King (Edgar Kirschfeld), born in Latvia and also in show business. Jack's mother's ancestry was Irish, and smaller amounts of English, German, Scottish, and Welsh.\n\nNicholson made his film debut in a B-movie titled The Cry Baby Killer (1958). His rise in Hollywood was far from meteoric, and for years, he sustained his career with guest spots in television series and a number of Roger Corman films, including Kleiner Laden voller Schrecken (1960).\n\nNicholson's first turn in the director's chair was for Drive, He Said (1971). Before that, he wrote the screenplay for The Trip (1967), and co-wrote Head (1968), a vehicle for The Monkees. His big break came with Easy Rider (1969) and his portrayal of liquor-soaked attorney George Hanson, which earned Nicholson his first Oscar nomination. Nicholson's film career took off in the 1970s with a definitive performance in Five Easy Pieces - Ein Mann sucht sich selbst (1970). Nicholson's other notable work during this period includes leading roles in Roman Polanski's noir masterpiece Chinatown (1974) and Einer flog über das Kuckucksnest (1975), for which he won his first Best Actor Oscar.\n\nThe 1980s kicked off with another career-defining role for Nicholson as Jack Torrance in Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's novel Shining (1980). A string of well-received films followed, including Zeit der Zärtlichkeit (1983), which earned Nicholson his second Oscar; Die Ehre der Prizzis (1985), and Die Hexen von Eastwick (1987). He portrayed another renowned villain, The Joker, in Tim Burton's Batman (1989). In the 1990s, he starred in such varied films as Eine Frage der Ehre (1992), for which he received another Oscar nomination, and a dual role in Mars Attacks! (1996).\n\nAlthough a glimpse at the darker side of Nicholson's acting range reappeared in Departed: Unter Feinden (2006), the actor's most recent roles highlight the physical and emotional complications one faces late in life. The most notable of these is the unapologetically misanthropic Melvin Udall in Besser geht's nicht (1997), for which he won his third Oscar. Shades of this persona are apparent in About Schmidt (2002), Was das Herz begehrt (2003), and Das Beste kommt zum Schluss (2007). In addition to his Academy Awards and Oscar nominations, Nicholson has seven Golden Globe Awards, and received a Kennedy Center Honor in 2001. He also became one of the youngest actors to receive the American Film Institute's Life Achievement award in 1994.\n\nNicholson has six children by five different women: Jennifer Nicholson (b. 1963) from his only marriage to Sandra Knight, which ended in 1966; Caleb Goddard (b. 1970) with Five Easy Pieces - Ein Mann sucht sich selbst (1970) co-star Susan Anspach, who was automatically adopted by Anspach's then-husband Mark Goddard; Honey Hollman (b. 1982) with Danish supermodel Winnie Hollman; Lorraine Nicholson (b. 1990) and Ray Nicholson (b. 1992) with minor actress Rebecca Broussard; and Tessa Gourin (b. 1994) with real estate agent Jennine Marie Gourin. Nicholson's longest relationship was the 17 nonmonogamous years he spent with Anjelica Huston; this ended when Broussard announced she was pregnant with his child."
