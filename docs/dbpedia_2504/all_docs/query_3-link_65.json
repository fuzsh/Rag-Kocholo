        "text": "https://lnkd.in/eBkqD6jP It breaks my heart to see the videos of the horrific conditions pigs are kept in. They are actually very intelligent and clean creatures, but forced to live in their own filth. They are kept in crates that dig into them, unable to move, driven mad and have no room so often squash their babies. They are neglected and many baby pigs die. They are repeatedly impregnated until they are used up and then sent to slaughter. The baby pigs have their teeth cut and tails cut! And without anaesthetic! The babies are slaughtered, throats slit, or head smashed on cement floor, or smashed over the head with a hammer. I watched a video of a tiny baby shaking uncontrollably with fear, forced to walk towards where his brothers and sisters were being killed. Pigs are smarter than dogs, they have the same level of intelligence as a 3 year old human child. They are affectionate and gentle creatures. My heart aches knowing the horrors farmed animals face every day 😢 Not only do we not have to eat animals, we can live healthier lives without eating them and it's better for the planet, due to the environmental damage animal agriculture causes. Most grew up eating meat. If you ever fancy something \"meaty\", a burger, bacon, chicken, beef, there's so many plant based alternatives now, it's never been easier to go vegan. The only thing governments, farmers, supermarkets do in response to this is pretend that this is not going on all over the country and is actually normal on farms. Pretend they're shocked, pretend this is not the high standards they expect from workers, pretend they will sort this out, pretend their industry is not the definition of cruelty. Desensitized workers suffer psychological issues and commit furthers acts of cruelty to the animals in their care, like kicking and throwing gates at them. But the truth is, much of the horror we saw in this video is what routinely happens to pigs on farms and is perfectly LEGAL. A lot of this is legal cruelty. And those poor pigs sufferings bleeding and prolapsed uteruses and baby pigs with infections from having their teeth cut out and tails cut off, that is all the result of what is done to them LEGALLY and is STANDARD practice on farms. To all those who eat pigs, THIS IS YOUR PORK, YOUR BACON. You are paying for this cruelty. We are far removed from our \"food\" and lie to ourselves that we are not responsible.\n\nHi there! I'm sure you're enjoying a good weekend! My name is Emmanuel Adekunle Salami and I have a story to tell, hoping you get inspired and be grateful on my behalf. I am a final year student in Animal Health Technology, also enrolled in the #3MTT programme. I have always had a passion for digital solutions and Animal Welfare, but it happened that I couldn't do the latter at the Apex level (Veterinary Medicine). Yet, I am doing it as a Veterinary Nurse and I'm sure that'll count for something. I began writing in 2014 (JSS3), but I wasn't so conscious of what I was doing neither did I have any help to climb better. I didn't stop, I continued, then late 2019 I got my heart broken and I diversified into Poetry (yunno this is how most poets are birthed right? 🤣 ), I healed and got better. Published an anthology on my 23rd birthday (titled: Love and Love Perceived). You just know. This time, I had already written my Research Write Up for my ND Certification (boring I must say), I didn't do a good job, I found it somewhat difficult to do. Since then and now; I have written close to 30 research writings (two are mine and the rest for others, who I provided guidance and assistance to). Mostly niching towards Animal Health. Then, something significant happened in 2020, I discovered the tech and wanted to finally start providing real life digital solutions to real life problems. I chose UI/UX, but I couldn't buy a course, it was too expensive (for me), I was just taking lessons from YouTube and struggling to practice with my SENSR520 Samsung computer that feels tired of me overusing it already. But in 2022, I became more hungry (I really wanted to birth ehLP and elite brands), there was no money. But I thought to myself that with what I have; I can still do something. I continued practicing on my own. School and other engagements kept stealing my attention. But then in the heart of 2023, my friend sent me a link to register for the #3MTT programme and I ignored, I was already tired (of anything Nigeria too), then my lover sent me the link few weeks after and i thought \"maybe God really wants me to do this\" so I registered and the rest has been history. I am grateful to the Federal Ministry of Communications, Innovation and Digital Economy under the leadership of Honorable Minister Bosun Tijani, who restored my faith in myself and this nation. I am a witness to the great things this administration can do. Please continue to go from strength to strength. I'll keep learning from #3MTT, #3MTTAlumni and from life generally and show up always as a better professional than I used to be. God bless Nigeria, God bless FMCIDE, God bless #3MTTNigeria #My3MTT #3MTTLearningCommunity - Attached is a video of my April Knowledge Showcase as an Intermediate Learner\n\nHi there!

As the founder, that will mark ten years since I opened a Microsoft Word document and typed the first words of the original business plan. Nine years since Iqbal joined me on the journey. So much has happened, and we have achieved much. The Ralph beats with the pulse of countless paws and the dedication of ~250 Ralphers #TeamRalph. As I reflect on this journey, three truths undoubtedly make me smile the most: 🐶😻 Compassionate patient care: I wanted The Ralph to be a place where I could leave my own beloved animal companions and know that they would be cared for not just in a clinically excellent way but with kindness, patience and compassion. They would receive the warmth of a loving touch away from their home and their family. Witnessing our team - their gentle strokes, soothing whispers, and genuine smiles - as they care for each patient fills my heart. These moments are a testament to the love that blankets our walls. 🤗 Unexpected kindness: Ralphers being pleasantly surprised by being treated with kindness. There are undoubtedly resource and other constraints around what we can do for our people. Yet people are often surprised by what we will do to help and care for them within these constraints. This surprise stems partly from experiences elsewhere where the response was quite different. This kindness is born from a culture that values each individual, recognising that everyone's path is unique and sometimes challenging. We are not perfect but we genuinely care and do what we can. 😁 The joy of growth: There's a special kind of satisfaction in watching someone flourish. At The Ralph, we've seen first-time managers blossom into inspiring leaders and trainees evolve into confident, skilled professionals. Each step they take in their growth, every hurdle they overcome, brings a sense of fulfilment that is hard to express in words. 💖 At the heart of The Ralph lies a story of more than just veterinary care – it's a story of love, growth, and the unwavering spirit of #TeamRalph. #VeterinaryExcellence #CompassionateCare #AnimalHealing #TeamRalphJourney #VeterinaryLeadership #IndependentVets #BeMoreRalph #TheRalphEffect\n\nHey Vet Clinic Leaders! Let's talk about a word that can make us all a little uneasy: Feedback. We know it's essential for growth, but man, it can be awkward. So how do we navigate this tricky terrain without causing a rift in the team? 🤔 The Fragile Nature of Trust First off, let's acknowledge that feedback is a trust exercise. In a high-stakes environment like a vet clinic, where every decision can impact a life, trust is everything. And guess what? Poorly handled feedback can shatter that trust in a heartbeat. 💔 🥪 The Balanced Approach Start with a compliment, slide in the constructive part, and end on a high note. This isn't sugar-coating; it's about making the medicine go down a little easier. 💭 Choose Your Words Wisely Ditch the \"you always\" or \"you never\" language. Stick to \"I\" statements and focus on the action, not the person. It's less accusatory and opens the door for a constructive conversation. 📍 Get to the Point Vagueness is your enemy. Be specific about what needs improvement and offer real examples. It eliminates guesswork and shows you're paying attention. ⏰ Timing Matters Timing is everything. Don't drop a feedback bomb in the middle of a crisis. Choose a moment when both parties can genuinely engage in the conversation. 👂 It's a Two-Way Street Feedback isn't a monologue; it's a dialogue. Be prepared to listen as much as you speak. You might just learn something valuable. Remember, feedback isn't about fault-finding; it's a tool for growth. As we gear up for Vet Tech Week, let's commit to making feedback a year-round practice, not just a one-off event. #vetmed #veterinarymedicine #vettech #animalhealth #veterinarians\n\nWow! Huge shout out to our community for supporting our online event today: exploring the Future of Veterinary & Social Services. Where do I start? We start with a massive shout out to Kaj Lofgren from Regen Melbourne for taking us on a whirlwind masterclass for Systems Thinking. We are inspired and motivated. For those who missed this presentation we have recorded it and will share next week. Susan Hazel for bringing your wisdom and perspective to this conversation. Jane Boag, our facilitator, for holding the space so incredibly as you always do! Sarah Waddle for your incredible heart and soul energy behind the scenes pulling together the comms and planning for this event. Mai Lan Nguyen : our able and steady One for keeping us on track with planning and preparation. To everyone on and off screen: our list of registrants blew my mind for the interest and momentum in this conversation. Thankyou to everyone for participating. I can’t tag you all but please like, comment or share.. or not! Thankyou to Megan Lui and Zoetis for your sponsorship and getting this work. Literally within an hour of our session closing I was immersed deeply in my afternoon of Social Hearted Vetting supporting an end of life conversation with a client in mental health crisis who’s 10 year old cavvy is on borrowed time. Connecting our client to the support she needs while we manage a plan for her sweet companion. Connecting deeply to our WHY. Why we do our work. Why this work matters so much. Why an interdisciplinary approach to supporting the Human Animal Bond is key. Why our systems change initiative is essential and Why our time is now. If you missed it, you can still Belong to this initiative. Sign up for updates via my substack: https://lnkd.in/gFCQGSKH For now it’s time to unwind into a Friday evening, to reflect on and celebrate the power of the human animal bond in a thriving society.. and the possibilities that are emerging through all of us who are part of this initiative. In gratitude, Lissi X"
