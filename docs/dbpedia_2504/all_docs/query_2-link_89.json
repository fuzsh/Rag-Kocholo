        "text": "Baby Boomers were born between 1946 and 1964. Because I was born on November 3, 1964, I’m one of the last boomers. This project collects my memories growing up as The Last Baby Boomer. Sometimes I’ll compare my memories to my experience raising two children born in 1994 and 1996, the tail-end of the millennial generation (people born between 1981 and 1996). Penning my memories might explain both myself and an entire generation.\n\nI grew up in Indiana where people interact with corn in myriad ways. Here are a few examples:\n\nEating Sweetcorn\n\nMy first memory of corn involved my dad bringing home bags of sweet corn from mid-July through mid-September. He would sit in the back yard and carefully shuck the corn, removing the outer layers of the husk, followed by the silky tassel hairs that stubbornly clung to the tender yellow and white kernels. I often helped my dad, but rarely cleaned the corn to his satisfaction; he always had to remove a few strands of the fine, bleached blonde tassel before a cob could be placed in my mother’s boiling pot.\n\nIn addition to bringing corn home to our family, my dad sold sweet corn at his Kiwanis club’s booth at the county 4-H Fair. This piping hot delicacy was coated with butter and salt and people formed long lines to purchase the “healthy treat.”\n\nGoing “Corning”\n\nWhile eating sweet corn was wonderful, throwing corn, or corning, was downright titillating! To go corning, I had to steal “feed” corn out of farmers’ fields in late September when it is dry and dead looking so that I could eventually throw corn kernels at people’s homes on or around Halloween. My corning days taught me that each corn stalk grows a single ear of corn. I never felt guilty taking the corn because the fields were massive. Once we got the corn home, I took it to my family’s garage and began the tedious process of removing the kernels. The dried husks and brown dirty tassels came off easily, but the hard dry kernels took hours to remove. Half a brown paper grocery bag full of kernels easily took five or six hours, leaving me with very sore thumbs.\n\nMy most memorable and final night of corning happened when I was around 12 years old, on an unseasonably warm evening at the end of October. I was corning with friends in the dark, pelting house doors and windows with handfuls of corn. After assaulting each house, we scattered to the winds, running as fast as we could. We always found each other breathless and emboldened to make the next attack even better! It was with this cocky attitude that we landed an all-out assault on a fastidiously groomed residence, showering the home multiple times with our precious ammunition. After the attack, we all started running, but I stopped after about a block, feeling smug about my delinquent behavior. This feeling evaporated when a massive hand landed on my shoulder and whipped my 75-pound body around to face a tall, muscular man with a crew cut. I was TERRIFIED.\n\nThe man was furious, and when he asked my name, I instantly replied, NINA LUX. I also willingly supplied my parents’ first and last names, and my address. When he asked who I was corning with, I sold out my accomplices without a moment’s hesitation, exclaiming in quick, staccato fashion: MARY MCDONALD, DENNIS DONAHUE, MEGAN DONAHUE, AND DARCY FORCE.\n\nWhen I asked the man if he was going to call our parents, he said that he might call Darcy’s parents because, in his words, that girl is trouble!\n\nI was near tears when my friends found me. I had already vowed to myself that I would NEVER go corning again. My friends said I should have made up names when the man asked for my accomplices, but I told them that I was too scared to lie. Darcy was not the least bit concerned about the man calling her parents. She was the second youngest of eight children, and figured her mother had bigger issues on her plate.\n\nDetasseling\n\nAlthough my corning days were over, my relationship with corn reached its zenith when I was 16 and landed a summer job detasseling corn. It was arduous work, but I earned a fortune: slightly over minimum wage, which at the time was $3.35 per hour!\n\nIf you have never heard of de-tasseling, here is a quick primer:\n\nDetasseling corn is removing the immature pollen-producing bodies, the tassel, from the tops of corn (maize) plants and placing them on the ground. It is a form of pollination control, employed to cross-breed, or hybridize, two varieties of corn.\n\n***\n\nWhether or not a field of seed corn is initially detasseled by machines, eventually people are employed to detassel the plants that the machines missed and to remove any tassels that the machines left in the leaves of other corn plants. This is done either by having “detasselers” walk through the corn field removing the tassels or by having detasselers ride through the corn field on a detasseler carrier. Detasseler carriers are typically employed when the corn is too tall to be detasseled from ground level. Each carrier can hold from eight to twelve detasselers. wikipedia.org/wiki/Detasseling\n\nDetasseling sounds easy enough, but it was BRUTAL. I worked for the DEKALB seed corn company. I had to get up at the crack of dawn, drive to a local high school to board a school bus and drive 30 minutes north to a town called Remington. While the corn was still short, we walked through fields and pulled tassels. The first morning I got soaking wet from the dew, and my shoes were a muddy mess. When I looked around, other people were wearing hefty trash bags and rubber boots. I learned my lesson but remained soaked for hours. As the corn grew drier, it would cut my face and hands. Again, I saw people wearing bandanas across their faces and I started bringing a bandana to work. One day we worked in a field where tiny bugs called aphids covered the corn. The little bugs got under my fingernails and in my nose, ears, eyes, and mouth. But the aphids were nothing compared to the heat and humidity that baked us for hours.\n\nAs the weeks passed, and corn grew above our heads, we started riding on the people mover machines that were tricked-out tractors with long arms on both sides carrying ledges for people to stand on while pulling out the tassels. If we missed a tassel, the crew chief driving the tractor would kill the engine and direct one of us to the offending tassel. Too often, the missed tassel was mine, and while I tried to find the tassel my crew chief would say, Nina, if it were a snake, it would bite you!\n\nEach day after de-tasseling, I headed straight to the shower, even though I knew I would have to shower again after summer conditioning for my high school cross country team. When I went to bed, I saw nothing but rows and rows of corn passing in front of my closed eyelids.\n\nEven though detasseling was hard, we managed to have fun. I made friends, including a host of cute boys. One day we were dropped off at a field early in the morning and left by ourselves while the crew chiefs fetched the people mover machines. While they were gone, a big jovial boy named Neil, who years later became the principal of my high school, grabbed a stalk of corn in front of everyone and hurled it back over his head, high into the air, simultaneously letting out a war cry. We all rushed to imitate Neil, and stalks of corn were sailing fast and furious for several minutes. We managed to pull it together before the crew chiefs arrived, but the brief mischief kept us motivated the rest of the day.\n\nConclusion\n\nI still enjoy watching the corn grow each summer as I ride my road bike on the country roads surrounding the west side of Indianapolis. And I still enjoy eating sweet corn, although I cook it on the grill it with lime, butter, and cilantro instead of boiling it in a pot. But when I get the corn ready, I think of my dad and remove every fine strand of the tassel before putting it on the grill.\n\nThanks for reading."
