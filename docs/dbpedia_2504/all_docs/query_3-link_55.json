        "text": "WE HAD A LOT OF FUN as the year came to a close! I went to the AKC National Championship show in Orlando for the first time since 2019, when Hamilton walked out of the ring and ended his career with a big Best of Breed and bragging rights as the No. 1 Coton all-systems <3. This year I went primarily to meet up with my Sunny co-owner and watch her show him in the National Owner-Handled Series Finals on the day before the actual championship show. I'm sure I have explained the NOHS program before, but it is a separate competition that takes place at most AKC dog shows throughout the year, in which non-professionals can compete against each other without the big-name pros involved. The Top Ten NOHS dogs in each breed receive an invitation to compete in the finals show, which leads all the way up to Best in Show, similar to any other show. I have qualified and participated in the NOHS finals twice before, once with Nina and once with Hamilton. I hadn't planned to be the one to take Sunny in this time, but my co-owner wasn't feeling well that morning and asked if I would do it. I did....and.......I won my very first NOHS Finals Best of Breed with Nina and Hammie's lovely son!! Extra fun because we won in a large entry (7 of the top 10 showed up), and also because in addition to being his co-owner, I'm also his breeder! We got to participate in group competition later in the afternoon, and although we didn't place, we had a great time! Didn't have time to take a formal win photo (Orlando week always ends up being a crazy whirl of activity and you never get to do everything you intend to do or see all the friends you intend to see) but I do have the two candid photos above. On the left, a quick iphone snap that Marilyn took of me holding Sunny and his BOB rosette, and on the right a professional shot taken by a photographer who was outside the ring near to us as we waited for our turn for examination.\n\nIn other news, Marilyn and I had also had our friend pro handler Lisa Bettis take Vanessa down to Orlando, as competition in California is hard to find (we did the same with Sunny in 2021 for the same reason). Lisa showed our little one beautifully, taking Reserve to the 5 point major Winners Bitch award two of the three days she was shown during the week and then Winners Bitch itself for a 5 point major at the final Saturday show. Orlando week was the first time Vanessa had been shown against any kind of class competition, and we were thrilled that she did so well her first time out and in the biggest entries of the year!\n\nAnd in non show-related end of year news, both Hamilton and Nina earned themselves Canine Good Citizen Advanced (CGCA) titles, matching up with daughter Sophie! Very happy that I was able to put seven companion titles on my little nuclear dog family in 2022. I love doing this work with my dogs, and anyone who knows me knows what a big believer I am in this kind of training for life skills. Most dogs (even the show dogs) spend the vast majority of their lives as people's pets, and the companion training gives them the social skills to go anywhere and do anything, which makes any dog's life much richer, and enhances the life of the dog's owner as well! Nothing nicer than a well-behaved canine!\n\nSOPHIE finished up her short run as a special at the end of the year; I literally couldn't stand to have this dog away from home, and I'm so incredibly happy to have her back with me. I had the opportunity to show her myself at two different clusters in February, and it was nice to remember how much fun it can be to show your own dog, something I hadn't really been able to do since I had finished her championship in 2020 just before the start of the pandemic. Sophie took Best of Opposite Sex to a major male special at the first cluster, and Best of Breed Owner-Handled both days that she showed. In the second cluster, in Madison, WI, at the end of the month, she took BOTH regular and owner-handled Best of Breed for a five-point major win one of the three days she showed there (five points is the most you can win at any single show, regardless of number of dogs entered), and we also went on to earn a Owner-Handled Group 4 from the very same judge who gave Sophie her championship two years ago and who hadn't seen either of us since then! I was able to put 10 additional Grand Champion points onto her record myself during just those two show clusters. Loved being able to spend the time with her again <3\n\nIn addition to having fun in the show ring together, Sophie and I have also been testing her obedience and socialization. She's a champ in that venue as well! In January we walked into visit an AKC Canine Good Citizen evaluator, and without a single practice session, Sophie was able to pass the test and receive her CGC title. You can read more about Canine Good Citizen on the \"Other Stuff\" tab, where I made a post about both Sophie and her younger full brother Gus recently earning this title. We then waited a couple weeks and went back to try to see if she could pass the next level called Canine Good Citizen Advanced/AKC Community Canine, which tests some additional skills that require a dog to be well-behaved and non-reactive in community-type settings, in situations with multiple strange dogs and people around. Needless to say, Sophie again aced the test on the first try and her CGC title was quickly replaced with a CGCA! I'm so happy to have bred such a multi-talented dog; Sophie is a bronze grand champion show dog, a National Specialty Show winner, No. 1 all-breed bitch for 2021 and No. 4 Coton de Tulear all-systems 2021, and also the holder of both a Novice Trick Dog and an advanced Canine Good Citizen title. She is the total package of beauty, temperament and brains....and the icing on the cake is that she's a lap-sitter, too! Enjoying spending my evenings with her cuddled up on the sofa. Grateful to Hamilton and Nina for this very special baby! <3\n\nI JUST DON'T have the words to express my pride in our little Sophie! On September 3, 2021, The United States of America Coton de Tulear Club (USACTC), was finally able to hold its 2020 National Specialty Show a year in arrears after being canceled by COVID last year. Sophie had only been out showing on a regular basis for a little over two months (after Artie retired from the ring after his Westminster win in mid-June), but she was selected by Judge Jan Paulk as the 2020 National Best in Specialty Show winner at this very special, long-awaited show.\n\nThis win was special to me for a number of reasons; firstly, just because it was our first Coton specialty show to be held post-COVID, secondly because I consider Judge Paulk to be a judge with a good knowledge of our breed, as well as someone who has consistently rewarded multiple dogs of mine over time under different handlers, including me! Thirdly, Sophie won this BISS award piloted by a wonderful handler, Stephanie Hentschel--but Stephanie wasn't someone my little Sophie knew well and had developed a relationship with--they had just met for the first time a couple days prior to the show! And finally, but perhaps best of all, this win marked the fourth USACTC National in a row won by a Morninglow dog. Top honors at each of the last three National shows have been taken by one or the other of Sophie's parents! In 2017, Sophie's mom, Nina (GCHS CH Whispering Lane's Just Right for Morninglow), took BISS honors at the National held at Purina Farms in St. Louis, MO. And in both of 2018 AND 2019, BISS honors went to Sophie's daddy, Hamilton (GCHS CH Morninglow's New York Man TKN), at the National shows held in Lexington, KY and Orlando, FL respectively. It is truly a breeder's dream come true to see your dogs AND their offspring recognized by multiple respected judges at both important shows and/or large entries, year after year, regardless of location or the handler involved. <3\n\nOur heartfelt thanks to Judge Paulk for continuing to recognize the \"Morninglow type\" in my dogs, and also to Stephanie, who obviously made Sophie completely comfortable right from the get-go, groomed her beautifully, and handled her as if they had been together for years!\n\nIT'S SOPHIE'S TURN!\n\nFOLLOWING Artie's win at Westminster, it was time for Sophie to spread her wings as our primary special! When the Westminster gang returned from New York, Artie came to our house halfway through the Grayslake, IL cluster, to spend a little time with us before returning to his primary home in Florida. Sophie won Best of Breed 5 of the 7 times she was shown at Grayslake, both with our friend, handler Lisa Bettis, and then with Laura King after Laura and her team came back to the area from Tarrytown. From there, Sophie has gone on to collect numerous Bests of Breed and multiple group placements over the last month, including a huge Group First at the Ann Arbor Kennel Club show on July 10th! We are proud of how quickly Sophie is proving to be a great show dog in addition to being the fabulous companion and smart cookie we already knew she was. Below are a couple of Sophie pics to enjoy from her big day in Michigan. Sophie has continued her winning ways throughout the month of July, racking up some significant breed points in large entries, and also growing her group ribbon collection :-) I'm thrilled with my little girl!\n\nWESTMINSTER 2021 REPORT\n\nWe are super proud of our Artie, GCHS Multi-GCH CH Morninglow's Arthurian Legend, who was awarded Best of Opposite Sex to Best of Breed at the 2021 Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. Artie showed beautifully, and we can't complain about the results, as his half-sister by the sire took the very top honor. All around a family affair!! Many congrats to GCH CH Sugar Bay's Dotted Swiss, Artie's half-sibling, who is also a niece of our Hamilton. Our thanks to Judge Molly Martin for the BOS award! Artie ended his fabulous AKC career with his Westminster performance on June 12th, and is currently up visiting with us for a bit before he returns to my co-owner's home. I expect him to sire a litter or two in the future, and have a great life as a beloved pet with his family, maybe even a lure coursing title at the end of his name :-). Below is a beautiful photo of Artie taken a few weeks prior to Westminster, and a picture of his Best of Opposite Sex ribbon awarded at the show. We will love this sweet little boy forever and hope he has lots of new and exciting adventures beyond the show ring!\n\nWE WERE SADDENED that the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show 2021 wasn't able to take place in Manhattan at Madison Square Garden in February, as has been tradition for over 140 years. Obviously impossible with the pandemic. The show has been modified for this year to take place in June, 2021, in Westchester County, NY, outdoors, on the grounds of the beautiful Lyndhurst Mansion on the Hudson River. Because the normal annual schedule of dog shows had been so terribly interrupted by the pandemic, WKC decided to expand the qualifying period for invitations this one time only. Normally, the qualifying period is from January 1 of any given year through October 31 of that same year for the show that takes place the following February. Because of COVID, the decision was made to expand both backwards and forwards, back to November 1, 2019 as well as forward through February 15, 2021. Invitations are presented to the Top 5 dogs in each breed, as well as to each breed's National Specialty Show winner, for a sometimes total of 6. Additional champion dogs can attend if there is space for them. The show is limited to an entry of 2500 dogs. Because of the expanded nature of the qualifying period, I received in the mail a total of THREE invitations to this year's dance! I have sometimes been fortunate enough to receive TWO invitations for the same dog in years past, as I twice before have had both a Top Five dog AND a National Specialty winner rolled into one for the same qualifying period. This year, at the end of the qualification period, our Artie was the No. 1 dog, and because of the push backwards to November 1, 2019, our Hamilton came in as No. 2 Coton, despite having retired at the end of 2019 after winning Best of Breed at the American Kennel Club National Championship show. I was beyond thrilled (that joy tempered, of course, by the nature of the event that caused this to happen) to be the co-owner and breeder of TWO of the Top Five dogs invited to participate in the show. This is in addition to being the co-owner and breeder of two of the Top Five Cotons for Calendar Year 2020 (Artie at No. 1 and Sophie at No. 5). The \"Top Five\" invitations for Hamilton and Artie are displayed in the photo above, on the left and right sides of the frame. The center invitation is an additional invitation for Hamilton (the third time I have had this happen) as he remains the current USACTC National Specialty Show winner. Having all three of these invitations is probably a once in a lifetime event (again, caused by the pandemic),but it did require the taking of a photo to commemorate these three beautiful honors all together.\n\nHammie is retired now, living the life of a spoiled housepet, siring some litters with appropriate young ladies, learning obedience skills, and as you can see if you click on the \"Other Stuff\" tab, earning his first performance title as a Trick Dog Novice, along with three other members of my canine household. I don't think I'm crazy enough to pull him out of his retirement and put two of my own dogs in to compete against each other at a show like this, so this will be Artie's year to attend and try to bring home a ribbon for Morninglow. His half-brother Hamilton wishes him the very best of luck and will be rooting for him from the sofa at home (assuming he pays any attention at all to the screen LOL). I will definitely be watching and rooting for my boy!! As I always say, the true honor is in the invitations, which represent consistent winning at a high level for a long period of time. Both boys have proven themselves to be great show dogs, quality stud dogs, and sweet and affectionate house companions. I love them both dearly!\n\nOUR ARTIE (Multi-CH Morninglow's Arthurian Legend), one of our 2018 \"Camelot Litter\" babies, has also been doing some amazing things, although most of 2019 he was overshadowed here by the accomplishments of big half-brother Hamilton. If you have perused this site in the past, you know that Artie was one of three puppies born to our Ruby and BIS GCHB CH Mi-Toi's Icon. I kept two of the three puppies born in March of 2018 and showed them both myself completely owner-handled to their AKC Championships, finishing both brother and sister on the same day down in Orlando in the biggest coton entries of the 2018 year. Huge thrill that I will never forget! If you scroll down this \"News\" page a bit, you will find an entry about that special day and some additional photos of Artie and his sister, Ava. However, when you are a small, home-based breeder/fancier, there are limits on the numbers of dogs and especially the numbers of male dogs you can keep in a single household and also still retain your sanity, so I always knew Artie wouldn't be able to stay with me forever. However, I loved raising him and showing him, and wanted to give him the best home I could possibly find him, which I did in June 2019, with a fellow Coton fancier, and she has continued his career in the ring. Last fall she sent him to Puerto Rico, where in the course of a weekend, he obtained FOUR FCI titles (FCI is the governing body and canine registry for most of the world other than the US, Canada and the UK), took four group placements (three Group Ones and a Group Two) and also went on one of the days to take a \"Third Best in Show\", which if it existed in AKC, would be the equivalent of a second Reserve Best in Show, just behind the RBIS winner. Artie looked magnificent, and he is the first dog I have bred to earn titles in FCI. So proud! <3\n\nAfter we brought Hammie home from Orlando last winter at the conclusion of his great run, we decided that Artie could have a turn with our handler who has shown both Nina and Hamilton to such amazing success the last few years. Artie started out with a bang, becoming the Number One all-breed Coton de Tulear as of the end of January, 2020, following in both Nina's and Hamilton's footsteps. Some business at home and the pandemic had frozen him just below that coveted No. 1 spot as of end of March, but as shows are starting up once more, he has been winning and placing once again. Couldn't be happier either as a breeder or as his first human mom :-) I got to watch him from a distance at a show last weekend (he remembers me quite well so I can't get too close prior to show time or I will badly distract him, lol) and he has turned into quite the beautiful little man. He remains a part of our program here, and we continue to look forward to good things from our adorable little boy! The photo above was taken of Artie in the group ring the first weekend of August 2020, in Canfield, OH. Some nice pro photos of Artie's excellent Puerto Rican adventure last fall are just below:\n\nI'm super proud to say that my Hammie, who took over as our top show dog after Nina retired at the end of December, has had an amazing year so far in limited showing. Hamilton is both the NUMBER ONE COTON in all-breed statistics as of 3/31/19, as well as the No. 1 Group Winning Coton de Tulear to date (late April 2019)! If you have read along with this page from time to time, Hammie is our keeper from Ruby's second litter in 2016, and distinguished himself last year at the United States of America Coton de Tulear Club National Specialty Show by winning Best of Breed in one of the bigger entries of the year, in Lexington, KY. You can read more about our Morninglow \"sweep\" of the top honors at that show, if you scroll further down this page. Our Nina, who won Best of Breed at the 2017 National Specialty, took Best of Opposite Sex to Hammie in 2018. Couldn't have been prouder. Hamilton turned three years old in mid-March, and continues to impress me with his exuberance, his sweet and loving nature, and his continuing maturation into a lovely show dog, in addition to being a fabulous sofa partner for us at home. Hamilton has won several Group Ones (top prize in the Non-Sporting Group) and has had a couple of trips around the Best in Show ring so far this year. Some of Hammie's recent ads and win photos are above and below. Hamilton is approaching Bronze Level Grand Champion status and I'm very proud to say I have loved this dog from the moment he entered this world in my bedroom.\n\nHAVING FUN WITH NINA and HAMILTON\n\nIN THE NATIONAL OWNER-HANDLED SERIES!\n\nHAMMIE AND NINA had been staying with their pro handlers while we were on a family vacation, and I decided to bring them home for a little vacation of their own at the end of July. We decided to run up to Wisconsin (not even an hour from home) for the Waukesha and Burlington Kennel Clubs shows over the last weekend in July, and I decided I wanted to play with both dogs again in the NOHS, or National Owner-Handled Series, which is a separate competition that excludes professional handlers, that I'm certain I've talked about below. On the first day we played, I handled Nina and won BOB and BOBOH, and won a Group 3 Owner-Handled and then gave her to a pro friend for regular groups, where she took a regular Group 4 in a huge group! We skipped the next day to stay home and just hang out, and went back for Days 3 and 4 of the cluster. For those last two days, I handled my Hammie, and on each day, I won BOBOH with him. On the first day, we also won the Owner-Handled Non-Sporting Group (Group 1 OH) and on the second day we placed again with a Group 3 OH! Hammie is now ranked in the Owner-Handled stats for the year, but the cycle ends in early October, and I don't know that we will get another chance to play, especially with puppies at home. None the less, it was fun, and I think the dogs had a good time spending time with me. I know I enjoyed spending time with them!\n\nNINA, NINA, NINA--SHE JUST KEEPS ON WINNING!\n\nNina came out of the gate with a bang as we started 2018; we can scarcely believe what a magnificent show dog she has become! As of January 31, 2018 she was the Number One Coton de Tulear All-Systems, took Select Bitch at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in New York City in February, and as of today (4.27.18) is still the Number One Group Winning and All-Breed Coton for 2018!! It has been a wild ride and a great deal of fun. Nina seems to love to show, she lights up whenever she enters a ring. At the end of March, Nina took both a Group 1 (winning the Non-Sporting Group) and then went on to take her very first Reserve Best in Show under Canadian judge Michael Gelinas!! Nina is the only coton to win a Group 1 to date this year and thus also the only coton to take a Reserve Best in Show. Please enjoy a few of the win photos we have from these last few months, and a few of the ads we have run in the trade magazines to celebrate her success!\n\nLET'S NOT FORGET HAMILTON!\n\nHE HAS ALSO BEEN DOING SOME GOOD STUFF!\n\nWith all the attention on the amazing things that Nina has done in the show ring, it's been easy to forget that our own Hamilton, Morninglow's New York Man, has been doing some major winning of his own. In the time that I have been writing about Nina's spectacular 2017, our Hamilton finished his AKC Championship in September, 2017, in Kenosha, WI, handled by his human daddy. The following weekend he went into the ring, his first time showing as a champion, and he took Select Dog and a three-point major Grand Championship win with me as his pilot. Hammie went on to take Best of Opposite Sex to Nina's Best of Breed twice during the three-day Orlando show cluster in December, in the largest coton entry of the year. And then he finished his Grand Championship at my \"home\" cluster in Grayslake, IL on January, 26, 2018 under Judge Debbie Campbell-Freeman. In March, Hamilton took his first group placement in Kansas City, MO under Judge Eugene Blake. I couldn't be more proud of this boy, who was born in my bedroom, and he has been a good sport, waiting in the wings behind Nina for his turn to fly high. Despite all of Nina's wins, Hammie is currently ranked (as of 3/31/18) as the Number Five Coton in the all-breed standings, and the Number Two male. You can now call him GCH CH Morninglow's New York Man! And we adore him!!\n\nNINA ENDS 2017 AS THE NUMBER ONE GROUP WINNING COTON DE TULEAR IN AKC!\n\nMiss Nina has continued to astound us with her great success in the show ring this year! In addition to the National Specialty Win in St. Louis in September, she has continued to consistently win Best of Breed against some formidable competition, and to place in AKC Non-Sporting Group Competition. As of 12/31/17, she has been recognized with over 30 group placements, and more Group Wins (Group 1, or First Place in group) than any other coton this year! We are extremely proud of this little girl who loves to show herself off in the ring, and extremely grateful to the judges who have recognized her stellar qualities. We are also extremely grateful to her handlers, Laura King and Robin Novack, for piloting her so close to the top. Nina just recently received not one but TWO invitations to the 2018 Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show next February in New York City (one for her National Specialty win and another for finishing the Westminster year as one of the Top Five Cotons de Tulear in the country), and has also qualified to participate in Crufts, which bills itself as the world's largest dog show, in Birmingham, England, for both 2018 and 2019 (takes place in March each year). We are overwhelmed with all the honors!\n\nSO MUCH NEWS ABOUT NINA!\n\nThe summer flew right by us and I hardly got to write about the amazing summer than Nina has had! I barely know where to begin!! Nina is now the 2017 United States of America Coton de Tulear Club National Specialty Show winner, which just happened a few weeks ago in Gray Summit, MO at Purina Farms (9.16.17). A thrill of a lifetime yet again! Our Besito also won the USACTC National Specialty back in 2013, where Cotons were still in the Miscellaneous Class. Besito's win was probably MY personal greatest thrill as an exhibitor given that I handled him to that victory myself, but given that Cotons are now in the big leagues in AKC, this win by Nina is a pretty close second!! In addition to winning the 2017 National, Nina has been tearing up the show ring all summer long; as of this writing (late Sept 2017), she is the only multiple-group winning Coton de Tulear in 2017, and has had a total of over 20 group placements since she started working with handler Laura King at the end of May. When Nina and Laura first started out together, Nina was the number 10 Coton de Tulear in the 2017 AKC all-breed statistics (where group wins for the year are tracked); by the end of August she had soared to the Number 2 spot! And this was with showing just a few short months; we did not begin showing in earnest until the summer began. Nina is a beautiful, easy-going, happy little dog and we couldn't be more thankful to everyone who has made up her team; to Laura, her partner Robin Novack, who has also handled Nina to a number of group placements this summer, to their assistants, Alex Romero and Anne Phillips, and of course to Nina's breeder, Melinda Amsden. Melinda and her husband Mark have been so incredibly supportive on this venture. It's so nice to have someone to call and send a photo to each time Nina gets a win! We are enjoying the ride and are so proud of our lovely little princess! Photos below of some of the highlights of the summer.....\n\nNINA MAKES HER DEBUT AS A SPECIAL--AND MAKES A BIG SPLASH!!\n\nNow that Besito is enjoying a life of sofa-surfing leisure, it was time to see what Nina can do in the show ring--and WOW--it has been amazing! We started to put her out as our \"special\" in May, and since the 20th of that month, when she earned her first group placement of the year in Kokomo, IN, she has been on a tear and has earned 9 more placements in her last 13 shows, including a Group 1 placement this past Friday (June 16, 2017) at the prestigious Little Fort Kennel Club of Chicago show in Grayslake, IL! The twice-annual Grayslake show clusters are favorites of mine, as they are close to my home, and year in and year out, bring big turnouts of many of the top dogs in the country. To earn a group placement at one of these shows is an honor and a really big one! The Group 1 placement put Nina into the regular Best in Show ring for the very first time, and although she didn't win, I thought her performance was spectacular. Just getting into that ring meant that Nina was one of seven finalists, winnowed down from the original almost 1500 dogs entered into the show! We are just over the moon about Nina, who in addition to turning out to be a great show dog, is a wonderful, easy-going family pet. We can't wait to see what else she is able to accomplish this year!\n\nBESITO EARNS HIS NEXT TITLE\n\nCANINE GOOD CITIZEN!\n\nMy Besito is an amazing dog; a fabulous show dog who knew exactly what to do the very first time he entered a ring, as well as being an extraordinary housepet! Always happy, always wanting to please.....he was the only dog I had never taken to a class other than to show training, because he seemed instinctively to know how to behave in almost every situation. While I would like to start doing obedience work with him (I don't think it will be a big stretch for him, but it's fun nonetheless), I decided to take a chance and go to an AKC Canine Good Citizen Test and see if he could pass it. Canine Good Citizen (CGC) is a title that any dog with an AKC registration number can earn, whether intact or neutered, and I believe even mixed-breed dogs with AKC Canine Partners numbers (a program that lets mixed breed dogs participate in AKC performance activities) can play; its a ten-part test of how well your dog is socialized to the everyday activities and distractions of life. For many dogs, earning this title can be a challenge, and thus the need for training classes to try to teach these skills. Some of the testing requirements are obedience-based, such as sitting on command and holding a stay while the handler moves 20 feet away from the dog, and coming when called. A dog must also allow a friendly stranger to groom him and handle him around the face and ears without reacting, and be able to walk through a group of unknown people without lunging towards them or reacting in any way. You can read about the test and its 10 different components by clicking here. I figured Besito's storied show career had taught him a lot of these things; he has spent time maneuvering through crowds at show sites, and certainly knows how to be still for grooming. Well, he certainly had learned these things and more; we walked in, asked the evaluator to test him and he passed with flying colors--stone cold!! I was so proud of him! He is such an even-tempered, sweet, happy, loving dog. So now we have another title at the end of his name. His official moniker is now \"MBISS GCHS CH Dior's Besame Mucho Morninglow CM2 CGC\"! His name keeps getting longer, but he will always be our well-loved \"Babycito\" in our home!\n\nBESITO ENDS 2016 AS\n\nTHE NUMBER ONE MALE COTON DE TULEAR\n\nWe are very pleased and proud to announce that our Besito finished the year 2016 as the Number One Male Coton de Tulear in AKC Breed Standings. A very nice way to wind down a multi-year show career, we couldn't be more pleased with all that he has accomplished during his time in the show ring. We took out a final ad to celebrate all his achievements, that you can see below. Congratulations to MBISS GCHS CH Dior's Besame Mucho Morninglow CM2 on a fantastic run! Besito appeared in his final show at the prestigious Westminter Kennel Club in New York City on February 13, 2017, and did not disappoint, taking the Grand Champion Select Dog award for the second year in a row. We traveled to New York to watch him in the ring with his handler, Ryan Wolfe, and we couldn't have been happier with their performance! Going forward, Besito is going to get to try out some new activities, including obedience training and Canine Good Citizen, and have more time to play with his best friend, Ruby, and his son, Murphy, and all of our other dogs! He also recently sired his second litter, up in Canada, and now has four more adorable little boys ( in addition to the three boys in his 2015 \"Irish Litter\") to claim as his own. Besito has always seemed to really light up when he enters a show ring, so although he is officially \"retired\" and no longer chasing a spot in the national standings, it is still entirely possible that he might turn up at a show or two occasionally just for the fun of it. We love this dog so much, and we can't wait to see what additional fun he will bring into our lives!\n\nTHE AKC NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP SPONSOR CHANGES FROM EUKANUBA TO ROYAL CANIN FOR 2016\n\nMORNINGLOW STILL HAS FANTASTIC RESULTS!\n\nMorninglow dogs traveled down to Orlando for the fourth time for the AKC National Championship in December (formerly known as the \"Eukanuba\" and this year for the first time, the \"Royal Canin AKC National Championship.\" Ever since we first started attending this show with Besito as a little puppy, it has been good to him. In 2013, he took Best of Breed and won the USACTC National Specialty show held during that week, and also took a Group 2 placement in the Open Show of which the specialty was a part, all handled by me. In 2014 and 2015, he was recognized by the judges each year with an Award of Excellence. Last year, Murphy also came along, and handled by me, was awarded Winner's Dog for his very first major, in only his third time entering a show ring! This year, we decided to take Nina along to see what she could do. The National Championship is a huge show, with close to 5,000 dogs entered in conformation, agility, dock diving and other activities. In 2016, Besito beat out all the other male Cotons de Tulear entered to receive a Best of Opposite Sex award from respected Judge Edd Embry Bivin, and Nina received a Judge's First Award of Excellence, also from Judge Bivin, on her very first time participating at a show of this scale!\n\nA BUSY, BUSY SUMMER!\n\nWe have been showing a lot this summer (a lot for us, anyway)! We started Nina out in her first show in early June, and in August, we were proud to announce that Nina has become an AKC Champion, our precious Ruby has become an AKC GRAND CHAMPION, and our Besito has become and AKC SILVER GRAND CHAMPION!! I handled Nina completely by myself to her championship, and the super-fun part was that the finishing points for each of these awards to these three dogs were put on the dogs by the two of us, and all happened in the same show weekend, at the Elgin Kennel Club Show in St. Charles, IL (August 27 and 28, 2016). Besito is only the second dog in the history of the breed in AKC to achieve Silver GCH status! It shows his ability to win over time consistently, with a large number of different judges. We are thrilled with all three of these much-beloved dogs. Here are my iPhone snaps of our achievements! Both Nina and Besito have gone on in the month of September to additional major wins!\n\nNINA ALSO TRIES OUT OWNER-HANDLED GROUPS\n\nAND TAKES GROUP 1!\n\nWe drove up to Marshfield, WI (quite a hike) in August, and it was well worth it! Our little Nina took regular Best of Breed under well-respected Judge Edd Bivin, along with a Best of Breed Owner-Handled, and went on to take an Owner-Handled Group 1 (first place in the Owner-Handled Non-Sporting Group) her very first time in a group ring! Nina had already won a couple of Owner-Handled breed ribbons, but we had always had a human family commitment on each of those show days and weren't able to stay for group competition. This time we had the opportunity, and it paid off! Nina is a very happy little girl, and a joy to show. It was a super long day for a puppy, but she was a real trooper through both regular and owner-handled groups, and the Owner-Handled Best in Show Ring. She didn't win the show, but I thought that she did fantastic for a first-time puppy, and I couldn't have asked for more! What a good girl!!\n\nMURPHY TRIES OUT THE NATIONAL OWNER-HANDLER SERIES AND TAKES A GROUP 1\n\nAfter Murphy's big win at Eukanuba in December, we decided it was time to let him fly. At the Coool Cluster in January 2016, in Grayslake, IL, he showed us some more of the great stuff I saw in him since the time he was our tiny puppy. Because I am a member of one of the hosting all-breed clubs in this cluster, we were only able to participate in three of the five days of shows, but Murphy did us proud. He took a Best of Winners on Day 1, a Best of Breed over multiple specials (dogs who are already champions) on Day 3, and on Day 5, he and I participated in a newer AKC program called the National Owner-Handler Series (NOHS). NOHS is offered alongside regular shows and allows people who are handling their own dogs at the show a separate chance to win breed, group placements and Best In Show without having to compete in the ring with professional handlers. It's a popular program, and The International Kennel Club of Chicago decided to offer it on the last day of the cluster, so we decided to play. Such fun! Murphy won (a Group 1 Placement) the entire Non-Sporting Group that day, and it was a BIG group! Got his first chance to play in a Best in Show ring at only nine months of age! Murphy didn't win the show, but I was super proud of his performance! Can't wait to see what else he can do as he grows!\n\nBesito and Murphy both went to the AKC/Eukanuba Week this year, our first time taking two dogs, and both of them had a great run! Besito came home with a Best of Opposite Sex, two Grand Champion Selects, all for five-point Grand Champion majors and an Award of Merit. Besito was also honored with Grand Champion Select Dog in the USACTC's first specialty show since entering the AKC Non-Sporting Group in July, 2014, which has held on Thursday of Euk week. Our baby Murphy took Reserve Winners's Dog at the Specialty, and WINNER's DOG at the Eukanuba show itself, for his very first major win!! I handled Murphy myself in a group of professional handlers in the winners class, and was just over the moon when Judge Dr. Anthony DiNardo chose Murphy for the honor! Murphy's official win pic from that day is in his section of this website, found by clicking the \"our males\" tab above. All in all, a great week, fun with dogs, warm weather and meeting up with friends. We brought home some great ribbons and prizes, which are currently decorating my family room and some of which are shown below!\n\nMurphy and I flew out east at the end of September to participate in the historic Morris & Essex Kennel Club Dog Show. M&E, as it is commonly referred to, is a special event in the dog show world, designed to bring back the glamour of the \"Golden Age of Dog Shows.\" The show had been held yearly from 1927 until 1957 and was organized by Mrs. Geraldine Rockefeller Dodge, who was known for always putting on a grand and elegant show. M&E was resurrected about 15 years ago, and is now held once every five years in New Jersey. It is an enormous outdoor affair, with grand tents and box lunches for exhibitors. Many exhibitors also dress in period costume, and just about EVERYONE wears a hat! If you would like to read more about the historic Morris & Essex show, you can click here. This year's show had the largest number of entries of any AKC dog show ever held in the U.S., with the exception of a prior M&E show held while Mrs. Dodge was still in charge of the affair. Murphy did great at his first outdoor show, gliding through the grass like a pro, and got a blue ribbon for winning the puppy class. He was also a fantastic airline traveler; I was super proud of him all-around!\n\nPIPPIN EARNS OUR FIRST MORNINGLOW PERFORMANCE TITLE!\n\nIf you think that Cotons de Tulear are simply fancy little fragile white show dogs, think again! They can also be magnificent athletes. There have been a number of well-known coton agility dogs over the years, but I think we may have earned the very first title for a Coton de Tulear in the AKC sport of lure-coursing! If you scroll down to the bottom of this \"News\" page, you will find a video clip from the first time that we took Ruby and Pippin running, just for fun. We could tell immediately that he had found his calling! As soon as we were able to find some local AKC trials, we entered him. He took home two ribbons last fall, and on this past May 9th, he finished his title at the Cudahy, WI Kennel Club Coursing Ability Trial! We are thrilled, he was thrilled (you have never seen a dog SO happy to be able to chase a plastic bag over a 300-yard course) and he has a brand new title ribbon. Additionally, you can now call him \"UKC CH Fluffy Acres Morning Glow, CA\" (Coursing Ability)!! When Ruby is recovered from new motherhood, I hope to take her to earn a title as well; she loves to run as much as he does!! Below is a photo of the triumphant little man at the end of his run, and a photo of his new title ribbon. We are anxiously awaiting the uploading of his title to the AKC website and the receipt of his title certificate!!\n\nWe are very happy to announce that our Besito was recognized by the breed judges both at the 2014 Eukanuba National Championship, held last December (2014) in Orlando, Florida, AND at the 2015 Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, held just a few weeks ago (February) in New York City! At each show, he received an \"Award of Merit\" (sometimes called an \"Award of Excellence\"), which the judge has the discretion to bestow upon what he or she thinks is an outstanding breed entry. There were 22 cotons entered at the Eukanuba show, and only four male dogs recognized. The Westminster Kennel Club Show is the \"Super Bowl\" of the dog show world in the U.S., and 2015 was the very first year that Cotons de Tulear were eligible to participate. Only three male dogs were recognized and Besito was the youngest of those three! Besito was also \"invited\" to attend both the Westminster AND the Eukanuba shows, an honor which is only bestowed on the top five dogs or bitches in each breed each year For purposes of calculating breed rankings for these shows, Besito finished as tied for the No. 2 spot in the country. In addition, he was also the youngest of all of the invitees. We are beyond thrilled by what this precious boy has accomplished before the age of 2 years! Couldn't be happier!! Now taking a well-deserved break, and relaxing!!\n\nBESITO BECOMES AN AMERICAN KENNEL CLUB CHAMPION!\n\nMorninglow Cotons is thrilled to announce that Dior's Besame Mucho Morninglow, CM2 (\"Besito\") is now an American Kennel Club Champion! Cotons de Tulear became eligible to compete for regular championships as a part of the AKC Non-Sporting Group on July 2, 2014, and Besito finished his title on July 18, 2014, in his seventh show, at the Hoosier Tire Cluster, in South Bend, Indiana. Besito is only the fourth coton (and third male coton) in history to earn an AKC Championship, and he did it on the 16th calendar day after our entry into regular classes, AND on his sixteenth-month birthday as well! He earned points toward his Championship in every single show entered after the breed went into regular classes, earning one Best of Opposite Sex, and SIX Best of Breeds in those seven shows! We would like to thank Judge Norman Patton for awarding Besito the Best of Breed that put him over the top! . Since July 18th, Besito has participated in another 4 shows, and has taken Best of Breed in each and every one of them! He is now well on his way to earning his AKC Grand Championship and we will be thrilled when we are able to make that announcement. We are super proud of this beautiful little boy whom I like to call \"the happiest dog in the world\"!\n\nBesito and I totally surprised ourselves by taking Best of Breed at the United States of America Coton de Tulear Club Open Show (the USACTC Coton National Specialty) in Orlando, Florida on Friday, December 13, 2013, during Eukanuba week! I know that my Beso is a great dog, but he was the youngest coton entered in the show (still in the 6-9 month puppy dog class), and I did not think a new baby had much of a chance to beat the many established champion show dogs that were entered in this show. Yet we beat 24 other cotons to a Best of Breed, and then took Reserve Best in Miscellaneous Class, ultimately beating 74 other dogs of various breeds that day, second only to the Mini American Shepherd who took BIMISC!! A very proud, very exciting day, and I handled him all by myself! Many thanks to Judge Dr. Steve Keating, who apparently also sees what I see in Besito, and to his breeders, Denise and Peter Simenauer, of Dior Cotons, for entrusting him to me, and to the USACTC and all the competitors, for putting on a fine show. Who says Friday the 13th is unlucky?? See some photos from the National Specialty, the trophy and ribbons we won, and other highlights of our very first Eukanuba week below."
