        "text": "THOR\n\nThor is one of our own breedings to be kept for the intention of future breeding purposes. He is from a breeding done in co-operation with Jacques Cyr of Barbochos Trois Rivieres\n\n​\n\n\"BIS Can/Am CH. Cahal Biscay's Dapper Citrine CGN\"\n\nThor was born February 28, 2018 at our farm in Stratford, Ontario. He is one of 9 puppies born to GCH. Yara Biscay's for Butterblac and CH.

Angus is a brown dog with a fawn recessive coat. His mother is one of our own, Wyllow Biscay's Grand Opal. Angus is silly.

His CAER was normal until May 2022 and then a cataract was seen - it will be retested in 2024 to establish significance. His PRA-PRCD Clear both by parentage and by lab results. .

Eowyn Biscay's Belle Malachite\"\n\nMerry was born at Alma Street Veterinary Hospital with her 5 siblings, by Cesarean section, on a sunny Thursday morning, May 14, 2020. She is one of 6 puppies born to Yara Biscay's for Butterblac (Lily) x Allfordogs Ed Sheeran (Angus).\n\nMerry's breeding was a dream of mine since we got Angus, because of the inbreeding of the Polish/Finnish and French lines we love and hold in high regard.\n\nMerry lives in Waterloo with Pippin and Ron and Johanne, with lots of visits to the farm to see us as well. She enjoys chasing anything that moves, swimming and has a great nose for scenting.\n\nMerry is CKC registered with a 3 generation pedigree. Merry is a Canadian Kennel Club Champion.\n\nHer health testings are done and her official OFA Hips are Good (A2) and Elbows are Normal (0/0) CAER normal, PRA-PRCD - Clear by parentage and confirmed by lab results. Cardiac and Thyroid are Normal.\n\nNINA\n\n​\n\nNina is a fiercely loyal and very smart dog. She was born here of our own breeding, at our farm with intentions of future breeding purposes.\n\n\"BPIG Eugenia Biscay's Sparkling Chrysoberyl\"\n\nNina is 1 of 8 pups born November 25, 2020 to Outdoors Delphine (Della) x RoVer's Mazu of Gentle Rivers. She has a very keen nose and innate hunting instinct. She definitely follows in her mother's footsteps in scenting out prey!! Nina is CKC registered. Her health testings are done and her official OFA Hips A2 (Good) Elbows Normal (0/0). Her CAER is clear (2022), PRA-PRCD carrier and Cardiac normal.\n\nIVY\n\n​\n\nIvy (or sometimes known as Harvey) is a sweet and happy dog. She was bred in cooperation with RoVer Barbet when using Angus for stud.\n\n\"RoVer's Secret Agent Poison Ivy CGN\"\n\nIvy was born January 2, 2021 in Severn Bridge, ON to RoVer's Alice n' Wonderland x All for dogs Ed Sheeran (Angus) and was 1 of 7 pups. I was fortunate enough to go up and see her a few times - and do her testing before bringing her home. She is a strong meek dog, with lots of opinions, and she steals hearts wherever she goes! She lives with our friends Seamus and Carolyn in Kincardine, ON and gets to run endless in fields and on the shores of Lake Huron. Ivy is CKC registgered and her health testings have been completed, and she is officially OFA hips A1 (Excellent), elbows normal (0/0), CAER normal (2020), PRA-PRCD clear (by parentage), Cardiac normal.\n\n​\n\nAll of our breeding dogs are health tested and temperament tested.\n\nAll of our puppies are tested at 49 days using the Volhard Temperament Test and at 56 days with the Hastings Personality and Structure Method.\n\nWe offer breeder support for the lifetime of your Barbet.\n\nWe CAER (formally CERF - eyes) as well as Xray HIPS and ELBOWS, which had been previously certified through the OVC (Guelph Veterinary University - Canada) and now the OFA (Orthopedic Foundation for Animals - USA).\n\nWe have also started screening for PRA-PRCD although it is NOT a lab verified test, is thought that it is our specific breeds testing for this disease. More time and testing to verify it however, for now it does seem prudent to use this as a testing marker. Occasionally, we will test for PRA-CORD-1 as well based on the lineage. A variety of other tests may also be done when and where necessary and at our discretion, thyroid, cardiac, etc. All of the above results are published on the internet and are there for the viewing.\n\n​\n\nIf you don't see a test listed or a link listed and you are interested, please ask. We would be happy to share the official documented results (certificates, registrations) with you.\n\nOFA - here\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​"
