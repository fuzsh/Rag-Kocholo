        "text": "Luke began his acting career at the age of five, appearing as Mel Gibson's son in \"We Were Soldiers.\" Not knowing how to read yet, he simply recited the pledge of allegiance-a move that would land him the role. He was also cast as \"Stevie Dewberry\" in the family film \"Because of Winn-Dixie\" at age eight, after choosing to audition with a toothpick in his mouth. The choice set him apart from the hundreds of boys vying for the role. The director, Wayne Wang, loved the idea and even used it in the film. In 2006, Luke was cast in Walden Media's \"How to Eat Fried Worms\" as the main character of \"Billy Forrester.\" However, it wasn't until he was a freshman in high school that Luke realized that acting was what he wanted to do for the rest of his life, so in 2012 the family permanently moved to Los Angeles.\n\nHis past TV credits include the television pilots \"Life on the Water,\" the WB's revival of \"Family Affair\" starring Tim Curry and Gary Cole, and the Disney Channel pilots \"Madison High\" and \"Zombies and Cheerleaders.\" Other credits include starring in the Disney Channel's original movies \"Minutemen\" and \"Girl vs. Monster.\" Luke's other past motion picture credits include playing the role of autistic teen \"Alan Wheddon\" in \"Dear John.\" As well as a vast collection of failed pilots, including Amazon's \"Point of Honor\", helmed by Carlton Cuse.\n\nBenward was born in Franklin, Tennessee, to Kenda Benward (née Wilkerson), an actress/coach, and Aaron Benward, a singer/ songwriter. His grandfather, Jeoffrey Benward, was a Contemporary Christian music singer. Part of an entertainment family, Luke got his acting bug by tagging along to auditions with his mother, actress, acting coach and CMT's first on-air personality, Kenda Benward. He got his musical heritage from his father, Aaron Benward, an award-winning producer, songwriter and recording artist. Luke is truly a triple threat. He studied dance with hip hop choreographer, Nick Bass (Britney Spears, Chris Brown, Christina Aguilera, and Michael Jackson) for four years. He also recorded his first five-song EP called Let Your Love Out in 2008 and supported that effort with a fall and spring 50 city tour.\n\nBenward resides in Los Angeles, California .\n\nWill Poulter is an English actor, recognized for his performances as Lee Carter in Der Sohn von Rambow (2007), Eustace Scrubb in Die Chroniken von Narnia - Die Reise auf der Morgenröte (2010), and Kenny Rossmore in Wir sind die Millers (2013). Will was born in Hammersmith, London, the son of Caroline (Barrah), a nurse, and Neil Poulter, a professor of cardiology. His mother was raised in an Anglo family in Kenya, where her own father was a prominent game warden at the Maasai Mara wildlife sanctuary.\n\nPoulter was educated at The Harrodian School, where he participated in drama. He said in an interview that his drama teacher (Laura Lawson) encouraged his audition for the Hammer and Tongs film, Der Sohn von Rambow (2007), by knocking on his English class window and mouthing \"auditions\" while pointing at a flier. He was later cast as the spiky-haired delinquent \"Lee Carter\". Laura Lawson was also responsible for the E4 comedy sketch show, School of Comedy (2009), in which Poulter appears portraying various roles, such as \"Mr. Mills\" and a South African security guard. Beginning as an after-school club, School of Comedy (2009) involves children parodying the world of adults. The show was taken to The Edinburgh Festival Fringe and, in 2009, it was adapted into a 6-part television series for E4. The show has, so far, run for two seasons. In 2008, Poulter was cast as \"Eustace Clarence Scrubb\" in the third film of the \"Narnia\" franchise, Die Chroniken von Narnia - Die Reise auf der Morgenröte (2010). \"Dawn Treader\" was filmed in Queensland, Australia. During his almost six-month stay in Australia, Poulter was accompanied by his mother and younger sister. His father was not able to stay the entire time because of work, and his older siblings were able to stay for about two weeks, until they had to return to England. Poulter noted that, though it was hard to be separated from his family, they were able to keep in touch through phone calls and emails. More recently, Poulter appeared in the British independent film Wild Bill - Vom Leben beschissen! (2011), directed by Dexter Fletcher, and played Kenny Rossmore, his first American film character, in the comedic Wir sind die Millers (2013), a major box office hit in the United States. His upcoming roles include Maze Runner - Die Auserwählten im Labyrinth (2014), opposite Dylan O'Brien, and the lead in iBoy (2017).\n\nOne of today's leading talents across both independent and mainstream film, Logan Lerman is an immensely talented actor who takes on challenging roles and brings dynamic characters to life on screen.\n\nLogan was born in Beverly Hills, to a Jewish family. His parents are Lisa (Goldman), who worked as his manager, and Larry Lerman, an orthotist and businessman. He has two siblings, Lindsey and Lucas, both older. His family operate the orthotics and prosthetics company Lerman & Son, which was founded by his great-grandfather, Jacob Lerman.\n\nWhen he was two and a half years old, Logan told his mother that he wanted to be an actor. At the age of four, Logan had an agent and was booked for two commercials. He made his big screen debut as William, the youngest son of Mel Gibson's character, in Roland Emmerich's war drama Der Patriot (2000), and then appeared as the younger version of Gibson's character Nick Marshall in Nancy Meyers's romantic comedy Was Frauen wollen (2000). After a small role in 2001's Unterwegs mit Jungs (2001), by Penny Marshall, he starred in the John Grisham adaptation A Painted House (2003), a made-for-television film that won him the first of his three Young Artist Awards.\n\nLogan played the younger version of Ashton Kutcher's character, Evan, in Butterfly Effect (2004). After a guest-starring role in 10-8: Officers on Duty (2003), he starred in the WB Network's series Jack & Bobby (2004), where he portrays Bobby (Robert) McCallister, a teenager who will grow up to be President of the United States. After the show's cancellation in 2005, Logan returned to film, starring in the family adventure Eulen - Kleine Freunde in großer Gefahr! (2006). The next year, he played the son of Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey) in the dark thriller Nummer 23 (2007), and co-starred with Russell Crowe and Christian Bale in James Mangold's critically-acclaimed Western remake Todeszug nach Yuma (2007). His next two roles were a foul-mouthed private school student in the comedy Meet Bill (2007) and actor George Hamilton in the period drama My One and Only - Auf der Suche nach Mr. Right (2009). Both were independent films that received limited releases. Also in 2009, Logan appeared with Gerard Butler in the R-rated action thriller Gamer (2009), as a foul-mouthed teenager who controls Butler's character in a real-life video game.\n\nIn 2010, Logan starred as Percy in the fantasy adventure Percy Jackson: Diebe im Olymp (2010), based on the best-selling young adult book series of the same title. The film gave him notice among a wider audience. Subsequently, he starred as D'Artagnan in a remake of Die drei Musketiere (2011), which was Logan's grandfather's favorite childhood book. Lerman then headlined the coming-of-age indie drama Vielleicht lieber morgen (2012), alongside Emma Watson, Paul Rudd and Ezra Miller, based on the 1999 novel of the same name. Perks garnered numerous nominations and wins at the People's Choice Awards, The Independent Spirit Awards and the Teen Choice Awards, and Logan received a 2013 Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actor in a Drama. Around this time, he had a supporting role in the independent film Love Stories - Erste Lieben, zweite Chancen (2012), and returned to star in Percy Jackson: Im Bann des Zyklopen (2013).\n\nHis first 2014 role was in Darren Aronofsky's acclaimed Biblical epic film Noah (2014), playing one of the title character's sons, Ham. The film, also starring Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, Anthony Hopkins, Douglas Booth, and Emma Watson, grossed over $100 million at the North American box office. Logan next starred with Brad Pitt, Shia LaBeouf, Jon Bernthal, and Michael Peña in the World War II-set action drama Herz aus Stahl (2014); in the film, he played one of several American soldiers engaged in tank combat against the German forces, during the last weeks of the Nazi regime.\n\nLerman next played the lead in writer-director James Schamus's 1950s-set drama Empörung (2016). Logan received rave reviews for his performance as Marcus Messner, an idealistic Jewish atheist from Newark who travels to Ohio to study at a conservative Midwestern Lutheran college. The film is based on Philip Roth's bestselling novel of the same name, and premiered at 2016's Sundance Film Festival.\n\nIn 2018, Logan voiced real-life soldier Robert Conroy in Sgt. Stubby: An American Hero (2018), about the famous World War I war dog. He began the 2020s starring with Al Pacino and Josh Radnor in the stylish television drama Hunters (2020), playing Jonah Heidelbaum, a Brooklyn teenager who joins a group hunting down escaped Nazis. His upcoming roles include Sean Fogle in the Irish-set drama Dem Leben auf der Spur (2019), with John Hawkes as his character's father, and Fred Nemser in the thriller Shirley (2020).\n\nWhen Logan is not working, he likes to play soccer and baseball. He is an LA Lakers fan.\n\nDylan O'Brien was born in New York City, to Lisa Rhodes, a former actress who also ran an acting school, and Patrick B. O'Brien, a camera operator. His father is of Irish descent and his mother is of English, Spanish, and Italian ancestry. Dylan grew up in Springfield Township, Union County, New Jersey, before moving with his family to Hermosa Beach, California when he was 12 years old. Before getting bit by the acting bug, Dylan planned to attend film school and become a cinematographer, just like his father. But once he landed the role of Scott's (Tyler Posey) goofy sidekick Stiles on Teen Wolf (2011), he decided to put off school (he was initially under consideration for the role of Scott, but he was more interested in playing Stiles).\n\nDylan has developed an extensive YouTube following for a series of comic online shorts which he directed, produced and starred in. He made his film debut as one of the stars of the entirely improvised independent feature film High Road (2011), directed by Upright Citizens Brigade. O'Brien's first lead role in a film was playing Dave in the comedy The First Time - Dein erstes Mal vergisst Du nie! (2012), opposite Britt Robertson and directed by Jonathan Kasdan. He subsequently had a supporting role, playing tech expert Stuart, in the Vince Vaughn/Owen Wilson comedy Prakti.com (2013), and headlined the fantasy adventure film Maze Runner - Die Auserwählten im Labyrinth (2014), also starring Will Poulter and Kaya Scodelario, as well as its sequel, Maze Runner - Die Auserwählten in der Brandwüste (2015) and the final movie, The Death Cure (2018). He landed the role of Stu in the first episode of Weird City (2019) and also got the role of Sam Taylor in the first episode of Amazing stories (2020). He made five other movies in the meantime, Love and Monsters, Flashback, Maximum Truth, Not Okay and The outfit. He also did one short film: All too well, produced by Taylor Swift and stared in the third episode of the third season in The Other Two.\n\nAaron Taylor-Johnson is an English stage, television, and film actor.\n\nHe was born Aaron Perry Johnson in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, to Sarah and Robert Johnson, a civil engineer. He has a sister, Gemma Johnson, who had a small role in his movie Tom & Thomas (2002). Aaron is of English-Russian Jewish descent.\n\nHe began performing at age six, appearing in plays like Macbeth and All My Sons. He worked frequently on television as a young actor, having roles in the TV films Die Bibel: Apokalypse (2002), Behind Closed Doors (2003), The Best Man (2006), and Sherlock Holmes and the Baker Street Irregulars (2007), and series The Bill (1984), Family Business (2003), Feather Boy (2004), Casualty (1986), Talk to Me (2007), and Nearly Famous (2007). He made his feature debut in the British film Tom & Thomas (2002), where he played the dual title roles. His first American film was the sequel Shanghai Knights (2003), playing a child version of Charles Chaplin, and his early film credits also include Dead Cool (2004), Herr der Diebe (2006), and The Illusionist - Nichts ist wie es scheint (2006), where he played a young version of Edward Norton's character Eisenheim.\n\nAaron became known in England after playing a leading role in the film Frontalknutschen (2008), opposite Georgia Groome. He then co-starred with Carey Mulligan in the American drama Zeit der Trauer (2009), played John Lennon in the biography Nowhere Boy (2009), and had the lead role of a teenage would-be superhero, Dave Lizewski, in the action superhero riff Kick-Ass (2010), which introduced him to a wide American audience.\n\nAfter appearing in the thriller Chatroom (2010), Aaron had a large part in the Irish-set drama Albert Nobbs (2011), and co-starred with Taylor Kitsch and Blake Lively in Oliver Stone's California-based action-thriller Savages (2012). Also in 2012, he played Keira Knightley's character's forbidden love interest, Count Vronsky, in the adaptation Anna Karenina (2012), set in Russia.\n\nAfter reprising his role in the sequel Kick-Ass 2 (2013), Aaron had starring roles in his two biggest films to date, the blockbusters Godzilla (2014), as soldier Ford Brody, and Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), as Pietro Maximoff (known as Quicksilver in the Marvel comic books).

Next, he won a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor for his role as the shady Ray in the drama Nocturnal Animals (2016), and co-starred with John Cena in the war thriller The Wall (2017).\n\nWhile filming Nowhere Boy (2009), Aaron began a relationship with the film's director, artist Sam Taylor-Wood. The two married in 2012, and blended their surnames together. Aaron began being credited as Aaron Taylor-Johnson, while Sam became known as Sam Taylor-Johnson. The couple has two children together, and Aaron is also stepfather to Sam's two daughters from her previous marriage.\n\nZachary David Alexander Efron was born October 18, 1987 in San Luis Obispo, California, to Starla Baskett, a secretary, and David Efron, an electrical engineer. He has a younger brother, Dylan. The surname \"Efron\", which is Hebrew and a Biblical place name, comes from Zac's Polish Jewish paternal grandfather.\n\nZac was raised in Arroyo Grande, CA. He took his first step toward acting at the age of eleven, after his parents noticed his singing ability. Singing and acting lessons soon led to an appearance in a production of \"Gypsy\" that ran 90 performances, and he was hooked. After appearing on-stage in \"Peter Pan\", \"Auntie Mame\", \"Little Shop of Horrors\" and \"The Music Man\", guest parts quickly followed on television series, including Firefly: Der Aufbruch der Serenity (2002), Emergency Room: Die Notaufnahme (1994), CSI: Miami (2002), Navy CIS (2003), and The Guardian - Retter mit Herz (2001). After guest-starring in several episodes of Summerland Beach (2004), Zac joined the regular cast as girl-crazy Cameron Bale. He also starred in several pilots, such as The Big Wide World of Carl Laemke (2003) and Triple Play (2004), and played an autistic child in the television film Miracle Run (2004), alongside Mary-Louise Parker and Aidan Quinn.

As part of the all-star cast, he shared a Critics Choice Award for Best Acting Ensemble and the 2007 Hollywood Film Festival Award for Ensemble of the Year, and was honored with a Screen Actors Guild Award® nomination for Outstanding Motion Picture Cast.

He added surfing after spending days on the beach for \"Summerland.\" He played the piano at home. He has also fixed up two cars in his spare time, a Delorean and '65 Mustang convertible, both treasured hand-me-downs from his even-more-treasured grandfather.\n\nArmand Douglas Hammer was born in Los Angeles, California, to Dru Ann (Mobley) and Michael Armand Hammer, a businessman. His great-grandfather, Armand Hammer, was a prominent tycoon and philanthropist who ran the company Occidental Petroleum for many decades.

The Gosling family moved to Cornwall, Ontario, where Ryan grew up and was home-schooled by his mother. He also attended Gladstone Public School and Cornwall Collegiate & Vocational School, where he excelled in Drama and Fine Arts. The family then relocated to Burlington, Ontario, where Ryan attended Lester B. Pearson High School.\n\nRyan first performed as a singer at talent contests with Mandi. He attended an open audition in Montreal for the TV series \"The Mickey Mouse Club\" (The Mickey Mouse Club (1989)) in January 1993 and beat out 17,000 other aspiring actors for a a spot on the show. While appearing on \"MMC\" for two years, he lived with co-star Justin Timberlake's family.\n\nThough he received no formal acting training, after \"MMC,\" Gosling segued into an acting career, appearing on the TV series Der junge Hercules (1998) and Breaker High (1997), as well as the films The Slaughter Rule (2002), Mord nach Plan (2002), and Gegen jede Regel (2000). He first attracted serious critical attention with his performance as the Jewish neo-Nazi in the controversial film Inside a Skinhead (2001), which won the Grand Jury Prize at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival. He was cast in the part by writer-director Henry Bean, who believed that Gosling's strict upbringing gave him the insight to understand the character Danny, whose obsessiveness with the Judaism he was born into turns to hatred. He was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award as Best Male Lead in 2002 for the role and won the Golden Aries award from the Russian Guild of Film Critics.\n\nAfter appearing in the sleeper Wie ein einziger Tag (2004) in 2004, Gosling won the dubious honor of being named one of the 50 Hottest Bachelors by People Magazine.

His mother is Jewish and his father was of Portuguese and Swedish descent.\n\nGrowing up with his two younger brothers, Dave Franco, also an actor, and Tom Franco, James graduated from Palo Alto High School in 1996 and went on to attend UCLA, majoring in English. To overcome his shyness, he got into acting while studying there, which, much to his parents' dismay, he left after only one year. After fifteen months of intensive study at Robert Carnegie's Playhouse West, James began actively pursuing his dream of finding work as an actor in Hollywood. In that short time, he landed himself a starring role on Voll daneben, voll im Leben (1999). The show, however, was not a hit to its viewers at the time, and was canceled after its first year. Now, it has become a cult-hit. Prior to joining Voll daneben, voll im Leben (1999), Franco starred in the TV miniseries Tage voller Blut - Die Bestie von Dallas (1999). After that, he had a starring role in Hoffnungslos verliebt (2000).\n\nAlthough he'd been working steadily, it wasn't until the TNT made-for-television movie, James Dean - Ein Leben auf der Überholspur (2001) that James rose to fan-magazine fame and got to show off his talent. Since then, he has been working non-stop. After losing the lead role to Tobey Maguire, James settled for the part of \"Harry Osborne\", Spider-Man's best friend in the summer 2002 major hit Spider-Man (2002).

Wolfe's Das Lächeln der Sterne (2008), starring Richard Gere and Diane Lane and in Paul Haggis' Im Tal von Elah (2007), starring Tommy Lee Jones. Also starring opposite Sean Penn in Gus Van Sant's Milk (2008) in which his performance earned him an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actor. Definitely growing out of his shyness, James Franco is turning into a legend of his own.\n\nWith his breakthrough performance as Eames in Christopher Nolan's sci-fi thriller Inception (2010), English actor Tom Hardy has been brought to the attention of mainstream audiences worldwide. However, the versatile actor has been steadily working on both stage and screen since his television debut in the miniseries Band of Brothers: Wir waren wie Brüder (2001). After being cast in the World War II drama, Hardy left his studies at the prestigious Drama Centre in London and was subsequently cast as Twombly in Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down (2001) and as the villain Shinzon in Star Trek - Nemesis (2002).\n\nEdward Thomas Hardy was born on September 15, 1977 in Hammersmith, London; his mother, Elizabeth Anne (Barrett), is an artist and painter, and his father, Chips Hardy, is a writer. He is of English and Irish descent. Hardy was brought up in East Sheen, London, and first studied at Reed's School. His education continued at Tower House School, then at Richmond Drama School, and subsequently at the Drama Centre London, along with fellow Oscar nominee Michael Fassbender. After winning a modeling competition at age 21, he had a brief contract with the agency Models One.\n\nTom spent his teens and early twenties battling delinquency, alcoholism and drug addiction; after completing his work on Star Trek - Nemesis (2002), he sought treatment and has also admitted that his battles with addiction ended his five-year marriage to Sarah Ward. Returning to work in 2003, Hardy was awarded the Evening Standard Most Promising Newcomer Award for his theatre performances in the productions of \"In Arabia, We'd All Be Kings\" and \"Blood\". In 2003, Tom also co-starred in the play \"The Modernists\" with Paul Popplewell, Jesse Spencer and Orlando Wells.\n\nDuring the next five years, Hardy worked consistently in film, television and theatre, playing roles as varied as Robert Dudley in the BBC's Elizabeth I - The Virgin Queen (2005), Bill Sikes in Oliver Twist (2007) and starring in \"The Man of Mode\" at the National Theatre. On the silver screen, he appeared in the crime thriller Layer Cake (2004) with Daniel Craig, Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette (2006), and the romp Scenes of a Sexual Nature (2006).\n\nIn 2006, Hardy created \"Shotgun\", an underground theatre company along with director Robert Delamere, and directed a play, penned by his father for the company, called \"Blue on Blue\". In 2007, Hardy received a best actor BAFTA nomination for his touching performance as Stuart Shorter in the BBC adaptation of Alexander Masters' bestselling biography Wer war Stuart Shorter? (2007).

In the film Bronson (2008), Hardy played the notorious Charles Bronson (given name, Michael Peterson), the \"most violent prisoner in Britain\". Bald, pumped-up, and outfitted with Bronson's signature strongman mustache, Hardy is unrecognizable and gives a harrowing performance that is physically fearless and psychologically unsettling. Director Nicolas Winding Refn breaks the fourth wall with Hardy retelling his tales directly to viewers as well as performing them outright before an audience of his own imagining. The performance mixes terrifying brutality, vaudevillian showmanship, wry humor, and an alarming amount of commitment, and won Hardy a British Independent Film Award for Best Actor. The performance got Hollywood's attention, and in 2009, Hardy was named one of Variety's \"10 Actors to Watch\". That year, he continued to garner praise for his starring role in The Take - Zwei Jahrzehnte in der Mafia (2009), a four-part adaptation of Martina Cole's bestselling crime novel, as well as for his performance as Heathcliff in a version of Emily Brontë's Sturmhöhe (2009).\n\nRecent work includes the aforementioned breakthrough appearance in Inception (2010) alongside Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Ken Watanabe, Michael Caine, Marion Cotillard and Elliot Page.

Tom also starred in the heralded Cold War thriller, Dame, König, As, Spion (2011) with Colin Firth and Gary Oldman. Hardy rejoined Christopher Nolan for The Dark Knight Rises (2012); he played the villain role of Bane opposite Christian Bale, Anne Hathaway, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Gary Oldman. Hardy's menacing physique and his character's scrambled, hard-to-distinguish voice became a major discussion point as the film was released.\n\nOutside of performing, Hardy is the patron for the charity \"Flack\", which is an organization to aid the recovery of the homeless in Cambridge. And in 2010, Hardy was named an Ambassador for The Prince's Trust, which helps disadvantaged youth. On the recent stage, he starred in the Brett C. Leonard play \"The Long Red Road\" in early 2010. Written for Hardy and directed by Philip Seymour Hoffman, the play was staged at Chicago's Goodman Theater.\n\nIn 2015, Hardy starred as the iconic Mad Max in George Miller's reboot of his franchise, Mad Max: Fury Road (2015).

Hardy also starred on the BBC series Peaky Blinders - Gangs of Birmingham (2013), alongside Cillian Murphy, and on the television series Taboo (2017), both created by Steven Knight.\n\nHe has an outlaw biker story among other projects in development. In 2010, Hardy became engaged to fellow English actress Charlotte Riley, whom he starred with in The Take - Zwei Jahrzehnte in der Mafia (2009) and Emily Brontë's Sturmhöhe (2009), and is raising a young son, Louis Thomas Hardy, with ex-girlfriend Rachael Speed.
