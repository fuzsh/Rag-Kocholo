        "text": "A Reliable Wife is one of those rare novels I had a hard time putting down. It’s a little older (2009) and I first read it during my bookstore days. I went on to sell about a hundred copies single-handedly after reading it, it was that good. I hope you think so, too.\n\nVicki recommends:\n\nThe Renaissance Soul: Life Design for People with Too Many Passions to Pick Just One by Margaret Lobenstine\n\nWoohoo! Finally, a book I can throw at hypothetical people when they question my life choices and lack of retirement savings. You know, those same hypothetical people I am winning brilliant Ted Talk level arguments against in the shower. Turns out maybe I don’t have unmanaged ADHD; I’m actually a Benjamin Franklin level genius. Oh wait, the third chapter explains that you can have ADHD and be a Benjamin Franklin and that you also can be a Renaissance Soul without neurodivergence. Likewise, you can have ADHD and be a Mozart – the other end of the spectrum, someone who picks one thing, early on, and sticks with it for the rest of their life. I’m getting hives just writing that. The Renaissance Soul is basically a self-esteem boosting, life-affirming, strategy- providing encouragement letter to those of us who have lots, and lots… and lots of varied interests. Did you also write in your 8th grade yearbook that you wanted to be a doctor, lawyer, Broadway actress and barista at Starbucks (it was the early 90s)? Then this book is for you.\n\nThe House of Hidden Meanings by RuPaul\n\nI am a massive RuPaul fan and have read all of his books (also in the library system) – Lettin’ it All Hang Out and GuRU, watched every season of Drag Race and Drag Race All Stars, watched his episode on Finding Your Roots (Season 6 – also in the library system) and am always lying ravenously in wait for his next production. The House of Hidden Meanings is RuPaul refined – telling his story of growing up in San Diego, a wild youth in Atlanta and a young adulthood in New York to become the living legend he is today, with a mature author’s voice missing from his previous memoirs. The message is consistent with his other books – LOVE is the answer, love yourself enough to be who you really are, and don’t take life too seriously, however Hidden Meanings really hones in on the absolute tenacity required to believe in your dreams no matter what the circumstances. RuPaul didn’t just believe, he KNEW that he was going to become a star- and not just a rock star, but a multifaceted superstar of the world and empire builder. And that’s exactly what he did! Yes, he faced challenges and adversity, loneliness and ostracization, substance struggles and depression, but he let all of it fuel his trajectory towards his goal. I’m inspired, as always, by the man, the maestro, the luminary, the culture creator, our queen mother, RuPaul.\n\nMay 2024 Picks:\n\nKim recommends:\n\nMy Name Is Barbra by Barbra Streisand\n\nBarbra Streisand’s autobiography My Name Is Barbra is– like the actress/director/producer/singer/etc. herself– vivid, funny, fascinating, sometimes frustrating, and bigger than life (992 pages). She tells us in great detail not just of the works she’s created but the meals she’s eaten and the clothes she’s worn (and in some cases designed). There’s also a lot here about her collaborators, friends, enemies, lovers, two husbands, and the mother that she could never make happy. There’s surprisingly little about her son, although she’s clearly proud of him. Some people might find this book overwhelming, yet I enjoyed the richness of the banquet. But, yes, give yourself time to absorb it all, because it’s definitely not a quick read.\n\nPeggy recommends:\n\nKnife: Meditations after an Attempted Murder by Salman Rushdie\n\nThirty years after the fatwa was ordered on him, Knife is Rushdie’s detailed recollection of the vicious knife attack that took his right eye and nearly cost him his life. This is a moving account of Rushdie’s recovery, from the attack itself through the healing aftermath. It’s lyrical, it’s thought provoking, and, at times, even amusing.\n\nThe Berry Pickers by Amanda Peters\n\nThe Berry Pickers, told in the voices of two people, begins with Joe, a six-year-old indigenous boy from Nova Scotia whose 4-year-old sister, Ruthie, disappears while picking berries with her migrant family in Massachusetts. Exhausting all efforts to find her, the family returns to Nova Scotia without her, only to return each year for berry picking season and the endless search for their lost loved one.\n\nThe second voice is Norma, a dark skinned young girl kept company by shadows and half memories. As time goes on, Norma grows more and more suspicious of her “family”—a pale-skinned mother who suffers from exhaustion and mental illness, her aunt who helps her navigate her peculiar living arrangements and a father who caters to his frail wife with aloof indifference to his child.\n\nThe Berry Pickers is the story of two families, a tale of festering wounds, prejudice, untreated trauma, and the cost of truths concealed.\n\nVicki recommends:\n\nThis juvenile graphic novel is an action packed buddy adventure that kept my attention from beginning to end. A diverse group of young people at boarding school in China have to hack their way out of school, save a tiny dragon from a multi-national pharmaceutical crime operation, contend with a Sea Goddess, and usurp a religious cult vying for world domination. All before dinner! Fun! I am looking forward to #2!\n\nThis is a book of poetry like no other. Some poems are like reading the equivalent of the surrealist “Exquisite Corpse” game – playing with words that seem disparate but make a profound and surprising whole. Some poems are complete plays on the auditory meanings of words spelled as their homonyms. I read these out loud and though the collection is dense it is delightful.\n\nNikki recommends:\n\nWild, Wild West DVD\n\nThis movie totally holds up, at least to my nostalgia it does.\n\nFebruary 2024 Picks:\n\nKim recommends:\n\nFungi Grow by Maria Gianferrari\n\nFungi Grow is a beautifully illustrated nonfiction book that offers fungal facts in a clear and yet poetic way. Children as young as three can enjoy the watercolor pictures and the text with larger font. Smaller, less simple but still approachable text offers more information for kids at old as 9 or 10. Gianferrari shows that fungus can be deadly but also beneficial, and always interesting.\n\nPeggy recommends:\n\nDistant Sons by Tim Johnston\n\nThe long awaited “sequel” to Descent, Distant Sons picks up Sean Courtland years after the traumatic events of his youth. Sean is now a transient carpenter, traveling the country doing odd jobs wherever he lands. When the old Chevy truck breaks down in a small town in Wisconsin, a town full of secrets of its own, Sean finds himself stranded and looking for ways to earn a little money. Soon, he finds himself defending the honor of a local waitress and befriending another transient with secrets of his own. I love this book because the characters all had secrets and pasts they are trying to outrun and each understandably so. I highly recommend all of Tim Johnston’s books, this one especially.\n\nAmie recommends:\n\nRing Shout by P. Djèlí Clark\n\nVicki brought this book to my attention; I think it is my new favorite. Set in an alternate past, an alien breed has taken sides with the KKK making a super racist and a super black heroine. It’s spectacular!\n\nHoldovers DVD\n\nDecent film. I wanted it to be more Dead Poets, but it was fun and sweet and sad enough. Worth the watch. And you never go wrong with Paul Giamatti.\n\nWay of the Gun DVD\n\nI may have recommended this before, but it’s worth a second recommendation, either way. This film is fantastic. My favorite Benicio del Toro film, and that’s saying a lot. It’s a beautiful gangster/western/robbery-gone-wrong/buddy film that’s violent and heartbreaking. It should’ve won an Oscar, but don’t get me started on Oscars. Angry face.\n\nJohn recommends:\n\nJeeves and the King of Clubs by Ben Schott\n\nThis book is almost unbelievable as it in some ways is better than the PG Wodehouse books it parodies as a tribute. One suggestion. Stay close to a dictionary. You probably wouldn’t miss very much but learning about the unusual words used is fun. And for one word you might need the Oxford English Dictionary (the Library has one, make a list). This book is clever, funny, and engrossing. It’s a page turner. Really good news is that when you’ve read this one there is a Zip Book request for the next book. We can hope it’s a series. Enjoy!\n\nPeggy recommends:\n\nLady Tan’s Circle of Women by Lisa See\n\nInspired by the true story of a woman physician from 15th-century China, Lisa See’s latest about a girl being primed from a young age to become a female doctor in a male oriented world. Ms. See’s novel incorporates the Four Examinations of Chinese medicine— looking, listening, touching, and asking—something a man can never do with a female patient. Hence the need for educating women, even though Confucius said “an educated woman is a useless woman”.\n\nThroughout the book, Ms. See shares the difficulties of growing up female in China. When this young girl, Tan Yunxian, reaches a certain age, she is forced to take her place in society with an arranged marriage and all the traditions that go along with being a “proper” wife. Ms. See is expert at delving into the history of Chinese culture along with a captivating story of women helping women.\n\nI highly recommend you read this book then join us for our virtual discussion with Ms. See, Feb 6th at 4:30. Here is the link to the ZOOM discussion or, better yet, join us at the library for our audience participation of the ZOOM presentation.\n\nJohn recommends:\n\nIt Ain’t Over (DVD)\n\nThis is a biographical tribute to Yogi Berra, a great ball player, excellent manager and very effective coach. The film was produced by Yogi’s oldest grand daughter and it was apparent that she had great love and respect for Yogi. The film contains marvelous documentary footage from pre-war until his retirement. The reconciliation with George Steinbrenner was especially poignant as Yogi had vowed not to return to Yankee Stadium until Mr. Steinbrenner apologized to him for the way he was fired. Overall I’d say you don’t have to be a baseball fan to like this film as Yogi added so much to the English language, everyone has heard some of his sayings. Enjoy and remember “It Ain’t Over ‘Til It’s Over”.\n\nDecember 2023 Picks:\n\nKim recommends:\n\nDoppelganger is a fascinating nonfiction book but difficult to sum up. Author Naomi Klein went on a strange journey, inside her own mind, through the Internet, and into books and movies, as well as through the real worlds of British Columbia and New Jersey. For years, people had been mixing her up with Naomi Wolf. The two women are close in age and look vaguely alike, with a shared American Jewish background. At one point, they were both married to film-makers named Avi! They also both write about society, but while Klein is a socialist who’s deeply concerned about the environment, Wolf went from a feminist Democrat to an anti-vaxxer who befriended Steve Bannon. As Wolf got deeper and deeper into conspiracy theories, Klein would face more criticism for what people thought were her views but were actually Wolf’s. So Klein took this “trip” to try and figure out what had happened to Wolf. Klein’s friends and family were baffled by her pursuit, especially as COVID-19 descended and changed the world.\n\nAlong the way, Klein found herself examining many doppelgangers (sort of like unrelated “twins”), including on a national level, and international. She tried to understand these “shadow selves” and what they say about us. From finding that an author she swore off of when she was in her 20s (Philip Roth) had wisdom to share thirty years later, to discovering that her Yoga-practicing neighbor wouldn’t vote for Klein’s left-wing husband, there were many surprises in this mirror world. She did her best to understand Wolf’s own journey.\n\nEven if you don’t agree with the eventual destination of the book, it is well worth taking this trip with Naomi and “Other Naomi.”\n\nPeggy recommends:\n\nThis is a quirky tale of a group of octogenarians who have to solve a neighborhood murder in order to cover up one of their own. The characters, although suffering from arthritic hips, hearing loss, dementia, blindness and mobility issues, pool together, along with Agnes’ pet turtle, Hettie, to come to the bottom of the mystery.\n\nIt’s a fun read, especially if you are old enough to relate.\n\nAnd remember, I did say quirky.\n\nA multi-generational mystery featuring a high-powered businesswoman, her daughter and her fiercely independent granddaughter. Lana Rubicon moves to northern California due to a health issue. When her granddaughter, Jack, discovers a body and becomes the main suspect, Lana, against her daughter’s objections, is hot on the trail to solving the mystery and clearing her granddaughter’s name. Having no choice but to help her mother, Beth, along with Jack, join forces with Lana to uncover the truth, a truth that may prove deadly to the family. This is a fun read…think Gilmore girls only with murder.\n\nAmie recommends:\n\nThe Girl and the Ghost by Hanna Alkaf\n\nA heartbreaking story about a girl and her ghost. It was sweet in ways I didn’t think possible and is one of my new favorites.\n\nBarbie DVD\n\nI laughed so hard at this I had to watch it again to hear the jokes I missed. Ryan Gosling better get an Oscar!\n\nVicki recommends:\n\nWondrous Journeys in Strange Lands by Sonia Nimr\n\nThis award winning story tells the tale of a young Palestinian woman born into strange circumstances who leads a life of travel, romance, longing, mystery and adventure. It is a pure DELIGHT to read this worldwide odyssey with a female heroine. It is timeless and beautiful – every sentence makes me happy and every bend in the journey fills me with excitement and suspense. I whole heartedly recommend this book for all lovers of epic sagas and rich storytelling.\n\nNik recommends:\n\nThe Hand-Sculpted House : A Practical and Philosophical Guide to Building a Cob Cottage by Ianto Evans and Michael G Smith\n\nAs the weather cools and we perhaps find ourselves spending more time indoors, it’s wonderful to browse through The Hand-Sculpted House by Ianto Evans and Michael G Smith and re-imagine a domicile that can be built with local materials (perhaps beneath our very own feet?), a structure that is personalized to one’s own needs, and a home created with all the love and intention that rivals any modern, conventionally built home. Utilizing design and construction techniques that predate the industrial revolution, we are empowered to create spaces that utilize the heat-absorbing materials of the earth itself to create comfortable, climate-stable buildings without the need for excessive energy inputs from central heating and cooling systems. So cozy up and rethink what’s possible with this fantastic read filled with illustrations, color photos, and plenty of inspiration for reimagining the future by harnessing the knowledge of the past.\n\nJohn recommends:\n\nNot the Ones Dead by Dana Stabenow\n\nThis the latest in the Kate Shugak series. This one is slightly longer and more involved than most of the earlier books and it will not disappoint.\n\nDirty Thirty by Janet Evanovich\n\nThis latest book is filled with the characters we have all come to know and love. Joe, Bob, Grandma Mazur, Lula, Connie, Ranger, Mrs Plumb (and her way of dealing with stress), and the blue 1953 Buick. The ending may be a surprise. Enjoy.\n\nNovember 2023 Picks:\n\nAmie recommends:\n\nMy Heart Is a Chainsaw by Stephen Graham Jones\n\nThe first book in the trilogy by Stephen Graham Jones that I accidentally read second. It was not as scary as the second one, but still great! And now I have to wait a year for the finale. Dang!\n\nNumb (DVD)\n\nA beautiful film about a man who feels nothing but really wants to feel everything. RIP Matthew Perry!\n\nPeggy recommends:\n\nFriends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing by Matthew Perry\n\nThe passing of Matthew Perry was a devastating blow for all those who adored him in Friends. But Friends was just a small fraction of Matthew’s life. This memoir is a no-holds barred look into his life, his loves and his demons. We will forever remember our favorite Friend, Chandler Bing but more than that, we will remember the man behind the character. RIP Matty.\n\nOctober 2023 Picks:\n\nVicki recommends:\n\nStack the Cats by Susie Ghahremani\n\nThis is my 8 year old’s longtime favorite book. Stack the Cats is a delightful counting book for ages 4 and up that develops counting forward and backward, simple grouping, and understanding more and less than. It is also incredibly cute. There’s something about yelling “Stack!” when reading a book about making cat cairns that will bring out the laughter at bedtime. Of course they all fall down, but all’s well that ends well and this book is adorable to the last page.\n\nThis One Summer by Mariko and Jillian Tamaki\n\nI am including a YA graphic novel this month because it was a challenged book in 2022 and I hope more people read it! This One Summer is a moving coming-of-age story about two young tween friends who have been meeting at the same lake house for their childhoods and the summer that they find themselves on the precipice of teenagers. As the girls watch the teenagers and adults and their respective dramas, they also grapple with how their relationship will make it through the coming transformation. I love when a book manages to capture an in-between time for what it really is – confusing, quiet, observational, internal, alternating between boring and thrilling – without having to add a heavy hand of “The Lesson Is…” The artwork is gorgeous and the purples and blues fit perfectly with the end of summer, end of childhood melancholy. This is a quiet book – there isn’t a big buildup of action, but its heart is beautiful and to me, that’s what we hope to make of our day to day lives.\n\nPeggy recommends:\n\nThe Raging Storm by Ann Cleeves\n\nDuring a severe storm, Detective Matthew Venn is called to the small village of Greystone to investigate the death of Jem Roscoe, a famous sailor who’s body was discovered in a dinghy anchored in Scully Cove. Matthew remembers the village fondly from when he visited as a child as a member of the Brethren, a religious commune his parents belonged to, a group he parted ways with many years ago. With several strong suspects, some of whom are members of the Brethren, Matthew must face his past, put aside his prejudices and investigate Jem’s murder with a clear head.\n\nOnce again, Ann Cleeves gives us an outstanding mystery to solve, dripping with rich characters. If you haven’t read the first two books in the Two Rivers series, I highly recommend those as well. They are The Long Call and The Heron’s Cry.\n\nHow Can I Help You? by Laura Sims\n\nMargo, a former nurse with a string of premature deaths in her wake, gets a job as a Library Assistant, soon establishing herself as the ideal library worker everyone adores. When Patricia, a failed writer, joins the team, she finds herself doubting Margo’s sincerity and sees behind the facade. When a patron turns up dead in the library bathroom, Patricia is hot on the trail of proving Margo is to blame.\n\nI love serial killer books and the best part about this one is its setting—the library!—a win-win for this library staffer! This is a fun read, especially for those who frequent the library.\n\nJohn recommends:\n\nThe Longmire Defense by Craig Johnson\n\nThis latest novel from Craig Johnson introduces a murder case from 1948 that involved Walt’s grandfather Lloyd. It becomes much more complicated than expected because it involved state finances. And Walt finally asks undersheriff Vic Moretti to marry him. Enjoy.\n\nAmie recommends:\n\nDon’t Fear the Reaper by Stephen Graham Jones\n\nSo, this is apparently the second book in a trilogy by one of my new favorite authors. It was so freaking scary that I couldn’t read it at night, but I also couldn’t put it down. Stephen Graham Jones just has this unique way of telling a story without telling it traditionally. And I had to immediately read a dumb book after it just to get my nerves to settle. So scary. Definitely, a good October read!\n\nGhosts: Season 2 BBC (DVD)\n\nThe BBC version of Ghosts is so funny! Read the scary slasher book and then watch Ghosts to calm down.\n\nNik recommends:\n\nBraking Day by Adam Oyebanji\n\nBraking Day was a refreshing reminder of how one may get lost in the endless adventure of deep-space science fiction. Combining a fictitious narrative of human colonization beyond the limits of our familiar solar system with the mysterious observations from the book’s main protagonist, a wonderfully entertaining story is brought to life with plenty of moments for suspense, action, and intergalactic intrigue. This book is Oyebanji’s first novel and I already look forward to reading whatever may come next.\n\nSeptember 2023 Picks:\n\nPeggy recommends:\n\nHolly by Stephen King\n\nHolly is Holly Gibney, Bill Hodges’ well-loved partner from the Mr. Mercedes trilogy, and head PI in The Outsiders and If It Bleeds, is back investigating the sudden disappearance of Penny Dahl’s daughter. Though she should be taking bereavement time off, when she discovers there is a missing child as well, she can’t help but dive into the case full force. Holly is written in true King style and, while a little milder than usual, it is still a difficult read to put down.\n\nThe Diary of a Young Girl by Anne Frank\n\nWith Banned Books Week approaching, I selected this book as the ultimate in ridiculous reasons for being banned or challenged. Of course Anne Frank’s Diary of a Young Girl is sad. It’s the true two year history of a young teen living in fear and isolation. In it she expresses the emotions one would expect from such unfathomable living arrangements, the hopes and fears the whole family shares is such desperate times. I find it unbelievable that it was banned for young readers because it was “too sad”. What, are we raising our kids in padded rooms now? Protecting them from all forms of grief? Anne’s story is incredibly poignant but also crucial for every generation to know and understand. I feel it should be required reading for every 5th grader from here on out, lest we EVER, EVER forget the horrors millions of people had to endure.\n\nAugust 2023 Picks:\n\nJennifer recommends:\n\nHello Stranger by Katherine Center\n\nSadie Montgomery is a struggling artist, looking for her lucky break. Things seem to be going her way when she becomes a finalist in a portrait competition. But then Sadie wakes up in the hospital and finds out she needs to have surgery. As Sadie recovers, she realizes she can no longer see faces, a condition known as face blindness. Sadie is assured that the condition is temporary—but Sadie is a portrait artist, and she needs to submit a new portrait in six weeks. Luckily, Sadie can still see the face of her dog, Peanut. When Peanut gets sick, Sadie meets veterinarian Dr. Addison, and is surprised when he asks her on a date. Then there’s Joe, Sadie’s obnoxious neighbor who seems to know everyone in the building—and who becomes a friend to Sadie. With the help of her best friend, Sue, and neighbor Joe, Sadie learns how to see and paint her subjects differently.\n\nWhile Sadie’s first encounter with her neighbor, Joe, didn’t paint him in the best light, he ended up being my favorite character. Sadie’s evil stepsister (as Joe says, “They still make those?”) is so mean, and I really felt for Sadie every time she popped up. Katherine Center writes such sweet, thought-provoking contemporary romance novels. I highly recommend her books, and we have all of them in our system!\n\nJasmine recommends:\n\nEvery Day by David Levithan\n\nEvery day A wakes up in a new body, and spends a day in the life of a different person. A does their best to leave these lives unmarked, until one day they wake up in the body of Justin and falls in love with Justin’s girlfriend Rhiannon. A treats Rhiannon to a wonderful day, and wants to keep seeing her. They both have to decide if they can trust each other, and the story unfolds in a truly beautiful way. A wakes up as many different young people over the course of the book and they have great respect and caring for each of the lives they get a glimpse of. Its also interesting to follow Rhiannon struggle to reconcile this attraction they have for A’s personality while meeting them behind a new face every time. One of my favorite books I’ve ever read.\n\nKim recommends:\n\nThe Lost King DVD\n\nThe Lost King DVD (2022) is a fun, inspiring blend of history, mystery, comedy, and fantasy, based on the book The King’s Grave (which I haven’t read yet but plan to). An ordinary British woman becomes benignly obsessed with finding the burial place of Richard III, while imagining the dead king’s reactions. Along the way, she has to learn whom to trust, and how much, as people from around the country and then the world react to her quest.\n\nPeggy recommends:\n\nO Pioneers! by Willa Cather\n\nCelebrating the 110th anniversary of the publication of O Pioneers!, one of the original feminist novels to come out of early 20th century. O Pioneers! is a classic that exemplifies how perseverance, fortitude and spirituality are all necessary characteristics for survival. Based on the author’s Nebraska upbringing, the main character, Alexandra Bergson overcomes extreme hardships and life-altering tragedies while trying to make her frontier homestead a success. O Pioneers! is a classic peek into early Americana life and well worth the read all these years later.\n\nThe Dry (DVD)\n\nBased on the Jane Harper book by the same title, this is a great mystery that provides a beautiful Australian backdrop.\n\nFederal Agent Aaron Falk returns to his hometown to attend the funeral of his childhood friend, who has allegedly killed his family before taking his own life. His friend’s family begs Aaron to stay and investigate the deaths and he reluctantly agrees. As he investigates the current crimes, he is thrown back to the crime that caused him to flee his hometown 20 yrs prior. (I highly recommend you read the book, The Dry, first, and the follow up book, Force of Nature. In fact, I recommend ALL of Harper’s books!)\n\nI Swear: Politics is Messier Than My Minivan by Katie Porter\n\nKatie Porter is best known as the “whiteboard” Congressperson because her style of questioning , 99% of the time, includes visuals. Katie is a down-to-early Representative, one who works from paycheck to paycheck, is a single-mother and a domestic abuse survivor. As an “everyday” Congressperson, she knows the issues that are important to the everyday middle class constituents she represents. I listened to the audiobook, narrated by the author, and it was well worth the time spent. I learned a lot about Congress I didn’t know and experienced the insurrection through her eyes. I highly recommend this book.\n\nJohn recommends:\n\nWitches Abroad by Terry Pratchett\n\nI love Pratchett’s witch stories. They are a whole series unto themselves. The character development is excellent and the story is both amusing and holds the attention almost to distraction. Try it you’ll like it. And look for the other Pratchett witch stories too. ENJOY\n\nVicki recommends:\n\nAmie recommends:\n\nDrive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead by Olga Tokarczuk\n\nThough I knew from the beginning how this story was going to unfold, the writing was gorgeous and my sentiments and beliefs aligned perfectly with it.\n\nMeet Cute (DVD)\n\nNot your normal RomCom, but definitely worth it.\n\nJuly 2023 Picks:\n\nJasmine recommends:\n\nAll Our Hidden Gifts by Caroline O’Donoghue\n\nA strange old tarot deck that gives scarily accurate readings, an ex-best friend that disappears soon after her reading, and a creepy card that shouldn’t be in the deck at all but will not stay out… All Our Hidden gifts has a fantastic dark and witchy atmosphere, and a cast of fun and very real characters. And some good queer representation on top of all that, I’m sold!\n\nVicki recommends:\n\nNo Fuzzball! and the sequel No Snowball! by Isabella Kung\n\nBoth my daughter and I loved these very funny children’s picture books featuring a delusional cat who believes she rules over her humans under the name, “NoFuzzball.” They scream at her everywhere she goes, supposedly delighted by her antics of curtain shredding, dragging their things around and torturing the family dog. In “No Fuzzball!”, our empress is left alone and has to rethink her ways, and in “No Snowball!” she becomes guardian of a new subject in the queendom, whom she must train to follow in her footsteps. The front and back inside covers are full of expressive sketches which will be relatable to all subordinates of a royal feline.\n\nJennifer recommends:\n\nHappy Place by Emily Henry\n\nHarriet and Wyn have been the perfect couple of their friend group since college. They broke up six months ago. And they haven’t told their friends. This is the last year the group will be spending a summer week at their yearly Maine getaway beach house before the house is sold. Harriet and Wyn make a pact to keep their breakup a secret from their friends so they can have one final, happy summer vacation. But as the week goes on, Harriet and Wyn can’t help but notice how desperately they still want each other.\n\nHappy Place quickly became one of my Emily Henry favorites (my other favorite being Beach Read). The chapters are all told from Harriet’s perspective, but alternate between the present and her past happy places—with Wyn. While a wonderful romance, this story is so much more than that. Harriet not only repairs her relationship with Wyn, she becomes closer to her best friends as they all realize they were keeping secrets from each other. Despite being called Happy Place and having a cute summer-y cover, this book is gut-wrenching with painful memories and that will-they-won’t-they tension (but don’t worry…there IS a happy ending!).\n\nPeggy recommends:\n\nLone Women by Victor LaValle\n\nWhen we first see Adelaide, she has poured gasoline all over the family dwelling and is about to set it on fire with her family’s corpses tucked tight in bed.\n\nThe year is 1915. Adelaide will soon escape to the harsh beauty of Montana as one of the “lone” women acquiring a homestead from the federal government. If she can survive three years there, cultivating the land and making it habitable, the land will become hers.\n\nAs a single Black woman heading into the Badlands, Adelaide is aware of her vulnerability to racial and gender violence, but surprisingly, she’s more concerned with what’s inside the heavy steamer trunk that she drags with her to Montana.\n\nI learned a lot reading this book. First, I wasn’t aware women and minorities were allowed to homestead the land. I just assumed they needed a white male accompaniment to be viewed as legit contenders. So that part intrigued me. But, the story of Adelaide, as a person, and what happened to push her in such an unconventional direction kept me enraptured. It’s a unique story. Give it a try.\n\nOnly the Survivors by Megan Miranda\n\nTrue to form, Miranda gives us another thrilling mystery. High-schoolers set out on a field trip in two separate vans. For unknown reasons, they veer away from the planned route only to plunge off a damaged bridge into a raging river. Nine students survive by climbing up the cliff, away from the rising river waters. To take care of each other after such a traumatic event, they agree to gather each year at the anniversary to check in. At the ten year anniversary, the survivors are down to seven. When one of the seven disappears, the survivors struggle with their increasing anxiety and the fear that the secret of what really happened that night has put them in grave peril.\n\nThe author does not disappoint with this one. With flashbacks to the fateful night built in to the present anniversary gathering, Miranda’s story flows flawlessly to a satisfying climax.\n\nI highly recommend Only the Survivors.\n\nJune 2023 Picks:\n\nKim recommends:\n\nFirst Words with Cute Crochet Friends by Lauren Espy\n\nFirst Words with Cute Crochet Friend is an adorable board book with knitted objects and animals, from a watering can to an ice cream cone to a cow and a bunny. There’s no story, unless parents want to make one up for their toddlers, based on the two-page themes, like “Arctic Animals.”\n\nJennifer recommends:\n\nThe Messy Lives of Book People by Phaedra Patrick\n\nLiv Green works as a maid, barely scraping by to make ends meet to support her family. She loves to escape into a good book while daydreaming about becoming a writer herself. For the last three years, Liv has been working as a housekeeper for her hero, bestselling author Essie Starling. Years ago, Essie became a recluse, and Liv seems to be her only friend. When Essie passes away suddenly, Liv is surprised to learn that her dying wish was for Liv to complete her final novel—and she’s tasked to keep Essie’s death a secret. Liv must step into Essie’s shoes to write about her hero, Georgia Rory. As Liv writes, she uncovers secrets from the past that reveal a connection between the two women—one that will change Liv’s life forever.\n\nThere is a surprise twist at the end that reveals why Essie Starling chose her housekeeper and friend, Liv, to finish her novel, which I did not see coming. I enjoyed reading the “excerpts” from Essie’s/Liv’s book about heroine Georgia Rory throughout. Overall, a fun read.\n\nVicki recommends:\n\nLong Live the Tribe of Fatherless Girls by T Kira Madden\n\nThis memoir hit all the spots for me – livin’ through the 90’s, parents with substance abuse issues, coming out as queer, wild road trips, coastal Southern Florida (I could smell it through Madden’s funky descriptions), and total teenage dysfunction bordering on near destruction. Ah, the nostalgia – fun times! A lot of reviewers apparently think these themes are “too intense,” but this is my jam. Madden is an heir to the Madden shoe dynasty (yes, the iconic platforms of the 90’s and 00’s) on her dad’s side, and Native Hawaiian and Chinese on her mother’s side. She’s incredibly privileged, but neglected and parentified by her mom and dad, and also a witness to their shared domestic violence and out of control drug use. Still, she loves them with a fierce loyalty while she tries to navigate an almost entirely white world as a biracial person and multiple generations of family secrets on both sides that keep her from knowing her identity fully. I was crushed by the vulnerability of Madden’s teen self, and her insistence on survival even in the midst of the deep self-loathing only a forgotten, young girl can have. Madden’s writing is raw, sharp, honest, sad and often funny in spite of it all. I was rooting for her the whole time and couldn’t wait to read how she made it out to the gifted writer she is today. An incredible plot twist in the last chapter is a reminder that a family only needs one person to step up, break generational curses and send the healing back to the ancestors and on to the future generations. Bravo!\n\nPeggy recommends:\n\nBlackwater Falls by Ausma Zehanat Khan\n\nInvestigating the gruesome murder of a Muslim teen in a small town outside of Denver, Detective Inaya Rahman soon discovers there is more to this crime than first expected. The investigation unravels details of abhorrent behavior including, but not limited to, racism, police brutality, anti-immigrant sentiment, misogyny and extreme religious fanaticism.\n\nThis novel is not for the faint of heart (it is graphic) nor those who disagree politically. However, it is well written and thought provoking. Not for everyone but if you can, try it.\n\nMay 2023 Picks:\n\nJennifer recommends:\n\nThe Only Survivors by Megan Miranda\n\n10 years ago, two vans filled with high school seniors crashed into a ravine, claiming the lives of many classmates and two teachers. The nine students who escaped were changed forever. A year later, one of the survivors dies by suicide on the anniversary of the crash. The remaining survivors made a pact: to come together each year to keep each other safe—or to hold each other accountable. Cassidy tries to distance herself from everyone on the tenth anniversary, but on the day of the reunion, she receives a text with an obituary attached: another survivor is gone. With seven survivors left, Cassidy rushes to their meeting place, a house on the Outer Banks. But something feels off this year. Amaya, annual trip organizer, leaves without communication. With an impending storm, the survivors are faced with closed roads and surging waters…again.\n\nThis is another chilling, suspenseful mystery/thriller from Miranda. The book kept me engaged until the end, on the edge of my seat, and surprised by the ending. I did not see the final twist coming. Cassidy is the main narrator, telling the story in the present (the novel flips to other survivors’ perspectives in the past, unfolding the event of the initial tragedy), and she has her own secrets, keeping the reader in the dark until the final few pages.\n\nPeggy recommends:\n\nWhat Lies in the Woods by Kate Alice Marshall\n\nThree young girls spend their summer days roaming the nearby woods playing The Goddess Game. Then one day, one of the girls is attacked and nearly dies. Based on the three girl’s testimony, a serial killer is put away for life. But the girls were lying. Twenty-two years later one of the girls wants to confess what really happened, knowing full well the confession could do great harm to their adult lives, and not everyone wants the truth to come out.\n\nWhat Lies in the Woods is a labyrinth of secrets and lies, winding the reader through the creepy woods of childhood games and imaginations. This story is a great thriller that’s hard to put down.\n\nBeaujolais in My Blood by Eric Pitsenbarger\n\nEric Pitsenbarger tells a heartfelt personal story of growing up in his parents’ French restaurant, Cafe Beaujolais in Mendocino. Against the backdrop of immense cultural shift in the late-1960s, in the unique setting of wild, coastal Mendocino, here is a poignant telling of what it was like for a closeted gay kid working and living in a family-run French restaurant. A humorous and gritty.\n\nApril 2023 Picks:\n\nVicki recommends:\n\nApril is Sexual Assault Awareness Month, and with current statistics showing that every 68 seconds, an American is sexually assaulted; it’s a huge problem and we need to bring more awareness and action to the issue (https://www.rainn.org/statistics/scope-problem). Drawing Power: Women’s Stories of Sexual Violence, Harassment and and Survival is a graphic compilation of illustrated stories and vignettes by women from all walks of life that bring awareness, discussion, accountability and sometimes healing to this all-too common experience. Some of the comics have triumphant endings, and some leave the reader adrift, not knowing what the conclusion, if any, there will be. The style of illustration is as varied and eclectic as the women artists themselves, and every page has something of interest. It’s a hard subject, but if you are looking to educate yourself as an ally, or find comfort in knowing you’re not alone as a survivor – I recommend this book. Locally, if you need to talk to someone about experiencing a sexual assault, no matter when it happened, Project Sanctuary’s crisis line is available 24/7 at 707-964-4357. In addition, RAINN (Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network) has a national 24/7 crisis line at 1-800-656-HOPE (4673).\n\nJennifer recommends:\n\nThe Epic Story of Every Living Thing by Deb Caletti\n\nHarper Proulx has unanswered questions about her anonymous sperm donor father. She believes that without knowing him, she can’t know herself. When an Instagram post connects Harper to a half sibling, she begins to uncover her father’s identity. Harper joins her new half siblings, Dario, Wyatt, and Simone on a summer trip to Hawaii to meet their father. This half siblings meet Beau, a charismatic deep-sea diver obsessed with solving the mystery of a sunken shipwreck off the Hawaiian coast, and his mother, Greer. Meeting her half siblings and Beau forces Harper out of her comfort zone and helps her confront her anxiety brought on by the pandemic. But Harper also has more questions than ever: Who is she? Is she her DNA, her experiences, her successes, her failures? Who is she in dark times? Who might she become after them?\n\nCaletti beautifully explores the concept of family—all kinds of family—in this young adult novel. The beginning of each chapter features excerpts from letters and journal entries of Mary Ann Brown Patten, the first female commander of an American Merchant vessel when her husband became ill, and her story grows as Harper’s does. This is a wonderful coming-of-age story which I highly recommend!\n\nJohn recommends:\n\nThis book is a real page turner and has all of the Stephanie Plum requirements of destroyed cars, Grandma Mazur, Lulla’s fashion sense, and Morelli’s dog Bob. The only thing I missed was the 1953 Buick. I especially enjoyed Stephanie’s ability to deal with Bella, Morelli’s grandmother. Read and enjoy\n\nMarch 2023 Picks:\n\nVicki recommends:\n\nIf you are a new mom, or even an old mom, and wonder what happened to the part of you that is also an artist, then you need to read this book and feel the inspiration, solidarity and realness in these pages. I wish someone had given this to me eight years ago and spared me some of the existential crisis that comes with becoming a mom and entering a world of extremes from the greatest heart-bursting joy of seeing your child experience life to the most mind-numbing drudgery of domestic duty. This collection of essays from artist moms of all types – writers, performers, photographers, visual artists – explores how we can keep up our practice and what that looks like with children, why we must, and what the heck happened to us!? This book was published in 2004, and there are references to many pop culture moments of the near past (especially the 90’s, which as an x-ennial is right up my alley), but even so, it is still fresh because somethings don’t change and being a mom scrawling a poem on a square of toilet paper in the bathroom while children try to beat down the door is one of them.\n\nKim recommends:\n\nWhen the Stars Go Dark by Paula McLain\n\nAnna Hart is a seasoned missing persons detective in San Francisco with far too much knowledge of the darkest side of human nature. When tragedy strikes her personal life, Anna, desperate and numb, flees to the Northern California village of Mendocino to grieve. She lived there as a child with her beloved foster parents, and now she believes it might be the only place left for her. Yet the day she arrives, she learns that a local teenage girl has gone missing.\n\nThis semi-autobiographical novel is both familiar and chilling. Paula McLain takes us on a visual journey through Mendocino as seen through the eyes of someone who knows and loves it well. You’ll enjoy solving this mystery set in your own stomping grounds.\n\nThe Light we Carry by Michelle Obama\n\nMs. Obama shares stories about the importance of giving and how it enriches the life of the giver as much as the receiver. She offers guidance and tools for adapting to change in difficult times and developing habits that help us adjust and grow in times of change. Whether you liked her as First Lady or not, this book is truly inspirational.\n\nI encourage listening on audio, too, as her voice lends authenticity to the narrative.\n\nJennifer recommends:\n\nGeorgie, All Along by Kate Clayborn\n\nGeorgie Mulcahy leaves her hectic job in LA and moves back to her hometown. As a personal assistant, Georgie always put others before herself. She takes this move as an opportunity to find out what she wants. While going through high school memorabilia with her best friend, Georgie find a “friendfic” diary she wrote as a teenager—a sort of guidebook for how she wanted high school and her future to be. Georgie decides to use the dairy as a way to find her new path. She hits a snag with unexpected roommate Levi Fanning—onetime town troublemaker. But Levi is more than just his reputation, and the grouchy man offers to help Georgie with her quest. As the two make their way through the list, Georgie begins to realize that the answers she’s looking for may not be in the pages of the diary after all.\n\nTold from both Georgie’s and Levi’s perspectives, this is the sweet love story and finding yourself journey of two people who never felt they fit in…until they find each other. The supporting characters are great as well: Hank, Levi’s goofy dog; Bel, Georgie’s pregnant best friend; and Georgie’s flaky, but loveable parents.\n\nFebruary 2023 Picks\n\nAmie recommends:\n\nFuzz: When Nature Breaks the Law by Mary Roach\n\nI live north of town and happen to have a favorite bear named “Bear.” She is very polite and always demure, but this past spring, her extended family appeared, some 11 other bears. Though I was ecstatic, my neighbors were not. Fuzz is just one-step beyond my recent experiences and a good look into where my life might turn.\n\nThe Banshees of Inisherin DVD\n\nColin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson reunite with their writer/director buddy Martin McDonagh of In Bruges in this too-heartbreaking-to-be-hilarious tale of two best friends no longer being best friends. It is a beautiful, semi-haunting film that makes you think about friendships past and what makes life worth living.\n\nPeggy recommends:\n\nExiles by Jane Harper\n\nHarper brings back Investigator Aaron Falk in this new thriller where a mother disappears from a busy festival leaving behind her baby in the pram, tucked in alongside her possessions.\n\nA year later, as the young mother’s friends and family gather to welcome a new addition to the family, federal investigator, Falk, on a break from his own hectic work schedule, soon realizes this community is not as tight knit as they portray themselves to be.\n\nAs always, Harper weaves a dark, suspenseful web that hooks the reader in and grips on tight until the end.\n\nJennifer recommends:\n\nLunar Love by Lauren Kung Jessen\n\nOlivia (Liv) Huang Christenson is nervous and excited to be taking over her grandmother’s matchmaking business, Lunar Love. When Liv learns about a new dating app, ZodiaCupid, that has made her Pó Po’s traditional Chinese zodiac approach more about “animal attraction,” she’s furious. Especially when she learns the creator of the app is Bennett O’Brien, the cute guy she met at the local bakery. Liv knows better than to fall for a handsome guy who believes traditions are meant to be broken, let alone one whose Zodiac sign is incompatible with hers. As their businesses go head to head, Liv and Bennett make a deal: they’ll find a match for each other—and whoever falls in love loses. But will the guy who is adept at stealing business ideas also steal Liv’s heart?\n\nThe banter between Liv and Bennett is entertaining and humorous. Jessen did a wonderful job seamlessly weaving in Chinese traditions, customs, beliefs, and the Chinese Zodiac with the sweeping love story of Liv and Bennett. Bonus: the back of the book includes some recipes and more information about the Chinese Zodiac!\n\nJanuary 2023 Picks\n\nKim recommends:\n\nAfter the Snowfall by Rich Lo\n\nAfter the Snowfall is a stunning yet peaceful picture book, with a simple yet satisfying story. A fox walks home on a winter night, observing but not disturbing the other animals. The creatures look realistic but huggable, even the moose, while the leafless trees run the color spectrum, in watercolors. And of course the black sky and white snow provide strong contrasts to this all. As for the story, the ending is both surprising and sweet.\n\nRecommended for ages 3 to 9, as well as adults who appreciate lovely children’s book illustrations.\n\nPeggy recommends:\n\nDeath in Shetland Waters by Marsali Taylor\n\nMarsali Taylor and her Shetland Sailing Mysteries were highly recommended by author Ann Cleeves so, when I started researching this series for the library, I landed on the book author’s website. I was instantly intrigued when Ms. Taylor described her experience doing active research aboard one of the Norwegian tall ships thusly “I’m afraid my presence called out the worst instincts of crew and trainees alike; even our dignified Captain Sture came up to me and murmured, ‘If I was going to hide a body on board …’”\n\nNow, come on, who wouldn’t want to read about murder on a tall ship where everyone is stuck onboard? And, I’ll tell you what…it does not disappoint. Give it a try and let me know what you think.\n\nLessons in Chemistry by Bonnie Garmus\n\nI didn’t want to read this because it sounded like it was going to be lame. Then, one of our regular patrons came in and told me it was her new favorite, one she couldn’t put down once she started it. I said, “dang! I guess I need to try it.” But I didn’t. I let it go. Didn’t trust her judgement. Then, one of my favorite musicians recommended it on her social media page. And I said “dang! Now I really need to read it.” And I’m so glad I did! It is different, it is refreshing, and it is delightful. My new favorite character, Elizabeth Zott, is a 1960s chemist turned TV cooking show host. Elizabeth teaches women, not only how to cook, but how to stand up for their right to be more than just wives and mothers, and, in so doing, teaches them to change the status quo. I loved Lessons in Chemistry! I hope you will, too.\n\nJennifer recommends:\n\nThe Santa Suit by Mary Kay Andrews\n\nNewly divorced Ivy Perkins buys an old farmhouse sight unseen, looking for a change in her life. With the help of Ezra, Ivy’s realtor, Ivy begins to renovate the farmhouse. The previous family left so much junk and furniture, that Ivy needs all the help she can get. At the top of a closet, Ivy and Ezra find an old Santa suit—beautifully crafted and decades old. In the pocket of the suit is a note written by a child; a little girl who has one Christmas wish: for her father to return home from the war. The letter spurs Ivy on a mission. Who wrote the note? Did the little girl’s father ever come home? Ivy’s quest helps her venture out into her new community at a time when she just wanted to stay home and wallow. But, Ivy finds more than she bargained for: a welcoming town, new friends, and a second chance at love.\n\nThis is a sweet Christmas novella by Mary Kay Andrews about the miracles of Christmas and second chances. This book reminds me of feel-good Hallmark movies. So cozy up with this short read if you’re still yearning for the magic of Christmas.\n\nJohn recommends:\n\nGreetings: This romantic comedy showed a man with few social skills and very little emotion or empathy. But he did manage to change enough to …well I won’t be a spoiler. This one was humorous in a kind way and really held my attention. I think it will engage you too! Enjoy.\n\nDecember 2022 Picks\n\nKim recommends:\n\nThe Paper Museum is set in a future where paper is both rare and worthless. However, 12-year-old Lydia is fascinated by books and everything connected to them. Her family runs the town’s museum of paper and she is doing a project where she searches in the museum’s library for bookmarks. Soon, she has a new and more important project: solving the mystery of her parents’ disappearance.\n\nThis book, aimed at ages eight to twelve, offers a fascinating world, both quaint and dystopic, with a brave, clever heroine, who makes many mistakes (in her sleuthing and in her friendships) but learns from them.\n\nJennifer recommends:\n\nNotes of a Crocodile by Qiu Miaojin (available in eBook form)\n\nOK, this book isn’t for everyone. But if it’s for you – it’s going to be really, really for you. Lazi is a young Taiwanese lesbian student, pining for an older (but not by much) woman and trying to muddle through her last years at University and figure out life as a young adult. The book is divided up into “Notebooks,” which are diary entries focused on scenes of Lazi and her rag-tag bunch of queer friends interspersed with a running satirical gag about crocodiles which have invaded Taiwan but are wearing human suits in order to blend in with society. Author Qui Miaojin died very young, and only left a few books behind. I learned later she was a student of Helene Cixous and studied with her in Paris. If you are a fan of Cixous, post-modern feminism, dramatic queer youth yearning, absolutely beautiful prose, and chapters that end with a joke, this book is for you. Also, somebody made a playlist of all the tracks mentioned in the book – allow me: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl32QKhy3M8HZf_vYRhEZAJt4LsxTcBcH\n\nNovember 2022 Picks\n\nJohn recommends:\n\nThis book is a pleasant eulogy of a fictional character that has many similarities to Pay it Forward. Very positive and well-organized, it is a pleasure to read. Enjoy.\n\nPeggy recommends:\n\nConsent (For Kids!): boundaries, respect and being in charge of you by Rachel Bryan\n\nThis graphic novel is geared towards kids 6-13, but I enjoyed it very much while reading to my seven-year-old. The drawings are simple stick figures, but they are expressive and the comic book style and hilarious word bubbles make the text engaging. For parents looking for a way to talk to your child about body boundaries without getting into a discussion about sex, this book is for you. And it’s so important!! Prevention is the key to ending child abuse, family violence, and bullying, and it starts with each of us. If you are struggling with how to convey healthy relationships with the youth in your life, let this light-hearted book be a tool in your kit. And for those of us grown-ups who didn’t have someone to teach us when we were little, this book is a great tutorial on how to navigate relationships while taking care of your own needs and reflecting on how we treat others.\n\nKim recommends:\n\nJosie & the Pussycats (DVD—Available as part of a 4 movie collection)\n\nJosie & the Pussycats (2001) is a clever, fun, brightly colored satire of late ’90s/early ’00s pop music trends, with the comic-book band brought to life by Rachel Leigh Cook, Rosario Dawson, and Tara Reid. Parker Posey and Alan Cumming steal their scenes as the scheming villains. And the opening scenes with “Du Jour” (the boy band of the day) are hilarious even as stand-alones. The music is very catchy, too.\n\nOctober 2022 Picks\n\nJennifer recommends:\n\nThe Bodyguard by Katherine Center\n\nHannah Brooks is an Executive Protection Agent (aka “bodyguard”). After the death of her mother, and dumped by her boyfriend—and coworker—the day after her mother’s funeral, Hannah wants to get away. She hopes to land the new promotion assignment in London, but her boss has other ideas. Instead, Hannah is assigned to protect Jack Stapleton, the famous actor. When Jack’s mom gets sick, he returns home to the family’s Texas ranch to help out. One catch: he doesn’t want his family knowing about his stalker. Jack is skeptical about Hannah at first—can this woman who looks more like a kindergarten teacher protect him?—but she soon sets him straight in an amusing display of her skills. So Hannah—against her will and her better judgment—finds herself pretending to be Jack’s girlfriend as a cover. What could go wrong?\n\nKatherine Center’s books are always automatic reads for me, and this one did not disappoint! There’s the witty banter, the often-amusing thoughts of Hannah, and of course swoon-worthy Jack and his lovable family. But it’s not all rom-com; the book also explores more serious subjects. This book was a lighter read with substance, and pure fun.\n\nAmie recommends:\n\nFairy Tale by Stephen King\n\nCharlie Reade hears his super grumpy neighbor’s vicious dog barking and realizes something is wrong so he climbs the fence and eventually ends up in The Other world that he’s inherited from said grumpy-turned-friendly neighbor to save the life of the vicious-turned-lovebug dog. How do you like that?!? I liked it. The dog is wonderful! But aren’t they all? Not scary, not gruesome, kinda in line with Mr. King’s Eye of the Dragon.\n\nUnbearable Weight of Massive Talent (DVD)\n\nNicolas Cage plays Nicolas Cage. Epic. And Pedro Pascal (my boyfriend) is hysterical!\n\nVicki recommends:\n\nCalifornia Dreamin’: Cass Elliot Before the Mamas and the Papas by Penelope Bagieu (available as an eBook)\n\nI found this book searching through one of my favorite book databases: A Mighty Girl https://www.amightygirl.com/ under the biographies section. This graphic novel tells the story of Cass Elliot, starting with her childhood as Ellen Naomi Cohen, the daughter of the owners of the “only Jewish delicatessen in Baltimore.” Elliot’s childhood and adolescence were fraught with economic insecurity and the death of her beloved father, but the flamboyant personality, star-power and pure, phenomenal vocal talent was also solidified early on. Bagieu’s drawings, all in sweeping, inky, black and white, capture Cass in her full glory – I loved seeing her depicted as dynamic, goofy, sensual, sexy and beautiful, with great facial expression as she navigates countless rejections due to her size, with humor and self-respect. Bagieu also does a great job of humanizing Cass, rendering her relatable through each chapter told through a different character, and highlighting her triumphs and troubles. We all want to be loved, accepted, recognized for our gifts and given our flowers, and Cass embodies these messy, human desires. Despite fellow bandmember John Phillip’s multiple attempts otherwise, there is simply no Mamas and the Papas without Mama Cass. Bagieu shows us the tenacity that Cass possessed in order to bring us some of the most beautiful vocal harmonies and catchy jams of 20th century rock and roll. This is a great book for lovers of 60’s music and those who want to see a fat, multi-dimensional heroine celebrated with love through the graphic novel.\n\nPeggy recommends:\n\nInk Black Heart by Robert Galbreath (aka JK Rowling)\n\nThis one was a difficult read. Not because of its content but it’s a book that’s as thick as my head and HEAVY. Oh my goodness, is it big.\n\nHowever, true to style, Strike and Robin are up to their necks in shifty characters, romance and murder, finding themselves deeply entrenched in cybercrime intrigue. Although JK has taken heat for her transphobia (and, yes, the book does include mention of that), she can still spin a yarn that keeps you enthralled. Give it a try, but be careful. If you fall asleep in bed reading it, it may give you a concussion.\n\nThe Rising Tide by Ann Cleeves\n\nEvery 5 years, for 50 years, a group of friends have been meeting on Holy Island on retreat where they reminisce and catch up with each other’s lives. Tragedy hit at the second reunion when one of the friends died while trying to leave the island before the tides came in. Each member of the group holds their own regrets and secrets about what happened that fateful night, but no one is talking until another of their group is found dead.\n\nRising Tide is DI Vera Stanhope at her detecting best. It’s gritty and raw with a surprise ending.\n\nI loves me some Vera! I hope you will, too.\n\nJohn recommends:\n\nEncore Provence by Peter Mayle\n\nThis is a book by an author who really loved France and France loved him. In his lifetime, he was given numerous awards for service to France. Encore Provence is a largely culinary and oenology based travel book. I liked it because, not only did it describe delicious meals that made me hungry, but it also has a lot of humor. I especially like the story of the woman who was talked into a getting a reverse mortgage. If you like Peter Mayle, you’ll love this one.\n\nSeptember 2022 Picks\n\nSeptember is Library Card Sign-up Month and WE recommend you get yourself a library card asap and check out one of our favorites!\n\nPeggy recommends:\n\nCrazy Joy: Finding Wild Happiness in a World That’s Upside Down by Mary Katherine Backstrom\n\nThis isn’t your classic self-help book. Mary Kate takes us humorously along through the difficulties of life to get us to see the joy that lies within the chaos. “The beauty of joy isn’t found in a garden. It doesn’t grow in neat little rows. It’s found in the crevices, the cracks, and the chaos. “\n\nBy the time you finish the book, you feel like you have a better vision of the joy you’ve experienced in your own chaotic life’s journey.\n\nThe It Girl by Ruth Ware\n\nThe It Girl is a well-written, gripping, action packed dark academia thriller. It has everything you want from that kind of story – a close group of friends that is not immune to jealousy, stalking, cheating, and scandals. Perfect for any late night thriller cravings. Or even a beach read, if you must.\n\nVicki recommends:\n\nThe Great Mrs. Elias by Barbara Chase-Riboud\n\nThis book is a triumph of historical fiction about a subject often overlooked. Mrs. Hannah Elias lived during the turn of the 20th century and rose to prominence as one of the richest Black women in the United States at the time. Elias survived trauma, poverty, abandonment, institutionalization and prison to reinvent herself as a successful sexworker, madame and businesswoman who eventually stashed millions in over 100 accounts. The murder of a prominent lover leads the police and the press to her home, where her true identity is revealed to much public scorn. This book combines mystery, incredibly detailed history of New York City in the early 1900s, and social commentary about race, womanhood and making money. Chase-Riboud is a visual artist who has authored six additional historical fiction novels about women who do not often get their due in traditional history books. I look forward to reading more!\n\nJennifer recommends:\n\nDaughter of the Deep by Rick Riordan\n\nAna Dakkar is a freshman at Harding-Pencroft, a five-year high school in which the best marine scientists, navigators, and underwater explorers in the world graduate. While the freshman class heads to a ship for their final exam, Ana and her schoolmates witness a terrible tragedy, which will change their lives forever. The professor accompanying the class informs the students that Harding-Pencroft has been fighting a cold war with their rival school, Land Institute, for a hundred and fifty years, involving advanced sea technology. Ana learns that she is the descendant of the famous Captain Nemo, the Captain Nemo from Jules Verne’s 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea—and that she is their only hope. While you won’t find Greek, Roman, or Egyptian gods, goddesses, or demigods here, this story definitely has Riordan’s sense of humor!\n\nAugust 2022 Picks"
