        "text": "Dr. Hodges and Boone\n\nDr. David Hodges lived in Wellington, Texas, during high school. Dr. Hodges grew up with family pets, worked with livestock, and loved science, making veterinary medicine a natural choice for his vocation. He earned his Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine from Texas A& M University in 1978, after completing a Bachelor of Science in Animal Science at Texas Tech University in 1975. While in high school, Dr. Hodges met his future wife, Jan, whom he married in 1977. They have three sons that graduated from Texas A&M; M. Preston, the oldest, graduated in 2008 with a TAMU Construction Science degree. He also earned his healthcare engineering certifications post-college through the American Society for Healthcare Engineering. Currently, he is the Vice President for the Southern Region of McCarthy Building Companies in Houston, TX. Preston married Natalie Pappas on October 23, 2020, and are expecting the first Hodges grandson, Hayden, in August 2022. Twin sons, Austin and Patrick, graduated with TAMU Biomedical Science degrees in 2010 with a GPA of 4.0 and graduated number one and two in their class of 105 from Baylor College of Dentistry in 2014. They finished their third year of orthodontic residency at TAMU Baylor College of Dentistry in Dallas, TX, and moved back to Amarillo to practice orthodontics. They built a new orthodontic building, Hodges & Hodges Orthodontics, at 5212 Coulter Street, directly in front of Coulter Animal Hospital. Patrick is married to Kathryn, and they have two daughters named Kate, born May 17, 2019, and Hallie, born December 26, 2021. Austin married Lauren Britten on December 31, 2021. Lauren graduated from San Antonio Dental School in May 2022.\n\nDr. Hodges was an associate in a mixed practice in Anadarko, OK. in 1978-79, an equine practice in Canyon, TX. in 1979-1984, and built Coulter Animal Hospital in 1984. He enjoys snow skiing and gulf fishing and is an avid dove & quail hunter. He has a ranch in Aberdeen, Tx that he spends many weekends enjoying ranch life. His former favorite hunting companion, Boone, is with him in the picture above. In 2013, Dr. Hodges began two new sports. He started trying to play golf and plays on a team in the Amarillo Senior Softball Association. The Hodges family has five dogs.\n\nISABEL PENA\n\nIsabel has been with Coulter Animal Hospital since November 2021. Originally from Dallas, Isabel moved to the panhandle to study Biology/Pre-Veterinary Medicine. She graduated with her Bachelor’s in May of 2021 from West Texas A&M University and has plans to attend Veterinary School.\n\nHer favorite part about Coulter Animal Hospital is that she is part of a dedicated and hardworking team. Isabel is a beautiful addition to our team. Her positive attitude, patience, and smile make our work environment much more significant. When she’s not working at the vet clinic, she enjoys spending time with her boyfriend, family, friends, and her boxer, Delilah.\n\nAINSLEA PRICE\n\nAinslea has been with Coulter Animal Hospital since November 2020. She graduated with her Bachelor’s in Animal Science in May of 2022 and is now attending WT for her Masters’s in Animal Science and plans to pursue her Doctorate in Animal Science at OSU or Kansas State. Ainslea’s innovative mindset for the cattle industry is second to none, and she shows her passion for animal science every day at our clinic. Her goal is to study genetics with a focus on carcass merit traits of beef cattle breeds.\n\nHer favorite part about Coulter Animal Hospital are the friendships she has built. Ainslea is a team player and always goes the extra mile to make sure her tasks are complete and patients are well cared for.\n\nIn her free time, she enjoys reading and spending time with her friends, boyfriend, and dogs. Together, her and her boyfriend have an Alaskan Malamute and a Catahoula mix.\n\nBONNIE TOMPKINS\n\nBonnie joined Coulter Animal Hospital in April 2020. She is originally from Plano and will graduate from West Texas A&M University in May of 2022 with a Bachelor’s in Animal Science. She will be attending Kansas State University in the fall, where she will be obtaining her Doctorate in Veterinary Medicine.\n\nBonnie’s favorite thing about Coulter Animal Hospital is the opportunity to learn something new every day. Before she was a veterinary technician, Bonnie was one of our kennel technicians. She is one of the best kennel technicians we have had. Her attention to detail, hard work, and animal care promoted her. Those values will carry her far beyond this clinic into her future career. When she’s not excelling in the clinic or making straight A’s in the classroom, Bonnie enjoys playing volleyball with friends and being outdoors. She is a proud “dog mom” to a rambunctious Husky named Carl.\n\nZAIRA FLORES\n\nZaira was born and raised in Mexico, which is why she is one of our fluent Spanish-speaking technicians! She moved to Perryton when she was 10. She obtained her biology associate’s degree in Perryton, where her love for teaching started! Shortly after, she became a vet tech for a mixed practice veterinarian until the late summer of 2020, when she moved to Amarillo and became a part of our team! Zaira compared the transition from her previous job to CAH to learning English again since we use a different system for small animals! Although the change was hard, Zaira enjoys learning something new every day! She also enjoys drawing blood, placing IV catheters, and participating in orthopedic surgery alongside Dr. Hodges. Zaira’s plans include settling down with her very kind and loving husband and starting a family. She also plans to go back to college and obtain a Bachelor’s degree!\n\nANGELA HERNANDEZ\n\nAngela joined Coulter Animal Hospital in early June of 2022; she was born and raised in Amarillo, Texas, and strives to become a Veterinarian. She plans to go to Amarillo College and move on to West Texas A&M once she graduates. She is one of our fluent Spanish-speaking technicians since she comes from a Mexican background. Angela loves to travel and visit new places; she hopes to see as many cities as possible. She goes to the gym or spends quality time with her pets in her free time. Her favorite part about the job is the opportunity to gain experience and open new doors, and working with cute dogs is a plus too!\n\nANGELA HERNANDEZ\n\nAngela joined Coulter Animal Hospital in early June of 2022; she was born and raised in Amarillo, Texas, and strives to become a Veterinarian.
