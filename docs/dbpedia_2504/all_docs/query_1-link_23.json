Jonah Jameson, who had published a story that exposed Carlyle's company as causing environmental damage, driving him out of business. After Spider-Man thwarts the H-Bombers' attack and rescues Jameson, Carlyle either escapes (in the next-gen version) or is defeated and arrested (in the PS2, PSP, and Wii versions).

The William Waring version of Challenger appeared during the Golden Age of Comic Books in issues published by Timely Comics.\n\nPublication history\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Challenger is a weapons master. He challenges opponents to fight using a weapon of their choice.[58] He travels the world and becomes an expert in 1,000 different weapons after underworld criminals kill his father.[59] His expertise includes chemistry, \"nerve control\", and piloting aircraft.[60] Comics historian Jim Steranko has called the Challenger's background \"one of the weakest stories ever told\".[59]\n\nThe Challenger first appears in Daring Mystery Comics #7 (April 1941) from Marvel Comics predecessor Timely Comics, debuting in a 2-page text story, \"The Valley of Time\", by writer Ray Gill, and in a 12-page comics story, \"Meet the Challenger\", by Mike Sekowsky and George Klein, under the pseudonym \"Nick Karlton\".[61][58] Following this issue, Daring Mystery Comics took a nine-month hiatus, and the Challenger was moved to Mystic Comics.[62]\n\nIn Mystic Comics, the Challenger appeared from October 1941 to August 1942 in issues #6–10. His stories were eight to nine pages and were illustrated by several artists, including Al Bare and Sekowsky. Stan Lee wrote \"Horror Mansion\", Mystic Comics #9, in May 1942.[63]\n\nThe Challenger was not chosen to appear with his Timely compatriots in the 1976 Golden Age nostalgia team, the Liberty Legion. Legion creator Roy Thomas considered including the Challenger in the new team but decided against it, stating that his \"gimmick\" of challenging villiains to fight him with a particular weapon was not conducive to a group, rather than solo, story.[64]\n\nThe Challenger was not featured again until March 2005, when he appeared in She-Hulk #11, having \"bounced forward\" in time. In 2008, the Challenger was called into service during the Fifty State Initiative to lead the Freedom Force, Montana's state superteam.[65] The demon version of Challenger first appears in Ghost Rider Volume 2, #17 and was created by Tony Isabella and Frank Robbins. The Elder of the Universe version of Challenger first appears in The Avengers #678 and was created by Mark Waid, Al Ewing, Jim Zub, and Pepe Larraz.\n\nCharacter biography\n\n[edit]\n\nWilliam Waring\n\n[edit]\n\nFormer law student William \"Bill\" Waring, having traveled around the world to learn skills needed to avenge his father's murder for turning state's evidence over to the district attorney, dons a green costume with a full face mask to become the World War II superhero the Challenger. Through unexplained circumstances, the Challenger \"bounced forward\" in time to the present day, finding himself without assets, having been presumed dead, and inquiring of the law firm Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway about reversing his will. The firm puts him in contact with the superhero Captain America, who had found himself in the future due to suspended animation, for advice and assistance.[66] He later becomes part of the federal government's Fifty State Initiative of superhero teams, joining the Montana group, Freedom Force.[67][68]\n\nDemon version\n\n[edit]\n\nThe demon version of the Challenger works as an agent of Mephisto, who sends him to drag Ghost Rider to Hell. The Challenger appears when Ghost Rider and Daimon Hellstrom are exorcising Legion from the body of Katy Milner, and challenges the Ghost Rider to a deadly race for the fate of Katy. He defeats Ghost Rider, but is hit by Ghost Rider's hellfire attack, causing the spell over Katy to be broken and revealing that she is the cursed form of Roxanne Simpson.[69]\n\nPeter Parker\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Spider-Man\n\nWhen the Avengers and the New Avengers are displaced to the World War II-era and collaborate with the Invaders, Peter Parker sports a green costume and takes up the alias of the Challenger when fighting Red Skull and the Nazis.[70]\n\nElders of the Universe\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Elders of the Universe version of the Challenger challenges the Grandmaster upon his return from the void following the recreation of the Multiverse at the end of the \"Secret Wars\" storyline.[71] With Earth as the battleground, the Challenger reassembles the Black Order, resurrecting Black Dwarf, Corvus Glaive, Proxima Midnight, and Supergiant as a psychic projection. The Challenger pits them against the Grandmaster's incarnation of the Lethal Legion.[72][73] During the final round, the Challenger calls upon the resurrected Hulk, who destroys the Pyramoid in Voyager's possession at the Avengers Auxiliary Headquarters.[74] The Challenger apparently disintegrates the Grandmaster and makes plans to destroy Earth under the alias of Grandmaster Prime. He fights off Falcon, Hulk, Rogue, and Wonder Man until Voyager arrives with an army of Avengers and defeats him. Voyager then takes the Challenger back to the Far Shore and shackles him so that he can watch the Avengers and hopefully reform his ways; Challenger agrees to watch the Avengers until he is able to break free.[75]\n\nPowers and abilities\n\n[edit]\n\nThe William Waring version of Challenger is a master of weapons, jiu-jitsu, chemistry, and swordsmanship. He is also a skilled marksman, boxer, and pilot. Through Indian nerve-control training, the Challenger can make himself immune to pain at will. The Elder of the Universe version of Challenger possesses the Primordial Power, which gives him super-strength, enhanced durability, immortality, energy manipulation, and the ability to resurrect the dead.\n\nChamber\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Chamber (comics)\n\nChameleon\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Chameleon (comics)\n\nChampion of the Universe\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Champion of the Universe\n\nChance\n\n[edit]\n\nChance is the name of two unrelated characters in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.\n\nNicholas Powell\n\n[edit]\n\nComics character\n\nChancePublication informationPublisherMarvel ComicsFirst appearanceWeb of Spider-Man #15 (June 1986)Created byDavid Michelinie\n\nMike HarrisIn-story informationAlter egoNicholas PowellSpeciesHumanAbilitiesArmored suit grants:\n\nFlight via ankle jets\n\nWrist-mounted blasters\n\nScanning devices via cybernetic helmet\n\nNicholas Powell, a wealthy, former professional gambler, decides to become a mercenary criminal-for-hire, known as Chance.

Each one was chosen based on their personalities and their ability to respond to commands to nuzzle, be held, \"face\", and \"jerk\".[102]\n\nIn Captain Marvel, Goose is revealed to have belonged to Mar-Vell, who was posing as an Earth scientist named Wendy Lawson. In 1995, when the amnesiac Carol Danvers and Nick Fury are investigating Lawson, Goose finds them and begins to follow them. She accompanies them on their Quadjet to Louisiana, where they visit Maria Rambeau and her daughter, Monica, at their house so that Danvers can remember her past. There, the Skrull, Talos, finds them and identifies Goose as a Flerken. Goose remains present when Talos has a parley with Danvers and Fury. Goose accompanies Danvers, Rambeau, Fury, and Talos into space to a spaceship carrying Skrull refugees. While there, Goose reveals her true nature by using her abilities to defeat Kree soldiers and swallow the Tesseract.

He decided to use his powers for good, but was too embarrassed to showcase the chipmunk aspects of his powers, instead focusing solely on his enhanced strength and agility, and going by the name Handsome Puncher. When he enrolled at Empire State University and met Doreen Green, the Squirrel Girl, he was inspired to finally embrace his chipmunk side and changed his name to Chipmunk Hunk.[116] Upon first meeting, Tomas and Doreen seem to become fast friends. Doreen's new friend, Nancy Whitehead, even managed to coax Tomas' full name out for Doreen when she realized that she had a crush on him.[117] Afterwards, Tomas, along with his friend Ken Shiga, Koi Boi, arrived to aid Doreen in battling Hippo. Nancy got all of them to reveal their identities to one another and their bond became stronger. Later, they worked together to battle Ratatoskr with the help of Thor and Jane Foster who was Mighty Thor at the time.[118]\n\nTomas and Ken continued to support and aid Doreen in their superheroic activities,[119] during which Tomas started dating someone, news which initially caused Doreen to act weird around him. When Doreen learned that he was dating Mary Mahjan, a girl she had previously befriended, Doreen no longer felt weird and accepted Tomas as a platonic friend.[120] He later helped Doreen battle Melissa Morbeck and her army of mind-controlled animals.[121] Tomas and Ken would later become close friends with Brain Drain after they worked together to defeat the Octopals, a gang of criminals inspired by Doctor Octopus, and a gang of thieves dressed as familiar heroes and villains.[122] Tomas, along with Ken, Mary, Nancy, and Brain Drain formed a small group of friends that supported Doreen in numerous adventures involving the likes of Mojo II, Kraven the Hunter, and a Skrull named Gillian.[123][124] He also helped her out during her final battle with Morbeck after she leaked Doreen's identity to the public.[125]\n\nChipmunk Hunk in other media\n\n[edit]\n\nChipmunk Hunk appears in Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2.\n\nAmadeus Cho\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Amadeus Cho\n\nCh'od\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Ch'od\n\nChoir\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Choir is a member of the UK superhero team The Union, representing Wales.[126]\n\nChondu the Mystic\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Chondu the Mystic\n\nAndrew Chord\n\n[edit]\n\nComics character\n\nAndrew ChordPublication informationPublisherMarvel ComicsFirst appearanceThor #411 (Dec. 1989)Created byTom Defalco (writer) and Ron Frenz (artist)In-story informationAlter egoAndrew ChordTeam affiliationsNew Warriors\n\nUnited States Army\n\nAndrew Chord is a character in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.

His unit, known as the \"Half Fulls\", deploy to the Bolaven Plateau north of the Se Kong river in Cambodia, where they scout locations for an airfield. The unit comprises six soldiers, including Night Thrasher's father Daryl Taylor, Diego Cassaes a.k.a. the Left Hand, and the fathers of the members of the Folding Circle, encounter the Temple of the Dragon's Breath, where a seemingly English-speaking Cambodian geriatric named Tai restrains them via magic. Tai tells the soldiers of the history of her people and asks the soldiers to mate with six young women in her cult. The soldiers are led to believe that their children will one day rule the world. Five of the soldiers agree, including Chord; Daryl Taylor refuses because he is married.\n\nChord is married off to Tai's only daughter, Miyami, who he brings home to America. Miyami gives birth to their biracial children: Silhouette and Aaron (Midnight's Fire). Miyami fakes her and her children's death in a car crash to avoid their being used as Tai's pawns. She leaves her children to be raised in Manhattan's Chinatown and disappears. Chord, believing his wife and children are dead, becomes a mercenary and travels the world. He meets Cable, a time traveler, who also works as a mercenary.\n\nChord eventually returns to the Dragon Breath's temple in Cambodia, where Tai instructs him to resume his friendship with Taylor and his wife Melody. Chord becomes godfather to their infant son, Dwayne Taylor. Tai later demands that Chord kill Daryl and Melody to fulfill his role in the pact. Chord reluctantly does so, shooting his friends in a crowded restaurant in front of six-year-old Dwayne; Tai then erases Dwayne's memory of the event.[127]\n\nChord and Tai train Dwayne to fight crime to avenge the murders of his parents, never revealing their role in the incident. They also use the Taylor Foundation, a charitable organization that Dwayne inherited from his father, to invest in illegal operations. Dwayne becomes friends with fellow crime fighters Silhouette and Midnight's Fire.[128] Tai and Chord, who do not know that Chord is their father, disapprove of Dwayne's friendship with them and his romance with Silhouette. The partnership between Dwayne and the siblings ends when Silhouette is shot and seriously injured by a Korean gang member during a failed undercover operation.\n\nDwayne becomes Night Thrasher on Tai and Chord's urging, and assembles a young team of superheroes named the New Warriors.[129] Tai secretly intends to sacrifice the New Warriors to the well of the Dragon's Breath cult in place of the members of the Folding Circle – the children from the matings of the soldiers and the female cult members – and absorb their powers. Meanwhile, Chord accompanies the New Warriors to Brazil to investigate Project: Earth. He battles Force of Nature alongside them,[130] and works with them when team up with X-Force, revealing that he knew the X-Force leader Cable from his days as a mercenary in Vietnam.[131] In a related story, Chord is one of the many heroes to become stuck inside the mind of Piecemeal when the entity attempted to convert the world into a mathematical construct. The X-Factor team talks Piecemeal out of his plan.[132]\n\nNight Thrasher eventually uncovers Chord's misuse of Taylor Foundation funds and confronts him. Chord tricks the other New Warriors into thinking that Dwayne is being controlled by an outside force, but his deception is uncovered. Chord shoots himself in the head rather than revealing the truth. Marvel Boy rushes a dying Chord to the hospital,[133] where Chord admits to killing Night Thrasher's parents. Miyami also comes to visit,[134] and Tai reveals to Silhouette that she is Chord's daughter.[135] Tai then murders Miyami when she discovered her deception about the car crash. Tai partially heals Chord using her magic.[136] Chord recovers for several months. Tai is later killed by Night Thrasher when she attempts to sacrifice the New Warriors and the Folding Circle.[137]\n\nSoon afterwards, Chord hires the Poison Memories to stage his kidnapping and frames other corrupt members of the Taylor Foundation board, with the hope that Dwayne would investigate and intervene in the company's dealings. After undergoing lifesaving surgery, Chord reconciles with Night Thrasher and Silhouette.[138] Chord is later named legal guardian of Elvin Haliday a.k.a. the New Warrior Rage, after Haliday's grandmother is killed by the Poison Memories.[139]\n\nChord and his former mercenary buddy Sprocket later help Dwayne uncover the truth about his father's illegitimate son Donyell. When the New Warriors are sent to various points in time by the Sphinx, Chord and Sprocket help Hindsight Lad recruit a new team of Warriors to battle the Sphinx.[140] Since then, Chord has not yet reappeared in the comics, and after Night Thrasher's death and the Civil War,[141] Donyell Taylor has assumed control of the Taylor Foundation.[142]\n\nPowers and abilities\n\n[edit]\n\nChord is an athletic man, but has no superhuman powers. He knows hand-to-hand combatant, and has combat training and military experience. He is a good marksman with conventional firearms. Chord also designed the Night Thrasher's original battle-suit.

Delphine Courtney first appears in Alpha Flight #7 (February 1984) and was created by John Byrne. The character subsequently appears in Alpha Flight #11–13 (June–August 1984), Alpha Flight #22 (May 1985), and Alpha Flight #25–28 (August–November 1985). Delphine Courtney also appears as part of the \"Omega Flight\" entry in The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition #9.\n\nCharacter biography\n\n[edit]\n\nDelphine Courtney is a servitor robot, built by the Roxxon Energy Corporation to serve Jerry Jaxon. Courtney initially has a fully feminine human appearance, and is referred to by she/her pronouns by her creators.[230] On Jaxon's behalf, Courtney recruits several superhumans that were former members of Gamma Flight and Beta Flight, the Canadian government's training teams, who were dismissed after the government closed Department H.[231] She recruits them so that Jaxon can form a personal super-team, Omega Flight, and take revenge on James Hudson a.k.a. Guardian, the founder of Department H and leader of the still-active Alpha Flight. Courtney manipulates the recruits into seeking their own revenge on Alpha through an \"influencer\" device built into her systems.[232] Courtney is unable to influence Roger Bochs, the inventor of the Box robot, who remains loyal to Hudson and the Flight program, forcing Jaxon to directly involve himself by taking control of Box.[230]\n\nLuring James and Heather Hudson to America with an offer of employment at Roxxon in New York City, Jaxon and Omega Flight ambush James while Heather is detained by Courtney. During an attempted escape, Heather damages Courtney's flesh-like facial covering, revealing that she is a robot. Although Omega Flight seemingly enacts revenge by apparently killing James, Courtney witnesses Jaxon's death from feedback caused by Box's destruction;[230] Omega's remaining members are turned over to the police.[233]\n\nEscaping capture, Courtney frees Omega Flight from jail and employs the group in a new plot against Alpha Flight. Courtney's appearance is reconfigured to incorporate facsimiles of Guardian's battle-suit technology and infiltrates Alpha Flight posing as Guardian. Courtney lures the group into a second encounter with Omega Flight.[234] Beyonder defeats Omega Flight,[235] forcing Courtney and the team to flee. Their escape is blocked by Madison Jeffries, a former Flight trainee whom Courtney had not recruited because of his ability to control machines and his loyalty to James. Jeffries attacks using a construct created from an automobile, and Courtney uses one of the future duplicates of Omega Flight member Flashback as a human shield, resulting in Courtney's death and the mental breakdown of the original Flashback.[236] Bochs and Jeffries later salvage portions of Courtney's second incarnation to construct a new battle-suit functionally identical to James's original,[237] which is used by Heather as the Vindicator.[238]\n\nPowers and abilities\n\n[edit]\n\nDelphine Courtney possesses superhuman strength and has a high degree of resistance to physical damage. Courtney has better sight and hearing than a human being's, and possesses an \"influencer\" that can affect pre-existing psychological conditions in the human mind, allowing Courtney to manipulate individuals. Courtney could masquerade as either gender by altering its underlying structure and could also impersonate specific individuals. While impersonating James Hudson, Courtney also uses technology that can replicate the properties of his battle suits.\n\nJune Convington\n\n[edit]\n\nComics character\n\nJune CovingtonPublication informationPublisherMarvel ComicsFirst appearanceOsborn #1 (2011)Created byKelly Sue DeConnick\n\nEmma RiosIn-story informationAlter egoTheresa June CovingtonSpeciesHuman mutateTeam affiliationsDark AvengersNotable aliasesToxie Doxie, Scarlet WitchAbilitiesAntiseptic breath\n\nBones that soften to diffuse impact\n\nGlands that distribute megadoses of Relaxin\n\nDeliver neurotoxin via her razor sharp fingernails\n\nJune Covington a.k.a.
