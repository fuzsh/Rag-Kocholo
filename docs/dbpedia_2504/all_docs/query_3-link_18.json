        "text": "Our Romney sheep\n\nWe are building a Romney flock that has recessive color, breeding for a range of variants of the agouti gene that provide fleece for wool ranging in color from white, predominantly beige or grey, to dark brown. Some of the sheep have striking patterns of white in a dark wool background.\n\nCurrently we have a permanent flock of about 20 sheep, 15 of which are pure-bred registered Romneys. We have three registered Romney rams used in our breeding program.\n\nIn 2024 six registered Romney ewes were bred, resulting in seven ram lambs and six ewe lambs. Six of these are white, with the others having a range of colors, but predominantly light blue agouti.\n\nUses of our sheep\n\nEach year we sell some of our sheep and lambs for their meat directly or via a livestock auction.\n\nThe predominant value of our sheep, however, is their fleeces. We send some fleeces to mills to be made into rovings or batting, which we use in felting projects. Some of the rovings are spun into yarn.\n\nAn important use of the fleeces has become to purify lanolin from them. The purified lanolin is used in body care products made at the monastery: lotions, balms and body butter creams."
