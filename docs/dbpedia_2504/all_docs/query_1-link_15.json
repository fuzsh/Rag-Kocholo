A boater noticed A.H. to be having difficulty swimming. By the time the boater reached A.H. he had gone under the water's surface. The boater was able to grab A.H. and pull him into the boat. A.H. was taken to a guarded beach where the lifeguards performed CPR, but were unable to revive him. A.H. was medivaced by helicopter and was pronounced dead at the hospital. A.H.'s wife was on the beach and witnessed the incident. Autopsy to be performed.\n\nJune 8, 1987\n\n87-95 - Gulf Islands - Drowning\n\nLocation: unknown\n\nAt approximately 6:00pm on 6/7, park rangers received a report of 2 overdue swimmers. A search was initiated. At approximately 11:00pm two bodies were found. Details on the incident are few. The investigation is being turned over to the local sheriff's office.\n\nSeptember 24, 1987\n\n87-234 - Gulf Islands - Motor Vehicle Accident: Fatality\n\nLocation: US Hiway 98 near Gulf Breeze\n\nMr. J.W.B. was driving his 1987 Corvette at a high rate of speed when he lost control of his vehicle, became airborne and wrapped around a telephone pole. He was dead on arrival.\n\nMay 9, 1988\n\n88-77 - Gulf Islands - Fatality\n\nLocation: Perdido Key\n\nOne-year-old J.S. was left unattended and strapped in a stroller for about 5 minutes while her parents collected seashells. Her father reportedly looked back, noticed she was no longer in the stroller and found her floating in the surf. He grabbed the child, ran to the road and flagged a ranger. CPR was administered and the child was transported to the hospital where 2 hours of efforts failed to revive her. The child's stroller was about 30 feet from the surf, with crawl marks leading from it to the surf line. Escambia County Sheriff's Department is investigating.\n\nJune 7, 1988\n\n88-97 - Gulf Islands - Drug Arrests\n\nLocation: Fort Pickens Campground\n\nOn Monday, park rangers and Santa Rosa County Sheriffs arrested W.B.R. and L.G.R. just outside the park boundary on nine outstanding warrants. They had been camping with L.G.R.'s mother for most of the previous week at Fort Pickens campground, and were in the process of leaving in three vehicles when they were stopped. A search of the mother's vehicle led to the discovery of a suitcase containing 125.5 grams of cocaine, a small amount of marijuana, scales and other drug paraphenalia. W.B.R. had $3,100 in cash in his possession, and there were also pictures of L.G.R. standing in a marijuana field of unknown location. The Restuchers were arrested, and the mother was released. L.G.R. is being held without bond; W.B.R. is being held on a $100,000 bond. State prosecutors are trying to get federal charges placed against these persons, as there is evidence of dealing drugs on park property.\n\nJune 14, 1988\n\n88-101 - Gulf Islands - Drowning\n\nLocation: Santa Rosa Island\n\nA park visitor observed B.M.K., 7, of Satsuma, Alabama, struggling in rough surf at an unguarded beach within the park. An NPS lifeguard at the guarded beach 1/4 mile away was notified and responded with rangers. At one point a park visitor attempting to rescue B.M.K. had him in hand only to have him knocked away by the surf. Search efforts are continuing today but are being hampered by extremely rough surf.\n\nFriday, February 10, 1989\n\n89-17 - Gulf Islands - Suicide\n\nThe body of a 26-year-old Springfield, Missouri, man was found on the afternoon of the 8th at Naval Live Oaks picnic area. The apparent cause of death was a self-inflicted gunshot wound. A weapon was found near his body along with a suicide note and a cassette tape in which he explained why he'd taken his own life. The park, FBI and Florida Department of Law Enforcement are investigating. (Carl Christensen, CR, GUIS, via SERO).\n\nThursday, February 16, 1989\n\n89-21 - Gulf Islands - Search/Drowning\n\nAt 6 p.m. on February 13th, three young men were declared missing by authorities in Pensacola Beach, Florida. At 6:30 a.m. on the following morning, a park maintenance man found R.H., 11, wandering along the road near Naval Live Oaks visitor center. The boy said that he and two friends had left Pensacola Beach in a canoe with the objective of crossing Santa Rosa Sound, and capsized on the way. A search was begun by park rangers, and the body of T.L.A., age 9 or 10, was soon found near Naval Live Oaks. Another boy, J.M., age 8, was missing, and had not yet been found at the time of the report (4 p.m. on the 14th). Park rangers, local authorities and the Florida Marine Patrol are still searching for the missing boy.

The motorcyclist, 19-year-old E.R. of Gulf Breeze, Florida, was thrown from his bike and received a severe head injury. He was placed on life support systems, but died on the afternoon of the 13th. (Carl Christensen, CR, GUTS, via Bill Sturgeon, FAD/SERO).\n\nFriday, June 9, 1989\n\n89-123 - Gulf Islands - Building Destruction and Employee Injury\n\nAt 9:30 yesterday morning, a tornado completely destroyed the Fort Pickens entrance station at Gulf Islands. Seasonal ranger Amanda Rhodes, 26, who was in the building at the time, was taken to the hospital and treated for shock, bruises, cuts and a possible broken wrist. The contents of the entrance station were scattered over the surrounding area; although the safe remained attached to the entrance station's concrete base, the cash register could not be found. Rhodes' car was also demolished by the tornado. Because of the severe weather, which began early in the morning and continued all day, the park offered shelter in the batteries at Fort Pickens to visitors who were staying in the nearby campground. (Jerry Eubanks, superintendent, GUIS, via telephone report from RAD/SERO).\n\nWednesday, June 14, 1989\n\n89-128 - Gulf Islands - Drowning\n\nOn the afternoon of the 10th, J.M., 55, of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, was swimming off Santa Rosa Island when he was pulled underwater in heavy surf. Although he was recovered within five minutes, efforts to revive him proved unsuccessful. Just before the incident, life guards had been warning visitors - including J.M. - of hazardous surf conditions. (Carl Christensen, CR, GUIS, via CompuServe report from RAD/SERO).\n\nTuesday, March 13, 1990\n\n90-30 - Gulf Islands (Florida) - Fatality\n\nOn the evening of March 10th, two park visitors found the body of 26-year- old D.S. of Perry, Georgia, two miles west of the Santa Rosa day use facility. D.S. had died from a gunshot wound which was apparently self-inflicted. A revolver was found by his body. The incident is still under investigation. (Carl Christensen, CR, GUIS, via CompuServe report from Capt. Steve Alscher, RAD/SERO, 11 a.m. EST, 3/12/90).\n\nTuesday, May 29, 1990\n\n99-109 - Gulf Islands (Mississippi/Florida) - National Park Service Ranger Killed in Line of Duty\n\nOn Saturday morning, May 26th, Gulf Islands National Seashore Ranger Robert L. McGhee, Jr. 50, was killed while making a traffic stop on a park road. His assailants - D.A.B., 29, and J.F.W., 27, both escapees from the Holmes Correctional Institution near Bonifay, Florida - fled the scene, but were subsequently shot and arrested by a police officer in nearby Ocean Springs, Mississippi. The incident began on Thursday, when D.A.B. and J.F.W. escaped from prison while out on a doctor's visit. Early the next morning, the pair kidnapped M.B., 55, from an Alabama hotel, where she was working as a night clerk. The two men then brought M.B. to a motel in Ocean Springs, where they checked in on Friday afternoon. Around 9 a.m. on Saturday morning, M.B. was able to escape from her abductors and call police from the motel office. Meanwhile, D.A.B. and J.F.W. fled into the park in their stolen pickup truck, where McGhee stopped them for a traffic violation. According to the convicts, McGhee was approaching their vehicle when one of them shot him with a stolen .38 revolver, hitting him three times in the throat and chest. The elapsed time between D.A.B.'s phone call to Ocean Springs police and the incident is estimated as no more than five minutes. After the incident, D.A.B. and J.F.W. drove back into Ocean Springs, where a police officer spotted and pursued them. At some point in the chase, the driver of the pickup rammed the police car. The pair then got out and approached the officer, who shot them both in the legs. The escapees were captured in the woods next to the park shortly thereafter and arrested. While the chase was going on, Ranger Everett Whitehead, who lived nearby in the park, went out to investigate shots which he'd heard and found McGhee's body. He was pronounced dead by a local coroner at 9:13 a.m. Since the park has proprietary jurisdiction in the area where McGhee was killed, D.A.B. and J.F.W. may be tried in either state or federal court. D.A.B. was serving a 20-year sentence for crimes including sexual battery, kidnapping and robbery; J.F.W. was serving 15 years for crimes including burglary, cocaine possession, battery on a law enforcement officer and a previous escape. The FBI will participate in the investigation, which will probably be led by Ocean Springs. McGhee was a Vietnam veteran who came to work for the seashore as a YACC program supervisor in 1975 after retiring from the Navy. He became a law enforcement ranger in 1981. He leaves his wife, Linda, two grown children and several grandchildren.\n\nA funeral will be held tomorrow at 1 p.m. at the Bradford-O'Keefe Funeral Heme on Porter Avenue in Ocean Springs. SERQ is asking that each park in Southeast Region send a ranger to the funeral, and that at least one ranger from each region be present. The uniform will be Class A summer dress. Questions about the funeral should be directed to SER Chief Ranger Bill Springer at FTS 841-3527 or 404-331-3527. (Reports from Bill Springer, RAD/SERO, 6:00 a.m. EDT, 5/29/90 and the Associated Press, 9 p.m. EDT, 5/26/90).\n\nWednesday, May 30, 1990\n\n99-109 - Gulf Islands (Mississippi/Florida) - Follow-up on National Park Service Ranger Killed in Line of Duty\n\nThe funeral for Ranger Robert McGhee will be held today at 1 p.m. at the Bradford-O'Keefe Funeral Home on Porter Avenue in Ocean Springs, Mississippi. Rangers and NPS representatives from throughout SERO and from all regions and WASO will be attending. The uniform will be Class A summer dress. Questions about the funeral should be directed to the Ranger Activities Division in SERO at FTS 841-3527 or 404-331-3527.

Box 1490, Falls Church, VA 22041.\n\nThursday, May 31, 1990\n\n99-109 - Gulf Islands (Mississippi/Florida) - Follow-up on National Park Service Ranger Killed in Line of Duty\n\nOver 70 rangers and upwards of 200 officers from 35 to 50 law enforcement organizations - including representatives from virtually all Federal law enforcement agencies - attended the funeral for Robert MoGhee yesterday in Ocean Springs, Mississippi. He was later interred in that city. A moment of silence in his memory was observed at the time of the funeral throughout the Department of Interior in Washington and by the 200 attendees at a training session of the D.C. Chapter of the FBI National Academy Associates.\n\nPlease remember that cards may be sent to his wife, Linda, at 2700 English Drive, Ocean Springs, Mississippi 39564, and that donations may be made in his name to the Employee and Alumni Association, P.O.

Although the exact sequence and nature of the events that took place is not yet known, it appears at present that this is what happened: After their kidnapping victim escaped and called Ocean Springs police just before 9 a.m., the two suspects, J.W. and D.B., fled into the park in their stolen pickup truck. In so doing, they apparently ran a stop sign, and were pulled over by McGhee, who was not aware that the two men were fugitives. McGhee then approached the driver and asked for his license. At that point, one of the two suspects brought up a revolver from concealment and immediately began firing. It is probable that no time elapsed between the moment when McGhee first saw the weapon and the moment when the shooting began. Six rounds were fired; three of them hit McGhee. After shooting him, the two assailants immediately left the scene. An Ocean Springs officer soon spotted them and pulled in behind the truck, which stopped at a stop sign, then backed up and rammed the cruiser. As D.B. and J.W. came out of the truck and approached the cruiser, the officer fired through the windshield and hit J.W. in the leg. A foot chase ensued. During the apprehension, D.B. was also shot in the leg. No more than ten minutes elapsed between the time the woman called the police department and the time the cruiser was rammed. Ocean Springs is conducting the investigation of the incident with the assistance of the FBI and the National Park Service. The U.S. attorney is discussing the prosecution of the case with Mississippi state attorneys. On May 30th, complaints were filed against both J.W. and D.B. in the state of Mississippi charging them with kidnapping and capital murder. Although the two will be prosecuted in state court, federal charges are also possible. (Telephone reports from Capt. Steve Alscher, RAD/SERO, and Det. Thomas Windham, Ocean Springs PD, 6/1).\n\nTuesday, August 7, 1990\n\n90-239 - Gulf Islands (Mississippi/Florida) - Homicide\n\nCampers on Santa Rosa Island discovered the body of a female whose throat had been cut on the morning of August 4th. The victim was identified as B.D.R., 34, of Pensacola, Florida, and it was determined that she'd been killed within the previous 24 hours. An investigation was begun by Escambia County, the FBI and park rangers. The prime suspect was J.M.W., 28, also of Pensacola, who was B.D.R.'s boyfriend. On the night of the 4th, J.M.W was found in B.D.R.'s car, arrested and charged with homicide. (Telephone report from Capt. Steve Alscher, RAD/SERO, 8/6).\n\nFriday, August 31, 1990\n\n90-292 - Gulf Islands (Florida/Mississippi) - MVA with Fatality\n\nAt 1:30 a.m. on August 30th, A.W., 22, of Gulf Breeze, Florida, was driving eastbound on Fort Pickens road when her car left the roadway and rolled over several times in the dunes. She was medevaced by Life Flight to a Pensacola hospital, where she died during surgery. Rangers and Florida State Patrol officers are investigating the incident. (Gene Phillips, GUIS, via telefax from Capt. Steve Alscher, RAD/SERD, 8/30).\n\nTuesday, February 12, 1991\n\n90-109 - Gulf Islands (Mississippi/Florida) - Followup on McGhee Shooting\n\nOn February 8th, A.D.B., one of the two suspects in the May 26, 1990 murder of park ranger Bob McGhee, entered a plea of guilty in Mississippi state court to charges of capital murder, kidnapping and rape. As a condition of his guilty plea, the state agreed to a sentence of life imprisonment without parole in the state penitentiary. The other suspect, J.F.W., is scheduled to appear in court on the 25th. A.D.B. said in court that he had worked for McGhee while with the YCC, and that McGhee had recognized him at the time of the traffic stop. The plea in state court will not affect the prospect of possible capital murder prosecution in federal court. [CompuServe message from Gene Phillips, CR, GUIS, 2/11]\n\nTuesday, February 26, 1991\n\n91-60 - Gulf Islands (Mississippi/Florida) - Body Recovery\n\nA park maintenance worker discovered the body of a man on the beach near the Santa Rosa day-use facility west of Navarre Beach, Florida, on the afternoon of February 21st. The victim was later identified as R.S.L., 22, of Birmingham, Alabama. Investigation revealed that R.S.L. had been a member of a fishing party of two males and a female which had left Destin, Florida, on a fishing trip on January 31st. The trio had been in a 19-foot bass boat, and had headed out despite six to eight-foot seas and warnings that the trip would be too dangerous. The boat was found near the mouth of Mobile Bay on February 6th, and the body of the female was found the next day near the boat. The third member of the party is still missing. [CompuServe message from Gene Phillips, CR, GUIS, 2/22]\n\nWednesday, February 27, 1991\n\n90-109 - Gulf Islands (Mississippi/Florida) - Followup on McGhee Shooting\n\nOn February 26th, J.F.W., one of the two suspects in the murder of park ranger Bob McGhee, entered a plea of guilty in Mississippi state court to charges of murder and kidnapping as a habitual offender. As a condition of his guilty plea, the state agreed to a sentence of life imprisonment without parole in the state penitentiary on each charge. The other suspect, A.D.B., pled guilty to capital murder, kidnapping and rape on February 8th. He also received a sentence of life without parole. Neither J.F.W. nor A.D.B.'s state court pleas will have any bearing on their possible capital murder prosecution in federal court. [CompuServe message from Gene Phillips, CR, GUIS, 2/26]\n\nThursday, April 11, 1991\n\n90-239 - Gulf Islands (Mississippi/Florida) - Followup on Homicide\n\nOn the morning of August 4, 1990, campers on Santa Rosa Island discovered the body of B.D.R., 34, of Pensacola, Florida, just off a trail behind Battery Langdon. An investigation was begun by the Escambia County sheriff's office, the FBI and park rangers. The prime suspect was J.M.W., 28, also of Pensacola, who was B.D.R.'s boyfriend. J.M.W. was apprehended that night while attempting to cash a check issued to the victim; he was also driving B.D.R.'s car. He was charged with homicide. On Monday, April 8th, J.M.W. pleaded no contest to charges of armed robbery and second-degree murder and was sentenced to 25 years in prison on both counts, with terms to be served concurrently. [CompuServe message from Gene Phillips, CR, GUIS, 4/10]\n\nWednesday, April 17, 1991\n\n91-115 - Gulf Islands (Florida/Mississippi) - Shooting Incidents\n\nOn the afternoon of April 12th, two people were wounded one from a gunshot, the other from a cut during an incident involving students from at least four Mobile, Alabama, high schools who were participating in \"International Skip Day.\" About 1,000 students and older persons gathered at the beach area just outside the Fort Pickens entrance to the park by early afternoon. At about 2:30 p.m., the Escambia County sheriff's office received a report of gunfire at the location and responded. Gunshots were heard upon their arrival at the scene, and backup was requested from all available units. Rangers responded and helped control the crowd, many of whom were fleeing the area. Rangers also stopped all traffic leaving the park while the free-for-all was going on. The victims were taken to a local hospital, where they were treated and released. One 21yearold suspect was arrested and charged with aggravated assault, but the shooting suspect remained at large. A crowd of about 1,500 people gathered at the parking lot and beach area on the afternoon of the 14th, and fighting and gunfire again broke out. Even though the sheriff's department had assigned extra personnel to the area, backup was again requested and park rangers were the first to respond. One deputy was hit twice with bottles, and another was assaulted by a woman with a large stick. A ranger assisted the deputy in disarming the woman. Due to circumstances, the woman was not taken into custody, but a 17-year-old male was arrested and charged with possession of a stolen firearm, reckless display of a firearm, and carrying a concealed firearm. Witnesses state that the fighting was among groups of friends who were polarized by the shooting death of a student at a high school football game. [CompuServe message from Gene Phillips, CR, GUIS, 4/16]\n\nTuesday, July 16, 1991\n\n91-292 - Gulf Islands (Florida/Mississippi) - Significant Auto Burglary\n\nSometime between 3:30 and 5:30 p.m. on the afternoon of the 11th, a thief or thieves broke into a 1991 Lincoln Continental which had been rented by J.C. of Paris, France, and stole nearly $12,000 in cash and personal property. J.C. and his fiancee parked the car in the Santa Rosa area while they went to the beach. When they returned to the vehicle, they discovered that the passenger window had been broken out and a travel bag had been taken. The bag, which was left on the passenger side in plain view, reportedly contained U.S. and French currency, a diamond engagement ring, an amethyst ring, and a video camera. The total value of the lost items was placed at $11,550. The couples also lost their driver's licenses, passports, credit cards and other items. There are no suspects at this time. Local enforcement agencies and banks have been notified. Rangers Daryl Rhodes and Thomas Howell are investigating.

U.S. Attorney George Phillips, who will be handling the case, is from the Southern District of Mississippi. [CompuServe message from Gene Phillips, CR, GUIS, 7/22]\n\nFriday, August 2, 1991\n\n91-362 - Gulf Islands (Florida/Mississippi) - Burglary Arrests\n\nOn the morning of July 9th, rangers discovered that the Johnson Beach Snack Shack, a concession store in Perdido Key in the Florida District, had been burglarized during the previous night and that about $3,200 worth of merchandise had been taken, including 37 cases of beer, 60 cartons of cigarettes, 55 cigarette lighters, 28 fourpacks of wine coolers, 10 snorkel and mask sets, 70 pairs of swim goggles, 30 large beach towels, 60 \"Gulf Island National Seashore\" tshirts, 36 tiedyed clothing items, 150 pairs ofsunglasses and a dozen cans of Off insect repellant. All merchandise was marked with standard stickon grocery labels. Also taken was a microwave oven, a power inflator and a box of vendor invoices for the previous threemonth period. Entry was apparently gained by cutting the locks on the outer steel security bar gates and then forcing open the inner wooden doors. On July 26th, local authorities received an anonymous telephone tip naming some juvenile suspects. Rangers and local deputies obtained a state search warrant on the residence of a local juvenile a few days later; on the 31st, rangers Will Reynolds and Nick Stavroplus joined deputies in executing the warrant. They found 21 of the Gulf Island tshirts, seven tie-dyed shirts and cans of Off in the house. The juvenile said that he was just storing the property for three other juveniles who delivered it to his secondstory bedroom via the rooftop and back window on the early hours of July 9th. His fee for storing the items was two cartons of cigarettes. The juvenile, who is 17 years old, has been certified as an adult, and also has grand theft auto charges pending against him. Warrants are outstanding for the other three juveniles, all of whom are also 17 years old.

The fire was in the front portion of the truck when first observed, but quickly spread throughout the body and completely destroyed the truck before it could be extinguished. The value of the GSA-owned truck has been placed at $9,725, but the value of the contents is undetermined. Arson is suspected. Rangers Jan Graham and John Hughes are working with county investigators and ATF agents on the case. No definite suspects have been identified, but rangers are checking out leads on juveniles who were staying in the Fort Pickens campground and possible connections with other vandalism which also occurred in the area.

Since there had been strong westerly rip currents over the weekend, law enforcement agencies to the west of the park were contacted by rangers. Officers at Orange Beach police department in Alabama, about six miles west, advised that a couple walking along a beach in their town had found the body of a man there early that morning. The victim was positively identified as J.S. later that day. Autopsy results indicate that he drowned, and that the drowning was the indirect result of J.S.'s bad heart. J.S.'s roommate said that he'd last seen him on Saturday morning when he left their trailer to go to the store.

The pilot refused to submit to an administrative judgement, so the FAA filed formal charges against him and the case went to trail in New Orleans on October 25th. Rangers Jill Kinney, Todd Clark and Andy Madden and lifeguard Pat Caviness were called as witnesses for the FAA. The administrative law judge decided the case in favor of the FAA and ordered a 120-day suspension of the defendant's pilot's license. The judge stated that the two main reasons for this finding were the rangers' ability to properly estimate the height of the aircraft and to determine the number of people who were under the flight path during the incident. Since the signing of an interagency agreement between the NPS and the FAA in 1984, Gulf Island rangers have been providing the local FAA office with detailed reports on low-flying aircraft incidents occurring over the park's four off-shore islands. The local office has acted administratively on every case submitted.

Ranger Skip Prange investigated and found a body lying in a clearing behind the battery's northeast bunker. The victim, later identified as 15-year-old L.R. of Pensacola, was fully clothed in insulated long underwear and jogging clothes; a large knife was found about a dozen feet from her body. The area was secured and the FBI and Escambia County sheriff's office were notified. Investigators determined that the cause of death was probably a blow to the head, even though there were deep stab wounds and lacerations on L.R.'s body. L.R. was last seen by family members at her grandparents' house on Sunday evening and had been reported missing to Pensacola police when she failed to return home. There are no likely suspects at this time, and it is not yet certain that the homicide occurred in the park.

L.V.R.'s body was found Christmas Eve behind Battery Langdon. S.P.E. has been charged with an open count of murder and will be tried in state court. Although S.P.E. has not made a statement, investigating officers believe that the murder occurred within the seashore at or near the point where the body was found.

Knight eventually observed the pair break into and remove items from a car; he then contacted ranger Larry Bova and gave him a detailed description of the suspects, their vehicle and their direction of travel. Rangers Bova and John Hughes stopped and arrested the men outside the park, then awaited the arrival of county deputies and the vehicle's owner. The suspects, who were both from the area, confessed to the burglary, but denied committing any others. Their mode of operation was similar to other breaks which have occurred in the area recently, though, and the investigation continues.

Although R.K.'s wife, family and many other visitors were on the beach, nobody saw or heard any struggling or calls for help. R.K. was in water that was not over his head. CPR was begun immediately by a nurse and EMS-qualified visitors, but they were unable to revive him. The coroner subsequently ruled that R.K. had drowned.

His fiancee tried to save him, but almost drowned herself when he kept pulling her under. She managed to make it to shore and yelled for help; other visitors in the area commandeered a surf board and went to his aid. It took the rescuers from 10 to 12 minutes to get J.V. to shore. Rangers also responded and began administering CPR. EMS personnel soon arrived and took over. J.V. was taken via Lifeflight helicopter to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Alcohol is suspected to have been a contributing factor. The drowning occurred about between a half and three-quarters of a mile from the guarded beach area. [Gene Phillips, CR, GUIS, 6/29]\n\nMonday, August 3, 1992\n\n91-670 - Gulf Islands (Florida/Mississippi) - Follow-up on Homicide\n\nOn July 24th, S.P.E., 18, was found guilty of the first degree murder of L.R., 15, at Fort Pickens last December. The jury returned the verdict after three hours of deliberation, and subsequently recommended that S.P.E. be sentenced to life with no chance of parole for 25 years. A hearing for further legal arguments on what sentence the judge should impose will be held in September. L.R., who was pregnant at the time she was murdered, was S.P.E.'s ex-girlfriend. S.P.E. had repeatedly assaulted her with a knife, machete and baseball bat; all three weapons were found at the scene near L.R.'s body. S.P.E. testified that he had thrown the bat away weeks before the murder and that he'd lost the machete in the Fort Pickens area sometime before the murder. A receipt for the knife was found in S.P.E.'s vehicle along with blood which matched L.R.'s. Other evidence found at the scene and S.P.E.'s home linked him to the homicide.

Preliminary damage reports have been received:\n\nMeanwhile, parks along the Gulf Coast are beginning to make preparations for the hurricane's arrival:\n\n* Gulf Islands - Petit Bois and Horn, the two islands which together comprise the park's Mississippi District, were closed and evacuated Monday afternoon. The islands are ten miles offshore and accessible only by boat. Equipment and boats have been moved to the mainland. The Florida District remains open since it is easier to evacuate. A decision on what course of action to take will be made today based on the hurricane's movements.\n\n[Bill Springer, RCR, RAD/SERO; Bob Belous, SUPT, JELA; Tom McDaniel, PAIS; Ron Switzer, SUPT, BITH, 8/24 and 8/25]\n\nThursday, August 27, 1992\n\n92-451 - Florida and Gulf Coast Areas - Follow-up on Hurricane Andrew\n\nInitial reports from Gulf Coast areas which were directly or indirectly affected by Hurricane Andrew indicate that the storm caused little significant damage:\n\n* Gulf Islands - As of late yesterday morning, islands in the Florida District were being lightly overwashed, but the park had not yet had an opportunity to check on islands in the Mississippi District because strong winds and rain precluded overflights. The area will be visited today. No significant damage is expected.\n\nDeputy Director Cables and SER Regional Director Coleman will be arriving in the area today to get a first-hand look at the damage and talk with park and all-risk management team personnel. The all-risk team has taken over recovery operations at Everglades and Biscayne. Park staffs and team members have developed four incident objectives, which, in priority order, are as follows: 1) assist employees both inside and outside the two parks; 2) get park facilities on-line, restore utilities and clean up the area; 3) develop a plan which will detail what will be needed to run the parks for the next year; and 4) develop a long-term recovery plan.\n\nBefore work can be begun to meet these objectives, however, all efforts will focus on getting enough resources on hand to support recovery operations. Many areas in the two parks lack electricity, phones, water, radios, fuel and food, and large orders will be made over the next day or two for equipment and supplies to fill these needs. Personnel will also be requested to augment park staff in the recovery process. Some supplies began arriving yesterday, including over two dozen generators, radios and a repeater kit from BIFC, and 40 cases of MREs (military rations). The law enforcement SET team has arrived and rangers have been deployed for around-the-clock protection of facilities at Biscayne, in Everglades' headquarters area, and elsewhere. Two incident dispatchers are now on scene, and a team of park medics is expected today.\n\nAs noted above, the top concern for the park and the all-risk team is the welfare of park employees. It's estimated that three-quarters of the approximately 230 employees at the two parks had major damage to their residences, and a substantial number of them lost almost everything they owned. The emotional impacts have been significant, and critical incident stress debriefing (CISD) teams are being requested to assist them. The park is working to identify these employees' immediate needs. A list of items will be compiled which we will carry in the morning report as soon as possible. We will also notify you if and when an account is established for monetary contributions. Please do not send either money or packages until procedures have been worked out for their acceptance. In the interim, however, you can send either general messages of support to the park staff or personal notes to employees via the park office in Everglades City. The mailing address: Everglades NP, PO Box 120, Everglades City, FL 33929. Such notes will be appreciated.\n\n[Darlene Koontz, EVER, Bill Gabbard, IC Team - EVER/BISC, Bonnie Winslow, RAD/SWRO, Steve Smith, RAD/SERO, and Butch Farabee, SUPT, PAIS, 8/26]\n\nFriday, August 28, 1992\n\n92-451 - Florida and Gulf Coast Areas - Follow-up on Hurricane Andrew\n\nReports have now been received from all Gulf Coast areas affected by the hurricane, and few have suffered any serious problems:\n\n* Gulf Islands - The park reports that some overwash occurred on the Mississippi District islands, that the mainland building and facilities for the district are okay, and that the Horn Island pier suffered extensive damage.\n\nOperations continue to be \"severely hampered\" by lack of phones and radios; at present, the ARM team and employees from all three parks are communicating over only one radio channel. The BIFC radio net should be up today, however, and a satellite dish telephone system which was set up yesterday should also be fully operational. Big Cypress has sent two 28-foot travel trailers to Pine Island. Catering and shower units have been ordered, and additional law enforcement personnel have been requested to provide security. There are more than two dozen law enforcement rangers in the park at present; they've been assigned to island and mainland facilities at Biscayne and to Flamingo and the main entrance at Everglades. Critical incident stress debriefing (CISD) teams were due in last night. An incident information officer has also arrived.\n\nMany NPS employees and friends of the Service have called to ask what they can do to help people in the park.\n\n- Personnel - Incident commander Rick Gale has expressly asked that the many people who've offered to help hold on until the basic groundwork for recovery operations has been laid. Although these efforts to help are very much appreciated, there is no infrastructure to support additional employees or volunteers, much less existing staff. Additional help will be summoned as soon as possible. Until that time, please stand by. - Financial Aid - SERO has set up a relief fund to receive monetary contributions for employees in Biscayne and Everglades. The regional director has asked ENP&MA to set up a reserve account to meet these employees' immediate needs. Eastern has set up an \"Andrew Relief\" fund and has already donated funds to it. Individual employee contributions and non-ENP&MA park donations may be sent to ENP&MA, Attention: George Minnucci, 446 North Lane, Conshohocken, PA 19428. ENP&MA parks that want to make a contribution from this year's percentage donation or an advance from next year's donation must notify George Minnucci by memo or fax (215-832-0242) of the year and amount. These funds will be made available to employees by wire transfer immediately upon receipt. Questions regarding these procedures should be directed to Pat Stanek in SERO (404-331-3527) or Richard Jamgochian at ENP&MA (215-832-0555).\n\n- Notes of Support - As noted yesterday, you can send either general messages of support to the park staff or personal notes to employees via the park office in Everglades City. The mailing address: Everglades NP, PO Box 120, Everglades City, FL 33929.\n\n- Goods and Supplies - We are working with the ARM team and park to identify supplies (clothing, equipment, etc.) which are needed by park employees.

His fellow divers immediately called for assistance from the Coast Guard and park rangers, and a search for R.L. was begun. He was found unconscious in about 15 feet of water and was brought to shore. Responding EMS personnel were unable to revive him. Rangers learned that this was R.L.'s first dive following the receipt of his diving certificate about two weeks ago. He was accompanied by his diving instructor and nephews at the time of the accident. The medical examiner's report indicates death by drowning.

He was able to locate her and pull her to shore. While a visitor called 911 on a car phone, a park maintenance worker and a lifeguard, who had responded from the guarded beach a mile and a half away, began CPR. J.G. was airlifted to a local hospital, where she died on September 3rd. Both J.G. and her husband were active-duty Air Force and stationed at Keesler AFB in Biloxi. She was a recreation specialist.

The judge cited two reasons for overruling the jury's recommendation - that the murder had been particularly heinous and cruel and that it had been premeditated in cold blood. Florida law calls for an automatic appeal in death penalty cases. [Gene Phillips, CR, GUIS, 9/10]\n\nThursday, March 4, 1993\n\n90-109 - Gulf Islands (Florida/Mississippi) - Update on M. Homicide\n\nOn November 3, 1992, a three judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit heard oral arguments on whether or not the death penalty may be imposed under certain federal first-degree murder statutes consistent with the Eight Amendment. The government contends that the murder of a federal law enforcement officer in the performance of his or her duties is punishable by death as set forth in 18 USC 1111 and 1114. U.S. District Judge Walter Gex had ruled in favor of defendants B. and W. on December 11, 1991 and granted their motion to strike the death penalty. The government's case was presented by Assistant to the Attorney General Andrew McBride with the help of Assistant U.S. Attorney Jay Golden of the Southern District of Mississippi. Superintendent Jerry Eubanks, Chief Ranger Gene Phillips, Mrs. M., and the M.'s daughter K. attended the hearings. A ruling was expected by January or February. On January 12th, the park was advised that the three judge panel had ruled in favor of defendants W. and B. and declined to overturn Gex's ruling. Early in February, information was received indicating that the acting Solicitor General in Washington might approve an appeal of the appellate court's decision to the Supreme Court, but the park was later advised that Justice had instead asked for a review of the three judge panel's opinion before the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Because a new Solicitor General has not been chosen and because of other key vacancies in the Justice Department, they felt that this was the best way to go. It may take from six months to a year for any further action or decisions on this case.

Earlier that day, their 18-foot boat had developed engine problems. Rangers Bill Wilson and Ben Moore had helped them get started again, and had radioed in a float plan to the Coast Guard as the foursome headed back to the mainland. During the trip back, the engine again stalled, this time in rougher seas, and the boat capsized and sank. J.L., 26, was rescued by the vessel \"Fiesta\" some 12 miles out in the Gulf of Mexico. The bodies of his brother, L.L. II, 29, and his in-laws, T.B., 30, and F.B., 53, were recovered from the Gulf. All four had put on their life jackets prior to the sinking and had floated for more than 14 hours in the chilly ocean waters. During that time, tides pulled them some five miles through the Mississippi Sound and another 12 miles into the Gulf, thereby complicating NPS and Coast Guard search efforts. [Gene Phillips, CR, GUIS, 4/12]\n\nThursday, May 6, 1993\n\n93-231 - Gulf Island (Mississippi/Florida) - Oil Spill\n\nPark personnel are preparing for several thousand gallons of oil to come ashore on Petit Bois Island, a designated wilderness area. Approximately 6,000 gallons of number six heating oil (Navy heavy) was released in Mississippi Sound around 1 a.m. on May 3rd when a barge operated by Hollywood Marine of Houston, Texas, was damaged in severe weather. Cleanup efforts are being coordinated by the company, and a company vice president, Steve Valerius, is serving as incident commander. Park personnel have been assisting with incident planning and oil movement monitoring. As many as six skimmers have been working throughout the sound, and several mainland areas have deployed containment booms. Unfortunately, the bulk of the oil has coagulated and sunk, leaving beach cleanup as the only viable alternative. It is hoped that the low toxicity of the oil will help keep wildlife impacts to a minimum. [GUIS, 5/5]\n\nFriday, May 21, 1993\n\n93-231 - Gulf Island (Mississippi/Florida) - Follow-up on Oil Spill\n\nRangers continue to help manage the cleanup of a 6,000-gallon oil spill which has severely impacted the park's offshore islands. On-water skimmers were used the first two days after the May 3rd spill to scoop up surface oil, but most of the heavy oil quickly sank beneath the surface and coagulated into tar balls. Both skirted and absorbent booms were deployed around sensitive inlets to protect lagoons and marsh habitat. During the out-going tides on the first two days following the spill, a large amount of the oil was swept out into the Gulf of Mexico. Tar balls began washing up on the south shore of Petit Bois Island on the third day; since then, tar balls ranging in size from dime to football size have washed up on the beaches of all the Mississippi District islands, some as far as 30 miles from the spill. Park employees are supervising the contracted cleanup crews which are picking up the tar balls. To date, work crews have cleaned over 20 miles of beaches and have picked up approximately 500 gallons of tar balls and oily marine debris. A reconnaissance of the islands yesterday indicated that most of the beaches are now relatively clean, except for Petit Bois. Cleanup efforts will probably be suspended following another cleanup of the island unless strong wave action washes in additional tar balls. Assessments and monitoring activities - as noted in Wednesday's resource management section - are continuing. [Gene Phillips, CR, GUIS, 5/20]\n\nTuesday, June 8, 1993\n\n93-332 - Gulf Island (Mississippi/Florida) - Memorial Day Incidents\n\nThe three-day Memorial Day holiday brought a large influx of gays to the Pensacola area. Although a stretch of beach within the park has been a popular holiday destination for gays since the 1960s, the high turnout was apparently in response to comments by the city's mayor and a city councilman, who had earlier said that they didn't want to see the community to be known as a gay resort. Local gay bars sponsored street parties and other activities that drew people from all over the country. Over the holiday, the section of beach traditionally used by gays was heavily utilized, with estimates of 24,800 visitors on Saturday, 24,600 on Sunday, and 18,300 on Monday. These figures reflect total visitation to the area, but a significant majority of visitors were gay. The biggest problem was traffic control. Parking is allowed along the shoulders on both sides of the road, and rangers had to keep traffic moving. Sometime on Friday night, roofing tacks were strewn along the road shoulders and road and caused an undetermined number of flats to visitor vehicles. There were six flats on park vehicles, and four rangers suffered puncture wounds from stepping on tacks. Tacks were also scattered along the road last year. Other problems included open container and controlled substance violations, some public nudity, a motor vehicle accident and two water rescues. [Gene Phillips, CR, GUIS, 6/4]\n\nWednesday, June 9, 1993\n\n93-341 - Gulf Island (Mississippi/Florida) - Special Event\n\nSome 900 to 1,000 boats and almost 5,000 people descended on Ship Island on June 6th to attend the second annual Mississippi Coast Boaters Rendezvous. The rendezvous was advertised as a family event with a priest blessing the recreational boating fleet. The event also featured a rock band, a hula- hoop contest, and men's and women's swimsuit contests. The crowd congregated within a narrow stretch of beach about two-thirds of a mile long. The 90 degree temperatures, congestion and ample consumption of alcohol contributed to a number of disturbances. Rangers and other officers responded to six fights, hundreds of incidents of underage drinking, almost 100 boating violations, one SAR, numerous incidents of marijuana possession and use, and a dozen minor and four serious medical problems. Another four boating accidents were reported as people returned to the mainland some four miles away. The Coast Guard, Mississippi Bureau of Marine Resources, and Harrison County deputies assisted in the event.

Similar packages containing cocaine had recently washed ashore along Alabama beaches to the east. The package was secured and held for U.S. Customs. Because of inclement weather, Customs was unable to get out to the island to retrieve it until the 24th. The contents tested positive for cocaine, and the packaging proved to be similar to others washing up on the coast from Alabama to Texas. Rangers are working with Customs to check the shorelines of all the Mississippi barrier islands and Perdido Key in Florida. The package weighed two kilos and had an estimated value between $120,000 and $140,000.

G.D.L., who reportedly was a poor swimmer, began having difficulty in the waves and current and called for help. His friend was unable to pull him from the water and had to go to shore to save himself. G.D.L. was underwater from ten to twenty minutes before being pulled into shore by other people in the area. CPR was started immediately. The incident occurred about a half to three-quarters of a mile east of a guarded beach; two park lifeguards and subdistrict ranger Alice Ruth responded when alerted around 4:30 p.m. and took over CPR. They were joined by Lifeflight EMS personnel, who were unable to revive G.D.L.. He was pronounced dead at 5 p.m. G.D.L. weighed about 280 pounds, had been drinking, and had reportedly eaten a large meal before swimming. [Gene Phillips, CR, GUIS, 7/5]\n\nMonday, August 2, 1993\n\n93-551 - Gulf Islands (Mississippi/Florida) - Drowning\n\nS.M., 66, was pulled from Gulf waters by park lifeguards at Johnson Beach on Perdido Key on the afternoon of July 26th. He was not breathing and had no pulse. Lifeguards had seen S.M. swimming strongly just moments before and it did not appear that he was having any difficulties, but they spotted him floating face down shortly thereafter. Although CPR was begun immediately and S.M. was medevaced by hospital minutes later, he was pronounced dead on arrival at Baptist Hospital in Pensacola. The surf was rough and yellow caution flags were out at the time of the incident. While this incident was going on, rangers received a report of another possible drowning a mile and a half further down the key on the sound side. They found an extremely intoxicated 29-year-old female who'd been pulled from the water and was breathing on her own. Because she'd taken in some salt water, she was taken to the hospital by the same ambulance that had responded to the first incident. She was held for observation, then released with no apparent problems. [Gene Phillips, CR, GUIS, 7/26]\n\nWednesday, August 4, 1993\n\n93-565 - Gulf Islands (Florida/Mississippi) - Drowning\n\nD.L., 19, of Birmingham, Alabama, drowned off Perdido Key around 4 p.m. on the afternoon of July 31st. D.L. and two friends had been on a sandbar about 50 yards offshore when waves and current swept them off it and they began yelling for help. Others in the area did not respond immediately because they thought the three were just playing around. Visitors eventually went to their help and summoned park lifeguards from the guarded beach about a quarter mile away. D.L.'s companions were found, but he could not be located. He was eventually spotted by a Lifeflight helicopter and pulled from the water. CPR was begun, but D.L. was pronounced dead on arrival at a local hospital at 5 p.m. [Gene Phillips, CR, GUIS, 8/2]\n\nFriday, September 3, 1993\n\n93-664 - Gulf Islands (Mississippi/Florida) - Drug Seizure\n\nOn August 28th, two park visitors walking along the beach in the vicinity of Fort Pickens found a package floating in the water. Because of its unusual wrappings, they brought it to the ranger station. The outer wrapping of the wet package, which weighed one kilo (2.2 pounds), was a clear tape which had been opened by one of the visitors. The next layer was a grey plastic/foil pouch that was completely sealed; inside was yet another layer of clear plastic wrap with the word \"Cartier\" on it. The contents tested positive for cocaine. There's good reason to believe that this package may be of the same origin as the one that turned up on Horn Island on June 21st. The beach was searched for other packages, but none were found. [Skip Prange, DR, GUIS, 8/30]\n\nTuesday, September 7, 1993\n\n90-109 - Gulf Islands (Florida/Mississippi) - Update on McGhee Homicide\n\nOn September 2nd, a jury in Tallahassee, Florida, found the Florida Department of Corrections liable in the murder of ranger Bob McGhee and awarded $2.2 million to Linda McGhee, Bob's wife. The department admitted negligence in allowing inmates W. and B. to escape while on a visit to the eye doctor, but argued that there was no way that the department could foresee that the pair would murder anyone. W. and B. were classified as closed custody prisoners - the highest security risk classification in the Florida prison system. They were not searched prior to leaving the prison and had in their possession a pair of barber's shears that had been stolen from the prison barber shop in early May, then separated and sharpened. The two also carried a map of their planned escape route and were wearing civilian clothes under their prison garb. [Gene Phillips, CR, GUIS, 9/3]\n\nFriday, January 21, 1994\n\n94-25 - Gulf Islands (Mississippi/Florida) - Assault; Robbery\n\nOn the afternoon of January 9th, 73-year-old H.F. of Pensacola was discovered lying on the south side of the Perdido Key Road with multiple lacerations and bruises about his head and neck. He was conscious but unable to remember what had happened to him; his wallet and keys were missing from his jacket pocket. Pieces of a vehicle were found in the area, but it was not clear whether they had any bearing on the incident. H.F. was life-flighted by helicopter to Pensacola, where he was admitted with multiple injuries. Perdido Key subdistrict ranger Alice Ruth began an investigation with assistance from the Escambia County sheriff's office and Florida highway patrol. H.F. was interviewed, but could not shed any more light on what had happened to him. Family members notified banks and credit card companies to cancel his cards. About $5,000 in purchases were made on one of the cards in Foley, Alabama, on January 10th, and Ruth was notified later that day that clerk in a convenience store in Fairhope, Alabama, had seized one of H.F.'s cards when a credit check revealed that it was stolen. The film from the store was obtained and stills were made. On January 15th, Gulf Shores officers advised that they had identified the two suspects and that Foley police department officers had obtained warrants on both for credit card fraud. The two suspects - two males, one 18 years old - are in custody, and their vehicle has been located and impounded. Two more suspects, one of them the alleged robber, are still being sought. Warrants for attempted murder and robbery have been sworn out in Escambia County. The suspects have told investigators that the attack was planned. They swerved over into the opposite lane, struck H.F. from behind with the vehicle, then robbed him. The FBI is also assisting on the case. [Gene Phillips, CR, GUIS, 1/18]\n\nTuesday, March 8, 1994\n\n94-103 - Gulf Islands (Mississippi/Florida) - Barge Sinkings/Groundings\n\nSometime during the night of March 1st, four coal barges broke free from their tow during rough weather on the intercoastal waterway north of Perdido Key and Santa Rosa Island. The barges were drawn out into the Gulf by currents through Pensacola Pass, then separated; two went east and two went west, and all four eventually sank or went aground off-shore near either Fort Pickens or Perdido Key. Two broke up. On March 4th, small amounts of coal began appearing on shore at both locations. On March 6th, about three miles of beach at Perdido Key was covered with coal at the high tide line, with pieces ranging in size from small flakes to baseball-sized chunks. Storms and rough weather are predicted for the coming week, and more coal will likely wash ashore. Contact has been made with Warrior Gulf, owners of the four barges, about salvage of the barges and cleanup of the beach. It's estimated that it will take about a week to complete the initial cleanup. [Gene Phillips, CR, GUIS, 3/7]\n\nFriday, June 3, 1994\n\n94-266 - Gulf Island (Mississippi/Florida) - Memorial Day Incidents\n\nThe three-day Memorial Day holiday brought a large influx of visitors to the park, including an estimated 50,000 gays to the Santa Rosa area. The approximately four-mile-long section of beach at Santa Rosa has become widely known as the \"gay beach\" among the local and regional gay community, and the annual Memorial Day gathering continues to grow in size each year despite lack of formal sponsorship from any particular organizations or groups. The park managed the event under ICS and brought in nine rangers from other Southeast Region parks to assist. No major incidents occurred during the holiday, but rangers issued numerous warnings and citations for alcohol violations, disorderly conduct, traffic and parking offenses, glass containers on the beach, misdemeanor assaults, obscene sand art, and indecent exposure. Rangers assigned to the gathering at Santa Rosa also responded to the Fort Pickens area on Sunday afternoon to deal with significant gridlock caused by a heavy flow of traffic in and out of the area. The park continues to explore ways to find a group or groups that will take some responsibility for the Santa Rosa gathering so that they can be held financially accountable for some of the park's expenses for managing the event. [Skip Prange, Acting CR, GUIS, 6/2]\n\nThursday, June 9, 1994\n\n94-278 - Gulf Islands (Mississippi/Florida) - Death of Employee\n\nP.C., a long-term seasonal employee of Gulf Islands, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound at his home on the Mississippi coast on Thursday, June 2nd, following several months of depression. He had been offered a seasonal law enforcement job this summer, but the park had withdrawn the offer when it became apparent that he was not emotionally ready for the position. Park personnel contacted mental health clinics in an effort to get help for P.C., and had convinced him to obtain counseling in the weeks before his death. P.C. began work at the park as a seasonal lifeguard on Ship Island in 1984. In subsequent years, he worked in seasonal interpretive and law enforcement positions. He was deeply philosophical and introspective, and wanted the world to be far better than he saw it. A group counseling session with an employee assistance program provider was held on June 3rd and attended by most Mississippi District employees. [Mark Lewis, DR, Mississippi District, GUIS, 6/8]\n\nThursday, June 9, 1994\n\n94-281 - Gulf Islands (Mississippi/Florida) - Special Event\n\nThe third annual Ship Island Boater's Rendezvous and Blessing of the Fleet took place in the park on Sunday, June 5th. Approximately 5,000 people on 700 boats attended the event, which is held at Ship Island, located about a dozen miles off the coast in the park's Mississippi District. Local business men sponsored the event, which included a rock and roll band, a hula-hoop contest, men's and women's bikini contests, and the blessing of the fleet by a Catholic bishop. The sponsors were required to meet comprehensive and detailed permit conditions in order to ensure public safety, resource protection, and adequate sanitation during the event. One visitor was killed on the evening before the event in a personal watercraft accident. Numerous minor law enforcement actions were taken, but only one arrest was made. Rain and heavily overcast skies kept alcohol consumption down, a prime reason for the lack of serious incidents. Severe thunderstorms threatened the event during the afternoon, but did not strike the island; this was providential, as the accompanying strong winds would have caused major problems for the 700 boats anchored within the half-mile stretch of beach where the event was held. Law enforcement officers from the Coast Guard, state, and local sheriff's department assisted rangers on the event, which was managed under the incident command system. [Mark Lewis, DR, Mississippi District, GUIS, 6/8]\n\nFriday, June 24, 1994\n\n94-329 - Gulf Island (Florida/Mississippi) - Drownings\n\nTwo drownings and a near drowning occurred in the park on Sunday, June 19th - a red flag day with high surf that forced intermittent closures of supervised beaches. The first incident occurred off the extreme west tip of West Ship Island in the Mississippi District. L.B., 35, of Metairie, Louisiana, waded into the three- to five-foot surf when he realized his ten- year-old son and another boy were having trouble getting back to shore. The strong currents pulled him underwater and out into the Gulf of Mexico. While rangers and a park lifeguard responded, a passing boater was able to pull one of the boys from the water and throw a life jacket to the second, who was able to make it to shore with the help of ranger Woods and a visitor. Lifeguard Kerry Huston searched the surf and underwater for L.B. for three hours without success. A Coast Guard vessel and helicopter joined in the search, which had to be suspended several hours later because of thunderstorms and increased seas. L.B. is presumed to have drowned. The second incident occurred in the afternoon at the Santa Rosa area in the Florida District. D.E., 17, of the Philippines, had been swimming and surfing west of the guarded beach area; around 2:30 p.m., NPS lifeguard Aaron Patterson noticed that he'd fallen off his surfboard and was struggling less than 100 yards from shore. Patterson and lifeguard Todd Reinhold responded, brought D.E. to shore and administered CPR until a Life Flight helicopter arrived at the scene. D.E. did not survive. The third incident took place a short time later east of the guarded beach at Santa Rosa. Tetsuro Svetsugu, 36, of Mobile, Alabama, was struggling in the surf, but managed to return to shore on his own after taking in an undetermined amount of salt water. NPS lifeguards responded and rendered assistance until a rescue unit could arrive. Svetsugu is reported to be in good condition.

Fort Pickens and its nearby campground were evacuated on Saturday afternoon as a precautionary measure because of the possibility of overwash of Fort Pickens Road. Park islands in Mississippi were also evacuated, and boats were trailered to a safe area. There was some slight overwash of the Fort Pickens Road, but no damage was inflicted. Campers were accordingly allowed back into the campground on Sunday morning. Surf remains hazardous, however, and red flags have been posted. [CRO, GUIS, 7/4]\n\nWednesday, December 28, 1994\n\n94-683 - Gulf Islands (Florida/Mississippi) - Burglary\n\nThe ranger station on Perdido Key was burglarized sometime during the night of December 23rd. The burglar gained entry by knocking out a panel in the front door, then unlocking it. A microwave oven, TV and a mobile radio used as a base station were taken. A joint investigation with Escambia County is underway. [Gene Phillips, CR, GUIS, 12/27]\n\nThursday, January 5, 1995\n\n95-01 - Gulf Islands (Mississippi/Florida) - Drowning\n\nThe body of a missing fisherman was found on the north beach of the Naval Live Oaks area of the park on the afternoon of January 2nd. M.I., 51, of Milton, Florida, had set out fishing from a point ten miles across the bay on the evening of December 23rd, but had failed to return. M.I. had been in a 14-foot fiberglass john boat, and there had been high winds and seas that night. [Gene Phillips, CR, GUIS, 1/4]\n\nWednesday, March 1, 1995\n\n95-84 - Gulf Islands (Mississippi/Alabama) - MVA with Fatality\n\nJ.C., 28, of Milton, Florida, died instantly in a single-vehicle accident in the Santa Rosa area of the park on the afternoon of February 26th. One of the two occupants of the vehicle, M.J., 18, is listed in serious condition at a nearby hospital; the other, N.H., 17, was treated for a fractured shoulder and released. Witnesses report that the vehicle, a high-performance 1993 Camaro, was traveling eastbound at speeds between 90 and 100 mph, passing traffic on the two-lane road, when it went off the highway, hit some dunes, and began flipping over. None of the occupants were wearing seatbelts, and all were ejected. It is not known who was driving. Alcohol is believed to have been a contributing factor. [Gene Phillips, CR, GUIS, 2/27]\n\nThursday, March 16, 1995\n\n95-101 - Gulf Islands (Mississippi/Florida) - Shipping Accident\n\nEarly on the morning of Wednesday, March 8th, the tugboat Mary Sue lost control of four coal barges in the Intercoastal Waterway about a mile north of Horn Island. Strong winds and heavy seas caused the tow cables to break; the crew attempted to regain control of the barges, but was not successful. The pilot decided to beach the barges on the north shore of the island, a designated wilderness area. Two of the barges grounded on relatively flat areas of sand and seagrass, while the other two grounded where a deep hole and sandbar meet. The bow portion of one barge and the stern of the other settled into the deep water, causing them to partially submerge and flooding the cargo boxes. After grounding the barges, the tugboat took shelter in a port about eight miles away. Due to harsh weather, salvage operations did not begin until Thursday evening, when empty barges and a large crane could be brought to the scene. The park imposed stringent salvage conditions in order to minimize damage to the seagrass beds and bottom contours and to reduce coal dust sedimentation of the waters. Park staff have begun an environmental assessment, but continued bad weather has prevented underwater inspections of the area. It is feared that impacts to the area may be severe. The company which owns the tug, Henry Marine of Gulfshores, Alabama, was also involved in a major coal barge accident in the park just under a year ago. In that incident, some 4,000 tons of coals was spilled when two barges sank in Pensacola Pass. Coal dust and lumps of coal were cleaned from park beaches for several weeks after that incident, and coal continues to wash up on park shores. [Gene Phillips, CR, GUIS, 3/16]\n\nWednesday, April 12, 1995\n\n95-148 - Gulf Islands (Mississippi/Florida) - MVA with Fatality\n\nAs park dispatcher Buddy Woods was leaving the park shortly after midnight on April 7th, he was passed by two vehicles heading toward the park at a high rate of speed. Woods radioed this information to ranger Robert Harris, who had set up stationary radar at the Fort Pickens entrance station. Harris clocked the vehicles at 85 mph; before he could react, one of the vehicles, a Ford Bronco, went out of control and began flipping over. One passenger, 17-year-old H.R., was ejected and killed. The driver, G.S., 41, and his 16-year-old daughter were air lifted by life flight to a hospital in Pensacola. The daughter was released; the father was admitted in fair condition. Alcohol is a probable contributing factor.

J.B. was attempting to direct his wife in parking their motorhome when he got caught and crushed between the vehicle and a pine tree. Rangers and other medical personnel in the campground administered CPR until EMS units arrived. J.B. was pronounced dead at the scene. The accident is under investigation. [Gene Phillips, CR, GUIS, 5/22]\n\nMonday, July 3, 1995\n\n95-355 - Gulf Islands (Mississippi/Florida) - Drowning; Three Rescued\n\nOn the afternoon of June 26th, N.W. and a companion were swimming about a quarter mile east of the guarded beach at Perdido Key when they were swept out into the gulf by strong currents. Two visitors on the beach went to their rescue; one reached N.W.'s friend and brought him back to an off-shore sandbar. Lifeguards Philip May and Aaron Patterson received word that thee were swimmers in distress, responded and rescued all but N.W., who they were unable to locate. Two of the rescued swimmers were taken to a hospital in Pensacola. A search was launched for N.W., continued late into the evening, then resumed the following morning. On the 28th, N.W. body was recovered from the surf about a thousand yards east of the point last seen by county SAR team members. Surf conditions were very rough at the time of the incident, with waves two- to three-feet high and a very strong, eastward- trending rip current. Although the drowning did not occur at the guarded beach, yellow cautions flags were flying indicating dangerous surf conditions.

Present movement is to the west-northwest at about 17 m.p.h. Tides as high as three feet above normal are possible along Florida's west coast later today. Projections indicate that the storm will strike the Gulf Coast between Mobile and New Orleans if it stays on its current track. The following reports have been received from affected parks since mid-afternoon yesterday:\n\n* Gulf Islands - The hurricane plan was activated yesterday.\n\n[Steve Smith, SEFO; Steve Hickman, JELA; Mike Riley, Acting CR, DESO; Bill DeHart, CANA; Ben Morgan, EVER; FEMA National Emergency Coordination Center advisory]\n\nThursday, August 3, 1995\n\n95-469 - Florida/Gulf/Atlantic Coast Parks - Follow-up on Hurricane Erin\n\nTropical Storm Erin is once again Hurricane Erin, having been revitalized by the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. As of 5 a.m., Erin's center was about 95 miles southeast of Pensacola, and the storm was moving northwest at about 14 mph. If the hurricane moves to the northwest, the center could reach the Florida panhandle later this morning; if it moves to the west-northwest, the storm could make landfall near the southern Alabama, southern Mississippi or southern Louisiana coast later today. Current maximum winds are around 80 mph, and further strengthening is possible. Storm surge flooding of from six to eight feet above normal and rains of four to eight inches are likely today in the warning area (Apalachicola, Florida, to Morgan City, Louisiana). Here are today's reports from the parks:\n\n* Gulf Islands - The park began preparing for the arrival of Erin on Tuesday. Campers were permitted to register for one night only, and were advised that flash floods and high winds were probable in the near future. As the storm moved across Florida and began taking a course towards the park, preparatory activities escalated - the campground at Fort Pickens was evacuated, arrangements were made to close Santa Rosa Island and Perdido Key, and Horn and Ship Islands were evacuated and buttoned down.\n\n[Gene Phillips, CR, GUIS; Newt Sikes, Chief of Ops, CUIS; FEMA National Emergency Coordination Center advisory]\n\nFriday, August 4, 1995\n\n95-469 - Florida/Gulf Coast Parks - Follow-up on Hurricane Erin\n\nParks affected by the passage of Hurricane Erin over the past 48 hours have submitted the following reports:\n\n* Gulf Islands - The eye of the hurricane passed over the Florida District at 10:45 a.m. yesterday morning. Winds blew at 85 mph, with gusts exceeding 110 mph. An estimated four to six inches of rain fell during the morning and early afternoon and was still falling at the time of the report yesterday evening. The storm surge was estimated to be up to six feet above normal, causing concern that much of the roadway along Santa Rosa Island - site of the park's two largest subdistricts - may be severely damaged. An enormous number of trees were blown down or broken off, blocking some roads. Damage to structures has not yet been determined. Due to downed power lines and poles, all electrical power is out and is not expected to resume for two to five days. Telephone service is limited, but does appear to be holding up. The incident command staff has placed a priority on safety, protection of property and completion of a damage assessment. The Mississippi District was spared the storm's wrath. It received very little rain and winds of only 20 to 25 mph, and reopened this morning.

Numerous sand drifts were found across Highway 399, which goes through the area. Plans are to reopen the area by Friday.\n\n* Fort Pickens - Several trees were down in the Fort Pickens campground, which was also covered with a large amount of debris. There was no overwash or damage to any of the roads there. The park also hopes to have this area opened by Friday.\n\n* Pensacola Beach - At the time of the report, only residents and business owners were being allowed into the area.\n\n* Fort Barrancas - The fort remains closed because of hazardous leaning trees around the visitor center and downed trees on the trail leading up to the fort.\n\n* Perdido Key/Johnson's Beach - Damage to roof shingles and drifting sand were reported in both locations.\n\n* Naval Live Oaks VC - The visitor center remains closed because of the large number of downed trees in the area.\n\nPower and telephone service remains out in much of the park. Some employees reported wind and water damage to their homes and have been allowed time off to assess damage and start cleanup and repair. Many employee residences are also without power or phone service. Today is scheduled as an all-employee cleanup day in the Naval Live Oak and Fort Pickens areas. [CRO, GUIS]\n\nTuesday, August 8, 1995\n\n95-469 - Gulf Islands (Florida/Mississippi) - Follow-up on Hurricane Erin\n\nCleanup efforts continue in the park. A good deal of progress was made over the weekend, and plans still are to open Forts Pickens and Barrancas on Friday. The Santa Rosa day use area remains closed indefinitely while the park negotiates with Gulf Power to replace the downed overhead lines with underground lines. Except for Santa Rosa, all areas now have full power and phone service. The Naval Live Oaks visitor center will probably open tomorrow to provide information to visitors, but trails in the area will remain closed until downed trees can be removed. An overflight of the entire Florida District is scheduled for tomorrow.

The Category IV hurricane will likely come ashore later today. Preparations for its arrival have been completed where necessary:\n\n* Gulf Islands - Park staff in both the Mississippi and Florida Districts began making preparations yesterday for the hurricane's arrival. The offshore islands in the former were evacuated at 1 p.m. yesterday; all areas in the latter were shut down by 3 p.m. All employees have been released to make storm preparations at their homes.

Employees began returning to the park or calling in yesterday morning. Florida District employees have had the most difficulty reporting, as telephone service is sporadic, most electricity is out, and all residents of the entire Pensacola Beach/Gulf Breeze area were evacuated prior to the hurricane's arrival. No reports have been received of any injuries to employees or serious damage to their homes, but many have not yet returned to inspect their property. A damage assessment by aircraft and four-wheel-drive vehicle was begun yesterday. The Florida District was hard hit. Most of the roadway from Fort Pickens to the park's east boundary - some 12 to 15 miles - was destroyed, largely by the huge storm tide. Some stretches were washed away or undermined, others were completely covered by beach sand. Although district buildings apparently did not suffer much damage, the Fort Pickens pier lost all its decking and many of its stringers. Almost all of the primary dunes along the entire length of Santa Rosa Island appear to have washed away, and the island was washed over in many places. Several large sailboats and a large power boat were washed up along the Perdido Key shoreline. Facilities in the Mississippi District made it through without problems, but the tips of all four of the district's islands were severely overwashed and the east tip of Petit Bois was completely cut off from the remainder of the island. The Horn Island and Ship Island piers were damaged. The Davis Bayou section of the Mississippi District on the mainland reopened yesterday, but the rest of that district and all of the Florida District remain closed.

Maintenance chief Sue McGill has brought in terminated seasonals and furloughed trail workers from other areas to help in recovery efforts. Damage to the AT is mostly at higher elevations, but the trail is closed along the entire 70 mile section within the park. Between 600 and 800 trees have fallen across it, and there's been severe structural damage to shelters and other sites. The Alum Cave Bluff trail to Mt. LeConte, one of the park's most popular trails, has been two-thirds destroyed, and will be closed until 1996. Several other higher elevation trails may be damaged almost as badly.\n\nGulf Islands - The park's staff is slowly beginning the process of assessing the impacts of Hurricane Opal, the most intense storm to hit the park since Hurricane Frederick in 1979. Here's what's been learned to date:\n\nFort Pickens - The approximately four and a half miles of road from the east boundary to the ranger station was destroyed by the storm. The two gulf-side parking lots were overwashed, and all asphalt deposited on the north side of the road. Two major boardwalks were either destroyed or extensively damaged. The campground, concession facilities, historic structures, fortifications, and employee housing all escaped any significant damage. Power should be restored to the area by November 1st. The park is work with Florida DOT to rebuild the destroyed section of road. The park's water system is up and running; samples will be taken over the next few days. All park facilities at this location will remain closed indefinitely, but boaters are being permitted access to the area.\n\nSanta Rosa - The state road which runs through the park and connects Pensacola Beach with Navarre Beach received major damage and was essentially destroyed. The park is working with Florida DOT on repairs to the road. The day use facilities sustained major damage; the parking lots and all utilities were completely wiped out. The area will be closed to motor traffic indefinitely.\n\nPerdido Key - The only impact to the area was the deposition of several feet of sand on the road surface east of the Johnson Beach pavilion area. The area reopened last Saturday. The park expects visitation to the area to increase significantly during the fall and spring due to damage to beach areas to the east.\n\nort Barrancas - A few trees fell, but there was no other damage. The fort remains open.\n\nOkaloosa - The concessioner reports that the main parking lot received extensive damage and that the highway between Okaloosa Island and Destin remains closed.\n\nNaval Live Oaks - A number of oaks and pines whose roots were weakened by Hurricane Erin fell during Hurricane Opal, but power was restored the day after the storm and the area is open (except for the nature trail behind the visitor center). the main concern at this location is the increased fire danger created by heavy fuel loads and storm debris.\n\n[Skip Prange, ACR, GUIS; Jason Houck, CR, GRSM]\n\nMonday, November 13, 1995\n\n95-730 - Gulf Islands (Mississippi/Florida) - Accidental Shooting of Employee\n\nJust before noon on Wednesday, November 8th, park laborer J.B. found a six-shot, .22 caliber \"Saturday night special\" in the Davis Bayou area of the Mississippi District. J.B. accidentally shot himself in the index finger of his right hand while handling the weapon. J.B. was taken to a hospital, where he was treated and released. The condition of the weapons indicates that it had been in the elements for a period of time. The investigation is continuing. [Gene Phillips, CR, GUIS]\n\nTuesday, November 14, 1995\n\n95-732 - Gulf Islands (Mississippi/Florida) - Commercial Fishing Violations\n\nThe park began enforcing a prohibition on all commercial fishing within its boundaries last May because of an observed decline in seagrass beds and fish populations and because of the incompatibility of commerical fishing with the park's mission and purpose. Although a prohibition on commercial fishing exists in 36 CFR 2.3(d)(4), questions had been raised regarding its applicability to Gulf Islands. The solicitor, however, recently determined that the regulation applied to fishing in the park. Enforcement was begun following a series of hearings to inform the public. A number of commercial gill net fishermen and crabbers have been cited since May. On November 6th, rangers stopped four shrimp boats for illegal fishing in park waters in four separate incidents. Two were south of Horn Island in the Gulf of Mexico; two were in the sound north of the island. Heavy rains over the previous days had apparently driven the shrimp out into deeper water with higher salinity, tempting the commercial shrimpers to fish in the park. The shrimp trawls and illegal catches were seized; the latter were sold to a seafood house, and the checks are being held in escrow pending court adjudication. [Mark Lewis, DR, GUIS]\n\nTuesday, August 6, 1996\n\n96-439 - Gulf Islands (Mississippi/Florida) - Rescue\n\nA teenage girl contacted ranger Tom Howell on Perdido Key on the evening of July 30th and told him that members of her family were in distress in the gulf off the Star Pavilion area. She then entered the water to assist two cousins on a sandbar. Howell followed right behind her with a rescue buoy. The girl told him that her 10-year-old sister, S.B., and 41-year-old father, C.B., were out beyond the sandbar. The water was very rough at the time, with seas running between three and five feet. Howell swam about 200 yards to S.B. and gave her the rescue buoy. Realizing that C.B. was semi-conscious, taking on water, and in much worse condition, Howell asked Samantha if she could make it on her own. She said she could, so he took the buoy, swam 25 yards to her father, and gave it to him. Due to his condition, C.B. had trouble staying afloat, so Howell took him in tow. C.B. struggled with him, screaming that he was going to die. Meanwhile, a county deputy swam out to Samantha and helped her back to the sandbar. A volunteer fireman in a Zodiac soon arrived to collect all parties and bring them to shore. C.B. was airlifted to a hospital in Pensacola, where he was treated and later released.

[Mark Lewis, DR, GUIS, 3/3]\n\nTuesday, April 29, 1997\n\n97-171 - Gulf Islands NS (Mississippi/Florida) - Ship Sinking; Groundings\n\nA tugboat and two fuel barges went aground on Petit Bois Island in the park's Mississippi District during a bad storm on the morning of Saturday, April 26th. At approximately the same time, a 52-foot wooden shrimp boat sank at East Ship Island, also in the Mississippi District. The tugboat Jeanie G, out of Pascagoula, Mississippi, was pushing two empty fuel barges from Mobile to Pascagoula during an extremely strong frontal passage. Winds were estimated to have exceeded 60 mph during the worst of the storm, with six to eight foot seas in the Mississippi Sound. The crew had to be rescued from the tug due to the danger of capsizing. The tugboat and barges went aground along the north shore of the island in the vicinity of some of the most important seagrass beds along the Mississippi coast. During the same storm, the crew of the shrimp boat Rebel had to be airlifted off the sinking vessel by the Coast Guard. The Rebel sank at the west tip of East Ship Island while trying to reach the lee of the island. The boat, built of wood, began to break up immediately in the heavy seas, and may be impossible to salvage. Approximately 500 gallons of diesel fuel were reported to be onboard. Mississippi resource management specialist Gary Hopkins and ranger Jill Kinney represented the park in the incident command center and during the investigation. The park is working to determine environmental damage and prosecute the cases as appropriate. [CRO, GUIS, 4/28]\n\nTuesday, May 6, 1997\n\n97-183 - Gulf Islands NS (Florida/Mississippi) - Disturbed Person\n\nAs the tour boat to Ship Island was off-loading about 600 visitors on the morning of May 4th, one of passengers, D.T., 43, approached rangers Bernie Doyle and Jeff Woods and informed them that he was feeling both suicidal and homicidal. D.T., who was extremely intoxicated, said that he was a veteran and that he was suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome. He showed them scars on both of his wrists and said that they indicated previous suicide attempts; he also showed them documentation from the Veterans Administration indicating that he'd been diagnosed with the syndrome and was being treated by doctors. D.T. said he needed help so that no one would get hurt. D.T. indicated that he'd cooperate with the two rangers because both were veterans, but said he couldn't deal with police. Doyle and Woods were able to convince D.T. to accept transportation to the mainland in a Coast Guard patrol vessel, since it was a military craft. The Coast Guard took him to Gulfport, where he was transported by ambulance to a local VA hospital. [Mark Lewis, DR, GUIS, 5/5]\n\nMonday, June 9, 1997\n\n97-250 - Gulf Islands NS (MS/FL) - Suspicious Fire\n\nRanger Dennis Parsons discovered a structural fire at the Santa Rosa day use facility in the Florida District at 10:15 p.m. on June 4th. The facility was badly damaged during Hurricane Opal and a government contractor was in the process of demolishing it for salvage. An unoccupied travel trailer was fully involved, and the fire was extending into the surrounding structures. Local fire departments extinguished the blaze before major damage could be done to government buildings. The fire is under investigation by the NPS and the Florida state fire marshal's office. [CRO, GUIS, 6/5]\n\nTuesday, June 10, 1997\n\n97-257 - Gulf Islands NS (MS/FL) - Suicide Intervention\n\nOn June 5th, park dispatch received a report of a young man who was planning to commit suicide in the Escambia County area. This information was passed on to all patrol units and to entrance station employees. Late that afternoon, T.W., a seasonal employee working at the Fort Pickens entrance station, spotted the mentally disturbed individual and immediately notified dispatch. The boy was subsequently taken into custody by deputies without incident. [Skip Prange, DR, GUIS, 6/6]\n\nTuesday, June 17, 1997\n\n97-269 - Gulf Islands NS (FL/MI) - Sexual Assault; Fatal Shooting\n\nA 13-year-old female was sexually assaulted west of parking lot #3 in the Santa Rosa unit in Florida about a half hour past midnight on June 15th. She had left a party in Pensacola Beach with two men to buy cigarettes. They'd stopped at the parking lot and she went for a walk on the beach with C.L.B., 19. C.L.B. threatened her with bodily injury, then assaulted her. She was able to scream for help, which brought the second male, Corey Gray, to her aid. He was able to stop the assault. The girl ran to the road and waved down a passerby, who took her to a pay phone. Escambia County deputies and rangers responded and began a search for C.L.B.'s vehicle, which the girl had described to them. It was subsequently found by a deputy in Pensacola Beach and stopped after a pursuit. As the deputy got out of his patrol car, C.L.B. backed his vehicle up, heading directly towards the deputy. The deputy fires his service weapon and hit C.L.B. twice. C.L.B. continued driving for several miles until he was stopped at a road block. He was airlifted to a local hospital and died several hours later. A joint investigation by the county and park is underway. [CRO, GUIS, 6/16]\n\nMonday, June 23, 1997\n\n97-280 - Gulf Islands NS (MS/FL) - Ship Grounding\n\nA 70-foot shrimp vessel grounded on the south shore of Petit Bois island in the Mississippi district in the early morning hours of June 18th, probably during rough weather. The boat reportedly contains 2,500 gallons of diesel fuel. A Coast Guard strike team will remove the fuel; park staff and the Coast Guard's Marine Safety Office are coordinating efforts to salvage the vessel. The island is part of the park's designated wilderness. This is the third vessel grounding in the district with significant long-term impacts since April. [CRO, GUIS, 6/20]\n\nTuesday, July 1, 1997\n\n97-297 - Gulf Islands National Seashore (FL/MS) - Rescue\n\nOn the morning of June 19th, park dispatch received a report of a swamped boat near parking lot #21 on the gulf side in the Fort Pickens area. Resource management specialist Mark Nicholas and two rangers responded. The boat owner had made it to shore prior to their arrival. The other occupant, a large, middle-aged male, was standing on the hull of the over-turned vessel in about four to five feet of surf, but finally decided to swim to shore. Nicholas entered the water with a torpedo buoy and successfully assisted him to shore. The vessel was towed away without any damage to park resources. [Skip Prange, Acting CR, GUIS, 6/30]\n\nWednesday, July 23, 1997\n\n97-335 - Gulf Coast Areas - Hurricane/Tropical Storm Danny\n\nTwo reports have been received on the impacts of Hurricane Danny, which was downgraded to a tropical storm by the time it came ashore:\n\no Gulf Islands NS (FL/MI) - Areas just west of the park received between 20 and 30 inches of rain, and sustained winds of from 75 to 85 mph blew throughout the area.
