        "text": "While I've shown Scottish Folds for 33 years as well as the occassional, American, British, Persian, Exotic, or Ragdoll - I'd only admired \"slinkies\" from afar. I've always thought they were cool, just never thought I'd want one. That was, until, I got to handle & play with a friend's Cornish Rex at the shows. We had kittens the same age & since she was handicapped, I would help her getting her girl to the ring. I soon fell in love with their wonderful coat, playful personality & clownish behavior. Every since then I swore that some day I'd have one. As fate would have it, in June of 2003, I bumped into a friend of a friend - who just happened to breed Cornish Rex. She had this wonderful little white Cornish who I just couldn't resist, try as I might & so it all began. I brought home Rexdancer's Striptease & she took one look at my hubby & my dogs & fell in love & that quickly I lost my new cat.\n\nHubby took one look at her & asked what the heck that \"rat thing\" was & so Rat was nicknamed. Since she became his & the dog's cat, I decided I needed to get another for myself. Luckily, I had a show down near my friend's home & so went to visit her & all her babies. When I got there, I fell in love with this wonderful little calico baby & everyone know ANYTHING calico is my weakness. Kathy wasn't planning on letting the little one go but agreed to let me buy her if I would have a litter & give her something back & so Taco Kisses - a.k.a RJ (Rat Jr.) came home & my small Rex breeding program & big time love affair with the breed began.\n\nCornish Rex, like the Scottish Folds, are a natural mutation & like the Folds, their beginning can be traced back to a single cat. In Bodmin Moor in Cornwall England, on July 21, 1950 a red & white male kitten was born who would become the \"Susie\" of the Cornish breed. Killibunker, as he was named, was one of 5 kittens born to a straight coated tortie named Serena. Serena's owner, Nina Ennismore recognized that he had a \"foreign\" body (elegant, slinky with a wedge typed head) & a curly coat. She had worked with Rex rabbits & decided to work with the new mutation in cats. She & a geneticist first bred Killi back to his mom & after keeping a curly coated son, Poldhu continued to breed these two to Burmese, Siamese & British as well as their own progeny. These cats would become the foundation of the Cornish Rex breed.\n\nIn 1957 Nina sent over a pregnant cat, Lamor Cove, to a breeder in California. Two of Lamora's kittens - Diamond Lil of FanTree & Marmaduke of DazZling are the foundation of the Cornish here in the United States. Here they were crossed with Siamese, Burmese, Havana's & American Shorthairs for vigor, big ears & fine boning.\n\nIn 1962 Marmaduke of DazZling was the first Cornish registered with CFA (Cat Fanciers Association) in the US & in 1963 they were accepted by the CCA (Canadian Cat Association). When TICA was started, in 1979, the Rex came in with Championship status. Right from the start these wonderful cats were a big hit in North America."
