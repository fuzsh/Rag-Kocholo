        "text": "The bernedoodle is a cross between a Bernese mountain dog and a poodle.\n\nThis crossbreed mixes the ingenious silliness of the poodle, with the even-tempered fidelity of the Berner. It is also a smaller sized dog for those who think a Bernese Mountain Dog is a bit too large, or have small children in the house and fear that a large dog breed may be too much of a handful. Bernedoodles shed less than Berners, making them safer for people with allergies.\n\nThe Bernedoodle is a great companion dog. Some can have a “messy” look about them. I wouldn’t expect them to win the beauty show award, but that’s not the main reason we adopt our furry friend, is it? But if you are looking for someone who will be happy to be with you on a hike, snowshoeing, out on the yard, or laying by the fireplace; then the Bernedoodle will be what you need.\n\nAlthough our litters are very consistent to avoid any in-breeding, no two Bernedoodles are identical. The genes from the parent change the litter in infinite permutations of coat marking. If you’d like to choose your own puppy marking, perhaps you should coordinate with us to get your puppy after it has been born and maybe even trained. But your options could be limited to what’s available. Since Bernedoodles are so popular, sometimes they are reserved even before they’re born.\n\nBernedoodles, in general, are very healthy. As responsible breeders, we ensure that our parents are screened for any health condition such as: hip and elbow dysplasia, blood disorders, cancers, and progressive retinal atrophy. As a future owner of a Bernedoodle, you should be aware that all large breeds are prone to bloat, a sudden and life-threatening stomach condition. Bernedoodle’s owners should learn what signs to look out for, and what to do should these signs appear. Additionally, and as recommended for any dog, a Bernedoodle’s ears should be checked regularly for signs of infection, and the teeth should be brushed often, using a toothpaste designed for dogs.\n\nRecommended Health Tests From the National Breed Club:\n\nHip Evaluation\n\nPatella Evaluation\n\nOphthalmologist Evaluation\n\nThe Bernedoodle are not known for having hypersensitivity or allergies to any specific diet. Just make sure you maintain a well-balanced and high-quality nutrient’s food base to ensure your Bernedoodle is getting what it needs for a long and happy life. There are many high-quality foods available in the market, however if you decide to take a home-prepared meal approach, make sure you discuss this with your veterinarian. Too much or too little of a good food can still lead to complications in the future. Also, the dig requires a different diet plan according to his/her age (puppy, adult, or senior)\n\nIf you feed your dog from your table, please be very educated on which human foods are safe for your Bernedoodle and which are not. Not just the food, but also the ingredients inside the food can be harmful. Make sure your Bernedoodle has available water at all times, specially during the summer. Dogs do not sweat like humans do. And your Bernedoodle has a very long and thick coat. It’s the equivalent of wearing a winter coat your entire life. Monitor the color and stench of the dog’s urine. If it kills your grass quickly, it is orange, and smells, chances are that it is very acidic, and your dog needs more water. For many dogs you will need a slow-drinking/slow-eating bowl to ensure they don’t vomit because of eating or drinking too fast.\n\nYour Bernedoodle needs plenty of activity and exercise. If your Bernedoodle is also helping in your farm, or in any job where he/she gets lots of physical activity, make sure you bring him/her inside after a few hours for a break. Bernedoodles will work themselves to death if you don’t stop them. They enjoy it too much.\n\nWhile they are unquestionably meant to live indoors with their family, Bernedoodles enjoy outdoor activities and make great companions on long walks, hikes, hunting trips, camping, and/or backpacking. It is always a great idea to give your canine friend a task of some kind. So if you do not own a farm, perhaps you could consider a sport that your Bernedoodle will enjoy. Bernedoodles participate and excel in many disciplines such as: carting and drafting competitions, agility, herding, obedience, rally, and tracking.\n\nKeep in mind, a dog is not an object in your house. It is a living being. Much like a human, keeping your dog active and engaged in some form of exercise controls weight, improves brain activity, and extends the overall health.\n\nThe Bernedoodle has a complex mix of long and wooly coats from the Bernese Mountain and the Poodle. Bernedoodles ar enot known for shedding too much, however do brush your Bernedoodle weekly to minimize shedding and an overgrown coat. Not only it will help your dog look stunning, but it improves coat quality, reduce knotting, minimizes skin conditions and dandruff, and regulates temperature. Make sure your Bernedoodle is fully hydrated during shedding season.\n\nAs with all breeds, the nails should be trimmed regularly, as overly long nails can cause the dog pain, structural problems, and accidental scratching. If you can hear your dog clicking when he/she walks, that is a great indicator that nails are too long.\n\nNot all Bernedoodles are consistent with coat length. Some have a slightly shorter outer coat than others, and sometimes it gets in places like their eyes, or around the female genital area. If your Bernedoodle has an unusual longer coat, it is a good idea to take him/her in for a trim.\n\nEarly socialization and obedience training are important for all dogs, but especially so for breeds as large as the Bernedoodle. Bernedoodles are intelligent and eager to please, so they are usually easy to train, in fact they enjoy it! They are also affectionate and openhearted; their feelings are easily hurt, and so they don’t respond well to harsh corrections or training methods. They are living proof that gentle giants exist.\n\nA Bernedoodle wants to be with his family, and undesirable behaviors can result if he is regularly left alone for long periods of time. If you do not have time for your dog, consider not having one. Bernedoodles are not meant to be separated from humans."
