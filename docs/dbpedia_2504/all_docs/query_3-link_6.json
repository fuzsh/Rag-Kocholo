A year later, she found herself in Moscow attending the world-famous Bolshoi Theatre. From there, she moved to New York City and was accepted at NYU Tisch School of the Arts. At that time, she got her first agent and began booking various jobs in plays, movies, commercials, and modeling. She also started singing in underground bands.\n\nBeing an adrenaline junkie, she found herself making extra money as an amateur boxer which later on helped her book movies like \"The Car,\" a remake by Universal Pictures, and the franchise \"DOOM\" movie also with Universal Pictures. Her other work includes the starring role of Marie in \"Hell Hath No Fury,\" a Jesse V Johnson movie, playing a French resistance fighter, and she played the lead role of \"GG,\" who was based on a 90s goth singer in the film \"Carpe Noctem,\" which was directed by Gene Blalock.

Entertainment, Fuse, and The Grammys as a Trophy Presenter. Her reality show credits include Battleground Earth with Tommy Lee and Ludacris and Hollywoodfruer, the Danish acclaimed TV show.\n\nA passion for the stage drew her back to her roots as she performed in various plays such as \"The Cherry Orchard\" with A Noise Within, and her favorite, the portrayal of Marlene Dietrich in \"Garbo's Cuban Lover\" with the Macha Theatre. Her theatrical agent introduced her to Paul Anka, who shortly after began managing her music career and helped her sign a six-album contract with Warner Bros. Record by their President Rob Cavallo. They called her new solo project \"N.I.N.A.\" which led to her last band, \"Letters From The Fire.\"\n\nNina worked on soundtracks for Lionsgate Films, singing the theme song for \"Catacombs,\" \"Repo the Genetic Opera,\" and \"Sharknado\". She sang the end title song in \"Black Limousine\" and was the voice on the soundtrack for \"All About Her.\" Additionally, she performed live for the World Series and the NCAA College Football Season.\n\nHer work in music videos includes a starring role in Gnarls Barkley's video \"Gone Daddy Gone,\" Sick Puppies video \"All the Same,\" and Trey Songz \"Foreigner\". She has been seen in over 50 commercials and hundreds of print campaigns, ranging from La Perla to Apple Computer, Sprite, Nike, and her well-known Nature Valley and Dos Equis with the Most Interesting Man in the World. Her most recent commercial campaign is the Carl's Jr. Beyond Meat and her notorious \"Balls Commercial\" for Saxx Underwear, where she was the spokesperson.\n\nAlong with her career, Nina is an avid animal rights activist with an active voice for the ethical treatment of our companions.
