        "text": "Education\n\nI paid a lot of money for these degrees, so I’m gonna show them off, yeah?\n\nIn 2013, I went to Dalhousie University for a Business degree but dropped out 3 days in. I switched to a double major of Creative Writing and English Literature, with a focus on Medieval Literature. I spent most of my degree writing about talking birds in medieval dream poetry (that rooster in Chaucer still haunts my dreams) and reading Lord of the Rings (my favourite series).\n\nBefore I graduated with Honours, I popped over to the University of Glasgow to study abroad for a semester.\n\nAfter uni, I had no idea what to do with my life, so I figured I’d get a law degree. It was always my backup since most of my family are lawyers. I wrote my LSATs but had a year to wait to get my results and apply to school, so I took off to Europe with $3,000 to my name.\n\nBy the time I’d reached Berlin at Christmas, I knew I needed to keep traveling. When I was happier eating a stale Starbucks cookie than I was with my full ride to law school, I knew I needed to change my plans.\n\nI found a $200 flight and moved to New Zealand. (My travel blog was born in a dog bed while I waited for my visa to process.)\n\nI ended up leaving New Zealand after a year when I got into a Publishing Media Masters at Oxford Brookes University in the UK.\n\nI completed my degree with Honours and a failed podcast we don’t need to talk about from the comfort of my sister’s basement during the pandemic when I had to return to Canada.\n\nI also did a Continuing Education course in Creative Writing at the University of Toronto when I was 16 (I found a loophole and fully exploited it) where I got to have my novel reviewed by Joy Fielding.\n\nMore About Me\n\nWow you’re still interested? Cool!\n\nI’m Nina, a purple-haired Canadian girl who loves to live basically anywhere but Canada. I’ve lived in 12 countries in the last 11 years, on every continent but South America and Antarctica (I’ve done Canadian winter. I’m good).\n\nMy favourite country I’ve lived in is New Zealand, and one day I do plan to move back there with my dog.\n\nI’ve chronically ill, disabled, and have a service dog who helps me out. I’m one of those business owners who makes you go “well if she can do it with all those issues, I can definitely do it!”\n\nI spent most of my life feeling completely lost. My siblings always had a clear idea of what they wanted to do with their lives, but I just knew I loved dogs and liked spending time online. Ergo, I spent most of my childhood coding basic HTML websites for our family dogs. I eventually started writing, and then all my friends got loot bags with fanfiction about my dogs in them (my mom snuck some candy in too, don’t worry!).\n\nBy the time I reached high school, I’d written 4 novels and was basically fluorescent from the lack of sun.\n\nI kept trying to be the “normal” kid who wanted to stick with the whole 9-to-5 path and work in an office every day, but I hated the structure of it. My first internship at a bank solidified that I was definitely not meant for a business casual life.\n\nI started my first blog – technically – during undergrad, when I had a concussion and couldn’t finish an assignment in class. So I wrote 4 posts for a blog.\n\nThat blog would later become my multi-6 figure travel blog.\n\nMy Travel Blog Journey\n\nI’ve always loved to travel. I first moved abroad alone when I was 16 and found a semi-sketchy study abroad opportunity in the tiny town of Atri (best florentines you’ll ever have!).\n\nTravel has never come easy to me though. When I later moved to Scotland to study abroad, I had one of the lowest times of my life. My therapist and I still refer to my darker moments as “Glasgow times” even now.\n\nI’d just been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and generalized panic disorder. The ADHD diagnosis wouldn’t come for nearly a decade, but I’m sure that played into it too.\n\nEveryone wanted me to cancel the trip, but it ultimately saved my life. Solo travel helped me find my footing, learn to navigate my own brain, and start my path chasing for happiness with experiences.\n\nAfter undergrad, I found a program called Workaway (it’s like Airbnb for volunteering). For $40, I could get free accommodation and food across Europe if I just did a few hours of work a day. Sold!\n\nI taught English, babysat kids, puppysat a Chihuahua, built fences, led hikes and meditations, mocktail bartended, rode horses, cleaned, and wrote web copy across Europe. All the while, I freelanced as a writer to make some pocket cash.\n\nWhen I found a $200 flight to New Zealand, I knew I had to go to the land of Hobbits and my therapist (her accent is the best!).\n\nMy travel site was born while I sat in my family dog’s bed when he couldn’t jump up on the couch anymore for cuddles. Hudson oversaw the creation of one of the worst homepages you’ve ever seen (thankfully that’s buried where only the Wayback Machine can find it!).\n\nMy SEO Journey\n\nMy blog was a dumpster fire for years. If there was something you could do wrong with a blog, I probably did it.\n\nI danced on Tiktok and pointed at weird text bubbles. I tried to take Instagram aesthetic photos without a camera. I created digital products literally no one asked me for or wanted. And I did all the things all at the same time.\n\nI wrote posts for me, not for my audience. Like the one about what I was most excited to do in Singapore (see my mom), when my only reader WAS my mom and she was in the bed beside me.\n\nI started using Facebook groups where you swap comments or Google each other’s blog to fake organic traffic. I spent 120 hours a week doing that to get to – at most – 30k pageviews.\n\nI got my first taste of success when a post I wrote about being Canadian took off during a US election. I got a few thousand pageviews and was floored! But I had no idea how to replicate it.\n\nIt wasn’t until I took my first SEO course in January of 2021 that I started to understand SEO.\n\nBut I still did everything wrong! I used “easy” keywords that had nothing to do with my niche. I also had the hardest niche and then never stuck with it. I jumped from strategy to strategy every week, never giving anything time to work. And I never looked at my blog as a whole – just at individual new posts.\n\nIn November 2021, I gave myself an ultimatum: make at least $2,000 a month from your blog or you have to go to law school.\n\nSo, while working 4 jobs, I set a plan to get myself into Mediavine by the end of 2022.\n\nI started with 5k sessions in December and by the end of May I had 56k!\n\nI invested in my blog with courses, coaches, and audits. And by July 2022, I had made my first $10k passively from my travel blog.\n\nSince then, I’ve learned a lot more about SEO. I’ve used my knowledge to scale two of my blogs to Raptive, make over $110k in one month from 2 sites, and have helped thousands of students improve their blog traffic.\n\nMy AI Journey\n\nI’ve been using AI since it was a dirty word in the SEO community.\n\nIn October 2021, I found Jasper.ai (then, called Jarvis).\n\nI used it to scale my outputs from 8k words a month to over 100k words in a week!\n\nBack when people – and Google – still said that Google didn’t rank AI content, I grew my site to 100k pageviews per month with hundreds of #1 rankings on Google, all from AI co-written content.\n\nI wrote an ebook with AI that sold over 1,000 copies, created a quiz that still gets over 1,300 email subscribers a month, and scaled my ad income to $100 a day all with Jasper.ai.\n\nBy spring of 2023, everyone jumped on the AI train and it was finally safe to talk about it publicly and share my tips without some troll ranting at me about how Google would find out and hate my content.\n\nIn 2023, I’ve tried over 200 AI softwares because I fricken love AI!\n\nMy favourite AI writers are still ChatGPT 4 and Jasper.ai. But I’ve found plenty of cool tools to do everything from edit videos to replicating my voice (that one was kinda freaky!).\n\nI’ve even used GPT4 to code a plugin that got me over 15k organic pageviews in 2 days! And I have 0 idea how to code (ask my host. They’ll tell you I email weekly with something I broke trying to use CSS).\n\nAI is democratizing entrepreneurship and making it accessible for everyone to create a business that can generate a full-time income online. It’s not just the tech bros who can invest in 100 writers a month or the big businesses anymore. Now everyone has a chance to turn their passion into a business.\n\nSince my mission is to help y’all achieve financial freedom from your blog, I’m a big fan of anything that can help you do that faster.\n\nQuitting My Job\n\nI quit my 9-to-5 job late in the game.\n\nIt wasn’t until I had my first $30k month that I felt comfortable giving up the safety of a consistent salary. Cause honestly I was scared!\n\nI’m chronically ill, so I have a lot of medical expenses. And I’d only just paid off the debt of training my service dog.\n\nBut in January 2023, when I hit $31.5k in passive income from my travel blog, I knew I needed to believe in myself and say goodbye to the office job.\n\nThanks to some money mindset coaching, I realized I didn’t need to fear my income plummeting (although I was pretty afraid it might. I’ve got clinical anxiety, y’all!). I needed to believe that it could keep growing…\n\nAnd it did! I had my first $100k month in June and became the second winner of Niche Site Lady’s race to $100k after John Dykstra.\n\nI said it before but I’ll say it again: SEO and AI changed my life. And I want them to change yours too.\n\nBecause everyone deserves to be this ecstatic as I am about their job.\n\nThat’s why I founded She Knows SEO."
