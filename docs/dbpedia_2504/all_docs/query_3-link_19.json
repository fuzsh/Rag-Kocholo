        "text": "AS WE'VE DISCUSSED ON THIS SHOW, THE ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR HAS CAUSED A GLOBAL SPIKE IN HATE CRIMES, AND FILMMAKER DANIEL LAMBROSO KNOWS ALL ABOUT IT.\n\nHIS FIRST FILM \"WHITE NOISE\" WAS A DEEP DIVE INTO THE ALT-RIGHT MOVEMENT IN THE UNITED STATES.\n\nHIS LATEST FILM \"NINA AND IRINA\" FOLLOWS HIS INTERVIEWS WITH HIS HOLOCAUST SURVIVING GRANDMOTHER WHO REVEALS THAT HER OLDER SISTER PERISHED DURING THE WAR.\n\nHARRY SRINIVAS SPOKE TO THEM.\n\nOUR ONGOING SERIES OF ANTI-SEMITISM, RACISM, AND EXTREMISM.\n\n>> THANK YOU.\n\nTHANK YOU BOTH FOR JOININGS.\n\nDANIEL, WHAT MADE YOU WANT TO DO A FILM ABOUT THIS?\n\n>> I SPENT A LOT OF MY CAREER FOCUSED ON FAR RIGHT EXTREMISM AND ITS DANGERS.\n\nMY FIRST FILM \"WHITE NOISE\" IS ABOUT THE RISE OF THE ALT-RIGHT MOVEMENT.\n\nI WAS ONE OF THE FIRST REPORTERS IN THE COUNTRY TO START COVERING THAT GROUP EIGHT YEARS AGO.\n\nAND PART OF THAT REASON WAS BECAUSE OF MY GRANDMOTHER'S STORY.\n\nSHE TAUGHT ME -- BOTH MY GRANDMOTHERS ARE HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS.\n\nMY MOM'S MOTHER NINA AND MY FATHER'S.\n\nSO I GREW UP I THINK WITH AN UNDERSTANDING AND A VIGILANCE ABOUT HOW DANGEROUS THESE IDEAS CAN BE.\n\nSO I RESPONDED QUICKLY BACK WHEN TRUMP WAS A CANDIDATE EIGHT YEARS AGO, AND I REALIZED THAT HIS BASE, PEOPLE WHO ARE MY AGE WERE BEING RADICALIZED BY FAR RIGHT, RACIST ISLAMOPHOBIC ANTISEMITIC IDEAS.\n\nSO MY EDITOR AT THE TIME JEFF GOLDBERG ENCOURAGED ME TO PURSUE IT, AND THAT ORGANICALLY BECAME A FEATURE FILM FROM THEN TO CHARLOTTESVILLE AND BEYOND.\n\nAND NOW WITH \"THE NEW YORKER,\" WHERE I'M ON STAFF, I JUST KIND OF REALIZED IT DAWNED ON ME THAT THE GENERATION THAT SURVIVED THE WAR IS DISAPPEARING VERY QUICKLY.\n\nMY GRANDMOTHER, SHE SAYS THE FILM COULD HAVE BEEN CALLED \"THE VANISHING BREED.\"\n\nTHAT'S WHAT SHE TELLS ME.\n\nAND IT'S SAD BECAUSE THEY'RE THE LIVING MEMORY OF WHAT HAPPENED OF HOW AWFUL HUMANS CAN BE.\n\nAND IT'S REALLY THE LAST OPPORTUNITY TO DO A PROJECT LIKE THIS.\n\nSO I BROUGHT IT UP TO DAVID REMNICK, THE EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, AND HE ENCOURAGED ME TO PURSUE IT.\n\nSO I CALLED MY GRANDMOTHER.\n\nSHE SAID COME OVER, AND WE MADE A FILM.\n\n>> THE WAR BROKE OUT SEPTEMBER 1st, 1939.\n\nFROM THE MINUTE THE GERMANS ROLL IN, THEY STARTED PICKING UP JEWS IN THE STREET.\n\nMY FATHER DECIDED WE'RE NOT STAYING HERE.\n\nHE FIGURED OUT SOMEHOW THAT MAYBE IF HE WENT TO A PRIEST AND THE PRIEST WOULD GIVE US THE PAPERS SAYING THAT WE ARE STUDYING TO BECOME CATHOLIC, THAT THAT WILL SAVE US.\n\nTHE ONLY PROBLEM WAS THAT WE REALLY HAD TO PRETEND THAT WE'RE NOT JEWS.\n\nWE HAD TO GO TO CHURCH.\n\n♪♪ AND ALL THE JEWS WENT TO THE GHETTO.\n\nAND IT WAS BAD NEWS THERE.\n\n>> NINA, DID YOU HAVE A RELUCTANCE TO TALK ABOUT ALL OF THIS OVER THE YEARS AND THE DECADES?\n\n>> WELL, THE THING -- NOBODY WAS INTERESTED, YOU KNOW.\n\nNOBODY SPOKE ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST.\n\nAND I NEVER DISCUSSED IT.\n\nMY KIDS NEVER ASKED ME.\n\nWHEN THEY WERE LITTLE, I THOUGHT WELL, IT'S TOO HORRIFIC TO TELL THEM ABOUT IT.\n\nSO I FIGURED OKAY, THE FUTURE, FUTURE, FUTURE.\n\nTHE FUTURE NEVER CAME UNTIL MY GRANDSON HERE DECIDED THAT THERE IS A STORY TO BE TOLD, AND THAT'S WHAT HE DID.\n\nAND HE APPROACHED ME AND I SAID OKAY, GO ON.\n\nAND YOU BETTER HURRY, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I'M 91 YEARS OLD.\n\nI WAS 90 AT THE TIME.\n\nYOU KNOW, I'M NOT STAYING HERE FOR A LONG TIME.\n\nI WAS BORN IN A TOWN BETWEEN WARSAW AND KRAKOW.\n\nWE WERE WAY ABOVE MIDDLE CLASS.\n\nAND IF ANYBODY THINKS THAT I COME FROM A -- I GET VERY UPSET BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER SEEN A SCHTETTLE IN MY WHOLE LIFE.\n\nMY SISTER WAS SIX YEARS OLDER.\n\nSUPPOSEDLY, I LOOKED LIKE CHERYLLY TEMPLE.\n\nI HAVE BLOND CURLS.\n\nAND SHE WAS DIANA DURBIN.\n\nONCE SHE HEARD A TUNE, SHE COULD SIT DOWN AND PLAY IT.\n\nMY SISTER HAD FRIENDS, AND I -- SHE WOULDN'T LET ME IN.\n\nSHE WOULD CLOSE THE DOOR, AND THEY WOULD TALK ABOUT DIFFERENT THINGS, AND I WOULD LISTEN THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE.\n\nAND IF I HEARD SOMETHING BAD, I WOULD RUN TO MY MOTHER.\n\nYOU KNOW WHAT SHE IS DOING?\n\nWE WERE EATING SOMETHING, AND SHE WANTS WHAT I HAVE.\n\nSHE WOULD SAY YOU WANT TO EAT THEM?\n\nDISGUSTING.\n\nHOW CAN YOU HAVE THAT, YOU KNOW?\n\nTHE MINUTE I PUSHED IT AWAY, SHE WOULD TAKE IT AND EAT IT.\n\n>> AND HER NAME IS IRENE?\n\n>> HER NAME WAS IRENE?\n\n>> IRINA.\n\n>> IRINA.\n\n>> AND WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SAW HER?\n\n>> IN APRIL OF 1943.\n\n>> WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER ABOUT YOUR SISTER GROWING UP?\n\nWHAT KIND OF SISTER WAS SHE?\n\n>> WELL, THERE WAS A SIX-YEAR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US.\n\nSO, YOU KNOW, WE WERE NOT FRIENDLY-FRIENDLY.\n\nBUT I -- I LOOKED UP TO HER.\n\nAND WE LIKE WE HAD A RELATIONSHIP LIKE TWO SISTERS, YOU KNOW.\n\nAND I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT I'LL NEVER SEE HER AGAIN.\n\n>> DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT SHE SAID TO YOU, WHAT SHE DID WHEN SHE LEFT?\n\n>> ALL SHE DID, SHE SEND US A POSTCARD SAYING THAT SHE'S GOING -- WE WERE AT THAT TIME IN THE SUBURBS OF WARSAW.\n\nTHEY SAID -- SHE SAID I'M GOING TOWARDS -- NOW UKRAINE, WHERE WE HAVE FAMILY.\n\nAND SHE SAID IN THE POSTCARD, I'M GOING TO SEE IF THERE IS ANYONE LEFT THERE.\n\nAND THAT'S THE LAST TIME I HEARD OF HER.\n\nTO ME, SHE JUST WENT ON THE EVENTUALLY SHE IS GOING TO COME BACK.\n\nSO, YOU KNOW, AFTER THE WAR, MY PARENTS TRIED TO THE RED CROSS AND ALL THIS, AND THERE WAS NO TRACE OF HER.\n\nWE THINK THAT POSSIBLY WHEN SHE WAS ON THE TRAIN, THE GERMANS USED TO GO THROUGH THE TRAINS ASKING FOR PAPERS AND EVERYTHING.\n\nAND SOMETHING MUST HAVE HAPPENED, AND THEY PROBABLY TOOK HER OFF THE TRAIN AND SHOT HER, BECAUSE THERE IS NO RECORD OF HER BEING IN ANY CONCENTRATION CAMPS OR ANYTHING.\n\n>> SO DANIEL, DID YOU KNOW ALL OF THIS GOING INTO THE FILM OF THE STORY THAT SHE JUST SHARED WITH OUR AUDIENCE?\n\n>> YOU KNOW, I KNOW, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW.\n\nI HAD A SENSE, YOU KNOW.\n\nHER PIANO WHICH YOU SEE IN THE FILM WAS FILLED WITH FAMILY PICTURES.\n\nHER TWO KIDS, HER SIX GRANDKIDS, HER FIVE GREAT GRANDKIDS, THE LIFE MY GRANDMOTHER REBUILT FROM THE ASHES OF THE WAR.\n\nBUT IN THE CENTER IS A SMALL CUTOUT OF A BLACK AND WHITE PHOTO OF A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN.\n\nAND I NEVER ASKED WHO THAT WAS.\n\nIT'S MY GRANDMOTHER'S SISTER IRENA.\n\nAND I NEVER SPENT A MOMENT OF MY LIFE ASKING WHO THAT WAS.\n\nIN THE ROOM NEXT TO US IS A PAINTING OF HER SISTER.\n\nI NEVER ASKED OR WONDERED WHO THAT WAS.\n\nI DIDN'T KNOW THAT MY GRANDMOTHER LOST 25 FAMILY MEMBERS.\n\nSHE LOST ALL FOUR OF HER GRANDPARENTS, EVERY AUNT, UNCLE AND COUSIN FOR THE MOST PART.\n\nTHE ONLY ONES WHO SURVIVED WERE HER, HER MOM, HER DAD, AND HER, AND THEN THEY CAME TO AMERICA IN THE '50s.\n\nSO, YOU KNOW, I THINK I HAD A SENSE.\n\nAND EVEN MY MOTHER, WHO IS MY GRANDMOTHER'S DAUGHTER, WE ALL UNDERSTOOD THAT SHE WAS A SURVIVOR, BUT WE DIDN'T PROBE, AND WE DIDN'T WANT TO PUSH HER TO GO THERE.\n\nYOU KNOW, IT'S A SHAME THAT WE WAITED THIS LONG, BUT I'M GLAD THAT WE HAVE THE CHANCE TO DO IT WHILE SHE IS STILL HERE.\n\n>> SO HOW DO YOU FEEL NOW THAT YOU'VE SEEN IT, THAT YOUR STORY IS OUT THERE?\n\n>> I'M GLAD.\n\nI'M GETTING VERY WARM RECEPTION.\n\nPEOPLE, WHEN THEY ARE IN THE AUDIENCE, WHEN IT'S A Q&A, COME UP TO ME AND SO GRATEFUL TO ME FOR SHARING IT.\n\nI DON'T KNOW.\n\nIT SEEMS THAT PEOPLE LIKE TO HEAR THE STORY, AND I'M GLAD IF I MADE SOMEBODY HAPPY, OR WHATEVER.\n\nIT HAS SOME VALUE.\n\nAND I FEEL THAT, YOU KNOW, THE YOUNG PEOPLE NOWADAYS DON'T KNOW.\n\nSOME DON'T EVEN KNOW THERE WAS A HOLOCAUST.\n\n>> YEAH.\n\n>> HOLOCAUST, WHAT'S THAT?\n\nAND NOW WITH THE ANTI-SEMITISM RISING, YOU KNOW, IT'S AN IMPORTANT STORY TO TELL.\n\nSO WHEN DANIEL APPROACHED ME, I FELT YES, LET'S GO AHEAD, YOU KNOW.\n\n>> DANIEL, THIS FILM PREMIERED REALLY IN THE WAKE OF OCTOBER 7th.\n\nWHAT HAS -- WHAT'S THAT DONE TO HOW THE FILM IS BEING RECEIVED AND TALKED ABOUT?\n\n>> YOU KNOW, I THINK THE FILM IS MORE URGENT THAN EVER.\n\nOCTOBER 7th WAS THE DEADLIEST DAY FOR JEWS SINCE THE HOLOCAUST.\n\n1,200 ISRAELI CITIZENS MASSACRED.\n\nNO MATTER WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THE CONFLICT, MANY OF THE CIVILIANS WERE PEACE ACTIVIST, ARTISTS AND FILMMAKERS.\n\nI KNOW PERSONAL FRIENDS OF MINE WHO WERE INJURED OR KILLED.\n\nIT WAS A CATASTROPHIC DAY.\n\nAND WE SAW THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DIDN'T EVEN TAKE A MOMENT TO MOURN.\n\nTHEY SPURRED INTO ACTION.\n\nAND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE JEWISH WORLD WERE SHOCKED THAT THOSE WHO THEY CONSIDERED ALLIES WHO WE'VE MARCHED WITH AND STOOD WITH COULDN'T EVEN TAKE A SECOND TO MOURN.\n\nIRRESPECTIVE WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THE CURRENT ISRAELI GOVERNMENT, WHICH I'M PERSONALLY NOT A FAN OF.\n\nHALF THE JEWISH WORLD IS IN AMERICA ROUGHLY, AND THE OTHER HALF IS IN ISRAEL.\n\nTHIS WAS A MASSIVE TERRORIST ATTACK.\n\nAND TO NOT TAKE THAT SECOND.\n\nAND NOW WE'RE SEEING, YOU KNOW, A PUMMELLING RESPONSE FOR PALESTINIANS IN GAZA.\n\nAND IT'S HARD FOR ME TO SEE.\n\nI KNOW IT'S HARD FOR MY GRANDMOTHER TO SEE.\n\nIN THE FILM, SHE TALKS ABOUT, YOU KNOW, ESSENTIALLY AN EYE FOR AN EYE MAKES THE WHOLE WORLD BLIND, AND THAT REVENGE IS NEVER A GOOD THING.\n\nSHE WATCHES A GERMAN OFFICER BE BURNED IN FRONT OF HER, AND SHE ENCOURAGES THE PEOPLE AS A KID TO NOT DO THAT, TO STOP.\n\n>> WE WERE NOW EVACUATED AS POLES.\n\nWE GOT ON THE TRAIN, AND WE ENDED UP IN PRAGUE.\n\nTHE CZECHS DECIDE TO LIBERATE THE TOWN FROM THE GERMANS BECAUSE THE ALLIES ARE VERY CLOSE.\n\nTHE CZECHS POURED TAR ON THE GERMANS, HUNG THEM AND THEN LIT THE MATCH.\n\nI MEAN, THIS WAS HORRIBLE.\n\nI NEVER -- THE SMELL OF THE BURNING FLESH.\n\n>> BUT YOU -- YOU LOST YOUR SISTER.\n\nSURELY THAT'S REVENGE TO BURN.\n\n>> WHY?\n\n>> ISN'T THAT A KIND OF REVENGE, SOMETHING THAT THEY DESERVED?\n\n>> NO.\n\nNO.\n\nI JUST -- YOU DON'T DO THAT TO OTHER HUMAN BEING.\n\nCOME ON.\n\nWE ARE ALL BORN LITTLE ADORABLE CHILDREN.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS?\n\nWHAT HAPPENS?\n\nWHAT HAPPENS TO PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN BECOME WORSE THAN ANIMALS.\n\nANIMALS KILL BECAUSE THEY'RE HUNGRY.\n\nBUT TERRIBLE WHAT PEOPLE DO TO PEOPLE.\n\nIT'S BEYOND ME.\n\nI DON'T CARE GERMAN, JEW, WHOEVER.\n\n>> NINA, DO YOU THINK SOMETHING LIKE THE HOLOCAUST COULD HAPPEN AGAIN?\n\n>> I DON'T KNOW.\n\nI DON'T KNOW.\n\nIF WE LET IT, IF WE LET IT.\n\nWE HAVE TO STOP IT EARLY ENOUGH.\n\nHOPEFULLY, BY SHOWING MOVIES LIKE ABOUT ME AND OTHER PEOPLE THAT WENT THROUGH SHOW THE ATROCITIES AND TO -- WHAT I'M AFRAID OF, WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THAT THE BULLYING IS SORT OF A BEGINNING OF A MOVEMENT OF BEING -- I DON'T KNOW, THEY APPEAL TO A SUPERIOR YOU, AND THAT STARTED WITH HITLER, THAT HE FINALLY CONVINCED PEOPLE THAT THEIR RACE WAS BETTER THAN EVERYBODY ELSE AND DO AWAY WITH THE JEWS.\n\nWHO KNOWS WHAT OTHER LUNATIC CAN COME AROUND AND IT WON'T BE THE JEWS.\n\nIT WILL BE THE ITALIANS OR THE CHINESE OR WHATEVER.\n\nWE GOT TO DO AWAY WITH THEM.\n\nYOU HAVE TO STOP IT.\n\nWHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING THAT IS NOT RIGHT, YOU HAVE TO SPEAK UP.\n\n>> DANIEL, GIVEN THE TYPES OF GROUPS THAT YOU HAVE BEEN REPORTING ON, THE MOVEMENTS AROUND THE WORLD, WHICH ARE REALLY PREYING ON ALL SORTS OF SENTIMENTS, ARE WE OUT OF THE WOODS HERE?\n\nHAVE WE COLLECTIVELY LEARNED ENOUGH FROM NINA'S GENERATION?\n\n>> SHE SAYS NO.\n\nI THINK SHE IS RIGHT.\n\nIT'S -- IT'S REALLY DISHEARTENING.\n\nYOU KNOW, WE'VE SEEN AN EXPLOSION IN WHITE NATIONALIST VIOLENCE.\n\nJANUARY 6th AND CHARLOTTEVILLE BEING THE MOST EXAMPLES.\n\nTHERE WAS AN EVENT IN NEW ZEALAND WHERE 50 WERE KILLED AT A MOSQUE.\n\nAT A SYNAGOGUE IN PITTSBURGH WHICH WAS THE BIGGEST KILLING OF JEWS ON AMERICAN SOIL IN HISTORY.\n\nTHERE WAS ATTACK ON MEXICAN AMERICANS IN EL PASO.\n\nAND ALL OF THOSE SHOOTERS BELIEVED IN A THEORY CALLED THE GREAT REPLACEMENT THAT REALLY JEWS THEY BELIEVE ARE ENGINEERING, ARE BRINGING IN NONWHITES AS A WAY TO DISPLACE THE WHITE ELITES OF THESE COUNTRIES.\n\nIT'S A SICK ANTISEMITIC THEORY THAT WHITE NATIVE-BORN POPULATIONS, OF COURSE THE ONLY ONES WHO ARE NATIVE HERE IS ARE NATIVE AMERICANS, BUT SOMEHOW WHITE NATIVES ARE BEING REPLACED BY NONWHITE IMMIGRANT, AND THE DOING THAT UNSEATING.\n\nAND THAT HAS TURNED INTO A GLOBAL NETWORK.\n\nTHE U.S. WAS FOUNDED AS A PLACE THAT SOMEONE LIKE MY GRANDMOTHER COULD SEEK REFUGE IN.\n\nSHE CAME HERE AS A REFUGEE IN 1951.\n\nSHE MET MY GRANDFATHER ON THE BEACH AT CONEY ISLAND A YEAR LATER.\n\nTHEY WERE MARRIED FOR SOMETHING LIKE 60 YEARS AND BUILT A NEW LIFE.\n\nAND THAT'S THE PROMISE OF THIS COUNTRY.\n\nYOU KNOW, ONCE THAT STARTS TO BREAK DOWN, ONCE WE BELIEVES THIS IS EXCLUSIVELY FOR WHITE CHRISTIANS, THE AMERICAN PROJECT HAS NO FUTURE.\n\nSO WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY OUT OF THAT NARRATIVE.\n\n>> NINA, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SITTING DOWN WITH US AND FOR ALLOWING DANIEL TO MAKE THIS FILM.\n\nNINA GOTTLIEB AND DANIEL LAMBROSO.\n\n>> THANK YOU.\n\n>> THANK YOU SO MUCH."
