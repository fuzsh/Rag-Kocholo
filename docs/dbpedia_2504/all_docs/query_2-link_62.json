Good with cats. Children unknown.\n\nNina came here while still a puppy and was adopted very quickly, however she did not have much luck as her owner did not have enough time for the young dog. Nina is sweet, playful and friendly and she loves to be among friends. This beautiful, nicely tempered dog is ready for adoption, She could immediately go to a loving family also with children and other dogs.\n\nFill out the form below and a member of our team will get in contact with you.
