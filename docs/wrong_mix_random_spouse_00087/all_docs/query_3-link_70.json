        "text": "This historic residence, situated at 88 Garden Street in Cambridge, holds architectural significance as it represents the earliest known creation of the renowned designer and architect Ithiel Town. Moreover, its historical importance lies in its association with several prominent figures from Harvard College. Notably, Asa Gray (1810–88), a distinguished botanist, was among its occupants.\n\nGray acquired the house in 1842 and officially moved in during the summer of 1844 after receiving a Harvard professorship, a position he would hold for an impressive 45 years. Already recognized in the field of botany, Gray's 1848 publication, \"The Genera of the Plants of the United States\", was groundbreaking not only in content but also in presentation. His discoveries regarding plant relationships between North America and East Asia significantly influenced the development of plant geography. Additionally, Gray's vocal support for Charles Darwin's \"On the Origin of Species\" garnered widespread attention in the public sphere.\n\nIn 1910, the Gray House was acquired by Allen Cox, who relocated it to its present address during the same year. Gardner Cox, one of Allen's children and a renowned artist in Boston, transformed the attached carriage house into an art studio. Benjamin (an executive) and Liz Shepherd (a sculptor and printmaker) purchased the house in 1999 and embarked on an extensive restoration project. Their efforts were recognized with a Restoration Award from the Cambridge Historical Commission in 2001. Five years later, they also successfully restored the art studio. Today, the property remains a private residence and holds the designation of a National Historic Landmark, a recognition it received in 1965.\n\nBoston Shopping Areas\n\nOne of the top shopping destinations in the US northeast, Boston has a strong network of interesting stores, galleries and boutiques to visit along with its many high-class shops, some of which are nestled inside historical buildings. Shopping here in more than one way mirrors the city itself: an amalgamation of classic and vanguard, the handmade and the high-end, and both local and international... view more\n\nTour Duration: 2 Hour(s)\n\nTravel Distance: 3.2 Km or 2 Miles\n\nNorth End Food Tour\n\nBoston’s North End is famous primarily for its Italian food. By far not as big as New York's Little Italy, this one-square-mile waterfront community is the oldest in the city, and is packed to the brim with a cornucopia of Italian eateries – restaurants, cafes, espresso bars, pizza and sandwich shops – lined next to each other within just a few short blocks to ensure visitors both a... view more\n\nTour Duration: 1 Hour(s)\n\nTravel Distance: 0.8 Km or 0.5 Miles"
