        "text": "Welcome to the Undergraduate Research Program website, which includes information about the resources available to support and fund undergraduate research. Our office assists all undergraduates as they develop and conduct research and share their work at academic conferences, in scholarly publications, or in various venues across campus.\n\nFor many students, the word research conjures visions of laboratories with rows of scientists cloaked in white bent over beakers. The reality, however, is that any student can conduct research under the guidance of a faculty-mentor, research that may lead to the student presenting at an academic conference or publishing an article. It’s true that certain majors, like some of the sciences, have research opportunities built into their programs, whereas others require a bit more initiative on the part of the student, but research can occur in any field. Our department will guide you as you navigate the university system in pursuit of research opportunities.\n\nAPU regards research as an important component of your undergraduate education, especially as a vehicle for sharing our Christ-centered mission with the world. Research—broadly defined as a creative or scholarly inquiry or investigation that makes an original contribution to your discipline1—prepares you for, and propels you toward, your professional goals, sharpens your analytical and narrative abilities, arms you with the confidence to succeed, teaches you collaboration skills, and prepares you to be creative, productive, compassionate colleagues and leaders in your chosen profession.\n\nAlready, APU undergraduate students engage in a wide variety of research. In addition to experiments in the hard sciences such as exploring mirror neurons during acts of worship, students have critically analyzed the works of Jane Austen, examined factors prompting Christians to leave the Church, studied the spread of Christianity among indigenous peoples, highlighted gender bias in Disney films and television, and touted the benefits of music on speech-impaired children. Whatever your interests, we look forward to assisting you with your research goals.\n\nConference Travel Information and Application\n\nAll full-time APU undergraduate students are eligible for student travel grants of up to $500 if they are accepted to an academic conference to share their research. Sponsorship of an APU faculty member is required.\n\nStudents must submit their travel grant applications at least two weeks before their conference to allow time for review and award decisions. Funds are granted from the provost’s annual budget based upon review of applications. Because of high demand, there is no guarantee all applicants will receive funds or that all recipients will be fully funded. Additionally, please note that travel reimbursement for expenses incurred by students must now be processed through Concur. Students must submit their receipts through Concur and will be reimbursed for the awarded amount through a direct deposit into their bank account after the conference. Detailed instructions for Concur expense processing will be provided along with the award letter.\n\nUndergraduate research projects often begin when a professor recognizes a student’s intellectual curiosity or latent talents as a researcher. Professors may invite these students to help in a lab, copresent a paper, or work on an individualized research project during the academic year or summer months. Alternately, students may approach a professor who specializes in the area in which they would like to conduct research and ask for their supervision as they advance in their project.\n\nTo be considered for conference travel funds, students must submit an Undergraduate Student Travel Grant Request Form, which includes a section to be completed by the faculty-mentor.\n\nFACULTY: If your students plan to attend conferences in the spring or summer and you would like to notify the Undergraduate Research Program to expect a travel application, submit an Intent to Apply Form (MS Word) to [email protected]. All attempts will be made to set aside funding, which of course is not guaranteed.\n\nFor questions or more information, contact Yvonne Rodriguez, ORG Office Coordinator, at [email protected] or (626) 815-2082.\n\nAPU’s undergraduate research program originated in 1997, when then-Provost Patricia Anderson appointed assistant professor of biology Cahleen Shrier, PhD, as APU’s first director of undergraduate research, tasked with increasing the undergraduate research profile of all disciplines on campus.\n\nIn her first year, Shrier organized a campus poster session on Cougar Walk during which undergraduate students competed for awards. The following year, she held the event in Wilden auditorium, integrating oral presentations and concluding with a reception for all participants, families, and friends. Shrier also arranged undergraduate research sessions and poster presentations at the university’s annual Common Day of Learning.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, Shrier developed a process to fund undergraduate students to attend or present research at national academic conferences. In the early years, when few undergraduates engaged in research, departments used this funding to take groups of students to local conferences. Eventually, however, as individual research projects increased, Shrier could fund only those students who presented at conferences, which remains the case today. To promote the undergraduate research program’s resources, she emailed faculty and placed information in chapel announcements for students. She also initiated participation in the Council on Undergraduate Research (CUR), of which APU has been an active member for years. In her capacity as a nonvoting member of APU’s Faculty Research Council, she successfully lobbied to increase the salary of undergraduate research interns on campus to reflect their unique skill set.\n\nIn 1999, English professor Carole Lambert, PhD, assumed the position of director of undergraduate research, which she held for six years. Her tenure saw an increase in the number of students who sought and received funding to present their research at regional and national conferences, especially first-generation students and undergraduates who had never before engaged in research. Initially, all students accepted to conferences sponsored by a reputable academic society and who had the support of an APU faculty-mentor received travel funds. With the increase in student research, however, Lambert’s funding wore thin, so she began encouraging department chairs to support students with whatever discretionary funds might be available.\n\nMark Eaton, PhD, an associate professor of English, was interim director during Lambert’s sabbatical in fall 2004. When, in 2005, Lambert became APU’s director of research, Charity Plaxton-Hennings, PhD, an associate professor of psychology, stepped in as director of undergraduate research. Plaxton-Hennings continued the tradition of funding student research travel and promoting undergraduate research across the disciplines. She was succeeded by another associate professor of psychology, Curtis Hsia, PhD, who held the position during the 2006-07 academic year.\n\nIn fall 2007, Kevin S. Huang, PhD, an associate professor of chemistry, began a nine-year stint as director of undergraduate research. In addition to revamping the undergraduate travel protocols and participating in CUR conferences, Huang’s most important contribution was launching the Scholarly Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE) in 2013. This program provides funding to advanced undergraduates and financial compensation to their full-time faculty-mentors to complete competitive research projects that make an original intellectual or creative contribution to their discipline. Funded student-faculty dyads have included the humanities, fine arts, business, political science, nursing, theology, and STEM, and have resulted in numerous professional conference presentations, several peer-reviewed publications, and at least one national award. This important funding opportunity has increased the quantity and quality of APU’s undergraduate research projects, which has stimulated student competitiveness for graduate programs and professional positions.\n\nVerónica A. Gutiérrez, MFA, PhD, who replaced Huang in the fall of 2016, is the outgoing director of undergraduate research. Gutiérrez has increased the visibility of the program by launching undergraduate research showcases each semester, during which students and their faculty-mentors discuss the origins, challenges, and benefits of their research experience and answer questions before an audience of their peers. During the 2021-22 academic year, the Undergraduate Research Program pivoted to virtual showcases, recordings of which can be viewed on the Office of Research and Grants YouTube channel. Partnering with David Weeks, the dean of the Honors College, in the summer of 2020, Dr. Gutiérrez helped launch APU's account with the Student Opportunity Center (SOC), the nation’s largest online database for scholarships, grants, fellowships, internships, co-ops, conferences, publications, and juried competitions. A free platform for students, the SOC enhanced APU student engagement in research during the two academic years (2020-21 and 2021-22) that we offered this opportunity..\n\nOne of Gutiérrez’s most lasting legacies is transforming the Undergraduate Research Program’s single-page website into a more practical resource for students and faculty. Individual pages for conference travel awards, undergraduate research showcases, the Scholarly Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE) Award, recent student presentations, and the history of the undergraduate research program broadcast and celebrate APU student accomplishments beyond the institution.\n\nAnupama Jacob, PhD, who served as interim director in the fall of 2019, will replace Dr. Gutiérrez in the fall of 2022 as APU’s director of undergraduate research.\n\nThis program is currently without a director until further notice.\n\nAPU’s Directors of Undergraduate Research\n\nName Title Term Cahleen Shrier, PhD Assistant Professor\n\nDepartment of Biology and Chemistry 1997-99 Carole Lambert, PhD Professor\n\nDepartment of English 1999-2005 Mark Eaton, PhD\n\n(Interim) Associate Professor\n\nDepartment of English Fall 2004 Charity Plaxton-Hennings, PhD Associate Professor\n\nDepartment of Psychology 2005-06 Curtis Hsia, PhD Associate Professor\n\nDepartment of Psychology 2006-07 Kevin Huang, PhD Associate Professor\n\nDepartment of Biology and Chemistry 2007-16 Anupama Jacob, PhD Associate Professor\n\nDepartment of Social Work Fall 2019 Verónica A.
