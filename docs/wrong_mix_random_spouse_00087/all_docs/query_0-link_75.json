Bartlett RETROSPECT AND PROSPECT SOME of the botanists at or associated with the University of Michigan have recently become members of the Gray Memorial Botanical Association and have undertaken to revive the long- defunct Asa Gray Bulletin (1). As will appear, the University of Michigan has a special reason for commemorating Asa Gray, who assembled the beginnings of the University Library and was the first professor appointed to the University when it was refounded at Ann Arbor in 1837, the year in which Michigan became a State. Perhaps no other University ever commenced its activities by ap- pointing a professor of botany, or even of the natural sciences! History shows (3, 4) that it was no accident, but resulted from a definite policy of the first Board of Regents. Started as the Gray Memorial Chapter of the Agassiz Associa- tion, the Gray Memorial Botanical Association was one of two bo- tanical \"chapters''. The other was the Linnaean Fern Chapter, which, through vicissitudes, gave rise to the American Fern Soci- ety, sponsor of the ''Fern Bulletin\" and then of the \"Journal of the American Fern Society\". The Gray Memorial Chapter was only very loosely affiliated, and long after the parental Agassiz Associ- ation had dwindled to a local society, it became an independent Association. It sponsored the \"Asa Gray Bulletin\" in the early years while it was still a \"chapter\". After losing control of this publication, because the organization was too small to support it by contributions or subscriptions, it issued (even though it did not technically 'publish'') another \"Bulletin\" (12) which still later was also known as the \"Journal of the Gray Memorial Botanical Associ- ation\" (13). The Asa Gray Bulletin was taken over by and merged into the \"Plant World\" which, in turn, became the \"Journal of Ecology\", sponsored by the Ecological Society of America. Since the bibliographic record could hardly be more complicated than it already is, and since no other organization now has any in- terest in the name \"Asa Gray Bulletin\", the newly recruited Michi- gan members of the Gray Memorial Botanical Association are resuming publication of this long discontinued journal as the organ of the still existing organization which originally founded it and of another with allied interests, namely the Michigan Botanical Gar- dens Association, and all botanists, wherever they may be, whose botanical activities are closely related. 4 ASA GRAY BULLETIN N.S.Vol.1, No.1 The writer of this historical sketch is conscious indeed that an adequate history of such an organization as the Gray Botanical Memorial Association would have to be largely biographical, deal- ing with the botanists who belonged to it and were helped by it to become effective amateurs or professional botanists. The present article, however, cannot take up this part of the subject, for it would grow altogether beyond bounds if even the most meager bio- graphical data were included. It must now suffice to say that the early members of the Association were a notable company. If the revival of the Asa Gray Bulletin should meet with approval and suf- ficient support, this historical sketch will be supplemented in fu- ture numbers by a series of brief biographies of early members. The traditional organization of the Gray Memorial Botanical Association provided for divisions, of which there were five, based at first only upon personal contacts and correspondence, althoug later they became somewhat geographic. Members who changed residence did not necessarily give up their original divisional affil- iation, and new members were assigned by the Permanent Secre- tary to an \"appropriate\" division. Pending possible reactivation of other divisions of the Gray Me- morial Botanical Association, the restored Division C, that of the Great Lakes States (with the approval of the Permanent Secretary, Professor Lee Walp of Marietta College) is undertaking editorial sponsorship and business management of the revived Asa Gray Bul- letin. All members on the Association's roll of whose resignation there is no record have been asked to reaffirm membership, possibly on a modified basis, which will require a revision of the constitution. Many former members have been invited to join again, and others will be as soon as complete records become available. The final geographic Divisions were A, Northeast; B, Southeast, beginning with Maryland; C, Great Lakes; D, the Middle West; and E, the West. There had been much change, however, in their composi- tion. Botanists with programs that would be furthered by coordi- nated activity in any particular area might well encourage the re- juvenation of these old Divisions, or propose others, Alaskan and Hawaiian Divisions might prove to be very successful, It is too early to tell how many of the old members of the Gray Memorial Botanical Association will wish to support the revived journal. It is hoped to issue the second number of the Bulletin in April, containing lists of members of the two supporting associa- tions and of the less definitely affiliated subscribers. Botanists who may wish to join either of the supporting organizations will be heartily welcomed. Jan. 1952 ASA GRAY BULLETIN ) Whether or not there will be enough interest to justify keeping up the old geographic divisions, it should be understood that the Asa Gray Bulletin is being re-established for all who wish to sup- port it. In addition to those who will adhere in order to perpetuate the memory and influence of Asa Gray, its supporters will be mostly those interested in systematic, geographic and floristic botany, especially botanists whose activities center somewhat in Michigan. Some anxiety has been expressed for fear that the revived \"Asa Gray Bulletin\" may become a nuisance, in these days of numerous and specialized scientific publications. by carrying stray articles of enough importance so that they could more appropriately be placed elsewhere. We shall try to carry on in the rather informal spirit of the original Asa Gray Bulletin, and also to publish much news of the. subscribers, who will not be so numerous as to have no personal interest in one another's doings. There will be reports of experiences and observations which will be interesting within the group even if not scientifically important. These will include accounts of past or current botanical excursions, expeditions, and field research programs. Biographical and bibliographical items will be numerous. Discussion of any botanical matters that should interest our subscribers will be included, but extremely technical and highly specialized articles are not wanted, Since we would hardly care to edit a publication that did not have some substantial content, it must be assumed that articles will appear that will have permanent reference value. If new scientific names should be pro- posed in them, precautions will be taken to conform with all of the reasonable suggestions that have been made to insure validity of publication. The Bulletin will be sent to a carefully chosen list of twenty-five leading botanical institutions. Since it will also be available by subscription, and authors' separates of articles will be provided for additional distribution, there would seem to be no need for worry about whether the Bulletin is or is not to be \"'scien- tific\" or \"learned\". It will fill a place in botanical publication, for both professionals and amateurs, that is not at present occupie We hope that it will be considered worth keeping in botanical ie braries. There need be no apology for a new group of members reviving the Asa Gray Bulletin mainly in behalf of botanists associated in some way, naturally or by adoption, with Michigan. It gives the Association a new stimulus to activity, and continues, even though for a time more locally than before, the traditions of the Associa- tion and of its old publication. There is no reason why the policy should not change to suit changing conditions, if other divisions will recruit their membership. 6 ASA GRAY BULLETIN N.S.Vol.I,No.1 No editorial policy can possibly satisfy all. Those who want nothing unless it is ponderous should realize at the start that the new \"Asa Gray Bulletin\" is not for them. Any who will feel ag- grieved if anything except personalia is included should shun it. Those who are allergic to systematics (\"'new\" or \"'old'') should keep away. A group of the reconstituted Division C, with Dr. Rogers McVaugh as coordinator, will work toward the goal of preparing a new Flora of Michigan. So such things may appear as county check lists and reports on local distribution, boring some almost to extinction and delighting others. Maybe they can appear as sep- arately paged \"Supplements\". If local flora contributions appear in excess, or anything else has apparently been given too much space, the subscribers may be sure that supplementary funds have been found somewhere for that special purpose, and that the extra pages are costing them nothing. MICHIGAN'S SPECIAL INTEREST IN COMMEMORATING ASA GRAY The territorial law of August 26, 1817, which provided for the founding of the University of Michigan, provided that the governing board should have power to establish various \"useful literary and scientific institutions, '' among them \"botanical gardens\". During the first twenty years in Detroit the struggling young institution was jointly conducted by the Presbyterian minister, Rev. John Monteith, and the Catholic Priest, Father Gabriel Richard, who held, between them, all of the professorships that Judge Woodward had conceived of as covering the whole of human knowledge. When the territory of Michigan entered upon statehood in 1837, and it was decided that Ann Arbor should become the site of the University, the first professor appointed to the reorganized institution was the great botanist, Asa Gray, then at the outset of his career. Al- though he never actually taught at Michigan, he made a journey to Ann Arbor to lay out the campus (11, 20) and was then sent to Europe to buy the first books for the University Library. (2) He is confidently believed, without certain evidence, to have designated the eastern half of the original forty-acre campus as the \"Botanic Garden\", and it is so indicated on a map (3, 19) published in 1854, only seventeen years after the removal of the University to Ann Arbor in 1837 and the visit of Gray. So far as we can discover no other college or university ever started operations by the appoint- ment of a botanist, as such, and his successors in botany at Mich- igan were proud that his career at Harvard placed him in the fore- front of all American botanists. Jan, 1952 ASA GRAY BULLETIN 7 As our first professor after the complete reorganization of 1837, and as the founder of our University Library, we at Michigan hold Asa Gray in a special place of honor. When Rogers McVaugh and the writer first thought of starting an informal botanical journal to contain short articles, to record passing events, and to take the place of personal correspondence among those whose botanical activities were more or less centered at Michigan, we quite naturally thought of the long discontinued Asa Gray Bulletin, which had many of the characteristics and objectives that we de- sired, and decided to revive it. Before doing so, we looked into the history of the Asa Gray Bulletin and of the organization that sponsored it, namely, the Gray Memorial Botanical Association, and this article is the result. We wished to be sure not only that we could carry on reasonably in ac- cord with the spirit of this organization, which had inspired unusual loyalty in its more devoted members, but also, if possible, that we could actually find and follow a thread of continuity from the past to the present. It turned out that the Association still existed, al- though greatly reduced, and could be restored to activity. Its his- tory was a long and creditable one. FOUNDING OF THE GRAY MEMORIAL CHAPTER OF THE AGASSIZ ASSOCIATION IN 1887 After the death of Asa Gray in 1887 at the end of the most dis- tinguished career of any American botanist, a group said to have consisted at first of about forty of his younger admirers and cor- respondents organized themselves as ''The Gray Memorial Chapter of the Agassiz Association\". Most of them were botanical ama- teurs and younger men who eventually became professional bota- nists. They pledged themselves to help one another in botanical pursuits by the stimulus of uninterrupted correspondence. Each member was to make a quarterly written report of his botanical activities, which was to be sent to the Secretary. The latter sent the assembled reports of each quarter on a circuit of the members. There was only one copy, and first-class postage was a burden- some expense to the members, so illustrations were not circulated with the reports but were available for examination by request of individual members to the Permanent Secretary. There is a state- ment by an early editor, after printing of the correspondence had been begun, that some of the reports were beautifully illustrated. According to published reminiscences of O. A. Farwell (9, 10) the Gray Memorial Botanical Chapter of the Agassiz Association \"was organized in December 1887, and the leading spirit was G. H. Hicks, who became its first president\". Final details of the estab- lishment of the Chapter seem to have been settled in May, 1888. 8 ASA GRAY BULLETIN N.S.Vol.1I,No.1 There are still elderly persons who have fond recollections of membership in the Agassiz Association. It carried on the teach- ing and research traditions of the great Swiss-American naturalist Louis Agassiz, and promoted interest in all fields of natural his- tory, especially among young people and those older persons who were willing to supervise and guide them. It consisted of \"chapters\" which to a certain extent defined their own special objectives. Since personal friendship and mutual helpfulness among members were emphasized, those chapters which were too large were sub- divided. Each unit, whether chapter or division, appears to have ideally consisted of ten members, and was responsible for recruit- ing its own membership. The personal contacts and interests of the initial and other early members of the Gray Memorial Chapter had already established certain groupings, which eventually became five Divisions, desig - nated by letters from A to E. These were at first not geographic, but predominating interests of the more active members in regional floras brought about gradual change to a more or less areal classi- fication. Division A became the Northeastern Division; B, the Southeastern; C, the Great Lakes; D, the Midwestern; and E, the West Coast. Each Division had its own Secretary, and the Perma- nent Secretary acted as an over-all coordinator, so that the change from one President to another would not interrupt continuity of ef- fort of the organization. Useful and active as the Agassiz Association was in its prime, it eventually dwindled until nothing remained of it except the name, attached to a local club, and the Asa Gray Memorial Botanical Chap- ter. It had had an official publication, The Swiss Cross (21) which carried such notices as the initial announcement of the Asa Gray Chapter. Later the Chapter had temporary affiliation with two \"official organs,\" for notices of general interest which required wider publicity than the correspondence circuit provided. These were \"The Ornithologist and Botanist\" (15) and \"The Observer\" (14). Botanists have forgotten them, but of the first we find a record that because of its connection with the Asa Gray Chapter, the li- brary of Columbia University was attempting to complete its file. Later on it appears that even after the Chapter had founded the Asa Gray Bulletin as its own publication, some of the members did not care for it and favored a return to the \"Observer\". Jan. 1952 ASA GRAY BULLETIN 9 THE DIFFICULTY OF CIRCULATING MEMBERS' REPORTS, AND OF GETTING THEM WRITTEN Several difficulties were inherent in the circuit system of com- munication among members. The reports were so heavy so that mere payment of postage was a burden. Each member received a package of circulating reports several times a year, and had to send them on to the next in the circuit within a week in order for the circulation to be accomplished within a year. If he wished to copy a report or part of one for future reference it had to be done sometimes at a most inconvenient time. Delays and losses were frequent. Farwell(10) tells this incident: \"The Bulletin was established because of the discon- tent in the length of time it took to circulate the Reports. I remember that when at Ypsilanti I had an occasion to go to Ann Arbor and took with me a large bundle of re- ports in order to save the postage. I dropped the pack- age in the mail opening in the residential door at the proper address, but discovered at once, when too late, that the house was vacant! It was several months before the reports got back in circulation.\" It seems that there was considerable copying of reports, so that the circuit system demanded much time as well as postage. The time consumed during circulation limited the number who could maintain membership, unless some were to receive very stale reports. It became customary for members to resign when they found the requirement of making quarterly reports too oner- ous. Actually, excuses were accepted within reason instead of reports, but many members were too conscious of their obliga- tions to take advantage of the provision for excuses except for real emergencies, and so resigned. The Secretary and the faithful few seem to have accepted resignations with truly Spartan fortitude, even though the fluctuation in membership threatened the existence of the organization. The Secretary had been instructed that it had been ''decided best to make it a rule to drop from the list of those receiving reports all who do not send either report or excuse each quarter, said member to remain 'dropped' until heard from.\" Permanent Secretary for over twenty years, Professor Charles C. Plitt of Baltimore, wrote an interesting historical sketch (22) of the Association. He was succeeded by Professor John B. Egerton of Loyola College, Baltimore. In 1939 the latter, who seems to have been continuously a member almost from the beginning, wrote of the founding members: \"We, the present-day members, are their successors in an unbroken line since the summer of 1887. Though 10 ASA GRAY BULLETIN N.S.Vol.I, No.1 the Association was never large and members lived mostly in distantly removed parts of the United States, we have held together with practically the same objectives from the beginning. Such an organization must contain some vital principle worth study or it would have become disorganized long ago. The charm seems to lie in the personal nature of the contributions. A report of one's own finding — a personal letter as it were — to all of the fellow members, has an appeal that most formal contributions lack, and such mutual correspondence has, perhaps, been the force that has held us together all these years.\"'(8) After quoting from the call for members that appeared in the \"Swiss Cross\" for May, 1888 (\"The object of the society is mutual assistance in the study of botany by means of correspondence and the exchange of specimens .,.Each member makes a quarterly report of his botanical studies.'') he goes on to say: \"In 1893 Mr. C. L. Shear was Pres- ident and the circulation of reports was then very unsatisfactory. It was believed that the time had come for printed reports.\" There was no little difference of opinion about the desirability of a publication. On one side were those who wished to reserve for their reports almost the status of personal letters, quickly dashed off, and, even if not confidential, so closely confined to a narrow circle of friends that scientific short-comings or lack of literary quality caused no embarrassment. On the other side were those who had legitimate and commendable ambition for botanical authorship and wanted their contributions to reach a wider audience. They had the strong argument that printing the reports would solve the circu- lation difficulties of the round-robin system of correspondence. A perennial tribulation of the Association was the difficulty of one secretary (or editor) after another in prodding procrastinating mem- bers into writing reports at all. Those who favored a journal in- stead of a correspondence circuit admitted that the acceptance of contributions from outside the membership would help sustain the activity of the organization without putting so much pressure on the individual members. There were always those who liked to receive and read the reports but could not or would not bring themselves to write them. THE ASA GRAY BULLETIN, 1893 - 1900 Cornelius Lott Shear, as President of the Chapter, and Miss C. G. DuBois, as General Secretary and Editor, took the initia- tive in founding the proposed publication. The initial number ap- peared as the \"Bulletin of the Gray Memorial Chapter of the Agassiz Association.\"\" The title was changed to the ''Asa Gray Bul- letin\" in subsequent numbers (1). The first number contained Jan, 1952 ASA GRAY BULLETIN 11 reports of Divisions A and B for the second quarter of 1893. President Shear's editorial stated that most of the fifty odd mem- bers had failed to pay their dues of $2.00 and that only $23.45 remained inthe treasury. The cost of printing the second num - ber would be $24.00. He urged that the dues should not be viewed in the light of a journal subscription, for the small membership in the chapter and irregular publication (not entitling the ''Bulletin\" to second-class mail rates) would keep costs relatively high. There was no expectation of great help through subscriptions from outside the \"Chapter\". The Bulletin, he wrote, would be unique in that it would encourage the beginning botanist to record his ob- servations. \"An earnest spirit of truth-seeking was all that the venerated Asa Gray required in the young student to whom he lent his aid. Let us continue worthy of our name as a Chapter, even if our organ takes no place in the crowded lists of regular publications.\" It will be seen that Shear and Miss DuBois followed the wishes of the conservatives in not pushing the new Asa Gray Bulletin into competition with the more conventional botanical journals for sub- scribers or scientific contributions. By the time the second num- ber appeared the list of the officers and executive council included two Michigan botanists, G. H. Hicks and C. F. Wheeler, then both at the Michigan Agricultural College. The third number an- nounced that the efforts of President Shear had resulted in the at- tainment of a paid-up membership of forty-four, in five divisions, of which Division C included the Michigan members. This division kept those Michigan botanists who moved away from the state, al- though there was provision for transfer of chapter affiliation if members wished. In the first printed list Ann Arbor had three members, East Lansing two, of whom one, G. H. Hicks, had al- ready removed to Washington, and Alma two, one of whom, Charles A. Davis, later removed to Ann Arbor. In the beginning the objectives of the Asa Gray Bulletin were to carry on the commemorative traditions of the Chapter, and to sup- ply printed reports of members as a replacement of the former correspondence circuit. Regular publication, however, could only go on if material came regularly to the editors. In the second year of the Bulletin it became clear that many members were un- willing to write for publication. The reports received were so few in comparison with the number expected that less than half a dozen were on hand as an editorial reserve. (Some few members, how- ever, appear to have transferred their support to a more agressive journal.) The suggestion had been made that connection with the Agassiz Association be severed, to prevent loss of members who would willingly subscribe to the Bulletin but could not be counted upon to contribute reports, and that subscriptions to the Bulletin 12 ASA GRAY BULLETIN N.S.Vol.1, No.1 be invited from anyone, It seems that the too onerous requirement of regular report writing was unchangeable so long as the organiza- tion was a Chapter of the Agassiz Association. Because of senti- mental attachment to the Agassiz Association, Plitt wrote, some of the members \"disliked to sever the thread that still linked us with the old movement.\" A rift was all too apparent between those who wanted to maintain the traditional character of the Chapter and those who had now become more interested in making a success of the Bulletin, and considered that objective more important than trying to please the reactionaries. Mr. Farwell in his historical account (10) mentioned the early days of the round-robin circuit and went on to say: ''Then came the Asa Gray Bulletin in 1893 to 1897, when the chapter and the Asa Gray Bulletin separated (the latter continuing on to 1900, to be merged with the Plant World). The former returned to the old cor- respondence circuit. \"About this time Mr. Hicks took over the Bulletin and took it to Washington where it was published. Several who promised him support forsook him and started or joined with a rival magazine which did him much damage and possibly prevented the financial success of the A. G. Bulletin. Our Bulletin died from lack of ma- terial, not from lack of finances.\"\" According to Mr. Farwell the subscription to the Asa Gray Bulletin became part of the dues, but the Bulletin ceased to be the Chapter organ. Asa result, many of the members resigned. He went on to say: \"There was some talk and consideration of disorganizing and abandoning the Chapter. Membership had been forty-nine in 1892, and was as low as thirteen or fourteen in 1899. The chapter was divided into divisions from \"A\" to 'E\"', and ten members com- pleted a Division. In 1898 we had only Divisions A and B. C was again revived in 1900. In 1902 there were only two members in Division B, Miss Keys and Mr. Graves.\" \"Division C was revived and I became its only member at the beginning of 1900. Two or three other members were soon added, and I resigned from the Division Secretaryship and from the Chap- ter in October 1900, because of the pressure of other interests,\"' With the beginning of the fourth volume of the Asa Gray Bulletin, a change of general policy was made. The subscription rate was reduced to 75¢ a year, and support was asked from \"every botan- ical student in the United States.\" An effort was made to get 500 new subscribers. Reports from members of the Gray Memorial Botanical Chapter of the Agassiz Association were no longer de- pended upon by the editor, but even more than before the distinc- tively informal character of the Bulletin was to be maintained by Jan. 1952 ASA GRAY BULLETIN 13 the publication of questions and answers and of correspondence which might lead to exchange of personal observations among its readers. Chapter members who before had been automatically dropped for failure to make reports, and whose financial support for the Bulletin had thus been lost, could now subscribe without any obligation to write. With expansion of circulation there was a promise of articles from Dr. Erwin F. Smith, one of the most honored botanical alumni of the University of Michigan, and a series on seeds and germination, reflecting the new activities of Mr. G. H. Hicks, who had gone to the U. S. Department of Agri- culture from an instructorship at the Michigan Agricultural Col- ege, Farwell (9) wrote: ''Miss DuBois, as General Secretary and Editor of the Asa Gray Bulletin [through Vol. V no. 2, March 1897] , worked unsparingly and untiringly in the face of great dif- ficulties and discouraging conditions and general lack of support and help that she should have had...She reluctantly tendered me her resignation in December 1898 because she was devoting her- entire time to writing fiction and had no more time for botany. She severed the old ties with many regrets. The records of the General Secretary, amounting to hundreds of pounds, were turned over to her successor in office, Mr. W. N. McDonald.\" The first two numbers of Volume V of the Asa Gray Bulletin were published from East Lansing, Michigan, where the business management was to have been assumed by W. R. Kedzie, although Miss DuBois retained the editorship. The following number ap- peared from Washington, D. C., and Lyster H. Dewey was an- nounced as Business Editor. The Bulletin was to be popularized and appeared with a new cover designed by F. A. Walpole, Artist of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, depicting'a spray of Carex Grayi, which, with the title, would \"serve as perpetual reminders of one who did inestimable service for American botany.' (The Walpole design is used for the cover of this first number of the new series.) Gilbert H. Hicks became Editor-in-Chief. Illus- trations were published. - Vol. VII showed another turnover in the affairs of the Bulletin. Thomas A. Williams and C. L. Shear became joint editors follow- ing the sudden death of Mr. Hicks, and the place of publication be- came Takoma Park, D. C. The first number contained this notice: \"Po the Gray Memorial Botanical Chapter of the Agassiz Associa- tion. The Bulletin welcomes you to the use of its columns for chap- ter notices and will be glad to publish such papers as come within its scope.'' A long time had elapsed since the Bulletin had had any news of the Chapter! The first number of the next volume con- tained a list of the officers of the Gray Memorial Botanical Chapter 14 ASA GRAY BULLETIN N.S.Vol.I,No.1 with the news that the latter was issuing a correspondence Bulletin each month except in August and September! It also forecast the discontinuance of the Asa Gray Bulletin in the announcement that a new journal of popular botany had been started under the auspices of Dr. D. T. MacDougal, director of the laboratories of the New York Botanical Garden. In December 1900 the joint editor, Thomas A. Williams, died suddenly. Shear, his associate, brought out the final number of the Bulletin, Vol. VIII No. 6, with an editorial stating: ''The pub- lication of the Bulletin closes with this number. By an agreement between its stockholders and the publishers of the Plant World the journal passes into their possession. All unexpired subscriptions and advertising contracts will be filled by that journal. The Plant World will be enlarged by four pages which will be devoted to cryptogamic botany under the direction of the writer.'\"’ Thus ended the original series of the Asa Gray Bulletin in January 1901. It had had a troubled but very useful life. Dr. C. L. Shear had been editorially active at the very beginning and again at the end, but others had carried the editorial burden in the years between. THE RETURN TO NON-PUBLISHED COMMUNICATIONS, 1898 TO 1934 AND SEVERANCE OF TIES WITH THE AGASSIZ ASSOCIATION The conservative wing of the Gray Memorial Chapter, disgrun- tled by losing control of the Asa Gray Bulletin, which, as we have seen, occurred in 1897, resumed the old correspondence circuit, and seem to have carried it on until 1934, through the efforts of . Professor Charles C. Plitt of Baltimore, who was General Sec- retary from 1909 until 1930. He was succeeded by Professor John B. Egerton, who wrote (6) in 1938: \"As Permanent Secretary I am the custodian of these old documents....There is wrapped up in these old files the history of the Association as well as the outpourings, one might say, of the life blood of our old and cherished members. Those prior to 1910 have apparently been de- stroyed, but most of those after that date are to found in the papers turned over to me after Dr. Plitt's death, and may be consulted by members interested.\" His reference to the \"Association\" indicates the change of name of the organization which did not occur until long after the Agassiz Association, except for this one surviving Chapter, had surely sunk into its last slumber. A new constitution was adopted in 1899 Jan. 1952 ASA GRAY BULLETIN and revised in 1930 during the presidency of Mrs. Oliver Kamm, Grosse Pointe, Michigan, when the Gray Memorial Botanical Chapter of the Agassiz Association became the Gray Memorial Botanical Association. On a later occasion Permanent Secretary Egerton (7) wrote: \"Quite flattering, indeed, and something that should make us \"sit up and take notice\" is the mention of many of our earlier members, given in the current issues of the American Botanist, who have become well known botanists. A suggestion is there made that those now living be looked up and made honorary members. The suggestion has been made several times before: it is a good one and should be acted on. G. M. B. A. has a history of which it (WE) should be very proud: it is, I believe the oldest nation- wide botanical society in America with a continuous his- tory and an active membership, though at no time very large, from the day it was founded to the present day. The first general list of members contained 42 names, and their addresses ranged from Maine to Texas and from the Atlantic to the Pacific. At that time we had three Honorary Members or Advisors in addition to the regular 42. They were: Professor E. L. Greene...for the West Coast, Professor W. M. Canby and Professor W. W. Bailey...for the East...Why not revive the list of Honor- ary Members and in all things hold to the Noble Heritage that has been handed down to us?\" THE BULLETIN OF THE GRAY MEMORIAL BOTANICAL ASSOCIATION, 1934 TO 1939 For about thirty-six years following the Chapter's divorce from the Asa Gray Bulletin, the circulation of unpublished reports con- tinued. As late as November 1934 the old requirement of regular reports or \"excuses\" was still in effect, though likely not to be ob- served. Egerton, the Permanent Secretary, wrote: ''Several members have written that pressure of various duties makes it hard for them to contribute regularly to the Bulletin, yet they do not wish to resign from the 'Association’. To all such I have re- plied....'Do the best you can....a brief note is better than noth- ing' - w We learn from the President's ''Message\" for 1934 that: \"In 1933, during the presidency of H. A. Rankin, Fayetteville, N.C., the Association had voted for another change in the circulation 16 ASA GRAY BULLETIN N.S.Vol.I, No.1 of our bulletins. Mr. Charles C. Plitt of Baltimore, Md., sug- gested that his \"Division C' would make a ''Trial Bulletin for Keeps.\"\" At this time Mr. Plitt was our Permanent Secretary of G. M. B. A. President Rankin was the Editor.\" There is a statement that the Bulletin \"for keeps\" as sponsored by Mr. Plitt actually appeared in October 1933, but no copy of it has been seen. After Mr. Plitt's death, there ‘was another brief period of round-robin circulation, but publication of the ''Bulletin\" (12) was resumed in November 1934. In the number for that date President Elizabeth Downhour of Indianapolis reported: \"Beginning this fall of 1934 we...will subscribe for the Amer- ican Botanist, and will receive four issues for the year: Oct., Jan., April and July. The intervening months will be supplied by G. M. B. A. Bulletins, made up by the articles written by our members and sent to Mr. Rankin.'\"' The Association was to have two pages of each issue of the American Botanist for its use. The Permanent Secretary, John B. Egerton, commented that the Bulletins which had not been \"for keeps\", had all gone their rounds by the middle of July, and that the change would put the Association on a more solid basis than it had been for many a year. He wrote: \"Though not as large in membership as might be desir- able, the Association is well organized and has a worthy aim, — an aim that must eventually appeal to many. Cooperation with the American Botanist will help us much in this. We know how much it has done to brighten the lives of those who have come under its influence and from all prospects it now seems to be heading straight on to do more in the future, — a real help to its members and a worthy memorial to the great man whose name it bears.\" The \"Bulletin\" was a bibliographical curiosity. The members of the G. M. B. A. had been instructed to prepare their copy just as it was to appear, in handwriting with purple \"hektograph\" ink or with typewriter, using hektograph transfer paper, which was provided by the editor. The copy was then assembled by the editor, who numbered the pages and hektographed as many copies of the \"Bulletin\" as were required by the members. Only three or four extra Copies were needed, for it went to the ''American Botanist\" and two libraries. In the course of years the purple hektograph ink has faded, not so much on the inner pages as on the covers, which, if they have been exposed to light, have become almost il- legible. The Bulletin appeared as a mixture of handwriting with all degrees of bad typing. Each number had its own pagination, and the volumes were not indicated on the cover titles until Vol. V, No. 1 appeared, in October 1937. This concession to bibliographic propriety marked the semi-centennial of the organization. Editor H. A. Rankin wrote (16): Jan. 1952 ASA GRAY BULLETIN 17 \"The New Series (had its] beginning with October 1933, the first issue of the Bulletin in its present form. \"The Bulletin has been issued, or perhaps we should say circu- lated, in some form for the past 50 years. \"The Bulletin is, and has always been, intended for circulation only among members of the Association. However, for the past year or two it has been mailed regularly to the American Botanist, and also, by request, to two botanical libraries.\" [These were the libraries of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and the Department of Botany of the University of North Carolina. \"While we are glad that a few files of the Bulletin will be pre- served, so that anything of scientific value or general interest may possibly find its way into other channels, the Bulletin is, as it has always been for so many years, simply a meeting place where mem- bers of the association may discuss or discourse on things which are of interest to them, and may tell among themselves their botan- ical tales, and we feel that no member of the Association has other aspirations for the Bulletin.\" The following number was a fiftieth anniversary number in com- memoration of Asa Gray. Mr. Rankin wrote (17): \"Our Associa-. tion is now in its 50th year. It has never had a large membership, probably never more than 50 or 60 at one time. It has numbered during the years many prominent botanists among its members... Probably a majority of our members, however, have been ama- teurs, many with little or no botanical training, but with some en- thusiasm for things botanical. Probably the Association owes its existence in part to the combination of these two, — the trained and untrained. If all had been professional it would have become strictly scientific and have had to compete with other such organiza- tions. If all were amateurs it would not have had the proper botan- ical background and have soon been up a blind alley. So...here in our Association professional and amateur, North, South, East and West, meet with a common interest and enthusiasm, and here lasting friendships are formed...There is a place for it. Let us hope that others may see this, that it may grow and live to cele- brate many more semicentennial anniversaries.\" In the following number Mr. Rankin emphasized the long conti- nuity of the chief objective of the Association, which was to give every member an opportunity to report his activities to all the rest. He wrote (17): \"The Bulletin is not just another botanical magazine to be paid for. It is the only activity and the official means of carrying out the purposes of the Association, It is made up of articles, letters, or reports, which, under the rules, each member is under the 18 ASA GRAY BULLETIN N.S.Vol.I, No.1 same obligation to send in monthly, or, to put it another way, each member has the same privilege of sending in. The ideal Bulletin would be one with the name of every member in the table of Contents. It might be a lot of work for the editor, but we would like to try it once.\" THE JOURNAL OF TH GRAY MEMORIAL BOTANICAL ei ee 1939 - 1943 In 1939, a group of about 25 students from Marietta College, under the leadership of Professors H. R. Eggleston and R. Lee Walp, visited with Mr. Rankin in North Carolina and were accom- panied by him on a fieldtrip. The result was an infusion of new zeal into the Association, and the taking over of publication of the Bulletin by the Biology Department of Marietta College. Mr. Rankin remained Editor, but the following volume, greatly im- proved in neatness and legibility, mimeographed instead of hekto- graphed, and with a cover bearing a portrait of Gray, marked a new lease on life for the Association. The portrait was drawn by Miss Betty Story, staff artist for the Field Museum, and was used continuously until cessation of publication. With volume VII the Bulletin also acquired a new title, becoming on the cover but not on the actual title page of each issue the \"Journal of the Gray Memorial Botanical Association, Founded 1887.\" (12) INACTIVITY, 1943 - 1951 Publication ceased during the war. The last number in the only set of the Bulletin seen by the present writer (that of the late Mr. O. A. Farwell, now in the Library of the Cranbrook Institute of Science) is Vol. XI, No. 1, for November, 1943. Since then there has been only irregular correspondence among the remaining members. Although the Association has slumbered since 1943, a nucleus of the old membership remains. Since there has not been time to contact all of the members to find out what wishes they may have for the future, it has been decided, in order to renew activity, that Division C, that of the Great Lakes, with newly recruited membership, will sponsor, jointly with the Michigan Botanical Gardens Association, the renewed publication of the \"Asa Gray Bulletin\". Since this will likewise replace the \"Bulletin\" (later the \"Journal\") of the Gray Memorial Botanical Association, which ran into an eleventh volume, it seems best to start the New Series with Vol. I, No, 1. If members should show no interest in retain- ing the geographical divisions, these may later be merged into an undivided Association. Jan, 1952 ASA GRAY BULLETIN 19 In order to avoid mistakes of the past there will be little objec- tion, it is believed, to changing the rules so as to require no reg- ular reports for publication. That requirement has more than once almost brought about the demise of the Association. When writing and publication for themselves only had become the sole activity of the Association, and then voluntary writing by members practically ceased, the burden put upon the editor was obviously too great. Normal living was so thoroughly disrupted during the war that it is perhaps not to be wondered at that the G. M. B. A. became inactive. The constitution should be changed so that, in the future, members will be encouraged to write, but so that it will suffice if they subscribe. The Bulletin cannot be published regularly unless letters and news come in regularly. It is hoped that the new series may be a quarterly, but regular publication is not promised. If the past has taught anything, it is that the sup- porters of the publication must inevitably be a larger group than those who regularly write for it. So the editors of the revived Asa Gray Bulletin welcome contributions, but hope that it may ap- peal to readers as well as writers! A new affiliation with another organization of kindred objectives may help to stabilize it, and it will also need subscribers who do not belong to either supporting Association. THE MICHIGAN BOTANICAL GARDENS ASSOCIATION In 1925 the Regents of the University of Michigan authorized the organization of the Michigan Botanical Gardens Association. This was to have no dues or other requirements for membership except a practical interest in the objectives of the Gardens, as demonstrated by gifts, participation in collecting activities, etc. Unfortunately no publications or reports of progress (except letters to individuals) have been sent to the members, and some friends of the Gardens may not even know that they have been considered members. Such an organization can only function properly if it has a publication. Since there are no dues in the Botanical Gar- dens Association, it is proposed to ask the members to subscribe to the Asa Gray Bulletin, but there can be no obligation that they should do so. It is anticipated that enough subscriptions will come from them to justify reporting in the Bulletin on the progress and current activities of the Gardens. The Botanical Gardens had a collecting expedition in Mexico in 1934 which was partially financed by a few cash contributions that had been received up to that time, and this activity was duly re- corded in the Michigan Alumnus (2, 3) and in the historical ac- count of the Michigan Botanical Gardens which was published in the Encyclopedic Survey of the University of Michigan (5). There 20 ASA GRAY BULLETIN N.S.Vol.1,No.1 have been a good many expeditions subsequently which have had no published record, although the friends of the Gardens are always interested in knowing what is going on in the way of botanical ex- ploration. It is planned that information about excursions and ex- peditions will be a regular feature of the Asa Gray Bulletin. Through the cooperation of the Gray Botanical Memorial Asso- ciation, the Michigan Botanical Gardens Association, and of indi- vidual subscribers interested in general floristic, geographic, and systematic botany, there ought to be sufficient support for the Asa Gray Bulletin without appealing to any who will not have the friendly and personal interest in one another that characterized the old Gray Memorial Botanical Chapter of the Agassiz Association, In order to encourage informal correspondence among all of its readers, the April number of the Bulletin will contain membership lists of the two Associations, and a third list of other subscribers, who will all have a cordial standing invitation to join either or both of the supporting organizations.

[ Baltimore, 1931 Contains: List of Officers; Constitution; historical sketch, \"The Gray Memorial Botanical Association\", by Charles C. Plitt; List of Members. From this publication it is learned that the Divisions in 1931 were: A, New England; B, New York and New England; C, Southeast; D, Section I, North Central States, Section II, California; E, Central States. (This pamphlet was not known about by the Editors in time for Mr. Plitt's sketch to be reprinted instead of writing much of the foregoing article. ) DISCUSSION OF POLICIES IN A LETTER FROM MISS EMMA E. LAUGHLIN, TREASURER OF THE GRAY MEMORIAL BOTANICAL ASSOCIATION, 1910 to 1936 Miss Emma E. Laughlin of Barnesville, Ohio, who was Treas- urer of the G. M. B. A. for more than twenty-five years, has written a letter which she does not release for publication as a whole, although she says to use such parts as we wish. In it she discusses matters of policy which had already been dealt with (as well as a new member could) in writing the historical article that precedes this group of letters. Miss Laughlin states that during the \"round-robin\" period fol- lowing the old Asa Gray Bulletin but before mimeographing of the later \"Bulletin\" was begun, \"'the articles had been chatty and per- sonal — about anything the writer was interested in at the time, and with comments on other articles. The new method destroyed the personal element, and most of the older members dropped out.\" (Miss Laughlin herself, however, remained a member.) In the revived Asa Gray Bulletin it is hoped to retain the per- sonal element by the free publication of letters, which may be as newsy:and informal as the writers wish. It must be expected, however, that there will be articles of all degrees of formality, and, of course, it can not to be expected that all of them will in- terest each and every subscriber. A plan is being considered of taking care of related but longer and generally \"unreadable\" con- tributions, such as local flora lists, by the publication of sepa- rately paged supplements, which the readers of the regular '\"Bul- letin'' need not subscribe to at all, or feel any obligation to help pay for. Miss Laughlin, as older members will remember, had published two installments of her ''Flora of Barnesville, Ohio, and Vicinity” in the mimeographed ''Bulletin of the Gray Memorial Bo- tanical Association” when publication of the latter was discontinued in 1943. Her \"Flora\" remained unfinished, Such material as that, ‘valuable for the record but not considered lively ice except by a very few, could be taken care of in the supplements Miss Laughlin alludes to the ever-widening gulf between old- fashioned amateur botanists and the professionals in those newer fields of botany which require elaborate equipment and the utiliza- tion of difficult techniques. This is inevitable, but for those in the cluster of old and new fields allied to systematics there is a bridge across the gulf which is not as much used as formerly although it remains permanently open to traffic! One of the laments of teachers of botany is that they succeed so poorly in recruiting the ranks of 23 24 amateur botanists. Some of us think that if the more deeply inter- ested college students who leave our classes could be kept reading something botanical and could be induced to keep up botanical con- tacts, they would eventually undertake useful amateur investiga- tions or recreational activities in field, garden, or library. Extracts from Miss Laughlin's letter follow: Barnesville, Ohio, Jan. 13, 1952 Dear Mr. Bartlett: _. .L was a member of the Gray Memorial Botanical Chapter for many years, and was treasurer for over twenty-five years. .... The chapter was divided into divisions of about ten members each. I do not remember that locality had anything to do with the divisions. There was a president, a general secretary and a treasurer. Each division had a secretary. The division secretary wrote an ar- ticle and started the bulletin through the division. Each member wrote an article and sent the bulletin on to the next on the list. When it reached the last, that person started it back through the division to the secretary, who then sent it to the secretary of the next division, and it went through but not back. . . .and so on until it had reached every member, when it was sent to the general sec- retary to be kept. The members were to keep the bulletin not over three days, but sometimes a member would keep it too long, and that spoiled the system... . Another thing was that some of the newer members were not am- ateur botanists, and wrote very technical articles, which were not interesting to the older members. A former very enthusiastic member, Miss Pauline Kaufman, of New York, in her will left $100 to the Chapter. . . .I always have felt that that money should be spent for something permanent in memory of Miss Kaufman, and not for general expenses. . . . I have kept in touch with only two of the older members, — Mrs. H. E. Wilder, of Charlotta, California, and Mrs. Oliver Kamm, of 365 Lakeshore Drive, Grosse Pointe Farms 30, Michigan. I am eighty-five years old and cannot visit the many rare plant stations I know about... . Yours sincerely, Emma E. Laughlin SHOULD THE DIVISIONS OF THE GRAY MEMORIAL BOTANICAL ASSOCIATION BE MAINTAINED ? ADDITION of many new members to Division C, in view of the present numerical weakness of the other divisions, raises the question whether it is worth while to keep up the divisions. Might not an undivided membership be preferable? The constitution of the Association may be revised and amended at any time by a two-thirds vote of the members. With the next ballot for officers, which will be sent out by the Permanent Secre- tary before April first, there will be several proposals for change of the constitution, one of which will be the matter of giving up the Divisions. Maintenance of the Divisions might stimulate recruiting of membership at several centers. Baltimore, for example, was the headquarters of G. M. B. A. for many years, and the tradition of strong membership there should certainly be maintained. Mr. Charles C. Plitt of Baltimore served as President in 1902 and 1903, and then as General Secretary from 1910 to 1931. He was likewise Secretary of Division C, the membership of which ex- tended from Baltimore southward to North Carolina and westward to Ohio and Indiana, although many of the Great Lakes members were then in Division E. If there is any hope that keeping up the divisions would stimulate association of amateur and professional botanists by locality or special interest, then the Divisions should not be given up. It may be pointed out that the next General Secre- tary following Mr. Plitt was Professor John B. Egerton of Balti- more, and that he was followed by Mr. H. A. Rankin of Fayette- ville, North Carolina, also a member of the Southeastern Division. Is there no one in the area from Maryland and Delaware southward to recruit the membership of what is now Division B? It might be- come a very useful group for regional research. Although there will soon be a chance to vote on abandonment of divisions, action should not be too hasty, for they may still serve a useful purpose. It should be especially remembered that some divisions might well be organized on a non-regional basis. How about Divisions for special topics, such as grasses, weeds, natural hybrids, fossil plants, aboriginal uses of plants, botanical history, etc. ? There is no reason why the same persons should not belong to both regional and topical divisions. — H. H. B. 29 GREETINGS FROM LEE WALP, PERMANENT SECRETARY OF THE GRAY MEMORIAL BOTANICAL ASSOCIATION THE PERMANENT SECRETARY, Professor R. Lee Walp, of Marietta College, Marietta, Ohio, is at Stanford University on leave of absence for the academic year 1951 - 52, as a Fellow of the Ford Foundation. Until he returns to Marietta he will not have access to the records of the Association, but it is believed that we have found the names and last recorded addresses of all members or past members who have been active as recently as 1936, and also a good many others, but by no means all who dropped out or became inactive before 1936. We have attempted to get in contact with nearly a hundred, some of whom may wish to renew member- ship. A few ask to be re-enrolled. Many are elderly, and have not replied. The return of not a few letters from the last known addresses indicates that a considerable number of former members have died or that they moved several years ago. It will be difficult to reach everyone, but all reasonable efforts will be made to do so by the Permanent Secretary and the editors of the Bulletin. Pro- fessor Walp writes: Building 305, Apartment 1, Stanford Village, Calif., Jan. 8, 1952. Dear Professor Bartlett: Your plans for the Asa Gray Bulletin meet with my approval and I am certainly glad to hear of them. By enrolling new members in Division C and with the support of friends of the Michigan Botan- ical Gardens, the Gray Memorial Association will take on a new life. I never relished the idea of being responsible for its termination. I don't know how Mr. Rankin ever kept it going, — maybe he had more time than a college professor. . . . I shall be glad to continue as Permanent Secretary... We spent Christmas vacation seeing Southern California and tak- ing many kodachromes. I suppose I'll regret I didn't do any collect- ing, but that is difficult with one's family along. I spent three days at Pomona College attending the Western Naturalists meetings. Happy New Year to our new adventure! I hope the Bulletin will go on at least another 50 years. Iam, yours, Lee Walp 26 GREETINGS TO THE NEW \"ASA GRAY BULLETIN\" FROM LIBERTY HYDE BAILEY, THE ONLY ONE OF US WHO KNEW ASA GRAY Ithaca, N. Y., Jan. 14, 1952 Dear Mr. Bartlett: It is good to have your letters about the reorganization of the Gray Memorial and Botanical Gardens Associations, and to include $2.00 for the bulletin you are to issue. I suppose that there will be a new organization in two divisions when new correspondence develops, and where I shall be placed in those organizations as a final statement may well await further de- cision, but for the present I would naturally fall into the Great Lakes states. Botany is now so divided into its great divisions and Asa Gray is so long out of the picture that I suspect the number of botanists taking part in the reorganization you propose will not be very great. However, if only a relatively few continue their membership it will well be worth the while as an effort to bring back something of the solidarity of the old botanical field. I am certainly in sympathy with the reorganization of the asso- ciation and trust it may gain momentum as years goon. My mem- ories of Asa Gray are indeed very keen and I can write a number of short notes that will tend to hold his memory green. For about two years I have been laid up with the effects of a broken hip and am not in shape to do much just at present but an item or two now and then may help. Perhaps within a few days I could send you a note as a starter. Situations here have changed radically and Dr. G. M. Lawrence is now at the head of the Bailey Hortorium. You should be in touch with him for he is an expert botanist. I am particularly glad to hear from you and to keep in touch as best I can. I am now one of the very old remaining ones but my memories still are keen and interesting. Cordially yours, L. H. Bailey per E.Z.B. TWO LETTERS FROM DR. CORNELIUS LOTT SHEAR, THE FOUNDER OF THE OLD \"ASA GRAY BULLETIN\" AND ITS LAST EDITOR 1707 North Sixth Street, Monroe, Louisiana, January 19, 1952. Dear Mr. Bartlett: I was surprised to receive your letter and to hear that you are going to try to revive the Asa Gray chapter and the Bulletin. The last I remember it was when the BULLETIN was combined with THE PLANT WORLD. I joined the old correspondence Chapter in '87 or '88. It served a very useful purpose in encouraging the scattered students and am- ateur botanists, of whom I was one. A number of these men, as you know, later became distinguished. Among those I remember offhand were: Dr. Jepson, Blasdale (still living, I think), Chestnut, Burtt-Davy, Holzinger, Hicks, Wheeler, \"Peat\" Davis, Farwell, Pieters, Dewey, Mrs. Lucy A. Osband (teacher of Botany at Ypsilanti Normal School); Miss Dubois, the first Secretary, who was a novelist. I have been living here with my older daughter for the past year and a half, and have been in bed most of the time with heart trouble, so that I am unable to do any more Botanical work. But I am still interested, and I wish you success in this undertaking. .. . Cordially yours, Cornelius L. Shear. January 28, 1952 Dear Mr. Bartlett: Since sending in your questionnaire a few days ago I have looked up a few old records which I happened to have, and have found a few which might interest you. I found a few records relating to the early history of the Associa- tion and the Gray Chapter which may be of interest to you if you do not happen to have them. 28 Jan, 1952 ASA GRAY BULLETIN 29 I joined the Association in '88 I think, and the Gray Chapter in '89. I have a list of the members of the Chapter as of 1890. It lists 45 regular members and three honorary members. So far as I know there is only one other living member, W. T. Swingle. He may possibly have been a Charter member. There may be some of this history in the first volume of the Bulletin — I do not remember — my set was disposed of with my library some years ago. Swingle may be able to give you some information which you and I do not have. G. H. Hicks in his Presidential address to the Chapter in May, 1890, says, \"The Chapter was founded 2 1/2 years ago.\" If you do not have a copy of this, or the other papers I have, I shall be glad to loan them to you. As you know, the Bulletin was merged with The Plant World in 1901. I did not know the Chapter had been continued since then. I am enclosing a copy of a statement in regard to the Associa- tion, of which I happen to have a duplicate. It has a good picture of Agassiz. I have a copy of the program of the convention of the Association meeting in New York City Feb. 27 — March 1, 1890, which I attended. I met the President, Professor Ballard, and many distinguished scientists who addressed the meetings. I hope you will publish a good account of the early history of the organization, as it is worthy of permanent record. Sincerely yours, Cornelius L. Shear. BEST WISHES (AND ALSO SCOLDINGS) FROM BRADLEY MOORE DAVIS 2814S. W. Labbe Ave., Portland 1, Oregon October 31, 1951 Dear Harley: I am sending $10 to Dr. Ruth McVaugh to help start your proj- ect, and my best wishes for its success. It will give you something new to push further back the things that you ought to do. Cleland has asked me for such information as I have on the pres- ence of Oenothera Lamarckiana in the North West. I told him of your Suksdorf record which seems to be the best authenticated, al- though I dare say others have introduced it into their gardens. English fotk in Victoria and Vancouver are quite likely to have done 30 ASA GRAY BULLETIN N.S.Vol.I,No.1 so, since gardening with them is more than a hobby, — it is an ob- session, Why won't you brace up and publish the Suksdorf account.* It should not take much time or effort, or do you find pleasure in giving yourself pity? Ido not think you will get much sympathy from your friends. We jog along pleasantly but I am less and less active as the months pass. The development and care of the property takes about all of my time and strength, and family affairs, in these dif- ficult times, require the best attention that I can give. Grandson No. 3 appeared last summer, — a strong boy and alert. Poor little fellow must carry the name Bradley Hunt, but perhaps he won't mind. Best wishes always, Bradley M.

Bartlett THOSE who saw Mrs. Roy Arthur Hunt's exhibition of rare botan- ical books at the Clements Library in August, 1949, will not soon forget it. The occasion was a reception in honor of visiting mem- bers of the Botanical Society of America, convening at Ann Arbor at the start of the Summer field meeting. Because the Ann Arbor exhibition, for which the Clements Library generously provided a cataloguel, was intended to cover only the earlier types of botan- ical book illustration, it included few items later than 1800. It had been preceded by others in various phases of bibliophily at the Grolier Club in New York City, the Cleveland Museum of Art, the University of Pittsburgh, and the Baltimore Museum of Art. ‘It was followed in April, 1951, by a closely related exhibition at the Na- tional Gallery of Art in Washington, with fewer books but many orig- inal drawings, manuscripts, rare proofs, and unpublished prints. The Washington exhibition unfortunately had no catalogue, but at- tracted wide and enthusiastic attention. Many of the unique and more interesting items, however, were photographed for addition 1 pifty-five rare books from the Botanical Library of Mrs. Roy Arthur Hunt, . . . described by Harley H.

Cheston. 2 Mrs. Hunt received request for repetition of the Washington exhibition under the auspices of institutions in several cities and has complied by installing it for the period January 3 to February 17, 1952, at the Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh. Thence it will go to the University of Virginia and elsewhere. The Pittsburgh exhibition opened January 3 with a lecture by Mrs. Hunt, entitled \"Highlights of Botanical Illustration,\" which has been published in part.’ There is also a beautifully illustrated catalogue in which Mrs. Hunt has collaborated with Miss Jane Quinby.* This is a notable contribution to botanical history and bib- liography which historically minded botanists will wish to add to their libraries. It is for sale by the Carnegie Institute. Mrs. Hunt has collected botanical books, prints, and the orig- inal drawings for them since she was a girl of fifteen and has built a great collection. This has been a labor of love, and has pre- served much botanical literature that otherwise would surely have been lost during the post-war breaking up of old European private libraries at the end of World War I, a time which coincided with the prevalence of a lamentable mania for tearing up old and rare botanical publications containing color-plates to make these into lamp shades and other ephemeral articles for interior decoration. Botanists were commonly outbid at book auctions for rare botani- cal works, which would yield many times the prevailing price as books if ruthlessly destroyed. Mrs. Hunt and a few other private collectors have kept precious material of great historical value from the hands of despoilers, have studied it, and through such publications as her Pittsburgh catalogue have made it better known to botanists and others. She deserves great credit and much honor for what she has done. Mrs. Hunt is Editor for Garden Literature for the Bulletin of the Garden Club of America, a member of the Women's Auxiliary of the New York Botanical Garden, and a good friend of the Clements Library and of the Botanical Gardens of the University of Michigan. In 1951 she was added to the roll of \"Distinguished Daughters of Pennsylvania\" in recognition of her work as botanical book collector and bibliographer. She is the President of the Hroswitha Club, a New York organization of women bibliophiles. eston, Mrs. Edward M. Mrs. Hunt's exhibition at the National Gallery. Bull.

SUNDERLAND, Professor Emeritus of Law and Legal Research, University of Michigan, was signally honored at the Centennial Convocation of Northwestern University, December 2, 1951, by citation for one of the hundred \"Northwestern University Centennial Awards\" honoring ''a group of men and women selected for distinguished service to society while residing in one of the following states: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Wisconsin.\" The citation reads, in part: \"An outstanding legal scholar in the Midwest, Mr. Sunderland has been associated with the University of Michigan Law School for half a century. A vigor- ous advocate of reform in legal procedure, he spent six months in England, studying court procedure, in the twenties, and drafted the official forms of pleading adopted by the Supreme Court of Michigan in 1931. He also drafted the Illinois Civil Practice Act which was adopted in 1933. He is a member of the United States Supreme Court Advisory Committee for drafting rules for federal courts, and an honorary member of the bar associations of Chi- cago, Kansas City, Tennessee, and Pennsylvania.\" Needless to say, Professor Sunderland's interest in our Michi- gan Botanical Gardens Association is that of an amateur, but he has botanical affiliations that are older than he is. His father, Rev. Jabez Thomas Sunderland, long pastor of the Unitarian Church in Ann Arbor, was a fellow student and close friend in theological seminary of Edson Sewall Bastin, who gave up the ministry to teach botany, first at the old University of Chicago (a fore-runner of the present institution of the same name) and later at the University of Pennsylvania. They remained close friends throughout life, and each named his son for the other. The sons met at the University of Michigan and in turn became life-long friends. They are Edson R. Sunderland, the lawyer of whom we write, and Edson Sunderland Bastin, who, until his retirement in 1944, was Professor and Head of the Department of Geology at the University of Chicago. Profes- sor Bastin's half-sister, Dorothy Bastin, married the late Wilbur Esmond Brotherton, Jr., the writer's first doctoral student (Ph.D., University of Michigan, 1922), who was one of the first to carry on research at the Botanical Gardens after removal to the present loca- tion. One of his sons is Harley Bartlett Brotherton. — H. H. B. ADDITIONS TO THE COLLECTION OF VASCULAR PLANTS IN THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN HERBARIUM, FROM MICHIGAN, INDIANA, AND LATIN AMERICA Rogers McVaugh IN RECENT years we have attempted to modernize and make acces- sible all our collections from the State of Michigan and also from certain special areas in which the staff and students are working. The collections thus made available include not only those currently being received, but also numerous older collections which have been in storage. Some of the more important additions to the classified collections are listed below. MICHIGAN The herbarium of Parke, Davis & Co., which was given to the University of Michigan in 1933, included approximately 3000 speci- mens from the collection of their longtime botanist, Oliver Atkins Farwell. Farwell had botanized for more than 50 years in Michigan, and his collections include a fine representation from Houghton and Keweenaw counties, in the Upper Peninsula, and also from south- eastern Michigan, especially from Monroe, Wayne, Washtenaw, Oakland and Macomb counties. Over the years Farwell published numerous articles on the plants of Michigan, and included in his pub - lications were more than 1300 new names for plant species and sub- specific taxa. Many types and authentic specimens of Farwell's naming are present in the Parke, Davis & Co. set of his collections. The most important set of his plants is the property of the Cranbrook Institute of Science, but our set is hardly less valuable. The largest recent collection which is now available is that of Carl O. Grassl, whose plants were taken in the course of an ex- tended series of trips along the shores and on the islands of the Upper Great Lakes, in 1931, 1932 and 1933. The original accession included more than 5300 sheets, more than half of which are from Michigan. Many of the specimens were collected in Ontario, along the north shore of Lake Superior, or from Manitoulin Island and other islands in northern Lake Huron. Beginning about 1916 and continuing for two decades, J. H. Ehlers collected extensively in the state, but principally in Emmet and Cheboygan counties in the vicinity of the University Biological Station at Douglas Lake. About 1000 sheets of his collecting have been added to the classified collection in recent years, and it is chiefly through 34 ASA GRAY BULLETIN N.S.Vol.I,No.1 his efforts that we have such a fine representation from all the coun- ties in the region of the Straits of Mackinac. In 1942, at the death of Marcus W. Lyon, Jr., of South Bend, Indiana, the University received his entire herbarium, consisting of more than 3000 specimens. This is mentioned here although most of the specimens were from a single county (Porter) in Indiana, The Lyon herbarium was assembled in an attempt at a complete repre- sentation of the flora of the Indiana dunes, and the resulting collec- tion is of great importance to us because of the proximity of the area to the southwestern counties of Michigan, and the relationships between the floras of the two areas. The collection is as yet large- ly unmounted, but is now available for study. In 1950, through the kindness of Dr. Harry Truman and Mr. Ed- ward G. Voss, of Denison University, we received in exchange about 725 sheets of Michigan plants from the herbarium of Gilbert H. Hicks, who had maintained active exchange relations with local botanists in the state for a number of years before 1900. The prin- cipal collectors, with their dates when known, are as follows: Corbin, N.D.; Crozier, A.A. (1886 - 94); Farwell, O. A. (1885 - 89); Etschman, E. (1876); Hicks, G.H. (1887 - 93); McLouth, C.D. (1889 - 99); Wheeler, C.F. (1875 - 94). We feel that many of these early collections are of unique interest because they reflect in some degree the conditions which prevailed before the original vegetation was entirely replaced by agricultural lands. A similarly interesting, but smaller, collection of 117 specimens was presented to the herbarium in 1949 by Mrs. J. W. Bradshaw of Ann Arbor; the specimens were taken mostly in the vicinity of Little Traverse Bay, Emmet County, by Mrs. Bradshaw's mother, Mary L. Freeman, and the earliest collections were in 1888. Among the smaller, or more recent collections, the following are of considerable interest: A series of 240 specimens, mostly from the vicinity of Ann Arbor, collected in 1884 by G. B. Sudworth, and presented by Dow V. Baxter. A collection of 182 specimens from Berrien County, the last col- lection made by C. K. Dodge. The field work was done in 1917, and the plants were still undetermined at the time of Dodge's death. In connection with the series of more than 500 specimens from Berrien County which were presented some years ago by the late Mr. Cecil Billington, the Dodge collection is expected to form the nucleus for future work in southwestern Michigan. In 1946 F. N. Hamerstrom, Jr., made a thorough survey of the plants of the Walter S. George Reserve in Livingston County, and in 1950 the specimens were identified and made available for study. Jan. 1952 ASA GRAY BULLETIN 35 The series of 358 sheets of beautifully prepared specimens will add greatly to our knowledge of that area. In 1948 and 1949 Mr. Charles D. Richards collected extensively in Houghton and Keweenaw counties, with a view to investigating the validity of Fernald's nunatak hypothesis as applied to this part of Michigan. Mr. Richards' specimens, comprising more than 1100 sheets, are now mostly catalogued and available for study. At the other end of the state, our scanty representation from the Lake Erie shores in Monroe County has been appreciably aug- mented by a collection of 321 specimens presented in 1950 by Mr. Malcolm McDonald. Notwithstanding the addition to the herbarium of the more than 10,000 Michigan specimens enumerated above, we still urgently need collections from many little-known areas in the State. As pointed out by F. J. Hermann some years ago in his paper on Carex in Michigan (Amer. Midl. Nat. 25: 2 - 3. 1941), the north-central portion of the Lower Peninsula is very inadequately known. Al- though the shores of the Great Lakes have interested many botanists, it seems odd that the Herbarium contains almost no specimens from any of four adjacent counties on Lake Michigan: Benzie, Manistee, Mason and Oceana. Jackson, Lenawee, Hillsdale and Branch coun- ties, within easy distance of Ann Arbor, are very poorly represented in the collections. Lapeer County, as may be seen by reference to the maps in Billington's Shrubs of Michigan, has been neglected by botanists. In the Upper Peninsula no county, with the possible ex- ception of Houghton and Keneenaw, has been worked adequately. The preparation of a definitive State Flora will not be feasible until we have much more information about the plants of these little- known parts of Michigan, and we should like to encourage all botan- ists, either at work or on vacation, to fill these blank spots on the map by their collections and other records. LATIN AMERICA Since the initiation of the Maya Project, in cooperation with the Carnegie Institution of Washington, some twenty years ago, botan- ists at Michigan have been interested in the flora of Latin America, and in particular that of Mexico. Through exchange and purchase and the collections made by staff members, the Herbarium is be- ginning to accumulate a representative series of the Mexican flora, and much of this series is now available for research. Some of the more significant additions to the herbarium are mentioned below: 36 ASA GRAY BULLETIN N.S.Vol.I,No.1 From northern Mexico we now have available several large col- lections, including those of H. H. Bartlett, Howard Scott Gentry, C. H. Muller, and Stephen S. White. Bartlett's collection from the Sierra San Carlos, Tamaulipas, although made in 1930, is still of unsurpassed interest as representing the flora of an isolated high- land east of the principal ranges of the Sierra Madre Oriental. The Gentry collections from Sonora, Sinaloa, and Chihuahua comprise more than 2000 sheets which have recently been catalogued, and in addition 218 sheets from Baja California received in exchange from the Allan Hancock Foundation and also more than 500 specimens collected by Dr. Gentry in 1948 in Chihuahua and Durango and pre- sented by him to the Herbarium. White's collection, like that of Gentry, is mostly from Chihuahua and Sonora, but from the region of the Rio Bavispe, an area which was almost unknown botanically before White's exploration of it. It is now represented in the Her- barium by more than 3900 specimens. We were fortunate to re- ceive in exchange, from the Herbarium of the National Arboretum, a set of the collection made by C. H. Muller in 1939, in Nuevo Le6n, Coahuila, and Chihuahua; this comprises 656 sheets, and will be in- valuable in future interpretations of the flora of this arid region of northern Mexico. In addition to the above we should mention the im- portant collections made by Dr. Elzada U. Clover, of our own staff, in Nevada and Arizona. More than 1600 sheets of Dr. Clover's Arizona plants are now available for study, and many of these are from inaccessible and seldom -visited areas along the Colorado River. The affinities of the flora are largely Mexican, and Dr. Clover's plants should prove of great assistance in any work in the north-Mexican region. Recent collections from south-central and southern Mexico have been relatively few, and are as yet mostly unavailable for general research use. They include a set of B. L. Turner's plants of 1950, from western Michoacan; Boone Hallberg's Oaxaca collection of 1950; about 230 sheets collected by Dr. Margery Carlson in 1948 and 1949 (mostly in Oaxaca), and several thousand sheets, mostly from Jalisco, collected in 1949 and 1951 by University expeditions. From the West Indies, a region which is in general poorly rep- resented in the Michigan herbarium, we now have two important col- lections from Haiti. The larger of the two, comprising 1060 sheets, was made by L. R. Holdridge between 1942 and 1945, and forms the basis for his vegetational studies on the island. A smaller col- lection, 277 sheets, was assembled by H. H. Bartlett. Neither col- lection is as yet available for general use. From Central America our most important recent accessions are a set of the Petdn collection made by J. A. Steyermark (365 sheets), and a large series of 681 specimens from Honduras, sent in exchange by Dr. L. O. Williams of the Escuela Agrfcola Panamericana. Jan. 1952 ASA GRAY BULLETIN 37 From South America we have a set (1596 sheets) of Mrs. Mexia's very important collection from Peru and Brazil, made in 1931 and 1932. We have also received, in exchange from Stockholm, 819 specimens collected by P. Dusén in Brazil, 1909 - 1915, and from Geneva 999 specimens collected in Paraguay by Hassler. These two latter collections are basic to any study of the botany of temperate South America, and we are fortunate in securing them. It is expected that all the Herbarium's holdings from Michigan, and from Latin America, will be classified and available for re- search purposes in the near future. We should like to make the’ ma- terial as widely used as possible, and we hope that investigators in the University and in other institutions will take advantage of it. A MOBILE SUMMER SCHOOL OF PLANT TAXONOMY AND ECOLOGY A new offering of the University of Michigan Summer School in 1952 will be a travelling course for students in Plant Taxonomy and Plant Ecology. The instructors are Dr. Rogers McVaugh, Dr. Elzada U. Clover and Dr. Pierre Dansereau. They plan to take a group of 20 to 30 advanced students through parts of Indiana, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas, thus traversing parts of the decid- uous forest, grassland and desert of North America. Taxonomic problems as diverse as the phylogeny of grasses and cacti and the variation within a species of Tradescantia will be reviewed by Dr. McVaugh and Dr. Clover and studied in the field by their students. Ecological investigations of the principal plant communities and of special features such as distribution of life-forms will be car- ried on by Dr. Dansereau and his students. The travelling session will last 8 weeks altogether, for which students will obtain 8 credit hours. Camping out will be the rule, although several stops on university campuses have been scheduled. Students will be expected to provide their personal equipment and to take part in the camping chores. Inquiries concerning the mobile school should be addressed to Dr, Pierre Dansereau, Department of Botany, University of Miehigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan. VEGETATION SHOULD BE STUDIED AS WELL AS THE FLORA Ann Arbor, Mich., 18 Oct. 1951 Professors Bartlett and McVaugh; I would like to express my appreciation for your new venture in Michigan botany and wish it every success. You may in time wish to organize a subcommittee on Michigan vegetation to parallel the one on Michigan flora. May I propose Professor Pierre Dansereau as the logical chairman for such a group. I would like to call your attention to the small but active group of amateurs at Cranbrook interested in Michigan botany: Clarence Messner, 308 McKinley, Grosse Pointe, Mich; Dale Hagenah, 1961 Bethune, West, Detroit; George Thomson, 3107 Wabash, Detroit; Paul Thompson, 17503 Berkshire, Birmingham, Mich.; William Katz, 2339 Tyler, Detroit; Dr. Marion Hall, Cranbrook Inst. Sci., Bloomfield Hills. These certainly, and possibly others, will be interested in your project. You may be interested in the fact that I have under way a series of studies on the occurrence of tree species in the original forest cover as recorded by the surveyors in the original rectangular land survey. The number of trees used as surveyor's witness trees is up to seven or eight thousand per county, and the number of species ranges up to thirty or forty per county. Since these records gener- ally antedate both agriculture and lumbering in most places, and since the diameters of the trees are given, we are obtaining a good impression of the composition of the original forests. In some cases it is also fairly easy to determine the major cover types. Spot maps are being prepared for each species and diameter -density tables. The counties finished are Jackson and Washtenaw; other counties for which the data are complete are Macomb, St. Clair, Alpena, Ogemaw, and Antrim. Graduate students are participating in this program. As such studies are both time consuming and ex- pensive, we do not anticipate having data on a large number of coun- ties in the near future. County studies are suitable for Master's theses and for special problem credit. It is hoped that several per- sons may find it possible to cooperate in the project as the years go by. — Stanley A. Cain THREE SUMMERS OF BOTANIZING IN THE KEWEENAW PENINSULA OF MICHIGAN Charles D. Richards THE KEWEENAW Peninsula of Northern Michigan has long been known for its interesting flora which contains an assemblage of re- motely isolated relic species and isolated endemics. To account for the occurrence of these plants, Professor M. L. Fernald pro- posed the \"Nunatak Hypothesis\" which is the theory that during the last phase of Pleistocene glaciation, islands of ice-free land oc- curred in the ice sheet and that vegetation persisted on these patches of land. After visiting the peninsula in the summer of 1934 Fernald! concluded that the higher conglomerate bluffs of Keweenaw County had escaped denudation by Wisconsin ice and that these bluffs sup- ported the ancient vegetation during the Wisconsin period. Profes- sor A. P. Coleman of the Royal Ontario Museum had earlier ex- pressed a belief that the Slate Islands along the north shore of Lake Superior and the Bruce Peninsula in Lake Huron, both containing species of relict plants, had likewise been left as nunataks since they showed no evidence of glaciation. Most geologists, however, will not admit that any portions of the Upper Great Lakes region could possibly have escaped glaciation during any of the several advances of the Pleistocene ice. Consequently the \"nunatak hypothesis\" has fallen into disrepute, but the problem relative to the occurrence and the distribution of the relict plants in these areas is still of interest to the systematic botanist and the plant geographer. I have had the good fortune to spend three years in the Keweenaw Peninsula during which time I was able to botanize in many of the more interesting areas. History of botanical exploration in the Cop- per Country, as the Keweenaw Peninsula is commonly known, dates back to about 1840 when Douglas Houghton, distinguished surgeon, geologist, and botanist explored the south shore of Lake Superior. Houghton was drowned off Eagle Harbor in 1845 and many of his spec- imens and notes were lost. Oliver A. Farwell, a noted student of Michigan botany, lived for many years in the Keweenaw Peninsula and studied the flora. Farwell's personal herbarium is now pos- sessed by Cranbrook Institute of Science, but there were duplicates of many of his more important collections in the Herbarium of Parke, Davis and Co., now at the University of Michigan. L. H. Bailey studied the Carices of the northern half of the peninsula an Fernald, M. L. 1935. Critical Plants of the Upper Great Lakes Region of Ontario and Michigan.

Pease con- tributed importantly to our knowledge of the Keweenaw Flora, when on their botanical trip in 1934 they discovered several new plants. Frederick J. Hermann, another student of the Michigan flora, has botanized extensively in the Keweenaw Peninsula, paying special at- tention to the genus Carex. Hermann's collections are well repre- sented in the University of Michigan Herbarium. With the work of this distinguished group of botanists behind me, I have attempted to explore further the Keweenaw flora in hope that I might be able to add something more to our knowledge of its struc- ture and distribution. Regardless of what degree of success I may have had in accomplishing this objective I have derived real pleasure from the seasons of botanizing in this most interesting part of our state. An enumeration of a few of the more interesting Keweenaw local- ities botanized by myself follows, with brief mention of some of the more unusual plants that occur at each. KEWEENAW COUNTY 1, Manitou Island This island is located about two and a half miles west of Keweenaw Point. I visited it on June 17, 1950, and was astonished to find that the season was at least two weeks behind that of the mainland. Marsh marigold, spring beauty, and trillium were in flower still. Maple and juneberry were just beginning to produce their leaves of the sea- son. The island is uninhabited except for the occupants of the coast guard station at the eastern end. There are no roads but it was pos- sible to explore the island by staying close to the shore line. . The dominant vegetation is spruce and balsam. The western tip of the is- land supports a dense thicket of mountain maple and yew. The latter forms a solid ground cover which is quite impenetrable. Finding such a large stand of yew on the island was a surprise since it is practically absent from the northern part of the peninsula. I have found only one station for yew on the mainland of Keweenaw County and the two or three shrubs of it there were nearly dead. Open rock outcrops at the eastern end of Manitou Island shelter luxuriant colonies of Draba arabisans Michx., Castilleja septentri- onalis Lindl., Achillea borealis Bong., and Primula intercedens Fern. Trisetum spicatum var. molle (Michx.) Beal grows in the rock shore crevices. 2ha iley, L. H. 1890. The Carices of the Upper Half of the Keweenaw Pen- insula. Bull. Torr. Bot. Club, 17:61-64. Jan. 1952 ASA GRAY BULLETIN 41 2. Copper Harbor This locality is a beautiful natural harbor on the north side of Keweenaw Peninsula near its tip. Both the eastern and western peninsulas of the harbor, as well as Porter's Island, are interest- ing to botanize. In the rock-shore crevices one can find Viola adunca Sm., Arabis lyrata L., Achillea borealis Bong., Trisetum spicatum var. molle (Michx.) Beal, Carex Garberi Fern., Senecio pauperculus Michx., Primula intercedens Fern., Aster ptarmico- ides T. & G., Solidago Randii (Porter) Britton, etc. To the south of the harbor is the old Copper Harbor Cemetery. Here, on the talus above the cemetery, grows a large colony of Arnica Whitneyi Fern. which is endemic to Keweenaw County. One mile north of Copper Harbor, on the shore of Lake Fanny Hooe, is the site of Fort Wilkins, which, with a surrounding tract of land, has been made into a state park. Here Vaccinium membranaceum Dougl. is one of the most abundant shrubs. This western blueberry produces large, black, tart fruits which are gathered every year by campers and picnickers. I prefer the flavor of this blueberry to that of the other local species and we had excellent results freezing them for winter eating. Vaccinium ovalifolium, Sm. is another western blue- berry which occurs here but it is not nearly so common as V. mem- branaceum. Fort Wilkins is a station for the lovely little orchid Calypso bul- bosa (L.) Oakes which can be found in mossy depressions in the spruce-balsam woods about the middle of June. In the forest east of Lake Fanny Hooe grows Adenocaulon bicolor Hook. , a composite whose range is chiefly in the western United States and Canada. 3. West Bluff This locality has been made famous as a result of Fernald's hy- pothesis that it was a nunatak during Wisconsin glaciation. Fernald visited West Bluff in 1934 and botanized it rather thoroughly finding such western plants as Woodsia oregana D. C. Eat., Potentilla pensylvanica L., Carex Rossii Boott, Ceanothus sanguineus Pursh, and Chamaerhodos Nuttallii Pickering. The last one Fernald sep- arated from the western plant as var. keweenawensis Fern. on the basis of its hispid stem. This plant occurs only on a single wind- swept slope of the bluff in gravelly soil. Ceanothus sanguineus is found sporadically along the edge of the bluff often occurring with the related species C. ovatus Desf. It is more abundant, however, ona ridge north of Lake Bailey which is about 2 miles east of Eagle Harbor. Here it forms extensive thickets which make a beautiful sight in June when it is in blossom. The construction of the road and the clearing of the woods north of Lake Bailey seem to have 42 ASA GRAY BULLETIN N.S.Vol.I,No.1 favored its development over a much greater area than it formerly occupied. 4, Mt. Lookout Mt. Lookout lies immediately south of Lake Bailey and is sim- ilar to West Bluff in geological structure. Its bald, conglomerate summit can be reached only by trail, whereas that of West Bluff is accessible by a good road. The thin gravelly soil on the summit of Mt. Lookout supports a number of xerophytes such as Potentilla tridentata Ait., Festuca saximontana Rydb., Artemisia caudata Michx., Selaginella rupestris (L.) Spring, Draba arabisans Michx., Woodsia ilvensis (L.) R. Br., Prunus pumila L., Juniperus hori- zontalis Moench, , and Juniperus communis var. depressa Pursh. Most of the western plants which have made West Bluff a curiosity botanically are not found on Mt. Lookout although conditions seem to be identical and the difference in altitude is only about 7 feet. One of the striking features about the vegetation on the summit of Mt. Lookout, as well as that on West Bluff, is the depauperate con- dition of the trees and shrubs. Oaks with large crops of acorns may not be more than two or three tall. Choke cherry and june berry are often prostrate yet flowering and fruiting abundantly. This depauperate condition is evidently due to the strong winds which sweep up the north face of the bluff from Lake Superior and no doubt the heavy accumulation of snow on the north slope during the winter months aids in dwarfing the woody vegetat"
