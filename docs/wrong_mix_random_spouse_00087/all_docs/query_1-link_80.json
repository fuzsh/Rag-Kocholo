        "text": "President’s Letter\n\nHello everyone! I hope you are all doing well. As we are all aware, we are in the third year of a global pandemic that has touched all of our lives through illness, loss, and heightened concern for the well being of our family, friends, colleagues, and ourselves. Through it all, as a professional association, we are fortunate that, due in large part to our leadership and members, we have adapted and will continue to weather this storm. In 2020, under the presidential leadership of Laura Olson, her Executive Council, and Program Chairs, SSSR pivoted from an in-person conference to a series of zoom conference presentations, which allowed us to maintain a sense of normalcy during very uncertain and fearful times. In 2021, under Prema Kurien’s Presidency, the Program Chairs, and Executive Council deftly created a hybrid conference structure that featured three zoom pre-conference presentations during the months leading up to our Annual Meeting in Portland, OR. These presentations, posted at https://sssreligion.org/annual-meeting/virtual-events/, dealt with the social-politically relevant themes of White Christian nationalism, African American religiosity, and global religion. One-hundred and forty-two individuals attended these presentations.\n\nThe 2021 zoom pre-conference presentations laid the groundwork for the SSSR’s highly successful and rewarding 2021 virtual and in-person conferences, the theme of which was Global and Comparative Perspectives on Religion. The virtual conference included more than 125 research presentations from scholars covering a wide range of topics and disciplines. And despite university cuts to travel allowances and trepidations over travelling, 305 persons journeyed to Portland for the in-person conference to present their research and develop and strengthen professional networks and friendships. On November 11-13, 2022, we will attempt to inch closer to normalcy by meeting in person in Baltimore, Maryland for the 2022 SSSR+RRA Annual Meeting. This year’s conference theme is Religion, Racial Unrest and Pandemic, which, I believe is fitting given how race disparities in COVID deaths and increased media attention given to police killing unarmed black men have reawakened us all to the continued salience of race.\n\nIn closing, I’d like to welcome and thank this year’s SSSR Conference Program Chairs, Paul Djupe and Amy Erica Smith, for helping to organize this year’s annual conference. Finally, please join me in thanking Ryan Cragun for his service to SSSR. After eight years as SSSR’s Secretary, Ryan is stepping down. Again, thank you.\n\nI look forward to our in-person conference this year and the opportunity to catch up with all of you in Baltimore!\n\nWarm regards,\n\nKhari Brown\n\nSSSR President\n\nCouncil Member Spotlight\n\nZhou Job Chen\n\nCouncil member Zhuo Job Chen (PhD in Psychology, University of Oregon, 2017) is Associate Professor at School of Nursing and Affiliate Faculty of Health Psychology at University of North Carolina at Charlotte. His research focuses on spiritual and mystical experiences, and the joint area of religion and well-being. He has collaborated widely with researchers from East Asian and Middle East nations to study psychological constructs in Daoism, Buddhism and Islam. He has co-authored over 100 peer-reviewed journal articles and book chapters and has received funding from the John Templeton Foundation.\n\nThis photo was taken at the museum, which is a modern architecture, for Xanadu, which is the historical site (only ruins remained). Xanadu is located in today's Inner Mongolia of China, about 300 miles north of Beijing in the middle of a vast grassland. Xanadu was the first capital of the Mongolian empire, where Kubla Khan started it all. Then they went south to take over the 12th century 'China' and established the capital in Beijing. I visited it in the summer of 2021 with my father.\n\nSSSR+RRA 2022 Annual Meeting\n\nMark your calendars now for the SSSR+RRA 2022 Annual Meeting, November 11-13, 2022 at the Renaissance Harborplace Hotel in Baltimore, Maryland.

Edinburgh University Press, 2021. This volume is a substantial contribution to a growing body of literature on female religious authority in Islam. The introduction and individual chapters, covering a wide temporal and geographical range, address some of major unanswered questions, such as how particular contexts affect women's religious authority. This volume is of importance not just to scholars of gender or Shi'ism, but of religious authority broadly construed.\n\nMirjam Künkler, “Revising Shari‘a in the Light of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights” in Mohsen Kadivar: Haqq al-Nas: Human Rights and Reformist Islam, Edinburgh University Press, 2021.\n\nRoberto Cipriani, Professor Emeritus, Roma Tre University\n\nThe following book is dated 2020, but published in January 2021: Cipriani, Roberto 2020.

Milan: FrancoAngeli.\n\nOne of the most interesting novelties of the new research is the evident emergence of spirituality, which gradually takes over traditional forms of religiosity. Spirituality is based above all on a profound feeling accompanied by reference values and the behaviour that derives from it, manifesting itself especially but not exclusively in the adhesion and dedication to forms of voluntary work and new experiences in the way of praying or in any case of relating to the supernatural.\n\nCipriani, Roberto, Prüfer, Pawel 2021. Socjologia religii. Ujęcie systematyczno-historyczne - Sociology of Religion. A systematic and historical approach. Torún: AKAPIT Wydawnictwo Edukacyjne. \"Sociology of Religion\" is a book that will probably be of interest not only to sociologists, because it deals with the fundamental issue that has accompanied man since the dawn of time. It is religion, which is a kind of phenomenon. In this context the eternal questions arise: What kind of phenomenon are we dealing with? Is religion inscribed in the nature of man, or does it perhaps lie outside him? Where do the motives come from and for what reason do the needs for religious activity and expression arise? Is religion doing well or is it eclipsed and in progressive crisis? Is it a phenomenon evident enough to bring it out of invisibility and pure transcendence and introduce it concretely and with all its richness into the practice of life of individuals and social groups? Finally, who is interested in religion? Is it only the representative of homo religious, the religious practitioner who wants to go beyond purely empirical and rational experience in his everyday life? Or perhaps also the one who looks at religious experience from the position of an observer, researcher, sociologist? To these and many other questions try to answer the authors of the book, an eminent researcher in the field Roberto Cipriani and the Polish sociologist Pawel Prüfer.\n\nCipriani, Roberto 2021.

Radical Transformations in Minority Religions. Abingdon: Routledge. All religions undergo continuous change, but minority religions tend to be less anchored in their ways than mainstream, traditional religions. This volume examines radical transformations undergone by a variety of minority religions, including the Children of God/ Family International; Gnosticism; Jediism; various manifestations of Paganism; LGBT Muslim groups; the Plymouth Brethren; Santa Muerte; and Satanism. As with other books in the Routledge/Inform series, the contributors approach the subject from a wide range of perspectives: professional scholars include legal experts and sociologists specialising in new religious movements, but there are also chapters from those who have experienced a personal involvement. The volume is divided into four thematic parts that focus on different impetuses for radical change: interactions with society, technology and institutions, efforts at legitimation, and new revelations. This book will be a useful source of information for social scientists, historians, theologians and other scholars with an interest in social change, minority religions and ‘cults’. It will also be of interest to a wider readership including lawyers, journalists, theologians and members of the general public.\n\nEileen Barker. 2021 ''Othering': A Necessary but Dangerous Practice', Journal for the Study of Beliefs and Worldviews.

Johnson. 2021. Varieties of atheism in science. New York, NY: Oxford University Press. Many in the public around the globe think that all scientists are atheists and that all atheist scientists are New Atheists, militantly against religion and religious people. But what do everyday atheist scientists actually think about religion? Drawing on a survey of 1,293 atheist scientists in the U.S. and U.K., and 81 in-depth interviews, this book explains the pathways that led to atheism among scientists, the diverse views of religion they hold, their perspectives on the limits to what science can explain, and their views of meaning and morality. The findings reveal a vast gulf between the rhetoric of New Atheism in the public sphere and the reality of atheism in science. The story of the varieties of atheism in science is consequential for both scientific and religious communities and points to tools for dialogue between these seemingly disparate groups.\n\nAcademic Articles\n\nJonathan Coley, Assistant Professor of Sociology, Oklahoma State University\n\n\"Creating Secular Spaces: Religious Threat and the Presence of Secular Student Alliances at U.S. Colleges and Universities.\" Sociological Forum 36(3): 649-667. https://doi.org/10.1111/socf.12725\n\n\"Mobilizing for Religious Freedom: Educational Opportunity Structures and Outcomes of Conservative Christian Campus Activism.\" Research in Social Movements, Conflicts, and Change 44(1): 175-200. https://doi.org/10.1108/S0163-786X20210000044012\"\n\nPaul-André Turcotte, social-scientist, AFFRESS\n\n“L’Église nationale dans l’histoire et la société.
