Honors are determined by an undergraduate student's cumulative GPA for all work at Columbia, with the top 5 percent of the graduating class being awarded summa cum laude, the next 10 percent being awarded magna cum laude, and the remaining 10 percent awarded cum laude.\n\nCollege honors are the highest academic recognition awarded by the College. There is no separate consideration of honors for October or February graduates. The honor is officially noted on the diploma and transcript of students who have graduated. October and February graduates may ask the Registrar to add an honors notation to an already issued diploma.\n\nBoth academic standing and disciplinary standing are taken into consideration when awarding College honors.\n\nSumma Cum Laude\n\nSophia Abrahamson CC’24\n\nTalia Abrahamson CC’24\n\nMelissa Andrade CC’24\n\nArdaschir Arguelles CC’24\n\nNoah Bergam CC’24\n\nCharles Bonkowsky
