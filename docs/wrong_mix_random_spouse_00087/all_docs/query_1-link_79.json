In FY 2015, NIH received a total of $30.3 billion, an increase of $150 million above the FY 2014 level.\n\nThe FY 2015 appropriation for NIAAA provided $447.2 million. This represented an increase of $1.4 million or 0.3% over the FY 2014 level. NIAAA estimates that it will support a total of 676 research project grants (RPG) in FY 2015, including 152 competing awards, compared to 686 RPGs and 180 competing awards in FY 2014.\n\nFY 2016\n\nAs discussed in the June Director’s Report to Council, President Obama submitted to Congress his FY 2016 budget request for all federal agencies on February 2, 2015 – the FY 2016 President’s Budget. Included in the President’s request is a proposed FY 2016 budget for the NIH of $31.3 billion, a $1 billion increase over the FY 2015 level. The NIAAA budget request for FY 2016 is $459.8 million, an increase of $12.6 million over the FY 2015 level.\n\nThe FY 2016 appropriations bill for the NIH budget is still pending in Congress. As a result, NIH anticipates beginning FY 2016 under a Continuing Resolution (CR). A CR is legislation that allows federal operations and programs to continue at current spending levels when formal appropriations bills have not been signed into law by the end of a fiscal year. Following is the current status of FY 2016 NIH appropriations activity in the House and Senate:\n\nHouse Action: On June 24, 2015, the House Appropriations Committee approved a FY 2016 Labor-Health and Human Services-Education funding bill that would provide NIH with $31.2 billion, which is $1.1 billion more than the FY 2015 level. For NIAAA, the bill would provide $456 million, which is $8.6 million more than the FY 2015 level.\n\nSenate Action: On June 25, 2015, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved its version of the FY 2016 Labor-Health and Human Services-Education funding bill. For NIH, the budget level proposed by the Senate Committee is $32.0 billion, an increase of $2 billion above the FY 2015 level. This is the largest proposed increase to the NIH budget since the end of the budget doubling in FY 2003. For NIAAA, the proposed budget level in the bill is $469.4 million, which is $22.2 million more than the FY 2015 level.\n\nAlthough these funding bills passed successfully though their respective committees, they have yet to be considered by the full legislature in both the House and Senate.\n\nFY 2017\n\nPreliminary work on the budget for FY 2017 has begun. After intermediate stages of review, the President’s budget request will be presented to Congress in February 2016, at which time it will become available to the public.\n\nNIAAA Budget Mechanism - Total\n\n(Dollars in Thousands) FY 2015\n\nEnacted FY 2016\n\nPresident's Budget MECHANISM Number Amount Number Amount Research Projects Noncompeting 501 $189,337 491 $186,684 Administrative Supplements (24) 1,269 (24) 1,269 Competing 152 51,595 176 59,120 Subtotal, RPGs 653 242,201 667 247,073 SBIR/STTR 23 10,445 37 11,889 Research Centers Specialized/Comprehensive 18 28,446 704 28,200 Clinical Research - - - - Biotechnology - - - - Comparative Medicine - - - - Res.

This report shows that the microRNA miR-125b protects against apoptosis by blocking the expression of known mediators of apoptosis and that alcohol disrupts this protection by reducing miR-125b levels in both cultured NCC and embryos. Furthermore, injection of miR-125b into alcohol-exposed mouse embryos was shown to prevent apoptosis and improve embryo growth. Collectively, these findings define a mechanism by which alcohol impairs fetal development and suggests the possibility that a miR-125b-based intervention could diminish the harm caused by PAE to the fetus.\n\nABSTRACT: MicroRNAs are a class of small noncoding RNAs that have been implicated in regulation of a broad range of cellular and physiologic processes, including apoptosis. The objective of this study is to elucidate the roles of miR-125b in modulating ethanol-induced apoptosis in neural crest cells (NCCs) and mouse embryos. We found that treatment with ethanol resulted in a significant decrease in miR-125b expression in NCCs and in mouse embryos. We also validated that Bcl-2 antagonist killer 1 (Bak1) and p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) are the direct targets of miR-125b in NCCs. In addition, over-expression of miR-125b significantly reduced ethanol-induced increase in Bak1 and PUMA protein expression, caspase-3 activation, and apoptosis in NCCs, indicating that miR-125b can modulate ethanol-induced apoptosis by the regulation of Bcl-2 and p53 pathways. Furthermore, microinjection of miR-125b mimic resulted in a significant increase in miR-125b expression and a decrease in the protein expression of Bak1 and PUMA in ethanol-exposed mouse embryos. Up-regulation of miR-125b also significantly reduced ethanol-induced caspase-3 activation and diminished ethanol-induced growth retardation in mouse embryos. This is the first demonstration that miR-125b can prevent ethanol-induced apoptosis and that microinjection of miRNA mimic can prevent ethanol-induced embryotoxicity.

Both the fetal amino acid disturbances and growth restriction were mitigated by administering glutamine to the pregnant sheep, suggesting that glutamine infusion might be a beneficial intervention in human pregnancies known to involve significant alcohol exposure.\n\nABSTRACT: Prenatal alcohol exposure is known to cause fetal growth restriction and disturbances in amino acid bioavailability. Alterations in these parameters can persist into adulthood and low birth weight can lead to altered fetal programming. Glutamine has been associated with the synthesis of other amino acids, an increase in protein synthesis and it is used clinically as a nutrient supplement for low birth weight infants. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of repeated maternal alcohol exposure and L-glutamine supplementation on fetal growth and amino acid bioavailability during the third trimester-equivalent period in an ovine model. Pregnant sheep were randomly assigned to four groups, saline control, alcohol (1.75-2.5 g/kg), glutamine (100 mg/kg, three times daily) or alcohol + glutamine. In this study, a weekend binge drinking model was followed where treatment was done 3 days per week in succession from gestational day (GD) 109-132 (normal term ~147). Maternal alcohol exposure significantly reduced fetal body weight, height, length, thoracic girth and brain weight, and resulted in decreased amino acid bioavailability in fetal plasma and placental fluids. Maternal glutamine supplementation successfully mitigated alcohol-induced fetal growth restriction and improved the bioavailability of glutamine and glutamine-related amino acids such as glycine, arginine, and asparagine in the fetal compartment. All together, these findings show that L-glutamine supplementation enhances amino acid availability in the fetus and prevents alcohol-induced fetal growth restriction. (Sawant OB, Wu G, Washburn SE.

Longitudinal analyses detected an acceleration in the typical decline in volume of neocortical areas and smaller increases in white matter volume in adolescents who started drinking heavily. The findings provide further evidence that heavy drinking during adolescence alters the trajectory of brain development.\n\nOBJECTIVE: Heavy alcohol use during adolescence may alter the trajectory of normal brain development. The authors measured within-subject changes in regional brain morphometry over longer intervals and in larger samples of adolescents than previously reported and assessed differences between adolescents who remained nondrinkers and those who drank heavily during adolescence as well as differences between the sexes. METHOD: The authors examined gray and white matter volume trajectories in 134 adolescents, of whom 75 transitioned to heavy drinking and 59 remained light drinkers or nondrinkers over roughly 3.5 years. Each underwent MRI scanning two to six times between ages 12 and 24 and was followed for up to 8 years. The volumes of the neocortex, allocortex, and white matter structures were measured using atlas-based parcellation with longitudinal registration. Linear mixed-effects models described differences in trajectories of heavy drinkers and nondrinkers over age; secondary analyses considered the contribution of other drug use to identified alcohol use effects. RESULTS: Heavy-drinking adolescents showed accelerated gray matter reduction in cortical lateral frontal and temporal volumes and attenuated white matter growth of the corpus callosum and pons relative to nondrinkers. These results were largely unchanged when use of marijuana and other drugs was examined. Male and female drinkers showed similar patterns of development trajectory abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal analysis enabled detection of accelerated typical volume decline in frontal and temporal cortical volumes and attenuated growth in principal white matter structures in adolescents who started to drink heavily. These results provide a call for caution regarding heavy alcohol use during adolescence, whether heavy drinking is the sole cause or one of several in these alterations in brain development.

This study shows that genetic deletion of the GIRK3 subunit prevents alcohol activation of the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway and enhances binge-like drinking, suggesting that GIRK3 is a critical gatekeeper of ethanol incentive salience and a potential target for the treatment of excessive ethanol consumption.\n\nG protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels are critical regulators of neuronal excitability and can be directly activated by ethanol. Constitutive deletion of the GIRK3 subunit has minimal phenotypic consequences, except in response to drugs of abuse. Here we investigated how the GIRK3 subunit contributes to the cellular and behavioral effects of ethanol, as well as to voluntary ethanol consumption. We found that constitutive deletion of GIRK3 in knockout (KO) mice selectively increased ethanol binge-like drinking, without affecting ethanol metabolism, sensitivity to ethanol intoxication, or continuous-access drinking. Virally mediated expression of GIRK3 in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) reversed the phenotype of GIRK3 KO mice and further decreased the intake of their wild-type counterparts. In addition, GIRK3 KO mice showed a blunted response of the mesolimbic dopaminergic (DA) pathway to ethanol, as assessed by ethanol-induced excitation of VTA neurons and DA release in the nucleus accumbens. These findings support the notion that the subunit composition of VTA GIRK channels is a critical determinant of DA neuron sensitivity to drugs of abuse. Furthermore, our study reveals the behavioral impact of this cellular effect, whereby the level of GIRK3 expression in the VTA tunes ethanol intake under binge-type conditions: the more GIRK3, the less ethanol drinking.

The computational approaches were applied to a rat model of dependence and protracted abstinence. A novel druggable genomic target was identified, the glucocorticoid receptor gene (Nr3c1), that acts as a causal “Master Regulator” of the gene expression signature produced by protracted abstinence. This correlation between protracted abstinence and Nr3c1 was causally validated in vivo; the Nr3c1 antagonist mifepristone selectively decreased dependent, excessive, alcohol self-administration in rats. A recently published human laboratory pilot study on mifepristone supports the rat model results.\n\nBACKGROUND: A systems biology approach based on the assembly and interrogation of gene regulatory networks, or interactomes, was used to study neuroadaptation processes associated with the transition to alcohol dependence at the molecular level. RESULTS: Using a rat model of dependent and non-dependent alcohol self-administration, we reverse engineered a global transcriptional regulatory network during protracted abstinence, a period when relapse rates are highest. We then interrogated the network to identify master regulator genes that mechanistically regulate brain region-specific signatures associated with dependent and non-dependent alcohol self-administration. Among these, the gene coding for the glucocorticoid receptor was independently identified as a master regulator in multiple brain regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, central nucleus of the amygdala, and ventral tegmental area, consistent with the view that brain reward and stress systems are dysregulated during protracted abstinence. Administration of the glucocorticoid antagonist mifepristone in either the nucleus accumbens or ventral tegmental area selectively decreased dependent, excessive, alcohol self-administration in rats but had no effect on non-dependent, moderate, alcohol self-administration. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that assembly and analysis of regulatory networks is an effective strategy for the identification of key regulators of long-term neuroplastic changes within specific brain regions that play a functional role in alcohol dependence. More specifically, our results support a key role for regulatory networks downstream of the glucocorticoid receptor in excessive alcohol drinking during protracted alcohol abstinence.

It underscores the contribution of a genetic factor to AUD and identifies a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of compulsive alcohol drinking.\n\nBACKGROUND: The valine 66 to methionine (Met) polymorphism within the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) sequence reduces activity-dependent BDNF release and is associated with psychiatric disorders in humans. Alcoholism is one of the most prevalent psychiatric diseases. Here, we tested the hypothesis that this polymorphism increases the severity of alcohol abuse disorders. METHODS: We generated transgenic mice carrying the mouse homolog of the human Met66BDNF allele (Met68BDNF) and used alcohol-drinking paradigms in combination with viral-mediated gene delivery and pharmacology. RESULTS: We found that Met68BDNF mice consumed excessive amounts of alcohol and continued to drink despite negative consequences, a hallmark of addiction. Importantly, compulsive alcohol intake was reversed by overexpression of the wild-type valine68BDNF allele in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex of the Met68BDNF mice or by systemic administration of the tropomyosin receptor kinase B agonist, LM22A-4. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that carrying this BDNF allele increases the risk of developing uncontrolled and excessive alcohol drinking that can be reversed by directly activating the BDNF receptor, tropomyosin receptor kinase B. Importantly, this work identifies a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of compulsive alcohol drinking in humans carrying the Met66BDNF allele.

This paper presents data from four human genetic association studies suggesting a role of a genetic variant of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) in alcohol dependence. In an additional translational study, GLP-1R agonism significantly reduced alcohol consumption in a mouse model of alcohol dependence. These convergent findings suggest that GLP-1R may represent a novel pharmacotherapy target for AUD.\n\nThe hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) regulates appetite and food intake. GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) activation also attenuates the reinforcing properties of alcohol in rodents. The present translational study is based on four human genetic association studies and one preclinical study providing data that support the hypothesis that GLP-1R may have a role in the pathophysiology of alcohol use disorder (AUD). Case-control analysis (N = 908) was performed on a sample of individuals enrolled in the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) intramural research program. The Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment (SAGE) sample (N = 3803) was used for confirmation purposes. Post hoc analyses were carried out on data from a human laboratory study of intravenous alcohol self-administration (IV-ASA; N = 81) in social drinkers and from a functional magnetic resonance imaging study in alcohol-dependent individuals (N = 22) subjected to a Monetary Incentive Delay task. In the preclinical study, a GLP-1R agonist was evaluated in a mouse model of alcohol dependence to demonstrate the role of GLP-1R for alcohol consumption. The previously reported functional allele 168Ser (rs6923761) was nominally associated with AUD (P = 0.004) in the NIAAA sample, which was partially replicated in males of the SAGE sample (P = 0.033). The 168 Ser/Ser genotype was further associated with increased alcohol administration and breath alcohol measures in the IV-ASA experiment and with higher BOLD response in the right globus pallidus when receiving notification of outcome for high monetary reward. Finally, GLP-1R agonism significantly reduced alcohol consumption in a mouse model of alcohol dependence. These convergent findings suggest that the GLP-1R may be an attractive target for personalized pharmacotherapy treatment of AUD (Suchankova P, Yan J, Schwandt ML, Stangl BL, Caparelli EC, Momenan R, Jerlhag E, Engel JA, Hodgkinson CA, Egli M, Lopez MF, Becker HC, Goldman D, Heilig M, Ramchandani VA, Leggio L.

The attenuation of striato-cortico-limbic responses to cues signaling alcohol reward by varenicline may underlie its clinical effectiveness in reducing alcohol consumption and its potential utility in pharmacotherapy for AUD.\n\nBACKGROUND: Preclinical and emerging clinical evidence indicates that varenicline, a nicotinic partial agonist approved for smoking cessation, attenuates alcohol seeking and consumption. Reductions of alcohol craving have been observed under varenicline treatment and suggest effects of the medication on alcohol reward processing, but this hypothesis remains untested. METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized experimental medicine study, 29 heavy drinkers underwent a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan after 2 weeks of varenicline (2mg/d) or placebo administration. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, participants performed the Alcohol-Food Incentive Delay task, where they could earn points for snacks or alcohol. At baseline and after 3 weeks of medication, participants underwent intravenous alcohol self-administration sessions in the laboratory. RESULTS: During the functional magnetic resonance imaging scan, participants in the varenicline group (N=17) reported lower feelings of happiness and excitement on subjective mood scales when anticipating alcohol reward compared with the placebo group (N=12). Linear mixed effects analysis revealed that anticipation of alcohol reward was associated with significant blood oxygen level dependent activation of the ventral striatum, amygdala, and posterior insula in the placebo group; this activation was attenuated in the varenicline group. The varenicline group showed no difference in intravenous alcohol self-administration relative to the placebo group for either session. Participants with higher insula activation when anticipating alcohol reward showed higher alcohol self-administration behavior across groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that varenicline decreases blood oxygen level dependent activation in striato-cortico-limbic regions associated with motivation and incentive salience of alcohol in heavy drinkers. This mechanism may underlie the clinical effectiveness of varenicline in reducing alcohol intake and indicates its potential utility as a pharmacotherapy for alcohol use disorders.

This study suggests that doxazosin may be effective selectively in alcoholic patients with significant family history of alcoholism.\n\nEvidence suggests that the norepinephrine system represents an important treatment target for alcohol dependence (AD) and the α1 -blocker prazosin may reduce alcohol drinking in rodents and alcoholic patients. The α1 -blocker doxazosin demonstrates a more favorable pharmacokinetic profile than prazosin, but has never been studied for AD. A double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial was conducted in AD individuals seeking outpatient treatment. Doxazosin or matched placebo was titrated to 16 mg/day (or maximum tolerable dose). Drinks per week (DPW) and heavy drinking days (HDD) per week were the primary outcomes. Family history density of alcoholism (FHDA), severity of AD and gender were a priori moderators. Forty-one AD individuals were randomized, 30 (doxazosin = 15) completed the treatment phase and 28 (doxazosin = 14) also completed the follow-up. There were no significant differences between groups on DPW and HDD per week. With FHDA as a moderator, there were significant FHDA × medication interactions for both DPW (pcorrected = 0.001, d = 1.18) and HDD (pcorrected = 0.00009, d = 1.30). Post hoc analyses revealed that doxazosin significantly reduced alcohol drinking in AD patients with high FHDA and by contrast increased drinking in those with low FHDA. Doxazosin may be effective selectively in AD patients with high FHDA. This study provides preliminary evidence for personalized medicine using α1 -blockade to treat AD. However, confirmatory studies are required (Kenna GA, Haass-Koffler CL, Zywiak WH, Edwards SM, Brickley MB, Swift RM, Leggio L. Addict Biol. 2015 Jun 2.

Researchers examining data from a randomized controlled trial of a motivational interviewing-based intervention for problem drinkers found that high levels of therapeutic bond and understanding between patient and therapist predicted decreased alcohol use at the end of treatment. This study highlights the importance of relational components in motivational interviewing treatments for alcohol use.\n\nThe quality of the relationship between a therapist and his or her client can make a significant contribution to recovery from substance use disorders. Treatments often harness aspects of therapeutic relationships (e.g., therapeutic bond) to positively affect therapeutic outcomes. Within motivational interviewing (MI), for example, authors theorize that a relational component is 1 active component that affects change. The present study aims to examine the effects of relationships within a treatment setting on drinking. A secondary data analysis was performed on data collected from problem drinkers in a randomized controlled trial. Participants were assigned to MI or relational MI without directive elements (spirit-only MI). Participants answered questions about alcohol use and therapeutic bond before, during, and at the end of an 8-week treatment period. High levels of therapeutic bond and empathic resonance predicted decreased alcohol use at the end of treatment for participants in both conditions. This study highlights the importance of relational components in treatments for substance abuse. (Wiprovnick A, Kuerbis A and Morgenstern J.

Experimental methods are better able than other approaches to find such a link. This meta-analysis, which evaluated experimental studies on the effects of alcohol consumption on unprotected sex intentions, found that alcohol use was associated with greater intentions to engage in unprotected sex, weaker sexual communication and negotiation skills, and higher levels of sexual arousal. Addressing alcohol consumption as a key component in sexual risk-taking may lead to more effective interventions for sexual risk behavior and its potential adverse consequences, including HIV.\n\nAlcohol is associated with HIV and other sexually transmitted infections through increased sexual risk-taking behavior. Establishing a causal link between alcohol and sexual behavior has been challenging due to methodological limitations (e.g., reliance on cross-sectional designs). Experimental methods can be used to establish causality. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the effects of alcohol consumption on unprotected sex intentions. We searched electronic bibliographic databases for records with relevant keywords; 26 manuscripts (k = 30 studies) met inclusion criteria. Results indicate that alcohol consumption is associated with greater intentions to engage in unprotected sex (d +s = 0.24, 0.35). The effect of alcohol on unprotected sex intentions was greater when sexual arousal was heightened. Alcohol consumption is causally linked to theoretical antecedents of sexual risk behavior, consistent with the alcohol myopia model. Addressing alcohol consumption as a determinant of unprotected sex intentions may lead to more effective HIV interventions.

The most common underlying factor of HCC is cirrhosis caused by viral hepatitis, chronic alcoholism, or obesity. This study examined the involvement of the hepatic cannabinoid 1 receptors (CB1R) in HCC using liver biopsy samples from HCC patients (without viral hepatitis) and from mice with carcinogen-induced HCC. Investigators found that blockade or genetic deletion of CB1R suppresses the growth of HCC through specific mechanisms, underscoring the therapeutic potential of peripheral CB1R blockade in HCC.\n\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has high mortality and no adequate treatment. Endocannabinoids interact with hepatic cannabinoid 1 receptors (CB1Rs) to promote hepatocyte proliferation in liver regeneration by inducing cell cycle proteins involved in mitotic progression, including Forkhead Box M1. Because this protein is highly expressed in HCC and contributes to its genesis and progression, we analyzed the involvement of the endocannabinoid/CB1R system in murine and human HCC. Postnatal diethylnitrosamine treatment induced HCC within 8 months in wild-type mice but fewer and smaller tumors in CB1R–/– mice or in wild-type mice treated with the peripheral CB1R antagonist JD5037, as monitored in vivo by serial magnetic resonance imaging. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis revealed CB1R-dependent, tumor-induced up-regulation of the hepatic expression of CB1R, its endogenous ligand anandamide, and a number of tumor-promoting genes, including the GRB2 interactome as well as Forkhead Box M1 and its downstream target, the tryptophan-catalyzing enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase. Increased indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity and consequent induction of immunosuppressive T-regulatory cells in tumor tissue promote immune tolerance. Conclusion: The endocannabinoid/CB1R system is up-regulated in chemically induced HCC, resulting in the induction of various tumor-promoting genes, including indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase; and attenuation of these changes by blockade or genetic ablation of CB1R suppresses the growth of HCC and highlights the therapeutic potential of peripheral CB1R blockade.

Inhibition of fat-specific protein 27 ameliorates liver injury in ethanol-fed mice, and hepatic fat-specific protein 27 levels correlate with disease severity in patients. These findings suggest that fat-specific protein 27 plays an important role in promoting development of alcoholic steatohepatitis in mice and patients, thus indicating a novel pharmacologic target for treatment.\n\nBACKGROUND & AIMS: Alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) is the progressive form of alcoholic liver disease and may lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. We studied mouse models and human tissues to identify molecules associated with ASH progression, and focused on mouse fat-specific protein 27 (FSP-27)/human cell death-inducing DFF45-like effector C (CIDEC) protein, which is expressed in white adipose tissues and promotes formation of fat droplets. METHODS: C57BL/6N mice or mice with hepatocyte-specific disruption of Fsp27 (Fsp27Hep-/- mice) were fed the Lieber-Decarli ethanol liquid diet (5% ethanol) for 10 days to 12 weeks, followed by 1 or multiple binges of ethanol (5 or 6 g/kg) during the chronic feeding. Some mice were given an inhibitor of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARG) (GW9662). Adenoviral vectors were used to express transgenes or small hairpin (sh) RNAs in cultured hepatocytes and in mice. Liver tissue samples were collected from ethanol-fed mice or from 31 patients with alcoholic hepatitis (AH) with biopsy-proved ASH and analyzed by histologic, immunohistochemical, transcriptome, immunoblot, and real-time PCR analyses. RESULTS: Chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding of mice, which mimics the drinking pattern of patients with AH, produced severe ASH and mild fibrosis. Microarray analyses revealed similar alterations in expression of many hepatic genes in ethanol-fed mice and humans with ASH, including upregulation of mouse Fsp27 (also called Cidec) and human CIDEC. Fsp27Hep-/- mice and mice given injections of adenovirus-Fsp27shRNA had markedly reduced ASH following chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding. Inhibition of PPARG and cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein H (CREBH) prevented the increases in Fsp27α and FSP27β mRNAs, respectively, and reduced liver injury in this chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding model. Overexpression of FSP27 and ethanol exposure had synergistic effects in inducing production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and damage to hepatocytes in mice. Hepatic CIDEC mRNA expression was increased in patients with AH and correlated with the degree of hepatic steatosis and disease severity including mortality. CONCLUSION: In mice, chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding induces ASH that mimics some histological and molecular features observed in patients with AH. Hepatic expression of FSP27/CIDEC is highly upregulated in mice following chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding and in patients with AH; this upregulation contributes to alcohol-induced liver damage (Xu MJ, Cai Y, Wang H, Altamirano J, Chang B, Bertola A, Odena G, Lu J, Tanaka N, Matsusue K, Matsubara T, Mukhopadhyay P, Kimura S, Pacher P, Gonzalez FJ, Bataller R, Gao B: Gastroenterology. 2015 Jun 19. pii: S0016-5085(15)00866-5. doi: 10.1053/j.gastro.2015.06.009.

This study identified transcription factor Twist1 as a product of quiescent HSC in adult mice which indirectly inhibits CCN2 production through its transcriptional activation of micro RNA-214. During HSC activation, higher levels of CCN2 result, at least in part, from decreased expression of Twist1, resulting in reduced miR-214 transcription. This study reveals a previously unrecognized role for Twist1 as a suppressor of CCN2 expression and its downstream fibrogenic signals and highlights the potential utility of Twist1, miR-214, and CCN2 as novel circulating biomarkers for liver fibrosis.\n\nAbstract. A hallmark of liver fibrosis is the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSC) which results in their production of fibrotic molecules, a process that is largely regulated by connective tissue growth factor (CCN2). CCN2 is increasingly expressed during HSC activation due to diminished expression of microRNA-214 (miR-214), a product of dynamin 3 opposite strand (DNM3os) that directly suppresses CCN2 mRNA. We show that an E-box in the miR-214 promoter binds the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, Twist1, which drives miR-214 expression and results in CCN2 suppression. Twist1 expression was suppressed in HSC of fibrotic livers or in cultured HSC undergoing activation in vitro or after treatment with ethanol. Further, Twist1 decreasingly interacted with DNM3os as HSC underwent activation in vitro. Nanovesicular exosomes secreted by quiescent but not activated HSC contained high levels of Twist1, thus reflecting the suppression of cellular Twist1 during HSC activation. Exosomal Twist1 was intercellularly shuttled between HSC and stimulated expression of miR-214 in the recipient cells, causing expression of CCN2 and its downstream effectors to be suppressed. Additionally, the miR-214 E-box in HSC was also regulated by hepatocyte-derived exosomes showing that functional transfer of exosomal Twist1 occurs between different cell types. Finally, the levels of Twist1, miR-214 or CCN2 in circulating exosomes from fibrotic mice reflected fibrosis-induced changes in the liver itself, highlighting the potential utility of these and other constituents in serum exosomes as novel circulating biomarkers for liver fibrosis. These findings reveal a novel function for cellular or exosomal Twist1 in CCN2-dependent fibrogenesis. (Chen L, Chen R, Kemper S, Charrier A, Brigstock DR.

In this study, women who underwent RYGB reached the same blood alcohol concentration in half the number of drinks and reported a greater feeling of drunkenness compared to women who didn’t have the surgery. RYGB-positive women also exceeded the legal driving limit for blood alcohol content 30 minutes after alcohol ingestion and met the criteria used to define an episode of binge drinking, whereas RYGP-negative women who consumed the same amount of alcohol did not. These data underscore the need to make patients aware of the alterations in alcohol metabolism that occur after RYGB surgery to help reduce the risk of potential serious consequences of moderate alcohol consumption.\n\nRoux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is the most common bariatric surgical procedure performed in the world.1 Although RYGB surgery causes a marked reduction in food intake and induces remission of food addiction,2 it is associated with an increased risk of developing alcohol use disorders.3 It is likely that RYGB-related changes in gastrointestinal anatomy alter the pharmacokinetics and subjective effects of ingested alcohol,4 which contributes to the increased risk of alcohol use disorders. However, results from previous studies are limited because (1) blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) were measured in venous blood samples, which underestimates the peak BAC delivered to the brain in patients who have had RYGB surgery, and (2) the subjective effects of alcohol have not been assessed using validated questionnaires. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect of RYGB on the pharmacokinetics and subjective effects of ingested alcohol, using arterialized blood samples and a validated questionnaire.
