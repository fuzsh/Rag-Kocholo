        "text": "Battle honours\n\nThere are three possible sources for the origin of the surname of Gray, or Grey, including that it may have been simply a descriptive term to denote someone’s hair colouring, complexion, or clothing.\n\nBut the exploits of those who have borne it over the centuries are certainly more colourful than the name may suggest.\n\nAnother explanation is that it originates from a Norman known as Fulbert, who held the powerful post of Great Chamberlain to Robert, Duke of Normandy, who granted him the lands known as Croy, in the French region of Picardy.\n\n‘Croy’ is thought to have derived from the French ‘Les Payes de Croix’, meaning ‘The Lands of the Cross’, and Fulbert later adopted de Croy (‘of Croy’) as the family surname and it is his daughter, Arlette, or Herleva, who was the mother of William the Conqueror, victor of the battle of Hastings in 1066.\n\nThe name Croy then took on various forms, including Groy, Grai, Gray, and Grey.\n\nA John de Grai, for example, is recorded as having been born in Picardy in 1033.\n\nThose de Croys who settled in England in the wake of the Conquest later adopted the form of Grey (with an ‘e’), and their descendants included the ill-starred Lady Jane Grey, the great grand-daughter of Henry VII who was proclaimed Queen Regent of England for nine days in 1553 – but was deposed and later executed.\n\nThe most common spelling of the name is Gray (with an ‘a’), and a John de Gray, a descendant of Lord Grey of Chillingham, in Northumberland, is recorded in Coldstream, in the Scottish Borders, during the reign from 1249 to 1286 of Alexander III, while a Hugo de Gray is recorded in Fife earlier in the same century.\n\nThe third possible source of the name is from the Scottish Gaelic ‘glas’, or ‘glass’, denoting the colour gray, and from this derives the Highland names of Glas, Glass, and MacGlashan.\n\nIn the decades following the abortive Jacobite Rising of 1745 and the subsequent enforced depopulation of the Highlands and Islands, many MacGlashans were forced to seek a new home in the Lowlands, where many later adopted the anglicised form of ‘Gray’.\n\nA family of Grays were the hereditary sheriffs of Forfarshire, responsible for building both Broughty Castle and Castle Huntly, while separate families of Grays established in the Lowlands held lands in Ayrshire and the lands of Carntyne, east of the present day city of Glasgow.\n\nBoth the numerous Lowland families of Grays and their MacGlashan counterparts in the Highlands fought bravely in the cause of Scotland’s freedom and independence, while many also took arms in defence of the cause of the Royal House of Stuart.\n\nForemost among these Scottish patriots was Sir Andrew Gray, who played a prominent role in the bitter and bloody Wars of Independence with England.\n\nIt had been in 1292 that John Balliol was controversially enthroned at Scone as King of Scots – but, fatefully for the nation, it had been the Scots themselves who had unwisely asked the powerful Edward I of England to arbitrate in the bitter dispute over the succession to the throne, and the hapless Balliol had found himself Edward’s chosen man.\n\nScotland rose in revolt against the imperialist designs of Edward in July of 1296 but, living up to his sobriquet of ‘Hammer of the Scots’, the ruthless monarch brought the entire nation under his subjugation little less than a month later, garrisoning strategic locations throughout the length and breadth of the nation.\n\nRubbing salt into the stinging wounds of Scottish pride, 1,500 earls, bishops, and burgesses, were forced to sign a humiliating treaty of fealty to the rapacious Edward.\n\nAmong those who had no option but to sign the treaty, known as the Ragman Roll because of the profusions of ribbons that dangle from the seals of the signatories, was Sir Andrew Gray.\n\nThe humiliation was soon to be avenged, however, when William Wallace raised the banner of revolt against the English occupation of Scotland in May of 1297.\n\nProving an expert in the tactics of guerrilla warfare, Wallace and his hardened band of freedom fighters inflicted stunning defeats on the English garrisons.\n\nThis culminated in the liberation of practically all of Scotland following the battle of Stirling Bridge, on September 11, 1297.\n\nDefeat followed at the battle of Falkirk on July 22, 1298, however, and Wallace was eventually betrayed and captured in August of 1305.\n\nOn August 23 of that year, he was brutally executed in London on the orders of a vengeful Edward I.\n\nLess than a year later, the banner of revolt against the mailed fist of English occupation was raised yet again following the enthronement at Scone of Robert the Bruce as King of Scots.\n\nOne of the great warrior king’s ablest supporters was Sir Andrew Gray, who played a key role in March of 1314 in ousting the English garrison from the mighty bastion of Edinburgh Castle in a daring night raid.\n\nSir Andrew, along with the Earl of Moray and about thirty of their hardy men, made a precarious ascent by rope ladder up the forbidding north face of the rock on which the castle is perched, while another force prepared to launch an assault on the castle’s south gate.\n\nSir Andrew was among the first to clamber over the castle walls and the signal was then given for the assault on the south gate.\n\nA furious struggle ensued with the garrison, but it was eventually taken, to the glory of both Sir Andrew Gray and the Earl of Moray.\n\nThe capture of the castle was a significant strategic coup, and this was followed up less than three months later with what proved to be the final nail in the coffin of England’s imperialist designs on Scotland.\n\nThis was the battle of Bannockburn, fought in June of 1314, and which involved the crushing and humiliating defeat of a 20,000-strong English army under Edward II by a Scots army less than half this strength.\n\nBy midsummer of a year earlier an English garrison under the command of Sir Philip Mowbray occupied the imposing fortress of Stirling Castle.\n\nBruce’s brother, Edward, rashly agreed to a pledge by Mowbray that if the castle was not relieved by battle by midsummer of the following year, then he would surrender.\n\nThis made battle inevitable, and by June 23 of 1314 the two armies faced one another at Bannockburn, in sight of the castle.\n\nIt was on this day that Bruce slew the English knight Sir Henry de Bohun in single combat, but the battle proper was not fought until the following day, shortly after the rise of the midsummer sun.\n\nThe English cavalry launched a desperate but futile charge on the densely packed ranks of Scottish spearmen known as schiltrons, and by the time the sun had sank slowly in the west the English army had been totally routed, with Edward himself only narrowly managing to make his escape from the carnage of the battlefield.\n\nBruce later rewarded Sir Andrew with the grant of lands that included Longforgen, in Perthshire, while the family’s honours were added to in 1444 when one of his descendants, also Sir Andrew Gray, was created Lord Gray by James II.\n\nMurder and intrigue\n\nThe 1st Lord Gray’s successors continued to play a role at the heart of Scotland’s frequently turbulent affairs, with Patrick, the Master of Gray, son of the 2nd Lord Gray, holding the influential position of Gentleman of the Bedchamber to James II.\n\nIt was in this role, as a close companion and confidante of the king, that he became involved in one of the darkest incidents of the king’s reign – the murder in 1452 of William, the 8th Earl of Douglas.\n\nThe earl had entered into a bond, or agreement, of mutual alliance with the equally powerful nobles the Earl of Ross and the Earl of Crawford, in which they pledged to work together for their common interests. Under-standably suspicious and alarmed by this, James summoned the earl of Douglas to Stirling Castle and demanded that he revoke the agreement.\n\nThe bold earl haughtily refused and, furious at his royal authority being flouted, the king shouted ‘since you will not, I shall!’ and, drawing his dagger, stabbed him in the neck and body.\n\nAs the earl reeled in shock and pain, the Master of Gray felled him with one vicious sweep of a battleaxe. Lying helpless, the Earl of Douglas was then stabbed a further twenty- six times.\n\nWhat made the murder all the more heinous was that the earl had been granted a safe conduct pass to Stirling, and his brother, in revenge, later pillaged the town and dragged the pass through the filth of the streets at the tail of a horse.\n\nThe 3rd Lord Gray was appointed Lord Justice General of Scotland in 1506, while thirty-six years later, in 1542, the 5th Lord Gray was among the many Scottish nobles captured and later ransomed by the English after the battle of Solway Moss.\n\nFollowing his release from captivity he later became a staunch adherent of Scotland’s religious Reformation and an opponent of Mary, Queen of Scots, who was forced to abdicate in 1568 in favour of her son, the future James VI.\n\nHis descendant Andrew, however, the 8th Lord Gray, became embroiled in the bitter civil war that raged in Scotland between 1638 and 1649.\n\nThis war was between the Royalists and those Presbyterian Scots who had signed a National Covenant.\n\nThe Covenant opposed the divine right of the Stuart monarchy and Royalists such as James Graham, 1st Marquis of Montrose, whose prime allegiance was to Charles I.\n\nAlthough Montrose had initially supported the Covenant, his conscience later forced him to switch sides, and the period from 1644 to 1645 became known as the Year of Miracles because of his brilliant military successes, but he was finally defeated at Philiphaugh, near Selkirk, in September of 1645.\n\nLord Gray was ordered to be banished from Scotland for his support of the Royalist cause.\n\nThe sentence was never carried out, however, but he was excommunicated by the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.\n\nWilliam Gray of Pittendrum was another devoted Royalist and commanded one of Charles II’s regiments at the battle of Worcester, fought in September of 1651.\n\nThe forces of Oliver Cromwell soundly defeated the Royalists, and the king was forced to flee into exile, while William Gray was killed six years later in a duel.\n\nThe fortunes of the Grays in the north of Scotland were closely allied to those of Clan Stewart of Atholl and Clan Sutherland.\n\nAny Grays of today who can trace a descent from the ancient homelands of these clans are accordingly entitled to share in their heritage and traditions and adopt their respective tartans.\n\nThere are, however, several Gray coats of arms, crests, and mottos, including the motto of ‘Anchor fast anchor’ and crest of an anchor.\n\nGrays are also considered a sept, or branch, of both clans, and the motto of Clan Sutherland is ‘Without fear’, while its crest is a cat.\n\nSutherland, south of Caithness in the far north of Scotland, is the homeland from which the Sutherlands took their name, and the Sutherland earldom is claimed to be the oldest in Britain.\n\nOne tradition is that the MacGlashan/ Gray link with the clan arose when the son of a laird of Foulis sought refuge in the Sutherland homelands after killing a prominent citizen of Dundee.\n\n‘MacGlashan’, one of the Scottish Gaelic forms of Gray, was the name of a clan that became attached to the Stewarts of Atholl, with one theory being that they may have acted as property lawyers to this clan whose motto is ‘Courage grows strong at a wound’, and whose crest is a pelican feeding its young.\n\nThere is also a tradition that the link arose when a son of the house of the Stewarts of Ballechin, a branch of the Stewarts of Atholl, changed his name to MacGlashan after a bitter family feud.\n\nAs kinsfolk of the Stewarts of Atholl, one of the several branches of the Royal House of Stewart that had its origins in the twelfth century, the MacGlashans/Grays fought for the Jacobite cause during the abortive 1745 Rising.\n\nPrince Charles Edward Stuart had stepped ashore on the small Outer Hebridean island of Eriskay on July 22, 1745, landing on the mainland at Loch nan Uamh three days later.\n\nThe Jacobite Standard was raised on August 19, at Glenfinnan, on Loch Shiel.\n\nVictory over the government forces was achieved at the battle of Prestonpans in September, and in October the confident prince and his army set off on the long march south to London to claim what was believed to be the rightful Stuart inheritance of the throne.\n\nThe army reached only as far as Derby, however, before the controversial decision was taken in early December to withdraw back over the border.\n\nThey were destined to pay a bloody price for their support, however, when Jacobite hopes were dashed forever at the battle of Culloden, fought on Drummossie Moor, near Inverness, on April 16, 1746.\n\nIn what was the last major battle fought on British soil, hundreds of clansmen died on the battlefield while hundreds of others died later from their wounds and the brutal treatment of their government captors.\n\nThe Atholl Brigade had been in the thick of the fighting at Culloden, posted on the extreme right of the front line, and suffered heavy casualties.\n\nRead more\n\nOf high degree\n\nA name of ancient roots, ‘Gray’ and its popular spelling variant of ‘Grey’ has a number of possible points of origin.\n\nOne is that it derives from the Old English ‘graeg’, descriptive of someone who had grey hair, a grey beard or habitually wore grey-coloured clothing, while it is also a locational name.\n\nSome sources assert the first bearer of the name was the Norman Fulbert de Croy – with ‘Croy’ a French form of ‘Gray’ – who took his name from the lands of Croy in Picardy.\n\nGreat Chamberlain to Robert, Duke of Normandy, who granted him the lands, he is reputed to have been the father of Arlotta, the mother of Duke William of Normandy who is better known to posterity as William the Conqueror.\n\nSome sources state the name first came to England in the form of Anchetil de Greye, who accompanied Duke William in the Norman Invasion of England in 1066.\n\nAnchetil de Greye – with ‘Anchetil’ derived from a Norse form of ‘God-Cauldron’ – is believed to have taken his surname from his estate of what today is Graye-sur-Mer, in Calvados.\n\nAs reward for his services to William, who usurped the Anglo-Saxon monarchy to become England’s William I, he was granted the estate of Redrefield – later known as Rotherfield Greys – and the manor house now known as Grey’s Court in South Oxfordshire.\n\nHis descendants also came to possess lands in West Oxfordshire and in Kent, but it is with Northumberland, in the far north of England, that the Grays/Greys came to be particularly identified.\n\nA vast area, Northumberland was for centuries a blood-soaked battleground for feuding English and Scottish Borders’ clans and also warring armies; in Scotland and Ireland, the Gray/Grey name was also found as an Anglicisation of the Gaelic ‘riabach.’\n\nAnchetil de Greye, meanwhile, was the great-grandfather of John de Gray, the Bishop of Durham who was a trusted advisor of John, who reigned as King of England from 1199 to 1216.\n\nHis date and place of birth are not known, but what is known is that it was as reward for his services to John that in 1200 he was granted the lucrative and powerful post of Bishop of Norwich.\n\nAs further reward, the King in 1205 attempted to have him recognised as Archbishop of Canterbury – but Pope Innocent III refused to recognise the appointment, in favour of Stephen Langton.\n\nAppointed Governor of Ireland in 1209, he died in 1214 only a few days after being appointed Bishop of Durham.\n\nHis nephew Walter de Gray also held high office. Born in Norfolk in about 1180, the son of John de Gray the Elder, of Eaton, it was through his uncle’s influence with King John that he first rose to prominence.\n\nAppointed Lord Chancellor of England in 1205 and later Bishop of Lichfield and then Bishop of Worcester, he was present in 1215 at Runnymede, beside the River Thames, in Surrey, when John signed the famous charter of English civil liberties known as the Magna Carta – Great Charter – an act that had been forced on him by his disaffected and powerful barons.\n\nFollowing John’s death a year later, Walter de Gray acted as a royal official during the minority of Henry III.\n\nLater appointed Archbishop of York he was responsible for building the south transept of York Minster and buying the village of Bishopthorpe, which became the official residence of the Archbishop of York; he died in 1255.\n\nAnother descendant of Anchetil de Greye was the soldier and courtier John de Grey, 1st Baron Grey de Rotherfield.\n\nBorn in 1300 and serving as Lord Steward of the Royal Household of Edward III, he was one of the founding members in 1348 of The Most Noble Order of the Garter – which today survives as the highest order of chivalry in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth and is dedicated to St George, England’s patron saint.\n\nMembership of the exclusive Order is awarded at the ruling monarch’s pleasure and, with its motto of Honi soit qui mal y pense – Shame on him who thinks evil of it – membership is limited, apart from the monarch and the Prince of Wales, to no more than 24 ‘Companions’ at a time.\n\nBack in the early Gray/Grey heartland of present-day Northumberland, Sir Thomas Grey, born in 1384 at Castle Heaton, near Norham, was along with Henry Scrope, 3rd Baron Scrope of Masham and Richard Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge, executed for their role in an abortive attempt to assassinate King Henry V.\n\nKnown as the Southampton Plot, the plan had been to assassinate the king before he boarded ship at Southampton for France and replace him on the throne with Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March.\n\nHopelessly incompetent in their planning, the plot was revealed to the king in July of 1415 and Grey and his fellow conspirators duly beheaded at the North Gate of Southampton the following month.\n\nA half-brother of King Edward V through his mother Elizabeth Woodville, Sir Richard Grey was the knight who also fell victim to the complex family and political machinations of his time.\n\nBorn in 1457, his father Sir John de Grey of Groby was killed during the tumultuous period known as the Wars of the Roses fighting for the House of Lancaster against the rival House of York at the second battle of St Albans in February of 1461.\n\nSuspected of having entertained his own ambitions to the throne following the succession of his half-brother and, later, by Richard, Duke of Gloucester as Richard III, he was executed at Pontefract Castle in June of 1483.\n\nOne particularly tragic bearer of the name was Lady Jane Grey, also known as Lady Jane Dudley and, to posterity, as “The Nine Days’ Queen.”\n\nBorn in 1536, a great-grand-daughter of Henry VII through his younger daughter Mary and a first cousin once removed of Edward VI, it was in 1553 that she married Lord Guildford Dudley, younger son of John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland.\n\nWhen she was aged only 15, the dying Edward VI nominated her as his successor – subverting the claims to the throne of his half-sisters Mary and Elizabeth.\n\nDespite his dying wish, the hapless Jane was imprisoned in the Tower of London for a time.\n\nIn the complex faction fighting of the age, she was released and proclaimed Queen – reigning only from July 10 of 1553 until July 19 when she was convicted of high treason and sentenced to death by the Privy Council which had switched its allegiance to Mary.\n\nAlso convicted of treason, her husband was publicly executed at Tower Hill, outside the Tower, while Jane was subjected to the gruesome ordeal of being beheaded at Tower Green, inside the Tower, in February of 1554.\n\nOthers who fell victim to the executioner’s axe after having been found guilty of treason by usurping the throne were Edward Stanley, 3rd Earl of Derby and John Bourchier, 2nd Earl of Bath.\n\nYet another tragic figure was Lady Jane Grey’s younger sister, Lady Catherine Grey, also known as Catherine Seymour, Countess of Hereford.\n\nBorn in 1540, it was in 1560 that she incurred the vicious wrath of Elizabeth, who had succeeded Mary on the throne, by marrying one of her favourites, Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hereford.\n\nBased on totally unfounded suspicions that Catherine and her husband had designs on the throne, they were officially censured as “fornicators” and, deemed guilty of “carnal copulation”, their marriage was annulled by the Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nThis ensured that Catherine and her two young sons were now ineligible to take up the throne.\n\nPlaced under what today would be termed ‘house arrest’, she died in 1568 from consumption.\n\nIn later years, both she and her husband were reunited in death by being re-interred together in Salisbury Cathedral.\n\nScience and invention\n\nIn later centuries, bearers of the Gray and Grey names have achieved fame through decidedly more peaceful endeavours and pursuits, not least in the sciences.\n\nBorn in 1748, Edward Whitaker Gray was the English physician, botanist and zoologist noted as having been a keeper of the natural history and antiquities department of the British Museum, London; author of the highly detailed 1791 Catalogue of Shells, he died in 1806.\n\nHe was the uncle of Samuel Frederick Gray, the noted botanist, mycologist and pharmacologist born in London in 1766.\n\nAuthor of pioneering reference works that include his 1823 The Operative Chemist, he died in 1828, while he was also the author seven years before his death of The Natural Arrangement of British Plants.\n\nOn American shores, Asa Gray was the nineteenth century botanist celebrated as having methodically and tirelessly classified the vast majority of the plants of North America.\n\nBorn in 1810 in Sauquoit, New York, it was after having been appointed the first professor of botany and zoology at the University of Michigan and later professor of natural history at Harvard University, that he published works that include the grandly titled Manual of the Botany of the Northern United States, from New England to Wisconsin and south to Ohio and Pennsylvania Inclusive.\n\nWith illustrations by Isaac Sprague and more popularly, and briefly, known simply as Gray’s Manual, it remains a classic of the genre to this day.\n\nHe died in 1888, while Gray’s Peak, in Colorado, is named in his honour and the Asa Gray Award is awarded by the American Society of Plant Taxonomists to honour botanists.\n\nThe U.S. Postal Service issued an Asa Gray postage stamp in his honour in 2011 as part of its American Scientists collection.\n\nIn the world of engineering, Thomas Lomar Gray was the Scottish engineer who, along with James Alfred Ewing and John Milne, carried out pioneering work in seismology.\n\nBorn in 1850 in Lochgelly, Fife and a graduate in engineering from Glasgow University, it was while he was working with Ewing and Milne at the Imperial College of Engineering in Tokyo, Japan that between 1880 and 1895 he developed the first seismometers to detect earthquake activity.\n\nLater professor of dynamic engineering at what is now the Rose-Hullman Institute of Technology in Terre Haute, Indiana, he died in 1908.\n\nIn the abstract world of higher mathematics, Alfred Gray, born in 1939 in Dallas, Texas, was the leading American mathematician renowned for his work in the fields of differential geometry and differential equations.\n\nProfessor of mathematics at Maryland University, he died in 1998.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Nigel de Gray was the code-breaker who, working from the highly secret British code-breaking facility at Bletchley Park, Buckinghamshire, was part of the team who decrypted German radio traffic through the Enigma cypher machine.\n\nBorn in 1886 in Copdock, Suffolk and a descendant of the 5th Lord Walsingham, he had also been responsible during the First World War for decrypting the Zimmerman Telegram.\n\nThis was a telegram from the German Foreign Secretary Arthur Zimmerman to the German ambassador in Mexico instructing him to offer military aid to help them ‘take’ the American states of Arizona, New Texas and New Mexico in return for Mexico siding with Germany in the war.\n\nIt was the revelation of this telegram that proved a major factor in the previously ‘isolationist’ United States entering the war against Germany; later working as a deputy director of GCHQ in Cheltenham, Gray died in 1951.\n\nIn the world of medicine, Henry Gray, born in 1827 and who died in 1861, was the English surgeon and anatomist famous for the medical textbook Gray’s Anatomy.\n\nKnown as ‘The Bible of Anatomy’, seven editions were published between 1860 and 1880 alone, while a 40th edition was published in 2008 to mark the 150th anniversary of its first publication.\n\nIn the world of contemporary politics, Iain Gray is the Scottish Labour Party politician, born in 1957, who served as leader of his party as Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for East Lothian from September of 2008 until December of 2011.\n\nIn nineteenth century politics, Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey and Viscount Howick of Howick Hall, Northumberland, born in 1764, served as the British Whig Party Prime Minister from November of 1830 until July of 1834.\n\nA leading advocate of Parliamentary reform and instrumental in the passage of the landmark Reform Act of 1832, he died in 1845, while he also lends his name to the tea blend known as Earl Grey.\n\nA blend of citrus flavour derived from oil extracted from the rind of bergamot orange, it is complemented by the equally noted blend of Lady Grey, named for his wife.\n\nIn the artistic world, Effie Gray, born Euphemia Chalmers Gray in Perth, Scotland, in 1828 and later better known as Lady Millais, was the wife of the famed Pre-Raphaelite painter John Everett Millais.\n\nShe was the subject of an unusual love triangle, when, after marrying the author and literary critic John Ruskin, she separated from him to marry Millais.\n\nAccording to accounts, Effie and Ruskin never actually consummated their marriage – although Ruskin was deeply in love with her – and their marriage was annulled in 1854.\n\nMarrying Millais a year after the annulment and the subject of a number of his paintings, she died in 1897.\n\nBuried in Kinnoul Churchyard, Perthshire and the inspiration for Millais’ poignant painting The Vale of Rest, she has been the subject of a number of literary works and films that include the 2013 film Effie, produced by Emma Thompson and with Dakota Fleming in the title role.\n\nRead more"
