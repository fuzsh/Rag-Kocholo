In 1832 he succeeded Dr. Royle as the Superintendent of the\n\nBotanic Gardens at Saharunpur; and in 1848, after spending some years in\n\nEngland, he was appointed Superintendent of the Calcutta Botanical Garden\n\nand Professor of Botany in the Medical College. Although Falconer held an\n\nimportant botanical post for many years, he is chiefly known as a\n\nPalaeozoologist. He seems, however, to have had a share in introducing\n\nCinchona into India. His discovery, in company with Colonel Sir Proby T.\n\nCautley, of Miocene Mammalia in the Siwalik Hills, was at the time perhaps\n\nthe greatest \"find\" which had been made. The fossils of the Siwalik Hills\n\nformed the subject of Falconer's most important book, \"Fauna Antiqua\n\nSivalensis,\" which, however, remained unfinished at the time of his death.\n\nFalconer also devoted himself to the investigation of the cave-fauna of\n\nEngland, and contributed important papers on fossils found in Sicily,\n\nMalta, and elsewhere. Dr. Falconer was a Vice-President of the Royal\n\nSociety and Foreign Secretary of the Geological Society. \"Falconer did\n\nenough during his lifetime to render his name as a palaeontologist immortal\n\nin science; but the work which he published was only a fraction of what he\n\naccomplished...He was cautious to a fault; he always feared to commit\n\nhimself to an opinion until he was sure he was right, and he died in the\n\nprime of his life and in the fulness of his power.\" (Biographical sketch\n\ncontributed by Charles Murchison to his edition of Hugh Falconer's\n\n\"Palaeontological Memoirs and Notes,\" London, 1868; \"Proc. R. Soc.\" Volume\n\nXV., page xiv., 1867: \"Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc.\" Volume XXI., page xlv,\n\n1865.) Hugh Falconer was among those who did not fully accept the views\n\nexpressed in the \"Origin of Species,\" but he could differ from Darwin\n\nwithout any bitterness. Two years before the book was published, Darwin\n\nwrote to Asa Gray: \"The last time I saw my dear old friend Falconer he\n\nattacked me most vigorously, but quite kindly, and told me, 'You will do\n\nmore harm than any ten naturalists will do good. I can see that you have\n\nalready corrupted and half spoiled Hooker.'\" (\"Life and Letters,\" II.,\n\npage 121.) The affectionate regard which Darwin felt for Falconer was\n\nshared by their common friend Hooker. The following extract of a letter\n\nfrom Hooker to Darwin (February 3rd, 1865) shows clearly the strong\n\nfriendships which Falconer inspired: \"Poor old Falconer! how my mind runs\n\nback to those happiest of all our days that I used to spend at Down twenty\n\nyears ago--when I left your home with my heart in my mouth like a\n\nschoolboy. We last heard he was ill on Wednesday or Thursday, and sent\n\ndaily to enquire, but the report was so good on Saturday that we sent no\n\nmore, and on Monday night he died...What a mountainous mass of admirable\n\nand accurate information dies with our dear old friend! I shall miss him\n\ngreatly, not only personally, but as a scientific man of unflinching and\n\nuncompromising integrity--and of great weight in Murchisonian and other\n\ncounsels where ballast is sadly needed.\"\n\n-article in \"Natural History Review.\"\n\n-Darwin's Copley medal and.\n\n-Darwin's criticism of his elephant work.\n\n-Darwin's regard for.\n\n-Forbes attacked by.\n\n-his opinion of Forbes.\n\n-goes to India.\n\n-Hooker's regard for.\n\n-letter to Darwin.\n\n-letter to Sharpey.\n\n-letters to.\n\n-letter to \"Athenaeum.\"\n\n-Lyell and.\n\n-on Mastodon andium.\n\n-on Mastodon of Australia.\n\n-on elephants.\n\n-Owen and.\n\n-on phyllotaxis.\n\n-on Plagiaulax.\n\n-speech at Cambridge.\n\n-\"Memoirs.\"\n\nFalkland Islands, Darwin visits.\n\n-Polyborus sp. in.\n\n-brightly coloured female hawk.\n\n-effect of subsidence.\n\n-streams of stones.\n\nFanciers, use made of Selection by.\n\nFantails, see Pigeons.\n\nFaraday, memorial to.\n\nFaramea, dimorphism.\n\nFarmer, Prof. J.B., and S.E.

He was called to the Bar, but gave up practice for the\n\npublic service, where he became Permanent Secretary of the Board of Trade.\n\nAccording to the \"Times,\" October 13th, 1899, \"for nearly forty years he\n\nwas synonymous with the Board in the opinion of all who were brought into\n\nclose relation with it.\" He was made a baronet in 1883; he retired from\n\nhis post a few years later, and was raised to the peerage in 1893. His\n\nfriendship with Mr. Darwin was of many years' standing, and opportunities\n\nof meeting were more frequent in the last ten years of Mr. Darwin's life,\n\nowing to Lord Farrer's marriage with Miss Wedgwood, a niece of Mrs.\n\nDarwin's, and the subsequent marriage of his son Horace with Miss Farrer.\n\nHis keen love of science is attested by the letters given in the present\n\nvolume. He published several excellent papers on the fertilisation of\n\nflowers in the \"Ann. and Mag. of Natural History,\" and in \"Nature,\" between\n\n1868 and 1874.\n\nIn Politics he was a Radical--a strong supporter of free trade: on this\n\nlast subject, as well as on bimetallism, he was frequently engaged in\n\npublic controversy. He loyally carried out many changes in the legislature\n\nwhich, as an individualist, he would in his private capacity have\n\nstrenuously opposed.\n\nIn the \"Speaker,\" October 21st, 1899, Lord Welby heads his article on Lord\n\nFarrer with a few words of personal appreciation:--\n\n\"In Lord Farrer has passed away a most interesting personality. A great\n\ncivil servant; in his later years a public man of courage and lofty ideal;\n\nin private life a staunch friend, abounding as a companion in humour and\n\nripe knowledge. Age had not dimmed the geniality of his disposition, or an\n\nintellect lively and eager as that of a boy--lovable above all in the\n\ntransparent simplicity of his character.\"\n\n-interest in Torbitt's potato experiment.\n\n-letters to.\n\n-on earthworms.\n\n-observations on fertilisation of Passiflora.\n\n-recollections of Darwin.\n\n-seeds sent to.\n\nFawcett, Henry (1833-84): Professor of Political Economy at Cambridge,\n\n1863, Postmaster-General 1880-84.

Forbes\n\npublished many papers on geological, zoological, and botanical subjects,\n\none of his most remarkable contributions being the well-known essay \"On the\n\nConnexion between the Distribution of the Existing Fauna and Flora of the\n\nBritish Isles and the Geological Changes which have affected their area\"\n\n(\"Mem.

In 1899 he was appointed to the Imperial\n\nGesundheits-Amt in Berlin, and raised to the rank of Regierungsrath.\n\nFrank is chiefly known for his work on \"The Assimilation of Free\n\nNitrogen, etc.,\" and for his work on \"The Diseases of Plants\" (\"Die\n\nKrankheiten der Pflanzen,\" 1880). It was his brilliant researches on\n\ngrowth-curvature (\"Beitrage zur Pflanzen-physiologie,\" 1868, and \"Die\n\nNaturlichen wagerechte Richtung von Pflanzen-theilen,\" 1870) which\n\nexcited Darwin's admiration.\n\n-Darwin's admiration for his work.\n\nFranklin, Sir J., search expedition.\n\nFraser, G., letter to.\n\n\"Fraser's Magazine,\" article by Hopkins.\n\n-article by Galton on twins.\n\n-Huxley on review in.\n\nFreemasons' Tavern, meeting held at.\n\nFreewill, a preordained necessity.\n\nFreke, Dr., paper by.\n\nFreshwater, Bee-orchis at.\n\nFreshwater fauna, ocean faunas compared with.\n\n-poverty of.\n\n-preservation of.\n\nFriendly Islands, rats regarded as game.\n\nFringillidae, colour and sexual selection.\n\nFrogs, article on spawn of.\n\n-F.

This width of culture was combined with a severe and narrow\n\nreligious creed, and though, as Edmund Gosse points out, there was in his\n\nfather's case no reconcilement of science and religion, since his\n\n\"impressions of nature\" had to give way absolutely to his \"convictions of\n\nreligion,\" yet he was not debarred by his views from a friendly intercourse\n\nwith Darwin. He did much to spread a love of Natural History, more\n\nespecially by his seaside books, and by his introduction of the aquarium--\n\nthe popularity of which (as Mr. Edmund Gosse shows) is reflected in the\n\npages of \"Punch,\" especially in John Leech's illustrations. Kingsley said\n\nof him (quoted by Edmund Gosse, page 344) \"Since White's \"History of\n\nSelborne\" few or no writers on Natural History, save Mr. Gosse and poor Mr.\n\nEdward Forbes, have had the power of bringing out the human side of\n\nscience, and giving to seemingly dry disquisitions...that living and\n\npersonal interest, to bestow which is generally the special function of the\n\npoet.\" Among his books are the \"Naturalist's Sojourn in Jamaica,\" 1851; \"A\n\nNaturalist's Rambles on the Devonshire Coast,\" 1853; \"Omphalos,\" 1857; \"A\n\nYear at the Shore,\" 1865.

He became interested in science when a student at the Fairfield\n\nAcademy; he took his doctor's degree in 1831, but instead of pursuing\n\nmedical work he accepted the post of Instructor in Chemistry, Mineralogy,\n\nand Botany in the High School of Utica. Gray afterwards became assistant\n\nto Professor Torrey in the New York Medical School, and in 1835 he was\n\nappointed Curator and Librarian of the New York Lyceum of Natural History.\n\nFrom 1842 to 1872 he occupied the Chair of Natural History in Harvard\n\nCollege, and the post of Director of the Cambridge Botanical Gardens; from\n\n1872 till the time of his death he was relieved of the duties of teaching\n\nand of the active direction of the Gardens, but retained the Herbarium.\n\nProfessor Gray was a Foreign Member of the Linnean and of the Royal\n\nSocieties. The \"Flora of North America\" (of which the first parts appeared\n\nin 1838), \"Manual of the Botany of the Northern United States, the Botany\n\nof Commodore Wilkes' South Pacific Exploring Expedition\" are among the most\n\nimportant of Gray's systematic memoirs; in addition to these he wrote\n\nseveral botanical text-books and a great number of papers of first-class\n\nimportance. In an obituary notice written by Sir Joseph Hooker, Asa Gray\n\nis described as \"one of the first to accept and defend the doctrine of\n\nNatural Selection..., so that Darwin, whilst fully recognising the\n\ndifferent standpoints from which he and Gray took their departures, and\n\ntheir divergence of opinion on important points, nevertheless regarded him\n\nas the naturalist who had most thoroughly gauged the \"Origin of Species,\"\n\nand as a tower of strength to himself and his cause\" (\"Proc.

Leonard: The following sketch of the life of\n\nRev. Leonard Blomefield is taken from his \"Chapters in my Life; Reprint\n\nwith Additions\" (privately printed), Bath, 1889. He was born, as he states\n\nwith characteristic accuracy, at 10 p.m., May 25th, 1800; and died at Bath,\n\nSeptember 1st, 1893. His father--a second cousin of Soame Jenyns, from\n\nwhom he inherited Bottisham Hall, in Cambridgeshire--was a parson-squire of\n\nthe old type, a keen sportsman, and a good man of business. Leonard\n\nJenyns' mother was a daughter of the celebrated Dr. Heberden, in whose\n\nhouse in Pall Mall he was born. Leonard was educated at Eton and\n\nCambridge, and became curate of Swaffham Bulbeck, a village close to his\n\nfather's property; he was afterwards presented to the Vicarage of the\n\nparish, and held the living for nearly thirty years. The remainder of his\n\nlife he spent at Bath. He was an excellent field-naturalist and a minute\n\nand careful observer. Among his writings may be mentioned the Fishes in\n\n\"Zoology of the Voyage of the 'Beagle,'\" 1842, a \"Manual of British\n\nVertebrate Animals,\" 1836, a \"Memoir\" of Professor Henslow,1862, to which\n\nDarwin contributed recollections of his old master, \"Observations in\n\nNatural History,\" 1846 and \"Observations in Meteorology,\" 1858, besides\n\nnumerous papers in scientific journals. In his \"Chapters\" he describes\n\nhimself as showing as a boy the silent and retiring nature, and also the\n\nlove of \"order, method, and precision,\" which characterised him through\n\nlife; and he adds, \"even to old age I have been often called a VERY\n\nPARTICULAR GENTLEMAN.\" In a hitherto unpublished passage in his\n\nautobiographical sketch, Darwin wrote, \"At first I disliked him from his\n\nsomewhat grim and sarcastic expression; and it is not often that a first\n\nimpression is lost; but I was completely mistaken, and found him very kind-\n\nhearted, pleasant, and with a good stock of humour.\" Mr. Jenyns records\n\nthat as a boy he was by a stranger taken for a son of his uncle, Dr.\n\nHeberden (the younger), whom he closely resembled.\n\n-letters to.\n\n-mentioned.\n\nJodrell Laboratory, Darwin's interest in.\n\n-note on.\n\nJordanhill, Smith of, on Gibraltar.\n\n\"Journal of Researches,\" Darwin's.\n\nJudd, Prof. J.W., letter to.\n\n-recollections of Darwin.\n\n-on Darwin's \"Volcanic Islands.\"\n\n-Darwin in praise of work of.\n\nJukes, on imperfection of the Geological Record.\n\n-on changes of climate.\n\n-on formation of river-valleys.\n\n-over estimates sub-aerieal denudation.\n\nJumps, variation by.\n\nJuncus, range of.\n\n-J. bufonius.\n\n-variation of.\n\n-germination of seed from mud carried by woodcock.\n\nJura, Darwin on erratic blocks of.\n\nJussieu, A. de.\n\nKane's, E.K., \"Arctic Explorations,\" use of foxtails by Esquimaux\n\nreferred to in.\n\nKelvin, Lord, Address at the British Association Meeting at Edinburgh\n\n(1871).\n\n-on geological time.\n\n-on age of the earth.\n\n-on origin of plant-life from meteorites.\n\nKemp, W., sends seeds to Darwin.\n\n-on vitality of seeds.\n\nKensington, proposed removal of British Museum (Bloomsbury) collections\n\nto.\n\nKerguelen cabbage, Chambers versus Hooker on the.\n\nKerguelen island, coal-beds of.\n\n-relation of flora to that of Fuegia.\n\n-similarity between plants of S.
