This real-time artwork is an aesthetic exploration of our cosmic neighborhood. Deriving pitch, rhythm, color and more from the relationship between the sun, planets, and various moons, the artwork registers an audio-visual environment based on the cosmic math of our solar system. Utilizing both compositional logic and artistic liberty, we created a sound and light installation for immersing oneself in these rhythms. It is a place for centering and also considering other centers in space and time. \n\nThe spatial sound was carefully developed and refined by partnering with @mediaapes We created the artwork using their software @auralite3d to tune more articulation and legibility of the sound in 3D space which coincided with the lighting events.\n\nVideo and photo captured by @aramphoto \n\n#MACsolstice23 #mountauburncemetery #masarystudios #tradition #wintersolstice #lightart #soundart #mediaart #cosmic #SOLSTICE #meditation #spatialsound #spatiallight #infinite #cosmicclock #asagray #realtimeart #touchdesigner\".",
