An early interest in plants led him to pursue botany as a hobby, one that became his life’s work. Formally trained and educated in medical science, Gray nevertheless continued to pursue botany (which wasn’t really a profession at that time) by taking leaves of absence to travel around the eastern United States collecting and classifying plant samples. His ‘hobby’ eventually grew to the point where his personal collection of plants and books on the subject numbered in the thousands.\n\nIn 1842, Asa Gray accepted a position at Harvard University as professor of natural history. By the end of the American Civil War, Gray had donated his entire botanical collection to Harvard, effectively creating Harvard’s Department of Botany. To this day the herbarium at Harvard University is named in his honor.\n\nOver the course of his life, Gray identified hundreds of new plant species and has had many named for him. He was also a prolific writer, publishing many articles, manuals and textbooks. His most famous work, titled ‘Manual of the Botany of the Northern United States, from New England to Wisconsin and South to Ohio and Pennsylvania Inclusive’ but more commonly known as 'Gray’s Manual,' is still in print today. The highest award granted by the American Society of Plant Taxonomists is known as the Asa Gray Award.\n\n(Source: britannica.com)\n\nDescription:\n\nSee Long Description above.Date of birth: 11/18/1810Date of death: 01/30/1888Area of notoriety: Science/TechnologyMarker Type: Horizontal MarkerSetting: OutdoorVisiting Hours/Restrictions: 8:00 am to 5:00 pmFee required?: NoWeb site: [Web Link]\n\nVisit Instructions:\n\nTo post a visit log for waymarks in this category, you must have personally visited the waymark location.
