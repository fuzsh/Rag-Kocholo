(Time since PhD degree can be extended by 1 year for each child born or adopted during this period if the applicant has been a primary care giver. Other forms of exceptional caregiving responsibility [e.g., partner, spouse, aged parent, etc]. or extenuating circumstances will be considered on a case-by-case basis.)\n\nThis award was established in memory of Jasper Loftus-Hills (1946–1974), an Australian biologist of exceptional promise, whose career was cut short just three years after receiving his degree when he was killed by a hit-and-run driver while tape-recording frog calls along a Texas highway. The award includes presentation of a research paper at the annual meeting of the American Society of Naturalists, an award of $700, a travel allowance of $700, the cost of registration at the meetings, and a supplement of $500 in case of intercontinental travel.\n\nInformation on how to apply/nominate for the ASN Early Career Investigator Award\n\nFor YouTube video of past Early Career Investigator Awards presentations, see the ASN YouTube channel:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8FDICm2TYLT-y1FB8gcQlA\n\n2024 Stepfanie M.

Bolnick, “‘Her Joyous Enthusiasm for Her Life-Work …’: Early Women Authors in The American Naturalist” 192:655–663:\n\nJulia B. Platt (1857–1935) had credentials to impress. She studied embryology at Harvard in 1887 and then conducted research at Woods Hole, Bryn Mawr, the University of Chicago, Radcliffe, Hopkins Marine Laboratory, and at several German universities. She received her PhD in developmental biology in 1898 and then published 12 articles in just 10 years, including one in The American Naturalist in 1899. Most notably, she showed that neural crest cells formed the jaw cartilage and tooth dentine in salamanders. This conclusion was rejected by her contemporaries, who believed that only mesoderm formed bones and cartilage. It took 50 years for her hypothesis to be confirmed. Despite her depth of training and her productivity, she landed none of the academic positions for which she applied. Platt then wrote, “Without work, life is not worth living. If I cannot obtain the work I wish, then I must take up the next best” (quoted in Zottoli and Seyfarth 1994). She moved to Pacific Grove, California (where the American Society of Naturalists has recently held its stand-alone conferences), and became its first female mayor. She is noted for initiating marine protected reserves that were crucial for the survival of the California sea otter (Palumbi and Sotka 2012).\n\nASN Outstanding Student Presentation\n\nThe ASN Outstanding Student Presentation was established for American Society of Naturalists stand-alone meetings, which occur every few years, to recognize an outstanding student presentation made at the meeting. The winner of the award receives $400.\n\n2023 Julia Harenčár and Callie Chappell\n\nHonorable mention: Sarah Goodnight 2021 (not awarded at remote meeting) 2020 Sheela Turbek 2018 Katherine Eisen, \"The effects of community context and wet-year vs. dry-year dynamics on pollinator-mediated selection in Clarkia (Onagraceae) in the southern Sierra foothills (Kern County, CA)\"\n\nHonorable Mentions: James Peniston, Shane DuBay, Theodora Block 2016 Amanda Hund, \"Parasite mediated sexual selection and speciation in the barn swallow species complex\" 2014 Marjorie Weber, “Merging phylogenetic and experimental methods to test hypotheses about the evolution of mutualistic defensive traits in plants”\n\nHonorable Mentions: Jason Shapiro and Rachael Bay\n\nNB: Starting with the 2022 award year, this award was renamed the ASN Outstanding Student Presentation. Previously it was known as the Ed Ricketts Student Presentation Award and the Ed Ricketts Student Talk Award."
