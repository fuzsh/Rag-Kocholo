He is the former director of the university-wide Ph.D./J.D. program in justice studies, law, and the social sciences. In the 1980s, he helped create the Herbert Blumer Institute in Costa Rica, which maintains the goal of discovering and describing alternatives to violence and criminal law. His seminal book \"Law and Society\" (with James Inverarity and Barry Feld) has been translated into Japanese. His related research has been published in Spanish, German, and Italian. He is a recipient of Fulbright Research Fellowships to Costa Rica and Austria and has been a visiting scholar and professor at the University of Lecci, Italy, the University of Austria, and Stanford University. His book with Sing Chew explores the research of Andre Gundre Frank and his famous critique of world development and the marginalization of diversity. The second edition of Invitation to Globalogy: Hegemony Unmasked has also received critical acclaim.\n\nEducation\n\nPh.D. Stanford University\n\nM.S.
