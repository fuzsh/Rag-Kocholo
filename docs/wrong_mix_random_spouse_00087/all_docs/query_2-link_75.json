        "text": "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Kelly Strayhorn Theater Announces Fall 2023 Season: Brave Actions Bold Voices\n\nPublished: August 3, 2023\n\nThe function of art is to do more than tell it like it is –\n\nit’s to imagine what is possible.\n\n– bell hooks\n\nEAST LIBERTY, PA— The KST Presents Fall 2023 season is about celebrating the brave actions and bold voices of the artists, audiences, and communities who call KST home. The season features new offerings from Mutual Aid Residents Dreams of Hope and PearlArts, a visual art exhibition in the BOOM Gallery, two Freshworks Performances in Progress, and premieres of Local and Global Performances from longtime Pittsburgh favorites and returning faces.\n\nOur Mutual Aid Residencies continue to support Dreams of Hope and PearlArts with administrative facilities and space for ongoing classes and events. This fall, Dreams of Hope hosts the theatriQ educational workshop series, offering queer creatives ages 13 – 26 a space to learn, discuss, and connect through a plethora of topics pertaining to theater and the performing arts. PearlArts brings together Soy Sos and Ali Berger, and later Soy Sos, James Johnson III, and Erik Lawrence for two editions of the music and dance staple, Synchronized with Soy Sos. Later in the season, a dance-focused PearlPRESENTS will feature SPdp&SS founder Staycee Pearl alongside choreographers Raphael Xavier and Chitra Subramanian.\n\nCurated by DS Kinsel, the BOOM Gallery, located in KST’s historic 1914 lobby, presents Eternal Maternal. Featuring artworks from interdisciplinary artists Fran Flaherty and Meg Foley, the exhibition centers motherhood both as an active pursuit and a fundamental state of existence, irrespective of and subject to gender. Visit the gallery before performances from the opening on Monday, September 18 and Sunday, December 17 to experience the artists’ unique interpretations of the sacred practice.\n\nOur Fall 2023 Freshworks Residencies support exciting new performance works in process. On October 6 and 7, Pria Dahiya shares a “play-adjacent performance work” You and Me and The End of the World” that touches on loneliness and coming of age through a pandemic. On December 1 and 2, Andraya Rand-Mathis presents dance, music, and drag in Diving Within, part of a healing process from grief, heartbreak, and childhood trauma.\n\nKST’s Youth and Family programs feature a revamped Halloween celebration. Bring the whole crew to join us for Pumpkin Palooza, An East Liberty Halloween Adventure! There will be tricks, treats, performances, and crafts from community partners. Tune in August 10 for our complete Fall 2023 offerings from The Alloy School.\n\nThe KST Presents Local and Global Performance series welcomes Blood Baby from Detroit/Philadelphia-based artist Meg Foley, featuring four works from the series (Primordial, Queer Parent Convening, Communion, and Touch Library). Foley shares the performance Communion on Friday and Saturday, September 22 – 23. Don’t miss the Welcome Dinner & Artist Talk on September 18, where Foley will be in conversation with Fran Flarety; The Embodied Imaginary, a workshop with Foley on September 20; and a Queer Parent Convening later that evening. On December 8 and 9, Pittsburgh’s own superduo slowdanger takes to the KST mainstage with SUPERCELL, a new work addressing climate change and media sensitization.

House Party celebrates the legacy of KST with a night of entertainment and unforgettable flavor from local artists, including music and dance artists anna thompson and taylor knight of slowdanger with lighting and visual effects artist Cornelius Henke III, also known as ProjectileObjects, and multimedia queer-oriented video, installation, and performance artist Scott Andrew. Funds raised through House Party will support the KST Presents Fall 2023 season.\n\nInspired by the theatrics of Studio 54 and the iconic fashion of the Met Gala, House Party brings the mood with an immersive atmosphere and live performance. From the instagram-worthy VIP Reception to the rapturous Dance Party, you can expect a night of cool fantasy in the thick of Summer.\n\nBeginning at 7:00pm, VIP guests will arrive to encounter an installation in the KST lobby of digital portraits featuring the House Party Host Committee and KST Board of Directors created by Scott Andrew. Andrew has been a Pittsburgh resident for seventeen years, where he is a professor of digital media at University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University. Andrew co-founded the group Fail-Safe, a reoccurring frame for experimental performance, with artists Angela Washko and Jesse Styles, which was presented in the Fall 2022 season at KST. Andrew has also created media design and installations for House Party ‘22, last year’s Suite Life, and the March 2020 Freshworks presentation of I am a Haunted House in collaboration with dance artist Jesse Factor.\n\nMoving through the lobby, VIPs will encounter a transformed Theater, with the reception occurring on the main stage and throughout the auditorium. There, attendees will hear from Executive Director Joseph Hall and Board Chair Adam Golden, enjoy heavy hors d’oeuvres, and have exclusive access to an open bar. From the stage and the loge seating, VIPs will enjoy a performance from Pittsburgh staple slowdanger. Featuring their signature blend of electronic music, slithering and undulating movement vocabulary, and sharp eye for riveting and evocative aesthetics, slowdanger in collaboration with ProjectileObjects will present a short performance on a uniquely installed temporary stage constructed over the theater’s orchestra seating.\n\nPresented in the round for VIPs to experience from anywhere in the auditorium, the performance will give patrons a taste of the artists’ special brand of movement. slowdanger will be back at KST as a part of the Fall 2023 season, supported by House Party, with a new evening-length work to be announced later this summer. The project currently in development with support from KST was recently awarded $101,500 from New England Foundation for the Arts’ National Dance Project program.\n\nAdditionally, VIPs can have their fortune told to them through tarot card readings by Amber Eps a.k.a. Hollyhood and get custom House Party temporary tattoos from artist Zhen Lee.\n\nFollowing the VIP reception, guests move to the KST lobby for a signature dance party with disco vibes! Dance Party guests can join from 9:00pm – 12:00am to get down and celebrate KST with the East Liberty community, and will receive one drink ticket after which they can purchase signature House Party cocktails from the KST bar!\n\n“House Party is our summer blow-out party that showcases the work we do to support artists throughout the year,” said KST Executive Director Joseph Hall. “We invite you to join us for this once a year spectacular event! We encourage guests to dress to impress and get ready to sweat it out on the dance floor as only one does at KST.”\n\nHouse Party is supported by our Host Committee: Kenya T. Boswell, Dana Bishop-Root, Anne Chen, Gina & Idris Evans, Sherree Goldstein, David Finegold, Kenya Matthews, Rep. La’Tasha D. Mayes, Khari Mosley, Jessica Gaynelle Moss, Richard Parsakian, Barb Pugh, Hon. Erika Strassburger, Kannu Sahni, Gina Winstead & Donny Donovan.

Founded in 2013, slowdanger uses movement, integrative technology, found material, electronic instrumentation, vocalization, physiological centering, and ontological examination to produce their performance work. The more they engage in this collaborative work, the more they recognize the manifestation of their work as a non-binary entity that is one body amassed of multiple bodies in space. Each work seeks a deeper understanding through the practice of making. This ever evolving process is akin to the construction zone where inspiration was drawn for the name, slowdanger. anna and taylor have worked with Sidra Bell, Francesca Harper, Roderick George, Bill Shannon, MICHIYAYA Dance, Nile Harris, Jasmine Hearn, Maree Remalia|merrygogo, CorningWorks, Mark C. Thompson, The Pillow Project |Pearlann Porter, Jil Stifel, Shantelle Courvoisier Jackson and more.\n\nCornelius Henke III, a.k.a.

He has participated in residencies at MANCC, The Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center, The Yard Martha’s Vineyard, and Catskill Mountain Foundation. Cornelius is a contributing writer for VIDVOX and a partner at Merging Media, a boutique digital media production company based in Pittsburgh, PA.\n\nScott Andrew is a multimedia queer-oriented video, installation, and performance artist. He creates speculative fantasies that peer into otherworldly portals and voids. He has exhibited at MoMA’s PopRally Performance Series (NYC), Ballroom Marfa (Marfa, TX), the Hammer Museum (LA), and the J. Paul Getty Museum (LA), among others. Scott co-curates TQ Live! a yearly LGBTQ+ variety series that has been presented at the Andy Warhol Museum and the Carnegie Museum of Art. Along with Angela Washko and Jesse Stiles, Scott organizes a National Endowment for the Arts funded performance series called Fail-Safe, which seeks to provide a supportive space for the presentation and potential failure of performative works-in-progress. Other previous curatorial projects include the drift and the Institute for New Feeling’s Felt Book.\n\nDr. Amber Epps a.k.a. HollyHood a.k.a. Amber the Witch is a hedge witch, psychic, trance medium, root worker, and daughter of Oyá. As co-owner of Arts & Crafts: Botanica & Occult Shop, she and her partners were voted #1 psychics/tarot readers in the 2022 Pittsburgh City Paper’s Best of Reder’s Poll. Amber is also a curator, advocate, educator, musician, mom, and inter and transdisciplinary artist. She loves cats, tacos, and collard greens.\n\nYang Zhen Lee is a comics and tattoo artist who likes to dabble in many things.

KST’s Alloy Studios is a cultural hub in the heart of East Liberty, and the historic Kelly Strayhorn Theater is located in the thriving business district. More than 20 years after its founding, KST continues to use its broad reach to impact the contemporary arts and the community. KST’s mission is to be a home for creative experimentation, community dialogue, and collective action rooted in the liberation of Black and queer people. Welcome to The Soul of East Liberty!\n\nPhoto Credit: Beth Barbis, Liz Rudnick, Delaney Greenberg, Heidi Wiren Bartlett\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: KST Presents: Or Forever Hold Your Peace, from Big Storm Performance Company\n\nPublished: May 1, 2023\n\nEAST LIBERTY, PA — Kelly Strayhorn Theater is pleased to announce Or Forever Hold Your Peace, a 75 minute theater experience from Big Storm Performance Company. Based on the real-life experiences of the creators, this show explores the B plots, uncomfortable interactions, and opportunities for personal discovery that occur at weddings.\n\nOr Forever Hold Your Peace takes place at a Pennsylvania wedding in the late 2010s, where the sister of the bride is about to snap, the only guest who believes in love is a wedding crasher, the 13-year-old ring bearer has a secret mission, and everyone needs a change. Big Storm co-founder and artistic director José Pérez IV developed the show with co-founder and Team Health Specialist Taylor Couch. Both Couch and Pérez IV have built long standing relationships with Kelly Strayhorn Theater as teachers at The Alloy School. There, Couch teaches Creative Play, a “Parent & Me” style dance class for children six years old and younger, and Pérez IV is teacher emeritus of Capoeira, a dancelike martial art originating in Brazil. As one might expect from two dance teachers, movement and music are key elements in Or Forever Hold Your Peace.\n\n“I like the phrase ‘musical without singing’ because it describes how significant a role the dances play in this show,” says Couch. “If we called Or Forever ‘a play with dancing,’ it’s easier to imagine maybe one or two dance numbers that mesh into the play instead of the very musical-like spectacle that dance is in this piece.” In an interview with Pittsburgh City Paper’s Tia Bailey, Pérez adds, “You’ve probably not seen a show like this before. It’s very modern, physical, fun… We say ‘theater experience’ because, with a lot of the things we make, it’s not really accurate to just say, ‘It’s a play.’ We don’t feel bound to strictly traditional modes of performance, and that leads us to experiment with where we perform, how we interact with the audience, and the types of performance we combine in one show.”\n\nIt’s by design that Big Storm productions like Or Forever Hold Your Peace defy categorization. The company was created as a response to an industry that often alienates and excludes, and their philosophy focuses on mental health, accessibility, and passing on what the company refers to as “The Groove.” To quote their mission statement, “The Groove is our name for the good feeling you get when you’re jamming to music — that enlivening ‘under your skin’ feeling of rhythm and movement, and we aim to spread it with everything we do. From our mindful rehearsal and performance processes to our aim to create works that connect with as many people as possible, regardless of their previous arts experience, Big Storm brings joy.”\n\nJoin KST and BIG STORM for Or Forever Hold Your Peace on Friday & Saturday, May 19 – 20* and Wednesday – Saturday, May 24 – 27 at 8:00pm at KST’s Alloy Studios, 5530 Penn Ave. *Post Performance Discussion to be held on Saturday, May 20. Tickets are Pay What Moves You: $10 – $25.\n\nABOUT THE ARTISTS\n\nTaylor W Couch (she/her) is an Early Childhood Teaching Artist, Pittsburgh native, and Co-Founding Director of Big Storm Performance Company.

Over the past few years, Jess has performed with Big Storm in productions such as Say That To My Face and Portals on Penn. She would like to thank her fiancé, Phil Fry, for getting her to rehearsals on time and being a major support system over the past couple of months.

Olivia sends thanks to friends, family, the Highland Park pool, and the Phantom of the Attic comic book store for getting them through the tough times!\n\nMatt Vitullo (he/him) is thrilled to be in yet another Big Storm production! Matt graduated from the University of Pittsburgh for theater and has been performing in the city ever since. Previous roles include Benvolio in Romeo & Juliet (Pittsburgh Classic Players), a tea shop fighter in Portals on Penn (Big Storm), and a lovesick bard in Quest (Big Storm). When not performing, Matt can be found playing Dungeons & Dragons, gaming, reading, writing, or spending time with friends (as safely as possible, of course). “Thank you to Big Storm, especially José and Taylor, for making so much cool art that I get to participate in, and to my incredible friends who always give me support and lend me an ear while I talk about this show endlessly. Thank you!! :^)\n\nAriel / (they/them) is an interdisciplinary performance artist dancing onto the scene from underground art spaces in Pittsburgh, New York, Shanghai, the Bay, and Hong Kong.

Join us on Friday & Saturday, May 5 – 6, 8:00pm, at KST’s Alloy Studios for a look into this new work in development followed by a Q & A with the artist. Part archive, part resource guide, and part celebration, i’m not done with this body (and i never will be) is a multimedia performance about trans women and the sex hormone estrogen. In a time where access to trans healthcare is becoming ever more politicized, the multidimensional performance uplifts Pittsburgh’s trans community and gives shape and sound to the things trans women have felt and been unable to name: The truth that hormones change more than your appearance, and that the most shocking shift is in your brain.\n\n“You start to think differently. Your whole perception of the world around you changes, little by little, until you can’t remember what it was like before.” — B Kleymeyer\n\nTrans healthcare saves lives. Right now, the red tape, the waitlists, and the lack of accessibility makes transitioning in Pittsburgh without a strong support network a daunting task. i’m not done with this body (and i never will be) shouts the truths that doctors hide from and cis family and friends are afraid of. The work celebrates every part of transition, preserving the collective knowledge and experience of hormones toward collective understanding and, ultimately, protected access to life-giving care.\n\n“I think we see transition as this deeply personal, individual experience. And it can be, it can definitely be a time of great inner reflection, growth, and change. But it could also be a time of celebration and community. What if we were to honor transition as another milestone of life?” — B Kleymeyer\n\nOver the course of her residency, B has reached out to trans women living in Pittsburgh for their stories and experiences. About this communal writing process, B shares, “It’s an incredible experience to have a creative space with other trans women. This project started with a desire to share the stories of trans women in Pittsburgh. And as a result, I’m watching these really beautiful conversations between multiple generations of trans women occur. It’s become really clear to me that trans women have always kept each other safe, informed, and loved. My hope is that this project can be another link in that history.” — B Kleymeyer\n\nThis project was supported in part by funding from the Carnegie Mellon University Frank-Ratchye Fund For Art @ the Frontier. Join KST and B Kleymeyer for i’m not done with this body (and i never will be) Friday & Saturday, May 5 – 6 at 8:00pm at KST’s Alloy Studios, 5530 Penn Ave. Tickets are Pay What Moves You: $10 – $25.

Last seen at the newMoves dance festival in 2018, Pitts is back in the burgh with his arts collective TRIBE for a presentation of the artist’s evening-length multidisciplinary performance work BLACK HOLE: Trilogy And Triathlon on Friday & Saturday, April 14 – 15 at Kelly Strayhorn Theater, 5941 Penn Ave. KST will host a week of special events leading up to the performance, including a Welcome Dinner and Artist Talk at KST’s Alloy Studios on Tuesday, April 11 at 7:00pm, a GAGA movement session at KST’s Alloy Studios co-presented by KST mutual-aid partner PearlArts Wednesday, April 12 at 9:00am, and a special post-performance conversation with artist Alisha Wormsely at Kelly Strayhorn Theater on Friday, April 14 (performance to start at 8:00pm).\n\nIn BLACK HOLE, a trio of Black performers (all of African heritage) share the stage in a narrative of unity, vigor, and unrelenting advancement. Their journey originates in the darkness of the titular Black Hole, understood not as a cosmic void but a metaphorical place of transformation and potential. Engulfed in an evocative soundscape of original music, sound samples, and spoken word, the dancers embark on an hour-long, uninterrupted journey in movement in which their tenacity and grace are emphasized by cinematic video projections and stark, monochromatic lights.\n\n“BLACK HOLE (…) is a stylish Afrofuturist vision featuring three Black dancers, in monochromatic light and video projections, finding connection in a movement language derived from Ohad Naharin’s Gaga.” — Brian Seibert, New Yorker\n\nBLACK HOLE: Trilogy And Triathlon concludes the Black Trilogy, a series of deeply personal live performance pieces conceived and choreographed by Pitts since 2015. The first work of this collection, a solo BLACK BOX – Little Book of RED, introduced the recurring themes of this cycle: identity, search for the roots and community, and personal evolution of the artist, born “young, gifted and Black.”\n\n2019 saw the New York premiere of BLACK VELVET – Architectures And Archetypes, “a haunting duet” (The New York Times) with Brazilian-born Mirelle Martins. Collaboration with her and other Black Series artists subsequently spurred the inception of TRIBE, a multidisciplinary collective of international creatives, united by Afrofuturistic ideals and shared goals.\n\n“I’ve come from dance companies. I’ve loved them. But I had no interest or passion to re-create that. TRIBE is a collective of outliers. I think we relate more to a rock band, where each person has a different skill, a different instrument. We come together when we want to play and when we have ideas. I’m the artistic director, so I’m in a leadership role, but none of my collaborators are followers. We’re all walking with one another.” — Shamel Pitts, TRIBE artistic director\n\nBLACK HOLE: Trilogy And Triathlon was developed with the kind support of Trust for Mutual Understanding (TMU), American Dance Abroad, gloATL, PearlArts Studios, CrossAward (Italy), Dock 11 / Eden (Germany), Derida Dance Center (Bulgaria), Foundation for Contemporary Arts Emergency Grant, New York Live Arts, and 92nd Street Y Harkness Dance Center.\n\nAdditional commissioning, development and core operating support for TRIBE is provided by the Mellon Foundation; The New England Foundation for the Arts’ National Dance Project with funding from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation; The Howard Gilman Foundation; Dance/NYC’s Dance Advancement Fund, made possible by the Howard Gilman Foundation and Ford Foundation; National Performance Network (NPN) Creation, Development & Artist Engagement Fund Project supported by the Doris Duke\n\nCharitable Foundation, the Mellon Foundation, and the National Endowment for the Arts (a federal agency); and the New York State Council on the Arts with the support of the Office of the Governor and the New York State Legislature.\n\nKST’s engagement of Shamel Pitts BLACK HOLE: Trilogy And Triathlon is made possible through the ArtsCONNECT program of Mid Atlantic Arts with support from the National Endowment for the Arts.

Daniels\n\nPublished: March 7, 2023\n\nNonsensical search for truth and understanding\n\nEAST LIBERTY, PA — Kelly Strayhorn Theater is pleased to announce the first Spring 2023 Freshworks performance in process presentation, Nick M. Daniels, Nonsensical search for truth and understanding. Join us on Friday & Saturday, April 7 – 8, 8:00pm, at KST’s Alloy Studios for a taste of this new work in development followed by a Q & A with the artist.\n\nNonsensical search for truth and understanding is a movement-based performance that explores how technology has grown, developed, and changed global communication. Choreographer Nick M. Daniels will draw the audience into an oddly beautiful and melancholic atmosphere by pairing digital/electronic noise and piano with stylized phrases inspired by global movement styles such as Butoh, Ballroom, Hip Hop, and traditional African and Indian dance. Photography and projections round out the piece, creating a multidisciplinary heartbeat for this work from D.A.N.A. Movement Ensemble.\n\nNick M. Daniels is a movement based performance artist and choreographer born, raised, and based in Pittsburgh who draws from a vast network of influences. Their drive to create art through movement can be traced back to their childhood, when their mother supported their creative spirit, even at her own risk:\n\n“As a child I was always just a little different. I would watch figure-skating, (my mother was an avid figure-skating person, she loved it) and I would try to do those moves, and jumps — our ceiling could have come down quite a few times because you had this little diva doing triple sow-cows above your head in their bedroom. I used to spray pledge on the floors! It made them really, really slick, and one morning, getting ready for church, my mother had her church shoes on, hit the pledge on the floor and fell. After that she said, ‘OK, we need to get you into skating, into dance!’”— Nick M. Daniels\n\nDaniels, a Freshworks alum (‘17) has built a practice that balances the horrendous with the sublime. Informed creatively by their identity as a Black, gay, and non-binary person, Daniels makes work that confronts the world as it is while leaving space to imagine different, more beautiful realities.\n\n“For this residency, there were a couple of images I really needed to see, to get back into my head. This past weekend I traveled to DC to the Museum of African American History, to sit with Emmett Till. A lot of my imagery comes from things that are absolutely horrible, but I try to make it a compassionate effort, because beautiful things come from horrible things. I try to avoid hitting really strong triggers with my audiences, but I do need to push buttons to some extent.” — Nick M. Daniels\n\nBecause their practice synthesizes language from so many different sources, the result can be free-wheeling, abstract, and untethered to the narrative arcs that audiences are used to. Daniels is unconcerned with the legibility of their work. Rather, they hope audiences will connect with the authentic essence of Nonsensical search for truth and understanding.\n\n“My work is what comes out of my mind, it’s what comes out of my heart and what comes out of my soul. My friends and colleagues recognize that. You can call my work unrefined, you can call it non-traditional dance, you can call it performance art, but the one thing you’re definitely going to say is that it is of me — it’s honest, it’s raw, it’s emotional, and it’s a little gay, and very Black. I tell my story the way I feel it should be told. It’s a reflection of finding myself, finding my energy, and finding my Black Boy Joy after being in the pandemic. The uncertainty of that, and the ugly thoughts, things that were being said about queer, transgender Blacks, people of color, all that hatefulness — I want to package that and dance around it. I need to find myself again.” — Nick M. Daniels\n\nJoin KST and Nick M. Daniels for Nonsensical search for truth and understanding Friday & Saturday, April 7 – 8 at 8:00pm at KST’s Alloy Studios, 5530 Penn Ave. Tickets are Pay What Moves You: $10 – $25.

(Dancers Against Normal Actions) Movement Ensemble whose choreographic style is inspired by African dance and many modern and contemporary global movement styles. After attaining his BFA in Dance from Slippery Rock University in 1991, Nick created D.A.N.A Movement Ensemble and was a pioneering force in Pittsburgh for the exploration of race and sexual identity in performance art. Nick’s creative work often uses self-realized soundscapes and video imagery based in pure, raw emotion. Throughout his career he has toured nationally and abroad, receiving grants and accolades including The Young- Howse Theater Award for Movement Artist of the Year, The Pennsylvania Council on the Arts Preserving Diverse Cultures Grant, and a 2017 Freshworks Residency with Kelly Strayhorn Theater. Currently, Nick is developing work that will premiere in Europe, Central America, and South America in 2023.\n\nABOUT KELLY STRAYHORN THEATER\n\nNamed after 20th century entertainment legends Gene Kelly and Billy Strayhorn, both natives of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Kelly Strayhorn Theater (KST) is reflective of the passion that its founders had for the arts.

Santos & Adrian Jones\n\nPublished: February 21, 2023\n\nDocu-Poetics and Creative (Flash) Non-Fiction Writing\n\nEAST LIBERTY, PA — Kelly Strayhorn Theater and The Frank Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry bring together Dorothy R. Santos and Adrian Jones for a collaborative writing workshop at KST’s Alloy Studios on Saturday, March 11 from 3:00pm – 7:00pm. The workshop combines Santos’ expertise as a writer, artist and educator with Jones’ practice of combining art, history, and technology, and explores the process of writing creative non-fiction from the perspective of the documentarian and archivist. Participants will enjoy a hot meal, and are welcome to bring laptops, tablets or other digital devices to use in the workshop (laptops are not necessary for participation).\n\nWhat is creative nonfiction? The literary genre is an umbrella term for many different forms of writing that includes memoir, biography, narrative history, documentary, and personal essay. According to Creative Nonfiction Magazine, a literary journal dedicated to the form, “Writers who write creative nonfiction are very different in voice, orientation and purpose. But what they have in common is that they are, in one way or the other, writing true stories that provide information about a variety of subjects, enriched by relevant thoughtful ideas, personal insight, and intimacies about life and the world we live in. And this scope and variety is exactly what makes creative nonfiction significant and, these days, so incredibly popular.” — Creative Nonfiction Magazine\n\nJones and Santos operate within the writing subcategories of flash creative nonfiction and docu-poetics. Flash creative nonfiction prioritizes brevity, with works often coming in at under 750 words, which focus on a singular image or event. Meanwhile, documentary poems combine primary source material with poetry writing, and can be inspired by news articles, letters, photographs, dairies, court transcripts, medical records, and a variety of other public records. The four-hour event at KST’s Alloy Studios on March 11 will explore a way of writing that honors oral traditions through both poetry and experimental language. Jones and Santos will work through various approaches to recording, documenting, and archiving stories for workshop participants interested in contributing to a community-centered archive. A hot meal will be provided to fuel the discussion!\n\nAdrian Jones’ creative work, scholarship, and writing are based on historical and archival research focused on Black life in East Liberty. As the creator and founder of Looking Glass, a digital archive, his work is at the intersection of documentary media, archives, and digital technologies. Through his use of augmented reality, mapping, and web-based softwares, Jones is committed to community-facing and participatory practices as a way of uplifting and revealing stories of the East Liberty community.\n\n“There is a pattern that has played out in this city over decades where ideas of renewal and revitalization are offered up as a pretext for projects that ultimately displace Black families, businesses and cultural institutions. It was important that Looking Glass begin with a focus on East Liberty’s history because this kind of disruption has yet to end in this neighborhood.\n\nThe enduring risk to homes and sites of memory calls for engaging in the work of recording and gathering stories. I believe there is power, healing and guidance to be found when we connect to the past. I hope Looking Glass as an archive that also maps stories to their points of origin will be a resource that facilitates this connection and reaffirms that the story of East Liberty cannot be rewritten.” — Adrian Jones\n\nDorothy R. Santos’ artistic practice, academic research, and writing focus on voice recognition, speech technologies, and assistive tech. Her fascination with oral history traditions coalesce with her desire to create new media works focused on upending the dominant linguistic forces that oftentimes aim to erase languages and accents outside the lingua franca of American and British englishes. She uses the practice of documentary poetry also known as docu-poetics as a modality for storytelling. Her work aims to shed light on the Filipino immigrant experience and being a child of the diaspora.\n\nTogether, Jones and Santos’ docu-poetics workshop is meant to work specifically with the East Liberty community to contribute to Looking Glass and to gain a broader, deeper, and expansive understanding of writing creative non-fiction. Santos’ collaboration with Jones was made possible through The Frank Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry at Carnegie Mellon University and Kelly Strayhorn Theater with the hope of bridging and building connections between community members interested in sharing stories and new ways of crafting narratives. Dorothy R. Santos is an artist in residence at the STUDIO, and will begin their residency with a lecture on Thursday, March 2 at 5:30pm on the Carnegie Mellon Campus. It’s a great way for folks interested in the workshop to learn more about Dorothy R. Santos’ practice. Then, on March 7th, Santos will visit Duolingo as an invited scholar and deliver a lecture to the Duolingo cohort. They will remain in residence at the STUDIO through March 17th.\n\nThis workshop is made possible in part by Duolingo. Join KST and the artists on Saturday, March 11 at 3:00pm at KST’s Alloy Studios, 5530 Penn Ave. Tickets are Pay What Moves You, $0 – $25.
