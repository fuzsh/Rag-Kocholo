        "text": "Awards for Established Scientists\n\nDistinguished Fellow of the Botanical Society of America\n\nThe \"Distinguished Fellow of the Botanical Society of America\" is the highest honor our Society bestows. Each year, the award committee solicits nominations, evaluates candidates, and selects those to receive an award. Awardees are chosen based on their outstanding contributions to the mission of our scientific Society. The committee identifies recipients who have demonstrated excellence in basic research, education, public policy, or who have provided exceptional service to the professional botanical community, or who may have made contributions to a combination of these categories.\n\nDr. Thomas Givnish, University of Wisconsin-Madison\n\nDr. Steven Manchester, Florida Museum of Natural History\n\nDr. Thomas Givnish is an internationally renowned scientist who is acclaimed for his “sharp intellect, breadth of knowledge, creativity, and productivity.” He is known for his unique interdisciplinary research and for his breadth of expertise, making major contributions to such diverse areas as ecophysiology, systematics, biomechanics, plant-animal interactions, adaptive radiation, and species diversification and extinction. Over the past 51 years, Dr. Givnish has authored, coauthored, or edited more than 160 papers, books, and book chapters, which have been cited more than 21,000 times. And he has sustained substantial funding from the National Science Foundation to support his research for many years.\n\nTom has made foundational contributions in the fields of ecology and systematics: “his work on the evolution of monocots, bromeliads, and carnivorous plants, among other groups, has been equally as transformative as his experimental and theoretical studies on plant functional traits, plant height, leaf form, and photosynthetic physiology.” Tom’s early work in plant ecology was grounded in his keen interest and background in mathematics and economics. He developed mathematical models inspired by economic theory to explore and explain the adaptive nature of leaf form and plant height. He was an early adopter of molecular techniques for studying ecology and evolution, and he blended his work on adaptation with phylogenetic resources, applying the concept of adaptative radiation to plants. His 1997 book Molecular Evolution and Adaptive Radiation, co-edited with Ken Sytsma, remains authoritative. His work in phylogenetic systematics, and his embrace of new methods and approaches, has kept him at the forefront of developments in the field. Tom’s focus on monocots has transformed our understanding of the evolutionary history and higher-level relationships of that group. And he’s showing no signs of slowing down.\n\nTom has immense and infectious enthusiasm for both fieldwork and the lab, and his knowledge of plant diversity, natural history, and ecology is encyclopedic and insightful. He shares his knowledge and passion for plants with his students and colleagues and reaches beyond the University as well through the “Wednesday Night @ the Lab” televised outreach talks, presentations to naturalist and gardening groups, and engagement with local conservation groups. He is also involved in the DNR Citizens Advisory Board for Wisconsin Dells Natural Area and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service National Recovery Team for the Karner Blue butterfly. He is a botanist well-deserving of the BSA Distinguished Fellow Award.\n\nDr. Steven Manchester is one of the world’s leading specialists in fossil plants, whose research has had “a profound impact on the directions in the scientific exploration of angiosperm diversification and biogeographic patterns, particularly through the Cenozoic.” Through extensive field work throughout the world, including in the western US, eastern Asia, India, Europe, and Panama, and through careful study, he has documented some of the earliest known fruits for several families of flowering plants, including the banana (Musaceae), kiwi (Actinidiaceae), grape (Vitaceae), and walnut (Juglandaceae) families. Dr. Manchester often works at the “interface of the living and the dead, working closely with angiosperm systematists to integrate fossils into phylogenetic trees of living species.” He also has worked with molecular systematists to provide fossil calibration points for molecular dating analyses. His broad network of international collaborations has included researchers from all career stages and backgrounds, and he is known to be generous with his time and ideas.\n\nIn addition to his impressive publication record, his many invited presentations and research grants from NSF and other funding sources, Steve has also been deeply engaged in public outreach engaging amateur collectors and students in his field campaigns. He is described by several colleagues to be hard-working, with a passion for field work, which he considers essential to paleobotanical research. He is also described as kind, thoughtful, modest, having a great sense of humor, and intensely dedicated to student training and mentorship.\n\nSteve is a life member of both the Botanical Society of America and the American Society of Plant Taxonomists. He has held leadership roles in the Paleobotanical Section of BSA and the International Organisation of Palaeobotany (IOP), in which he served as President for many years. He is a Foreign Representative Member of The Gondwana Geological Society based in Nagpur, India, and is active in the Association of Wood Anatomists and the American Association of Stratigraphic Palynologists. He has served on his department’s Natural History Advisory Committee and chairs his institution’s IDEA (Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Accessibility) Committee, which recently developed an endowed scholarship fund for graduate students of minoritized groups and an internship program for students from groups that are underrepresented in science in the US. He is a great model for service to the professional community and well deserving of the BSA’s Distinguished Fellow Award.\n\nThe BSA Graduate Student Research Award including the J. S. Karling Award\n\nThe BSA Graduate Student Research Awards support graduate student research and are made on the basis of research proposals and letters of recommendations. Withing the award group is the Karling Graduate Student Research Award. This award was instituted by the Society in 1997 with funds derived through a generous gift from the estate of the eminent mycologist, John Sidney Karling (1897-1994), and supports and promotes graduate student research in the botanical sciences.\n\nThe J.
