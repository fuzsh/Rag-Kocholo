        "text": "Group Name: ICON Study Group\n\nDespite significant developments in pharmacotherapy and interventional strategies, cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of death in the UK. Moreover, there is a growing ageing and co-morbid population in whom the cardiovascular disease burden is very high. My group’s research interests thus far primarily focussed on addressing the unmet needs of improving cardiovascular outcomes under the acronym ICON (Improve Cardiovascular Outcomes in High Risk PatieNts) in this neglected cohort of patients.\n\nChief Investigator: ICON 1 Study (Completed) Funder: Newcastle NIHR BRC (3 Years)\n\nA Study to Improve Cardiovascular Outcomes in High Risk PatieNts with Acute Coronary Syndrome : UKCRN ID 12742.\n\nIschaemic heart disease (IHD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. There has been rapid progress in the management of acute coronary syndromes over the last decade with the use of adjunctive pharmacotherapy, specifically novel antiplatelets and anticoagulants, and advanced percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) techniques. These medical and technical advancements have led to improved survival and gains in life expectancy, especially in younger individuals (<65 years of age) and in men. There is a steep increase in mortality due to ischaemic heart disease among those aged >70 years of age. Despite the increasing burden of ischemic heart disease among the ageing population, there are few studies evaluating novel therapies and interventions among older patients to improve their cardiovascular outcomes in this growing ageing population. My current research focuses to determine the predictors of poor quality of life and adverse outcomes following PCI for acute coronary syndrome in older patients by evaluating frailty scores, biomarker profile, non-invasive cardiovascular parameters (CIMT, vascular stiffness, endothelial function, diastolic function) and invasive imaging (coronary angiography, virtual histology intravascular ultrasound, optical coherence tomography) to develop an integrated risk score to predict outcomes and inform clinical decision making.\n\nChief Investigator: APPLE-COPD: ICON 2 Study (Completed) Funder: Astra Zeneca (2 Years)\n\nAntiplatelet therapy in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in patients with COPD.\n\nPatients with COPD (chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema) are known to be at an increased risk of heart disease and death due to heart attacks. There are several possible reasons for this, one of which is an increased tendency of the blood to clot, that can give rise to blood clot formation in the coronary arteries, and lead to heart attack. Medications such as Aspirin and another new blood thinning tablet called Ticagrelor are already used for patients with heart attacks. Given that patients with COPD are at higher risk of heart attack, we wish to see if these tablets that can prevent blood clot formation in heart arteries might also prevent heart attacks happening in COPD patients. We hope to understand the effects by measuring clotting and inflammation in the blood. All patients will be followed up for 6-months. We also wish to study COPD patients who do not have high risk of developing future heart problems using the QRISK score to study their well being over a 1 year period to see if these patients might also benefit from blood thinning medications.\n\nUK Chief Investigator: The British Heart Foundation SENIOR-RITA Trial (Ongoing) Funder: The British Heart Foundation Clinical Study Grant CS/15/7/31679 (7 Years)\n\nThe British Heart Foundation older patients with non-ST SEgmeNt elevatIOn myocaRdial infarction Randomized Interventional TreAtment Trial\n\nOur population is ageing. Age is a powerful predictor of adverse events following acute myocardial infarction and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI): adjusted odds for in-hospital death increase by 70% for each 10-year increase in age. Older patients are often frail with up to a half of older patients (≥75 years) admitted with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) being severely frail. These frail older patients have a 4-fold increased risk of death at 1-year and yet are often denied coronary revascularisation because of fear of complications and causing harm. The goals of this study are to determine the benefit and risk of coronary revascularisation versus conservative management in high-risk older patients presenting with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and receiving optimal medical therapy. We will explore the predictors and mechanisms of benefit and risk in relation to clinical outcomes, quality of life, and frailty scores.\n\nChief Investigator: ASPIRE Study (Completed) Funder: Research Capability Fund (2 Years)\n\nAspirin Resistance Among Pregnant Women at Risk of Preeclampsia: UKCRN ID 14468.\n\nCardiovascular diseases (CVD) remain the leading cause of death particularly among younger women. Diseases such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes are unique among women that lead to poor outcomes including the occurrence of myocardial infarction and death in the future. Strategies to prevent such pregnancy related diseases are required to improve clinical outcomes among women. The current study is designed to determine the benefit of the use of low dose aspirin (ASA) among women at risk of preeclampsia. Given not all patients respond to aspirin therapy adequately in terms of platelet inhibition, the present study will determine response to aspirin therapy among pregnant women at risk of preeclampsia using specialised platelet function assays (Verify Now, Multiplate, serum thromboxane B2 and urine 11-Dehydrothromboxane B2). Data collected in this pilot study will be used to develop a proposal for a randomised controlled study of the effectiveness of aspirin dosage adjustment according to bedside platelet function testing for the prevention of preeclampsia.\n\nUK National Coordinating Investigator: TWILIGHT Study (Completed)\n\nSponsor: Mount Sinai School of Medicine New York, USA Funder: Astra Zeneca\n\nThe purpose of this study is to compare the use of ticagrelor alone versus ticagrelor and aspirin together. Both ticagrelor and aspirin stop platelets from sticking together and forming a blood clot that could block blood flow to the heart. This study will look to determine the effectiveness and safety of ticagrelor alone, compared to ticagrelor plus aspirin in reducing clinically relevant bleeding and in reducing ischemic adverse events among high-risk patients who have had a percutaneous intervention with at least one drug-eluting stent. A patient is considered high-risk if they meet certain clinical and/or anatomic criteria. Up to 9000 subjects will be enrolled at the time of their index PCI. Subjects meeting randomization eligibility criteria at 3 months post enrollment will be randomized to either ticagrelor plus aspirin or ticagrelor plus placebo for an additional 12 months. Follow-up clinic visits will be performed at 3 months, 9 months and 15 months post enrollment.\n\nUK National Coordinating Investigator: XIENCE SHORT DAPT Trial (Completed)\n\nSponsor: Abbott Vascular Santa Clara, CA, USA Funder: Abbott Vascular\n\nThis is a prospective, single arm, multi-center, open label trial to evaluate the safety of 3-month DAPT in subjects at high bleeding risk (HBR) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with the approved XIENCE family (The XIENCE family stent systems include commercially approved XIENCE drug-eluting stents. Eligibility of P2Y12 receptor inhibitor discontinuation will be assessed at 3-month follow-up. Subjects who are free from myocardial infarction (MI), repeat coronary revascularization, stroke, or stent thrombosis (ARC definite/probable) within 3 months after stenting and have been compliant with 3-month DAPT without interruption of either aspirin and/or P2Y12 receptor inhibitor for > 7 consecutive days are considered as \"3-month clear\", and will discontinue P2Y12 receptor inhibitor and continued with aspirin monotherapy after 3-month follow-up. All registered subjects will be followed at 3, 6 and 12 months post index procedure. The data collected from this study will be compared with the historical control of HBR subjects.\n\nUK National Coordinating Investigator: PACIFIC AMI Trial\n\nSponsor: Bayer, Berlin, Germany Funder: Bayer, Berlin, Germany\n\nThis trial evaluates whether the oral FXIa inhibitor BAY 2433334 compared to placebo leads to a lower incidence of cardiovascular (CV) death, MI, stroke and stent thrombosis in participants with an acute myocardial infarction and who are treated with dual antiplatelet therapy.\n\nUK National Coordinating Investigator: AEGIS 2 Trial\n\nSponsor: CSL Behring, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre Boston MA\n\nThis is a phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CSL112 on reducing the risk of major adverse CV events (MACE) in subjects with ACS (diagnosed with STEMI or NSTEMI), who are receiving evidence-based medical therapy.\n\nLocal Principal Investigator:\n\nMVO/REFLOW MI Trial
