Recipient of the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize, Muhammad Yunus is internationally recognized as the founder of microcredit and as the father of social business. For more than 30 years, he has successfully worked to meld capitalism and social responsibility. In 1976, he created the first institution to provide micro-loans to empower the poor to become entrepreneurs. Grameen Bank has since lent more than USD 6.5 billion to those suffering from extreme poverty while maintaining a consistent repayment rate above 98 per cent. Complementing his work with microcredit, Muhammad Yunus pioneered the global social business movement.

Today he continues to advocate for businesses that are created to solve human and the triple planetary crisis of climate change, pollution, and biodiversity loss. His early career as a professor of economics – followed by years of work with dignitaries and icons influencing global culture and economy – allow him unprecedented insight into the forces and industries that can affect powerful change through social business.

With Yunus Environment Hub, he promotes zero-net carbon business activities through social business. Aside from the Nobel Peace Prize, Muhammad Yunus is the recipient of several prestigious recognitions, including the Congressional Medal of Honor (United States) and the Presidential Medal of Freedom (United States). Only six individuals in history have received all three distinctions.
