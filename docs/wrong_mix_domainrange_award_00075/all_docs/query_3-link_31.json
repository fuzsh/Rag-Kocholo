        "text": "JUDY WOODRUFF:\n\nToday's action by the Federal Reserve, as we said earlier, is aimed at making it easier for businesses to borrow and then spend money.\n\nOur next story is about another effort to help business owners, in this case, low-income American entrepreneurs who are just getting started.\n\nSpecial correspondent Fred de Sam Lazaro reports on bringing an approach that's worked well in developing countries to the U.S.\n\nA version of this story aired on the PBS program \"Religion & Ethics Newsweekly.\"\n\nFRED DE SAM LAZARO:\n\nThe billboards and signs in the Jackson Heights section of Queens, N.Y., reflect dozens of languages, cultures, and nationalities. It's an immigrant community of rich diversity, but also plenty of poverty. And there's a store for that, too: an American version of Bangladesh's famous Grameen Bank.\n\nNo fancy lobby here — there aren't even enough chairs. But from this and five other cramped quarters in Queens and as far away as Oakland, Calif., Grameen America disburses dozens of micro business loans each day — most for around $1,500, all of them to women, who studies show are more likely to repay loans and to spend money on their children's welfare.\n\nIt is the brainchild of Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, whose Grameen Bank has helped millions of women entrepreneurs in his native Bangladesh. He wanted to test the concept in a developed country.\n\nWith foundation grants and borrowing commercially under a federal community reinvestment law, Grameen America began in 2008, to wary customer reception, says CEO Stephen Vogel.\n\nSTEPHEN VOGEL, Grameen America:\n\nThey were afraid that what we were offering — a low-cost loan, no collateral, no credit scores, no history necessarily of being in business, and we would give them a loan — they were afraid that there would be something that was going to come back in the end.\n\nIt would be, we'll raise the interest rates, we would do something. But we didn't.\n\nFRED DE SAM LAZARO:\n\nBut word spread quickly, he says. Already, many borrowers, like Maria del Socorro, have paid off first and second Grameen loans.\n\nDel Socorro, a Colombia native who had only had housekeeping jobs before, opened her decorations business. She's fulfilling a lifelong goal to turn her crafting skills into a business. Business is good and growing, she says.\n\nMARIA DEL SOCORRO, small business owner (through translator): It's good. I do all kinds of events, like birthdays, first communions, weddings. All the foam work you see is done by hand. I do all of this by hand.\n\nFRED DE SAM LAZARO:\n\nAnd he says it takes much more than financing to help them break out of it: business counseling, keeping the books, paying bills, even opening savings accounts, which is required of borrowers.\n\nEven that is often not enough. Joe Selvaggio, a former Catholic priest who's worked for decades with poor people, says many would-be entrepreneurs fail because their finances are precarious.\n\nFRED DE SAM LAZARO:\n\nSelvaggio runs MicroGrants, a Minnesota nonprofit that works alongside those who provide microloans. But he says new entrepreneurs often need something more to get them over the hump.\n\nSo he gives them grants of $1,000. Several MicroGrants clients are in Midtown Global Market, located in a long-shuttered Sears Roebuck store in a recovering Minneapolis neighborhood.\n\nSHANTAE HOLMES, borrower:\n\nI wanted a business that served a need, not a want. I didn't want to compete with the cell phone places. I didn't want to compete with the red hair and fake hair and all of that stuff. There is enough of that. I didn't want the bargain clothing or gym shoes.\n\nJAMARA CHEEK, Metropolitan Economic Development Association:\n\nShe had no experience with government contracting. People are overwhelmed and daunted by government rules and regulations.\n\nAnd we literally held her hand and coached her through that process. It took four months after submitting an offer of her services to the government for her to hear back from them.\n\nSHANTAE HOLMES:\n\nIt takes money to make money, so, therefore, it was like, oh, I need some help to be able to get my bills at a zero balance. And Joe came in and made it easy for me.\n\nFRED DE SAM LAZARO:\n\nFor Joe Selvaggio, Holmes is a star client — a 41-year-old mother of three who was able to turn around an earlier life of chemical dependency and cancer.\n\nSo far, Selvaggio has disbursed more than $2 million in $1,000 grants. He gets funds from foundations and many wealthy Minnesotans he got to know from his days as a priest."
