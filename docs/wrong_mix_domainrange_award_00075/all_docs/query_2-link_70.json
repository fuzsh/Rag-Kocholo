        "text": "GEOFF BENNETT: Nearly half-a-century after its birth from a bloody Civil War, Bangladesh has made significant strides in reducing poverty.\n\nOne of the best known architects of this progress is Muhammad Yunus, who popularized the concept of microfinance.\n\nBut Yunus has run afoul of his country's prime minister and has faced a series of legal challenges and now criminal charges.\n\nFred de Sam Lazaro has our report, part of his series Agents for Change.\n\nFRED DE SAM LAZARO: He's won the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Medal of Honor.\n\nSEN. RICHARD DURBIN (D-IL): Make no mistake, Muhammad Yunus is a genius.\n\nFRED DE SAM LAZARO: Nearly a half-century ago, this Vanderbilt-trained economist left a teaching career in Tennessee, saying he was called to serve his newly independent war-shattered nation.\n\nMUHAMMAD YUNUS, Founder, Grameen Bank: People were dying of hunger.\n\nAnd I find myself in a very strange situation teaching elegant theories of economics.\n\nThose elegant theories have no use for people who are dying.\n\nFRED DE SAM LAZARO: He did test one economic theory, offering a few women loans to start small enterprises like a poultry farm.\n\nIt worked, he told me in this 2001 interview.\n\nMUHAMMAD YUNUS: People are paying back, and they paid back every penny without any hitch, so I got very excited.\n\nSo I thought I should have my own bank.\n\nFRED DE SAM LAZARO: The Grameen Bank grew quickly, 97 percent owned by millions of its female borrowers, success that earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006.\n\nToday, Grameen has a large footprint in Bangladeshi society, far beyond microlending with affiliated companies that sell cell phone service and food products.\n\nThere's even a nursing school.\n\nIts global reach includes Grameen America, which last year loaned $1 billion to low-income Americans.\n\nAll profits are plowed back into expanding the mission.\n\nYunus has won friends in the highest places across the globe, except at home.\n\nIn January, Yunus, who is 83, and three senior Grameen colleagues were sentenced to six months in prison for violating labor laws, charges he calls politically motivated.\n\nHe was released on bail, but this case is only the beginning of his legal troubles.\n\nHe faces more than 100 other charges of labor law violations and graft.\n\nWhat's life like as you go into work these days?\n\nMUHAMMAD YUNUS: Well, not very comfortable.\n\nFRED DE SAM LAZARO: I reached Yunus in his Dhaka office, where, days earlier, a group of about 35 men appeared unannounced to take over and began padlocking the place at the end of each day.\n\nMUHAMMAD YUNUS: They said: \"We are the new management of this coming bank that is under government control these days.\"\n\nWe went to the police.\n\nPolice would not help us.\n\nFRED DE SAM LAZARO: This latest disruption is a dramatic escalation of actions targeting Yunus that began in 2011, when he was removed as chair of the Grameen Bank.\n\nMUHAMMAD YUNUS: Because government rule doesn't permit anybody to remain in government job after 60.\n\nI said, this is not a government bank.\n\nThis is a bank owned by the poor women.\n\nAnyway, I was forced out.\n\nFRED DE SAM LAZARO: Can you help explain what is at the root of this antagonism?\n\nMUHAMMAD YUNUS: It beats me.\n\nFRED DE SAM LAZARO: What's not in doubt is that his chief antagonist is the country's prime minister.\n\nMUHAMMAD YUNUS: She calls me as a bloodsucker of the poor people.\n\nFRED DE SAM LAZARO: Sheikh Hasina recently won a fourth term in elections, widely discredited and boycotted by opposition parties.\n\nMost of their leaders are in prison.\n\nShe's publicly denounced Yunus as a corrupt opportunist in a spat that experts trace back to 2007 and a time of political upheaval, when Yunus toyed with forming his own party.\n\nIt was at the urging of the country's military leaders, he says, and short-lived.\n\nMUHAMMAD YUNUS: About 10 weeks, that's about it.\n\nAnd after the end of these 10 weeks, I declared that, no, I'm not going to create any party because I cannot handle politics.\n\nThat's my -- not my cup of tea.\n\nFRED DE SAM LAZARO: But experts say Prime Minister Hasina might still perceive Yunus, a revered civic figure, as a political threat.\n\nDespite pleas for more than 200 global luminaries, from former President Obama to U2's Bono, to end the -- quote -- \"legal harassment,\" the campaign against Yunus has only intensified.\n\nALI RIAZ, Illinois State University: This case is an example of a weaponization of judiciary.\n\nFRED DE SAM LAZARO: Political scientist Ali Riaz at Illinois State University says Sheikh Hasina has tightened her grip on power.\n\nGeopolitical realities allow her to resist Western pressure, he says, and the Yunus case sends a chilling message domestically.\n\nALI RIAZ: The prime minister has received unqualified support from two powers, that is Russia and China, not to mention India.\n\nIndia has been the principal backer of this government since 2009.\n\nAnd this is the message to the Bangladeshis that if Professor Yunus can be persecuted and punitive measures can be taken, you are nobody.\n\nWe can take -- do anything.\n\nFRED DE SAM LAZARO: So, what might Professor Yunus be facing in the weeks and months ahead?\n\nALI RIAZ: I'm afraid he might actually end up in jail.\n\nI'm sorry to say it.\n\nIt breaks my heart to say, but it could happen.\n\nFRED DE SAM LAZARO: Government officials insist the judicial process is independent of political interference.\n\nWe contacted the Bangladesh embassy in Washington for comment, but did not receive a response.\n\nMUHAMMAD YUNUS: I, as the chairman of these companies, never received any salary, any kind of fee for my attending meetings, nothing.\n\nFRED DE SAM LAZARO: For his part, Yunus continues to assert his innocence.\n\nHe says he's received several offers of asylum abroad, but has ruled out exile.\n\nMUHAMMAD YUNUS: This is where I work with my -- with people who have worked together for years and years.\n\nWe don't -- I don't want to abandon them and go someplace else.\n\nI cannot do that.\n\nFRED DE SAM LAZARO: He has a bail hearing on March 3, also the date when an anti-corruption commission is scheduled to release what many colleagues fear will be incriminating results from a yearslong investigation of Yunus' activities.\n\nFor the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I'm Fred de Sam Lazaro.\n\nAnd Fred's reporting is a partnership with the Under-Told Stories Project at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota."
