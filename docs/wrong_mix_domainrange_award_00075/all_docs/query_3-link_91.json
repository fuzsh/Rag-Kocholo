        "text": "Key Highlights:\n\nThe earliest example of microfinance is attributed to the Irish Loan Fund system introduced by Jonathan Swift\n\nRabindranath Tagore, founded the Kaligram Krishi Bank in Patishar village, Naogaon district, in present-day Bangladesh in 1905\n\nOne of Bangladesh’s earliest initiatives of its kind, BRAC’s extensive microfinance operations began in 1974\n\nCritiques often say, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but in Dr. Muhammad Yunus’s case, it seems more like a fast track to fame and fortune. Yunus, the maestro of microcredit in Bangladesh, not only borrowed a few bucks but also managed to borrow all the glory. Back in the day, when microcredit was just a bright idea sparking in Bangladesh, Yunus garnered charming international accolades faster than you can say ‘interest-free loan’.\n\nThe so-called ‘banker to the poor’ has amassed a veritable treasure trove of accolades, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 all while conveniently forgetting to credit the true pioneers of microcredit in Bangladesh. Yunus rose to prominence in 1984 when he received the Ramon Magsaysay Award.\n\nYou can also read: Grameen Bank Pulls Back Curtain on Yunus’s Alleged Crony Capitalism\n\nHowever, beneath this glowing reputation lies a contentious truth: Bangladesh’s microcredit roots run deeper than Yunus’s Grameen Bank. Yunus failed to acknowledge the groundbreaking work of his predecessors and contemporaries. By positioning himself as the sole architect of this revolutionary financial model, Yunus effectively erased the collective efforts of numerous unsung heroes who toiled in Bangladesh’s rural communities long before Grameen Bank came into existence.\n\nThe Real Origin of Microcredit\n\nMicrofinance is not a new concept. Small-scale lending operations have existed since the 18th century. The earliest example is attributed to the Irish Loan Fund system introduced by Jonathan Swift, aiming to improve conditions for impoverished Irish citizens. Modern microfinancing, as we know it today, gained widespread popularity in the 1970s.\n\nShorebank, established in 1974 in Chicago, holds the distinction of being the first microfinance and community development bank. Timothy Guinnane, an economic historian at Yale, has been researching Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen’s village bank movement in Germany, which began in 1864 and grew to serve 2 million rural farmers by 1901.\n\nTimothy Guinnane argued that even then, microcredit had demonstrated its ability to meet two crucial tests: ensuring moral repayment among borrowers and delivering financial services to the poor. Another organization, the Caisse Populaire movement founded by Alphonse and Dorimène Desjardins in Quebec, shared similar concerns regarding poverty.\n\nDr. Yunus and the Grameen Bank gained accolades for pioneering collateral-free credit, though it’s noteworthy that this concept wasn’t solely his brainchild, as he omitted in his Nobel Prize speech.\n\nTagore’s Agricultural Bank That Time Forgot\n\nFor millions, Rabindranath Tagore remains an unforgettable literary figure, especially revered by the Bengali populace, where he continues to set the benchmark for all aspects of life. Tagore, renowned for composing the national anthems of both India and Bangladesh, founded the Kaligram Krishi Bank in Patishar village, Naogaon district, in present-day Bangladesh in 1905.\n\nThis banking model, envisioned by Tagore, thrived for 25 years, immensely popular among farmers in his estate. Tagore invested significantly and borrowed large sums to support this endeavor. Notably, he donated his entire Nobel Prize amount (178,000 Taka at the time) to this cause.\n\nDespite his role as a romantic poet and author, Tagore refrained from charging interest to his clients, predominantly Muslim farmers who constituted 70% of the bank’s beneficiaries, aiming to alleviate their poverty.\n\nTagore’s bank distinguished itself with its collateral-free lending across approximately 600 villages, a stark contrast to the higher interest rates prevalent at the Grameen Bank. Each village had 3 designated members, including a principal, responsible for distributing funds—a demonstration of Tagore’s innovative approach and enduring legacy in socio-economic reform.\n\nDr. Akhtar Hameed Khan: The Visionary Yunus Forgot to Mention\n\nAfter the War of Independence, the Bangladesh Academy for Rural Development (BARD), established in 1959 as the Pakistan Academy for Rural Development, pioneered microcredit under Dr. Akhtar Hameed Khan’s leadership with the innovative ‘Cumilla Model’.\n\nThis initiative aimed to empower individuals and engage grassroots communities in agricultural and rural development. Dr. Khan’s approach included groundbreaking methods for poverty alleviation, notably microcredit, focusing on providing small loans to the poor. The village small cooperative loan system set up in Comilla was a clear precursor to the Grameen Bank, now widely recognized for its microcredit work.\n\nHowever, Yunus, who later gained international acclaim through Grameen Bank, failed to acknowledge Dr. Khan’s seminal contributions to the field.\n\nDr. Khan’s early career began in Government service. Joining the Indian Civil Service (I.C.S.) in 1936, a prestigious role under colonial rule, he could have amassed wealth and status but opted for a life dedicated to public service.\n\nDespite Dr. Khan’s significant role in developing microcredit concepts, Yunus has often been credited as the sole innovator in this field, overlooking the foundational work laid by BARD. This oversight has led to a skewed narrative in the history of microcredit, diminishing the recognition due to Dr. Khan’s pioneering efforts.\n\nBy the late 1960s, the Comilla Model had facilitated micro-loans to over 10,000 rural households, significantly improving agricultural productivity and income levels. Since its inception, BARD has organized 3,114 training courses, workshops, seminars, and orientation programs, benefiting 298,000 participants from both domestic and international backgrounds.\n\nYunus’ Selective History: The Gaps in ‘Banker to the Poor’\n\nThe Comilla Model established a pioneering framework for future initiatives. Fazle Hasan Abed, through the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC), pioneered cooperative methods to provide credit to impoverished communities. Following independence, BRAC launched a microcredit program in the Haor areas of Sunamganj and Sylhet.\n\nOne of Bangladesh’s earliest initiatives of its kind, BRAC’s extensive microfinance operations began in 1974 and now span all 64 districts. In contrast, Grameen Bank initially embraced a minimalist approach, focusing primarily on microcredit as a key tool in poverty alleviation.\n\nOver time, Grameen Bank expanded its program to include training and education, although its scope remains narrower compared to BRAC’s comprehensive approach. Established as an independent bank by Bangladeshi government ordinance on October 2, 1983, Grameen Bank inaugurated its Training Program officially in 1987 under the guidance of the Managing Director.\n\nNow the question arises: how can Yunus be considered the sole pioneer of microcredit when evidence shows that numerous figures initiated microcredit programs long before him? Taking all the facts into account, Fazle Hasan Abed should be credited as the true pioneer of microcredit in Bangladesh. However, even before him, Akhtar Hameed Khan initiated the concept in the country.\n\nA study by David Roodman (2012) found that Grameen Bank received significantly more media mentions compared to BRAC, despite BRAC’s larger size and broader impact.\n\nIn Yunus’s book ‘Banker to the Poor’, he describes the development and success of Grameen Bank but does not extensively discuss other microfinance institutions in Bangladesh or their contributions.\n\nAs the dust settles on Yunus’s gilded legacy, one can’t help but wonder if the Nobel laureate’s acclaim is built on a foundation of selective amnesia rather than genuine innovation. The self-proclaimed ‘banker to the poor’ seems to have made quite the deposit in the bank of public opinion, while conveniently withdrawing credit from those who truly pioneered microcredit in Bangladesh.\n\nFrom Tagore’s visionary agricultural bank to Dr. Akhtar Hameed Khan’s groundbreaking Comilla Model, the real architects of this financial revolution have been relegated to footnotes in Yunus’s grand narrative. Perhaps it’s time to balance the books and recognize that Yunus’s greatest skill may not be in banking, but in marketing himself as the sole savior of the poor, while the true heroes of microcredit remain buried beneath the weight of his oversized reputation."
