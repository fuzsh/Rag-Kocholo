        "text": "Nobel prizes awarded in Sweden\n\nAbout 2,000 guests, including Sweden's royal family, were invited to the award ceremony at Stockholm's concert hall, followed by a lavish banquet a few blocks away at City Hall.\n\nNobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus poses for a picture with the Nobel medal and diploma at Oslo Town Hall. Yunus, founder of Grameen Bank, unveiled a bold vision for ending global poverty as he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. (Xinhua Photo)\n\nBangladeshi Muhammad Yunus and the Grameen Bank that he founded received the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize earlier Sunday at a ceremony in Norwegian capital Oslo for creating microcredit system that has helped millions of poor people in his homeland.\n\nThe Nobel Prizes are usually announced in October and are handed out every year on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the 1896 death of Alfred Nobel, a Swedish industrialist and the inventor of dynamite.\n\nThis year's prize carries a cash award of 10 million Swedish kronor (about 1.4 million U.S. dollars), a gold medal and a diploma.\n\nThe Nobels, widely regarded as the world's most prestigious accolades in science and literature, have been awarded since 1901."
