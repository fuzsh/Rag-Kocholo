        "text": "The capitalist system, in its current form, is broken. Here, a Nobel Peace Prize-winner outlines his radical economic vision for fixing it.\n\nEight individuals now own more wealth than 50 per cent of the global population, and high unemployment in many countries means that people’s skills, knowledge, and creativity are being wasted. Rampant environmental destruction only adds to this picture of a bleak future in which humankind will no longer be able to sustain itself.\n\nBut what if there is another way?\n\nMuhammad Yunus is the economist who invented microcredit, founded Grameen Bank, and earned a Nobel Peace Prize for his work towards alleviating poverty. Here, he sets forth his vision to establish a new kind of capitalism, where altruism and generosity are valued as much as profit making, and where individuals not only have the capacity to lift themselves out of poverty, but also to affect real change for the planet and its people."
