        "text": "Microloan pioneer Muhammad Yunus: everyone has a right to economic mobility\n\nWhen he first loaned $27 to a small group of poor Bangladeshi women in 1974, Muhammad Yunus didn’t have an inkling that he was building a worldwide model for lifting struggling people out of poverty.\n\nBut as those kinds of loans increased, Yunus proved the viability of microlending to the poor in developing countries, and Grameen Bank, which he founded in Bangladesh, has gone on to loan some $6 billion to more than seven million people in his country. Most of those loans have been for less than $200, helping small-scale entrepreneurs — 97 percent of them female — build better lives for themselves and their families.\n\nYunus, who shared the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize with the Grameen Bank, spoke about his model of economic development on Saturday, October 13."
