        "text": "GRACE ANAK BINCHIN\n\n​\n\nEthnic community: Bisaya\n\nFirst, second and third languages: English, Selako, Malay\n\n​\n\nHi everyone! My name is Grace, and I’m a Bisaya from Limbang, Sarawak, but I live in Sematan, a small district in parts of Kuching, Sarawak. I’m a student of linguistics, and as well as English. I’m University of Malaya student, and here I am, I would like to talk about where and how I speak languages with different people around Malaysia.\n\n​\n\nSo basically, I would say my first language is English; and my second language is Selako because I grew up in a Selako community based on my mom’s upbringing. And I wouldn’t say I know Bisaya that well, because I don’t speak a lot of Bisaya with my dad. Then, I would say my third language is Bahasa Melayu, the Malay language, because that is basically the national language of Malaysia, which I use to communicate with my Malay friends as well as some of the lecturers. But if needed be, I will speak in English.\n\n​\n\n[...] We need to speak some certain languages with different people in Malaysia that require us to communicate with them. For example, if we want to speak with them—like we want to order something —we would use certain languages. If I were to eat at a mamak stall, for example, I would speak in English or Malay. Interestingly, if I were to order some Chinese food at a Chinese restaurant, I would speak in English as well as Malay, but they would see me as a Chinese person, and they would automatically speak in Chinese with me—so I have to reinvent some kind of focus on them for them to speak in a different language for me to understand.\n\nTHARENEE GUNASEKARAN\n\n​\n\nEthnic community: Tamil\n\nFirst and second languages: Tamil, English, Malay\n\n​\n\n> Watch the excerpted interview in the documentary to hear Tharenee speak Tamil!\n\n​\n\nவணக்கம்! என் பெயர் Tharenee. நான் இரண்டாம் வருடம் University of Malaya இல் டிகிரி படிக்கிறேன்.\n\n[Hello everyone! My name is Tharenee. I am in my second year studying in the University of Malaya.]\n\n​\n\nI can speak three languages, but basically it can be considered as four languages. I can speak Malay, which is our national language; and Tamil, which is my mother tongue; English, which is considered my first and second language— some sort of first and second language; and fourthly, I can speak a little bit of Malayalam. I think I learnt Malayalam from my friends, because my friend’s mother tongue is Malayalam. I learnt English and Tamil concurrently during my childhood and I learnt Malay as well as Tamil through formal education. And also English!\n\nFAYNE TAN SHI-YUN\n\n​\n\nEthnic community: Chinese\n\nFirst and second languages: Mandarin, Malay, English\n\n​\n\n> Watch the excerpted interview in the documentary to hear Fayne speak Cantonese, Mandarin and Malay!\n\n(The second half of the interview is translated into English)\n\n​\n\nHey guys! My name is Fayne. 我個中文名係陳詩韻 [My Chinese name is Tan Shi-Yun]. I am from The University of Hong Kong studying linguistics, and I am Malaysian.\n\n​\n\nI speak fluent Mandarin, Malay and English, and moderate fluency in Cantonese, and I understand Hokkien and a little bit of Japanese. Normally I speak in English and Mandarin with my friends, and I speak 100% Mandarin in my home. I speak mostly Mandarin at home because I’ve received my education in Mandarin all through my life. When I go out to buy food or to shop, I usually speak the Malay language with the Malay people here in Malaysia.\n\nNIGEL KRISTIAN CHONG​\n\n​\n\nEthnic community: Sino-Kadazan (Chinese and Kadazan)\n\nFirst and second languages: English, Malay\n\n​\n\n> Watch the excerpted interview in the documentary to hear Nigel speak Sabah Malay!\n\n(The second half of the interview is translated into English)\n\n​\n\nHi, nama saya Nigel Kristian Chong. Saya belajar di Universiti Malaya.\n\n[Hi, my name is is Nigel Kristian Chong. I am studying at the University of Malaya]\n\n​\n\nI can speak Malay, English, and a little bit of Chinese—which is the Mandarin Chinese. English is like my first language which I speak at home, and I also speak English with my parents. As for my siblings, we communicate in English as well. For Malay, my father also speaks Malay with me and my siblings a lot. For example, sometimes he speaks Malay with us, but even then we would still reply to him in English. As for Mandarin, I studied Mandarin from primary level 1 to 4. I have stopped after that, so I don’t really speak Mandarin all that well. But when I began studying in the University of Malaya, I started to have more Chinese friends, so this in turn helped improve my Mandarin speaking skills a bit.\n\nJAMIE WONG​\n\n​\n\nEthnic community: Chinese\n\nFirst and second languages: Mandarin, Malay, English\n\n​\n\n> Watch the excerpted interview in the documentary to hear Jaime speak Cantonese!\n\n(The second half of the interview is translated into English)\n\n​\n\nHi! 我個名叫做Jamie，我係馬來西亞人，我係University of Malaya讀緊書。我識講華語，Malay，English，廣東話，同埋福建話。\n\n[Hi! My name is Jamie—I’m Malaysian, and I’m currently studying in the University of Malaya. I can speak Mandarin, Malay, English, Cantonese and Hokkien.]\n\n​\n\n[In] What kind of situations [do] I use all these languages… would be—for Malay—usually in the school area, because there are a lot of Malay people, so we need Malay to converse with them. For English—mostly with my friends, in class, and with lecturers; for Chinese—I would use that with my Chinese friends on a daily basis; Cantonese—not much, but when it’s necessary, where certain people speak Cantonese, I would use it with them as well. As for Hokkien—I use it mostly with my relatives, because most of my relatives are from the Terengganu state and the Penang state, and they use Hokkien a lot, so I would use Hokkien to converse with them."
