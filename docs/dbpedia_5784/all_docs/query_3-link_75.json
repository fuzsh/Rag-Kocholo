        "text": "Languages of singapore\n\nAs most people know, there are four main groups of Singaporeans: ethnic Chinese, ethnic Malay, Indian, and expat/other foreign residents. English is an official language, but so are Malay, Chinese - Mandarin, and Tamil, representing Singapore's main ethnic groups. Many signs on trains, in public places, etc. are written in all four languages.\n\nNearly all education is in English, but policy is to allow teaching of a second language in schools, which is one of the other ethnic languages. With Chinese, the promotion of Mandarin as the official language in Chinese schools has caused the number of Chinese speakers proficient other languages/dialects to decrease, as young people are not exposed to them outside the home. The most common Chinese languages besides Mandarin found in Singapore are 'Min Nan': Hokkien, Teochew, Hakka, and Cantonese. Hokkien (from Fujian Province and Taiwan) is especially common, with several hundred thousand native speakers. A relatively small percent of Indians speak a mother tongue other than Tamil. the most common being Hindi and Panjabi (about 10,000 each).\n\nBecause it has the region's best economy and schools, people from other Southeast Asian countries come to Singapore to work and study. So, it is easy to find people who speak Tagalog, Cebuano, Thai, and Javanese. Singapore is truly an international city.\n\nlanguages of brunei\n\nStandard Malaysian is the official language of Brunei. Most everyone speaks a form of Malaysian, called Melayu Brunei, which is about 85% the same as standard Malaysian, and nearly identical to Kedayan. As in Malaysia, a majority of the population also speaks English. Unlike Sabah and Sarawak, there are fewer native languages. The main ones are Belait, Bisaya Brunei, Dusun, Murut (Lun Bawang), and Tutong.\n\nLanguages of malaysia\n\nMalaysia is made up of West or Peninsular Malaysia, which is the peninsula south of Thailand, and East Malaysia, which is comprised of Sabah, Sarawak, and the island of Labuan. Across all of Malaysia, Standard Malay (Bahasa Malaysia) is taught in schools and spoken by everyone. English is also used extensively, especially among younger people, and most Malaysians can communicate in English. In Sabah and Sarawak, English is often used as the primary language of communication.\n\nLike Singapore, various southern Chinese languages and Tamil are widely spoken by these ethnic groups in West Malaysia. Less common languages of West Malaysia include Semai, Jakun and Temuan.\n\nIn Sarawak and Sabah, a large number of native languages are still spoken, but with the popularity of English and teaching of Malaysian in schools, many are dying out and most are less widely spoken than in the past.\n\nIn Sarawak, Iban (Sea Dayak) is the main one with a half million speakers plus. Others include Berawan, Bau-Jagoi, Biatah/Bikuap, Bukar-Sadung, Bisaya Brunei (spoken in Brunei also), and Bakung-Kenyah,\n\nIn Sabah, languages include West Coast.Bajaw, Banjar (around Tawau), Bisaya Sabah, Dusun-Kadasan, Idaan, Kimaragang, Tambunan, Murut, Rungus , Iranun, Suluk, Sungai, Ubian, and Bugis (from Sulawesi, Indonesia). There are also several hundred thousand ethnic Javanese living and working in Sabah."
