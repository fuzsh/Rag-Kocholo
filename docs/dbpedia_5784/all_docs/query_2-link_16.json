        "text": "Iban (Jaku Iban)\n\nIban is a Malayo-Polynesian language spoken by about 1.4 million people on the island of Borneo, mainly in Sarawak in Malayasia, and in neighbouring parts of Indonesia and Brunei. Iban speakers belong to the Dayak ethnic group and used to be known as \"Sea Dayak\". The Iban language is also known as Iban Sabah or Sea Dayak, and is closely related to Malay, particularly the Malay of Sarawak.\n\nIn Malaysia Iban is spoken by about 1.4 million people mainly in the state of Sarawak, and also in the Tawau district in the state of Sabah. It is taught in primary schools and used in literature and the media. In Brunei there are about 15,800 speakers of Iban in the districts of Belait, Tutong and Temburong. There are also about 15,000 Iban speakers in Indonesian, particularly in the Kapuas Hulu regency of West Kalimantan province.\n\nWritten Iban\n\nIban is usually written with the Latin alphabet, however there is an alternative script, known as the Dunging Script (urup Dunging) or the Iban alphabet, which was invented between 1947 and 1962 by Dunging Anak Gunggu. It is rarely used.\n\nIban pronunciation\n\nSample text in Iban (Lord's Prayer)\n\nApai kami di serega\n\nKudus mih nama nuan\n\nDatai mih perintah nuan\n\nJadi peneka nuan\n\nBaka ka dalam serega\n\nBakanya dalam bumi.\n\nMeri ka kami\n\nPengidup tiap ari.\n\nAmpunka penyalah kami\n\nBaka ka kami ti\n\nNgampunka urang\n\nTi salah ngelaban kami\n\nIntu kami ari penguji\n\nLepas ke kami ari penyai\n\nLaban nuan ti bempu perintah\n\nEnggau kuasa enggau mulia\n\nDataika belama-lama iya\n\nAmin\n\nHear a recording of this:\n\nTranslation\n\nOur father in heaven, hallowed be your name. Thy kingdom come, on earth as in heaven. Gives us our daily bread. Forgive us of our sin, as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temtation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power and the glory are yours. Now and forever. Amen.\n\nSample videos in Iban\n\nInformation about Iban | Dunging Iban script | Phrases | Numbers | Tower of Babel\n\nLinks\n\nInformation about the Iban language\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iban_language\n\nhttp://www.ethnologue.com/language/iba\n\nhttp://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_iba\n\nIban-Malay dictionaries\n\nhttp://id.glosbe.com/ms/iba/\n\nhttps://borneodictionary.com/iban/\n\nIban phrases\n\nhttp://wikitravel.org/en/Iban_phrasebook\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iban_language\n\nMalayo-Polynesian languages\n\nAlorese, Ambai, Ambel, Anuki, Balinese, Bambam, Banjarese, Batuley, Bengkulu, Biak, Bima, Bugis, Bushi, Chamorro, Duri, Fijian, Fordata, Gayo, Iban, Indonesian, Javanese, Kei, Kerinci, Komering, Lamaholot, Lampung, Ledo Kaili, Madurese, Makasarese, Malagasy, Malay, Mamasa, Mandar, Mandar, Mbula, Mentawai, Minangkabau, Mualang, Musi, Ngaju, Nias, Ogan, Palauan, Sasak, Selaru, Sumbawa, Sundanese, Toqabaqita, Toraja-Sa'dan, Ulumandaʼ, Urak Lawoi’, Wamesa, Yamdena\n\nLanguages written with the Latin alphabet\n\nPage last modified: 13.08.24\n\n[top]\n\nWhy not share this page:\n\nIf you like this site and find it useful, you can support it by making a donation via PayPal or Patreon, or by contributing in other ways.
