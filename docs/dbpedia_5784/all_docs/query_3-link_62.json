        "text": "This article looks at the ethnolinguistic vitality of some of the most important language varieties spoken in Malaysia, focusing on two languages as case studies: Bidayuh and Mah Meri, respectively the language of one of the indigenous groups in East Malaysia and the language of one of the indigenous groups of peninsular Malaysia. After a general introduction to the sociolinguistic situation in Malaysia and to the scales used to measure ethnolinguistic vitality with a focus on EGIDS, the one used in this article, there follows an analysis of the factors accounting for the high vitality of the languages chosen as case studies. The article closes with a discussion of how these factors could be used to help maintain other minority languages.\n\nThe study examines the sustainability status of Sarawak indigenous languages through a survey on adolescents’ language use using the Expanded Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale (EGIDS). The specific aspects examined were: the presence of ethnic languages in relation to other languages in selected domains of language use; the adolescents’ use of the ethnic language across generations in the family domain; language use patterns of different indigenous groups; and demographic variables which influence use of the ethnic languages for the indigenous groups. The language use survey involved 568 indigenous adolescents in six schools in Sarawak, Malaysia. The results show that the domains of the ethnic language are shrinking because of the growing presence of Malay varieties (Standard Malay and Sarawak Malay), particularly for smaller groups. The ethnic language is still strong in the family and religious domains but has little place in the education and mass media domains. In the ethnically heterogeneous public domains of transaction and friendship, the ethnic language is for intra- and Malay varieties for inter-ethnic communication. The demographic characteristics which predict sustained use of the ethnic language are the vitality of the ethnic group, rural locality and lower socio-economic status. Keywords: language use, indigenous languages, ethnic identity, ethnolinguistic vitality\n\nThis paper reports our preliminary sociolinguistic research on the ethnicity, identity and language vitality in minority language maintenance, taking Loloan Malay in East Loloan village as a case study. Loloan Malay was originally only spoken by the Moslems but at the moment it is also acquired as a native language and used as the means of communication by the Moslems and non-Moslems in this village. This language is well maintained in various situations although it is frequently mixed with the lexicon from its contact languages, Balinese, Bugis, and Indonesian, Arabic, even English. The data was collected through ethnography and extended interviews with samples based on the three groups, namely teenagers, adults, and housewives. They were chosen because they are most responsible to the language maintenance and language sustainability. Our study provides fresh empirical evidence for the significance of Loloan Malay as a symbolic linguistic tool, playing a central role for group-internal and group-external identity, giving rise to sustainable language vitality. Our findings also confirm with the current theoretical paradigm in sociolinguistic research that social group identity is multi-faceted with ethnicity and religion are just two among complex variables, that performance of such identity is ongoing , socially constructed and enforced, and that social identity plays a key role in language maintenance.\n\nLanguage and ethnic identity have been intrinsically linked where an individual’s ability to speak an ethnic language is said to reflect the extent of his or her belonging to that particular ethnic group. This study looks at the case of an indigenous community, the Kayan who live in the interior part of Sarawak, on the island of Borneo. With over 30 different ethnic groups living in Sarawak, how one speaks the indigenous language can be a crucial identifier to his or her ethnic identity and sense of belonging to the ethnic group. This paper highlights how the Kayan community reflects on the importance and use of their ethnic language and how they view the language in relation to their belonging to the ethnic group. The paper focuses on the way the older generation perceives language use amongst the young speakers of the ethnic language and seeks to specifically provide a case study of ethnic identity, language use and attitudes in Sarawak, Borneo. Keywords: Borneo, Ethnic identity and language, Kayan, language use and attitudes, Language loss.\n\nMalaysia is a multi-ethnic and multilingual country where over 130 languages are spoken by a population of around 32 million people. In spite of such diversity, only one language is official: Malay. English and Mandarin are very widespread, and in many cases, they are slowly replacing the local ethnic languages. This paper attempts to gauge the extent of language shift and displacement of the family heritage language (the language(s) spoken by parents or grandparents) among 189 students from the Faculty of Languages and Linguistics at the University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur. The ethnolinguistic vitality of these languages within this particular population was determined through a sociolinguistic survey on language use and attitudes. The article closes with some thoughts on the factors that might explain the results obtained, and what could be done to improve the situation.\n\nThis study assessed the objective ethnolinguistic vitality (OEV) of three indigenous languages spoken in Ilocos Norte, Philippines-Isnag, Isneg Yapayao, and Itneg Tingguian. It also examined the factors that contribute to such OEV levels in terms of demographics, institutional support and control factors, and status factors. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of responses of 90 respondents were employed. Results revealed that the demographics of L1 speakers are essential elements towards maintenance of their L1. As found in the three L1 communities, a majority of them (57%) speak their native language. Though these communities exist amidst a more dominant community, intergenerational transmission of their language likely takes place. Birth rate is higher than death rate which implies that more speakers of the L1 are expected thus enabling them to survive in the next generations to come. Various institutions provide support to them in terms of education, government services, economy, politics, religion, and socio-cultural support. Media and religious institutions were found to have less support given towards language vitality. Status factors, likewise, need reinforcement. Owing to Giles et al.'s (1977) OEV model, the vitality level of the three L1 is medium.\n\nThe main aim of this article is to assess the present level of language vitality for Baba Malay, a Malay variety spoken by Melaka's Baba Nyonyas (also known as Peranakan Chinese or Straits Chinese), the oldest Chinese community in Malaysia. This has been done through a survey on language use and attitudes where the answers provided by the younger and older respondents have been compared (apparent time), and through the parameter of ethnolinguistic vitality known as EGIDS (Expanded Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale). After an introduction and a short outline of language vitality in Malaysia and of the Baba Nyonyas and their heritage language, the article describes in detail the methodology employed followed by an analysis of the results obtained and a discussion on the Baba Nyo-nyas's linguistic repertoire and the endangered status of their heritage language. In the conclusion, some general considerations and some advice are offered for the maintenance of Baba Malay."
