Iban (Jaku Iban)

Iban is a Malayo-Polynesian language spoken by about 1.4 million people on the island of Borneo, mainly in Sarawak in Malayasia, and in neighbouring parts of Indonesia and Brunei. Iban speakers belong to the Dayak ethnic group and used to be known as "Sea Dayak". The Iban language is also known as Iban Sabah or Sea Dayak, and is closely related to Malay, particularly the Malay of Sarawak.

In Malaysia Iban is spoken by about 1.4 million people mainly in the state of Sarawak, and also in the Tawau district in the state of Sabah. It is taught in primary schools and used in literature and the media. In Brunei there are about 15,800 speakers of Iban in the districts of Belait, Tutong and Temburong. There are also about 15,000 Iban speakers in Indonesian, particularly in the Kapuas Hulu regency of West Kalimantan province.

Written Iban

Iban is usually written with the Latin alphabet, however there is an alternative script, known as the Dunging Script (urup Dunging) or the Iban alphabet, which was invented between 1947 and 1962 by Dunging Anak Gunggu. It is rarely used.

Iban pronunciation

Sample text in Iban (Lord's Prayer)

Apai kami di serega

Kudus mih nama nuan

Datai mih perintah nuan

Jadi peneka nuan

Baka ka dalam serega

Bakanya dalam bumi.

Meri ka kami

Pengidup tiap ari.

Ampunka penyalah kami

Baka ka kami ti

Ngampunka urang

Ti salah ngelaban kami

Intu kami ari penguji

Lepas ke kami ari penyai

Laban nuan ti bempu perintah

Enggau kuasa enggau mulia

Dataika belama-lama iya

Amin

Our father in heaven, hallowed be your name. Thy kingdom come, on earth as in heaven. Gives us our daily bread. Forgive us of our sin, as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temtation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power and the glory are yours. Now and forever. Amen.
