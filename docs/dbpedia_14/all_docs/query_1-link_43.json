        "text": "Established in the 15th century, Gujarat Sultanate was a medieval Indian kingdom founded by Zafar Khan(Muzaffar Shah). He was appointed as the governor of Gujarat by Nasir-ud-Din Muhammad bin Tughluq IV in 1391. Zafar Khan defeated Farhat-ul-Mulk near Anhilwada Patan and made the city his capital. However, the history of Gujarat Sultanate only flourished during the rule of Mahmud Shah, who was known as Mahmud Begada.\n\nLet’s have a look at the Sultans of Gujarat and their contribution in making Gujarat a success.\n\nAhmad Shah\n\nAfter taking to the throne, Ahmad Shah faced a lot of rebellion from his uncles. The rebellion was led by his uncle Firuz Khan, but Ahmad Shah proved to be more powerful than his enemies and most of them surrendered to him. During this rebellion Sultan Hushang Shah of Malwa Sultanate invaded Gujarat. He invaded again in 1417 along with Nasir Khan, the Farooqi dynasty ruler of Khandesh and occupied Sultanpur and Nandurbar. However, Gujarat army defeated them and later Ahmad Shah led four expeditions into Malwa, Gujarat. There were other enemies like the Kanha Raja of Jhalawad with the help of the Bahmani Sultan Ahmad Shah tried to defeat Ahmad Shah, but were unsuccessful.\n\nMahmud Begada\n\nAbu-al Fath Mahmud Shah, popularly known as Mahmud Begada expanded the kingdom is all the directions and the history of Gujarat was never the same. He also conquered two forts. Mahmud Shah of Gujarat died on 23rd November 1511.\n\nMuzaffar Shah\n\nKhalil Khan gained the title of Muzaffar Shah. In 1519, Rana Sanga of Chittor defeated the joint army of Malwa along with Gujarat Sultanates and took Mahmud Shah II of Malwa captive. On seeing the condition, Muzaffar Shah sent his army to aid, but Rana Sanga didn’t require any help. But there was so much greed hidden inside Rana Sanga that he invaded Gujarat and plundered the Sultanate’s treasure, thus greatly damaging its prestige. After Rana’s death, his son Sikandar took centerstage but he too was murdered by a noble Imád-ul-Mulk, who seated a younger brother of Sikandar, named Násir Khán, on the throne with the title of Mahmúd Shah II and governed on his behalf.\n\nBahadur Shah\n\nBahadur Shah, the other son of Muzaffar Shah II returned and expanded the kingdom but then Gujarat was attacked by Mughal Emperor Humayun, however, Bahadur Shah regained the kingdom in 1536 but he was killed by the Portuguese on board the ship when making a deal with them. But Bahadur Shah didn’t have a son, who’d be the successor after his death. However, there was one Mughal fugitive named Muhammad Zaman Mirza who wanted to claim the throne as Bahadur Shah’s mother adopted him as her son. But Bahadur’s nobles selected Bahadur’s nephew Miran Muhammad Shah as the successor, but he died on his way to Gujarat.\n\nArchitecture\n\nGujarat sultanate architecture was wonderful and magnificent as the sultans were patrons of a distinctive architecture that blended Islamic elements with Gujarat’s indigenous Hindu and Jain architectural traditions. Their splendid architecture can be seen on minarets, mihrabs, jali and chattris."
