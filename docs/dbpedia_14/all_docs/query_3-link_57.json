The old Treaty\n\nwhereby Great Brita.in obtained pONes•\n\nsion <>f the Island of Singapore, which waa\n\ndrawn up by Sir Stamford Raffles a.nd\n\nfinaJly ratified in 1894, had the effect, if\n\nltrictly construed, of cla.iming for the\n\n179 Strait, Settlement, HOUSE OF COMMONS and J ohore Bill. 180\n\n[Mr. Ormsby-Gore.]\n\nColony of Strait.a Settlements not merely\n\nthe whole of the water of the Island of\n\nSingapore, but of islands which really are\n\npart of the State of J ohore. One of these\n\nislands is 100 yards from J obore and two\n\nor three miles from Singapore. It is a\n\nam.all island of 26 acres a.nd according to\n\nthe Treaty of 1824, was regarded aa part\n\nof the Colony of the Straits Settlements\n\nbut, according to justice and equity, and\n\naccording to intention it ought to be part\n\nof the State of Joh ore. Furth el' difficulties\n\nha.ve arisen in regard to policing\n\na.rrangements. According to the original\n\nTreaty of 1824 the State of J ohore had no\n\njurisdiction in this respect and the result\n\nwas that there was continual friction, H\n\nthe Straits Settlements police arrested\n\npeople who were Johore subject. and not\n\nBritish subjects, in what were obviously\n\nJ'obore wa.ters. So it was arra.nged by\n\nthe la.te governor that a new Treaty\n\nshould be drafted redefining the line\n\nbetween the State of J ohore and the\n\nStraits Settlements. That was given\n\neffect tlO, and a final survey wa.s made by\n\nthe present governor, &Dd the ma.tter now\n\nrequires Parliamentary aa,nction. It :ii& &\n\ncession of the rights acquired by Sir\n\nStamford Raffles in 1824 long before the\n\npresent practical considerations had\n\narisen but it is only in accordance with\n\nthe rights of the State of Johore that the\n\nmistake should be rectified and that a.\n\nformal line should be drawn between the\n\nState of J ohore and ourselvee.\n\nMr. KELLY: I beg to move, to leave\n\nout the word \" now/' and a.t the end of\n\nthe Queation to add the words \" upon this\n\nday three months.\"\n\nI should like to hear from the :Minister\n\nin charge how much territory is being\n\nhanded ba,ck to the Sulta.n of Johore. I\n\ndo not wa.nt to go into the whole question\n\nof Singapore, but one would like Iii<>\n\nknow how much military or naval advice,\n\nwith rega.rd these isla.nds, is involved in\n\ntliie proposal. If there is one point which\n\njuati:6.es a Motion for the rejection of this\n\nBill it is the absence of inf01·mation upon\n\nit. The small map which baa been pla.ced\n\nin the tea room gives no clear indication\n\nof the intentions of the Government.\n\nOne would like more informa.tion &a to\n\nthe erection of this bridge or c&Usewa.y\n\nbetween Singapore and the mainland of\n\nJ' ohore. The whole propoaal is difficult\n\nto understand, and the Department concemed\n\nis to blame if there is any want\n\nof understanding among hon. Members.\n\nbecause of their failure to produce for us\n\nproper maps and information. One of the\n\npoints ma.de by the Under-Secretary was\n\nabout the difliculty of policing these\n\nwaters, but I think there will be the same\n\ndifficulty in the future. You are proposing\n\nto draw a line of division, and I take\n\nit there will then be a double system of\n\npolicing-policing from the J oho re side\n\nas well as the Singapore side. I am not\n\nsure that the drawing of this imaginary\n\nline will ma.ke it a.ny leas difficult to police\n\nthese waters. My reason for moving the\n\nrejection is the abse11ee of informa.tion,.\n\nand because we a.re not quite clear as to\n\nwhether it is intended tha.t the erection\n\nof further arma.ments aha.II ta.ke pla.ce on\n\ntha.t site. I am informed by one w bo has\n\nrecently returned from tha.t part of the\n\nworld that a. good deal of this la.nd ia in\n\nthe poBlession of another country, having\n\nbeen leased to it. If that be so. at a.ny\n\nrate we ought to be informed of it. In\n\nthe absence of this informa.tioo, I move\n\nthe rejection of the Bill.\n\nMr. MARDY JONES: I beg to second\n\nthe Amendment. i do so in order that\n\nwe may get the necessa!'Y information\n\nfrom the Government on this ma.tter.\n\nMr. ORMSBY-GORE: I am very happy\n\nto supply the information which baa been\n\na.sked for. This Bill has nothing to do\n\nwith the causeway which was completed\n\nsome time ago to establish road a.nd\n\nrailway communications betw~en the\n\nmainland and the Island of Singapore\n\nfor commercial purposes. With rega:rd\n\nto the Islands, I believe there a.re three.\n\nAll are uninhabited, but one, the largest,\n\nis of .some economic importance, as it\n\nhae this quarry for road metal. Ita\n\ntotal area, is a.bout 26 acres, one rood.\n\nThese small islands, if this Bill is passed,\n\nwill be recognised as belonging to the\n\nState of Johore. There is no truth whatever\n\nin the suggestion that any other\n\nforeign Power contemplates the use of\n\nany of these islands for military or other\n\npurposes, or ha.s any lease or other hold\n\nover them. Further than that, in so far\n\nas the police point is concerned, I hope\n\nthe days of rubber smuggling a.re over\n\nfor ever, but, if they are not over, then\n\nit is much better for the Johore police\n\nt;, deal with J ohore subjects and for the\n\nStradta Settlements Police to dea.1 with\n\nStraits Settlement subjects.

I would like O.O. Mar1ne 1s comments.\n\n5. It seem.a to me that if a man wisqe~ to go tishing at night\n\nhe must go out before the curfew and stay ou1i all n1.ght, ot_herwise\n\nwe are wasting our time and energj;es having a curfew, and • .!h!,!\n\nis far more inportnat,g1ving the enell1 oppQrtunities to land\n\nCommunists, arms and literature.\n\n6.

When the Defense Liaison Committee decided that a Curf•\n\nshould be im:o,osed_ for the purpose of stopping traffic a.cross\n\nthe Straits at night, it was stated by Col. L!ttle (who sho•ld\n\nknow) that there was little fishing in the Straits at night\n\nand no great hardship would be imposed by a total ban.\n\n3. Since that time nothing has caused me to believe otherwise,\n\nand we have had,\n\n(a) positive evidence that ~uas fishermen were conveying\n\nCommunist passengers and literature across the\n\nStraits at night;\n\n(b) positive evidence just a few nights ago that sampans\n\nwere bringing in tobacco to S1pore across the\n\nSt.ra.i ts at night, and why not Communists too?\n\nOn 25.9.48 the Cpl.@ Seleta.r caught a sampan\n\nbringing in tobacco the duty on which was f445,\n\nthe man in charge being a. Ma.lay Customs officer\n\nof Johore.\n\n4. On their own initiative the- O.C 1 s of \"F\" & \"G11 ha.ve\n\nissued Curfew Permits to fishermen of Ponggol, Loyang {nr. Ub\n\nand Penggera.ng (nr.

After its conquest by the Portuguese in 1511,\n\nthe son of the last ruler of 1\\ialacca settled in Johore and\n\ncontinued the historic Sultanate. The history of the next\n\n300 years is an almost uninterrupted record of wars.\n\nHostilities ,vith the Portuguese persisted nearly until the\n\narrival of the Dutch in 1602. Johore bears no small part\n\nin Dutch Colonial history; relations were friendly, despite\n\na diplomatic struggle for commercial privileges. But the\n\nconquest of Batu Sawar (near Kota Tinggi) by the\n\nAchinese in 1615 closed one chapter of Johore history as\n\nthe conquest of Johore Lama by the Portuguese in 1587\n\nhad closed another, and it appeared then to the Dutch that\n\nthe renowned kingdom of Johore had come to an end. In\n\nreturn for assistance at the attack on l\\Ialacca in 1641, the\n\nDutch tried to restore J ohore to its position as premier\n\nl\\Ialay State. But the capital ·was burnt by Jambi in 1673;\n\nin 1699 the Sultan \\Yas assassinated, and in 1717 the throne\n\nwas ~eized l,y a Sumatran adYentm·er, Raja Kechil. Then\n\nthe Bugis appeared and the capital of the old empire ,vas\n\ntransferred to Rian Archipelago.\n\nAfter continuous intrigues behYeen the 2\\Ialay and\n\nBugis chiefs, the Dutch in 1784 recognized the Sultan of\n\nLingg-a ns ruler of the J ohore empire, droYe the Bugis\n\nfrom Riau and stationed there a Resident with a garrison:\n\nThe M ala)r Sultan and Bugis Viceroy accepted the position\n\nof dependent l)rinces, but the old empire was in a state of\n\nllissolution, the Bernlahara and Temenggong being virtually\n\nterritorial chiefs in Pahang and Johore respectively.\n\nThis ,,·as the position when the British, by virtue of\n\ntreatie,'1 made in 1810 and 1824, obtaine(l a complete cession\n\nof the island of Singapore. Vi~itors emphasize the then\n\ndeserted character of .Johore: in 1847 Johore Lama consisted\n\nof 25 huts, and not till 1855 was the capital moved to its\n\npresent situation at Johore Bahru.\n\nThe extension of the Pax Britannica \"helped J ohore to\n\ngrow populous again\". i\\IoreoYer since 1855 the country\n\nhas been go\\·erncd hr enlighten eel and progressiYe rulers,\n\nE,ultan Abubakar who died in 1895 and Sultan Ibrahim, the\n\npresent ruler. In 1S95 the Sultan undertook to receive a\n\nBritish agent ha \\·ing the functions of a Consular officer;\n\nin 1910, }1;:n-ing had cl.11 unofficial adviser for some years,\n\nthe Sultan reorganized his Government with the assistance\n\nof the GoYernor of the Straits Settlements; in 1914 a\n\nGeneral Adviser with enlarged powers was appointed.\n\nSince 1924 the completion of a causeway across the Straits\n\nof Tebrau has permitted uninterrupted traffic by rail and\n\nroad between ,Johore and Singapore and by railway between\n\nSingapore and Bangkok. The East coast route has been\n\ndestroyed since the .Japanese occupation.\n\nThe recent history of the State has been a record of\n\ncontinued prosperity which was rudely interrupted at the\n\nAnnex33\n\nMinutes of a Meeting of the Ad Hoc Committee appointed by the\n\nRural Board, Singapore, to revise the Rural District Boundaries,\n\n10 July 1952\n\nMinutes or a Meeting or the Ad Hoc Camnittee\n\nappointed by the Rural Board, Singapore, to\n\nrevise the Rural District Boundar1es1 held\n\non 'L'lUl'sday the J.Oth July.1952 at 2 • .,0 p.m.\n\n· at the Land Office.\n\nPresent : The Chairman, Rura1 Board (The Hon1ble Mr. J.A.

The Land Enactments of the States of the Federation are\n\nbased on the Torrens system of title registration the declared,\n\nobject of which is to establish and certify. under the authority of\n\nGovernment, the ownership · of an absolute and indefeasible title\n\nto land and to simplify its transfer. ·\n\n2. Registration of title is not yet in force in the Settlements\n\nof Penang and Malacca but its introduction there is under active\n\nconsideration. The survey system in the two Settlements is, however,\n\nthe same as that adopted in the rest of the Federation and\n\nit can fairly be said that the Survey Department is ready for the\n\nchange in title system when it occurs.\n\n3. Under the Torrens system efficient survey of land for\n\ntitle is termed \"a pillar of registration\". All title surveys must\n\ntherefore be permanent in the sense that re-survey for the attainment\n\nof a higher standard of accuracy or marking of boundaries\n\nwill not be necessary at some future date, and the technical\n\nquality of each survey must be such 'that a lost or displaced\n\nboundary mark can be accurately reconstituted at any time and\n\n~oundary disputes be resolved speedily and without further\n\nquestion.\n\n4. The main functions of the Federation Survey Department\n\nare therefore:\n\n(a) to produce concrete evidence which completely and\n\npermanently identifies the land conveyed by any title\n\nissued ·by Government;\n\n(b) to compile and make available the records of alienation\n\nwhich are essential for efficient land administration.\n\nBut efficient land administration demands the full and close co~\n\noperation of the Survey Department and Land Offices throughout\n\nthe country. as provided in the Land Enactments, ano the\n\naim of such co-operation must be the establishment and maintenance\n\nof public confidence in the system of land tenure. The\n\nSurvey Department and Land Offices have particular spheres of\n\nresponsibility but in some respects there is an essential intermingling\n\nof functions and two of these, although not written into\n\nthe Land Enactments. are implied in the Survey Department list\n\nof functions, viz.:\n\n(c) to eliminate any possibility of the existence of more\n\nthan one document of title to any piece of land;\n\n(d) to t;μdeavour to secure proper agreement between\n\nboundaries of possession or occupation and of title\n\nownership.\n\nThe non-title survey functions of the Department are:\n\n(e) to make and publish reliable maps\n\n(/) to undertake special surveys and tasks for which the\n\nDepartment is particularly fitted.\n\n5. There is ample evidence to show that much of the\n\neconomic prosperity of the country is attributable to the general\n\nexcellence of the Land Enactments and the survey system which\n\nserves them. Capital from abroad is attracted to the Federation\n\nwhen it is known that land titles are guaranteed by Government\n\nboth as to ownership and to boundaries. In times of acute\n\nfinancial stringency, shortage of staff, heavy arrears of work and\n\nurgent demands for a much higher survey output, it may appear\n\nan elementary precept to abandon the existing survey standards\n\nand to adopt technical methods of inferior quality in order to\n\nmeet urgent needs of the moment. But such a policy is wrong\n\nand has already been proved so in Malaya. Once Government\n\nhas selected and legally introduced the code of land tenure, the\n\nsurvey system must be initiated and permanently maintained. The\n\nmoney required to maintain that system must be found by the\n\nAdministration, supplemented as the country develops. by an adequate\n\nschedule of survey fees to be demanded from the public\n\nfor specific survey services rendered by the Survey Department.\n\nSURVEY FEES\n\n6. In- many countries operating under the Torrens system,\n\nthe main activities of the Survey Department are concerned with\n\nsurveys for Government. i.e .• for official purposes such as reserves,\n\nacquisitions, and surveys in respect of land already alienated are\n\nexecuted by privately practising Licensed Surveyors. In the\n\nFederation however, the Survey Department holds a monopoly in\n\nrespect of all surveys for title and due weight has hitherto been\n\ngiven to this factor in framing the schedule of survey fees. It has\n\nbeen recognised, for instance, that the orderly development of\n\nland alienation is an integral part of Government policy and for\n\nthis reason Government must pay part of the cost of survey. It\n\nmust also be remembered that very many peasant landholders are\n\nunable to afford the full economic charges on their land at the\n\ntime they apply for its alienation e.g.. premium on purchase,\n\nannual rent and survey fees which it would be reasonable to levy.\n\nin a wealthier community. For this reason survey fees were framed\n\nmore on the basis of what the applicants, as a class, could afford\n\nto pay. rather than on the actual cost to the Survey Department\n\nor the value of the service rendered. Furthermore provision has\n\nbeen made for the statutory remission of survey fees by Collectors.·\n\nof Land Revenue, the net result being that .in very many deserving\n\nand authentic cases, peasants pay only a token amount in respect\n\nof such fees.\n\n.._\n\n7. It was decided at the end of 1953 to introduce a new\n\nschedule of fees and to re-classify survey operations thereunder.\n\n2\n\n295\n\n296\n\nin draughtsman-hours but the machines have been made available\n\nfor work on behalf of other Departments and of members of the\n\npublic. These machines are one of our best investments and have\n\nmore than repaid their cost already.\n\nBOUNDARY MARKS\n\n25. Malaya being a tropical country of high rainfall. it is\n\nessential that survey boundary marks should be permanent not\n\nonly in the sense that they should be manufactured of durable\n\nmaterials but also that each mark should be suitable for the\n\ntype of soil in which it is emplaced. Marks have been standardised,\n\nby far the most common being a solid cylindrical reinforced\n\nconcrete mark about two feet long and about four inches in\n\ndiameter. This mark is placed vertically in the ground leaving\n\nthe top three inches projecting and the soil is well rammed round\n\nit. In padi areas it is frequently necessary to use concrete marks\n\nof smaller cross-sectional area but about four feet long. and for\n\nthe marking of important control traverses and on -certain mining\n\nsurveys. iron pipes four to six feet long and 1 ½ inches in diameter\n\nare driven vertically into the ground. the top of the mark at\n\nsurface level often being surrounded by a cubic foot of concrete.\n\nMarks in towns may be concrete pegs or iron spikes. About·\n\n70.000 boundary marks are annually emplaced throughout the\n\ncountry.\n\n26. In Johore. concrete marks are manufactured on contract.\n\nand in most other Divisions their manufacture is undertaken\n\ndepartmentally. the all-in cost per mark at each factory being\n\n50-60 cents. To this of course must be added the cost of transport\n\nto the field, which is an expensive item. Iron pipes are made from\n\ndiscarded boiler tubes and are usually tarred before issqe to the\n\nfield.\n\nTOPOGRAPHICAL SURVEY\n\n27. The Revenue or Title Survey Divisions of the Department\n\nare concerned with the survey of property boundaries. and\n\nit is the function of the Topographical Division to survey Malaya\n\ntopographically. i.e.. to prepare maps showing the physical\n\nfeatures of the country. These maps are of immense value for\n\ndevelopment purposes especially in a country like Malaya where\n\nnatural jungle cover precludes rapid reconnaissance of the ground.\n\nMalaya is indeed fortunate in that the foresight of early survey\n\nadministrators resulted in the creation of the Topographical\n\nDivision in the year 1910. Booms, slumps and retrenchments since\n\nthen have, of course, had their effect on the amount of money\n\nand the number of men available to run the Division. but when\n\nit is remembered that, until 1941. the survey methods adopted\n\ninvolved slow and expensive footslogging over the whole area\n\ncovered by each published sheet. it is indeed remarkable that\n\nas much as 60 per cent. of the country had been topographically\n\nmapped by the end of the latter year.\n\nAERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY\n\n28. The need 10 complete the mapping of. the remammg\n\n40 per cent. as quickly as possible became apparent after the war\n\n8\n\nand it was then decided to invoke the aid of air photography and\n\nto aim at a target period of 10 years for such completion. Through\n\nthe good offices of the Director of Colonial Surveys, arrangements\n\nwere made for the R.A.F. to undertake the task of photographing\n\nthe peninsula from the air. under a grant from the Colonial\n\nDevelopment and Welfare Scheme. This task has now been\n\ncompleted and the photographs have not only been made available\n\nfor map compilation purposes but are filed in the Departmental\n\nAir Photo Library at Headquarters where they may be inspected\n\nby any Government organisation having need of them. The\n\noutbreak of the Emergency in 1948 however made it necessary\n\nto shelve the 10-year plan and to substitute a short-term programme\n\ndesigned to produce maps of the hitherto unmapped\n\n40 per cent. of the country as quickly as possible. This shortterm\n\nprogramme has now been completed and a series of\n\nEmergency or \"E\" maps has been compiled and printed. These \"E\"\n\nmaps were produced from the air photographs controlled by such\n\nground survey and additional information as it was possible to\n\nobtain at short notice and because they lack contours and are\n\ngenerally below the required technical standard. they are classed\n\nas reconnaissance sheets only.\n\n29. The position at present is that topographical maps, on a\n\npublication scale of one mile to one inch, are available over the\n\nwhole country, 60 per cent of them being classed as based on rigid\n\nsurvey and the remaining 40 per cent being reconnaissance\n\nsheets only. ·\n\nNATIONAL GR.ID\n\n30. Published topographical maps bear one of two reference\n\nthousand yard grids (a) the Johore grid for areas in Johore and\n\nSingapore lying east of longitude 102° 45' and south of latitude\n\n2° 45', or (b} the Malaya grid for the rest of the country. It is\n\nunnecessary here to go into the reasons for the introduction many\n\nyears ago of these two entirely separate grids. but they are most\n\ninconvenient and it has been decided to substitute a new National\n\nGrid for the whole of Malaya and to abolish the existing old grids\n\nwhen this has been done. At the same time it has also been decided\n\nto adopt an entirely new projection for all maps of Malaya other\n\nthan those of the cadastral survey. The new projection is\n\nOrthomorphic. the central meridian being skewed to 324 ° to\n\nconform to the general geographical axis of the country. The\n\nnecessary computations have been made and several State/\n\nSettlement Land Utilization Maps have already been published\n\non the new projection and bearing the new National Grid. The\n\nmaximum scale error of the new projection is about 1 in 6.600\n\nagainst l in 2000 on the old one.\n\n31. Advantage of this change has been taken to re-design\n\nthe topographical sheet layout. The existing sheets cover one\n\nquarter of a degree of latitude and one quarter of · a degree of\n\nlongitude, each sheet being approximately square with sides of\n\nabout 17 inches and covering about 300 square miles. In the new\n\nseries, sheets are not bounded by lines of latitude and longitude\n\nbut by convenient grid lines. Each sheet will be roughly 50 per\n\n9\n\n297\n\n298\n\ncent. larger than in the old series, covering about 4 70 square miles.\n\nEach new series one-mile sheet will be accompanied by six\n\n1 / 25000 sheets covering the same area for the benefit of those\n\nusers who prefer or need a larger scale. Appendices to this Report\n\nshow the old and new series sheet layouts.\n\nPRESENT TOPOGRAPHICAL PROGRAMME\n\n32. The Topographical Division is working to the following\n\nprogramme:\n\n(a) Field revision of the old Johore/Singapore sheets and\n\ntheir publication in new series form. This will remove\n\nthe present J ohore grid. Completion of field work is\n\nexpected at the end of 1956.\n\n(b) The field survey. compilation and publication in the\n\nnew series form of maps.of all areas at present covered\n\nby the \"E', reconnaissance series. This task, which\n\nembraces Kelantan, Trengganu and parts of Pahang\n\nand Upper Perak. is scheduled for completion in 1961.\n\nWhen tasks (a) and (b) have been completed, the whole of\n\nMalaya will be completely covered by rigid topographical survey,\n\na state of affairs of which the country may well be proud. It is\n\n. true that the eastern half of the country plus J ohore and Singapore\n\nwill be covered by up-to-date new series sheets on the new\n\nNational Grid while the rest of the country is in old series form\n\non the ~Id Malaya. 9\"rid, but it is then intended to push rapidly\n\nahead with the revision of the old West Coast sheets and publish\n\nthem in new series form on the National Grid.\n\n33. The fact that most of the West Coast sheets are sadly\n\nout-of-date, some having been surveyed over 40 years ago, is one\n\nof serious concern and consideration is now being given to the\n\nquestion of undertaking the revision of some of them and republishing\n\nin new series form pari passu with the main programme.\n\nCARTOGRAPHY\n\n34. The Department possesses a small but efficient Cartographic\n\nBranch. This was created in 1910 solely for the purpose\n\nof producing Survey Department maps but, containing the only\n\nGovernment lithographic establishment in Malaya, it has\n\ngenerally been required, from time to time, to handle a great\n\ndeal of other work such as rubber control coupons, bonds. stamps,\n\nmotor licences and even low denomination currency notes. The\n\nvolume and urgency of this external work has frequently been\n\nsuch as to push map production work into the background and\n\neven now it is uncomfortably large. The Branch is controlled by\n\nthe Chief Cartographer who has a staff of four Division I specialists\n\nand 96 Technical officers.\n\n35. The equipment of the Branch, is in the main, old and\n\nworn out and must be replaced. This applies particularly to the\n\nprinting machines. Replacements and expansion are however\n\nimpracticable in the building now occupied, but in spite of these\n\nlimitations maps produced by the Brancll are of high quality and\n\n10\n\nhave already obtained recognition in the field of world carto ..\n\ngraphy. The Branch produces maps not only of Malaya but also\n\n· of Singapore, Sarawak, Brunei and North Borneo on behalf of\n\nthe Governments of those territories.\n\n36. In the field of business economics, the running of a\n\ncartographic establishment is a complicated undertaking especially\n\nif the establishment is small and the dem;;inds heavy. In war, the\n\nproduction of up-to-date maps is part of the efficient service\n\nrendered by the Army to the Fighting Services, but a civilian\n\ncartographic establishment, severely limited as to expenditure,\n\nis faced with the problem of deciding what maps can be produced\n\nfor the Administration and the public on the limited money available.\n\nAt the existing state of economic development of Malaya,\n\nthere is insufficient demand to make the sale of maps pay for\n\ntheir production and because maps rapidly become out-of-date.\n\n· wholesale stockpiling against future deffl:ands is impracticable.\n\nThe policy therefore bas been to produce a series of basic\n\nMalayan maps as follows:\n\n(a) Maps of the whole country, tanging from the 6 miles\n\nto one inch political map of Malaya to the small 45\n\nmiles to an inch map used for reports. etc.\n\n(b) State and Settlement maps, on scales ranging from one\n\nto four, miles to the inch. These maps, which are\n\nnow termed \"Land Utilization Mapsn, show the purpose\n\nof land alienation together with as much topographical\n\ninformation (other than contours) as is\n\n. . · required to make them useful general purpose maps.\n\n(c) Topographical maps, scale one mile to one inch, ns\n\ndescribed in para. 29.\n\n(d) Town maps on various scales, of the half-dozen or so\n\nmajor towns.\n\n( e) Special maps designed to meet the needs of certain\n\nDepartments, e.g .• Geological and Forestry maps.·\n\n37. Experience has shown. that the Malayan public are becoming\n\nincreasingly · ~tnap· conscious\". This is a perfectly natural\n\ndemand fostered by the · rapid· economic qevelopment of the\n\ncountry 2nd it will have to be met when the present Emergency\n\nrestriction on the sale of maps is lifted. The dense jungle cover\n\nof Malaya imposes a virtual blanket of blindness on ground reconnaissance\n\nand it can be said without fear of contradiction that\n\nthe provision of accurate maps is essential before any major land\n\ndevelopment project is even contemplated.\n\nINSTRUMENT REPAIRING\n\n38. The Instrument Repairing Branch was established in\n\n1910 to care for the instruments and equipment of the Department.\n\nTo this function has been added, as time passed. a similar\n\nresponsibility in respect of the instruments of other Government\n\nDepartments, and, within the last year or two, the repair and\n\nmaintenance of all the calculating machines owned by the\n\nFederation Government throughout the country. The financial\n\nsaving to the Federation by putting valuable reconditioned\n\n11\n\n299\n\n1 300 1\n\n61. During 1954, therefore, the :Division operated· on Loan\n\nAccount. The total expenditure for the year: amounted to $802,907,\n\nincluding $78,140 spent on Drainage arid Irrigation Department\n\nsurveys.\n\nMETHODS\n\n(>2. It was stated in para. 28 that photographic cover from\n\nthe air is now available over the whole country. In compiling a\n\ntopographical map, these photographs are. . extensively. used\n\nsupplemented by planimetric control on the ground. Much of what\n\nappears on the ground is hidden by jungle from the · cari;iera and,\n\nit is the ta~k of ground survey parties not only · to pick · up these\n\nhidden features but to effect the necessary triangulation required\n\nfor the control· of. the photographs themselves.· A certain amount of\n\nground traversing is also necessary for the control of planimetry\n\nand heighting. Where contouring ·is added by ground survey,· such\n\ntraversing may exceed eightHnear miles per ~quare mile but where\n\ncontours can be added by instrume11taj determination fr.om air\n\nphotographs, this may. be reduced to two or' three linear miles.\n\nMULTIPLEX. ·\n\n63.: .· Of · the approxim_ately 17,000 square miles ·to· be\n\ncompleted under the programme more . than .half is __ mo-μntainous\n\nor otherwise well-defined COlliltry.

The area to be surveyed is about 75 square\n\nmiles. and by the end of the year the survey was about half\n\ncompleted. Costs amounted to $37.776.\n\nIn all 59 miles of traverse with level heights and 118 miles\n\nof no height traverse were surveyed.\n\nAIR PHOTO LIBRARY\n\nVery little photography. consisting mainly of trigs. sorties.\n\nwas received during the year.

Operation of the equipment\n\nbegan in June when a training course began under the\n\nguidance of a Technical Assistant who had received a year course\n\non this work at the Directorate of Colonial Surveys. To date ten\n\ntechnical staff have reached a reasonable proficiency. No progress.\n\nwork has been possible as diapositives are not yet available for\n\nthese areas. The revision of part of sheet 108, previously contoured\n\nby D.C.S. and for which diapositives are available, was\n\nundertaken and 65 square miles were revised. Costs for 1956\n\namounted to $8,350.\n\n(j) Compiling and Editing Section.-· About 30 technical staff\n\nwere ·employed in headquarters on the original compilation of\n\nmaps from air photographs and the final editing and checking of\n\nwork received from the field prior to its despatch to C.D.O.\n\nIn 1956 a total of 1.436 square miles was compiled and three\n\nsheets Nos. 114. 122 and 128 sent for reproduction.\n\n20\n\nSUMMARY OF COSTS-1956\n\nDEVELOPMENT LoAN EXPENDITURE UNDER PART l OF\n\nAPPENDIX VIII-8953-35\n\nTrengganu North Block\n\nCentre Block\n\nSouth Block\n\nKela.nta.n 2nd Block ..\n\n3rd Block\n\n4th Block\n\nPa.hang 1st Block\n\n100-108\n\n109-110\n\n(Islands) 110, 111, 119, 120 ..\n\n112\n\nTraining\n\n113\n\n114\n\n115\n\n116\n\n117\n\n118-119\n\n122-123\n\n124 ..\n\n125-127\n\n128-129\n\n130, 131, 133, 134 ..\n\n132, 135\n\nKuala Lumpur Town\n\nMultiplex\n\nTrig. . .\n\nPrecise Level ..\n\nDrainage and Irrigation Dept.\n\nPhoto Library\n\nClerical\n\nChief Surveyor Administrations\n\nTotal spent in 1956\n\nCostof2nd halfDecember, 1956 (1957 votes)\n\nCost of 2nd ha.If December, 1955 ( 1956 votes)\n\nTotal spent from 1956 votes\n\n23\n\n$ c.\n\n10,706 16\n\n175,624 69\n\n63,295 64\n\n· IOS,825 16\n\n111,173 81\n\n, 57,086 72\n\n1,512 00\n\n28,930 58\n\n31,800 40\n\n1,855 57\n\n794 34\n\n1,764 86\n\n24,641 29\n\n35,202 56\n\n23,944 86\n\n50,531 25\n\n18,445 41\n\n25,616 81\n\n43,980 05\n\n30,782 92\n\n23,734 10\n\n5,826 65\n\n18,816 95\n\n3,257 42\n\n12,112 20\n\n9,136 00\n\n7,527 75\n\n9,739 32\n\n1,507 08\n\n15,583 25\n\n107,202 70\n\n1,060,958 50\n\n-13,863 84\n\n+12,837 02\n\n1,059,931 68\n\n313\n\n314\n\nMAP 2.\n\nONE INCH TO ONE MILE\n\nTOPOGRAPHICAL SHEET INDEX DIAGRAM NEW SERIES\n\nMALAYA\n\ns· CH IN A 0 5\n\n..\n\n(/l ·. \\; .. ..... ;..\n\n~ 54 i5f ·55 '57 58 SEA\n\n';,j\n\nI\n\n~- 65 6~. 67 68 69 70 4• ~ 1 4•\n\ntJ) 78 79 80\n\nI 0 86 87 88 89 ...n\n\n3• ~ ··9, 7 3• -y<\n\n2·\n\n~~~00~\n\n2°\n\nSUMATRA\n\nI° 1°\n\n100° 101° 102° 103° 104°\n\nPROGRESS DIAGRAM\n\nNEW SURVEYS OR REVISION 1948 • 1955 .. ....... ..... .......... ~\n\nNEW SURVEYS OR REVISION 1956 ...... ....... ........ c=J\n\nFIELD WORK COMPLETE FOR MULTIPLEX PLOTTING .........
