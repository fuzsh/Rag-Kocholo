        "text": "Kedah is old Islamic port-polity in the Malay Penunsula. And Its have tributary relation with Siam since 13th century. Kedah have influenced from Siam. By the census of 1911 shows large Malay population concentrating on the lowland along the sea shore . Capital of Sultans and old pondoks also stay this area. On the other, in inland (“bukit) of Kedah is not large number population, Inland of Kedah is the world of Thai speakers. Thai speakers are Thai-speaking Muslim(Samsam ) and Siamese. Till a half of 20th Century, they are close each other as Thai-speakers. Government of Kedah could not control this area completely. We can find many Thai temples in inland area. These temples and large numbers of Siamese population gather in a basin of river of Pendang. In old tradition, Siamese have migrated from South Siam, Phatthalung and etc. of Thai speaking Muslims and Siamese area. So, in traditional old Kedah, Sultan have grasped on the port and surrounding lowland of sea shore. And inland are the world of Thai-speaking migrants. Keyword : Kedah, Thai-speaker, Muslim, Samsam, Siamese, inland, migrants,\n\nThis writer delivered a public lecture upon invitation by the renowned NalandaSriwijaya Centre (NSC) at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (ISEAS) in Singapore. In recent years, Thailand – as well as other Southeast Asian nations such as Malaysia, where to date there are said to live more than 100,000 Iranians in its capital Kuala Lumpur alone – has become a popular destination for Iranians. As a matter of fact, Iranian migration to what is now Thailand began as early as the seventeenth century, during the Ayutthaya period when the kingdom hosted a large colony of Iranian merchants. Some of their descendants converted to Buddhism and continued to retain influence in Thai public life to the present day; one prominent example is the Bunnag family, whose ancestor ‘Shaykh Aḥmad’ is said to have come from Qom and arrived at Ayutthaya in 1602. A cohesive, comprehensive, and chronological account of the Persian cultural presence in Southeast Asia is difficult, if not impossible, to p...\n\nKedah had gone through the ages in different colours.Politically, Kedah had gone through phases of expansion and shrinkage, showing differences of her present days borders as compared to the previous years situation.Three hundred years ago Kedah was a larger state.And by considering the ethnic group who speaks Malay in Kedah dialect as mother tongue, the border of the country should be even wider, presently up to southern part of Thailand.Historically, Kedah can be seen in two major periods. Firstly is pre-Islamic period that includes animisme era and the era when the local peoples had embraced Hindu-Buddha.Secondly is the period when the same local community started to embrace Islamic faith until the formation of Islamic sultanate and it goes through time until modern days.Kedah can be considered the oldest state in this region as shown by archaelogical findings.It had entered Iron Age as early as the 3rd century BC as shown by the ruins found at Sungai Batu complex, in Bujang Vall...\n\nThe primary purpose of this article is to reconstruct the date, location, and significance of Ayutthaya's Shi'ite enclave within the former Siamese capital during the seventeenth century. This reassessment is based on a mixture of Persian, Thai, and European sources that clarify the confused picture generated by European cartographers that has for too long cast a shadow over Muslim studies in Thailand. Following a summary of extant explanations and a description of my primary sources and methodological approach, I summarise two aspects of Muslim presence in Ayutthaya. First, I introduce readers to connections between the incremental growth of the Muslim presence in Ayutthaya during the sixteenth century with geopolitical developments on the eastern littoral of the Bay of Bengal. Second, I present the range of accounts provided in primary sources specifically mentioning Ayutthaya's Muslim enclave. Having orientated readers to the origins of the Muslim presence within Ayutthaya's citadel, I incrementally introduce annotated portions of Thai and European maps. These clarify confusion about where and when this Shi'ite mosque was constructed. I conclude with comments about how this reassessment brings into focus the presence of Shi'ite 'alid piety, Shi'ite polemics about local Sunnis, Siamese conversion to Shi'ism, and distinctions between these \"Moors\" and \"Malays.\"\n\nIn the southern border provinces of Thailand, especially Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat, there are two religious group of people, Thai Muslims and Buddhists. They live together, the state and Thai Muslims for a long time. The lack of knowledge in relation to understanding Muslims traditionally religious way of life, Muslims were forced directly or indirectly to act as Thai Buddhists by Thai government. This is one of the biggest conundrum Thai government should address and find an amicable solution urgently. Additionally, it is essential to be noted that historical perspectives of Pattani state is completely different from both side, this can lead to potentially political conflict in this area. Therefore, the government should rewrite a new paradigm by cooperating with all groups of people involve this conflict. If the majority of people could accept the recognition of difference , eventually this will result in peaceful coexistence."
