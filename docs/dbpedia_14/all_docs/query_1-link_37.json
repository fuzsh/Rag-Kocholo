        "text": "UPSC NCERT Notes – Medieval History – Rise of Provincial Kingdoms\n\nIn the wake of decline of the Delhi Sultanate, many provincial kingdoms arose in different parts of India. These include the kingdoms of Gujarat, Malwa, Jaunpur, Bengal, etc.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nToggle\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the year AD 1398, Taimur’s attack on Delhi and the subsequent defeat of the Delhi Sultanate exposed the administrative weakness of the Sultanate. This led to regional provinces asserting their autonomy from the central authority. Bengal in the East, Sindh and Multan in the West, along with subedars in Gujarat, Malwa, and Jaunpur, declared their independence. Additionally, prominent Rajput-dominated provinces like Malwa, Mewar, Amber, and others also chose the path of autonomy.\n\nNumerous regional powers, both pre-existing and newly emerging, played significant roles in India during the rise and fall of the Delhi Sultanate until the 15th century.\n\nGujarat\n\nIn the 13th century, Ulugh Khan and Nusrat Khan, who were generals under Alauddin Khilji, successfully ousted Raja Karna Baghella, the Chalukya ruler, establishing the foundation for sultanate rule in Gujarat.\n\nThroughout the 14th century, the Delhi Sultans wielded absolute power over Gujarat.\n\nHowever, signs of decline started to surface during Firuz Shah’s reign.\n\nIn the era of Firuz Tughlaq, Gujarat was governed by Zafar Khan.\n\nThe invasion by Timur in 1398 provided an opportune moment for the governors to break away from the central authority.\n\nConsequently, both Gujarat and Malwa effectively became independent sultanates.\n\nSignificance of Gujarat\n\nGujarat held a pivotal position as one of the wealthiest provinces of the Delhi Sultanate, boasting fertile land, a thriving handicraft industry, and seaports facilitating trade.\n\nRulers of Gujarat\n\nKey rulers of Gujarat include:\n\nMuzaffar Shah I (AD 1407-1411)\n\nZafar Khan (AD 1407-1411), recognized as the independent ruler of Gujarat in 1407, assumed the title Muzaffar Shah, establishing the Muzaffarid Dynasty with Patan as the capital.\n\nSince its inception, the Kingdom of Gujarat faced ongoing conflicts with neighboring regions like Malwa, Rajputana, Khandesh, and the Bahamani Kingdoms.\n\nAhmad Shah I (AD 1411-1443)\n\nAhmad Shah I, the true architect of the Kingdom of Gujarat, laid the foundations of Ahmedabad in AD 1413, shifting the capital from Patan.\n\nGrandson of Zafar Khan, he implemented governance reforms, quelled noble rebellions, and both consolidated and expanded the kingdom during his extensive rule.\n\nHe conquered Saurashtra, including the Girnar Fort, ultimately returning it to the Raja after securing a tribute guarantee.\n\nHe launched an attack on the Hindu pilgrimage center of Sidhpur, causing significant destruction to many exquisite temples. Additionally, he instituted the Jizyah tax on Hindus, marking the first occurrence of such a tax in Gujarat.\n\nA prolific builder, he drew inspiration from the architectural traditions of the Jain style. Notable constructions during his reign include the Jama Masjid in Ahmedabad and the Teen Darwaza.\n\nMahmud Begada (AD 1458-1511)\n\nConsidered the greatest Sultan of Gujarat, Mahmud Begada, also known as Begada, earned his title through the conquest of Junagarh and Champaner forts. He further captured the forts of Girnar Hills and established a new town named Mustafabat, serving as the second capital of Gujarat.\n\nHe forged a naval alliance with the Sultans of Turkey and Egypt, achieving victory over the Portuguese in the Battle of Chaul (AD 1508). However, he faced defeat the following year in the Battle of Diu.\n\nHis Chief Minister, Malik Ghori, and court poet Udayraja, who composed Raja Vinoda, were notable figures in his administration. Visitors to his court included the Italian traveler Barthema and the Portuguese traveler Barbosa.\n\nMuzaffar Shah II (AD 1511-1537)\n\nEngaged in conflict with Rana Sanga of Mewar, he played a role in restoring Mahmud Khalji II of Malwa to the throne. Babur considered him one of the great rulers of Hindustan.\n\nBahadur Shah (AD 1528-1537)\n\nAnnexing Malwa in AD 1531, Bahadur Shah emerged as the last capable ruler of Gujarat.\n\nEmperor Akbar ultimately seized control of Gujarat in AD 1572-1573.\n\nMalwa\n\nThe decline of the sultanate paved the way for the emergence of the independent kingdom of Malwa. Dilawar Khan Ghori, the Tughlaq Governor of Malwa, asserted his independence in the year 1401-1402 and proclaimed himself the King of Malwa. He expanded his kingdom’s boundaries by occupying Nimar, Sauyar, Damoh, and Chanderi, and relocated his capital from Dhar to Mandu.\n\nImportance of Malwa\n\nThe Malwa Sultanate, situated around the rivers Narmada and Tapi, served as a buffer between Gujarat, the Bahamani Sultanate, and the Lodi Sultans of Delhi.\n\nRulers of Malwa\n\nSignificant rulers of Malwa include:\n\nHoshang Shah (AD 1406-1435)\n\nIn 1408, Hoshang Shah (1406-1435) successfully reclaimed control over the Malwa throne. He implemented a policy of religious tolerance, encouraging many Rajputs to settle in Malwa. Swiftly taking over Kherla and Gagraun, Hoshang Shah became the first Deccan ruler to extend patronage to the Jains. Nardeva Soni served as one of his advisors, and the Lalitpur Temple was constructed during his reign.\n\nMahmud Khalji (AD 1436-1469)\n\nAfter the murder of Hoshang Shah’s son, Muhammad, Mahmud Khalji ascended to the throne. Engaging in conflicts with neighboring powers, including the Bahamani Sultans, the Sultan of Delhi, the Raja of Gondwana, the Raja of Odisha, and the Ruler of Gujarat, Mahmud Khalji also eyed the expansion of his empire into Mewar.\n\nHis battles with Rana Kumbha of Mewar resulted in both kingdoms claiming victory.\n\nMahmud Khalji erected a seven-storied column in Mandu, while Rana Kumbha raised a victory tower in Chittor.\n\nGhiyas-ud-din (AD 1469-1500)\n\nFollowing Mahmud Khalji, his eldest son, Ghiyas-ud-din, also known as Ghiyath Shah, assumed the throne from 1469 to 1500. Notable for his religious devotion and cultural contributions, he constructed the Jahaz Mahal. Ghiyas-ud-din faced defeat at the hands of Rana Raimal of Chittor.\n\nMahmud Shah (AD 1510-1531)\n\nThe last Khilji ruler of Malwa, Mahmud Shah, surrendered to Bahadur Shah, the Sultan of Gujarat, upon losing the Fort of Mandu in AD 1531. After a prolonged struggle for control in AD 1542, Sher Shah Suri took over Malwa. Shujat Khan was appointed Governor, and Baz Bahadur, Sher Shah Suri’s son, declared independence in AD 1555.\n\nBaz Bahadur (AD 1555-1561)\n\nThe final Sultan of Malwa, Baz Bahadur, gained fame for his association with Queen Roopmati. In the Battle of Sarangpur in AD 1561, he was defeated by Akbar’s army led by Pir Muhammad Khan and Adham Khan. Surrendering to Akbar at Nagpur in AD 1570, Malwa became a province of the Mughal Empire.\n\nMandu Architecture\n\nMandu’s architecture exemplifies medieval provincial art and design, featuring official and residential pleasure palaces, mosques, artificial reservoirs, pavilions, baolis, and embattlements.\n\nMost structures incorporate arched pavilions, creating a light and airy environment to avoid heat retention. Local stone and marble were the primary construction materials. Notable buildings in the Mandu style include Hindola Mahal, Jahaaz Mahal, Rani Rupamati’s double pavilion, and Baz Bahadur’s palace.\n\nMewar\n\nMewar, once a modest principality under the Guhila Dynasty with Nagada as its capital, witnessed a significant historical trajectory. Despite Alauddin Khilji’s capture of Chittor, Mewar’s capital, in AD 1303, Rana Hammir promptly restored it, solidifying the reign of the Sisodiya Dynasty.\n\nIn AD 1335, Rana Hammir (AD 1314-1378) marked the establishment of the second Guhila Dynasty in Chittoor. Following the assassination of Rana Hammir’s grandson, Maharana Mokal, his son Rana Kumbha ascended to the throne of Mewar.\n\nRulers of Mewar\n\nProminent rulers of the Mewar region include:\n\nRana Kumbha (AD 1433-1468)\n\nAlso known as Kumbhakarna Singh, Rana Kumbha, the eminent ruler of the Sisodiya Dynasty, engaged in continuous warfare against Gujarat and Malwa.\n\nRana Kumbha expanded his territories, claiming Kota, Bundi, Amber, Narwar, Durgapur, Sambhar, Nagor, Ranthambore, and Ajmer. Contemporary inscriptions and the literary work Ekling Mahatmya document his military achievements.\n\nHe penned commentaries on Jayadeva’s Gita-Govinda and Chandi Satakam. The Kirti Stambha, a monumental architectural creation at Chittorgarh, stands as a testament to his reign. Tragically, he was assassinated by his son, Uda, in a bid to ascend the throne.\n\nTo secure his kingdom, Rana Kumbha fortified it by constructing five forts: Achalgarh, Kumbhalgarh, Kolana, Vairat, and Maddan.\n\nKumbha, a skilled Veena player, generously supported musicians and artists in his court, contributing to the cultural milieu. His music treatises, such as Sangeet Raj, Sangeet Mimansa, Sangeet Ratnakar, and Shudprabandha, showcase his deep involvement in the arts.\n\nRana Sanga (AD 1509-1528)\n\nBorn as Rana Sangram Singh and the grandson of Rana Kumbha, he achieved notable victories, defeating Mahmud Khalji II of Malwa and Ibrahim Lodi of Delhi at Ghatoli. However, he faced defeat at the hands of Babur in the Battle of Khanwa in AD 1527.\n\nThe Battle of Khanwa in 1527 between Rana Sanga and Babur, and later conflicts between Akbar and Rana Pratap (1567, 1576), marked the onset of a prolonged struggle between the Mughals and the state of Mewar.\n\nIn AD 1528, Rana Sanga engaged in the Battle of Chanderi against Babur to aid Medini Rai, who was under attack. Unfortunately, he fell ill and succumbed in the camp.\n\nKashmir\n\nDuring the 13th century, Kashmir witnessed the rule of the independent but fragile Hindu Kingdom of Jagadeva (AD 1198-1212).\n\nDespite facing challenges from the Damras, a volatile feudal tribe, Jagadeva managed to suppress their rebellions. However, his successors, Rajadeva (1212-1235), Samgramdeva (1235-1252), and Ramdeva (1252-1256), struggled to assert authority.\n\nMahmud of Ghazni attempted invasions in 1015 and 1021, but the formidable Himalayas and Hindukush thwarted his plans. In AD 1320, General Dulacha successfully plundered Kashmir, accumulating immense wealth.\n\nFollowing the murder of Bhautta Prince Rinchan in 1320, Kashmir experienced internal unrest, leading to the establishment of the Shah Mir Dynasty by Shamsuddin in AD 1339.\n\nRulers of Kashmir\n\nKey rulers of Kashmir include:\n\nShah Mir (AD 1339-1555)\n\nIslam firmly took root in Kashmir during Shah Mir’s reign, marking him as the first Muslim ruler in 1339. Sultan Sikandar Shah ruled from 1384 to 1413, during which he enforced religious conversions and persecuted Hindus and Brahmans.\n\nZain-ul-Abidin\n\nZain-ul-Abidin, also known as the Great Sultan or Bud Shah, governed Kashmir from 1420 to 1470. He put an end to violence against non-Muslims, abolished Jizyah, and welcomed back Hindus who had fled earlier regimes.\n\nZain-ul-Abidin restored Hindu libraries and temples, defeated Mongols in Ladakh, and gained control of Baltistan (Tibbat-i-Buzurg).\n\nHis Minister of Justice and Court Physician, Sriya Bhatt, played a crucial role in his administration. Zain-ul-Abidin’s accomplishments included the construction of Zain Lanka, a man-made island in Wular Lake, where he built his palace and mosque. He married a Hindu Princess from Jammu, promoted shawl-making, and had Kalhana’s Rajatarangini translated to Persian.\n\nWith the death of Sultan Zain-ul-Abidin in AD 1470, the Shah Mir Dynasty began to crumble due to weak leadership.\n\nChak Dynasty (AD 1555-1586)\n\nMuhammad Ghazi Shah Chak founded the Chak Dynasty in AD 1555. Originally from the Gilgit Hunza region’s Dard area, the Chaks thwarted attempts by Babur and Humayun to conquer Kashmir. Yusuf Shah Chak ruled from AD 1579 to 1586. He was taken to meet Akbar for negotiations but was imprisoned and eventually died there.\n\nHis demise led to the succession of his son, Yaqub Shah Chak, who assumed the throne of Kashmir. Yaqub Shah Chak endeavored to resist the Mughal army, but the commander Qasim Khan managed to subdue him. Consequently, Akbar seized control of the Kingdom of Kashmir around AD 1586.\n\nJaunpur\n\nMalik Sarwar established the Jaunpur Dynasty, governing Jaunpur from AD 1394 to 1505.\n\nExploiting the weakening Delhi Sultanate and Timur’s invasion of Delhi, Malik Sarwar ushered in a distinctive architectural era known as the Sharqi style. Jaunpur earned the moniker “Sheraz of India,” showcasing examples like the Atala Masjid, Jama Masjid, and Lal Darwaja Masjid.\n\nSharqi Dynasty\n\nProminent rulers of the Sharqi Dynasty include:\n\nMalik Sarwar (AD 1394-1399)\n\nThe founder of the Sharqi Dynasty, Malik Sarwar, secured recognition from the Rai of Jajnagar and the ruler of Lakhnauti during his reign. Upon his demise, his adoptive son Malik Qaranfal ascended the throne, assuming the title of Mubarak Shah.\n\nMubarak Shah (AD 1399-1402)\n\nAlso known as Mallu Iqbal, Mubarak Shah, an influential minister of the Delhi Sultanate, made unsuccessful attempts to reclaim Jaunpur during his rule.\n\nIbrahim Shah (AD 1402-1440)\n\nEfficiently expanding the kingdom’s territories, Ibrahim Shah Sharqi captured Kannauj in 1406 and briefly held Delhi in 1407, although the attempt ultimately failed. Despite this setback, he successfully acquired Kalpi in 1414.\n\nDuring Ibrahim Shah’s reign, significant scholarly works on Islamic theology and law, such as the Fatwa-1-Ibrahim Shahi, the Bahar-ul-Mawwaj (Akhbar-us-Salatin), and the Hashlah-i-Hind, were produced.\n\nMahmud Shah (AD 1440-1457)\n\nMahmud Shah (AD 1440-1457), Ibrahim Shah’s elder son, successfully captured Chunar’s Fort but faced failure in capturing Kalpi.\n\nIn AD 1452, he attempted to invade Delhi but suffered defeat by Bahlol Lodi.\n\nSubsequently, Mahmud Shah aimed to reclaim Delhi by invading Etawah.\n\nHowever, he eventually consented to a treaty recognizing Bahlol Lodi’s authority over Shamsabad.\n\nDuring his rule, around AD 1450, the Lal Darwaja Masjid was erected.\n\nMuhammad Shah (AD 1457-1458)\n\nMuhammad Shah (AD 1457-1458) acknowledged Bahlol Lodi’s authority over Shamsabad and established peace. Unfortunately, his brother Hussain Shah, who had declared himself the Sultan of Jaunpur, assassinated him.\n\nHussain Shah Sharqi (AD 1458-1505)\n\nHussain Shah Sharqi (AD 1458-1505), adopting the name Gandharva, significantly contributed to the development of the Khayal style of Hindustani classical music. He composed various ragas, including Jaunpuri basant, Hussaini or Jaunpuri-safari (now known as Jaunpuri), Malhar-Syama, Bhopal-Syarma, and Gaur-Syama.\n\nAfter Hussain Shah’s demise and Sikander Lodi, who succeeded Bahlol Lodi, annexed Jaunpur, the Sharqi Dynasty met its ultimate downfall.\n\nBengal\n\nBengal witnessed the rule of two formidable dynasties – Ilyas Shahi (1342-1481) and Hussain Shahi (1494-1538).\n\nThe capitals of Bengal, Pandua, and Gaur were embellished with grand structures.\n\nBengali flourished as a regional language, while Persian retained its status as the language of administration.\n\nIlyas Shahi Dynasty\n\nThe inception of the Ilyas Shahi Dynasty was marked by Ilyas Shah (1342-1357), originally a noble of Muhammad Tughlaq, serving in Delhi.\n\nIlyas Shah ascended as a potent ruler, adopting the title of Sikandar-i Sani.\n\nHe swiftly captured Tirhut (1339-40), Lakhnauti (1342), and Sonargaon (1353), extending his influence to Banaras, Gorakhpur, and Bahraich. In AD 1357, he conquered Kamrup.\n\nInitiating expeditions to Nepal (1350-51) and Jajnagar, Ilyas Shah prompted Sultan Firuz Shah Tughlaq to personally intervene, leading to a year-long resolution (1353-54).\n\nGhiyasuddin Azam (AD 1390-1411)\n\nGhiyasuddin Azam Shah, a renowned Sultan of the Ilyas Shah Dynasty, earned acclaim for his just governance.\n\nMaintaining amicable ties with China, Ghiyasuddin Azam Shah played a crucial role in fostering Bengal’s export trade. The port of Chittagong emerged as a significant trade hub for commerce with China.\n\nHussain Shahi Dynasty\n\nIn AD 1493, Alauddin Hussain Shah (1493-1519) ascended to power, establishing the foundation of the Hussain Shahi Dynasty. He not only quelled the Abyssinian slaves but also pursued an assertive expansionist policy.\n\nIn AD 1495, Hussain Shah faced the wrath of Sultan Sikandar Lodi, who was displeased because Hussain Shah had provided shelter to the Sultan of Jaunpur, Hussain Shah.\n\nNasir-ud-din Nasrat Shah (AD 1518-1533)\n\nNasir-ud-din Nasrat Shah, son of Alauddin Hussain Shah, married Ibrahim Lodi’s daughter and offered refuge to Afghan Lords. He engaged in negotiations with Babur to safeguard Bengal from a potential Mughal Invasion.\n\nHe continued his father’s strategy of territorial expansion.\n\nHowever, in AD 1526, he confronted Mughal dominance and suffered defeat at the hands of the Ahom Kingdom.\n\nGhiyas-ud-din Mahmud Shah (AD 1533-1538)\n\nThe final Sultan of the Hussain Shahi Dynasty, Ghiyas-ud-din Mahmud Shah, ruled from Sonargaon.\n\nSubsequently, Sher Shah Suri, one of the most capable Suri rulers, took control of Bengal, even expelling the Mughal ruler Humayun from Delhi.\n\nOrissa (Odisha)\n\nDuring the Delhi Sultanate period, the Ganga Dynasty governed Orissa and its adjoining regions, facing persistent attempts by the Delhi Sultanate to annex Bengal.\n\nIn AD 1340, Firuz Shah Tughlaq launched an attack on Orissa, leading to the destruction of the Jagannath Temple of Puri under the rule of King Bhanudeva III of the Ganga Dynasty.\n\nGanga Dynasty\n\nBetween the 11th and 15th centuries, the Chodagangas, known as the Eastern Ganga Dynasty, ruled over Kalinga, encompassing present-day Odisha, parts of West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, and Andhra Pradesh, with Kalinganagara as their capital.\n\nAnantavarman Chodagangadeva (AD 1076-1150) founded the dynasty and constructed the renowned Jagannath Temple in Puri, Odisha.\n\nGajapati Dynasty\n\nThe Hindu Gajapati Dynasty held sway over Kalinga (Orissa), a significant portion of Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, and the Eastern and Central regions of Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand from AD 1435 to 1541.\n\nKapilendra Deva established the Gajapati Dynasty in 1434 following the decline of the Eastern Ganga dynasty. Under Kapilendra Deva, the Gajapatis expanded their dominion from the lower Ganga in the North to the Kaveri in the South.\n\nAround AD 1450, he appointed his son Hamvira Deva as the Governor of Kondavidu and Rajahmundry. Hamvira Deva conquered Hampi, the Vijayanagara capital, and compelled its ruler, Mallikarjuna Raya, to pay taxes.\n\nIn AD 1512, Krishnadevaraya of the Vijayanagara Dynasty invaded Kalinga, resulting in the defeat of the Gajapati Kingdom’s army.\n\nThe Gajapati rule represented a glorious period in Odisha’s history. The Gajapati rulers played a key role in the construction of the famous Jagannath Temple and the Sun Temple (Konark).\n\nThe Bhakti Movement, under Chaitanya, gained momentum during the Gajapati rule.\n\nHowever, by the early 16th century, Vijayanagara and Golconda had seized significant portions of the Southern empire, leading to the replacement of the Gajapati Dynasty by the Bhoi Dynasty.\n\nAssam\n\nDuring that period, Assam witnessed conflicts between two rival factions known as the Lingdors. The Kamata Kingdom (Kamrup) was situated in the West, while the Ahom Kingdom was positioned in the East.\n\nSuhungmung (Svarga Narayana), revered as the greatest Ahom ruler, not only thwarted the Muslim invasion but also expanded his kingdom in all directions.\n\nAhom Kingdom\n\nSukaphaa, a Tai prince from Mong Mao (present-day Yunnan province, China), laid the foundation for the Ahom Kingdom in the 13th century.\n\nOver the centuries, the kingdom transformed Hinduism, fostering a diverse and multi-ethnic culture.\n\nThe Ahoms grew their territory between 1497 and 1539 under Suhungmung. During this time, a significant figure named Sankardev (1449-1568) lived in Assam. He played a key role in spreading Vaishnavism, a religious belief, in Assam. Sankardev and his followers established monasteries called Sattras, where the Sattriya dance form originated.\n\nOther Regional Kingdoms\n\nMarwar Rao Chunda ruled from AD 1401 to 1421, and he was succeeded by Jodlia. Jodha, who built the Jodhpur Fort, followed him.\n\nBika, one of the sons of Jodha, founded Bikaner in AD 1465, which was ruled by the Malwa dynasty.\n\nAmber or Amer Dullah Rao was the founder of the Kachhawaha Dynasty, which ruled Amber or Amer during this period. The most famous ruler of this dynasty was Hammir Deva.\n\nPrelims Facts\n\nWhich ruler is known to have established Bagh-e-Firdaus and had ‘Udayaraj’ as his court poet? – Mahmud Begada [UPPSC (Pre) 2011]\n\nWho was the ruler who established the independent state in Gujarat? – Zafar Khan [UPPSC (Pre) 2010]\n\nWhich great musician was patronized by Bahadur Shah, the ruler of Gujarat? – Udayaraj [UPPSC (Pre) 2003]\n\n‘Mandu victory was the key to the Southern conquest’ Who said this? – Amir Khusrau [MPPSC (Pre) 2020]\n\nWhich ruler of Mewar got the Kirti Stambha built? – Rana Kumbha [UKPSC (Pre) 2011]\n\nWhich ruler built the Jahaz Mahal located in Mandu? – Ghiyas-ud-din Khalji IMPPSC (Pre) 2017]\n\nThe striking feature of Jama Masjid in Kashmir was completed by – Zain-ul-Abidin [IAS (Pre) 1999]\n\nThe city of Jaunpur was established in the memory of – Muhammad-bin-Tughlaq [UPPSC (Pre) 2003, UPPSC (Mains) 2004]\n\nWhich Shargi ruler is considered to be the father of the Jaunpur style? – Ibrahim Shah Sharqi /BPSC (Pre) 2002)\n\nDuring the reign of which Shargi ruler, Jaunpur was submerged into Delhi Sultanate? – Hussain Shah Sharqi [UPPSC (Pre) 2003)\n\nWhich ruler of Bengal declared himself independent during the reign of Muhammad bin Tughlaq? – Alauddin Ali Shah [UPPSC (Pre) 2006)\n\nWhich title did Alauddin Hussain Shah, the ruler of Bengal assume? – Khalifatullah [BPSC (Pre) 2008|\n\nDuring the reign of which ruler of Kashmir, did Timur invade India? – Sikandar [UPPSC (Pre) 2008)\n\nWhich ruler established the Turkish Power in Bengal? – Bakhtiyar Khilji [UPPSC (Pre) 2004\n\nDuring the reign of which ruler of Bengal, the Portuguese first entered in Bengal? – Nusrat Shah (UPPSC (Prel) 2010\n\nWhich title did Kapilendra, the founder of the Suryavanshi Gajapati dynasty adopt? – Gaudeshroara [UKPSC (Per) 2004\n\nUPSC NCERT Practice Questions\n\n1.
