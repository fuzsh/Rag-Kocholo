        "text": "Mahmud Muzaffar Shah\n\nMalaysian sultan\n\nMahmud Muzaffar Shah (born 1823, Trengganu, Riau—died July 1864, Pahang) was the last sultan of Riau (Riouw) and Lingga (archipelagoes south of Singapore), whose deposition cleared the way for Dutch colonial control.\n\nMahmud was crowned sultan in 1834, and, when the regency of his father ended in 1841, he resolved to restore the power wielded by his predecessors. He had the tacit support of the east coast Malay states to the north and particularly of Sultan Baginda Omar of Trengganu. Mahmud’s claim to the throne of the Malay state of Pahang seemed threatening to the Dutch, however, and they deposed him in October 1857. Mahmud retained immense prestige among east coast Malays, and his efforts to win Malay and Thai support for his Pahang claim, although fruitless, provided occasions for further Dutch and British involvement in Malay affairs.\n\nThis article was most recently revised and updated by Encyclopaedia Britannica."
