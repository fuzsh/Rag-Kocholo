        "text": "I just saw someone ask on quora why there has never been a queen in Malaysia. The answers were pathetic, pointing out to our current Raja Permasuri Agong and said \"Look, we do have a queen\" when in fact its clear that's not what the question meant.\n\nNow I know the answer to this. It's because the sultans from past to present have been able to successfully produce a male heir.\n\nBut it got me wondering. Suppose a sultan failed to produce a male heir, will the eldest daughter be allowed to take the throne like Queen Elizabeth II and her husband be the consort? Or will she be married off and her husband sit the throne despite him not being of royal lineage? How does our monarchy work really? What does the islamic laws say about this?"
