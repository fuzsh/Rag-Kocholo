        "text": "Muzaffar Shah I, born Zafar Khan, was the founder of the Muzaffarid dynasty in Medieval India, reigning over the Gujarat Sultanate from 1391 to 1403 and again from 1404 to 1411. He was appointed the governor of Gujarat by Tughluq dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate and later declared the independence of the Gujarat Sultanate while there was chaos in Delhi following Timur's invasion. He was deposed by his ambitious son Tatar Khan but he regained the throne shortly after, when he died. Zafar Khan's father was Wajīh-al-Mulk, a noble in the court of the Sultan of Delhi, Firuz Shah Tughlaq. The dynasty was founded by Zafar Khan. There are multiple theories of origin of Muzaffar Shah. One theory says that Wajih-ul-Mulk and his brother were influential Chaudharis who were agriculturists by profession but could also muster thousands of fighting men on their call. Some scholars state he was a Khatri from Punjab, on the basis of the work Mirat-i-Sikandari by Shaikh Sikandar Ibn Muhammad who was a contemporary of Gujarat Sultans while others state he was a Rajput. According to Misra, Tank were Khatris who were agrarian people belonging to South Punjab. Misra states that Sikandar vaguely knew the Tanks were vintners but claimed they were of \"noble and high spirit\". Sikandar states that originally the Tanks and Khatris were brothers, but the former had taken a liking to drinking alcohol and were expelled and thus called \"Tank\". Misra states that Sikandar does not mention that the Tanks were Rajputs and is of the opinion that probably the Tanks were considered as Rajputs by virtue of their association with Khatris and claimed descent from Kṣatriyas and did not belong to any major houses of Rajputs. But as per writer Aparna Kapadia, the two brothers Saharan and Sadhu who are regarded as ancestors to Zafar Khan, founder of the dynasty were probably Tank Rajputs from Thanesar in modern-day Haryana. Writer Burton Stein mentions the dynasty's ruler Ahmad Shah I as a \"converted Rajput\" who as governor had made the province ( till then part of Delhi Sultanate) an independent sultanate in 1411."
