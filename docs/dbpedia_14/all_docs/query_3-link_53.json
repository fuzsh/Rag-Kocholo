This is relevant for the special Kurultai and Chrysanthemum Throne succession laws.\n\n- You should no longer see references to a \"Shaguang TA\" that obviously does not exist.\n\n- DW events no longer refer to a [Blank] some events where Tianxia DW societies are involved.\n\n- Reduced the number of contractions used in localization to a more sensible amount.\n\n- Vassals of Japanese Imperial rulers are now correctly forbidden from kingdom creation if there *isn't* a Permanent Regent, not when there *is* a Permanent Regent.\n\n- Fixed an issue where the handover of the Sixteen Prefectures also resulted in land elsewhere being handed over.\n\n- Chinese tributaries that fail to fight off China after refusing a generous offer to increase their tributary tier no longer get to avoid the tier increase by virtue of technically not being a tributary during the war.\n\n- The WotRS mission to get a new student should now complete properly regardless of how it is achieved, and you should now know if it has been completed.\n\n- It is now possible to complete the WotRS mission to construct a castle (was previously impossible).\n\nBalance:\n\n- Slightly reduced Mandate of Heaven bias towards Average\n\n- All stats (but not stat-granting traits) are now worth equally much when calculating the MoH.\n\n- The MoH reward now scales linearly when it comes to stats.\n\n- The MoH reward from stats is now always positive (assuming at least one stat is non-zero).\n\n- Various Iron Century pretender empires have been changed to start with more vassal-friendly laws (those with Average or better MoH will still be fairly restrictive).\n\n- Chinese Imperial emperors now value special CBs to (re)conquer China more highly.\n\n- Pretender emperors no longer think that tributaries are awesome.\n\n- The EoC is now less interested in tributary wars if there's a pretender emperor holding land in China.\n\n- The Tenno no longer cares for tributaries (given the lack of other CBs he tended to spam them previously).\n\n- Added a small impassable mountain range in northern China, which should keep a settling Liao from going after Dingnan/Xia without first heading south.\n\n- Mercs should no longer get tons of influence or currency in the WotRS.\n\n- Being Japanese Imperial now gives you the same boost to WotRS influence as you'd get from Japanese Feudal.\n\n- AI Ryukyuan/Reformed Ryukyuans are now a bit more reluctant to join the WotRS.\n\n- Lowered random Wako culture spread rate significantly.\n\n- Chinese Imperial and Confucian Bureaucracy rulers can now appoint their heir to any council position and/or as their Designated Regent regardless of said heir's stats.\n\n- The Permanent Regent will no longer step aside if you ask nicely and they're fully empowered.\n\n- The Permanent Regent is now much less eager to step aside if you ask nicely and they've been given additional powers.\n\n- The Permanent Regent is now much less eager to step aside if you ask nicely and the Regency Loyalists are powerful.\n\n- The Permanent Regent is now less eager to step aside if they've got a Regency bloodline.\n\n- Being friends/lovers or otherwise close to the Permanent Regent is no longer guaranteed to make them step aside if they have certain traits (but it still helps a lot).\n\n- Proselytizing in foreign realms and sponsoring of Mass Conversions is now blocked for the governments that don't care about religion (Chinese Imperial, Confucian Bureaucracy, Japanese Imperial, Japanese Feudal).\n\n- Shinto rulers can now proselytize in foreign realms and sponsor Mass Conversions if they do not have any of the governments listed above and would be eligible under normal rules.\n\n- Made plenty of combat_rating-related checks a bit easier.\n\n- Made the WotRS bloodline quest more likely to fire.\n\n- Students are now more likely to get a PCS increase in several events that can fire during WotRS mentoring.\n\n- The duchy of Chaiya is now de jure part of the Kingdom of Malaya (and thus also the Empire of Nusantara).\n\n- The province of Kawthaung now extends a bit further south.\n\nMisc:\n\n- Commented out various achievement-related on_actions since you can't get achievements and they thus are a waste of performance.\n\nOld saves can probably be continued, but you should likely clear the graphics cache (~\\Documents\\Paradox Interactive\\Crusader Kings II\\Tianxia\\gfx\\flags) due to some de jure tweaks possibly messing up flags, and you should be aware that some issues will persist in old saves as not every issue can be fixed retroactively.\n\nAttachments\n\nOpen Beta 0.1.1 [OSIE].zip\n\nDev diary 43 - What's next?\n\nWith the 0.1.1 bugfix patch out of the way (and hopefully no hotfix-worthy issues being discovered as part of that version) work can begin on the next major version of Tianxia: Open Beta 0.2.0.\n\nAs you might know, 0.1.0 was focused on getting the first four start dates (Charlemagne, The Old Gods, Iron Century, and Stamford Bridge) in decent shape (plus organizing and cleaning up the history files in general) and adding flavour and mechanics in/for China and Japan, and with the start dates done (barring any inaccuracies that are discovered and possibly the addition of additional placeholder characters if we decide to break up realms/subrealms in the future) and both China and Japan getting a good amount of flavour and mechanics we are rather obviously going to be looking at something else with the next version.\n\nThe dates of interest:\n\nAs things currently stand, the plan for 0.2.0 is to move top liege history forward to 1127.4.20 and add a new bookmark there.\n\nThe political situation in the west, which many of you might not have seen before.\n\nWhy this date? Well, a certain someone would just have been enthroned as a puppet of (Jurchen) Jin, which is a noteworthy event in the Far East, and the date is both far enough away from Stamford Bridge that there are some noticeable changes, close enough to Stamford Bridge to not be a massive undertaking, and far enough from... other things that would be sensible dates for later versions (thus making them sane undertakings).\n\nA certain someone, not yet landed.\n\nEven though the timeline only will be moved forward about sixty years there's still a lot of new dates to consider, and though our history files are in decent shape in some places there is quite a bit of work to do just to reach the chosen date.\n\nOh, look; it's our old \"friend\", the roughly China-shaped hole (with a bit less hole this time)!\n\nFurthermore, even though it is possible to start at any date between 1065.9.15 (Stamford Bridge) and 1127.4.20 (or technically 1337.1.1) it is not going to be remotely feasible to test particularly many dates. Since the bookmarks are likely to get more attention than most dates, those dates are what we will be testing, and with a pretty big gap between the Alexiad and 1127.4.20 we could conceivably add (and test) another new bookmark there. Suggestions would be welcome; preferably dates that a) are \"Big dates\" (in some sense) and b) not too close to either of the other dates being tested. Note that we will not be adjusting vanilla (with the possible exception of immediately adjacent to stuff we have added) to improve added bookmarks and that \"story\" events (as in the case of e.g. Charlemagne) aren't on the table, so suggestions relying on either of those things would be rather useless.\n\nThe region of Interest:\n\nAs previously mentioned, the plan is to ensure that top liege history is correct (in areas where we can find sources; areas full of placeholders will not necessarily be accurate) everywhere up to 1127.4.20. In addition to this, we will also (to the extent it is possible) be adding vassals and interesting characters in the areas not covered in red in the image below up until 1337 (and also possibly backwards in time, depending on what we can find), not including China and Manchuria except when they are under (Jurchen) Jin (so not e.g. Yuan China/Manchuria).\n\nManchuria, Korea, Hokkaido (and nearby islands), and parts of China.\n\nWhen it comes to flavour, the focus is the following: Korea, the Muist religion, Korean Buddhism (flavour stuff only; not a unique religion/branch), the Ainu religion, and possibly Jurchen flavour that does not translate to \"Flavour for China/Chinese Imperial/Confucian Bureaucracy in general\" or \"General Tengri flavour\" (which might mean this doesn't end up being particularly extensive). Mechanics will also be primarily related to these things.\n\nGeneral suggestions regarding flavour related to the above would be welcome. In particular, thoughts about just what kind of (non-DW/-SRS) society would be a good idea for the Ainu religion would be of interest (there are already plans for the Muists); the choices are a) a Warrior Lodge (relatively straightforward to add), b) access to the Warriors of the Rising Sun (relatively straightforward to add, but feels like a worse fit than a Warrior Lodge), or c) something completely new (we have no ideas as to what this could be, and it would be more work than the other options).\n\nSome anticipated questions and answers:\n\nQ: \"Why not another 'end' date in 0.2.0?\"\n\nA: The main reasons were given previously, and though there were a few other dates nearby that might have been good choices (e.g. the fall of Bianjing on 1127.1.9) it ultimately felt like the most interesting option. Additionally, we need to work chronologically, so while there are Big Things happening later in history we can't skip ahead to them.\n\nQ: \"Why only characters in some places?\"/\"Why add characters up to 1337 where you are adding them?\"\n\nA: Adding characters takes quite some time unless you are adding placeholders, and as it often is possible (and sensible) to add entire dynasties at a time and you often find interesting characters belonging to other dynasties in the same region while looking up characters in that region, which means that focusing on one region at a time works better than running around trying to work on everything and that you quite possibly will find the information you need for later (and earlier) dates in the same region while doing work on certain dates, making it sensible to add them right away.\n\nQ: \"What does this approach to history mean when it comes to supported dates in 0.2.0?\"\n\nA: The areas that are being focused on will (assuming it is possible to find the relevant information) probably be more complete when looking at characters that aren't the top liege than many other (non-vanilla) areas will be, and missing vassals/etc. in other areas will probably not be addressed right away even if such issues are reported, but the plan is for all dates up to the \"end\" date to be supported as far as \"The game should work\" goes (though, as mentioned, we will only be able to test a few dates ourselves and will opt for the bookmarks).\n\nQ: \"Why these regions in 0.2.0?\"\n\nA: We already have some WIP content for Korea, so it makes sense to get that done sooner rather than later. As for the other regions, they're relevant to the \"end\" date and relatively close together, and as it is quite possible that interesting flavour ideas might come up as part of historical research or that interesting historical people might become known as part of flavour research it makes sense to go with the same regions for the flavour and the history.\n\nQ: \"Why not also do flavour/mechanics for X in 0.2.0?\"\n\nA: As noted above it makes sense to do the flavour related to an area (or flavour mainly relevant in a certain area, e.g. a local religion) when doing the history there, and doing the history and flavour elsewhere as part of 0.2.0 would increase the scope and thus the time needed to complete it.\n\nQ: \"Does this mean there will be no flavour/mechanics in 0.2.0 for non-focus areas?\"\n\nA: There might be things added elsewhere, but chances are any additions elsewhere will be on the small side, much like how there were a few small things in 0.1.0 (e.g. crusader traits, holy orders, and two historical Great Works) that weren't particularly related to its focus areas.\n\nQ: \"Why not do more history and less flavour/less history and more flavour?\"\n\nA: In addition to the previously mentioned point about research of one of the two possibly being relevant as far as the other goes, this is a compromise between doing things of interest to people that only/mainly want to start in early start dates (adding flavour they might experience, though not necessarily in their preferred region) and doing things of interest to the people that want to play in later dates (moving history forward, though not necessarily to their preferred time period).\n\nQ: \"Is this plan the final plan for 0.2.0?\"\n\nA: There might be some changes, but you shouldn't expect something massive like \"Let's do SEAsia before/in addition to all that stuff in the dev diary!\".\n\nQ: \"Is 0.2.0 the final version?\"/\"Is 1127.4.20 the last date you will support?\"\n\nA: The plan is to continue well past the next version and all the way to 1337.1.1 as far as start dates go (and 1453.1.1 as far as playtime goes), and there are quite a few ideas when it comes to things to add beyond just \"More dates!\".\n\nQ: \"When will 0.2.0 be out?\"\n\nA: When it is ready. It is far too soon to say anything specific, but since the historical work hopefully will be significantly less extensive than it was for 0.1.0 the wait will hopefully be shorter than the wait for 0.1.0 was.\n\nAre the chinese temple names hard-coded? The names with zu(forefather) are only given to the dynasty's founder and the rest are zong(ancestor) which is quite incorrect because the third emperor of ming was known as chengzu(Zhu Di) in china,it would be really nice if we could add one era policy which make the emperor known by their era names posthumously like hongwu,Kangxi,and Qianlong.Also I want to suggest a new government type for korea and vietnam which give them a temple name upon their death by using similar way to japan imperial system.I want to ask several questions.\n\n1.Is it possible to add the rest of manchuria to the game?\n\n2.Is it possible to remove the regnal numbers on emperor of china?for example zhezong ii which is doesn't make sense since chinese never use one.\n\n3.Are the emperor of china known by their regnal/era names when they're live(like the popes) or people just started called them by their era or temple names only when they're already dead? For example do people call the kangxi emperor \"kangxi\" during his lifetime?\n\n4.And why do the founder of dynasty referred by their personal name in china? In chinese wikipedia zhu yuanzhang(ming taizu/hongwu emperor) only referred to as zhu yuanzhang in his wikipedia page while the rest of his descendants don't.\n\nFor the last two questions I'm really confused because I already tried to find the answers elsewhere but i didn't find the answers sorry for asking a lot question tho.\n\n- The temple name assignment logic regarding -zu/-zong (or, rather, which names to give to dynasty founders and which names to give to the rest) is copied from vanilla aside from some measures taken to ensure that historical emperors/pretenders get their historical temple names (assuming it is an actual temple name; for example, Emperor Mo of Xia won't get \"Mo\" as a temple name if you start when he is alive), some extra temple names for historical emperors/pretender being considered where relevant, and them being given on death rather than on assumption of the throne. It would be possible to change things, but it'd not be the historically correct approach before Ming, and though the Hongwu Emperor was born before the last possible start date it is not really relevant to handle a possible exception for Ming at this point (and as they're not going to be on the map in any playable date it is possible it is deemed unnecessary down the line too).\n\n- As far as I'm aware, it isn't really customary to refer to pre-Ming emperors by an era; they're usually known as \"Emperor Temple Name of Dynasty\" (e.g. \"Emperor Taizu of Song\"), or non-Chinese names for Yuan emperors (e.g. \"Kublai Khan\" instead of \"Emperor Shizu of Yuan\"). Due to the way names work in the game, using era names would also mean overriding the temple name system, which would be messy and isn't relevant yet.\n\n- A new government type just to handle temple names isn't happening; that's not enough justification for a separate government type. Korea (or, more accurately, Silla and Goryeo) and Vietnam (more accurately, Annam/Dai Viet) are also modelled as king-tier rulers in Tianxia due to often playing China's games (Japan stopped playing those games pretty early on, and, well, the structure of their government became a completely different mess, so they need to be handled differently), which would cause issues with separate governments for them as we'd need to consider issues like \"What is they become a vassal?\" (and, at the very least in the case of Vietnam, there'd be gameplay issues arising from giving them their emperor title as Vietnam would de jure war Champa into oblivion). Skipping the government and just giving temple names to king+ Korean/Viet rulers with relevant religions that are independent might be an option, but we'd need to consider how to resolve the obvious conflict that would arise if they are Chinese Imperial and possibly also other issues, so it might be prudent not to do it or at least to delay it to consider the implementation and how to solve various issues (and just what those issues are) more carefully.\n\n- Adding the rest of Manchuria (most of it is already in...) would require expanding the map further, and creating a new map is a massive undertaking and require extensive graphical skills. Also, finding sensible holding names (and we need seven per province, thanks to Prosperity) is likely to be hard, seeing as going with Russian names wouldn't make sense in the CK2 era. It is extremely unlikely to happen.\n\n- I don't believe it is possible to remove regnal numbers without replacing the title every time a new dynasty takes over a Chinese Imperial empire, and doing that would create a bunch of issues (for one thing, the assumption that the Grace target holds e_china would no longer be valid, meaning we'd need to do something more complicated in many places). It's probably easiest to pretend they're not there.\n\n- I can't read Chinese characters, so even if I had a historical account written during someone's reign in front of me it would be impossible for me to tell what was written there without looking up the meaning of each character (and figuring out what is and isn't a name), and Chinese naming practices are a bit complicated in general (as people often took new names (e.g. to avoid naming taboos), had courtesy names, and so on), so I'm not sure. However, I'd assume you fairly easily could get around referring to the current emperor by name in many situations by referring to him with a title (e.g. \"In the X day of the Y month of the Z year of [current era; plenty of emperors had several eras and some eras continued after a new emperor took the throne], the Son of Heaven proclaimed [stuff]\") and likely very little confusion arising as to which emperor you were referring to (and if you needed to know his name for some reason, e.g. to avoid naming taboos, there would presumably be ways to discover it if you didn't already know it).\n\nDev diary 44 - Bloodlines and other things\n\nThe next update is still quite far off, but enough work has been done to make a dev diary feasible.

Given that the event chain takes some time to complete, the proper date will possibly be at some point during the celebration.\n\nVarious activities tend to take place during the Chuseok, such as Ganggangsullae dancing (for women), Juldarigi tug-of-war, and Ssireum wrestling, in addition to some assorted minor stuff (such as tumbling opportunities, eating traditional food, tumbling opportunities, opportunities to befriend or rival other guests, and tumbling opportunities). Unlike the LNY and the Hanami, you're at no risk of your capital (or part of it) catching on fire due to various things going wrong, but some things might still not go the way you'd prefer.\n\nMore Korean Bloodlines:\n\nThere are three additional bloodlines in Korea at the moment; one for the Gimhae Gim (or Kim) clan (specifically for Suro) that ruled the Gaya Confederacy (they've also got a titular kingdom title in the history files, which gives them a fairly good amount of dynastic prestige), one for Dongmyeong (or Dongmyeongseongwang; we use the shorter name) of Goguryeo (which various kings of Baekje belong to as well), and another for one of his sons, Onjo of Baekje.\n\nThe Gaya bloodline is around until the end of the game (the Gimhae Gim clan is currently not landed in 936 or later, but they will be landed if it turns out that they should be or if there aren't any better candidates), while I believe the other two die out (in the male line) prior to 867 (though once we get around to adding further Japanese clans (probably not in 0.2.0) they might be around a while longer)\n\nThe bloodlines currently lack localization and the benefits are non-final, but this is what they currently look like:\n\nIt's possible a Goguryeo-specific bloodline for Yuri will be added as well (if so, it'll probably not be terribly powerful as it stacks with Dongmyeong's bloodline, much like in the case of Onjo's bloodline) or that the one for Onjo will be removed prior to release, since it might be overkill to have that many bloodlines. We've previously added bloodlines for Go of Balhae (only around in 769 as the relevant branch of the dynasty goes extinct in the male line prior to 867) and Taejo of Goryeo (given when he wins his starting war against Hubaekje in 936 and historically in 1066 and later), and there will be at least one (and possibly three; Bak/Pak, Seok, and Gim/Kim) bloodlines added for the kings of Silla (I don't remember how long they're around, but at least one of the relevant clans is around in 936 and they're likely to be used as placeholder vassals if no better candidates can be found if they're around later on) when those characters are double-checked for possible improvements.\n\nOther things:\n\nThere have been a few other minor additions/improvements/fixes, including but not limited to:\n\n- Adjusting the Goryeo and Hubaekje borders in the IC start and landing O Daryeon (father of the late Queen Janghwa, the mother of Wang Mu/Hyejong of Goryeo in Naju) in Naju.\n\n- Adding the missing/fixing the broken (in vanilla, even!) Qarmatian SRS.\n\n- Improving the ruler history of Tamna (Jeju).\n\n- Fixing some issues with how a Poor or Lost Mandate rating interacted with factions (making things more dangerous).\n\nThat's all for today. It's possible that there won't be another dev diary before some point in January (or possibly February, though it'll hopefully not be that long) since there aren't very many days left in the year and the immediate plans involve assorted things that might not make for good dev diary content, but some larger and hopefully more exciting things should hopefully be possible to show off fairly early next year.\n\nAlso blood lines are simply modifiers add some more flavor instead like events and factions. When I play the emperor of china I want to have people request boons etc. I Want flavor for these things and events for all of them.You should also add unique factions and plots. to the game. Their should also be a cb to seize the imperial madate or a faction or a plot. Add some flavor to countries and events for leaders. And maybe make a mod called imperial court societies compatible with this mod because they would work so well together. Thats basically what I think most would like to see and would make this mod amaing and not simple modifiers that add no immersion or depth to the mod.\n\nThese are suggestions that I think you should take. I think most players of this mod would enjoy them.\n\nIn order:\n\n- Most vanilla bloodlines are simple modifiers. We intend to add more, seeing as they're pretty straightforward to add and are nice to have for important historical people, and though a few of those we've added and possibly some of those we'll add in the future will have special mechanics associated with them the majority will be effectively just modifiers due to there not always being interesting mechanics to add, due to vanilla consistency, and due to a desire not to make bloodlines insanely powerful (at least not unless they're hard to earn). If any new bloodline mechanics require events we'll add events, but we'll not add events just for the sake of adding events (i.e. we'll go for quality over quantity).\n\n- People can already request nearly all vanilla Boons plus a few extra (if you've got JD and don't disable the Grace system). Given that you'll possibly be spammed with those events over a campaign if you're playing as the EoC, moving away from the straightforward \"X asks for Y; do you accept/refuse?\" responses we've got doesn't really feel like it'd be great, and if it's to be done it'd be pretty low priority since a) the EoC's already got more stuff than most rulers in China (he's got access to pretty much everything others also get access to, plus some things for him or CI rulers alone), b) the current system is functional, and c) other areas of the mod need more attention. I'm also pretty sure the AI uses the system (I've tested it fairly extensively with log outputs), even though it'll use it a bit less frequently than in vanilla due to a combination of higher base costs for most Boons (since certain tributary types get a discount) and it checking the decisions less frequently for any given ruler (due to performance considerations).\n\n- We'll not add a CB to seize the Mandate of Heaven/China for other realms (for vassals, see below). The former is claimed when you become Chinese Imperial, and you also get a weak, inheritable claim on e_china when creating a pretender empire, which can be pressed against them if their Mandate rating is sub-Average, and using Imperial Marriage Boons you can get a claim on China for the children resulting from such a marriage. Any further CB would just enable blobbing to a massive degree, would be inconsistent with how you can deal with any other blob in the game (there's no \"Let's take over the Abbasids because that sounds fun!\" CB), and wouldn't be terribly accurate for the era; of the \"true\" dynasties that fell (Tang, Song, Yuan; Ming fell considerably later and won't be around in any start date), only Song being conquered by Yuan really fits the \"Foreign empire claims the Mandate and conquers the previous China\" (and it should be noted that they got started prior to claiming the Mandate), seeing as Tang fell to a coup (and generally fell apart) and Yuan fell to revolts (and technically survived as Northern Yuan), and the other relevant realms didn't really follow the pattern either, seeing as Later Liang, Later Tang, Later Han, and Later Zhou all fell to what effectively was vassal revolts, Later Jin was conquered by Liao (neither was the \"true\" China), Former Shu was conquered by Later Tang (neither was the \"true\" China), Wu was effectively couped, Min crumbled and was eaten by other FDaTK realms, Later Shu, Southern Han, Northern Han, and Southern Tang were conquered by Song (Song was the \"true\" China, and none of the others were), Liao was destroyed by (Jurchen) Jin and Song (Song was of course the \"true\" China, but neither of the others were), Western Liao/Qara-Khitai (beware their lack of honour) was destroyed by the Mongols (who weren't even pretenders at that point), they also destroyed Xi-Xia, Dong-Xia, and (Jurchen) Jin prior to Yuan being proclaimed, and assorted smaller pretenders (e.g. Yan and Qi) didn't defeat the \"true\" China.\n\n- It's unlikely we'll add new factions for China, and it's already possible (if a bit buggy in 0.1.1) to take over a Chinese Imperial empire from the inside using the Takeover faction (and a sub-Average Mandate also gives council members the ability to faction a bit more freely). Given that it requires Conclave we might add a special faction for it so that it works without Conclave too, but Tianxia as a whole generally is designed under the assumption that all major DLCs are active. Also, \"unique factions\" is terribly vague, and messing extensively with the internal mechanics of Chinese Imperial (or CI + Confucian Bureaucracy) isn't certain to be a good idea (and isn't likely to happen soon since that'd be relevant to do when working on China). As for other other areas of the map, there are a few special factions in Japan (related to the Regency and Shogunate mechanics there), but it's unlikely we'll add more as the relevant system already is a messy workaround that we need to be careful about having other things interact with, various Confucian Bureaucracy areas (Korea, Vietnam, etc.) need to be approached carefully as that government is around in both China and Japan, and other areas have governments similar to vanilla and will therefore behave as vanilla unless we see a very good reason (since vanilla's mechanics aren't entirely accurate everywhere in vanilla due to being large-scale abstractions we'll also permit a certain amount of inaccuracy) not to have them behave that way.\n\n- \"Unique plots\" is incredibly vague. It might be possible to do something with concrete ideas, however, as plots are a bit less likely to cause issues than factions, though we'll still have to be careful.\n\n- Assuming you mean \"Flavour for specific religions/culture-religion combos/areas\" where you suggest doing it for countries, that's happening, but we're doing it area-by-area instead of everywhere at the same time, and China/Chinese Buddhism/Taoism/Shenism is not going to be the focus anytime soon since they got quite a bit in 0.1.0 and the area isn't going to be the focus area anytime soon due to this and due to when it makes sense to revisit it. As mentioned in dev diary 43, the focus areas for 0.2.0 are Korea, pre-Mongol Manchuria, (Jurchen) Jin (excluding pretty much everything that'd be mechanics for China/Chinese Imperial/etc. in general), and Hokkaido, with mechanical flavour generally being concerned with those areas, and though plans after 0.2.0 aren't quite as detailed as plans for 0.2.0 the order in which further areas will be worked on is fairly unlikely to change since the currently planned order makes a lot of sense.\n\n- Not sure what flavour you're referring to for rulers. If you elaborate it's possible that some of the ideas could be considered further.\n\n- We're not going to make other mods compatible with Tianxia since that's a bunch of extra work (and also requires getting permission to create the mod, which isn't necessarily obtainable or might come with strings attached) and would divert attention from our own plans. Even with permission (and possibly someone volunteering to do the work) we're very unlikely to consider including other mods that mess with vanilla unless we feel the amount to which it messes with vanilla is extremely minor, we feel it only does it by messing with stuff in \"our\" part of the map (considered to be roughly everything added east of vanilla, plus Tibet and maybe areas subject to the Mongol Empire and its successors once we get that far), or it's a bugfix/minor consistency tweak/etc. As for the specific mod, while some of the society powers look a bit interesting for some of our realms I don't think we'll be implementing a similar society, partially because societies are rather messy to add and partially because some conflicts and issues can be foreseen with that approach. Maybe we'll consider adding something similar to the interesting bits in other ways, but it'd most likely not happen for several major versions.\n\nAlso yes it is possible to make an off map screen for an on map character a mod called Playable Theocracy Mod did that it's probably hard to do and not needed.\n\nIt's not supposed to be possible to tie an on-map title to an off-map power (I know an official answer to that effect was given around when JD was about to come out as I asked about it), so I'd expect the mod in question (and others doing something similar) to use a workaround, which might come with issues (speaking from both personal modding experience and Tianxia modding experience, I know how messy it can get when you're working around vanilla), and overhauling the relevant system isn't on the table anytime soon.\n\nAlso this might be op but because of the beucratic nature of china china should have many many soldiers maybe event spawned when in a war? Or different laws to control how much vassals give.\n\nEvent-spawned troops is likely to be OP, is likely to result in both the player and the AI shooting themselves in the proverbial foot by declaring wars that are winnable on paper (the AI's already bad at things like noticing that co-religionists can join holy wars), and has other issues besides, so I doubt we'll do anything with that, and I don't currently see us adding special levy laws for China/setting China to use the pre-Conclave laws. Chinese Imperial realms do however get levy size (and garrison size, and morale, and a bunch of other) boosts (or penalties) based on their Mandate rating, so if that's good they'll generally outnumber a realm with a similar size and similar tech and buildings by a bit. Additionally, Tang has two vassal merc companies (the Shence and Shenwu Guards; they weren't mercs historically but are modelled as such) and the top liege of Zhengzhou starts with the Shaolin Monks as vassals (available to hire if you're a Chinese Buddhist, usable against religious enemies), which also adds some troops, and China is generally pretty rich, which means it can support a large retinue (and they generally have a pretty high cap due to having a large and advanced realm) and can hire a bunch of mercs (they didn't really rely on mercs historically, but it certaily makes them stronger in the game), which can add to their military capabilities quite a bit.\n\nAlso, while China's government impacted how they raised troops, their population also impacted how many troops they could raise, so Chinese Imperial realms shouldn't get a ton of troops solely because of their government, and much like in the case of vanilla holding/county density doesn't evenly correspond to historical populations and levy sizes (even before martial scores and opinion modifiers are considered) don't necessarily correspond to historical army sizes, which means historical numbers aren't necessarily reasonable to expect (and, though the aforementioned huge population meant that China could have a very large army, it is not uncommon in general for historical accounts to exaggerate to either make a victory more impressive, a defeat less bad, or a ruler seem more powerful than they were) even if they still can get quite high compared to many other areas barring excessive blobbing in those areas.\n\nAlso i'm fine for forcing jade dragon I have etc but are you doing it for moral reasons or for paradox reasons most mods I know do it because it doesn't work without the dlc.\n\nIt's explicitly against the modding rules to mention/discuss/plan or otherwise market a mod on these forums or the Steam Workshop if content is made available without the corresponding game or DLC, so regardless of whether something would work without a DLC or not we're not going to entertain the notion of letting people access DLC content without the relevant DLC, and even when it's necessary to include something DLC-adjacent regardless of DLC status (e.g. China and various pretenders being Chinese Imperial (using a modified version of the government)) we'll not go around trying to create excuses to unlock more and more of a DLC (e.g. even though our Chinese Imperial isn't quite the same as vanilla's and even though the \"Adopt Chinese Imperial\" decision has been modified from vanilla in a few ways we'll not make it a non-JD decision since the decision for to ahistorically do that is very clearly something you get with JD and various historical cases either can be handled entirely in the history files or using very narrow and specific decisions).\n\nAlso, even if the rules allowed it (they really don't) it'd be rather poor form to do the equivalent of saying \"Hey, PDS devs, we like your work and will therefore make it less likely that other people will pay for it by providing it for everyone in our mod even if they've not paid for it!\".\n\n0.30 should focus on pure pure pure content like what I stated above.\n\nWe've already got somewhat detailed plans for 0.3.0 and quite a bit further beyond it (0.4.0, 0.5.0, 0.6.0, and tentatively 0.7.0, with any smaller patches in between being expected to be bugfix patches or hotfixes and thus not really adding anything new). These plans are not as detailed as the internal breakdown of 0.2.0 goals (some of which are broken down very far), but we've got something roughly similar to the bullet points listing the DLC features for a given DLC on the wiki, and they're similar to 0.2.0 in that they boil down to \"Move top-liege history forward to [big date], improve history up to the end date in [focus area somewhat realated to the big date], enhance [focus area] and [religions found in the focus area], possibly do [very minor things elsewhere]\"; the specifics for 0.3.0 will probably be revealed fairly soon after 0.2.0 (or the expected 0.2.1 bugfix patch) is out, and so forth, and though speculation is welcome the accuracy of any speculation is unlikely to be commented on.\n\nWhile some parts of the plans might change down the line, the overall approach is unlikely to change, and as we've got a lot of things planned already and several of those things are going to be a lot of work (e.g. filling in character and title history up to 1337.1.1 is no trivial matter) it's not particularly relevant to consider what the approach could be like at that point.\n\nIn order:\n\n- Most vanilla bloodlines are simple modifiers. We intend to add more, seeing as they're pretty straightforward to add and are nice to have for important historical people, and though a few of those we've added and possibly some of those we'll add in the future will have special mechanics associated with them the majority will be effectively just modifiers due to there not always being interesting mechanics to add, due to vanilla consistency, and due to a desire not to make bloodlines insanely powerful (at least not unless they're hard to earn). If any new bloodline mechanics require events we'll add events, but we'll not add events just for the sake of adding events (i.e. we'll go for quality over quantity).\n\n- People can already request nearly all vanilla Boons plus a few extra (if you've got JD and don't disable the Grace system). Given that you'll possibly be spammed with those events over a campaign if you're playing as the EoC, moving away from the straightforward \"X asks for Y; do you accept/refuse?\" responses we've got doesn't really feel like it'd be great, and if it's to be done it'd be pretty low priority since a) the EoC's already got more stuff than most rulers in China (he's got access to pretty much everything others also get access to, plus some things for him or CI rulers alone), b) the current system is functional, and c) other areas of the mod need more attention. I'm also pretty sure the AI uses the system (I've tested it fairly extensively with log outputs), even though it'll use it a bit less frequently than in vanilla due to a combination of higher base costs for most Boons (since certain tributary types get a discount) and it checking the decisions less frequently for any given ruler (due to performance considerations).\n\n- We'll not add a CB to seize the Mandate of Heaven/China for other realms (for vassals, see below). The former is claimed when you become Chinese Imperial, and you also get a weak, inheritable claim on e_china when creating a pretender empire, which can be pressed against them if their Mandate rating is sub-Average, and using Imperial Marriage Boons you can get a claim on China for the children resulting from such a marriage. Any further CB would just enable blobbing to a massive degree, would be inconsistent with how you can deal with any other blob in the game (there's no \"Let's take over the Abbasids because that sounds fun!\" CB), and wouldn't be terribly accurate for the era; of the \"true\" dynasties that fell (Tang, Song, Yuan; Ming fell considerably later and won't be around in any start date), only Song being conquered by Yuan really fits the \"Foreign empire claims the Mandate and conquers the previous China\" (and it should be noted that they got started prior to claiming the Mandate), seeing as Tang fell to a coup (and generally fell apart) and Yuan fell to revolts (and technically survived as Northern Yuan), and the other relevant realms didn't really follow the pattern either, seeing as Later Liang, Later Tang, Later Han, and Later Zhou all fell to what effectively was vassal revolts, Later Jin was conquered by Liao (neither was the \"true\" China), Former Shu was conquered by Later Tang (neither was the \"true\" China), Wu was effectively couped, Min crumbled and was eaten by other FDaTK realms, Later Shu, Southern Han, Northern Han, and Southern Tang were conquered by Song (Song was the \"true\" China, and none of the others were), Liao was destroyed by (Jurchen) Jin and Song (Song was of course the \"true\" China, but neither of the others were), Western Liao/Qara-Khitai (beware their lack of honour) was destroyed by the Mongols (who weren't even pretenders at that point), they also destroyed Xi-Xia, Dong-Xia, and (Jurchen) Jin prior to Yuan being proclaimed, and assorted smaller pretenders (e.g. Yan and Qi) didn't defeat the \"true\" China.\n\n- It's unlikely we'll add new factions for China, and it's already possible (if a bit buggy in 0.1.1) to take over a Chinese Imperial empire from the inside using the Takeover faction (and a sub-Average Mandate also gives council members the ability to faction a bit more freely). Given that it requires Conclave we might add a special faction for it so that it works without Conclave too, but Tianxia as a whole generally is designed under the assumption that all major DLCs are active. Also, \"unique factions\" is terribly vague, and messing extensively with the internal mechanics of Chinese Imperial (or CI + Confucian Bureaucracy) isn't certain to be a good idea (and isn't likely to happen soon since that'd be relevant to do when working on China). As for other other areas of the map, there are a few special factions in Japan (related to the Regency and Shogunate mechanics there), but it's unlikely we'll add more as the relevant system already is a messy workaround that we need to be careful about having other things interact with, various Confucian Bureaucracy areas (Korea, Vietnam, etc.) need to be approached carefully as that government is around in both China and Japan, and other areas have governments similar to vanilla and will therefore behave as vanilla unless we see a very good reason (since vanilla's mechanics aren't entirely accurate everywhere in vanilla due to being large-scale abstractions we'll also permit a certain amount of inaccuracy) not to have them behave that way.\n\n- \"Unique plots\" is incredibly vague. It might be possible to do something with concrete ideas, however, as plots are a bit less likely to cause issues than factions, though we'll still have to be careful.\n\n- Assuming you mean \"Flavour for specific religions/culture-religion combos/areas\" where you suggest doing it for countries, that's happening, but we're doing it area-by-area instead of everywhere at the same time, and China/Chinese Buddhism/Taoism/Shenism is not going to be the focus anytime soon since they got quite a bit in 0.1.0 and the area isn't going to be the focus area anytime soon due to this and due to when it makes sense to revisit it. As mentioned in dev diary 43, the focus areas for 0.2.0 are Korea, pre-Mongol Manchuria, (Jurchen) Jin (excluding pretty much everything that'd be mechanics for China/Chinese Imperial/etc. in general), and Hokkaido, with mechanical flavour generally being concerned with those areas, and though plans after 0.2.0 aren't quite as detailed as plans for 0.2.0 the order in which further areas will be worked on is fairly unlikely to change since the currently planned order makes a lot of sense.\n\n- Not sure what flavour you're referring to for rulers. If you elaborate it's possible that some of the ideas could be considered further.\n\n- We're not going to make other mods compatible with Tianxia since that's a bunch of extra work (and also requires getting permission to create the mod, which isn't necessarily obtainable or might come with strings attached) and would divert attention from our own plans. Even with permission (and possibly someone volunteering to do the work) we're very unlikely to consider including other mods that mess with vanilla unless we feel the amount to which it messes with vanilla is extremely minor, we feel it only does it by messing with stuff in \"our\" part of the map (considered to be roughly everything added east of vanilla, plus Tibet and maybe areas subject to the Mongol Empire and its successors once we get that far), or it's a bugfix/minor consistency tweak/etc. As for the specific mod, while some of the society powers look a bit interesting for some of our realms I don't think we'll be implementing a similar society, partially because societies are rather messy to add and partially because some conflicts and issues can be foreseen with that approach. Maybe we'll consider adding something similar to the interesting bits in other ways, but it'd most likely not happen for several major versions.\n\nIt's not supposed to be possible to tie an on-map title to an off-map power (I know an official answer to that effect was given around when JD was about to come out as I asked about it), so I'd expect the mod in question (and others doing something similar) to use a workaround, which might come with issues (speaking from both personal modding experience and Tianxia modding experience, I know how messy it can get when you're working around vanilla), and overhauling the relevant system isn't on the table anytime soon.\n\nEvent-spawned troops is likely to be OP, is likely to result in both the player and the AI shooting themselves in the proverbial foot by declaring wars that are winnable on paper (the AI's already bad at things like noticing that co-religionists can join holy wars), and has other issues besides, so I doubt we'll do anything with that, and I don't currently see us adding special levy laws for China/setting China to use the pre-Conclave laws.

This mod needs more flavor for the Empeor I'd like some events for the emperor and some event chains with boons and tributes.\n\n2. This mod needs a plot like Palace Coup I have a mod that does it well it's not op and usually fails and maybe you could only do it if mandate of heaven etc.\n\n3. Unique factions are possible and would be fun for china if the mandate of heaven is low their should be a mandate of heaven faction etc.\n\n4. I'm not usually on the fourms I'm usually on steam on steam things are more tight it's impossible to make a mod that uses dlc files etc not sure on the fourms but it's probably different because of how direct files are. Your the only mod I've seen that can acutually use dlc content and make it usuable for everyone.\n\n5. Just add more general plots and factions so people don't have to use other mods to do so that's all this mod needs other than more flavor for other regions besides china.\n\nOh and it comes with no issues what so ever https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1622945384 just look in the screenshots. You don't need to do it just saying it's possible.\n\nYou don't need to do new start dates I'm sure people want new features more just do a poll.\n\n\"true\" China or \"so-called\", \"false\" China, is conception of official historical books that presenting the ruler’s view of maintaining orthodoxy.\n\nI'm not going to challenge this. It could be off topic and gone astray.\n\nBut I would like to point out that in a game, especially a mod. There's no reason for a dev not to using a different setup, if it helps the gameplay, which means more historically accurate in CK2.\n\nTry to make Jin(Jurchen) the \"true\" China(e_china) after 1141 and make Song(1141–1279) a pretender. Maybe it works better.\n\nI'm aware that the legitimacy of various Chinese dynasties is a bit contentious (though Chinese history generally sides with Song), but we have to pick a side since we can't have it both ways, and even though the Treaty of Shaoxing was rather humiliating for Song they managed to keep most of their territory and even prevented (Jurchen) Jin from achieving their territorial aims (they initially wanted the border at the Yangtze), and from a gameplay standpoint it'd be mechanically inconsistent to treat that as (Jurchen) Jin being legitimized as the true China (and it'd also be messy to handle when scripting the historical war (which won't be modelled as a claim war for e_china)), which means considering Song legitimate seems like the better option.\n\nThings would also get weird and messy when (Jurchen) Jin is destroyed (since the Mongols did that and weren't yet Yuan at that point), particularly if that happens during the game and Song pretty much instantly recreates e_china (I believe they'd have the requisite territory for that at that point) and gets an Unquestioned Mandate despite the Mongols holding a decent chunk of China, and there'd be gameplay issues for Song if they weren't e_china until Yuan destroys them (for one thing, vassals would get uppity due to not being de jure vassals) and potential issues with (Jurchen) Jin doing better than they really should (based on history) if they were e_china and got various benefits from that (de jure claims, being the Grace target, etc.) that they'd otherwise not have.\n\nIn short, I don't really see us changing (Jurchen) Jin to e_china and Song to a pretender as it doesn't really confer any advantages and comes with a bunch of drawbacks that can be foreseen.\n\nWell actually you can...with some hacks or workaround as you said. One method is proven in a mod \"Playable Chinese Emperor\", while I also write a mod for onmap HRE emperor, for a EU4 style Holy Roman Empire screen. And it does work pretty well to a certain degree.(claim/urusp/inherit...)\n\nI still don't see us considering a rework anytime soon, and it isn't certain it's something that'd be right for Tianxia or that'd work with Tianxia (particularly as we've changed several things related to the Grace system and at least a few of the additions might not work as offmap decisions).\n\nYou know, even if a feature was \"inspired\" by a community mod and sold in a DLC, I still have to paid for this even I was the original author, hahaha.\n\nThe inspiration is sometimes pretty hard to judge, particularly as the modder and the devs could have arrived at something similar simply by looking at history, and I'm prepared to trust the devs when they say that they don't copy or take things from mods, which means they're scripting (and localizing, etc.) things on their own (which potentially could be similar to the mods script to an extent, seeing that there only are so many efficient ways to script something), so you're not paying for your own work but for their work. Also, the modding rules are pretty clear about mods and copyright claims (mods can't claim any copyright), the amount of any given DLC that's similar to a mod isn't necessarily significant, and, well, the devs can't be expected to be familiar with all mods or even all mechanics in more well-known mods, could potentially have decided to add (and potentially have gotten around to doing some of that work) prior to a mod having done something, and can't be expected to avoid doing something just because a mod got around to it before them.\n\nRegardless, the modding rules, how PDS does DLCs or operate when doing something similar to a mod, and the like is pretty off-topic, so we'd prefer not to have that discussion here.\n\n1. This mod needs more flavor for the Empeor I'd like some events for the emperor and some event chains with boons and tributes.\n\n2. This mod needs a plot like Palace Coup I have a mod that does it well it's not op and usually fails and maybe you could only do it if mandate of heaven etc.\n\n3. Unique factions are possible and would be fun for china if the mandate of heaven is low their should be a mandate of heaven faction etc.\n\n4. I'm not usually on the fourms I'm usually on steam on steam things are more tight it's impossible to make a mod that uses dlc files etc not sure on the fourms but it's probably different because of how direct files are. Your the only mod I've seen that can acutually use dlc content and make it usuable for everyone.\n\n5. Just add more general plots and factions so people don't have to use other mods to do so that's all this mod needs other than more flavor for other regions besides china.\n\n1. Event chains for Boons and Tributes are, again, likely to get annoying compared to straightforward events since you'll get them a lot if you're sitting on the Dragon Throne, and they're, again, not a priority. Also, the Emperor of China has a fairly good amount of content already, which means giving him more isn't a priority, and without concrete ideas that we like it's not certain it'll happen.\n\n2. Palace coups seem like a mechanic that'd not be particularly fun (even compared to other ways of being deposed, such as factions) to deal with as the ruler if they succeed, and that'd not be particularly fun to use if they generally fail, so it seems prudent not to have them.\n\n3. I already replied regarding factions, including there being ways to faction to overthrow the current dynasty if their Mandate isn't in a good spot.\n\n4. To my knowledge, we've not made any DLC content available to anyone without the relevant DLC. If you think we have, please let me know which content that would be so that it can be investigated.\n\n5. Any plots or factions that would mess with vanilla aren't happening since we're not messing with vanilla, any plots or factions found elsewhere might not be in the interest of the average player (or the Tianxia team) and wouldn't necessary be something we could add even if we wanted to, and we're not going to add plots or factions unless we've got actual concrete ideas for them that we believe would be good for Tianxia."
