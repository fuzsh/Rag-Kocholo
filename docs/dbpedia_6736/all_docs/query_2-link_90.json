        "text": "It’s not clear who invented the first microscope, but the Dutch spectacle maker Zacharias Janssen (b.1585) is credited with making one of the earliest compound microscopes (ones that used two lenses) around 1600. The earliest microscopes could magnify an object up to 20 or 30 times its normal size.\n\nIn the 1660s, another Dutchman, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723) made microscopes by grinding his own lenses. His simple microscopes were more like magnifying glasses, with only one lens.\n\nBut the high-quality, hand-ground lenses could magnify an object by up to 200 times.\n\nLeeuwenhoek observed animal and plant tissue, human sperm and blood cells, minerals, fossils, and many other things that had never been seen before on a microscopic scale.\n\nHe presented his findings to the Royal Society in London, where Robert Hooke was also making remarkable discoveries with a microscope.\n\nHooke published the ‘Micrographia’ (1665), an astonishing collection of copper-plate illustrations of objects he had observed with his own compound microscope.\n\nWhile looking at thin slices of cork, Hooke described what he saw as pores:\n\nMicroscopic aberrations\n\nMany researchers refused to use the early microscopes because they could not trust what they were seeing. Aberrations and impurities in the lenses caused distortions, which led to errors in observations.\n\nNot much changed in basic microscope design over the next 200 years, but improvements in lens manufacture (such as the use of purer glass) helped to solve problems like colour distortion and poor image resolution. Mirrors were added to compound microscopes to add more light and improve the image.\n\nBut at the start of the 1800s century, the pioneering French pathologist Xavier Bichat, who carried out many investigations into tissue samples and organs, still refused to use a microscope.\n\nTwo main problems hindered lens manufacture: image blurring (spherical aberration) and colour separation (chromatic aberration). Around 1830, Joseph Jackson Lister, in collaboration with instrument maker William Tulley, made one of the first microscopes that corrected for both these faults.\n\nWith these two major issues resolved, the use of microscopes in science and medicine grew rapidly.\n\nFrom the 1830s, cells and cell theory became the focus of medical and biological research, thanks to the central role of the microscope in laboratory science. Researchers were able to describe the body at the microscopic level more consistently and with greater confidence in what they saw.\n\nBetween 1838 and 1839 two German scientists, Mathias Schleiden (1804–81) and Theodor Schwann (1810–82) proposed that cells were the building blocks for plant and animal life.\n\nSchwann had a medical training and proposed that understanding cellular behaviour was the key to understanding the body in health and illness.\n\nHis theory was taken up by another German researcher, Rudolf Virchow (1821–1902), possibly the most influential teacher of pathology in the 1800s.\n\nThe microscope was at the centre of Virchow’s work on disease processes, he would urge his students to 'learn to see microscopically'. Much of Virchow’s work involved investigating tissue and cells in the laboratory and then relating his findings back to clinical changes in his patients.\n\nHe made use of the latest developments in microscopy such as the use of microtomes to cut very thin slices of tissue and the development of stains to highlight the parts of a cell."
