        "text": "Instrument/Service Type:\n\nWidefield microscope\n\nMake/Model:\n\nIX81\n\nInstrument Description:\n\nThis microscope uses a high-intensity Prior Scientific Lumen 200Pro 200-watt metal halide lamp, motorized filter wheels with Chroma and Semrock optical filters, a Prior Scientific H117 motorized, linear-encoded stage (X-Y), and Olympus motorized Z-drive. The optical filters include QD360, DAPI/Hoechst, ECFP, EGFP, Venus, Alexa568;TxRed;mCherry/TdTomato, Alexa647, and other related probes. The microscope allows custom configurations. There is also brightfield and phase-contrast (20x and 40x). The detector is a Hamamatsu ORCA R2 CCD.\n\nThe following objective lenses are available: 4x NA 0.13, 10x NA 0.40, 20x NA 0.70, 40x NA 0.75, 60x water NA 1.20, 60x oil NA 1.35, and 100x oil NA 1.40.\n\nFor live cell imaging, an InVivo Scientific stage-top incubation chamber is available in single 35 mm dishes or multiwell plate formats, using pre-blended atmospheric gas. The microscope is controlled with Slidebook 6.0 software and is excellent for fixed samples and timelapse imaging of live cells.\n\nInstrument Website URL:\n\nhttps://www.colorado.edu/lmcf/microscopes-workstations/widefield-stereo\n\nPrimary Contact:\n\nJames Orth\n\nEmail: james.orth@colorado.edu\n\nPhone: 303-492-5955 or 303-492-5057\n\nInstrument Home Department/Institute:\n\nMCDB\n\nInstrument Home Facility:\n\nLight Microscopy Core Facilityâ€‹\n\nInstrument Location:\n\nPorter B047A\n\nAvailable to university users?\n\nYes\n\nAvailable to external, academic and national lab users?\n\nYes"
