        "text": "Prior Scientific has introduced its newest automated slide loader, the SL160. This 160-slide capacity loader combines reliability, easy setup, and high capacity to provide automated slide loading to a wide variety of existing upright microscopes or with the use of Prior’s OpenStand microscope. This SL160 will be the standard for OEMs and system integrators and allow for precise and safe loading of slides for the pathology, cytology, and screening markets.\n\nPrior Scientific designed this system from the ground up to be the safest and most reliable slide loader on the market. Each precious slide is simply and securely mounted in the custom four-slide holder. Mounted within the four-slide holder, slides remain safe avoiding all contact with moving parts of the loader. Reliability is unmatched with millions of slides loaded and unloaded in extensive testing. “The new SL160 Slide Loader is the culmination of years of testing and redesign to achieve the highest standards in the industry”, reports Thomas Freda, CEO of Prior Scientific. Freda adds, “Full 15 by 15 millimeter areas of each slide under a 20x magnification objective can be completed in as little as 60 seconds”.\n\nAfter placing hundreds of units in the field with their previous loader designs, Prior Scientific is utilizing and leveraging that expertise in our newly designed loader, the SL160. The system has far fewer moving parts, can be set up in as little as 30 minutes and with several integrated sensing systems, your slides are truly handled properly with the utmost care. By loading four slides at a time, the SL160 allows for a much higher overall throughput of scanning. The optional preview station with integral illuminator is a scan time saver and is used to pre-determine areas of interest. Prior’s proven and reliable ProScan system controls the loader, scanning stage, and the optional OpenStand automated microscopy platform for a one-controller, multi-axis solution to simplify software integration."
