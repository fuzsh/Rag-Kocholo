        "text": "Late-Breaking Science Abstract Submission Guidelines\n\nLate-Breaking Science Sessions are innovative and provide the latest breakthroughs in clinical science. The sessions provide notable exposure and recognition for studies likely to have a significant impact on clinical practice and/or to make significant advances in a scientific field. The American Heart Association is excited to receive your late-breaking science.\n\nSubmission: Abstracts submitted via the late-breaking submission process are expected to contain, at a minimum, the study design. Information on the characteristics of the patients enrolled is also desirable. If available, the major trial results should be summarized and will be maintained confidential. Each submission must include a $300 online payment. If accepted, the abstract may be modified in the fall for publication, since the trial data presented at Scientific Sessions will be published online in the Circulation journal supplement. Send your questions or concerns to [email protected].\n\nWe understand the flexibility needed for trial timelines. For trials closing close to the deadline, please reach out to [email protected] and she will forward your concerns to the Chair and Vice-Chair of the Committee on Scientific Sessions Program.\n\nSubmission Type:\n\nLate-Breaking Randomized Clinical Trial – must include some type of intervention\n\nBreakthrough Innovations &hdash; first in human therapeutics, major technology advances\n\nClinical Trial Update – Update on a previously presented clinical trial\n\nHigh Impact Science from Clinical Registries or Observational Studies\n\nCategories/Themes\n\nAbstract Character Guidelines\n\nAbstracts are limited to 2,500 characters (about 360-630 words).\n\nCounts towards character limit:\n\nSpaces in the abstract body\n\nText in the abstract body\n\nDoes not count towards character limit:\n\nTitle of abstract\n\nNames of authors\n\nGraphic\n\nCaption of graphic\n\nGraphics Guidelines\n\nAll graphics (figures) and text-based graphics (tables) should be provided as 72-300 dpi, pre-sized, BMP, GIF, JPG or PNG images only, with a maximum width of 440 pixels (no limit on length).\n\nBlack-and-white digital images should be in grayscale mode. Color images should be saved in RGB color mode.\n\nAll graphics will require a brief description of the image.\n\nPlease Note: If an abstract is accepted for publication, any images submitted with the abstract are placed after the abstract that will appear in the online-only supplement to Circulation, an American Heart Association journal.\n\nThe abstract with the overall design and major results that you submitted for consideration may be edited online in preparation for publication in Circulation. Further information with a link to the abstract site will be sent to you from [email protected] when editing is available in mid-October. The final abstract provided to the AHA will be published in Circulation.\n\nThe Abstract Copyright Transfer Agreement is collected at the time of abstract submission. If you select \"Yes,\" your abstract will be published in the online Circulation supplement and the online Program Planner. If you select \"No,\" your abstract will be EXCLUDED from publication in the online Circulation supplement and the online Program Planner.\n\nIf you submitted an abstract to Scientific Sessions 2024 general abstract submission (April–June) that has the same focus as the abstract submitted to the LBS program, it may only be accepted in one format on the Scientific Sessions 2024 program. If accepted in both the general abstract submission and the LBS submission, please let [email protected] know via email so that we can withdraw the abstract accepted in the general program.\n\nIf you submitted an abstract(s) with separate/complementary analyses apart from this trial/presentation, that is acceptable. An abstract submitted to the general abstract submission for consideration in the general program that includes information other than the primary data from the clinical trial may be considered for presentation in the regular program at Scientific Sessions on a case-by-case basis. Please notify [email protected] if another abstract based on the clinical trial was submitted via the regular abstract submission process.\n\nUse of Automated Assistive Writing Technologies and Tools\n\nThe use of automated assistive writing technologies and tools (commonly referred to as artificial intelligence or machine learning tools) is permitted provided that their use is documented, and authors assume responsibility for the content. As with human-generated content, authors are responsible for the accuracy, validity and originality of computer-generated content. Automated assistive writing technologies do not qualify for authorship as they are unable to provide approval or consent for submission.\n\nIf the use of these technologies has involved the research design, the tools should be documented in the Methods. For additional information, see the World Association of Medical Editor recommendations.\n\nFor your abstract submission, you will need to indicate the use of these tools.\n\nAdditional Late-Breaking Science Submission Requirements:\n\nInformation regarding your science will be collected during the submission process. Not all questions may be applicable to your research. Please fill out the required steps during submission to the best of your ability.\n\nAre implications for health equity addressed in the study findings?\n\nIs this study testing a treatment/intervention to improve health outcomes?\n\nIs this a first-in-human therapeutic trial?\n\nAvailability of final data\n\nCompany supporting the trial\n\nDisclosure of unlabeled/investigational use of drug or product\n\nAcronym and marketing description (that does not mention trial results or outcomes)\n\nPrincipal investigator\n\nThe AHA is committed to improving health by ensuring the diversity of populations in scientific research. This is in keeping with FDA guidance and standards set by scientific journals.\n\nDoes the study include representation from women and historically underrepresented racial and ethnic populations?\n\nIs your study group representative of the people who have the condition of interest?\n\nFeatured Science\n\nDuring Late-Breaking Science submission, you have the option to select if your abstract may be considered for a Featured Science Session. This means if your abstract is not selected to be presented in a Late-Breaking Science Session at Scientific Sessions 2024, it may be considered for presentation in a Featured Science Session as an oral presentation. The embargo policy for presentation in a Featured Science Session remains the same as a Late-Breaking Science Session.\n\nNote: Industry announcements required by the SEC (Security Exchange Commission) must be approved by the AHA prior to release and any level of information released without approval will be considered an embargo break.\n\nAHA/ACC/ESC Acceptance/Embargos\n\nAbstracts related to a clinical trial submitted for consideration for presentation at the American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology and European Society of Cardiology cannot be presented at the other two meetings. After acceptance by one of the organizations, that organization’s specific embargo guidelines prevail. An embargo means that results from the trial cannot be presented or announced in any forum prior to presentation at the meeting to which it has been accepted. Violators will be banned from participating in the clinical trials for two full cycles or for two of each organization’s meetings (AHA, ACC or ESC).\n\nAHA Embargo Policies\n\nClinical trial results are prohibited from being released until the date and time of AHA-designated embargo time. For late-breaking science and featured science presentations, the embargo time is the date and time of the presentation at Scientific Sessions 2024. Clinical trial sponsors must comply with embargo guidelines established by the American Heart Association.\n\nYou are prohibited from sharing written embargoed information with anyone outside of the AHA except for journal manuscript submission.\n\nImportant Note: Industry announcements required by the SEC (Security Exchange Commission) must be approved by the AHA prior to release and any level of information released without approval will be considered an embargo break. However, you may conduct one-on-one embargoed media interviews as long as the reporter agrees to abide by the embargo policy. Failure to honor embargo policies will result in the trial being withdrawn on site and barred from presentation. Failure to honor this embargo policy may also jeopardize future acceptance of clinical trials and presentations at Scientific Sessions. Therefore, it is essential to recognize that presentations at unofficial satellite meetings or unofficial press conferences before the scheduled AHA embargoed media briefings are not allowed. This embargo policy will be strictly enforced."
