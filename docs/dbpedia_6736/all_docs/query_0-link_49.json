        "text": "Prior Scientific is proud to announce the latest addition to their wide range of illumination products for microscopy - the new Brightfield LED Illuminator. The Brightfield LED illuminator provides all the advantages of LED illumination in a flexible package that can be fitted to most modern upright and inverted microscope systems. With 10,000+ hours of operating lifetime, the LED simply replaces the standard lamphouse and is easily fitted to the microscope. Control of the unit is a choice of manual intensity control, TTL control or ON/OFF, eliminating the need for shutter mechanisms. The intensity can be regulated manually via a small controller, to give precise control of the illumination. The intensity is sufficient even for contrast techniques such as phase contrast or DIC imaging. Illumination is even across the field of view and a constant colour temperature is assured at all intensities. The LED can be powered directly from the Prior ProScan™ and OptiScan™ controllers via the shutter connections or as a stand alone light source with a separate power cable. Adapters are available for most of the microscopes from all the major microscope manufacturers."
