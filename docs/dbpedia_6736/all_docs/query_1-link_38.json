When equipped with low-vacuum (LV) mode (up to 300 Pa), all LV orifices can be retracted without breaking vacuum for unrestricted low-magnification imaging and maximum beam current (200 nA) in high vacuum. For the ultimate versatility, the JSM-7100FTLV features through-the-lens electron detectors with energy filter.\n\nJEOL USA\n\nwww.jeolusa.com\n\nHigh-Resolution EBSD Detector for Nanomaterials\n\nThe e−FlashHR high-resolution EBSD detector from Bruker, offering a resolution of 2 megapixels, is the latest addition to the CrystAlign EBSD analysis system. Featuring a resolution of 1600 × 1200 pixels combined with excellent optics, the e−FlashHR is able to display fine pattern details, making it ideal for the analysis of fine-grained and/or nonconductive materials, nanomaterials, and for use at low-beam currents and low accelerating voltages.\n\nBruker Nano\n\nwww.bruker-nano.com\n\nAURIGA Laser: Combination of FIB/SEM Technology with Laser Ablation for Fast Sample Preparation\n\nCarl Zeiss has launched the AURIGA® Laser, a new advanced system combining the specific advantages of the AURIGA® CrossBeam (FIB-SEM) workstation with the capabilities of a pulsed micro-focus laser for fast ablation of material. AURIGA® Laser is particularly useful for the examination of samples where the target structure is deeply buried under material layers. Ablation with a pulsed micro-focus laser beam offers clear advantages: it does not damage the sample underneath.\n\nCarl Zeiss, Microscopy\n\nwww.zeiss.de\n\nResearchers Can Tailor Make Their Own UV Viewing Systems\n\nThe Spectroline® and CC-81 ultraviolet viewing systems provide unequaled fluorescence analysis and no-wait photo-documentation of research findings. Scientists can select from eight snap-on camera adapters, so the systems can be used with any 35mm SLR camera or with any of seven different Polaroid cameras. The CC-80 and CC-81 are ideal for use in chromatography, electrophoresis, genetic research, photoresist coating inspection, forensic science, and much more.\n\nSpectronics Corporation\n\nwww.spectroline.com\n\nUpgrade any Microscope with an LCD View Screen and Digital Camera\n\nCarltex introduced a new line of Microscope LCD Digital Tablet/Cameras that are ideal for any microscope. Available in 2.0 MP (BLC-200) and 5.0 MP (BLC-500) resolutions, these units combine the features of a tablet PC and a digital camera. Besides providing a real-time specimen visual display, they can also take specimen snapshots and videos, perform measurements and calibrations (BLC-500), and transfer information to a network and/or internet using the built-in wi-fi capability.\n\nCarltex Inc\n\nwww.carltex.com/BestScope.htm\n\nEDAX Launches New Team™ Pegasus Integrated EDS and EBSD System\n\nEDAX Inc. has introduced the TEAM™ Pegasus system, which combines energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) hardware with EDAX's highly successful TEAM™ software platform to create the next generation in synergistic materials characterization. The product offers both high-level analysis capabilities and an easy-to-use, intuitive interface to users of all levels. The TEAM™ platform introduces Smart Features such as Smart Camera, Smart Background, Smart Indexing, and Smart Data Management.\n\nAMETEK EDAX\n\nwww.edax.com\n\nUltra-Sharp Imaging Package for AMRAY 3000 Series SEMs\n\nSEMTech Solutions designed an imaging package that is compatible with all AMRAY 3000 series SEMs. This package offers sharper imaging with higher contrast. Older SEMs have video signal voltage ranges that are above and beyond those required for today's flat panel displays (FPD). These higher voltages result in the FPD clipping the video signal, which produces an image that is less sharp than one would desire. The Ultra-Sharp Imaging System corrects this issue.\n\nSEMTech Solutions, Inc.\n\nwww.semtechsolutions.com/files/Ultra_Sharp_Imaging_Upgrade.pdf\n\nIntroducing the Lumen 200S Fluorescence Illumination System from Prior Scientific\n\nPrior Scientific announced the newest addition to the Lumen series of fluorescence illumination systems—the Lumen 200S with high-speed shutter. A wide variety of control options are available for the Lumen 200S including RS232, USB, TTL, and via the Prior Scientific ProScan III controller shutter port. The Lumen 200S also features a 2,000-hour life, 200-watt metal arc lamp with a stabilized DC power supply for consistent illumination.\n\nPrior Scientific, Inc.\n\nwww.prior.com\n\nTilt & Rotation Sample Holder for the Phenom™ Desktop SEM\n\nThe computer-controlled Motorized Tilt & Rotation Sample Holder enables smart 360° rotation and tilting from −10° to +45° via a dedicated Pro Suite application system. The compucentric rotation allows viewing details from all sides, even when the feature is off-center, while the specific feature remains at the center of focus. The Z-height is auto-corrected through the pseudo-eucentric tilt, while simultaneously the Y-position of the Phenom-stage is corrected.\n\nPhenom-World BV\n\nwww.phenom-world.com\n\nHigh-Precision Forensic Glass Analysis from CRAIC Technologies\n\nCRAIC Technologies, Inc. joins with Laboratory Imaging, s.r.o. to introduce rIQ™: the intelligent solution for the analysis of glass trace evidence. rIQ™, which stands for Refractive Index Quantification, is the result of a collaboration between CRAIC Technologies and Laboratory Imaging. rIQ™ combines sophisticated image-analysis software, advanced optical design, and electronics to enable criminalists in modern forensic laboratories to measure the refractive index of multiple glass fragments simultaneously, quickly, and with the highest accuracy.\n\nCRAIC Technologies, Inc.\n\nwww.microspectra.com\n\nRevolutionary Cameras Offer Powerful CMOS Sensors and Dual GigE\n\nAvailable with 2- and 4-megapixel resolutions, Baumer HXG cameras reliably transfer more than 100 frames/s. HXG cameras combine the latest CMOS sensor technology with a dual GigE interface and PoE (power over ethernet). Dual GigE technology allows the cameras to double GigE bandwidth, achieving a bandwidth of 240 MB/s with all the advantages of gigabit ethernet. If one GigE line becomes disconnected, the camera will continue to operate on the remaining GigE line.\n\nBaumer Ltd.\n\nwww.baumergroup.com\n\nElectron Microscopy Sciences Offers 3D Measurement in Scanning Electron Microscopy\n\nElectron Microscopy Sciences announced the addition of MeX, a stand-alone software package that turns any SEM with digital imaging into a true surface metrology device.
