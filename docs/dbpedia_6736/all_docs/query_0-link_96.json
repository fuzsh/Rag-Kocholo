        "text": "Author and journalist telling stories at the front lines of science and democracy.\n\nI most recently served as a fellow/journalist-in-residence at The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank in Washington, D.C. My book, The Long Haul: How Long Covid Survivors Are Revolutionizing Healthcare, will be available in paperback March 5, 2024 through MIT Press and distributed by Penguin Random House.\n\nI began at CNN in 2015 and served as a science and health features writer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Before joining CNN, I directed, produced, and wrote a feature-length documentary, Forgotten Plague, which the Huffington Post called a \"Must-See Documentary.\" I have also written for The Guardian, the Daily Beast, USA Today, STAT News, and Business Insider.\n\nI am a five-time Stanford Medicine X ePatient Scholar. I also sit on the board of directors of the #MEAction Network. I graduated Phi Beta Kappa from UGA with degrees in English and international affairs, and was named to the school's 40 Under 40 list for 2018."
