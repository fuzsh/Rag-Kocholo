        "text": "Established in 1964 to study the sardine and tuna fisheries of the U.S. West Coast, we provide scientific information to support fisheries management and conserve protected species in the California Current, throughout the Pacific Ocean, and in the Southern Ocean off Antarctica.\n\nOur scientists conduct marine biological, economic and oceanographic research, observations, and monitoring of living marine resources and their environment. We also conduct research on the impacts of environmental variability and climate change on marine ecosystems and on fishery and conservation socio-economics. We work with numerous partners and our NOAA Fisheries counterparts—the Northwest, Pacific Islands and Alaska Fisheries Science Centers and the West Coast Regional Office—provide sound science for national and international management decisions.\n\nCelebrate with us! Southwest Fisheries Science Center's: Hispanic Heritage Month StoryMap, Pride Month StoryMap, Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month StoryMap and Women's History Month StoryMap.\n\nOur Science Divisions\n\nAntarctic Ecosystem Research Division\n\nThe Antarctic Ecosystem Research Division manages and implements the U.S. Antarctic Marine Living Resources Program, which provides information for U.S. policy on the management and conservation of Antarctic living resources and supports U.S. participation in international efforts to protect the Antarctic and its marine life.\n\nEnvironmental Research Division\n\nThe Environmental Research Division focuses on investigations of environmental variability on marine resources—from local to global scales—and the effects of global climate change on oceanic processes important to fish population dynamics. We develop oceanographic information and data products through the ERDDAP data server and host the West Coast regional site for the NOAA CoastWatch program, which provides rapid dissemination of satellite observation data to governmental, academic, commercial, and public users.\n\nFisheries Ecology Division\n\nThe Fisheries Ecology Division focuses on demersal and anadromous fish of the California Current and inland waters. We conduct stock assessments for the management of groundfish and salmon fisheries and provide scientific information to support the conservation of threatened and endangered species and their habitats.\n\nFisheries Resources Division\n\nThe Fisheries Resources Division conducts research on valuable coastal pelagic and highly migratory marine species in the eastern Pacific Ocean. We focus on the ecology, ecosystems, and fisheries of sardine, anchovy, mackerels, abalones, tunas, and sharks in support of domestic and international fisheries management.\n\nMarine Mammal and Turtle Division\n\nThe Marine Mammal and Turtle Division conducts research on the conservation and recovery of marine mammals and turtles in all oceans of the world, with a special focus on the eastern Pacific.\n\nOur Leadership and Support Divisions\n\nOffice of the Science Director\n\nThe Director’s Office provides overall leadership, coordination, and communication for the Center's science programs.\n\nOperations and Management Division\n\nThe Operations and Management Division provides administrative and operational services including financial and acquisitions management, human resources, facilities management and safety and environmental compliance in support of the Center’s staff and research mission.\n\nInformation Technology Services\n\nInformation Technology Services provides information technology and data management services to support the Center's science programs."
