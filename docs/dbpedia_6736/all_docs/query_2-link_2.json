        "text": "The HLD117 series of flat top stages with linear motor technology for inverted research microscopes set new standards for convenience and performance. Designed to seamlessly integrate with other items such as micromanipulators and incubation chambers, the top surface of the stage is completely free of obstruction. This provides a highly ergonomic platform with exceptionally easy access to the sample area. The HLD117 incorporates constant contact bearings giving the lowest friction and smoothest drive available.\n\nThe HLD117 offers:\n\nUltra Quiet Operation\n\nCan you hear that? Neither can we! Even at high speeds (up to 300 mm/sec) the linear DC servo motors are almost silent.\n\nThe Highest Precision\n\nWith an impressive 0.15 micron repeatability and 50 nanometer linear scales, the HLD117 is the best microscope stage on the market today.\n\nLow Profile Design\n\nThe low profile flat top design allows ample room to access microscope adjustments.\n\nThe HLD117’s offer superior versaltility and are an ideal solution for:\n\nSlide Scanning\n\nBuilt for performance with unmatched acceleration rates and speeds, the HLD117 is the best choice for either start/stop point to point imaging or for continuous motion and velocity controlled scanning applications. The ProScan controller with TTL I/O and triggering functions provides constant speed movements with extremely low velocity ripple for picture perfect synchronization between automation and imaging software.\n\nMultipoint Imaging\n\nWhether your cells are fixed or in solution Prior linear drive stages make multiple position imaging a breeze. Image acquisition from multiple points scattered across a wide area is faster than previously thought possible. Scanning a 96 well plate in about 15 seconds? It’s here. Want more data? Add Prior’s Nanopositioning Piezo Z stage and collect three dimensional data at each position in milliseconds!\n\nHigh Content Screening\n\nCombine the fastest most precise stage ever made by Prior, solid state LED light sources, PLW20 Well Plate Loader, ProScan TTL triggering, your microscope and imaging software and you have the resolution, automation and speed, speed, speed needed for the acquisition of high content screening multi-parametric data."
