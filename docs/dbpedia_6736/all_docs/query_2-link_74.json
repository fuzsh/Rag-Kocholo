(This simple calculation procedure gives correct guideline figures for each year, but it is not identical to the procedure by which the poverty guidelines are calculated from the poverty thresholds each year; see an example calculation.) Before 1982, the poverty guidelines were issued by the Office of Economic Opportunity/Community Services Administration.\n\nVisit Historical Poverty Guidelines for a complete set of poverty guidelines and web links to their Federal Register notices.\n\nVisit Spreadsheet Tool to Calculate Different Percentages of the Guidelines, 1983 to 2024.\n\nNOTE: The poverty guideline figures below are NOT the figures the Census Bureau uses to calculate the number of poor persons.\n\nThe figures that the Census Bureau uses are the poverty thresholds."
