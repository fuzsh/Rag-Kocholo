        "text": "#Product Trends\n\nMotorised Z-Axis Microscope Focus Blocks\n\nThe FB series of Z-axis motorised focus blocks from Prior Scientific offer precise and repeatable positioning of loads with a weight of up to 14 kg.\n\nWhen creating an imaging system it is often necessary to move components and samples, such as an XY microscope stage, vertically. Achieving precise movement in the Z-Axis is essential for high quality imaging, but can be difficult, especially with heavier components.\n\nDesigned and manufactured to the highest standards – Prior Scientific Z-axis motorised focus blocks deliver the repeatability (± 0.7 µm) and precision (± 20 nm) required for almost any imaging application. Even with a full load, these motorised focus blocks may be driven between 1 and 14 mm/sec over a travel range of 38 mm, making them a versatile choice for integration with a wide range of imaging systems.\n\nRanging from a simple stand-alone motorised linear axis focus block through mounts for holding stages for incident and transmitted light experiments to encoded devices where overall accuracy and precision is paramount, standard and custom FB series motorised focus blocks are available to suit most applications.\n\nFB series motorised focus blocks, as well as any mounted Prior XY microscope stage, can be controlled via Prior’s ProScan III control system. This control system integrates into a wide variety of imaging applications, potentially allowing every component of the imaging system to be controlled from a central point.\n\nFor further information on the FB series of Z-axis motorised focus blocks please visit www.prior-scientific.co.uk/Products/Focus-drives/Motorised-linear-axis-FB-range.aspx orcontact Prior Scientific on uksales@prior.com / +44-1223-881711.\n\nPrior Scientific has been manufacturing top quality, high performance equipment and instruments for optical microscopy since 1919. Prior Scientific produces a wide range of motorised stages, system controllers, robotic sample loaders and illumination devices.
