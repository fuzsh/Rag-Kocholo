        "text": "The web address contains information about the location of the webpage.\n\nIt is also known as the URL (uniform resource locator).\n\nLike the address for your home, a web address organizes information about a webpage's location in a predictable way.\n\nThis is how to break down the information using the following URL as an example:\n\nwww.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-697_d1o2.pdf\n\nNetwork:\n\nThis is a set of connected webpages. The address for the network is typically the same as the homepage of a website. Under that website will be a variety of webpages. The last part of the network address is the top level domain name.\n\nFrom the example, www.supremecourt.gov is the network section of the URL, and the top level domain is .gov.\n\nTop Level Domain:\n\nThis indicates the type of network, and can give you clues about the purpose/owners of a website. Websites based outside of the United States will often include a country code as part of the domain (e.g. .uk, .ca, .ng, etc.)\n\nCommon domain names:\n\n.com (business)\n\n.org (organization)\n\n.edu (education)\n\n.gov (government)\n\nNote: there are few restrictions about what domain name a website must use. A business can choose either .com or .org. Only a government site can use .gov, but you may find some government sites under other domains (e.g. some public schools use .org).\n\nFolders & subfolders:\n\nJust like on your personal computer, a website may have a variety of folders and subfolders to organize all of the content on the website.\n\nThe example above has a folder called opinions that contains a subfolder of PDF documents from 2012 called 12pdf.\n\nFile name:\n\nThe last part of a web address gives the name of the individual file that displays when you go to that address. Web address often end with the file name .htm or .html, which indicates that you are looking at a regular webpage.\n\nThe example address above has the file name 11-697_d1o2.pdf. Because the file name ends with .pdf, it will display a PDF document.\n\nBecause the Walden Library is on the Internet, it can sometimes be difficult to know when you are in the Library or on a different website.\n\nWalden Library webpages have web addresses that start with:\n\nhttps://academicguides.waldenu.edu/library...\n\nWalden University Quick Answers have web addresses that start with:\n\nhttps://academicanswers.waldenu.edu/...\n\nWalden Library Database pages will include the following somewhere in the web address:\n\n...ezp.waldenulibrary.org/...\n\nAccessing Databases through the Walden Library:\n\nThe Library subscribes to databases from database vendors. This means that most of the web address is for the website of the vendor, but in order to access the database the vendor has to know that you are affiliated with Walden. You do this by accessing the database's website via the Walden Library. Once you log in, that little bit of web address (ezp.waldenulibrary.org) is added to the web address of every page you visit.\n\nNOTE: you can sometimes access a database without being in the Walden Library. If that happens, you may be able to search, but you won't have access to full text. How do you know if you're in the Library's version? Look for ezp.waldenulibrary.org/ in the web address.\n\nDatabase web address via the Library (full text access): https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezp.waldenulibrary.org/science/searchâ€‹\n\nDatabase web address on the Open Internet (no full text): https://www.sciencedirect.com/search/advanced"
