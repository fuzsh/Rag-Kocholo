        "text": "Currently, over 300 journals use the Registered Reports publishing format either as a regular submission option or as part of a single special issue. Other journals offer some features of the format. This list will be updated regularly as new journals join the initiative.\n\nFor an article type to qualify as a registered report, the journal policy must include at least these features:\n\nPeer review occurs prior to observing the outcomes of the research.\n\nManuscripts that survive pre-study peer review receive an in-principle acceptance that will not be revoked based on the outcomes, but only on failings of quality assurance, following through on the registered protocol, or unresolvable problems in reporting clarity or style.\n\nSee also this table that compares the specific features of Registered Reports at different outlets.\n\nIf you are considering a Registered Reports submission but not sure how to get started, a good way to begin is to (a) read the specific author guidelines included in the list of participating journals below, (b) complete this template protocol and then (c) expand the template protocol into a full Stage 1 manuscript.\n\nDetails\n\nRegistered Reports are a form of empirical journal article in which methods and proposed analyses are pre-registered and peer-reviewed prior to research being conducted. High quality protocols are then provisionally accepted for publication before data collection commences. This format of article is designed to reward best practice in adhering to the hypothetico-deductive model of the scientific method (see Figure 1 below). It eliminates a variety of questionable research practices, including low statistical power, selective reporting of results, and publication bias, while allowing complete flexibility to conduct exploratory (unregistered) analyses and report serendipitous findings.\n\nFigure 1. The hypothetico-deductive model of the scientific method is short-circuited by a range of questionable research practices (red). This example shows the prevalence of such practices in psychological science. Lack of replication impedes the elimination of false discoveries and weakens the evidence base underpinning theory. Low statistical power increases the chances of missing true discoveries and reduces the likelihood that obtained positive effects are real. Exploiting researcher degrees of freedom (p-hacking) manifests in two general forms: collecting data until analyses return statistically significant effects, and selectively reporting analyses that reveal desirable outcomes. HARKing, or hypothesizing after results are known, involves generating a hypothesis from the data and then presenting it as a priori. Publication bias occurs when journals reject manuscripts on the basis that they report negative or undesirable findings. Finally, lack of data sharing prevents detailed meta-analysis and hinders the detection of data fabrication.\n\nWorkflow\n\nAuthors of Registered Reports initially submit a Stage 1 manuscript that includes an Introduction, Methods, and the results of any pilot experiments that motivate the research proposal. Following assessment of the protocol by editors and reviewers, the manuscript can then be offered in-principle acceptance (IPA), which means that the journal virtually guarantees publication if the authors conduct the experiment in accordance with their approved protocol. With IPA in hand, the researchers then implement the experiment. Following data collection, they resubmit a Stage 2 manuscript that includes the Introduction and Methods from the original submission plus the Results and Discussion. The Results section includes the outcome of the pre-registered analyses together with any additional unregistered analyses in a separate section titled “Exploratory Analyses”. Authors are also encouraged or required to share their data on a public and freely accessible archive such as OSF or Figshare and are encouraged to share data analysis scripts. The final complete article is published after this process is complete. A published Registered Report will thus appear very similar to a standard research report but will give readers confidence that the hypotheses and main analyses are free of questionable research practices.\n\nThe Registered Reports Steering Committee is comprised of 20 members who oversee the recommended implementation policies, advise on implementation of and improvements to the format, and advocate for increased adoption. Members are invited to join by the existing committee, though external recommendations are welcome. Decisions are made by consensus.\n\nChris Chambers (chair), Cardiff University\n\nGeorge Banks, UNC Charlotte\n\nKate Button, University of Bath\n\nZoltan Dienes, University of Sussex\n\nAgneta Fischer, University of Amsterdam\n\nEmma Henderson, Kingston University\n\nKai Jonas, Maastricht University\n\nSean Grant, RAND\n\nBetsy Levy-Paluck, Princeton University\n\nEvan Mayo-Wilson, Johns Hopkins University\n\nMarcus Munafo, University of Bristol\n\nCandice Morey, University of Edinburgh\n\nBrendan Nyhan, Dartmouth\n\nDavid Rand, Yale\n\nSteven Rogelberg, UNC Charlotte\n\nPia Rotshtein University, of Birmingham\n\nCarien van Reekum, University of Reading\n\nAlexa Tullett, University of Alabama\n\nSimine Vazire, UC Davis\n\nDavid Mellor (non-voting member), Center for Open Science\n\nRegistered Report funding scheme\n\nIncrease efficiency, reduce bias, and add rigor\n\nWhen journals and funders partner on a Registered Report model, protocol review occurs simultaneously by journals and funders to maximize efficiency and impact. According to this mechanism, authors submit their research proposal before they have funding. Following simultaneous review by the both the funder and the journal, the strongest proposals are offered financial support by the funder and in-principle acceptance for publication by the journal.\n\nExisting Partnerships\n\nWhen journals and funders partner on a Registered Report model, protocol review occurs simultaneously by journals and funders to maximize efficiency and impact.

Following simultaneous review by the both the funder and the journal, the strongest proposals are offered financial support by the funder and in-principle acceptance for publication by the journal.\n\nExisting Partnerships\n\nCancer Research UK Registered Reports Funding Partnership\n\nThe Flu Lab, PLOS, and COS are partnering to promote replications and registered reports of influenza research.\n\nCancer Research UK and Nicotine & Tobacco Research\n\nGlobal Research Awards for Nicotine Dependence (GRAND) and Nicotine & Tobacco Research\n\nChildren's Tumor Foundation and PLOS ONE: Drug Discovery Initiative Registered Report (DDIRR) 2017 Awards. The registered projects for this program are here.\n\nThe Association for Politics & The Life Sciences will support data collection costs of up to seven projects as part of a registered research report special issue.\n\nProstate Cancer Foundation - Movember Foundation Reproducibility Initiative with PeerJ\n\nWho benefits from a Registered Reports funding scheme?\n\nJournals benefit by publishing work that is both cutting-edge and demonstrably reproducible. These are difficult criteria to achieve in single papers published through conventional means.\n\nFunders benefit by supporting a set of projects that are guaranteed to be published in a respected journal, eliminating publication bias and maximizing transparency. This mechanism also ensures that the specific work supported by the funder is undertaken; and there may also be administrative efficiencies for the funder where the review process is managed, at least in part, by the journal (with the funder of course maintaining a key role in deciding which work is supported).\n\nAuthors benefit by having their publications accepted in a respected journal before they start their research, and through a mechanism that not only minimizes researcher bias but also eliminates the incentive for authors to engage in biased research practices in the first place. The papers are therefore likely to be impactful and well cited.\n\nThe scientific community benefits from an increasing the stock of research that is timely, important, transparent and reproducible.\n\nRegistered Reports represent an ideal workflow to present the results of confirmatory, hypothesis-driven research. However, there are other formats that reduce bias and increase transparency into this process.\n\nResults Blind Peer Review\n\nJournals may conduct peer review in two stages, even when the results are already known to the authors.\n\nIn the first stage, authors will include a full manuscript for the abstract, introduction, and methods without the results and discussion sections. The submitted manuscript must not indicate information about the outcome-relevant results. The methods must contain a complete analysis plan of what is to be included in the full article. If relevant, outcome-irrelevant results can be reported to demonstrate, for example, that that experimental manipulations were effective, or outcome variables were measured reliably and conformed to distributional assumptions.\n\nIf the submission passes initial review, then the authors will submit a complete manuscript for second stage review to confirm that the final report adequately addresses reviewer concerns from the initial submission.\n\nJournals that use Results Blind Peer Review include:\n\nBMC Psychology\n\nEuropean Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology\n\nGroup and Organization Management\n\nInternational Journal of Selection and Assessment\n\nJournal of Business and Psychology\n\nJournal of Managerial Psychology\n\nJournal of Personnel Psychology\n\nJournal of Vocational Behavior\n\nLeadership Quarterly\n\nOrganizational Research Methods\n\nWork, Aging and Retirement\n\nExploratory Reports\n\nConfirmatory research is only half of the picture. Exploratory research is necessary in order to discover unexpected trends and allow for serendipitous findings. Current incentives encourage presenting exploratory findings as the result of confirmatory hypothesis tests, but journals that publish Exploratory Reports encourage more transparency into the work that led to a particular finding. See additional rationale for exploratory reports at the journal Cortex here and author guidelines here.\n\nJournals that currently offer Exploratory Reports include:\n\nCortex\n\nBMJ Open Science\n\nInternational Review of Social Psychology\n\nPrereg Posters\n\nPrereg posters are posters at academic conferences that present planned research, before data are collected or analysed. This format allows presenters to receive feedback on their theory, hypotheses, design and analyses from their colleagues (conference attendees), which is likely to improve the study. In turn, this can improve more formal preregistration, reducing the chances of subsequent deviation, and/or facilitate submission of the work as a Stage 1 Registered Report. Moreover, colleagues with shared scientific interests can become aware of the study earlier on, which can open the door to collaborations. For preliminary evidence of the benefits of prereg posters for encouraging constructive feedback, promoting open science and supporting early-career researchers, see this study by Brouwers et al. (2020).\n\nThe following conferences offer attendees the opportunity to present prereg posters:\n\nBritish Association of Cognitive Neuroscience (BACN)\n\nBritish Association for Psychopharmacology (BAP)\n\nBritish Neuroscience Association (BNA)\n\nCuttingEEG\n\nExperimental Psychological Society (EPS)\n\nFlux Congress\n\nInternational Conference of Cognitive Neuroscience (ICON)\n\nMathematical Cognition and Learning Society (MCLS)\n\nMental Health Science Meeting (MHSM)\n\nSociety for Research in Child Development"
