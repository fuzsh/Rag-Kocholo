Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) are key pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in CRS and are hence critical therapeutic targets. Current antagonists, such as tocilizumab and anakinra, target IL-6R/IL-1R but have limitations due to their long half-life and systemic anti-inflammatory effects, making them less suitable for acute or localized treatments. Here we present the de novo design of small protein antagonists that prevent IL-1 and IL-6 from interacting with their receptors to activate signaling. The designed proteins bind to the IL-6R, GP130 (an IL-6 co-receptor), and IL-1R1 receptor subunits with binding affinities in the picomolar to low-nanomolar range. X-ray crystallography studies reveal that the structures of these antagonists closely match their computational design models. In a human cardiac organoid disease model, the IL-1R antagonists demonstrated protective effects against inflammation and cardiac damage induced by IL-1β. These minibinders show promise for administration via subcutaneous injection or intranasal/inhaled routes to mitigate acute cytokine storm effects.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41467-024-50919-4\n\nView details for PubMedID 39152100\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID 7727315\n\nAbstract\n\nHLA-B*27 was one of the first HLA alleles associated with an autoimmune disease, i.e., axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) and acute anterior uveitis (B27AAU), which cause joint and eye inflammation, respectively. Gastrointestinal inflammation has been suggested as a trigger of axSpA. We recently identified a bacterial peptide (YeiH) that can be presented by HLA-B*27 to expanded public T cell receptors (TCRs) in the joint in axSpA and the eye in B27AAU. While YeiH is present in enteric microbiota and pathogens, additional evidence that pathogenic T cells in HLA-B*27-associated autoimmunity may have had a prior antigenic encounter within the gastrointestinal tract remains lacking. Here, we analyze ocular, synovial, and blood T cells in B27AAU and axSpA, showing that YeiH-specific CD8 T cells express a mucosal gene set and surface proteins consistent with intestinal differentiation, including CD161, integrin alpha4beta7, and CCR6. In addition, we find an expansion of YeiH-specific CD8 T cells in the blood of axSpA and B27AAU over healthy controls, whereas influenza-specific CD8 T cells were equivalent across groups. Lastly, we demonstrate the dispensability of TRBV9 for antigen recognition. Collectively, our data suggest that, in HLA-B27-associated autoimmunity, early antigen exposure and differentiation of pathogenic CD8 T cells may occur in enteric organs.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1172/jci.insight.174776\n\nView details for PubMedID 39024572\n\nAbstract\n\nIn natural proteins, structured loops have central roles in molecular recognition, signal transduction and enzyme catalysis. However, because of the intrinsic flexibility and irregularity of loop regions, organizing multiple structured loops at protein functional sites has been very difficult to achieve by de novo protein design. Here we describe a solution to this problem that designs tandem repeat proteins with structured loops (9-14 residues) buttressed by extensive hydrogen bonding interactions. Experimental characterization shows that the designs are monodisperse, highly soluble, folded and thermally stable. Crystal structures are in close agreement with the design models, with the loops structured and buttressed as designed. We demonstrate the functionality afforded by loop buttressing by designing and characterizing binders for extended peptides in which the loops form one side of an extended binding pocket. The ability to design multiple structured loops should contribute generally to efforts to design new protein functions.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41589-024-01632-2\n\nView details for PubMedID 38816644\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID 7312107\n\nAbstract\n\nThe loading of processed peptides on to major histocompatibility complex II (MHC-II) molecules for recognition by T cells is vital to cell-mediated adaptive immunity. As part of this process, MHC-II associates with the invariant chain (Ii) during biosynthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum to prevent premature peptide loading and to serve as a scaffold for subsequent proteolytic processing into MHC-II-CLIP. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of full-length Human Leukocyte Antigen-DR (HLA-DR) and HLA-DQ complexes associated with Ii, resolved at 3.0 to 3.1 Å, elucidate the trimeric assembly of the HLA/Ii complex and define atomic-level interactions between HLA, Ii transmembrane domains, loop domains, and class II-associated invariant chain peptides (CLIP). Together with previous structures of MHC-II peptide loading intermediates DO and DM, our findings complete the structural path governing class II antigen presentation.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1073/pnas.2403031121\n\nView details for PubMedID 38687785\n\nAbstract\n\nAlthough FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) depend on IL-2 produced by other cells for their survival and function, the levels of IL-2 in inflamed tissue are low, making it unclear how Treg access this critical resource. Here, we show that Treg use heparanase (HPSE) to access IL-2 sequestered by heparan sulfate (HS) within the extracellular matrix (ECM) of inflamed central nervous system tissue. HPSE expression distinguishes human and murine Treg from conventional T cells and is regulated by the availability of IL-2. HPSE-/- Treg have impaired stability and function in vivo, including in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of multiple sclerosis. Conversely, endowing monoclonal antibody-directed chimeric antigen receptor (mAbCAR) Treg with HPSE enhances their ability to access HS-sequestered IL-2 and their ability to suppress neuroinflammation in vivo. Together, these data identify a role for HPSE and the ECM in immune tolerance, providing new avenues for improving Treg-based therapy of autoimmunity.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41467-024-45012-9\n\nView details for PubMedID 38378682\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID 3675886\n\nAbstract\n\nClass-II major histocompatibility complexes (MHC-IIs) are central to the communications between CD4+ T cells and antigen presenting cells (APCs), but intrinsic structural features associated with MHC-II make it difficult to develop a general targeting system with high affinity and antigen specificity. Here, we introduce a protein platform, Targeted Recognition of Antigen-MHC Complex Reporter for MHC-II (TRACeR-II), to enable the rapid development of peptide-specific MHC-II binders. TRACeR-II has a small helical bundle scaffold and uses an unconventional mechanism to recognize antigens via a single loop. This unique antigen-recognition mechanism renders this platform highly versatile and amenable to direct structural modeling of the interactions with the antigen. We demonstrate that TRACeR-II binders can be rapidly evolved across multiple alleles, while computational protein design can produce specific binding sequences for a SARS-CoV-2 peptide of unknown complex structure. TRACeR-II sheds light on a simple and straightforward approach to address the MHC peptide targeting challenge, without relying on combinatorial selection on complementarity determining region (CDR) loops. It presents a promising basis for further exploration in immune response modulation as well as a broad range of theragnostic applications.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1101/2024.01.26.577489\n\nView details for PubMedID 38352315\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10862749\n\nAbstract\n\nEngineered cytokine-based approaches for immunotherapy of cancer are poised to enter the clinic, with IL-12 being at the forefront. However, little is known about potential mechanisms of resistance to cytokine therapies. We found that orthotopic murine lung tumors were resistant to systemically delivered IL-12 fused to murine serum albumin (MSA, IL12-MSA) due to low IL-12R expression on tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells. IL2-MSA increased binding of IL12-MSA by tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells, and combined administration of IL12-MSA and IL2-MSA led to enhanced tumor-reactive CD8+ T cell effector differentiation, decreased numbers of tumor-infiltrating CD4+ regulatory T (Treg) cells, and increased survival of lung tumor-bearing mice. Predictably, the combination of IL-2 and IL-12 at therapeutic doses led to significant dose-limiting toxicity. Administering IL-12 and IL-2 analogs with preferential binding to cells expressing IL12rb1 and CD25, respectively, led to a significant extension of survival in mice with lung tumors while abrogating dose-limiting toxicity. These findings suggest that IL-12 and IL-2 represent a rational approach to combination cytokine therapy whose dose-limiting toxicity can be overcome with engineered cytokine variants.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1172/jci.insight.172728\n\nView details for PubMedID 37669107\n\nAbstract\n\nIn the absence of cell-surface cancer-specific antigens, immunotherapies such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, monoclonal antibodies, or bispecific T cell engagers typically target lineage antigens. Currently, such immunotherapies are individually designed and tested for each disease. This approach is inefficient and limited to a few lineage antigens for which the on-target/off-tumor toxicities are clinically tolerated. Here, we sought to develop a universal CAR T cell therapy for blood cancers directed against the pan-leukocyte marker CD45. To protect healthy hematopoietic cells, including CAR T cells, from CD45-directed on-target/off-tumor toxicity while preserving the essential functions of CD45, we mapped the epitope on CD45 that is targeted by the CAR and used CRISPR adenine base-editing to install a function-preserving mutation sufficient to evade CAR T cell recognition. Epitope edited CD45 CAR T cell were fratricide-resistant and effective against patient-derived acute myeloid leukemia, B cell lymphoma, and acute T cell leukemia. Epitope edited hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) were protected from CAR T cells and, unlike CD45 knockout cells, could engraft, persist, and differentiate in vivo. Ex vivo epitope editing in HSCs and T cells enables the safe and effective use of CD45-directed CAR-T cells and bispecific T cell engagers for the universal treatment of hematologic malignancies and might be exploited for other diseases requiring intensive hematopoietic ablation.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1126/scitranslmed.adi1145\n\nView details for PubMedID 37651540\n\nAbstract\n\nTracking and imaging immune cells in vivo non-invasively would offer insights into the immune responses induced by vaccination. Here we report a cancer vaccine consisting of polymer-coated NaErF4/NaYF4 core-shell down-conversion nanoparticles emitting luminescence in the near-infrared spectral window IIb (1,500-1,700 nm in wavelength) and with surface-conjugated antigen (ovalbumin) and electrostatically complexed adjuvant (class-B cytosine-phosphate-guanine). Whole-body wide-field imaging of the subcutaneously injected vaccine in tumour-bearing mice revealed rapid migration of the nanoparticles to lymph nodes through lymphatic vessels, with two doses of the vaccine leading to the complete eradication of pre-existing tumours and to the prophylactic inhibition of tumour growth. The abundance of antigen-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes in the tumour microenvironment correlated with vaccine efficacy, as we show via continuous-wave imaging and lifetime imaging of two intravenously injected near-infrared-emitting probes (CD8+-T-cell-targeted NaYbF4/NaYF4 nanoparticles and H-2Kb/ovalbumin257-264 tetramer/PbS/CdS quantum dots) excited at different wavelengths, and by volumetrically visualizing the three nanoparticles via light-sheet microscopy with structured illumination. Nanoparticle-based vaccines and imaging probes emitting infrared light may facilitate the design and optimization of immunotherapies.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41551-023-01083-5\n\nView details for PubMedID 37620621\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID 7157724\n\nAbstract\n\nIn natural proteins, structured loops play central roles in molecular recognition, signal transduction and enzyme catalysis.

The structural mechanisms which influence these important physiological processes have yet to be explored. We present the 3.9 Å resolution cryo-EM structure of the human membrane receptor guanylyl cyclase GC-C in complex with Hsp90 and its co-chaperone Cdc37, providing insight into the mechanism of Cdc37 mediated binding of GC-C to the Hsp90 regulatory complex. As a membrane protein and non-kinase client of Hsp90-Cdc37, this work shows the remarkable plasticity of Cdc37 to interact with a broad array of clients with significant sequence variation. Furthermore, this work shows how membrane receptor guanylyl cyclases hijack the regulatory mechanisms used for active kinases to facilitate their regulation. Given the known druggability of Hsp90, these insights can guide the further development of membrane receptor guanylyl cyclase-targeted therapeutics and lead to new avenues to treat hypertension, inflammatory bowel disease, and other membrane receptor guanylyl cyclase-related conditions.\n\nView details for DOI 10.7554/eLife.86784\n\nView details for PubMedID 37535399\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10400071\n\nAbstract\n\nFine-tuning of protein-protein interactions occurs naturally through coevolution, but this process is difficult to recapitulate in the laboratory. We describe a platform for synthetic protein-protein coevolution that can isolate matched pairs of interacting muteins from complex libraries. This large dataset of coevolved complexes drove a systems-level analysis of molecular recognition between Z domain-affibody pairs spanning a wide range of structures, affinities, cross-reactivities, and orthogonalities, and captured a broad spectrum of coevolutionary networks. Furthermore, we harnessed pretrained protein language models to expand, in silico, the amino acid diversity of our coevolution screen, predicting remodeled interfaces beyond the reach of the experimental library. The integration of these approaches provides a means of simulating protein coevolution and generating protein complexes with diverse molecular recognition properties for biotechnology and synthetic biology.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1126/science.adh1720\n\nView details for PubMedID 37499032\n\nAbstract\n\nInterleukin-21 (IL-21) plays a critical role in generating immunological memory by promoting the germinal center reaction, yet clinical use of IL-21 remains challenging because of its pleiotropy and association with autoimmune disease. To better understand the structural basis of IL-21 signaling, we determine the structure of the IL-21-IL-21R-γc ternary signaling complex by X-ray crystallography and a structure of a dimer of trimeric complexes using cryo-electron microscopy. Guided by the structure, we design analogs of IL-21 by introducing substitutions to the IL-21-γc interface. These IL-21 analogs act as partial agonists that modulate downstream activation of pS6, pSTAT3, and pSTAT1. These analogs exhibit differential activity on T and B cell subsets and modulate antibody production in human tonsil organoids. These results clarify the structural basis of IL-21 signaling and offer a potential strategy for tunable manipulation of humoral immunity.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.celrep.2023.112657\n\nView details for PubMedID 37339051\n\nAbstract\n\nMembrane receptor guanylyl cyclases play a role in many important facets of human physiology, from regulating blood pressure to intestinal fluid secretion.

Although there is great interest in harnessing this cytokine as a therapeutic in natural or engineered formats, the clinical potential of native IL-4 is limited by its instability and pleiotropic actions. Here, we design IL-4 cytokine mimetics (denoted Neo-4) based on a de novo engineered IL-2 mimetic scaffold and demonstrate that these cytokines can recapitulate physiological functions of IL-4 in cellular and animal models. In contrast with natural IL-4, Neo-4 is hyperstable and signals exclusively through the type I IL-4 receptor complex, providing previously inaccessible insights into differential IL-4 signaling through type I versus type II receptors. Because of their hyperstability, our computationally designed mimetics can directly incorporate into sophisticated biomaterials that require heat processing, such as three-dimensional-printed scaffolds. Neo-4 should be broadly useful for interrogating IL-4 biology, and the design workflow will inform targeted cytokine therapeutic development.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41589-023-01313-6\n\nView details for PubMedID 37024727\n\nAbstract\n\nIn recent years, targeted protein degradation (TPD) of plasma membrane proteins by hijacking the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) or the lysosomal pathway has emerged as a novel therapeutic avenue in drug development to address and inhibit canonically difficult targets. While TPD strategies have been successful in targeting cell surface receptors, these approaches are limited by the availability of suitable binders to generate heterobifunctional molecules. Here, we present the development of a nanobody (VHH)-based degradation toolbox termed REULR (Receptor Elimination by E3 Ubiquitin Ligase Recruitment). We generated human and mouse cross-reactive nanobodies against five transmembrane PA-TM-RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligases (RNF128, RNF130, RNF167, RNF43, and ZNRF3), covering a broad range and selectivity of tissue expression, with which we characterized the expression in human and mouse cell lines and immune cells (PBMCs). We demonstrate that heterobifunctional REULR molecules can enforce transmembrane E3 ligase interactions with a variety of disease-relevant target receptors (EGFR, EPOR, and PD-1) by induced proximity, resulting in effective membrane clearance of the target receptor at varying levels. In addition, we designed E3 ligase self-degrading molecules, \"fratricide\" REULRs (RNF128, RNF130, RENF167, RNF43, and ZNRF3), that allow downregulation of one or several E3 ligases from the cell surface and consequently modulate receptor signaling strength. REULR molecules represent a VHH-based modular and versatile \"mix and match\" targeting strategy for the facile modulation of cell surface proteins by induced proximity to transmembrane PA-TM-RING E3 ligases.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1021/acssynbio.2c00587\n\nView details for PubMedID 37011906\n\nAbstract\n\nLeptin is an adipocyte-derived protein hormone that promotes satiety and energy homeostasis by activating the leptin receptor (LepR)-STAT3 signaling axis in a subset of hypothalamic neurons. Leptin signaling is dysregulated in obesity, however, where appetite remains elevated despite high levels of circulating leptin. To gain insight into the mechanism of leptin receptor activation, here we determine the structure of a stabilized leptin-bound LepR signaling complex using single particle cryo-EM. The structure reveals an asymmetric architecture in which a single leptin induces LepR dimerization via two distinct receptor-binding sites. Analysis of the leptin-LepR binding interfaces reveals the molecular basis for human obesity-associated mutations. Structure-based design of leptin variants that destabilize the asymmetric LepR dimer yield both partial and biased agonists that partially suppress STAT3 activation in the presence of wild-type leptin and decouple activation of STAT3 from LepR negative regulators. Together, these results reveal the structural basis for LepR activation and provide insights into the differential plasticity of signaling pathways downstream of LepR.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41467-023-37169-6\n\nView details for PubMedID 37002197\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID 4859313\n\nAbstract\n\nSecreted proteins are extracellular ligands that play key roles in paracrine and endocrine signaling, classically by binding cell surface receptors. Experimental assays to identify new extracellular ligand-receptor interactions are challenging, which has hampered the rate of novel ligand discovery. Here, using AlphaFold-multimer, we developed and applied an approach for extracellular ligand-binding prediction to a structural library of 1,108 single-pass transmembrane receptors. We demonstrate high discriminatory power and a success rate of close to 90 % for known ligand-receptor pairs where no a priori structural information is required. Importantly, the prediction was performed on de novo ligand-receptor pairs not used for AlphaFold training and validated against experimental structures. These results demonstrate proof-of-concept of a rapid and accurate computational resource to predict high-confidence cell-surface receptors for a diverse set of ligands by structural binding prediction, with potentially wide applicability for the understanding of cell-cell communication.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1101/2023.03.16.531341\n\nView details for PubMedID 36993313\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10055078\n\nAbstract\n\nJanus kinases (JAKs) mediate signal transduction downstream of cytokine receptors. Cytokine-dependent dimerization is conveyed across the cell membrane to drive JAK dimerization, trans-phosphorylation, and activation. Activated JAKs in turn phosphorylate receptor intracellular domains (ICDs), resulting in the recruitment, phosphorylation, and activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-family transcription factors. The structural arrangement of a JAK1 dimer complex with IFNlambdaR1 ICD was recently elucidated while bound by stabilizing nanobodies. While this revealed insights into the dimerization-dependent activation of JAKs and the role of oncogenic mutations in this process, the tyrosine kinase (TK) domains were separated by a distance not compatible with the trans-phosphorylation events between the TK domains. Here, we report the cryoelectron microscopy structure of a mouse JAK1 complex in a putative trans-activation state and expand these insights to other physiologically relevant JAK complexes, providing mechanistic insight into the crucial trans-activation step of JAK signaling and allosteric mechanisms of JAK inhibition.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.celrep.2023.112201\n\nView details for PubMedID 36867534\n\nAbstract\n\nFOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) depend on exogenous IL-2 for their survival and function, but circulating levels of IL-2 are low, making it unclear how Treg access this critical resource in vivo.

HPSE expression distinguishes human and murine Treg from conventional T cells and is regulated by the availability of IL-2. HPSE-/- Treg have impaired stability and function in vivo, including the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of multiple sclerosis. Conversely, endowing Treg with HPSE enhances their ability to access HS-sequestered IL-2 and their tolerogenic function in vivo. Together, these data identify novel roles for HPSE and the ECM in immune tolerance, providing new avenues for improving Treg-based therapy of autoimmunity.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1101/2023.02.26.529772\n\nView details for PubMedID 36909599\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10002643\n\nAbstract\n\nAllogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a curative option for patients with hematological disorders and bone marrow failure syndromes. Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD) remains a leading cause of morbidity post-transplant. Regulatory T cell (Treg) therapies are efficacious in ameliorating GVHD but limited by variable suppressive capacities and the need for a high therapeutic dose. Here, we sought to expand Treg in vivo by expressing an orthogonal IL-2Rbeta receptor (oIL2Rbeta) that would selectively interact with orthogonal IL-2 (oIL2) cytokine and not wildtype IL2. To test whether the orthogonal system would preferentially drive donor Treg expansion, we used a murine MHC-disparate GVHD model of lethally irradiated BALB/c mice given T-cell depleted bone marrow from C57BL/6 (B6) mice alone, or together with B6Foxp3+GFP+ Treg or oIL2Rbeta transduced Treg at low cell numbers that typically do not control GVHD with WT Treg. On day 2, B6 Tcons were injected to induce GVHD. Recipients were treated with PBS or oIL2 daily for 14 days, then 3 times weekly for an additional 14 days. Mice treated with oIL2Rbeta Treg and oIL2 compared to PBS had enhanced GVHD survival, in vivo selective expansion of Tregs, and greater suppression of Tcon expansion in secondary lymphoid organs, and intestines. Importantly, oIL2Rbeta Treg maintained graft-versus-tumor (GVT) responses in two distinct tumor models (A20, MLL-AF9). These data demonstrate a novel approach to enhance the efficacy of Treg cell therapy in allo-HSCT using an oIL2/oIL2Rbeta system that allows for selective in vivo expansion of Treg leading to GVHD protection and GVT maintenance.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1182/blood.2022018440\n\nView details for PubMedID 36564052\n\nAbstract\n\nChimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are ineffective against solid tumors with immunosuppressive microenvironments. To overcome suppression, we engineered circuits in which tumor-specific synNotch receptors locally induce production of the cytokine IL-2. These circuits potently enhance CAR T cell infiltration and clearance of immune-excluded tumors, without systemic toxicity. The most effective IL-2 induction circuit acts in an autocrine and T cell receptor (TCR)- or CAR-independent manner, bypassing suppression mechanisms including consumption of IL-2 or inhibition of TCR signaling. These engineered cells establish a foothold in the target tumors, with synthetic Notch-induced IL-2 production enabling initiation of CAR-mediated T cell expansion and cell killing. Thus, it is possible to reconstitute synthetic T cell circuits that activate the outputs ultimately required for an antitumor response, but in a manner that evades key points of tumor suppression.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1126/science.aba1624\n\nView details for PubMedID 36520915\n\nAbstract\n\nHuman leucocyte antigen B*27 (HLA-B*27) is strongly associated with inflammatory diseases of the spine and pelvis (for example, ankylosing spondylitis (AS)) and the eye (that is, acute anterior uveitis (AAU))1. How HLA-B*27 facilitates disease remains unknown, but one possible mechanism could involve presentation of pathogenic peptides to CD8+ T cells. Here we isolated orphan T cell receptors (TCRs) expressing a disease-associated public β-chain variable region-complementary-determining region 3β (BV9-CDR3β) motif2-4 from blood and synovial fluid T cells from individuals with AS and from the eye in individuals with AAU. These TCRs showed consistent α-chain variable region (AV21) chain pairing and were clonally expanded in the joint and eye. We used HLA-B*27:05 yeast display peptide libraries to identify shared self-peptides and microbial peptides that activated the AS- and AAU-derived TCRs. Structural analysis revealed that TCR cross-reactivity for peptide-MHC was rooted in a shared binding motif present in both self-antigens and microbial antigens that engages the BV9-CDR3β TCRs. These findings support the hypothesis that microbial antigens and self-antigens could play a pathogenic role in HLA-B*27-associated disease.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41586-022-05501-7\n\nView details for PubMedID 36477533\n\nAbstract\n\nThe establishment of a functional vasculature requires endothelial cells to enter quiescence during the completion of development, otherwise pathological overgrowth occurs. How such a transition is regulated remains unclear. Here, we uncover a role of Zeb1 in defining vascular quiescence entry. During quiescence acquisition, Zeb1 increases along with the progressive decline of endothelial progenitors' activities, with Zeb1 loss resulting in endothelial overgrowth and vascular deformities. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) analyses reveal that Zeb1 represses Wif1, thereby activating Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Knockdown of Wif1 rescues the overgrowth induced by Zeb1 deletion. Importantly, local administration of surrogate Wnt molecules in the retina ameliorates the overgrowth defects of Zeb1 mutants. These findings show a mechanism by which Zeb1 induces quiescence of endothelial progenitors during the establishing of vascular homeostasis, providing molecular insight into the inherited neovascular pathologies associated with human ZEB1 mutations, suggesting pharmacological activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling as a potential therapeutical approach.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.celrep.2022.111694\n\nView details for PubMedID 36417861\n\nAbstract\n\nBinding of arrestin to phosphorylated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is crucial for modulating signaling. Once internalized, some GPCRs remain complexed with beta-arrestins, while others interact only transiently; this difference affects GPCR signaling and recycling. Cell-based and invitro biophysical assays reveal the role of membrane phosphoinositides (PIPs) in beta-arrestin recruitment and GPCR-beta-arrestin complexdynamics. We find that GPCRs broadly stratify into two groups, one that requires PIP binding for beta-arrestin recruitment and one that does not. Plasma membrane PIPs potentiate an active conformation of beta-arrestin and stabilize GPCR-beta-arrestin complexes by promoting a fully engaged state of the complex. As allosteric modulators of GPCR-beta-arrestin complex dynamics, membrane PIPs allow for additional conformational diversity beyond that imposed by GPCR phosphorylation alone. For GPCRs that require membrane PIP binding for beta-arrestin recruitment, this provides a mechanism for beta-arrestin release upon translocation of the GPCR to endosomes, allowing for its rapid recycling.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.cell.2022.10.018\n\nView details for PubMedID 36368322\n\nAbstract\n\nQualitative and quantitative analysis of transient signaling platforms in the plasma membrane has remained a key experimental challenge. Here, biofunctional nanodot arrays (bNDAs) are developed to spatially control dimerization and clustering of cell surface receptors at the nanoscale. High-contrast bNDAs with spot diameters of 300nm are obtained by capillary nanostamping of bovine serum albumin bioconjugates, which are subsequently biofunctionalized by reaction with tandem anti-green fluorescence protein (GFP) clampfusions. Spatially controlled assembly of active Wnt signalosomes is achieved at the nanoscale in the plasma membrane of live cells by capturing the co-receptor Lrp6 into bNDAs via an extracellular GFP tag. Strikingly, co-recruitment is observed of co-receptor Frizzled-8 as well as the cytosolic scaffold proteins Axin-1 and Disheveled-2 into Lrp6 nanodots in the absence of ligand. Density variation and the high dynamics of effector proteins uncover highly cooperative liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS)-driven assembly of Wnt \"signalodroplets\" at the plasma membrane, pinpointing the synergistic effects ofLLPSfor Wnt signaling amplification. These insights highlight the potential of bNDAs for systematically interrogating nanoscale signaling platforms and condensation at the plasma membrane of live cells.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/smll.202203723\n\nView details for PubMedID 36266931\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Localized ablative immunotherapies hold great promise in stimulating antitumor immunity to treat metastatic and poorly immunogenic tumors. Tumor ablation is well known to release tumor antigens and danger-associated molecular patterns to stimulate T-cell immunity, but its immune stimulating effect is limited, particularly against metastatic tumors.METHODS: In this study, we combined photothermal therapy with a potent immune stimulant, N-dihydrogalactochitosan, to create a local ablative immunotherapy which we refer to as laser immunotherapy (LIT). Mice bearing B16-F10 tumors were treated with LIT when the tumors reached 0.5 cm3 and were monitored for survival, T-cell activation, and the ability to resist tumor rechallenge.RESULTS: We found that LIT stimulated a stronger and more consistent antitumor T-cell response to the immunologically 'cold' B16-F10 melanoma tumors and conferred a long-term antitumor memory on tumor rechallenge. Furthermore, we discovered that LIT generated de novo CD8+ T-cell responses that strongly correlated with animal survival and tumor rejection.CONCLUSION: In summary, our findings demonstrate that LIT enhances the activation of T cells and drives de novo antitumor T-cell responses. The data presented herein suggests that localized ablative immunotherapies have great potential to synergize with immune checkpoint therapies to enhance its efficacy, resulting in improved antitumor immunity.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1136/jitc-2022-004973\n\nView details for PubMedID 36253002\n\nAbstract\n\nSecreted proteins, which include cytokines, hormones and growth factors, are extracellular ligands that control key signaling pathways mediating cell-cell communication within and between tissues and organs. Many drugs target secreted ligands and their cell-surface receptors. Still, there are hundreds of secreted human proteins that either have no identified receptors ('orphans') and are likely to act through cell surface receptors that have not yet been characterized. Discovery of secreted ligand-receptor interactions by high-throughput screening has been problematic, because the most commonly used high-throughput methods for protein-protein interaction (PPI) screening do not work well for extracellular interactions. Cell-based screening is a promising technology for definition of new ligand-receptor interactions, because multimerized ligands can enrich for cells expressing low affinity cell-surface receptors, and such methods do not require purification of receptor extracellular domains. Here, we present a proteo-genomic cell-based CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) enrichment screening platform employing customized pooled cell surface receptor sgRNA libraries in combination with a magnetic bead selection-based enrichment workflow for rapid, parallel ligand-receptor deorphanization. We curated 80 potentially high value orphan secreted proteins and ultimately screened 20 secreted ligands against two cell sgRNA libraries with targeted expression of all single-pass (TM1) or multi-pass (TM2+) receptors by CRISPRa. We identified previously unknown interactions in 12 of these screens, and validated several of them using surface plasmon resonance and/or cell binding. The newly deorphanized ligands include three receptor tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) ligands and a chemokine like protein that binds to killer cell inhibitory receptors (KIR's). These new interactions provide a resource for future investigations of interactions between the human secreted and membrane proteomes.\n\nView details for DOI 10.7554/eLife.81398\n\nView details for PubMedID 36178190\n\nAbstract\n\nNatural killer (NK) cells are a major subset of innate immune cells that are essential for host defense against pathogens and cancer. Two main classes of inhibitory NK receptors (NKR), KIR and CD94/NKG2A, play a key role in suppressing NK activity upon engagement with tumor cells or virus-infected cells, limiting their antitumor and antiviral activities. Here, we find that single-chain NKR antagonists linked to a VHH that binds the cell surface phosphatase CD45 potentiate NK and T activities to a greater extent than NKR blocking antibodies alone in vitro. We also uncovered crosstalk between NKG2A and Ly49 that collectively inhibit NK cell activation, such that CD45-NKG2A and CD45-Ly49 bispecific molecules show synergistic effects in their ability to enhance NK cell activation. The basis of the activity enhancement by CD45 ligation may reflect greater antagonism of inhibitory signaling from engagement of MHC I on target cells, combined with other mechanisms, including avidity effects, tonic signaling, antagonism of weak inhibition from engagement of MHC I on non-target cells, and possible CD45 segregation within the NK cell-target cell synapse. These results uncover a strategy for enhancing the activity of NK and T cells that may improve cancer immunotherapies.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1021/acssynbio.2c00337\n\nView details for PubMedID 36169352\n\nAbstract\n\nCytokines are secreted signalling proteins that play essential roles in the initiation, maintenance and resolution of immune responses. Although the unique ability of cytokines to control immune function has garnered clinical interest in the context of cancer, autoimmunity and infectious disease, the use of cytokine-based therapeutics has been limited. This is due, in part, to the ability of cytokines to act on many cell types and impact diverse biological functions, resulting in dose-limiting toxicity or lack of efficacy. Recent studies combining structural biology, protein engineering and receptor pharmacology have unlocked new insights into the mechanisms of cytokine receptor activation, demonstrating that many aspects of cytokine function are highly tunable. Here, we discuss the pharmacological principles underlying these efforts to overcome cytokine pleiotropy and enhance the therapeutic potential of this important class of signalling molecules.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41573-022-00557-6\n\nView details for PubMedID 36131080\n\nAbstract\n\nAdaptive immunity relies on T lymphocytes that use alphabeta T cell receptors (TCRs) to discriminate among peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex molecules (pMHCs). Identifying pMHCs capable of inducing robust T cell responses will not only enable a deeper understanding of the mechanisms governing immune responses but could also have broad applications in diagnosis and treatment. T cell recognition of sparse antigenic pMHCs in vivo relies on biomechanical forces. However, in vitro screening methods test potential pMHCs without force and often at high (nonphysiological) pMHC densities and thus fail to predict potent agonists in vivo. Here, we present a technology termed BATTLES (biomechanically assisted T cell triggering for large-scale exogenous-pMHC screening) that uses biomechanical force to initiate T cell triggering for peptides and cells in parallel. BATTLES displays candidate pMHCs on spectrally encoded beads composed of a thermo-responsive polymer capable of applying shear loads to T cells, facilitating exploration of the force- and sequence-dependent landscape of T cell responses. BATTLES can be used to explore basic T cell mechanobiology and T cell-based immunotherapies.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41592-022-01592-2\n\nView details for PubMedID 36064771\n\nAbstract\n\nClinical trials utilizing regulatory T cell (Treg) therapy in organ transplantation have shown promising results, however, the choice of a standard immunosuppressive regimen is still controversial. Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) are one of the most common immunosuppressants for organ transplantation, although they may negatively affect Tregs by inhibiting IL-2 production by conventional T cells. As a strategy to replace IL-2 signaling selectively in Tregs, we have introduced an engineered orthogonal IL-2 (ortho IL-2) cytokine/cytokine receptor (R) pair that specifically binds with each other but does not bind with their wild type counterparts. Murine Tregs were isolated from recipients and retrovirally transduced with ortho IL-2Rbeta during ex vivo expansion. Transduced Tregs (ortho Tregs) were transferred into recipient mice in a mixed hematopoietic chimerism model with tacrolimus administration. Ortho IL-2 treatment significantly increased the ortho IL-2Rbeta(+) Treg population in the presence of tacrolimus without stimulating other T cell subsets. All the mice treated with tacrolimus plus ortho IL-2 achieved heart allograft tolerance, even after tacrolimus cessation, whereas those receiving tacrolimus treatment alone did not. These data demonstrate that Treg therapy can be adopted into a CNI-based regimen by utilizing cytokine receptor engineering.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1111/ajt.17181\n\nView details for PubMedID 36031344\n\nAbstract\n\nIL13Rα2 is an attractive target due to its overexpression in a variety of cancers and rare expression in healthy tissue, motivating expansion of interleukin 13 (IL13)-based chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy from glioblastoma into systemic malignancies. IL13Rα1, the other binding partner of IL13, is ubiquitously expressed in healthy tissue, raising concerns about the therapeutic window of systemic administration. IL13 mutants with diminished binding affinity to IL13Rα1 were previously generated by structure-guided protein engineering. In this study, two such variants, termed C4 and D7, are characterized for their ability to mediate IL13Rα2-specific response as binding domains for CAR T cells. Despite IL13Rα1 and IL13Rα2 sharing similar binding interfaces on IL13, mutations to IL13 that decrease binding affinity for IL13Rα1 did not drastically change binding affinity for IL13Rα2. Micromolar affinity to IL13Rα1 was sufficient to pacify IL13-mutein CAR T cells in the presence of IL13Rα1-overexpressing cells in vitro. Interestingly, effector activity of D7 CAR T cells, but not C4 CAR T cells, was demonstrated when cocultured with IL13Rα1/IL4Rα-coexpressing cancer cells. While low-affinity interactions with IL13Rα1 did not result in observable toxicities in mice, in vivo biodistribution studies demonstrated that C4 and D7 CAR T cells were better able to traffic away from IL13Rα1+ lung tissue than were wild-type (WT) CAR T cells. These results demonstrate the utility of structure-guided engineering of ligand-based binding domains with appropriate selectivity while validating IL13-mutein CARs with improved selectivity for application to systemic IL13Rα2-expressing malignancies.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1073/pnas.2112006119\n\nView details for PubMedID 35939683\n\nAbstract\n\nThe interleukin-17 (IL-17) family of cytokines and receptors play central roles in host defense against infection, and development of inflammatory diseases1. The compositions and structures of functional IL-17 family ligand-receptor signaling assemblies remain unclear. Interleukin-17E (IL-17E or IL-25) is a key regulator of Th2 immune responses and driver of inflammatory diseases such as allergic asthma and requires both IL-17 receptor A (IL-17RA) and IL-17RB to elicit functional responses2. Here, we studied IL-25-IL-17RB binary and IL-25-IL-17RB-IL-17RA ternary complexes using a combination of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), single-molecule imaging, and cell-based signaling approaches. The IL-25-IL-17RB-IL-17RA ternary signaling assembly is a c2-symmetric complex in which the IL-25-IL-17RB homodimer is flanked by two \"wing-like\" IL-17RA co-receptors through a \"tip-to-tip\" geometry that is the key receptor-receptor interaction required for initiation of signal transduction. IL-25 interacts solely with IL-17RB to allosterically promote the formation of the IL-17RB-IL-17RA tip-to-tip interface. The resulting large separation between the receptors at the membrane-proximal level may reflect proximity constraints by the intracellular domains for signaling. Cryo-EM structures of IL-17A-IL-17RA and IL-17A-IL-17RA-IL-17RC complexes reveal that this tip-to-tip architecture is a key organizing principle of the IL-17 receptor family, Furthermore, these studies reveal dual actions for IL-17RA sharing amongst IL-17 cytokine complexes, by either directly engaging IL-17 cytokines, or alternatively functioning as a co-receptor.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41586-022-05116-y\n\nView details for PubMedID 35863378\n\nAbstract\n\nSynthetic receptor signalling has the potential to endow adoptively transferred T cells with new functions that overcome major barriers in the treatment of solid tumours, including the need for conditioning chemotherapy1,2. Here we designed chimeric receptors that have an orthogonal IL-2 receptor extracellular domain (ECD) fused with the intracellular domain (ICD) of receptors for common gamma-chain (gammac) cytokines IL-4, IL-7, IL-9 and IL-21 such that the orthogonal IL-2 cytokine elicits the corresponding gammac cytokine signal. Of these, T cells that signal through the chimeric orthogonal IL-2Rbeta-ECD-IL-9R-ICD (o9R) are distinguished by the concomitant activation of STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5 and assume characteristics of stem cell memory and effector T cells. Compared to o2R T cells,o9R T cells have superior anti-tumour efficacy in two recalcitrant syngeneic mouse solid tumour models of melanoma and pancreatic cancer and are effective even in the absence of conditioning lymphodepletion. Therefore, by repurposing IL-9R signalling using a chimeric orthogonal cytokine receptor, T cells gain new functions, and this results in improved anti-tumour activity for hard-to-treat solid tumours.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41586-022-04801-2\n\nView details for PubMedID 35676488\n\nAbstract\n\nHerpesviruses are ancient large DNA viruses that have exploited gene capture as part of their strategy to escape immune surveillance, promote virus spreading, or reprogram host cells to benefit their survival. Most acquired genes are transmembrane proteins and cytokines, such as viral G protein-coupled receptors (vGPCRs), chemokines, and chemokine-binding proteins. This review focuses on the vGPCRs encoded by the human beta- and gamma-herpesviruses. These include receptors from human cytomegalovirus, which encodes four vGPCRs: US27, US28, UL33, and UL78; human herpesvirus 6 and 7 with two receptors: U12 and U51; Epstein-Barr virus with one: BILF1; and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus with one: open reading frame 74. We discuss ligand binding, signaling, and structures of the vGPCRs in light of robust differences from endogenous receptors. Finally, we briefly discuss the therapeutic targeting of vGPCRs as future treatment of acute and chronic herpesvirus infections.

Binding of IL-27 to cell surface receptors IL-27Ralpha and gp130 results in activation of receptor-associated Janus Kinases and nuclear translocation of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT3 transcription factors. Despite the emerging therapeutic importance of this cytokine axis in cancer and autoimmunity, a molecular blueprint of the IL-27 receptor signaling complex, and its relation to other gp130/IL-12 family cytokines, is currently unclear. We used cryogenic-electron microscopy to determine the quaternary structure of IL-27, composed of p28 and Ebi3 subunits, bound to receptors, IL-27Ralpha and gp130. The resulting 3.47 A resolution structure revealed a three-site assembly mechanism nucleated by the central p28 subunit of the cytokine. The overall topology and molecular details of this binding are reminiscent of IL-6 but distinct from related heterodimeric cytokines IL-12 and IL-23. These results indicate distinct receptor assembly mechanisms used by heterodimeric cytokines with important consequences for targeted agonism and antagonism of IL-27 signaling.\n\nView details for DOI 10.7554/eLife.78463\n\nView details for PubMedID 35579417\n\nAbstract\n\nBinding of arrestin to phosphorylated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is crucial for gating signaling. Once internalized some GPCRs remain stably associated with arrestin, while others interact transiently; this difference affects signaling and recycling behaviors of these GPCRs. Using cell-based and in vitro biophysical assays we examined the role of membrane phosphoinositides (PIPs) in arrestin recruitment and GPCR-arrestin complex dynamics. We find that GPCRs broadly stratify into two groups, one which requires PIP-binding for arrestin recruitment and one that does not. Plasma membrane PIPs potentiate an active conformation of arrestin and stabilize GPCR-arrestin complexes by promoting a core-engaged state of the complex. As allosteric modulators of GPCR-arrestin complex dynamics, membrane PIPs allow for additional conformational diversity beyond that imposed by GPCR phosphorylation alone. The dependance on membrane PIPs provides a mechanism for arrestin release from transiently associated GPCRs, allowing their rapid recycling, while explaining how stably associated GPCRs are able to engage G proteins at endosomes.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1096/fasebj.2022.36.S1.R6320\n\nView details for PubMedID 35553909\n\nAbstract\n\nThe design of proteins that bind to a specific site on the surface of a target protein using no information other than the three-dimensional structure of the target remains an outstanding challenge1-5. We describe a general solution to this problem which starts with a broad exploration of the very large space of possible binding modes to a selected region of a protein surface, and then intensifies the search in the vicinity of the most promising binding modes. We demonstrate its very broad applicability by de novo design of binding proteins to 12 diverse protein targets with very different shapes and surface properties. Biophysical characterization shows that the binders, which are all smaller than 65 amino acids, are hyperstable and following experimental optimization bind their targets with nanomolar to picomolar affinities. We succeeded in solving crystal structures of five of the binder-target complexes, and all five are very close to the corresponding computational design models. Experimental data on nearly half a million computational designs and hundreds of thousands of point mutants provide detailed feedback on the strengths and limitations of the method and of our current understanding of protein-protein interactions, and should guide improvement of both. Our approach now enables targeted design of binders to sites of interest on a wide variety of proteins for therapeutic and diagnostic applications.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41586-022-04654-9\n\nView details for PubMedID 35332283\n\nAbstract\n\nCytokines are powerful immune modulators that initiate signaling through receptor dimerization, but natural cytokines have structural limitations as therapeutics. We present a strategy to discover cytokine surrogate agonists by using modular ligands that exploit induced proximity and receptor dimer geometry as pharmacological metrics amenable to high-throughput screening. Using VHH and scFv to human interleukin-2/15, type-I interferon, and interleukin-10 receptors, we generated combinatorial matrices of single-chain bispecific ligands that exhibited diverse spectrums of functional activities, including potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by surrogate interferons. Crystal structures of IL-2R:VHH complexes revealed that variation in receptor dimer geometries resulted in functionally diverse signaling outputs. This modular platform enabled engineering of surrogate ligands that compelled assembly of an IL-2R/IL-10R heterodimer, which does not naturally exist, that signaled through pSTAT5 on T and natural killer (NK) cells. This \"cytokine med-chem\" approach, rooted in principles of induced proximity, is generalizable for discovery of diversified agonists for many ligand-receptor systems.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.cell.2022.02.025\n\nView details for PubMedID 35325595\n\nAbstract\n\nOrgans are anatomically compartmentalised to cater for specialised functions. In the small intestine (SI), regionalisation enables sequential processing of food and nutrient absorption. While several studies indicate the critical importance of non-epithelial cells during development and homeostasis, the extent to which these cells contribute to regionalisation during morphogenesis remains unexplored. Here, we identify a mesenchymal-epithelial crosstalk that shapes the developing SI during late morphogenesis. We find that subepithelial mesenchymal cells are characterised by gradients of factors supporting Wnt signalling and stimulate epithelial growth in vitro. Such a gradient impacts epithelial gene expression and regional villus formation along the anterior-posterior axis of the SI. Notably, we further provide evidence that Wnt signalling directly regulates epithelial expression of Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), which, in turn, acts on mesenchymal cells to drive villi formation. Taken together our results uncover a mechanistic link between Wnt and Hedgehog signalling across different cellular compartments that is central for anterior-posterior regionalisation and correct formation of the SI.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41467-022-28369-7\n\nView details for PubMedID 35132078\n\nAbstract\n\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a heterogenous autoimmune disease in which autoreactive lymphocytes attack the myelin sheath of the central nervous system (CNS). B lymphocytes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of MS patients contribute to inflammation and secrete oligoclonal immunoglobulins1,2. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection has been linked to MS epidemiologically, but its pathological role remains unclear3. Here we demonstrate high-affinity molecular mimicry between the EBV transcription factor EBNA1 and the CNS protein GlialCAM, and provide structural and in-vivo functional evidence for its relevance. A cross-reactive CSF-derived antibody was initially identified by single-cell sequencing of the paired-chain B cell repertoire of MS blood and CSF, followed by protein microarray-based testing of recombinantly expressed CSF-derived antibodies against MS-associated viruses. Sequence analysis, affinity measurements, and the crystal structure of the EBNA1-peptide epitope in complex with the autoreactive Fab fragment allowed for tracking the development of the naïve EBNA1-restricted antibody to a mature EBNA1/GlialCAM cross-reactive antibody. Molecular mimicry is facilitated by a post-translational modification of GlialCAM. EBNA1 immunization exacerbates the mouse model of MS and anti-EBNA1/GlialCAM antibodies are prevalent in MS patients. Our results provide a mechanistic link for the association between MS and EBV, and could guide the development of novel MS therapies.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41586-022-04432-7\n\nView details for PubMedID 35073561\n\nAbstract\n\nUnlike chimeric antigen receptors, T-cell receptors (TCRs) can recognize intracellular targets presented on human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules. Here we demonstrate that Tcells expressing TCRs specific for peptides from the intracellular lymphoid-specific enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), presented in the context of HLA-A*02:01, specifically eliminate primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells of T- and B-cell origin in vitro and in three mouse models of disseminated B-ALL. By contrast, the treatment spares normal peripheral T- and B-cell repertoires and normal myeloid cells in vitro, and in vivo in humanized mice. TdT is an attractive cancer target as it is highly and homogeneously expressed in 80-94% of B- and T-ALLs, but only transiently expressed during normal lymphoid differentiation, limiting on-target toxicity of TdT-specific Tcells.

Similarly, BAI adhesion-GPCRs were associated with numerous activities, but their ligands and functions remain unclear. Using unbiased approaches, we observed an unexpected convergence: RTN4 receptors are high-affinity ligands for BAI adhesion-GPCRs. A single thrombospondin type 1-repeat (TSR) domain of BAIs binds to the leucine-rich repeat domain of all three RTN4-receptor isoforms with nanomolar affinity. In the 1.65A crystal structure of the BAI1/RTN4-receptor complex, C-mannosylation of tryptophan and O-fucosylation of threonine in the BAI TSR-domains creates a RTN4-receptor/BAI interface shaped by unusual glycoconjugates that enables high-affinity interactions. In human neurons, RTN4 receptors regulate dendritic arborization, axonal elongation, and synapse formation by differential binding to glial versus neuronal BAIs, thereby controlling neural network activity. Thus, BAI binding to RTN4/NoGo receptors represents a receptor-ligand axis that, enabled by rare post-translational modifications, controls development of synaptic circuits.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.cell.2021.10.016\n\nView details for PubMedID 34758294\n\nAbstract\n\nAnaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), an aggressive CD30-positive T-cell lymphoma, comprises systemic anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive, and ALK-negative, primary cutaneous and breast implant-associated ALCL. Prognosis of some ALCL subgroups is still unsatisfactory, and already in second line effective treatment options are lacking. To identify genes defining ALCL cell state and dependencies, we here characterize super-enhancer regions by genome-wide H3K27ac ChIP-seq. In addition to known ALCL key regulators, the AP-1-member BATF3 and IL-2 receptor (IL2R)-components are among the top hits. Specific and high-level IL2R expression in ALCL correlates with BATF3 expression. Confirming a regulatory link, IL-2R-expression decreases following BATF3 knockout, and BATF3 is recruited to IL2R regulatory regions. Functionally, IL-2, IL-15 and Neo-2/15, a hyper-stable IL-2/IL-15 mimic, accelerate ALCL growth and activate STAT1, STAT5 and ERK1/2. In line, strong IL-2Ralpha-expression in ALCL patients is linked to more aggressive clinical presentation. Finally, an IL-2Ralpha-targeting antibody-drug conjugate efficiently kills ALCL cells in vitro and in vivo.

Both the number of transferred T cells and their differentiation state are critical determinants of effective responses2,3. T cells can be expanded with T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated stimulation and interleukin-2, but this can lead to differentiation into effector T cells4,5 and lower therapeutic efficacy6, whereas maintenance of a more stem-cell-like state before adoptive transfer is beneficial7. Here we show that H9T, an engineered interleukin-2 partial agonist, promotes the expansion of CD8+T cells without driving terminal differentiation. H9T led to altered STAT5 signalling and mediated distinctive downstream transcriptional, epigenetic and metabolic programs. In addition, H9T treatmentsustained the expression of T cell transcription factor1 (TCF-1) and promoted mitochondrial fitness, thereby facilitating the maintenance of a stem-cell-like state. Moreover, TCR-transgenic and chimeric antigen receptor-modified CD8+ T cells that were expanded with H9T showed robust anti-tumour activity in vivo in mousemodels of melanoma and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.

The three-track network produces structure predictions with accuracies approaching those of DeepMind in CASP14, enables the rapid solution of challenging X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM structure modeling problems, and provides insights into the functions of proteins of currently unknown structure. The network also enables rapid generation of accurate protein-protein complex models from sequence information alone, short circuiting traditional approaches which require modeling of individual subunits followed by docking. We make the method available to the scientific community to speed biological research.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1126/science.abj8754\n\nView details for PubMedID 34282049\n\nAbstract\n\nAdoptive transfer of Tregs has been shown to improve alloengraftment in animal models. However, it is technically challenging to expand Tregs ex vivo for the purpose of infusing large numbers of cells in the clinic. We demonstrate an innovative approach to engineering an orthogonal IL-2/IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) pair, the parts of which selectively interact with each other, transmitting native IL-2 signals, but do not interact with the natural IL-2 or IL-2R counterparts, thereby enabling selective stimulation of target cells in vivo. Here, we introduced this orthogonal IL-2R into Tregs. Upon adoptive transfer in a murine mixed hematopoietic chimerism model, orthogonal IL-2 injection significantly promoted orthogonal IL-2R+Foxp3GFP+CD4+ cell proliferation without increasing other T cell subsets and facilitated donor hematopoietic cell engraftment followed by acceptance of heart allografts. Our data indicate that selective target cell stimulation enabled by the engineered orthogonal cytokine receptor improves Treg potential for the induction of organ transplantation tolerance.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1172/JCI139991\n\nView details for PubMedID 33855972\n\nAbstract\n\nInterleukin-22 (IL-22) acts on epithelial cells to promote tissue protection and regeneration, but can also elicit pro-inflammatory effects, contributing to disease pathology. Here, we engineered a high-affinity IL-22 super-agonist that enabled the structure determination of the IL-22-IL-22Ralpha-IL-10Rbeta ternary complex to a resolution of 2.6A. Using structure-based design, we systematically destabilized the IL-22-IL-10Rbeta binding interface to create partial agonist analogs that decoupled downstream STAT1 and STAT3 signaling. The extent of STAT bias elicited by a single ligand varied across tissues, ranging from full STAT3-biased agonism to STAT1/3 antagonism, correlating with IL-10Rbeta expression levels. Invivo, this tissue-selective signaling drove tissue protection in the pancreas and gastrointestinal tract without inducing local or systemic inflammation, thereby uncoupling these opposing effects of IL-22 signaling. Our findings provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the cytokine pleiotropy and illustrate how differential receptor expression levels and STAT response thresholds can be synthetically exploited to endow pleiotropic cytokines with enhanced functional specificity.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.immuni.2021.03.008\n\nView details for PubMedID 33852830\n\nAbstract\n\nThrombopoietin (TPO) and the TPO-receptor (TPO-R, or c-MPL) are essential for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance and megakaryocyte differentiation. Agents that can modulate TPO-R signaling are highly desirable for both basic research and clinical utility. We developed a series of surrogate protein ligands for TPO-R, in the form of diabodies (DBs), that homodimerize TPO-R on the cell surface in geometries that are dictated by the DB receptor binding epitope, in effect \"tuning\" downstream signaling responses. These surrogate ligands exhibit diverse pharmacological properties, inducing graded signaling outputs, from full to partial TPO agonism, thus decoupling the dual functions of TPO/TPO-R. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and HSC self-renewal assays we find that partial agonistic diabodies preserved the stem-like properties of cultured HSCs, but also blocked oncogenic colony formation in essential thrombocythemia (ET) through inverse agonism. Our data suggest that dampening downstream TPO signaling is a powerful approach not only for HSC preservation in culture, but also for inhibiting oncogenic signaling through the TPO-R.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1073/pnas.2017849118\n\nView details for PubMedID 33384332\n\nAbstract\n\nTo identify disease-relevant T cell receptors (TCRs) with shared antigen specificity, we analyzed 778,938 TCRβ chain sequences from 178 non-small cell lung cancer patients using the GLIPH2 (grouping of lymphocyte interactions with paratope hotspots 2) algorithm. We identified over 66,000 shared specificity groups, of which 435 were clonally expanded and enriched in tumors compared to adjacent lung. The antigenic epitopes of one such tumor-enriched specificity group were identified using a yeast peptide-HLA A∗02:01 display library. These included a peptide from the epithelial protein TMEM161A, which is overexpressed in tumors and cross-reactive epitopes from Epstein-Barr virus and E. coli. Our findings suggest that this cross-reactivity may underlie the presence of virus-specific T cells in tumor infiltrates and that pathogen cross-reactivity may be a feature of multiple cancers. The approach and analytical pipelines generated in this work, as well as the specificity groups defined here, present a resource for understanding the T cell response in cancer.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.immuni.2021.02.014\n\nView details for PubMedID 33691136\n\nAbstract\n\nInterleukin-2 is a pleiotropic cytokine that mediates both pro- and anti-inflammatory functions. Immune cells naturally differ in their sensitivity to IL-2 due to cell type and activation state-dependent expression of receptors and signaling pathway components. To probe differences in IL-2 signaling across cell types, we used structure-based design to create and profile a series of IL-2 variants with the capacity to titrate maximum signal strength in fine increments. One of these partial agonists, IL-2-REH, specifically expanded Foxp3+ regulatory T cells with reduced activity on CD8+ T cells due to cell type-intrinsic differences in IL-2 signaling. IL-2-REH elicited cell type-dependent differences in gene expression and provided mixed therapeutic results: showing benefit in the in vivo mouse dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) model of colitis, but no therapeutic efficacy in a transfer colitis model. Our findings show that cytokine partial agonists can be used to calibrate intrinsic differences in response thresholds across responding cell types to narrow pleiotropic actions, which may be generalizable to other cytokine and growth factor systems.\n\nView details for DOI 10.7554/eLife.65777\n\nView details for PubMedID 34003116\n\nAbstract\n\nInterleukin-10 (IL-10) is an immunoregulatory cytokine with both anti-inflammatory and immunostimulatory properties and is frequently dysregulated in disease. We used a structure-based approach to deconvolute IL-10 pleiotropy by determining the structure of the IL-10 receptor (IL-10R) complex by cryo-electron microscopy at a resolution of 3.5 angstroms. The hexameric structure shows how IL-10 and IL-10Ralpha form a composite surface to engage the shared signaling receptor IL-10Rbeta, enabling the design of partial agonists. IL-10 variants with a range of IL-10Rbeta binding strengths uncovered substantial differences in response thresholds across immune cell populations, providing a means of manipulating IL-10 cell type selectivity. Some variants displayed myeloid-biased activity by suppressing macrophage activation without stimulating inflammatory CD8+ T cells, thereby uncoupling the major opposing functions of IL-10. These results provide a mechanistic blueprint for tuning the pleiotropic actions of IL-10.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1126/science.abc8433\n\nView details for PubMedID 33737461\n\nAbstract\n\nInterleukin-12 (IL-12) and IL-23 are heterodimeric cytokines that are produced by antigen-presenting cells to regulate the activation and differentiation of lymphocytes, and they share IL-12Rβ1 as a receptor signaling subunit. We present a crystal structure of the quaternary IL-23 (IL-23p19/p40)/IL-23R/IL-12Rβ1 complex, together with cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) maps of the complete IL-12 (IL-12p35/p40)/IL-12Rβ2/IL-12Rβ1 and IL-23 receptor (IL-23R) complexes, which reveal \"non-canonical\" topologies where IL-12Rβ1 directly engages the common p40 subunit. We targeted the shared IL-12Rβ1/p40 interface to design a panel of IL-12 partial agonists that preserved interferon gamma (IFNγ) induction by CD8+ T cells but impaired cytokine production from natural killer (NK) cells in vitro. These cell-biased properties were recapitulated in vivo, where IL-12 partial agonists elicited anti-tumor immunity to MC-38 murine adenocarcinoma absent the NK-cell-mediated toxicity seen with wild-type IL-12. Thus, the structural mechanism of receptor sharing used by IL-12 family cytokines provides a protein interface blueprint for tuning this cytokine axis for therapeutics.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.cell.2021.01.018\n\nView details for PubMedID 33606986\n\nAbstract\n\nCell-surface protein-protein interactions (PPIs) mediate cell-cell communication, recognition, and responses. We executed an interactome screen of 564 human cell-surface and secreted proteins, most of which are immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) proteins, using a high-throughput, automated ELISA-based screening platform employing a pooled-protein strategy to test all 318,096 PPI combinations. Screen results, augmented by phylogenetic homology analysis, revealed 380 previously unreported PPIs. We validated a subset using surface plasmon resonance and cell binding assays. Observed PPIs reveal a large and complex network of interactions both within and across biological systems. We identified new PPIs for receptors with well-characterized ligands and binding partners for \"orphan\" receptors. New PPIs include proteins expressed on multiple cell types and involved in diverse processes including immune and nervous system development and function, differentiation/proliferation, metabolism, vascularization, and reproduction.

Their actions depend on TCR recognition of peptide-MHC molecules; yet the degree of peptide specificity of Treg-cell function, and whether Treg ligands can be used to manipulate Treg cell biology are unknown. Here, we developed an Ab-peptide library that enabled unbiased screening of peptides recognized by a bona fide murine Treg cell clone isolated from the visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and identified surrogate agonist peptides, with differing affinities and signaling potencies. The VAT-Treg cells expanded in vivo by one of the surrogate agonists preserved the typical VAT-Treg transcriptional programs. Immunization with this surrogate, especially when coupled with blockade of TNFa signaling, expanded VAT-Treg cells, resulting in protection from inflammation and improved metabolic indices, including promotion of insulin sensitivity. These studies suggest that antigen-specific targeting of VAT-localized Treg cells could eventually be a strategy for improving metabolic disease.\n\nView details for DOI 10.7554/eLife.58463\n\nView details for PubMedID 32773038\n\nAbstract\n\nT cell cross-reactivity ensures that diverse pathogen-derived epitopes encountered during a lifetime are recognized by the available TCR repertoire. A feature of cross-reactivity where previous exposure to one microbe can alter immunity to subsequent, non-related pathogens has been mainly explored for viruses. Yet cross-reactivity to additional microbes is important to consider, especially in HIV infection where gut-intestinal barrier dysfunction could facilitate T cell exposure to commensal/pathogenic microbes. Here we evaluated the cross-reactivity of a 'public', HIV-specific, CD8 T cell-derived TCR (AGA1 TCR) using MHC class I yeast display technology. Via screening of MHC-restricted libraries comprising ~2*108 sequence-diverse peptides, AGA1 TCR specificity was mapped to a central peptide di-motif. Using the top TCR-enriched library peptides to probe the non-redundant protein database, bacterial peptides that elicited functional responses by AGA1-expressing T cells were identified. The possibility that in context-specific settings, MHC class I proteins presenting microbial peptides influence virus-specific T cell populations in vivo is discussed.\n\nView details for DOI 10.7554/eLife.58128\n\nView details for PubMedID 32716298\n\nAbstract\n\nInterleukin-2 (IL-2) is a small alpha-helical cytokine that regulates immune cell homeostasis through its recruitment to a high-affinity heterotrimeric receptor complex (IL-2Ralpha/IL-2Rbeta/gammac). IL-2 has been shown to have therapeutic efficacy for immune diseases by preferentially expanding distinct T cell compartments, and several regulatory T cell (Treg)-biasing anti-IL-2 antibodies have been developed for combination therapies. The conformational plasticity of IL-2 plays an important role in its biological actions by modulating the strength of receptor and drug interactions. Through an NMR analysis of milliseconds-timescale dynamics of free mouse IL-2 (mIL-2), we identify a global transition to a sparse conformation which is regulated by an alpha-helical capping \"switch\" at the loop between the A and B helices (AB loop). Binding to either an anti-mouse IL-2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) or a small molecule inhibitor near the loop induces a measurable response at the core of the structure, while locking the switch to a single conformation through a designed point mutation leads to a global quenching of core dynamics accompanied by a pronounced effect in mAb binding. By elucidating key details of the long-range allosteric communication between the receptor binding surfaces and the core of the IL-2 structure, our results offer a direct blueprint for designing precision therapeutics targeting a continuum of conformational states.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1073/pnas.2000419117\n\nView details for PubMedID 32184322\n\nAbstract\n\nAntibodies that antagonize extracellular receptor-ligand interactions are used as therapeutic agents for many diseases to inhibit signalling by cell-surface receptors1. However, this approach does not directly prevent intracellular signalling, such as through tonic or sustained signalling after ligand engagement. Here we present an alternative approach for attenuating cell-surface receptor signalling, termed receptor inhibition by phosphatase recruitment (RIPR). This approach compels cis-ligation of cell-surface receptors containing ITAM, ITIM or ITSM tyrosine phosphorylation motifs to the promiscuous cell-surface phosphatase CD452,3, which results in the direct intracellular dephosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the receptor target. As an example, we found that tonic signalling by the programmed cell death-1 receptor (PD-1) results in residual suppression of T cell activation, but is not inhibited by ligand-antagonist antibodies. We engineered a PD-1 molecule, which we denote RIPR-PD1, that induces cross-linking of PD-1 to CD45 and inhibits both tonic and ligand-activated signalling. RIPR-PD1 demonstrated enhanced inhibition of checkpoint blockade compared with ligand blocking by anti-PD1 antibodies, and increased therapeutic efficacy over anti-PD1 in mouse tumour models. We also show that the RIPR strategy extends to other immune-receptor targets that contain activating or inhibitory ITIM, ITSM or ITAM motifs; for example, inhibition of the macrophage SIRPα 'don't eat me' signal with a SIRPα-CD45 RIPR molecule potentiates antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis beyond that of SIRPα blockade alone. RIPR represents a general strategy for direct attenuation of signalling by kinase-activated cell-surface receptors.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41586-020-2851-2\n\nView details for PubMedID 33087934\n\nAbstract\n\nFrizzleds (Fzd) are the primary receptors for Wnt morphogens, which are essential regulators of stem cell biology, yet the structural basis of Wnt signaling through Fzd remains poorly understood. Here we report the structure of an unliganded human Fzd5 determined by single-particle cryo-EM at 3.7 Å resolution, with the aid of an antibody chaperone acting as a fiducial marker. We also analyzed the topology of low-resolution XWnt8/Fzd5 complex particles, which revealed extreme flexibility between the Wnt/Fzd-CRD and the Fzd-TM regions. Analysis of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in response to Wnt3a versus a 'surrogate agonist' that cross-links Fzd to LRP6, revealed identical structure-activity relationships. Thus, canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling appears to be principally reliant on ligand-induced Fzd/LRP6 heterodimerization, versus the allosteric mechanisms seen in structurally analogous class A G protein-coupled receptors, and Smoothened. These findings deepen our mechanistic understanding of Wnt signal transduction, and have implications for harnessing Wnt agonism in regenerative medicine.\n\nView details for DOI 10.7554/eLife.58464\n\nView details for PubMedID 32762848\n\nAbstract\n\nVarious species of the intestinal microbiota have been associated with the development of colorectal cancer (CRC)1,2, but it has not been demonstrated that bacteria have a direct role in the occurrence of oncogenic mutations. Escherichia coli can carry the pathogenicity island pks, which encodes a set of enzymes that synthesize colibactin3. This compound is believed to alkylate DNA on adenine residues4,5 and induces double-strand breaks in cultured cells3. Here we expose human intestinal organoids to genotoxic pks+ E. coli by repeated luminal injection over five months. Whole-genome sequencing of clonal organoids before and after this exposure revealed a distinct mutational signature that was absent from organoids injected with isogenic pks-mutant bacteria. The same mutational signature was detected in a subset of 5,876 human cancer genomes from two independent cohorts, predominantly in CRC. Our study describes a distinct mutational signature in CRC and implies that the underlying mutational process results directly from past exposure to bacteria carrying the colibactin-producing pks pathogenicity island.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41586-020-2080-8\n\nView details for PubMedID 32106218\n\nAbstract\n\nMuscarinic toxins (MTs) are natural toxins produced by mamba snakes that primarily bind to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (MAChRs) and modulate their function.

Here, we present the crystal structure of M1AChR in complex with MT7, a subtype-selective anti-M1AChR snake venom toxin. The structure reveals the molecular basis of the extreme subtype specificity of MT7 for M1AChR and the mechanism by which it regulates receptor function. Through in vitro engineering of MT7 finger regions that was guided by the structure, we have converted the selectivity from M1AChR toward M2AChR, suggesting that the three-finger fold is a promising scaffold for developing G protein-coupled receptor modulators.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1126/science.aax2517\n\nView details for PubMedID 32646996\n\nAbstract\n\nSecreted R-spondin1-4 proteins (RSPO1-4) orchestrate stem cell renewal and tissue homeostasis by potentiating Wnt/β-catenin signaling. RSPOs induce the turnover of negative Wnt regulators RNF43 and ZNRF3 through a process that requires RSPO interactions with Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptors (LGRs), or through an LGR-independent mechanism that is enhanced by RSPO binding to heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). Here, we describe the engineering of 'surrogate RSPOs' that function independently of LGRs to potentiate Wnt signaling on cell types expressing a target surface marker. These bispecific proteins were generated by fusing an RNF43- or ZNRF3-specific single chain antibody variable fragment (scFv) to the immune cytokine IL-2. Surrogate RSPOs mimic the function of natural RSPOs by crosslinking the extracellular domain (ECD) of RNF43 or ZNRF3 to the ECD of the IL-2 receptor CD25, which sequesters the complex and results in highly selective amplification of Wnt signaling on CD25+ cells. Furthermore, surrogate RSPOs were able substitute for wild type RSPO in a colon organoid growth assay when intestinal stem cells were transduced to express CD25. Our results provide proof-of-concept for a technology that may be adapted for use on a broad range of cell- or tissue-types and will open new avenues for the development of Wnt-based therapeutics for regenerative medicine.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0226928\n\nView details for PubMedID 31914456\n\nAbstract\n\nThe near-infrared-IIb (NIR-IIb) (1,500-1,700nm) window is ideal for deep-tissue optical imaging in mammals, but lacks bright and biocompatible probes. Here, we developed biocompatible cubic-phase (alpha-phase) erbium-based rare-earth nanoparticles (ErNPs) exhibiting bright downconversion luminescence at ~1,600nm for dynamic imaging of cancer immunotherapy in mice. We used ErNPs functionalized with cross-linked hydrophilic polymer layers attached to anti-PD-L1 (programmed cell death-1 ligand-1) antibody for molecular imaging of PD-L1 in a mouse model of colon cancer and achieved tumor-to-normal tissue signal ratios of ~40. The long luminescence lifetime of ErNPs (~4.6ms) enabled simultaneous imaging of ErNPs and lead sulfide quantum dots emitting in the same ~1,600nm window. In vivo NIR-IIb molecular imaging of PD-L1 and CD8 revealed cytotoxic T lymphocytes in the tumor microenvironment in response to immunotherapy, and altered CD8 signals in tumor and spleen due to immune activation.

Cytokines are a large class of soluble proteins that dimerize transmembrane receptors into precise signaling topologies, but there is a need for alternative, engineerable ligand scaffolds that specifically recognize and stabilize these protein interactions. Recombinant antibodies can potentially serve as robust and versatile platforms for cytokine complex stabilization, and their specificity allows for tunable modulation of dimerization equilibrium. Here, we devised an evolutionary strategy to isolate monovalent antibody agonists that bridge together two different receptor subunits in a cytokine-receptor complex, precisely as the receptors are disposed in their natural signaling orientations. To do this, we screened a naive antibody library against a stabilized ligand/receptor ternary complex that acted as a 'molecular cast' of the natural receptor dimer conformation. Our selections elicited 'stapler' single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) of antibodies that specifically engage the interleukin-4 receptor heterodimer. The 3.1 A resolution crystal structure of one such stapler revealed that, as intended, this scFv recognizes a composite epitope between the two receptors as they are positioned in the complex. Extending our approach, we evolved a stapler scFv that specifically binds to and stabilizes the interface between the interleukin-2 cytokine and one of its receptor subunits, leading to a 15-fold enhancement in interaction affinity. This demonstration that scFvs can be selected to recognize epitopes that span protein interfaces presents new opportunities to engineer structurally defined antibodies for a broad range of research and therapeutic applications.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1074/jbc.RA119.009213\n\nView details for PubMedID 31387945\n\nAbstract\n\nAlthough tunable signaling by G protein-coupled receptors can be exploited through medicinal chemistry, a comparable pharmacological approach has been lacking for the modulation of signaling through dimeric receptors, such as those for cytokines.

We sampled a range of EpoR geometries by varying intermonomer angle and distance, corroborated by several ligand-EpoR complex crystal structures. Across the range, we observed full, partial, and biased agonism as well as stage-selective effects on hematopoiesis.

We describe a combined computational design and experimental selection approach for generating binders targeting functional sites with large, shape complementary interfaces to read out subtle sequence differences for subtype-specific antagonism. Repeat proteins are computationally docked against a functionally relevant region of the target protein surface that varies in the different subtypes, and the interface sequences are optimized for affinity and specificity first computationally and then experimentally. We used this approach to generate a series of human Frizzled (Fz) subtype-selective antagonists with extensive shape complementary interaction surfaces considerably larger than those of repeat proteins selected from random libraries. In vivo administration revealed that Wnt-dependent pericentral liver gene expression involves multiple Fz subtypes, while maintenance of the intestinal crypt stem cell compartment involves only a limited subset.\n\nView details for PubMedID 31086346\n\nAbstract\n\nThe cytokine interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) is a central coordinator of innate and adaptive immunity, but its highly pleiotropic actions have diminished its prospects for use as an immunotherapeutic agent. Here, we took a structure-based approach to decoupling IFNgamma pleiotropy. We engineered an affinity-enhanced variant of the ligand-binding chain of the IFNgamma receptor IFNgammaR1, which enabled us to determine the crystal structure of the complete hexameric (2:2:2) IFNgamma-IFNgammaR1-IFNgammaR2 signalling complex at 3.25A resolution. The structure reveals the mechanism underlying deficits in IFNgamma responsiveness in mycobacterial disease syndrome resulting from a T168N mutation in IFNgammaR2, which impairs assembly of the full signalling complex. The topology of the hexameric complex offers a blueprint for engineering IFNgamma variants to tune IFNgamma receptor signalling output. Unexpectedly, we found that several partial IFNgamma agonists exhibited biased gene-expression profiles. These biased agonists retained the ability to induce upregulation of major histocompatibility complex class I antigen expression, but exhibited impaired induction of programmed death-ligand 1 expression in a wide range of human cancer cell lines, offering a route to decoupling immunostimulatory and immunosuppressive functions of IFNgamma for therapeutic applications.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30814731\n\nAbstract\n\nInterleukin 15 (IL-15) is an essential cytokine for the survival and proliferation of natural killer (NK) cells. IL-15 activates signaling by the β and common γ (γc) chain heterodimer of the IL-2 receptor through trans-presentation by cells expressing IL-15 bound to the α chain of the IL-15 receptor (IL-15Rα). We show here that membrane-associated IL-15Rα-IL-15 complexes are transferred from presenting cells to NK cells through trans-endocytosis and contribute to the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 and NK cell proliferation. NK cell interaction with soluble or surface-bound IL-15Rα-IL-15 complex resulted in Stat5 phosphorylation and NK cell survival at a concentration or density of the complex much lower than required to stimulate S6 phosphorylation. Despite this efficient response, Stat5 phosphorylation was reduced after inhibition of metalloprotease-induced IL-15Rα-IL-15 shedding from trans-presenting cells, whereas S6 phosphorylation was unaffected. Conversely, inhibition of trans-endocytosis by silencing of the small GTPase TC21 or expression of a dominant-negative TC21 reduced S6 phosphorylation but not Stat5 phosphorylation. Thus, trans-endocytosis of membrane-associated IL-15Rα-IL-15 provides a mode of regulating NK cells that is not afforded to IL-2 and is distinct from activation by soluble IL-15. These results may explain the strict IL-15 dependence of NK cells and illustrate how the cellular compartment in which receptor-ligand interaction occurs can influence functional outcome.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1073/pnas.1911678117\n\nView details for PubMedID 31871169\n\nAbstract\n\nColorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most frequent neoplastic disorder and is a main cause of tumor-related mortality as many patients progress to stage IV metastatic CRC. Standard care consists of combination chemotherapy (FOLFIRI or FOLFOX). Patients with WT KRAS typing are eligible to receive anti-EGFR therapy combined with chemotherapy. Unfortunately, predicting efficacy of CRC anti-EGFR therapy has remained challenging. Here we uncover that the EGFR-pathway component RasGRP1 acts as CRC tumor suppressor in the context of aberrant Wnt signaling. We find that RasGRP1 suppresses EGF-driven proliferation of colonic epithelial organoids. Having established that RasGRP1 dosage levels impacts biology, we focused on CRC patients next. Mining five different data platforms, we establish that RasGRP1 expression levels decrease with CRC progression and predict poor clinical outcome of patients. Lastly, deletion of one or two Rasgrp1 alleles makes CRC spheroids more susceptible to EGFR inhibition. Retrospective analysis of the CALGB80203 clinical trial shows that addition of anti-EGFR therapy to chemotherapy significantly improves outcome for CRC patients when tumors express low RasGRP1 suppressor levels. In sum, RasGRP1 is a unique biomarker positioned in the EGFR pathway and of potential relevance to anti-EGFR therapy for CRC patients.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1172/jci.insight.127552\n\nView details for PubMedID 31237864\n\nAbstract\n\nExperimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis is a model for multiple sclerosis. Here we show that induction generates successive waves of clonally expanded CD4+, CD8+ and γδ+ T cells in the blood and central nervous system, similar to gluten-challenge studies of patients with coeliac disease. We also find major expansions of CD8+ T cells in patients with multiple sclerosis. In autoimmune encephalomyelitis, we find that most expanded CD4+ T cells are specific for the inducing myelin peptide MOG35-55. By contrast, surrogate peptides derived from a yeast peptide major histocompatibility complex library of some of the clonally expanded CD8+ T cells inhibit disease by suppressing the proliferation of MOG-specific CD4+ T cells.

We use this strategy to design mimics of the central immune cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) that bind to the IL-2 receptor betagammac heterodimer (IL-2Rbetagammac) but have no binding site for IL-2Ralpha (also called CD25) or IL-15Ralpha (also known as CD215). The designs are hyper-stable, bind human and mouse IL-2Rbetagammac with higher affinity than the natural cytokines, and elicit downstream cell signalling independently of IL-2Ralpha and IL-15Ralpha. Crystal structures of the optimized design neoleukin-2/15 (Neo-2/15), both alone and in complex with IL-2Rbetagammac, are very similar to the designed model. Neo-2/15 has superior therapeutic activity to IL-2 in mouse models of melanoma and colon cancer, with reduced toxicity and undetectable immunogenicity.

However, the preferential distribution of type III IFN receptor on epithelial cells suggests functional differences at epithelial surfaces. Here, using human intestinal epithelial cells we could show that although both type I and type III IFNs confer an antiviral state to the cells, they do so with distinct kinetics. Type I IFN signaling is characterized by an acute strong induction of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) and confers fast antiviral protection. On the contrary, the slow acting type III IFN mediated antiviral protection is characterized by a weaker induction of ISGs in a delayed manner compared to type I IFN. Moreover, while transcript profiling revealed that both IFNs induced a similar set of ISGs, their temporal expression strictly depended on the IFNs, thereby leading to unique antiviral environments. Using a combination of data-driven mathematical modeling and experimental validation, we addressed the molecular reason for this differential kinetic of ISG expression. We could demonstrate that these kinetic differences are intrinsic to each signaling pathway and not due to different expression levels of the corresponding IFN receptors. We report that type III IFN is specifically tailored to act in specific cell types not only due to the restriction of its receptor but also by providing target cells with a distinct antiviral environment compared to type I IFN. We propose that this specific environment is key at surfaces that are often challenged with the extracellular environment.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30485383\n\nAbstract\n\nT cell receptor cross-reactivity allows a fixed T cell repertoire to respond to a much larger universe of potential antigens. Recent work has emphasized the importance of peptide structural and chemical homology, as opposed to sequence similarity, in T cell receptor cross-reactivity. Surprisingly, though, T cell receptors can also cross-react between ligands with little physiochemical commonalities. Studying the clinically relevant receptor DMF5, we demonstrate that cross-recognition of such divergent antigens can occur through mechanisms that involve heretofore unanticipated rearrangements in the peptide and presenting MHC protein, including binding-induced peptide register shifts and extensions from MHC peptide binding grooves. Moreover, cross-reactivity can proceed even when such dramatic rearrangements do not translate into structural or chemical molecular mimicry. Beyond demonstrating new principles of T cell receptor cross-reactivity, our results have implications for efforts to predict and control T cell specificity and cross-reactivity and highlight challenges associated with predicting T cell reactivities.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30224695\n\nAbstract\n\nAs antimicrobial signalling molecules, type III or lambda interferons (IFNlambdas) are critical for defence against infection by diverse pathogens, including bacteria, fungi and viruses.
