        "meta_description": "Abstract. Stratospheric aerosols are an important component of the climate system. They not only change the radiative budget of the Earth but also play an\nessential role in ozone depletion. These impacts are particularly noticeable after volcanic eruptions when SO2 injected with the eruption reaches the stratosphere, oxidizes, and forms stratospheric aerosol. There have been several studies in which a volcanic eruption plume and the associated radiative forcing were analyzed using climate models and/or data from satellite measurements. However, few have compared vertically and temporally resolved volcanic plumes using both measured and modeled data. In this paper, we compared changes in the stratospheric aerosol loading after the 2018 Ambae eruption observed by satellite remote sensing measurements and simulated by a global aerosol model. We use vertical profiles of the aerosol extinction coefficient at 869ânm retrieved at the Institute of Environmental PhysicsÂ (IUP) in Bremen from OMPS-LP (Ozone Mapping and Profiling SuiteÂ â Limb Profiler) observations. Here, we present the retrieval algorithm and a comparison of the obtained profiles with those from SAGEÂ III/ISS (Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment III on board the International Space Station). The observed differences are within 25â% for most latitude bins, which indicates a reasonable quality of the retrieved limb aerosol extinction product. The volcanic plume evolution is investigated using both monthly mean aerosol extinction coefficients and 10âd averaged data. The measurement results were compared with the model output from MAECHAM5-HAM (ECHAM for short). In order to simulate the eruption accurately, we use SO2 injection estimates from OMPS and OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) for the first phase of eruption and the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) for the second phase. Generally, the agreement between the vertical and geographical distribution of the aerosol extinction coefficient from OMPS-LP and ECHAM is quite remarkable, in particular, for the second phase. We attribute the good consistency between the model and the measurements to the precise estimation of injected SO2 mass and height, as well as to the nudging to ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis data. Additionally, we compared the radiative forcing (RF) caused by the increase in the aerosol loading in the stratosphere after the eruption. After accounting for the uncertainties from different RF calculation methods, the RFs from ECHAM and OMPS-LP agree quite well. We estimate the tropical (20ââN to 20ââS) RF from the second Ambae eruption to be about â0.13âWâmâ2.",

        "text": "The importance of stratospheric aerosols in the climate system is now well established. Stratospheric aerosols influence it both directly and indirectly. First, they change the radiative budget of the Earth by scattering back to space the incoming shortwave solar radiation and, thereby, cause a net negative radiative forcing (RF) (see, e.g.,Â Thomason and Peter,Â 2006; Kremser etÂ al.,Â 2016,Â and references therein). Second, stratospheric aerosols influence climate indirectly by participating in chemical reactions which lead to ozone depletion (see, e.g.,Â Solomon,Â 1999; Ivy etÂ al.,Â 2017; WMO,Â 2018).\n\nAerosols are present in the stratosphere all the time. Even though there is some evidence of the presence of organic particles, soot, meteoritic dust, as well as other solid particles in the stratosphere, the most abundant are the droplets of sulfuric acid with a commonly assumed weight percentage of 75â% H2SO4 and 25â% H2O. In the background state, stratospheric aerosols are formed by continuous emissions of carbonyl sulfide (OCS), dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and other sulfuric gases from the ocean surface (Kremser etÂ al.,Â 2016). However, occasionally this state is perturbed. In recent years, due to the increasing number of extreme weather events, biomass burning became a significant source of stratospheric aerosols. Thus, during large biomass burning events, such as the Australian bushfires of 2009 (Siddaway and Petelina,Â 2011) and 2019 (Khaykin etÂ al.,Â 2020), as well as the Canadian wildfires of 2017 (Khaykin etÂ al.,Â 2018; Bourassa etÂ al.,Â 2019; Kloss etÂ al.,Â 2019), sulfuric gases and other combustion products are transported into the stratosphere by convective clouds (pyrocumulonimbus;Â Fromm etÂ al.,Â 2010). Another noticeable source of stratospheric sulfur is anthropogenic fossil fuel combustion in Southeast Asia, where the aerosol precursors are transported into the stratosphere with the Asian monsoon (Randel etÂ al.,Â 2010). Although these sources, along with quiescent volcanic degassing, are undoubtedly important, the large-scale changes to the stratospheric aerosol layer are primarily driven by moderate and large volcanic eruptions which emit sulfur dioxide (SO2) directly into the upper troposphere lower stratosphere (UTLS) region (e.g.,Â Kremser etÂ al.,Â 2016; Pitari etÂ al.,Â 2016,Â and references therein).\n\nAlthough volcanic eruptions are infrequent, they still significantly influence climate in the short and long term. Consequently, it is essential to consider them in climate models. According to Solomon etÂ al. (2011); Haywood etÂ al. (2014); Schmidt etÂ al. (2018,Â and references therein), it has been shown that climate models' simulations that neglect forcing from volcanic eruptions since the year 2000 tend to project a faster rate of global warming for the first 15 years of the 21st century than the simulations including this volcanic forcing. There are numerous global aerosol model studies of historic and more recent eruptions. For example, several papers focus on the June 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo (e.g.,Â Niemeier etÂ al.,Â 2009; Feinberg etÂ al.,Â 2019; Dhomse etÂ al.,Â 2020). Some studies also evaluate more recent moderate and small eruptions of the 21st century (e.g.,Â Haywood etÂ al.,Â 2010; Kravitz etÂ al.,Â 2010, 2011; Zhu etÂ al.,Â 2018; Lurton etÂ al.,Â 2018). Similarly, there are multiple studies which use measurement results to analyze the changes in stratospheric aerosol loading, either after some event (e.g., volcanic eruptions or biomass burning events; e.g.,Â Siddaway and Petelina,Â 2011; Bourassa etÂ al.,Â 2019), or long term (e.g.,Â Bingen etÂ al.,Â 2004; vonÂ Savigny etÂ al.,Â 2015; Malinina etÂ al.,Â 2018). However, the studies, which directly compare modeled and measured aerosol parameters, are quite rare. In the papers known to the authors, the monthly mean stratospheric aerosol optical depth (SAOD) was typically the parameter used to compare models and measurements (e.g.,Â Haywood etÂ al.,Â 2010; Kravitz etÂ al.,Â 2010, 2011; Lurton etÂ al.,Â 2018). BrÃ¼hl etÂ al. (2018) used data from two satellite platforms and compared the vertically resolved aerosol extinction coefficient (Ext) at different wavelengths with model data in the period from 2002 to 2012. However, they compared spatial averages and did not focus on the plume distribution from volcanoes, assessing agreement only in general terms.\n\nThere is only a limited number of methods to observe stratospheric aerosols, and the only option to obtain a global distribution of stratospheric aerosol profiles is to use spaceborne measurements. While the first decade of the 21st century is known as the golden era of stratospheric observations with such instruments as the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE)Â II, SAGE-III/Meteor (Damadeo etÂ al.,Â 2013), the SCanning Imaging Absorption SpectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY;Â Gottwald and Bovensmann,Â 2011), the Global Ozone Monitoring by Occultation of Stars (GOMOS;Â Bertaux etÂ al.,Â 2004), and the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS;Â Fischer etÂ al.,Â 2008) being on orbit, currently there is a very limited number of spaceborne missions which can be used to retrieve stratospheric aerosol information. At the time of writing, only the Optical Spectrograph and InfraRed Imager System (OSIRIS;Â Llewellyn etÂ al.,Â 2004), the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO;Â Vernier etÂ al.,Â 2011), the Ozone Mapping and Profiling Suite (OMPS) and the SAGE-III on board the International Space Station (ISS) continue stratospheric aerosol measurements. At the same time, OSIRIS and CALIPSO launched in 2001 and 2006, respectively, are now well beyond their intended lifetimes. Consequently, in this paper, in order to obtain stratospheric aerosol characteristics, we use data from the OMPS instrument.\n\nModel intercomparison studies (e.g.,Â Clyne etÂ al.,Â 2021) revealed strong differences between the results of the evolution of the volcanic cloud from different models. Aerosol microphysical processes are highly nonlinear and, for example, differences in transport can result in quite different particle distribution and size. Similarly, differences in microphysical processes between the models can have a strong impact on simulated forcing. Therefore, comparing model results with satellite products can lead to improvements in the model results, and in turn, model results can also help to improve satellite products.\n\nThe scope of our study is to investigate the similarities and differences in how models and measurements show a volcanic plume evolution. For this reason, we used the time- and altitude-resolved Ext data retrieved from the limb viewing instrument OMPS-LP and the output from the MAECHAM5-HAM (hereafter ECHAM) model. We also study the differences in the modeled RF and that calculated from the measured data. Our study was conducted on the example of the 2018 Ambae eruption. This particular eruption was chosen because it was one of the strongest in the last decade, although it did not receive as much attention as the KÄ«lauea eruption earlier that year or the 2019 Raikoke eruption.\n\nAmbae (or Aoba) island is located in the South Pacific in Vanuatu (15.39ââS, 167.84ââE), and it is a shield volcano with three lakes in its caldera. According to Moussallam etÂ al. (2019,Â and references therein), the previous significant Ambae eruption happened about 350Â years ago. This information is consistent with that from the Smithsonian Institution (2019), according to which the active period of 2017â2018 was the strongest ever for this volcano. This period started on 6Â September 2017 and lasted over a year, ending on 30Â October 2018. The researchers divide the eruption into four phases (Moussallam etÂ al.,Â 2019); however, for the stratospheric aerosol community, the most important are the third and the fourth phases, when SO2 was injected above the tropopause. The third phase, from mid-March to mid-April 2018, is associated with ash falls and acid rains, and the largest SO2 injection of the period occurred on 6Â April at 16â18âkm altitude. However, the fourth phase in mid-July 2018 was more severe. Thus, on 27Â July 2018, along with ash, SO2 was injected into the UTLS region (17âkm). For consistency reasons, further in the text âthe firstâ or âApril eruptionâ refers to the third phase, and âthe secondâ or âJuly eruptionâ defines the fourth phase.\n\nThe paper is structured as follows. In Sect.Â 2, spaceborne instruments used in this study and the ECHAM model are presented. The observational data sets, including the estimation of SO2 injection from the eruptions, OMPS-LP retrieval algorithm, and the comparison of OMPS-LP data with the data from SAGEÂ III/ISS can be found in Sect.Â 3. The evolution of the aerosol plume after the Ambae eruption, as seen by OMPS-LP and modeled by ECHAM, is described in Sect.Â 4. In Sect.Â 4.2, our estimations on the RF after the eruption are presented. The conclusions of the paper are provided in Sect.Â 5.\n\n3.1âEstimation of SO2 injection\n\nIn order to simulate the Ambae eruptions, as a first step, the amount of SO2 that is emitted and the injection altitude should be determined. Although there are methods to retrieve SO2 mass and altitude from nadir measurements, it is well known that these methods do not allow one to distinguish whether SO2 was released into the stratosphere or into the upper troposphere (see, e.g.,Â Carboni etÂ al.,Â 2016). Carboni etÂ al. (2016) suggest that the combination of limb and nadir instruments might give a better answer. For this reason, in our work we used a combination of MLS (see Sect.Â 2.4) and nadir SO2 products to determine the altitude and the mass of SO2 injection.\n\nTo assess the Ambae SO2 burden and plume location, combined OMI (Sect.Â 2.5) and OMPS-NM (Sect.Â 2.2) data were used for the April eruption. Yet for the July eruption, data from TROPOMI (Sect.Â 2.6) were taken into consideration. We did not use the same SO2 satellite product for both eruptive episodes for two reasons. First, the TROPOMI data with a fine grid and extensive coverage are publicly available from early May 2018, thus missing the first eruption. Second, even though the combined OMI and OMPS-NM data set temporally covers both eruption phases, it contains spatial gaps, which results in a less precise SO2 mass assessment (see AppendixÂ C). Thus, the current choice provides a trade-off between the spatial coverage and overall data availability.\n\nFor the injection altitude estimation, MLS SO2 number density profiles and tropopause altitude were used. Using the plume location from OMI/OMPS-NM and TROPOMI data (see below), the profiles collocated with the plumes for April and July 2018 were analyzed. Using this data, it was identified that, on 6Â April and the 27Â July, the volcanic SO2 reached the stratosphere. These days coincide with the information presented by Moussallam etÂ al. (2019); Kloss etÂ al. (2020); Smithsonian Institution (2019). The profiles for the eruption dates can be found in AppendixÂ A1.\n\n3.1.1âCombined OMI and OMPS-NM data set\n\nFor the first eruption, OMI SO2 levelÂ 2 data with the assumption of an SO2 distribution in the lower stratosphere (center of mass altitude of 18âkm; Li etÂ al.,Â 2017) was used. Due to the OMI row anomaly (see Sect.Â 2.5), all rowsÂ >â21 (counting starts at 0) were excluded. The first 10 rows were discarded in order to limit the across-track pixel width (Fioletov etÂ al.,Â 2016) so that only rows 10â21 were considered. Only the measurements obtained at solar zenith angles less than 70â were used. SO2 total columns with large negative values below â1âÃâ1030âDU were not included in the analysis. After converting the data from Dobson units to grams per square meter (hereafter DU toÂ gâmâ2) a threshold of 0.05âgâmâ2 (1.75âDU) was introduced to distinguish the volcanic signal from the background. All satellite pixels that fulfilled the above requirements were averaged for each segment of the self-defined grid (see below). The SO2 mass loading in grams per square meter (hereafter gâmâ2) was multiplied with the segment area to obtain the SO2 mass in units of grams for every grid segment. All orbits measured on 1âd were combined so that the SO2 mass in each segment for a specific day was determined.\n\nOMPS-NM levelÂ 2 data with the SO2 column for the lower stratosphere (16âkm) was used accordingly. Pixels at the edges of the swath were discarded, excluding rowsÂ <â2 and rowsÂ >â33 (counting starts atÂ 0;Â Fioletov etÂ al.,Â 2020; Zhang etÂ al.,Â 2017). Only data with a pixel quality flag equal toÂ 0 and a solar zenith angle less than 84â were used. Again, the SO2 data were converted from DU toÂ gâmâ2 and a threshold of 0.05âgâmâ2 was applied before the pixels were averaged for each grid segment, and the SO2 mass per day for each grid segment was determined, as described above for the OMI data.\n\nThe daily OMI and OMPS data were projected on a self-defined grid with a resolution of 0.5â and averaged for each segment. The grid dimensions were chosen from 150ââE to 140ââW and 10ââN to 45ââS for the April eruption. The data were summed up over the entire grid to determine the total SO2 mass for each day in this area. The results for the period from the beginning of March until the end of April 2018 are presented in Fig.Â 1a with the blue line. The estimate for the day when SO2 reached the stratosphere is marked with a red circle. The daily data coverage in percent, or the percentage of the self-defined grid that contains data that could be used for the analysis, is depicted on the same panel with the gray line. Due to the large data gaps, this SO2 mass is a minimum estimate for the SO2 injected during the eruption.\n\nThe largest source of error for estimating the SO2 emission is probably the choice of the assumed SO2 profile because the vertical distribution of the SO2 affects the air mass factor used for the retrieval of the vertical column densities.\n\n3.1.2âTROPOMI data set\n\nThe SO2 mass emitted during the eruption of Ambae in late July 2018 was estimated by analyzing SO2 total vertical columns from the TROPOMI instrument (see Sect.Â 2.6). A grid with a resolution of 0.1â in both longitude and latitude was defined from 10ââN to 35ââS and 150ââE to 140ââW. We utilized sulfur dioxide total vertical columns, assuming an SO2 profile represented by a 1âkm thick box filled with SO2 and centered at 15âkm altitude, in order to model conditions in an explosive eruptionÂ (Theys etÂ al.,Â 2017). Only vertical column densities with values less than 1000âmolâmâ2 were considered for the analysis. The data above this threshold were excluded because they were considered unrealistic and erroneous. Furthermore, a solar zenith angle less than 70â (for the SO2 products that use an SO2 box profile) or a quality value greater than 0.5 (for the SO2 product that uses TM5 model profile), respectively, was required (Theys etÂ al.,Â 2020). The TM5 model is a global chemical transport model that provides a daily forecast of SO2 profiles (Theys etÂ al.,Â 2017). The total vertical column was multiplied by the SO2 molar mass to obtain the SO2 mass loading in the units ofÂ gâmâ2. Afterwards, similarly to Sect.Â 3.1.1, a threshold of 0.05âgâmâ2 was applied, and the SO2 mass in units of grams for every grid segment was calculated. Since some orbits overlap, 14Â consecutive orbits covering a time span of approximately 24âh were bundled to a data set batch and averaged for each grid segment. Finally, the SO2 masses in all grid segments in the batch are summed up to obtain the total SO2 burden.\n\nThe SO2 masses calculated for every batch and for the thresholds of 0.05âgâmâ2 during the Ambae eruption are presented in Fig.Â 1b. The date represents the date of the first orbit in each batch that intersects with the area of interest. With the red circle, the day SO2 reached the stratosphere, according to MLS data, is marked, while the data cover is depicted with a gray line. The SO2 mass increased to a maximum of 0.35âTg on 27Â July and declined, by 5Â August, to magnitudes of gigagram (hereafter Gg). The SO2 mass for a threshold of 0âgâmâ2 (not shown) exhibits a high SO2 background of 0.1â0.15âTg that quickly increases to a maximum of 0.51âTg on 27Â July and decreases to 0.1âTg on 5Â August. The application of a threshold of 0âgâmâ2 seems to suggest an SO2 background of approximately 0.1â0.15âTg that is not apparent in Fig.Â 1 when using a more restrictive threshold. Focusing only on the additional SO2 entry, i.e., the difference between the maximum SO2 and the background emission of 0.1â0.15âTg, a total burden of approximately 0.35â0.4âTg SO2 was emitted, applying a threshold of 0âgâmâ2. This result is comparable to the maximal SO2 burden in Fig.Â 1.\n\nFurthermore, the calculated maximum of emitted SO2 mass strongly depends on the SO2 data product used. As mentioned in Sect.Â 3.1.1, the vertical SO2 distribution affects the air mass factor that is used to retrieve the vertical column densities. Assuming a threshold of 0.05âgâmâ2 and an SO2 profile with the SO2 existing in a 1âkm thick box at an altitude of 15âkm, as discussed above, results in the maximal SO2 mass of 0.35âTg. This value increases, respectively, to 0.5âTg and even to approximately 1.3âTg by assuming, respectively, a 1âkm thick box at an altitude of 7âkm and a profile from the TM5 model. These results emphasize the importance of an accurate assumption for the vertical SO2 distribution (see AppendixÂ B).\n\n3.2âOMPS-LP Ext retrieval algorithm\n\nAs can be inferred from its name, initially OMPS was designed to obtain ozone products, and in the instrument design, the UV-Vis parts of the spectrum were prioritized. As the prism dispersion is nonlinear, the spectral resolution of the measurements at the wavelength longer than 500ânm degrades exponentially, reaching about 30ânm at 1000ânm. This results in the situation that the usual stratospheric aerosol extinction wavelength 750ânm, used by, for example, SCIAMACHY and OSIRIS (Rieger etÂ al.,Â 2018), is not suitable for use as OMPS-LP measurements around this wavelength are affected by the O2-A absorption band. Thus, for the stratospheric aerosol extinction retrieval, instead of 750ânm, we used the measurements at 869ânm (with a spectral resolution of 22ânm) because the spectral interval from 830 to 900ânm is absorption free.\n\nEven though some aspects of our algorithm have been briefly described in Arosio etÂ al. (2018) and Malinina (2019), here we provide a consolidated summary. The OMPS V1.0.9 aerosol extinction coefficient at 869ânm (Ext869) retrieval algorithm was adapted from the SCIAMACHY V1.4 algorithm (Rieger etÂ al.,Â 2018) and uses the same regularized iterative approach. However, here we used the first-order Tikhonov regularization with the parameter value of 50 to smooth spurious oscillations in the level 1 V2.5 data. Using the information provided by NASA, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is set to 500 for all tangent altitudes.\n\nIn V1.0.9, Ext869 is retrieved on a regular 1âkm grid from 10.5 to 33.5âkm, with the measurement at 34.5âkm being used as the reference. Additionally, the effective Lambertian albedo is simultaneously retrieved using the Sun-normalized spectrum at 34.5âkm. The retrieval is done under the assumption of stratospheric aerosols being spherical sulfate droplets (75â% H2SO4 and 25â% H2O) with 0â% relative humidity and unimodal lognormal particle size distribution (PSD). In this distribution the median radius (rmed) is equal to 0.08âÂµm and Ïâ=â1.6; the particle number density aÂ priori profile was chosen in accordance with the Extinction Coefficient for STRatospheric Aerosol (ECSTRA) background climatology (Fussen and Bingen,Â 1999). We used the refractive indices from the OPAC (Optical Properties of Aerosols and Clouds) database (Hess etÂ al.,Â 1998); for the selected wavelength, the refractive index equals 1.425â1.38597âÃâ10â7i. The stratospheric aerosol profile is defined from 10 to 46âkm; below and above, the number density profile is set toÂ 0. After the retrieval, the Ext869 values higher than 0.1âkmâ1 are considered to be cloud contaminated and, thus, are filtered.\n\nThe threshold to reject clouds is selected empirically to keep as much as possible of an event associated with increased Ext and reject as many clouds as possible. However, the trade-off between these two factors is determined by the potential application of the data set. For instance, for applications where it is more important to remove as many clouds as possible and single high aerosol peaks are not of a great value, a rather conservative value of 0.002âkmâ1 is recommended. This value is based on the results from Bourassa etÂ al. (2010), where the Ext750 after the Kasatochi eruption did not exceed 0.001âkmâ1. This threshold was used in, e.g., Malinina (2019). However, it was noticed that, by implementing the 0.002âkmâ1 threshold, some profiles with increased aerosol loading were incorrectly filtered for some case studies. Thus, for an investigation of an isolated volcanic eruption, a higher threshold is necessary to preserve all increased Ext values. The 0.1âkmâ1 value used in this study is based on the experience with the 2019 Raikoke eruption (Muser etÂ al.,Â 2020). For the user's convenience, the products with both cloud filters (0.002 and 0.1âkmâ1) are provided.\n\n3.3âComparison of OMPS-LP and SAGEÂ III/ISS\n\nThe OMPS-LP Ext869 was originally retrieved to improve the ozone product (Arosio etÂ al.,Â 2018); however, it can also be used to evaluate the changes in stratospheric aerosol loading after volcanic eruptions and biomass burning events (Malinina,Â 2019). Here, it should be noted that there are three other OMPS aerosol extinction products; two of them are the official NASA Ext675 products, i.e., V1.0 (Loughman etÂ al.,Â 2018) and V1.5 (Chen etÂ al.,Â 2018). Moreover, at the University of Saskatchewan, as a part of the ozone retrieval, a tomographic Ext750 product was obtained (Bourassa etÂ al.,Â 2019). All four Ext products were retrieved at different wavelengths and using different approaches. Thus, their comparison will be not trivial and will contain uncertainties, e.g., associated with Ã ngstrÃ¶m exponent calculations.\n\nIn order to evaluate the quality of our Ext869, it was compared with the SAGEÂ III/ISS solar occultation product. There are several advantages to this comparison. First, SAGEÂ III is an independent data set; thus, possible OMPS instrumental issues (e.g., scattering angle dependency) will be revealed by the comparison, which would not be the case when using other OMPS products. Second, SAGEÂ III is an occultation instrument, which means that its Ext profiles are rather precise and independent of the aerosol PSD assumption, in contrast to, for example, OSIRIS. The solar occultation measurements are self-calibrating, and unlike limb instruments, for the Ext retrieval, no assumptions on the aerosol particle size distribution are needed, thus making occultation measurements rather precise.\n\nAnother advantage of the comparison with SAGEÂ III is the same measurement wavelength. Both OMPS-LP and SAGEÂ III provide measurements at 869ânm, so no conversion of the aerosol extinction to any other wavelength needs to be done. Even though the spectral resolution of the instruments at this wavelength is different (1.5ânm in SAGEÂ III versus 30ânm in OMPS-LP), it does not influence the aerosol extinction coefficient strongly because the wavelength interval from 830 to 900ânm is absorption free.\n\nFor the comparison, individual profiles from 7Â June 2017 until 31Â August 2019 were used. The profiles were collocated using the following criteria: the difference between the profile's coordinates should be less than 2.5â in latitude, 10â in longitude, and 24âh in time. The minimal time difference between profiles was 01:47:37âh, while the maximum difference is 22:07:38âh. Overall, there are 19â264 collocated measurements used for this comparison. For SAGEÂ III data, similarly to OMPS, the aerosol extinction values higher than 0.1âkmâ1 were filtered out. Additionally, the SAGEÂ III Ext869 values were excluded if the uncertainty provided by NASA is higher than 50â%. We did not filter negative Ext869 because this would bias the comparison (see Damadeo etÂ al. (2013) for details).\n\nThe mean relative differences between OMPS and SAGEÂ III Ext869 are presented in Fig.Â 2 in 20â latitude bins. For most of the altitudes in all latitude bins, the relative difference is within 25â%. In the tropical and midlatitudes, the only exceptions are the altitudes below 18âkm, where, despite filtering, the influence of clouds is still present. The largest differences are observed in high latitudes (40â to 80â in both hemispheres), in particular at the altitudes above 24âkm. For example, at about 28âkm altitude, the differences reach up to 60â% in these latitude bins.\n\nGenerally, the above-described differences are similar to the relative differences between SCIAMACHY V1.4, OSIRIS v5.07, and SAGEÂ II v7 (Rieger etÂ al.,Â 2018; Malinina,Â 2019). Additionally, Chen etÂ al. (2020) showed that the differences seen between the OMPS Ext675 V1.5 and SAGEÂ III product have the same shape and order of magnitude. Rieger etÂ al. (2018) studied precisely the reasons for the observed differences. Since the OMPS V1.0.9 algorithm is very similar to the SCIAMACHY V1.4 algorithm used in that study, and since the OMPS and SCIAMACHY have very similar geometries, the same explanations, as given by Rieger etÂ al. (2018), are appropriate. According to this study, the most important sources of errors in limb retrievals arise from the uncertainly assumed aerosol loading at the reference tangent altitude and the unknown aerosol particle size distribution parameters. The latter factor mostly affects the high latitudes where the viewing geometries are close to forward and backward scattering.\n\nBased on our comparison and the results from the other limb-occultation instrument studies, it can be concluded that our OMPS V1.0.9 Ext869 is of sufficient quality to be used for scientific purposes.\n\n3.4âOMPS-LP aerosol extinction climatology\n\nIn order to study the aerosol extinction coefficient evolution after a volcanic eruption, the OMPS V1.0.9 product has to be averaged in some fashion. We have created two level 3Â products, which are monthly and 10âd averaged Ext869. Both products were binned onto a regular geographical grid with 2.5â latitude and 5â longitude steps. Since the retrieved product is provided on the regular 1âkm grid, no vertical averaging is needed.\n\nAn example of zonal monthly mean Ext869 averaged in 30â latitude bins for the whole OMPS operation period is presented in Fig.Â 3. In this figure, the volcanic eruptions and a relevant biomass burning event are shown with gray triangles with numbers. The information on the volcanic eruptions is presented in TableÂ 1. We show only Ext869 within 60â in both hemispheres because, as it was pointed out in Sect.Â 3.3, the aerosol extinctions above these latitudes are associated with larger uncertainties. Furthermore, the main scope of this paper is to study the tropical Ambae eruptions; thus, we do not focus our attention on aerosol loading in the high latitudes.\n\nAnalysis of Fig.Â 3 shows that there is a certain increase in Ext869 at the very beginning of OMPS operation in the Northern Hemisphere in the bin between 60â and 30â. This is associated with the eruption of Nabro (13ââN) in the middle of 2011. Additionally, one can see an increase in Ext869 some time after the eruptions in TableÂ 1 and from the Canadian wildfires of 2017 (numberÂ 5 in Fig.Â 3 and TableÂ 1). The degree of the enhancement, and the time lag between the eruptions seen in the latitude bands, are dependent on the volcano's location and the eruption strength. Usually, for the tropical eruptions, an increase in stratospheric aerosol loading is seen globally because the aerosols and precursors are transported with the BrewerâDobson circulation (BDC) to both hemispheres. Also, in the Tropics, the BDC is responsible for the tape recorder effect or the delayed increase in Ext869 with height (Vernier etÂ al.,Â 2011). For example, in Fig.Â 3a andÂ b, the tape recorder effect is seen for the Kelut, Sangeang Api, Calbuco, and Ambae eruptions, as well as for the Canadian wildfires. For the eruptions in the midlatitudes, the increase usually stays in the hemisphere where it occurred (e.g.,Â Oman etÂ al.,Â 2006; vonÂ Savigny etÂ al.,Â 2015; Toohey etÂ al.,Â 2019; Malinina,Â 2019).\n\nAnother readily identifiable feature in Fig.Â 3 is the periodical increase in Ext in all latitude bins. There are several drivers causing this pattern. The annual seasonality, which is seen as yearly reoccurring lighter colored stripes, in both Tropics and midlatitudes is related to two factors. First, there are some yearly changes in stratospheric aerosol loading (Hitchman etÂ al.,Â 1994; Bingen etÂ al.,Â 2004). Second, for the limb-viewing instruments, an important factor is the seasonality in solar scattering angle, which leads to artifacts of the retrieval predominately in the extratropical regions (see, e.g.,Â Rieger etÂ al.,Â 2018). Additionally, for the tropical region, there is a periodic signal above 25âkm altitude associated with the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). It can be seen in the thin white line, which represents the 0.00005âkmâ1 Ext869 level. However, as with the other altitudes, this Ext869 level is somewhat affected by the annual variation in addition to the QBO. Here, it is important to mention that, during the OMPS operation period, two QBO disruptions were reported, namely in 2015â2016 (Newman etÂ al.,Â 2016) and 2019â2020 (Kang and Chun,Â 2021). These disruptions might also mask the changes in the high-altitude extinctions. Generally, the influence of the QBO on stratospheric aerosols is well known and was previously reported by, e.g., Vernier etÂ al. (2011); Hommel etÂ al. (2015); Brinkhoff etÂ al. (2015); vonÂ Savigny etÂ al. (2015); Malinina etÂ al. (2018).\n\nOne should also mention the increase in the extinction at approximately 16.5â17âkm in Fig.Â 3a andÂ b and at around 13.5â15âkm in Fig.Â 3c andÂ d. These are the residual clouds which were not filtered by our threshold. Though we show the data in Fig.Â 3 above the average tropopause height for the bin, some overshooting convective clouds still could be present and influence an average Ext. Here we want to highlight that we are aware of disadvantages of our fixed cloud filtering threshold, which can also be considered quite high. As we state above in Sect.Â 3.2, our previous threshold was too low and was filtering out parts of volcanic and forest fires plumes. Furthermore, any fixed threshold would either filter out some high-extinction events or leave some fractions of cloud in. However, the other commonly used cloud filtering approach exploiting altitude derivative of spectral ratio also suffers from poor discrimination under certain conditions (Chen etÂ al.,Â 2016; Rieger etÂ al.,Â 2019).\n\nArosio, C., Rozanov, A., Malinina, E., Eichmann, K.-U., von Clarmann, T., and Burrows, J.
