        "text": "Thierry Forveille\n\nThierry Forveille is an astronomer at Observatoire de Grenoble, which is part of the University of Grenoble, in Southeastern France. His primary research interest is to understand how planets form around stars. He studies both the disks in which those planets (will) form, using ALMA and the IRAM telescopes, and the resulting planet populations around mature very low mass stars, using primarily radial velocity monitoring. He is is excited about the many new tools that are becoming available or being built to find and characterize extrasolar planets.\n\nForveille studied physics at Ecole Normale Superieure, in Paris, and did his PhD thesis work at the University of Grenoble, with an interruption while he helped commission the IRAM 30m telescope near Granada, Spain. He became an assistant astronomer at Observatoire de Grenoble immediately after his PhD and has worked there ever since, except for a six years stint at the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope in Hawaii. He became an associate editor of Astronomy & Astrophysics in 2006 and has been the editor in chief of the journal since 2012.\n\nAssociate Editor-in-Chief\n\nJoão Alves\n\nDavid Elbaz\n\nDavid Elbaz is director of research in the Astrophysics Department of the CEA Saclay. His primary research interest is to understand how galaxies formed their stars, with an emphasis on the hidden side of star-formation due to dust-obscuration, and what caused the rise and fall of star formation in galaxies at cosmic scales. His work on the study of galaxy formation and evolution has been awarded the Chrétien Award from the American Astronomical Society in 2000 and the Jaffé Award from the French Academy of Sciences (Fondation de l'Institut de France) in 2017.\n\nHe has been the head of the \"Cosmology and Galaxy Evolution\" laboratory from 2001 to 2019 and a member of the Astronomy Working Group advising the European Space Agency for the selection of its future satellites from 2015 to 2018. Since 2017, he is the president of the Scientific Council of the National Program on Cosmology and Galaxies for CNRS-INSU, France. He is a member of the SPICA satellite Science Study Team for ESA and co-leads the Science Working Group on Galaxies for the Euclid satellite. He has been the managing editor of Astronomy & Astrophysics since 2018.\n\nJoão Alves\n\nJoão Alves is a professor of stellar astrophysics at the University of Vienna, in Austria. His primary research interest is to understand how diffuse interstellar gas clouds form, evolve, and eventually collapse to form stars and planets. He is excited about the exploration of the European Space Agency’s newly released Gaia satellite data, the upcoming European Extremely Large Telescope, and the search for intelligent life in the universe.\n\nAlves studied physics at Universidade de Lisboa, in Portugal, did his PhD thesis work at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, and moved to Münich, Germany, to become a European Southern Observatory (ESO) fellow. He became an ESO staff member and head of the visiting astronomers section before moving to southern Spain to take the directorship of the German–Spanish Astronomical Center at Calar Alto. In addition to his professorship at University of Vienna, which he has held since 2010, Alves is the vice-dean of the Faculty of Earth Sciences, Geography and Astronomy. He is a corresponding member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, sits on the ESO Council, and serves as the Astronomy & Astrophysics letters editor in chief.\n\nAssociate Letters Editor-in-Chief\n\nThierry Forveille\n\nSergio Campana\n\nSergio Campana is Dirigente di Ricerca (full astronomer) at the INAF - Osservatorio astronomico di Brera, in Merate Italy. His primary research interest is in high-energy astrophysics, working on X-ray binaries, Gamma-ray bursts, tidal disruption events, and magnetars. He worked on source detection algorithms in X-ray images. He is also active in technology. He contributed building the X-ray telescope (XRT) onboard the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (of which he is responsible for the instrument calibrations) and is the Principal Investigator of the Son of X-shooter (SOXS) spectrometer to be installed at the New Technology Telescope (NTT) at ESO-La Silla.\n\nCampana studied physics at the Università di Pavia with a thesis on quantum gravity and did his PhD thesis at the Università di Milano on accretion onto compact objects. After one year of short visits around, he got a first a temporary position and then a permanent position at the Osservatorio astronomico di Brera and has worked there ever since.

He became an associate editor of Astronomy & Astrophysics in 2015.\n\nFrançoise Combes\n\nFrançoise Combes is professor in College de France, on the chair “Galaxies and Cosmology”. She is an astrophysicist at Paris Observatory, and member of the Academy of Sciences. Her main areas of research are the formation and evolution of galaxies, their dynamics and co-evolution with supermassive black holes, the interstellar medium of galaxies and dark matter models. By her computer simulations, she was the first to discover the mechanism to form bulges in spiral galaxies, through vertical bar resonances. She was also a pioneer in molecular absorptions in front of remote quasars, leading to constraints on fundamental constants variation.\n\nFrançoise Combes studied physics at Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS), in Paris, and became ENS assistant professor in 1975. She was deputy director of the Physics Laboratory in Ecole Normale Supérieure from 1985 to 1989, and became an astronomer in Paris Observatory in 1989.

He became an associate editor of Astronomy & Astrophysics in 2018.\n\nDavid Mouillet\n\nDavid Mouillet is an astronomer at Grenoble Observatory. His main field of research is exoplanetary systems observed in direct imaging and spectroscopy. The challenge in angular resolution and contrast to observe such systems motivates a strong investment in instrumentation, from upstream R&D exploring new concepts to operational instruments, involving adaptive optics, coronagraphy and/or interferometry.\n\nAfter a PhD in Grenoble, and some contributions on VLT/NAOS adaptive optics system or VLTI/AMBER 3 beam interferometric combiner, David was the director of 2-m telescope B. Lyot in French Pyrénées (2003-2006). He was then the Project Scientist of VLT/SPHERE high contrast imager (2006-2015) up to on-sky validation.

In her work she mainly exploits spectroscopic data from large ground based telescopes such as VLT and ALMA, in combination with HST observations. She has led many large observational programs including one of the latest ESO public spectroscopic surveys.\n\nPentericci studied physics at the University of Bologna then moved to Leiden where she obtained her PhD in astrophysics. After 4 years at the MPIA of Heidelberg as a postdoctoral fellow, she moved back to Italy becoming a permanent INAF staff of the Observatory of Rome.

His primary research focuses on the physics of the solar wind, an out-of-equilibrium semi-collisional plasma that remains poorly understood. In particular, understanding its acceleration and heating is a persistent and challenging astrophysical problem.\n\nZouganelis studied physics at the University of Athens (Greece), did his PhD at the Observatoire de Meudon (France) and was a Marie Curie fellow at the Space Sciences Laboratory in Berkeley (USA). From 2008 to 2013 he was an associate professor of Astrophysics at the University Pierre and Marie Curie in Paris, before moving to ESA.
