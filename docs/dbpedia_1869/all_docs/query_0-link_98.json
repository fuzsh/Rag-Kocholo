        "text": "Seoul: where the past and present coexist\n\nSituated in the central region of the Korean Peninsula, Seoul serves as the capital and the largest city in Korea. A lively metropolis teeming with both cultural heritage and modern attributes, it stands as the perfect locale to immerse yourself in both Korea's historical legacy and contemporary milieu. Notably, Seoul showcases numerous meticulously preserved historical treasures and sites, such as Gyeongbokgung Palace and Deoksugung Palace. These royal Joseon palaces carry an illustrious history spanning over 600 years, offering an immersive experience into Korea's past. Furthermore, Seoul takes the lead as a modern cultural epicenter propelling the global sensation known as K-pop.\n\nIn addition to its cultural significance, Seoul boasts captivating natural vistas, even within its urban confines. The majestic Han River courses through the city's heart, while the Namsan, Inwangsan, and Bukaksan mountains elegantly embrace its northern and southern boundaries. Notably, the Seoul Forest and the Hangang Citizens' Park sit in close proximity to bustling urban centers, affording citizens and visitors a chance to be in close communion with nature and to relish its myriad benefits. As the cultural, political, and economic hub of a vibrant and dynamic liberal democracy of 51+ million people, Seoul consistently ranks among one of the world's safest cities.\n\nKorea\n\nLocated in Northeast Asia, the Korean Peninsula shares borders with China, Russia, and Japan. Its coordinates range from 33 to 43 degrees north latitude and from 124 to 132 degrees east longitude. The peninsula, encompassing both North and South Korea, spans 1,000 km in length and 300 km in average width, with a total land area of around 222,000 km2. South Korea's land area (below the Military Demarcation Line) is approximately 100,364 km2.\n\nAround 75% of the terrain consists of mountains, creating topographical variation. Korea has higher elevations in the east and lower ones in the west. Tall mountains exceeding 1,000 m are concentrated in the north and east, forming the country's topographical backbone. The eastern mountainsides are steeper compared to the western coast.\n\nKorea is bordered by water on three sides, except for the north. The combined coastline extends for 17,000 km, including islands. The East Sea is marked by deep waters and simpler coastlines, while the West and South Seas feature shallower waters, intricate coastlines, and more islands. Each sea offers unique characteristics. There is the pristine and deep East Sea, the mud flats teeming with life in the West Sea, and then the South Sea with its multitude of islands, earning the nickname \"Dadohae,\" or the “Sea of Many Islands.”"
