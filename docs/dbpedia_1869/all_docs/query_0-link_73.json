        "meta_description": "Abstract. Measurements of atmospheric temperatures show a variety of long-term\noscillations. These can be simulated by computer models and exhibit\nmulti-annual, decadal, and even centennial periods. They extend from the\nground up to the lower thermosphere. Recent analyses have shown that they\nexist in the models even if the model boundaries are kept constant with\nrespect to influences of the sun, ocean, and greenhouse gases. Therefore,\nthese parameters appear not to be responsible for the excitation of these\noscillations, i.e.Â the oscillations might be rather self-excited. However,\ninfluences of land surface and vegetation changes had not been entirely\nexcluded. This is studied in the present analysis. It turns out that such\ninfluences might be active in the lowermost atmospheric levels. Long-term trends of atmospheric parameters such as the temperature are important\nfor the understanding of the ongoing climate change. Their study is mostly\nbased on data sets that are 1 to a few decades long. The trend values are\ngenerally small and so are the amplitudes of the long-period oscillations.\nIt can therefore be difficult to disentangle these structures, especially if\nthe interval of trend analysis is comparable to the period of the oscillations. If the oscillations are self-excited, there may be a\nnon-anthropogenic contribution to the climate change which is difficult to\ndetermine.

        "text": "Long-period temperature oscillations have been observed in atmospheric measurements and â surprisingly â in a very similar form in general circulation models (e.g.Â Meehl et al., 2013; Deser et al., 2014; Lu et al., 2014; Dai et al., 2015; Dijkstra et al., 2006; for further references, see Offermann et al., 2021). The latter authors have reported decadal to even centennial oscillation periods that not only existed at the surface but extended from the ground to the lower thermosphere. It was shown that they were not excited by the sun, the ocean, or greenhouse gases. The amplitudes of these oscillations are not large (i.e.Â fractions of 1âK). Nevertheless they may be important if long-term trends of temperature are analysed, as such trends are on this order of magnitude. Hence, these oscillations may be difficult to disentangle from the trends. This is especially important if the oscillations are part of the internal variability of the atmosphere. Internal and naturally forced variability â for instance, on decadal timescales â is discussed by DeserÂ (2020) and in the IPCC Climate ChangeÂ 2021 report (Eyring et al., 2021).\n\nThe analyses of Offermann et al.Â (2021) show very-long-period oscillations that appear to be of internal (self-excited) origin but whose detailed nature is as yet unknown. Therefore, that paper collected a number of characteristic structures which may help to clarify that question. This approach is further followed here by a comparative study of four locations in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres (at 50ââN vs.Â 50ââS, both at 7ââE, and at 70Â and 280ââE, both at 75ââN; coordinates are approximate).\n\nThe long-period oscillations of Offermann et al.Â (2021) were not excited by influences from the sun, ocean, and greenhouse gases. Therefore, self-excitation had been considered as a possibility. However, doubts remained as to a possible excitation by land surfaceâatmosphere interactions (see their Sect.Â 2.2). We therefore compare here locations and occasions with very different surface structures. The location 50ââN is in middle of the European land mass. The location 50ââS is about 15ââS of the tip of South Africa in the Southern Ocean. The polar locations are in northernmost Canada and Siberia. Concerning land surfaceâatmosphere interaction, these locations should behave fairly differently. In a further comparison, two different seasons (summer and winter) at 50ââN, 7ââE are considered.\n\nThe results of Offermann et al.Â (2021) had been derived from several atmospheric computer models with special runs whose boundary conditions had been kept constant. In the present analysis, we again use two of these: HAMMONIAÂ (38â123) and ECHAM6 (for details, see that paper). The models showed multi-annual, multi-decadal, and even centennial oscillation periods. These periods were found in a large altitude range, from the ground up to the lower thermosphere. The period values were about constant in this regime. The vertical profiles of oscillation amplitudes and phases, on the contrary, varied substantially. These variations were surprisingly similar for the different oscillation periods. An example of these vertical profiles is shown in Fig.Â 1. The amplitudes vary between maxima and minima. The phases show steps of about 180â which occur at the altitudes of the amplitude minima. For details, see Fig.Â 1 in Offermann et al.Â (2021). The pronounced vertical structures of the oscillations can possibly help us understand their nature proper.\n\nLong-period oscillations may have important influences on the analysis of long-term trends, for instance of temperature. Such trends in the lower and middle atmosphere have been discussed frequently. They are positive or negative, depending on altitude. Recent analyses for the troposphere and stratosphere have been presented, for instance, by Steiner et al.Â (2020), based on numerous measured data. Such analyses generally cover only a few decades. Therefore, the changes are usually small and often comparable to the oscillation amplitudes mentioned. It can sometimes be difficult to analyse them.\n\nOf special interest are temperature changes near the tropopause, as the tropopause is influenced by many parameters and is believed to show a robust âfingerprintâ of climate change (Santer et al., 2004; Pisoft et al., 2021). Tropopause trend analyses have been presented several times (e.g.Â Zhou et al., 2001; Gettelman et al., 2009; Hu and Vallis, 2019). Long-term changes of tropopause and stratopause altitudes have been analysed by means of measured and modelled data by Pisoft et al.Â (2021). They find important changes, such as an increase in tropopause height and a contraction of the stratosphere, which they attribute mainly to long-term increases of greenhouse gases. The temperature at the tropopause is frequently studied as the âcold-point tropopauseâÂ (CPT), i.e. the lowest temperature between the troposphere and stratosphere. It is influenced by various atmospheric parameters and is therefore discussed as a climate indicator (Hu and Vallis, 2019; Gettelman et al., 2009).\n\nLong-term changes of the CPT are of specific interest. They have been analysed in the tropics several times. Zhou et al.Â (2001) find a negative trend of -0.57Â±0.06 âK per decade in the time interval 1973â1998. RavindraBabu et al.Â (2020) find a trend of â1.09âK per decade in the time interval 2006â2018. Tegtmeier et al.Â (2020) report trends from â0.3Â to â0.6âK per decade from reanalysis data in the time frame 1979â2005. However, positive trends of tropopause temperatures have also been discussed (Hu and Vallis, 2019). Positive and negative trends in the range â0.94Â to +0.54âK per decade have been reported by Gettelman et al.Â (2009) in measured and model data. It is an open question as to what the reason for these differences and discrepancies in sign might be.\n\nThe present paper is organized as follows: Sect.Â 2 shows analyses from a HAMMONIA model run (Hamburg Model of the Neutral and Ionized Atmosphere; 34Â years) with fixed boundaries for solar radiation, ocean, and greenhouse gases. Atmospheric oscillations at northern and southern locations are compared in terms of their periods and amplitudes. The periods are between 5Â and 28Â years. SectionÂ 3 shows corresponding results from a 400-year-long run of the ECHAM6 model (ECMWF Hamburg), also with fixed boundaries. Longer periods from 20Â to 206Â years are analysed here. Four locations at different latitudes and longitudes are compared. SectionÂ 4 discusses the results. A possible self-excitation of the atmospheric oscillations is considered again. Furthermore, the implications of the oscillations for the analysis of long-term trends are shown. As an example, the behaviour of the cold-point tropopause is discussed. SectionÂ 5 summarizes the results.\n\nThe HAMMONIA model (Schmidt et al., 2006) is based on the ECHAM5 general-circulation model (Roeckner et al., 2006) and extends vertically to 110âkm. The simulation analysed here was run at a spectral resolution ofÂ T31 with 119Â vertical layers. A 34-year run of the modelÂ (38â123) has been analysed here for long-period oscillations at Wuppertal (50ââN, 7ââE). Model details and harmonic-oscillation analysis have been described in Offermann et al.Â (2021). Model boundaries with respect to the sun, ocean, and greenhouse gases were held constant. Nine long-period oscillations with periods between 5Â and 28Â years have been detected (see TableÂ 1). They were discussed in terms of self-excited (internal) atmospheric oscillations. Doubts concerning the self-excitation remained, however, because a possible land surfaceâatmosphere interaction could not be excluded. We therefore perform a corresponding analysis here for a conjugate geographic point at 50ââS, 7ââE. This location is about 15ââS of the southernmost tip of South Africa in the middle of the ocean. Hence, the surfaceâatmosphere interaction should be quite different here from that in the middle of Europe. In case such an interaction plays a role, we hope to see this by comparing various atmospheric parameters. The analysis procedures in the north and the south are exactly the same.\n\nFollowing Fig.Â 1, we study periods and amplitudes of the long-period oscillations. The figure shows that there are altitude ranges where a period could not be detected. This is attributed to the fact that the oscillation was not excited here or that it was too strongly damped to be detected (see Offermann et al., 2021). At these altitudes, the mean period value of the other altitudes is used as a proxy (dashed vertical red line, 17.3Â±0.79âyr in Fig.Â 1). The proxy is entered into the harmonic analysis and yields estimated values for amplitudes and phases of the oscillation at these altitudes. Details are given by Offermann et al.Â (2021). The statistical significance of the period values presented in this paper has been analysed in the preceding paper of Offermann et al.Â (2021, Sect.Â 3.2).\n\n2.1âPeriods\n\nThe above-mentioned nine periods found by Offermann et al.Â (2021) are repeated in TableÂ 1 together with their standard deviationsÂ (SD). At 50ââS, our analysis obtains seven oscillations that are also shown in TableÂ 1. They all find a correspondence in the northern values. A close agreement is found that is well within the combined standard deviations in all but one case and is even within a single standard deviation in most cases. These cases are indicated in bold font in TableÂ 1.\n\nTableÂ 1 holds a twofold surprise: first, it is interesting to see that long-period oscillations exist in the Southern Hemisphere and also in the Northern Hemisphere. Second, it is surprising that the values of the periods are so nearly the same. We would not expect this if the surfaceâatmosphere interaction did play a significant role. This is apparently not the case. Our data rather appear to hint at a global-oscillation mode that shows up in several periods.\n\n2.2âAmplitudes\n\nThe vertical amplitude profile in Fig.Â 1 shows a pronounced structure. This offers a valuable tool for our northâsouth comparison. Offermann et al.Â (2021) showed that vertical amplitude profiles of the different oscillation periods were surprisingly similar at the northern location. Their maxima occurred at about the same altitudes and so did the minima. (See the accumulated amplitudes in Fig.Â 11 of that paper.) As a consequence, the temperature standard deviations can be used as proxies for the accumulated amplitudes. This is done for the location at 50ââN, 7ââE in Fig.Â 2 (black squares). For the southern location at 50ââS, 7ââE, we do the same for a comparison to the north (Fig.Â 2, red dots).\n\nIn the paper of Offermann et al.Â (2021), it was shown that the occurrence of the long-period oscillations was clearly dependent on the direction of the zonal wind: strong oscillation activity was not observed for easterly (westward) winds. In the middle atmosphere, the zonal wind during solstices is opposite in the Northern and the Southern Hemisphere. Hence, comparison of annual mean amplitudes at 50ââN and 50ââS could be misleading. Here, we therefore compare data of the same season: January at 50ââN to July at 50ââS (Fig.Â 2; zonal wind is eastward) and July at 50ââN to January at 50ââS (Fig.Â 3; zonal wind is westward).\n\nAs expected, a comparison of the two pictures shows a large difference in the profiles between summer and winter at a given latitude because of the opposite wind directions. The profiles in the same season, however, are surprisingly similar at 50ââN and 50ââS.\n\nTaking together the results of periods and amplitudes, it appears that we see essentially the same atmospheric behaviour at 50ââN and 50ââS. We see no evidence of a possible interaction between the land surface and the atmosphere in the excitation of the oscillations, as the corresponding profiles are so similar. We therefore tend to believe that these oscillations are self-excited (internal). A deviation from this similarity occurs, however, at the lowest altitude in Figs.Â 2 andÂ 3. This will be discussed in Sect.Â 4 below.\n\nMuch longer periods than those in HAMMONIA were found in the ECHAM6 model (Offermann et al., 2021). ECHAM6 is the successor of ECHAM5 (Stevens et al., 2013). As the atmospheric component of the Max Planck Institute Earth system model (MPI-ESM; Giorgetta et al., 2013), it has been used in a large number of model intercomparison studies related to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phaseÂ 5Â (CMIP5). The ECHAM6 simulation analysed here was run at T63Â spectral resolution with 47Â vertical layers. For more details, see Offermann et al.Â (2021).\n\nOur analyses were based on a 400-year run of the ECHAM6 model. In the long-period range, 17 oscillations were observed between 20Â and 206Â years (TableÂ 2). They offer further northâsouth comparisons in the multi-decadal range and beyond.\n\n3.1âPeriods\n\nA harmonic analysis of the 400-year run at 50ââS, 7ââE is performed in the same way as described in Offermann et al.Â (2021) for the north. Sixteen periods can be identified here, with periods between 20Â and 160Â years. These are compared to the northern values in TableÂ 2. (In some places of TablesÂ 1â4, periods (counterparts) are missing. It is believed that, in these cases, the amplitudes were too small to be detected, as mentioned.)\n\nWe find corresponding oscillation values (ânorthâsouth pairsâ) in all cases except one (206.7Â year in the north). The second last column of TableÂ 2 shows the pair differences, and the last column shows the combined standard deviations. An agreement of periods within the combined standard deviations is found in 11Â cases (in bold font). In the remaining five cases, the periods agree within twice the standard deviations. This close agreement of the NâS pairs is similar to that given in TableÂ 1. It is very remarkable that this close correspondence exists at these much longer periods, too. Together with the HAMMONIA results, this again suggests some kind of a three-dimensional global-oscillation mode.\n\nThe HAMMONIA data show substantial differences in terms of oscillation amplitudes between summer and winter. The oscillation periods of HAMMONIA and ECHAM6 in TablesÂ 1 andÂ 2, respectively, are annual values. As north and south are opposite in season, the good agreement of the corresponding period pairs suggests that seasonal differences of the periods should not be large. We verify this using the larger set of ECHAM6 data. We compare annual mean oscillation periods to January and July (mean) values, respectively (TableÂ 3).\n\nThe comparison of the results at 50ââN between annual periods and corresponding periods in the January data at 50ââN yields 16Â coincidences which agree within the combined standard deviations. The corresponding analysis of the annual 50ââS data (TableÂ 2) and the July data at 50ââS gives 13Â coincidences, 12Â of which agreed within the combined standard deviations. (One agrees within the double standard deviations.) Hence, there is no essential difference between the annual and the summer and/or winter oscillation periods.\n\n3.2âAmplitudes\n\nAmplitudes of the long-period oscillations found in ECHAM6 are analysed in terms of temperature standard deviations, as has been done for the shorter periods of the HAMMONIA model. Also here, large seasonal differences are expected. Therefore, a northâsouth comparison is performed for corresponding seasons, i.e.Â January north is compared to July south as an example for winter. July north and January south are compared correspondingly for summer. This is shown in Figs.Â 4 andÂ 5, respectively.\n\nLarge seasonal differences are seen, indeed, and are similar to those in the shorter periods in Figs.Â 2 andÂ 3. North and south profiles are, however, very similar if the same seasons are considered, as is observed for the shorter periods. Again, similarity is clearly lost at the lowest altitude.\n\nIt is also remarkable that the maxima near 40Â and 70âkm agree so well in Figs.Â 2 andÂ 4.\n\n3.3âSeasonal differences\n\nIf there were an appreciable influence of land surface and vegetation on the excitation of the long-period temperature oscillations in the atmosphere, one would expect a difference of the oscillations in relation to season at a given location. Such an analysis is in part implicitly contained in the northâsouth comparisons given above. We repeat it here in more detail. Oscillation periods in January (northern hemispheric winter) and July (northern hemispheric summer) are analysed in the ECHAM6 model at 50ââN, 7ââE. Seventeen pairs of oscillation periods can be identified at values similar to those of the annual analysis shown in the first column of TableÂ 2. This is shown in TableÂ 3. Standard deviationsÂ (SD) of the periods are also given. A period near 48Â years could not be found in July. These results are compared to the annual values of TableÂ 2. The second-to-last column in TableÂ 3 shows the differences of the periods in January and July. The last column shows the sum of their standard deviations. A close agreement of the January and July periods is found: in 14Â cases, the periods agree within the combined standard deviations, which is indicated by bold font in TableÂ 3 (12Â cases agree even within single standard deviations). In three cases, the periods agree within double standard deviations. The agreement of the monthly periods with the annual ones (first column in TableÂ 3) is similarly close.\n\nGiven the close agreement of the monthly periods, it is interesting to compare their amplitudes.\n\nThese are shown in Fig.Â 6. Accumulated amplitudes are shown, i.e.Â the sum of all oscillation amplitudes obtained at a given altitude. The amplitudes could not be derived for each altitude. Hence, the curves shown in Fig.Â 6 are approximate. The two curves are quite different. The January curve has high values, is highly structured, and closely resembles in shape the winter temperature standard deviation profiles in Fig.Â 4. The values of the July curve are much smaller and resemble in shape the summer curves of the standard deviations given in Fig.Â 5. These agreements again justify the use of temperature standard deviations as proxies of the oscillation amplitudes.\n\nThe large difference in amplitudes in summer and winter in the stratosphere and mesosphere may be attributed to the opposite direction of zonal winds in the middle atmosphere in these seasons. It is surprising that, in spite of these large differences, the periods of the oscillations are so nearly the same. This demonstrates that the oscillation period is a robust parameter, as has been discussed by Offermann et al.Â (2021).\n\n3.4âHigh latitudes\n\nConsiderable land surface and vegetation differences might also be expected at polar latitudes. We have therefore analysed ECHAM6 temperatures at 75ââN, 70ââE (northern Siberia) and 75ââN, 280ââE (northernmost Canada). Winter temperatures (January) have been searched for long-period oscillations in the same way as described above. The results are shown in TableÂ 4. For comparison, January data at 50ââN from TableÂ 3 are also given.\n\nThe results are quite interesting. The periods found at the two polar locations are very similar. Seventeen periods have been found at either station, and 16Â of these agree within the combined standard deviations (12Â agree even within single standard deviations). The periods at high latitudes are quite similar to those at middle latitudes (50ââN, 7ââE). The 18Â periods seen at 50ââN find 16Â counterparts in either high-latitude station. Of these 15, 14Â agree within the combined standard deviations for the 70ââE (280ââE) station. Eleven periods even agree within single standard deviations in either case. Hence, the comparison of middle to high latitudes does not show an influence on periods, either.\n\nDeser et al.Â (2012) showed in their analysis that the variability of surface temperatures at high (northern) latitudes was considerably larger than that at middle and low latitudes. A similar result is obtained in the present data set for the upper atmosphere. We have calculated the temperature standard deviations at the two polar locations (75ââN) and show them in Fig.Â 7. The results at the 70Â and 280ââE longitudes are fairly similar. However, as suspected, they are significantly larger than the mid-latitude values shown in Fig.Â 4.\n\nThe profile forms shown in Fig.Â 7 are fairly different from those in Fig.Â 4. They are smeared, and the extrema occur at different altitudes. It appears that the profiles for different oscillation periods can be different for different latitudes, as well as for different longitudes. A detailed analysis is, however, beyond the scope of this paper.\n\nDai, A., Fyfe, J.
