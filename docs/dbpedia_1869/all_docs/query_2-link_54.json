There are many different criteria by which outbreaks can be defined based on severe weather occurrence data, and there is not likely to be any compelling logic to choose any single criterion as ideal for all purposes. Therefore, a method has been developed that uses multiple variables and allows for considerable flexibility. The technique can be adapted easily to any project that needs to establish a ranking of weather events. The intended use involves isolating the most important tornado outbreak days, as well as important outbreak days of primarily nontornadic severe convective weather, during a period when the number of reports has been growing rapidly from nonmeteorological factors. The method is illustrated for both tornadic and primarily nontornadic severe weather event day cases. The impact of the secular trends in the data has been reduced by a simple detrending scheme. The effect of detrending is less important for the tornado outbreak cases and is illustrated by comparing rankings with and without detrending. It is shown that the resulting rankings are relatively resistant to secular trends in the data, as intended, and not strongly sensitive to the choices made in applying the method. The rankings are also consistent with subjective judgments of the relative importance of historical tornado outbreak cases.",

        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nIn developing synoptic climatology studies of weather events, it can be difficult to develop a method for ranking the significance of the chosen weather events. An example of the need for such a ranking is to choose the most important, prototypical cases for study. As part of an effort to understand the meteorological differences, if any, between days producing major tornado outbreaks from those that produce primarily nontornadic severe convective storms, we have been faced with just such a challenge. Part of the challenge is that there has never been any formal definition of a tornado outbreak. The American Meteorological Society’s (AMS) Glossary of Meteorology (Glickman 2000; the Glossary hereafter) defines a tornado outbreak as “multiple tornado occurrences within a particular synoptic-scale system.” This definition does not say how many tornadoes are required to constitute an outbreak, but the Glossary goes on to refer to Galway (1977), who defined an outbreak as comprising 10 or more tornadoes. Galway also states, “A tornado outbreak can mean many things to many people.” The validity of Galway’s statement is manifested in the many different uses to which the label “tornado outbreak” has been applied. Pautz (1969), for example, classified tornado outbreaks as small (6–10 tornadoes), moderate (11–20 tornadoes), and large (more than 20 tornadoes).\n\nThe term has been applied to what are obviously major events, such as the infamous 3 April 1974 “jumbo outbreak” (Fujita 1974) and also to local events with relatively few tornadoes (Blechman 1975; Zipser and Golden 1979). Van Tassel (1955) described a series of tornadoes from a single storm as an outbreak. Forbes and Wakimoto (1983) presented a case involving many tornadoes, as well as other severe convective events that they described collectively as an outbreak. Although Zipser and Golden (1979) referred to the three-tornado event they studied as an outbreak in the title of their paper, within the text they described it as a “mini-outbreak.” Numerous other examples of this diversity regarding the use of the term outbreak for severe convective events can be found. Furthermore, many other types of weather events have been described as outbreaks, notably cases with large numbers of severe weather reports (be they tornadic or not), or even incursions of cold air. Thus, not only is there no general agreement about the definition of a tornado outbreak, the word “outbreak” itself has been used in several different ways.\n\nOur goal, however, is not to offer a formal definition for a severe weather outbreak. Individual projects focused on weather events that might be considered as outbreaks have specific circumstances and unique goals rendering pointless any attempt at creating a definition that would serve all possible goals equally well. Rather, we have developed herein a systematic way to rank weather events according to the specific requirements of any project.\n\nWe are engaged in a study of the environments in which major tornado outbreaks occur, with the goal of comparing them to the environments of primarily nontornadic severe storm outbreaks. Our objectives require that we focus on tornadoes and other severe convective storm events that develop in association with a particular synoptic system, consistent with the AMS Glossary definition given above. Studies of synoptic-scale environments from a number of cases have a long history. For example, Beebe (1956) developed what he called “tornado composite charts” by selecting cases involving three or more tornadoes. Although he did not use the term outbreak, his clear intention was to choose cases involving what he considered to be significant tornado events associated with strong synoptic-scale systems, rather than isolated tornado reports. Although three tornadoes seems like a small number in light of current tornado reporting standards, in the 1950s it could be considered at least a reasonable starting point for selecting cases. In developing a study of the environments associated with hurricane-induced tornadoes, McCaul (1991) applied a definition similar to that used by Pautz (1969).\n\nAn important consideration in ranking tornado outbreaks is their impact on society. Although it is possible for tornadoes to occur that have relatively little impact, it is generally the case that events including a relatively large number of powerful tornadoes are more likely to cause extensive damage and casualties than events with a small number of relatively weak tornadoes. This is a direct consequence of the correlation between intensity and path area (Brooks 2004); although not a one-to-one relationship, measures of societal impact are nevertheless useful in gauging the meteorological significance of a given event. Whereas any single measure of outbreak importance can be unrepresentative, it seems plausible to suggest that a combination of measures would be more likely to yield a robust ranking scheme. That is the direction we have pursued.\n\nA major challenge for this task is the large secular growth in the number of tornado and severe thunderstorm reports that has primarily nonmeteorological origins (Brooks et al. 2003; Doswell et al. 2005). This growth makes it very difficult to compare the raw number of reported tornadoes for events separated by a decade or more (see Speheger et al. 2002). The growth of nontornadic severe thunderstorm reports has been even greater than the growth of tornado reports (Doswell et al. 2005). Any ranking based on the raw number of reports likely would be heavily biased toward the most recent events. Nevertheless, the number of tornadoes (or nontornadic severe thunderstorm reports) ought to have some influence on case selection.\n\nOne alternative is to estimate the trend in the number of reports and then remove it. This is the approach used by, for example, Doswell et al. (1993), Verbout et al. (2004), and Bruening et al. (2002). However, such an approach is simply focused on the number of events and we believe that multiple measures are needed. As first described in Edwards et al. (2004), we have developed a method for incorporating multiple variables describing a severe weather day in a systematic way to rank the case days. Note that these two approaches are not mutually exclusive; they can be combined and we have done so in this work.\n\nThat a single variable might not be adequate for producing a ranking of events has been recognized elsewhere. For example, when considering the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Wolter and Timlin (1998) used the so-called multivariate ENSO index (MEI; more information available online at http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/people/klaus.wolter/MEI/). Although the MEI formulation is very different in detail from what we are proposing as an outbreak ranking methodology, its intent is evidently to mitigate the vagaries associated with using a single variable.\n\nIn summary, our project requires us to develop a ranking scheme that has the following characteristics (in no particular order): 1) uses multiple variables to measure the meteorological and societal significance of a given outbreak day, 2) provides a reproducible result, 3) yields rankings reasonably consistent with what someone familiar with the history of such events would arrive at subjectively, at least for the highest-ranked cases, 4) accounts for the known large secular trends, and 5) results in rankings that are reasonably robust to any arbitrary parameter choices. For the purposes of the long-term project that has driven the effort to produce a ranking scheme, we need as clear a separation as possible between highly ranked tornado outbreaks and prototypical outbreaks of primarily nontornadic severe weather.\n\nWe develop the basic methodology for our ranking scheme in section 2. Section 3 presents the results of the scheme as applied to tornado outbreaks and documents the detrending scheme we used, and section 4 shows the results as used for primarily nontornadic severe convective storm outbreaks. Finally, section 5 offers a discussion of the results.\n\n3. Tornado outbreak day rankings\n\nFor each date, we considered the number of tornadoes of any F-scale rating on that day, the number of violent (F4 and F5 rating) tornadoes, the number of significant tornadoes (≥F2 rating), the destruction potential index (DPI) developed by Thompson and Vescio (1998; see the explanation below), the total pathlength of all tornadoes, the number of fatalities, the number of killer tornadoes, and the number of tornadoes with track lengths ≥ 80 km. Although relevant to ranking tornado days, this set of variables is somewhat arbitrary. We cannot assert that they are optimal in any sense, but it is not clear that optimality must be demonstrated for this purpose. We argue a posteriori that our final rankings are consistent with what many severe storm meteorologists would agree are the important cases during the period. However, we certainly do not claim that our final rankings are the only ones possible, nor is ours the only method by which such rankings can be done.\n\na. The DPI\n\nThe DPI (Thompson and Vescio 1998) has not been presented heretofore in the refereed literature. It is defined by where n is the number of tornadoes on that day, ai is a measure of the tornado damage area (pathlength multiplied by path width) for each tornado, and Fi is the Fujita-scale rating (F0–F5) for each tornado. Adding unity to the F-scale rating is done so that an F0 rating yields a nonzero value. This represents a nonlinear combination of the pathlength and width with the F-scale rating. The DPI clearly puts the greatest emphasis on large, violent, long-track tornadoes, which are the most likely to cause large amounts of damage, hence, its name. Note that the DPI is far from independent of some of the other variables used in our scheme. The fact that it is a nonlinear combination of the variables means it can contain independent information when used in this linear weighting scheme. It is evident that the variables in our scheme are likely to be correlated, so the scheme has not been optimized in a statistical sense. Nevertheless, it succeeds for our purposes and can be adapted readily to other purposes.\n\nb. Implementation of the ranking scheme\n\nUsing the database for the period 1970–2003, the relevant variables for each date during the period were collected. For a starting point, only days with seven or more tornadoes were considered. This is not a large number of tornadoes on a single day, but this choice was made because it was felt that no day with fewer tornadoes than seven would be likely to be called an outbreak in any era during the period 1970–2003.3 Note that a little more than half the dates in the period—a total of 6330 out of 12 418, or 51%—are days on which no tornadoes were reported and so were not considered at all. During the period, there were 1447 days with seven or more reported tornadoes (nearly 12%), an average of about 42 such days per year.\n\nIf we only consider a single variable, such as the number of reported tornadoes, the effect of secular trends is manifested in the predominance of certain dates (most recent dates, for the number of tornadoes; older dates for the number of fatalities). In general, there is considerable disparity between rankings according to different variables, as illustrated in Table 4. That the rankings would be so sensitive to the variable chosen was anticipated. When using any single variable, it would be difficult to justify the choice of cases, as proponents in favor of a particular variable for the ranking would be inclined to argue with any other choice. With the lone exception of 3 April 1974, which by any standard is the greatest single-day outbreak of tornadoes in the period, the rankings shown in Table 4 are very different rankings. For example, 27 May 1973 only shows up in two of the five rankings, while 4 May 2003 is absent from only one, but its relative position varies considerably. Thus, a different approach is needed.\n\nA critical issue in the larger study that prompted this work is the relationship between tornadoes and a particular synoptic-scale weather system. As Galway (1977) pointed out, it is possible to achieve a particular threshold tornado count by having a scattering of tornadoes about the whole country, whereas what we wished to consider an outbreak would be dominated by events associated with a particular synoptic-scale system. Thus, most of the tornadoes on an outbreak day should be clustered spatially or closely aligned, rather than scattered. We wanted to avoid considering days when the tornadoes are widely dispersed. As it turned out, this was not a problem for all the top-ranked tornado outbreak cases. However, as shown below, it was a definite problem for some cases involving outbreaks of primarily nontornadic severe weather.\n\nThe variables used for ranking tornado days and shown in Table 2 include the following:\n\nThe “No. tornadoes” is the number of tornadoes on that day. It is weighted the least of all the variables, reflecting the perceived negative impact of the secular trend in tornado reporting. However, in one of the weighting schemes for the detrended data (see below) it was given substantially higher weight.\n\nThe “No. violent” is the number of F4- and F5-rated tornadoes on that day. Although many important outbreaks produce at least two violent tornadoes, the rating of tornado intensity can be highly dependent on what the tornadoes actually hit. Further, there is likely to be some reluctance to give tornadoes such a high rating if it is not clear that the structures hit were capable of wind resistance consistent with the highest F-scale ratings. Thus, this variable is given only moderate weighting.\n\nThe “No. significant tornadoes” is the number of tornadoes rated F2 or higher. It is accorded a relatively high weight in all cases because most tornadoes with high impact (in terms of damage and/or casualties) are rated F2 and higher.\n\nThe “Pathlength” is in kilometers, and represents the cumulative pathlength of all the tornadoes on that day. This receives the highest weighting in two of the weighting choices, because it is strongly associated with high damage potential and its values are known with relatively high accuracy and precision.\n\nThe “DPI” was weighted relatively highly because of its value in describing the threat associated with the tornadoes on that date. However, it is not known with the same degree of confidence as total pathlength and, because of some overlap between DPI and total pathlength, the DPI gets a lower relative weighting than the total pathlength.\n\nThe “No. deaths” is the total fatalities for the day. It received a relatively low weight in all rankings because fatalities are the result of the more or less random concatenation of tornadoes with humans. A particular case can have only a few deaths and still be a meteorologically significant day, whereas a large number of fatalities can result from a single tornado (such as the Plainfield tornado of 1990) that by itself would not constitute an outbreak. Even though the number of fatalities is known with fairly high accuracy, it is strongly influenced by nonmeteorological factors.\n\nThe “No. killers” is the number of tornadoes that produced one or more fatalities. Although like the total fatalities, this can vary widely from nonmeteorological factors, an event that results in a large number of killer tornadoes is likely to result from a spatially widespread group of significant tornadoes. The moderate weighting reflects the uncertainty of this variable.\n\nThe “No. 80-km tracks” is the number of tornadoes on that day that had track lengths 80 km or more in length. It is related to the total pathlength for the day. An outbreak with a large number of long-track tornadoes is likely to be a significant event. However, its large correlation with total pathlength affords it a smaller relative weight than given to the total pathlength.\n\nUsing these variables and the relative weightings shown in Table 2, we produced a final top-20 ranking for the period 1970–2003 (Table 5, column 1). The so-called O index is named for outbreaks of tornadoes and uses the particular variables with the weightings in Table 2 in Eq. (4). The “jumbo outbreak” of 1974 (Fujita 1974) stands way above all the rest, consistent with any reasonable knowledge of tornado outbreak history. That outbreak is, by any measure, the most important single outbreak during the period and perhaps in the recorded history of tornadoes in the United States.\n\nc. Detrending the tornado variables\n\nThe alternative rankings presented in Table 5 represent the results of using our method after having detrended those variables found to exhibit a marked trend through the period. We used a method similar to that developed by Verbout et al. (2004), in that it accounts for the long-term trends in the data. Figure 1 illustrates the nature of the problem, revealing that the number of reported tornadoes has roughly doubled during the period 1960–2003. The regression line shown on the figure was done with a simple linear fit to the logarithm of the number of tornado reports, which gives a nonlinear trend line when plotted on a linear scale. However, it was felt that this trend line is unsuitable for detrending the daily number of tornado reports (or any of the other variables). If this line were used, it would be necessary to convert it to a daily value by dividing by 365 (the number of days in a year), which would be unrealistically low for the days we would be considering (days with seven or more reported tornadoes). Hence, we used a similar process to fit a regression line to the sum of the reported tornadoes on the top 30 days4 of each year (according to the number of reported tornadoes), resulting in Fig. 2. The total number of tornado reports in the top 30 days of the year is slightly less than half of the total for the whole year in most years, although this fraction has some modest interannual variation (not shown). To convert to a daily average value, the value from the regression line for a given year is divided by 30.\n\nA detrended variable on a given date is derived by dividing the reported value for a given date by the daily average for that particular year. The detrended variables are greater than unity if the variable (such as the number of reported tornadoes) on that day exceeds the daily average value of that variable for that year, and less than unity if the number is less than that daily average value. These detrended values are then converted to standard normal variables in the same way as the raw values were. Because we had data for all the variables going back to 1960 for tornado days, we used trend lines fitted to that extended period of record, even though values for the years 1960–69 were not used in this ranking for the period 1970–2003.\n\nIt was found that meaningful trends are not present in all the variables. As an example, Fig. 3 shows that no obvious trend was present in the DPI values. A slight downward trend with time can be seen, but this is not strong enough to be considered significant, given the interannual variability, and does not justify the detrending effort. Of the variables used, only four were found to have sufficiently clear trends to warrant the detrending process: the number of all tornadoes, the number of significant tornadoes, the number of violent tornadoes, and the number of tornadoes with track lengths ≥ 80 km. Curiously, the trends in all but the number of all tornadoes were downward with time. This might be related to some reporting biases mentioned by Verbout et al. (2004).\n\n5. Summary and discussion\n\nThe ranking of weather events can be rather controversial, for several reasons. There can be a large difference between the meteorological significance of a weather event and its societal impact. Not all events having a large societal impact are particularly noteworthy in terms of the meteorology, whereas not all major meteorological events occur in locations where they affect humans. This is especially true for severe convective storms because they generally cover only a small area during the course of a single day; their interaction with humans is unlikely on any day and becomes important more or less randomly, and infrequently. Despite this, it is clear that meteorological and societal significance are far from mutually exclusive. Thus, our scheme melded both meteorological and societal impact variables for tornado outbreaks. Even if it is felt that only the meteorological significance of an event is relevant in the ranking, however, deciding what quantitative aspects of the event to consider can be challenging. For example, is a large number of tornadoes on a given day more or less important than the occurrence of a few high-intensity tornadoes? The solution to this dilemma is to develop a multivariate index.\n\nThe existence of nonmeteorological secular trends in the severe storm report data complicates this task considerably. We have shown this to be even more important for the nontornadic severe storms than for tornadoes, in general. Our detrending scheme fits a regression line to the logarithm of the variable being detrended, thereby allowing for a nonlinear trend, which many of the variables seem to exhibit. We have accounted, at least in part, for these substantial secular trends in the reporting of severe storms and our method appears to be relatively insensitive to the subjective choices we made. Other possible techniques exist, but our ranking does not appear to suffer from “temporal myopia” whereby the most recent events are generally ranked the highest owing to secular trends in the data.\n\nBecause our goal was to pick a large sample of important weather events from the severe storm report database as cases for inclusion in a synoptic climatology, our proposed methodology has proven to be a reasonably robust way to do so. Furthermore, it can be adapted easily to other types of weather events, such as winter storms or flash floods. For other weather events, it may or may not be desirable for the resulting rankings to be reasonably consistent with the subjective experience of those familiar with the history of such events. In the case of tornado outbreaks, we believe it was useful to use our subjective knowledge of tornado outbreaks to develop a reproducible scheme that would be consistent with our perceived relative importance of historical tornado outbreak days. On the other hand, because we were not familiar with the history of primarily nontornadic severe thunderstorm event days, subjective knowledge played no role in the development of an index for ranking such days. For the essentially nontornadic severe storm outbreak days, it would be useful to know precisely how older cases would look if the current reporting practices were applied to them. Of course, this is not possible and so we have no way to be certain about how accurately our detrending has accounted for the secular changes to the severe storm reports database.\n\nAlthough our method for developing rankings is reproducible in the sense that it will always produce the same ranking from identical data, there is certainly subjectivity in the choice of weights, and even in the various choices of how the detrending was done. Furthermore, the overall methodology cannot be justified objectively; the use of a weighted linear combination of multiple variables is far from the only way to combine multiple variables. Like all reproducible methods, some subjectivity involving both the choice of scheme and in the choice of parameters for the chosen scheme is inevitable.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, there has been no previous attempt to rank outbreak days consisting of primarily nontornadic severe convective storms. It can be observed that most of the high-ranking dates occur late in the warm season, including days in midsummer, whereas the dates for tornado outbreaks (Table 5) are spread widely through the year, except in midsummer. This suggests that widespread outbreaks of primarily nontornadic severe storms are often associated with large mesoscale convective systems during the warm season, whereas major tornado outbreaks are primarily spring and fall events. Although the tornado threat with summer convective systems is not vanishingly small, the occurrence of major tornado outbreaks in such events is unlikely, as is generally well known.\n\nThe distinction between major tornado outbreaks and major outbreaks of essentially nontornadic severe storms was incorporated into the methodology; cases considered for tornado outbreaks were excluded from consideration for primarily nontornadic severe weather outbreaks. Clearly, many events of a mixed character (i.e., both tornadic and nontornadic severe weather) occur, and many tornado outbreak days are also associated with numerous nontornadic severe storm reports. Consideration of these mixed events is outside the scope of this work, however.\n\nFinally, we wish to reemphasize that while we have developed a ranking scheme for severe weather outbreaks, we have not claimed the scheme is intended to define an outbreak of severe weather. Our criteria were intended to serve our specific research goals and so we do not recommend that they be used to limit what constitutes a severe weather outbreak. For other goals, different criteria can be developed and used."
