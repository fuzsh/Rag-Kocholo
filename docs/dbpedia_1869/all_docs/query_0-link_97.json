        "text": "Han is a naked-eye star, so you don't need a telescope or binoculars when you look up on a clear night. The lower the magnitude, the easier it will be to see it.\n\nThe Michigan Spectral Classification for Han is O9.5 Vn. The Hipparcos or Simbad spectral class is O9.5V, and it is the latter which will be used for descriptions on this site.\n\nRadial Velocity and Proper Motion\n\nIn simplistic terms, all non-rogue stars, like planets, orbit around a central object, although that is actually not true. Where is the centre of the Solar System. For simplicity it's the central star, such as the Sun. In the case of a star, it's the galactic centre. The constellations we see today will be different than they were 50,000 years ago or 50,000 years from now.\n\nProper motion details the movements of these stars and is measured in milliarcseconds. Han is moving 24.79 ± 0.15 milliarcseconds/year towards the north and 15.26 ± 0.2 milliarcseconds/year east if we saw them in the horizon.\n\nThe radial velocity, the speed at which the Han is towards the Sun, is -9.00000 km/s with an error of about 5.50 km/s . When the value is negative, the star and the Sun are getting closer to one another; likewise, a positive number means that two stars are moving away. It's nothing to fear as the stars are so far apart they won't collide in our lifetime, if ever.\n\nHan Fact Table\n\nThe table is scrollable if you can't see everything, just swipe the table to see the hidden information.\n\nPrimary NameHanSpectral TypeO9.5VStar TypeBe StarColourblue - whiteGalaxyMilky WayConstellationOphiuchusMain StarYesAbsolute Magnitude-3.20 / -2.71Visual / Apparent Magnitude2.54Visible From EarthYesRight Ascension (R.A.)16h 37m 09.53Declination (Dec.)-10° 34` 01.7Galactic Latitude23.58773223 °Galactic Longitude6.28115269 °1997 Distance from Earth7.12000 Parallax (milliarcseconds)458.09 Light Years140.45 Parsecs2007 Distance from Earth8.91000 Parallax (milliarcseconds)366.06 Light Years112.23 Parsecs23,148,937.901 Astronomical UnitsGalacto-Centric Distance23,803.401 Light Years / 7,298 ParsecsProper Motion Dec.24.79000 ± 0.15000 milliarcseconds/yearProper Motion RA.15.26000 ± 0.20000 milliarcseconds/yearB-V Index0.03Radial Velocity-9.00000 ± 5.5 km/sIron Abundance (Fe/H)-0.0900 ± 9.99Eccentricity0.27770Semi-Major Axis9703.0000000Luminosity (Lsun)1120.2600000Effective Temp.
