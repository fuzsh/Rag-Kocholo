        "text": "Han River, river, northern South Korea, rising in the western slopes of the Taebaek-sanmaek (mountains) and flowing generally westward across the peninsula through the provinces of Gangwon, Gyeonggi, and North Chungcheong and through the city of Seoul to the Yellow Sea.\n\nOf the Han’s 319-mile (514-km) length, 200 miles (320 km) are navigable, and it has been a valuable river transportation route since ancient times, particularly during the Joseon (Yi) dynasty (1392–1910). Various agricultural products are grown in its 10,000-square-mile (26,000-square-km) drainage basin. There are several islands in the lower course of the river, such as Yeoui-do, located within the city limits of Seoul. The Han supplies the cities along its course with water for industrial and general use. The river’s upper course, in the mountains, is used to generate hydroelectric power. In the late 20th century additional multipurpose dams were built at Yeongwol, Chungju, Soyang, and Yeoju."
