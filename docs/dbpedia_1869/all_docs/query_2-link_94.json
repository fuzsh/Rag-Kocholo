        "text": "The one thing that team leaders, department heads, and business owners know is that the process is the key. This is true regardless of department function, product variation, or even industry type. Creating clear, easy to understand, and transferrable processes is what makes your business as Michael E. Gerber puts it in his book The E-Myth Revisited a franchise. Without getting emotionally caught up in the term \"franchise\" through associations with Chipotle and McDonald's Michael makes a compelling case that taking the franchise model into your business is what allows the business to flourish without REQUIRING your presence. Everything from different operational areas such as marketing, sales, operations, and production will have departmental processes which drives the clarity of individual employee processes within those functional areas.\n\nAs W. Edwards Deming put it so eloquently in the headline image of this article. \"If you can't describe what you're doing as a process, you don't know what you're doing.\"\n\nClearly articulated processes drive functional performance management systems. If a new sales rep comes in and is told to make as many calls as you can and sell, sell, sell, then there is no process, and everyone is flying by the seat of their pants.\n\nIf I could narrow my purpose in life to just one thing, it is to be a facilitator in having individuals lead a more fulfilled life. (I acknowledge, there is a bit of generality in this statement) Narrowing down further, I needed to find where I could make the most impact. I have determined that using my tens of thousands of hours in positions of leadership, my expertise in delivering interpersonal tools to enhance individual resilience, and my experience as a retention specialist in the 82nd Airborne Division I can provide the most value to those who are working in positions that are not inherently satisfying or fulfilling.\n\nTypically, when we work in these types of jobs, we leave work with little to no satisfaction with our professional development and ultimately our place in the world. We feel disconnected and are in a perpetual search for meaning. We bring this angst home with us and feed our disgruntled energy to our families.\n\nThis disruption of work and family life inevitably leads to poor sleep quality which makes your entire day both at work and at home more difficult to manage. Lack of sleep reduces our decision-making capacity which leads to poor eating habits, producing wide margins in the highs and lows of our energy at work which makes consistent performance all but impossible.\n\nIf we do not recognize the cycle at play here, it is impossible to make meaningful actions to course correct. Fixing your diet is hard to do when your sleep is poor. It is hard to improve your sleep when you have a disruptive home life which is fed by a sense of lacking at work. This is where I interject myself to begin steering the ship in a slightly different direction. I am not stating that listening to one of my keynote addresses or attending one of my workshops will create the massive differences in workplace resulting in the highest retention rates ever known to man. What I am saying is exactly what James Clear alludes to in his book Atomic Habits. He gives the example of flying from Los Angeles to New York City. If the pilot was to make a small adjustment and turn 3.5 degrees south, the plane would end up in Washington DC, instead of New York City.\n\nIn effect, small, but meaningful changes can produce a big difference over time. Our workspaces offer the opportunity for a fulfilled life should we choose to start making those small 1 or 2 degree changes in our flight path right now. Are we, as leaders, willing to take the mantle and charge ourselves with the responsibility of being a force for positive growth in the lives not just our customers, but of our employees as well?\n\nClients do not come first. Employees Come first. If you take care of your employees, they will take care of the clients\n\n~Richard Branson\n\nIf you are doing better than Richard Branson, please disregard this post.\n\nYou're still here! That's great! At this point you are likely saying, all of this sounds great Matt, but how in the world do I actually implement this? Let me list off a few of the key attributes that comprise a healthy work environment that your employees desire.\n\nComponents of a fulfilling position\n\nTask Vision & Ownership\n\nAutonomy\n\nA sense of belonging\n\nOpportunities to advance (position and/or skill)\n\nBoundaries\n\nTask Vision and Ownership refers to the idea that no matter the job position there should be zero questions as to what impact this person is having on the organization. You deliver mail to the different offices throughout the building? You are the person who is transporting the most meaningful points of contact to the right people at the right time keeping our business-to-business and our customer relationships alive. If you were not here doing this task, we would not be able to serve and benefit the lives of so many people in such a meaningful manner. Ownership is the degree to which an individual can see their task through from beginning to end. The more control over the entire process an employee maintains the more empowered they are to perform with excellence because it is not just another task, it is their role, itâ€™s their duty.\n\nAutonomy is a trust-based exercise. How much oversight is the mail deliver worker receiving? Are they trusted to show up on time or is there somebody sitting there watching the clock. Are they being monitored as they deliver packages? Or are they provided with some room to breathe where they can perform their task in the manner they see fit so long as the end state matches the desired intent. Do you really care if they start at the third floor and then go to the second and then the fifth floor so long as all the mail is delivered by 10:00am? Stop worrying so much and let people get creative!\n\nA Sense of Belonging undergirds almost everything I do. I focus on bringing people together because it is through our connection to the people and the mission of the organization that brings meaning into our lives. Work can no longer just be \"work\". The brick layer does not simply lay stones, he builds cathedrals. He is connected to the church, believes in its greater purpose and is proud to be a servant of that message through his work.\n\nOpportunities! Business owners are known to be growth junkies. If you are sitting still, you are dead is a common mantra in the business world. The same is true for the people who make up our workforce. They do not want to do the same repetitive task day in and day out for 20 years to be gifted their gold watch and to then go home and collect their pension. We desire growth. We want to be pushed to new levels of performance to see where our peak is and how we can find new peaks and mountain tops to summit. This does not always have to be a promotion. It can be a temporary transfer to a new location where they provide their skill set in satellite branches. It could be an overseas assignment. It could be specialty training within their field. But yes, it also absolutely includes promotions.\n\nFinally, we have Boundaries. Yes, people want to show up, work hard, be given the freedom to operate in their position with some latitude, and trust to get the work done. And as we just discussed, they want opportunities to grow within an organization that they believe in. But at the end of the day, if we want the benefits of a fulfilled work life to permeate to the homelife elevating the quality of existence across the board, we must release our grip on our employees to let them enjoy their time away from the office. Our technology often burdens us with hyper-connectivity with work that blurs and at times completely erases the boundaries of work and home. Let people enjoy their homelife free from thoughts of the office.\n\nBONUS! If you are going to entertain the idea of monetary incentives for your employees try looking at options that further empower the quality of time they have at home. You may not be able to send your employees home at 3:00pm everyday or do 4-day work weeks, but how much can you take clear from their plate while they are at home? Can you conduct a business deal with a landscaping company or home cleaning services that your employees either get at a discount or provided for free when performance standards are met?\n\nAt the end of the day none of these matter without processes. These will turn into what we in the military have lovingly called \"good idea fairies\" that eventually fall to the wayside when things get difficult. And they always get difficult. If there is not a clear structure to keep you moored to your principles then the tide will pull you and your organization out to sea while your employees jump ship back onto the dock to find a boat worth getting on.\n\n(Yes, I am proud of the full extent of that analogyðŸ˜Ž)\n\nWant to learn more?\n\nDirect message me on LinkedIn\n\nShoot me an email at matthew@resilienttalentsolutions.com"
