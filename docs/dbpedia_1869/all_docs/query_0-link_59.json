        "text": "The first population genetic studies on Atlantic herring in the early 1980s were based on a dozen allozyme markers and revealed the unexpected result of no significant allele frequency differences even between Atlantic and Baltic herring considered as subspecies (Andersson et al., 1981; Ryman et al., 1984). Subsequent studies using microsatellites and small number of SNPs largely confirmed this observation but with occasional genetic markers showing genetic differentiation (Larsson et al., 2010; Limborg et al., 2012). Whole-genome sequencing has completely changed the picture, we now find striking genetic differentiation but at a limited number of loci (Figures 3–5). Our previous analysis (Lamichhaney et al., 2017) revealing a striking difference between the observed distribution of FST values and the one expected under neutrality implies that essentially all loci highlighted as highly differentiated in the present study are due to adaptation. Our data are consistent with a model where the Atlantic herring has a genomic ‘tool box’ of a few hundred major loci associated with ecological adaptation to local climate conditions such as water temperature, salinity, light conditions, and preferred spawning time. We propose that this genetic adaptation is related to life history parameters such as migratory behavior, timing of spawning, and ecological conditions during larval development. The Atlantic herring has a high fecundity where a female can release tens of thousands of eggs at spawning. A perfect match between genotype and environmental conditions gives potential for a highly successful reproduction.\n\nAn important practical implication of the current study is that sequence variants associated with ecological adaptation best reveal the population structure of the Atlantic herring (Figure 2b), whereas neutral markers are less useful for population identification (Figure 2a). A PCA analysis based on only about 800 SNPs out of the more than 10 million SNPs detected in the study distinguish all major groups of Atlantic herring and reveal allele frequency differences between subpopulations within major groups. For instance, the Ser346Thr mutation in AHR alone can efficiently distinguish the North Atlantic Ocean groups from all other groups of herring (Figure 5—figure supplement 1a). The current study has established the diagnostic SNP markers that may be used to improve the collation of data for fisheries stock assessment. This is necessary in order to identify and address the mismatches between biological populations and management units or stocks, which can hamper the development and implementation of effective management of this important natural resource (Cope and Punt, 2011; Hintzen et al., 2015).\n\nThe genetic architecture underlying multifactorial traits and disorders has been intensively studied in recent years, in particular based on human genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and the general finding is that most traits are highly polygenic with large number of loci each explaining a tiny fraction of the genetic variance (Goddard et al., 2016). This is usually referred to as consistent with a quasi-infinitesimal model, because the data largely conform with the predictions of Fisher’s classical infinitesimal model (Fisher, 1919) which constituted the foundation for quantitative genetics theory. A prime example of a trait consistent with the quasi-infinitesimal model is stature in human. A study based on ~700,000 individuals revealed more than 3000 variants affecting this trait but these did not explain more than ~25% of the variance (Yengo et al., 2018), implying that it must be thousands of segregating sites affecting stature in humans. The genetic architecture underlying ecological adaptation in Atlantic herring is strikingly different. It is polygenic but the number of loci showing strong genetic differentiation is in the hundreds and not in the thousands. However, it is possible that we only see the tip of the iceberg and there may be a large number of loci with tiny effects that also affect ecological adaptation. The herring data nevertheless deviates from the expected pattern under a strict infinitesimal model because this theory predicts that a response to natural selection should only cause minor changes in allele frequencies. This is because each individual locus only explains a tiny fraction of the genetic variance and should not result in major shifts in allele frequencies, such as those reported here. Allele frequencies may in fact shift substantially under the infinitesimal model but due to genetic drift, mutation or migration (Barton et al., 2017) which cannot explain the pattern we see here as the effect is restricted to a small portion of the genome. An important difference between the genetic architecture underlying variation in human stature and ecological adaptation in herring, is that the signatures of selection in herring reflect evolutionary processes that may have happened over many generations. For instance, the herring has adapted to the brackish Baltic Sea after it was formed about 10,000 years ago (Andrén et al., 2011). In contrast, the human GWAS data reflect standing genetic variation, which includes many slightly deleterious variants, the majority of these will never contribute to a selection response for a fitness trait. This interpretation is supported by the report that negative (or purifying) selection is common for genetic variants associated with human complex traits (Zeng et al., 2018) The genetic architecture underlying ecological adaptation in herring is in fact similar to the genetic architecture underlying skin color in humans, a trait affected by strong natural selection, for which four major loci were estimated to explain 35% of the total variance in an admixed population (Beleza et al., 2013).\n\nThe genetic architecture underlying ecological adaptation detected here makes perfect sense in light of the ecological challenges involved. The most dramatic differences in biotic and abiotic factors occur between the marine Atlantic Ocean and the brackish Baltic Sea which differ in regard to salinity, variation in water temperature over the year (Figure 1—figure supplement 1), light conditions (Hill et al., 2019), plankton production and presence of predators. In this contrast, we document hundreds of loci showing significant genetic differentiation. In other contrasts between geographically distinct ecoregions, the numbers of detected loci are much fewer, in the range 10–30 (Figures 3–5).\n\nIt has been exceedingly challenging to move from GWAS peaks to the identification of causal variants in human and other species, despite enormous efforts. The reason is that strong linkage disequilibrium among multiple sequence variants showing an equally strong association with phenotype makes it difficult or impossible to provide genetic evidence for causality. In contrast, the genome-wide screens in Atlantic herring immediately reveal strong suggestive evidence of causality at some loci. A striking example concerns rhodopsin (RHO), showing strong genetic differentiation between Atlantic and Baltic herring (Figure 3a). A missense mutation in this gene (Phe261Tyr) has a critical role for adaptation to the red-shifted light conditions in the Baltic Sea (Hill et al., 2019). Interestingly, about one third of all fish adapted to red-shifted light conditions in freshwater and brackish water carry Tyr261 like the Baltic herring, an amazing example of convergent evolution (Hill et al., 2019). The present study revealed at least two additional examples of outstanding candidates for being causal mutations, the non-coding single-base change upstream of SOX11B (Figure 3—figure supplement 2b) and the Ser346Thr missense mutation at AHR2B2 (Figure 5b). These are candidate causal mutations based on far stronger statistical support than any other sequence variant in the corresponding regions. How can genomic regions showing signals of selection in these cases be so narrow? There are three possible explanations, either it is because (i) there is an extremely high rate of recombination in the region, (ii) these are ‘old’ polymorphisms that have segregated for such a long time that linkage disequilibrium to flanking markers has eroded leaving the causal variant in splendid isolation, or (iii) the same causal variant has occurred by mutation multiple times on different haplotypes. We can exclude option (i) because neither meiotic recombination or LDhat data indicate an exceptionally high recombination rate in this region (Pettersson et al., 2019). Although the mutation rate in the Atlantic herring is exceptionally low (Feng et al., 2017), in each generation every nucleotide site in the herring genome is hit by many mutations due to the enormous population size. Thus, herring is not a species where evolution is restricted by lack of genetic variation and therefore has to rely on standing genetic variation. The observation of sequence variants with outstanding strength of associations, implying substantial functional effects, is a deviation from the infinitesimal model.\n\nA unique observation in this study is the Ser346Thr missense mutation in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor 2B2 (AHR2B2) gene. Thr346 must be the derived allele since all tested Pacific herring were homozygous Ser346. Furthermore, residue 346 is located in the highly conserved PAS-B domain and Ser346 is highly conserved among vertebrates (Figure 5—figure supplement 1b), suggesting a functional significance of Ser346Thr. AHR2B2 belongs to the basic helix-loop-PER-ARNT-SIM (bHLH-PAS) family of transcription factors. AHR is cytosolic signal sensor that binds planar aromatic hydrocarbons and is then translocated to the nucleus where it forms a heterodimer with the AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT) and affect transcription (Schulte et al., 2017; Tischkau, 2020). The endogenous ligands of AHR include tryptophan-derived metabolites and dietary indoles, while the most well-known exogenous high-affinity ligand is dioxin (Schulte et al., 2017). In human medicine, AHR function is of relevance for toxicity response, inflammation, autoimmune disorders, cancer, circadian clock and for sensing bacterial virulence and thereby activate antibacterial responses and control sepsis (Schulte et al., 2017; Tischkau, 2020). It has recently been reported that a population of killifish has been able to colonize highly polluted waters due to the presence of a deletion knocking out AHR function (Oziolor et al., 2019). In herring, the derived Thr346 allele occurs at a high frequency in the least polluted waters in the North Atlantic Ocean, for example around Greenland and Iceland, suggesting that it is unlikely that this adaptation is related to the presence of exogenous metabolites. A serine to threonine change is a conservative amino acid substitution since they are both polar, neutral amino acids with a hydroxyl or methyl side chain, respectively. This suggests that this missense mutation fine-tunes rather than disrupts AHR function. Billions of herring in the North Atlantic Ocean are homozygous for Thr346 (Figure 5—figure supplement 1b). Genetic adaptation in a poikilotherm organism exposed to a wide range of water temperatures (Figure 1—figure supplement 1) must involve mutations affecting protein function in a temperature-dependent manner. Interestingly, residue 346 occurs in the ligand-binding PAS-B domain and Ser346Thr may contribute to cold adaptation by affecting ligand-binding as it dominates in populations exposed to the coldest waters (Figure 5—figure supplement 1a).\n\nThe importance of inversions underlying phenotypic variation and ecological adaptation is a hot topic in evolutionary genomics (Wellenreuther and Bernatchez, 2018). Inversions suppress recombination facilitating the evolution of ‘supergenes’ composed of a cluster of co-adapted alleles. Characterization of inversions using short read sequence data is challenging because inversion breakpoints are often embedded in repeat regions. Here we have successfully used PacBio long reads and generated conclusive evidence for inversions on Chr6 and 17 in herring (Figure 6), and suggestive evidence for a third one on Chr23. Furthermore, the individual used for PacBio sequencing was homozygous for the reference allele at the inversion on Chr12 documented in our recent study (Pettersson et al., 2019). The characteristic features of these four inversion polymorphisms are that (i) the inversion breakpoints do not disrupt coding sequence (conclusive evidence only for Chr6 and 17 so far), (ii) no allele is lethal in the homozygous condition, (iii) the inversions suppress recombination but not completely, as we find evidence for recombinant haplotypes (Figure 4—figure supplement 2), and (iv) none of the inversions is of recent origin as indicated by substantial nucleotide diversity within each haplotype group, in the range 0.11–0.31% (Figure 4—figure supplement 4). The strong genetic differentiation among populations for each of the four inversions (Figure 4—figure supplement 3) implies that these are supergenes important for environmental adaptation. It is tempting to speculate that several of these, if not all, are directly or indirectly related to the water temperature at spawning due to the relatively strong correlation between water temperatures and haplotype frequencies (Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and Figure 4—figure supplement 3). The higher nucleotide diversity for the Southern haplotype groups at each locus suggests that these may represent the ancestral state and that the derived alleles provided a selective advantage during an expansion of Atlantic herring into colder waters."
