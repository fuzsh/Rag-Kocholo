        "text": "When I was a child, my mom brought me to my first yoga class where we practiced with hand-woven yoga rugs before sticky mats had become popular. This experience laid the groundwork for a lifelong fascination with yoga, and I have practiced consistently for the past 15 years. My previous career as a freelance cellist and teacher left me frequently overworked and stressed with auditions, gigs, and lessons. I found yoga to be a centering practice that helped me to maintain balance.\n\nA new job as a Board Certified Music Therapist brought me to Madison in 2022. I soon found Inner Fire Yoga after having suffered a minor ankle injury that was taking a long time to heal. With limited prior experience practicing in a heated space, it took me some time to acclimate, but I came to love the heated practice for the way it allows muscles to loosen and helps to focus the mind. Before long, my ankle was back to normal, which I attribute to heated practice. I also found other benefits - greater clarity of thought and kindness toward others.\n\nAs a long-time cello teacher, I love helping students find their way with a new instrument and begin to make music while also engaging in self-discovery. For years I wanted to complete yoga teacher training because I love teaching and helping students to realize their potential. After moving to Madison, I enrolled in Yoga Teacher Training at Inner Fire Yoga in 2022, completing my 200 hours of training. It was a wonderful experience that helped me to deepen my own practice as well as prepared me to teach yoga effectively, with a focus on alignment and safety.\n\nIn my music therapy practice, I enjoy exploring the intersection of music and movement and how music affects the body and mind on a physiological and emotional level. While music is not necessary for yoga practice, it can be a wonderful addition. The right playlist or live music can create focus and depth in an asana or vinyasa practice. My yoga classes feature music that is intentionally designed to provide a space for mind-body connection.\n\nI began practicing yoga 26 years ago while living in New York City. My daily exercise was basically running and taking long hikes on weekends. Athletics have always been an important part of my life but I had never attended a yoga class. I decided to try my first class at the Jivamukti Yoga studio in lower Manhattan. It was super challenging. The physical, mental and spiritual benefits were felt immediately. I started a regular yoga practice, and a few years later, thought of enrolling in a teacher training but the time was not right. I was busy raising two children and working full time.\n\nUpon moving to the Madison area ten years ago, I found my yoga tribe at Inner Fire Yoga, subsequently enrolling in their 200 hour Yoga Teacher Training Program, concentrating on the Inner Fire Flow Sequence and Power Flow. I also graduated from Inner Fire Yoga's Sculpt Yoga Training and Inner Fire's Yin Yoga Training. Each of the training programs equipped me with the knowledge and confidence to teach others, and greatly improved my own yoga practice.\n\nIn teaching I try to offer challenge, humility and humor to my classes. I want every yogi in my class to follow their own path; taking care of themselves, and hopefully leaving feeling brighter, stronger and wanting more.\n\nBecoming a yoga teacher has been a dream come true for me and teaching at Inner Fire is a sincere privilege. The staff and students at Inner Fire Yoga feel like family.\n\nI am on my mat now more than ever since my son and daughter are both in college, and my husband and I find ourselves empty nesters. I am honored to share my yoga space as an instructor and student at Inner Fire Yoga.\n\nI have spent time on my mat on and off since 2011 but committed to my practice in 2015. In 2017, I quit my corporate job without any plans other than to become certified to teach. It was one of the best decisions of my life.\n\nThis experiential practice has shown me the importance of being present and has provided me a place of reprieve from the constant movement of daily life and stress. The first few times I participated in a class, I was jittery, my mind buzzing, and letting go of that on the mat seemed impossible. That was the case both in and out of class.\n\nBut now, when I enter the studio or lie on my mat and exhale, the weight of the day lifts and I just feel the support of the floor. Bringing that headspace to my daily life has been challenging, but knowing that I have that at least gives me an option to try.\n\nAlthough I entered yoga as a physical practice, like many others who stay with it, I have felt the practice transform. Now I see yoga as a practice that cultivates the relationship between breath, body, and mind. Yoga is nonjudgmental acceptance while bravely seeking one’s personal edge. To me, yoga is simultaneously freeing and grounding.\n\nIn my classes, I aim to create space for students to explore what yoga means to them through mindfully cued vinyasa and yin sequences with many options. With training in trauma-informed yoga practices, my hope is that students feel safe and empowered to practice in a way that serves their unique bodies, remembering always that asana is only one of the eight limbs of yoga. There is such magic and healing that happens when a community comes together to be present and breathe with one another and it is an honor to share that space with everyone here at Inner Fire Yoga.\n\nI currently teach Power Flow, but you may see me stepping in for Slow Flow or Yin as well.\n\nI took my first ever yoga class when I was a student in high school. Early in 2019, I began to struggle with severe anxiety, which quickly spiralled and cost me the ability to function as my best self; I was consumed in worry and unease. After some encouragement from my mom, I decided to give yoga a try to see if it provided me any mental health benefits. Wholeheartedly, that first yoga class changed my life for the better. As my class attendance increased, my anxiety slowly began to ease up and I began to feel calm for the first time in a long time. Yoga has continued to support me throughout my ever changing personal seasons of life, including periods of immense joy, devistating grief, and exciting new beginnings.\n\nCurrently, as a student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, yoga continues to be an important pillar in my life. As a college student, it’s easy to get swept up into the busyness of classes, homework, exams, clubs, and social activites. During this stage of my life, yoga is important for maintaining my mental and physical composure. Yoga is a window of time for me to focus solely on myself and to temporarily forget about my responsibilities as a college student.\n\nAdditionally, one of my favorite things about yoga is the yogi community! My yoga journey has not only provide me peace, it also has gifted me lovely friendships with people who I still hold close connections to. I’ve continued to meet so many different people within my practice who all have touched my life in various, meaningful ways. Within the Inner Fire community, I hope to embrace my valued virtues of kindness, authenticity, gratitude, and compassion. I’m looking forward to getting to know the Inner Fire community and all the wonderful things that will blossom within my experience at this studio.\n\nTruly, I owe a lot to yoga. I am grateful it lead me to where I am today, as well as the person I am today. I could not be more excited to continue my yoga journey at Inner Fire!\n\nMy name is Shelby Capp, I am 20 years old and I am currently studying Psychology at Madison College! Yoga has been a part of my life ever since Elementary school. I grew up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and moved to Wisconsin in 2016. My childhood best friend’s mom taught aerial yoga in New Jersey on weekends and we loved to tag along! When I reached high school, I took yoga every semester my schedule allowed. It anchored my mental health, fostering tranquility in the chaos. Yoga whispers self-love, it’s helped me discover a profound acceptance of myself, irrespective of societal ideals. One thing I value most about yoga is learning to be more comfortable with discomfort. Yoga has sculpted me into a more resilient, empathetic, and self-aware being.\n\nMy second year of college was a stormy sea of challenges, especially on the mental health front. Academic pressures, personal transitions, and the demands of daily life were beyond overwhelming. The weight of the expectations I was putting on myself was suffocating. I wasn’t doing yoga at all during this time but did practice meditation occasionally. After a few months of struggling, I found sanctuary in yoga. It was still inconsistent, but it helped me get back on my feet again. I learned to observe my thoughts without judgment, allowing them to come and go. The beginning of this newfound mental clarity provided respite from pressure I didn’t realize I was putting on myself. Yoga provides me with a process of self-discovery and healing. The journey is never ending and that’s the best part of it. This year of my life tested my limits but also revealed a profound strength that resided within.\n\nWhen not at the studio, you’d probably find me reading a horror book or writing poetry by the lake! I can also be a huge homebody. I have a cat named Onyx who loves to indulge in some Dance Moms and Brooklyn Nine-Nine with me, so sometimes it’s impossible to resist the urge to snuggle up and watch Jake Peralta solve some crime. On weekends I love to get together with the girls, play some games, and watch all three Pitch Perfect movies back to back. I’m so grateful for the opportunity to join such a wonderful, accepting community like IFY. I’m super excited to be part of the family :)\n\nWhat inspired you to become a yoga teacher?\n\nI can’t live without yoga – it’s physical, mental, and spiritual for me. Once I started practicing on a regular basis, I began making healthier choices, particularly around food and exercise. I also felt less anxious, more grounded, and more patient with the world around me. Yoga is my reset button when life feels overwhelming. It’s also my go-to meditation where I can go inward without distraction. I leave class feeling uplifted, energized, and focused. All these things inspired me to become a teacher so that I can share the wonders of yoga with other people. Come to the studio and explore what your wonders might be!\n\nWhat about Inner Fire Yoga made you want to teach there?\n\nI attended classes at Bikram Yoga Madison on University Avenue, before it became Inner Fire Yoga, so I’ve been in the community a long time. I wanted a closer connection though as well as a deeper understanding of my own practice, so I committed to Inner Fire Yoga’s Foundations teacher training program in Fall of 2022 and the Power Flow program in winter/spring of 2023. It was an incredible experience, and I knew that if I ever had the chance to teach at Inner Fire Yoga I would jump at it. And here I am. Thank you for welcoming me as a new teacher!\n\nWhat is unique about your classes?\n\nWhile I’m new to teaching and still settling into my style, I like to share how different poses affect different parts of our body, as well as our brains. I’m fascinated by neuroscience and how yoga and movement impact brain chemistry. I also love poetry and music, so when I find passages or songs that inspire me, I like to bring them into my classes.\n\nI have had a dedicated yoga practice for 20 years. For the first ten, I was a student, for the last ten I have been teacher and student. Over those years, I have gone to the mat to grieve, celebrate, recover, and prepare. I have gone to the mat in anger, fear, and joy.\n\nNo matter what is going on in life, my practice is always there for me. Regularly stepping away from the press of activity and turning attention to inner awareness has a profound influence.\n\nGradually, those hours devoted solely to breath, movement, and balance instill resilience and the capacity to maintain equilibrium in adversity. They even inspire a desire to greet adversity with a willing heart, because I am all in for all of this life experience – the lows and the highs. This training helps us stay calm under pressure, tolerate discomfort, and be nimble.\n\nAs a teacher, I want to inspire my students to be bold and adventurous in exploring their space on the mat – both internally and externally. I believe in testing the limits and allowing creativity to show up. There is joy to be had in moving to the edge of the familiar and challenging ourselves to try things we have never done before.\n\nI am grateful for the trust students place in me, and their willingness to journey together. I am grateful to my teachers for their wisdom and presence. I never cease to be awed by the depth of practice and the focus and commitment I see in those who show up, week after week.\n\nWhat a wonderful thing we have going! I hope to see you in class soon.\n\nAs I was writing this spotlight, I had a Facebook memory pop up - it's been 9 years since I put in my 2 weeks notice at my office job to start teaching yoga full-time!\n\nIt seemed very sudden to a lot of people and like a major leap. But I started teaching immediately after completing my Yoga Teacher Training at Inner Fire Yoga, and I knew instantly it was what I was meant to do. After just two weeks of teaching, I put in my notice at the office, and I never turned back.\n\nYoga had given me so much, and it felt so right and so wonderful to get to share that with other people. Being a full time teacher was never easy, but it has always been worth it. I remember how lucky I felt when I was teaching nearly every day of the week at Inner Fire Yoga – my home studio, the place where I'd found my community!\n\nIn addition to teaching yoga, I began teaching aerial dance and performing as an aerialist and stilt walker (all that yoga balance, strength, and mindfulness come in handy!). My life, so full of movement! What a dream!\n\nThen the pandemic came…the hardest period of my life, losing the ability to connect with others through movement, through breath, through performance. It was so hard to not just lose my livelihood, but to lose my connection to my students, and to lose my Inner Fire Yoga community. I found ways to teach outside, I tried teaching virtually (but virtual just isn’t for me), but nothing could replace the community of the studio.\n\nIt felt like I'd been away forever, so I was so excited when Marit was able to add me back to the schedule at the East studio! I'm currently leading a luscious 10am Slow Flow every Tuesday morning. It's been so nice to see old students, to connect with new students, and to just be back home at IFY! I hope you'll come join me for a Slow Flow, or say hello if you see me around the studio!\n\n- Brenda\n\np.s. - The photo I'm sharing is from my wedding last November! My partner and I perform and produce shows together, so our wedding was a mini festival - my vows starting with a dance.\n\nMy yoga journey began while I was a student in High School and was, simultaneously, immersed in preparing for a career in Opera – a highly demanding career, both physically and mentally. While navigating the normal woes of High School, I was also balancing numerous auditions, rehearsals, competitions, etc. Because of this, my Mother saw an opportunity for Yoga to become a part of my life after recently discovering the benefits of it, herself.\n\nAs one might assume, I was hooked after my first class. Since then, the practice has been my companion as I’ve moved through college – both my Undergraduate and Master’s Degree in classical voice, rehearsals, heartbreak, travels, successes, and every moment in between.\n\nWhile my love for the practice has evolved and deepened, the reasons I initially fell in love remain. Yoga has gifted me the ability to quiet my mind, center my breath, and settle into my body. Moreover, being on my mat allows me to hold the various, often complex, facets of myself at once – I am strong, I am soft, I am wise, I am a child, I am delving into the unknown, while also being my most capable, knowledgeable self. Being able to hold all of this at once, unapologetically, is the best gift to have been given.\n\nAfter completing my Yoga Teacher Training in the Summer of 2022, I knew I was ready to find a community of like-minded individuals, and ready to support others on their Yogic-life journey. Inner Fire Yoga came at just the right time :)\n\nI’m grateful to be here, and ready to be of service.\n\nAs some of you know, I am back home in Madison after spending a year in Colorado. My husband Alex and I wanted to explore the potential of living in a new place. And we did just that and more for our short time there – we explored, roadtripped, saw lots of new places, and tried something entirely new, as so many people decide to do at some point in their lifetimes.\n\nLucky for us, it didn’t take long to realize that Madison is where our hearts are, and I couldn’t be happier about it. And I realize what a privilege it is to pick up and move and then to be able to move back, especially to a community where I could fit back in so seamlessly.\n\nI’ve been able to reflect on how leaving a place that has always been special to me and then returning to the same place reminds me much of our yoga practices. Most of us are more inclined to one style of yoga than another: some of us like flowing because we enjoy the seemingly endless flow of movement facilitated by our breath. Others like the classic 26+2 hot practice because they are possibly driven by routine, predictability, and devotion. And some of us, yours truly included, prefer the still practice of yin because we like to “just be” (one of my favorite pastimes).\n\nIn reality, what most of us could use is what we don’t typically do. Some of us could slow down, some of us could move and go and see, and some of us could try something entirely different to break from habit.\n\nI’ll be the first to admit that I could have easily stayed in Madison – in fact, it was my preference at the time. However, I’m proud that I deviated from my norm and what would be my typical tendency or practice. It not only opened my eyes, but also opened doors for new opportunities as we made our return. For example, many of you know that I was an English teacher by day. This fall, I’ll be starting grad school in UW-Madison’s Curriculum & Instruction program. Thanks to the “flow” of our move, a new opportunity came about.\n\nI’m also so thankful to return to a studio that feels like home. It didn’t even feel like I left upon my return to teaching classes at Inner Fire Yoga as I was so warmly welcomed. I love my fellow instructors, the variety of classes that Inner Fire Yoga offers, and most of all the students who make the yoga community exactly what it is.\n\nFinding and seeing the beauty in something new is a very yogic practice. Honoring a desire to leave and flow is a yogic practice. Staying is also a yogic practice. I’m so thrilled to be back home in Madison, and back at my home yoga studio, to practice physically on the mat while I continue my practice off the mat as well.\n\nWho inspired you to become a yoga teacher?\n\nThe first teacher that made the largest footprint in my path to teaching is Cass Hanson. She’s an incredible human and continues to lead and inspire so many individuals. She was transformative in my life and I hope she knows how grateful I am for her presence in mine.\n\nWhat do you love the most about practicing and teaching yoga at Inner Fire?\n\nThis goes without saying, but losing in-person yoga classes during the various shutdowns of the past two years was devastating to my personal yoga practice. As much as I tried, my “home practice” never brought the same depth and joy as being surrounded by a community dedicated to moving with their breath. On recommendation from one of my best friends, I started the Intro Month at Inner Fire Yoga and was launched back into my own practice. The community of students and teachers, the yoga space and the new ideas and innovations that I’ve learned in the past few months have been outstanding.\n\nWhat is unique about your classes?\n\nIt’s pretty rare to catch me without a smile on my face. My whole heart and soul believes that you can find a positive spin on any situation and still maintain a balanced perspective. Yoga brings me an unquantifiable amount of joy and I want to be able to share that with as many souls as possible.\n\nThings you will feel in my class: support, encouragement, challenge, balance of pace and energy, and confidence to bring your best self forward without judgment.\n\nThings you will hear in my class: music, laughter, and a lot of breathing.\n\nI began my yoga journey in 2009 after my son, a student at UW, brought me to Inner fire yoga for a 90 minute hot 26 asana practice. I have been coming to Inner Fire Yoga ever since that first class.\n\nMy initial reasons for yoga practice were for the heat, stretching and strengthening, particularly of the power flow classes. Yoga was the perfect antidote to my triathlon training, which I began in 2007 and continues to this day.\n\nAs I became a regular and dedicated practitioner, yoga became more than a physical practice. Making space for myself on my mat was a way to care for myself, both emotionally and spiritually. Leaving the stresses of the outside world behind, even if for a brief period of time, was healing. Yoga has always been centering for me and a way to help me better face the stresses of caring for my patients as a transplant surgeon – my “day job”.\n\nIn 2019, I was able to complete the 100-hour Inner Fire Yoga Power Yoga Teacher Training module. And in 2020, during the pandemic, I completed the first ever all-virtual 100-hour Foundations Teacher Training module. I had been waiting for retirement (which will be at the end of 2022) to actively pursue teaching yoga. However, as with most things in life, timing is never perfect, but when an opportunity presents itself it’s important to seize the moment.\n\nWhile I am new to teaching, I am a firm believer in the philosophy that we all teach and we all learn, and that yoga should be accessible to everybody. There is so much to learn from all of the gifted instructors at Inner Fire Yoga and from all of you, the amazing yogis who are a part of our community.\n\nI look forward to infusing my classes with a little of my life experience, lots of variety and even a little humor. See you on your mats!\n\nWho at Inner Fire Yoga has inspired you and why?\n\nThe beginner – a being who: is experiencing something for the first time; or, makes a decision to set aside preconceived notions or experiences and is willing to consider something new; or, is simply willing to hit the reset button and start again. (These are just a few possible definitions…)\n\nIt is continually inspiring to be in the presence of beginners. Beginners often show humility, courage, vulnerability, strength, trust, openness, and presence all in the same moment. These traits can manifest with just one choice, to begin again. From someone stepping onto the mat for the first time, taking the shape of a dog, tree or triangle to the practitioner with hundreds or thousands of classes under their belt who for the first time says to themselves, “This does not and has not worked for me. What if I try it another way or maybe…I just leave it as it is?”, the beginner is curious. The beginner is an inspiration.\n\nWhat is unique about your classes?\n\nOf course we will probably stretch some hamstrings and strengthen our core. We will reach, twist, balance, and even take time to rest, but… you may also have the invitation to say hello to a yogi nearby whom you have never met, send a prayer to an inspirational force in your life, or sing a love song dedicated to your special someone. Again, these are just invitations and possibilities. It's up to you.\n\nIf I may send one more invitation, keep practicing. In whatever form and with whatever time you have, keep practicing. Whether that practice consists of poses on your mat, a walking meditation in the morning with your dog and a cup of coffee, or a reminder of kindness in the checkout line at the grocery store. Your yoga can happen and be practiced anywhere. More often than not it requires no preparation.\n\nI started practicing yoga at Inner Fire Yoga back in 2011. After months of regular practice, I developed a deep love for heated yoga. Friends of mine kept telling me I should go through the yoga teacher training, so during the Summer of 2013, I decided to jump in and do the Summer Intensive Teacher Training at Inner Fire Yoga. It’s been one of the best decisions I’ve made to-date!\n\nInner Fire Yoga has been my home studio for over a decade, so I love the familiarity of the studio. I have made life-long friendships that I cherish at Inner Fire Yoga. I also love the bright colors, the warm, cork flooring, and of course the candy bowl (haha). The studio has the BEST heat (in my opinion) and it always feels like home to me, no matter what is happening in my life. The instructors, management, and practitioners here are wonderful.\n\nI am inspired by literally every person I see at Inner Fire Yoga. Ranging from the yogis who have been practicing for decades, to the brand new yogis I see walking through the door who are nervous to take their first class. Recently my son started to practice at Inner Fire Yoga, so it has been really fun to watch him go from a beginner yogi to keeping a dedicated and regular practice. He’s seeing so many positive benefits similar to the ones that I still experience.\n\nMy classes are filled with upbeat playlists, bad jokes, and fun sequences. I like to have a good time and I try to keep things light-hearted and not too serious. I love to keep people on their toes and I push people to try new things. You never know what you can do until you try! I encourage people to meet me where they are on any given day, whether that be arm balances and handstands or child’s pose for an hour. You are your own best guide.\n\nI hope to see you on the mat soon!\n\nHow did you decide to become a yoga teacher?\n\nI wish I had a unique story here, but it’s pretty standard: I fell in love with yoga. I wanted to learn as much as I could, practice as much as I could, and share it with as many people as possible. This was in 2005, so it was a different scene. Yoga was less mainstream. There weren’t many options for teacher training locally, so I did an immersion program in the Berkshire Mountains.\n\nWhat do you love the most about practicing and teaching yoga at Inner Fire Yoga?\n\nInner Fire Yoga has been my yoga home for almost twenty years, and I still feel happy every time I walk in the doors. It is warm (in more ways than one) and has such a great vibe and energy. You can really feel that people are excited to be there and appreciative of the space and the people.\n\nWho at Inner Fire Yoga has inspired you and why?\n\nEVERYONE at Inner Fire Yoga has inspired me and for so many reasons. People like Marit and Dar, who have been there from the start and dedicated their lives to this community and practice. New teachers with fresh ideas and energy and hearts filled with kindness. Long-time students who make time in their busy lives to get on their mats day after day. New students who sweat and struggle and come back anyway! I am inspired and amazed by all of you!\n\nWhat is unique about your classes?\n\nMy practice and teaching have changed so much over the years, but it always comes back to experiencing yoga as a process of discovery. I want to help my students feel new things in their bodies and their poses, to gain a deeper understanding of how to get the most out of their practice. I try to encourage that process of exploration in my classes by offering a lot of options and space to allow my students to learn about the poses and practice organically.\n\nHow are you adapting your practice and lifestyle during the pandemic?\n\nMy early morning home practice has been my lifeline for many years, and that didn’t change during the pandemic; if anything it became more essential. It’s not very hard, and sometimes it only lasts fifteen minutes, but it sets the tone, mentally and physically, for every day. However, this practice hasn’t changed much over the years, and I am beginning to yearn for some change! One of my goals for the new year is to get back into some hot (Bikram) classes. I am craving the grounding and meditative quality that they offer, as well as some poses that I never do on my own.\n\nI am so humbly grateful that Inner Fire Yoga is both my work place and my Third Place. Ray Oldenberg in his book “The Great Good Place” argues that - (Home being our First, and Work being our Second Place) - the Third Place has value in that it helps shape how we see our life as it relates to others’. I have been at Inner Fire for 20 years as a student and 18 as a teacher, and IFY has been my tribe. We have been together through marriages, separations, divorces, births, deaths, loss of jobs, new jobs, promotions, grad school, surgeries, moving away, moving back, cancer treatments, retirements, a global pandemic, and so many other paradigm shifts.\n\nI feel like my teaching has waxed and waned in its authenticity as I found my voice. At first, I copied my mentors and my teachers because imitation is one of the highest forms of flattery. But in my second decade of teaching – and more profoundly since my daughter was born – I have found that my teaching (AND my practice) is actually a little universe for discovering how I want to BE; not just something I want to DO on my sticky mat. I use my mat as a microcosm in which I can safely practice my “things.” These days, these are my things:\n\nI am learning to set firm boundaries. I’ve never been good at this and as a result, I end up overwhelming myself saying “yes” to too many things or too many people. Consequently, I do nothing well because I am weary and resentful. I’m not present for the people I treasure most and certainly not present for myself. Ever. So now, I practice saying no. On my mat, what this looks like changes from day to day – sometimes skipping chaturangas or the more challenging option given…or coming to child’s pose before the teacher offers it. Surprisingly, this gives me a lot more internal landscape to be “here” – wherever here is. I am trying to value that as I teach as well - giving students permission and latitude to do their own “thing.” This also means finding our backbone – that strong spine we promote in our asanas - so that we don’t take on other people’s sh%* either.\n\nDo no harm. This seems obvious in ahimsa practice, but there are small sneaky ways that we do harm to ourselves or to others without intending to. Right now, for me, this means don’t judge. It’s quite easy and simple for me to not judge in the yoga room. But for whatever reason, in the rest of my life, I can be pretty harsh in that area – especially toward myself and toward those close to me. So I think of this as the corollary to the Golden Rule. “Don’t do to others what you would not wish done to you.”\n\nLastly, in small ways, or big ways, but all days, be of benefit. This is the call to action where the other two practices are the absences of action. Practice kindness and generosity. It’s not a natural tendency unless we practice it daily. It can only come from being content first, and grateful second. This is in sharp contrast to the exalted materialism and cold prideful ego to which we are so susceptible. So on our mat, we practice. Breathe in gratitude. Breathe out generosity. Then we can cultivate a “global warming” – the good kind.\n\nSo, there’s my practice (and my teaching) wrapped up in bumper sticker simplicity.\n\nTake no sh%*.\n\nDo no harm.\n\nBe of benefit.\n\nWhile growing up in Boulder, Colorado, I was introduced to yoga at a young age. I can’t say it was love at first class, as my 11-year-old self couldn’t stop laughing about Lion’s Breath. Many years later, I was struggling with chronic back pain that stumped my doctors, physical therapists, and chiropractors. I found that yoga was the only thing that provided relief – not only asana, but also pranayama, meditation, yoga nidra, and the inevitable self-inquiry that came with these practices. Committing to a consistent, dedicated practice ended up transforming every aspect of my life.\n\nI took my first yoga teacher training at Inner Fire in the Summer of 2017. That fall Michael Hoefferle gave me an audition to teach at the downtown studio (RIP). As an insecure 21-year-old, I vividly remember the crippling anxiety of stepping into the studio to teach a demo class to Michael, Sarah, and Erika. It wasn’t great, and Michael tells me now that he was unsure about hiring me. Nevertheless, he decided to let me teach a one 45-minute, early-morning class.\n\nI was thrilled! That year I think I picked up at least 75% of sub requests and taught as much as I could. I hoped that, with practice, I would one day teach like Sandy Homburg, Hope Henley, or Sean Ward…\n\nThe best part about being the youngest teacher at the studio was having such incredible mentors and teachers through the most transformational years of my life. I want to give a big shout out to Michael, our studio manager turned operations manager. He doesn’t teach in the sweaty yoga room, but he’s certainly a yoga teacher off the mat and has been such an important mentor to me.\n\nThanks to Michael, I now know how to say “no” to a sub request. I’ve learned how to speak with confidence, both inside and outside of the yoga room. And, most importantly, I know that I don’t have to teach like Sandy Homburg, Hope Henley, or Sean Ward – I can teach like me, Tess Kennedy.\n\nI said goodbye to Inner Fire in Summer 2019 when I moved away from Madison. I traveled to India to study yoga, then moved to the North Shore of Oahu where I worked and taught yoga on a farm. If you’ve ever left Madison, you know that this magical place has a way of drawing us back. When the pandemic hit, I returned to the isthmus. For the past year I’ve been building an online yoga community (tesskennedy.com) and leading a functional anatomy-based yoga class on Zoom. I’m a huge anatomy geek, and I love to apply current movement science to yoga to help my students cultivate body-awareness on a deeper level.\n\nI’m Kerry and I am a Hot Yoga fanatic. When I say Hot Yoga, I mean the Hot Yoga, Bikram yoga, 26 postures, 2 breathing exercises practiced in a heated, humidified room. That Hot Yoga. I love the discipline of the practice, the precision of the postures, the energy and intensity of the sequence, the feeling of having worked my body head to toe. Did I always love it? Not exactly. My first-time trying Bikram yoga was on a whim. I enjoyed it because the teacher was supportive and funny, I didn’t have to worry about quick transitions from one pose to the next which had always given me trouble, and I felt like I was getting a good workout. What I didn’t love is that my yoga teachers expected me to do all the poses according to the dialogue and not make up my own version when I found something difficult (!?!?!?). It took me a while to understand that the discipline, doing the postures as described/prescribed, is what creates the magic -- what makes it yoga and not just a workout. This is how the mind body connection is created.\n\nInstinctively most of us don’t want to do what we’re told; we like to do things our own way. Doing things the way we are told can equate to surrendering. But surrender isn’t always a negative thing. In terms of Hot Yoga and following the dialogue, it means that we are telling our ego to take a step back so we can do what is beneficial, rather than what we think we want to do. It means getting our ego out of the way in order to receive the benefits.\n\nAnd what if the exact way the posture is specified is just a little out of reach on certain days? One of the first things I learned so many years ago – try the right way. You get 100% benefit when you try the posture the right way even if you feel like you are doing less than you think you could or should – focus on form rather than depth. Don’t try to fit the yoga to your body by changing the posture, rather, do the yoga as prescribed to the best of your ability so the body receives the intended benefits and your body changes as needed.\n\nSee you on your mat!\n\nNearly a year into living a pandemic lifestyle, we’re adapting our yoga practice to fit into the constraints. Tragedies continue, too many people have to endure them alone, but sprinkled in are a few positives - like our decreased energy consumption, advancements in medical discoveries/applications, and increased use of helpful technology in daily life. We’ve adapted, which is a great skill and it’s uplifting to recognize this, while at the same time we need to choose the Covid benefits that stick after we’ve moved to the next chapter.\n\nMy practice this past year shifted away from the details around my yoga, to a more personal simple focus. Before the pandemic I put some energy into choosing where and when I practiced, and what type or temperature of a class. These days a practice might be in any room of the house, or on a trail in the woods. A space heater could be turned on inside for a treat. There might be a device or two in the room, or just me and my mat, and sometimes a cat. The sleek clothes are not important anymore; as long as there’s a little give, I don’t care. Choosing what we care about is important.\n\nTeaching virtually is very different without in-person observations, dialogue, and physical touch. I miss the real group experience and the resulting synergy so much. I see some benefits of our virtual yoga opportunities such as easy access, lower cost, and more choice on degree of interaction, which might increase participation in general. Like so many things, our pandemic lifestyle doesn’t fit into a good bucket, or a bad bucket. It’s mixed ~ a growth experience that reminds us how good we are at adapting, and to letting go of the details to tune into our right mind and be, here, now, and just practice.\n\nI have friends to thank for a good many things, but one friend, in particular, encouraged me to take a class with her at a new yoga studio that was opening in town – Bikram Yoga Madison (remember that place on University Ave next to what is now Starbucks?). My friend said the woman opening the studio was a great teacher and that the hot yoga would feel wonderful. I had no idea what I was getting into but I wanted to support my friend and her excitement in this woman’s brave new venture.\n\nThat woman is Marit Sathrum, Inner Fire Yoga Founder, and my friend was right – Marit is a great teacher and the hot yoga, though honestly overwhelming at first did, within a short time, feels AMAZING! Over the ensuing 18+ years (!) Inner Fire Yoga has grown, adapted, and created space for an amazing community of yogis from all walks of life to come together and explore - explore our breath, explore our bodies, explore ourselves, all within a welcoming atmosphere.\n\nMy own yoga practice has changed and evolved over time. Being an athletic person, my practice would initially have been described as energetic, reaching, striving, and really going for it. Back then my practice helped me find balance during a time when I was working in a demanding, high-pressure job. I’d fit classes in around my crazy schedule; not a consistent practice but I went enough to want to keep coming back. During those first years practicing I met some wonderful yogis and teachers who are still with our Inner Fire Yoga community today (you know who you are!). For me it was partly seeing those familiar faces, hearing those familiar voices that kept me coming back.\n\nFast forward a few years and two kids later. I decided I wanted to learn more about this yoga I was doing and to claim more time for myself. Would I like to teach yoga? Maybe, but would I be good enough? I wasn’t sure. What I did know was that I wanted to commit more to my yoga practice. So, in 2014, with encouragement from my family and several IFY friends I decided to attend Inner Fire Yoga’s Teacher Training program.\n\nWhat a journey teacher training led me on. I learned so much about yoga, and about myself. From the time I started teacher training until now I’ve committed to practicing yoga each weekday morning before the rest of my family wakes up. Yes, that means during a normal school year I’m awake by 5:00 am. And no, I never considered myself a morning person. I was able to do this through the same method I teach in all my classes, don’t overthink things and just focus on your next breath. When your mind starts to take control, you just aren’t sure, or you think of all the excuses, instead just focus on your next breath and see where that leads you.\n\nYoga is a lifelong journey, each moment of each day bringing possibility. If we can help train ourselves to just focus on the next breath and explore the possibilities within that, so much can open up in our life. Especially during challenging times as we’ve all been living through these past months, our yoga training really does provide us a solid foundation to move through our days.\n\nWhether you are new to yoga or someone who has been practicing for years now, it is as good a time as any to make (or renew) this investment in yourself. The Inner Fire Yoga community is here for you. I welcome you to join me in class, virtually for now, and look forward to exploring how our next breath together can be more than the one before.\n\nMy yoga practice has been a part of my life since middle school. The first time I ever tried yoga I was following along with one of my mom’s yoga VHS tapes (remember those?!) in the basement of my childhood home. What I remember most distinctly after that first class was the feeling of peace and ease. It was the first time I felt relief from my chronic anxiety. I learned from those tapes in my parents’ basement that yoga can be a powerful tool for promoting mental wellness.\n\nThroughout the years my practice has varied in frequency and intensity. I’ve gone through periods where I practiced daily, and periods where I stopped practicing for months, but I always came back to it! Yoga has been there for me during some of the hardest parts of my life: through a mental health crisis, through coming out to my family, and through the challenging (and ongoing!) process of learning how to love myself.\n\nI became a teacher to share what I have learned about yoga as a practice of self-care, self-love, and healing, as well as a tool of social justice. I am passionate about doing outreach work in our community to reach people who do not have access to traditional yoga spaces. As a trauma-informed teacher, I strive to create yogic spaces that feel safe and welcoming for all who show up, whether we’re in a studio setting, a community space, or over Zoom!\n\nI’m so grateful that I’ve been a part of the Inner Fire Yoga community for the last seven years, and I’ve been especially grateful during the pandemic that we’ve still been able to practice, connect, and be in community virtually. Yoga has been a crucial part of my self-care practice during the pandemic and I’m honored to still be able to share these practices with all of you! My hope is that when you attend my virtual classes, that you still feel seen, cared for, and nurtured, even when we can’t physically be together.\n\nI started practicing yoga in 2009. At that time my personal life and professional work life were falling apart. My wife had moved out, and my job was so stressful that I was having trouble breathing. I needed help, and had no idea where to turn. Lucky for me, my wife practiced yoga. So hoping to bridge the gap in our relationship I reached out to her: can I take a yoga class with you?\n\nMy first class was Yin Yoga with Joan. I wore a tank top and pink swim trunks - no Lululemon, no Prana. Pigeon was crazy. Why would you do that to your body!? I remember looking around the room to see if anyone else was shocked by the crazy shape the teacher was asking us to take. I saw serenity, engagement, challenge accepted in the students’ faces, and I was hooked. I practiced 4-6 times a week, sweated and strained and rang out all the pent up stress. The dust settled and I saw to live through it (not get through it) was possible. A hard path, a long path, but the start of a path nonetheless.\n\nI teach yoga to help create space for you to do the same. My classes are posture-based but incorporate meditation, concentration practices, and breath work to help connect our bodies, minds and spirits. There is no “crushing it” or landing the pose. We are on a path together, not starting or finishing, but practicing and moving along the path on each day. In my classes we take alignment seriously but not ourselves: time is spent getting into and exploring the shape, while making room for you to be you. There is nothing magical about my class. The poses are traditional, the alignment cues based on what I heard from my teachers and they heard from theirs. We shrug off posturing and modeling in exchange for finding ways to feel better in our bodies regardless of age, or assumed flexibility or stiffness, or your idea about whether you can “do” yoga or not. And when we shrug off the artifice we come closer to finding ourselves. Stop in. All are welcome.\n\nHow did you decide to become a yoga teacher? My yoga teacher story is quite simple! When I was in college I started attending yoga classes, for no special reason. However, I quickly and wholeheartedly fell in love with the practice. I adored the peace and quiet of the studio and on my mat, as well as the peace and quiet cultivated within. I loved learning new poses, but not for the sake of posing -- I knew that the poses were simply a means to something greater. I wanted to learn about what that \"greater\" was as well as the philosophy, tradition, and history of yoga. I signed up for Inner Fire Yoga's summer teacher training program and started a few weeks after I graduated college! Being able to complete teacher training was the biggest blessing.\n\nWhat do you love the most about practicing and teaching yoga at Inner Fire Yoga? Inner Fire Yoga is my yoga home! I love all of the teachers and the unique qualities of each and every one -- all of whom are so talented, reputable, and caring. I love teaching at Inner Fire Yoga just as much as practicing at the studio. Our community is strong, and I feel so welcomed, loved, and empowered by the students. The teachers and the community make Inner Fire Yoga what it is!\n\nWho at Inner Fire Yoga has inspired you and why? This is such a hard question! I will mention a few names because I owe so much to them -- I learned from the great Joan during teacher training and will forever be inspired by her. I learned how to teach yin from Michael and Dar, and Michael's yin classes are some that I have tried to consistently attend virtually! Kelly and I completed teacher training together, and I adore her soothing, calming voice and instruction. Sandy taught my first ever Inner Fire Yoga class years before teacher training, and though I had to leave the room in a sweaty panic, I came back! I miss Brenda's Friday evening classes at the studio so much, because she was often just what I needed at the end of the week! And Hally's sweet, fun, and magical classes encourage self-expression and creativity. I'm inspired by all other teachers at Inner Fire Yoga, including many who have moved on from teaching at the studio.\n\nWhat is unique about your classes? I have always tried to frame my classes in a way that students can take whatever they need, and leave whatever they don't need. I love encouraging students to be, rather than to do -- resting, pausing, breathing, and staying instead of doing, posing, moving, and going. I adore yin yoga, so I try to have a little yin within the yang! It's amazing to see how even my own practice and philosophies have shifted and changed over the years. I am constantly learning and growing!\n\nHow are you adapting your practice and lifestyle during the pandemic? Practicing during a pandemic has kept me humble and honest! I don't \"do\" as much during my practice, because that's not as important (or as hard) as just getting to my mat. For both yoga and my day job (I'm currently teaching high school English virtually), I have to separate home and work and practice. It's hard! I think I have learned so much from this period of time that I wouldn't have otherwise learned.\n\nMy journey into yoga began in 2009 when I attended my very first class at Inner Fire Yoga with Karen Rigsby. When this strong, yet sensitive woman with an entrancing voice floated around the room, I thought, “Wow, to be a yoga teacher like Karen!” A moment later, an internal voice of uncertainty discouraged that future pursuit. Every class I attended, the teacher had a defiant, imaginary assistant called 'Claire’s monkey brain’. While every Inner Fire Yoga teacher inspires me, Karen Rigsby, Sandy Homburg, Sean Ward, Joan ‘Eagle Mom’ Bleifernicht, Hope Henley, Adrienne Leslie, and Marit Sathrum specifically motivated me to become a yoga teacher.\n\nAt some point during the course of my five years of practice, that apprehensive internal voice began to encourage me with compassion. That’s when I knew it was time to endeavor into teaching. I have always felt most at home practicing and teaching at Inner Fire Yoga. It is a studio and community that has provided abundant space for me to grow as a practitioner. In a class packed with yoga mats, when we are sweating and breathing in harmony, creating space is a gift that can be translated into daily life. In my time away from the studio, I continue to create space through asana, meditation, mindful walking and hiking, as well as exploring presence for myself, loved ones, and patients in the hospital where I work.\n\nMy classes encourage practitioners to come exactly as they are, because each individual brings with him or her a unique experience, injury, personality, or belief system. All practitioners are welcome and encouraged to attend. The goal of our practice is for students to feel as if they are coming home. Whether you are practicing yoga from home, in a studio, or scheduling a private session with me, my classes aim to bring you further in touch with your body. If you are experiencing pain that is preventing you from getting in touch with your body, I’d like to help guide you home to a pain-free practice (or as close to it as possible).\n\nLet’s connect!\n\nI have been practicing yoga for 25 years. I attended my first hot class at Inner Fire Yoga Studio fifteen years ago. I was completely inspired! After attending classes for a few years, I felt a desire to learn more, dig deeper, study this age-old discipline, and I knew becoming a teacher would force me out of my comfort zone. I wanted to challenge myself. I knew if I loved the practice of yoga this much my passion for the practice would carry me into becoming a good teacher. I just had to believe it and believe in myself. I have met so many wonderful people through Inner Fire Yoga Studio, too many to mention, but I will say Dr. Ruddy has inspired me more than ever! His passion for this practice and his delivery of the practice to his students of the Hot 90 class has made me cry at times!\n\nWhen I teach my class, I try to inspire the yogis to believe in themselves and know that they are stronger than they think they are! Strength of the body leads to strength of the mind and strength of the spirit. I encourage students to just keep practicing and don't get discouraged! Yoga has a sly and clever way of sneaking up on you! My favorite saying is \"it's yoga practice, not yoga perfect!\" I love virtual teaching and virtual practice, but I truly miss the yoga room standing next to my fellow yogis sweating it out!\n\nOnce the pandemic started in March, I decided to challenge myself to run more than I usually do in the mornings before work. So I started to run what I call my \"Quarantine 10K\" each and every morning. I have not missed a morning yet! This challenge has revitalized my love of running! I love more than ever the early morning hours of summertime! This pandemic has also brought me deeper into my yoga practice! I hope my fellow yogis have found new life, peace, and good things in their lives as well as we move through this time in history.\n\nHow did you decide to become a yoga teacher?\n\nIn 2014, I decided to take Yoga Sculpt teacher training (YSTT) without the intention to ever become an instructor. I really enjoyed taking sculpt classes as a student and wanted to improve my practice by learning more about the poses and correct forms. I also wanted to learn about the sequence, the importance of music, and just wanted to meet new people and be part of a community. After YSTT, I was afraid to become an instructor – I still lacked confidence in myself. However, in 2016 I moved to Dallas and began practicing at a new yoga studio. I learned they were looking for instructors and I thought it would be a great opportunity to put the skills and tools I learned into practice. It has been amazing to see my growth, not only as an instructor but also as a person since I became an instructor. I have come out of my shell and have more confidence in myself and my abilities. I am also a better communicator, a better leader, a better public speaker, a better multitasker, and now found my voice to speak up. I had no idea when I signed up for teacher training that I would be the teacher that I am today. I have watched my own personal evolution and truly believe becoming a yoga teacher has been one of the best decisions of my life.\n\nWhat do you love the most about practicing and teaching yoga at Inner Fire Yoga?\n\nI started pharmacy school this past fall and had a hard time balancing school with my yoga practice – it took a toll on me. I was not practicing yoga as much as I needed to and I noticed I was more stressed. My body was tenser and I found myself more tired. Though these were all normal with adjusting to school, I found myself more reactive to situations. Before the spring semester started, I made a goal for myself to practice at least twice a week at Inner Fire Yoga, not including my own classes. So far, I am accomplishing my goal and practicing about two to three times a week. I love taking the early morning vinyasa classes because it really is a time for me to focus on me and start my day on the right foot. I let go of everything I need to do and truly focus on myself during my practice. I’ve noticed a huge improvement in my well-being and it has helped relieve physical and mental stress. My mind is more relaxed, I feel stronger, and it has improved my mental clarity.\n\nWho at Inner Fire Yoga has inspired you and why?\n\nAll of the students who not only practice in my class but also other yoga instructors’ classes. Our lives are busy and sometimes stressful but I think it’s admirable that students are able to recognize that and take one hour of their day to let go of everything that is happening outside the studio walls. I fully believe that we can’t take care of others until we start taking care of ourselves. Seeing students make their well-being a priority inspires me and reminds me why I even began practicing yoga ten years ago.\n\nWhat is unique about your classes?\n\nMy candlelight class is a physically challenging class, which may throw some students off. I try to incorporate a vinyasa flow, balance series, core series, and restoration all in one class. Though it is still a relaxing class, I still want to make it a challenge. As a graduate student, I sit all day in class or at the library. I want and need to move my body and find a space to relax all in one.\n\nMy sculpt class is my absolute passion. My aim as a yoga sculpt instructor is to empower each and every student through a challenging, concisely cued, fun class in which every student feels strong and seen by me. My aim is that each student can ride the beat of the music and their breath for a mind-body experience that they cannot wait to do again. It is an exciting class that feeds off the energy of the students.\n\nMy entire life I was a competitive dancer, so once I came to college and stopped dancing, I wanted to find something that would give me a great workout, but would also be something I loved. I had taken yoga before, but started taking sculpt classes in college. Once I took my first sculpt class, I knew this could be something I could take to the next level. Last summer, I finally took teacher training at Corepower Yoga in the Chicago suburbs and received my sculpt certification. I was so happy once I found out I would be able to teach during the school year too at Inner Fire Yoga. I love being able to have my peers in my classes and meet students in a different setting. The energy in the room is always so lively and every student is ready to have a great workout and a fun time while doing it. Since most of the students are around my age, it is a lot of fun that we all love working out to similar music and bonding during the class. For this same reason, the students in my classes inspire me because I see how hard they push and how often they keep coming back to take classes during the week and it pushes me to have a fresh and new fun workout every time they come back. I want to keep my workouts updated every week, so that I can keep everyone, even myself, on our toes. Due to my dance background, I always teach to the beat of the music and each new workout set will start once a new song comes on. I treat each class like a choreographed dance. I look forward to teaching more in the next semester and having student inspire me to push harder and keep up the fun workouts!\n\nI received my 200-hour Yoga Teacher Certification in June 2018 through Alley Cat Yoga in Tomah, WI and have loved every second of teaching since. I worked front desk and child care at a local yoga studio in Eau Claire throughout high school and became immersed in my yoga practice. I was constantly surrounded by inspiring role models and I knew I wanted to share the immense benefits of this practice with others. It felt like a way to give back after receiving so much from my yoga practice and those who led me along the way. My training focused primarily on Power Flow style vinyasa, but I have enjoyed learning about and adapting to other styles along the way such as Yoga Sculpt! I am always eager to learn and continually evolve as a teacher and student.\n\nInner Fire Yoga has welcomed me with open arms and I am so happy to be a part of this community. My favorite aspects of Inner Fire Yoga are the strong community and the energy that radiates in every single class. I am constantly uplifted by the students showing up for themselves day after day, the receptionists that set the tone for a welcoming space, and the manager team that has supported me and answered every single one of my questions along the way. Every time I have stepped on my mat an Inner Fire Yoga I have been challenged both mentally and physically and I have experienced personal growth as a result.\n\nIn my yoga classes, you will find a mix of creative sequences, fun playlists, and a level of accessibility that makes every student from beginners to regular practitioners feel comfortable. Modifications are always encouraged for every student to have a personalized experience! My goal is for every student to leave my class feeling stronger, more confident, and at peace with themselves. And you can always look forward to a relaxing savasana at the end, even in higher intensity Sculpt classes. Come downtown and try a class out sometime -- I’d love to connect with more yogis in the Inner Fire Yoga community!\n\nSometimes you take chances in life, and sometimes they start with a Groupon. Hot yoga entered my world in 2012 by way of stumbling upon a Groupon for one month of unlimited sweat sessions. Little did I know that several years later, this random decision to try a month of some new (to me) exercise in the form of heated yoga, would change the course of my life.\n\nBefore I started working at Inner Fire Yoga, I worked at an office job for six years, which eventually became unbearably uninspiring to my soul. Choosing between leaving or staying in the 9-5 rise and grind routine haunted me for many reasons and many years, yet I continued to stay in the fear and unknown. I feel that it is the Ego that keeps us small and ’safe’ during these times of uncertainty. The closer you get to the edge of change or the change itself, the scarier your reality seems. Then, the stars align and something inside you makes the call.\n\nEarlier this year, I finally decided that it was time to make my career change. I had my Aha! moment deciding to become a yoga teacher in a Yin Yoga class in 2017 in the exact same room I started practicing in five years prior. I completed Inner Fire Yoga’s 200 hour teacher training in 2018, and in the spring of 2019 I left the corporate world to embrace teaching, practicing and soaking up as much yoga as possible. It was one of the most frightening yet freeing decisions I’ve ever made.\n\nIn my experience, taking the leap is absolutely worth every second. From signing up for that Groupon years ago, to enrolling in yoga teacher training, making a career change that almost scared me to death, to waking up everyday and choosing to keep showing up and practicing. If you’re thinking of taking a risk or making a change, however small or insignificant or unreal it may seem, go for it!\n\nAs the Assistant Manager and yoga teacher at Inner Fire Yoga and Spa Attendant at KOSA Wellness Spa & Retreat, I can now confidently say, I love what I do for a living. Working for not one but two woman-owned small businesses, I find myself feeling proud and passionate about the work I do now more than ever. This career change and path opened up a whole new direction for me to follow. It’s a world of knowledge, healing, growing and trusting. Similar to taking a chance every time we arrive on the mat, it’s the uncomfortable and the unknown that continues to help us grow so much. I’ve come to appreciate the level of awareness this practice has developed in me. I love being so in tune with my body, mind and spirit. The world of yoga is an interesting one. For me, it is physical, it is emotional, it is spiritual, it is mysterious and informative. Sometimes, I wonder if yoga chooses us. The students will forever be my teachers. Keep choosing to show up.\n\nI decided to become a yoga teacher after many years of practicing diligently. One particularly cold winter, hot yoga was my everything. I went to yoga 6 or 7 times a week, revving up in the morning and calming down at night. I practiced so much that I lost the point of it, and started just to flow through the motions without presence or patience. I decided to make a commitment to more intentional learning and signed up for a 200-hour teacher training. It was during this training that I became so much more present and aware of all of the magic that was happening on the mat. I deepened my postures by learning the anatomy of each pose. Focusing on alignment and bone structure, I found that so much more was available to me than just waiting to move on to the next sequence.\n\nWhen I first moved to Madison in 2015 I work traded at Inner Fire's west side studio because I wasn't in a financial place where I could afford a membership. I fell in love with the variety of teaching styles, the wide range, and availability of classes, and the obvious passion that teachers pour into the studio walls. I'm so thrilled and humbled to be part of IFY's teacher team, and have finally found a space where I feel like I am learning and teaching in balance. I am inspired by (it's ironic because of her name), Hope Henley! I always, always, always leave her classes feeling grounded, inspired, and in touch with my body and the Inner Fire community.\n\nI was recently asked what makes my classes unique. Well, for one, my classes are intense! Guaranteed to give you a powerful workout, I look to push people to their physical limit because that's where I believe mental growth and stillness can most naturally occur. I rely on music to carry my classes and spend a lot of time curating playlists that work with my sequences. I never know exactly where we will go when I walk into a yoga class, so my classes are also creative, unique and never the same twice. I teach on Tuesday evenings at 6 pm and Thursday mornings at 6 am, both at the Eastside studio. Come check one out for yourself!\n\nWhen I first started my yoga and fitness journey, I never dreamed that I would one day be an instructor. I always found myself comparing myself to others and focusing on the most skilled person in the class rather than my individual growth. It wasn’t until I was approached by the owner of my home studio that I realized that I actually had the potential to teach. At first I was hesitant to begin teacher training because I doubted my own abilities. After speaking with my favorite instructor she told me that everyone has the ability to teacher and every yoga and fitness instructor is still developing their practice. In completing my pilates instructor certification I learned more about myself than I did about pilates.\n\nI fell in love with Inner Fire before I began instructing, and after completing my teacher training I dreamed of potentially bringing my class to Inner Fire. I was astonished by the humility and approachability of the staff at Inner Fire when they gave me the opportunity to teach. I felt welcomed into the Inner Fire family even without my formal 200 hour RYT. Not only was the staff at Inner Fire incredibly kind but the students were also receptive and diligent. Each class is challenging yet exciting and I have seen myself develop physically and mentally to better at as an instructor. Inner Fire facilitates an environment where students and instructors can both grow and learn from one another.\n\nEverytime I step into the Inner Fire I am always greeted with a smile whether its that of another instructor, receptionist, or student. No matter what is happening in my personal life I know I can come to Inner Fire and escape the outside chaos for a little. I have at one point been inspired by all of the staff at Inner Fire, but I have found myself constantly inspired by Jamie Mustful. She never fails to provide a smile and a sense of calm and reassurance on days where I may be doubting myself. I feel very privileged to be apart of the Inner Fire family and to have individuals like Jamie as not only colleagues but also as friends.\n\nMy desire to go deeper into yoga motivated me to become a yoga teacher. It’s been a humbling and fun journey that isn’t over because there’s still so much to learn, but I’ve enjoyed sharing what I know so far with others so they too can feel the benefits of yoga. There’s nothing like being on the receiving end of an honest thank-you.\n\nI reflect sometimes about how a group gets together for a class at IFY, each person at a different moment in life with varying stress levels from jobs, age, kids, health challenges, etc. It’s uplifting to see these different people, each in a different chapter of life, all together in the same room forming similar shapes, maybe even breathing in unison, and practicing being in the now. One of these fellow students, Margery Biel, has been someone I’ve looked up to for many many years, figuratively as I’m nearly double her height. I’d try to lay my mat down nearby thinking I’d absorb some of her calm cool strength she quietly exudes in Hot 90 classes. I confessed my secret admiration to Margery recently and she laughed like I was joking. I wasn’t. This woman, who has battled brain surgery and is back in the studio practicing, continues to inspire. Margery extends her gratitude to everyone at Inner Fire who has helped and supported her over the past 6 months.\n\nThere are many others at IFY that inspire me, while I’m teaching and practicing, and that’s what I love most about the place.\n\nI first arrived on my Inner Fire yoga mat in 2010, taking a 90-minute “Intro to Hot Yoga” class in sweatpants and long-sleeves and lived to tell the tale. This latest adventure was -- at the time -- an antidote to a high-stress job and a new way to move my body after an extended love affair with long-distance running and the repetitive injuries that hobby delivered. I expected Inner Fire Yoga would be a temporary respite while I recovered from my injuries; nevertheless, my practice stuck across the years. I found something on my yoga mat that was missing in other activities in my life – my muscles lengthened, my flexibility increased, and my mind became quieter with every class.\n\nEventually, my Hot Yoga love affair led me to answer the whisper in my brain to try Hot Yoga teacher training early in 2017. My intent was to simply get technically better in practice and to love my yoga practice a little more – not to teach (Never teach! No! I couldn’t!) – but as it turns out, teaching was something I genuinely enjoyed. I ultimately completed my 200-Hour Yoga Teaching Certification through Inner Fire Yoga by the end of that year.\n\nWhat I love most in practicing at Inner Fire Yoga is the unexpected community I’ve found – both among fellow students I’ve rolled my mat out next to and the teachers who lead our classes. I have found myself bringing both my celebrations and my challenges to my mat at Inner Fire over the years as a student, and I look forward to now being part of this team that helps create that consistent, safe space for its students within our Inner Fire Yoga studios.\n\nHow did you decide to become a yoga teacher?\n\nI started practicing yoga in January 2009. I was going through some hard personal stuff at the time and practicing yoga became a way to get re-grounded, to get out of my head and thoughts, and to reconnect with my physical reality. I found that a regular yoga practice helped me gain mental clarity and focus, helped reduce stress, and generally set me in a better mood. I also lost some extra pounds and just felt overall stronger physically. In the Fall of 2010 I had a semester off from my other job of teaching English at UW-Whitewater, and I decided to attend a week-long teacher training yoga retreat led by Baron Baptiste in Tulum, Mexico. The Baptiste training combined intense physical practice with a mode of self-exploration and inquiry that really resonated with me. I came back excited to explore teaching opportunities around town. I went back to Tulum in 2012 for the second half of my 200 hour teacher training. I am excited to share more about Baptiste trainings with anyone who might be thinking about a yoga retreat!\n\nWhat do you love the most about practicing and teaching yoga at Inner Fire Yoga?\n\nLike so many Inner Fire yogis, I really enjoy practicing in a heated studio. The heat can feel amazingly cleansing and restorative, regardless of the time of year or type of class. I love hot yoga in the winter, but I think hot yoga in the summer might even be better! Aside from the heat, though, it's really the people that make a studio great, and I think we're lucky to have such a warm and welcoming community of yogis at Inner Fire. I love seeing the familiar faces when I go to a class like Karen Rigsby's 7:00 am IFF. Teaching at Inner Fire is an opportunity to deepen my connection to this yoga community. It's also exciting to be a part of a group opening and building a new community at our East Side location.\n\nWho at Inner Fire Yoga has inspired you and why? I recently looked up my class history on MindBody and was happy to see that I took my first class at Inner Fire just over ten years ago and the teacher was Angie Carlson. I'm still going to Angie's classes ten years later! (And, fun fact, she's now my son's teacher over at West High.) Over the years, I've been lucky to learn from so many great and inspiring teachers at Inner Fire -- Joan Bliefernicht, Julie Logue, and Karen Rigsby to name a few. Also-- big shout-out to all the great male teachers at IFY! I love learning from all the different teachers at Inner Fire. Each one brings their own unique perspective and energy to their class, so you are constantly learning something new.\n\nI began yoga at Inner Fire in 2012 as a New Year's Resolution to reduce stress, and I’ve been practicing regularly ever since. Inner Fire has always been my yoga “home”. I love the heat, the teachers, the range of classes, the way yoga calms my mind and stretches my body, and most of all, the community. I’ve completed multiple personal revolutions and over 1000 classes!\n\nSo when I retired from a 20-year career teaching history at West High School in Madison, it seemed like a natural progression for me to use my new-found time to deepen my yoga practice and turn my teaching experience toward yoga. In yoga teaching, I’m finding so many of the same rewards I found in my high school teaching career: the challenge of sharing knowledge, the opportunity to help others find their own understanding and, even more, the chance to build relationships and community in my classes. I’m excited to be part of the new crop of teachers at Inner Fire Yoga East and look forward to helping it grow.\n\nI am grateful to so many of the Inner Fire Yoga teachers who have inspired and taught me over the years. There are almost too many to count. I’ve loved and learned from Brenda and Angie’s calmness, Sandy’s gentleness, Adrienne’s joyfulness, Dar’s exactness, Hope’s grounding, Joan’s teacher training, Karen’s knowledge, and Kate’s experience... Each one of them (and others), at one time or another, have generously taken the time to share their expertise and yoga wisdom with me whenever I’ve asked.\n\nSome non-yoga things about me: I was born and raised in New Jersey and went to college in New York. I’ve been in Madison for over 30 years, teaching and raising two wonderful children. In some ways, I’ve become a midwesterner, but that accent you may hear when I talk, - and my tendency to talk fast -- is my New Jersey coming out. When I’m not practicing yoga, you may find me reading, baking, hanging out with friends, reading too much online news, or taking long walks on the bike path.\n\nI decided to be a yoga teacher because I love the practice and I love making an impact on people’s lives. I was a dancer and I loved moving to music and being able to just be free and let loose. However, as I got older I quit dance to play soccer and lacrosse. As time passed I missed being able to dance and let loose to music while still exercising, therefore I decided to try a Yoga Sculpt class with my mom and instantly fell in love. I loved that you could be with yourself and jam to music while still getting a workout. I also loved the aspect that teachers could have such an impact on the students. I realized at that point I wanted to become a teacher not only because my love of the practice, but also the way I could change people’s lives.\n\nI love the fact that I can teach students who love the practice as much as I do. I think it’s also especially fun that I know my students on a more personal level because I see them at school. I love practicing at this studio because of the location and the beauty of the studio.\n\nMy students are my inspiration and are the reason why I want to continue teaching. Even on the days when I am exhausted, my students give me the positive energy and motivation to want to teach and give them the best workout they can get anywhere in Madison.\n\nMy passion for yoga started after my mother introduced me to my first yoga sculpt class when I was 15. I immediately fell in love! Yoga sculpt quickly became a staple of my weekly routine. I was attracted to the mental benefits of a conventional yoga class mixed with the strength-building exercises of a high intensity workout.\n\nLast summer, I decided to take my love of yoga one step further by signing up for yoga sculpt instructor training. I always had the idea of one day becoming certified, so when my home studio in Minneapolis announced they would be offering teacher training over the summer, I knew I was ready to step out of my comfort zone. I wanted to share my love of yoga sculpt with other students on campus.\n\nMy first few months of teaching at Inner Fire Yoga have been a wonderful experience. The community of students and teachers is truly amazing. I love the strong loyalty to Inner Fire Yoga by so many students. It’s also very exciting to see all the new faces who come each week to try Inner Fire Yoga for the first time. I view my class as an opportunity to make a difference in the lives of others. With many of my yogis being fellow college students, I strive to help them disconnect with the pressures and commitments of being a student and reconnect with themselves. I want them to leave feeling empowered, refreshed, and ready to conquer whatever they will face outside of the four corners of their mat. I look forward to teaching many more classes in the future and helping my students get the most out of their practice.\n\nLike everyone else, I am not perfect, but I like to share what I learn. I love teaching because I find great enjoyment in sharing the knowledge that has inspired and impassioned me. I am most at home when I am fully present, in the teaching zone, with the students and I in one cohesive unit. For me, teaching yoga is a never-ending process of learning through the reciprocal relationship between the teacher and the students. The students assist me to learn and to be aware of their needs. I wish for us all to find our compassion, honesty, faith, and confidence together.\n\nWhat initially attracted me to practicing at Inner Fire yoga was the heat (my hometown is hot…Madison, not so much). Later, I began to love the variety of yoga classes guided by passionate teachers who embrace the heartfelt sharing of their knowledge and wisdom. I learned that some teachers create their sequence from their heart, some teach spiritually and some focus on the anatomical alignment. It all fascinates me and makes me want to learn more about what is beyond the physical practice. Investigating these aspects of yoga (for my own practice) led me to teacher training. Very quickly I realized that through teaching I was guiding others on their journey and I achieved the same peace as I did by pursuing my own practice.\n\nThere are countless teachers who have inspired me on my yoga journey. Rather than list them all, I would like to call out Sandy Homburg as an example. Sandy taught me above all to treasure the relationship between the teacher and student. At the end of each class Sandy often thanks students for showing up on the mat, so she can teach. Teaching is a form of service in that the teacher is always there for the students to offer wisdom without holding anything back. When Inner Fire Yoga decided to hire me, I told Michael that he is brave to do so. It means a lot to me to know that Inner Fire Yoga trusts me to devote my passion to our community and the students. In this community, we breathe, practice, and grow together.\n\nI decided to become a yoga teacher after my freshman year of college. I grew up as a dancer and so I have always been someone who feels grounded through movement. During my first year at UW-Madison, I started to practice yoga more regularly, and the combination of breath and movement grounded my life through a period of change.\n\nI love to teach at Inner Fire Yoga because there are new yogis walking in and out of our doors all of the time. Especially during this time of year, newcomers to Madison are looking for a new routine and they bring great energy into our space. Our yogis are passionate and hungry to learn. They are willing to try new ideas and postures.\n\nOne of my favorite parts about teaching yogis at Inner Fire Yoga is seeing the emotional experience take place throughout practice. I LOVE people who show emotion in their practice. People who aren’t afraid to laugh out of joy in Sculpt or use an audibly textured breath to release emotions during a flow of Sun A. I love when I’m teaching in a room and I can feel the intention oozing out everyone. This is what brings me back to my mat and back into class to teach.\n\nHi Every Body!\n\nI want you all to know that after all this time, I still look forward to seeing you each day and getting on the mat. If I knew in 1970, when I took my first class at the UW Dance Department, that this would be a lifeline throughout my life, I could not even imagine it. Life happens as we are busy making other plans….\n\nI see you and know you, (especially your body); although I may not know your name(it’s a Boomer thing.) it continues to be my joy and pride to meet you in the hot room each and every day.\n\nTeaching yoga classes and workshops and teacher trainings across the globe for over 40 years is one of the greatest joys of my life. It wasn’t until Inner Fire Yoga, where I had the auspicious opportunity to teach yoga full time and live my dream.This single studio has allowed me to raise my son alone and have free time for him while maintaining good health, and continued inspiration as a single mother to stay the course.\n\nAfter teaching/taking over 15,000 classes over these many years at Inner Fire Yoga, and many other places, I realize how amazing this personal growth and disciplined journey has been. At Inner Fire Yoga I’ve been able to expand my knowledge of so many yoga forms and philosophies through our unique and amazing teachers in-house and world-class guest teachers who visit the yoga room and give their gifts; including Max Strom, Theresa Murphy, Wade Morrissett, Rolf Gates, Esak Garcia, Bryan Kest, senior Anna Forrest teachers, and many more. I am so grateful to be at the center of so much yoga and growth.\n\nI am deeply honored and humbled by this gift and my continued ability to give it back to you.\n\nOh, and I’ve also done many other things in life. I worked as an advertising executive in LA for a magazine publisher (LA WOMAN), a TV producer and talk show host, a publisher, writer and journalist, a fashion editor, a model and actress, a social worker in Paterson NJ, a professional modern dancer in San Francisco, a world traveler. In New Mexico I was a nationally syndicated columnist on finding love through newspaper tele-personals (a precursor to Match.com and facebook). Currently I’ve been organizing my lifelong writings and trying to put them into some shape, in order to publish a memoir. I’ve lived in the courts of kings, and in humble abodes. I’ve been deeply in love a few times.\n\nMy entire beloved family passed away in 14 months in 2011. Life is amazing and full spectrum. I get up every day with gratitude. My only child is 26; a sensitive, brilliant, and heartfelt human who amazes me each and every day.\n\nRecently I am deeply interested in mindfulness and Yin Yoga, and expanding more and more as a human and teacher.\n\nI am off to the 10-year celebration of BhaktiFest in Joshua Tree National Monument, on to LA,( as you read this,) and, of course, there will be some Hollywood glitter and fun involved.\n\nNamaste my dear dear fellow human beings.\n\nBreathe, Feel, Flow and … Keep it REAL..\n\nAs Always,\n\nDar\n\nWhat are some things Inner Fire Yoga may not know about you?\n\nI was an Art and Design major in college. I love doing anything creative! I’ve spent lots of time decorating all the beautiful homes I have lived in. I also adore baking and tweaking recipes to make them my own, sending off a platters of cookies to friends. I used to be an avid runner. I have run over 10 marathons and many halves, but yoga is better for me now!\n\nI practice Hot Yoga when I travel. I have done it in so many cities and it is just amazing; the same, but different! I’ve practiced in NYC, Brooklyn, Miami, Washington, D.C., Boston, New Smyrna Beach, Port Orange, Paris, Chicago, Milwaukee, Charleston, Ormond Beach: next on my list are Key West and Cancun!\n\nTell us about some jobs you had before teaching at Inner Fire Yoga?\n\nBabysitter, Print shop, Memorial Union, Commercial Artist, 26 Years with US Cellular Corporate and Government Sales, NOW First Weber Realtors. LOVE IT!!!\n\nWhat is your favorite place to visit or vacation?\n\nMy home in Florida, on the Atlantic side, beautiful beaches, NYC to see my oldest daughter and Washington, D.C. to see youngest daughter at college. I love D.C., so pretty and historic. I love St. Augustine Florida, may be my next home! Oldest city in the United States.\n\nFavorite movie or tv show and why?\n\nThe Great British Baking Show, love it! We watched all the episodes and then watched them all over again...can’t get enough of it. I tried some of the recipes and they were challenging. Mary Berry yeah!\n\nFavorite concert?\n\nMadame Butterfly and Les Mis, does that count?\n\nFavorite things to do when you are not at Inner Fire Yoga?\n\nSpend time with my daughters, we have fun no matter what, but shopping is always good. I love to hike, my husband and I just went to Mirror Lake State Park, so gorgeous! Anything active!\n\n1. What are some things Inner Fire Yoga may not know about you?\n\nI started doing yoga when I returned from my first adventure to South America. I had been carrying a backpack and living a fairly nomadic lifestyle for about a year and my back HURT. I knew I needed to do something about it, so I joined yoga. I fell in love with it and my back felt more strong and flexible than ever. I noticed my posture improving and people began to comment on how healthy I looked. I continued to practice yoga diligently for about a year alongside cardio and strength training workouts, but then I was itching to return to South America. I decided to go on a backpacking trip for 1.5 months by myself. This backpacking adventure brought me to Torres del Paine. During my hike there, I carried my full backpack (which weighed about 45 pounds) the entire time during the day and did yoga every morning and every night. To my surprise, my back NEVER hurt during my entire backpacking journey!! I love this practice for the physical and mental health it has brought into my life.\n\n2. Tell us about some jobs you had before working at Inner Fire Yoga?\n\nI have had many jobs ranging from working at McDonald’s to working as an Outreach Coordinator in pre-college programs. Each job I have had has taught me something new, and I always end up meeting amazing people along the way. One of my favorite jobs was teaching English in Chile, which then led me to teaching Spanish long-term as a sub at a high school for about a year. I have always enjoyed working with children and cannot get enough of their uplifting energy, inquisitive nature, and unique perspective of the world.\n\n3. What is your favorite place to visit or vacation?\n\nA place that will always be in my heart is Chile. I have spent about 1.5 years living in Chile and traveling to a few other countries in South America, so I have been fortunate enough to meet and stay connected with many people who live there. I consider them my second family. Viva Chile!!\n\n4. Favorite movie or tv show and why?\n\nCurrently, I have been watching Drunk History. I enjoy it because it’s funny, but I also have been learning a lot of history that we were not taught in school.\n\n5. Favorite concert?\n\nLast year when I was working at Inner Fire Yoga, the members of Beats Antique came in to do yoga before their show. I did not recognize them, but was chatting with them asking what brought them to town. They told me they were doing a show at the Majestic and they were the members of Beats Antique. My face must have lit up when they said it because they ended up putting my name plus one on the entry list for the show that night. The show was incredible and the artists were so friendly!\n\n6. Favorite things to do when you are not at Inner Fire Yoga?\n\nI love to spend time outside and to be active. This summer, I am playing Ultimate Frisbee and have been having a lot of fun with it! I think it’s important for adults to focus on play outside of work, so this has been a nice way to channel my inner child and play outside during the summer. I also love to cook (and eat of course!) and very much enjoy getting fresh ingredients from the farmer’s markets around Madison and cooking a new dish.\n\nWhat are some things Inner Fire Yoga may not know about you?\n\nI was born in Madison, but I lived in the UP of Michigan from 2001 until 2016, when I moved back to Madison. My junior year at Northern Michigan University, I produced a 120-minute documentary film. My favorite snack is cheese and crackers -- I'm actually drooling just thinking about it. My next dog is probably going to be a St. Bernard, because they're big and drooly and dopey and I love all of them. I've been told I have a knack for accents and funny voices. I'm a Virgo, so I prefer plans and order to chaos and spontaneity. The following things are on my bucket list: start/join a band, write a novel, live in a foreign country, grow my own vegetables, and run a small business.\n\nTell us about some jobs you had before working at Inner Fire Yoga?\n\nI worked at a public radio station for 3 years, where I operated the sound board, announced news and weather, hosted jazz music shows, and produced podcasts. When I moved back to Madison, I was an Office Administrator for a software company, then I was a Social Media Coordinator for a cosmetology school. Now I am a Development Projects Coordinator for The Nature Conservancy, and of course you can always find me behind the front desk at Inner Fire on Sunday evenings.\n\nWhat is your favorite place to visit or vacation?\n\nCape Cod, Massachusetts. My dad grew up just outside of Boston, so he used to vacation on the Cape as a kid, and now he carries on the tradition with us! I've probably gone over a dozen times in my life (including once while I was in the womb, I'm told) and it never gets old. The freshest clams you could possibly imagine, lazy beach days, late night games of Cards Against Humanity, the proud LGBTQ+ community in Provincetown, the humbling experience of whale watching, and spending quality time with family and friends -- my little paradise!\n\nFavorite movie or tv show and why?\n\nI love pretty much any Marvel movie. The classic battle of good vs. evil really just tugs at my heartstrings. I love the playful banter between characters, too. My personal favorite is Thor and the Hulk in Ragnarok -- so goofy. The complex universe is really fun to watch, what with all the different kinds of mystical creatures and their special abilities. I also love the clever nods to classic comic book stories, which I normally don't catch -- luckily my fiance is a comic book dude and he explains them to me.\n\nFavorite concert?\n\nOne of the best concerts I've ever seen was Mumford and Sons at Okeechobee Music Festival in 2016. They're an incredibly tight band, and so passionate and honest every time they play. I wasn't a real fan until I heard them live. They really take you on a ride, and the fans are pretty wonderful so the crowd always has amazing vibes. I saw them a second time at Austin City Limits later that year -- just as good as the first time!\n\nFavorite things to do when you are not at Inner Fire Yoga?\n\nI like to hang out with my wonderful fiance, David, and my two perfect dogs, Quinzee and Jitterbug. I love good food, good beer, and great friends, so I can also be found frequently at restaurants, breweries, and the Union Terrace enjoying the company of the people that I love. Other hobbies include making music, experimental cooking, journaling, and dancing in the moonlight.\n\nTell us about why you began practicing at Inner Fire Yoga:\n\nI started doing yoga in 2013, when I was having a rough time in my life. I broke up with the love of my life, who I thought I would marry. I had no job, no car, and no money. For a couple years, my friend Tracy tried to get me to come and practice yoga.\n\nWhen I was at the lowest point in my life and I felt like I had nowhere to go, somehow faith brought me to Inner Fire Yoga. I started doing yoga for trade and soon after that I became a receptionist. Practicing yoga gives me peace and helps me slow down and enjoy life. I have to say I don't know what I would do without yoga. Everyone who comes here has their own story. Especially, now, Inner Fire Yoga studio is like my other family. I have built so many relationships with everyone here. I feel like I could never leave!\n\nTell us about some jobs you had before working at Inner Fire Yoga:\n\nSomething you might not know about me is that I am a jack of all trades. I was a bank teller after college, and then I worked at AAA for 6 years as a travel consultant. After my undergraduate degree I went back to school to become a cosmetologist. Meanwhile, I was a bartender, hair stylist, and barista. I was working five jobs at one point. It was crazy, but good and kept me happy and out of trouble.\n\nWhat is you favorite place to visit or vacation?\n\nOne of my favorite places to travel is San Diego, or anywhere with water. As a Leo, I'm a fire sign and water really calms me down. I have been to Hong Kong, Jamaica, Punta Cana, Tokyo, and all different parts of U.S.\n\nWhat is your favorite concert?\n\nI am a cheapskate, and I don't go to a lot of concerts. I do enjoy attending The Kissers, an Irish band, every year. But if someone wants to take me to a concert, I won't say no.\n\nWhat are some things Inner Fire Yoga may not know about you?\n\nI act very American, but deep inside of me I am very Chinese. I grew up in Hong Kong until I was 14 years old. I try go back to visit every 4 or 5 years. I speak fluent Cantonese. Things I like to do are hanging out with friends and coworkers. I love taking short weekend trips and go paddle boarding. I also love to hike, dance, and go boating in the summer. I also love cooking!\n\nSarah has been working at Inner Fire Yoga since 2012. She’s our Thursday night receptionist at West, makes all of our Honorary Yogi bracelets, sends out our charity donations, runs payroll and much more. She has also taken nearly 800 Hot 90 classes since 2011!!!\n\nWhat are some things Inner Fire Yoga may not know about you?\n\nI am a total animal lover! Our family includes 5 dogs (3 Australian Shepherds and 2 Whippets), a cat (who thinks she's a dog!), an African Gray Parrot, and assorted tropical fish. My daughter is a senior in college in Montana and my son is a senior in high school, so my husband Craig and I will be \"empty nesters\" soon. It might be a good time to get some more pets to fill the void! :)\n\nTell us about some jobs you had before working at Inner Fire Yoga?\n\nBesides greeting clients at the front desk every Thursday evening at Inner Fire, I process the payroll for the West and Campus Studios. In addition, I work full-time as a Client Relations Coordinator at Sauk Point Veterinary Clinic. My previous jobs have included being a preschool teacher, owning a small business, and working as a dietitian with diabetes patients.\n\nFavorite place to visit or vacation?\n\nAnywhere outdoors (preferably near mountains and water!) where I can totally unplug with my family.\n\nFavorite movie or tv show and why?\n\nI don't watch much tv, but I currently LOVE the show, This is Us. I can't get through an episode without crying.\n\nFavorite concert?\n\nI really enjoyed seeing the Indigo Girls in concert last year. It was an intimate setting and they really connected with the audience.\n\nFavorite things to do when you are not at Inner Fire Yoga? Hiking, camping, baking, cuddling with my dogs, and relaxing with friends with a glass of wine."
