        "text": "Railway station in Haan, Germany\n\nHaan station is a through station in the town of Haan in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. It has two platform tracks and it is classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 5 station.[2]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe station was opened in 1885 on the Gruiten–Köln-Deutz railway, which was completed between Gruiten and Opladen by the Bergisch-Märkische Railway Company on 25 September 1867. The station building, which is a replica of a station in Massachusetts, was finished in 1899.[6][7] Since 26 May 1993, it has been heritage-listed.[8] Until the 1980s, there was a freight yard located at the present site of the construction market in Böttingerstraße. In 2007, the station surroundings were redesigned and bicycle parking and additional car parking were built.\n\nTransport services\n\n[edit]\n\nThe station is served by the Rhein-Wupper-Bahn (RB 48) between Wuppertal-Oberbarmen and Cologne twice an hour during the day, with one train an hour to/from Bonn-Mehlem.[9]\n\nIt is also served by four bus routes operated by Rheinbahn: O1 (every 20–40 minutes), 784 (20), 786 (20–60) and 792 (20–60).[9]"
