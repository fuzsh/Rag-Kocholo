        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe compilation of the Comprehensive Ocean–Atmosphere Dataset (COADS) as documented by Slutz et al. (1985) and Woodruff et al. (1987) has provided climate researchers with the most complete record of surface marine climate to date. The availability of this dataset has contributed significantly to advancing our understanding of the atmosphere–ocean climate system. In addition to observational studies based on COADS, atmospheric and oceanic modelers have relied on this dataset for boundary conditions in long-term integrations of atmospheric and oceanic circulation models.\n\nIn addition to the directly observed quantities (sea surface temperature, surface air temperature, etc.), COADS monthly mean summaries include, at a 2° × 2° spacing, a wealth of derived quantities such as moisture and pseudo-oceanic fluxes in which transfer coefficients have been ignored. In an attempt to extend and to improve the oceanic fluxes in COADS, a collaborative project between the Department of Geosciences of the University of Wisconsin—Milwaukee (UWM) and the National Oceanographic Data Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was initiated. The main goal of this project was to produce high-resolution (1° × 1°) stability-dependent heat and momentum fluxes, as well as evaporation, precipitation, and radiational fluxes, which were absent from the COADS monthly mean summaries. In addition to improved resolution and boundary layer parameterizations, a new scientific Beaufort equivalent scale was developed that reduces wind speed bias and artificial wind speed trends in the post–World War II period. This dataset is called the UWM/COADS (da Silva et al. 1994). The purpose of this work is to investigate the accuracy of precipitation estimates in the UWM/COADS data.\n\nPrecipitation is probably the most important product of our climate system. Its links to the hydrologic cycle and energy fluxes make it the main source of heat for the atmosphere. As such, precipitation is the key to understanding the behavior and changes of the earth system.\n\nAccurate measurements of precipitation at sea are extremely difficult to make. The pitching and rolling of a ship in heavy seas along with large waves and sea spray prevent the typical volunteer observer from measuring this important quantity with any accuracy. As a result, precipitation rate is not included in ship reports. However, the type of weather the ship encounters is recorded as a standard part of a ship's observation. Present and past weather are recorded using code numbers designated by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO 1974).\n\nTucker (1961) developed an estimate for precipitation rate by using the present weather (PW) code of standard reports. The PW is reported as often as every 3 h (usually less frequently), and the results are coded from 00 to 99. Tucker considered that only weather associated with codes 50–99 contributed significantly to precipitation. Using data from 12 stations around the British Isles, Tucker derived a regression formula that defines precipitation during a 3-h sampling interval as light, moderate, or heavy precipitation (x, y, and z respectively). Each PW code is expressed as a linear combination of x, y, and z as shown in Table 1. Tucker's estimates for these coefficients are x = 1.85, y = 5.66, and z = 8.13 mm (3 h)−1.\n\nBecause the PW does not have an adequate range to accommodate the Tropics, Dorman and Bourke (1978) derived an additional correction, which takes into consideration the local air temperature Ta,\n\nPcorrectedPTuckerabTacT2a(1)\n\nDorman and Bourke (1978) give correction coefficients a, b, and c for each month of the year, and Ta should be given in degrees Celsius. The corrected values for P are used to estimate monthly mean precipitation rate.\n\nBeginning in the early 1980s, the WMO no longer required PW to be recorded for clear-weather observations. Before then, in clear-weather episodes, the observer entered a code indicating there was no weather observed. When the observations in the 1980s were entered into the COADS interim product, the missing clear-weather observations were given the missing flag, just as truly missing PW observations were. Using such observations as they are recorded in COADS would eliminate most, if not all, clear-weather (rainless, snowless) reports. If few clear-weather reports are available, the result would be a wet bias in the 1980s mean precipitation rate. This effect would be particularly evident in climatologically clear areas, such as below the subtropical highs. Da Silva et al. (1994) discovered that there was indeed a sharp increase in the number of missing PW observations in COADS beginning in 1982. To circumvent this problem, da Silva et al. (1994) assumed that any observer making a cloud-cover observation will also make a PW observation, and vice versa. Therefore, when encountering a missing observation from 1982-and-later observations, cloudiness was checked. If cloudiness was missing, PW was assumed to be missing and was not included in the precipitation calculation. If a cloudiness observation was present, however, it was assumed that there was a PW observation and that the weather was clear. The observation was then used as a clear-weather observation in the precipitation-rate calculation. As a test, da Silva et al. (1994) checked PW and cloudiness observations prior to 1982. Cases in which a cloudiness observation was present but the PW observation was missing were very rare.\n\nThe precipitation fields obtained with the formulas above showed an unrealistic minimum in spring when compared with estimates from the National Meteorological Center and National Aeronautics and Space Administration Goddard (Schubert et al. 1993) reanalyses, as well as Arkin and Meisner's (1987) Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite precipitation index. This abrupt decrease of precipitation in spring is not present in the uncorrected PTucker, but is introduced, rather, by the correction factor (a + bTa + cT2a). To remove this spurious seasonal cycle in precipitation, da Silva et al. (1994) used the annual mean of Dorman and Bourke's (1978) correction factor in their precipitation calculations: the monthly mean correction was calculated from the 12 monthly long-term means of air temperature and was averaged to form the annual mean correction. This modification had little effect on the annual mean precipitation. Despite all the efforts, however, several problems with the values of precipitation in the Tropics remain. In this work, the possibility of correcting these problems is investigated.\n\nFlaws in UWM/COADS precipitation estimates\n\nThe idea of estimating precipitation using weather codes is appealing, but, in practice, many flaws are apparent. Weather codes in earlier years changed several times. According to Reed (1977), ship reports prior to 1955 are most seriously affected. A mix of coding practices probably exists in COADS observations before the mid-1950s.\n\nThe WMO codes for PW only allow certain type and intensity combinations of precipitation to be recorded. For example, moderate and heavy intensities receive the same PW code for several types of precipitation. There is no code for drizzle having a showery or strongly convective character (Petty 1995). Snow and rain are not differentiated when occurring in a thunderstorm without hail.\n\nThe codes for PW also ignore human biases associated with assigning precipitation intensities. Observers accustomed to the very high precipitation rates found in the Tropics may assign a moderate or light intensity to rain considered as heavy by an observer in the midlatitudes. Observers will also tend to miss precipitation occurring near, but not at, the ship in nighttime hours.\n\nTucker's (1961) formula for precipitation was calculated in the North Atlantic under conditions characteristic of the midlatitudes. Data that include the very high rain rates found in the Tropics were not used. As a result, precipitation rates over 11.32 mm (3 h)−1 cannot be obtained. The temperature correction of Dorman and Bourke (1978) was an attempt to compensate for this disability. This temperature correction, however, creates problems of its own. Not only is an unsupported spring minimum in precipitation introduced (as mentioned above), but the large corrections in the Tropics prevent the observation of precipitation rates that match Tucker's definition of light rain. Elliott and Reed (1978) also point out that a single correction for all rain rates implies that the intensities of light, moderate, and heavy rainfall have the same ratio in every region, which may not be physically justified.\n\nLast, the inadequate density of ship observations over the globe results in sampling errors in precipitation fields. These errors are more severe than those for wind speed or sea level pressure, because the weather code is the least commonly recorded parameter in a typical marine observation. Such low observation densities allow large areas of the global ocean to go completely unobserved in any one month and allow many other regions to be undersampled. The analysis method used by da Silva et al. (1994) attempts to interpolate precipitation values to any 1° × 1° boxes that are missing data and to use surrounding gridbox values to smooth out any noise that may exist. This method works well in regions of sufficient observation density. The method fails, however, in regions such as the southern oceans in which PW observations are few and far between. The analysis method can cause problems even in more densely sampled regions. Because of the narrow size of certain precipitation features (such as that in the ITCZ), the analysis can smooth out narrow features too much.\n\nFigure 1 shows directly measured precipitation on Mornington Island, Australia (16.6°S, 139.2°E), versus UWM/COADS-estimated precipitation amounts at the nearest grid point (16.5°S, 139.5°E) for 40 Januaries from 1949 through 1989 (the value for 1951 is missing). Direct measurements are provided by the global land dataset developed by Eischeid et al. (1991; see also Diaz et al. 1989). Note that the UWM/COADS data are a poor match for most precipitation values and completely fail to represent any precipitation higher than 300 mm. Another artifact of the analysis is the creation of negative precipitation values in the UWM/COADS data. This is caused by the analysis of anomalies for individual months instead of full-field values. To correct a serious spurious seasonal cycle in the original analysis, anomalies were computed and added to climatological means to produce full-field values (da Silva et al. 1994). Negative anomalies can influence nearby regions, causing the sum of analyzed climatological mean and anomaly to be negative in certain grid boxes. At higher latitudes it appears that UWM/COADS is more reliable because a better relation between actual and estimated precipitation is usually present. Similar comparisons at higher latitudes indicate that at least the monthly mean value is well estimated. In the Tropics this is not true.\n\nCan UWM/COADS tropical precipitation estimates be corrected?\n\nNext, I proceed with a method that in theory may provide a way to correct precipitation values in the Tropics.\n\nConsider a dynamical system such as the climate system. This system includes many variables that are related to each other. As such, in theory, any variable is a function of all other variables. Therefore, if measurements of a large number of climate variables are available, one can try to estimate precipitation values from those measurements. I thus proceed in the following way.\n\nLet us assume that n observations of p UWM/COADS variables are available, forming an n × p matrix 𝗫. Because I am using variances and covariances, all 𝗫s will be assumed to be centered values (i.e., deviations from their respective means). These p variables may be correlated. Principal component analysis provides a way to transform the p original correlated values into p uncorrelated or orthogonal values. Such a transformation can be written as 𝗭 = 𝗫𝗔, where 𝗭 is an n × p matrix of n values for each of p components and 𝗔 is a p × p matrix of coefficients defining the linear transformation. Note that often in the singular value decomposition problem 𝗭 is referred to as the scores matrix, where a column i is the scores for principal component i, and 𝗔 is the matrix of eigenvectors where column i is the eigenvector for principal component i. Because the original p-variate set of observations in 𝗫 contains correlations, it might be possible to characterize the variance of 𝗫 with q < p orthogonal components. Thus one may be able to construct 𝗭 so that each component zj (an n × 1 vector) explains the maximum amount of the variance of 𝗫 left unexplained by the first j − 1 components. In this way, it may be found that the first q components explain most of the system variance and that p − q components explain little of the system variance. One thus can retain q principal components that account for most of the system variance. Then, using multiple regression models, one can regress precipitation (dependent variable) to these q principal components (which will form the q independent variables) (Haan 1977).\n\nIn accord with this approach, if for some grid point there are n observations of p UWM/COADS variables, the p variables are first reduced to q principal components. Then, assuming that on a near atoll or island n observations of measured precipitation exist, a model of the form\n\nRa(2)\n\nis sought, where R is an n × 1 vector whose elements are the n observations of the centered dependent variable, 𝗭* is an n × q matrix whose elements z*ij represent the ith value of the jth principal component, and a is an n × 1 vector containing the regression coefficients estimated from\n\nâ−1R(3)\n\nOnce the regression model is obtained, it can be used to obtain estimated precipitation values at a given grid point.\n\nFigure 2 shows an example of the results of the above-described process. It shows model-predicted versus measured monthly precipitation at Mornington for all Januaries in the period 1949–89. Because the value for 1951 is missing, n = 40. Eighteen UWM/COADS variables are considered here (p = 18). These variables are listed in Table 2. Note that the UWM/COADS data contain other variables as well. The choice of these 18 variables was based on their relevance to precipitation processes. Applying the principal component analysis described above, it is found that the six first principal components (PCs) explain 92% of the system's total variance. Note that there are many objective methods to assess the number of significant PCs other than to simply consider the percentage of variance explained as a cutoff point. The reason for doing this is to keep it simple while requiring a high percentage of the variance to be explained. By regressing the measured precipitation with the first six PCs, the regression equation that provided the estimated precipitation values was derived. The standard error is about 100 mm. The coefficient of determination r2 of this regression was equal to 0.68, which means that the procedure outlined above can explain 68% of the variance in monthly precipitation.\n\nThe precipitation estimates corrected by this procedure are based on the same dataset as that used to perform the principal component analysis and to determine the regression coefficients. To address the issue of the robustness of the multivariate models, I experimented with the available data. More specific, instead of using all 40 values to derive the coefficients, I used the first 30 values and then used the new model to estimate precipitation in the last 10 values. By comparing those estimated 10 values from the two models, it is found that these estimates are comparable to those estimated by the procedure displayed in Fig. 2. This result indicates that some information on precipitation exists in the 18 predictors (in other words, it is not due to overfitting the data) and will be further demonstrated later.\n\nNote that, by deriving models for individual months, the issue of the annual cycle is sidestepped. The issue of seasonality is serious if one tries to derive a model that applies to any month. The annual cycle was removed and the analysis was repeated with data from all months, but it was found that nonlinearities in the variation of precipitation from month to month are not handled very well by linear models. As such, estimating a model for each month is the approach most likely to succeed. This method was then applied to all grid points in the Tropics (30°S–30°N) for which a nearby station within a box of 1° × 1° centered at the grid point with measured precipitation exists (Diaz et al. 1989). For the grid point to qualify, its corresponding station must have n ≥ 39. It was found that 186 grid points scattered in the above latitude belt satisfy the above conditions.\n\nFigure 3 shows for these 186 grid points the correlation between measured and estimated precipitation in January using the above approach. For each grid point, the values of the 18 variables in all the available years are used and all PCs are calculated. Then the first six PCs are considered (q = 6) and the coefficients a are derived by regressing these six PCs to measured precipitation on the nearby station. The decision to adopt a six-PC threshold for all points is based on the fact that in 178 out of 186 grid points (95%) the first six PCs explain at least 80% of the variance. Once the regression model is developed, it can be used to produce precipitation estimates on the grid point in question. It is observed that on average the correlation between actual and estimated precipitation is about 0.5. Figure 4 shows the same result, but when the actual precipitation values are randomized (shuffled) and the predictors are not. This procedure addresses the significance of a correlation between estimated values of precipitation based on the 18 variables and the actual precipitation. In this case, the average correlation is about 0.35. This indicates that correlations greater than 0.35 are significant correlations. Thus, on average, it is likely that the system of p UWM/COADS variables contains some information on precipitation. If it did not, then there would have been no significant differences between Figs. 3 and 4. Similar results are obtained for the other months. The question thus arises as to whether this information is enough to correct UWM/COADS precipitation.\n\nIt is well known that precipitation varies significantly in space. Thus, extrapolating measured precipitation at a number of sites on a grid may not result in accurate precipitation fields. The idea behind using an approach such as the one described here is that, if the derived regression coefficients are less variable in space than precipitation itself, it could be possible to derive a “global” regression model that can be applied to all grid points in the Tropics. In such a case, some improvement in UWM/COADS precipitation may be feasible. Such a model could be defined at each grid point having as variables the first six PCs resulting from 𝗫 at that point and as coefficients the mean regression coefficients from the 186 grid points (i.e., agq = 1/186 Σ186k=1 akq), where g stands for global. In a strict sense, this is not a global model, because the PCs vary with grid point. It is global only with regard to coefficients. Figure 5 is similar to Fig. 3 but for the case in which such a global model is applied to all 186 grid points and, for reasons explained below, to the next two closest grid points to each station (i.e., 558 grid points in all). As such, the first three values in Fig. 5 correspond to the nearest three grid points of station 1, the next three values to the nearest three grid points of station 2, and so on. Now we see that the correlation coefficient fluctuates mostly between ±0.35 and that the average correlation is about 0. Furthermore, it is observed that for any given station the correlation obtained from the three nearest grid points can vary significantly even though these points may be very close to each other. These results are expected only when dependent and independent variables are random. This simply means that a global model will result in a meaningless precipitation field. The reason for the failure of a global model is shown in Fig. 6, in which we plotted the difference between a1 at any two grid points against their distance. This plot indicates that, regardless of the distance, the variation of a1 not only is similar but is also great. This is a characteristic of highly noncoherent fields. In this case, the mean value ag1 carries no significance. Such variations are observed for all six coefficients. Thus, considering averages or extrapolating six regression coefficients that are highly variable in space onto a grid will not be more advantageous than simply extrapolating measured precipitation. It follows that, although local models do provide some improvements, a global model will not produce meaningful precipitation fields from other UWM/COADS variables.\n\nLast, I point out that when this experiment was repeated with the dependent variable being any one of the 18 variables in 𝗫 (i.e., assuming that one needs to correct any variable by estimating its values from the remaining 17 variables) it was found that in almost all cases global models were more successful than in the case of precipitation. In fact, in some cases [for example, for surface air temperature (Fig. 7)] global models resulted in fairly good overall correlations between actual and estimated values. This result indicates that the mathematical approach used here (which is a linear method), although very common in such problems, may be limited when handling variables such as precipitation. Nonlinear approaches (such as neural networks) may be able to handle precipitation better, but the amount of data required for such analysis is not currently available."
