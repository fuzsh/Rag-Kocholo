        "text": "This article is a geographical overview of the Avatar World. For the map, see Map of the World of Avatar.\n\nThe world is divided into multiple landmasses, islands, and seas with a unique physical geography, landmarks, climates, and demography. For most of its history, the world was divided into a multitude of states and cultures which coalesced into four independent nations at some point after 3,829 BG:[1] the Air Nomads, the Water Tribe, the Earth Kingdom, and the Fire Nation.\n\nThe four nations were influenced by their corresponding element and accordingly shaped their environment. The Air Nomads had four temples located in the north, south, east, and west of the Earth. There are two main Water Tribes, situated north and south of the Earth Kingdom, the most expansive and populated state in the world. The Fire Nation is located in the west of the world and is an archipelago of volcanic islands. Each nation has a predominant season, and geography has a great influence on the customs and culture of each country. Nevertheless, smaller cultures and quasi-independent polities, as well as groups of mixed ethnicity, continued to active during this period.\n\nAs part of the Harmony Restoration Movement from 100 AG, which sought to restore balance to the world after one hundred years of war, a fifth territory known as the United Republic of Nations was founded as a place where inhabitants of all nations could mingle freely. Furthermore, the Earth Kingdom began to disband itself into smaller states after 174 AG.\n\nLocations[]\n\nAir Nomads[]\n\nThe Air Nomads were wanderers by definition but had four air temples at various locations across the world, where novices were raised and trained. Certain temples were also the sites of specific events and festivals on the Air Nomad calendar, and airbenders from across the world would congregate there at designated times to celebrate.\n\nEastern Air Temple[]\n\nMain article: Eastern Air Temple\n\nThe Eastern Air Temple was one of the two temples exclusively housing female airbenders. Like the other temples, its population was completely exterminated during the Air Nomad Genocide. Guru Pathik resided here for a considerable amount of time, as he waited years for Aang to come so he could teach the Avatar how to properly control the Avatar State.[2] Following the Hundred Year War, the Eastern Air Temple became home to Air Acolytes, and later housed some of the new airbenders after Harmonic Convergence.[3][4]\n\nNorthern Air Temple[]\n\nMain article: Northern Air Temple\n\nThe Northern Air Temple is a temple that hosted only male monks. It is located in the upper reaches of the northern Earth Kingdom, built upon a snow-capped mountain. This temple was also a victim of the Air Nomad Genocide, along with all the other air temples. By 100 AG, it had become renowned for its arbitrary colonization by Earth Kingdom refugees, who were led by the mechanist. Up to that point, the area had undergone rapid industrialization.[5] The Northern Air Temple was restored after the war and was inhabited by Air Acolytes, and briefly trained new airbenders after Harmonic Convergence. However, it was destroyed by Ghazan's lavabending attack when the Red Lotus held the new airbenders hostage in their quest to end the Avatar Cycle.[6]\n\nSouthern Air Temple[]\n\nMain article: Southern Air Temple\n\nThe Southern Air Temple was one of the four sanctuaries owned by the Air Nomads. It is the one located closest to the Southern Water Tribe and exclusively housed male airbenders. This region is notable for being the childhood home of Avatar Aang,[7] and it was also the place where Avatar Roku learned airbending. Like the other temples, it was restored by Air Acolytes after the war, and is also home to some of the Air Nation's new airbenders.[8][4]\n\nWestern Air Temple[]\n\nMain article: Western Air Temple\n\nThe Western Air Temple was a counterpart of the Eastern Air Temple, maintaining only female airbenders. It is situated in an island mountain range due north of the Fire Nation. Unlike the other air temples, this one consists of multiple small structures and portions versus merely a single large one. It too was a victim of the Air Nomad Genocide, which decimated all of its population. The temple is also notable in that, contrary to the other three temples, it is situated underneath the edge of a cliff, as opposed to a mountaintop. The spires seem as though they were constructed upside-down, and because of that, the temple is generally difficult to locate for passers-by.[9] Like the other temples, it was restored by Air Acolytes after the war, and is also home to some of the Air Nation's new airbenders.[4]\n\nWater Tribe[]\n\nFoggy Swamp[]\n\nMain article: Foggy Swamp\n\nThough an outlying expanse of the tribe, this vast and mysterious wetland occupies a considerable portion of the southwestern Earth Kingdom. It provides an ideal residence for the Foggy Swamp Tribe, who are descended from immigrants of the Southern Water Tribe. The Swamp has an extensive array of fauna and flora, the latter of which are actually just a series of roots connected to one central tree, the towering banyan grove.[10]\n\nNorthern Water Tribe[]\n\nMain article: Northern Water Tribe\n\nThe Northern Water Tribe is the largest division of its nation and is located on an island situated near the North Pole. The capital city, Agna Qel'a, prospers in its isolation.[11] No attack from the Fire Nation on the city during the Hundred Year War ever ended in a loss for the tribe, including the tumultuous Siege of the North.[12] After the fall of Ba Sing Se, the Northern Water Tribe boasted the only major city in the world to not be under Fire Nation jurisdiction.\n\nSouthern Water Tribe[]\n\nMain article: Southern Water Tribe\n\nThe Southern Water Tribe is a minor division of the Water Tribe. Its people are scattered in tiny villages and settlements located on an island by the South Pole.[13] Unlike its thriving sister tribe, the people of the Southern Water Tribe were teetering on the edge of extinction during the Hundred Year War due to Fire Nation raids.[14] However, following the Siege of the North, several volunteers traveled from the Northern Water Tribe to help rebuild their sister tribe.[12] Through their efforts, the South underwent a major expansion, and by 171 AG, it had a large harbor city as its capital, along with numerous other smaller cities and villages scattered around the South Pole region.[15]\n\nEarth Kingdom[]\n\nThe Earth Kingdom is by far the largest of the original Four Nations, and its geography varies widely from region to region. While there is often not a \"hard-and-fast\" division between these regions, certain areas are marked by geographic features that may not be common elsewhere.\n\nCentral regions[]\n\nFull Moon Bay[]\n\nMain article: Full Moon Bay\n\nFull Moon Bay is a secluded cove in East Lake, located just south of Ba Sing Se. It is the location of a hidden ferry station that refugees from all over the southern portion of the Earth Kingdom come to on their way to Ba Sing Se.[16]\n\nGreat Divide[]\n\nMain article: Great Divide\n\nThe Great Divide is the largest canyon in the world. It is located in the rocky regions of the central Earth Kingdom.[17]\n\nSi Wong Desert[]\n\nMain article: Si Wong Desert\n\nThe Si Wong Desert is the largest desert in the world. It is almost impossible to successfully navigate. It is sparsely inhabited by Si Wong tribes.[18]\n\nNortheastern regions[]\n\nBa Sing Se[]\n\nMain article: Ba Sing Se\n\nBa Sing Se is the monolithic capital of the Earth Kingdom, encompassing nearly the entire northeast corner of the country. It was the last great Earth Kingdom stronghold after the fall of Omashu.[19] Ba Sing Se means \"impenetrable city\", an honorary reference to its two insurmountable walls, the gates of which have no hinges and can therefore not be opened in any way aside from the use of earthbending.[20]\n\nSerpent's Pass[]\n\nMain article: Serpent's Pass\n\nThe Serpent's Pass is a narrow strip of land between the East and West Lakes that links the southern and northern halves of the Earth Kingdom. It is one of the very few direct paths to the capital, Ba Sing Se. The pathway is named after the serpent which guards the point at which the East and West Lakes meet. Here, the Serpent's Pass dips below the lakes for a limited distance. These adversities make the Serpent's Pass a typically avoided entryway into Ba Sing Se, and most refugees prefer to go by ferry instead.[16]\n\nNorthwestern regions[]\n\nMerchant town[]\n\nMain article: Merchant town\n\nThe merchant town is a minor trading settlement located high in the mountains of the northwestern Earth Kingdom. Historically, this region was the site of numerous airbender murders, as survivors of the genocide were tricked by firebenders into coming to this location when they heard rumors of its mysterious possession of Air Nomad relics. Such airbenders were consequently killed in a decisive ambush.[21]\n\nSouthern regions[]\n\nChin Village[]\n\nMain article: Chin Village\n\nChin Village is a small town located on the cliffs of the Earth Kingdom's southwestern coast. It is named for Chin the Great, a warlord and conqueror who nearly conquered the Earth Kingdom. It plays host to the unique \"Avatar Day\" festival, a celebration that used to be a celebration in hate of the Avatar but is now held in honor of the Avatar.[22]\n\nGaoling[]\n\nMain article: Gaoling\n\nGaoling is a large town located within a mountain range in the southern Earth Kingdom. It is home to both the wealthy Beifong family and the Earth Rumble tournaments. An old, well-established city, Gaoling has a spectrum of people residing in it, ranging from the very rich to the very poor. Because it was not in a particularly strategic location, the town was left untouched by the Hundred Year War. This is evidenced by the attitude of many of its residents.[23]\n\nKyoshi Island[]\n\nMain article: Kyoshi Island\n\nKyoshi Island is a small island off the southern coast of the Earth Kingdom, dotted with many small villages. It is famous as the birthplace of Avatar Kyoshi, and as the home of the elite Kyoshi Warriors.[24] The island was created when Chin the Conqueror threatened to invade and conquer the former peninsula. Avatar Kyoshi separated Yokoya Peninsula from the Earth Kingdom mainland to keep her people safe from future threats.[22]\n\nOmashu[]\n\nMain article: Omashu\n\nOmashu is the second largest city in the Earth Kingdom and the capital of one of its provinces.[25] Only Ba Sing Se, the titanic capital of the Earth Kingdom, is larger. It was one of the last great strongholds of the Earth Kingdom before its fall in the months before the end of the Hundred Year War, and a supplier of men and weaponry. Previously ruled by King Bumi, Omashu was taken over by the Fire Nation and renamed New Ozai.[19] During the Day of Black Sun, King Bumi single-handedly liberated Omashu, and all the powerless firebenders abandoned the city.\n\nPlains village[]\n\nMain article: Plains village\n\nThe plains village is located in the arid grasslands of the southern Earth Kingdom, to the west of the Si Wong Desert. It was not the most ideal place to live in and was home to several suspicious characters, including Gow, who, along with his gang of thugs, passed off as Earth Kingdom soldiers in order to force the citizens to yield to their will. They often forcefully enlisted unwilling citizens into the Earth Kingdom Army and stole from those they considered weak, and as such, the town was often forced to live in fear of this band. The citizens of the village seemed to harbor a severe hatred for the Fire Nation, and several of its citizens left to fight in the Hundred Year War.\n\nThe Lee Family Pig Farm is located outside of this village and was home to a young boy named Lee who lived with his parents.[26]\n\nZaofu[]\n\nMain article: Zaofu\n\nZaofu is an autonomous city-state, located in the southwestern part of the Earth Kingdom, and the home of the Metal Clan. Founded by Suyin Beifong, the Clan's matriarch, Zaofu is constructed entirely out of metal and is regarded by some as the safest city in the world. It was annexed by the Earth Empire temporarily in 174 AG,[27] but power over the city was returned to Suyin following Kuvira's surrender.[28]\n\nWestern regions[]\n\nCave of Two Lovers[]\n\nMain article: Cave of Two Lovers\n\nLocated near the city of Omashu in the Earth Kingdom, the Cave of Two Lovers is a secret tunnel that passes through a section of the Kolau Mountain Range. The tunnel is actually a giant underground labyrinth full of dangerous animals including wolfbats and badgermoles.[29]\n\nFarming village[]\n\nMain article: Farming village\n\nThis farming village is a small village located in the western Earth Kingdom. Zuko and Iroh traveled to the village so Iroh could receive treatment for a rash caused by the white jade plant.[29]\n\nGaipan[]\n\nMain article: Gaipan\n\nGaipan is a small village located in the central Earth Kingdom. After being overtaken by the Fire Nation, it was evacuated shortly before being destroyed by a catastrophic flood.[30]\n\nMining village[]\n\nMain article: Mining village\n\nThe mining village is a medium-sized village located in the Earth Kingdom. It is located on the northwestern coast of the Earth Kingdom, and its inhabitants make a living by mining coal in several nearby mines.[31]\n\nRiver village[]\n\nMain article: River village\n\nThe river village is located in the western Earth Kingdom, situated between the forks of a large river. It serves as a regional trading hub and ideal location for merchants to sell their wares.[10]\n\nFire Nation[]\n\nMain article: Fire Islands\n\nBoiling Rock[]\n\nMain article: Boiling Rock\n\nThe Boiling Rock is a massive Fire Nation prison. Its name is derived from the fact that the prison is on an island in the middle of a boiling lake on a volcanic island. The Boiling Rock is where the most dangerous prisoners in the Fire Nation are held, domestic and foreign alike.[32]\n\nEmber Island[]\n\nMain article: Ember Island\n\nEmber Island is a small resort located in the outer islands of the Fire Nation. It is home to many luxurious resorts and vacation homes for the wealthy and powerful. The beaches are among the most popular in the country and host many popular kuai ball games.[33]\n\nFire Fountain City[]\n\nMain article: Fire Fountain City\n\nFire Fountain City is a large, industrial city located in the Fire Nation. It is named for the large, fire-breathing statue of Fire Lord Ozai in its center. It is located on one of the many islands in the eastern half of the Fire Nation.[34]\n\nFire Nation Capital[]\n\nMain article: Fire Nation Capital\n\nThe Fire Nation Capital is the seat of the government for the Fire Nation.

These attributes illustrate the qualities of the nations.\n\nAir Nomads[]\n\nThe Air Nomad's dominant season was autumn.[110] Although the country was geographically and topographically diverse, the climate varied little from one temple to another. Snow falls in the Southern and Northern temples during autumn and winter.\n\nWater Tribe[]\n\nThe Water Tribe's dominant season is winter,[110] though the Northern and Southern tribes regularly experience snowfall year-round. Other forms of precipitation are rare due to the below-freezing temperatures, and thus the air is usually lacking in humidity. The average yearly temperature in the Southern Water Tribe is negative 49 degrees.[111]\n\nEarth Kingdom[]\n\nThe Earth Kingdom's dominant season is spring.[110] The average temperatures across different portions of the Earth Kingdom vary greatly because of its vast size. Some areas, such as the Foggy Swamp, are humid and rainy while other areas, such as the Si Wong Desert and Great Divide, are quite arid. Omashu and Ba Sing Se are more temperate. There are colder areas in the Earth Kingdom, such as the northern edge,[112] while the coldest region is in and around Kyoshi Island, where the climate conditions are often subpolar.\n\nFire Nation[]\n\nThe Fire Nation's dominant season is summer.[110] The climate in the Fire Nation varies, though most regions have a tropical or arid subtropical climate, and many areas experience high average temperatures year-round. Even though rainfall is sporadic, the Fire Nation boasts a wide variety of exotic fauna and flora, all due to its humid climate.\n\nDemography[]\n\nAir Nomads[]\n\nAfter the Air Nomad Genocide resulted in the near complete extinction of the Air Nomads and the fauna that lived in the air temples with them, the population of the Air Nomads was small compared to the other nations, even the Water Tribes. The sole known survivor of the massacre was Aang, the Avatar. Only the younger of Aang's two sons, Tenzin, is an airbender and has, in turn, fathered three more airbenders. However, after the Harmonic Convergence of 171 AG, some nonbenders in the Earth Kingdom, United Republic, Fire Nation, and Water Tribes gained the ability to airbend, bringing the art back from the brink of extinction.[113]\n\nWater Tribes[]\n\nThe population of the Water Tribes is relatively small and is the third most populous nation. Due to the Hundred Year War, the Southern Water Tribe was nearly driven to the brink of extinction through a series of raids,[14] hence the Northern Water Tribe is the most populous division in the nation.\n\nEarth Kingdom[]\n\nThe Earth Kingdom is the most populous nation in the world. Ba Sing Se, its capital, is one of the largest and most advanced cities on Earth. Due to the fact that the Earth Kingdom has the largest expanse of territory, it is an ethnically diverse country, with wide variance in customs between different provinces and tribes. The Earth Kingdom has never suffered a heavy loss of life or any sort of extinction in civilization despite its constant state of warfare.\n\nFire Nation[]\n\nThe Fire Nation is the second largest nation in the world in terms of population and area. The nation has suffered some loss of life because of the Hundred Year War, but not as much as the other nations, who have been victims of more devastating invasions and genocides. The population of the Fire Nation is mostly concentrated in urban centers, though smaller settlements, villages, and towns dot the islands as well.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nEach nation in the world of Avatar bears similarities to locations in our own world:\n\nThe Fire Nation geography is based on Iceland[114][115][116] while its cultures are analogous to ancient China and Japan, especially the Qin and Han dynasties.\n\nThe Earth Kingdom is expansive, agrarian, and diverse, much like China, with architecture and clothing comparable to that of later Chinese dynasties, notably the Ming and Qing dynasties. The sandbenders share more similarities with Uyghurs and outer Mongolians, while the Kyoshi Warriors adopt customs similar to the Japanese.\n\nAir Nomad clothes and customs are similar to Tibetans and Central Asians.\n\nThe Water Tribes are similar to the Inuits and Kipchak tribes, though the canal system in the Northern Water Tribe capital, Agna Qel'a, was inspired by the canals found in Italy.[117]\n\nAlthough there are four air temples, there are only three Air Nomad archipelagos, as the Northern Air Temple is located on the northern tip of the Earth Kingdom mainland.\n\nDespite seasons/eclipses happening world-over, the world of Avatar is round.[118][119]"
