We have no information as to whether it is valid and what flights it receives or sends.\n\nDe Haan: weather forecast\n\nThe weather forecast is shown in local time in De Haan\n\nTODAY\n\n11:00\n\n19.3°C\n\n28km/h\n\nfeels like 19.0°C, Clear (clear sky)\n\nhumidity: 63%, clouds: 0%\n\n14:00\n\n23.2°C\n\n24km/h\n\nfeels like 23.0°C, Clear (clear sky)\n\nhumidity: 57%, clouds: 6%\n\n17:00\n\n24.6°C\n\n22km/h\n\nfeels like 24.6°C, Clouds (overcast clouds: 85-100%)\n\nhumidity: 56%, clouds: 100%\n\n20:00\n\n21.8°C\n\n21km/h\n\nfeels like 21.9°C, Clouds (overcast clouds: 85-100%)\n\nhumidity: 69%, clouds: 85%\n\n23:00\n\n19.9°C\n\n22km/h\n\nfeels like 19.9°C, Clouds (overcast clouds: 85-100%)\n\nhumidity: 75%, clouds: 85%\n\nSEPTEMBER 1\n\n02:00\n\n17.2°C\n\n16km/h\n\nfeels like 17.3°C, Rain (light rain)\n\nhumidity: 90%, clouds: 92%\n\n05:00\n\n16.9°C\n\n16km/h\n\nfeels like 17.1°C, Rain (light rain)\n\nhumidity: 93%, clouds: 99%\n\n08:00\n\n17.5°C\n\n18km/h\n\nfeels like 17.7°C, Rain (light rain)\n\nhumidity: 92%, clouds: 98%\n\n11:00\n\n23.1°C\n\n20km/h\n\nfeels like 23.3°C, Clouds (broken clouds: 51-84%)\n\nhumidity: 72%, clouds: 77%\n\n14:00\n\n29.6°C\n\n19km/h\n\nfeels like 30.7°C, Clouds (broken clouds: 51-84%)\n\nhumidity: 51%, clouds: 57%\n\n17:00\n\n31.7°C\n\n18km/h\n\nfeels like 32.6°C, Clear (clear sky)\n\nhumidity: 44%, clouds: 7%\n\n20:00\n\n27.0°C\n\n12km/h\n\nfeels like 28.2°C, Clear (clear sky)\n\nhumidity: 63%, clouds: 9%\n\n23:00\n\n23.3°C\n\n12km/h\n\nfeels like 23.4°C, Clear (clear sky)\n\nhumidity: 64%, clouds: 6%\n\nSEPTEMBER 2\n\n02:00\n\n19.8°C\n\n9km/h\n\nfeels like 20.1°C, Clouds (few clouds: 11-25%)\n\nhumidity: 90%, clouds: 24%\n\n05:00\n\n18.6°C\n\n11km/h\n\nfeels like 19.0°C, Clouds (broken clouds: 51-84%)\n\nhumidity: 97%, clouds: 51%\n\n08:00\n\n17.9°C\n\n10km/h\n\nfeels like 18.3°C, Clouds (scattered clouds: 25-50%)\n\nhumidity: 96%, clouds: 31%\n\n11:00\n\n23.5°C\n\n15km/h\n\nfeels like 23.6°C, Clear (clear sky)\n\nhumidity: 66%, clouds: 7%\n\n14:00\n\n26.0°C\n\n16km/h\n\nfeels like 26.0°C, Clouds (few clouds: 11-25%)\n\nhumidity: 57%, clouds: 13%\n\n17:00\n\n23.2°C\n\n19km/h\n\nfeels like 23.4°C, Clouds (broken clouds: 51-84%)\n\nhumidity: 68%, clouds: 77%\n\n20:00\n\n19.8°C\n\n13km/h\n\nfeels like 19.9°C, Clouds (broken clouds: 51-84%)\n\nhumidity: 82%, clouds: 83%\n\n23:00\n\n19.0°C\n\n14km/h\n\nfeels like 19.0°C, Clouds (overcast clouds: 85-100%)\n\nhumidity: 81%, clouds: 100%\n\nSEPTEMBER 3\n\n02:00\n\n18.1°C\n\n8km/h\n\nfeels like 18.2°C, Clouds (overcast clouds: 85-100%)\n\nhumidity: 88%, clouds: 100%\n\n05:00\n\n17.0°C\n\n8km/h\n\nfeels like 17.1°C, Clouds (overcast clouds: 85-100%)\n\nhumidity: 92%, clouds: 100%\n\n08:00\n\n16.8°C\n\n7km/h\n\nfeels like 16.9°C, Clouds (overcast clouds: 85-100%)\n\nhumidity: 91%, clouds: 100%\n\n11:00\n\n21.3°C\n\n11km/h\n\nfeels like 21.4°C, Clouds (overcast clouds: 85-100%)\n\nhumidity: 71%, clouds: 86%\n\n14:00\n\n23.4°C\n\n14km/h\n\nfeels like 23.4°C, Clouds (overcast clouds: 85-100%)\n\nhumidity: 61%, clouds: 89%\n\n17:00\n\n22.0°C\n\n15km/h\n\nfeels like 22.1°C, Clouds (overcast clouds: 85-100%)\n\nhumidity: 70%, clouds: 100%\n\n20:00\n\n19.3°C\n\n12km/h\n\nfeels like 19.5°C, Clouds (overcast clouds: 85-100%)\n\nhumidity: 88%, clouds: 100%\n\n23:00\n\n18.0°C\n\n10km/h\n\nfeels like 18.4°C, Clouds (overcast clouds: 85-100%)\n\nhumidity: 96%, clouds: 100%\n\nSEPTEMBER 4\n\n02:00\n\n17.3°C\n\n12km/h\n\nfeels like 17.6°C, Clouds (overcast clouds: 85-100%)\n\nhumidity: 96%, clouds: 100%\n\n05:00\n\n16.8°C\n\n12km/h\n\nfeels like 16.9°C, Clouds (overcast clouds: 85-100%)\n\nhumidity: 92%, clouds: 100%\n\n08:00\n\n17.3°C\n\n12km/h\n\nfeels like 17.3°C, Clouds (overcast clouds: 85-100%)\n\nhumidity: 85%, clouds: 100%\n\n11:00\n\n20.3°C\n\n16km/h\n\nfeels like 20.3°C, Clouds (overcast clouds: 85-100%)\n\nhumidity: 70%, clouds: 99%\n\n14:00\n\n21.7°C\n\n20km/h\n\nfeels like 21.6°C, Clouds (overcast clouds: 85-100%)\n\nhumidity: 63%, clouds: 98%\n\n17:00\n\n20.5°C\n\n19km/h\n\nfeels like 20.3°C, Clouds (scattered clouds: 25-50%)\n\nhumidity: 62%, clouds: 30%\n\n20:00\n\n17.1°C\n\n16km/h\n\nfeels like 16.8°C, Clouds (few clouds: 11-25%)\n\nhumidity: 75%, clouds: 17%\n\n23:00\n\n15.3°C\n\n16km/h\n\nfeels like 15.0°C, Clear (clear sky)\n\nhumidity: 82%, clouds: 0%\n\nSEPTEMBER 5\n\n02:00\n\n14.1°C\n\n11km/h\n\nfeels like 13.8°C, Clear (clear sky)\n\nhumidity: 88%, clouds: 0%\n\nMariakerke-Bad, Belgium | © Norbert Callebaut\n\nFind out the temperature of sea water in more than 12000 cities and resorts around the world. Water surface temperature values are available in real time. There is a forecast of water temperature changes for the next few days, as well as historical data of sea surface temperature are available for all days of the last years.\n\nWe use data from various sources, including National Centers for Environmental Information (NOAA), meteorological services of different countries, data received from more than a thousand buoys around the world, satellite systems for scanning the surface of the oceans and seas.\n\nAll supported languages:"
