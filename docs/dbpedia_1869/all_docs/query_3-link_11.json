        "text": "The St. Joseph Hospital Haan has a long history of providing top-class medical services and tender care for patients in accordance with Catholic principles. The priority clinical focuses include cardiology, pulmonology, gastroenterology, oncology, endocrinology, general and abdominal surgery, endocrine surgery, hernia repair surgery, orthopedics and traumatology, vascular surgery and joint replacement surgery. The outstanding level of medical services provided at the hospital is confirmed by the DIN EN ISO 9001:2015 quality certificate. More than 8,500 inpatients and about 11,000 outpatients are treated here annually. The hospital regularly demonstrates good treatment success rates, and therefore it is deservedly considered one of the best in the region.\n\nThe hospital has special competence in arthroplasty and foot surgery. According to the prestigious Focus magazine, the direction of diabetology is certified by the German Diabetes Society, and is also ranked among the best specialized departments in Germany.\n\nThe medical facility has modern equipment, which allows the doctors to carry out high-precision diagnostics and effective treatment of even extremely complex pathologies. The operating rooms are adapted for low traumatic endoscopic and laparoscopic interventions, so the number of classic open surgical interventions is negligible.\n\nThe best German doctors with vast clinical experience work at the hospital for the benefit of their patients. The healthcare facility has about 300 employees, for whom the patient and his or her individual needs and wishes always come first.\n\nPhoto: (с) depositphotos"
