        "text": "Inter-comparisons of the V8 Results for SBUV instruments (Nimbus-7, NOAA-9, -11, and -16): Time, Altitude and Latitude dependency\n\nWeekly zonal mean data sets created for 5-degree latitude intervals are used to make time series of the ratios of the retrieved layer ozone to the a priori layer ozone. The figure below shows the ratio time series at four selected altitudes (21 km, 30 km, 37 km, and 50 km) for the equatorial latitude zone. The different instruments are distinguished by colors (Red: Nimbus-7, Black: NOAA-9, Green: NOAA-11, and Blue: NOAA-16). The midpoint pressures of the V8 atmospheric layers are converted to a logarithm-scale standard altitude in kilometers by using a scale height of 7 km. The V8 a priori has an annual cycle and annual mean that vary with altitude (in approximately 5-km layers) and latitude (10-degree bands), but has no inter-annual or long-term variability. Therefore, these ratio plots show both V8 algorithm retrieval performance as well as possible instrument problems.\n\n[Click on any of the figures in this document to see a full-sized version.]\n\nEquator Ratio (Retrieved / A Priori) Time Series\n\nAt the Equator, a Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) can be seen in the lower layers, and volcanic effects in 1982 and 1991 can be seen in the 30 km layer. In general, most of instruments compare well during the overlapped time periods over all the latitudes -- within � 8 % except for early years of NOAA-9 (pre-1992 data are not shown on these plots, but are included on the DVD) due to the unresolved instrument performance issues. The agreement among instruments has latitude- and altitude-dependencies, particularly in the southern hemisphere.\n\nThe APPENDIX contains similar plots for other latitudes and contour plots of the offsets in the results for pairs of instruments during their overlap periods. The contour plots show the differences as a function of altitude and latitude.\n\nProfile Quality Checking : the Percent Occurrence of Good Profiles\n\nThe figure below shows the percentage of profiles with profile error codes of 0 (good retrieval) or 1 (solar zenith angle greater than 84 degrees) for each day. The significant decrease in Nimbus-7 occurs during the non-synchronization period. The decreases in NOAA-9 and NOAA-11 are due to grating drive problems, and all of the NOAA-11 1995 data are at high solar zenith angles.\n\nProfile Ozone QC Flagging Plot\n\nV8 SBUV Profile Total Ozone Comparison with Dobson Stations in the Northern Hemisphere\n\nThe profile total ozone values are more reliable with fewer wavelength-dependent errors than conventional TOMS-like total ozone products. The matched-up V8 SBUV profile total ozone data are averaged on a weekly basis and compared with ground-based Dobson total ozone measurements from 40 stations in the northern hemisphere. The data smoothed with 15-point running averages are shown as solid lines for each instrument. The V8 SBUV profile total ozone is up to 2 % (~ 6 D.U) higher than Dobson total ozone, but has no significant long-term trends.\n\nV8 SBUV Profile - Dobson Total Ozone\n\nSeasonal Variations of Layer Ozone over Lauder, New Zealand\n\nThe figure below shows seasonal variations for the NOAA-11 SBUV/2 data over Lauder, New Zealand (45oS, 170oE) and corresponding measurements from a ground-based microwave instrument at four altitudes. All available matched-up samples (n=872) for the NOAA-11 time period are used to make these plots. Thick red lines are microwave data smoothed with 7-point running averages. Blue lines are V8 SBUV data, also smoothed with 7-point running averages. Dynamic transport from ozone rich air in the tropics builds up the maximum ozone in late winter and early spring in the lower stratosphere at 24 km. A typical annual cycle (maximum in summer and minimum in winter) is shown in the middle stratosphere at 34 km. In the upper stratosphere above 43 km, a winter (June, July, August) ozone maximum is dominant due to the reduced ozone destruction rate. The V8 SBUV data agree well with the microwave data in terms of both offset and seasonal cycle variation. This result is consistent with SAGE II, LIDAR, and ozonesonde comparison results presented in Brinksma et al. [2002].\n\nSeasonal variations of layer ozone at four altitudes\n\nTime Series of Microwave to V8 SBUV Layer Ozone over Mauna Loa\n\nThe figure below shows the time series analysis of the ratio of microwave to V8 SBUV layer ozone over Mauna Loa (20oN, 156oW). The three solid lines are the linear regression fits for the time periods of NOAA-9 (Jul. 1995 to Jul. 1997), NOAA-11 (Jul. 1997 to March 2001), and NOAA-16 (Oct. 2000 to Nov. 2002), respectively, at four altitudes. Mauna Loa is a good site to do intercomparisons because it is not only the primary Network for the Detection of Stratospheric Change (NDSC) station for the tropics and subtropics, but also has low ozone variability that minimizes the uncertainty caused by differences in the same air volumes measured by different instrument [McPeters et al., 1999]. This plot does not show any significant trend for this short-term period (7 1/2 years), and also demonstrates a good agreement between SBUV instruments in the overlaps except in NOAA-9 time period coincidences at 37 km. Nevertheless, the linear regression fits have no significant slope larger than the standard deviation (numbers not shown here) as Tsou et al. [2000] described.\n\nTime Series Analysis of the Ratio (Microwave/V8SBUV)\n\nMean Profile Differences (%) between V8 SBUV and Ground Measurements (Microwave, Lidar and Sonde)\n\nThe V8 SBUV profile ozone data are validated using ground-based data (microwave, LIDAR, and ozonesonde) with independent calibrations and derivation methods at various locations around globe. Microwave and LIDAR data are available from NDSC . Ozonesonde data are archived in World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Center(WOUDC). The first two initials of the names of stations are used as legends on the plots as follows;\n\nMicrowave: LA(Lauder), MA(Mauna Loa), TA(Table Mt).\n\nLidar: OH(OHP), MA(Mauna Loa), TA(Table Mt).\n\nSonde: HO(Hohenpeissenberg), PA(Payerne), WA(Wallops Island), HI (Hilo).\n\nMicrowave comparisons with NOAA-9, NOAA-11, and NOAA-16\n\nLidar comparisons with NOAA-9, NOAA-11, and NOAA-16\n\nSonde comparisons with Nimbus-7, NOAA-9, and NOAA-11\n\nThe mean percentage differences are calculated by averaging all matched-up samples for those time periods: (Nimbus-7: Dec. 1978 to Dec. 1990), (NOAA-9: Jan. 1993 to Feb. 1998), (NOAA-11: Dec. 1988 to Dec. 2001), (NOAA-16: Oct. 2000 to Sept. 2002). The �1 standard error bars shown on the plots are calculated by dividing the standard deviation of percent difference by the square root of the number of coincidences at that altitude minus one. The numbers in parentheses indicate the number of coincidences for a station. For most of the upper and lower layers, these numbers are slightly reduced because of the sparse sampling of coincidences. The comparison results indicate that V8 SBUV ozone profiles generally agree with external data sources in the altitude range 24 to 50 km (30 hPa and 1 hPa) to within � 10% (~5% on average). These results are consistent with Microwave, SAGE II, LIDAR, and ozonesonde comparison results from Brinksma et al., [2002], Leblanc et al., [2000], and Tsou et al., [2000].\n\nReferences\n\nBrinksma, E.
