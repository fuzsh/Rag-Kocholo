In Haan, the chance of a wet day over the course of November is essentially constant, remaining around 31% throughout.\n\nFor reference, the year's highest daily chance of a wet day is 37% on December 22, and its lowest chance is 25% on April 8.\n\nRainfall\n\nTo show variation within the month and not just the monthly total, we show the rainfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day.\n\nThe average sliding 31-day rainfall during November in Haan is essentially constant, remaining about 2.1 inches throughout, and rarely exceeding 3.6 inches or falling below 0.7 inches.\n\nSun\n\nOver the course of November in Haan, the length of the day is rapidly decreasing. From the start to the end of the month, the length of the day decreases by 1 hour, 24 minutes, implying an average daily decrease of 2 minutes, 55 seconds, and weekly decrease of 20 minutes, 23 seconds.\n\nThe shortest day of the month is November 30, with 8 hours, 15 minutes of daylight and the longest day is November 1, with 9 hours, 40 minutes of daylight.\n\nThe earliest sunrise of the month in Haan is 7:25 AM on November 1 and the latest sunrise is 48 minutes later at 8:12 AM on November 30.\n\nThe latest sunset is 5:04 PM on November 1 and the earliest sunset is 37 minutes earlier at 4:28 PM on November 30.\n\nDaylight saving time is observed in Haan during 2024, but it neither starts nor ends during November, so the entire month is in daylight saving time.\n\nFor reference, on June 20, the longest day of the year, the Sun rises at 5:16 AM and sets 16 hours, 35 minutes later, at 9:51 PM, while on December 21, the shortest day of the year, it rises at 8:33 AM and sets 7 hours, 53 minutes later, at 4:26 PM.\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of the sun's elevation (the angle of the sun above the horizon) and azimuth (its compass bearing) for every hour of every day in the reporting period. The horizontal axis is the day of the year and the vertical axis is the hour of the day. For a given day and hour of that day, the background color indicates the azimuth of the sun at that moment. The black isolines are contours of constant solar elevation.\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in November in Haan\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in November in HaanNov11223344556677889910101111121213131414151516161717181819192020212122222323242425252626272728282929303012 AM12 AM2 AM2 AM4 AM4 AM6 AM6 AM8 AM8 AM10 AM10 AM12 PM12 PM2 PM2 PM4 PM4 PM6 PM6 PM8 PM8 PM10 PM10 PM12 AM12 AMOctDec001010202000010102030\n\nnortheastsouthwest\n\nMoon\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of key lunar data for November 2024. The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the colored areas indicate when the moon is above the horizon. The vertical gray bars (new Moons) and blue bars (full Moons) indicate key Moon phases.

Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Haan is essentially constant during November, remaining around 0% throughout.\n\nFor reference, on July 13, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 1% of the time, while on October 7, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Haan is essentially constant during November, remaining within 0.1 miles per hour of 10.9 miles per hour throughout.\n\nFor reference, on January 17, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 12.5 miles per hour, while on August 4, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 8.2 miles per hour.\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in Haan throughout November is predominantly from the south, with a peak proportion of 46% on November 1.\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nThe growing season in Haan typically lasts for 6.8 months (208 days), from around April 15 to around November 9, rarely starting before March 30 or after May 2, and rarely ending before October 13 or after December 5.\n\nDuring November in Haan, the chance that a given day is within the growing season is rapidly decreasing falling from 64% to 15% over the course of the month.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in November in Haan\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Haan are essentially constant during November, remaining within 12Â°F of 1,994Â°F throughout.\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Haan is gradually decreasing during November, falling by 0.7 kWh, from 1.5 kWh to 0.8 kWh, over the course of the month.\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in November in Haan\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in November in HaanNov1122334455667788991010111112121313141415151616171718181919202021212222232324242525262627272828292930300.0 kWh0.0 kWh0.5 kWh0.5 kWh1.0 kWh1.0 kWh1.5 kWh1.5 kWh2.0 kWh2.0 kWh2.5 kWh2.5 kWh3.0 kWh3.0 kWh3.5 kWh3.5 kWh4.0 kWh4.0 kWhOctDecNov 11.5 kWhNov 11.5 kWhNov 300.8 kWhNov 300.8 kWhNov 111.2 kWhNov 111.2 kWh\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Haan are 51.194 deg latitude, 7.013 deg longitude, and 551 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Haan contains significant variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 502 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 502 feet. Within 10 miles contains significant variations in elevation (1,286 feet). Within 50 miles contains very significant variations in elevation (2,913 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Haan is covered by artificial surfaces (55%), cropland (30%), and trees (10%), within 10 miles by artificial surfaces (41%) and cropland (31%), and within 50 miles by cropland (41%) and trees (25%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Haan, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 4 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Haan.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Haan according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Haan is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Haan and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nDÃ¼sseldorf International Airport (EDDL, 47%, 13 mi, northwest, -407 ft elevation change)\n\nCologne Bonn Airport (EDDK, 23%, 23 mi, south, -249 ft elevation change)\n\nNÃ¶rvenich Air Base (ETNN, 17%, 29 mi, southwest, -167 ft elevation change)\n\nDortmund Airport (EDLW, 13%, 34 mi, northeast, -128 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Haan and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
