        "text": "Unprecedented heat extremes have been ravaging the globe in recent years1,2,3,4. July 2023 was confirmed as the hottest month on record, ~1.5 °C warmer than the pre-industrial level5. Elevated heat stress has emerged as a prominent global climate concern and the upward trend is expected to intensify due to ongoing global warming6. The impact of heat stress is mediated by moisture levels, and metrics are critical for risk assessment of moist heat with respect to human health and food security7,8. Wet bulb temperature (Tw), a synthetical variable combining temperature and humidity, is widely adopted to characterize extreme heat events and limit thresholds are set for survivability (35 °C9,10,). Heat and humidity together put people at greatly increased risks as elevated Tw hampers body’s ability to sweat, potentially leading to heat stroke within a few hours11,12,13. Significant health consequences, encompassing both morbidity and mortality, materialize at considerably lower Tw values, in contrast to those with conventional air temperature metrics14,15,16.\n\nAmplified summertime Tw over past decades was well documented17,18 and it was projected to further rise in a continuously warming world, particularly in tropical and mid-latitude regions, which are home to roughly half of the world’s population19,20,21. As Tw considers the influence of humidity, its variation is fundamentally governed by the interplay between air temperature and atmospheric moisture18,22. Notable warming of land surface temperature has been extensively observed since 190023, while shifts in atmospheric moisture exhibit considerable spatial heterogeneity, influenced by multiple factors including topography, vegetation, and climate patterns24,25,26,27,28. These multifaceted influences introduce uncertainties in understanding and attribution of historical and future variations of heat risk22.\n\nChina is one of world’s largest countries in terms of land areas where topography, land use and climate exhibit significant interregional diversities29,30,31. Owing to its lower latitudes, dense forest cover, and the impact of the East Asia summer monsoon, southern China typically experiences more pronounced heat stress, characterized by higher Tw values, during summer months compared with other parts of the country32,33. China’s Tw has undergone rapid intensification since 1960s, primarily attributed to human induced climate change34,35,36, exerting substantial heat stress on its vast population. However, both rising and falling trends in atmospheric moisture were identified across China. For example, notable decreases in atmospheric moisture were found in South China during 1961–201437 and Southwest China during 1979–201338, and increasing tendencies were confirmed in the Yangtze River basin during 1961–200539. This indicates that Tw is likely to change differently across regions under climate change, which has not been fully understood. Given the significance of heat stress with respect to human health and food security, a better understanding of how historical and future Tw evolves in different regions and the key driving factors would better assist mitigation and adaptation of heat stress, particularly for populous country like China.\n\nIn this study, we report different observed Tw variations over 1979–2018 between northern and southern China, and we find the dominant role of Ea changes in determining the different trend of Tw in southern China from northern China. We associate the heterogeneity of Ea with faster warming of high-latitude regions of East Asia under global warming, which regulates large-scale atmospheric features and leads to extended impacts of the South Asia high (SAH) and the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) over southern China and suppressed moisture transport. Attribution analysis using climate model simulations confirm our findings and we further project that the entire eastern China where 94% of China’s population live is likely to face widespread and uniform elevated thermal stress under such south-to-north spatially heterogeneous influence at the end of this century. These findings call for development of adaptation measures to avoid adverse impacts of heat stress.\n\nSpatiotemporal variations of Tw in China over 1979–2018\n\nThe spatial distribution of summertime Tw across China during the period of 1979–2018 reveals a discernible decrease from the southeastern coastal areas toward inland regions (Fig. 1A). Over the period of 1979–2018, Tw shows increasing trends across the majority of stations, particularly pronounced in northern China where the increasing rate surpasses 0.2 K/decade. However, the rate of increase is notably smaller for southern stations, and decreases in Tw are detected in parts of southern China (Fig. 1B). Surface homogenized humidity products and reanalysis datasets also exhibit similar spatial patterns of Tw trend (see Fig. S1 and S2), confirming the major feature of spatial distributions of Tw variations we find based on surface observations. We categorized stations into southern stations (latitude <33°N) and northern stations (latitude ≥33°N) based on locations relative to the latitude of 33°N since the Qinling-Huaihe Line (32°N~34°N) is commonly used to distinguish between northern and southern China. Regional average Tw for both northern and southern China exhibit statistically significant increasing trends (Fig. 1C). Yet the rate of increasing Tw in northern China (0.23 K/decade) is much higher than that of southern China (0.07 K/decade). Average Tw for four major urban populous agglomerations, namely Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), Yangtze River Delta (YRD), Sichuan Basin (SCB) and Pearl River Delta (PRD), also display distinctively upward trends (Fig. 1D). BTH, situated in northern China, exhibits the lowest initial value of Tw, whereas experiences the most rapid increase, with a remarkable rate of 0.16 K/decade.\n\nKey player of faster warming of high-latitudes in changing moisture and attribution analysis\n\nSince Tw is determined by the combined influences of air temperature (T) and actual water vapor pressure (Ea), variations in T and Ea can be used to explain Tw variations observed over the preceding decades. Sensitivity of Tw to T and Ea suggests that increasing Ea yields a more pronounced enhancement of Tw, particularly evident when T is relatively low (Supplementary Fig. S3). Changes in Tw when either T or Ea varied but the other factor fixed at year 1979 highlight that Ea changes are responsible for the observed different Tw trends in southern China (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S4). Over the study period of 1979–2018, Ea trends exhibit a distinct North-South divide, characterized by higher enhancement over northern stations (a rate of 0.16 hPa/decade) but a lower rate over southern stations that contracted by declining Ea (Fig. 2C, D). Ea is subject to the influences of several factors including surface evaporation and water vapor dispersion, which in turn can be affected by variables such as surface temperature, land use, precipitation, and atmospheric circulation40,41,42. Over northern China, significant increasing trends in evaporation are identified (Fig. 3A). However, southern China witnesses a decreasing trend in evaporation (Fig. 3A) alongside a concurrent trend of moisture divergence (Fig. 3B). These two factors synergistically lead to a reduction in Ea within that region. Apart from atmospheric processes, land use changes also exert impacts on Ea43. China’s rapid urbanization since 1979 has converted natural land to impervious urban areas, reducing water evaporation44,45. The probability density function (PDF) of Ea changes indicates that Ea is more likely to decrease in areas with land use conversion (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Many stations in southern China experienced such conversion during the period of 1979–2018 (Supplementary Fig. S5B), which may partly contribute to Ea decline.\n\nTo understand the underlying mechanism and factors causing Tw variations in preceding decades, we conducted an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis on Tw during the period of 1979–2018. The first leading mode of EOF, accounting for 42.7% of the total variance, shows consistent Tw changes across China with observed trend of Tw variations, characterized by faster increasing rate in northern China (Supplementary Fig. S6A). In line with the significant positive changes revealed by regression of Ts on PC1 (Fig. 4A), Ts also shows significantly increasing trend during the period of 1979–2018 (Fig. 4B) over the high-latitude regions of East Asia. The more rapid warming in this arid region may be due to its low heat capacity23 and lower anthropogenic aerosol emissions compared to lower latitudes46. These observations can be further supported by the findings of surface air temperature changes under GHG-only and aerosols-only forcing outputs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) experiments (Supplementary Fig. S7). It implies that the intensified surface temperature over this region positively contributes to the dominant mode of Tw variations. During the study period, mean surface temperature in summer within the high-latitude regions of East Asia displays a notably increasing trend of 0.51 °C decade−1 (Fig. 4C), which is significantly correlated with PC1 (0.73, p < 0.01) (Fig. 4D). Faster warming of the high-latitude region results in upper atmospheric pressure heightened, which leads to anticyclone enhancement in northern regions at upper levels (Supplementary Fig. S8A, B). Anticyclone enhancement in northern regions triggers the eastward and northward extension of the South Asia high (SAH, represented by 16760-dagpm line on 100 hPa47) (Fig. S9A, B), and westward and northward marching of the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH, represented by 5880-dagpm line on 500 hPa48) (Supplementary Fig. S9C, D), which are typically situated over the Tibetan region and the Western Pacific Ocean in summer, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S8A, B). Increased influences of the SAH and WPSH over larger swathes of southern China lead to descending motion prevailing over southern China at lower levels, suppressing moisture transport from both the Bay of Bengal and the South China Sea but accelerating moisture transport from the Pacific Ocean to northern China (Supplementary Fig. S8C, D). Correlation and composite analyses further verify the strong connection between Tw, and the SAH and WPSH as Tw tends to be higher in northern regions but lower in southern regions when the SAH and WPSH are in higher latitudes (Supplementary Figs. S10 and S11). This results in declined water vapor in the atmosphere, and further suppresses precipitation, leading to less water content of the ground that can be evaporated (Fig. 3D). Historical changes of geopotential height and atmospheric circulation are highly consistent with regression results (Supplementary Figs. S12 and S13), highlighting their contributions to Tw variations.\n\nWe further quantified the contributions of different external forcings to Tw changes. Although the CMIP6 historical simulation cannot fully capture certain decreases of Tw in southern China, different increasing rates of Tw between northern and southern China (0.3 K/decade higher in northern China) can be found (Supplementary Fig. S14B). We find the dominant influence of greenhouse gases (GHG) on variations of Tw (Supplementary Figs. S15 and S16A, approximately 63%), followed by aerosols (AER, ~24%) (Supplementary Figs. S15 and S16B). GHG dominates Tw changes across China, except in the northeastern desert regions (Supplementary Fig. S16E), with a more pronounced effect over South China (Supplementary Fig. S16A). Natural factors (NAT) and land use (LU) play a relatively minor role (Supplementary Fig. S16C, D). In line with Supplementary Fig. S5, LU exerts a negative influence on Tw variations due to urbanization and reduced evaporation, particularly notable in southern regions (Supplementary Fig. S14F). We also employed the empirical decomposition method (EMD) on Tw variations first to separate internal natural variability and external anthropogenic forcing (Supplementary Fig. S17), and then applied the EOF decomposition on external signal. Similar contributions of GHG (~68.6%) and AER (~23.8%) to Tw variations were found (Supplementary Fig. S18).\n\nWidely-spread and uniformly elevated future heat stress in China\n\nGiven the advantage of high resolution and better regional details, WRF-Chem downscaling model results were used for future projections of heat stress in China. Consistent with historical observations, projected Tw in southern China in Hist period is notably higher than that in other parts of China (Fig. 5A). However, uniform high heat stress is projected for the entire eastern China by the end of the century under both the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios (Fig. 5B, C). These changes are caused by the accelerated increase of Tw in northern regions (Fig. 5D, E). Under the SSP2-4.5 scenario, the most substantial enhancement (by approximately 4–5 °C) of Tw occurs in the North China Plain (NCP), higher than those of ~2–3 °C in southern regions (Fig. 5D). Under the SSP5-8.5 scenario, Tw in the NCP reaches a level comparable to that of traditionally warmer areas like the PRD (Fig. 5C). This phenomenon results from a substantial difference in the increase of Tw between the NCP and the PRD. The rise in Tw within the NCP is approximately 3 °C greater than that of southern China (Fig. 5E). Spatial distribution of Tw trends across whole China from the CMIP6 experiments adopted in the attribution analysis are consistent with downscaling simulations (Supplementary Fig. S19A–C). Average changes of Tw from all 12 CMIP6 models are 2.29 ± 0.69 °C and 2.02 ± 0.49 °C under the SSP2-4.5 scenario (Supplementary Fig. S19D, E); 4.64 ± 1.31 °C and 4.17 ± 1.25 °C under the SSP5-8.5 scenario (Supplementary Fig. S19F, G) in northern and southern China, respectively. Although changes of Tw under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios from the CMIP6 are relatively smaller compared to WRF-Chem simulations due to its limited representation of spatial details on local scales49,50, they display similar spatial diversity that Tw in northern China increases faster than that in southern China.\n\nIn accordance with historical trends, simulated increases in T display a subtle absence of distinction between northern and southern regions (Supplementary Fig. S20A, B). In contrast, there are notable spatial differences in Ea changes, characterized by a more pronounced elevation in northern China (Supplementary Fig. S20C, D). This phenomenon can be attributed to anticipated shifts in atmospheric systems (Supplementary Figs. S21 and S22). Under a warming climate, both SAH and WPSH exhibit substantial intensification, with a notable increase in central pressure (Supplementary Fig. S21). This leads to zonal nearing of these two systems and weakened tropical easterly jet51 but accelerated westerly winds over subtropical regions at upper troposphere52,53 (Supplementary Fig. S23C, D). The accelerated westerly wind enhances the eastward propagation of Kelvin waves54,55 and convergence of cross-equatorial flows56,57. As a result, the descending motion is intensified over tropical regions58 and consequently anomalous anticyclone is found over the Bay of Bengal and South China Sea at lower troposphere (Supplementary Fig. S23E–H). Similar atmospheric circulation anomaly has been observed during the extreme dry-wet contrast event between southern and northern China in 202059,60. Accordingly, influenced by the air flow at the ridge of anticyclone, more water vapor is transported to the Pacific Ocean instead of to southern China, different from the enhanced moisture transport from the Pacific Ocean to northern China (Supplementary Fig. S23). Under both the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, the increase in Tw resulting from changes in Ea is notably more substantial than that by T across most regions of China (Fig. 6). The impact of elevated Ea contributes roughly twice of the influence of T to increased Tw, particularly in humid and semi-humid areas.\n\nTw has gained considerable attention as a pivotal metric to characterize heat risks on public health61,62,63. Yet spatial heterogeneity of historical and future Tw variations in China and the underlying reasons have not been well understood. In this study, we revealed the spatially differentiated historical Tw changes in China, characterized by a faster rise of Tw and a more pronounced aggravation of heat stress in northern China. We found the dominant role of changes in Ea and attributed such heterogeneity to declining Ea across most of the southern areas, which was associated with faster warming in high-latitude regions of East Aisa. A faster warming of high-latitudes of East Asia regulates atmospheric features, leading to extended impacts of the SAH and WPSH over southern China and suppressed moisture transport under global warming. Dynamical downscaled future projections further demonstrate the findings from historical records that future Tw variations will mainly be regulated by changes in Ea, which exhibit south-to-north spatial heterogeneity under a warming climate. Accordingly, the entire eastern China where 94% of China’s population live is likely to experience widespread and uniform elevated thermal stress at the end of this century, particularly under the SSP5-8.5 scenario. These findings necessitate development of adaptation measures to avoid adverse impacts of heat stress, in addition to investments in renewables.\n\nWhile multi-model ensembles (MME) data helps mitigate internal climate variability, the influence of low-frequency variability64, such as the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), could still impact the long-term trend of Tw in attribution analysis due to the relatively short period considered in this study65. The alignment of EMD analysis (Supplementary Fig. S17) and EOF decomposition (Supplementary Fig. S18) on observed Tw variations with the results obtained from attribution analysis (Supplementary Fig. S15) underscores the relatively small impact of internal climate variability on Tw variations during the study period, indicating minor impacts on main findings. Our study is still limited by computational resources. A five-year average of downscaled future climate could be influenced by internal climate variability, leading to uncertain projections. Using data from the CMIP6 experiments listed in Supplementary Table S1, we reveal significant increasing trends in Tw across China under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios from 2015 to 2100 (Supplementary Fig. S24). Notably, we observe a pronounced south-north difference, particularly under the SSP5-8.5 scenario, indicating that the non-uniform enhancement of Tw due to global warming is reasonably robust. Regional downscaling covering longer decades would contribute to better projections for China if computational resources permit.\n\nOur study holds several important implications for understanding the evolving dynamics of Tw and its driving factors in China. The acceleration of Tw increases in northern China challenges the conventional understanding of China’s regional summer climates, which historically categorized the south as hot and humid and the north as dry66,67,68. This shift in perception holds significant implications for climate adaptation and policy development, prompting a reevaluation of strategies to address evolving heat stress patterns. The examination of East Asia’s climatic systems’ impact on regional climate patterns provides valuable insights into the larger-scale mechanisms that shape Tw trends. Our findings contribute to the broader understanding of climate change’s intricate impacts on heat stress in a specific geographic context.\n\nBy dissecting the interplay between T and Ea, our study sheds light on the important influence of Ea, particularly under specific temperature conditions. This understanding is crucial for accurate heat stress assessments and efforts of disaster preparedness. Under the background of global warming, China confronts an ongoing rise in heat extremes69,70,71,72. The elevation of air temperature is accompanied by a surge in the occurrence of compound extremes, including extreme heat wave coupled with drought73,74,75, regional compound heat and precipitation extremes76,77,78, and cooccurrence of heat wave and ozone pollution62,79. A profound understanding of dominant factors in these heat-induced natural disasters is pivotal in devising more effective strategies to mitigate and address these challenges.\n\nObservations, reanalysis and land use data\n\nSurface observations of daily air temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) at 2 meters from 1979 to 2018 were obtained from the weather stations maintained by the China Meteorological Administration (CMA). We selected this study period because the number of surface weather stations of used dataset increased notably after 1979 (Supplementary Fig. S25A), and there was a shift in the trend of Tw variations from a decreasing trend to an increasing trend after the late-1970s (Supplementary Fig. S25B), largely due to global warming indicated by surface temperature anomaly since late-1970s (Supplementary Fig. S25C). We calculated actual water vapor pressure based on Eqs. (1) and (2):\n\n$${RH}=\\frac{{E}_{a}}{{E}_{s}}\\times 100\\%$$\n\n(1)\n\n$${E}_{s}=6.112\\times {e}^{\\frac{17.62\\times T}{T+243.12}}$$\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Es represents saturated water vapor pressure. Following Stull10 and Xiao et al.62, Tw (°C) was calculated using Eq. (3):\n\n$${T}_{w}= T\\cdot {atan}\\left[0.151977{\\left({RH}+8.313659\\right)}^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\right] \\\\ +{atan}\\left(T+{RH}\\right) - {atan} \\left({RH\\; - }1.676331\\right) \\\\ +0.00391838{\\left({RH}\\right)}^{\\frac{3}{2}}\\cdot {atan}\\left(0.023101\\cdot {RH}\\right) - 4.686035$$\n\n(3)\n\nwhere T denotes temperature in °C, and RH stands for relative humidity in % format. This formulation is applicable for RH ranging from 5% to 99% and temperature ranging from −20 to 50 °C10, which are reasonable ranges for this study. Tw calculated with other methods80,81 showed comparable spatial distributions of average and variation over the period of 1979–2018 (Supplementary Fig. S26). Using Eqs. (1)–(3), we obtained T and Ea sensitivity by calculating Tw with T and Ea ranging from 10 °C to 40 °C and 10 hPa to 40 hPa, respectively. When Ea exceeded the saturated water vapor pressure, RH was set to 100%.\n\nMeteorological variables including monthly gridded surface air temperature, surface dew point, evaporation, total precipitation, geopotential height and u- and v-components of wind at 100 hPa and 500 hPa, vertical integrated moisture divergence for the same time period were obtained from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis version 5 (ERA5) dataset82. The spatial resolution of these variables was 0.25° × 0.25°.\n\nHomogenized daily surface relative humidity from Li et al.83 and surface air temperature from Argiriou et al.84 were employed to verify the trend of Tw and Ea derived from the original observations. We also adopted monthly Tw and Ea from the Met Office Hadley Centre Integrated Surface Database Humidity (HadISDH, https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadisdh). HadISDH is a homogenized and quality controlled 5° × 5° gridded global surface humidity dataset85. It is derived from a variety of sources, including weather station observations, satellite measurements, and reanalysis models. Daily maximum Tw at 1834 stations that had passed quality control and been homogenized were obtained from the global station-based daily maximum wet-bulb temperature (GSDM-WBT) data provided by Dong et al.86. Specific humidity and air temperature at 2 meters from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA2)87 were adopted to calculate Ea and Tw. The spatial resolution of these variables was 0.625° × 0.5°.\n\nLand use dataset in China was obtained from National Tibetan Plateau Data Center (https://data.tpdc.ac.cn). The data generation relied on Landsat Thematic Mapper ™ /Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) Remote Sensing Images, and it was produced through manual visual interpretation. The data set included seven periods: the end of 1980s, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015. The spatial resolution of this dataset was 30 m. We determined conversion time when the first time the station location grid changed to urban land use.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nWe adopted EOF analysis to decompose spatiotemporal variations of Tw during the period of 1979–2018 in China. Student T-test was used to detect the statistical significance of the regression coefficient and correlation coefficient. We also employed EMD decomposition on Tw variations to separate internal natural variability and external anthropogenic forcing. EMD is a data-adaptive multiresolution technique to decompose non-linear and non-stationary signals by separating them into physically meaningful components at different resolutions88. Decomposed signals can be considered as periodic oscillations with different frequencies89,90, while the residual can capture impacts of external forcings91. Additionally, we conducted EOF analysis on external signals to obtain the dominant patterns or modes of variability and linked them to the contributions of each anthropogenic factor including GHG, AER and LU.\n\nWe also conducted composite analysis on latitude and longitude of the SAH and WPSH of years when extreme northward/southward and westward/eastward movements of the SAH and WPSH occurred. The extreme movements of the SAH and WPSH were defined as those latitudes and longitudes that were larger than one standard deviation. The PDFs for changes of Ea in areas with and without land use conversion were computed based on normal distribution using the following equation,\n\n$$f\\left(x\\right)=\\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi }}{e}^{-\\frac{{(x-\\mu )}^{2}}{{2\\sigma }^{2}}}$$\n\n(4)\n\nwhere σ is the sample standard deviation and μ is the mean value.\n\nCMIP6 historical simulations and attribution analysis\n\nThe historical simulations of monthly T and RH driven by time evolving all forcings and single forcing from the Detection and Attribution Model Intercomparison Project (DAMIP)92 and the Land Use Model Intercomparison Project (LUMIP)93 in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) were employed in this study to assess climate response to individual forcings, including GHG-only (GHG), aerosols-only (AER), natural-only (NAT) and land use-only (LU). We used a total least-squares optimal fingerprinting approach to attribute the contribution of each single forcing to variations of Tw under all forcing conditions94,95. It is a generalized linear regression model to portray variations of Tw as a linear amalgamation of alterations induced by GHG, AER, NAT and LU. The regression model is:\n\n$${T}_{{all}}={\\beta }_{{GHG}}{T}_{{GHG}}+{\\beta }_{{AER}}{T}_{{AER}}+{\\beta }_{{NAT}}{T}_{{NAT}}+{\\beta }_{{LU}}{T}_{{LU}}+\\varepsilon$$\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \\({T}_{{all}}\\) is a vector of variations of Tw caused by all forcings, and \\({T}_{{GHG}}\\), \\({T}_{{AER}}\\), \\({T}_{{NAT}}\\) and \\({T}_{{LU}}\\) are estimates of the responses to GHG, AER, NAT and LU forcing, respectively. The β terms stand for the corresponding scaling factors, and ε is the residual variability generated internally in the climate system. As most models only provide outputs ending in 2014, the historical simulations over the period of 1979–2014 were considered. We calculated the ensemble mean of runs contributed by each single model and then calculated the average of all models to ensure equal weighting for each model in this analysis. The model outputs were interpolated to the resolution of 1° × 2° using liner interpolation, and the list of selected models is shown in Supplementary Table S1.\n\nDynamical downscaling of current and future Tw in China\n\nIn this study, we also used the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) version 3.6.1 to predict current and future regional climate of China with horizontal grid resolutions of 36 km × 36 km. The chemistry of air pollutants and their interactions with regional climate were also included. Gas-phase and aerosol chemistry were modeled by the Carbon-Bond Mechanism version Z (CBMZ)96 and the 8-bin version of the Model for Simulating Aerosol Interactions and Chemistry (MOSAIC)97. To address underprediction of sulfate in China, heterogeneous reactions were integrated based on Gao, et al.98. Other physical parameterizations were aligned with those in Gao et al.99, including Lin microphysics100, RRTM long wave radiation101, Goddard short wave radiation102, Noah land surface model103, and the Yonsei University planetary boundary layer parameterization104.\n\nThe historical simulation spanned five years from 2010 to 2014 (referred to as Hist). Meteorological initial and boundary conditions for Hist were derived from the 6-hourly National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) FNL (Final) analysis data (https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds083-2/), provided at a resolution of 1.0° × 1.0°. For the future simulation, a timeframe of five years, ranging from 2096 to 2100, was considered for both the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios105. SSP2-4.5 represents a medium pathway for future greenhouse gas emissions and incorporates an additional radiative forcing of 4.5 W m−2 by 2100. SSP5-8.5 symbolizes a fossil-fueled development trajectory, accompanied by intensified fossil fuel exploitation and an energy-intensive global lifestyle, with an additional radiative forcing of 8.5 W m−² by the year 2100. Meteorological initial and boundary conditions for the future downscaling simulation were sourced from a bias corrected CMIP6 global dataset, encompassing 18 models from the CMIP6 under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios106. Chemical initial and boundary conditions were maintained at 2010 levels using Community Atmosphere Model with Chemistry (CAM-chem) model outputs107. To enhance the accuracy of simulated meteorological variables, the four-dimensional data assimilation (FDDA) technique was adopted, effectively nudging horizontal winds, temperature, and moisture across all vertical levels. We used grid nudging and the adopted nudging coefficients for these variables were all 0.0003.\n\nCurrent and future anthropogenic air pollutant emissions and biomass burning emissions were taken from O’Neill et al.105. To ensure coherence with the chosen future scenarios, we used anthropogenic air pollutant emissions corresponding to the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios for respective simulations. Biogenic emissions were computed in real-time using the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN)108. Current and future Tw variations in China were then computed using Eq. (3) based on WRF-Chem model outputs."
