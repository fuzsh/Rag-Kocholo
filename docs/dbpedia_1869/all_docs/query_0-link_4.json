The pictures, and stories about the visits, will then be posted here.\n\nOverview\n\nThe project is an organized sampling of the world. There is a confluence within 49 miles (79 km) of you if you're on the surface of Earth. We've discounted confluences in the oceans and some near the poles, but there are still 9,685 to be found.\n\nYou're invited to help by visiting and photographing any one of these places. Read the Information pages, and contact us if you have questions. 25 confluences (14 new) in one journey\n\nDuring 4400 km journey on Northern Kazakhstan Valera and Denis visited 25 confluences, 14 of them were new-visited. It took only 6 days. The story starts 53°N 76°E\n\n4 new CPs in a remote European region\n\nTwo bikers Alexander Koptilkin and Alexander Evchenko have visited 4 new confluences in the remote forested region of North-East Europe. The story starts here\n\nOlder news..."
