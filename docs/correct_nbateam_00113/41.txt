The New Orleans Hornets don't want Chris Kaman around, but plenty of other teams do. After playing in 17 games for the Hornets, Kaman has missed the last five as the team tries to find a way to trade him.

The New Orleans Times-Picayune reports that rumored destinations for him include the Houston Rockets, Indiana Pacers, Cleveland Cavaliers, Golden State Warriors and San Antonio Spurs.

The Rockets are reportedly at the top of the heap with an offer that includes young players and draft picks, SI.com reports. The two young players that are being discussed, the paper notes, are center Hasheem Thabeet and power forward Jordan Hill, both of whom were in the top 10 picks of the 2009 draft.

Meanwhile, the Times-Picayune reports that a Houston television station reported Wednesday night that it was doubtful the Rockets would get a deal done for Kaman. The paper is hearing that the Indiana Pacers actually are leading the charge for Kaman's services as it wants to find a backup for Roy Hibbert.

The 29-year-old 7-footer, who has a $14 million expiring contract, averaged 9.2 points, 6.6 rebounds and 1.2 blocks per game in his 17 appearances this season.
