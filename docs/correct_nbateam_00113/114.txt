Center likely to miss the remainder of the season

The New Orleans Hornets announced today that center Chris Kaman has a bruised left tibia and is likely to miss the remainder of the season.

Kaman sustained the injury to his leg in the home win against the Memphis Grizzlies on Apr. 15. In 47 games this season (33 starts), Kaman averaged 13.1 points, 7.7 rebounds and a team-best 1.6 blocks per game. In his first season with New Orleans, the ninth-year pro led the team in rebounding 21 times and in scoring 10 times. Acquired alongside Eric Gordon, Al-Farouq Aminu and the more favorable between the Los Angeles Clippers’ and Minnesota Timberwolves’ 2012 first round draft picks on Dec. 14, 2011, the 7’0’’ center had a team-leading 15 double-doubles and six games of 20+ points/10+ rebounds this year.
