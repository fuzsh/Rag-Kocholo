        "text": "Hawkins has been ruled out for the remainder of Saturday's Summer League game against the Nuggets due to a right ankle injury.\n\nHawkins underwent X-rays after sustaining the injury, which came back negative. Still, the Pelicans will refrain from putting the 22-year-old back into its final Summer League contest. Hawkins will finish the game with three points (0-3 FG, 3-4 FT) and a block across 11 minutes. It's unclear if the injury will impact Hawkins' availability for training camp.\n\nMatkovic won't play in Saturday's Summer League game against the Nuggets due to left groin soreness, Will Guillory of The Athletic reports.\n\nA draft-and-stash player from the 2022 NBA Draft, Matkovic joined the Pelicans' G League affiliate late in the 2023-24 season and has been part of the team's Summer League roster in Las Vegas. With the Pelicans a bit thin in the frontcourt, Matkovic could see occasional playing time during the upcoming season. His groin injury shouldn't impact his availability for training camp.\n\nMissi won't play in Saturday's Summer League game against the Nuggets due to lower back soreness, Will Guillory of The Athletic reports.\n\nMissi won't suit up for the Pelicans' final Summer League contest as he tends to pain in his lower back. The 20-year-old flashed some of the rim protection and athleticism in Las Vegas that coaxed the Pelicans into selecting him with the 21st overall pick in this year's draft. He should be ready to go for training camp.\n\nMissi went 5-of-8 from the floor and 1-of-2 at the line Thursday, tallying 11 points, six rebounds, one assist, three blocks and one turnover across 30 minutes in an exhibition loss to Memphis.\n\nMissi hadn't been terribly impressive through his first three outings in Las Vegas, but he showed some promise Thursday with his instincts as a rim defender. He also exhibited some nice footwork in the post. Missi is an impressive athlete, so it'll be interesting to see what kind of role he can earn in New Orleans during his rookie season.\n\nMatkovic agreed to a three-year, $4.9 million contract with the Pelicans on Sunday, Shams Charania of The Athletic reports.\n\nSelected by the Pelicans with the No. 52 overall pick in the 2022 NBA Draft, Matkovic spent most of the last two seasons in Europe before joining New Orleans' G League affiliate, the Birmingham Squadron, this past February. He appeared in 10 games for Birmingham, averaging 17.3 points, 8.1 rebounds and 2.4 assists in 31.3 minutes per game. After recording eight points and eight rebounds for the Pelicans in his first outing in the Las Vegas Summer League on Friday, Matkovic has now been formally added to the club's 15-man roster after signing a contract, which includes a team option for 2026-27. Matkovic could find his way into the rotation for a new-look Pelicans squad that wasn't able to retain two key frontcourt players in Jonas Valanciunas and Naji Marshall in free agency.\n\nThe Pelicans signed Cain to a two-way contract Friday, Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN reports.\n\nCain spent last season with the Heat on a two-way deal, averaging 3.7 points and 1.4 rebounds in 10.0 minutes across 26 regular-season NBA appearances. In 2024-25, Cain is set to split time between the Pelicans and their G League affiliate, the Birmingham Squadron.\n\nThe Pelicans added Ford to their Summer League roster on Friday, Sean Cunningham of Fox 40 Sacramento reports.\n\nAfter playing with the Kings on a two-way contract last season and beginning the Las Vegas Summer League with Sacramento, Ford will now join the Pelicans' Summer League roster. The second-year guard will have an opportunity to compete for a regular-season roster spot.\n\nTheis and the Pelicans agreed to a one-year deal Monday, ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reports.\n\nTheis will be entering his eighth NBA season and will bring valuable veteran leadership to the locker room. With the Pelicans losing Jonas Valanciunas, Theis could potentially step into a sizable role right away in the frontcourt. Throughout his career, Theis holds averages of 7.4 points, 4.8 rebounds, 1.2 assists and 0.9 blocks."
