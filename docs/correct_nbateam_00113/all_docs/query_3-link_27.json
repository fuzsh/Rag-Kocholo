        "text": "Chris Kamara has opened up about his battle with apraxia after getting diagnosed with the neurological condition earlier this year.\n\nThe condition, which affects the body's motor function and often creates issues with speech, forced Kamara to step away from the majority of his broadcasting roles, most notably on Sky Sports' Soccer Saturday.\n\nKamara has now appeared on Steven Bartlett's Diary of a CEO podcast to talk about his diagnosis and how it has affected him.\n\nRead more: Chris Kamara shares underactive thyroid diagnosis\n\nThe 64-year-old former footballer said: \"I feel a fraud now in terms of broadcasting; I don't bring to the table what I used to.\"\n\nThe Ninja Warrior UK host added: \"So that's hard, my life away from the screen couldn't be any better. Grandkids, family, it's perfect. I feel I'm doing these programmes and they're not getting the best of me, but they're tolerating me, that's how it feels.\"\n\nWhile leaving his role on Sky Sports due to it being a live broadcast, Kamara has continued to work for ITV on a number of shows, including Ninja Warrior UK, that are pre-recorded.\n\nKamara also discussed the impact the condition has had on his voice: \"It feels like someone has taken over my voice box. The voice that used to come out would come out at 300 miles an hour, you’ve seen me on the results and Soccer Saturday, motormouth, talking and not even waiting for a breath, just keep going and going.\n\n\"Now when I hear myself or see myself on TV it’s someone else. It’s really strange.\"\n\nKamara has also been busy making a podcast with Ben Shephard for the BBC about football entitled Kammy & Ben’s Proper Football Podcast. Guests on the podcast include former England manager Sam Allardyce and current Leicester City coach Brendan Rogers.\n\nBefore becoming a TV pundit and broadcaster, Kamara was a professional footballer who played for the likes of Brentford, Swindon Town and Leeds."
