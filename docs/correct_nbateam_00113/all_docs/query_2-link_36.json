        "text": "Update Provided in New Orleans Pelicans, Trey Murphy Extension Talks\n\nThe New Orleans Pelicans have made some major changes to their roster this offseason. It is something that David Griffin, the team’s head of basketball operations, has not shied away from sharing his excitement about.\n\nOne Perfect Trade for New Orleans Pelicans to Move on from Brandon Ingram\n\nRumors have been circling around the New Orleans Pelicans all offseason long about a potential trade involving star forward Brandon Ingram. While no deal has been made yet, the Pelicans are still seemingly interested in moving Ingram.\n\nNBA Writer Opines Wild Idea of Pelicans Trading Zion Williamson\n\nThe New Orleans Pelicans have had an interesting offseason so far. In their biggest move of the offseason to date, they acquired star guard Dejounte Murray in a major trade with the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nTrade Idea Sees New Orleans Pelicans Ship Out Young Sharpshooter for Big Man\n\nRight now, the offseason is pretty quiet after free agency started in early-July and saw the New Orleans Pelicans make one of the most high-profile moves of the summer.\n\nThis New Orleans Pelicans, Warriors Trade Features Brandon Ingram\n\nThe New Orleans Pelicans are one of the teams who could very well be looking to make a blockbuster trade at this point in the NBA offseason. Of course, the move would be to send star forward Brandon Ingram to a new team.\n\nPotential Pelicans Trade Target Predicted to Land with Interesting Team\n\nThe New Orleans Pelicans certainly upgraded their roster on paper after the acquisition of Dejounte Murray in early-July. Having a true ball handler should allow this offense to improve even more after finishing 11th in offensive rating last season.\n\nFormer NBA Player Wants New Orleans Pelicans to Send Star Out West\n\nThe New Orleans Pelicans are still working through the NBA offseason. With Brandon Ingram still on the roster, which wasn't expected, they're considering different trade options or potentially keeping him on the team with their new-look group.\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans Duo Named Most ‘Bizarre’ Pairing in NBA\n\nThe New Orleans Pelicans have enjoyed some success in the Brandon Ingram and Zion Williamson era, but not as much as some have hoped for. While both players have potential star power and have shown that for parts of their careers together, the fit next to each other has often been questioned.\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans Rookie Isn't Afraid to Look Silly if It Shows Effort\n\nWith the New Orleans Pelicans seemingly moving past the Brandon Ingram discussions, the spotlight is getting even brighter on the center position. At least one young player in that group is showing he has the right mindset.\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans Current Roster Looks Strong And Ready For A Deep Run\n\nThe New Orleans Pelicans are gearing up for the 2024-25 NBA season with a roster overhaul aimed at breaking their playoff drought. The biggest splash came with the acquisition of Dejounte Murray from the Atlanta Hawks in exchange for Dyson Daniels, Larry Nance Jr., and two first-round picks.\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans Questioned About Lack of Certainty in One Key Area\n\nThe New Orleans Pelicans made one of the biggest moves of the offseason when they traded for Dejounte Murray. However, with that move now in place and looking at their roster as a whole, there's a big issue at the center position.\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans Trade Brandon Ingram To Give East Team Tantalizing Big 3?\n\nThe frontcourt situation of the New Orleans Pelicans isn’t looking too great at the moment, as they just lost Jonas Valanciunas in the NBA free agency.\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans Star Zion Williamson Facing Make or Break Season\n\nWhen the New Orleans Pelicans drafted Zion Williams with the No. 1 pick in the 2019 NBA Draft, it was expected that he would become the next big superstar in the league.\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans Grab Another Sharpshooter in 2025 NBA Mock Draft\n\nThe New Orleans Pelicans are looking to a way to fill out their roster this summer after they added Dejounte Murray in a trade to bolster their backcourt, but also don't have a starting center following the departure of Jonas Valanciunas.\n\nThree Centers the New Orleans Pelicans Should Pursue Via Trade\n\nThe New Orleans Pelicans have improved their roster this offseason. Acquiring Dejounte Murray was a big trade that adds more scoring ability, defense, and playmaking.\n\nNBA Expert Praises New Orleans Pelicans For 'Better' Roster After Key Moves\n\nThe New Orleans Pelicans have had one of the highest potential rosters in the NBA and the team is hoping that their moves so far this offseason can push them over the edge to true title contenders.\n\nThis Trade Proposal Would Add Perfect Center for New Orleans Pelicans\n\nThe New Orleans Pelicans' search for a starting center continues, as they don't have one on the current roster. They could get funky and put a non-center at the five, but that would bring issues, especially in the Western Conference with Nikola Jokic and others they'd have to deal with.\n\nKarlo Matkovic answering Pelicans’ closing center question\n\nProfessional sports is about more than just high-level athletic competition. Ego, status, money, and roles really matter when it comes to the fabric of building a team.\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans Boss Gives Major Update Regarding Plans for Their Star\n\nThe New Orleans Pelicans made one of the most high-profile moves of the summer when they landed Dejounte Murray in a deal with the Atlanta Hawks. That trade should help the Pelicans' backcourt improve with Murray moving into the playmaker role, allowing CJ McCollum to focus more on spacing and shooting as an off-ball player.\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans Summer League Star Looks Like A Hidden Gem\n\nThe New Orleans Pelicans have yet to win a game during the NBA Summer League, but could have found something more valuable. It's always important to take Summer League performances with a grain of salt, but rookie center Karlo Matkovic had a breakout night against the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nPelicans Continue To Add Center Depth, Will It Be Enough?\n\nIt was in the 2022 NBA Draft that the New Orleans Pelicans selected center Karlo Matkovic with the 52nd overall pick. Now more than two years later, it looks like the 23-year-old will get the chance to play in the league."
