        "text": "The New Orleans Hornets were unable to find a trade partner for Chris Kaman, and now both sides say that they might stick together beyond even this season. Reports the Times-Picayune: “Everything is always a possibility,’ Hornets GM Dell Demps said. ‘I mean there’s no reason to say I’m certain, 100 percent sure. There’s always a possibility. I never want to say never. But our intention is to keep Chris.’ Kaman was exiled from the team for one week earlier this season when it appeared a trade was imminent. When talks collapsed, Kaman was invited to re-join the team. He has started the last 17 games because starter Emeka Okafor has been out with a sore left knee. Over that span, Kaman has recorded a team-high 12 double-doubles. He said he thought he’d still be in New Orleans when Thursday’s trading deadline passed. ‘I didn’t anticipate being moved after all that whole situation before when they couldn’t find a trade, or a trade didn’t work out that they had. I just kept hearing that things were kind of dead,’ Kaman said. ‘I heard my name a couple of times the last couple of days, but mostly by you guys and some other people that I know in the media. I hadn’t really heard anything solid. So here I am to finish out the season with the Hornets.’ Kaman said he’s open to re-signing with the Hornets next season. ‘Yes sir, certainly,’ he said. Demps said the club was amenable as well. ‘We’re open to everything. We value Chris,’ Demps said. ‘The door’s not closed on him. I think he’s had a good season. He’s proven he can score the basketball. As we move forward, he’s been very impressive, especially in the last few weeks. The door is not closed on Chris. We’ll have his Bird rights this summer, so we think there’s a lot of opportunity still with Chris.'”"
