I’ve got a lot to thank Pompey for.”\n\nThe RNA offers those with a link to the Royal Navy access to a life-long community of like-minded and supportive individuals. Our community provides companionship, resilience, comradeship and unity to anyone and everyone with a Naval story, supporting them through life's highs and lows.\n\nBill Oliphant, Chief Executive of the RNA said: “We are very excited to have Chris ‘onboard’ he is a truly inspirational sportsman. Our membership spans all ages, all interests and is based all over the world and are delighted that Chris has come back to his Naval roots!”"
