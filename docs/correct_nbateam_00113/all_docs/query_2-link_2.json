        "text": "Won't return Saturday\n\nHawkins underwent X-rays after sustaining the injury, which came back negative. Still, the Pelicans will refrain from putting the 22-year-old back into its final Summer League contest. Hawkins will finish the game with three points (0-3 FG, 3-4 FT) and a block across 11 minutes. It's unclear if the injury will impact Hawkins' availability for training camp.\n\nSitting out SL finale\n\nA draft-and-stash player from the 2022 NBA Draft, Matkovic joined the Pelicans' G League affiliate late in the 2023-24 season and has been part of the team's Summer League roster in Las Vegas. With the Pelicans a bit thin in the frontcourt, Matkovic could see occasional playing time during the upcoming season. His groin injury shouldn't impact his availability for training camp.\n\nBattling back soreness\n\nMissi won't suit up for the Pelicans' final Summer League contest as he tends to pain in his lower back. The 20-year-old flashed some of the rim protection and athleticism in Las Vegas that coaxed the Pelicans into selecting him with the 21st overall pick in this year's draft. He should be ready to go for training camp."
