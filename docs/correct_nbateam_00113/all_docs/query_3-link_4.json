        "text": "Chris Kamara, one of the nation’s best-loved football pundits, has made a very special signing to join the Royal Naval Association (RNA), saying: \"Once a matelot always a matelot - it doesn't go away.\"\n\nHe has played top-flight football, managed Football League sides and appeared on TV for more than 20 years as a football commentator - and credits the Royal Navy as the springboard to his career.\n\nIt was while playing as a young midfielder for the RN back in 1974 that Kammy was spotted by scouts.\n\nPompey offered the Navy £200, the equivalent of about £2,500 today, to buy him out of his contract with the Senior Service.\n\nChris's Royal Navy career was brief - he joined at 16 and completed basic training at HMS Raleigh before moving on to HMS Vernon, the then-home of mine warfare in Portsmouth.\n\nKammy, who was already an adept footballer playing for Middlesbrough Boys before he signed up, quickly found his way into the RN side and the rest is history.\n\nChris was on the books of Pompey before his 17th birthday and playing first-team football at Fratton Park before he was 18.\n\nNearly half a century later, he has published his latest memoir - Kammy - and remains grateful for the opportunity the Navy gave him.\n\nNow, as a member of the RNA, he gets access to a community of like-minded and supportive individuals, supporting serving and ex-personnel through life's highs and lows.\n\n\"We are very excited to have Chris on board - he is a truly inspirational sportsman,\" said RNA chief executive Bill Oliphant.\n\n\"Our membership spans all ages, all interests and is based all over the world, and are delighted that Chris has come back to his Naval roots.\"\n\nEach month serving personnel, veterans, families and associate members join the 18,500-plus RNA."
