        "text": "NEW ORLEANS - Former Central Michigan University star Chris Kaman is expected to return to the New Orleans Hornets after the Hornets were unable to work out a deal for the former NBA all-star center.\n\nKaman has not been with the team since a shootaround on Jan. 27. During the trade talks, the Hornets deactivated him rather than risk an injury. The Hornets also eliminate Kaman from its pregame video show.\n\nKaman, 30, was part of the Hornets trade with the Los Angeles Clippers that sent Chris Paul to Los Angeles. Houston, Indiana and Cleveland showed the most interest, but were not able to meet New Orleans' asking price.\n\nAlso complicating the trade situation is the New Orleans ownership situation. The NBA owns the team and would probably have to approve the trade before it becomes official.\n\nKaman was an NBA all-star for the Clippers two years ago, averaging 18.5 points and 9.2 rebounds. This season, Kaman has alternated between starting and coming off the bench as New Orleans has decided to give more minutes to its younger players.\n\nIn 17 games this season, Kaman is averaging 9.2 points and 6.6 rebounds per game.\n\nThe NBA trade deadline is March 15. The Hornets are 4-19 heading into Saturday's 7:30 p.m. game against the Detroit Pistons."
