Last weekend at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, Larson raced to his first NASCAR victory since he was reinstated from a nearly yearlong suspension. He was hired by Hendrick Motorsports when NASCAR said the suspension would lift at the start of this year. KEEP IT COOLLast year's spring race in Phoenix was a hot one, with temperatures pushing close to 90 degrees. ... Jason Biggs, host of “Cherries Wild” on NASCAR broadcast partner Fox, is the grand marshal.\n\nLAS VEGAS – Kyle Larson wasn't sure he'd ever race again in NASCAR, and if he could, he didn't know who would even hire him. On Sunday at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, Larson raced to his first NASCAR victory since he was reinstated from a nearly yearlong suspension. “Thanks Mr. H. for believing in me,” Larson radioed to boss Rick Hendrick after crossing the finish line. Larson is considered one of the top talents in NASCAR but won just six times in six seasons with Chip Ganassi Racing. “He got in a great car, he's a great driver and he's going to make things happen,” runner-up Brad Keselowski said.\n\nBubba Wallace checks his helmet before the NASCAR Daytona 500 auto race at Daytona International Speedway, Sunday, Feb. 14, 2021, in Daytona Beach, Fla. (AP Photo/John Raoux)DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. – Bubba Wallace ran into trouble early and late in his first Daytona 500 driving for Michael Jordan. He still came out of NASCAR's marquee race with another milestone, becoming the first Black driver to lead a lap in the Daytona 500. Wallace dipped to the low line late in the second stage to grab the lead on lap 129 in the No. Wallace got caught up in a fiery, chaotic last lap and finished 17th in a race won by Michael McDowell. Wallace had a solid first two-thirds of the rain-delayed race at Daytona International Speedway after a tumultuous start in Jordan's debut race.\n\nRacers crash during the last lap in the NASCAR Daytona 500 auto race at Daytona International Speedway, Monday, Feb. 15, 2021, in Daytona Beach, Fla.

As a new season begins Sunday with the Daytona 500, a new era of social consciousness has enveloped the sport and NASCAR is committed for the long haul. There's not a Confederate flag to be found at the speedway. Born in Alabama but raised in North Carolina, Wallace no longer wanted to see the Confederate flag at his workplace. “There was a question at the time: Social justice, is that something a sport should do, NASCAR should do?\n\nAlex Bowman and William Byron were slated to lead the Daytona 500 field to green but that's in danger following Thursday night's qualifying races.

Wallace was selected as the driver in the first season of a new team that brought Jordan into NASCAR as a team owner. 23 Toyota for 23XI Racing, perhaps a promising sign he could be a force in the Daytona 500. NASCAR sets the front row for the Daytona 500 in Wednesday night’s qualifying session.

Paul met with NBA players, and they decided awareness wasn’t enough anymore. “Black Lives Matter” also was featured prominently on the league’s courts. Wallace, the only full-time Black driver at the NASCAR national level, first began speaking out against racial injustice in America in the spring. His car featured a “Black Lives Matter” paint scheme.\n\nNASCAR’s only Black full-time driver didn't watch the news before this summer, one of national unrest over politics and racial justice. Wallace successfully called on NASCAR to ban the display of the Confederate Flag at races, ran a “Black Lives Matter” paint scheme and became the central figure in a sport facing its own racial reckoning. He joined Martinsville Speedway President Clay Campbell and Matt Kaulig, owner of Xfinity Series team Kaulig Racing. Some fans railed against Wallace, who was assigned security at tracks because of threats NASCAR received against the driver. Jordan becomes the first Black majority NASCAR team owner with a Black driver.\n\n“But I don’t have to agree with it.”And that’s absolutely fine, said Ish Smith, the Wizards guard who signed Pittman’s cap. “When I played, players and coaches were never — maybe not never; rarely — asked about politics and voting,” Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. It’s an environment that led Wizards shooting guard Bradley Beal, Tennessee Titans linebacker Will Compton, NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace and others to proudly note they were voting for the first time. And led WNBA players Tamika Catchings and Chiney Ogwumike to sign up to be poll workers. And led Oklahoma City Thunder point guard Chris Paul to join nearly 2,500 people on a march to a voting site in North Carolina.\n\nPicking the car number for Michael Jordan's new NASCAR team was a slam dunk: Bubba Wallace will drive the No. 23 car when the team makes its debut next season.

The partnership was announced Monday night in coordinated social media posts by Jordan and Hamlin, with Wallace adding his own comment. “Historically, NASCAR has struggled with diversity and there have been few Black owners,\" Jordan said in his statement. Scott's 1964 victory at the Jacksonville 200 is the only win by a Black driver in Cup history. Jordan has twice traveled to the NASCAR season finale to watch Hamlin race for the championship.\n\n\"Racing in the Cup Series with a serious contender has always been my goal, and I’m looking forward to joining what is a very strong team. Chase Briscoe began the year chasing eight victories, the number he believes will earn him a Cup ride, and he won his seventh race last weekend. Carpoff in November 2018 named Chastain the driver of a full Xfinity Series ride at Ganassi that would be sponsored by DC Solar. The sponsorship money evaporated, Ganassi shuttered the Xfinity Series team and Chastain was out of a job about six weeks before the 2019 season opener. He ran 35 Cup races, made 19 starts in the Xfinity Series and raced for the Truck Series championship for Niece Motorsports.\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. Bubba Wallace is leaving Richard Petty Motorsports at the end of the season. NASCAR's only full-time Black driver informed RPM of his decision Thursday. This was not an easy decision as I have nothing but the utmost respect for Richard Petty and his family, but I believe it's time for someone else to take over the reins of the No. He has a career-best five top-10 finishes this season and is ranked a career-best 23rd in the Cup standings. He parlayed that into several sponsorship deals that have been negotiated in a way that Wallace could take them with him if he left RPM.\n\nNASCAR drivers don't plan to boycott Saturday night's, Aug. 29 race at Daytona International Speedway to raise awareness of social and racial injustices. NASCAR drivers do not plan to skip Saturday night's race at Daytona International Speedway to raise awareness of social and racial injustices. I can assure all of you that myself and many of my competitors are continuing to work hard with @NASCAR to continue the efforts and the fight for racial equality. \"I certainly think we need to continue our discussions about social and racial injustice, and we continue to educate ourselves. Seven-time NASCAR champion Jimmie Johnson on Friday agreed with Wallace that athletes have a right to share our opinion on social matters.\n\nColumbia Sportswear Co. on Wednesday announced a multiyear sponsorship with Wallace as a brand ambassador that will also put the company on the No. As discussions on sponsorship began, Wallace sent the company photographs of himself wearing a prized bright yellow ski jacket that was his first Columbia apparel purchase. It plans to use the deal with Wallace its first NASCAR driver and team sponsorship agreement to promote its product lines. Wallace, a six-time winner in NASCAR's Truck Series, liked the deal with Columbia because it is an authentic partnership that represents his interests. We're trying to find ways to incorporate photography while being outdoors, Wallace said.\n\nBRISTOL, Tenn. Bubba Wallace was wrecked out of the qualifying race for NASCARs annual All-Star event, ruining his shot of racing for the $1 million prize. One driver advanced into the All-Star race through a fan vote and Wallace had been leading when results were last updated by NASCAR a week ago. Aric Almirola advanced by winning the first stage, William Byron for winning the second stage and Matt DiBenedetto for winning the third stage. Crowd estimates for that event have been around 10,000 spectators, but the NASCAR race would likely be the largest sporting event in the United States since March. Meanwhile, Martin Truex Jr. failed inspection twice and forfeited the top starting spot in the All-Star race.\n\nExploiting racial tensions, Trump wrongly accused Bubba Wallace of perpetrating a hoax after one of his crew members discovered a rope shaped like a noose in a garage stall they had been assigned to. He has worn a shirt saying I Cant Breathe,\" raced with a Black Lives Matter paint scheme in Virginia and successfully lobbied for NASCAR's Confederate flag ban. For more than 70 years, the flag was a common and complicated sight at NASCAR races. The series first tried to ban the Confederate flag five years ago but did nothing to enforce the order. While Trump claimed NASCAR's ratings are down, they are actually up.\n\nGreg Drumwright, a minister at the Citadel Church & Campus Ministries, helped organize a group of Black fans to attend the NASCAR race at Talladega and support driver Bubba Wallace. We want to see that the call for diversification and true equity in the sport extends beyond the banning of the Confederate flag, Drumwright said. The group was about two dozen strong but only one had been to a NASCAR race before. We were there to stand with Bubba but what we learned through the media coverage is that it seems as if were standing with NASCAR, Drumwright said. Theres a willingness to listen and engage that NASCAR has that I dont believe they were sincere about earlier, said Bill Lester, one of at least seven other Black NASCAR drivers before Wallace.\n\nPINE HALL, N.C. A North Carolina racetrack has lost some partnerships after its owner advertised Bubba Rope for sale online days after NASCAR said a noose had been found in the garage stall of Bubba Wallace, the top series only Black driver.

We do not condone nor support the comments and posts that have been made the past week, the series said in a post online.\n\n(AP Photo/John Bazemore)LONG POND, Pa. Being an agent of change in NASCAR cuts both ways for Bubba Wallace. To others, the 26-year-old Wallace represents something else entirely and he has seen plenty of haters out on social media over his career. Its just what I feel in my heart, what feels right, Wallace said Friday. Its not like I wanted to be in this position or asked to be in this position, Wallace said. Lets get away from what happened at Talladega, Wallace said.\n\nDANBURY, N.C. (AP) The owner of a North Carolina racetrack advertised Bubba Rope for sale in a social media marketplace days after NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace, who is Black, announced a noose had been found in his garage at Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama. No one answered the phone at the speedway Thursday and the inbox couldn't accept a message seeking comment.

This photo provided by NASCAR shows the noose found in the garage stall of Black driver Bubba Wallace at Talladega Superspeedway in Talladega, Ala., on Sunday, June 21, 2020.

It also prompted criticism from some fans that NASCAR had somehow overreacted criticism NASCAR has bristled at and cited in releasing the photo from Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama. As you can see from the photo, the noose was real, as was our concern for Bubba,\" NASCAR President Steve Phelps said. NASCAR said out of 1,684 garage stalls at 29 tracks, only 11 had a garage door pull-down rope tied in a knot. Phelps said NASCAR had determined the noose was not in place when the October 2019 race weekend began but was created at some point during that weekend,\" he said.\n\nIn a statement earlier this week, NASCAR said it was \"angry and outraged.\" NASCAR, mentioning the FBI report, described the item as a \"garage door pull rope fashioned like a noose.\" \"It was a noose,\" Wallace said. What the FBI report saidThe FBI said it \"learned that garage number 4, where the noose was found, was assigned to Bubba Wallace last week.\" Although the noose is now known to have been in garage number 4 in 2019, nobody could have known Mr. Wallace would be assigned to garage number 4 last week,\" the agency said.\n\nNASCAR drivers and crew members sent a powerful message to the world on Monday: \"We stand with Bubba Wallace.\" The show of solidarity came a day after NASCAR announced that a noose was discovered inside Wallace's garage stall at Talladega Superspeedway. pic.twitter.com/Y1IRI5qpRe NASCAR (@NASCAR) June 22, 2020\"The drivers feel very strongly that they want to show their support of Bubba,\" NASCAR president Steve Phelps told reporters. \"No one should feel uncomfortable when they come to a NASCAR race.

The statement said the garage stall was assigned to Wallace last week in advance of the race scheduled for Sunday but held on Monday because of rain. Through video confirmed by NASCAR it was discovered the noose had been was in that garage as early as October 2019.\" Wallace, the only Black driver at NASCAR's top level, successfully pushed the stock car series to ban the Confederate flag at its venues less than two weeks ago.\n\nI will continue to proudly stand for what I believe in.The noose was discovered on the same day NASCAR's fledgling flag ban faced its biggest challenge. The ban took effect before last week's race near Miami, but there were only about 1,000 military members admitted into that race. Wallace, a 26-year-old Alabama native, said he has found support among fellow drivers for his stance on the flag. NBA star LeBron James tweeted his support to Wallace, calling the noose sickening! Know you dont stand alone! I dont think theres a place for it in NASCAR, to be honest with you, the 32-year-old said.\n\nCNN A noose was found in Bubba Wallace's garage stall Sunday, according to a statement from NASCAR. He even called on NASCAR to ban the Confederate flag, which they did on June 10. \"We are angry and outraged, and cannot state strongly enough how seriously we take this heinous act,\" NASCAR's statement read. NASCAR told CNN the garage area where the noose was found is restricted to essential personnel, which includes race teams, NASCAR officials, security and health and safety personnel. Sunday also saw the first time NASCAR fans returned to the track in Talladega, Alabama, where a Confederate flag with a \"Defund NASCAR\" banner was seen flying over the track.\n\nThe car of Bubba Wallace (43) is prepped on pit row prior to the start of the NASCAR Cup Series auto race at the Talladega Superspeedway in Talladega Ala., Monday June 22, 2020. Wallace climbed out of his car and wept. The race began with Martin Truex Jr. on the pole in front of a mostly empty venue. Up to 5,000 fans were allowed into Talladega for the race only the second race with fans since NASCAR returned from the pandemic-forced shutdown but attendance was significantly lower Monday after the one-day postponement because of rain. It doesnt matter what your opinion is, its when you cross that line, then your opinion no longer matters.\n\nA noose was found in Bubba Wallace's garage stall at Talladega Superspeedway Sunday afternoon, NASCAR announced. Wallace is NASCAR's only Black full-time driver and recently led the push to ban the Confederate flag from NASCAR events. Earlier this month, NASCAR banned the display of Confederate flags at their events. \"No one should feel uncomfortable when they come to a NASCAR race. So it starts with Confederate flags.\n\nAmong those fans: New Orleans Saints running back Alvin Kamara, who was wearing a T-shirt and cap with Wallaces name on them. But I know days like today are going to be talked about for a long time.Kamara thinks the same way. Sunday was his first time at a NASCAR race, but not his first time at a NASCAR track he caught a touchdown pass in Tennessees 45-24 win over Virginia Tech at Bristol in 2016. Not only did he laud Wallaces courage for speaking out, he also had high praise for the white drivers standing with Wallace. Let me say the right thing now, Kamara said.\n\nAnd after an exhausting few days, NASCAR is about to offer another daunting test at Homestead-Miami Speedway. I think its a great test of will. Its a great test to the drivers. And several drivers, Wallace included, severed ties with a popular helmet designer this week over social media posts largely related to the flag. Track officials at Homestead are renaming one of the facilitys trademarks, the tunnel at Turn 3 that leads drivers into the track, in Johnsons honor.\n\n(AP Photo/Steve Helber, File)CHARLOTTE, N.C. Bubba Wallace can count Spike Lee and Demi Lovato in his corner since he became the leader of NASCARs push for change. Wallace is the only black full-time driver at NASCAR's top level and has had to scrap for sponsorship money his entire career. The opportunity for RPM to support Wallace with the paint scheme was possible only because no other corporation had bought the hood space to advertise. His 2013 victory in a Truck Series race was the first national series win by an African American driver, and helped push him into NASCAR's elite Cup Series. Wallace isn't sure what comes next in his role as activist but he said he is determined to fight for equality.\n\nMARTINSVILLE, Va. Martin Truex Jr. cruised down the stretch and won his first NASCAR Cup race of the season on Wednesday night in the first race under the lights at Martinsville Speedway. Truex won the Martinsville grandfather clock on the paperclip-shaped track at just 0.526 miles. Already outspoken on social causes in NASCAR, Wallace denounced the flag and his message spread throughout sports. Boston tweeted questions about the race and seemed to enjoy the action at Martinsville: Do yall be pinned to the TV. Martinsville capped a stretch of seven straight Cup races since it resumed without fans at the track.\n\nFILE - In this Sept. 5, 2015, file photo, a Confederate flag flies in the infield before a NASCAR Xfinity auto race at Darlington Raceway in Darlington, S.C.

The decision had Confederate flag loyalists howling in protest and vowing to swear off the sport. Policing the policy may prove challenging and NASCAR did not offer details. The issue was pushed to the forefront this week by Bubba Wallace, NASCARs lone black driver and an Alabama native who called for the banishment of the Confederate flag and said there was no place for it in the sport.\n\nWell try to do that the right way, NASCAR executive vice president Steve ODonnell told SiriusXM on Thursday. It was really cool to see what Bubba was able to do, 2018 NASCAR champion Joey Logano said. And now comes the publicity surrounding the flag ban. As far as the optics, NASCAR didnt have a choice, NASCAR historian Dan Pierce said. But the cynical person in me, especially when youre dealing with NASCAR, is, did they get the OK from their sponsors ahead of time or from NASCAR?\n\nFILE - In this Sept. 5, 2015, file photo, a Confederate flag flies in the infield before a NASCAR Xfinity auto race at Darlington Raceway in Darlington, S.C.

But if it was up to Bubba Wallace, the flags would be completely banned from events. \"My next step would be to get rid of all Confederate flags,\" Wallace told CNN on Monday. So it starts with Confederate flags. \"So there's going to be a lot of angry people that carry those flags proudly, but it's time for change.\"\n\nNASCAR is taking a stand against displaying the Confederate flag.

The company stated definitively that the \"display of the confederate flag will be prohibited from all NASCAR events and properties.\" \"My next step would be to get rid of all Confederate flags,\" Wallace told CNN in an interview Monday.
