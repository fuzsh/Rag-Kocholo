It was during his two-years in management with them that the team was promoted into the First Division, in season 1995-96. It was also Chris who put together most of the team that won Bradford promotion into the Premiership.\n\nChris began commentating in 1996 while he was still a manager, working for Sky Sports and Yorkshire TV. He has also commentated for BBC Radio 5. Having moved on from management, Chriss talent as a presenter and football pundit meant a whole new career opened up for him.\n\nIt was in a dual role of commentator-presenter that Chris initially began his higher profile media career. He linked up with Rob Hawthorne on Friday evenings for live Nationwide football and Rob McCaffrey on Sundays for Soccer Extra.\n\nChris then teamed up again, with Rob, in a new look Goals on Sunday. This review of the previous Saturday’s top-flight action in England and Scotland, also includes high profile studio guests.\n\nThese days Chris Kamara’s weekends are always booked up. He is out and about for his live, ground breaking gantry reports on Premiership matches for Sky’s Soccer Saturday. This is the programme where Chris offers his unique live opinions and reports on matches ,from all over the country.\n\nHe then returns to the Sky Sports studios in London and is set up to present the Sunday morning review show, Goals on Sunday. Chris can also be seen every Saturday morning on Soccer AM where he links live to the stadium he reports from, on Soccer Saturday.\n\nFor the 2010 World Cup, Chris had heard that the word ‘cabanga’ which is derived from the Zulu word for imagine, would have a positive effect if chanted to the England players. After an internet campaign which involved over 20,000 people, he has now decided to change his surname to Cabanga by deed poll. We don’t know yet whether he will change it back or not after the games, probably he’ll make that decision. based on how England performs.\n\nChris is also a very funny after dinner speaker with a unique take on events in the media and sports world."
