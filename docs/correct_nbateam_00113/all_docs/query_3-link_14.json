        "text": "Internationally recognised sports media personality, Chris Kamara is a highly established former footballer who enjoyed an extensive club and management career. A legend of the sport, Kamara is now best known for his media contributions, as a pundit on the likes of Sky Sports and as a presenter on Ninja Warrior UK, bringing the same levels of enthusiasm, energy and expertise to any role. Equally revered for his event appearances, Kamara’s eclectic career makes for an entertaining after dinner talk, and his celebrity appeal guarantees the success of every occasion he attends. A popular choice for a range of demographics, Kamara’s industry status ensures he is engaging for all audiences, whether they are sports fans or not, a truly unique addition to your event.\n\nOver the course of two decades, Kamara dominated the football pitch, gaining an international reputation for his talents as a midfielder. From his debut with Portsmouth Town, having been scouted playing for his Navy team, through to his prolific years with Swindon Town and Brentford making a combined 299 appearances, Kamara achieved legendary status in the game. Winning Swindon Town Player of the Season for his efforts in the 79-80 season, followed by Stock City Player of the Year 1988, Kamara stood out individually for his impressive play, in addition to his success with each team. Having risen to prominence in the late 70s and early 80s, Kamara became a champion at overcoming adversity, the victim of continual racist abuse. Focusing on his ambitions, Kamara was unrelenting in commitment to the sport, a quality which he has seen him hailed an icon.\n\nHaving proven his abilities on the pitch, Kamara briefly transitioned into a managerial career. Taking a leadership position at Bradford and Stoke City, he led the former to become the Football League Second Division Play-off Winner 1996. Evidencing both exemplary leadership and teamwork, Kamara now supports corporate clients in achieving both valuable qualities as a speaker to ensure business success."
