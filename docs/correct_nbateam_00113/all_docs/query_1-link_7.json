        "text": "Jarvis Landry: To participate in Jags' rookie camp\n\nLandry intends to participate in Jacksonville's rookie camp on a tryout basis, Tom Pelissero of NFL Network reports. Landry is full healthy after having sat out the entire 2023 NFL season, as the closest he came to taking the field was a December workout with the Colts. The 31-year-old veteran could be a sensible addition to a Jaguars wide receiver room that lost Calvin Ridley to free agency, while adding rookie Brian Thomas and signing Gabe Davis to join Christian Kirk (groin) and Zay Jones. Across nine games with the Saints in 2022, Landry secured 25 of 39 targets for 272 yards and one touchdown.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nJarvis Landry: Works out for Indy\n\nLandry (ankle) had a tryout with the Colts on Tuesday, Aaron Wilson of KPRC 2 Houston reports. Landry finished the 2022 campaign with an ankle injury and has gone unsigned to this point in 2023, but he now appears healthy. Regardless of whether he ends up striking a deal with the Colts, it appears as if the wide receiver is still committed to making a return to the NFL.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nJarvis Landry: Unsigned one week before camp\n\nLandry (ankle) remains a free agent a week before most NFL teams open training camp, Isaiah Delgado of The Gwinnett Post reports. The 30-year-old slot receiver sunk to 12 games and 570 receiving yards in his final season with the Browns in 2021, before dropping even further (nine games, 272 yards) in 2022 for the Saints. Landry was placed on injured reserve in December and may have had surgery at some point last winter, though no procedure has been reported. If he wants to continue playing, he should at least be able to find a team that'll allow him to compete for slot snaps during training camp.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nSaints' Jarvis Landry: Heads to IR\n\nThe Saints will place Landry (ankle) on injured reserve Thursday, Terrin Waack of The New Orleans Times-Picayune reports. The transaction effectively ends Landry's season, as the Saints will have to advance to the divisional round of the playoffs and the wideout's injury will need to be a relatively short-term concern if he's to have any chance at suiting up in the postseason. Landry had previously missed five consecutive games from Weeks 5 through 9 due to an ankle injury, so he may be dealing with a related setback after playing in each of the Saints' last five contests. Landry handled his second-lowest snap share of the season (35 percent) in this past week's win over the Falcons before failing to practice Wednesday and Thursday and then landing on IR. With Landry out of the mix and with Chris Olave (hamstring) sidelined for at least Saturday's game in Cleveland, the Saints are left with Rashid Shaheed, Tre'Quan Smith and Marquez Callaway as their lone healthy receivers on the 53-man roster.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nSaints' Jarvis Landry: Doesn't practice Wednesday\n\nLandry was a non-participant at Wednesday's practice due to an ankle issue. Landry is making a mid-week appearance on the Saints' Week 16 injury report, but he has dealt with an ankle injury for a good portion of the campaign, so his absence Wednesday may be maintenance-related. Thursday's report may provide a clearer picture of his availability ahead of Saturday's game in Cleveland.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nSaints' Jarvis Landry: Non-factor in win\n\nLandry did not haul in his lone target during Sunday's 21-18 victory over Atlanta. Landry did not haul in a catch for the first time this season, as he logged season lows in targets and offensive snaps (19). The veteran still served as the Saints' No. 3 receiver in terms of snaps behind Rashid Shaheed (39) and Chris Olave (27) and just ahead of Tre'Quan Smith (18) and Marquez Callaway (nine). While Landry was one of only three New Orleans wideouts to be targeted Sunday, his strict usage in the short and intermediate parts of the field severely handicaps his fantasy potential over the final three games of the regular season.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nSaints' Jarvis Landry: Two catches in MNF\n\nLandry notched two receptions on three targets for 14 yards during Monday's 17-16 loss to the Buccaneers. Landry continues to play a minimal role for New Orleans, as all three of his targets came on passes of fewer than 10 yards -- including a bad drop late in the second quarter when he attempted to bring a ball in with one hand, resulting in a failed third-down conversion in the red zone. Landry also tied with running back Alvin Kamara, tight end Adam Trautman and Swiss Army knife Taysom Hill for fourth on the team in targets. The slot wideout's lack of downfield opportunities, combined with this log jam of short-yardage options, will keep Landry's upside limited.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nSaints' Jarvis Landry: Cleared for Monday\n\nLandry (ankle) does not carry an injury designation into Monday's contest against the Buccaneers, Katherine Terrell of ESPN.com reports. This has been the typical practice cadence for the veteran since he injured his ankle back in Week 5. Landry has done next to nothing over the past three weeks with the Saints' offense limited in many facets, resulting in just eight total receptions for 90 yards and a touchdown since making his return in Week 10.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nSaints' Jarvis Landry: Limited in practice, per usual\n\nLandry (ankle) was a limited practice participant Friday. Limited participation has been the norm since Landry missed Weeks 5-9 with an ankle injury. He's played in three straight games but caught only eight passes for 90 yards and a TD on 14 targets, landing in the range of 55-to-78 percent snap share each of the past three weeks. Landry figures to suit up for Monday's game in Tampa Bay even if the ankle issue is something he can't entirely shake this year.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nSaints' Jarvis Landry: Begins week as limited\n\nLandry (ankle) practiced in a limited capacity Thursday. Since sitting out Weeks 5-9 due to an ankle injury, Landry has suited up for each of the Saints' last three games, putting together an 8-90-1 line on 14 targets. The production isn't overly impressive considering his snap share ranged from 55 to 78 percent for those contests. Having said that, assuming he's able to play through the pain Monday in Tampa Bay, Landry again will serve as New Orleans' No. 2 wide receiver behind rookie Chris Olave.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nSaints' Jarvis Landry: Limited role in loss\n\nLandry had two receptions on four targets for 20 yards during Sunday's 13-0 loss to the 49ers. Landry accumulated his second-fewest yards of the season during yet another poor performance by New Orleans' offense. The slot receiver finished third on the team in targets behind Chris Olave (nine) and running back Alvin Kamara (seven), who appeared to be dealing with an undisclosed injury by the end of the game. Landry also didn't see many scoring chances, logging a single target on one of the Saints' two red-zone trips. Depending on Kamara's status, the veteran wideout could see more short-yardage work in next week's divisional matchup versus Tampa Bay on Monday Night Football.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nSaints' Jarvis Landry: Good to go\n\nLandry (ankle) doesn't have an injury designation for Sunday's game at San Francisco. Landry will suit up for a third straight game after missing Weeks 5 through 9 with an ankle injury. Chris Olave is established as the team's No. 1 receiver now, but Landry has an opportunity to solidify himself as the No. 2 option, having caught seven of 10 targets for 70 yards and a touchdown over two games since his month-long absence. He played more than half the snaps on offense in both games and likely will do the same this Sunday against the Niners.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nSaints' Jarvis Landry: Logs limited work Thursday\n\nLandry (ankle) was listed as limited on Thursday's injury report, Nick Underhill of NewOrleans.Football reports. Since sitting out Weeks 5-9 due to an ankle injury, Landry has been impacted by it during preparation for the Saints' last two games and now another one. Over those pair of appearances, he reeled in six of 10 targets for 70 yards, but he salvaged that meager production with a touchdown this past Sunday against the Rams. Landry will look to get rid of his injury designation for the third week in a row Friday.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nSaints' Jarvis Landry: Limited in practice still\n\nLandry (ankle) was a limited participant in Wednesday's practice. The ankle injury that cost him more than a month earlier this season continues to affect Landry's practice participation even after he played in both of the past two games. He's caught six of 10 targets for 70 yards and a touchdown since returning, with snap shares of 79 percent (Week 10) and 56 percent (Week 11). Landry should be able to play this Sunday in San Francisco against a tough defense.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nSaints' Jarvis Landry: Catches first touchdown of 2022\n\nLandry totaled three receptions (on four targets) for 33 yards and one touchdown during Sunday's 27-20 victory versus the Rams. Landry finally broke his scoring drought this season, catching a seven-yard touchdown from quarterback Andy Dalton, who went 21-for-25 passing for 260 yards and three touchdowns Sunday. Aside from an outlier 100-yard performance in Week 1, the wideout has averaged 4.4 targets and 24.8 receiving yards over his other six games this season. However, if Dalton can maintain this highly efficient form moving forward, Landry could continue to serve as a consistent short-yardage scoring threat in the Saints' largely limited offense.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nSaints' Jarvis Landry: Ready to play\n\nLandry (ankle) doesn't have an injury designation for Sunday's game against the Rams. Landry returned last week after missing more than a month with the ankle injury, catching three of six targets for 37 yards in a 20-10 loss to the Steelers. He played 79 percent of snaps his first game back and figures to be on the field for most of the Saints' plays Sunday if he can avoid setbacks with the ankle. He's been a limited practice participant ever since returning.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nSaints' Jarvis Landry: Still limited Thursday\n\nLandry (ankle) was a limited practice participant Thursday, Katherine Terrell of ESPN.com reports. Returning from a five-game absence this past Sunday at Pittsburgh, Landry recorded three catches (on six targets) for 37 yards on a 78 percent share of the snaps. Still, he carried his ankle injury into a new week and has been held back both Wednesday and Thursday. Landry has one more chance to rid himself of an injury designation ahead of Sunday's contest versus the Rams.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nSaints' Jarvis Landry: Limited with ankle issue\n\nLandry (ankle) was a limited participant in Wednesday's practice. Landry missed five straight games with the ankle injury before returning to action for last Sunday's 20-10 loss to the Steelers and finishing with three receptions for 37 yards on six targets. With no reports of a setback, he'll likely be able to play again this Sunday against the Rams.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nSaints' Jarvis Landry: Three catches in return\n\nLandry recorded three receptions on six targets for 37 yards in Sunday's 20-10 loss to the Steelers. Landry returned from a five-game absence caused by a groin injury, and he immediately finished second on the team with six targets. He worked his typical role in the short areas of the field, tallying receptions of 17, 11 and nine yards. Landry has had minimal production in the Saints' offense through five games, recording 18 receptions for 205 yards.\n\n... See More ... See Less"
