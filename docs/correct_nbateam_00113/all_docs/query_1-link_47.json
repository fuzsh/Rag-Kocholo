        "text": "Featured\n\nFirst Impressions of Marcus Freeman\n\nby Matt Siriani\n\nNotre Dame is one of the winningest and most prestigious college football programs in the country. The 133-year history behind the Fighting Irish has prided itself to be a winning culture. Despite being an independent university, Notre Dame has had just 29 men step up and take control of the job as head coach of the Fighting Irish. Well as of yesterday, that number changed to 30, as former defensive coordinator for the Irish Marcus Freeman is now taking over to do the one thing he wants to do: “Take this program to the next level.”\n\nNow for those of you who are unaware of Marcus Freeman, let me give you a sample of what he has done in the college landscape. At 35 years old, Freeman will become one of the youngest head coaches in college football. However, before becoming a coach, he played football at the University of Ohio State where he was a two-time second-team all Big Ten selection as a linebacker for the Buckeyes. After his college playing days were up due to a medical condition, he got his first coaching job as a graduate assistant at his Alma Mater in 2010.\n\nFreeman continued his coaching career at Kent State, where he served as the Linebackers coach from 2011-12. He then served the same role at Purdue university from 2013-15. In 2016, he was promoted to defensive coordinator.\n\nHowever, it was in Cincinnati, where Freeman started to find success. He was the Bearcats defensive coordinator from 2017-20. In his first year as defensive coordinator, Freeman’s defense gave up 31.8 points per game, However in his second season at the position, that number improved to 17.2 points per game allowed, which was good for eighth best in the country. Freeman’s defense continued to be ranked in the top ten throughout the 2019 and 2020 seasons. In the latter year, he had the distinction of being named the Defensive Coordinator of the Year by 247 sports. That same year, he was nominated for the Broyles Award, which is given to the best assistant coach in the country.\n\nAfter a quick turnaround at Cincinnati, then-Notre Dame head coach Brian Kelly hired Freeman to be his defensive coordinator for the 2021 season. Truth be told, Notre Dame’s defense was not entirely impressive under Freeman to begin the season, as the defense gave up 38 points to Florida State in their season opener, 29 points to Toledo the next week, 29 points to Virginia Tech, and 34 points to North Carolina. However, in the final four weeks of the season, Notre Dame’s defense harrassed opposing offenses. The Fighting Irish defense gave up just 23 points combined in their final four games which included a 55-0 shutout over Georgia Tech.\n\nThings took a turn for the Fighting Irish after their season finale at Stanford as Brian Kelly fled South Bend, Indiana for Baton Rouge in Louisiana to become the head coach of the LSU Tigers. Freeman was considered a top candidate to fill the void at head coach, however, according to Notre Dame alum James Sorrentino, there were other options for Freeman.\n\n“He was bound to get offers from other schools soon.” Sorrentino said continuing “Even Brian Kelly was trying to bring him to LSU.”\n\nIt was a classy move by Notre Dame to hire from within the program as it would have been tough to snatch candidates from conferenced schools who were serving as coordinators. On top of promoting Freeman, Notre Dame will also retain former Notre Dame quarterback and current offensive coordinator Tommy Rees. What one Freeman the job was his ability to connect with the players and win their trust. On Friday, when Freeman was introduced as the next head coach, the players were clearly excited about this. Although, they asked for it when a movement on Twitter was started with Fighting Irish Players tweeting with the hashtag #FreemanEra.\n\nNotre Dame has been one of the most aggressive schools in the country when it comes to recruiting. In fact, this year Notre Dame is top five in recruiting for the first time in eight years and part of that is due to Freeman’s leadership on the recruiting trail this past year.\n\nMarcus Freeman has been seen as a players coach according to those who were under his tutelage at Cincinnati and Notre Dame. He also seems to be all in with supporting Notre Dame from the ground up. He’s even gone as far as attending a game for the Notre Dame hockey team to show off his Irish pride. Freeman will have a tough task ahead of him, while recruiting at Notre Dame will be more aggressive and more successful under Freeman. When talking about what’s ahead of the 35-year old Dayton, Ohio native James Sorrentino said the following:\n\n“Being the head coach at Notre Dame is like being a CEO due to the many responsibilities. He (Marcus Freeman) obviously has to be a great recruiter, but he has to be the face of the program to the alumni, donors, former players, and the demanding fan base. That’s a lot of work for a young guy to absorb, but I trust that the Athletic Director (Jack Swarbrick) will help him grow into the job.”\n\nMarcus Freeman has said that he wants to take Notre Dame to the next level, and I think that while he is absolutely deserving of the job, there will be growing pains that come with the position of being head coach and the ability to compete with schools like Michigan, Alabama, Ohio State, and Cincinnati among other schools will be a challenge in its own right. Notre Dame has not won a National Title since 1988 but can will things change under Freeman’s leadership? We will have to see.\n\nFeatured\n\nMain Games to watch for in NFL Week 3\n\nby Matt Siriani\n\nWe are still in the early stages of the 2021 NFL season. However, Week 3 promises to be an interesting week in regards to action. For all of you bettors out there looking for some enticing wagers to place your money on, here are some picks just for you.\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens have finally got one over their “Kryptonite” this past Sunday night, and now they face a Detroit Lions team in the Motor City in what should be a lopsided matchup. Despite the lack of excitement for this game, I think its a perfect opportunity to place two wagers on it to see where you land: The first wager involves the line. Baltimore is favored to win by 7.5 points, which is too small in my humble opinion considering the talent level that both of these teams are on. Yes, the Detroit Lions can give a competitive effort, but they always end up falling flat towards the end of games. I like the Ravens blowing out the Detroit Lions especially because the league still hasn’t been able to figure out Lamar Jackson just yet and the Ravens running game is still good despite the plethora of running backs that Baltimore uses to combat the injury problems with J.K. Dobbins and Gus Edwards.\n\nthe second wager that I like is the over. The over is 50 points and even though the sample size is small, both the Ravens and Lions have gone over in their two respective matchups so far this season. My final prediction is a blowout in Detroit as the Ravens are the clear superior team and Detroit is looking to make it through 17 games as best as they possibly could.\n\nPrediction:\n\nOver 50 points\n\nBaltimore -7.5\n\nFinal score Ravens 37- Lions 14\n\nDerrick Henry looked like himself again as he carried the ball 35 times for 182 yards and 3 touchdowns against the Seattle Seahawks last week in a huge road win. The Indianapolis Colts, look like they are not going to have their starting quarterback under center this weekend as he is dealing with an ankle injury in after what has been a series of beatings taken over the first two weeks of the season. If Wentz doesn’t go on Sunday, it will be backup Jacob Eason lining up under center to take on the Titans.\n\nIn terms of betting on this game, I’d go the same route as I am doing with the Ravens-Lions game except instead of going over 48, I would go under. The Tennessee Titans are a ground and pound football team and the Colts are not so stellar offensively. That being said, I think the Titans will win this game if Carson Wentz doesn’t play because of the lack of experience under Jacob Eason’s belt would be the downfall for the Colts in this game. I think this game will be comfortably won by the Titans and the game will be comfortably under.\n\nPredictions\n\nTitans 24 – Colts 14\n\nUnder 48\n\nTitans -5.5\n\nIn a battle of unbeatens, one must go down unfortunately, and the reason II say that is because you can’t help but appreciate what the Rams and Bucs have done so far this season. We are finally seeing Matthew Stafford play great football on a competent team and Tom Brady continues to define logic with his age and playing professional football at a high level past the age of 40 (Brady is 44 and leads the NFL in Touchdown passes with 9).\n\nUsually bettors wouldn’t touch a game like this because it is too close to call. Despite that, I’m gonna dabble some dollars on the Rams +1 for two reasons: it’s in L.A. and Tom Brady has been blessed with home field the first two games of the year, and that the Buccaneers might be without Antonio Brown in this game after he tested positive for COVID on Wednesday as well as an injury to Linebacker Jason Pierre-Paul could leave the Bucs in shape to take a loss even though some have them going undefeated this season. I would also go with the over in this game, a 55.5 point under/over is really high, but I can guarantee you that this game will be an aerial display between two offenses that know how to air it out and are very good at scoring points as well. It is also worth noting that again these are two teams who are 2-0 in going over, again small sample size but a stat to keep an eye on. Both teams will be put in a battle which I think the Rams will win as they seem more determined in my eyes. However, that doesn’t mean it will be the end of the war between L.A.’s finest and the defending Super Bowl Champs.\n\nPredictions:\n\nRams 30 – Buccaneers 27\n\nOver 55.5 points\n\nRams +1\n\nFeatured\n\nThe Champs stand Tall\n\nby Matt Siriani\n\nLast night, the 2021 NFL season kicked off in the same location where last season ended: Raymond James Stadium, home of the defending Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers. As is tradition, the champs opened the season but this time, to a full capacity crowd. Stepping up to face the champions, the Dallas Cowboys “America’s Team”, rejuvenated after a disappointing season in 2020 but looked to change their fortunes. September 9th marked the first of 272 games for the NFL regular season, and Game #1 could easily go down as an instant classic.\n\nThe game started off slow with punts on both teams opening drives. However, it was the Bucs who started the scoring with a 9-play 94 yard drive. All culminating in a 5-yard touchdown pass from 22-year NFL veteran Quarterback Tom Brady to fifth-year Wide Receiver Chris Godwin. Dallas would respond back with a touchdown of their own. During the drive, Dallas Cowboys Quarterback Dak Prescott slung the ball left, right, and center with precision. Prescott capped off the touchdown drive with a touchdown strike to Wide Receiver CeeDee Lamb to tie the score at 7, and concluding the scoring in the first quarter.\n\nAfter a couple of more punts, the Bucs took the lead on a touchdown drive that saw Tom Brady hook up with Tight End Rob Gronkowski for a score and marking the 99th touchdown for the dynamic duo throughout their careers together (regular season and playoffs combined). Dallas tried to respond back, but veteran kicker Greg Zuerlin missed a 31-yard field goal leaving Dallas to come away with nothing. However, the Cowboys got the ball right back as Bucs backup Running Back Ronald Jones fumbled the ball on the first play of the defending champs next possession. Dallas would capitalize with a 27-yard drive that ended with Prescott throwing his second of three touchdown passes, this one to Wide Receiver Amari Cooper. However, the Bucs retained the lead after Zuerlin missed the extra point, making the score 14-13 in favor of the Bucs.\n\nThe Cowboys would take the lead as the Bucs turned the ball over on a screen pass that went off the hands of Running Back Leonard Fournette was tipped and intercepted in Bucs territory. Dallas would kick a field goal making the score 16-14. However, Tom Brady would connect on a 47-yard bomb to Antonio Brown giving Brady his third touchdown pass of the game, and giving the Bucs a 21-16 lead at halftime.\n\nTom Brady at age 44 showed no signs of slowing down in this game, completing 64% of his passes for 379 yards and 4 touchdowns. On the other side of the coin, Dak Prescott (who was playing in his first NFL game since October 11th) picked up right where he left off last season completing 42 of 58 passes for 403 yards and 3 touchdowns. On the receiving end for the Cowboys, Amari Cooper led the way with 13 catches for 139 yards and 2 touchdowns. For the Bucs, Tight End Rob Gronkowski had 8 catches for 90 yards and 2 scores, Chris Godwin had 9 catches for 105 yards and a touchdown, and Antonio Brown had 5 catches for 121 yards and a touchdown.\n\nThe second half started with the Cowboys kicking a field goal and chipping the lead to 2. However, the next time Dallas got the ball, Prescott threw an interception on a pass that should’ve been caught by CeeDee Lamb. Tampa would take advantage as Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski connected for the second time in the game for a score, bumping the lead up to a 28-19 margin. Dallas would respond back with a 75-yard touchdown drive that ended with a 21-yard touchdown pass from Prescott to Amari Cooper, making it a 2-point game once again.\n\nLate in the fourth quarter, Tampa tried to put the game away but after catching a pass, Bucs receiver Chris Godwin coughed up the ball before reaching the end zone and Dallas recovered it. The Cowboys were able to kick a 48-yard field goal to take the lead 29-28. However, there was one error that the Cowboys made: they gave Tom Brady too much time; a minute and twenty-four seconds to be exact.\n\nTom Brady would use his time wisely, picking apart the Cowboys secondary before finishing them off with a 24-yard strike to Chris Godwin which put the Bucs at the Dallas 18-yard line. Bucs Kicker Ryan Succop would kick a 35-yard field goal that split the uprights and gave the Bucs the opening day victory 31-29.\n\nAfter the game, Brady said that the Bucs have a lot of work that needs to be done, but that it was a great win nonetheless. Brady made history in this game. He started his 300th regular season game, and became the second quarterback to win a game at the age of 44. While the Dallas Cowboys lost this game, they have a lot of positive vibes coming out of it, given the way their star players performed on offense and that they proved that they could go toe to toe with the defending Super Bowl champs. Next week, the Dallas Cowboys (0-1) will face the Los Angeles Chargers, while the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (1-0) will face the Atlanta Falcons next week.\n\nFeatured\n\nDouble Trouble\n\nBy Matt Siriani\n\nToday, the New York Yankees (66-52; 3rd in the AL East) walk into their stadium with a chance to make a move into the wild card spots as they take on their biggest rivals the Boston Red Sox (69-51; 2nd in the AL East) in an all-important double header in the Bronx.\n\nAfter the Yanks narrow win over the Angels last night, the Yanks could officially close the two game gap between them and the Red Sox and continue their late season surge that they have been on since the conclusion of the All-Star break. The Yanks are 20-9 since the All-star break and seem to have all the momentum since acquiring outfielder Joey Gallo and first baseman Anthony Rizzo. Despite the positive energy, the Yanks have had a hard time beating Boston this year, which is a coincidence considering the bombers dominated their rivals winning nine of ten game last year in a shortened 2020 season.\n\nIn Game one, starting for the Red Sox will be Tanner Houck (0-3 2.93 ERA). His last start came on August 12th where he gave up six hits and three earned runs in five innings as Houck suffered his third loss of the season in an 8-1 reckoning of the AL East leading Tampa Bay Rays. Starting for the Yankees will be Jordan Montgomery (4-5 3.69 ERA). Montgomery has had an up and down year. His last start came on August 1st in a 3-1 win over the Marlins where Montgomery wasn’t involved in the decision. However, in that game he pitched five innings, giving up four hits and a single run as well as walking one batter.\n\nMontgomery has to be sharp today in order for the Yankees to have a chance at winning today. In a seven inning game, the pressure is shifted off of you a little bit due to the fact that you might not be able to pitch as long as you are normally capable of. That being said, Montgomery has had outings where he has struggled to begin games which would result in eventual losses. Houck has to be consistent as well for the Red Sox. In addition, the Red Sox have to provide run support for Hocuk. The Red Sox have a .260 batting average as a team, which is the third highest in Major League Baseball.\n\nThe Money line for this first game is the Red Sox -150 and the under and over being at 7 runs. Because these are two pitchers that ae capable of getting banged around, I would go for the over in this situation, especially given that Jordan Montgomery will be making his first start since coming off the COVID list, you have no idea what you are going to get out of him. Game one can be seen on the YES Network at 1:00 pm.\n\nIn game two, the starters will be Nathan Eovaldi (10-7 3.92 ERA) for the Red Sox, and rookie Luis Gil (1-0 0.00 ERA) for the Yankees. Nathan Eovaldi has had a decent year so far this season which says a lot given that Boston doesn’t have a lot of star studded players on the mound for them this year. Eovaldi’s last start came against the Rays on August 11th in which the Red Sox smacked the Rays 20-8. In that game, he pitched seven innings, giving up just three hits and one run to notch his tenth win of the season. Luis Gil is only pitching in his third game this season and so far, he has looked good. In the two games that Gil has pitched in so far, he hasn’t given up a run, struck out 14 batters, allowed six hits, and only walked three batters.\n\nOverall, the experience edge goes to Nathan Eovaldi, who is due for a big game as Boston is in a desperate situation right now to keep winning. However, people have really liked what they have seen from Luis Gil so far despite the sample size being so small to come to a conclusion of whether he is a capable starter or not.\n\nThe Money Line for game two is Boston -135 and the under and over is 6.5 runs. I feel like while game one has the potential to be an offensive shootout, game two has the potential to be a pitchers duel between the veteran (Eovaldi) and the upstart (Gil). Game two can be seen on the YES Network at 7:00pm.\n\nFeatured\n\nIs this Heaven?\n\nBy Matt Siriani\n\nRemember the classic baseball movie Field of Dreams? Well, for the first time ever; Major League Baseball presented a game inspired by that very film. The overall presentation provided a sense of nostalgia with an old-school intro, cornfields, clips of the movie, and Kevin Costner coming out saying “Is this Heaven?”\n\nWalking out of the cornfields to participate in this game were the Chicago White Sox and the New York Yankees. Two teams with different paths. The upstart Chicago White Sox (68-48; 1st in AL Central) are leading their division (The AL Central) by a whopping 10 games led by hall of fame manager Tony La Russa. Meanwhile, the New York Yankees (63-52; 3rd in AL East) were playing for a wild card berth as they came into this game just a game and a half back of their rivals the Boston Red Sox for that second wild card spot. Led by Aaron Boone, the team began their season on a disappointing 6-11 mark, but have kept themselves in position for the postseason with a late season surge and key trade acquisitions Joey Gallo and Anthony Rizzo.\n\nUnfortunately for the Bronx Bombers, they had a number of players out due to COVID protocols like starting pitcher Gerrit Cole, catcher Gary Sanchez, and the aforementioned first baseman Anthony Rizzo. Despite the absences, there was still a game to be played and the question would be would people come to see this game, and the answer was yes. People did come.\n\nThe first inning saw both teams each accumulate a single hit. For the Yanks, it was a leadoff single by DJ Lemahieu, but that was followed by three straight outs. For the White Sox, their lone hit was a home run by defending AL MVP Jose Abreu, giving the Sox an early 1-0 lead. After a scoreless second inning, the Yankees took the lead in the top of the third inning off a three-run home run by Outfielder Aaron Judge to make the game a 3-1 contest. However, the White Sox took back the lead in the bottom of the third by scoring four runs: an RBI double by Shortstop Tim Anderson, and a three-run home run by Left outfielder Eloy Jimenez. The White Sox took a 5-3 lead.\n\nIn the bottom of the fourth inning, the White Sox doubled their lead from two runs to four thanks to yet another Sox home run by Catcher Seby Zavala making the score 7-3.\n\nThe pitchers for this game were Lance Lynn for the White Sox and Andrew Heaney for the Yankees. Lynn pitched five innings and gave up four runs, walked two batters, and struck out seven in 105 pitches. Andrew Heaney filled in for Gerrit Cole and had a rough outing all things considered. Like his adversary for the game, Heaney also pitched five innings, but gave up seven runs, walked three batters, and accumulated five strikeouts in just 77 pitches.\n\nFast forward to the sixth inning, The Yankees chipped at the lead with a solo home run by veteran Centerfielder Brett Gardner. Despite that, the Yanks missed on an opportunity to do more damage. Following the Gardner home run, Aaron Judge and Joey Gallo were in scoring position with one man out. The White Sox made a pitching change and brought in Michael Kopech, who struck out Luke Voit and Rougned Odor to get out of a jam and limit the damage to just a single run and keep the game at 7-4 White Sox.\n\nThe game became an instant classic in the ninth inning. The Yankees were down to their last chance to win the game. At first things didn’t look good with the Bombers facing Liam Hendriks. After a leadoff single by Tyler Wade, DJ Lemahieu and Brett Gardner struck out, leaving the Yankees down to their final out. Outfielder Aaron Judge had a big game in Iowa as he hit his second home run of the game; a 429-foot two-run home run. This put the Yankees within 1. Following the Home Run, Leftfielder Joey Gallo worked a walk, setting the stage for Designated Hitter Giancarlo Stanton who hit a two-run home run to give the Yankees a late lead 8-7. After the rally ended with a strikeout by Luke Voit, now it was the White Sox who were down to their last chance.\n\nThe White Sox ended the game in style. Seby Zavala worked a walk with one man out, then the next batter Tim Anderson hit a walk-off home run to give the White Sox a 9-8 victory in Dyersville, and improving their record to 68-48. The Yankees dropped to 63-52 and are now a full two games back of the Boston Red Sox for that second wild card spot. Both teams will be off today as they travel to Chicago to play the rest of the series their. On the bright side, it was safe to say that the highly anticipated Field of Dreams game from an overall play standpoint to television presentation exceeded all expectations and will hopefully become a staple on the Major League schedule for years to come.\n\nFeatured\n\nStandout Athletes from Team USA\n\nBy Matt Siriani\n\nThe 32nd edition of the Summer Olympics have concluded. After 16 intense days of blood, sweat, and tears in many competitions for over 50,000 athletes worldwide, it was Team USA who came out on top for the 3rd Olympics in a row.\n\nWhile the U.S. led the way in overall medals with 113, they barely beat China in total gold medals 39-38. According to Siriani Says Sports and several other sources; the country with the most gold medals is the overall Olympic Champion. The United States had to work hard for every single one of those $810 gold medals. While there were some highs and lows throughout the entire event, the highs that energized Team USA came from 5 people who stood out from the rest of America’s top athletes.\n\n5. Suni Lee\n\nWe start this list off with an absolute stunner. In Gymnastics, superstar gymnast Simone Biles suffered from a case of the “twisties” and really didn’t compete for much of the Olympics. The news came just a couple days before the individual all-around competition in which Simone was ranked the #1 gymnast in the world. The U.S. gymnastics team shined through Simone so the question became: Who was going to step up from the pack and perform? The answer came from an 18-year old girl from St. Paul, Minnesota.\n\nSuni Lee was making her Olympic debut and had all the pressure on her shoulders trying to take home gold for the highly touted Women’s gymnastics team. Despite that, she performed at a level none of us thought she could reach scoring a 13.7 on the floor routine to clinch the gold medal. Before that, she was able to score a 13.833 on the beam, 15.3 on the uneven bars, and a 14.6 on the vault. The victory made Lee just the sixth U.S. woman to win the all-around event, and the first Asian Champion of any nationality.\n\n4. April Ross and Alix Klineman\n\nAlix Klineman and April Ross were the most impressive duo I have ever seen. Their chemistry made for a dominant team on the sand. They only lost 1 set throughout prelims and the tournament combined. They outscored their opponents by 75 points in the 15 sets that they played averaging a 5 point win per set. They were an aggressive offensive juggernaut with Ross setting up Klineman for the kills almost every single time, while Ross was solid on the serving end. Their spot on this list also signifies when the U.S. started to turn a corner in the gold medal tally and it all started when the two California natives stepped on the sand in the championship game and dominated Australia, leading by as much as 9 on both sets before settling for 6 and 5 point victories respectively. On the court and off the court, the two bonded and shared many hugs throughout the tournament which made for an exciting but also entertaining unit to watch.\n\n3. Xander Schauffele\n\nI stayed up till 3:15 in the morning to watch this man win the Olympic Gold Medal on the final day of the men’s tournament, and believe me it was not an easy ride. He had a three stroke heading into the 11th hole of the final round, and it almost fell away from him. On the 12th and 13th holes, Schauffele settled for par while elsewhere on the 17th and 18th hole, Rory Sabbatini closed it out with back to back birdies. Then on the fourteenth hole, disaster struck when Xander hit the ball into the woods and lost his ball as well as a shot, settling for Bogey to tie him with Sabbatini at 17 under par for the tournament.\n\nDespite the fear that the Americans could let this one slip through their fingertips, Schauffele responded in a steady way by parring on the 15th and 16th holes, and hit a clutch birdie putt on the 17th hole to put him back up by one stroke. Then on the eighteenth hole, Schauffele drove the ball from an unfavorable angle on his second shot on a par 4 to get it in position for par and clinch the gold medal. The four-time PGA tour winner earned his spot on this list for two reasons, the first being his putting came up big in huge moments, and the second being his patience and composure was solid throughout the entire event no matter what was going on. Many could argue that an Olympic gold medal could set up the San Diego native for his first major PGA tour win down the line.\n\n2. Kevin Durant\n\nIt’s no secret that many analysts believe that the greatest basketball player on the planet right now is Kevin Durant. If you don’t believe that is true, then you haven’t been watching enough of his games. Durant had a tremendous playoff series with the Brooklyn Nets vs the eventual NBA champion Milwaukee Bucks. He followed up his superb summer by carrying a subpar U.S. Men’s Basketball team to gold through his execution on the court as a player and as the team’s leader. Out of the 12 players on the Men’s basketball roster, only Durant and Draymond Green were previous Olympians. Throughout prelims and tournament play, Kevin Durant averaged 20.7 PPG which is impressive considering that the defense in Olympic play is more difficult than in the NBA.\n\nDurant showed up to play in the knockout rounds, scoring 81 points across three playoff games, and leading the U.S. in scoring each game. He had 29 points vs Spain in the Quarterfinals, 23 points in the Semifinals vs Australia, and another 29 points vs France in the championship game in the face of the NBA’s Defensive Player of the Year in Rudy Goebert. Recently it was also reported that Kevin Durant had signed a four-year contract extension with the Brooklyn Nets worth $198 Million. All Kevin Durant needs to wrap up the resume as possibly one of the greatest players to ever play the sport of basketball, is a third NBA championship to go with three Olympic gold medal.\n\nCaeleb Dressel\n\n5 Gold Medals in one Olympics has only been done by three other Olympic Swimmers from the United States. Following in the footsteps of Michael Phelps is honestly one of the toughest acts to follow. However, what Caeleb Dressel accomplished in the pool is the stuff of legend. The Green Cove Springs native won gold medals in the 50 meter freestyle, the 100 meter freestyle, the 100 meter butterfly, the 4×100 meter freestyle, and the 4×100 meter medley. He set Olympic records in the 50 meter and 100 meter freestyle, and World records in the 100 meter butterfly and the 4×100 meter medley.\n\nCaeleb Dressel earns number one on this list not just for the quantity of medals he has won but the quality in which he has won them left everyone on the edge of their seats. In the 100 meter freestyle, he won his first solo gold medal by just six hundredths of a second, in the 4×100 meter medley, Dressel showed blazing speed in the pool on his leg of the race to help the men’s team go 15-0 all time in that race.\n\nIn closing, while this year’s Olympics has been memorable for controversial reasons, the event was successfully received by fans watching at home and was entertaining throughout. The Olympics is responsible for creating legends and that certainly happened as the lives of these Americans have been changed forever. It will be interesting to see what happens in three years time to see who the next big names will be for the United States. However, in 2021 the country along with the names on this list stand before the world as Olympic Champions and with many memorable moments to show for their hard work and accomplishments.\n\nFeatured\n\nWhat a championship would mean to the Cleveland Browns\n\nBy Matt Siriani\n\nFollowing one of the most improbable wins in recent memory, the Cleveland Browns won their first playoff game in 26 years last Sunday against the Pittsburgh Steelers. A long time coming for a franchise that many people thought would never rise from the ashes. But lord behold, the Cleveland Browns are on the cusp of potentially appearing in their first Super Bowl.\n\nNow of course, they would have to dethrone the defending champion Kansas City Chiefs to continue those aspirations. But just imagine what a miracle run to a Super Bowl trophy would bring to a franchise and a city known for being “lovable losers”\n\nBack in the late 1940’s to early 1950’s, the Cleveland Browns were the class of pro football. Winning 7 championships in just their first 10 seasons as a franchise from 1946-55. After winning their last championship in 1964, the Browns have had the mystique stripped away from them through a series of misfortunes.\n\nRed Right 88: the Cleveland Browns in 1980 were known as the Cardiac Kids, a team that won games in dramatic fashion. The team went 12-4 in 1980 and were the top seed in the AFC. However, in a divisional playoff game against the Oakland Raiders, Head Coach Sam Rutigliano decided to go for a touchdown instead of a chip shot field goal trailing 14-12.\n\nRutigliano called “Red Right 88” a play that was for Tight End Ozzie Newsome. When Browns Quarterback Brian Sipe threw over the middle, he was intercepted by Raiders defensive back Mike Davis (a man who couldn’t catch a pass even if he tried) ending the Cardiac Kids season in heart breaking fashion.\n\nThe Drive: In 1986, the Cleveland Browns made it to the AFC Championship game, taking on the Denver Broncos, and it looked like they were on the cusp of appearing in their first Super Bowl as they were up 20-13 late in the fourth quarter, and the Broncos last drive of regulation started at the 2-yard line. However, Broncos quarterback John Elway orchestrated a fifteen-play 98-yard touchdown drive to the tie the game at 20. Denver would win the game in overtime with a field goal, silencing Browns fans at Cleveland stadium in a 23-20 defeat.\n\nThe Fumble: the rematch between the Broncos and Browns in the following year’s AFC championship game featured a lot more offense, particularly from Browns running back Earnest Byner. Byner was a force to be reckoned with as both a runner and a pass catcher.\n\nLate in the fourth quarter, the Browns were trailing 38-31 and driving for the game tying touchdown deep inside Broncos territory. Byner got the hand off and got inside the 2-yard line but fumbled the ball leading to a Broncos recovery. A crushing defeat for a man who played his heart out for nearly 60 minutes.\n\nThe Move: The Browns in the early 1990’s were coached by Bill Belichek and were trending in the right direction. After winning 11 regular season games and a playoff game in 1994, the Browns were poised to make a run at the Lombardi trophy in 1995. However, it wasn’t meant to be. After starting the ‘95 season 3-1, then-owner Art Modell dropped a bombshell and announced that the Cleveland Browns would be moving to Baltimore. The fan base was understandably angry at the announcement and emotions boiled over as the season progressed. At season’s end, the Cleveland Browns were repackaged as the Baltimore Ravens, and the city of Cleveland wouldn’t have a pro football team for the next three years.\n\nThe “failed” comeback: the Browns returned in 1999. Despite that, they have had little to no success since their resurrection. Prior to 2020, the Browns only had one season where they won 10 games or more, and only one playoff appearance since returning to the NFL. Even worse, since then they became the 2nd team in NFL history to go winless in a 16-game season back in 2017, the year before they went an atrocious 1-15.\n\nWhat’s going on in other sports: While Cleveland’s professional football team seems to be the center of attention, it’s worth noting that both their basketball and baseball teams are not fairing any better.\n\nCleveland Cavaliers: while the Cleveland Cavaliers did win the NBA Finals back in 2016 and were perennial eastern conference champions during the middle portion of the 2010s, their star player LeBron James left his hometown team to go to Los Angeles and play with the Lakers. This sunk the Cavaliers back into mediocrity once again. If you take away LeBron James from Cavalier history, the team’s history is pretty bleak and their overall win-loss tally since coming to the NBA in 1970 is at 1986-2265.\n\nCleveland Indians: The Indians have been struggling to win their first World Series since 1948 (the longest active World Series drought). They recently traded away all-star shortstop Francisco Lindor to the Mets, taking them a step back from championship contention. The Indians were on the losing end of four World Series championships in 1954, 1995, 1997, and 2016 since last hoisting up the World Series trophy.\n\nIn the 2016 World Series, the Indians were up 3-1 on the Chicago Cubs, but when they had a chance to clinch the series, they lost the final three games, and instead were watching the Cubs celebrate their over 100-year drought come to an end.\n\nCurrently, the Cleveland Indians are facing controversy over their team name “The Indians” and after over a century of being called that, there is growing demand to change the name somewhere in the near future.\n\nThe city of Cleveland needs a sense of hope and endearment, and Browns fans are one of the most passionate fan bases in all of professional sports. They depend on their beloved football franchise to deliver a title on a yearly basis. Instead they are met with mediocrity and disappointment on every year. A title for the Cleveland Browns would be a feel good story that is so hard to come by in these harsh times. The world loves to see the underdogs persevere and rise to the top.\n\nThis season has been a year of firsts in a while for the Cleveland Browns. They won their first playoff game since 1994, they won 11 games for the first time since 1994, and they made it to the playoffs for the first time since 2002.\n\nOn top of all that, they found an identity. Baker Mayfield has taken a step forward as a quarterback in his third season, the Browns running game lead by Nick Chubb and Kareem Hunt is as dangerous as any 1-2 punch combination, and the defense is aggressive and consistent.\n\nA city that is the epicenter of late night jokes could turn their landscape around with one Lombardi Trophy. The Browns have always played second or third fiddle in their division to the Baltimore Ravens and Pittsburgh Steelers for the better part of 30 years. A Lombardi Trophy would give the Browns a sense of respect that they have long lost. A Super Bowl trophy would make the city of Cleveland see a glimmer of hope to look forward to for the next generation of Ohioans who crave football.\n\nThe Cleveland Browns have the sky as their limit. They overcame the odds in a wild card matchup while their head coach and several players were battling COVID-19 and had to miss their game against the Steelers. How did Cleveland respond? a 28-0 first quarter lead. Ultimately winning the game 48-3. The Browns scored 40 or more points for the fifth time this season, something that the defending Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs have done just once this season.\n\nThe narrative of Cleveland being an awful place to be is due to change, and it all starts with the foundation of why that narrative has been placed, the curse over the head of the Browns is due to expire if not this year, in the near future. While a battle with Kansas City is not in their favor by any means, you can expect more competitive and amazing things to be accomplished by the Cleveland Browns, and one of those is turning the fortunes of the forest city around.\n\nFeatured\n\nPreviewing the NBA Finals\n\nBy Matt Siriani\n\nThe NBA was the first sports league to come together and agree to have a fitting conclusion to the 2019-20 season. Despite the bubble atmosphere, testing has gone well and the action has been limitless. But now, it’s time to gear up for the NBA finals after a series of twists and turns, it comes to the heavy favorite Los Angeles Lakers of the West taking on the Miami Heat of the East.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers came in as the dream team with the pairing of LeBron James and Anthony Davis has been so overwhelming for opposing defenses to stop. But besides the dominant duo, the showtime team has key contributors like Kyle Kuzma, who has averaged 25 minutes per game, and averages 13 points per game and is shooting 43.6%. There has also been Rajon Rondo, who has been a solid three point shooter and 40% shooter overall with competent defensive skills.\n\nDespite the lackluster presence of Avery Bradley due to injury, the Lakers have surged through the playoffs knocking the Blazers, Rockets, and Nuggets our in five games each. With the team dedicating their season to the late Kobe Bryant, can the best shooting team in the NBA get it done?\n\nThe Miami Heat have been exceptional throughout the playoffs on both the offensive and defensive side of things. Jimmy Butler leads the way for the Eastern Conference champs, scoring just under 20 points a game on average, but the team is also fortunate to have defensive juggernaut Bam Adebayo who averaged 22 points a game in the Eastern Finals against the Boston Celtics and recorded a couple of key blocks along the way. The team is very young with up and comers like 20 year old Tyler Herro and veteran presence in 12th year veteran Jae Crowder.\n\nMiami is also a cardiac fourth quarter team that when in rallying mode, could be very dangerous. This is the Heat’s first NBA Finals appearance since 2014 when LeBron James was the villain of the NBA, now 6 years later, this revamped and talented squad will face the man that made a dynasty out of the Heat in one of the most interesting storylines in recent years. Can Butler and company dethrone the King?\n\nPersonal prediction: The LA Lakers\n\nWe have seen teams like the Denver Nuggets and Houston Rockets come crumbling down at the hands of the Lakers. Two of the most dominant players in the game right now are on that team, and lastly the Heat for as good and as intense as they are a little inexperienced in big time situations like this. Also when LeBron James knows the Heat Organization inside and out through heat head coach Eric Spolestra’s coaching philosophy and Ken Riley’s montra, it could spell disaster.\n\nFeatured\n\nPreviewing Yankees vs Indians series\n\nBy Matt Siriani\n\nTomorrow, the Major League Baseball season will start their expanded 16-team tournament series’. The series that I have my eye on is the New York Yankees (who are the fifth seed in the AL) will travel to Cleveland to face the highly talented Cleveland Indians.\n\nThe Cleveland Indians wound up finishing in second in what was a very tough and competitive AL Central Division that also featured the Minnesota Twins and Chicago White Sox. The team’s pitching is pretty solid with the headliner being Shane Bieber, who became the first pitcher in Major League Baseball to win the triple crown winning eight games, striking out 122 batters, and recording an ERA of 1.63, leading the league in every category. He will be pitching for the Indians in game one.\n\nThe Indians are 23rd in batting average with third baseman Jose Ramirez leading the charge for the Indians. The Indians offensively are in the bottom quarter of MLB offenses but their pitching is second best in ERA with 3.29 and a batting average against opposing offenses of .223 which is the fourth best in baseball.\n\nCarlos Carassco would be the game two starter for Cleveland. Carassco faired okay this year compiling a 3-4 record but still having a sub 3 ERA in the shortened 2020 season. Carassco has had some good games this year such as the one-hitter against the Detroit Tigers this past week and a two-hitter against the St Louis Cardinals in late August. While it’s safe to say that no fans in the stand might not make a huge difference, what does is the fact that the Indians know the ballpark from top to bottom.\n\nThe New York Yankees were the consensus favorites to win the World Series in 2020 according to Las Vegas. However, once the pandemic hit and things changed, we didn’t know what we would get from the Bronx Bombers. They dropped the ball against the Tampa Bay Rays but still finished 2nd in the AL East which featured two teams who were down in the dumps and one other team with a highly young crew.\n\nThe Yanks finished the season with their two stars being DJ LeMahieu, who batted .364 in 50 games, including four games with 4 hits. Leading the league in batting average.\n\nLuke Voit, a man who was in a make or miss situation heading into 2020 as injuries and inconsistencies have plagued a promising start to his career, Voit blasted 22 home runs which was the most in baseball while also batting in the .270 range. While the Yankees missed Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton, Voit filled the Void.\n\nBoth men have made solid cases for AL MVP and guided the team to the playoffs amidst another season of twists and turns. The Yankees, are going into this season on a tailspin, losing 6 of their final 8 games and compiling a 33-27 record. However, they were recently on a ten game winning streak in which they showcased how dangerous they could be.\n\nThe Yanks are top 5 in Home runs with 94, runs scored with 315, and an on-base percentage of .342. However, the Yanks main problem is that they play their best in the confines of Yankee Stadium, so it should be interesting to see if they could play well in Progressive Field which might come down to being a challenge especially when they are in the midst of a slump.\n\nPitching game 1 for the Yanks will be Gerrit Cole. Their precious pitching gem who tossed two complete games this year, recorded a sub 3 ERA and showed passion and determination down the stretch of the season. Pitching game two of the series for the Yanks would be Masahiro Tanaka who has struggled during this shortened season going 3-3 with a 3.56 ERA.\n\nWho do you think is going to win this series?Comment below.\n\nFeatured\n\nNFL injury list week 2\n\nBy Matt Siriani\n\nThe NFL season took a turn for the worst when a plethora of injuries happened in empty football stadiums all across the league, with a handful happening in one particular game. So this is for the purpose of your fantasy lineups and also for the cause of informing about the condition of the NFL stars of today.\n\n1) Saquon Barkley; Running Back New York Giants\n\nBarkley suffered a brutal torn ACL in the Giants week 2 game against the Chicago Bears on the road and will unfortunately miss the rest of the season. Obviously a huge blow for the New York Giants losing their headline player. Dion Lewis will be the starting back for the rest of the year for the New York Giants\n\n2) Christian McCaffrey; Running Back Carolina Panthers\n\nChristian McCaffrey was intended to be the overall stud in Fantasy football. Unfortunately, during their week 2 game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, McCaffrey will miss at least one month’s worth of games with a high ankle sprain, but could be worth keeping on your Fantasy bench in case he returns.\n\n3) Jimmy Garappolo; Quarterback San Francisco 49ers\n\nBeloved Niners QB hobbled off the MetLife stadium field favoring his ankle. Now the reason why this is actually less concerning is because the high ankle sprain that Garappolo suffered on Sunday in an empty MetLife stadium seemed pretty mild though it was enough to keep him out for the second half against the New York Jets. More news surrounding Garoppolo should make its way soon\n\n4) Nick Bosa; Defensive End San Francisco 49ers\n\nSticking to the team by the Bay, one of San Fran’s fearsome foursome Nick Bosa had to be carted off the field against the New York Jets yesterday for what appeared to be a torn ACL. Depending on the severity of it, he will miss the rest of the year.\n\n5) Raheem Mostert; Running Back Sam Francisco 49ers\n\nRaheem Mostert got the 49ers off to an incredibly quick start on Sunday with an eighty yard touchdown run less than 15 seconds into the game. However, late in the second half Mostert went down to a sprained MCL and missed the end of the ball game. The San Francisco 49ers also lost backup Tevin Coleman to an undisclosed knee injury. Mostert won’t be our for long which is good, but it is important to stay up to date on the latest in regards to the Niners upcoming game against the Giants next Sunday.\n\n6) Drew Lock; Quarterback Denver Broncos\n\nThis is a crushing injury for the Denver Broncos as there starting QB went down due to a Sprained AC Joint that could keep him out for a month and maybe more. Lock showed towards the end of last season that he had some tools to be the guy that the Broncos have been searching for the last five years but now that will be placed on the back burner\n\n7) Anthony Barr; Linebacker Minnesota Vikings\n\nAnthony Barr was taken off the field after a nasty shoulder injury he suffered against the Indianapolis Colts yesterday. And ESPN confirmed that he will indeed be finished for the rest of the season. Misfortune for the Viking Defense who are losing a serious contributor to a stifling unit.\n\n8) Courtland Sutton; Wide Receiver Denver Broncos\n\nCourtland Sutton was a 1,000 yard receiver last year and didn’t see action last week against the Titans, but he was cleared to play against the Steelers on Sunday but teared his ACL while making a tackle following an interception. He is out for the rest of the year.\n\n9) Davante Adams; Wide Receiver Green Bay Packers\n\nDavante Adams was kept in check yesterday for the Green Bay Packers as he was dealing with nagging pains in his ankle along with a pulled hamstring. The severity of his injury hasn’t been disclosed yet. But this could be like a Julio Jones situation where he could be limited in games but actually getting a chance to play. The Packers do have an early bye week on Week 5 which could allow Adams to heal.\n\n10) Tyrod Taylor; Quarterback Los Angeles Chargers\n\nTyrod Taylor was hospitalized with chest pains before the Bolts game against the defending Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs yesterday. Head Coach Anthony Lynn said that Taylor May start in Week 3 if healthy. However, the way Justin Herbert performed in his rookie debut should give the Chargers a little confidence that they have some competence on the team at Quarterback which is also good in the form of depth.\n\nThe big question that these injuries have me asking myself is this all because of no preseason? Because if you think about it, not having any in-game reps and lack of training camp might have caused the players to not be in football shape for the season and so injuries have started to pile on and fast. Let me know your thoughts in the comments section.\n\nFeatured\n\nBig Ten Football returns in October\n\nBy Matt Siriani\n\nIn mid-August, a decision was made amongst the presidents of all Big Ten schools, that there will indeed be no football season in the powerful and popular conference. It was a decision that hurt the athletes and especially those who were declaring for the NFL draft in the spring of next year. However, it was first spoiled by the President of the University of Nebraska Ted Carter yesterday that the Big Ten will indeed return to play this fall. This morning, the rumor has been confirmed, and it was a unanimous decision.\n\nThe official start date for Big Ten Football to return will be on the weekend of October 24th. WRSU Sports Director Chris Tsakonas told me over the weekend that what inspired this change of heart was the introduction of an innovative testing system that would help players and personnel get their results back within 15 minutes, including cardiac screening, and antigen data enhancements being recorded on a daily basis.\n\nThe season will have an eight game schedule consisting of all-conference opponents and a conference championship. All games will consist of no fans in attendance except for family members of players. The schedules have not come out yet, but at the end of the day, the Big Ten is working with everything they have in the midst of a pandemic.\n\nSirius employee Jake Ostrove believes “if a Big Ten team can go undefeated in conference play, they could potentially make the College Football playoff.” I agree with this statement absolutely because the Big Ten conference has always been guaranteed a playoff spot every year, especially because teams like Ohio State, Michigan, Michigan State, Penn State, and Wisconsin are among the elite teams of College Football. According to Reese Davis of ESPN College Gameday, an eight game season is a large enough sample size to evaluate Big Ten teams for a potential playoff spot.\n\nBeing an alumni of a Big Ten school, I am very excited to see this story develop as we expect more news to come out regarding this jovial announcement. Now the question on my mind, can the Big Ten do this right?\n\nFeatured\n\nBig Ten Football returns in October\n\nBy Matt Siriani\n\nIn mid-August, a decision was made amongst the presidents of all Big Ten schools, that there will indeed be no football season in the powerful and popular conference.

Now the question on my mind, can the Big Ten do this right?\n\nFeatured\n\nAlvin Kamara and Dalvin Cook get extensions\n\nBy Matt Siriani\n\nWhen you look at the top running backs in the league belong to the multi-talented Alvin Kamara of the New Orleans Saints and Dalvin Cook, the Minnesota Vikings main offensive star. After speculation about when these two would get their well-deserved contracts, Saturday turned out to be the day they were waiting anxiously for. Alvin Kamara got an extension of 5 years for $75 million, while Cook got a 5 year extension for $63 million.\n\nThe latter back has been the workhorse of the Minnesota Vikings offense. Knowing that the underrated team from the north have a steady passing game, but underwhelming especially with the departure of Wide Receiver Stefon Diggs. Cook was drafted by the Vikings in 2017 out of Florida State University. In his first two years, legal issues and injuries stunted his potential.\n\nHowever, in 2019 Cook got his act together. He started 14 games and ran 1,135 yards on 250 carries and scored 13 rushing touchdowns. Minnesota loves having an offense purely based on the ground game, and I firmly believe the Vikings have faith and believe that the former Seminole can stay on a good track for the next several years (on a side note, I have him on my Fantasy Team).\n\nThe former back Alvin Kamara is one of the best all around backs in the league today. He is a great receiving back with great speed who was also drafted in 2017 out of the University of Tennessee. Kamara has made the pro bowl in each of his first three seasons, and has over 2,000 yards in receiving and rushing. While he has never eclipsed 1,000 yards in either category, versatility in the NFL is important for Running backs.\n\nKamara began his career splitting carries with veteran Mark Ingram Jr., but he shined in 2018, after Ingram was suspended the first four games of the year. He was ranked the 14th best player in the NFL in 2018 and has been one of the best Fantasy backs in the NFL.\n\nThese two backs have made the most of their precious time over the past season and have proven that they could perform at a high level. Can they sustain it?\n\nFeatured\n\nJalen Ramsey receives record contract\n\nBy Matt Siriani\n\nJalen Ramsey has been the best corner in Football since 2017, bringing the team from the ashes to the AFC championship game that season. Ramsey’s play has been consistent over the last three seasons and has given him the moniker of being arguably the best corner in the game. Midway through the 2019 season, the Jaguars traded him to the L.A. Rams, but just today, the Rams made Ramsey the highest paid at his position with a 5-year $105 million contract.\n\nRamsey in 2017, was a lockdown specialist. Irritating guys like AJ Green and keeping opposing offenses in check. He received a grade of 91.8 in 2017, had four interceptions, 17 pass deflections, and made 52 solo tackles. Making his first trip to the Pro Bowl.\n\nIn 2018, the Jags crashed down to earth after a berth in the AFC championship game the previous year, but Ramsey still remained productive, recording the first multi-interception game of his career against the Pittsburgh Steelers. He recorded three picks and deflected thirteen passes earning a second consecutive trip to the pro bowl.\n\nLast season, Ramsey was playing under the franchise tag and was unhappy with the re-building culture in Jacksonville. In a week 2 game against the Houston Texans, Ramsey got into a verbal disagreement with head coach Doug Marrone where the two had to be separated from one another.\n\nThe frustration boiled over to the point where he threatened to miss games and requested to be traded. And the latter happened when he was traded on Tuesday October 15th, 2019 to the Los Angeles Rams in exchange for a 2020 first round pick, a 2021 first round pick, and a conditional fourth round pick in 2021. Ramsey finished the season strong in Los Angeles, even recording the only interception of the season. However, Ramsey managed to appear in his third straight pro bowl.\n\nJalen Ramsey is on a team that is better defensively and the Rams are contenders in the NFC West division. Ramsey can also help give that middle of the pack Rams defense with his swagger and energy. Ramsey’s $21 million AAV is certainly top tier money, but as Ryan Berenger Jr. stated, it is a well deserved contract. But while Jalen has talked the talk, can be put the money where his mouth is and make the Rams a complete threat on both sides of the ball?\n\nFeatured\n\nKeenan Allen gets an extension\n\nBy Matt Siriani\n\nKeenan Allen has been one of the most underrated wide receivers in the NFL over the course of his career. He was drafted by the Chargers in 2013, and while the team hasn’t had much success since then, Allen was working his butt off to help the team win games. It took till 2017 for him to make his first pro bowl, and he has made the last three pro bowl trips in total. Now, Allen might be licked in as a charger as the 28-year Greensboro native signed a four year contract extension worth $80 million.\n\nIn 2016, Allen was limited to one game due to an ACL tear. Since then, he has amassed nearly 1,200 receiving yards of more in each of the last three seasons in that chargers offense.\n\nIn 2017, he won comeback player of the year playing all 16 games and recorded 102 catches for 1,393 yards and scored 6 touchdowns. He even became the first receiver to record three straight 100 + yard receiving games, 10 + catches, and score at least one touchdown between weeks 11-13 of the 2017 season.\n\nIn 2018 and 2019, Allen’s numbers in receiving were near 1,200 yards with 1,196 and 1,199 yards respectively. In the latter year, he set a career high in catches with 104. This is a solid signing for the Chargers to keep one of their biggest weapons around and given Tyrod Taylor some comfort as Allen has proven to be one of the most dependable receivers in the NFL.\n\nI’m not sure if this will make a dramatic difference as a quarterback change from Phillip Rivers to Taylor will help the Chargers win games, but at this point it’s all about keeping your best guys around and maybe even building Justin Herbert for the future.\n\nFeatured\n\nLeonard Fournette signs with the Buccaneers\n\nBy Matt Siriani\n\nFormer Jacksonville Jaguars Running Back Leonard Fournette signed a one-year $3.5 million contract with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers less than two days after being released by the Jags.\n\nFournette will most likely be the starting back for the Bucs and joining a star powered offense featuring QB Tom Brady, Tight Ends Rob Gronkowski and OJ Howard, and Wide Receivers Chris Godwin and Mike Evans. Fournette’s aggressive running style will give the Bucs an interesting dynamic to go with a potent passing attack.\n\nFournette has a career high 1,152 Rushing Yards and a record 4.5 yards a carry in 2019 as the Jags starter.\n\nSiriani Says Sports personality Austin Alberto predicts that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers could go 15-1 this year, with many others saying the Buccaneers have legitimate Super Bowl aspirations. Can they perform at a high level with their win now mentality? It’ll be interesting to see. But in my mind, Tom Brady has arguably the best supporting cast of his career since 2007.\n\nFeatured\n\nAndy Reid extended till 2025\n\nBy Matt Siriani\n\nKansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid finally got the monkey off his back by winning his first Super Bowl after more than 20 years as an NFL head coach across two NFL teams (The Eagles and the Chiefs). Well, the man who is capable of being a long tenured head coach in the NFL is gonna stick around Kansas City for at least five more years as the Chiefs extended his contract to the halfway point of the decade.\n\nAndy Reid began his tenure in Kansas City back in 2013, following a fourteen year tenure with the Philadelphia Eagles. He turned a 2-14 franchise into a playoff bound team at 11-5 including a 9-0 start in his first year. While the Chiefs made the playoffs almost every year between 2013-17, winning in the playoffs wasn’t coming easy for Reid which was the case in the city of brotherly love before that\n\nReid’s worst playoff defeats include late comeback losses to the Colts in the 2013 Wild Card game and the 2017 Wild card playoff against the Titans.\n\nIn 2018, the Chiefs finally broke through and became a force to be reckoned with in the AFC as the era of Patrick Mahomes took off. That season, the Chiefs had the number one offense in points scored and yards gained while also leading the NFL in sacks under Reid’s guidance. The Chiefs lost the AFC championship game falling short of a Super Bowl. At that point Reid’s playoff record was an unsatisfactory 12-14.\n\nThis past season, the Chiefs not only repeated another great regular season but reached their first Super Bowl and Lombardi Trophy for the first time in half a century. In all three playoff games, the Chiefs showed resiliency by coming back down 10 points or more and winning by 10 points or more. Putting Reid at a career 15-14 playoff mark.\n\nAt age 62, Reid has a lot of energy in the tank to go through another five years of winning football in Kansas City and could cement himself as a Hall of Fame coach throughout the waiting years with the players and personnel under his wings.\n\nIn Philadelphia, Reid was a young but great offensive mind, but the problem was that during his tenure in Philly, he had a dark cloud hanging above him at the time. Now, the bad luck has been lifted and Andy Reid can now be looked at as one of the more compotent coaches in professional football.\n\nReid’s career win-loss record from 1999-2019 is currently 222-142-1, which includes a 15-14 playoff tally and a 207-128-1 mark in the regular season.\n\nFeatured\n\nLeonard Fournette released by the Jaguars\n\nBy Matt Siriani\n\nIn the area of Jacksonville, Florida. The Jaguars has very few offensive stars. But one that really stood out was Running Back Leonard Fournette. A speedster from LSU who has shown potential in his three seasons in the NFL. However, after being unable to come to terms on a contract extension to keep Fournette as a Jaguar. The organization only had two options release him or trade him. They couldn’t find any buyers meaning that before Fournette could step on the field for the final year of his contract, Fournette was released this morning.\n\nLeonard Fournette was the prominent star on a poor Jaguars team that shines defensively for the most part. In Fournette’s first season, he showed promise by rushing for more than a 1,000 yards, scored nine touchdowns on the ground, and helped the Jags reach the AFC Championship game in 2017.\n\nFournette endured a sophomore slump combatting a hamstring injury and on-field suspensions via fights. A turbulent second season saw Fournette rush for under 450 total yards in 2018.\n\nThis past season saw Fournette rebound. Rushing for 1,152 yards which is a career high and inside the top 10 for rushing leaders last season. Jacksonville finished up the 2019 season with a mediocre 6-10 record. But still an improvement from the year before.\n\nJacksonville has gone through a downward spiral this past offseason after head of player personnel and former Jacksonville head coach Tom Coughlin was let go in December. Coughlin wanted to build the Jags through power-run and strong defense, similar to the historic 2007 and 2011 New York Giant Super Bowl teams that Coughlin coached.\n\nThis is the second move the Jags have made to tear down their roster with the first coming yesterday when DE Yannick Ngakoue was trades to the Minnesota Vikings. The Jaguars have also lost pro bowl Defensive End Calais Campbell earlier in the offseason as well as Quarterback Nick Foles.\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars looked like they were on the cusp of returning to relevance since their expansion days, especially with the return of the man who built the franchise from the ground up. Unfortunately, it seems like it will be hard for Jags fans to go through sixteen game seasons once again.\n\nFeatured\n\nThe Philadelphia Sixers fire Brett Brown\n\nBy Matt Siriani\n\nThe Philadelphia Sixers uncertainty for next season just took a big shot as the Sixers fire seventh year head coach Brett Brown following a sweep in the first round of the NBA Playoffs.\n\nBrown came to the Sixers in 2013 and was the original key component of the “Trust the Process” moniker the Sixers had attached to them as the Sixers endured a 26-game losing streak in his first year. However, as years went by he inquired talent like Tobias Harris, Ben Simmons, and Joel Embiid.\n\nThe last couple of years, the retooled Sixers made the playoffs as one of the most talented teams in the Eastern Conference. However, they couldn’t escape teams from their division in the postseason as they fell to the Celtics in the second round of the 2018 playoffs, then the next year they fell to the eventual NBA Champion Raptors in seven games off a miracle series of bounces on a Kawhi Leonard game winning shot. This year, they fell to the Celtics again in a four game sweep in which the Sixers averaged just 100 points a game, and in their eight game exhibition restart they went a mediocre 4-4.\n\nBrown’s overall win-loss record as Sixers coach was an abysmal 221-344. Over the last three years, the Sixers had two fifty win seasons and went 146-91. Center Joel Embiid said yesterday “He will be my friend, no matter what.” After the Sixers 110-106 defeat yesterday to eliminate them from the playoffs.\n\nFeatured\n\nYankee Doodle Darn\n\nBy Matt Siriani\n\nThese past few days were such a big letdown for the Bronx Bombers. Not only did they get swept by their arch rival Tampa Bay Rays ending their winning streak of 27 consecutive home series, but for the first time since June 2019, the Bronx Bombers are in 2nd place in the AL East division.\n\nWhile the Yanks currently sit at a pretty impressive record at 16-9, a little over 40% into the season and we don’t know how many more injuries there are to come. If the season ended today, the Yanks would face the Cleveland Indians in a four-seed vs five-seed matchup in the AL ranks.\n\nOne key factor that has been coming to bite the Yanks in the butt: injuries. As said by Corey Jason of WRSU Sports “None of the injuries so far have been preventable, you can’t fault the players or call them soft or injury prone because injuries happen, and a lot of the time it can’t be stopped. It’s just bad luck.”\n\nBefore the Yanks dominant weekend series against the Boston Red Sox, the team lost star outfielders Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton to lower body injuries. Midway through the series, Yankees’ star second baseman DJ Lemahieu suffered a hand injury on Saturday, then on Wednesday the Yanks’ reliever Zach Britton suffered a hamstring injury during his outing coming in for Gerrit Cole. Then today, the same happened to Shortstop Gleybar Torres, then starting pitcher James Paxton felt tightness in his arm after his start today.\n\nThe next thing that has really eaten the Yanks up is a sheer fact that the Rays know how to play the yanks and beat them under the current fan-less circumstances. The Rays are 6-1 vs The Yanks this year and have clinched the season series with a three-game set in the Bronx down the line in September.\n\nThe Yanks still have 35 games to go but people like Siriani Says Sports’ Anthony Siriani is hitting the panic button with the slew of injuries and closed gap between the two AL East teams. The Yanks has a 2 1/2 game lead prior to Tuesday, now the Rays have a 1/2 game lead in the two team divisional race.\n\nThe Yanks upcoming series with the Mets has been postponed after two people in the Mets organization have tested positive for COVID-19. Hopefully during the slight breaks the Yanks can get Judge and LeMahieu back as both men feel optimistic about an eventual return. But streaks in a sixty game season means that every game matters and while they didn’t fall to a bad team. The Yanks are looking to shake off a bad series performance. The Yanks lost all three games by scores of 6-3 on Tuesday, 4-2 on Wednesday, and 10-5 on Thursday.\n\nFeatured\n\nBig Ten cancels Fall season; PAC-12 to follow suit\n\nBy Matt Siriani\n\nCollege Football just took a massive shot today as one of their popular conferences, The Big Ten has postponed all fall athletics to the Spring.\n\nFirst year commissioner of the conference Kevin Warren headlined his decision today by saying “there was too much uncertainty regarding medical risks.”\n\nAt the height of the #wewanttoplay movement throughout the country. Players and coaches have come forward and expressed interest of playing a season from September to December. Penn State Coach James Franklin, Ohio State Coach Ryan Day, and Michigan head coach Jim Harabaugh played as huge advocates for the movement as an attempt to convince presidents of the Big Ten schools and their rookie commissioner to have an all-conference schedule.\n\nOn the downside, incidents in Ohio where a man infected 92 other people inside a church scares personnel to plan ahead for September. The state of Ohio eclipsed 100,000 coronavirus cases this past weekend.\n\nWhat really disgusts me about this is that there was no advanced planning for this at all. James Warren and college presidents practically sat on their hands and watched events unfold without even looking into what they were going to do. They should have been thinking proactively since June as to how they were going to go about their decision, not leave people clamoring for a season when it was so close.\n\nAnother conference that you can expect to make the same move but with less difficulty is the PAC-12. The PAC-12 has three state’s in there region that are known COVID hot spots in Oregon, Arizona, and California, with the latter leading all U.S. states in cases.\n\nThe remaining three power conferences that are left to speak about how they will handle COVID-19 are the SEC, ACC, and Big 12 conferences. This week is going to be a grueling week for college football but it’s only Tuesday and the sport already took two big blows with more drama coming along the way.\n\nThe following teams are part of the Big Ten Conference: Michigan, Michigan State, Ohio State, Illinois, Maryland, Northwestern, Iowa, Penn State, Rutgers, Indiana, Purdue, Nebraska, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.\n\nFeatured\n\nMAC Conference cancels all fall sports\n\nBy Matt Siriani\n\nCollege Football has been widely questioned to happen in the fall ever since the Coronavirus Pandemic started to take form in the US in March. The Southwest area of the country is currently being hit the hardest. But today, the Mid-American Conference or MAC for short is the first major conference to cancel all fall sports this upcoming season.\n\nThroughout the week, Northern Illinois president Lisa Freeman pushes for the idea of Fall Sports to occur in the spring for a better convenient backup plan. Then on Thursday, the University of Connecticut Huskies (UConn) announced that they would forgo playing in the Fall and play in the spring. While UConn is an independent school, they were scheduled to face a handful of MAC schools this upcoming season.\n\n11 games featuring MAC vs Big Ten schools were canceled for the time being which puts the conference in a $11 million deficit due to the Big Ten’s decision to go all-conference for the 2020 season. In addition, there is growing concern that because of this decision, students from MAC schools could transfer to other Power Five schools that are going to play this year.\n\nThis is a pretty big financial blow for the NCAA as a lowkey big profit conference will not be involved in the Fall. Making the College Football aspect seem competitive in theory, but also strips the fun of inter-conference play. Will this first domino lead to an even bigger fall?\n\nThe following schools are part of the Mid-American Conference: Akron, Bowling Green, University of Buffalo, Kent State, Miami Ohio, Ohio University, Ball State, Central Michigan, Eastern Michigan, Western Michigan, University of Toledo, and Northern Illinois.\n\nFeatured\n\nJustin Verlander out for the season\n\nBy Matt Siriani\n\nHouston Astros Ace pitcher Justin Verlander will miss the rest of the shortened MLB season with an injured elbow. Verlander pitched on opening day against the Mariners where he went 6 innings, struck out seven batters, and gave up 2 runs. There was no clear indication that he was in any pain and said in a post-game interview that he was very satisfied with his outing.\n\nThis is a massive blow to the Houston Astros as the head honcho of the Astros weakened pitching staff won’t be around to help the Astros during a short 60-game season. Last season, Verlander recorded 300 strikeouts, boasted a 21-6 record, and recorded a WHIP of an amazing 0.8. Verlander was experiencing some physical concerns as he went through Groin surgery in March and suffered a late injury during spring training.\n\nJustin Verlander last season won his second CY Young award at the age of 36, reached 3,000 career strikeouts, and posted a 2.58 ERA. The Astros are competing under circumstances that make them the villains of baseball following the fallout of the team’s sign stealing scandal. While the Astros have the talent in the batting department to do well in their division, the aspect of dominance has evaporated as one of the league’s best will be MIA. Can the Astros hold their own?\n\nFeatured\n\nJets make a deal; trade Jamal Adams to Seahawks for picks\n\nBy Matt Siriani\n\nYesterday, the New York Jets granted Safety Jamal Adams his wish and traded him away. And it was to the one team that value Defensive Backs more than any other team in the NFL: The Seattle Seahawks. To get him, the Seahawks traded away two first round draft picks, a third round draft pick, and Safety Bradley McDougald. So the Jets are getting a lower tier safety in return but two years worth of potential star prospects on top of that.\n\nSo the first thing that I can tell you about this trade is that Seattle gave up a lot to get him. You want those first round draft picks to build a future of success. However, Seattle primarily is focused on winning now, and with Jamal Adams being the top Safety in the NFL right now, he could be the beginning of The Legion of Boom 2.0. From 2013-14 the Seattle Seahawks had the #1 defense in the NFL. But specialized in the passing game, with a secondary comprising three amazing defensive backs in Richard Sherman, Earl Thomas, and Kam Chancellor. However, with those three gone, the Seattle Defense went from #1 in 2014, to 27th in 2019.\n\nThe Secondary was the prime reason for Seattle’s horrendous woes on the defensive side. Giving 264 yards through the air on average, which is more than 90 yards than their explosive 2013 season. Seattle gave up on average nearly 25 points per game last season, which is just outside the bottom 10 of 32 defenses, but typically giving up more than 20 points is not what a defensive unit should be giving up, despite the Seahawks having a top 10 offense.\n\nJamal Adams could be the start of a rebirth in the Seattle secondary and can even contribute to Seattle’s rush defense which also didn’t fair too well last season. Seattle also has Linebacker Bobby Wagner who is the only true star left from that 2013 Super Bowl Champion team.\n\nThe New York Jets on the other hand, are as mentioned before getting a player in return. The Jets finished 17th in passing defense last year, but 2nd against the run. Now the key for the Jets to get the better end of the stick here is they have to hit a home run with at least one of those two first round draft picks that they got. While gaining draft picks are valuable assets for building a team, drafting appropriately is the second part of succeeding.\n\nThe Jets might be giving up their erratic but talented Safety, but the situation works out for both as it allows Seattle to gain a building block to start over, and the Jets could be one piece away from putting together a contender. But who do you think won this trade?\n\nFeatured\n\nNo fans at Football games in New Jersey and New York\n\nBy Matt Siriani\n\nWhile Coronavirus cases, hospitalizations, and deaths have taken a turn in a positive direction in the New York/New Jersey region, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy announced today at his daily COVID-19 press briefing that while general “high risk” contact sports are approved, fans in attendance at MetLife Stadium for the New York Giants and Jets will not happen this season, and on the banks of the old Raritan, the Rutgers Scarlett Knights Football team will have no fans at SHI stadium in 2020. Rutgers is also in bad position right now given that if College Football is cancelled entirely, the Big Ten school will lose $50 million in total revenue.\n\nThe announcement is a tough pill to swallow for most fans of the gridiron war, but had to be expected since Baseball will not be allowing fans at all this season when the sport returns in the next few days.\n\nWhile New Jersey has announced this today, you can expect that other states and cities will be taking the same precaution. A couple weeks ago, the city of Philadelphia announced that all large gatherings of 50 or more people will be off the table till February 2021 (ouch!). Then if you go across the world to states like Florida, California, Texas, and Arizona are seeing massive spikes in the aforementioned criteria above COVID related with Florida becoming the new epicenter of the disease. Those four states host a combined 9 NFL franchises between them. But then in other areas like Massachusetts, Kansas City, and Maryland. The New England Patriots, Kansas City Chiefs, and Baltimore Ravens said that they plan to have limited capacity at their home games this season, although that has not been confirmed.\n\nI really expect NFL commissioner Roger Goodell to potentially place a no-fan policy this season across the league, seeing that it is unfair for certain teams to allow fans while most of the league can’t.\n\nWhile we don’t know for certain whether the NFL or Football in general will make it back to our screens, we now know in the Tri-state area at least, the only way you can tune in to watch your Giants or Jets games is through FOX, NBC, and CBS. The NFL season kicks off September 10th when the Kansas City Chiefs take on the Houston Texans.\n\nFeatured\n\nDerrick Henry gets extension\n\nBy Matt Siriani\n\nThe Tennesssee Titans in 2019 were the feel good story of the NFL a season ago. Ryan Tannehill resurrected himself from the dead, the defense kicked it up a notch, and player turned coach Mike Vrabel played smash mouth football and conservative gameplay. The defining moment of the Titans season camd in the playoffs when they dethroned the defending Super Bowl Champion New England Patriots in the Wild Card round, and knocking off the top seeded Baltimore Ravens in the divisional round. In those two games, the Titans came in as the road team and big underdogs.\n\nAfter finishing their season with a defeat in the AFC championship game against the Kansas City Chiefs, people including myself wondered just how good this Titan team could be in the future. The centerpiece of the Titans was Running Back Derrick Henry, the NFL’s 2019 rushing champion. From week 17 to the Divisional Round, Henry ran for a grand total of 588 yards across those three games, carrying a fun loving Titans squad deep in the postseason. Now the man who pinballs off of defenders, will be a Titan for another four seasons as the Tennessee Titans and Henry agreed to a 4-year $50 million contract extension.\n\nOriginally ESPN, reported that Henry was most likely going to play under the franchise tag and not under a contract. Today was the deadline for Franchise tag players to seek long term deals. While Myles Garrett of the Browns and Chris Jones of the Chiefs got their payout yesterday, Henry was one of 12 other tagged players across the league waiting for a deal to strike. And thankfully for Tenessee faithful, he got it.\n\nDerrick Henry was a second round draft pick out of Alabama with the Tennessee Titans in the 2016 NFL Draft, but was only a backup behind DeMarco Murray his first two years. As a backup he ran for 1,234 yards across 2016 and 2017. In 2018, the Titans made him the starting back and while he barely eclipsed 1,000 in 2018, Week 14 of that season saw him tie Tony Dorsett’s record with a 99-yard touchdown run against the Jaguars and break Chris Johnson’s franchise record for rushing yards in a single game.\n\nThis past season, Derrick Henry came alive. While the Titans had quarterback issues, Henry went from 12th in the Rushing chart in Week 6, to 1st at season’s end by recording 5 100-yard rushing games from week 7 to week 17. These games included a 188-yard rushing performance against the Chiefs, a 159-yard game against the Jaguars, and a 211 yard rushing game against the Houston Texans to claw the Titans into the playoffs.\n\nIn said playoffs, Derrick Henry and the Titans came into Gillette Stadium to play the Patriots and he ran for 182 yards against the league’s number one defense, including 100 yards in the first half alone. Knocking off the Patriots 20-13 on his 26th Birthday. The week after, the Titans travelled to Baltimore to face the 14-2 Ravens. Henry again carried the mail 30 times for 195 yards, and even threw a touchdown pass in a 28-12 upset. Despite being held to 69 yards rushing against the Chiefs in the AFC title game, the Titans were in control for a good portion of the ball game until the Chiefs offense came alive late in the first half.\n\nThis is a great deal by the Titans in my opinion because I believe Henry riding the wave momentum from last year will only get better and maybe eclipse 2,000 yards rushing. Power backs like Henry are hard to come by and this man follows in the tradition of great runners the Titans have had throughout their history which include Earl Campbell, Eddie George, and Chris Johnson.\n\nTitans head coach Mike Vrabel has adopted to playing a fierce ground and pound type style of football while also playing aggressive defense. And personally, I like that style of play from NFL teams. Look at the 2000 Ravens for instance, they had loads of quarterback problems with Tony Banks and Trent Dilfer, but they had a phenomenal defense to help the offense out and Jamal Lewis played a key role in getting the offense afoot.\n\nThis Titans team had to bring in their key stars and that’s exactly what they did here. They signed Ryan Tannehill to a four year extension, kept their offensive line together and even added to it by bringing in Isiah Wilson via the NFL Draft, and have focused on defense by bringing in Vic Beasley from the Falcons and drafting Kristian Fulton out of LSU in this year’s draft. The Titans are showing promise going into the 2020 season, but now that there head star has re-signed, Will the Titans make a splash in the AFC?\n\nFeatured\n\nMyles Garrett gets paid\n\nBy Matt Siriani\n\nCleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett has shown flashes of his potential as a top tier pass rusher in the NFL since being drafted number one overall in the 2017 NFL Draft out of Texas A&M. However, last season saw Garrett involved in one of the most aggressive conflicts in recent memory when he got into a fight with Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph and hit him in the head with his own helmet, in front of a Thursday Night Football audience in Week 10. Garrett was suspended indefinitely for his actions, but was reinstated in mid February. Now, Garrett got his long-term extension, and it consists of 5 years and $125 million.\n\nThe former pro bowler exercised his fifth year option of his rookie contract before this deal was made, guaranteeing he will be a Brown for at least till 2025-26. Garrett’s career has shown great promise with the former Aggie starting off 2019 with 5 sacks in the first two games before finishing with 10 in the 10 games that he played last year. The year before he recorded 13.5 sacks, recorded 29 Quarterback hits, swatted away three passes and forcing three fumbles.\n\nThe Cleveland Browns are going through another head coach stint with Kevin Stefanski at the helm. The Browns finished with an abysmal 6-10 record in 2019, but that came after a 5-6 start. The Browns are taking a very big risk re-signing Garrett when you consider how much drama came about during the infamous game against the Steelers back in November, but you can’t deny that like Chris Jones, Garrett is one of the best or most underrated at his position. Cleveland could certaintly use his pass rushing skills as the team rated 22nd in total defense, including third from the bottom against the run, with the culprit most likely coming from the fact that they had to play the best rushing offense in NFL history twice last year in the Baltimore Ravens. The Browns gave up 141 points through the final 5 games without Garrett in action.\n\nWhile the suspension allowed Garrett to take some time off, the question is will his AAV (Average Annual Value) at $25 million a year be too much of a price to pay for a guy who missed 11 of 48 games in his short three year career? Cleveland, we’ll just have to wait and see.\n\nFeatured\n\nChris Jones got paid\n\nBy Matt Siriani\n\nThe Defending Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs has an explosive offense on display over the last two seasons, with the $500 million dollar man Patrick Mahomes leading the charge.\n\nThe defensive side of the ball is a far cry from the franchise’s earlier defensive glimmer from the 1960’s or 1990’s but played well enough to be at a respectable level. One man who I’ve mentioned on the Chiefs defense that deserves credit, is Chiefs DT Chris Jones. The rising star signed a franchise tag earlier this year following a 31-20 win in Super Bowl LIV. Well now, he will be brought back for another few years as he signed a 4-year $85 million contract extension.\n\nIn a previous article I mentioned how the Patrick Mahomes contract should’ve been chopped a bit and given to the Chiefs franchise tagged pass rusher. Thankfully the Chiefs had some money leftover after the monster contract to give to the fifth year man out of Mississippi State. Chris Jones has been the anchor of a subpar Chiefs defensive line for the better part of the last two seasons and along with CB Tyrann Matthieu was a highly productive and disruptive force.\n\nJones accumulated 15.5 sacks in 2018 which was third in the NFL, and forced three turnovers (two fumbles and an interception). Last year, Jones missed three games due to injury but was able to record nine sacks and in the aforementioned Super Bowl against the 49ers in February, Jones forced the first turnover of the game.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs have had many pass rushing specialists throughout their history including Buck Buchanon, Willie Lanier, Bobby Bell, Neil Smith, Derrick Thomas, Tamba Hali, and Justin Houston, and Chris Jones falls into their category of being game changers on the defensive side, that can make the chiefs solid in that regard. the chiefs ranked 17th overall in total defense, 25th against the run, you can expect those numbers to drop had this deal not been made, with the likelihood of Jones holding out and potentially missing training camp.\n\nChris Jones is one of 14 franchise tag players across the league looking for a long term contract, and the deadline for franchises to seek long term deals with players who have been tagged. However, due to the Pandemic we don’t know how many long term deals will be reached across the league. But Siriani Says Sports will keep you up to date on all negotiations across the NFL.\n\nFeatured\n\nYankee Doodle Damn!\n\nBy Matt Siriani\n\nThe New York Yankees walk into the 2020 MLB season with a chip on their shoulder. They were knocked out of the playoffs by the Houston Astros in the ALCS in two of the last three seasons. They notched 103 wins in 2019 and had the second best offense in the MLB despite suffering 31 injuries across the entire regular season. They were also cheated out of two World Series appearances by the aforementioned Astros through the infamous sign stealing scandal that made headlines towards the tail end of last year. However, with the regular season shortened and some notable misfortunes, they aren’t off to the best of starts.\n\nOn Independence Day, the Yanks had two bumps in the road to MLB’s restart, the first game when Yankees’ right handed pitcher Masahiro Tanaka took a 112 mph liner to the head during a Yankees’ practice. Thankfully, he only suffered a mild concussion and has stated publicly that he is willing to make it back to practice and to the team as soon as he possibly could. Tanaka is coming off a season where he made his second All-Star appearance recorded 149 strikeouts and recorded a complete game shutout against the Tampa Bay Rays on June 17th, while going 11-9 in 31 starts.\n\nThe second bump that the Yankees took on the Fourth of July came when second baseman DJ Lemahieu tested positive for COVID-19. Thankfully the All-Star second baseman is asymptomatic and could more than likely be back in time for the Yanks’ opening series against the Nationals in less than two weeks. Lemahieu debuted as a Bronx Bomber last season and made a huge impact. Batting .327, hitting 26 Home Runs to go with 102 RBIs while finishing fourth in AL MVP voting.\n\nYankees Ace pitcher Luis Severino saw limited action last season due to a rotator cuff inflammation. The two time All-star announced in late February that he was undergoing Tommy John Surgery ruling him out for the 2020 season entirely. Before injuries came down on Severino, he was undoubtedly the Yankees’ go-to pitcher the past two years going 14-6 with a 2.98 ERA and 230 strikeouts in 2017 to go with a third place voting for the AL CY Young Award. In 2018, Severino went 19-8 with a 3.39 ERA.\n\nThe latest shot the Yankees took came today when Yankees’ star closer Aroldis Chapman tested positive for the Coronavirus and experiences mild symptoms. According to Yanks’ Manager Aaron Boone “in the event that Chapman is unable to play, relief pitcher Zack Britton would be given the closers role.” Chapman had arguably one of his best seasons yet a year ago. Recording 37 saves in 42 attempts and posting a 2.21 ERA. In 60 relief appearances, he struck out 85 batters.\n\nWhile these minor setbacks are not the kind of things you wish to see as a Yankees fan, you really hope that the Yanks’ with a roster of starting talent as well as talent on the bench could pull through for their 28th ring. The Yankees begin their regular season against the Washington Nationals in Nationals park on July 23rd at 7:08 pm and could be seen on ESPN.\n\nFeatured\n\nPatrick Mahomes gets record contract\n\nBy Matt Siriani\n\nOver the last two seasons in the NFL, no player has been more effective and efficient than Kansas City Chiefs Quarterback Patrick Mahomes. In his first two full seasons as the starter with the Chiefs, Mahomes won an NFL MVP award in 2018 after throwing 50 touchdown passes, and this past season he captured a Super Bowl MVP award while leading the Chiefs to new heights by leading them to their first Lombardi Trophy in 50 years. But now, Mahomes also took something else to new heights, contract salaries. The 24-year old prodigy struck gold with a 10-year contract extension worth $503 million.\n\nMahomes concluded the third year of his five-year rookie contract with a remarkable playoff run as the Kansas City Chiefs won all three of their postseason games after being down 10 points or more in each game only to win by 10 points or more, something that has never happened before in NFL Postseason history.\n\nThis is a continuing trend that we have seen in years past with Super Bowl winning quarterbacks getting massive extensions. In 2007, former New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning in his third year as a pro was on the verge of being run out of New York. He then changed his fortunes by knocking off the undefeated New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLII, then again in 2011 earning him extensions. Joe Flacco helped lead the Baltimore Ravens to their second Super Bowl title at the conclusion of the 2012 season snatching a $120 million contract extension in the process. Tom Brady winning Super Bowl titles with the New England Patriots in 2014 and 2016 convinced the Pats that he still has something left in the tank allowing him to stay for another three seasons after Super Bowl LI.\n\nMahomes’ AAV (Average Annual Value) is a record shattering $50.3 million a year, breaking Seahawk’s Quarterback Russell Wilson’s AAV for his recent extension of $35 million a year.\n\nWhile I think Mahomes absolutely deserves an extension, the overall number is absolutely crazy, and it could really put a lot of pressure on him to perform at a high level. We have seen Quarterbacks come crashing down to earth after hoisting the Lombardi Trophy and getting their money’s worth.\n\nThe aforementioned Joe Flacco hasn’t been the same since 2012, only reaching the playoffs once as a starter since then, battling injuries and inconsistencies. Now Flacco has bounced to the New York Jets as a backup. Eli Manning fizzled out of the NFL throughout the final 8 years of his career, eventually losing his job to Daniel Jones in week 3 of the 2019 season before ultimately retiring at season’s end.\n\nMahomes in two full seasons as a pro has a 108.9 Quarterback rating, won twelve games in the last two years, holds four playoff victories, has a league MVP and a Super Bowl MVP, and is arguably among the new Mount Rushmore of the best quarterbacks in the NFL today.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs are getting set to defend their crown in the next month and a half, but now we get ready to see how the Coronavirus as well as the pressure of being champs will play in to the Chiefs 2020 performance. The Chiefs walk into this upcoming season as the team to beat in the AFC.\n\nThis Contract extension also begs the question of how this will play into Dak Prescott’s contract situation with the Dallas Cowboys. The Cowboys have until July 15th to come up with a long-term deal with Prescott as he is playing on the franchise tag for the upcoming season.\n\nChief fans, I hope you are excited because Mahomes is slated to be with the Chiefs until 2031 if all goes well. The question here is will money buy the Chiefs two more Super Bowls?\n\nFeatured\n\nThe Washington Redskins might be no more\n\nBy Matt Siriani\n\nThe Washington Redskins have been an NFL franchise since 1933. The name itself has been with the team throughout 85 plus years. However, in a time where change is upon the world in more ways than one, the controversial football team name will be “thoroughly reviewed” by NFL officials and team representatives.\n\nThe cracks started to form in the 1960s and 1990s, but the first massive controversial hit came in 2013. At a symposium at the National Museum of the American Indian. The Oneida Indian Nation sponsored a series of Radio Ads to sponsor the Redskins but the ads also had a targeted message. It has been since that Native American Groups were finally being listened to after decades of being silenced.\n\nIn 2017, when the National Football League was dealing with racial issues, some commentators were speculating why there has been no action to address stereotyping of Native American people.\n\nIn Lewd of recent events that have happened in the United States, statues of racist icons have been removed, and Nike has removed all Redskins equipment and gear from there stores, and you couldn’t even get a result in search bars if you typed in the Washington Redskins.\n\nFormer Redskins owner George Preston Marshall was removed from the team’s ring of honor as it has been known for years that he didn’t want to integrate the Redskins in the early 1960’s. Anderson High School in the state of Ohio dropped the name “Redskins” from their team names and retired their mascot.\n\nRedskins head coach Ron Rivera said “the issue is of personal importance to me, and I look forward to working closely with Dan Snyder (the Redskins current owner) during this process.” Rivera is the only Hispanic head coach in the NFL right now.\n\nIf you look at the landscape of Washington sports team names, their hockey team are the Senators, the baseball team is the Nationals, and the basketball team are the Wizards. In our nations capital, the state should follow by example and make adjustments to adhere to the needs that people of all nationalities and decent have been waiting years for. While it will feel weird seeing the Redskins under different circumstances, it will satisfy this country’s desires of equality.\n\nIn the comment section, what do you think the team’s new name should be?\n\nFeatured\n\nCam Newton signs with the Patriots\n\nBy Matt Siriani\n\nOnce Upon a time, Cam Newton was a hot commodity in the NFL as the number 1 overall pick in the 2011 draft out of Auburn University. The former Heisman Trophy winner went on to play for the Carolina Panthers for nine seasons. During that time, he was selected to three pro bowls, led the Panthers to the playoffs four times including Super Bowl 50 during the 2015 season when he was the league’s Most Valuable Player.\n\nHowever, despite his meteoric rise to stardom in the NFL, Newton battled constant injuries stunting his consistency. This past season, Newton missed 14 games due to a Lisfranc Fracture and was replaced by backup Quarterback Kyle Allen. The Panthers went 0-2 with Newton to start the year on their way to a 5-11 finish. At season’s end, Cam Newton was released on March 24th, and replaced by former Saints Quarterback Teddy Bridgewater. Now, The man of fashion flamboyance will continue his career for a tenth season, with a team that’s known for resurrecting damaged caree"
