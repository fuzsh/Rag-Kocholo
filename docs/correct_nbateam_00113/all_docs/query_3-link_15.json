        "text": "Chris Kamara is no stranger to the world of football. From a long football career that’s seen him turn out in the jersey of 11 different clubs, to regularly appearing on our televisions every weekend as a presenter and pundit on SKY Sports. ‘Kammy’ is also rather famous for his quotes, most notably “Unbelievable Jeff!” and “Their fighting like Beavers!”. In a first for thebitoredblog, Kamara is the first non- Sligo Rovers related figure to be interviewed.\n\nFirst of all Chris, thanks for taking the time to do this interview.\n\n“No problem, any time!”\n\nWho were your inspirations in football when you were growing up ?\n\n“I was Boro and Leeds United fan as a youngster and so my favourite players were the likes of Eric McMordie andJonny Giles.”\n\nYou’ve played for 11 clubs Chris, at which one do you think you played your best football and which one do you have the best memories of ?\n\n“Winning the title with Leeds United in 1989 was a real career highlight, but I had many good memories at many of the clubs.”\n\nIn that time, you also scored 71 goals, again, which one was your favourite and why ?\n\n“I scored a goal for Swindon the year we got promotion in 1985 – the goals are on my official Facebook page – the one that got voted goal of the season was pretty special.”\n\nWhat it was like playing in English football when racism was at its most prominent ?\n\n“I mention this in my book, but ultimately you either became a victim to it or you got on with it. Thankfully organisations like Show Racism the Red Card and Kick It Out have done great work so it is no longer an issue in the modern game.”\n\nWhen you retired, you went into the world of management, and enjoyed some success with Bradford City when you helped them gain promotion. What was the feeling like to lead a team to success from the touchline ?\n\n“Unbelievable!”\n\nYou had your own Playstation game, ‘Chris Kamara’s Street Soccer’, and you’re often being touted to do commentary on FIFA. Do you think some day you will do commentary on the FIFA games ?\n\n“It has become a Wikipedia fuelled myth that I did the commentary on CK Street Soccer, but that isn’t true. I have done commentaries in the past on This is Football and Red Card Soccer, which my sons loved. If EA Sports got in touch who knows what might happen.”\n\nSpeaking of commentary, you’ve had some memorable moments. First of all, how did you miss that sending off in the Portsmouth game a couple of years ago ?\n\n“Ha, it is easily done!”\n\nWhich Premiership team would you say “Fight like beavers” ?\n\n“The Premier league this season has many clubs fighting like beavers, because so many are still in the relegation fight. No one is cut adrift yet and everyone can beat anyone. It will make a tense finale to the season.”\n\nIt goes without saying that the best game you ever commentated on was the record 7-4 victory for Portsmouth over Reading. What was it like to be there on the day, watching 11 goals being scored in one match ?\n\n“Unbelievable! I was so fortunate to be there that day, it was a dream game.”\n\nEverton’s Seamus Coleman is the latest League of Ireland player to make the step up to the Premier League having begun his career here at Sligo Rovers, do you think he can go on to have the same success that the likes of Kevin Doyle have had and establish himself in the top flight in England longterm?\n\n“I am sure he and David Moyes hope so, he certainly has the potential to do so.”\n\nWhats the most ridiculous thing you’ve seen during a match as a footballer or a pundit ?\n\n“Tough one, some of the Refereeing decision would be right up there. Stuart Attwell – Reading FC & Watford FC comes to mind.”\n\nIf you weren’t involved in football, what do you think you’d be doing right now ?\n\n“I’d be a Singer!”"
