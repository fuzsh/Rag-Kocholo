        "text": "NEW ORLEANS (AP) â€” Hornets spokesman Dennis Rogers says the club has made an \"organizational decision\" to excuse center Chris Kaman from Friday night's game against the Orlando Magic.\n\nKaman was acquired in a multiplayer trade that sent Chris Paul to the Los Angeles Clippers shortly before the regular season began, and the 7-foot center has struggled to find a consistent role in New Orleans.\n\nKaman has started six games and played in 17, averaging 9.2 points and 6.6 rebounds. He is also in the final year of a contract that pays him about $14 million this season, making him an attractive trade target for teams looking for both an experienced center and a large expiring contract that will help clear salary cap space at the end of the season."
