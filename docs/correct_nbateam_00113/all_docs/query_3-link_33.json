        "text": "Chris Kamara\n\nChris Kamara Date of Birth: Dec 25, 1957 Share \"Chris Kamara\" on Facebook\n\nAfter failing to gain an apprenticeship with home town club Middlesbrough, Chris joined the Navy and while stationed at Portsmouth caught the eye of Pompey scouts leading up to him being bought out by the club and making his League debut against Luton as a 17 year old in 1975.\n\nA tough tackling midfield leader Chris went through a variety of clubs before joining David Pleatâ€™s Luton in November 1991 as the Hatters were clinging on to top flight football. Loaned out to Sheffield United a year later, Chris spoke out in the press against the hierarchy at Luton but was then forced to eat humble pie when the Blades returned him to Kenilworth Road!\n\nChris finished his playing career at Bradford City before managing the Bantams and is now well known as a pundit on Sky Sports."
