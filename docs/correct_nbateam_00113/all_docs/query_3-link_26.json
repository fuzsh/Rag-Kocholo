        "meta_description": "Chris  Kammy  Kamara is one of the best known and most loved football\r\npundits in the UK. He has established a cult status on Sky TV s Soccer\r\nSaturday, Soccer AM and Goals on Sunday. Before turning broadcaster, Kammy enjoyed a 20-year playing career, during\r\nwhich he turned out for eight clubs, including two spells at Swindon Town.SoccerBible caught up with the former defensive midfielder to talk about\r\nSamsung s  Win a Pro Contract  competition - where the winner will sign a\r\ndeal with Swindon Town to kick-start their career as a pro footballer.SoccerBible: Tell us about how you broke into professional football.?\r\nChris Kamara: I was in the Royal Navy as a young recruit and they shipped me straight in to the\r\nfootball team because I was half decent.\r\n\r\nWe played a friendly against a Portsmouth FC youth team and I scored two goals.\r\nRay Crawford, Portsmouth youth team manager at the time, convinced the club to\r\nsign me. They bought me out for two hundred quid and it still goes down as the worst\r\ndeal in the club s history!SB: How big an opportunity is it for a youngster to be plucked from the\r\namateur game into professional football?CS: CK: It s massive. Football is everything, football is my life.\r\n\r\nSamsung s  Win a Pro Contract  is a great break for a lad. He might start off in the\r\nFootball League and make his way up to be a Premier League player. He might even\r\nend up doing TV work like me after his career, who knows?\r\n\r\nWithout football, I would have just had a naval career. I m not saying it would have\r\nbeen a disaster but it certainly wouldn t have brought me the reward and enjoyment\r\nI ve had over the years. I was fortunate to be in the right place at the right time. One of the lads who has\r\nentered  Win a Pro  is going to find himself in the same situation.SoccerBible: As a former manager, what are the key attributes Swindon Town boss\r\nPaolo Di Canio will be looking for as he selects the winner?\r\nCK: Ability. First and foremost. Everyone says attitude and desire and all that sort of\r\nstuff and, don t get me wrong, you do need to have that. But if you haven t got the\r\nability to go with it, you ve got no chance.\r\n\r\nThe player needs to be able to listen and learn from Di Canio. He needs to be able to\r\nimprove himself, and help improve the quality of the Swindon Town squad.SB: Who are the best young players in the Premier League today?\r\nCK: There are loads of good young players in England. If you are looking for role\r\nmodels - look no further than Jack Wilshere at Arsenal. He s shown what can be\r\nachieved. He is one of the best young players around.SB: Your playing career spanned 1975-1995. What differences do you notice\r\nbetween the modern game and when you first started out?\r\nCK: A lot of people you speak to say the game is quicker now and that player fitness\r\nis better than it was.\r\n\r\nThe back-pass rule was introduced in 1992. After that the game became a lot\r\nquicker and now the ball is hardly ever out of play. There have been changes with the equipment, too, and I m all for change for the\r\nbetter. Players before me talk about playing with heavy football boots and footballs with\r\nlaces! In my day, the football was a lot harder and heavier, so it was more difficult to float\r\nfree kicks. Boots are lighter than before. It s 2011 and we have better technology\r\navailable. We are moving on! All the best players of days gone by would have adjusted to the modern game\r\nthough.\r\nThe biggest difference of all is the money that players today are paid! It s just\r\nincredible. Top players now only need to work for five years and they re made for life.\r\nMost players in my era had to continue working afterwards.SB: The  Win a Pro Contract  winner will also receive a dream boot deal from\r\nwww.prodirectsoccer.com\r\nWhat boots did you wear, and what do you think of modern boots?\r\nCK:  Black adidas World Cups were my favourite. They were just so soft and they looked\r\nthe part.\r\nYou ve got to be a good player to wear the brightly-coloured boots of today. If you re\r\ngoing to wear them, you d better be a good player.\r\nYou see the likes of Rooney, Messi and Ronaldo wearing them, but I think it s brave\r\nfor a centre-half!\r\nSB: You have a reputation as a funny man. Which players make you laugh, and\r\ncould they follow you into punditry?CS: Jimmy Bullard always has a smile on his face and is always up to antics on the\r\npitch. He could definitely be a good pundit when he hangs up his boots.\r\n\r\nRobbie Savage is a character who likes a laugh and he seems to be the one who is\r\nvery much in demand.\r\n\r\nGazza was another character who would do something brilliant and have a laugh\r\nwith the crowd. There are not enough characters in the game.\r\nSB: Are your Sky TV jobs better than being a footballer?\r\nCK: It s different. I was a player for as long as I could be, then I was a manager for\r\na short period of time. Then I was fortunate to fall in to TV workafter leaving Stoke as manager. People have said to me for years, why don t you go back into football management? The reason is that I have such a great job now. I can be myself and have a laugh 95 per cent of the time. But I have always to conduct myself properly on air! I have a great rapport with Jeff Stelling and all the other lads on Sky TV and it just seems to work.\r\nSB: If Mario Balotelli had signed for Bradford during your 1995-1998 tenure,\r\nhow would you have dealt with him?CK: Very very differently to Roberto Mancini! I don t think he would have survived\r\nunder my management. Petulance breeds contempt from other players and you\r\ncouldn t have that back then.\r\n\r\nBut this is the modern game and Mancini has had to bite his lip to get on with him. Mancini is a young manager, a learning manager. Everyone can see Balotelli will\r\nrebel against whatever decision Mancini makes. I think Mancini has probably handled it the best way that he possibly could because\r\nnobody blames him for Balotelli s attitude. SB: Which team is your tip for the Premier League title?\r\nCK: I haven t had a bet yet this season because I backed Chelsea too early on last\r\nseason and by October it looked like a shoo-in. Then they sacked Ray Wilkins and it\r\ndestabled the club and allowed Man United to take the initiative.\r\n\r\nI m going to wait and see who else Man City bring in before the end of the transfer\r\nwindow. If they buy another couple of top players they could be the real deal. If not,\r\nI ll say it s business as usual... Man United.SB: Npower Championship?CK: West Ham. Big Sam will only want to be a Championship manager for one\r\nseason.\r\nSB: Npower League 1?\r\nCK: Huddersfield TownSB: Npower League 2?CK: Crawley Town are the Manchester City of the Football League - their spending\r\npower is more than any of their rivals. Even though they have just come up from the\r\nConference, if anyone finishes above them, they ll be promoted.\r\nSB: La Liga?CK: Barcelona. The decisions that they make about the players that they bring in are\r\nvery calculated. They select players based on creating a team. Cesc Fabregas is\r\nnow the type of player that Barcelona expected him to be when he played there. It s\r\nthe return of the one that got away and he will fit in to their system with Xavi, Iniesta\r\nand Messi.\r\nSB: And the Champions League?CK: Barcelona. In this modern game, you can t even tackle them. When you see the\r\nlikes of Messi performing as only he can, you can t look any further than Barcelona.\r\nSB: And finally, SoccerBible has to bring up the time you missed Anthony\r\nVanden Borre being sent off. Are you surprised that people still talk about it?CK: Initially, I was told off by Sky Sports because I wasn t concentrating on the\r\ngame. I was in the corner of the stadium and didn t have a great view of the pitch\r\nand there was no reaction from the crowd. And Jeff knew what had happened.\r\n\r\nThe Saturday night wasn t good for me because I thought I had really messed up! By Monday though, it was picked up on Fox Sports in America, Australian TV and even\r\nin China. Once Sky realised the publicity they got out of it, they didn t seem so\r\nbothered.\r\nIt has millions of views on YouTube, so long may the gaffs continue! SoccerBible readers who want to enter Samsung s  Win a Pro Contract \r\nand shoot for a professional contract at Swindon Town should register at\r\nfacebook.com/samsungfootball by Tuesday August 31.\r\n\r\nRegional trials at Goals Soccer Centres start on Sunday September 18..",
