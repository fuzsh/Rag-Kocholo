        "text": "Saints' Alvin Kamara: Skips final minicamp practice\n\nKamara did not participate in New Orleans' final practice of mandatory minicamp Thursday, though he was present at team facilities, Jeff Duncan of The Athletic reports. Kamara's absence Thursday appears to be contract related, as he currently has two years remaining on his deal with the Saints. Luke Johnson of The New Orleans Times-Picayune reports that while Kamara is seeking an extension with the team, not much progress has been made. The veteran running back has surpassed 1,000 yards from scrimmage in seven consecutive seasons, and his versatility remains instrumental to this offense. However, as he heads into his age-29 season, New Orleans could hesitate to re-up on a long-term commitment. Any time missed by Kamara this offseason will open reps up for 2023 third-round pick Kendre Miller as well as incumbent backup Jamaal Williams.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nSaints' Alvin Kamara: Reports for minicamp\n\nKamara (ankle) participated in the initial practice of the Saints' mandatory minicamp Tuesday, Mike Triplett of NewOrleans.Football reports. Kamara wasn't present for most of the team's offseason program, but his presence this week indicates he's healthy after missing Week 18 of last season due to an ankle injury. While he managed to surpass 1,000 yards from scrimmage for the seventh consecutive campaign in 2023, his 1,160 yards marked the lowest total of his career, partly due to him missing the first three games of the campaign due to a suspension. He'll again have to contend with Jamaal Williams and even Taysom Hill for short-yardage and goal-line work, but Kamara doesn't have much competition for reps otherwise. He's poised for a busy role in New Orleans' new-look scheme under offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nSaints' Alvin Kamara: Role safe following NFL Draft\n\nKamara (ankle) is in a strong position to maintain his role in New Orleans' offense after the team did not pick a running back in the 2024 NFL Draft, instead signing Jacob Kibodi as an undrafted free agent. The Saints added two running backs by this point of last offseason, bringing in veteran free agent Jamaal Williams and third-round pick Kendre Miller for depth behind Kamara. The latter running back still shouldered the majority of work out of the backfield with 180 carries for 694 yards and five touchdowns. He also played a significant role in the passing game with 75 receptions for 466 yards. This versatility speaks to Kamara's importance in what was an extremely limited offense. Williams unsurprisingly played much more sparingly as a short-yardage back, and he should function in a similar role in 2024. Taysom Hill has always been used as a Swiss Army Knife who, at times, operates as a rushing quarterback out of the shotgun. However, Hill's usage has never threatened Kamara's production in the past. Instead, his biggest obstacles to seeing another heavy workload in 2024 would be whether or not Miller starts to see more opportunities or if Kamara continues to struggle with injuries, as he did miss the 2023 season finale with a sprained ankle. The Saints added offensive lineman Taliese Fuaga with the 14th overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, which could help keep defenders off Kamara while improving the team's ground game as a whole.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nSaints' Alvin Kamara: Second in catches among RBs\n\nKamara (ankle) finished the 2023 season with 694 yards and five touchdowns on 180 rushing attempts, as well as 75 catches (on 86 targets) for 466 yards and one touchdown. Despite sitting out the first three games of the season due to a suspension and missing the Saints' finale with an ankle injury, Kamara finished just one catch shy of Breece Hall's league-leading total among running backs. Kamara's 6.2 yards per catch were a career low, though, and he posted the second-lowest YPC mark of his seven-year career at 3.9, suggesting that the 28-year-old running back is starting to slow down. There's a potential out in his contract this offseason, and the Saints will probably try to rework Kamara's deal rather than take on a nearly $19 million cap hit in 2024. Any change in situation would likely negatively impact Kamara's fantasy value, as his volume's more likely to go down than up, even with his ankle injury expected to be healed well before the 2024 campaign.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nSaints' Alvin Kamara: Inactive in Week 18\n\nKamara (ankle) is listed as inactive Sunday versus the Falcons. Kamara's Week 17 was abbreviated due to a sprained ankle, which didn't allow him to log a snap after halftime last Sunday at Tampa Bay. He then didn't practice at all during Week 18 prep before coach Dennis Allen called him a game-time decision Friday for this Sunday's contest, per Matthew Paras of The New Orleans Times-Picayune. The tide began to turn against Kamara suiting up following a report from Nick Underhill of NewOrleans.Football on Sunday morning that the running back wasn't expected to play, and that has come to pass. With Kamara sidelined for the first time since Week 3, he'll yield the Saints backfield to Jamaal Williams, while Kendre Miller (ankle) and Jordan Mims are available behind him.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nSaints' Alvin Kamara: Looks unlikely to play Sunday\n\nKamara (ankle) isn't expected to play Sunday against the Falcons, Nick Underhill of NewOrleans.Football reports. Kamara didn't practice this past week, with previous reports suggesting that the running back was viewed as a game-time decision for the contest. Confirmation of Kamara's Week 18 status will arrive once the Saints' inactives are posted 90 minutes prior to Sunday's 1 p.m. ET kickoff, but if he is indeed unavailable, Jamaal Williams would be a candidate to serve as New Orleans' lead back, while Taysom Hill, Kendre Miller (ankle/illness) and practice-squad call-up Jordan Mims would also be in the mix for added snaps versus Atlanta.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nSaints' Alvin Kamara: Trending toward game-time call\n\nKamara (ankle) remains listed as questionable for Sunday's matchup with the Falcons and is viewed as a game-time decision, Ian Rapoport of NFL Network reports. Saints head coach Dennis Allen suggested as much after Friday's practice, but at this stage, Kamara may be more likely than not to sit out the regular-season finale after he was listed as a non-participant on each of the Saints' three practice reports this week. Kamara will presumably be put through a pregame workout before the Saints make a determination if he's fit to play through the ankle sprain, but even if the running back is deemed active ahead of the 1 p.m. ET kickoff, he could handle a more limited role than usual. Jamaal Williams would serve as New Orleans' lead back if Kamara isn't available Sunday, while Taysom Hill, Kendre Miller (ankle) and practice-squad call-up Jordan Mims could also be in the mix for carries behind Williams.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nSaints' Alvin Kamara: Listed as questionable\n\nKamara (ankle) is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Atlanta, with head coach Dennis Allen suggesting Friday that the running back will be a game-time decision, Matthew Paras of The New Orleans Times-Picayune reports. \"Alvin is one of the guys so valuable to our team, we'll take it all the way up to game time,\" Allen said. Kamara wasn't able to return for the second half of last week's win over Tampa Bay after spraining in his ankle in the second quarter, and he didn't practice Thursday or Friday. His chances of playing Sunday don't appear great at the moment, but Kamara will at least be given a shot to suit up heading into the weekend, shaping up as a potential game-time call ahead of the 1 p.m. ET kickoff. Jamaal Williams will fill in as the lead back if Kamara isn't healthy enough to give it a go with a playoff spot on the line.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nSaints' Alvin Kamara: Still not practicing Thursday\n\nKamara (ankle) isn't participating in Thursday's practice, Luke Johnson of The New Orleans Times-Picayune reports. A sprained ankle kept Kamara sidelined for the entire second half of this past Sunday's 23-13 win over the Buccaneers, and he's thus far taken no tangible steps forward in his recovery from the injury through the Saints' first two Week 18 practices. He'll have one more chance Friday to get in some on-field reps before the Saints decide whether Kamara carries a designation into Sunday's game against the Falcons. If Kamara is out or available only in a limited capacity this weekend, Jamaal Williams and Taysom Hill could see heightened roles in the Saints' ground attack.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nSaints' Alvin Kamara: Fails to practice Wednesday\n\nKamara (ankle) was listed as a non-participant at Wednesday's practice, John Hendrix of SI.com reports. Kamara didn't play after halftime of this past Sunday's win in Tampa Bay due to an ankle injury, which head coach Dennis Allen called a sprain of unknown severity Monday. With no on-field work to begin Week 18 prep, Kamara will now have two more sessions this week to put himself on a path to suiting up for Sunday's must-win game against the Falcons. If Kamara is inhibited or sidelined this weekend, he'll yield most of the backfield reps to Jamaal Williams.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nSaints' Alvin Kamara: Not spotted at practice Wednesday\n\nKamara (ankle) wasn't seen on the field during the media-access portion of Wednesday's practice, Katherine Terrell of ESPN.com reports. Kamara made an early exit from this past Sunday's win at Tampa Bay due to an ankle injury, which head coach Dennis Allen confirmed to be a sprain one day later, per John Hendrix of SI.com. The severity of the issue isn't known, but it appears to be keeping Kamara off the field for the first session of Week 18 prep. Wednesday's practice report ultimately may confirm as much.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nSaints' Alvin Kamara: Severity of ankle sprain uncertain\n\nSaints head coach Dennis Allen didn't clarify the severity of Kamara's ankle sprain but said the running back was rehabbing the injury Monday, John Hendrix of SI.com reports. Kamara suffered an ankle sprain in Sunday's victory over Tampa Bay and wasn't able to play in the second half. The Saints need a win over Atlanta on Sunday to have a chance of qualifying for the postseason, but it's uncertain if he'll be able to suit up for the contest. Kamara's chances of playing should become clearer as Week 18 prep unfolds, and if he isn't able to take the field, Jamaal Williams would likely take over the bulk of the work in the Saints backfield.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nSaints' Alvin Kamara: Exits Sunday with ankle injury\n\nKamara has been ruled out for the rest of Sunday's game against the Buccaneers with an ankle injury, Nick Underhill of NewOrleans.Football reports. Kamara carried 10 times for 45 yards and caught two passes for four yards in the first two quarters of the game but remained in the locker room at halftime to get the ankle injury checked out. The Saints initially listed Kamara as questionable to return shortly after the third quarter started, only for him to be ruled out for the rest of the game shortly thereafter. New Orleans will likely turn to Jamaal Williams and Taysom Hill as its primary rushers for the rest of the day.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nSaints' Alvin Kamara: Active as expected Sunday\n\nKamara (illness) is active for Sunday's game against the Buccaneers. The star running back was reported to be trending toward suiting up Saturday night, and his active status is now official. While his availability is certainly welcome news for fantasy managers counting on the versatile veteran in their leagues' critical postseason matchups, it's worth noting Kamara is coming off his most inefficient rushing day of the season -- he garnered 19 yards on nine carries against the Rams in Week 16 -- and faces a Buccaneers defense that's yielded just 64.3 rushing yards per contest in the last three games.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nSaints' Alvin Kamara: Expected to play Sunday\n\nKamara (illness) is slated to play in Sunday's game at Tampa Bay, Adam Schefter of ESPN reports. Kamara sat out Friday's practice due to an illness and is officially listed as questionable for Week 17. In light of Schefter's report, however, Kamara looks set to avoid the Saints' inactive list, which will be posted about 90 minutes before Sunday's 1 p.m. ET kickoff. With that in mind, Kamara has a good chance at handling his typical workload, which has equated to 89 touches for 418 yards from scrimmage and three rushing touchdowns in five games since the team's Week 11 bye.\n\n... See More ...

Kamara was an end-of-week addition to the injury report and now has two days to recover before the Saints play a game they need to win to have a realistic shot at making the playoffs. If Kamara ends up inactive ahead of the 1:00 p.m. ET kickoff this Sunday, the Saints likely will turn to Jamaal Williams for most of the backfield snaps, with Kendre Miller (ankle, questionable) and/or James Robinson (practice squad) potentially getting some snaps off the bench. A Kamara absence might also allow Taysom Hill to get more carries, though that's far from a sure thing given his recent lack of involvement in the New Orleans offense.\n\n... See More ...

There's no word yet on whether the Saints view Kamara's illness as a significant threat to his availability for Sunday's matchup with Tampa Bay. The veteran RB wasn't listed on the injury report Wednesday or Thursday.\n\n... See More ...

The contest eventually tilted away from the running game for the Saints, and while Kamara did tie for second in receptions on the team for the night, he averaged only 3.2 yards per grab. He also found precious little running room on a carry total that tied his season low. Despite the disappointing results during a critical week of the fantasy season, Kamara still should be a must-start option in an important Week 17 road matchup against the Buccaneers on New Year's Eve.\n\n...

Kamara finished with the most carries, rushing yards and catches among players from either team, and only Giants wide receiver Darius Slayton (63) had more receiving yards in this defensive battle. The versatile running back was leaned on heavily in the absence of wide receivers Chris Olave (ankle) and Michael Thomas (knee). Kamara's 21 touches marked his highest total since Week 8, and he eclipsed 100 scrimmage yards for the sixth time this season. His significant involvement as both a rusher and a pass catcher should give Kamara a high floor Thursday against the Rams.\n\n... See More ... See Less"
