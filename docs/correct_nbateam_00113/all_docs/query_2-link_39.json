        "text": "“Pelicans” isn’t the only potential new nickname in play for New Orleans Hornets — the team filed trademarks for four other options. Per Behind the Buck Pass (via the Times-Picayune): “Anil V. George, the attorney who typically handles the trademarks involving NBA brand names, filed trademarks on five new potential franchise names on behalf of the New Orleans Hornets NBA Limited Partnership. The five names included the favorite Pelicans, a mascot that ties into the state bird as well as a minor league baseball team that existed from 1887 to 1959, but the four others also have strong Louisiana ties. The trademarks: New Orleans Pelicans, New Orleans Rougarou, New Orleans Mosquitos, New Orleans Swamp Dogs, New Orleans Bullsharks. UrbanDictionary.com has swamp dog listed as a Cajun nickname for an alligator. Bullsharks live, among other places, in the Gulf of Mexico. The term ‘Rougarou’ refers to a beast from Louisiana folklore, a monster from oral traditions that varies — depending on the tale — from a werewolf-like blood-seeking beast to a boogeyman.”"
