        "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio â€” Although Cavs general manager Chris Grant declined to comment, NBA sources indicate the Cavs are interested in New Orleans center Chris Kaman, who is on the trading block. At this point, their level of interest is unclear, although the Cavs have long been admirers of the 7-footer obtained by the Hornets from the Clippers in the trade for Chris Paul earlier this season.\n\nA call to Kaman's agent, Rob Pelinka, was not returned on Saturday and Cavs coach Byron Scott refused to weigh in.\n\n\"I have no thoughts on that whatsoever,\" Scott said as the Cavs prepared to leave for Boston, where they will face the Celtics today. \"CG, that's his job to handle all that.\"\n\nKaman, who will turn 30 on April 28, makes $14 million this season and will become an unrestricted free agent this summer, another attractive factor along with his career averages of 12 points and 8 rebounds. The league-owned Hornets discussed extending his contract, but they have decided to go with younger players. Kaman was not with the team for its home game against Orlando on Friday and likely will remain away until a deal is done.\n\nCavaliers at Boston Celtics\n\nTipoff:\n\nTV/radio:\n\nNotable:\n\n-- Mary Schmitt Boyer\n\nGiven that the league must approve any deal, that could be awhile if the Paul trade is any indication.\n\nThe Cavs have been looking for a true center since the departures of Zydrunas Ilgauskas and Shaquille O'Neal after the 2009-10 season. They are starting Anderson Varejao, a natural power forward. The backup center spot has been a revolving door, as coach Byron Scott has tried Ryan Hollins, Samardo Samuels, Semih Erden and even rookie Tristan Thompson there without much success.\n\nStill, there would seem to be a number of roadblocks to the Cavs being able to make a deal for Kaman, who was born in Grand Rapids, Mich., and attended Central Michigan. Chief among them would be what the Hornets would want in return. The Cavs are in their own youth movement/rebuilding process, so they're not going to part with a No. 1 draft choice. Rookie Kyrie Irving is off the table.\n\nAnother roadblock would be the competition for Kaman's services. With his expiring contract, he would seem to be a better fit for a contending team like San Antonio or Houston. Other teams reportedly interested include Detroit, Indiana, Utah and Golden State. In order to be traded to a non-contending team, like the Cavs, Kaman almost certainly would have to agree to sign an extension with that team.\n\nCeltic pride: The Cavs are not writing off the Celtics.\n\n\"I would never write them off right now,\" Scott said. \"Until that big three retires, as long as you've got Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce and Ray Allen -- I don't know if Ray Allen will play -- as long as you've got those three guys and Doc Rivers on the sideline, I would never write them off.\"\n\nSaid Antawn Jamison of the Celtics: \"This is a team that competes. They know how to win. I think when they hear people saying that they're too old or they're getting to the point where they can't compete, that just energizes them.\"\n\nHe's looking forward to playing against Garnett.\n\n\"I think the matchup between us is going to be the matchup that really gives our team the advantage,\" said Jamison. \"I just have to compete for 48 minutes.\"\n\nThe Cavs are 5-2 when Jamison scores 20 or more points.\n\nFree throws aren't free: After every practice, each Cavalier has an assigned number of free throws he has to make based on how well (or poorly) he's shooting from the line. On Friday, the Cavs made just 14 of 24 free throws (58.3 percent) and are shooting 68.6 percent for the season (308-of-449). Saturday, there were a lot of foul shots taken.\n\n\"You've got more guys today who have to make 100 before they leave the gym than normal,\" Scott said. \"It has to get better.\""
