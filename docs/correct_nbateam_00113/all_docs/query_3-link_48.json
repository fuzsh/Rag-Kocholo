        "text": "Jamie Johnson, Noah Murphy, Maggie O&rsquo;Connell, Charlie Stubbs, Shakes, The Blok, El Matador. Are we seeing the emergence of a crop of fictional footballers worthy of standing on the shoulders of giants like Roy Race, Blackie Gray, Tommy Barnes, Billy Dane, Hamish Balfour, Johnny Dexter and Glipton Grasshoppers&rsquo; star man Ross Nelson?\n\nCatch up with all the weekend antics from the Premier League in Monday Morning Leftback&nbsp;\n\nChris Kamara is often regarded as Sky Sports&rsquo; joker in the pack but he&rsquo;s serious about tippingArsenal to end their long title drought and win the Premier League this season.\n\nOn a Sunderland penalty in the tyneside derby - “It’s (Davide) Santon, he’s going to take it, he’s been on most of the free-kicks - no, it’s not Santon, Santon plays for Newcastle.”\n\nMike Griffin has been in Brazil collecting signatures throughout the World Cup and last night put the icing on the cake with a signature from a newly crowned World Cup winner.\n\nFifa doesn&rsquo;t allow non-rights holders such as Sky Sports access to any of its World Cup media centres, but a broadcasting colossus like Chris Kamara doesn&rsquo;t need that kind of mollycoddling to make an impact in Brazil.\n\nAn unmistakable air of sobriety descended on the Cheltenham Festival towards the end of ‘St Patrick’s Thursday’ when news emerged that amateur jockey JT McNamara was airlifted to Frenchay Hospital in Bristol after suffering a serious injury.\n\nROY HODGSON could be about to slam the door on one of England’s management options.\n\nHigh-spending telephone punters came to the rescue of Ladbrokes today after results from its betting shop operation failed to meet targets.\n\nWigan have appointed assistant boss Chris Hutchings as the club’s new manager after Paul Jewell resigned today – less than 24 hours after leading the club to Premiership safety.\n\nIf 2005 was Jose Mourinho’s year, it wasn’t bad either for the mimic who entertained the Chelsea manager and his players. Mario Rosenstock explains to Liam Mackey how the surreal gig came about."
