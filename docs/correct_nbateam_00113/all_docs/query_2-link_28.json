Dowtin averaged 17.1 points and 5.7 assists across NBA Summer League for 76ers this season after playing 12 games for Philadelphia in 2023-24.\n\nDavid Hardisty: In an interview with @Vanessa Richadson, #Rockets coach Ime Udoka praises Reed Sheppard’s overall feel for the game, calling him a “natural leader.” “He just continues to make the right play. That’s something that’s hard to teach.”"
