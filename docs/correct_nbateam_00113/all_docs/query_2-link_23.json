        "text": "Charlotte Hornets, American professional basketball team based in Charlotte, North Carolina, that plays in the Eastern Conference of the National Basketball Association (NBA).\n\nThe team, originally known as the Bobcats, joined the NBA in 2004 as the league’s 30th franchise. The team’s owner was Robert L. Johnson, an American media mogul who, with the founding of the Bobcats, became the first African American majority owner of a franchise in one of the four major team sports leagues in the United States. Although the Bobcats featured talented young players such as Rookie of the Year centre-forward Emeka Okafor and forward Gerald Wallace, the team was not an early success: it finished with a losing record and in last or second-to-last place in its division in each of its first five seasons in the NBA.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nGreat Moments in Sports Quiz\n\nIn 2006 basketball great Michael Jordan, a native of North Carolina, became minority owner and general manager of the team, and in 2008 Charlotte hired Hall of Fame head coach Larry Brown to try to turn around the franchise’s fortunes. In 2010 Jordan took over majority ownership of the Bobcats and relinquished his general manager position. Charlotte finished the 2009–10 season with the first winning record in franchise history, earning the team its first playoff berth. The Bobcats’ success was short-lived, however, and Brown left the team 28 games into its losing 2010–11 campaign. During the lockout-shortened 2011–12 season, the team had an NBA-record-low .106 winning percentage, losing all but 7 of its 66 games. The Bobcats rebuilt and quickly bounced back from this nadir, posting a winning record and qualifying for the playoffs in the 2013–14 season."
