        "text": "Doug Pensinger/Getty Images\n\nThe New Orleans Hornets are officially in a rebuilding phase after trading guard Chris Paul to the Los Angeles Clippers before the start of the 2011-12 NBA season. After acquiring Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman (expiring contract) and Al-Farouq Aminu and a 2012 first-round draft pick (Minnesota) from Los Angeles, the Hornets are looking into making some more moves as the team looks to get younger while preparing for the future.\n\nAccording to Marc Stein of ESPN.com, the Hornets are looking into the possibility of dealing the veteran big man as they would rather play their younger big men (Jason Smith and Mexican rookie Gustavo Ay√≥n) much of the season. One reason the Hornets were asking the Clippers for Kaman was that he has trade value and the Hornets would get another opportunity to add to their roster.\n\nKaman spent eight seasons with the Clippers and averaged a career-high 18.5 points during the 2009-10 NBA season before dealing with injuries that eventually led him to be replaced in the lineup by youngsters Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan.\n\nKaman possesses an expiring contract and can be a great addition to a team that is in need of a scoring big man. Teams such as the Atlanta Hawks, Boston Celtics, Dallas Mavericks, Houston Rockets, Golden State Warriors, Milwaukee Bucks and the San Antonio Spurs could make offers to Hornets general manager Dell Demps.\n\nHowever, the Hornets are probably going to ask for a lot in return (future draft pick and/or a young player) as they are continually evaluating their roster."
