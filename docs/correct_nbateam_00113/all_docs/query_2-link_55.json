        "text": "According to ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski, the Charlotte Hornets have re-signed guard Seth Curry to a one-year contract.\n\nThe 10-year veteran started the 2023-24 season as a member of the Dallas Mavericks. However, after 36 games with the team, Dallas shipped him off to Charlotte in a deal to land P.J. Washington. Curry appeared in just eight games for the Hornets, starting one of them. In those games, he averaged 9 points, 2 rebounds, and 1.8 assists per game. Furthermore, he shot 44.1% from the field and 32.1% from the three-point line.\n\nCharlotte waived Curry at the beginning of the offseason to avoid guaranteeing his contract for next season. However, Wojnarowski reported there was mutual interest from both sides to come to terms on a new deal this offseason.\n\nCharlotte Hornets Re-Sign 10-Year NBA Veteran Shooting Guard\n\nSeth Curry Remains in His Hometown\n\nCurry was born in Charlotte and even went to high school there as well. From 1988-to-1998, his father, Dell Curry, was a member of the Hornets. Following the trade that sent his son to the Hornets, the elder Curry said “it’s a dream come true” to see him donning his number for his former team.\n\nAdditionally, after the trade, Seth spoke about being excited to play for the Hornets and wear his father’s jersey number.\n\n“[Being home] feels good. It’s exciting. Growing up, I obviously always wanted to put that jersey on. Wearing [jersey number 30, like his father Dell with the Hornets] is like a full-circle moment. It’s obviously a little bit of a shake-up getting traded in the middle of the season, but if I wanted to go anywhere, it would be here.”\n\nThe Last Word on Seth Curry and the Charlotte Hornets\n\nRe-signing Curry is a good low-risk move for the Hornets. The Charlotte native offers excellent perimeter shooting and is a long-time NBA veteran. Additionally, he provides depth and can offer a boost off the bench.\n\nSo far, the Hornets have had a busy offseason. In addition to re-signing Curry, the Hornets also re-signed wing Miles Bridges to a three-year, $75 million contract. Furthermore, they selected forward Tidjane Salaun with the No. 6 pick in the 2024 NBA Draft and also signed veteran big man Taj Gibson. The team also acquired veterans Josh Green and Reggie Jackson. All these moves come just a couple of months after the team hired Charles Lee to be their next head coach.\n\nLast season, the Hornets finished with a 21-61 record, third-worst in the Eastern Conference. Additionally, they have yet to make a playoff appearance since their seven-game loss to the Miami Heat in the first round of the 2016 NBA Playoffs. Still, there is a lot to look forward to in Charlotte next season."
