        "text": "16 April 2024\n\nKamara, 66, will be presented with the honour by Wakefield Council in West Yorkshire on 15 May for his charity work.\n\nHe said: \"Freedom of the city for Shaky Wakey - unbelievable!\"\n\nOver the years he has worked to raise money for charities including Marie Curie and Show Racism the Red Card.\n\nMore recently, Kamara, who was born and raised in Middlesbrough, has been instrumental in raising awareness for apraxia after being diagnosed with the speech condition in 2022.\n\nHe said: \"I have lived in Wakefield longer than anywhere else. We came here in 1990 and 34 years later we are still here.\n\n\"The people and the places are amazing, and we will never leave Wakefield. All my family are here and it will always be our home.\n\n\"That is why this means so much to me, I'm blown away by it.\"\n\nCouncil leader Denise Jeffery said Kamara, who played for Swindon, Brentford, Leeds and and Bradford among others, was \"a true ambassador\" for the city.\n\n\"We couldn't ask for a more down to earth and genuine person to award this to.\n\n\"His contribution to charity and our city really is - unbelievable,\" she added\n\nKamara, who also guided the Bantams to promotion as boss, was appointed MBE in the 2023 New Year's Honours list for services to football, anti-racism and charity.\n\nThe Mayor of Wakefield, councillor Josie Pritchard, will present the award at a civic ceremony followed by a private reception in his honour.\n\nShe said: \"Chris is a local and national legend and an inspiration to so many people. We are absolutely delighted to be giving him the highest honour we can bestow - Freedom of the City.\n\n\"He has been a massive supporter of many charities, raising millions and making a difference to the lives of many."
