        "text": "Chris Kamara, known to millions as ‘Kammy’, is one of Britain's best-loved television presenters. A former professional football player and manager, he worked as a pundit and football analyst at Sky Sports for twenty-four years, achieving cult status for his off-the-wall catch phrases and irrepressible enthusiasm. In 2022, he left his post at Sky Sports after being diagnosed with the neurological condition apraxia, which impacts his speech. He continues to present a number of television programmes and podcasts, including Ninja Warrior, Cash in the Attic, UK’s Strongest Man and Proper Football.\n\nHe joined the Royal Navy at the age of sixteen, before signing up with Portsmouth FC in 1974. He went on to represent several other clubs, including Swindon Town, Brentford, Leeds United, Middlesborough, Stoke City, Luton Town, Sheffield Utd and Bradford City, before he retired in the mid-1990s. Following his retirement from playing, Kamara became a manager, first at Bradford City and then a brief spell at Stoke City.\n\nIn March 2023 he was awarded an MBE for services to football, charity, and anti-racism."
