        "text": "Chris Kamara is perhaps is best known for his hard-hitting, often light-hearted analysis of Premier League action from the gantry, making him a household name. He’s also won over legions of fans with his irreverent pre-match lives on Soccer AM.\n\nHe also appeared on Sky Sports’ Soccer Saturday programme, where he usually appeared over live video link providing brief updates on whichever match he is watching. He is well-known on the programme for his highly excitable nature, propensity for comical gaffes and tendency to come out with unusual sayings that baffle host Jeff Stelling and the other studio pundits. In April 2022, he announced he would be stepping down from Sky Sports at the end of the season, after working on Soccer Saturday for 24 years.\n\nChris Kamara Anti Racism Campaigner\n\nAs a player, he suffered years of severe racial abuse and in part, as a result, Chris was inducted into the ‘Show Racism the Red Card Hall of Fame’.\n\nAs well as being an Ambassador for Marie Curie Cancer Care, Chris became an Ambassador of the Special Olympics Great Britain and was also one of the runners of the Olympic torch in Doncaster.\n\nChris is also a passionate singer and released a charity single in 2012 for the England Team’s tournament song for the European Championships that year. He also released his debut album ‘Here’s to Christmas’ in 2019, which reached number eight in the charts. This was followed by a second Christmas album in 2020.\n\nChris Kamara TV Broadcaster & Presenter\n\nAway from sport, he co-presented Ninja Warrior UK (2015-2019) alongside Ben Shephard and singer Rochelle Humes. In 2015, he also took part in ITV’s Give a Pet a Home series which worked alongside Birmingham’s branch of the RSPCA. He also appeared in a cameo of himself in the award-winning show Ted Lasso in 2021.\n\nElsewhere in the media, he has a hugely popular persona having appeared in 8 Out of 10 Cats (2012; 2016), The Great Sport Relief Bake Off (2016), Celebrity Juice (2015-2017), Loose Women (2016), Celebrity Storage Hunters (2016), Ant & Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway (2017), Harry Hill’s Alien Fun Capsule (2017), The Keith & Paddy Picture Show (2017), Room 101 (2018), Through the Keyhole (2018), Catchphrase (2018) and The Crystal Maze (2018).\n\nClients have included Vauxhall, Ladbrokes, Heineken, Nationwide and SKY.\n\nIn early 2022, after appearing to slur his words during a live broadcast, Chris reported that he was suffering from Apraxia of Speech, a condition that affects how the mouth works and how words form, sometimes preventing the person from speaking at all. Determined to beat the condition and continue working, Chris Kamara is available for limited bookings."
