        "text": "New Orleans Pelicans executive vice president David Griffin doesn’t spend his time hiding under a rock. In fact, he’s very aware of what’s said about his team. It should come as no surprise then that the 50-year-old directly addressed a common criticism of his roster when answering questions about how he plans to continue shaping his team.\n\n“I know everybody thinks we have to invest in the center position a little bit,” Griffin acknowledges.\n\n“We actually are really excited about what we have now. We are excited to play small and fast.”\n\nDavid Griffin Reveals Pelicans’ Big Desire For Next Season\n\nFrankly, the Pelicans have little choice but to emphasize pace next season.\n\nThe addition of Dejounte Murray didn’t just bring in a player who could zip the ball around the court. If New Orleans wanted a low-usage floor general, they could have targeted the likes of Kyle Lowry, Tyus Jones, and Kris Dunn in free agency. Instead, they added a lead guard who loves to score.\n\n“I think when you look at what we did last year and the things we struggled with in terms of closing out close games, one of the things we’re most excited about with Dejounte is that’s something that’s he’s really comfortable with… He’s going to put people in position to succeed whether he’s the one taking the shot or creating for somebody else…” — David Griffin\n\nThis could lead to Murray stepping on the toes of CJ McCollum, Brandon Ingram, or Zion Williamson. After all, there’s only one ball. However, teams with multiple high-octane scorers avoid that pitfall by playing faster. In the halfcourt, this requires quicker decision-making and ball-movement. The ability to create turnovers becomes more important because defensive events and fastbreak opportunities energy the team while generating easy points.\n\nAs a result, a lead-footed center like Jonas Valanciunas would’ve become a square peg in a round hole. Instead, the Pelicans need a big man like Yves Missi, the 21st overall pick in the 2024 NBA Draft. At 6-foot-11, Missi’s fluidity and explosiveness make him a terrific rim-runner. In the open court, the 20-year-old gets up and down the court like a gazelle, helping New Orleans play fast.\n\nDaniel Theis, who the Pelicans signed last week, isn’t winning any track meets. However, he’s surprisingly light on his feet, so he can play at a quicker pace. Indeed, due to his experience and ability to stretch the floor, he may start the season.\n\nYes, they’re still a young team. To that point, Missi’s youth and upside fit the bill in New Orleans. Nonetheless, the Pelicans are now a legitimate playoff contender. As a result, Theis’s background holds weight, the German big man having played 40 postseason games for the Boston Celtics.\n\nWhether they start Missi or Theis, they should be tough to beat though. In the end, the strength of the team lies in their Big Four. Murray, McCollum, Ingram, and Williamson’s production can match that of any team’s stars. If their chemistry holds up, the West may see another surprise team making a championship run."
