        "text": "Following Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans' NBA team, the Hornets, were forced to relocate temporarily to Oklahoma City. The team played the 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 seasons in Oklahoma City as the New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets. The team featured Chris Paul at point guard, who would win the NBA Rookie of the Year award during the Hornets' first year in Oklahoma City. Aside from a handful of games played in Louisiana, the majority of the games during the '05-'06 and '06-'07 seasons were played at the Ford Center, now known as Chesapeake Arena. The Hornets posted a record of 77 - 87 during their two seasons in Oklahoma City. Shortly after the Hornets returned to New Orleans, Oklahoma City would get its own permanent NBA team when the Seattle Supersonics relocated to Oklahoma City as the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Thunder began playing in Oklahoma City at the beginning of the 2008-2009 season at the arena formerly occupied by the Hornets."
