Over his career he played for 9 teams across the English leagues, making 641 appearances and scoring 71 goals from defensive and midfield positions.\n\nHe currently presents \"Goals on Sunday\" on Sky Sports but is most famous for his hilarious live match analysis on \"Soccer Saturday\" and catchphrase \"Unbelievable Jeff!\"\n\nAppearances in Games\n\nChris Kamara's Street Soccer\n\nReleased in September 2000, Chris Kamara's Street Soccer was a 5-a-side football game where national teams would play in weird and zaney locations including on top of a skyscraper or the inside of a castle. Kammy was involved heavily with the production, recording motion-capture for the game and lending his voice to the games commentary.\n\nThis is Football 2005\n\nKammy was co-commentator alongside Peter Drury."
