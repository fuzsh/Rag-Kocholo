        "text": "Chris Kamara MBE is to be awarded Freedom of the City in recognition for his services to charity and the city of Wakefield.\n\nThe ex-professional football player and punditry national treasure will be presented with the honour by Wakefield Council on Wednesday 15 May.\n\nChris Kamara MBE said: “When I got the call, I just couldn’t believe it. Freedom of the City for Shakey Wakey – unbelievable!\n\n“I have lived in Wakefield longer than anywhere else. We came here in 1990 and 34 years later we are still here. The people and the places are amazing, and we will never leave Wakefield. All my family are here and it will always be our home.\n\n“That is why this means so much to me, I’m blown away by it.”\n\nHe has been involved in raising millions for many charities over the years, including for Show Racism the Red Card and as a national ambassador for Marie Curie.\n\nIn recent years, Chris has been instrumental in raising awareness for apraxia after being diagnosed with the condition himself in 2022.\n\nThe Mayor of Wakefield, Cllr Josie Pritchard, will present the award at the civic ceremony followed by a private reception in his honour.\n\n“Chris is a local and national legend and an inspiration to so many people. We are absolutely delighted to be giving him the highest honour we can bestow – Freedom of the City.\n\n“He has been a massive supporter of many charities, raising millions and making a difference to the lives of many. Locally, he is an active supporter of Wakefield Hospice, Andy’s Man Club and Pinderfields Hospital, to name but a few.”\n\nDuring his 20-year football career, Chris played for nine English professional clubs. He made a combined 641 appearances for Bradford City, Leeds United, Sheffield United, Middlesbrough, Portsmouth, Swindon Town, Stoke City, Luton Town and Brentford, scoring 71 goals and gaining 3 promotions. He then went on to manage Bradford City and Stoke City a total of 126 times, leading Bradford to promotion in 1996.\n\nHis personality and enthusiasm made him a household favourite as a presenter and football analyst on Sky Sports from 1998 to 2022. In particular he was a mainstay on Soccer Saturday between 1999 and 2022, bringing games to life with a unique turn of phrase, including infamously observing Spurs players were ‘fighting like beavers’ during a derby match with Arsenal.\n\nChris was appointed MBE in the 2023 New Year Honours list for services to football, anti-racism and charity.\n\nFreedom of the City is the highest honour Wakefield Council can give to an individual or organisation that has served in some exceptional capacity. It is a ceremonial recognition of their role and the contribution they have made.\n\nPrevious recipients of the honour include former chairman of the Rugby Football League, Sir Rodney Walker, Wakefield Trinity legend Neil Fox MBE and The 3rd Battalion The Rifles Regiment.\n\nThe ceremony can be watched live at www.youtube.com/@WakefieldCouncilWMDC/streams"
