NEW ORLEANS - Former Central Michigan University star Chris Kaman made his New Orleans Hornets debut Wednesday and made a good first impression in the Hornets 95-80 exhibition win over the Memphis Grizzlies.

Kaman, a 7-foot center, scored 18 points in 23 minutes, adding four rebounds.

Kaman joined the Hornets, along with Eric Gordon and Al-Farouq Aminu in a trade with the Los Angeles Clippers for guard Chris Paul.

Kaman hit five of his first nine shots. He played in the NBA All-Star Game two years ago, but missed 50 games with a variety of injuries last season.
