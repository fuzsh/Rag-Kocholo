        "text": "Morning Star is the 292nd episode of the Fairy Tail anime, and the 15th episode of the 2018 series.\n\nAs the battle rages throughout the entirety of Magnolia, the Fairy Tail Mages continue their fight for their guild's survival. As Erza and Ajeel clash once again, the Fairy Queen reaches new limits to save her friends and finally puts an end to the Desert King.\n\nSummary[]\n\nWhile the Flying Dragon Squad continues to fight Ajeel's land troops at the outskirts of Magnolia, Gray and Juvia engage the invading Wall Squad that managed to infiltrate the town. Suddenly, the Strauss Siblings appear to the latters' aid and join the fray. Mirajane then activates her newest form, Satan Soul: Mirajane Seilah, much to Gray's and Juvia's astonishment, and curses the Alvarez soldiers to sleep, before deciding to physically throttle the rest. Unphased, Wall instantly recognizes the enemy's powers as the Curse, Macro, calmly remarking that it's simply one of his Emperor's toys. Back at the Alvarez Empire's main fleet, Ajeel continues to dehydrate Erza with his Sand Magic, with the Fairy Tail Mage unable to use herMagic. At the guildbuilding, Mavis orders a distraught Warren to hurry the Osprey Squad to aid Erza. When the telepathic Mage doesn't respond due to his immense fear, Max shouts at him, claiming that they are all afraid but they still need to continue their fight, prompting Warren to recollect himself and contact the Osprey Squad, who informs him that the Magical Convergent Cannon: Jupiter will be ready in five more minutes.\n\nAt Lucy's Apartment, the Shield of Spriggan, Brandish μ demands that Lucy joins her in the bath, to which Lucy heatedly protests, but then reluctantly heeds out of fear of her foe's Magic. With both in the bathtub, Brandish toys with Lucy for a while before wondering where she might have seen the Fairy Tail Mage before, and then tells the Celestial Mage to wash her back. Unexpectedly, Brandish questions if Lucy was Layla's daughter, and upon receiving confirmation, begins shrinking the house. As Lucy barely manages to make her escape, she's confronted by the Spriggan 12 member outside of the now-dollhouse-sized house, just to be saved by the arrival of Cana. After incapacitating Marin Hollow and dispelling his Rules of the Area, Lucy dons her Star Dress: Aries Form and prepares to fight Brandish alongside Cana. With her Requip once again activated, Erza requips into her Wind God Armor, dissipating the sand surrounding her and charges at Ajeel, who remains unharmed after the attack.\n\nAfter defeating the first wave of enemies, the Dragon Slayers rest as they watch more reinforcements descend onto them. A seemingly-defeated Bakel then delivers a sneak attack at Natsu, which proves ineffective as the Fire Dragon Slayer sends the Alvarez soldiers flying and crashing through Ajeel's ship, much to the latter's surprise. This prompts Erza to continue her fight and finally land a blow at her opponent, puzzling him, as he states that no sword should be able to cut him and continues to attach the Fairy Tail Mage. Erza, however, reveals that both her Sea King Sword and Wind God Sword can cut through his sand, stating that his Magic has a multitude of weaknesses. This prompts Ajeel to activate his Sand World, engulfing the entire town with his sand. As the Fairy Tail Mages are caught in the sandstorm, Bisca reveals that even though Jupiter have been readied, she can't aim in such weather. Back at Kardia Cathedral, Evergreen questions if Fried could empower his Jutsu Shiki to keep the sand blizzard at bay, to which he replies that he can't as he's at the limit of his Magic Power. Back to the fight, Ajeel boastfully welcomes Erza to his Sand World, the place where he's \"God\".\n\nAjeel then grabs Erza's neck and begins draining her moisture, while teasing her to revere him as a deity. True to her name, the Fairy Queen refuses, claiming that her guild would never fear him and quickly changes into the Morning Star Armor, creating a light signal in the sandstorm. As Ajeel moves to behead his enemy, he is ultimately hit by Bisca's Jupiter blast. Taking her chance, Erza dons the Nakagami Armor and finishes off the Desert King with her Nakagami Starlight, cancelling out Sand World and destroying the enemy's ship.\n\nCharacters in Order of Appearance[]\n\nBattles & Events[]\n\nErza Scarlet vs. Ajeel Raml (concluded)\n\nMagic, Spells, and Abilities used[]\n\nMagic used[]\n\nSword Magic (剣の魔法 Ken no Mahō)\n\nSpatial Magic (空間魔法 Kūkan Mahō)\n\nRequip (換装魔法 Kansō Mahō)\n\nThe Knight (騎士(ザ・ナイト) Za Naito)\n\nRules of the Area (空間の掟 Kūkan no Okite)\n\nCelestial Spirit Magic (星霊魔法 Seirei Mahō)\n\nSand Magic (砂の魔法 Suna no Mahō)\n\nDragon Slayer Magic (滅竜魔法 Metsuryū Mahō)\n\nFire Dragon Slayer Magic (炎の滅竜魔法 Honō no Metsuryū Mahō)\n\nSky Dragon Slayer Magic (天の滅竜魔法 Ten no Metsuryū Mahō)\n\nIron Dragon Slayer Magic (鉄の滅竜魔法 Tetsu no Metsuryū Mahō)\n\nTransformation Magic ((変身魔法 Henshin Mahō)\n\nMolding Magic (造形魔法 Zōkei Mahō)\n\nIce-Make (氷の造形魔法(アイスメイク) Aisu Meiku)\n\nTake Over (接収(テイクオーバー) Teiku Ōbā)\n\nAnimal Soul (アニマルソウル Animaru Sōru)\n\nSatan Soul (サタンソール Satan Sōru)\n\nBattle Mode Shift (戦闘モードシフト Sentō Mōdo Shifuto)\n\nThought Projection (思念体 Shinentai)\n\nTelepathy (念話(テレパシー) Terepashī)\n\nCommand T (コマンドＴ(ティー) Komando Tī)\n\nLetter Magic (文字魔法 Moji Mahō)\n\nJutsu Shiki (術式 Jutsu Shiki)\n\nCurses Used[]\n\nMacro (命令(マクロ) Makuro)\n\nSpells used[]\n\nMoon Flash (黒羽・月閃 Kureha: Gessen)\n\nFire Dragon's Iron Fist (火竜の鉄拳 Karyū no Tekken)\n\nSky Dragon's Roar (天竜の咆哮 Tenryū no Hōkō)\n\nIron Dragon's Club (鉄竜棍 Tetsuryūkon)\n\nAnimal Soul: Harpy\n\nSatan Soul: Mirajane Seilah (ミラジェーン・セイラ Mirajēn Seira)\n\nCommand T: Reduction (〝縮小〟 Shukushō)\n\nStar Dress (星霊衣(スタードレス) Sutā Doresu)\n\nStar Dress: Aries Form (アリエスフォーム Ariesu Fōmu)\n\nSand World (砂の世界(サンドワールド) Sando Wārudo)\n\nSand Form\n\nRaml Sayf (砂の剣(ラムル・セイフ) Ramuru Seifu)\n\nRaml Fa'as (砂の斧(ラムル・ファアス) Ramuru Fāsu)\n\nNakagami Starlight (天一神・星彩 Nakagami Seisai)\n\nWord Enchantment\n\nAbilities used[]\n\nFlight\n\nSwordsmanship\n\nHand-to-Hand Combat\n\nWeapons used[]\n\nSea King Sword (海王の剣 Kaiō no Ken)\n\nWind God Sword (風神の剣 Fūjin no Ken)\n\nMagical Convergent Cannon: Jupiter (魔導収束砲 ジュピター Mahō Shūsoku Hō: Jupitā)\n\nArmors used[]\n\nHeaven's Wheel Armor (天輪の鎧 Tenrin no Yoroi)\n\nBlack Wing Armor (黒羽の鎧 Kureha no Yoroi)\n\nWind God Armor (風神の鎧 Fūjin no Yoroi)\n\nMorning Star Armor (明星の鎧 Myōjō no Yoroi)\n\nNakagami Armor (天一神の鎧 Nakagami no Yoroi)\n\nItems used[]\n\nMagic Radar (魔導レーダー Mahō Rēdā)\n\nCruiser Battleship (型巡注艦 Kata-jun Chū-kan)\n\nMusica Sword (ムジカの剣 Mujika no Ken)\n\nMagic Cards\n\nManga & Anime Differences[]\n\nWhen escaping the shrinking house Lucy had a towel in the anime as opposed to being naked in the manga.\n\nBrandish's nail polish in the anime is pink compared to the manga whereas it's purple.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThe map of the battlefield presented in the episode was a reference to the cover of Chapter 456.\n\nNavigation[]\n\nAvatar arc Alvarez arc Water Dragon God arc\n\n← Chapters → 438 | 439 | 440 | 441 | 442 | 443 | 444 | 445 | 446 | 447 | 448 | 449 | 450 | 451 | 452 | 453 | 454 | 455 | 456 | 457 | 458 | 459 | 460 | 461 | 462 | 463 | 464 | 465 | 466 | 467 | 468 | 469 | 470 | 471 | 472 | 473 | 474 | 475 | 476 | 477 | 478 | 479 | 480 | 481 | 482 | 483 | 484 | 485 | 486 | 487 | 488 | 489 | 490 | 491 | 492 | 493 | 494 | 495 | 496 | 497 | 498 | 499 | 500 | 501 | 502 | 503 | 504 | 505 | 506 | 507 | 508 | 509 | 510 | 511 | 512 | 513 | 514 | 515 | 516 | 517 | 518 | 519 | 520 | 521 | 522 | 523 | 524 | 525 | 526 | 527 | 528 | 529 | 530 | 531 | 532 | 533 | 534 | 535 | 536 | 537 | 538 | 539 | 540 | 541 | 542 | 543 | 544 | 545"
