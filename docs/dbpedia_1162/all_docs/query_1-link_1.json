        "meta_description": "On this week's episode hosts Aviv and Matt view and review this absolutely fucking bonkers episode of SVU, season 13 episode 20 - Father Dearest! James Vanderbeek is in this episode and the guys cannot figure out what the fuck this guys plan is in this episode! IT'S INSANE! Matt invites Aviv to dance in a creepy as shit way, and the guys are both back in on SVU after the insanity of this episode. It's week one of Aviv's unemployment and its revealed that Aviv was not as good at hiding the fact he hated the job as he thought he was. Aviv shares an eat shit story, Matt is potentially podcasting naked (who can say!?) because it is hot as fuck in the PNW. The guys revive the bit of asking Matt's mom's question so send those in. All this and more!\n\nGive us a rate and review wherever fine podcasts are sold, tweet at us @svupodcast (which we cannot stress enough is the official Twitter handle of Law and Order SVU, and you can take that to the bank, the blood bank senator!) and for longer or weirder stuff, or tweet sized emails because fuck Elon Musk, send us an email specialviewingunit@gmail.com",
