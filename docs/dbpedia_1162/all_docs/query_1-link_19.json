        "text": "Mike and Dan react the Islanders’ season-ending 6-3 loss to the Hurricanes, and all the bad luck and blood-from-a-stone tries they saw throughout the series.\n\nAfter a disastrous start (including a penalty shot awarded to the worst possible player), the Islanders’ clawed their way back into the game by scoring twice in the second period. But the clean slate wasn’t enough for The Hockey Gods, who gifted Carolina not one but two lucky bounce goals in eight seconds that left the generally unorganized visitors reeling and with little time to counter.\n\nThe game ended up being a microcosm of the Islanders’ absurdly volatile season, which is almost as unfathomable as it was difficult to watch.\n\nWe’ll save the offseason discussion for the next episode and throughout the summer.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nSubscribe to our Patreon!
