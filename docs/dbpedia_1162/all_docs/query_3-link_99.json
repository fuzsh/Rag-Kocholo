        "text": "The Ultimate Guide to Citing Anything in Chicago Style\n\nEverything you ever needed to know about citing sources from the Chicago Manual of Style\n\nThe Basics of Citing in Chicago Style\n\nThe Chicago Manual of Style, currently in its 16th edition, was created to help researchers properly cite their sources. There are two types of referencing styles in Chicago: 1) Notes and Bibliography and 2) Author-Date.\n\nThis guide displays the Notes and Bibliography style of referencing and is not associated with the official publishers of the style.\n\nNeed help with other styles? Our thorough MLA format and APA format guides are available for all of your writing and citing needs!\n\nCreating a Bibliography in Chicago Style\n\nThe bibliography is a list of all the sources used in the paper. The list includes the important publication details of the sources. The bibliography must also follow this format:\n\nThe citation list or bibliography must be single spaced.\n\nThe last names of the authors must be arranged alphabetically.\n\nThe second line of the source must be indented.\n\nExamples of Citing Different Sources in Chicago Style\n\nGenerally, Chicago citations require:\n\nAuthor\n\nTitle of book/article\n\nTitle of newspaper/journal\n\nPublication year\n\nPublication month and date\n\nPublisher\n\nCity of publication\n\nDate of access\n\nPage numbers\n\nURL or Name of Database\n\nHow to Create Footnotes and Endnotes for Chicago Style\n\nIf you’re wondering how to format Chicago in-text citations, Notes and Bibliography formatting requires writers to use footnotes and endnotes. These footnotes and endnotes acknowledge the different sources used in the work.\n\nWhen a source is used in a research paper, a roman numeral is placed at the end of the borrowed information as superscript (it is smaller than the normal line of text and raised). That number correlates with a footnote or endnote.\n\nFootnotes are found at the bottom of the page\n\nEndnotes are added at the end of the chapter or project\n\nA footnote or endnote contains the complete citation information\n\nThe matching number in the footnote or endnote is normal sized and not raised\n\nIt is up to the discretion of the writer to either place the citation at the bottom of the page where the superscript is placed (a footnote) or to place all citations together at the end of the work (endnotes)\n\nExample:\n\nOne would wonder, \"Would young Einstein be characterized as belonging somewhere on the autism spectrum? Would Erdos have been given a diagnosis of A.D.H.D.?\" ¹\n\nChicago style footnotes are placed at the bottom of the page:\n\nSilver, Nate. \"Beautiful Minds.\" The New York Times. July 13, 2013. Accessed August 04, 2015. http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/books/review/the-boy-who-loved-math-and-on-a-beam-of-light.html?ref=books&_r=0.\n\nIf a source is used more than once in a research project, follow these guidelines:\n\nWhen used again, instead of writing out the complete citation for a second time in the footnote, only include: the author’s last name, the title or a phrase for the title (if it’s more than four words), and the page number(s) that were used. This will reduce the bulk of citation information in the paper.\n\nExample:\n\nCohen, Micah, \"Rubio is Losing Support Among Republican Voters.\" FiveThirtyEight. July 09, 2013. Accessed August 04, 2015. http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rubio-is-losing-support-among-republican-voters/\n\nWolf, Leon H. \"Marco Rubio's Campaign Must Adapt or Die.\" RedState. August 04, 2015. Accessed August 04, 2015. http://www.redstate.com/2015/08/04/marco-rubios-campaign-must-adapt-die/.\n\nCohen, \"Rubio Losing Support\"\n\nIf a source is used consecutively, follow these guidelines for shortened citation and ibid:\n\nIf you are citing the same source continually throughout your text, use a shortened version of the full citation in your footnotes.\n\nPrevious versions of the style used the abbreviation “ibid,” short for “ibidem.” Ibidem is a Latin word that means “in the same place.” It was used when referring to a source that was just cited within a document (without other sources in between). Writers would use ibid instead of writing out the source information again. This was meant to save space since it’s fewer characters than citing the source again.\n\nIn the current version of Chicago, the 17th version, ibid is accepted but not preferred. This is because ibid requires readers to go back and search for the previous source cited, an inconvenience which outweighs the benefits of shortening the citation. Also, shortened citations are compact, so using ibid doesn’t always save line space.\n\nShortened citations\n\nThe first mention of a source should include all relevant information (e.g., full author name(s), full title, publisher, date published, etc.).\n\nSubsequent mentions should be a shortened version using this formula:\n\nLast Name, Title of the Work, page number(s).\n\nMentions after the shortened form can use the abbreviated formula:\n\nLast Name, page number(s).\n\nIf there are two or three authors, list their full names in the order they appear in the source. If there are more than three authors, list the first author’s name followed by “et al.”\n\nExamples of using shortened citations (preferred format in the 17th Edition):\n\nPhilip R. Cateora et al., International Marketing (New York: McGraw Hill, 2020), 292-294.\n\nCateora et al., International Marketing, 28-29.\n\nCateora et al., 28-29.\n\nCateora et al., 377.\n\nLong titles that are more than four words are usually shortened. Focus on keeping key words from the title and omitting any beginning “a” or “the.” Examples:\n\nAnd to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street = Mulberry Street\n\nFried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe = Fried Green Tomatoes\n\nIbid\n\nIf you are using the discontinued ibid notation, here are a few guidelines:\n\nWhen the same source is used consecutively, instead of typing in the citation information again, use the abbreviation “ibid.” Add the page numbers immediately following.\n\nIf the same source AND same page number are used consecutively, simply write “Ibid.”\n\nSame example above, but using ibid:\n\nPhilip R. Cateora et al, International Marketing (New York: McGraw Hill, 2020), 292-294.\n\nCateora et al., International Marketing, 28-29.\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid., 45.\n\nAnother example with two sources that were mentioned earlier in the text:\n\nAnthony Doerr, All the Light We Cannot See (New York: Scribner, 2014), 82-84.\n\nTatiana de Rosnay, Sarah's Key (New York: St. Martin’s Press, 2007), 24-27.\n\nIbid., 44.\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid., 133-134.\n\nDoerr, All the Light We Cannot See, 397-401.\n\nIbid., 405.\n\nIbid., 411.\n\nFor further clarification on the Chicago in-text citation style of footnotes and endnotes, consult the Chicago Manual of Style's website. This site is full of helpful pages, so if you’re tempted to head to Google to type in, “in-text citations Chicago,” take a peek at the official site first.\n\nCreating Your Citations in Chicago Style\n\nAs mentioned, when you're following The Chicago Manual of Style, you'll be required to create a list of all sources used in your paper. Even though full bibliographic information can be found in the footnotes and endnotes, it is still acceptable, and often required by instructors, to create a bibliography. The bibliography is placed at the end of an assignment.\n\nHow to Cite a Print Book in Chicago Style\n\nIn the footnotes and endnotes:\n\nFirst name Last name, Title of Book (Publication Place: Publisher, Year), page range.\n\nIn the bibliography:\n\nLast name, First name.
