Hosting workshops for other like-minded professionals is a great reminder of that. I feel extremely lucky to be able to spend my days championing wellbeing, at work and beyond, and I always meet amazing people along the way. Of course, it has been a lot of hard work over the past few years too. Getting to speak about everything that I have learned makes it all worth it. I passionately believe that there is a need for what we are developing because I know first-hand how our wellbeing solution can change people's lives. I am not exaggerating; prioritising your wellbeing on a daily basis can literally change your life! It was great to shine a spotlight on employee and workplace wellbeing today; sharing workplace challenges, ideas and accomplishments with each other. Connecting with others who are also wellbeing advocates is my idea of a perfect day! Thanks to all that attended and participated - and here's to many more.

Fostering a positive company culture through employee wellbeing is essential. Recognising and appreciating our employees consistently can prevent increased stress and turnover, saving the company significant costs. Let's always appreciate and recognise our employees. Today, I'm starting my day with an iced latte as I head into meetings. It's the little things that make a big difference. #WorldWellBeingWeek #EmployeeWellbeing #CompanyCulture #EmployeeRecognition #WorkLifeBalance #MentalHealthMatters #WellnessAtWork\n\nIn today's dynamic work environment, emotional safety is a critical component of employee wellbeing. According to Safe Work Australia research, workplaces that prioritise emotional safety experience a 22% increase in employee loyalty and commitment. When employees feel valued and secure, they are 40% more likely to recommend their workplace to others. To learn more about how to foster emotional safety in your workplace, check out our COSpedia article to create a thriving, secure, and high-performing work environment. #emotionalsafety #safetyatwork #mentalhealth https://hubs.ly/Q02m0L1C0\n\nNina Hospitality, a part of the Chinachem Group, is setting a new standard for employee wellbeing. Starting 1st October 2023, all eligible employees will be granted two days of well-being leave. This step underscores their belief in nurturing personal well-being and work-life balance. This new benefit, a testament to Nina's status as a 'caring company', allows employees to prioritise their families, further their education, or simply indulge in self-care. Haley Chan, the Group Director of HR at Nina Hospitality, believes this initiative will foster a more engaged and motivated workforce, driving the company's success.
