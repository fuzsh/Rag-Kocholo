After her father died in 1061, her mother remarried to Robert I, Count of Flanders. In 1072 her stepfather concluded a peace treaty with King Philip. As part of the terms of the treaty Bertha was married to Philip.\n\nNine years passed before Bertha produced the desired son and heir, Louis. Reportedly, her fertility was only restored thanks to the prayers of a hermit, Arnoul, who also named the child.\n\nIn 1092, Philip repudiated Bertha, alleging that she was too fat. He confined her to the fortress of Montreuil-sur-Mer, and took up with Bertrade de Montfort, the countess of Anjou.\n\nChildren\n\nTogether, Philip and Bertha had five children:\n\nConstance, married Hugh I of Champagne before 1097 and then, after her divorce, to Bohemund I of Antioch in 1106\n\nLouis (1 December 10811 August 1137)\n\nHenry (b. 1083) (died young)\n\nCharles (b. 1085) abbot of Charlieu Abbey\n\nEudes (10871096)\n\nSOURCES:\n\nAncestral Roots of Certain American Colonists Who Came to America Before 1700 by Frederick Lewis Weis, Lines: 101-23, 103-23.\n\nDuby, Georges.
