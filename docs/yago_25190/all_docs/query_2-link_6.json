His reign, like that of most of the early Direct Capetians, was extraordinarily long for the time. The monarchy began a modest recovery from the low it reached in the reign of his father and he added to the royal demesne the Vexin and Bourges.\n\nLife\n\nPhilip was the son of Henry I and Anne of Kiev. Unusually at the time for Western Europe, his name was of Greek origin, being bestowed upon him by his mother. Although he was crowned king at the age of seven,[2] until age fourteen (1066) his mother acted as regent, the first queen of France ever to do so. Her co-regent was Baldwin V of Flanders.\n\nPhilip first married Bertha, daughter of Floris I, Count of Holland, in 1072. Although the marriage produced the necessary heir, Philip fell in love with Bertrade de Montfort (see ancestor #428), the wife of Count Fulk IV of Anjou. He repudiated Bertha (claiming she was too fat) and married Bertrade on 15 May 1092. In 1094, he was excommunicated by Hugh, Archbishop of Lyon, for the first time; after a long silence, Pope Urban II repeated the excommunication at the Council of Clermont in November 1095. Several times the ban was lifted as Philip promised to part with Bertrade, but he always returned to her, and after 1104, the ban was not repeated. In France, the king was opposed by Bishop Ivo of Chartres, a famous jurist.\n\nPhilip appointed Alberic first Constable of France in 1060. A great part of his reign, like his father's, was spent putting down revolts by his power-hungry vassals. In 1077, he made peace with William the Conqueror, who gave up attempting the conquest of Brittany. In 1082, Philip I expanded his demesne with the annexation of the Vexin. Then in 1100, he took control of Bourges.\n\nIt was at the aforementioned Council of Clermont that the First Crusade was launched. Philip at first did not personally support it because of his conflict with Urban II. The pope would not have allowed him to participate anyway, as he had reaffirmed Philip's excommunication at the said council. Philip's brother Hugh of Vermandois, however, was a major participant.\n\n\" Philip died in the castle of Melun and was buried per request at the monastery of Saint-Benoît-sur-Loire  and not in St Denis among his forefathers. He was succeeded by his son, Louis VI, whose succession was, however, not uncontested.\"\n\nAccording to Abbot Suger:\n\n\" King Philip daily grew feebler. For after he had abducted the Countess of Anjou, he could achieve nothing worthy of the royal dignity; consumed by desire for the lady he had seized, he gave himself up entirely to the satisfaction of his passion. So he lost interest in the affairs of state and, relaxing too much, took no care for his body, well-made and handsome though it was. The only thing that maintained the strength of the state was the fear and love felt for his son and successor. When he was almost sixty, he ceased to be king, breathing his last breath at the castle of Melun-sur-Seine, in the presence of the [future king] Louis... They carried the body in a great procession to the noble monastery of St-Benoît-sur-Loire, where King Philip wished to be buried; there are those who say they heard from his own mouth that he deliberately chose not to be buried among his royal ancestors in the church of St. Denis because he had not treated that church as well as they had, and because among so many noble kings his own tomb would not have counted for much.\"\n\nIssue\n\nPhilip's children with Bertha were:\n\nConstance, married Hugh I of Champagne before 1097 and then, after her divorce, to Bohemund I of Antioch in 1106\n\nLouis VI (1 December 1081  1 August 1137), King of the Franks\n\nHenry (b. 1083) (died young)\n\nOdo (10871096)\n\nPhilip's children with Bertrade were:\n\nPhilip, Count of Mantes (living 1123)\n\nFleury, Seigneur of Nangis (1093  July 1119)[3]\n\nCecile of France, married Tancred, Prince of Galilee; married secondly Pons of Tripoli\n\nNOTES:\n\n1 Kings of France\n\n2 History Today, Philip I Crowned King of France\n\n3 Europäische Stammtafeln XIV 146 les seigneurs de Nangis2\n\nNote on Marriage to Bertha OF HOLLAND\n\nrepudiated because he fell in love with Bertrade de Montfort (#428)\n\nSources\n\n1Weis, Frederick Lewis & Sheppard, Walter Lee, Jr, \"Ancestral Roots of Certain American Colonists Who Came to America before 1700: Lineages from Alfred the Great, Charlemagne, Malcolm of Scotland, Robert the Strong, and other Historical Individuals\". p 105, 101-23."
