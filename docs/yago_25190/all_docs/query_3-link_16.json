The first six years of his reign were spent under the regency of his mother and his uncle. Philip's reign was troubled by many clashes with his powerful vassals, particularly in Normandy, but he succeeded in enlarging his dominions. Philip was excommunicated in 1095 because he had repudiated his wife, Bertha of Holland, and married Bertrada, the wife of the count of Anjou."
