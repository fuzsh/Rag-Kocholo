        "text": "Most of the names on this page are original, but some are from the \"Credits\" page at the Car Talk web site and a few others were submitted by site visitors.\n\nYou are welcome to send me funny names to add to this list, but note that I post only names that could be real. So please don't be the hundredth person to send me Amanda Huginkiss, since that is not a real last name. And I have enough \"Dick\" names and other bawdy names. Please, no more! Same for Wayne King - it's just not that funny.\n\nThere's one exception to my \"must be real\" rule. My friend, jazz drummer Adam Nussbaum, submitted the hilarious list of \"Big Band\" names at the bottom of this page.\n\nEric Oliver sent a boat-load of funny names, and they're in a group farther down the page.\n\nThis page has some pretty good ones too: With a Name Like That\n\nAlso see my People I'd Like to Know page and my Smileys collection.\n\nThanks to the advertisers who help support this web site:\n\nhttps://www.essaylib.com is a professional essay writing service which helps busy students with academic papers 24/7.\n\nMy friend and New Milford, CT neighbor Mark Weiss is a fantastic video producer and audio engineer, and I learned a lot while assisting him as a cameraman at live concerts ranging from rock bands to symphony orchestras. If you need someone to do a truly professional job for your wedding video or corporate event using state of the art equipment, please visit his Video Production web site. Mark also repairs electronic equipment including hi-fi and tube gear, among other related services.\n\nThese funny names come from many professions, whether you're a doctor, a race car driver, an artist, or an athlete. These unique names have their own unique logos, and you can even try to customize your own name or work into an enamel pin, which will become your personalized representative. The enamel pin looks very beautiful and can be worn on clothes or backpacks. You can customize it from EnamelPins Inc and they can provide this service for you.\n\nFunny Names\n\nAdam Baum\n\nAdam Zapel\n\nAl Bino\n\nAl Dente\n\nAl Fresco\n\nAl K. Seltzer\n\nAlf A.

In a neighboring town, many years ago, a family named Teed had two sons, whom they named Warren and Garren. Finally, in our local phone book is a listing which appears as 'Miss, Kris' which, of course, would make her name 'Kris Miss.'

He wasn't amused.\"\n\nFrom Cynthia Purdy: \"I know a girl named Isabelle-Marie Maddon. She married a guy whose last name is Kersing. In Quebec, we are not allowed to drop our maiden names, but it's acceptable to hyphenate our married names. So now her name is I.M. Maddon-Kersing (I am mad and cursing).\"\n\nFrom Christiana Hundley: \"I saw your list and I have to add Dr. Harry Bear in Richmond, VA, Dr. Smiley, DDS in Chesterfield, VA, and Mrs. Clara Fiddler, my elementary school music teacher, John Strange Elementary in Indianapolis, IN\"\n\nFrom Jim Ware: \"I'm JR Ware. We have an A Ware and a B Ware in our family. When I was in the Air Force, Sgt. and Mrs. Hohole named their kid Ophelia. Poor girl.\"\n\nFrom Jeremy Mays: \"Being in the military we get some pretty funny names with the ranks.\n\nMajor Payne - Yes he worked at the hospital.\n\nCaptain Hook - A friend's officer in charge of his section.\n\nColonel Sergeant - My base commander in Korea. To me it's funny because a Colonel is an officer and a Sergeant is enlisted.\"\n\nFrom Molly Shackleford: \"When I worked at the Smithfield Police Department, in Smithfield, VA, I had the chance to work with a Detective named Burt Nurney. He would get audibly frustrated (over the police radio) if anyone said his name too fast. I gathered that he was not a fan of Sesame Street.\"\n\nFrom Dawn Epstein: \"I worked for Centronics in the late 70s to early 80s, and we had an electronic parts representative whose name was D.C. Current. He swore it was genuinely his birth name, and added that his father's name was 'A.C. Current, and they rectified the situation.'\"\n\nFrom Becky Friday: \"I have a couple actual names for you from the area where I live (Bay City, Michigan): Lester and Esther Festerling (married couple), Rusty and Sandy Pyles (married couple), Sonny & Rosie Holes (married couple), Weiner & Cox Law Firm (Detroit). PS: My last name is Friday, and when I was born, the nurses in the hospital tried talking my Mom and Dad into naming me \"Tuesday Friday,\" as Tuesday Weld was a popular actress then. Also, I have a sister-in-law named Jo Friday.\"\n\nFrom Doug Horton: \"I had a veterinary who was called Peter Nutt (P. Nutt) and his wife's name was Hazel.\"\n\nFrom Bena: \"There was a female private I used to know in Ottawa when I was in the military. Her name was Sheila Rose Richardson. She married a serviceman surnamed Hiscock and became Sheila Rose Hiscock.\"\n\nFrom Carol Dasseos: \"My mother told me about a girl in her elementary school who was named Etta Byrd. They used to tease her every time her name was called by saying, 'How did it taste?'\"\n\nFrom Cory Schaan: \"My last name is Schaan and my children are Olivia Newton Schaan and Elton Schaan.\"\n\nFrom Ricky Small: \"As you can see from my email, my name is Richard Allan Small. I'm actually the third. You can imagine the fun people had with my name. Eg. Small, Dick; Dick Small; Dicky Smalls. I always joke that \"Small, Dicks\" run in the family. I used to hate my name but now I embrace it, and it's fun to have a funny name if you have a good sense of humor.\n\nFrom someone who prefers to remain anonymous: \"My grandpa's name was John Oder, his son's name (my uncle) was also John Oder. To further terrorize the next generation my uncle named his first daughter Shelly Oder, thus all her life she has grown up being called Smelly Oder.\"\n\nFrom Randy Beecher Bacon II: \"From the time I've been young I have always been hassled about my name. My full name is Randy Beecher Bacon II (Beat Your Bacon). Yep, I am not the only one. My dad grew up with this interesting name and he decided that I was worthy of his namesake. When I was young it bothered me, but now it is nice to stand out, and a lot of people think its awesome for some reason, also.\"\n\nFrom Boyd L. Simonson: \"The driver of the truck, which moved our furniture from South Carolina to California in 1995, was named Stu D. Baker. He laughed about it, so it didn't bother him.\"\n\nFrom David Sellars: My wife Ruth's nickname was Dusty when I met her. She became Dusty Sellars. As a kid my den mother was Mavis Davis. I had a co-worker name Edric Chun (gotta say it kinda fast) whose nickname was Bone. I had to ask why they called him Bone. They told me, say his name kinda fast. There is a family here in Hawaii named Silva. They named one son Hiho and the other Quick (for real). One of my friend's sister in High School was Nancy Olmstead. She married a guy named Kim Yancy.\n\nFrom David Way: My brother, for years before he had kids swore he loved the name Noah. But when he did finally have a son, he could not pull the trigger and name him Noah Way.\n\nFrom Melody Goodnight: Real person, my mom, her name is Anita Goodnight. Her maiden name was Anita Bible, her mother's last name was Johnson, so had she not married my grandpa and still had my mother her name would/could have been Anita Johnson. My name is Melody Goodnight, obviously my maiden name which I took back when I divorced my ex-husband so that I could say ... wait for it ... I was always a goodnight ... lol. Always gets a giggle.\n\nFrom Jennifer Comeau: My ex-husbands great uncle's name was Otto Moe Beal. He passed away in the late 80's; he owned and operated a service station in Illinois. He begged relatives to name a daughter Snow Moe. Nope, didn't happen.\n\nFrom Katrina Kufrin: A girl a few years older than me in my hometown was Sandy Eigo. I worked at a university bookstore in the late 70's, the director was Harold Ball, he hung around with the ROTC guy, his name was Richard Head. Yes, they would introduce themselves as Dick Head and Harry Ball! While I was in the Navy, I often had to check ID cards, one that is memorable is Billy Hill, written on ID card as Hill, Billy.\n\nFrom Glenda Denny: I saw the list of funny names on your website and thought you might want to add my high school science teacher, Rod Tickle to the list. Yes, that is his real name.\n\nFrom Rick: Went to school with a girl named \"Robyn Crowe\" and a friend of mine married a girl named \"Candy Sweet,\" and no, it's not a stage name, she's actually as sweet as she can be pardon the pun. They met after high school in 1978 in Western NY outside Buffalo. I went to school with Robyn from 7th grade up. I also went with a girl from Kent Island whose name was Cathy or \"Kathy Semen\" who got married and took the surname \"Creme.\" So a \"very friendly\" \"free spirited,\" um, tartish very attractive young lady became \"Kathy Semen-Creme.\" Not one word of it a lie.\n\nFrom Robert Bolstad: Tobar, Nevada, pronounced \"To bar.\" Nothing remains of this town except building foundations. It was located on the Western Pacific Railroad mainline and was originally a construction town. These were the original knock-down towns; when the railroad construction moved further down the line, the proprietors simply disassembled their structures and moved on. Without exception, the first two businesses to set up shop were the houses of ill repute and the bars. One enterprising bar owner put up a sign with an arrow indicating the direction to his establishment. After the construction moved on, a few townspeople remained. Evidently a passing railroad inspector whose job consisted of naming all the new towns on the line saw this sign which had been left behind, and having a sense humor, named the town what he had read on the sign. A much more lucid account can be found in the book \"Portrait of a Silver Lady: The Train They Called the California Zephyr\" by Ted Benson and Bruce A. MacGregor.\n\nFrom William Richardson: I knew a girl back in high school, named Candy. She became engaged to a man with the last name Apple. Yup, Candy Apple!\n\nFrom Rick Cloud: My late father served in the navy with a guy named Brick Mason.\n\nFrom Roger Grupp\n\nI have created a fictional brass quintet, the Effenheimer Brass, that is all about funny names I have thought of. Virtually all of them are ones I conceived, and are plausible names:\n\nFelix Austead (feel exhausted)\n\nMary Ann Bright Trina Corder ($3.25)\n\nCarrie Couture (caricature)\n\nMike Czech (mic check)\n\nJoaquin DeFlores (walkin' the floors)\n\nMarguerite DeVille (Margaritaville)\n\nLindsay Doyle (linseed oil)\n\nNeil Dupre (kneel to pray)\n\nEmile Eaton (a meal eaten)\n\nKristie Hannity (Christianity)\n\nNina Levin (911)\n\nTy Malone (time alone)\n\nRosa Shore (rows ashore)\n\nWalt Smedley (waltz medley)\n\nReed Toomey (read to me)\n\nMy favorites are a little contrived: Doug Love-Fitzhugh (the glove fits you) and Zoe Mudgett Hertz (so much it hurts).\n\nFrom Kevin Ketvertis\n\nGood list of names. I've got a few names I didn't see.\n\nChicago Bears:\n\nDick Butkus\n\nEmery Morehead\n\nRon Cox\n\nBryan Cox\n\nRyan Wetnight\n\nPittsburgh Pirates: Johnny Dickshot\n\nQuebec Nordiques: Ron Tugnutt\n\nFrom Eric Oliver\n\nGrowing up, our next door neighbors were Larry and Sally Shade. Larry's brother married a girl named Kathy Lamp. When she married into the family, she couldn't resist hyphenating her last name, thus becoming Kathy Lamp-Shade.\n\nWhile I was in college, I fell ill and had to go visit Dr Kluck. Although he may sound like a bit like a quack, he was the best doctor I ever visited in college.\n\nIf you go to Duke Energy's web site you will see their legal team consists of Ruff and Manly:\n\nWould you like your clergy to be Rev. M. T. Head?\n\nEver know a good man? Now you do: Noah Goodman.\n\nYou must add I.P. Looney to your I.P. list.\n\nElaine Hew was survived by her sister, Annie Hew.\n\nRocky Stone founded the Hearing Loss Association of America - dare I say he was deaf as a stone?\n\nHarry Boyle kinda disgusts me.\n\nLet's don't forget the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee's girls basketball coach Sandy Botham.\n\nI've been told (but can't confirm) that my friend's father, David Sparks, is partners with Rich Burns and they sell fire insurance.\n\nI know a Simi Baer but we can't forget the rest of the clan: Norma Lee, Ima, Ted E., Teddi, Harry, Rhoda, and Stella.\n\nThere is a Dr. Cockburn, a urologist in Tampa, FL.\n\nArya Reddy?\n\nNames that should be real, but I have never met:\n\n* Ima Klotz and her sister, Sasha Klotz\n\n* Marv Ellis\n\n* Cole Durkee\n\n* Thor Luther\n\n* Mona Little, and after marriage Mona Little-Moore (or Mona Lott and Mona Lott-Moore)\n\n* Mark A. Roni\n\n* Dee Flower\n\n* Braxton Hicks\n\n* Michael Otto Nuys\n\n* M.T. Toombe\n\n* Ima Gaye-Barr\n\n* Manny Bones\n\n* Myra Mains\n\n* Dusty Carr\n\n* Mary Gold\n\n* Bob Sledd\n\nI worked with a guy that named his sons Hunter, Fisher, Trapper, and Skinner ... poor kids.\n\nI know you said no more bawdy names, but in college there were two girls that took more than their share of abuse. One of them was named Jenny Titsworth (and she took more than her share of those too). The other was Michelle Elaine Rector, aka Michelle E. Rector. I wouldn't share them if they weren't true...\n\nMy full name is Eric Paul Oliver, but until I was about 7 I was teased by my friends and called Eric P. All over. I trust my secret is safe with you. :-)\n\nBIG BAND NAMES\n\nDEWEY NEEDHAM & HIS JAZZ ORCH.\n\nTRUMPETS\n\nAl Tissimo (lead trumpet), Pops de Vane (old time 1st trumpet), Plenty Haitönen (1st trumpet Finland) Willy Makit or Kenny Makit (1st trumpet), Buster Bloodvessel (1st trumpet), Felix Cited, Howie Spitz, Ames Toulouse, Chops O'Gonagen (or Lips O' Gonagen), Ed Down, Rusty Piston, Buster Hinote, Diz Astor, Noah Count\n\nTROMBONES\n\nHy Register,Slip Shod,Willie Show, Bjent Slide, Adolf Tune, Mosley Late, Scott Noslide (on valve trombone), Terry Billnoise, Moe Zaic, Justin Tune, Lew Slips (bass trombone), Keith Myath, (toothless bass trombone)\n\nSAXOPHONES\n\nKenny Read - lead alto, Izzy Sharp - lead alto, Mosley Flat - 2nd alto, Les Tone - 2nd alto, Manny Notes - 1st tenor, Mai-Lik - Chinese 1st tenor, Reed Mylips - 1st tenor, Otto Tune - 2nd tenor, Ron Key - 2nd tenor, Lee King - 2nd tenor, Olaf Awhiskey - Swedish tenor, Mustafa Fix - Arabic tenor, Selmer Horn - broke tenor player, Seymour Butts - baritone, Rusty Keys - baritone, Arthur Chorus - baritone, Ima Growler - baritone\n\nFLUTE\n\nBret Support - Will Trill - Mosley Sharpe - Lotta Air - Vera Piercing (piccolo)\n\nRHYTHM SECTION\n\nPIANO\n\nR.
