        "text": "St. Ivo compared the Kingâs adultery to that of\n\nHerod & Herodias, above\n\nâOne who is in good health does not need physicians; they are needed by those who are ill. â¦ Even though Herodias married Herod and asked for the head of St. John Baptist, it was necessary for John to say: âIt is not licit for you to repudiate your wife and take a wife of another.â â¦ The more evil men struggle against the Church, the more necessary it is to have the courage to defend her and raise her from the ruins. I do not speak in this way to teach you, but to persuade you to take hold the plow to rip out the thorns from the field of the Lord.â\n\nKing Philip I of France with his lover\n\nBertrade of Anjou\n\nHe writes with diplomacy that, out of respect for the King, he does not wish to attend that meeting in order not to not take a public position against the King that his conscience would oblige him to take. He prefers to write rather than say it publicly. If the King forces him to attend, he will have to announce before everyone the moral situation of the King. The position of the Saint is so logical that it dispenses with the need for commentary. He did what he should do."
