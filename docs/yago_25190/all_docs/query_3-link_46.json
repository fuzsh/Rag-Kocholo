        "text": "Louis VI was born in around 1081 to Philippe I, king of France and Bertha of Holland. He was brought up on physical exercise and was a great eater and drinker hence his nickname. His youth was spent fighting, firstly the Normans in Vexin and then resolving disputes in Chartres and Agincourt. When he became king in 1108 he was mature and ready to rule. The monk Suger, who designed the basilica of St. Denis, was a great supporter of Louis and documented his life in great detail.\n\nLouis' most important act was the defeat of the joint attack from England and Emperor Henry V in 1124. Louis was saved by the fast action of the vassals who organised huge numbers of men to move against the threat. Emperor Henry V actually turned back before engaging the French."
