        "text": "I will start a new thread for this reply Phillip\n\nI have a branch of Glucksteins (all living from The Lyons Tea House). I have many many Harts on my tree, including the descendants of Hyam and Brendel (nee Hart), also Josephs descended from Joseph Joseph and my great...aunt Amelia Nathan. All of these famiilies married into each other or share the same ancestry.\n\nThere are several Moses families on my tree, one of whom I descend from: Rebecca my grtx3 grandmother married Samuel Solomon - ended up in Australia. Daughter Julia married LW Levy (my grtx2 grandparents)\n\nThe family of Abraham Moses and Leah (nee Shannon), several of their children / descendants married cousins. Family in Australia. I now discover the Elias Moses I referred to did not have a sibling called Henry, his wife Julia was daughter of Abraham & Leah.\n\n- there is another Elias Moses on my tree (not related, son of Isaac - family changed name to Marsden) who married Judith Jacobs (father Meir, one of yours?) - family originated in Alsace (might be related to Eliezer Wantsmoney) grand-daughter Julia married a Beddington. Isaac's family was connected to Hyam family of Hyam Hyam (Clothing manufacturer ) who my grt...Uncle David Levy was apprenticed to prior to opening Lewis's of Liverpool - as previously mentioned in Levy Turnpike thread, these Hyams via marriage might be related to my Levys.\n\nthe other Moses family are the descendants of Eliezer Wantsmoney - families sirnames include Beddington / Moss / Montagu - in another thread I think thee was mention of Moss families from Canada - these belong to same family as does Moss family in NSW (branches include Gotthelfs, Hallensteins etc) - the majority of Eliezer's descendants can trace their ancestry back to The Nathan family of Chaim Footman Nathan (of Holland) and Fanny (nee Jacobs) (my grt x4 grandparents).\n\nDominic\n\nI will start to fill in, where relevant, my Hart/Moses link through marriage to the Gluckstein/Joseph ( the famous Lyon's House families) and to Nigella Lawson and her Saames orgins from Amsterdam.\n\nThis is a very brief summary- Henry Moses m Rosa Hart- their daughter Hannah Rachel Moses 1866-1942 m Philip Alexander Solomon Phillips ( I think he swopped his surname around) in 1892. Their daughter Edna Ceciliy Phillips m Samuel Gluckstein Joseph- he was the father of Keith Sinjohn John- deata on Samuel Joseph Gluckstein and the Lyon's House relationship is well described in a range of sources. The parents of Samuel Joseph Gluckstein were Abraham Joseph and Sarah Gluckstein- her parents were Samuel Henry Gluckstein and Hannah Coenraad Sammes- this is the maternal line Nigella Lawson descends from.\n\nI will fill in further data on relationships in the future.\n\nPhillip\n\nI will post some data on the Nigella Lawson Dutch Ashkenazi lines in so far as they relate to my Hart/Moses line via marriage. The excellent Akevoth website which has significant data on Dutch Jewish Ashkenazi families contains records on the Saames and Joseph families from whom Nigella Lawson descends. Importantly, these records contain details of original family names including surname adoption.\n\nThere is also the family history programme \"Who do you think you are\" BBC which presented a brief overview of the Nigella Lawson Dutch Jewish lines but this is not in any way as detailed as the Avekoth records which also identify further family relationships.\n\nIn summary, the Dutch line descends from Joseph Juzpa Coenradd Saames Cohen Kats-Shamash 1750 ( Amsterdam) died 21 April 1821 Amsterdam - Juzpe ben Yekuthiel Cohen who married Klaartje Joseph. The surname Saames used May 1821. Their son Coenraad Saames ( Sammes0 was married to Judic Marcus Neter- her partents Marcus Levie and Rebecca Hijman.\n\nThe reasons for Coenraad changing his name to Coleman Joseph and fleeing to England arriving circa 1830 are documented in the BBC programme.\n\ni will supply census data to identify the Coleman Joseph family in England.\n\nPhillip\n\nThe following data taken from the 1841 Census shows Coenraad Saames using the alias of Coleman Joseph- HO107 710 12 ( Crown Copyright,TNA) living at Freeman St Christchurch Spitalfields:\n\nColeman Joseph 60 Shoe Maker Foreign birth;Simon Joseph 20 traveller Foreign birth;Josiah Soloman 17 traveller Foreign birth;Ann Joseph 21 Ind Foreign birth;Jane Joseph 57 Ind Foreign birth; Kitty Joseph 13 Dress maker Foreign birth- there were other individuals living at the same house.\n\nThe Death Records show Dec qtr 1846 Coleman Joseph Whitechapel 2 464\n\nSynagogue Scribes has the Marriage Record GSMa 041/37 23 May 1845 -Samuel Gluckstein -father's Hebrew name Yekutiel HaCohen to Ann Josephs -father's Hebrew name Asher.\n\nThe 1851 Census HO107 1543 692 24 ( Crown Copyright,TNA) -9 Freeman St Christchurch Spitalfields has the Glucksten/Joseph family:\n\nSamuel Gluckstein HM 30 Cigar dealer b Germany; Hannah wife 30 b Holland;Lena dau 5 b Spitalfields;Julia dau 3 b Spitalfields;Bertha dau 2 b Spitalfields; Catherine dau 1 b Spitalfields\n\nThe children of Coenraad Sammes/Coleman Joseph ( the Dutch records show further births and burials of children in Amsterdam) included:\n\nRebecca 1814;Hannah 1819 ( she is Anna who married Samuel Gluckstein);\n\n?Sammes 1820;Jesaias 1821;Simon 1823;Josiah 1824;Fytje 1825;Claartje 1828\n\nPhillip\n\nVery interesting\n\nMy Glucksteins are 3rd cousins and relate to the TV cook / writer. I know only their Cohen / Levy / Solomon / Nathan ancestry - their Gluckstein ancestry is not relevant to my tree as I don't list in-law cousins. All I know is that the grand-mother of my Glucksten's was a Klean.\n\nAgain I know very little of The Moses / Shannon - they are only on my tree because several of their descendants married cousins, info from another tree tells me Leah's father was Jacob Lawrence Shannon - this tree contains only 2 Levys. They are nothing to do with my grt...uncle David Lewis (Levy).\n\nUnfortunately, Akevoth contains no information on any of my Dutch ancesty\n\nDominic and others- here is data specifically relating to Henry Moses and Esther Nathan. As a recap Synagogue and Cemetery Scribes has data on the lines including the marriage SM147/17 1813 of Henry Moses -father's Hebrew name Eliezer Wantsmoney to Esther Nathan.\n\nEliezer Wantmoney maybe Samuel Eliezer Moses who married a Rachel Abrahams but confirmation is required. Family trees ( unverified) have the children of Samuel and Rachel as-Charlotte;David;Isaac;Jacob (John); Moses. Charlotte m Jacob Hyam Nathan and Jacob (John) m Clara Jonas.\n\nThe 1841 Census HO 107 725 6 ( Crown Copyright,TNA) Tower Hill St Botolph Aldersgate has- Henry Moses 49 General Merchant b in county;Esther Cohen 39 b in county;Edward Cohen 21 b in county;Maurice Cohen 19 b in county;Alice Cohen 8 b in county;Alfred Cohen 6 b in county;Jacob Cohen3 b in county Esther Cohen 24 FS b in county;Jacob Joseph 21 Indep b in county\n\n1851 Census ( Crown Copyright,TNA)HO107 1532 175 29 8 Finsbury Circus St Stephens-Henry Moses HM58 Merchant Clothier b City of London; Esther wife 52 b City of London;Samuel son U 22 Merchant clothier b City of London;Rachel dau U 19 b City of London;Alice dau U 17 b City of London\n\n1871 Census ( Crown Copyright,TNA) RG10 178 26 5-25 Park Square West Marylebone-Henry Cohen H M 76 Retired Merchant b City of London;Esther Cohen wife 71 b City of London +4 servants\n\nPhillip"
