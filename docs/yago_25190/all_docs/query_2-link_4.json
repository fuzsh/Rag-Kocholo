        "text": "IN the earliest times of the history of the country then called Gaul, the inhabitants were Kelts. The Gael evidently were there first, and left their name to the country, but the Cymry were the staple of the inhabitants when they became known to civilized nations. Their religion was druidical, their government merely the clan system, but they were more civilized than the insular Cymry from contact with the Greek colonies of Massilia and its dependencies on the Mediterranean coast.\n\nThe Belgæ had effected a settlement in the marshy lands about the mouths of the Rhine and Scheldt.\n\nB.C. 154.–The Greek colonies of Massilia called on Rome for assistance against the Gauls. The Romans, responding to the call, founded the colonies now called Aix and Narbonne, and gradually extended their territory so far as to own a region there called Provincia, now Provence.\n\nB.C. 113.–The Cimbri and Teutones, a mixed mass of Kelts and Teutons, poured into Gaul from the west, and were eagerly welcomed by all the Gauls, who dreaded the advance of Roman aggression. They routed two consuls and overspread Provincia.\n\nB.C. 103.–They were defeated at Aqua Sextiæ (Aix) by Caius Marius, pursued into Italy, and annihilated at Vercelli.\n\nProvincia became thoroughly Romanized.\n\nB.C. 61.–The Teuton tribe of Schwaben (Suevi, Swabians), under a prince or Heerfürst (Ariovistus), made their way across the Rhine. The Æduan chief Divitiacus came to implore the aid of Rome.\n\nWHEN the history of Britain begins to become known, the island was occupied by Kelts. These seem to have consisted of two principal nations–the Gael, taller, ruder, wilder, inhabiting the north and far west; the Cymry, more cultivated, living under the Druid system of religion, and apparently trading for tin with the Phoenicians.\n\nThe Belgæ, probably a mixed race of Kelts and Teutons, were beginning to make settlements on the eastern coast. In all these the nation was divided into clans, with the chieftainship of each inherent in one family. They sometimes coalesced under some chief of superior influence or talant.\n\nGaul and Britain were formed into a single Roman province, which was placed under a governor, known as the Præfect of Gaul, and possessed of immense power. All the chief cities had the privileges of Roman colonies, and a municipal government; and all the inhabitants of any distinction were Roman citizens, and assimilated themselves to Roman customs. Latin was the prevailing tongue, though Greek was studied as an accomplishment. The old Keltic religion was proscribed, the Roman deities were adored as belonging to the State religion, but Christianity was making progress. The great host of Teutonic tribes in Germany were becoming more restless, and continually threatening the eastern border of the Kelto-Roman province of Gaul, both by land and sea.\n\nused the Franks to fight the battles of the Roman Empire with the still ruder barbarians.\n\nIt is scarcely worth while to trace the various inroads of tribe after tribe who ravaged Gaul, and chased one another out again, without effecting a permanent settlement. The chief of these were the Burgundians, who were the first to establish themselves in burgs, in the country between the Alps and the Rhone, and were already Christians; and the Franks, who came over the Rhine, and whose royal line was properly called the Salic (from the river Yssel), but is also known as the Meerwings (sons of Meerwig), and as the Long-haired, because unshorn locks were a token of royal descent. Provence and the greater part of the south, being full of strong cities, served as a plundering ground for forays, and was never regularly conquered, and the old Cymric province of Armorica, or Brittany, which had scarcely been Romanized, remained free and Keltic.\n\nIn 458, HILPERIK I. was king of the Salian Franks. Syagrius was owned at Paris as king of the Romans, by the remnant of Latinized Gauls.\n\nThe Teutonic nations poured into the Empire in every direction, and gradually changed the whole face of it. They were, like the Kelts, in tribes, but each tribe had a royal family from which the king was always chosen. He decided only by the consent of his freemen, who had great power. The home possessions of each tribe were held in common, but the spoil of war (veh, fee, originally cattle), whether in gold or lands, was apportioned on condition of service to the king. Their language was Teuton, divided into the high and low German dialects; their character less fiery and more capable of steadiness and perseverance than the Keltic. Their religion owned Odin, Frey, and Thor as the chief deities, and was a good deal confused between the worship of nature and of ancestry, since Odin was the head of the \"Asagods,\" or summer gods, and all the royal lines were traced to him. A state of retribution after death was acknowledged, in which courage had the highest reward and cowardice the worst doom.\n\nIn 476, Aurelius Ambrosius seems to have made a brave resistance to the continual advance of the Saxons, but to have been gradually overpowered and forced to give way before them, and the kingdom of Kent was established.\n\nIn 490 CERDIC brought a colony of Saxons, who formed the kingdom of Wessex, or of the West Saxons. Tradition and uncertain history declare him to have been opposed for many years by Arthur who fought for every foot of land, but was killed by his own revolted nephew, in 542.\n\nWithin this period the kingdoms of Essex (East Saxons), Sussex (South Saxons), Deerland (Deira), Bearland (Beornia), and Marchland (Mercia), were established by the Saxons, also called Angles; the Kelts were almost obliterated, except in Wales, Cornwall, and Strathclyde, where they continued independent. The Saxon population almost entirely displaced the Keltic.\n\nPERIK. There were furious wars between the two brothers til 575, when Sigebert was murdered by emissaries of FREDEGUND, who also killed all her husband's sons by other wives, and filled her kingdom with violence and murder. Her son, HLOTER II., was four months old when his father was stabbed, in 585.\n\nBRYNHILD governed in Austrasia for her son HILDEBERT, and on his death, in 595, for her grandsons, THEUDEBERT and THEUDERIK. She was a high-spirited though fierce woman, and did all in her power to improve her people, and promote Christian learning and civilization. Her grandsons quarrelled, in 612. THEUDERIK was killed, in 617, by his brother, who died the same year, when about to make war on HLOTER, who fell on Austrasia, murdered THEUDEBERT's children, and caused the aged Brynhild to be dragged to death by a wild horse, in 621. DAGOBERT I. came to the throne in 628, and was the best of the Meerwings, merciful to his brother, a protector of the church, especially of SS. Eloi and Ouen, and a brave defender of his kingdom against the Slavonians. He was king of Neustria, Austrasia, and Burgundy, and was called King of the Franks and Prince of the Romans; but the Romans of Aquitaine were really independent. His sons, HLODWEH II. in Neustria and Sigebert in Austrasia, were feeble and helpless, and like all the rest of the dynasty are called Rois Fainéants (Do-nothings). The Maire du Palais ruled entirely, in 655. HLOTER III. reigned in name, in 656, under Ebroin, the maire, who on the king's death, in 670, raised another brother, THEUDERIK I., to the throne. The Austrasian kings had been set aside by their Maire du Palais, PEPPIN l'Héristal, a strong, able man, who went to war with Neustria, and taking Theuderik prisoner, united the kingdoms, and ruled both as maire, though there reigned in name Hlodweh II. (691), then his brother HILDEBERT II. (695), who left a son, DAGOBERT II. (711). He died in 714, in the same year as Peppin, whose authority was so established that he left as maitres to HLOTER III. his widow Plectrude and his grandson. The grandson died in 715. Karl, a son of Peppin, usually called Charles Martel, became maitre. The Neustrians set up another king, and during the war\n\nBretwalda in 568. He married Bertha, the daughter of Haribert of Paris, in 575, who brought her own clergy with her, but they made no attempt at the conversion of the English, and the British Church hated the enemy too much to preach to them, until at length Gregory the Great prepared a mission for England, in 595. St. Augustine landed in Kent in 597, and converting the king (in 598), became first Archbishop of Canterbury; but the other kingdoms remained in heathenism, and the Welsh clergy disputed with Augustine, in 612.\n\nRÆWALD, king of East Anglia, a lukewarm Christian, was Bretwalda in 617; but at his court, EADWINE, of Northumbria, met Paulinus, a disciple of Augustine. EADWINE became Bretwalda in 621. He was a zealous Christian and admirable king, but Cadwallader of Wales, and Penda, the heathen king of Mercia, combined, and at Heathfield, on the Trent, Eadwine was defeated and slain, in 634.\n\nOSWALD, his nephew, was a brave Bretwalda; he defeated and slew Cadwallader at Hexham; and brought Aidan, an excellent Keltic bishop, from Scotland, in 638, to instruct his subjects; but he was slain, in 642, in battle with Penda, and only when that Mercian king died (in 655) in battle near York, was he Bretwalda. He was the last to bear that rank, and Northumberland fell in power, while Mercia increased. There was, in the meantime, an entire conversion of the country. Theodore, archbishop of Canterbury, established dioceses and parishes, in 691, and many monasteries arose. Venerable Bæda wrote his history, in 711; St. Hilda ruled the Abbey of Holy Isle, in 714; and there was much culture and softening under the early monastic influence.\n\nIn 742, HILPERIK III. reigned, under Peppin (son of Charles.) In the desire of obtaining Peppin's support against the Lombards, Pope Zacharias granted PEPPIN leave to assume the crown in 752, and place Hilperik in a convent. So ended the Meerwing or Salic dynasty, and the Karling began. Peppin saved Rome from the Lombards, in 756; and conquered Aquitaine, in 760. He died in 768, and was succeeded by his sons KARL and Karloman. The latter died in 771, and KARL, or Charles the Great, became one of the greatest of sovereigns. He subdued the Lombards in 774, and conquered the Spanish Moors as far south as the Ebro, in 778. After several years' war, he reduced the Saxons on the Elbe, in 784, and forced them into Christianity, established great prince-bishoprics on the Rhine, to tame the wild people, encouraged learning, befriended the Church, and was the great benefactor of the Franks. By choice of the Roman people, he was made Emperor of the West in 800, and was crowned by Pope Leo III., thus founding the German Empire. His favourite palace was at Aix-la-Chapelle, where he died in 814, and was succeeded by his son LODWIG I. (the Pious).\n\nkingdom. Upon the death of the gentle, weak, and pious LODWIG, in 840, the brothers fought for the supremacy, and the coasts were left undefended against the Northmen, in 843. KARL, or Charles II., called the Bald, by the Treaty of Verdun became king of France in 857. He could not save it from the Northmen, who ravaged it from end to end, and besieged Paris in 860, which had to be bought off from being plundered by them. He had a troublous reign, and was weak and incompetent, but, surviving his brothers, he became Emperor in 875, and died two years later. His son, LODWIG (or Louis) II., the Stammerer, reigned in France alone.\n\nHis sons, LOUIS III. and KARLOMAN, reigned together in 879. The one died in 882; the other, KARL (or Charles III., called the Fat), son to Lodwig of Bavaria, and Emperor, reigned over all the Franks, miserably and weakly, in 884. Paris was again beseiged by the Northmen and succoured by Eudes, count of Paris, in 885.\n\nFull revenge for Ragnar's death was preparing in Denmark, but did not descend on England till ÆTHELBALD (857), son to Æthelwulf, and his brother, ÆTHELBERHT (860), had both reigned, and ÆTHELRED was on the throne (866). He fought gallantly against the savage Northmen, but was mortally wounded in battle, and ALFRED the Great, the youngest brother, succeeded in 872. His first seven years were all defeat and reverse, but, gathering strength, he became victorious, and forced the Northmen to occupy the wasted counties as Christians; then regulated, tamed, and civilized the kingdom. He raised a fleet to defend the coasts, made himself loved and honoured everywhere, and from his time England had an honourable name. ALFRED and KARL the Great are the two greatest men of England and France.\n\nEUDES was elected king of France in 888, when Charles had died of grief; but at his death, in 903, CHARLES IV. (the Simple), a posthumous son of LOUIS the Stammerer, was chosen king. He sunk into contempt, and was much inferior in power to ROBERT, son of Eudes, and HUGUES the Great, his son, who were more allied to the old Gallic race.\n\nCharles was deposed in 929, and died in prison. RODOLF, count of Burgundy, was chosen king. On his death, in 936, HUGUES and William of Normandy restored LOUIS IV., son of Charles, who was a man of more ability and energy, but unscrupulous and violent, and spent a life of vain struggles against the advancing power of the Counts of Paris. His death, in 954, left his kingdom to his son LOTHAR, and two years later HUGUES Capet succeeded his father, while Lothar continued the struggle, which was not so much of men, as whether the old Frank blood, now separated from the Franks in Germany, could stand against the revival of the Gallo-Romans or true French backed by the Normans.\n\nEADWARD the Elder (901), his son, carried out his grand policy, defeating the Danes and ruling the whole island until his untimely death.\n\nÆTHELSTAN (924), his son, was brave, wise, and successful, kept England clear of Danes, and raised her power and intelligence, so that no European prince was so highly esteemed. He sheltered Louis, son of Charles the Simple, in his exile; and his sisters were married to all the chief princes of Europe.\n\nEADMUND the Elder, the next brother, succeeded in 940, but was killed by a robber, in 947. ELDRED, the last brother, lame and weakly, left the government to Dunstan, abbot of Glastonbury. On his death, in 955, Eadmund's son, EADWINE, opposed Dunstan and quarrelled with the clergy. EADGAR, his brother, was set up (in 957) against him, and prevailed. He made Dunstan archbishop, and, ruling by his advice, was famed for peace and prosperity. He was called Emperor of Britain, and received the submission of the whole island.\n\nEadgar the Peaceable died in 974, and his eldest son, EADWARD, called the Martyr, was murdered in 979 by his stepmother Ælfrida, to place on the throne her own son ÆTHELRED the Unready. When\n\nLOTHAR was killed by a fall from his horse in 986, and LODWIG V. succeeded him, but died in 987; and the nobles and clergy of Northern France elected HUGUES Capet, to the exclusion of CHARLES, brother to LOTHAR, who merely obtained the dukedom of Lorraine. Henceforth the kingdom became truly French.\n\nIn 996, ROBERT succeeded his father. He was exceedingly devout, but weak, and the great feudal vassals were enormously powerful, absolute princes in their fiefs, only following the king's banner in a general war, and having wars among themselves. Other vassals held under them; and were bound to follow them in war: the peasants were serfs. Nobles were trained to fight in their heavy armour, and bound over by oaths of piety, truth, honour, and forbearance, before they received knighthood.\n\nHENRI I. came to the throne in 1030, a dull and feeble king; in fact the Counts of Paris were at first far less powerful as sovereigns than as vassals. The Abbey of Bec was founded in 1031, and became a great centre of spiritual life, leading to a great increase of vigour and holiness in monasticism.\n\nIn 1060, PHILIPPE I., a mere child, succeeded. His minority was of less consequence because his power was almost null. The castles which rose on every hill were almost impregnable, and each baron was a little lawless prince. The only check on their violence was in the strong force of their faith. They were often not withheld from great barbarity, but they usually owned their guilt, and tried to expiate it by penances, pilgrimages, and gifts to the Church.\n\nAfter a long and honourable reign, Richard I. of Normandy died at Rouen, and was succeeded in 996 by his son RICHARD II.\n\nA panic prevailed that the Judgment was to come in 1000. Lands were not sown, and a horrible famine ensued. The Church established that on the three sacred days of the week, and at holy seasons, fighting in private brawls was sacrilegious. This was called the Truce of God, and somewhat mitigated the savagery of war. The Normans became the most ardent of knights. Adventurers from Normandy conquered Sicily and Apulia in 1027. RICHARD II. of Normandy died in 1028, his son RICHARD III. in 1035. ROBERT, the next brother, died on pilgrimage, leaving the duchy to his young child WILLIAM, who had a most perilous minority, but by wonderful vigour and sagacity put down all his enemies, and became the greatest man in France.\n\nThe Papacy began to be renovated by the great monk Hildebrand, who took the election of the Pope from the Emperors and restored it to the clergy of Rome, represented by the Cardinals. He perceived how to make the Pope the final appeal for Church matters, and judge of sovereigns, and through the ecclesiastics whom he successively raised to the Papacy did much to establish the principle.\n\nafter Dunstan's death, in 986, the defences were neglected, the Danes returned in 987, and were subsidized by the king. Resistance was only partial, and inroads were made everywhere. Brithnot, earl of Essex, was killed fighting bravely at Malden, in 998. But the Danegelt was usually paid to the Danes instead of being used to raise armies against them. In 1002 Æthelred married Emma, daughter of Richard I. of Normandy. A great massacre of the Danes in Wessex provoked vengeance. SWEND, king of Denmark, invaded in 1003, with a view to conquest, not only to plunder.\n\nArchbishop Ælfhæg was slaughtered in 1008. Æthelred fled to Normandy, in 1012. SWEND was owned king of England, in 1013, but died the same year. His son KNUD and EADMUND Ironside, son to Æthelred, fought until a treaty was made, and was followed by EADMUND's murder, in 1017. KNUD married Emma, ruled well and beneficently, became a Christian and went on pilgrimage to Rome. He died in 1036, and HARALD Harefoot reigned like a savage Dane till his death, in 1039, when his half-brother HARTHAKNUD succeeded, but on his death, in 1041, EADWARD, son of Æthelred, was restored by the great Earl Godwine. Having been bred in a Norman convent, he was very pious, and devoted to the Normans. He brought many to England, and hence arose fierce quarrels with Godwine and the English party. Nor near kinsman remained to Eadward, and he longed to make William of Normandy his successor, but died, in 1065, undecided between him and Harald Godwineson. HARALD was elected in 1066 by the nation, but William of Normandy, invading England, defeated and killed him at Hastings, and was crowned WILLIAM I.\n\nIn 1070, Lanfranc, abbot of Bec, was made Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nIn 1073, Robert, William's eldest son, demanded the dukedom of Normandy, and being refused, rebelled, was defeated, and went into exile. Domesday-book, a census of the kingdom, was drawn up by the king's orders, and he did all in his power to promote order and justice. The Church, hitherto slack and ill-disciplined, was brought into closer connection with Rome, and reformed by Lanfranc, the king assisting with real faith, devotion, and conscientiousness.\n\nWilliam I. died in 1087, leaving the crown of England to his second son, WILLIAM II. (Rufus), an able man, but impious, violent, savage, and tyrannical, and much hated both by Normans and English. After Lanfranc's death, in 1089, he kept the see of Canterbury four years vacant. At length, under terror of death from severe sickness, he appointed Anselm, abbot of Bec. MALCOLM CEAN MOHR invaded England, but was killed at Alnwick, and his kingdom fell back into its savage Keltic state.\n\nIn 1135, Henry I. died in Normandy, and his sister's son, STEPHEN de Blois, obtained the crown of England from the nobles, who hoped to exercise under him the feudal licence that the previous kings had repressed. On his endeavour to restrain their violence they invited Maude to assert her claim. Her uncle David, king of Scotland, invaded England in her cause, but was defeated at Northallerton in 1138; but Maude landed in England the following year, and made Stephen prisoner at Lincoln in 1141. Her haughtiness alienated her supporters, and she was besieged at Oxford in 1142, whence she escaped by night; but her chief champion, Robert, Earl of Gloucester, was captured and exchanged for Stephen. She retained the western counties and Stephen the eastern. Her son Henry came to England in 1148,\n\nand made a treaty with the king, by which he was to obtain the crown at Stephen's death, to the exclusion of that prince's children. England was in a horrible state of private warfare throughout the reign.\n\nIn 1154, Stephen died, and HENRY II. continued the Norman policy of repression of the barons, and strict observance of law, showing great vigour, resolution, and astuteness.\n\nIn 1161, Thomas à Becket was made primate, and resisted the demand of the king at the Council of Clarendon (in 1164), that the clergy should be subjected to secular law. Being driven into exile, he appealed to the Pope; and Henry, being in fear of excommunication, caused his eldest son, Henry, to be crowned in 1170, to reign jointly with himself. A partial reconciliation was effected, and Becket returned to England, but was immediately after murdered by four of Henry's knights.\n\nHenry's queen and her three elder sons all rebelled, and fled to France. They were reduced to submission, but Alienor was kept in confinement, and her Aquitanian subjects continually incited her sons to assert her cause against their father, and they were in a perpetual state of rebellion in 1180, which, however, was chiefly confined to the French fiefs. Near Limoges, Henry, the eldest son, died childless, in 1183, in the midst of a rebellion; and three years later (in 1186), Geoffrey, the third son, was killed in a tournament, leaving a posthumous son, Arthur, duke of Brittany. On the tidings (in 1188) that Jerusalem had been retaken by the Saracens, Philippe II., with Henry II. and his son Richard, took the cross; but during the preparations, Richard, supported by Philippe, made demands which Henry II. resisted, but on their taking up arms against him, he yielded, being worn out and broken down with toil and sorrow; and on finding that his youngest son, John, had joined the league against him, he died of grief, in 1189, at Chinon in Normandy.\n\nA treaty was made at Vezelay between Philippe and Richard.\n\nIn 1200, France was laid under an interdict to compel Philippe to take back his lawful wife.\n\nOn Agnes' death, in 1201, he took back Ingeborg, and the censure was removed. This anxiety ended, he again supported Arthur against John, giving him a small army, but Arthur, while attacking the castle of Mirabeau, in 1202, was surprised by John, made prisoner, and put to death secretly. Philippe summoned John, as his vassal, to answer for the murder, and on his non-appearance declared his fiefs forfeit to the crown, and seized Normandy, Anjou, and Poitou, in 1203, with little endeavour on John's part to defend them. Guienne and Brittany passed to Alix, a sister of Arthur, on the mother's side.\n\nagainst him, and forced him to sign Magna Charta, a charter binding him to rule by the old English laws. He swore to it, but immediately broke away in fury, and collected mercenaries to put down the barons in 1215.\n\nThe barons invited Louis the Lion to their aid and he obtained possession of London, and of all the south of England. John's treasure was lost in crossing the Wash, and he died soon after (in 1216) at Newark. His son, HENRY III., a child of nine, was crowned, and most of the barons returned to their allegiance.\n\nIn 1217, the troops of Louis were defeated at Lincoln, by the barons, and his fleet bringing reinforcements by Hubert de Burgh, off Dover; whereupon he resigned his pretensions and left England. Young Henry was protected by the Pope as a Church vassal, and was under the guardianship of Hubert de Burgh, who governed well; but the country suffered much from papal exactions, and the wastefulness of the king and his court.\n\nPHILIPPE IV. (le Bel) was a clever, wary, treacherous, and violent man.\n\nIn 1294, PHILIPPE IV. invaded the dominions of Guy Dampierre, count of Flanders, Edward's ally. Edward endeavoured to succour him, but his hands were tied by his Scottish war and by the refusal of his barons to serve beyond the sea or grant supplies. He gave up attention to the Continent to concentrate it on England, and after a voyage to Flanders, when want of means crippled him, he made a truce with Philippe.\n\nPope Boniface VIII. interfered on behalf of Guy of Flanders, but in vain. Philippe made peace with Edward, giving him his sister Margaret as a second wife, and betrothing his daughter Isabel to Edward of Caernarvon in 1303. The treaty of Monbreuil was signed, by which Edward left Philippe almost all he claimed in France.\n\nIn 1291, on the death of Alexander III. and the failure of the direct line of Scottish kings, Edward was called to decide the succession between the claimants. He chose John Balliol, but in 1294 assumed a power as suzerain that galled the Scots. They rebelled, and a fierce war broke out, in which Edward's passions were roused to fury. The needs of Edward led to the assembly of the first regular Parliament. He defeated the Scots under Wallace at Falkirk in 1298, deposed Balliol as rebellious, and seized the whole kingdom; but the violence of the governors he employed provoked an outlaw war in 1299. Edward was forced to give way to the Parliament, and sanction the law that supplies cannot be granted without consent from the nation.\n\nThe barons were more amenable to a warlike king, but the country was drained of money, and the king had often to entreat for subsidies.\n\nIn 1346, David II. invaded England, but was defeated and made prisoner at Nevil's Cross, in 1347.\n\nIn 1348, Edward tried to marry his daughter to the Count of Flanders, but he escaped, and threw himself into the arms of France. A truce was made, partly from the exhaustion of both countries, which were alike ravaged by the terrible pestilence, the Black Death.\n\nIn 1349, the Order of the Garter was instituted. William of Wykeham was chancellor.\n\nEngland was proud of the victories, though there was great want of money and scarcity of labour.\n\nCharles V., skilfully avoiding open war, used his power as suzerain to undermine that of the Black Prince at Bordeaux. A hearth-tax was imposed by the prince in 1370. It excited much discontent, and was appealed against. Charles summoned the prince to answer the appeal; he was enraged, and renewed the war. He was carried in a litter to the revolted town of Limoges, which he caused to be sacked and cruelly treated. The policy of Charles was to allow no pitched battles with the English, but to take castle after castle and harass them out.\n\nIn 1375, Lancaster marched from Brittany to Bordeaux without once meeting an enemy, but arrived exhausted in men and money.\n\nPope Gregory V. again removed to Rome; but on his death two parties arose. One elected a pope willing to remain at Rome, the other one desirous to remain at Avignon. Thus arose the Great Schism. The English held with the Roman pope, the French with the antipope at Avignon.\n\nIn 1397, Richard seized and imprisoned Gloucester, who died in his hands.\n\nIn 1398, Henry, son of the the Duke of Lancaster, accused Mowbray, duke of Norfolk, of treason, and offered to prove it by wager of battle; but Richard prevented the fight, and banished both.\n\nIn 1399, on his father's death, Henry returned, ostensibly to claim his inheritance; but, finding the great family of Percy and the people willing to join him, he obtained the crown, and deposed Richard, who perished in captivity, in 1400.\n\nIn 1402, the Scots were defeated at Homildon; but HENRY IV., demanding the custody of the prisoners, offended the Percys, who turned at once against him, taking up the cause of the direct heir, Edmund Mortimer, who had been set aside.\n\nIn 1422, the infant Henry was proclaimed at Paris king of France. The Duke of Bedford, brother to Henry V., was regent, continued the war with vigour, and obtained the great victories of Crevant in 1424, and of Verneuil in 1425.\n\nIn 1428, the English endeavoured to extend their conquests beyond the Loire, and besieged the city of Orleans, defeating the French, who tried to cut off their supplies, at the Battle of the Herrings, in 1429. The peril of the country roused high religious enthusiasm in a peasant girl named Jeanne d'Arc. She roused such spirit in the army that she saved Orleans, and conducted Charles VII. in triumph to be crowned at Rheims; but the French king and nobles never really appreciated her, she was ill-supported, was taken by the English and Burgundians, who put her to death at Rouen as a witch in 1431.\n\nIn 1433, the Duke of Lorraine died. The duchy was claimed by his sister, wife of Réné, but was seized by order of Philippe of Burgundy. The Duke of Burgundy was reconciled to Charles VII. and forsook the English. Réné was made prisoner while fighting for Lorraine.\n\nIn 1436, a brilliant chivalry began to grow up around Charles. The Count de Richemont was the ablest of his leaders, and many irregular enterprises were undertaken, usually to the profit of the French; but the lawlessness and insubordination were extreme, and the country was dreadfully pillaged and oppressed, until Charles, reviving from his sloth, modelled his army, brought the men under discipline, and put down the bands of marauders, in 1440.\n\nLouis the dauphin was continually quarrelling with his father, and lived in a state of constant enmity to Charles in his own county of Dauphiné, always carrying on intrigues.\n\nIn 1456, the jealousy and suspicion between Charles VII. and his son became so great that Louis withdrew to Burgundy, and lived there under the protection of Duke Philippe.\n\nCharles VII. was called le bien servi, and his nobles were certainly men of distinguished courage and patriotism. The discipline he had established in his army rendered his soldiers some of the best troops, and his guard of Scottish archers rendered him able to exert his authority. The kingdom began to recover prosperity, and was in a better state than since the English wars began; but the king lived in a state of miserable suspicion, and died at length in 1461 from fear of taking food lest he should be poisoned.\n\nLOUIS XI., cunning, hard-hearted, and grossly superstitious, but hypocritical, set himself to reduce the feudal privileges of the nobles, and to overthrow all whom he feared by his crafty but cruel policy.\n\nIn 1452, York claimed to be acknowledged as heir to the crown before the Beauforts. He raised an army but was made prisoner and forgiven. Henry fell into a state of imbecility, during which a son (Edward) was born to him in 1454. Meantime York acted as regent until Henry recovered in 1455, and recalled the Duke of Somerset, on which York took up arms, and fought at St. Alban's, where he obtained possession of the king's person, and held the government for a year; when Henry, recovering, tried in 1456 to bring about a reconciliation, and a festival called the Love-day was held, when York, Somerset, and all their partisans swore amity; but Nevil, earl of Warwick, brother-in-law to York, was the bitter enemy of the queen and Somerset, and the disputes broke out again. In 1459, at Blore Heath, a victory was gained by the Yorkists, and the next year at Northampton they made the king prisoner; and at a parliament held shortly after, it was determined that he should retain the crown for his life, but that York should succeed him. On this, Margaret, hotly indignant, raised an army in the north, and defeated and slew York upon Wakefield Bridge. But he was quickly revenged by his son Edward, who in 1461 defeated the Lancastrians at Mortimer's Cross, St. Alban's, and at Towton Moor, the bloodiest of English battles; threw the king into prison, and was crowned as EDWARD IV. He was a youth of great talents, but proud, licentious, and indolent. He married, secretly, Elizabeth Wydville, widow of Sir John Gray, a Lancastrian knight.\n\nIn 1470, Louis convoked the notables at Tours, and declared all the engagements he had taken to Burgundy at Péronne null and void. St. Quentin, the town of the Count de St. Pol, who had hesitated between the two princes, and been a traitor to both, was taken by the French. Charles advanced on Amiens, but was forced to demand a truce. Louis's was a reign of terror to the nobility, whom he crushed by the harshest tyranny, in order to put an end to the wild independence fostered by the English wars. The Duke de Nemours, head of the house of Armagnac, was put to death; others were shut up in iron cages at the castle of Loches. The king's confidence was given to lowborn men, such as Olivier le Daim, a barber, and Tristan l'Hermite, provost-marshal.\n\nThe Count de St. Pol was beheaded at Paris.\n\nLorraine, the inheritance of the wife, and through her of the grandson, of Réné of Anjou, had been seized by Charles of Burgundy, who offered to buy off his claim; but young Réné, the true heir, leagued with the Swiss, and Charles suffered at their hands a terrible defeat at Granson in 1476. All Lorraine revolted, and the gates of Nancy were shut against him. He laid siege to the place in 1477, but there were traitors in his camp, and he was surprised in a night attack, and found lying slain by many wounds among the fugitives.\n\nBurgundy, as a male fief, reverted to France, but Flanders and Holland remained with Charles's daughter, Mary, who married Maximilian, heir of Austria. In 1478, Louis marched an army against her, but it was defeated by Maximilian at Terouenne.\n\nIn 1480, old king Réné died, having given up his right to Provence and to the kingdom of Naples to the king. A truce was concluded between Louis and Mary of Burgundy, by which his young son, Charles, was to marry her daughter, Margaret of Austria.\n\nIn 1482 Mary of Burgundy died from a fall from her horse, leaving two children, Philippe and Margaret.\n\nEdward landed in Calais in 1475, but Charles joined him with exhausted forces; and Edward, displeased at his not fulfilling his engagements, consented to meet Louis at the bridge of Pecquigny, and there was bribed and cajoled by him into returning home, his courtiers receiving pensions as compensation for the plunder they missed.\n\nIn both countries this was a time of much corruption in religion. The long wars in each had demoralized the people, ruined the churches, and involved the abbeys deep in debt. There was much ignorance among the lower clergy, and the higher were generally statesmen. Though the Great Schism had long been ended, the mischief it had done was not repaired. Printing had been invented, and under the patronage of the Dowager Duchess of Burgundy many English works were printed by Caxton.\n\nIn 1483, Louis XI., after long ill-health, during which his suspicious cruelty increased, died. His son, CHARLES VIII., was only fourteen years of age, and affairs were arranged by Anne, his sister, the Dame de Beaujeu, a woman of great shrewdness and energy.\n\nIn 1484, the States-General were convoked, and relaxed the most oppressive ordinances of Louis, releasing his victims from captivity. There was a great conspiracy against the power of Anne of Beaujeu on the part of all the princes and nobility, but she repressed them with great ability, though they continued full of discontent, and continually forming plots against her. The Duke of Brittany and the Duke of Orleans (next heir to the throne) were jealous of her authority, and were resolved on striking a blow for the old influence of the great princes of France.\n\nIn 1483, Edward IV., having ruined his health by excesses, died early, leaving a son of thirteen, EDWARD V.; but Richard, duke of Gloucester, taking advantage of the national hatred of Elizabeth Wydville and her kinsmen, obtained a declaration that young Edward and his brother were illegitimate, and threw them into the Tower, where, while he was crowned RICHARD III., they are believed to have been murdered. Soon after the Duke of Buckingham, who had hitherto acted in concert with Richard, turned against him, and was put to death. The affections of the English turned to the last scion of the House of Lancaster, Henry Tudor, of Welsh extraction, but whose mother was a Beaufort, great-granddaughter to John of Gaunt. After securing the promises of numerous nobles, Henry landed in 1485, and at the battle of Bosworth Richard was killed. HENRY VII. was crowned, and strengthened his claim by marrying in 1486 Elizabeth of York, daughter to Edward IV. Clarence's son, the Earl of Warwick, was imbecile, but was personated by an imposter,\n\nIn 1488, the confederates were defeated at St. André de Cormier, and Orleans made prisoner. The Duke of Brittany died the same year, leaving only two daughters. The Dame de Beaujeu resolved to seize the duchy, either as a male fief, or by marrying her brother to Anne, the eldest daughter. She invited Maximilian of Austria to marry and defend her, and, in 1490, he espoused her by proxy, but he was detained for want of supplies. In 1491, Nantes was taken, and Anne of Brittany consented to marry the king, thus uniting her duchy with the crown; while her engagement with Maximilian was broken, as well as that of Charles to his daughter. But by this means all the great feudal principalities were absorbed by the Crown, and Charles VIII. was the first real king of all France.\n\ncalled Lambert Simnel, who in 1487 raised an insurrection, but was overthrown.\n\nThe resources of the Crown had been much diminished by the wars of York and Lancaster, and Henry was forced to be very parsimonious. He was also very grasping, and was always unpopular, though the country was too weary of civil war for a serious rebellion; and the great nobles, who ever since Magna Charta had domineered over the Crown, had been almost entirely broken in strength.\n\nIn 1491, Henry, on pretext of the French war, levied large contributions from his people by the name of benevolences.\n\nA Fleming, called Perkin Warbeck, patronized by Margaret of York, duchess of Burgundy, professed to be the young Duke of York killed in the Tower.\n\nIn 1498, Charles VIII. died from a blow on his head against a doorway. His successor was LOUIS XII., formerly Duke of Orleans, who married his widow, Anne of Brittany. He had claims through his grandmother to the Duchy of Milan, and renewed the Italian war. He entered Milan in person, and sent an army to recover Naples; but in the meantime the King of Sicily had resigned in favour of the Spanish royal family, and the French had to contend with Gonzalo de Cordova, the greatest captain then living. Louis d'Armagnac, duke de Nemours, was the French viceroy of Naples, and chivalrous combats occurred between his troops and those of Spain; but Cordova was the true general, and at Cerignola, in 1503, Nemours was slain, and the French totally defeated two years later at the Garigliano, so as to be forced to leave the kingdom of Naples, though they\n\nIn 1517, François resolved on pursuing the Italian war, and crossed the Alps. At Marignano his Swiss mercenaries mutinied, and he fought a desperate battle with them. After his victory he caused himself to be knighted by Chevalier Bayard. He soon regained all Milan, and after a conference with Leo X. returned home. The birth of the son of Claude of France united Brittany to the crown, like the other great principalities, such as Normandy, Burgundy, Provence, Gascony, &c.; but each of these provinces retained its own parliament. These parliaments differed from the English in being composed only of nobles and lawyers, and having no power to grant supplies, nor to originate measures. They could only register the decrees of their sovereign.\n\nIn 1552, Somerset and his brother were beheaded. The young king had fallen into a decline and was entirely managed by Dudley, who, working on his fears for the Reformation, induced him to nominate as his successors neither of his sisters, but Jane Grey, granddaughter of Mary Tudor, duchess of Suffolk, whom Dudley married to his son Guildford.\n\nIn 1553, Edward VI. died, and Jane was proclaimed in London; but the country would not accept her, and MARY obtained the crown. She at once restored the old Roman Catholic ritual, and Archbishop Cranmer was sent to the Tower, for having supported Jane. An insurrection on Jane's behalf by Sir Thomas Wyatt led to her being beheaded. Mary married Philip, son to Charles V., and Cardinal Pole reconciled England to Rome.\n\nIn 1559, Henry was forced to make peace, restore Savoy, and marry his sister to the duke. During the tournament at the feast Henry was pierced in the eye by a splinter of a lance, and died.\n\nFrançois II., a sickly lad of fifteen, married to Mary of Scotland, was left under the tutelage of his mother, Catherine de Medicis, a subtle, unprincipled, clever woman, always striving to play off one party against the other. The heads of the Catholic party were the House of Guise; of the Huguenot, the house of Bourbon, namely Antoine (titular King of Navarre in right of his wife), and Louis, prince of Condé. The king and queen were almost entirely under the dominion of the Guises, and in 1560, the conspiracy of Amboise was formed by Condé for taking them out of their hands. It was detected, and the Bourbon princes were imprisoned, and in danger of their lives, when FRANÇOIS II. died. CHARLES IX., his next brother, was only nine, and Catherine, becoming regent, released Condé, and in 1561 caused conferences to be held at Poissy to see whether the Church could be reformed enough to reclaim the Huguenots; but these were broken up by the Catholic party, and an attack made by the attendants of the Duke of Guise on a Huguenot congregation at Vassy began the civil war. Condé, his brother, and the Admiral de Coligny led the Huguenots, and raised Normandy and Provence in their favour, laying siege to Rouen, where King Antoine was killed. Rouen was taken and plundered, and Condé advanced on Paris, but was encountered at Dreux by Guise and made prisoner.\n\nIn 1559, Elizabeth made Lord Burleigh her Secretary of State. She was rapturously hailed by those inclined to Reform; but those who held the old form of faith regarded her as illegitimate, and Mary of Scotland as the rightful queen. Her position was very dangerous; but she weathered the storm by her courage and sagacity, though these were alloyed by much vanity and constant falsehood, which was regarded as a lawful engine of statecraft. The nation and she had a deep earnest love for each other, and her wisdom restored their prosperity; but she vacillated in her foreign policy, and her lack of means and unwillingness to impose taxes made her parsimonious, and she never properly supported her allies or her own subjects. Nevertheless, though neither Lutheran nor Calvinist, she was regarded as the great champion of all the bodies of Reformed Christians in Europe, as the King of Spain was of the Roman Catholics, and she held her position.\n\nShe was too much addicted to favouritism, and was much under the influence of Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, son to the Duke of Northumberland.\n\nIn 1573, Henri, duke of Anjou, was elected King of Poland.\n\nIn 1574, Charles IX., a miserable prey to remorse, died, and HENRI III. came to the crown, returning from Poland. He was a strange compound of courage and indolence, cruelty and effeminacy.\n\nIn 1575, his younger brother, the Duke d'Alençon, tired of the court, fled and put himself at the head of the Calvinists.\n\nIn 1576, Henry of Navarre, awakened from his long indolence, fled from court, returned to Calvinism, and took up arms. A peace was concluded, and Henri of Navarre returned to his hereditary states in Bearn. Alençon accepted an invitation from the insurgents in Flanders to place himself at their head. These Protestant alliances led the House of Guise and the more violent Catholics to form a league for the defence of the Church.\n\nIn 1584, the Duke d'Alençon died after a short illness, and Henri III. being childless, the next heir was the head of the House of Bourbon, Henri of Navarre, who as a Calvinist and relapsed, was regarded with horror by the League, who, with Guise at their head, tried to cause his uncle, Cardinal de Bourbon, to be declared heir. In 1585, the War of the Three Henrys (of France, Navarre, and Guise) began; but though the king was in the power of the Guises, he had a certain attachment to his cousin, and was unwilling to cut him off from the succession.\n\nIn 1586, a fresh conspiracy having taken place on the part of Babington to murder Elizabeth and crown Mary, at length, after nineteen years, led Elizabeth to cause her to be tried and executed at Fotheringay Castle, in 1587.\n\nIn 1588, Philip II., who had long been meditating a great attack on England, now mustered all his forces, and though delayed by the bold attacks of Drake on the ships in Cadiz and Lisbon bay, sent forth the huge armament called the Spanish Armada; but after being harassed by the English fleet the whole length of the Channel, it was destroyed by storms in the German Ocean, and all Spanish hopes of subduing England thus ended. The Earl of Leicester died the same year.\n\nIn 1599, Henry was divorced from his wife, Marguerite of France, and married Marie de Medicis. He and his great minister, the Duke de Sully, applied themselves to bring the long distracted kingdom into a state of prosperity and peace, and thus came into collision with the Duke de Bouillon, the last of the old independent feudal nobles, and the Duke de Biron, who had risen to great power and haughtiness in the civil wars. In 1602, Biron absolutely rebelled, and was tried, condemned, and executed.\n\nThe destruction of the religious wars had greatly weakened the nobility, and the crown was more powerful than before. Henri had many great qualities, and the wisdom of Sully assisted in doing much for the benefit of his people, by whom he was passionately beloved, from his frankness of manner and readiness of address. Unhappily he was licentious in the extreme, and set an example of corruption of manners, bearing with no rebukes from the strict old Huguenots who had brought him to the throne.\n\nIn 1599, Essex was sent to Ireland to repress Tyrone's insurrection; but, failing in so doing, he hurried home without leave to justify himself, and thus offended the queen. In 1600, he was impeached and brought to trial, but pardoned. Fancying he could coerce the queen into favouring him as of old, he in 1601 raised an insurrection, but was overcome, tried, and beheaded. Elizabeth never recovered her spirits, and died shortly after (in 1602). The crown passed to James Stewart, king of Scotland. He was a man of much learning and some ability, but of foolish demeanour, and great timidity and conceit, very easily led. A plot was formed for setting Arabella Stewart on the throne, in which Sir Walter Raleigh was implicated. It was overthrown, Raleigh was imprisoned, and Arabella watched. In 1603, James assumed the title of King of Great Britain. He held conferences with the clergy and the Puritans at Hampton Court, and gave all his support to the Church and Prayer-book, thus discontenting the Protestant party, who were further displeased that he made peace with Spain.\n\nIn 1616, the Abbé de Richelieu (soon Cardinal), the ablest man in France, began to gain influence. Albert de Luynes, a favourite companion of the king, engaged to free him from his thraldom. Concini was killed at the door of the Louvre, and his wife tried and put to death, while the queen-mother remained in a sort of captivity. The king was of a childish, weak nature, unable to exist without a favourite, and fell entirely under the dominion of De Luynes. The Government was showing a desire to elude the provisions of the Edict of Nantes; and the Huguenots, taking umbrage, in 1621 revolted, and garrisoned their towns. De Luynes was created Constable, and marched against them, taking the king with him. Montauban was taken and burnt; but on the march De Luynes was taken ill and died.\n\nIn 1642, Cinq Mars and his friend De Thou organized a plot, with the king's knowledge, for overthrowing Richelieu and bringing in Spanish aid to destroy him; but the conspiracy being detected, they were both put to death. The cardinal was even then very ill, and died before the end of the year.\n\nIn 1643, Mazarin, an Italian ecclesiastic trained under Richelieu, succeeded to his post, became a cardinal, and carried out his policy, with more suavity and less harshness, but quite as much determination. He placed Louis de Bourbon, duke d'Enghien, eldest son of the Prince of Condé, at the head of the army, where he soon showed himself, though still very young, one of the greatest of French generals. Louis XIII. died. His son, LOUIS IV., was only five years old, and the regency was given to his mother, Anne of Austria, who gave all her confidence to Mazarin. Enghien won the great battle of Rocroy, and destroyed the fine old Spanish infantry.\n\nIn 1644, Enghien and Turenne, his equal in ability, advanced into Germany, and fought a bloody but doubtful battle at Friburg.\n\nIn 1642, Charles went down to the House to arrest the five leaders of the Opposition; but the project becoming known through the queen's indiscretion, the members withdrew; and the Londoners, indignant, rose in tumult. The king left London and went northward. The gates of Hull were closed against him by Sir John Hotham.\n\nIn 1643, the king raised his standard at Nottingham, and the Civil War began. The party who esteemed the Church, and regarded strict loyalty to the king's person as their foremost duty, were of the Cavalier or Royalist party. Those who desired greater liberty in Church matters, and desired to bar the usurpations of the Crown upon the State, were on the Parliamentary or Roundhead side. In the battle of Edgehill, the king's best commander, Lord Lindsay, was slain, but the battle was indecisive.\n\nIn 1644, Charles, with his head-quarters at Oxford, met with varying success. Hampden was killed at Chalgrove Field. Oliver Cromwell rose into command in the Parliamentary army. The Royalists suffered a great defeat at Marston Moor.\n\nThus, both in France and England, the nobility having lost much of their power, the crown had come into collision with the middle classes. The great difference however was, that in England, there being only one Parliament, and that having the power of withholding supplies, it had much more vigour and substance than the French Parliament of Paris; and while in France the strife was for little more than an outward form, in England it was for the liberties of the nation. In France, the matter was complicated by the intrigues and jealousies of the Princes of the Blood. In England, a religious war was connected with the political one. The Parliament succumbed in France for want of genuine support from the aristocracy, whose dislike had only been to the minister, not to the power of the crown. In England, the Parliament had only been successful for a time through the abilities of a great soldier, who, having created a victorious army, forthwith overthrew all parliamentary power.\n\nIn 1649, she left Paris with the court, and caused Condé to besiege the city. Turenne took the part of the Fronde, and the two parties came to terms; Condé brought the king back to Paris in triumph, but this success rendered him arrogant and dictatorial, so that the queen and Mazarin in alarm caused him, his brother and brother-in-law, to be arrested and imprisoned at Vincennes. His wife raised the people of Bordeaux in his favour, and held out the city for four months. Turenne obtained aid from Spain, but though defeated at Rethel, his threatening attitude, and the general indignation at Condé's imprisonment and Mazarin's ascendency, were such that the queen was obliged to set the princes at liberty, while the cardinal fled in disguise. But his intrigues still kept the court in a state of dissension, and Condé, finding himself in danger there, fled to the south of France and placed himself at the head of an army, taking the part of the Parliament, not for the sake of guarding their privileges, but from hatred to Mazarin. The cardinal thereupon returned and reconciled himself to Turenne, who took the defence of the court party against the Fronde; Condé threw himself into Paris, and a terrible battle was fought at the Porte St. Antoine, where Condé was defeated, and the Parisians found themselves forced to submit. The Frondeurs resigned their projects, the Parliament became the mere mode of registering royal decrees, and Condé went into exile.\n\nIn 1649, Charles was arraigned before a commission appointed by Cromwell, and accused of treason to the nation. He refused to plead before an illegally constituted court, and was condemned and beheaded three days later. The office of King and the House of Lords were abolished by Parliament.\n\nIn 1650, Cromwell put down the rebellion in Ireland by measures of terrible severity. Charles II., then in Holland, was invited by the Scottish Covenanters to assume the crown. He came to Scotland, and took the covenant, but his party were defeated by Cromwell at Dunbar. Nevertheless, the indignation excited by his father's death made many regard him with favour, and in 1651 he entered England; but the Scots Covenanters and English Royalists did not easily coalesce, and Cromwell defeated them, first at Preston, and afterwards at Worcester, while Montrose, making a vain attempt in Scotland, was taken and hung. Charles, after wandering in diguise, reached France in safety, and Cromwell was all-powerful in England, nominally as the general appointed by Parliament, but really as entirely by the support of the army.\n\nIn 1652, the Navigation Act, restricting trade with the East and America to English ships, injured the commerce of Holland. Dutch ships had been searched to see whether munitions of war were being conveyed to the Royalists, and a war broke out between Holland and the Commonwealth.\n\nIn 1660, Louis XIV. married Marie Theresa, daughter of Philip IV. of Spain. His brother Philippe, duke of Orleans, married Henrietta, sister to Charles II. The French nobles had by this time lost all political or local power. All that remained to them was the privilege of waiting on the king at court, being exempt from taxation, and engrossing to themselves all the military commissions, so that no low-born soldier, however deserving, could ever hope to rise into command.\n\nIn 1661, Mazarin died, and Louis XIV. began to govern in person, and became the great centre of everything in France. He was a man of great ability and industry, and with a majesty of demeanour that rendered him one of the most personally revered sovereigns who ever lived. His courtesy was perfect, but his pride and ambition were as overweening as his selfishness. He had no feeling for any one but himself, and his people worshipped him contentedly.\n\nIn 1660, General Monk entering London, assembled the remains of the Long Parliament, which issued writs for a fresh election. The new Parliament resolved to restore royalty, and invited back CHARLES II., who returned amid great rejoicings, and took possession of the kingdom as if he had succeeded peaceably on his father's natural death. The Cavaliers returned to their estates, and the Church was restored.\n\nCHARLES II. had unusual abilities, but they were rendered useless by his indolence, laziness, and self-indulgence. He brought all the vices of the French court back with him; and, though full of grace, good-temper, and kindliness, was one of the most unprincipled of men–but his Church appointments were of good and pious men. He was inclined to the Roman Catholic Church at heart, and his brother and next heir, James, duke of York, professed himself one openly.\n\nespecially his palace at Versailles–were dazzling. It was a period of great talent; Bossuet and Fénélon were brilliant lights of the Church, Racine the great tragedian, Molière the comedian, Luxemburg and Villars as generals, and men who had attained excellence in every line; all adored the king, and laid their services at his feet. Louis had an almost unequalled power of making himself revered, and was treated like a sort of demigod, his very failings admired even by good men; and by the ascendency of his character he not only ruled over all hearts in France, but was regarded as the very type of a king by foreign princes. Yet his life was profligate, and his tyranny weighed heavily on nobles and poor, but Richelieu's policy had made the crown too supreme to be resisted.\n\nLouis's powerful character and example of easy despotism had a great effect on the two Stuart princes, whose residence in France had taught them to look on him as the head of royalty, and the pattern for imitation. His laxity of morals were viewed as an excuse for theirs, and his supreme contempt for all popular rights justified their want of political principle.\n\nCharles, however, by his nonchalance, ease, versatility, and want of earnestness, avoided ever coming to serious issue with his people, and preserved his personal popularity–never going further than they would bear; but he himself was under strong French influence, the people full of hatred and dread of it, and the ministry and influential statesmen, for the most part, truckling to it.\n\nIn 1685, Louis revoked Henri IV.'s Edict of Nantes, which had tolerated the Huguenots and allowed them to worship in safety. Horrible distress and cruel persecution followed; the Huguenots fled the country, where possible, and many of the most industrious of the silk-workers of the South of France had to choose between secret flight and apostasy. This proceeding was taken under the influence of Madame de Maintenon, a lady of great talent, whom the king had privately married, and who turned him in his old age to much more feeling for religion. He hoped to satisfy his conscience by following the dictates of the priests, who desired the extirpation of the Huguenots. The Elector Palatine died, and Louis claimed his personal property as that of his sister, the Duchess of Orleans.\n\nof libel. A son (James Francis) was born to James. In their vexation, the nation branded him as an imposter. At the same time the seven bishops were triumphantly acquitted, and the country, in despair at the Romanist succession they saw before them, invited the Prince of Orange to redress their grievances. He landed in Torbay; the army, under Lord Churchill, deserted to him, and James fled to France.\n\nJames II. having abdicated, the crown was offered by Parliament to his nephew, WILLIAM III., prince of Orange, and his daughter, MARY II., who accepted it, and consented to the Declaration of Rights, by which the power of the crown was curtailed, and the monarchy became subject to definite restrictions from Parliament.\n\nIn 1693, another great French victory took place at Neerwinden, but William, though always defeated in battle, kept up the constancy of the Dutch, and thus exhausted Louis.\n\nIn 1694, Luxemburg died, and with him much of the superior strategy of France, so that William began to regain ground.\n\nIn 1697, worn out with the war, a peace was concluded by both nations at Ryswick, by which Louis acknowledged William as King of England, restored the cities in the Netherlands, and gave up his pretensions to the Palatinate.\n\nIn 1700, Charles II. of Spain died childless. The direct heir was the Dauphin, but as, by the constitution of Spain, a foreign monarch was not eligible, he\n\nIn 1754, the French and English were continually disputing as to the boundaries of their territories in North America, also as to the alliances of their several trading companies in the East Indies. Dupleix, who had shown great talent, and laid the foundation of possible French empire in India, was recalled and ruined.\n\nHostilities began in America, on the Ohio and the Canadian borders. The Red Indian tribes were excited to take part in the struggle, and their savage attacks of scattered homesteads were horrible.\n\nIn 1755, Maria Theresa, in the desire to recover Silesia, allied herself with France and Russia, and commenced the Seven Years' War, in which England took part with Prussia.\n\nIn 1756, the French attacked and seized the Island of Minorca from the English. Admiral Sir George Byng was executed for not having exerted himself to relieve the garrison.\n\nIn 1789, Louis was driven into recalling Necker and convoking the States-General. All sat together in one chamber, and the deputies of the Tiers-état, or commonalty, had by far the majority. They changed the name to the National Assembly, and swore never to separate till they had given a constitution to France. The Duke of Orleans joined the party of Revolution; the Count de Mirabeau was the great leader of the Reformers; also La Fayette, who became the captain of the National Guard, an enrolled company of citizens who undertook the defence of the country. Excited and furious mobs paraded Paris, and when the king brought troops nearer for defence, it was supposed that he meant to crush the Revolution, and the fury of the people was uncontrollable; the nobles from this time began to take refuge in other countries, and the fugitives were termed emigrants. The Bastille was sacked and demolished. The National Assembly drew up a declaration of the Rights of Man, in imitation of that of the United States, and a Constitution was framed, in which the only power left to the king was that of veto, or of refusal of consent to a measure. This excited great wrath; and moreover, scarcity of provisions infuriated the people of Paris. The fear that Louis would call in the military added to their rage, and, on a report of an enthusiastic scene in the theatre at Versailles, the mob and National Guard hurried out to Versailles, insulted the king and queen, almost killing the latter, and dragged them back to Paris.\n\nIn 1792, the Legislative Assembly was elected from the Departments into which France had been divided, instead of the old Provinces. There were three parties: those who were willing to rest as they were; the Girondins, who wished to resemble the old Republic, but were virtuous, upright men; and the Jacobins, furious levellers, with Robespierre, Danton, and Marat for their leaders, and the mob for their instruments. Acts were drawn up depriving the emigrants of their property, and placing under surveillance the clergy who had refused the oaths. The king used his power of veto. The mob broke into the Tuileries, and threatened him and the queen. Meantime, the emigrant nobles and foreign powers were arming to rescue him, but this so enraged the Parisians that they invaded the palace, and massacred the faithful Swiss guards. The royal family took refuge in the Legislative Assembly, and were sent close captives to the Tower of the Temple. On the advance of the army from Germany, the Jacobins slaughtered 8,000 gentry and clergy in the prisons of Paris. Royalty was abolished by a decree. The emigrants and Germans were defeated at Valmy and Jemappes. The Legislative Assembly broke up, and the National Convention was elected, with a Committee of Public Safety, which summarily executed with the guillotine all who were accused of adhering to the old system. No sex or age was safe, it was a time of bloodshed throughout France.\n\nIn 1798, Bonaparte induced the French Directory to give him an army to make his way to India by way of Egypt and Cabul. On his way he took Malta from the Knights of St. John. He routed the Egyptian forces at the battle of the Pyramids, and took possession of Cairo. The Sultan Selim II. fitted out two armies against Bonaparte, who, in 1799, marched to meet the first in Syria, and there took Jaffa, where he made a terrible slaughter. Rome and Savoy were both mastered by the French, and the Pope was dragged into France, and there died. Naples was seized and overrun by the French.\n\nIn 1812, Napoleon collected his forces for a great invasion of Russia. Italians and Germans were forced into his service, and the Grand Army was the largest ever collected. A sharp but doubtful battle was fought at Borodino, on the Moskova, and the French advanced to Moscow. The city was deserted, and a fire breaking out so utterly destroyed it as to deprive the French of all winter quarters. They had to retreat in bitter weather, closely pursued, and suffering some of the greatest miseries ever known in the history of war ere they reached shelter on the Prussian frontier. However, Prussia, Austria, and Sweden all united with Russia against France, to avenge their long sufferings. Terrible, doubtful battles were fought at Lutzen and Bautzen, but at Leipsic Napoleon was entirely defeated.\n\nIn 1870, Napoleon III., feeling himself unpopular, tried calling in a liberal ministry, and then requested the nation to decide by plébiscite, or universal vote, on the continuance of the succession to his son. The majority was not as great as he expected, and there were signs of disaffection, desire of change, and longing for war. Negotiations were being made with Prussia, by which France hoped to absorb Belgium, allowing Prussia to obtain Luxemburg; but these failed. At the same time the Spaniards elected Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern-Siegmarigen, a relation of the King of Prussia, to their throne. Francis protested against it, and demanded a guarantee that he should never accept it. He had already declined it, but the guarantee was refused by Prussia, on which the French declared war, and the Emperor himself led an army across the frontier near Metz. The Prussians assembled their whole force, totally defeated the French at Weissemburg, Gravelottes, and Sedan, in the last place making the Emperor prisoner.\n\nParis proclaimed a Republic, and the Second Empire fell.\n\nCAMEOS FROM ENGLISH HISTORY. From Rollo to Edward II. By the Author of \"The Heir of Redclyffe.\" Extra fcap. 8vo. Second Edition, enlarged, 5 s.\n\nA SECOND SERIES, nearly ready.\n\nThe endeavour has not been to chronicle facts, but to put together a series of pictures of persons and events, so as to arrest the attention, and give some individuality and distinctness to the recollection, by gathering together details at the most memorable events. The \"Cameos\" are intended as a book for young people, just beyond the elementary histories of England, and able to enter in some degree into the real spirit of events, and to be struck with characters and scenes presented in some relief.\n\n\"Instead of dry details,\" says the Nonconformist, \"we have living pictures, faithful, vivid, and striking.\"\n\n\"They are a series of vivid pictures which will not easily fade from the memory of the young people for whom they are written.\"–Guardian.\n\nOLD ENGLISH HISTORY. By EDWARD A. FREEMAN, D.C.L. With Five Coloured Maps. Extra fcap. 8 vo. half-bound, 6 s.\n\n\"Its object is to show that clear, accurate, and scientific views of history, or indeed of any subject, may be easily given to children from the very first . . . . . I have, I hope, shown that it is perfectly easy to teach children, from the very first, to distinguish true history alike from legend and from wilful invention, and also to understand the nature of historical authorities and to weigh one statement against another. . . . I have throughout striven to connect the history of England with the general history of civilized Europe, and I have especially tried to make the book serve as an incentive to a more accurate study of historical geography.\"–PREFACE.\n\n\"His book has the special charm of being in its origin a real children's book. . . . There is nothing in it which a child cannot understand, and the harder narrative is constantly broken by the tales in which children delight.\"–Saturday Review.\n\nEUROPEAN HISTORY. Narrated in a series of Historical Selections from the Best Authorities. Edited and arranged by E. M. SEWELL and C. M. YONGE. Vol. I. Crown 8vo. 6s.\n\nSECOND SERIES. 1088-1228. Crown 8vo. 6 s.\n\nWhen young children have acquired the outlines of history from abridgements and catechisms, and it becomes desirable to give a more enlarged view of the subject, in order to render it really useful and interesting, a difficulty often arises as to the choice of books. Two courses are open, either to take a general and consequently dry history of facts, such as Russell's Modern Europe, or to choose some work treating of a particular period or subject, such as the works of Macaulay and Froude. The former course usually renders history uninteresting; the latter is unsatisfactory, because it is not sufficiently comprehensive. To remedy this difficulty, selections, continouous and chronological, have, in the present volume, been taken from the larger works of Freeman, Milman, Palgrave, and others, which may serve as distinct landmarks of historical reading.\n\n\"We know of scarcely anything,\" says the Guardian, of this volume, \"which is so likely to raise to a higher level the average standard of English education.\"\n\n\"It is a book that every school library ought to have, and which every household, where there are young people, ought to have too.\"–Literary Churchman."
