The drivers that came with the motherboard only supported stereo sound, as the rear jacks are only Speakers, Line-in and Mic. I somehow managed to download and install a different set of drivers from VIA audio.\n\nI could find a solution to this on Ubuntu however. I'm currently running a Daily Build of 13.04.\n\nIn the sound setting, selecting Analogue Surround 5.1 Output changes nothing as the 2 other jack are still recognised and rear mic and line-in in the input section."
