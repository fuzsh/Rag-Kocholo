        "text": "2019 is the year ‚Äì seemingly, when we finally get some more blu-ray remasters of classic Doctor Who adventures.\n\nNot since, 2013‚Äôs Spearhead From Space has any more classic episodes been remastered ‚Äì and put out on Blu-ray format.\n\nSpearhead From Space itself, was thought to be a bit of a fluke. Simply because, it was one of few Classic Who‚Äôs ‚Äì to be shot entirely on 16mm film; which enabled the footage ‚Äì to be remastered and upscaled to HD.\n\nMost Classic Doctor Who‚Äôs were shot in standard-definition, using electronic cameras. With 16mm film used, for the outdoor scenes; when on-location footage was recorded/used (which wasn‚Äôt in every episode!).\n\nTaking the best of those episodes ‚Äì from across the full classic era (where the 16mm still exists); the BBC have begun releasing limited edition Blu-ray boxsets. From each of the Doctor‚Äôs eras, with a limited number of the best remastered episodes ‚Äì available.\n\nIn most cases, this amounts to upscaling of standard footage; but ‚Äì is as close to an 1080p remaster ‚Äì as is currently possible to see.\n\nEven with the upscaling limitation, this is exciting news for Classic Who fans who never thought, that these episodes would get the HD treatment.\n\nThe Blu-ray also encompasses 5.1 surround-sound ‚Äì and tonnes of special features; some new and some previously released ‚Äì on the DVD versions.\n\nBoxsets already released, this year ‚Äì include:\n\nJon Pertwee ‚Äì Season 10 ‚Äì 1972-73\n\nAffiliate link to Amazon UK for potential buyers:\n\nSeason Ten ‚Äì Episodes included:\n\nThe Three Doctors‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\n\nCarnival of Monsters?????\n\nFrontier In Spaceüîµüîµüîµ‚ö™‚ö™\n\nPlanet of the Daleks‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\n\nThe Green Death‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\n\nFeatures\n\nA brand new feature-length documentary examining the Third Doctor‚Äôs Era, with archival contributions from Jon Pertwee, Barry Letts and Terrance Dicks plus all-new interviews with Katy Manning, Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss, presented by Matthew Sweet.\n\n‚Ä¢ Updated special effects and surround sound mix for Planet of the Daleks.\n\n‚Ä¢ Five new instalments of Behind the Sofa, featuring Katy Manning, Richard Franklin (Captain Yates) and John Levene (Sergeant Benton), along with 21st century Doctor Who panel Phil Collinson (Producer/Executive Producer), Pete McTighe (Writer) and Joy Wilkinson (Writer).\n\n‚Ä¢ Looking for Lennie, a documentary investigating the life of director Lennie Mayne. ‚Ä¢ Keeping up with the Jones‚Äô, which sees Katy Manning with Stewart Bevan (Cliff Jones) pay a return visit to the Welsh locations from The Green Death.\n\n‚Ä¢ Plus: a repeat omnibus of The Green Death unseen since Christmas 1973, rare Panopticon convention footage, Blu-ray trailer, HD photo galleries plus scripts, production files and rare documentation provided as PDFs.\n\n‚Ä¢ The six-disc box set also includes hours of extensive special features previously released on DVD including two episodes of The Sarah Jane Adventures that saw Katy Manning‚Äôs Jo Jones meet the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith).\n\nTom Baker ‚Äì Season 12 ‚Äì 1974-75\n\nAffiliate link to Amazon UK for potential buyers:\n\nSeason Twelve ‚Äì Episodes included:\n\nRobotüîµüîµ‚ö™‚ö™‚ö™\n\nThe Ark in Space‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\n\nThe Sontaran Experimentüîµüîµüîµüîµ‚ö™\n\nGenesis of the Daleks‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\n\nRevenge of the Cybermenüîµüîµüîµüîµ‚ö™\n\nFeatures\n\nNew Making-Of documentary and updated special effects for Logopolis\n\nRevealing new 2019 commentaries moderated by Matthew Sweet (Tom Baker on The Leisure Hive, Lalla Ward & Rachel Davies on State Of Decay)\n\nSurround sound mix for Warriors‚Äô Gate\n\nRare behind-the-scenes footage from The Leisure Hive, Full Circle and Logopolis\n\nEight more editions of Behind The Sofa\n\nBrand new documentaries The Writers Room and Weekend With Waterhouse\n\nNew interview with K9 & Company‚Äôs Ian Sears\n\nAnother dip into the Panopticon convention archives with Tom Baker\n\nHD photo galleries plus scripts, production files and rare documentation provided as PDFs\n\nThe eight-disc box set also includes hours of extensive special features previously released on DVD.\n\nAll material has been remastered for Blu-ray by Peter Crocker and Mark Ayres.
