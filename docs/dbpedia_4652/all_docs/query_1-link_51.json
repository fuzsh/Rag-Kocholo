        "text": "Whether at home, on the go, or attending a live event, immersive audio delivers an incredibly lifelike three-dimensional audio experience to listeners. Unlike stereo surround sound, where left and right speakers create the illusion of sound coming from different directions, immersive audio offers an experiential level of depth and realism unlike anything we've heard from traditional 2D surround solutions.\n\nCreating a more realistic, immersive sound experience for listeners by simulating sound coming from all around them, including above and below, immersive audio adds height and dimension to what we hear and listen to. By placing sound all around us, immersive audio transports listeners into a deeper, more exhilarating audio listening experience.\n\nImmersive audio is compatible with a wide range of consumer devices and can be streamed on various platforms, making it accessible to broad audiences. If you are looking to learn ways to tap into the unlimited potential of immersive audio technology, you are in the right place.\n\n\"Here's a little secret, consumers love digital audio. From live to podcasts to talk—the brand opportunities are endless with the power of digital audio.\" - SXM Media\n\nImmersive audio places listeners right in the middle of the action. Whether watching a movie, playing a video game, or listening to music, immersive audio allows listeners to feel like they are part of the story.\n\nApplications of Immersive Audio\n\nGet ready to immerse yourself in a whole new world of audio with a wide range of formats available in the market. The market is buzzing with popular formats i.e., Dolby Atmos, DTS:X, Auro-3D, MPEG-H, and Sony 360 Reality Audio, each promising to take consumer listening experiences to the next level. While each format uses distinct techniques and technologies, all aim to deliver an unparalleled three dimensional listening experience.\n\nDolby Atmos, DTS:X and MPEG-H are some of the main 3D audio standards, each using object-based technologies to mix and render sound to give the impression of it surrounding you spherically.\n\nWhat is 3D Audio?\n\n3D Audio is an umbrella term for a number of immersive audio technologies which surround the listener with sound. 3D Audio comes in various forms, but once you hear 3D Audio you’ll know it.\n\nImagine being transported to a whole new world where sound envelops you from every direction. This is the magic of 3D audio. Going far beyond what a traditional ‘physical’ 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound setup can achieve, 3D audio gives the impression of sound surrounding listeners spherically. Some applications of 3D audio include music, movies, gaming, and virtual world and augmented reality experiences. Whether listening via headphones, a soundbar, smart speakers, a mobile device, gaming console, in your car or through a streaming device, listeners can enjoy the ultimate audio experience wherever they are.\n\nSome examples of 3D Audio features include Apple's Spatial Audio with Dolby Atmos, Sony's 360 Reality Audio and PS5 3D Audio, Dolby Atmos Music, Yamaha's 3D Sound Field, Sennheiser's AMBEO and Creative's Super X-Fi holography technology.\n\nBenefits of Immersive Audio for Brands\n\nAccording to the Global 3D Audio Industry report, the global market for 3D Audio estimated at $4.8B in the year 2020, is projected to reach $13.7 billion industry by 2027.\n\nLooking to take your marketing efforts to the next level? Consider incorporating immersive audio to create a more engaging and memorable experience for your audiences. Here are a few ways brands can benefit from immersive audio:\n\nEnhance brand storytelling: In a business where last impression wins, 3D audio can work exceptionally well in marketing campaigns, creating a connection with audiences by transporting your audience to the heart of your brand story.\n\nEnhanced realism and immersion - with sound coming from all directions, you can create a more vivid and memorable experience that will stay with your customers long after the campaign has ended.\n\nIncreased emotional impact - create interactive digital content and experiences which allow consumers to engage with your brand in a fresh, new way. For example, a tourism bureau could create a 3D audio tour of their top destinations, allowing potential visitors to explore and learn more about the uniqueness of your destination.\n\nAmplify events: If you are hosting an event or product launch, immersive audio can help create a more memorable and engaging experience for in-person attendees. By placing speakers strategically around the venue, brands can create a soundscape which envelops the audience and helps to build excitement and anticipation.\n\nGreater depth and dimension - Brands incorporating audio into their e-commerce website will create and deliver a more engaging and immersive shopping experience every time. For example, a retail brand could use 3D audio to navigate users through a digital store twin or virtual showroom, allowing users to interact with products in a distinctly engaging way. Incorporating spatial audio cues, i.e., directional sound and ambient noise, the brand can create a realistic environment guiding users through a space while highlighting key features and benefits of their offerings.\n\nTrends and the future of Immersive Audio\n\nWith the 3D Audio Industry preparing to boom, advancements in immersive audio technology will expand along with potential future applications of the technology. Before launching an 'immersive audio' campaign, brand marketers must make considerations for how their consumers currently experience audio. The capabilities of immersive audio technology versus a consumer's actual listening experience depends on various factors such as the specific technology being used, the quality of the audio content, and the listener's unique preferences. Christina Struck of LAWO said it best, '...audio's role is to convey emotions. The best way to achieve this is to create the impression that viewers always have the best seat in the house.\"\n\nThe time is now. Immersive consumer devices have become increasingly present on the market and with consumers having the ability to experience immersive audio more easily than ever, marketers can expect demand for immersive content to increase. Don't miss the opportunity to tap into the power of sound.\n\nUp Next: Spatial Audio, what it is, consumer expectations and how brands can use the technology now.\n\nI acknowledge the traditional custodians of the lands in which I work and extend my deepest respect.\n\nFuture so bright."
