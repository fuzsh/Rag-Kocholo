        "text": "When Doctor Who first materialised on screens, the eerie sound effects created by the BBC’s pioneering Radiophonic Workshop terrified viewers.\n\nNow the first Doctor Who episode broadcast in “immersive 3D sound” promises to have viewers hiding behind the sofa once again.\n\nKnock Knock, a creepy, haunted-house set story to be shown this Saturday, will be made available in a special edition, using pioneering sound technology being developed by the BBC.\n\n“Binaural Doctor Who should have people hiding behind the sofa again.” BBC audio scientist Chris Pike\n\nThe “binaural” audio track gives the impression of specific sounds being in front or behind the viewer.\n\nViewers wearing headphones, who play the episode on the iPlayer, will enjoy a 3D surround sound experience, designed to enhance the story’s scare factor.\n\nChris Pike, senior scientist at the BBC’s R&D audiolab, said: “The story is set in a creepy house with creaking floorboards any mysterious winds.”\n\n“We’ve been able to make it even scarier by adding the binaural effects to the soundtrack. It should have people hiding behind the sofa again.”\n\nThe Binaural sound production technique mimics the natural hearing cues created by our head and ears to create the impression of 3D sound.\n\nMr Pike added: “The technology allows us to create a richer 3D environment for the listener compared to listening to stereo programmes over headphones which gives a flat impression with sounds coming from inside the head.”\n\nBinaural BBC Proms\n\nThe Binaural sensation of placing a listener “inside the room” with performers and musicians has been tested at the BBC Proms.\n\nA concert last year was relayed using eight “hypercardioid” directional microphones to pick-up sound from the front, behind, above and below at the Royal Albert Hall.\n\nMore BBC radio dramas will be broadcast in a binaural format for headphone-wearing listeners tuning in on smartphones.\n\nRadiophonic pioneers\n\nBack in 1963, the eerie Doctor Who theme was created by the Radiophonic Workshop’s Delia Derbyshire using a plucked string, tape manipulation and oscillators.\n\nThe whooshing Tardis was produced by slowing down the sound of keys being scraped across a rusty piano string.\n\nVR experiences\n\nBinaural is a vital component of the Virtual Reality experiences that the BBC R&D team are developing. The Turning Forest, the BBC’s first VR interactive film, was recorded on location in a forest using 20 microphones to create an immersive, sound experience which changes depending on the headset-wearing viewer’s orientation.\n\nMr Pike said: “Binaural also has good applications for natural history shows like Planet Earth, where you hear the distinctive sound of an animal moving into shot.”\n\nBut for dramas like Doctor Who, binaural works best when the sweeping orchestral backing is turned down, leaving a more spartan, atmospheric soundtrack."
