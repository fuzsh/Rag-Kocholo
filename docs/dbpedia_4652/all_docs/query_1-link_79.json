        "text": "this is your problem..\n\nyou are attempting to playback a STEREO file in 5.1 without any knowledge of UP-MIXING (the process of expanding a stereo track to 5.1) as far as i know itunes wmp winamp etc., can not and WILL not do this without some sort of plugin. UNLESS your speakers had a digital reciever in them that would do Dolby Digital PROLOGIC upmixing on your stereo source, which they do not.\n\nso, you will either need to find a plugin to upmix the stereo source to 5.1, or invest in a Home Theater Reciever to do this for you.\n\nthat is unless your sound card has a driver package that allows for upmixing. some do, but i do not use creative so i could not tell you.\n\nfor movies, you can download and use AC3Filter which will allow you to upmix a stereo source to 5.1 (it uses Dolby Prologic technology), it does a great job.\n\nas far as iTunes goes, i don't use that either, so i can not offer you help in finding a plugin (if they even exist), however if you used Winamp, you could use http://www.winamp.com/plugins/details.php?id=129453 or http://www.winamp.com/plugins/details.php?id=122003 i have used both in past with cards that do not upmix the audio for me, now they both (onboard) do...\n\nno no, you should use winamp 2.91, and it has a built in aac decoder so i don't know why it wouldn't work for you. it is the longest running music player for windows as far as i am aware. but the new one sucks balls.. it was bought out by aol and they made some awful changes. about the ipod, if you are ripping music to it, just use your itunes, you can access it like a hard drive right? if so, than you can play the music that is on it by dragging it to your winamp playlist.\n\nand wanting official name brand products is probably something a guru3d user shouldn't want.. it's all about getting the most out of what you can, and with winamp you can get the most out of your music, customizable with different visual plugins, different input and output audio plugins, remote control plugins, etc..\n\nbut, if name brand is important to you, than i say stick to your stereo sound with itunes.\n\nif getting the most out of your musical experience is important to you, you really should try winamp, or maybe you can configure foobar2000 to output to 5.1, never tried myself.. by the way, does your motherboard have on board 5.1 sound? if so, have you tried the configuration for it? they have come a very long way in the past years and most of them have options to upmix the audio for you, and the sound quality is pretty damn good.\n\nor buy an m-audio sound card as they come with SRS CircleSurround technology built into the drivers, they are the best brand name audio devices and SRS is the best at upmixing stereo music. whereas dolby is the best for movies.\n\nbut you mentioned you did not have money to spend on this, so you should really try making the most of the free software that is available to you. winamp 2.91 with one of the plugins i directed to your attention is probably the best bet to get 5.1 sound out of your stereo music files, for free.\n\nif you want to spend money, you really should invest in a home reciever/amplifier, or a new sound card that has better driver support for upmixing stereo sources..\n\nor you could look into creative's software offerings, perhaps they have something (you may even already have it installed) that can upmix to 5.1.. i wouldn't know as i highly dislike their products......... m-audio all the way."
