        "text": "I received the WE TV LIve Plus for Christmas. It is set up as follows: HDMI to Denon AVR-3808ci. Audio settings: Digital. My problem is I only get stereo sound from the HD videos. The Denon shows that ony 2 channel sound is being received. It will play 5.1 sound in ‘Music’, but not in “Video”. I know this as I downloaded a music only test file and can hear all of my speakers, and the Denon displays that 5.1 sound is being received. I also no that my system will correctly pass on HD audio/video over HDMI, as with the same settings/cable I get 5.1 sound and 1080p display when the signal originates from my blu-ray player.\n\nI am making an asumption that some of my video files are 5.1 sound, including the video files on WD sample files. However if someone could point me to a short HD audio/video download which I could copy to my USB, I could confirm my problem. Or if someone could suggest another means of confirm my sound problem. Note I can coreclty read and access files over my home network and also over the internet.\n\nThanks. I downloaded a few from the suggested site and yes I get 5.1 sound with video.\n\nI guess that means my other test samples and videos are only stereo.\n\nI appreciate the help.\n\nWhere your videos from ?\n\nIf they are recordings from a TV channel, then the WD Player still have a bug:\n\nThe player detects only at the beginning on a stream the Audio format. Is the format “Dolby Digital 2.0”, the Player transcode it to PCM 2.0 . Later, if the format changed to DD 5.1, the player still transcode it to PCM 2.0.\n\nMany TV-Channels broadcast DD 2.0 at default and switch it to 5.1 at the beginning of a 5.1 movie.\n\nThere is still no way to tell WD “leave all AC3 Tracks untouched; don’t change it to PCM”.\n\nThis may be a bug in the hardware or in …\n\nYou may use the TS-Doctor to change the AC3-Flag in your files: http://forum.cypheros.de/index.php?board=7.0\n\nHi - I am also experiencing the same problem. I have just purchased my WD HD Media Live and using the HDMI connection with the audio set to Digital, I only get stereo sound input via my Denon 2810 AV receiver.\n\nI know that the video formats on my external drive carry 5.1 sound as I have been able to verify this via the XBOX 360.\n\nI’ve also tried using the optical input but again, only get stereo sound.\n\nCan anyone help?"
