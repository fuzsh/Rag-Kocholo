        "text": "With the increasing popularity of HDTV, watching a DVD movie at home is a great entertainment experience. The picture is sharp, clear, and vibrant. But what about the sound? After all, that is one of the real attractions of going to a movie theater, the wraparound sound that lets you hear every detail. So is there a way to bring that kind of audio into our homes too? Absolutely!\n\nSurround sound has been around for a while now in one form or another, but it never had a platform to bring it into the mainstream before HDTV and digital media like the DVD became so available and popular. But now by combining the right equipment, a person can actually very closely simulate the movie theater experience right in the comfort of their home whenever they want.\n\nFor surround sound, you will need three things:\n\nA digital source that has surround sound already encoded into it such as a DVD or a HDTV broadcast\n\nEquipment to decode that surround sound signal\n\nAt least 6 speakers including a subwoofer to take full advantage of the most popular 5.1 surround sound format. It’s called 5.1 because it use 5 channels of sound to drive 5 separate speakers, and the .1 stands for the low-frequency subwoofer.\n\nOnce you have the equipment you need to establish a surround sound installation that will be right for your home.

We can actually assist you in equipment selection, surround sound installation and instruct you in the use of your new equipment.\n\nCall us today to schedule a free consultation!"
