So naturally I'm going to want to watch the superior stream.\n\nBased on what we know of codecs and bitrates for those services, which will be the best experience?\n\nFurther question, I have both apps on the Philips TV (Android), PS5, and Xbox Series X. Are there any known quality differences between those versions?\n\nFirst of all it is better to watch on your Philips TV (Android) App compared to PS5/XBOX which compromise on video streaming quality.\n\nCan you get HDR HLG as iPlayer in UK supports it on flagship TV's by Sony, LG internal BBC iPLayer App. I don't know if it will be streamed in HDR HLG, but if it is then thats the best way.\n\nBit Rate will be higher in HDR HLG for sure compared to normal SDR.\n\nfind out if Disney will stream in HDR if so then I do not know which will be better quality between iPLayer and Disney.\n\nThe new series of Doctor Who will release on BBC iPlayer (UK) and Disney+ (rest of world) simultaneously, and my VPN situation means I can choose one or the other.\n\nI am a Whovian and someone who has invested a lot in some good AV equipment, 4K HDR TV and a Dolby Atmos surround.

If you want the best viewing experience watch Dr Who on D+, where you’ll get full HD and surround sound.\n\nBBC is pushing iPlayer at every opportunity yet the platform is just not fit for purpose. Linear HD TV is delivered at 1080i/p, with 5.1 audio, where available, yet iPlayer only offers 720p picture quality (there are a few cases where 1080p is available on some hardware) and only 2.0 audio. The 4K HLG HDR offerings are rare, but again, these only deliver 2.0 sound.\n\nOn BBC1HD, previous episodes of Dr Who (I’m not a fan) that I’ve caught in passing have had 5.1, so it might be an idea, perhaps, to buy a Freeview PVR if you can’t watch live, so that a decent level of playback quality is a given when you want it.\n\niPlayer does not support the delivery of 5.1 audio.

Disappointingly the 60th anniversary specials and the Christmas episode all had sections where I couldn't make out the dialogue. The Blu Rays are the same. I don't have this issue with anything else I watch. I hope tonight's episodes are ok.\n\nBri\n\nI think that that article is misleading. The way that I read it is that UHD and 5.1 audio is an either/or scenario.\n\nThe BBC has told me on more than one occasion when I’ve complained that iPlayer can’t deliver 4K picture with 5.1 audio. The service can apparently deliver 5.1 audio — the BBC was testing it before the pandemic, and there’s a list somewhere that details which TVs will support 1080p when using iPlayer, but that list hasn’t been updated for years, nor, to my knowledge has the app. seen any major updates.\n\nI really want to be proved wrong here. For iPlayer to deliver 5.1 audio with 4K picture, even 1080p, consistently, would be a major step forward, even if it was, to begin with, just live TV. I think however that I’ll be waiting fir a long, long time yet.\n\nI think that that article is misleading.

I think however that I’ll be waiting fir a long, long time yet.\n\nRe-reading that report, I fear that you may be right in what they meant.\n\nHowever, undeterred, and spurred on by a few other reports from people confirming DD+ on iPlayer, I have done some testing. Now it is not exhaustive but it's my experience.\n\nUsing my LG C8 OLED, feeding Optical Out to the AVM70, and viewing Doctor Who UHD Ep 1 (Ncuti Gatwa) via the onboard iPlayer app, the AVM70 indicates DD as the input audio. Audio is 2.0 stereo.\n\nViewing some basic Freeview shopping channel (which I would expect to be stereo at best) indicated stereo.\n\nSwitching the LG audio to TV speakers + Optical (which I know will only send stereo to optical, an annoying feature of the C8, I never wanted to mess around with the vagaries of ARC) indicates as stereo on the AVM70.\n\nNow to the Firestick. There are no obvious settings to force it to output DD+\n\nAVM70 and iPlayer from Firestick - indicated DD+ for Doctor Who UHD (resuming from where I stopped playback on LG's iPlayer). Actual audio is 2.0 (stereo in other words).\n\nTried another iPlayer programme, same result. DD+ but 2.0 stereo audio.\n\nSo it looks like iPlayer might be outputting audio (all content?) as DD/DD+ BUT thw actual audio contained is 2.0\n\nYes, it could be my false interpretation of things (and apologies but I might have missed some things to test} but could this be something like a proving exercise to see what is technically possible without causing issues (the initial phase of a blind test}, before moving on to actual content.\n\nA quick listen using the DTS Neural X and Dolby Surround upmixers gave a reasonable 5.1 image, Didn't think to test Anthem's own upmixer though (AnthemLogic Movie)"
