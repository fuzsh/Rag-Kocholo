        "text": "Basic Setup\n\nFirst make sure that you have the Output Routing of your Channel Strips in your Mixer set to Surround.\n\nThe six channels of the 5.1 format are routed to six output channels on your audio interface. They are represented by the six Output Channel Strips.\n\nThe Master Chanel Strip is a VCA Master Fader for the six Output Channel Strips. Put a Meter Plugin on that Channel to have a better reading of what level is going on on what channel.\n\nOnce you are sure that you have a valid Surround Mix going on in your Project, you can bounce it as an interleaved 5.1 surround mix or as six discrete split channels. For delivery of you score, you might want to sent the split channels. Often you just sent individual Stems (stereo or mono) and at the dubbing stage the mixer creates the surround mix putting stems in various surround channels. Delivering a fixed 5.1 mix is too restrictive, unless it is a 5.1 surround recording of a live orchestra.\n\nWord of advice: Audio production is already complicated enough which requires a lot of expertise and experience, entering the realm of surround just turns it up a notch. Especially when you hand over a surround mix or stems, make sure the receiving part (post production supervisor, editor, etc) know what they are doing. If it just your buddy making his first short film on iMovie, then you have to keep an eye on it.\n\nTo check (play back) a surround sound file, you have to have an audio interface and monitoring system set up. You can feed it the separate channels or play it back through the QuickTime Player. If you want to play it back through your home theatre system, then you have to encode it (Dolby Digital, DTS). Yor receiver will then take care of the \"distribution\" to the individual speakers.\n\nMy book \"Logic Pro X - The Details\" has a separate chapter about \"Surround Sound\" that explains on 23 pages how to use surround sound in Logic.\n\nHope that helps\n\nEdgar Rothermich - LogicProGEM.com\n\n(Author of the \"Graphically Enhanced Manuals\")\n\nhttp://DingDingMusic.com/Manuals/\n\n'I may receive some form of compensation, financial or otherwise, from my recommendation or link.'\n\nDrew777 wrote:\n\nI'm sure this is a simple fix\n\nActually, it is not quite as simple and requires a trip down to the \"scary\" Environment. Are you comforable with that?\n\nFirst of all, you need an audio interface with mutlple output channels\n\nIn the Environment, you can create Environment Objects for each Output Channels (if it hasn't done so automatically)\n\nKeep in mind that each Channel Strip in the Mixer is just a representation of an Environment Object\n\nAlso keep in mind that for the Output Chanel Strips you switch between a stereo object (ch 1-2) and two individual objects (ch1, ch2). In the mixer click the Input Button on the Output Channel Strip (on circle = mono, double circle = stereo)\n\nIn the Mixer Window, select the \"All\" tab on top of the Mixer Window (this shows all the Environment Objects)\n\nCreate Tracks for each Output Channel that you need so it will show up in the Mixer Window when you switch the Mixer view to \"Track\". This view displays only Channel Strips that have a Track assigned to it.\n\nThis is basically what I did to create the Mixer in the screenshot.\n\nAlso keep in mind that, once you switch your Project to Surround, the Master Channel Strip has a much more important function thatn in a Stero Project. Also, the Output Channels cannot have any Plugins anymore, they must be placed on the Master Channel Strip.\n\nAs you can see, there are a lot of details to take care of when working in Surround (as you experienced already)\n\nHope that helps\n\nEdgar Rothermich - LogicProGEM.com\n\n(Author of the \"Graphically Enhanced Manuals\")\n\nhttp://DingDingMusic.com/Manuals/\n\n'I may receive some form of compensation, financial or otherwise, from my recommendation or link.'"
