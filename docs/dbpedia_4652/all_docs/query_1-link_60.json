        "text": "Yamaha YHT-4950U 5.1 Channel Home Theater System\n\nEnhance Your TV Sound with a Balanced Sound Experience\n\nThis 5.1-channel home theater system comes with an AV receiver and a speaker package (one center channel, two front channel and two surround speakers, plus a subwoofer), to deliver a clear, balanced sound for any listening experience. Enjoy your favorite movies, TV shows, music and video games, all with one, easy system.\n\nFull 4K Ultra HD HDMI Support\n\nProviding complete compatibility with the latest HDMI standards, the AV receiver in this package delivers transmission of 4K video at 60 frames/second pass-through. It also supports HDR (high dynamic range) Video including Dolby Vision and Hybrid Log-Gamma which provides incredible contrast, smooth tone and rich, bright colors—giving you full, high-definition enjoyment with an exceptionally realistic and natural picture quality.\n\nExperiences Expanded with CINEMA DSP\n\nExclusive Yamaha CINEMA DSP technology supports playback of HD Audio (Dolby TrueHD, DTS-HD Master Audio, etc.), providing natural and expansive sound imaging. CINEMA DSP transforms the dynamics of the listening environment, with acoustic reproduction of famous venues such as the Bottom Line, Roxy Theater, and European cathedrals—letting you experience their ambience right in your room.\n\nEvery Room is Different, Optimize with YPAO\n\nYPAO (Yamaha Parametric room Acoustic Optimizer) analyzes the room acoustics and your system, then precisely adjusts various audio parameters to provide the best sound for your room. By placing the supplied microphone at your listening position and switching YPAO on, the system is automatically tuned for optimum performance in your home.\n\nDiscrete Amp Configuration Built for Performance\n\nThe included AV receiver was designed with a strong focus on achieving exceptionally high clarity sound. It employs a discrete amp configuration and a low-jitter PLL circuit, which contributes to its excellent audio performance.\n\nFeel Your Lows - Rich Bass Reproduction\n\nThis exclusive low-range enhancement technology delivers richer bass than you would expect from smaller sized speakers while maintaining good localization and sound balance even with compact front speakers. When a subwoofer is used, it improves the volume of the entire low range of the speaker system, not only the front speakers, but also enhancing the bass from the subwoofer. You'll enjoy video and music with sound that has exceptional power and presence.\n\nVirtual Surround CINEMA FRONT\n\nEven when it is impossible to install surround speakers behind the listening position, you can enjoy virtual 5-channel surround sound with all of the speakers placed in the front of the room.\n\nBluetooth with Room Enhancer\n\nThanks to its built-in Bluetooth functionality, this receiver lets you enjoy easy wireless music playback from smartphones and other devices. The Compressed Music Enhancer from Yamaha is now optimized for Bluetooth audio transmissions to ensure that your music will have vivid, dynamic sound quality during wireless playback.\n\nConfigured Scene Settings\n\nPressing a SCENE button powers on the AV receiver or remote selects the input source and DSP mode. You can re-set the buttons for different sources by selecting a source and DSP mode, then pressing a SCENE button for more than three seconds.\n\nEasy to Install\n\nAV App Steup Guide\n\nUse this special app and get expert assistance with cable connections between the AV receiver and source devices. It even guides you through various other settings such as speaker connections, TV and source device connections and power amplifier assignments.\n\nGo Green with ECO Mode\n\nWhen ECO Mode is turned on it can reduce power consumption by about 20 percent*, thanks to an advanced energy saving design. *Compared to power consumption when ECO mode is off (Yamaha measurement).\n\nA Traditional Classy Design Enhances Any Room\n\nThe included speakers feature the elegant beauty of a fine musical instrument. Their clean, stylish appearance matches their high sound quality while their compact design allows them to be placed in any convenient location within the listening room. Keyhole openings in the back allow these speakers to be neatly mounted on a wall.\n\nAll About That Bass - Advanced YST II Produces Powerful Low End\n\nThe Advanced YST II subwoofer combines negative-impedance and constant current principles to drive the speaker cone with tight control. It optimizes effective speaker impedance to maintain stable and accurate low range response and high sound pressure levels, for more natural and energetic bass reproduction.\n\nReceiver Specifications:\n\n• Channels: 5.1\n\n• Rated output power (1 kHz, 1 ch driven): 100 watts (8 ohms, 0.9% THD)\n\n• Rated output power (20-20,000 Hz, 2 ch driven): 70 watts (8 ohms, 0.9 THD)\n\n• Max effective output power (1 kHz, 1 ch driven - JEITA): 145 watts (6 ohms, 10% THD)\n\n• Dynamic power / channel (front L/R, 8/6/4/2 ohms): 110/130/160/180 watts\n\n• Sound processing: Cinema DSP, 17 DSP programs, Dialog Level Adjustment, SILENT Cinema / Virtual Cinema DSP, Dolby TrueHD, Dolby Digital Plus, DTS-HD Master Audio\n\n• Audio file format: MP3, WMA, MPEG-4 ACC, WAV up to 48 kHz/16-bit\n\n• Audio features: Compressed Music Enhancer, YPAO Sound Optimization, Adaptive DRC (Dynamic Range Control), initial volume and max volume setting, audio delay (0-500 ms), DA converter (Burr-Brown 384 kHz/32-bit DAC x 3)\n\n• Video features: 4K Ultra HD pass-through & upscaling (4K/60p, 4:4:4), HDMI 3D pass-through, HDMI eARC, HDMI audio return channel, HDMI upscaling, Deep Color / x.v.Color / 24 Hz refresh rate / auto lip-sync\n\n• HDMI input/output: 4/1 (HDCP 2.2, HDR10, Dolby Vision, HLG and BT.2020 compatible)\n\n• Front AV inputs: USB, mini jack\n\n• Digital optical input/output: 1/0\n\n• Digital coaxial input/output: 2/0\n\n• Analog audio input/output: 3/0\n\n• Composite video input/output: 3/1\n\n• Subwoofer preout: Yes\n\n• Headphone output: Yes (1/4\")\n\n• Bluetooth: Yes (SBC, in and out)\n\n• FM/AM tuner: Yes\n\n• User interface: On-screen display, SCENE (4 sets), remote control unit\n\n• Power saving: Auto power standby, ECO mode\n\n• Power requirements: 120 VAC, 60 Hz\n\n• Dimensions: 17-1/8\" W x 6-3/8\" H x 12-3/8\" D"
