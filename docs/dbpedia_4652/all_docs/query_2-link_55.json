        "text": "Thank you all for your interest. Here are 3 hmt files.\n\n1) King of Thieves_20220605_2236.hmt is the original, generated by the Hummy, which plays in surround.\n\n2) King of Thieves_20220605_2236 (scarpkg).hmt I generated using the sidecar package, from the original ts file. This plays in surround.\n\n3) King of Thieves m2ts.hmt I generated using the sidecar package, from an m2ts file, which I exported from VideoRedo, and then changed the extension to .ts. This only plays in stereo.\n\nI suppose it is possible that the problem lies in my m2ts file? I set VideoRedo to output AAC 5.1. and VideoRedo properties confirm that the file has 6 channel audio, but some may be empty?\n\nAttachments\n\nKing of Thieves_20220605_2236 (scarpkg).hmt\n\nKing of Thieves m2ts.hmt\n\nKing of Thieves_20220605_2236.hmt\n\nI will try generated sidecar files, using the package, for my MP4 file.\n\nYou can't. sidecar is for recreating the .hmt and .nts helper, or \"sidecar\", files which are normally generated by the HDR-FOX in the process of making a recording, and therefore only applies to native (or recreated) [M2]TS files.\n\nThe reason I asked about MP4 is because the HDR-FOX will play them from USB or if imported, and was curious whether you would get 2.0 or 5.1.\n\nbut had no sidecar files, which I now know causes this problem.\n\nThat it needs the appropriate flag in the .htm file before it will output 5.1 from a recording is not a prediction of how it will behave with an MP4 file (or any other format). The .htm flag theory is not yet conclusive either.\n\nIs ffmpeg a package which I can install with webif?\n\nIt is almost certainly already installed as a dependency of the web-if package, and available to be called from the command line. However, it is also useful to download to your PC (the Windows version, that is), and become familiar with it. Ditto ffprobe.\n\nSince then I have copied my edited MP4 and MKV versions to a portable USB drive (which I normally use with the Hummy) and connected this direct to my LG Home Theatre. Both play fine with surround sound! This proves that I do not have a problem editing and saving surround sound from VideoRedo, the problem is getting Hummy to recognise them as surround sound after editing.\n\nOn the face of it this a solution to my problem, just play surround sound back through the LG and don't bother the Hummy! Unfortunately the only USB socket on the LG is on the front panel, behind the disc flap, so this is not very elegant as a permanent solution\n\nThe LG has an unused Ethernet port on the rear, so I was wondering if I can connect a portable HDD to this somehow? USB/Ethernet adapters are cheap, but I believe these expect a USB controller, like a laptop without Ethernet. Probably will not work the other way around with a dumb HDD in the USB end?\n\nThank you for your thoughts, some very interesting ideas here. I believe the LG will stream content from LAN, although I have never tried it.\n\nConnecting the LG to LAN is awkward, as the TV equipment is in the opposite corner of the house to the PC and router.... I have an ethernet over mains adapter for the Hummy. I expect I could plug an ethernet switch into this, so the Hummy and LG could share?\n\nAre you saying that the Hummy would work as a server if I put the HDD back on it? That would be good.\n\nI was just going to say that my router does not have USB, but looking at it, yes it does! I have plugged my HDD into the router, but haven't managed to see it from my PC yet. More investigation needed.\n\nAre you saying that the Hummy would work as a server if I put the HDD back on it? That would be good\n\nAbsolutely (It pays tell us what you actually want as an end result rather than taking the long route)! You have at least two options for this:\n\nWithout custom firmware, the HDR-FOX has a built-in DLNA server capability. DLNA is the industry standard for media sharing between consumer devices, because it is auto-discovery and does not require the user to configure IP addresses etc. Menu >> Settings >> System >> Internet Setting >> Content Share = ON. Navigation is by menus formatted by the DLNA system.\n\nIf you find HiDef recording are not listed, that will be because the TV has not authenticated itself as a display-only device. That can by bypassed by installing the CF auto-unprotect package.\n\nWith custom firmware, you can configure the HDR-FOX as as SMB server (samba package) and/or NFS server (nfs-utils package). This is raw data access similar to plugging in a USB drive.\n\nI have an ethernet over mains adapter for the Hummy. I expect I could plug an ethernet switch into this, so the Hummy and LG could share?\n\nYes that will work.\n\n...and what's more, with a switch the network traffic will (or should) go directly between the HDR-FOX and the TV, without passing through the HomePlug network (nasty).\n\nI was just going to say that my router does not have USB, but looking at it, yes it does! I have plugged my HDD into the router, but haven't managed to see it from my PC yet. More investigation needed.\n\nUsing a USB device with the router to provide network accessible storage will require enabling in the router control panel (if available at all). Typically, the router's web control panel will be accessible on <netmask>.254 (eg 192.168.1.254 â€“ whatever's appropriate for your network). If that doesn't work, check the instructions for your particular router.\n\nMany thanks.\n\nThe USB on my router is evidently to connect a modem, does not support storage\n\nAnyway, I found an ethernet switch in my cupboard and that works well between Hummy and LG. I can now see the files on Hummy's internal drive from the LG and stream them over the ethernet connection. They play with glorious surround sound!!\n\nThat's a good enough fix for what I want to do, although I still cannot see why the Hummy cannot play the edited surround sound\n\nI am not however able to see the files on the USB HDD, plugged into the Hummy, from the LG. Yes, I do have custom firmware on my Hummy, but my knowledge of Networking is VERY basic! If I were able to reconfigure as SMB or NFS, as you suggest, would that enable me to see the USB hdd as well? That would be nice."
