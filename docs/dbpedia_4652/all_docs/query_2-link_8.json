        "text": "I am watching pose on the iplayer and comparing the sound to the broadcast version, its not really showing the program at its best. In a few weeks time, it will move to Netflix and it will be in surround sound.\n\nI know that the player doesn't support surround sound, but does anyone know, who, how where we can start a campaign to get this added. After all, it will now be the only streaming service that doesn't supply this.\n\nIt's not on ITV Hub, ALL4 or My 5 either, only on pay services. It will be on YouTube to subscribers soon. Although I have it very few people do, it is unlikely that members of the public can tell the difference between genuine surround sound from a sound bar without rear speakers and pseudo surround generated by the bar itself. It is also unlikely that they will have read the manual and set the bar up properly either. This is why neither ITV nor Ch 5 have bothered with it.\n\n1\n\nWhy is it all bbc shows that were on 5.1 sound on transmitted tv are not when you download from catch up\n\nCan the BBC afford to pay Dolby is probably a major issue .....\n\nmore Won't than can't yet they use it on useless shows like match of the day\n\nProbably more of a steaming problem as all of their 5.1 shows are only in stereo on iPlayer like several other providers of free streaming. They could use Dolby 2 channel surround which most surround sound systems are compatible with, Media City's studios have PLII encoders/decoders available, no doubt others do as well. provided you don't use the Dolby logo there shouldn't be a problem You may need to re-pan the main channels slightly in post production due to the logic system but that should be a simple task.\n\n1\n\nWhy is it all bbc shows that were on 5.1 sound on transmitted tv are not when you download from catch up\n\nCan the BBC afford to pay Dolby is probably a major issue .....\n\nmore Won't than can't yet they use it on useless shows like match of the day\n\nProbably more of a steaming problem as all of their 5.1 shows are only in stereo on iPlayer like several other providers of free streaming.

All series/serials I record direct others via catch up and they are all same format sound as the broadcast.\n\n0\n\nWhy is it all bbc shows that were on 5.1 sound on transmitted tv are not when you download from catch up\n\nCan the BBC afford to pay Dolby is probably a major issue .....\n\nmore Won't than can't yet they use it on useless shows like match of the day\n\nProbably more of a steaming problem as all of their 5.1 shows are only in stereo on iPlayer like several other providers of free streaming.

Just using a better codec in stereo would solve that as YouTube does not have this problem and they're using royalty free codecs these days so no excuses not to at least have this as an option for equipment that supports it.\n\nIts sad that 4K on iPlayer is some of the best quality of any streaming service, yet their HD content is some of the worst in picture and sound quality.\n\n1"
