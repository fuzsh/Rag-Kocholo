The new curves can then be saved as presets for future recall.\n\nSystem Q Sound Control\n\nFive factory pre-set equalization curves (Rock, Top40, Pops, Jazz and Easy, plus a flat setting) and three speaker matching curves (OEM, 6x9, 5/4 plus a flat setting) that can be combined to give the user extreme flexibility over the sound's tonal character. The preset curves include midrange contouring, giving music more clarity and presence. The preset curves can also be combined with the unit's bass, midrange and treble controls allowing users to personalize the sound to their particular taste.\n\nSystem QEX\n\nSound control system that incorporates extremely sophisticated user control of bass and treble compensation. The user can select from several bass and treble center frequencies, vary the compensation level in nearly 1dB increments, and select from 3 different bass Q factors. There is also a Bass Expander with a custom Q factor that is 25% wider below the center frequency, providing deep bass enhancement without affecting the lower midrange. Up to 6 different combinations of settings and adjustments can be saved as User Presets.\n\nT\n\nTHXÂ® Adaptive Decorrelation\n\nLucasfilm-developed circuitry that alters the phase or pitch relationship between the left and right surround speakers to produce a more enveloping surround sound field when the surround channels are receiving a mono signal. When the surround signal is stereo, Adaptive Decorrelation automatically switches off.\n\nTHXÂ® Bass Peak-Level Manager\n\nLets the user set the maximum LFE-channel output level for their system, so as not to overload and possibly damage subwoofers or bass drivers in full-range speakers.\n\nTHXÂ® Front-Channel Re-Equalization\n\nLucasfilm-developed circuitry that reduces the high-frequency response of the front channels, compensating for film soundtracks that can sound overly-bright when played in living room-sized rooms.\n\nTHXÂ® Loudspeaker Position Time Synchronization\n\nCompensates for the different distances between the listening position and each speaker in a home theater, creating a more cohesive, believable surround sound experience.\n\nTHXÂ® Select Certification\n\nMeets standards established by Lucasfilm for audio performance, user interface, construction and compatibility with other THX-certified products.\n\nTHXÂ® Timbre-Matching\n\nLucasfilm-developed circuitry that equalizes the response of the surround channels, creating smoother sound movement between channels.\n\nTHXÂ® Ultra Certification\n\nMeets standards established by Lucasfilm for audio performance, user interface, construction and compatibility with other THX-certified products. THX Ultra certified products have power and performance designed to reproduce film soundtracks with very high accuracy in a wide range of acoustic environments.\n\nTIL Voice Coil Bobbin\n\nTIL is a glass fiber-reinforced polyamide film that is heat resistant, maintaining its shape even in the larger coils used in high-power woofers. This increases the speaker's power handling and reliability.\n\nTime Alignment\n\nA feature of DSP, Time Alignment allows the users to adjust sound based on the distance between the listener and the speakers. Sound can be adjusted from 0 to 20.3 feet.\n\nTime and Source Color Modes\n\nFeatures of the ColorShock display. Time Color Mode varies the display color every 6 hours: red at 6: 00 AM, yellow at noon, light blue at 6:00 PM and dark blue at midnight. Source Color Mode lets the user assign a different display color for each source.\n\nTonorexÂ® Power Supply Capacitors\n\nAudio filter capacitors designed to minimize sources of internal vibration, which reduces distortion and improves sound quality. Tonorex capacitors also feature improved efficiency and reduced current leakage.\n\nTornado Woofer Cone\n\nA pearl mica injection-molded polypropylene cone that is formed with 3 raised circumferential ridges around the cone. The width of the ridges is graduated, making a Ã¢â¬ÅtornadoÃ¢â¬Â-like appearance. The ridges make the Tornado Cone much more rigid than conventional parabolic cones, with resonances that are more than an octave higher. Additionally, the Tornado Cone's resonances are of a more random nature than those of conventional cones, which reduces their intensity. Since these resonances are lower in amplitude and far above the woofer's useable frequency range, they are much less audible, producing markedly clearer, more detailed bass sound.\n\nTouch-Tone Buttons\n\nProduces an audible tone each time a function key is pressed.\n\nTouch-Tone Keys\n\nProduces an audible tone each time a function key is pressed.\n\nTrack Naming\n\nLets the user program a title for each track on each disc. The disc player reads the disc data and displays the name on its display.\n\nTruBass\n\nTruBass is a patented SRS technology that enhances bass performance utilizing proprietary psychoacoustic techniques. These techniques restore the perception of fundamental low frequency tones by dynamically augmenting harmonics, which are more easily reproduced by contemporary loudspeakers. TruBass takes the low frequency information contained within the original audio track and helps speakers or headphones re-create it -- even if it is below the devices low frequency limitations.\n\nTuner Call during FF/REW\n\nAutomatically switches to the last-tuned radio station during tape fast-forward or rewind.\n\nU\n\nUrethane Surround\n\nSurround material with very high internal loss, which reduces speaker cone distortion.\n\nV\n\nVirtual Surround\n\nUses sophisticated digital processing to create a believable surround sound experience using just two left and right speakers.\n\nVoice Index on Tap\n\nSoftware included with ACDrive that allows audible voice index browsing of playlist, artist, album, genre and folder during playback in your car.\n\nW\n\nWAAS\n\nUsed in Mobile Navigation (like KENWOOD's KNA-G510 navigation unit), Wide Area Augmentation System is a ground-based sampling system that corrects errors in the GPS satellite signals and provides greater positional accuracy."
