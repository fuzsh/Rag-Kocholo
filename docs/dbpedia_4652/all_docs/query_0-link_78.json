Are any producers on this forum mixing in surround in this particular way?\n\nI know we can use five active monitors but we have sitting here a perfectly good Surround sound receiver and speakers already setup. Am I the only person to have thought of this?\n\nI contacted Focusrite directly but they seemed to have no idea.\n\nSorry Martin that’s VERY unlikely - just because there is an optical out doesn’t mean it will work\n\nthat output is most likely spdif (stereo) maybe even switchable to ADAT (8 channel) - these aren’t ‘surround’ formats\n\noptical (toslink) doesn’t have a huge amount of bandwidth - enough for stereo or compressed (dolby/DTS) multichannel …ADAT uses a different data format to squeeze the extra data in - it’s not what your amp is expecting so it won’t work.\n\nThere are (Expensive) boxes to do what you want but I don’t know of a cheap version - and some home AV amps have separate (LRCLsRsLFE) inputs for surround but if not then there isn’t really a simple way. It’s possible that some cheap audio cards built into the PC would do it ? - sometimes they have ‘surround capable’ toslink connectors but I have no idea if cubase could address these outputs individually for mixing purposes. It would need to do realtime AC3 encoding or something similar.\n\nWelcome to the wonderful world of surround - lots of ‘non’ standards - (+10db for LFE ? SMPTE channel order ? etc etc)"
