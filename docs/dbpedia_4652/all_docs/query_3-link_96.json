        "text": "Some corners of the universe have bred the most terrible things - they must be fought.\n\nThe Doctor, Fitz and Compassion are set to encounter an old enemy of his - the Fendahl! We take a look at The Taking of Planet 5.\n\nJoining us, as ever, are editor Steve Cole, plus writers Mark Clapham and Simon Bucher-Jones.\n\nThe Doctor, Fitz and their new friend Compassion are off to the Obverse.\n\nThe trio encounter a giant jade elephant, and a host of other strange, strange creatures, as well as humans on a spaceship.\n\nAnd if that wasn't enough, along comes the newly-regenerated Iris Wildthyme!\n\nWe chat with editor Steve Cole and co-author Paul Magrs, about how this little gem came to life.\n\nWe continue our look at the controversial Interference, as we examine its legacy in the Doctor Who universe.\n\nKenny and Matt discuss how they felt about it, as well as the Third Doctor's 'new' regeneration, featuring archival quotes from author Lawrence Miles.\n\nWe also chat to former Big Finish producer Gary Russell, about bringing Sam Jones to life on audio... for a day... before she disappeared.\n\nIt's hard for fans today to perhaps gauge how important was for Doctor Who fans in the dying days of the 20th century.\n\nLawrence Miles's two-part novel was discussed for months afterwards, and even now, still provokes an interesting debate.\n\nWe feature range editor Steve Cole, and feature an archive interview with Lawrence Miles, read for us by James Hadwin-Bennett.\n\nThe end is near for Samantha Jones's travels with the Eighth Doctor and Fitz.\n\nBut before she departs, she and her friends need to survive SS officers and a beings from another dimension.\n\nAs ever, author Steve Cole joins us with his insights, while David A McIntee recalls his experiences of writing the book.\n\nThis episode of Pieces of Eighth takes us to Sweden... and there's not a Muppet chef in sight.\n\nWe discuss this 1990s take on UNIT, and are joined by editor Steve Cole and writer Nick Walters, as we discuss the 22nd Eighth Doctor novel from the BBC Book.\n\nKenny and Matt also discuss the DWM review of Dominion.\n\nWe're heading back to the 1960s with the Doctor, Sam and Fitz.\n\nThere's a revolution in the air - and something else that smells a bit funny.\n\nWe're joined by range editor Steve Cole and author Paul Leonard, to discuss this EDA which was a big favourite of both Matt and Kenny when it was first published.\n\nThe Doctor and Sam have a new friend onboard the TARDIS - his name's Kreiner. Fitz Kreiner.\n\nFind out what happens on Space Station Vega, and how it ties in with a host of other books in the expanded Whoniverse.\n\nWe chat with Julian Richards, son of author Justin, as well as books range editor Steve Cole, and cover artist Tony Fleetwood.\n\nWe're back - at long last - for a brand new season of episodes.\n\nKenny is joined by Matt Michael for this run of 18 episodes, as we take a look back at the Eighth Doctor novels from BBC Books, starting with the arrival of Fitz Kreiner in Doctor Who and the Taint.\n\nWe've got lots of new content for you - the original character outline, his DWM reveal, plus what the DWM review said at the time, as well as chats with author Michael Collier (COUGH, COUGH), editor Steve Cole, and Rebecca Levene, who helped to co-create Fitz.\n\nOur new series starts here...\n\nAnd so, we're nearly there - Christmas is just a day away.\n\nBut we're going back to 21 December for today's episode, as we celebrate Winter of the Demon, Roy Gill's Eighth Doctor adventure with Charley and Audacity, which was released earlier this month.\n\nWe chat to Roy, sound designer Benji Clifford - and India Fisher pops by too!\n\nChristmas Day. It's always easy to remember, as it's on 25 December each year.\n\nExcept, in 2001, it wasn't - as the Eighth Doctor finds Harry Sullivan doing a crossword outside a cafe.\n\nWe're looking at 2018 Short Trips subscriber exclusive Tuesday, which was written by Tony Jones. We speak with producer Ian Atkins about this little gem.\n\nWe continue our adventures with the Eighth Doctor and his friend, journalist James Macfarlane, in BBC Audio's series of original adventures.\n\nToday, we look at The Teeth of Ice, which is the third outing in the series, which began with The Scent of Blood, and continued with The Code of Flesh. And, because it's the winter, it's apt that we join them in Antarctica!\n\nWe speak with range editor Michael Stevens and writer Andrew Lane about it!\n\nThere's so many Eighth Doctor Christmas stories to choose from.\n\nIt all began with The Chimes of Midnight in 2002, but since then, there's been so many others, in Big Finish Short Trips collections in print and on audio, in full cast adventures, and in BBC Christmas collections too.\n\nToday, we've asked YOU, our lovely listeners, to nominate your favourite festive frolics for Paul McGann's incarnation.\n\nWe've returned to the world of Eighth Doctor comics for our episode today.\n\nPieces of Eighth turns back the clock by a decade to mark the Doctor's appearance in a 50th anniversary story, and we're NOT talking Night of the Doctor.\n\nWe chat to writers Scott and David Tipton about Prisoners of Time, the IDW comics celebration of the show, and in particular, the eighth episode, The Body Politic. We also speak to artist Roger Langridge.\n\nChristmas is coming, and we're starting to feel very excited about it.\n\nToday, we take a look at one of the lesser-known Big Finish Short Trips, as we put The Caves of Erith - a subscriber-only exclusive - under the microscope.\n\nWe chat with producer Ian Atkins, and writer Alice Cavender, as we go batty for the festive season!\n\nBrrrrrr! It's winter, so we thought we'd tie in with the season and do a story set in the snow.\n\nSo, brace yourself, get your anti-gravity ski boots on, and prepare for some extreme wintersports on the Martian moon of Phobos.

Their voice might be familiar...\n\nWE'VE only gone and done it again - we've tracked down someone who worked on the TV Movie, and got an exclusive interview with them!\n\nThis week, we hear from Patrick Lussier, the man who edited the film, whilst working with director Geoffrey Sax.\n\nIt was a dream come true for Patrick, who was a Doctor Who fan long before being hired - and even now, he still listens to the Eighth Doctor with Big Finish.\n\nGet ready for chat about D3: The Mighty Ducks, working on the Scream films with Wes Craven (and his thoughts on the spoof, Scary Movie), as well as branching out and directing in his own right.\n\nJUST when you thought there was no more Eighth Doctor to novelise, he pops up in a Fourth Doctor book.\n\nStephen Gallagher recently wrote a new short story featuring Paul McGann's Doctor, which was included as part of his novelisation of Warriors' Gate.\n\nKenny and Matt chat their way through the story, which includes a brief reading from it, before hearing from editor Steve Cole and the writer himself.\n\nA fuller chat with Steve Gallagher appears in The Power of Three podcast, episode 128.\n\nPAUL McGann is back in costume!

And then in 2013 we found out, in The Night of the Doctor?\n\nLittle did we know that Russell T Davies had also plotted out the end of Paul McGann's incarnation, for a short story, which ultimately never saw the light of day until the Doctor Who: Adventures in Lockdown series, first published in the BBC website and later, in print.\n\nWe bring you a full reading of the story this week, complete with music and sound design, as well as Russell T Davies' introduction to the story brought to life by Big Finish's Narvin himself - Seán Carlsen!\n\nJoin Kenny and Matt for a discussion on the story, as they find a large number of similarities between Doctor Who and the Time War and The Night of the Doctor.\n\nWE MAKE a fast return to the world of Big Finish Short Trips this week, as we explore The Hall of the Ten Thousand.\n\nThe Ten Thousand represent everything the Doctor admires. Ingenuity, creativity and triumph of peace over war. So, naturally, he’s taken Charlotte Pollard to see them.\n\nKenny and Tinne take a look at this tale, featuring interviews with producer Alfie Shaw and writer Jaine Fenn. You can find out more about her work at www.patreon.com/jainefenn\n\nWHO WANTS to live forever?, asked Queen in their song.\n\nWe find out the answer to this question in Immortal Beloved, as the Eighth Doctor and Lucie encounter Zeus, Hera and a number of other gods.\n\nToday, Kenny and guest co-host Tinne Peeters chat about Lucie Miller's fourth episode, and have exclusive chats with writer Jonathan Clements, talking about the story for the first time on a podcast, and actor David Dobson, who played Tayden/Ares.\n\nWe've taken a while to enter Eighth Doctor comics territory again, having featured one in our second episode, and now we've featured two in one season!\n\nToday, we're taking a look at The Forgotten, a six-part comic series published in 2008/09 by IDW Comics, and featured the Eighth Doctor in one part.\n\nWe speak with writer Tony Lee, in another conversation recorded at Gallifrey in February.\n\nWE'RE BACK looking at a Big Finish Short Trip, but this time, it's a more recent one.\n\nKenny and guest co-host Matt Michael discuss Death Will Not Part Us, before producer/writer Alfie Shaw explains where the story ideas came from, and sound designer/composer Richard Fox reveals how it all came together in the editing stage.\n\nHAD YOU ever heard of Gef the Talking Mongoose before listening to The Dalby Spook? We hadn't!\n\nThis week, Kenny and guest co-host Dave Steel learn all about the mysterious Gef, a mongoose who apparently spoke, whilst living on the Isle of Man in the 1930s.\n\nWe're joined by co-author Stewart Pringle, actor Harry Myers, sound designer Benji Clifford and musician Jamie Robertson, to find out more. Was Gef real? We want to believe!\n\nThanks to Jana on Twitter (@JanaJa1) for permission to use her cover art for this story.\n\nSHADA - the incomplete Doctor Who story that's been completed so many times over the years.\n\nToday, we're taking a look at the version from 2003, when Big FInish went into studio to record the audio for the story, which was coupled with Lee Sullivan's art, and animated for the BBC website as part of the 40th anniversary celebrations.\n\nThis week we chat with producer Gary Russell, illustrator Lee Sullivan and musician Russell Stone, as we take a look at the adaptation of Douglas Adams's script.\n\nOur guest co-host this week is everyone's favourite Belgian, Tinne Peeters.\n\nWE HEAD into new territory for Pieces of Eighth with this week's episode, as we look at a Short Trip from one of Big Finish's early audio collections.\n\nWe chat with Simon Guerrier about Letting Go, which was commissioned by editor Xanna Eve Chown and appeared on the second volume of the Short Trips audios.\n\nIt was narrated by India Fisher, and Becca gets jealous (again) that Kenny spoke to someone for the podcast whilst in LA...\n\nDON'T CRY for me, Weeping Angels! The Doctor, Liv and Helen encounter those blinking assassins again, and it leads to a hugely emotional adventure.\n\nIt's our biggest episode yet this season, with a fantastic four guests, including writer Roy Gill, Albie himself, Mr Barnaby Jago, musician Jamie Robertson, and sound designer Benji Clifford.\n\nWe also have Song for Helen - get those hankies ready!\n\nONE OF the great crimes of the 90s, with regards from Doctor Who (aside from a lack of a TV series for the Eighth Doctor) was the fact that the show never got an annual that year.\n\nSomething of a British tradition, each Christmas, children are given a hardbacked book, containing comics and stories with their favourite characters from TV, film, toys, etc, as well as puzzles and games.\n\nBut now, 27 years after it should have been published, The Doctor Who Annual 1997 has arrived, from Terraqueous Distribution.\n\nWith Becca on maternity leave, Kenny's joined by his Power of 3 co-conspirator David Steel, and chat with editor Mark, as well as one of its many writers, Rob Nisbet.\n\nFind out more HERE.\n\nWHO doesn't like a good, in-depth interview?

And there's a Dalek in it too.\n\nWe speak with James, and also Nicholas Briggs, who narrated the story, as well as doing the music and sound design, for its release as an audio Short Trip.\n\nYou can find out more about James' work at https://jswallow.com/ and Museum Peace can be bought from the Big Finish website.\n\nIt's another one of Kenny's chats in person from Gallifrey, as we welcome back our old pals Matthew Jacobs and Vanessa Yuille.\n\nThey chat about the impact of their film, Doctor Who Am I?, and find out how Matthew now views his place in the Whoniverse.\n\nBecca's not jealous of the trip at all...\n\nWE'RE back into the territory of the original Lucie Miller adventures, to the delight of one of your co-hosts.\n\nWe have a chat with Paul Sutton, the writer of No More Lies, the sixth story in the first run of Lucie Miller adventures.\n\nIt's the first time Paul's chatted about the story, and he reveals how his research into Hungarian folk songs played a part in the tale.\n\nAhead of the launch of our sixth season, we're delighted to bring you some rare material, with these trailers for Invaders From Mars, as originally broadcast on Radio 7 in 2005.\n\nHere's four short teasers, to get listeners hooked - aren't they great?\n\nHAPPY NEW Year! Doctor Who's 60th anniversary year is upon us in 2023.\n\nAnd to kick off the celebrations, we asked our listeners to share with us their favourite Eighth Doctor stories, on TV, audio, books, comics, etc.\n\nThis episode is dedicated to the memory of our friend Si Hodges, who kindly provided us with images to use in several season three episodes, including the Beyond the Vortex episodes, and creating us a special piece of art for The People's Temple episode.\n\nMERRY CHRISTMAS! We didn't originally plan to do this episode, but the opportunity arose, to bring you some special presents on Christmas Day.\n\nFirstly, we've a present for you, dear listener. We've married up Gordon Tipple's original opening narration for the TV Movie, with the soundtrack, to hear how it may originally have sounded.\n\nSecondly, we've a present for Becca, as we're joined by a special Christmas Day guest!\n\nAnd finally, we've another present for you all, as we have a reading of the Short Trip Evergreen, which is performed by its original author.\n\nWe're DEFINITELY finished for this year now - this is our 70th episode of 2022!\n\n\"CHRISTMAS wouldn't be Christmas without my plum pudding!\"\n\nSo Mrs Baddeley tells us throughout The Chimes of Midnight, and now, for many Doctor Who / Big Finish fans, Christmas wouldn't be Christmas without The Chimes of Midnight.\n\nThis Christmas Eve, we're joined by our friends all over the world, as we celebrate the story regarded by many as the greatest Doctor Who audio story, if not the greatest Doctor Who story of all, in Robert Shearman's tale from 2002.\n\nIT'S CHRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIISTMAS! We're continuing our countdown to the festive season with the Eighth Doctor, as we take a look at one of his Christmas specials.\n\nWe're looking at Better Watch Out and Fairytale of Salzburg, from Ravenous 2, as the Krampus rises and nothing stands in its way as it looks to destroy the world... only once man can stop him, and it's not the man you were expecting...\n\nWriter John Dorney joins us for a natter, as does Robert Whitelock, who plays the Krampus and a host of other parts in this adventure. Benji Clifford tells us about how he sound designed the story, and composer Jamie Robertson talks us through his creative process, in a bumper episode.\n\nIT PROBABLY hasn't escaped your notice, but we're just three days away from Christmas, so it's time we got into the festive spirit.\n\nToday, we bring you a reading of a complete Christmas Short Trip, Decorative Purposes. It was the twenty-first short story in the Big Finish printed anthology Short Trips: The Ghosts of Christmas, published in 5 December 2007. It was written by Eddie Robson and featured the Eighth Doctor and Lucie Miller (Kenny's so excited!).\n\nAfter our reading, Eddie joins us for a chat, so sit back, get those chestnuts roasting on an open fire, and enjoy...\n\nTODAY we have our final Short Trip, as we look at The Queen of Eros from Short Trips and Sidesteps.\n\nWe bring you a full reading of the story, with sound design, followed by a chat with author Trevor Baxendale, and, of course, editor Steve Cole.\n\nAnd that it - the complete run of Sam and the Eighth Doctor on their own!\n\nWE MAY have finished our run of episodes looking at the Eighth Doctor and Sam's adventures in full novel form, but we're completists. There's still gaps.\n\nWe continue our look at the official BBC Short Trips, as we look at Femme Fatale, by Paul Magrs, as the Doctor and Sam encounter Andy Warhol and Iris Wildthyme.\n\nWe've a full reading of the story, by James Hadwen-Bennett, followed by chats with editor Steve Cole and Paul.\n\nWE'VE comprehensively covered the first 18 EDAs with the Doctor and Sam... but we don't want to stop there!\n\nThere's still a few stories featuring this pair to be covered, before Fitz arrives, so we're turning our eye to the world of Short Trips. We've previously covered Bounty, Dead Time and The People's Temple, and since we're completists, it would be wrong not to do their other adventures, published in the BBC Short Trips books.\n\nToday, we've got Steve Cole telling us about Model Train Set, as well as a chat with its author, Jonathan Blum.\n\nTHE FACE-EATER is the 18th and final novel in our run of episodes looking at the early Eighth Doctor Adventures, and his stories with Sam Jones.\n\nWe're joined, as ever, by range editor Steve Cole, and writer Simon Messingham talks us through his journey as a Doctor Who writer - and we find out which of his good friends became a 21st century TV series writer.\n\nIt's the end of our current run looking at the books, but is it the end of season five? Tune in and find out!\n\nIT WOULD be fair to say that Beltempest is a Doctor Who novel with a high-concept science fiction idea at its heart. There's no moustache-twirling villains, or bases under siege.\n\nNot only is Beltempest a story of note, but this is an episode with a difference - we don't have a 'live' interview with author Jim Mortimore, but he kindly agreed to record his answers to the questions, which we sent him, and we've created a full chat with him.\n\nAs ever, Steve Cole tells us about things from his side as the range editor too, for another engrossing chat."
