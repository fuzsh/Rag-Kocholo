        "text": "I have a Toshiba 65 inch TV with Dolby sound (65UK3C63DB) I recently bought the Poseidon D60 5.1 surround system. I have it connected with an optical cable. Sound is coming out of all speakers, however the TV won't let me select anything except stereo. Surely a fairly new TV can output more than just stereo. Honestly I am so frustrated. If I have spent all this money on a set up that doesn't work I will honestly cry! I don't work anymore because of illness and I can't afford to get a new TV. Surely it's just me being stupid and there is a simple fix.\n\nI look forward to any advice. Thank you.\n\nOnly 5.1 stuff will be on BBC and Channel 4 HD services...\n\nITV can't do surround and Channel 5 do it all wrong on satellite (they flag everything as 5.1 when it is absolutely not!) but never is 5.1 on terrestrial.\n\nFeature Films (aka 'movies'), some Nature programmes, some Sports and some major productions may be 5.1.\n\nDoctor Who used to be a good candidate for 5.1 but is just in stereo this series...\n\nLater With Jools Holland is in 5.1 and has been for some time.\n\nWimbledon might be (or not)?\n\nSome of the possible 5.1s I have checked and are only broadcast in stereo include:\n\nThe Responder and The Gathering,.\n\nI believe that the surround mixing costs more and is often paid for by the Commercial arm of the BBC for international Sales\n\nRegular over-the -air broadcast broadcasts don't have anything other than stereo content.\n\nWrong! Last night's Jools is in 5.1\n\nOnly 5.1 stuff will be on BBC and Channel 4 HD services...\n\nITV can't do surround and Channel 5 do it all wrong on satellite (they flag everything as 5.1 when it is absolutely not!) but never is 5.1 on terrestrial.\n\nFeature Films (aka 'movies'), some Nature programmes, some Sports and some major productions may be 5.1.\n\nDoctor Who used to be a good candidate for 5.1 but is just in stereo this series...\n\nLater With Jools Holland is in 5.1 and has been for some time.\n\nWimbledon might be (or not)?\n\nSome of the possible 5.1s I have checked and are only broadcast in stereo include:\n\nThe Responder and The Gathering,.\n\nI believe that the surround mixing costs more and is often paid for by the Commercial arm of the BBC for international Sales\n\nWrong! Last night's Jools is in 5.1\n\nI stand corrected. What format of 5.1 do the BBC and Chan 4 use for terrestrial transmission?\n\nI have done some YouTube tests and they seem to be still coming out the rear left and right. Even movies on netflix seem to have clearly left and right audio. However the TV doesn't let me check the settings when using my fire stick and only takes me back to the main fire stick settings menu. The menu on the TV when having my pc on still only says stereo. Apparently my pc graphics card won't let me choose surround as it only detects the TV as stereo. When selecting the Dolby pc setting there is no sound. I'm totally flummoxed.\n\nI stand corrected. What format of 5.1 do the BBC and Chan 4 use for terrestrial transmission?\n\nIt is transmitted as HE-AAC with the receiver decoding (mandatory in the Freeview HD/Play specs) to Dolby Digital (2.0 or 5.1) and allowing the Audio Description from the HE-AAC stream to be mixed in...\n\nI have never checked if only stereo or surround with AD mixed on Freeview. They are separate streams on satellite so always stereo on sat.\n\nThe number of BBC 5.1 broadcasts seems to be reducing in recent times... I've a pile of older programmes in 5.1 on my pvr that I've yet to watch: Ridley Road, Sherwood, Showtrial, The Capture, The Catch and Vienna Blood\n\nSherwood is in UHD on iPlayer (in stereo) so I may watch that version anyway (if/when that happens).\n\n@freesatnut\n\nNB The Poseidon D60 really ought to be connected via hdmi to the hdmi2 ARC connection of the TV to take full advantage of the unit... the TV remote should then, via CEC, control the surround unit volume.\n\nBeing ARC only on the TV it will be the same audio as the optical, of course. But it may allow selection of bitsream out from TV on HD TV channel and/or on a per input basis of the apps.\n\nFire TV stick may need setting of bitstream out (or DD out, or any of the other less common labels for non-PCM stereo). I can't remember.\n\nAIUI YouTube is often only stereo even when things are labelled otherwise?? (Stands to be corrected)... BUT the BBC HD Test Card had 5.1 test signals see and has a file available to download...\n\nI am unsure about HE-AAC. I'm a little teccy but not much. I have never seen that option though anywhere I don't think.\n\nDon't worry about it.\n\nIt's merely how the audio is encoded by the BBC HD multiplex for transmission in an efficient way... It is automatically decoded within the TV to Dolby Digital.\n\nYou won't find it mentioned in any TV menus.\n\nYou are looking for options on the hdmi/optical sound out format (when watching a HD TV channel) - auto might work, bitstream also, or Dolby or DD... anything other than stereo or PCM.\n\nOk. I understand, basically if it is Dolby 5.1 it will play Dolby 5.1. If it's just encoded Stereo it will play stereo. I have just got myself worked up a bit I think. Very interesting that YouTube videos aren't 5.1 encoded. I read elsewhere that if you pay premium YouTube you get it.\n\nThe industry default specs for uncompressed audio transmission means S/PDIF doesn't have the bandwidth for surround. It'll only work with a lossy compression like Dolby Digital.\n\nUnfortunately they never settled on a standard or open compression and licencing dolby's encoders for real time use on computers etc. was never very popular (I'd guess they are fairly pricey) so it's mostly just used for pre-recorded sound tracks.\n\nHDMI should have rectified it when they introduced ARC but they set up pretty much the same situation. I believe it should finally be sorted with the introduction of eARC more recently.\n\nI'm playing around with it. I tried ARC My TV even has eArc. My pc is plugged into my TV so all the sound goes through it. I have a 3060ti graphics card fully capable of 5.1. Only shows stereo. Apparently this meant the PC detects the TV as only stereo. I have watched 5.1 movies on netflix. Still doesn't seem to sound right. I even synced it to my TV via Bluetooth. Still nada. I have reverted back to optical because I don't have enough HDMI ports.\n\nIs it the TV?\n\nI really can't get my head around the TV not showing any options for surround.\n\nI can't help thinking I am doing something REALLY wrong.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the speakers sound great for the price point... The stereo is great!\n\nBeginning to think I should have just got a decent 2.1 sound bar.\n\nAttachments\n\nPXL_20240527_090807766.jpg\n\nPXL_20240527_090816351.jpg\n\nYou Tube sound may well depend on \"the platform\" i.e. the player implementation in the device(s) used.\n\nHow did that work? If not that then the downloaded on a USB stick via the TV's media player ?\n\nIf the TV really has eARC it should be used in combination with that soundbar / surround... as eARC can pass higher res sound from other hdmi ports and internal apps...\n\nCheck setting on a per hdmi input basis ...\n\nPC is likely trying to send multichannel PCM which eARC might be capable of but the TV not able to pass through due to the way it's implemented by Vestel/Toshiba on a cheap end set? Check if there is an option for sending bitstream??\n\nBack in the day it was common that TVs didn't pass DD bitstream from hdmi inputs to the ARC/optical port... just stereo.\n\nGet a hdmi switch if three is inadequate for the sources you use? Or a proper AVR with multiple hdmi inputs and a set of wired speakers.\n\nInstruction manual for Toshiba 65 Inch 65UK3163DB Smart 4K UHD HDR LED Freeview TV (Argos Product 950/8527) has the user manual....\n\neARC needs enabling in the Sound menu page 22\n\nDigital Out should be passthrough page 23\n\nThank you. I have tried these options too. I have emailed TOSHIBA. It is an older model I guess. I got it on sale, still pricy though. One of the reasons I actually went with it was because it advertised as Dolby.\n\nI await their reply. Thank you again for the manual.\n\nI know this sounds stupid, but this is enough to drive me over the edge. I havent been doing well with my mental health, this was supposed to be a treat. First world problems, I know.\n\nThose pics show setting is optical spdif out and set to stereo and pcm out.\n\nIt needs to be surround and auto/passthrough to stand any chance of surround to the amplifier/speakers.\n\nTV 'Dolby' will refer to it's built in speaker system with Atmos and also the Dolby Vision for UHD sources it has.\n\nThe review I've read is the built in sound is not the best, nor the pictures, but you can be the judge of that. That review from April 2022 gave the (list?) price as £499 which is not a lot for such a big screen.\n\nYou need to find sources that are 100% surround sound encoded to test the system and connections. Download some demo samples for the TV media player to use? That BBC clip I linked to identifies each speaker in turn --- so that should be a useful start.\n\nNB not all 5.1 programmes are especially 'dramatic' in effects, and are often quite subtle.\n\nTransmitted surround content still seems to be a bit of a compromise and nothing like discrete and totally independent sources of each channel that purists might prefer. I guess we have not moved very far from the QS/SQ analogue \"Quadraphonic\" disks of the 1970's. Even digital systems, it seems, have their limitations when asked to carry multi-channels.\n\nRowlocks. They are six discrete digital channels (one being the LFE channel). Zero cross-talk and totally independent of each other.\n\nThe sound mixer(s) and directors do what they desire with the sounds to produce the effects they wish.\n\nAll I was trying to say to the OP is that they should not expect ping pong stereo or whizzy around the head surround effects from all programmes that have 5.1 sound.\n\nWith Dolby Atmos they now place sound objects in space and height locations by using the receivers to process additional metadata within the audio stream.\n\nThose pics show setting is optical spdif out and set to stereo and pcm out.\n\nIt needs to be surround and auto/passthrough to stand any chance of surround to the amplifier/speakers.\n\nTV 'Dolby' will refer to it's built in speaker system with Atmos and also the Dolby Vision for UHD sources it has.\n\nThe review I've read is the built in sound is not the best, nor the pictures, but you can be the judge of that.

I guess the TV was cheap for a reason. I'll just cope. Thank you guys for all the information. There was a lot I simply did not know. They can do a lot with great stereo these days anyway. I'll enjoy them the best I can until my TV finally goes. I better start saving now.\n\nMy TV even has eArc.\n\nBoth devices need support for it to work, but if your TV has it then it might be worth returning and replacing the sound system with one that does - although I don't know how common support is yet.\n\nThe issue with S/PDIF & ARC is that you need a Dolby Digital or DTS compressed audio for surround to work, and it's rare for the the OS, Graphics card drivers or TV to have the software to convert to that format.\n\nYou don't say what you're using to watch Netflix but even if the stream is in dolby digital the browser will be uncompressing it so it can manipulate the audio - mix in notifications from the other open tabs and so on.\n\nA program can request exclusive control of an audio output so some media player programs can send out the original compressed data when playing back files, although as nothing else can use it that means all system sounds and other programs are muted. This is called bitstreaming.\n\nI'm not aware of any browsers that do it though, and I don't know about the netflix app (on the Microsoft store).\n\nAnd of course for stuff that isn't in that format to begin with like game audio it doesn't help.\n\nThe other option is trying to find software that'll convert, probably on the computer as that's going to be most open to that sort of system level add-ons. IIRC Windows calls add-ons for that sort of system-wide audio manipulation Audio Processing Objects (APOs), I don't know about Linux and Mac OS.\n\nI'm using a fire stick for Netflix. It's weird because it doesn't let me access the TV settings when using it, however the Dolby logo does pop up in the bottom right corner. I downloaded the Dolby add on for PC and it let me pick what speakers to use. Although the sound options only give me L and R options.\n\nI am presuming the fire stick bypasses the menu system on the TV and possibly gives me audio. TV is Dolby and the speakers are Dolby certified. So it must be doing 'something' I will play around with more drivers for my PC. Such a shame the speakers don't have the HDMI TO HDMI pass through. That would make things much easier and I wouldn't have to bother with all the TV settings. I do love the speakers filling the room though. And my friend said he could really hear the surroundyness of them... Maybe he is right and I'm just way too picky.\n\nThe soundbar/system ULTIMEA Poseidon D60 | 5.1 Dolby Atmos Surround Soundbar has eARC as the TV does according to the OP....\n\nIssue seems to be mainly that the OP either can't figure out how to set Digital Out to be anything other than PCM or when done it doesn't work??? (see post #15)\n\nSome kit needs a mains power reboot on both TV and sound system once some changes are made... So that may be worth another try using eARC... worry about adding back the 4th hdmi source later if it can be got working?\n\nA factory reset of the TV may be worth a try, as well with the sound system connected via eARC?\n\nThe user manual and maker website is very unclear about what formats it decodes (other than it don't do DTS)....\n\nI suspect an alternative sound system may be the only correct answer.\n\nThe soundbar/system ULTIMEA Poseidon D60 | 5.1 Dolby Atmos Surround Soundbar has eARC as the TV does according to the OP....\n\nIssue seems to be mainly that the OP either can't figure out how to set Digital Out to be anything other than PCM or when done it doesn't work???

It says nothing about eARC. But Dolby Atmos is mentioned. So I would expect Dolby to be able to be passed through to the ARC port. But I'm not sure if it would be possible from the optical out.\n\nI suggest plugging the sound system into the ARC port and setting that to get Dolby sound."
