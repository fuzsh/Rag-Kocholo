        "text": "Well what do you expect? If the 5.1 sound track isn't there, it cannot be magically created.\n\nAnd most broadcasters don't upscale to ProLogic II, they keep it at standard 2.0 Stereo as it sounds better than ProLogic II.\n\nI think you're expecting way too much to be honest.\n\nYes, id love there to be a higher level of 5.1 use on UK tv, but untill broadcasters begin put 5.1 on all production delivery standard requirements lists, it will not change.\n\nCurrently, only Sky have 5.1 as a delivery requirement for commissioned productions.\n\nChannel 4 are moving toward that.\n\nBBC, well, frankly, they are a joke when it comes to 5.1 use.\n\nIts not going to change as fast as you want.\n\n2.0 is just sq encoding. Same as Dolby Stereo, but with no analogue noise reduction, and the 7khz band limiting of the 2 rear channels removed (both not needed with digital codecs).\n\nThere is no such thing as Dolby Pro-Logic encoding. Only decoding.\n\nThe cinema surround effect depends very much on The Haas Effect. This doesnt really work in a small living room, which is why the 5.1 version (\"surround stereo\") sounds significantly better !\n\n2.0 IS surround sound !\n\nEffectively, what Dolby Labs now call \"pro logic\". In fact, just the sq system.\n\ndolby surround = dolby stereo, same thing, see my post above.\n\nWhere uk tv programs were originally made in stereo, there will always be some ambient surround, even if a matrixing technique is not \"officially\" being used ........\n\nA bit of background:\n\nWhen a Dolby Stereo/Dolby Surround soundtrack is produced, five elements of audio information (left, center, right, sub and surround) are matrix-encoded into only two channels. The surround information is carried on stereo sources such as VHS TV, DVDs, 35mm theatrical print optical soundtracks, or television broadcasts from which it can be decoded by a processor to recreate the original Dolby Surround (left, center, right, sub and surround) mix. Without the decoder, the information still plays in standard stereo or mono.\n\nAs the technology of a Dolby Surround decoder is virtually the same as decoding the monaural surround soundtrack, many Dolby Stereo encoded films could be transferred with little change to the stereo soundtrack, lowering the costs of re-recording the audio of a film to video. In fact, most left/right/surround Dolby Surround decoders included a modified Dolby B decoder as part of their design.\n\nThe Dolby Surround decoding technology was updated during the mid-1980s and renamed Dolby Pro Logic in 1987. The terms Dolby Stereo, Dolby Surround and LtRt are used to describe soundtracks that are matrix-encoded using this technique.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_Surround\n\nProper Dolby Surround material has no centre channel info. Which is why Pro Logic came about:\n\nDolby Pro Logic\n\nDolby Surround/Pro Logic is based on basic matrix technology. When a Dolby Surround soundtrack is created, four channels of sound are matrix-encoded into an ordinary stereo (two channel) sound track. The centre channel is encoded by placing it equally in the left and right channels; the rear channel is encoded using phase shift techniques, typically an out of phase stereo mixdown. A Pro Logic decoder/processor \"unfolds\" the sound into the original 4.0 surround—left and right, center, and a single limited frequency-range (7 kHz low-pass filtered[1]) mono rear channel—while systems lacking the decoder play back the audio as standard stereo.\n\nA Pro-Logic decoder also uses 'Steering Logic', which drives amplifiers, to raise or lower the output volume of each channel based on the current dominant sound direction. For example, while a mono signal is played, the strong correlation to the center channel triggers the output volume of the left, right and surround channels to be lowered. This increases the channel separation achievable, to around 30 decibels between channels.\n\nPro Logic has the specific surround info purposely matrixed (phase-shifted) with the main stereo channels. Stereo material with ambient sound might also reproduce OK(ish) through a DPL decoder as that ambient info might have elements of phase-shift.\n\nDolby Pro Logic II was an advancement:\n\nIn 2000, Dolby introduced Dolby Pro Logic II (DPL II), an improved implementation of Dolby Pro Logic created by Jim Fosgate. DPL II processes any high quality stereo signal source into five separate full frequency channels (right front, center, left front, right rear and left rear). Dolby Pro Logic II also decodes 5 channels from stereo signals encoded in traditional four-channel Dolby Surround. DPL II implements greatly enhanced steering compared to DPL, and as a result, offers an exceptionally stable sound field that simulates 5 channel surround sound.\n\nBecause of the limited nature of the original DPL, many consumer electronics manufacturers introduced their own processing circuitry, such as the \"Jazz\", \"Hall\", and \"Stadium\" modes found on most common home audio receivers. DPL II forgoes this type of processing and replaces it with simple servo (negative feedback) circuits used to derive five channels. The extra channel content is extracted using the difference between the spatial audio content between two individual channels of stereo tracks or Dolby Digital encoded 5.1 channel tracks and outputs it appropriately. In addition to five full range playback channels, Pro Logic II introduced a Music mode which includes optimized channel delays, and adds user controls to—for example—adjust apparent front sound stage width.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Logic_II#Dolby_Pro_Logic_II\n\nYou will find that DD 2.0 is simply a stereo track, L+R channels which might or might not have surround info specifically encoded (via dolby surround) or ambient info (not specifically encoded). This is why many AV decoders will provide modes to process a DD 2.0 signal as vanilla DD2.0, DD 2.0 + ProLogic, DD2.0 +ProLogic II, and DTS Neo:6 (the DTS equivalent of DPL II).\n\nDolby Digital 5.1, DD 7.1 etc have 6, 8 etc discrete channels. DD itself is a lossy format, only DD TrueHD is lossless (giving the highest audio quality).\n\nAs an aside, Dolby Stereo is normally a term referring to analogue (matrixed) stereo cinema film soundtracks.\n\nMy interest in surround sound goes back a long way. This was my first proper surround sound processor/preamp:\n\nhttp://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=14&ved=0CEkQFjADOAo&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.quadraphonic.info%2Fmanuals%2FAVP2om.pdf&ei=8XtVUqLFB9el4AOT7YCgCg&usg=AFQjCNEteo6-w8psVCRNbu84wksNTSwLeA&sig2=ZEAUPJRUzL0St-CBqS3_Iw&bvm=bv.53760139,d.dmg&cad=rja"
