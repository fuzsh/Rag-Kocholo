        "text": "Note: We are keeping this article updated as things progress with the launch\n\nLast Updated: July 7, 2024\n\nFor almost 30 years, A/V hobbyists and audiophiles have been debating whether Dolby or DTS is the better surround sound format. While DTS surround sound formats made a strong showing on DVD and Blu-ray Disc, streaming services have been dominated by Dolby. Virtually all of the major streaming platforms support Dolby Digital, Dolby Digital+ and Dolby Atmos immersive surround. But only one fairly obscure streaming service supports DTS sound in North America (Sony Pictures Core). That changed on May 15, 2024 as Disney+ expanded their IMAX Enhanced content support to stream immersive surround sound using the DTS:X codec. We’ve got the full details for you and tips on how you can get it to work in your home theater or living room\n\nIMAX Enhanced – What Is It?\n\nWhen IMAX first announced their IMAX Enhanced certification program for hardware and content, the company talked about using the DTS:X codec to deliver optimized immersive surround mixes derived from the original theatrical IMAX mixes. And over time a few IMAX Enhanced movie titles have been released on Ultra HD Blu-ray Disc with DTS:X sound. But trying to find DTS:X soundtracks on streaming services has been a bit trickier.\n\nWhile Disney+ released around 20 films from the Marvel Cinematic Universe in IMAX Enhanced format on the streaming service, the only immersive sound option available on these titles when launched was Dolby Atmos. The only streaming service that did offer IMAX Enhanced content with DTS:X surround sound previously was Sony’s BRAVIA Core (now renamed to “Sony Pictures Core”). That streaming service is exclusive to Sony TVs and to the latest PlayStation PS5 gaming console. But only a single Sony TV (the top of the line A95L QD-OLED TV) was capable of delivering movies with DTS:X surround from Sony Pictures Core in 2023. On May 15th, Disney+ joimed the DTS:X party by offering 18 of the IMAX Enhanced Marvel films in DTS:X surround as well as a brand new IMAX enhanced version of the live concert film, “Queen Rock Montreal.”\n\nAt launch on May 15th, DTS:X sound was made available on the following titles in Disney+:\n\nAnt-Man and the Wasp\n\nAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania\n\nAvengers: Endgame\n\nAvengers: Infinity War\n\nBlack Panther\n\nBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever\n\nBlack Widow\n\nCaptain America: Civil War\n\nCaptain Marvel\n\nDoctor Strange\n\nDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness\n\nEternals\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy (Vol. 2)\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy (Vol. 3)\n\nThe Marvels\n\nQueen Rock Montreal\n\nShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\n\nThor: Love & Thunder\n\nThor: Ragnarok\n\nWhile Disney+ hasn’t added the ability to search titles for “IMAX Enhanced” or “DTS:X” yet, you can easily access the Marvel IMAX Enhanced titles by loading the Disney+ app, selecting the “Marvel” channel and then scrolling down to the category “IMAX Enhanced.”\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nIMAX has established its reputation as a premium movie-going experience by providing impactful visuals (with larger screens, high dynamic range and taller aspect ratios) and with the signature IMAX 12-channel immersive surround mix with its deep ground-shaking bass. The IMAX Enhanced program is designed to replicate that experience at home. Now with the addition of DTS:X surround, the home audio mix will be a closer match to that cinematic IMAX sound mix. If you’re a fan of IMAX theaters and IMAX movies, this should be the best way to replicate that experience at home with the convenience of streaming.\n\nA rep from Xperi (DTS parent company) explained it this way: “IMAX Enhanced sound by DTS is a different creative output from other formats. We’re encoding basically the theatrical IMAX mix which is specifically created for IMAX theatres with only minor adjustment for a home environment but by preserving the full dynamic range of the mix with that IMAX signature bass. This is a premium format for people who care about a theatre-like experience at home. Not necessarily for watching movies late at night on TV speakers when kids are sleeping next door.”\n\nTo that, I say, “Sign me up!”\n\nThe DTS rep further explained that the 12-channel IMAX mix is converted to a 10-channel (5.1.4) DTS:X mix for home. For those with a 7.1.4-channel home theater system, the side surrounds will not be active (surround is sent to the rear channels). Users can override this behavior by disabling IMAX Enhanced listening mode on their receiver, preamp/processor or soundbar.\n\nAdvertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\nWhat Do You Need to Get Your DTS:X On?\n\nIn order to enjoy this new option of DTS:X sound in IMAX Enhanced content, you’ll need an IMAX Enhanced certified source component capable of delivering both the 4K/HDR video and DTS:X audio streams of these films, or at least a source capable of decoding the new “DTS:X for streaming” (DTS:X Profile 2) audio stream and sending a compatible version of that DTS:X stream to a DTS:X-capable soundbar or receiver. This source can be a compatible TV with the Disney+ app installed or it could be a standalone streaming box with IMAX Enhanced certification or at least DTS:X decoding compatibility. You’ll also need an audio system capable of decoding and playing back that DTS:X stream. This could be a soundbar, preamp/processor or an A/V receiver with IMAX Enhanced certification and DTS:X decoding or it could be an older soundbar or receiver with DTS:X decoding built in.\n\nDTS elaborates on device compatibility as follows: “All DTS:X enabled TVs running Android TV (or Google TV) with the latest Disney+ app will be supported on May 15th. We have devices from Sony (e.g. Sony BRAVIA A95L QD-OLED from 2023, and BRAVIA 7, BRAVIA 8 and BRAVIA 9 models from 2024), Hisense (U6K/U7K/U8K series and others) and TCL in North America, Philips, Sharp and Xiaomi displays in Europe and Asia. Other platforms and devices will be supported later this year.” So on launch day (May 15th), only a few IMAX Enhanced certified Android TV or Google TV-based TVs were supported, but other streaming sources should be added in the near future.\n\nUpdate (7/7/24) – testing this on TCL’s new QM8 (QM851G) TV, we have found that the DTS:X option is not available yet. We’ve confirmed with TCL that a fix is in the works and will be delivered via an OTA (over the air) update.\n\nCheck out our interview with Sven Mevissen from DTS for the details on IMAX Enhanced and DTS:X sound on Disney+:\n\nWhen I reached out to LG, they said their TVs don’t currently support IMAX Enhanced or DTS:X decoding directly, however select LG TVs can deliver DTS:X soundtracks to a compatible LG soundbar. Specifically the “QNED85 and above” TVs can support DTS:X and IMAX Enhanced content when used with compatible LG Soundbars. This includes all of the company’s 2024 OLED and OLED evo TVs, as well as the QNED85, QNED90 and QNED99 LED/LCD models. I confirmed with DTS that LG TVs (which use the WebOS operating system and streaming platform) would not be supported at launch but support will be added for DTS:X audio streams from Disney+ on the WebOS platform at some point in the future.\n\nMy personal feeling is that third party streaming devices such as those from Amazon (FireTV Stick) and Roku are unlikely to support the DTS:X audio stream at launch (update: confirmed to be true). An Amazon rep confirmed as much to me, stating that Amazon FireTV devices do not currently support DTS. But the NVIDIA Shield TV and Shield Pro may be able to play this content properly, as long as the Shield has the necessary version of the Disney+ app. NVIDIA Shield is already compatible with IMAX Enhanced content (on the video side) and includes legacy DTS passthrough capability. However, before launch, a DTS rep told me the NVIDIA Shield does not decode DTS:X for streaming, so it would not be supported at launch. Apple TV is unlikely to work as it does not currently include any DTS format support. (update: confirmed to be true – AppleTV does not work for DTS:X content on Disney+).\n\nA rep from Roku told us that their streaming devices (including Roku TVs) support DTS and DTS:X, but are not specifically IMAX Enhanced certified. So these may work for DTS:X passthrough at some point if the Disney+ app on Roku enables the DTS:X stream on these devices. If we get any additional details on compatible device support, before or after the May 15 launch, we’ll be sure to update this article. And you know we’ll be testing our own devices on May 15th to see which ones work.\n\nUPDATE (May 15th): Can confirm that the latest FireTV Stick 4K Max and Roku Streaming Stick 4K+ as well as AppleTV 4K do not support this new DTS:X stream on Disney+ nor does the XBox Series X. Microsoft is an Xperi partner so it’s likely that the XBox Series X will get an updated version of the Disney+ that will support DTS:X Profile 2 at some point in the future.\n\nWhere the Magic Happens: DTS:X Decoding in the Receiver or Soundbar\n\nOnce the source streaming device gets that DTS:X soundtrack from Disney+, you’ll still need a way of decoding that sweet IMAX goodness into the 5.1.4-channel immersive surround mix for your ears to hear. That means you need a soundbar, preamp/processor or A/V receiver that can decode DTS:X.\n\nAs far as A/V receivers go, there are several IMAX Enhanced certified choices available from companies such as Denon, Marantz, Onkyo, Pioneer and Sony. Select home theater processors from Anthem, Arcam, McIntosh, Storm Audio, Trinnov and JBL are also IMAX Enhanced certified with full DTS:X decoding. In fact, all IMAX Enhanced certified receivers support DTS:X decoding. Check with your manufacturer or your user manual to see if your receiver or pre/pro is IMAX Enhanced certified. Also, older DTS:X-capable receivers will work to decode the DTS:X stream if paired with a TV or streaming source component that can decode the new “DTS:X for Streaming” codec.\n\nFor Soundbars, LG offers a few that are IMAX Enhanced certified from 2023 and 2024 including the SC9S and the flagship S95TR 9.1.5-channel soundbar system. Per LG, as far as 2024 models, the S70TY soundbar and above all support DTS:X decoding. Sony’s new BRAVIA Theater Bar 8 and BRAVIA Theater Bar 9 are also IMAX Enhanced certified as is the new BRAVIA Theatre Quad speaker system, if paired with one of Sony’s wireless subwoofers (the SA-SW3 or SA-SW5). Although the 2023 Sony Soundbars (HTA-5000 and HTA-7000) are not technically IMAX Enhanced certified, they do offer DTS:X decoding so these should also work when paired with a compatible Sony TV.\n\nIn fact, really any soundbar that supports DTS:X decoding should work for this. The hard work is done by the source device in converting (or “transcoding”) that new DTS:X Profile 2 soundtrack to a format that older gear supports.\n\nAdvertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\nIt’s important to note that even if your streaming device support DTS:X for Streaming, you may not be able to select the DTS:X stream in the Disney+ app if you connect it to a TV, projector or receiver that lacks DTS support. These devices talk to each other over HDMI in order to identify their capabilities. So if your streaming stick says, “Hey! I can handle DTS:X.” but your TV says, “Hell, No!” then NO DTS FOR YOU! As of the launch date (May 15) this isn’t an issue yet, as the TV is the streaming device. But this may become an issue later once more streaming devices are available.\n\nThe workaround for this would be to connect your streaming device directly to a DTS:X compatible receiver or soundbar, then connect that to the TV for the video signal. Of course, this doesn’t matter when the streaming app is built into an IMAX Enhanced certified TV (like the Sony A95L QD-OLED, for example), but even then you need to make sure you plug that TV into a compatible receiver or soundbar using an HDMI cable if you want to enjoy that sweet DTS:X immersive sound.\n\nWhat’s the Frequency, er… Bandwith, Kenneth?\n\nAs Disney+ is a traditional streaming service, network bandwidth is always a concern. For this reason, DTS:X on Disney+ is delivered via a lossy compression option which our friend at DTS claims is “technically lossy but perceptually lossless.” The rep also told me that the recommended and “typical” streaming bandwidth for the DTS:X audio track over streaming services is 448 kbps (kilobits per second). This is actually lower than the streaming bandwidth used by the older DTS Surround codec on DVDs (768 kbps and 1.5 Mbps). Fortunately advances in codec technology over the past three decades allow the latest, most efficient version of the DTS codec, called “DTS:X for Streaming” or “DTS:X Profile 2” to do more with less. The proof is in the pudding, as they say, so we’re looking forward to checking it out ourselves to see how it sounds.\n\nPer DTS, the DTS:X for Streaming codec for IMAX Enhanced takes the original 12 channel IMAX mix from theaters and converts that into a 10-channel mix for home. The mix is fixed at 5.1.4 channels – five surround, four height and one LFE channel. If played back on an IMAX Enhanced receiver which is configured for 7.1.4 channels, the side surround speakers will be inactive, with all surround channel duties being handled by the rear speakers. If you want to over-ride this behavior, you will need to set the receiver or soundbar to a non-IMAX sound mode.\n\nHow Do I know if My Gear Supports IMAX Enhanced with DTS:X Sound?\n\nOther than the specific components identified as being compatible with DTS:X sound on IMAX Enhanced content, it’s difficult to say exactly what components will work to deliver DTS:X sound from IMAX Enhanced content on Disney+ on May 15th. However, DTS reps tell us that, once the feature is enabled in Disney+, compatible gear will effectively identify itself to the user. Sven Mevissen from Xperi (DTS parent company) explains:\n\n“Disney+ users with a compatible device will get a notification in the form of an audio control panel that will appear when selecting an IMAX Enhanced film for the first time, letting them turn on IMAX Enhanced sound if they choose to. Once opted in, every title available with IMAX Enhanced sound will play with IMAX Enhanced sound moving forward.”\n\nUpdate (May 15) – I’ve now confirmed that DTS:X with IMAX Enhanced content on Disney+ works with the Sony BRAVIA 7 MiniLED TV connected to a Denon AVR-X3800H receiver or to a Sony BRAVIA Thatre Quad speaker system. Listening to the “Queen Rock Montreal” concert movie and “Guardians of the Galaxy, Volume 3” I noticed immediately how much more dynamic the soundtrack was on the DTS:X track. Also, bass extension is firm and extended lending more impact to the experience. As far as IMAX aspect ratio, I did notice that the “Versions” option to select between IMAX and traditional CinemaScope or Widescreen aspect ratios on Disney+ does not seem to be working on two of the titles (“Queen Rock Montreal” and “Guardians of the Galaxy, Part 3”). No matter what I select, I’m getting the IMAX Aspect ratio for those two titles. But I expect this is something Disney+ will fix once they figure out it’s broken.\n\nNow that the feature is available, Disney+ users can load the service and search for “Queen Rock Montreal.” If you play this title and see a pop-up window asking you to enable DTS:X then you should be good to go. If you don’t then your streaming device probably is not supported yet.\n\nOn a compatible streaming device, at any point, while watching one of the DTS:X titles, you can hit the down button on your streamer remote to see an audio options setup icon – this is where you can toggle DTS:X sound on or off.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nSo there you have it. Disney+ has become the first mainstream streaming service to deliver on the IMAX Enhanced promise with 4K/HDR visuals, IMAX Aspect Ratios and a DTS:X immersive sound mix derived from the original 12-channel IMAX soundtrack. It will be interesting to see what people think when they experience this at home. Our first impressions have been positive with noticeably expanded dynamic range and solid bass extension on the DTS:X soundtracks. The initial roll-out of the feature on May 15, 2024 has been fairly limited as it only includes DTS:X compatible TVs built on the AndroidTV or GoogleTV platform. DTS says they will expand support to other devices over time.\n\nWhat do you folks think about IMAX Enhanced content on Disney+ with DTS:X immersive sound? Big news or much ado about very little? As always, let us know in the comments.\n\nUpdates:\n\nAdvertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n4/27/24 – added note about Disney+ audio panel to confirm DTS:X sound\n\n4/29/24 – added details about LG TV and soundbar compatibility\n\n5/8/24 – added stronger wording – only select DTS-X compatible TVs on the AndroidTV or GoogleTV platforms will work on launch day (May 15th)\n\n5/13/24 – confirmed with DTS that TCL’s Google TVs with IMAX Enhanced certfication and DTS:X decoding will support the new DTS:X streams on May 15. Also, added details about IMAX 12-channel track being converted to a 5.1.4-channel DTS:X mix for home.\n\n5/15/24 – confirmed that AppleTV 4K, FireTV Sticks and Roku sticks do not support the new DTS:X streams on Disney+\n\n5/18/24 – Tested and confirmed that Sony BRAVIA 7 TV works on Disney+ for DTS:X streaming. Added some details of what to look for when testing as well as an easy way to scroll through the MCU “IMAX Enhanced” titles available on Disney+\n\n5/24/24 – We had lost DTS:X on the BRAVIA 7 TV temporarily after adjusting some audio settings on the TV. I believe the important setting in the “Picture and Sound” menu on the Sony TV is “Prioritize HDMI Signal Information.” This needed to be “On” in order to get DTS:X sound. Also added more specifics about compatible Hisense models (U6K, U7K, U8K). Earlier Hisense models may not be supported.\n\n7/7/24 – we’ve tested Disney+ on TCL’s new QM8 (QM851G) TV and found that the DTS:X option is not available yet. We’ve confirmed with TCL that a fix is in the works and will be delivered via an OTA (over the air) update.\n\nRelated Reading:"
