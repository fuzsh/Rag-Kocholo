SD is probably capable too, but I suspect it just Isn't Done (although see below).\n\nI don't put my surround amp on for much on telly, so apart from films (anything fairly recent or well-known will be in \"5.1\" on BBC One/Two HD and Channel 4 HD - not sure about ITV HD as I don't have it, but I suspect not) the only thing I'm certain of that is broadcast in 5.1 on UK telly is Doctor Who - but the title music is only stereo, which makes for a very weird transition from the 5.1 cold open, into the stereo titles, then into the 5.1 main episode.\n\nOh, now I think of it, Wimbledon is shown in 5.1 - or certainly was a couple of years ago, at least. And I think the bigger natural history series (Blue Planet and the like) are as well.\n\nThat said, a search on Digiguide for 5.1 suggests that all manner or programmes are in 5.1, even on the SD channels. The Proms, Zingzillas on CBeebies, Wizards v Aliens, Family Guy, Hidden Kingdoms, Match of the Day...\n\nLast edited by davidhorman on 16 August 2015 1:29am\n\nPermalink\n\nNG\n\nnoggin Founding member 16 August 2015 9:19am\n\nMost BBC shows are still made in stereo, and delivered for playout with a stereo 2.0 mix. These are broadcast in Dolby 2.0 on HD channels on DSat, and AAC 2.0 on HD channels on Freeview. They are broadcast in MP2 2.0 on SD outlets.\n\nSome shows, Strictly, Eurovision, Doctor Who, Proms, Wimbledon, Olympics, major Football etc. are mixed in 5.1 (or 5.0 or 4.0).\n\nThese will usually be sent with a stereo mix AND either discrete 5.1 mix OR a Dolby E encoded 5.1 signal. This is where it gets complicated...\n\nThe stereo mix (which may be derived from the 5.1 mix on-site or in the dub) will - I think - be used for the SD outlets MP2 audio. (It may be that it is now derived and down mixed by Red Bee from the 5.1 signal - but I don't think that is the case at the moment)\n\nThe 5.1 Dolby E or discrete mix will be used for the HD channels and broadcast in Dolby Digital 5.1 on DSat HD, and AAC 5.1 on Freeview HD.\n\nIf you are watching an HD channel in stereo, and it is showing a 5.1 (or 5.0/4.0) show, then the receiver or TV will have to do a 5.1->2.0 down mix. To do this it should use the metadata (which is additional information added by the broadcaster to tell receivers more about the audio content in the 5.1 signal). This metadata needs to be correct AND the receiver doing the down mix needs to do it properly.\n\nThe metadata famously went wrong catastrophically on the 2008 BBC Eurovision song contest, where the 5.1 mix was flagged as 1.0 centre only, so viewers at home only heard the centre channel (even when listening in 5.1 properly). The mix that year put live vocals only in the centre, with the backing tracks on the front left and right. So viewers on BBC HD only heard vocals. It was like reverse Karaoke. In those days they couldn't switch to a stereo audio feed, so had to take BBC One's SD feed (with stereo) and up convert...\n\nIf a production delivers with the wrong metadata, or the dubbing mixer mixes to one metadata standard, but different metadata is supplied, OR the down mixed stereo audio isn't monitored properly during production (so that they know what it will sound like at home) then problems can occur.\n\nIt is often very easy to hear huge differences between the stereo mixes on the SD channel and the stereo down mix made in your TV/receiver on the same show on an HD channel, which suggests that something is amiss.\n\nYou can often listen to a music show in 5.1 and it sounds great. You can listen to in stereo on an SD channel and it sounds great. But when you listen to it in stereo, not 5.1, on an HD channel, the vocals sound a bit thin and lost.\n\nDes Cartes, London Lite and harshy gave kudos\n\nPermalink"
