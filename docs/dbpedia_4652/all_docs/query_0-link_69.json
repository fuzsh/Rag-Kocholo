        "text": "In season 6 and before, Apex Legends was working just fine with my 5.1 surround sound. After a few games of season 7, it was obvious something was wrong with the sound. I did the only in-game audio test I could think of and threw frag grenades in the firing range. There is no sound coming out of the rear/sur speakers, Apex Legends reports a 5.1 audio configuration in Windows 10, and audio tests confirm all speakers are working outside of Apex Legends.\n\nI checked the settings.cfg file and found the line:\n\nsound_num_speakers \"2\"\n\nI changed it to:\n\nsound_num_speakers \"6\"\n\nC:\\Users\\USERNAME\\Saved Games\\Respawn\\Apex\\local\\settings.cfg\n\nThat didn't change it in game.\n\nI tried the launch option \"+miles_channels 6\" and that didn't seem to do it either. I read somewhere that it has to do with sound occlusion.\n\nThis bug really screws with my situational awareness. Please fix.\n\n@EA_AticCan we get a super simple online or offline audio/video test map accessible from Settings?\n\nSomething I always liked about Apex and Titanfall games is that background feeling that it's all a test or training and you're the subject.\n\nIf the test map is not simple, it could be something like this:\n\nYou are wraith. You are strapped into the chair at labs in third person. There may be NPC lab techs around you that are going about their business and they make footstep sounds at least. After a time, you hear void wraith voices and see faint ghost-like versions of wraith at random points around you. Some still, some walking in a circle around you. They are the main source of the test sounds. The chair is where sound is heard from, not the camera. Maybe lock vertical look axis. You may be able to free yourself, but when you do the screen fades and the test ends. It could be made to look like this is a simulation with Dr. Singh being the last shot before it ends. This could be one of the most dramatic, cinematic, and lore enforcing test maps ever.\n\n2020-01-02 EDIT: At the end, it could be revealed Wraith was having a flashback during the games after entering the test chamber in labs."
