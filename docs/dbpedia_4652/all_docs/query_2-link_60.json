        "text": "I'll rephrase (again, 'techno-inept'):\n\nBuying new HP desktop soon (waiting on availability) and I want to be certain\n\nbefore purchasing, it'll accomodate my 5.1 Surround Sound System...a complete\n\npackaged system consisting of 4 'desktop' speakers (1 left front +1 right front +\n\n1 left rear + 1 right rear), single Center Channel speaker, a separate Subwoofer.\n\nShopping, I've learned that few state \"accomodate 5.1 Stereo Surround\" and have\n\nlearned via current owner reviews, that is NOT always accurate (initiating returns).\n\nSo as I look up \"Customer Images\" and/or \"Manufacturer Information\" to see actual\n\npic(s) of the back of units; just want to learn what ports to look for to be sure it'll fit.\n\n@TexasIndian\n\nMany machines support 5.1 system using software, not hardware that why I asked number of cables. They may only have 3 connectors but software can give 5.1 sound.\n\nIn your case, it is much better to wait when getting the machine. I don't think desktops have 5 ports for 5.1 system as default, you have to pay to get option with a sound card.\n\nRegards.\n\nBH\n\n***\n\n**Click the KUDOS thumb up on the left to say 'Thanks'**\n\nMake it easier for other people to find solutions by marking a Reply 'Accept as Solution' if it solves your problem.\n\nhi\n\nThis may be difficult to identify\n\nI had several models with different functionality..\n\nyou can have a model, with audio outputs, clearly identified, classic audio output, sub woofer connector, central, front rear ..\n\nBut many current models can have 5.1, but you have to use the connectors, named headphone / microphone output etc.\n\nsee topic here\n\nhttps://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Desktop-Audio/5-1-surround-sound-speakers/m-p/8035652#M63275\n\nbut sometimes hp mentions that there may be need for additional hardware without further details\n\nthe motherboard supports 5.1 surround sound. If the computer does not have the required audio jacks for a 5.1 configuration, additional hardware is required to use 5.1 surround sound.\n\nIf you're asking the question I assume you don't have an SPDIF connector\n\n--------------------------------------------- Signature ---------------------------------------------\n\nwas this reply helpful , or just say thank you ?
