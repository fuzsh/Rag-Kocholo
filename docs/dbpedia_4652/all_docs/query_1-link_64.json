        "text": "We’ve quizzed our home cinema experts to get solutions to some of the most common soundbar issues so you can get back up and running. The good news is that many soundbar problems have pretty straightforward solutions.\n\nWhatever the problem, fixing your soundbar will almost certainly be cheaper – and more environmentally friendly – than replacing it.\n\nBut if you run through all of the solutions below and your soundbar still isn't performing as you want it to, it could be time for a new one. Check out three soundbar models to shortlist or take a look at all our soundbar reviews.\n\nI get no sound from my soundbar at all\n\nThere are a few simple solutions to this problem. If your soundbar has multiple input plugs on the back, make sure your soundbar is set to that input. For example, if your soundbar has multiple optical inputs, ensure you have selected the correct input on your remote control.\n\nIf you’re sure your soundbar is set to the correct source, check that your TV or set-top box’s settings are compatible with your soundbar. This is particularly important with digital connections such as HDMI and optical because not all soundbars can process some newer types of audio – for example, you might have a Blu-ray player that’s set to produce audio in the DTS:X format, but if your soundbar doesn’t support it you might not get any sound at all.\n\nCheck your soundbar manual for supported audio formats and then find the audio outputs settings menu (this will vary by device) and find a format that matches those supported by your soundbar. The mode called ‘PCM’ is generally a good starting point.\n\nIf you don’t have that information to hand, use trial and error to find an output format that works.\n\nOur Soundbars glossary reveals all the soundbar tech terms you need to know.\n\nTech tips you can trust - get our free Tech newsletter for advice, news, deals and stuff the manuals don’t tell you\n\nI get a static noise or hum from my soundbar\n\nIf you’re using a 3.5mm aux cable to connect to your soundbar, this is likely the culprit. First, ensure both ends of the cable are fully and securely inserted into your TV and soundbar.\n\nTry to keep the cable clear of other connectors (especially power) in the tangle of wires behind your TV. Simply moving the 3.5mm cable can sometimes solve this issue.\n\nIf this doesn’t solve the problem, make sure your TV volume is turned all the way up so you can adjust the soundbar’s volume directly. This might help since interference is introduced when the source (TV) volume is low and the output (soundbar) volume is high.\n\nIf neither of the above work, you could try what's called a ground loop isolator. This is an extra adapter that sits between your TV and your soundbar, so should eliminate noise. They cost between £5 and £15 if you buy online. However, they aren’t always completely effective and can occasionally cause additional problems such as reducing bass performance, but this is uncommon.\n\nIf your soundbar supports it, try using an alternative connection such as HDMI or digital optical. These are generally much less susceptible to noise.\n\nMy soundbar turns off or goes to sleep while sound is playing\n\nIf you have an issue with your soundbar going to sleep after a set amount of time, it’s likely due to its energy-saving settings. To prevent them from consuming unnecessary power when they’re not being used, most soundbars power down if they don’t detect an audio signal. However, some sound bars are more sensitive than others and some will power down even when there’s audio being played at a quiet volume.\n\nSome cheaper soundbars may only offer a 3.5mm audio input. We’d only ever recommend using this connection if your TV or soundbar has no digital alternatives such as digital optical (Toslink), coaxial or HDMI.\n\nIf you have a soundbar connected via a 3.5mm cable, make sure your TV's volume is turned up as high as it can go. This means you only ever need to adjust the volume using your soundbar’s remote control and also means your TV is delivering a powerful enough signal to ensure your soundbar never goes to sleep when sound is playing.\n\nConnecting to a set-top box or disc player\n\nThis can also happen when your soundbar is connected to a set-top box such as Freeview, Sky or a Blu-ray or DVD player that has its own volume control. As with the above tips, you should ensure the set-top box has its own volume set as high as it can go. This should also prevent your soundbar from going to sleep.\n\nMy soundbar sounds no better than my TV\n\nOne complaint you might see frequently, even on top-end soundbars, is that they don’t sound any better than the TV they’re supposed to be connected to.\n\nThe answer could be simply that your soundbar isn't actually producing any audio, meaning you'll still be listening to your TV's speakers.\n\nThis is more common when you’re watching TV using a set-top box such as a Sky or Freeview box. Even if your set-top box is connected to your TV and your TV to your soundbar, you may find the audio only gets to your TV's speakers.\n\nDepending on the age of your box, you might need to either connect directly to your soundbar the traditional audio RCA cables (these are the red and white connectors on older models) or the digital optical cable (newer models). You’ll still need to use the Scart or HDMI cable to connect to your TV, as this will provide the pictures.\n\nIn addition, you'll need to go into your set-top box’s audio settings to ensure that sound is routed through your soundbar instead of to your TV. Change the settings to the audio connector you have chosen to connect to the soundbar, for instance optical or 3.5mm aux.\n\nIdeally, your TV and soundbar will support HDMI ARC (Audio Return Channel). This allows you to connect your kit directly to your TV, and your TV will handle sending the audio back to your soundbar via HDMI. You can check to see whether your TV and soundbar have ARC by checking to see whether the ports are labelled as such or by checking the manual. Cheap TVs and soundbars often don’t support this feature.\n\nIf you need help setting up your soundbar to work properly with your TV, read our guide on how to set up a soundbar with your TV\n\nMy soundbar or subwoofer is quiet or sounds unnatural\n\nMany soundbars have audio enhancement modes that change the balance of the sound. Some models also have a Night Mode that turns down certain noises that are more likely to disturb somebody sleeping in the next room. Check you haven’t turned that mode on by using your soundbar’s remote control.\n\nSimilarly, most soundbars have a dialogue-enhancement mode that boosts higher-pitched sounds such as speech. It can work well, but our expert audio panel has found on some models it can make everything sound awful. As above, check using your remote control that you haven’t accidentally enabled this mode.\n\nIf you're only getting parts of the sound, it’s also possible that your TV, set-top box, or disc player is outputting audio that your soundbar can’t use properly. Similar to the problem earlier in this guide where no sound is coming out at all, your soundbar might be receiving a full 5.1 surround sound mix but may only support 2.1 or 2.0. This means you might be missing out on a huge amount of the sound that’s supposed to be in the movie you’re watching. Ensure that your TV and other boxes aren’t outputting in surround sound, again by finding the audio settings menus and ensuring they’re set to either 2.0 or 2.1.\n\nMy picture and sound are out of sync\n\nIf your video device (such as a Sky box, TV box or DVD player) is plugged directly into your soundbar, it’s possible for your sound to get ahead of (fall behind) the image on your TV. Many modern boxes have a feature to prevent this - you’ll find this in your audio settings menu.\n\nLook for a setting called ‘Audio Delay’ or similar on the box that’s causing the problem, and adjust it notch by notch until you’re happy that your audio and video are perfectly in-sync again.\n\nMy soundbar's remote control isn't working properly\n\nFirst, check the obvious: that you've fitted its batteries the correct way round (follow the symbols in the remote's battery compartment). Also, try a fresh set of batteries - batteries that aren't depleted but on their way out are likely to cause intermittent problems.\n\nNext, check to see you have a clear line of sight between the remote and the soundbar itself. If you can't spot the infrared receiver on your soundbar, keep the entire device free of ornaments or other blockages. Additionally, avoid using the remote or soundbar in very bright light, as this can also impede the sensor and check for dirt or dust on the remote control or soundbar receiver sensors.\n\nNext, check all the soundbar cables are properly connected to your TV, as your soundbar's remote may only work when it has been properly set up with the TV. Follow the instructions that came with your soundbar - there's often a more comprehensive manual available if you search on the internet for your soundbar's specific model name and download directly from the manufacturer's website (be careful of third-party manual sites).\n\nFor many remotes, you can also check if your remote is sending IR signal by looking at the top edge of the remote through a camera viewfinder. Our eyes cannot see infrared (IR) light, but many digital cameras can (some smartphones have IR filters which can block this check - try both the front and rear smartphone cameras). If you do not see a flash through the camera viewfinder when a button is pressed, the remote may not be sending any signal.\n\nIf your soundbar has an accompanying app for your smartphone or tablet, you could use this as an alternative to the remote, at least on a temporary basis. Some brands also let you buy replacement remotes separately, which is worth trying if you suspect your remote control is faulty (for example, if it stopped working after you dropped it).\n\nMy soundbar or subwoofer isn’t working at all\n\nIt may sound obvious, but check that it’s plugged in and that the wall socket (and the multiplug adapter, if you're using one) is switched on.\n\nIf your soundbar's separate speakers or subwoofer are ‘passive’, this means it needs to be connected directly to the soundbar using a cable. It doesn’t require external power, but ensure the connection is secure.\n\nIf there are any buttons or menus that alter the settings of your subwoofer, including a button for increasing the bass of your soundbar, use these to check it hasn’t been turned down or turned off. If all else fails, contact the manufacturer as failed subwoofers are not uncommon.\n\nNeed a new soundbar?
