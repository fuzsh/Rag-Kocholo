        "text": "Although some Media Production students have their own digital cameras and production equipment, the Media Production Office allows students to check out cameras and other production equipment. Its team of staff and student workers exists to train students on how to use and respect the equipment that our industry uses to make creative and commercial works.\n\nThere’s a list of equipment available to students according to the courses they’re enrolled in.\n\nA large number of new digital cameras have been purchased recently. Other available equipment includes tripods, ARRI and LED light kits, microphones, and a dolly and track for camera movement.\n\nStudents come to the office in 3200 MEH and request the equipment they would like to borrow 24 hours in advance. If it’s your first time checking out a particular piece of equipment, you’ll have to take a simple camera and/or system test to make sure you know how to properly utilize the equipment.\n\nYou’ll also sign a form stating that if any equipment is lost or broken, you will be held responsible.\n\nEquipment is checked out for 24 hours at a time, with the exception of weekends, in which students are encouraged to work together with their classmates to ensure that everyone can get what they need.\n\nWhen a professor gives an assignment, there is always a rush of students trying to complete it the last couple of days before it’s due ... so don’t procrastinate or you may discover that all of the Media Production Office's cameras are already checked out.\n\nStudents go to the Media Production Office to schedule time in editing bays. Hours for editing are Monday-Friday, 9 a.m.-5 p.m.\n\nStudents are always welcome to come to the office with production questions or to unlock facilities."
