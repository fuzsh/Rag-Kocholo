Features I need include trimming, appending, and adding narration to paused frames.\n\nEase of use and cost (less than $100) are my primary concerns. There is no need for special effects or advanced transitions.\n\nSo far I've tried Windows Movie Maker and Vegas Movie Studio Platinum. The latter looks promising, but it won't detect the audio in my 5.1 channel video files. (Windows Media Player does play the files back in surround sound.)\n\nEDIT: For reference, Windows lists the audio in the files as 4608kbps, 6 channel, and 48kHz."
