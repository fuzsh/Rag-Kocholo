        "text": "As I recently heard a DTS 5.1 Surround Upmix of a very old album that I've heard a [who knows how many] times -- and liked what I was hearing very much -- I'm now trying to learn anything I can about the process.\n\nI blame it on movie watching, but my wife and I have been trying to \"upgrade\" our music system from strictly stereo listening to surround for quite a while now, but the cost of physical surround media is pricing us out of the market. The mountainous area we live in excludes us from high-speed internet service, so I haven't even bothered frustrating myself with streaming audio, and all that it entails.\n\nAs I was doing some searching on the subject at hand, I came across an old closed thread (from 2013), here on the SHF, that indicates that there [were] \"surround processors\" available that can process stereo music into 5.1 \"on-the-fly.\" In short, the poster questioned the O.P.'s desire to use software to convert his stereo CDs into DTS 5.1, and even referred to the idea as a \"faked 5.1 version.\" In addition, he indicated that the sound card in his PC was capable (at the time) of outputting 5.1 channel DTS from any source.\n\nApparently, all of those years of stereo music listening sheltered both of us from many advancements in recording formats, but, regardless, I'd really appreciate learning more about the various ways available to move from our modestly large stereo CD collection to DTS 5.1 surround. If anyone would care to share their thoughts and/or experiences with accomplishing this, please take us to school on it.\n\nThank you kindly for your time...\n\nThere are hundreds of multi-channel SACDs out there today. Amazon and Acoustic Sounds have a large selection. DTS is another animal, it's delivered via optical or coax S/PDIF; but, if you are accessing multi-channel from a DVD, BD, or UBD Player, no problem. The bottom-line is after hearing 5.1 multi-channel from SACD, BD, DTS recordings, or FLAC downloads, stereo in any format is like drinking a Coke that's gone flat, no fizz. One player that plays everything multi-channel, disc or download is the OPPO-205. It is discontinued but is extraordinary, having multi-channel analog output in addition to HDMI output. Another route is the Sony UBP-X1100ES Player. It has multi-channel HDMI output; and, connected to one of today's AVRs or Pre-Pros, it can deliver most any multi-channel disc format to an AVR or Pre-Pro. Another means to 5.1 is via downloading and then via usb connection to a Universal Player outputting to an AVR or Pre-Pro, or direct to AVR, Pre-Pro, you can enjoy multi-channel albeit with some inconvenience due to more computer clicking operations than you might have the patience for.\n\nI can hear surround sound from my two channel system and it can be very convincing.\n\nOf course I'm not synthesizing it. It has to be on the recording that way, but often there is great front to back depth on a stereo mix, though most never do get to hear it.\n\nBack in the 70s I did a lot of experimenting creating processes that could do that in a stereo mix in the studio, but that was a long time ago and now there are many much easier ways to create that.\n\nI certainly enjoy 5.1 sound, from SACD, DTS, DVD-A and Blu-ray discs. There is also one label who has made a splash in the past few years putting older quad mixes onto SACD's, and the quality is far measurably better than the 1970's decoders for those old LP's brought us. I eventually intend to rip them all (some require specific equipment, others require specific software) into FLAC, so I can have them shuffling on a NAS along with my traditional stereo tracks.\n\nFLAC versions of 5.1 files can also be used on specific players in cars and minivans that also play DVD's for the kids in the backseat. It's nowhere near universal, so availability of this can vary.\n\nRest assured, having surround mixes in your life, usually translates into you wanting it wherever you can enjoy it.\n\nBut no, although SACD and DVD-A mixes are readily available, some are getting harder to come by now.\n\nThere are those who \"upmix\" (that is, take their stereo tracks and use specific hardware and/or software to turn them into modified surround signals); they're not nearly as avidly discussed here as they are on a forum such as QuadraphonicQuad, where enthusiasts experiment with SpecWeb and other software, and Involve's \"SurroundMaster\" decoders and more arcane tools.\n\nThere's actually a lot going on behind the scenes that we simply don't talk about here, but it stems from there being so many different formats of surround sound in different media, that people take up the challenge of trying to unify the different sources for their own ergonomic means.\n\nHere, you can bring up a simple technology such as Digitally-Extracted Stereo that finds parts of a mono recording you can separate into a stereo image, and they look at you like you're some sort of a necromancer or voodoo doctor (or a witch).\n\nI've been at 2-channel stereo since the 70s and, as I mentioned in the OP, I didn't really know much different until we started looking for a \"modern\" television...and, eventually, started to sample what came after stereo. I've been listening to McIntosh gear through B&W for an awful long time and, once I heard that DTS 5.1 upmix I described, via our Oppo 105D, I thought that I was hearing an album I've been listening to for nearly 50 years for the first time. I appreciate your post, but we (my wife and I) are both more than a bit interested and, in fact, we've already made investments in 5.1 surround in the form of additional amplification.\n\nThanks again for posting\n\nYour second sentence pretty much describes how I felt once I heard that old album from my collection in the DTS 5.1 surround format. We don't own an Oppo 205, but we do own and enjoy an Oppo 105D. As I understand it, it's quite capable of being a part of any [future] ripping operations, if that's how things work out. In your last sentence, you mentioned downloading files to be processed by a universal player. As we live in the mountains, we are handicapped when it comes to high-speed internet access, so downloading anything presents some pretty serious issues...so I guess that your initial sentence is the one that I'd like to get more information on. Keeping in mind that I'd like to use our relatively large stereo CD collection as a source for DTS upmixing, would you please elaborate on your first sentence?\n\nYou're not the first to recommend Marantz to us. In the past, it's been AVR recommendations for listening to surround movies, but we already have a large investment in a McIntosh AVR that has Room Perfect capability...and, once you have that dialed in, it's hard to go back. Nevertheless, if we can figure out a way to get the \"DTS 5.1 Surround\" sound I mentioned in the OP from our stereo CD collection, I'd seriously consider adding hardware that can do the job.\n\nThinking back on our last visit to the Magnolia Design Center, I was under the impression that the type of AVR that you've linked me to is for people who wish to have all kinds of speakers around and above their heads...but, once again, if there are AVRs out there that can make our 2-channel music sound like the DTS upmix I based this thread on, I'll definitely look into it...and, to clarify things a bit, 5.1 is all we're after at this point.\n\nThank you for the post\n\nI will definitely keep this in mind, DD. The truth is that I don't get a lot of time to sit in front of a computer and do a lot of reading. I'm already a QQF member, but I think that it was a friend's affinity with quad sound that initially brought me there. In other words, I though that the QuadraphonicQuad was literally for old-school quad lovers. Like I just wrote, I have a friend that digs quad sound, but I've never actually heard a proper quad setup...and, perhaps, I don't want to. I mean, seriously, I've already got the surround bug so bad that I'm a bit pensive about anything that's supposed to be \"better than surround.\" Regardless, I will go back to the QQF and do some more searching around as soon as I can.\n\nThanks for the very informative post\n\nYou couldn't be more wrong, or uninformed, and I'll just leave it at that.\n\nThere's a great on-going thread that member @mark winstanley started about all the surround mixes out there, with more coming out regularly. There's so much available, including new, that I have to hold back on what I purchase. Currently waiting for the Japanese Quad SACD of Santana's Lotus to arrive, and that's a recent release. You just have to know where to look.\n\nSurrounded On Sundays - 5.1/quad reviews and summaries\n\nOP, back to your question....my Marantz AVR (which handles 5.1 over HDMI) will process a stereo signal into stereo in all the channels, but I'm not sure it's a DTS mix or what you're looking for.\n\nFirst, a word about DTS. It's a processor which first appeared in early 1990's AVRs and Digital Preamps. This processor synthesized a 5.1 multi-channel experience from stereo. This means to \"surround\" music has been eclipsed by technology which processes music that has been originally mastered to multiple channels The most popular of these later formats for multi-channel music pleasure is 5.1 SACD. This format appeared in the early 2000's. Your OPPO will process both stereo and 5.1 SACDs. Some folks, like me, have purchased their OPPOs specifically for that task. Now, the reality is there are realitively few 5.1 SACDs being produced these days so your pleasure from 5.1 SACD may be tempered by your music genre preferences. I am a big fan of 5.1 SACD and thus I enjoy promoting it.\n\nI have moved from 2 speaker listening in my vinyl room to 5 speaker listening and will not go back. I use 2 amplifiers (my pre has 2 sets of outputs), one has a volume control. The front speakers are in their normal position, the \"surround\" speakers are at the sides, almost even with the sitting position, with their backs to the side walls. The amp with the volume control helps to dial in the balance between the 4 speakers. I then have an REL sub-woofer that gets its signal off of the speaker outputs, and it sits in one corner.\n\nThe sound is engulfing, much like listening with headphones, without the headphones. The sound stage became larger and there is an emergence into the music. There is no signal processing other then the comb effects from the front and side speakers. Often music seems like it is coming from any one of the 4 speakers. I will never go back to listening to 2 speaker stereo.\n\n'ner"
