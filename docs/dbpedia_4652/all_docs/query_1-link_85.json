Instead I've only ever seen it engage the default Dolby surround back channel upmixer which, in the case of my pre-Atmos AVRs, is \"DD+ PLIIx Cinema\". I have seen DD+ 7.1 on Blu-ray before though (when I had the player's settings wrong) so I know the AVR can do it.\n\nI would have thought that the many movies that were mastered in 7.1 would be streamed in this format but, given the above, suspect these are all being downmixed into DD+5.1 to reduce bandwidth usage.\n\nHas anyone ever experienced native DD+ 7.1 via a streaming service?\n\ndante01\n\nOutstanding Member\n\nJoined\n\nMar 5, 2009\n\nMessages\n\n58,243\n\nSolutions\n\n1\n\nReaction score\n\n16,113\n\nPoints\n\n9,936\n\nMay 17, 2022\n\n#2\n\nI'd hazzard that it is due to the additional bandwidth needed to convey a 7.1 stream compared to what is required for a 5.1 audio stream? Atmos doesn't actually have additional channels and is merely metadata packaged with the 5.1 DD+ audio so wouldn't put as much strain on the bandwidth as including 2 discrete back channels would.\n\nIt is basically the same reason streaming services haven't adopted HD formats and drawn the line at DD+. Bandwidth.\n\nNo, I've never received anythiong more than 5.1 DD+ or Atmos via any of the mainstream streaming srvices.\n\nI don't currently subscribe to the Apple TV+ service, but I've see it posted elsewhere that 'Foundation' is inclusive of a 7.1 DD+ soundtrack? There are also other reports that some films accessed via Apple are also encoded with 7.1 audio?\n\nLast edited: May 17, 2022\n\nJoined\n\nSep 23, 2016\n\nMessages\n\n3,178\n\nSolutions\n\n1\n\nReaction score\n\n3,677\n\nPoints\n\n1,141\n\nLocation\n\nWiltshire, UK\n\nMay 17, 2022\n\n#3\n\nI'd hazzard that it is due to the additional bandwidth needed to convey a 7.1 stream compared to what is required for a 5.1 audio stream?\n\nOK, that's what I said I think is going on.\n\nAtmos doesn;t actually have additional channels and is merely metadata packaged with the 5.1 DD+ audio so wouldn't put as much strain on the bandwidth as including 2 discrete back channels would.\n\nThis is interesting though.

An Atmos setup will always priotioties the Atmos metadata which which then negate the channel based soundtrack. You'd basically have to disengage or turn off the height speakers in the setup to force the receiver to use the discrete channel based format the metadata was packaged with. Yes, the Atmos soundtrack uses the channel based audio, but Atmos AV receivers don't give you an option to flick between Atmos and the channel based audio, not without ammending the speaker configurations and disabling the height and or ceiling speakers.\n\nIt should also be noted that even without heoght speakers, an AV receiver will still give you Atmos if you've back surrounds present in a setup. This makes it practically impossible to actually portrat a discrete 7.1 soundtrack even if you turn the height speakers off. You'd basically get 7.1 Atmos.\n\nYou'd basically need a 7.1 DD+ non Atmos supporting AV receiver to be able to effectively test this. Even without the height speakers, a 7.1 configuration will result in you getting Atmos on an Atmos receiver.\n\nJoined\n\nSep 23, 2016\n\nMessages\n\n3,178\n\nSolutions\n\n1\n\nReaction score\n\n3,677\n\nPoints\n\n1,141\n\nLocation\n\nWiltshire, UK\n\nMay 17, 2022\n\n#6\n\nThat depends on whether or not the audio is inclusive of Atmos or not.

That's what I was referring to when I said \"traditional non-Atmos 7.1 speaker layout\". So yes it would be 7.1 Atmos, just streamed in a compressed form via a DD+ codec.\n\nI'm interested because I find that, provided the sound mixer made good use of the extra channels, on Blu-ray discrete 7.1 HD soundtracks usually sound appreciably better than 5.1 ones upmixed to 7.1.\n\nUntil now I've always thought that my system's 7.1 speaker layout wouldn't benefit from moving to an Atmos capable AVR unless I added extra speakers but it looks like I'm wrong on that.\n\nJase\n\nOutstanding Member\n\nJoined\n\nMar 16, 2001\n\nMessages\n\n14,259\n\nReaction score\n\n8,024\n\nPoints\n\n6,990\n\nLocation\n\nUK\n\nMay 17, 2022\n\n#7\n\nJust tested this out with my Marantz SR7012. In the Amp Assign menu I set it to the default 9.1 with a 5CH & SB configuration and no heights. Speaker Config was set to 7.1.\n\nTV is an LG E7 which can pass Atmos via ARC. Using the internal Apps Netflix, Disney+, Amazon and ATV+. Atmos tracks show as Atmos despite there being no height speakers (as @dante01 mentions above).\n\nAll 5.1 content comes up as 5.1 DD+ although you can then engage an upmixer if you want 7.1. What I can do though is force an Atmos track back to 5.1 DD+ by pressing the green Movie button on the remote.\n\nHere's the weird bit. Both the Input and Output Channel Indicators think there's a 7.1 signal and the Surround Backs are active. They're not, they're silent*, as I have a poweramp for the five main channels that I can turn off so only the SB's are on.\n\nEdit. Pressing the Status button to check the format also shows Dolby Digital+. Format 3/4/.1.\n\n*Apart from ATV+ content\n\nLast edited: May 17, 2022\n\nJay53\n\nProminent Member\n\nJoined\n\nJun 25, 2001\n\nMessages\n\n2,084\n\nReaction score\n\n427\n\nPoints\n\n371\n\nLocation\n\nBerkshire\n\nMay 17, 2022\n\n#8\n\nI think it depends on what you have configured your amp as.\n\nOn my x1700 i can configure the 6th and 7th channels as\n\nFront height, top front, top middle, front Dolby, surround Dolby. All of these support dolby Atmos and DTS:X\n\nHowever if I specify they are surround back which I believe is the traditional 7.1 setup then neither dolby Atmos nor DTS:X are supported.

Height, ceiling or upward firing speakers are not a strict requirement for Atmos if you've back surrounds present in your setup.\n\nAtmos can be portrayed via a 7.1 floor layer configuration. You'd obviously not experience the same overhead effects that you;d get if you had the heights or ceiling speakers though. The soundtrack being portrayed will be object based as opposed to channel based though and the AV receiver will be using the associated metadata.\n\nWhat you cannot have is Atmos via a 5.1 setup absent of the back surrounds or height speakers, not without using Dolby Virtual Height processing.\n\nLast edited: May 17, 2022\n\nJoined\n\nSep 23, 2016\n\nMessages\n\n3,178\n\nSolutions\n\n1\n\nReaction score\n\n3,677\n\nPoints\n\n1,141\n\nLocation\n\nWiltshire, UK\n\nMay 17, 2022\n\n#10\n\nTV is an LG E7 which can pass Atmos via ARC.

There's no real advantage gained by portraying an Atmos soundtrack via a setup absent of height speakers. I doubt most would even notice a difference compared to conventional 7.1?\n\nWhether the Atmos 7.1 effect sounds better than discrete 7.1 is also debatable.\n\nJoined\n\nSep 23, 2016\n\nMessages\n\n3,178\n\nSolutions\n\n1\n\nReaction score\n\n3,677\n\nPoints\n\n1,141\n\nLocation\n\nWiltshire, UK\n\nMay 17, 2022\n\n#12\n\nThere's no real advantage gained by portraying an Atmos soundtrack via a setup absent of height speakers.\n\nThere is if it will get you discrete 7.1 audio vs upmixed 5.1 audio over streaming services. The jump to discrete 7.1 when Blu-ray came along was IMO hugely significant. Those back speakers lit up like never before.\n\nYou didn't directly answer the question though. Do you actually know if you will get discrete 7.1 surround sound when streaming a 7.1.4 mixed Atmos track through a traditional 7.1 configured layout in an Atmos capable AVR?\n\nI'm not actually expecting you to know because unless you've tried it yourself or know someone that has then you won't, you would just be speculating like me.\n\ndante01\n\nOutstanding Member\n\nJoined\n\nMar 5, 2009\n\nMessages\n\n58,243\n\nSolutions\n\n1\n\nReaction score\n\n16,113\n\nPoints\n\n9,936\n\nMay 17, 2022\n\n#13\n\nDepends upon whether or not the soundtrack actually include 2 discrete back channels. If not then no, you'll never get discerete back channel audio.\n\nI'd need access to the actual audio package to be able to ascertain this. This isn't something I'd be able to do if using one of the streaming services, not with the equipmemt or software I've got at my disposal.\n\nThere's usually metadata included with content that will state the exact audio configuration, including the number of discrete channels present in the channel based formatted audio as well as whether or not object based metadata is included.\n\nThe AV receiver would read the above mentioned metadata and give you the number of discrete channels present. I can only therefore assume that no, you are not getting discrete 7.1 DD+ if the AV receiver fails to report this?\n\nYou cannot create discrete channels, they have to be present in the audio to begin with.\n\nLast edited: May 17, 2022\n\nJase\n\nOutstanding Member\n\nJoined\n\nMar 16, 2001\n\nMessages\n\n14,259\n\nReaction score\n\n8,024\n\nPoints\n\n6,990\n\nLocation\n\nUK\n\nMay 17, 2022\n\n#14\n\nHi Jase, maybe when you have time you can check out that Foundation series on ATV+ that @dante01 referenced to and see if it shows up as \"DD+7.1\".

It's a bit naff on the LG.\n\nGoing by what I tried on Netflix (Jupiters Legacy and the Umbrella Academy). Both show as Atmos on a traditional 7.1 bed layer set up. All the speakers were active until I forced it back to DD+ and then the SB output stopped.\n\nThe AVR shows it's receiving a 3/4/.1 signal (7.1) though and shows the SB as receiving and outputting a signal even though they remain silent. Switch back to Atmos via the green movie button and they spring into action again.\n\nEdit. The above also applied to Guardians of the Galaxy on Disney+.\n\nLast edited: May 17, 2022\n\nJay53\n\nProminent Member\n\nJoined\n\nJun 25, 2001\n\nMessages\n\n2,084\n\nReaction score\n\n427\n\nPoints\n\n371\n\nLocation\n\nBerkshire\n\nMay 17, 2022\n\n#15\n\nSo on my x1700 I bet the following\n\nAmp assign set to surround back\n\nNetlflix plays Atmos film as Atmos and Denon app shows it's receiving Atmos DD+ 48kHz but doesn't show any discrete channels for input.

Just re-installed the ATV+ App. Foundation comes up as Atmos but if I then force it back to DD+ it is indeed DD+ 7.1 as the SB's are still active. The signal format also shows 3/4/.1.\n\nHowever, switching to DD+ 7.1 from Atmos appears to affect the content they produce. With Atmos they're more active with more effects such as music etc.\n\nSo, other ATV+ content is also showing as DD+ 7.1 albeit with less activity in the SB channels compared to Atmos decoding. Shining Girls, The Essex Serpent and Tehran are all in DD+ 7.1 but again with less SB activity.\n\nAs an aside for @dante01 and his comments above. He's correct. If the Surround Backs are configured then Atmos decoding is available. Turn them off in the Amp Assign menu and Atmos decoding is no longer an option. Only upmixing is available.\n\ndante01\n\nOutstanding Member\n\nJoined\n\nMar 5, 2009\n\nMessages\n\n58,243\n\nSolutions\n\n1\n\nReaction score\n\n16,113\n\nPoints\n\n9,936\n\nMay 17, 2022\n\n#17\n\nSo on my x1700 I bet the following\n\nAmp assign set to surround back\n\nNetlflix plays Atmos film as Atmos and Denon app shows it's receiving Atmos DD+ 48kHz but doesn't show any discrete channels for input. Output is using SBR and SBL as configured in Amp assign.\n\nIt wouldn't indicate any discrete channels because the AV receiver is processing it as Atmos. Atmos is object and not channel based.\n\ndante01\n\nOutstanding Member\n\nJoined\n\nMar 5, 2009\n\nMessages\n\n58,243\n\nSolutions\n\n1\n\nReaction score\n\n16,113\n\nPoints\n\n9,936\n\nMay 17, 2022\n\n#18\n\nI've sourced one of Dolby's own demo files encoded with DD+ and Atmos and this is what Media Info reports regarding the audio:\n\nAudio\n\nID : 2\n\nFormat : E-AC-3 JOC\n\nFormat/Info : Enhanced AC-3 with Joint Object Coding\n\nCommercial name : Dolby Digital Plus with Dolby Atmos\n\nCodec ID : ec-3\n\nDuration : 1 min 3 s\n\nBit rate mode : Constant\n\nBit rate : 448 kb/s\n\nChannel(s) : 6 channels\n\nChannel layout : L R C LFE Ls Rs\n\nSampling rate : 48.0 kHz\n\nFrame rate : 31.250 FPS (1536 SPF)\n\nCompression mode : Lossy\n\nStream size : 3.39 MiB (5%)\n\nService kind : Complete Main\n\nDefault : Yes\n\nAlternate group : 2\n\nEncoded date : UTC 2018-05-03 17:08:46\n\nTagged date : UTC 2018-05-03 17:08:46\n\nComplexity index : 16\n\nNumber of dynamic objects : 15\n\nBed channel count : 1 channel\n\nBed channel configuration : LFE\n\nDolby\\'s own DD+/Atmos demo's only appear to include 6 discrete channels within the DD+ channel based element of the package and no back surround channels?\n\nLast edited: May 17, 2022\n\nJase\n\nOutstanding Member\n\nJoined\n\nMar 16, 2001\n\nMessages\n\n14,259\n\nReaction score\n\n8,024\n\nPoints\n\n6,990\n\nLocation\n\nUK\n\nMay 17, 2022\n\n#19\n\n@Mr Wolf\n\nI'll try my ATV4K that's connected to a Denon X3700 and see what signal/format that receives. I'm now curious to know if it also flags up a 3/4/.1 signal from any of the Apps.\n\nWell, scrap that idea. The 3700 still shows an Atmos signal even when set up as just 5.1 and won't let me force DD+. That's likely down to the ATV4K as it usually outputs either Atmos or Multichannel PCM depending on what I'm watching.\n\nThe TV it's connected to doesn't pass Atmos via ARC or it's Apps so I can't test it that way.\n\nLast edited: May 17, 2022\n\nJay53\n\nProminent Member\n\nJoined\n\nJun 25, 2001\n\nMessages\n\n2,084\n\nReaction score\n\n427\n\nPoints\n\n371\n\nLocation\n\nBerkshire\n\nMay 17, 2022\n\n#20\n\nIt wouldn't indicate any discrete channels because the AV receiver is processing it as Atmos.

It isn't as though there's an issue with bandwidth if encoding a disc with a film.\n\nMark.Yudkin\n\nDistinguished Member\n\nJoined\n\nSep 19, 2007\n\nMessages\n\n11,627\n\nReaction score\n\n2,251\n\nPoints\n\n1,918\n\nLocation\n\nZurich, CH\n\nMay 19, 2022\n\n#23\n\nDD+ was a failure since it needed greater bandwidth (1.7 resp. 3MB/s) than S/PDIF (640KB/s), but the distribution formats (Bluray , UHD) all have the bandwidth (18MB/s) for True HD. With DD+ having lossy compression and True HD having lossless compression, it was a no-contest for physical formats.\n\nDD+ only really had an opportunity with streaming services prepared to devote a higher bandwidth to audio than S/PDIF, but not enough that TrueHD was viable. Such sources are rare, most content providers preferring to offer more content channels than higher quality audio.\n\nJoined\n\nSep 23, 2016\n\nMessages\n\n3,178\n\nSolutions\n\n1\n\nReaction score\n\n3,677\n\nPoints\n\n1,141\n\nLocation\n\nWiltshire, UK\n\nMay 19, 2022\n\n#24\n\nDD+ was a failure since it needed greater bandwidth\n\nI wouldn't call DD+ a failure at at all. In fact it's what most of us (AVR/AVP owners) are listening to from the current streaming services every day. It was just launched ahead of its time as Blu-ray came along shortly after it was released which removed the need for data compression in disc media.\n\nMy understanding is that it's been widely adopted by the streaming services as it's a far more bandwidth efficient codec than the old DD 5.1 (AC3). This allows them to allocate more bandwidth to the picture side of things.\n\nDD+ actually has a variable bit rate (up to 6.144 Mb/s) and according to Anthony Grimani (ex-Dolby) at its higher rates offers a perceived quality on a par with the lossless formats. I'm hoping that in time, as broadband speeds increase, we'll see the streaming services adopt these higher bitrates so I can stop wanting to use disc media to get the best sound from my movies. I fear that may still be some way off though.\n\nLast edited: May 19, 2022"
