        "text": "Hello\n\nMy HD Fox T2 is set to multi-channel output, and I am getting 5.1 sound (to Yamaha amp) from C4 HD and mp4 files copied to HDD.\n\nBut BBC1 HD or BBC2 HD channels only transmit in 2.0.\n\nI suspect this isn't a problem with the Humxax but with the BBC, and wondered if anyone knew anything\n\nThanks very much\n\nTony\n\nDr Who is definitely in 5.1 on satellite. I haven't recorded it on any of my Freeview-HD boxes. I will do so next time it's on. I do have one 5.1 recording on one of my HSR FOX T2's, it's the original BBC-HD Test card and 5.1 audio test broadcast from the daily demo loop.\n\nNote the audio actually transmitted and recorded is aac 2.0 or 5.1. The box transcodes to ac3 on output.\n\nThe BBC has problems with it's current 5.1 encoders with periodic audio dropouts, that may well be the reason so little content is in 5.1.\n\nI would be very surprised if the Saturday BBC2-HD broadcast of The Last Night Of The Proms isn't in 5.1.\n\nI have set both Dr Who and the Proms on a HDR FOX T2 so watch this space\n\nDr Who from satellite audio details\n\nAudio\n\nID : 4352 (0x1100)\n\nMenu ID : 1 (0x1)\n\nFormat : AC-3\n\nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3\n\nMode extension : CM (complete main)\n\nFormat settings, Endianness : Big\n\nCodec ID : 6\n\nDuration : 1h 18mn\n\nBit rate mode : Constant\n\nBit rate : 384 Kbps\n\nChannel(s) : 6 channels\n\nChannel positions : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\n\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n\nBit depth : 16 bits\n\nCompression mode : Lossy\n\nDelay relative to video : -661ms\n\nStream size : 215 MiB (6%)\n\nLanguage : English\n\nant_in_wales - 1 day ago »\n\nAs a fan of Doctor Who, I know that is only broadcasting in 2.0 to me.\n\nSo. If it's working as 5.1 for you, I wonder why it isn't for me.\n\nTransmitter? Might Blaenplwyf be the problem?\n\nMy freeview HD Dr Who audio is a mixed bag but mainly 5.1. Last weekend's Dr Who was 5.1 but the weekend before was 2.0. Both were recorded from the same HD channel, from the same transmitter, on the same Humax freeview+ HD box.\n\nTransmitter: Sudbury\n\nname: Doctor Who_20140830_1929.ts\n\nAudio #1\n\nID .................. : 6602 (0x19CA)\n\nMenu ID ............. : 17540 (0x4484)\n\nFormat .............. : AAC\n\nFormat/Info ......... : Advanced Audio Codec\n\nFormat profile ...... : LC\n\nMuxing mode ......... : LATM\n\nCodec ID............. : 17\n\nDuration............. : 48mn 51s\n\nBit rate mode ....... : Variable\n\nChannel(s) .......... : 2 channels\n\nChannel positions ... : Front: L R\n\nSampling rate ....... : 48.0 KHz\n\nCompression mode..... : Lossy\n\nTransmitter: Sudbury\n\nname: Doctor Who_20140906_1931.ts\n\nAudio #1\n\nID .................. : 6602 (0x19CA)\n\nMenu ID ............. : 17540 (0x4484)\n\nFormat .............. : AAC\n\nFormat/Info ......... : Advanced Audio Codec\n\nFormat profile ...... : LC\n\nMuxing mode ......... : LATM\n\nCodec ID............. : 17\n\nDuration............. : 47mn 53s\n\nBit rate mode ....... : Variable\n\nChannel(s) .......... : 6 channels\n\nChannel positions ... : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\n\nSampling rate ....... : 48.0 KHz\n\nCompression mode .... : Lossy\n\nThe Doctor Who series for last year was 5.1 for the ones that I looked at. I am not 100% sure but they were probably from Sudbury as well.\n\nHowever although the 3D Day of the Doctor and its repeat was 5.1, the normal HD Day of the Doctor was 2.0. These were all probably recorded from Crystal Palace.\n\ngrahamlthompson - 23 hours ago »\n\nI would be very surprised if the Saturday BBC2-HD broadcast of The Last Night Of The Proms isn't in 5.1.\n\nGoing back to 2013 Dr Who at the Proms HD was 2.0.\n\n(I probably used Crystal Palace for that.)"
