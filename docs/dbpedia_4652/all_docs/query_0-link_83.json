The white A/V output is mono and will not give you surround sound.\n\nNew member\n\nUsername: Splinter\n\nPost Number: 2\n\nRegistered: Aug-04\n\nPosted on\n\nis there any kind of adapter i can use or something because i dont want to buy another tv i just bought this one like 1 year ago its only and it is brand new\n\nGold Member\n\nUsername: Project6\n\nPost Number: 1273\n\nRegistered: Dec-03\n\nPosted on\n\nYes, that adapter is called a receiver.\n\nYou really do need something to process surround sound signals if you want it, because it is not built in to TV sets. They have Simulated Surround but, it does not even come close.\n\nSorry to say, but, a majority of TV in the mass market do not put out surround sound, unless you have one that has a built in receiver.\n\nYou can add external speakers all you want to your TV but it will not be a surround sound system, just a ghettofied version thereof.\n\nLet us say, for argument's sake, that there is an adapter. How do you think that is going to be accomplished? The signals coming out of your TV Audio output will still need to be amplified, then it needs to be distributed to the different speakers surounding your listening area.\n\nYou really don't need to buy another TV, all you need is a new receiver, so don't fret, you have some shopping to do.\n\nUnregistered guest\n\nPosted on\n\nHow can I hook up more that 5 speakers to a 5.1 surround system.

Sean, you need a receiver.\n\nAnother question. How do I hook up cable to receiver to get 5.1 or 6.1. I am using comcast cable and there is only one cable coming out of the wall.\n\nIf I use only TV I have to connect it to the TV video input. There seem to be some stero sometimes depending the program. I don't know how the sound is processed. With a received I think I have to connect the cable to an video input but where does the sound go? If the cable company broadcast a movie with 5.1 sound via that only cable wire, how can I get it to the speaker system? On the receiver the audio and video connection are totally separated.\n\nBronze Member\n\nUsername: 1st61\n\nPost Number: 14\n\nRegistered: Oct-04\n\nPosted on\n\nWell, I checked the mannual and the Video input seems to handle the work I asked in last post. it says:\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nVIDEO 1 IN/OUT & VIDEO 2 IN (24, 25, 43)\n\nThe VIDEO 1 S-Video, composite video, and audio\n\ninputs and outputs can be used to connect a VCR.\n\nThe VIDEO 2 S-Video, composite video, and audio\n\ninputs can be used to connect another video source\n\n(e.g., cable TV, satellite TV, or a set-top box).\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nIf so, do I get same 5.1 results when I watch a movie from cable company as I played a DVD on my player?\n\nGold Member\n\nUsername: Project6\n\nPost Number: 1641\n\nRegistered: Dec-03\n\nPosted on\n\nyour cable box should have a digital output capability, and even then the broadcast must also be in 5.1.

My best bet for you is to get a Cable Box from your Cable Company and then take the sound signal from the Cable Box and run the audio directly to your Phillips Stereo and the video signal from your cable box to the (yellow) video input on your t.v.. To get surround sound though, you have to have; (A): a stereo that has that feature and, (B): have a minimum of 5 speakers placed around your room... (left main, center, right main, left rear, right rear). hope that helps.\n\nUnregistered guest\n\nPosted on\n\nHey Tony or some one..since i live in a dorm we have cable but i don't think ill be able to get a cable box..Is there any way around that?

The cable tv coax must be connected directly to either the TV where the TV switches the channels, or directly to the stereo hi-fi VCR. You generally cannot hook coax to the TV from the VCR leaving the TV on channel 3, stereo rarely will pass to the TV via coax / channel 3 hookup.\n\nNew member\n\nUsername: Jum\n\nPost Number: 1\n\nRegistered: Jan-05\n\nPosted on\n\nI'm trying to figure out how to get digital/surround\n\nfrom my cable box.
