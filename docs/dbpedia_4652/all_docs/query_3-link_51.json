        "text": "My biggest gripe with this show is there are frequently instances where the dialogue of some characters is very difficult to hear and understand even when the volume is increased. It gets to the point I miss things they are saying, but then I rewind to repeat it and still have no clue what they just said. Worst offender is the doctor M'Benga. Other times it's because the sound effects are mixed too loudly and obscure the vocals slightly.\n\nMy biggest gripe with this show is there are frequently instances where the dialogue of some characters is very difficult to hear and understand even when the volume is increased. It gets to the point I miss things they are saying, but then I rewind to repeat it and still have no clue what they just said. Worst offender is the doctor M'Benga. Other times it's because the sound effects are mixed too loudly and obscure the vocals slightly.\n\nIs it last season?\n\nI would try out some of the different sound settings on your TV. I used to experience a lot of issues like this on many TV shows until I switched to a different setting, which largely resolved it for me.\n\nI have pretty good speakers (not using audio from tv) and a 5.1 surround setup using the real digital signal from the television receiver (not those fake surround modes). It could be there's too much 'surround' sound in the audio so I could try watching it in stereo to see if it makes a difference - however that kind of takes the fun out of the surround sound effects.\n\nI never had this bad of a problem with other tv shows, even when I watch the older trek reruns that are on tv every week like TNG and Voyager or shows like Stargate Sg1, all in digital surround and I never had any problems like this show. The clarity of the vocals are so much better on those shows. It's like night and day. The only other show that I occasionally have issue like this is Superman and Lois. A few times I had to rewind several times to figure out the dialogue, but nothing like Strange New Worlds.\n\nI don't know maybe it's just bad audio mixing. Heavy character accents like M'Benga's don't help much either. But yeah turning on closed captioning is a good idea.\n\nI watch on a 32 inches wide monitor from my computer with speakers attached and don't have those type of issues with SNW. I notice usually this type of thing happens when watching movies in 5.1 surround. For whatever reason, music always drowns out the actor speaking which is why I always choose 2.0 if it's available. I'm not sure why it's so hard for studios to make sure that what the actor is saying is at a higher volume than the music.\n\nWith accents, I find it helps to be around a lot of people with different accents other than your own. M'Benga's accent sounds perfectly fine to me, but then I'm frequently around people with even heavier accents or outright broken English. Otherwise, the issue may be in the sound mixing in which dialogue has to compete with music, special audio effects, and even background ambient noise.\n\nthis is a problem for tv shows in general.\n\nI've come across this sentiment more than once in recent months, and I'm beginning to wonder if it may be a consequence of the \"ear bud\" age, in which some people have played music and other audio too loud over their ear buds or headphones and may now have some difficultly with softer noises and speech. Other times, it may simply be that the device they're using to play isn't the best with soft stuff, ear buds or not...\n\nSee, this is where I get annoyed by the hypocritical Discovery haters who complained that Burnham does nothing but whisper her lines (which she doesn’t) and here in SNW, which they generally love, M’Benga LITERALLY DOES WHISPER/RASP EACH LINE.\n\nI’m also not sure what the heck Carol Kane is doing with her delivery, but I had to struggle furiously to understand her. I was looking forward to seeing her but, man, what a…strange performance so far.\n\nSee, this is where I get annoyed by the hypocritical Discovery haters who complained that Burnham does nothing but whisper her lines (which she doesn’t) and here in SNW, which they generally love, M’Benga LITERALLY DOES WHISPER/RASP EACH LINE.\n\nI’m also not sure what the heck Carol Kane is doing with her delivery, but I had to struggle furiously to understand her.
