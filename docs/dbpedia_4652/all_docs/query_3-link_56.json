        "text": "Very simply put...\n\nStereo is just left and right. Sometimes elements in stereo mixes can sound like “surround” due to unintended or intended phase differences (see Hendrix’s Electric Ladyland)\n\nQ-sound is also just left and right, but it used some “filtering” in the mix to make certain elements sound as though they are coming from outside the normal stereo soundfield. You do not need any special eqpt to hear a q-sound mix, but proper speaker set-up and listening position is really critical to hearing the surround effects properly (this is also true for phasing effects in some stereo mixes). Q-Sound was designed for speaker listening only. The surround effects are mostly list via headphones.\n\nSurround Sound can be many things. Again, simply put...it can be anything from simply doubling the stereo left and right to a pair of surround speakers (or all-channel stereo) all the way to Atmos mixes with discrete elements coming from many different speakers. In between those two are myriad possibilities including matrixed (surround channels mixed into the front channels using an encode-decode algorithm) and discrete quadraphonic, 4.1, 5.0, 5.1, 7.1 and so on. These can be delivered via vinyl LPs or fairly low quality lossy digital to hi-resolution lossless PCM and DSD digital.\n\nThe most accurate for film would be lossless, hi-rez 5.1 or 7.1 mixes or lossless Atmos mixes. Lossless 5.1 can be delivered via DSD on SACD or PCM on DVD-V/DVD-A or Bluray via LPCM, Dolby TrueHD or DTSHD MA. Dolby Atmos is generally 24/48 Dolby TrueHD on Bluray.\n\nI'll thank you for that post since no one else did."
