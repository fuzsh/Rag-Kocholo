        "text": "If you want to upgrade your TV's sound, the big choice is between the convenience and affordability of a soundbar, and the superior sound quality -- and extra cost -- of a dedicated surround-sound system. Both will enable you to experience high-quality sound, including Dolby Atmos, for your movies and TV shows. Both can also offer streaming music via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi from your phone. and may also enable control from voice assistants such as Alexa and Google Assistant. Soundbars and speaker systems both have their pros and cons, so where do you start?\n\nHere's what you need to know.\n\nHow much do you want to spend?\n\nFirst, you'll need to decide what your budget is, and how much of your living space you're willing to give up. Soundbars require less money and space, while AV surround setups take more of both. One of the main advantages of a soundbar system is that you don't need to lay out as much cash. Excellent soundbars can be had for around $100, and spending $200 or more will get you something pretty great. If you're spending over $500 on a soundbar though, you should think about separates.\n\nIt may take more time and money to assemble a separate speaker system, but the effort is well worth it. For this, you'll need at least a pair of stereo speakers ($200 and up) and an AV receiver, which will cost at least $300 on its own. The advantage to all of this is that you'll then have a platform that you can build upon and grow as your finances allow.\n\nBuying a complete 5.1-or-more speaker set may be even more expensive up front, but will give you full surround sound (with rear speakers, a center speaker for dialogue and a subwoofer for bass), and its performance will be that much richer.\n\nTL;DR: Got under $500 to spend? A soundbar is your best bet. Over $500? Get an AV receiver and decent stereo speakers, and you can upgrade over time.\n\nSoundbars\n\nIf you're just starting out, the best way to upgrade your TV sound is with a soundbar. It's simple, everything you need is included in the box and it's easy to set up. There are only a couple of cables to connect, and they don't require multiple speakers in the room.\n\nAs we discuss in our soundbar buying guide the best features to look for are Bluetooth and a HDMI-ARC or optical digital connection.\n\nSoundbar advantages\n\nAffordable.\n\nEasy to set up.\n\nSound a lot better than TV speakers.\n\nSelf-contained, so it doesn't need a separate amplifier to make it work.\n\nSome models include advanced features such as Dolby Atmos compatibility or surround speakers (or the ability to add them later).\n\nSoundbar disadvantages\n\nDon't sound as good or play as loud as a full surround-sound system, especially in big rooms.\n\nUsually can't upgrade individual components or add new surround formats.\n\nLimited features compared to a receiver.\n\nSpending more won't necessarily improve sound quality. (Soundbars can only be so big without blocking the TV.)\n\nRead more: Best Soundbars of 2024\n\nSpeakers and surround sound\n\nThere are many different brands of receivers and speaker-makers that it can be hard to know where to start. Here's a solid \"starter set\" to give you an idea of what $900 buys. First, pick your speakers and then add a receiver.\n\nEither...\n\nOr...\n\nThen add...\n\nIf you're a home theater fan, then a surround-sound system is probably what you're after. Having a 2.1, 5.1 or Atmos 5.1.4-channel setup delivers an audio experience that can't be beat by a soundbar at any price. The sound is bigger and more enthralling, an advantage that's particularly important in large rooms. For instance the Klipsch Reference Theater Pack offers a big sound from a compact system. It's on sale at Amazon right now for $399.\n\nAt the very least, you'll need a pair of stereo speakers and a receiver or integrated amp. You can also then add surround speakers, Atmos heights and a subwoofer for sound that rivals your local cinema.\n\nThough the complexity increases over a soundbar, adding a universal remote will help make the system more user-friendly for the less technical of your friends and family. If you want to know more check out our receiver buying guide, which I've summarized below.\n\nSurround system advantages\n\nBetter sound quality, including true surround effects with rear speakers.\n\nYou're no longer bound by manufacturer and can mix and match as you like.\n\nAdding height or surrounds doesn't mean necessarily buying a whole new system.\n\nVery flexible, as you can upgrade either the receiver or speakers at a later date.\n\nSurround system disadvantages\n\nCosts more than a soundbar.\n\nTakes up more space.\n\nMore complex.\n\nWires and more wires.\n\nRead more: Best AV Receivers of 2024\n\nOther alternatives\n\nPowered speakers: There are an increasing number of powered speakers designed to fill the gap between soundbars and surround systems. These can be straightforward systems like the $179 Klipsch RP-15M or more specialized offerings like the Roku Wireless speakers.\n\nHeadphones: Most TVs offer headphone jacks while newer TVs also include Bluetooth outputs to connect wireless headphones. We especially love the Roku Smart Remote which comes with a 3.5mm jack onboard for use with Roku TVs and streamers. Headphones are particularly useful for use in environments where you don't want to disturb others and they can be bought quite cheaply.\n\nWhich should you buy?\n\nIf you're looking for the simplest possible solution to improving TV sound, get a 'bar or maybe a pair of powered speakers first. There are plenty of affordable options available, and you don't need to sacrifice style for performance. The sweet spot for a soundbar is between $200 and $300, as spending any more than that doesn't guarantee improved sound.\n\nIf you're serious about sound quality though, separates are the only way to go. You can mix and match according to your needs, and it's easier to upgrade once new formats come in -- you won't need to replace everything if you want to add 8K video capability, for example.\n\nWhichever option you choose, you will never be able to go back to tinny, little TV speakers ever again. Happy listening.\n\nMore home entertainment recommendations"
