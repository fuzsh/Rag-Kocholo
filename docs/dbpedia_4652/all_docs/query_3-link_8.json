        "text": "I noticed that most of the outdoor scenes appear to be okay, it is the studio filmed stuff that had sound issues.\n\nTo me the dialogue sounds ‘boxy’, like it was recorded in a cupboard.\n\nI even tried the Disney+ version with surround on, but had the same problem.\n\n0\n\n*compares it to the last few seasons*\n\nI've zero issues, and only lost a few words during \"cross babble\" moments. The specials have not had the same issues as Chibnall's era where the mixing staff seemed to feel there was more meaning to Akinola's music than Whittaker's lines. It's a shame if the audio has not been great for you, but it honestly seems to be a \"at your end\" problem.\n\n2\n\n*compares it to the last few seasons*\n\nI've zero issues, and only lost a few words during \"cross babble\" moments. The specials have not had the same issues as Chibnall's era where the mixing staff seemed to feel there was more meaning to Akinola's music than Whittaker's lines. It's a shame if the audio has not been great for you, but it honestly seems to be a \"at your end\" problem.\n\nI'm sure it's different on different systems, but it's literally the only TV show I've ever watched where this has been a problem, even previous seasons of Who were fine.\n\nThere's clearly a different approach they've taken to sound mixing this time around that isn't working well on some systems.\n\n1\n\nI do find the music to overpower the dialogue at times. Our new Sony TV does seem to have good sound quality for everything else. I think it is something to do with if you have 5.5 sound system it is ok which is not ok for those who don’t. Having said that I do find this series sound quality better than the last series which I gave up watching.\n\n0\n\nI watched the first special on my dad's TV (no idea what his sound system is - he has a relatively modern Samsung TV with no external speakers/soundbars) and I had to put the subtitles on.\n\nLast week I was back at home and listening through headphones on my very new JVC TV (again no idea of the sound system but no external speakers/soundbars). Even with headphones, I struggled with some of the dialogue. I put it down to Murray Gold's awesome 'background' music, but maybe it was a more general mixing issue than that. I don't seem to have the issue with any other programmes, so I don't *think* it's my hearing.\n\n1\n\nIt's been an issue since the show came back in 2005.\n\nThe BBC's response is always the same: to blame the viewer and then continue to ignore the issue.\n\nIt's infuriating.\n\nThe only way I can watch is to wear headphones and have the sound hiked to very high volume, but then my ear drums will get blown out by the \"background\" music. I'm only 40 and have nothing wrong with my hearing at all but this is a problem across TV and cinema that I've struggled with for about fifteen years now. The response from those making the media is as above: blame the viewer and do nothing to try and see if things could be better on their end.\n\n1\n\nFor what its worth... ive been watching 'live' on iPlayer... and have certainly experienced the dialog problems.\n\nIt is much better on the post-broadcast stream - the one I re-watch is the UHD version of course and the sound is fine there.\n\nTonight im going to be brave and see if we can access the UHD version at 6.30 (as the international audience can with Disney) - but not expecting much.\n\n0\n\nWatched these specials on an ageing 10.5 inch Samsung tablet. No issues at all. Clear as a bell.\n\nIf you want a home cinema, you need to sort out your own sound system. Surround sound makes for issues. And if a posh TV isn't doing so well... maybe that's about the TV.\n\n2\n\nOddly, it was absolutely fine for us tonight, despite having trouble with the first two specials.\n\nSame here. Both this and last week I watched on catch-up; last week I found myself rewinding the episode a few times to get bits of dialogue, whereas this week I didn't have to do that at all.\n\n1\n\nEpisodes one and two, issues with dialogue, often too low in the mix and drowned out by sound effects and music. (The only time we’ve ever had issues with sound).\n\nEpisode three was absolutely fine.\n\nSame TV, same sound system, same settings. So something clearly changed in the way the show’s audio was mixed between episodes.\n\nSo can we stop with the usual ‘it’s your fault, your sound system is crap’ nonsense please. It’s dismissive and completely unhelpful for people who would simply like a solution.\n\n2\n\nEpisodes one and two, issues with dialogue, often too low in the mix and drowned out by sound effects and music.

It’s dismissive and completely unhelpful for people who would simply like a solution.\n\nRather than nonsense. One point, “Global” entertainment and media giant Disney is a co-producer well known for its quality, in sound and vision. It would never ever lend its name, in bold at the end to anything sub par.\n\nThe simple solution is to check your own TV. It’s a bit like the synopsis of the show, “I am right” the BBC and Disney are wrong. RTD gets that and clearly mimics real life, where social media feels the sound mixing is wrong but BBC , Disney etc feel it’s of broadcast quality.\n\nThis is a discussion forum and if a poster likes to claim sound is an issue, then they have to expect that others may not have the same experience.\n\nCounter arguments and feedback may upset those with their views but are just as valid.\n\nTo me I never had any sound issues and so my suggestion is the OP checks their TV. A valid point.\n\n2"
