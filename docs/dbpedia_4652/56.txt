Hello

My HD Fox T2 is set to multi-channel output, and I am getting 5.1 sound (to Yamaha amp) from C4 HD and mp4 files copied to HDD.

But BBC1 HD or BBC2 HD channels only transmit in 2.0.

I suspect this isn't a problem with the Humxax but with the BBC, and wondered if anyone knew anything

Thanks very much

Tony

Dr Who is definitely in 5.1 on satellite. I haven't recorded it on any of my Freeview-HD boxes. I will do so next time it's on. I do have one 5.1 recording on one of my HSR FOX T2's, it's the original BBC-HD Test card and 5.1 audio test broadcast from the daily demo loop.

Note the audio actually transmitted and recorded is aac 2.0 or 5.1. The box transcodes to ac3 on output.

The BBC has problems with it's current 5.1 encoders with periodic audio dropouts, that may well be the reason so little content is in 5.1.

I would be very surprised if the Saturday BBC2-HD broadcast of The Last Night Of The Proms isn't in 5.1.

I have set both Dr Who and the Proms on a HDR FOX T2 so watch this space

As a fan of Doctor Who, I know that is only broadcasting in 2.0 to me.

So. If it's working as 5.1 for you, I wonder why it isn't for me.

Transmitter? Might Blaenplwyf be the problem?

My freeview HD Dr Who audio is a mixed bag but mainly 5.1. Last weekend's Dr Who was 5.1 but the weekend before was 2.0. Both were recorded from the same HD channel, from the same transmitter, on the same Humax freeview+ HD box.

The Doctor Who series for last year was 5.1 for the ones that I looked at. I am not 100% sure but they were probably from Sudbury as well.

However although the 3D Day of the Doctor and its repeat was 5.1, the normal HD Day of the Doctor was 2.0. These were all probably recorded from Crystal Palace.

Going back to 2013 Dr Who at the Proms HD was 2.0.

(I probably used Crystal Palace for that.)
