Uttarakhand is a state located in the northern region of India. It was carved out of the state of Uttar Pradesh in 2000 and is also known as the Land of Gods due to its association with several Hindu pilgrimage sites.

In terms of population, Uttarakhand has a population of approximately 11 million people, according to the 2011 census. The state has an area of around 53,483 square kilometres and is divided into 13 districts. It is further subdivided into 95 tehsils and 78 blocks.

Proposed Districts of Uttarakhand

The state of Uttarakhand has been considering the creation of five new districts for over a decade. These districts would be Didihat, Kotdwar, Ranikhet, Yamunotri, and Kashipur. The proposed districts would be carved out of existing districts and would be located in both the Garhwal and Kumaon divisions of the state.

The creation of new districts would have several benefits for Uttarakhand. It would help to improve administrative efficiency, as each district would have its own set of officials and resources. It would also help to bring development to remote areas of the state, as new districts would be more likely to attract investment and government attention.

However, there are also some potential drawbacks to the creation of new districts. It could lead to an increase in bureaucracy, as each new district would need its own set of offices and procedures. It could also lead to a decrease in efficiency, as resources would be spread more thinly across a larger number of districts.

Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to create new districts in Uttarakhand is a complex one. There are both potential benefits and drawbacks to consider. However, if the state can overcome the challenges, the creation of new districts could have a positive impact on the development of Uttarakhand.

As of July 2023, there is no official announcement on the creation of new districts in Uttarakhand. However, the state government has indicated that it is considering the proposal and a decision could be made in the near future.
