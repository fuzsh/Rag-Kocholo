        "text": "The role of land reforms has been part of a grand narrative in India which talks about the rights of the marginalized. As nation trying to come out of the bondages of colonization one was also working on the internal democracy and fight against marginalisation. The role of the Congress during the independence struggle and rise of different farmer (‘kisan’) organisations is of significance. For us to get a toe hold of the land reforms we need to engage with the historical state of affairs with regards to land in India in general and Himalayas in particular. The Uttarakhand state has Garhwal and Kumaon as the two broad divisions by way of which we can look at the region. The region has been under the Nepali rulers, Britishers for a long time. The Britishers were interested in the vast forest resources of the region primarily wood in order to fuel its expansion across the country. The forest areas of the region were heavily exploited over a period of time. The Britishers gained a good footing in the Kumaon which remained an area of influence. Post independence the Uttar Pradesh state looked upon the region as a source of Hydropower and Tourist destination with little or no interest in bringing about land reforms in the region.\n\nLand which includes soil, water and associated plants and animals is a complex and dynamic combination of factors like – Geology, Topography, Hydrology, soils, Micro climates and community of plants and animals that are continuously interacting under influence of climate and people's activities. The use to which land is put is determined by owners, farmers, government institutions, etc. according to their own perception of needs. Such decisions are also influence by physical factors like soil and climate, technology and socioeconomic aspirations of community. In western Uttar Pradesh, It is observed that the total reporting area has changed in entire period from 8069224 hectare to 7300536 hectare.out of which a big proportion of 5597634 hectare (76.67%) is under net sown area followed by other land non agriculture of 833895 hectare (11.42%), forest 331872 hectare (4.55%), current fallow land 181740 hectare (2.49%), old fallow land 99931hectare (1.37%), groves and gardens 45821 hectare (0.63%), barren and un-cultivated land 112952 hectare (1.55%), cultivated waste land 83112 hectare (1.14%) and pasture land13579 hectare (0.19%). Population of the region has grown up because of easy availability of fertile land and water so the demand of land is increasing for the different use. The land use pattern of western Uttar Pradesh has changed during the entire period 2001 to 2011 Key words-Land use pattern, Barren land, Net sown area, Current fallow, pasture land Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state of the country, is situated between 23*52' and 30*24' north latitude and 77*05' and 84*38' east longitude. The state shares international border with Nepal and is bounded by the states of uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh Chhattisgarh, Bihar, and Jharkhand. Total geographical area of the state is 24,170 thousand hectare (which is 7.33% of total area of India) out of which 16,573 thousand hectare is under cultivation. Gross cropped area is 25,414 thousand ha with the cropping intensity of 153%. In Uttar Pradesh size of holding is around 0.83 ha and per capita land area is 0.14 ha, which is less than a half of the national average of 0.32 ha. Uttar Pradesh is largest producer of wheat, potato, sugarcane and milk whereas third largest producer of rice. Agriculture still constitutes the backbone of the state economy, more so, because it provides livelihood to about two-third population of the state. Western Uttar Pradesh covering an area of\n\nIn need of help 1. Livelihood of residents impacted as they depend on Tourism. Recommendation: Suggest alternative models for earning livelihood. Problem: The national media's focus on the plight of tourists has grossly distorted the true nature of the tragedy even in the Char Dham area. Many of the men who come from the villages in these valleys (and elsewhere) to earn a major part of their families' annual income on the yatra routes during the tourist season are missing and are feared dead. They help run the dhabas that line the entire 14 km trek route from GauriKund to Kedarnath; they sell raincoats, umbrellas, canes, soft drinks, water bottles, snacks and other supplies. On their backs, they carry children, the old, the infirm and tourists who are simply unfit and out of shape to walk the entire route. They run along the path with their ponies or horses carrying yatris. The tragedy of the families dependent on religious tourism for much of their annual income is compounded by the fact that the yatra season is over for the year, and is unlikely to resume even next year given the destruction of the roads and bridges in the upper reaches. Several thousand Char Dham valley families will now fall below the poverty line. Till the revival of the yatras, what will be the alternative sources of employment for the newly unemployed? Most likely we will see increased male outmigration from the region. Solution: Eco-tourism: Instead of herding millions of tourists along the yatra routes, the number of daily visitors to the shrines ought to be limited, as has been done for the Gangotri glacier trek at Gaumukh. Safe facilities can be developed for these limited numbers. Nature tourism can be encouraged taking advantage of scenic locations and tourists can be dispersed throughout the state. Nature lovers prefer trekking through forests and will happily forgo motorable roads right up to their destinations. Community-based tourism: where local families host visitors and their youth act as guides, introducing the guests to scenic locations, local history, culture and foods can replace massive hotels and resorts. Uttarakhand and other Himalayan states have several functioning models of this approach. Employment: Simultaneously, it is also necessary to reskill local people for non-farm employment. Uttarakhand has successful examples of mini dairies that sell milk through women's federations, business process outsourcing (BPO) ventures employing rural youth and CSOs that train people to repair mobile phones, make solar lanterns and photovoltaic panels. There is a growing need for tradesmen like electricians and plumbers in addition to the traditional ones like masons, carpenters or blacksmiths. Even traditional tradespersons need to polish and articulate their entrepreneurial skills in order to improve their earnings. Mahila Mandals or Van Panchayats can plant, own and manage forests to provide rural women with fuelwood and fodder at their doorsteps, recharge drying springs and streams, stabilise mountain slopes and provide a variety of minor products that can feed new local industries where the men can find employment instead of migrating to the plains in search of jobs. This is what the women of Uttarakhand had hoped for when they led the agitations for a separate mountain state.\n\nThe argument of hand to hand Rural-Urban development is always the key focus of development policy of any government who desire to place her nation in the club of developed countries. In India though many developmental programs started right after the independence but still there are sound disparities amongst Rural and Urban areas which severely affect her image in the HDI and other growth indices. Any type of disparity is very harmful for any nation, as in long run these disparities cause various socioeconomic problems and also results in formation of anti national sentiments. The state of Uttrakhand is a distinct geographical entity in the Western Himalayas because of so many socioeconomic and geographical considerations. At the time of independence, considerable difference in economic and social development of different regions of the country existed. One of the main objectives of the planning process initiated in the early 1950s was to reduce these regional differences and to achieve, regionally balanced development. Various policy instruments including direct public investment by the Union Government in infrastructure, guided private investment and building up of capacity enhancing institutions have been tried to achieve this objective. These policies were continued during the first three decades of planning. Though these measures were not highly successful, they ensured that disparities were not getting aggravated during this period. With the initiation of economic reforms in the early 1980s which culminated in full-fledged deregulation, liberalization and globalization in the early 1990s, the role of the government in investment decisions has diminished. Present paper discusses the types of Disparities prevailing in India, discussing social, political and economic factors causing disparities, effects of disparities reflected in factors like literacy, income, employment and labour rate participation, further it discusses about its impact on investment and growth rate on short and long term and finally critically examining the factors responsible for migration of labour force from rural areas to urban areas and the solution to prevent this migration with reference to Uttarakhand."
