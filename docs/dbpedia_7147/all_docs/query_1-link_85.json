        "text": "Over the last 30 years, forests nearly two-thirds the size of Haryana have been lost to encroachments (15,000 sq km) and 23,716 industrial projects (14,000 sq km), according to government data. Artificial forests cannot be replacements, as the government recently acknowledged.\n\nThe government’s auditor has said conditions under which these projects are given forest land are widely violated, and experts said government data are under-estimates.\n\nCurrently, up to 25,000 hectares of forests - 250 sq km, or more than twice Chandigarh’s area - are handed over every year for “non-forestry activities”, including defence projects, dams, mining, power plants, industries and roads, the government recently told parliament. The rate of “diversion”, as the process is called, varies across states.\n\nPunjab has diverted about half its forest land since 1980, compared to Maharashtra, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu, which diverted less than one per cent of their area.\n\nThe rise is explained by planted trees, particularly as monocultures, which do not replace the diverse, natural forests that are permanently lost.\n\nIndia’s forests increased over the last 13 years, according to data from Indian State of Forest Reports. Such increases are an “outcome of statistical jugglery and the use of flawed definitions by India’s forest bureaucracy”, the Economic Times commented in 2012.\n\n“Compensatory afforestation” is the term used to describe the trees that must be planted as compensation for forests cut down, which requires special permission from the ministry of environment and forests.\n\nExperts criticised compensatory afforestation as an “unscientific” and “flawed concept”. The loss of forests is not a loss of trees alone but the collapse of an ecosystem, said Samarpita Roy, PhD scholar in environmental science from Pune University.\n\nThe government may claim planted trees compensate for forests lost, but that does not mean complex flora and fauna destroyed have been restored, said Roy.\n\nOf 14,000 sq km of forests cleared since 1980, 6,770 sq km were planted anew, or afforested, according to the latest government data. As the second part of this series will reveal, the process of afforestation is faltering, with no more than six percent of a fund set aside for the purpose used.\n\nIn April 2016, the government admitted to parliament that compensatory afforestation cannot substitute for natural forests. “Compensatory afforestation is undertaken to minimise the loss of impact of forest diversion in due course of time,” a government statement said."
