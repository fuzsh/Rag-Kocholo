It was their private property before conversion. Garhwal was captured by the Gorkhas in 1804 and was ruled by them for twelve years. But the Gorkhas were driven out by the British in 1920. The British used this forest for timbers. Teak was also grown in the forest. Now the National Park preserves endangered species of Indian Wildlife.\n\nThe Park and its surroundings were famous for the exotic wildlife and scenic beauty several years ago. In the 19th century, under the guidance of Major Ramsay, the project to save the famous regions of the forests started. This British officer was appointed as the In-charge of that area during that particular time. The first step to preserve this area was taken in the year 1868. These forests were converted into Reserved Forest Area in 1879 and only limited felling was permitted.\n\nIn the earlier part of 1900, the ideation behind the setting up of a National Park was suggested by the British like E.R. Stevans and E.A. Smythies. Therefore, in 1907 the British Administration took initiative for establishing an entertainment reserve. Under the supervision of Sir Edward Jim Corbett, the process of separating the well known areas started in the year 1930, as he was familiar with the place.\n\nIn 1935, under the governor of the province, Sir Macolm Hailey, the act of National Park came into effect. It was the first National Park in Asia and was formerly known as Hailey National Park. After the independence, during the period of 1952 to 1957, the park was named as Ramganga National Park. It was again renamed as Jim Corbett National Park as a tribute to Sir Edward Jim Corbett, in the year 1956. Hunting was forbidden in the area and permission was granted for cutting of timbers for domestic use only.\n\nThe year 1973 added another golden day in the history of Corbett when Jim Corbett National Park became India's first Tiger Reserve and was regarded as the launch pad for protecting tigers in India.\n\nGenerally people think this site official website of Corbett tiger reserve.
