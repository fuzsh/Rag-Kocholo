        "text": "You know it’s very confusing to know what is the standard unit of measuring land. I see people measuring land in hectares, square meters, square feet and even square yards. So, I searched online and found out that in almost all the countries, hectare is the standard unit of measuring land as it is accepted by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures.\n\nThe International System of Units which was adopted in 1960 had adopted square meter as the standard unit of measuring land.\n\nNow what is the standard unit of measuring land area in India, well there are many. You can check out the list below:\n\nUnits Units Units Bigha Ankanam Chatak Biswa Cent Decimal Biswansi Ground Dhur Killa Guntha Kattha Ghumaon Kuncham Lecha Kanal - -\n\nThe standard unit of measuring land may differ from one state to another. So it can be a little tough to keep a track of the same. But don't worry I am here to help you in understanding which is the standard unit of measuring land. I will tell you about what is standard unit of measuring land in different states but first, let us look at some of the commonly used measuring units.\n\nCommonly used standard units for measuring land across India are:\n\nSquare feet (sq ft.)\n\nSquare yards (sq yd)\n\nSquare kilometers (sq km)\n\nAcre\n\nHectare\n\nHere are the state wise measuring units for your reference. In a country like India, each location has its own unit of measurement for land.
