It is part of the US customary unit and imperial unit.\n\nThis unit of measurement is used in the following countries:\n\nIndia\n\nUnited States\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nCanada\n\nBangladesh\n\nPakistan\n\nNepal\n\nHong Kong\n\nGhana\n\nSingapore\n\nMalaysia\n\nSquare metre\n\nSquare metre, also known as sq. m, or m2 is like square feet; however, the sides of the square in this case are 1 metre (3.28084 foot). It is the SI derived unit used to measure area that can be converted to all types of area units using our land area calculator tool.\n\nSquare yards\n\nSquare yards, sq. yd. or yd2 can be defined as the area of a square with sides measuring 1 yard (3 foot). This unit has been replaced by square metre.\n\nHowever, it is still in use in the following countries:\n\nIndia (as gaj)\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nUnited States\n\nCanada\n\nHectare\n\nHectare or ha can be defined as the area of a square with sides measuring 100 metres. It is the only unit in use within SI even though it is a non-SI unit.\n\nHectare is primarily used for the measurement of large areas of land like forests, agricultural plots, etc. The European Union primarily uses this unit.\n\nWith an area unit converter, you can convert hectare into acre, bigha, sq. m, sq. ft. and more.\n\nBigha\n\nBigha is traditionally used in India when measuring plots. The unit has no standard size. Size on one bigha can equal 1,500 to 6,771 sq. m. the unit can equal 12,400 sq. m in some places. Biswa and katha are the subunits of bigha. These units also don’t have a standard size.\n\nThe size of one bigha in few Indian states equals –\n\nWest Bengal – 1,600 sq. yd. (standardised during British Raj)\n\nUttarakhand – 756.222 sq. yd\n\nAssam – 14,400 sq. ft\n\nAn online area converter can be used to convert bigha to sq. ft., sq. m, hectare or acre and vice versa.\n\nAcre\n\nAcre is part of the imperial US customary units. One acre equals 4,840 sq. yd. or 0.405 hectare. 640 acres make 1 mile.\n\nAcre is primarily used in the United States and the United Kingdom. It is also used in countries under former British Colonial rule. In India, acre is primarily used to measure agricultural land.\n\nA land area converter can convert measurements of acre into sq. ft., sq. m. and other units.\n\nGuntha\n\nGuntha or gunta is primarily used to measure plots in Northern India. In India, 40 gunthas make 1 acre. Also, 1 guntha equals 1,089 sq. ft.\n\nGround\n\nGround is unit of measurement in India. 1 ground equals 203 sq. m. Then the unit is more commonly used in the realty sector.\n\nBiswa\n\nBiswa is a unit with no standard size throughout the country. Commonly, 1 biswa equals 1,350 sq. ft. In Uttar Pradesh, 1 bigha equals 10 kaccha biswa and 10 pucca biswa.\n\nKanal\n\nKanal is most used in Northern India. 1 kanal equals 1/8th of an acre or 4,500 sq. ft. or 605 sq. yd.\n\nAcre\n\nAcre is a unit of the metric system. 1 are equals 0.0247 acre or 100 sq. m. 100 acres equal 1 hectare. Are was replaced by hectare during the rationalisation of the metric system back in 1960.\n\nA land measurement converter can be used to convert between any of the units mentioned above.\n\nUsing a land converter is uncomplicated; you only must select one unit in the first window and the other in the second.
