        "text": "A state of mountainous northern India, Uttarakhand is known for its spectacular natural environment. It is bounded on the northeast by the Tibet Autonomous Region of China and on the southeast by Nepal. The Indian state of Himachal Pradesh lies to the northwest, a tiny portion of Haryana lies to the west, and Uttar Pradesh is to the west and south. One of India’s newest states, what is now Uttarakhand was part of Uttar Pradesh until 2000. The new state was at first named Uttaranchal.\n\nUttarakhand has an area of 19,739 square miles (51,125 square kilometers) and is sparsely populated. Most of its people live in rural areas. The capital and largest city is Dehra Dun.\n\nThe state has a highly varied terrain, with snow-covered peaks, lakes and glaciers, deep canyons, lush river valleys, and a few patches of dusty plains in the south. Lying in the Himalayas, northern Uttarakhand has some of India’s highest mountains. Among them is Nanda Devi, which at 25,646 feet (7,817 meters) is the country’s second highest peak. The upper reaches of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers flow southward through the state. Much of the land is forested. A number of parks and wildlife sanctuaries have been established to protect the state’s rich array of plant and animal life. The Valley of Flowers and Nanda Devi national parks together form a UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\nUttarakhand has a temperate climate. Temperatures vary seasonally and by elevation, with the mountainous north much colder than the southeast. The state receives roughly 60 inches (150 centimeters) of annual precipitation, most of which falls during the monsoon season.\n\nMany different ethnic groups live in Uttarakhand. A large portion of the population consists of Rajputs, various clans of landowning rulers and their descendants. Among them are members of the indigenous Garhwali, Gujjar, and Kumauni communities. The official state language is Hindi, but Hindustani, which combines words from both Hindi and Urdu, is the main spoken language. More than four fifths of the people are Hindu, and about a tenth are Muslim. Many Hindu pilgrims come to Uttarakhand to visit its shrines and temples, some of which are among the holiest in Hinduism. The state also has an important Sikh shrine and pilgrimage site, Hemkund Sahib.\n\nLess than a fifth of the land in this mountainous state is useful for growing crops. Nevertheless, most of the workforce is engaged in agriculture. The major crops include wheat, rice, millet, and sugarcane. Many farmers raise dairy cattle, goats, or sheep. Manufacturing in Uttarakhand expanded rapidly after it became a state. Processed foods, wood and paper items, cement, pharmaceuticals, and automobiles are produced. Service industries, especially tourism and information technology, account for more than half of the state’s income.\n\nThe governor, who serves as head of state (a largely ceremonial post), is appointed by India’s president. The chief minister heads the Council of Ministers. The state has a one-house legislature.\n\nThe early residents of what is now Uttarakhand included a number of tribes. The Paharis were the dominant group until the Rajputs and high-caste Brahmans moved into the area in about the 13th century."
