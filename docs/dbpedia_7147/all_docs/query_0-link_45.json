This helps a lot with making plans, policies, and evidence-based decisions. India’s forests are as diverse as its culture, from the tall evergreen trees in the Western Ghats to the thick jungles in the Northeast.\n\nIn this article, we’ll look into the forests of India, learning about why they’re important, what’s being done to protect them, and the problems they’re up against.\n\nTotal Forest Cover in India 2023\n\nAs of 2023, the total forest cover in India was approximately 715,292 square kilometers, which accounts for around 21.54% of the total geographical area of the country. This data is based on the India State of Forest Report (ISFR) released periodically by the Forest Survey of India (FSI), Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India.\n\nForest Cover in India State Wise\n\nState/UTs details of Forest Cover as per ISFR 2021\n\n(Area in square kilometre)\n\nS.

The following lists their significance:\n\nClimate change mitigation: Forests absorb carbon dioxide, one of the major greenhouse gases. This helps control the environment and prevent global warming.\n\nWater Security: Forests are an important part of the water cycle. They collect rain, control its flow, and prevent flooding. Groundwater sources are also restored.\n\nSoil conservation: Tree roots bind soil particles together, limiting wind and rainfall. This is especially important given that much of India’s territory is vulnerable to desertification.\n\nBiodiversity: A variety of plants and animals, including many endangered species, find a home in the forest. They are necessary to preserve ecological unity.\n\nLivelihood: Millions of people in India depend on forest income, especially those living in tribal communities. Non-timber forest products (fruits, berries, medicinal plants), fuelwood and timber are provided.\n\nTourism: Forests are popular tourist attractions that generate income and employment in the tourism industry.\n\nClean Air: As biogas filters, forests purify pollutants and release oxygen. Maintaining clean air is important, especially in cities.\n\nWhat is the India State of Forest Report?\n\nThe Forest Survey of India (FSI) prepares the biennial India State of Forest Report (ISFR). FSI is an entity under the jurisdiction of the Indian Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change.\n\nInformation regarding India’s forest cover is included in the study. It contains information on species composition, forest cover changes over time, tree density, and forest area.\n\nData on the amount of mangrove cover, increasing stock, and carbon stock in forests are also included in the study.\n\nHow has India’s Forest Cover Changed Over the Years?\n\nIndia’s forest cover grew from 19.53% in the early 1980s to 21.71% in 2021. The 2021 State of Forests Report for India:\n\nThe country’s forest and tree cover grew by 2,261 square kilometres, or 0.28%, since the latest assessment in 2019, according to the study.\n\nIn total, 80.9 million hectares of forest and tree cover covered India, making up 24.62% of the nation’s land area.\n\n7,13,789 sq km, or 21.71% of the country’s total area, are covered by forests.\n\nThe percentage of the country’s land covered by trees is 2.91%.\n\nAccording to the study, forests covered more than 33% of the land in 17 States and Union Territories.\n\nKey Findings of the India State of Forest Report 2021\n\nThe following list includes some of the noteworthy features from the India State of Forest Report 2021:\n\nForest Cover\n\nThe states with the most forest cover in the nation in terms of area:\n\nMadhya Pradesh,\n\nArunachal Pradesh,\n\nChhattisgarh,\n\nOdisha, and\n\nMaharashtra.\n\nAccording to the percentage of total land area covered by forests, the top five states are:\n\nMizoram,\n\nArunachal Pradesh,\n\nMeghalaya,\n\nManipur, and\n\nNagaland.\n\nMangrove Cover\n\nIndia’s mangrove area grew by 17 square kilometres in 2019 over the previous estimate.\n\n4,992 square kilometres make up India’s total mangrove cover.\n\nBamboo Cover\n\nSince the last evaluation in 2019, India’s bamboo-bearing area has grown by 39,454 million culms (stems).\n\n53,336 million culms of bamboo are found in India’s entire area under cultivation.\n\nStates with Highest Increase in Forest and Trees\n\nThe country continues to have a growing amount of trees and woods. There has been an increase in the area by 1,540 square kilometres throughout the past two years.\n\nFrom 67% in 2019 to 7,13,789 Sq.km (21.71% of the country’s geographical area), India’s forest cover has grown.\n\n“Tree cover” is the collective name for all tree patches less than one hectare that is found outside of the officially recognised forest area. This holds for dispersed trees as well as all other tree shapes.\n\nMore trees currently cover 721 square km.\n\nThe states with the largest increases in forest cover are Odisha (1.04%), Telangana (3.07%), and Andhra Pradesh (2.22%).\n\nFive Northeastern states—Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Nagaland—have seen a decline in their amount of forest cover.\n\nForests that are Prone to Fire\n\nForest fires can occur in 35.46% of India’s forested area. Out of them, 7.85% are very highly prone, 11.51% are very prone, and 2.81% are extremely prone.\n\nBy 2030, increasing temperatures and a changing climate will affect 45–64% of India’s forests.\n\nCarbon Stocks\n\nIt is predicted that 7,204 million tonnes of carbon are stored in the nation’s forests. Since 2019, there has been an increase of 79.4 million tonnes.\n\nThe amount of carbon stored in the forest ecosystem after being removed from the atmosphere is known as the forest carbon stock.\n\nThe soil and living biomass are often where the sequestered carbon is kept.\n\nTo some extent, though, it is also kept in the form of trash and dead wood.\n\nThreats to India’s Forest Cover\n\nIndia’s woods are under several dangers, both natural and man-made. A look at the main offenders is as follows:\n\nDeforestation is the permanent removal of trees to create room for mining, agriculture, and the construction of infrastructure (roads, dams). This may or may not be lawful.\n\nLand Degradation: Unsustainable activities that cause desertification include overgrazing by cattle and excessive fuelwood harvest. These actions can lower the quality of forests.\n\nClimate Change: The forests of India are suffering from rising temperatures, unpredictable rainfall patterns, and a rise in the frequency of catastrophic weather events like wildfires.\n\nIllegal Activities: Poaching, industrial encroachment, and illegal logging by the “timber mafia” are a few examples of unlawful activities that lead to the loss and degradation of forests.\n\nPolicy Issues: It may be challenging to conserve forests due to conflicting regulations and lax enforcement measures.\n\nEach of these risks has a cascading impact. Deforestation and degradation lead to biodiversity loss, ecological imbalance disruption, and increased susceptibility to droughts and floods. This might start a vicious cycle and exacerbate the impacts of climate change.\n\nConservation Initiatives and Policies for Forest Protection\n\nTo save forests and preserve ecological balance, the Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change (MoEFCC) established new regulations in 2022.\n\nThese guidelines supersede previous ones from 2003.\n\nThey concentrate on creating committees to oversee projects and carry out conservation work.\n\nA project screening committee reviews projects that might include the exploitation of forest land. It advises state governments on initiatives and has frequent meetings.\n\nThe committee examines the location of proposals and verifies that they are complete.\n\nReview periods vary depending on the project and might be anywhere from 60 to 150 days.\n\nThe committee comprises a district collector and a forest conservator, under the direction of a nodal officer.\n\nA further body called the Advisory group provides recommendations to the Central Government on matters related to forest conservation.\n\nBy the rules, regional offices also create Regional Empowered Committees.\n\nProjects that require approval from regional offices must include the use of up to 40 hectares of forest area or be linear, such as roads and highways.\n\nCompensatory afforestation, or CA, is required when forest land is used for uses other than forest production. Companies must provide alternative land or rebuild damaged areas by reforesting them.\n\nThe resolution of disputes about forest rights and land diversion is currently the responsibility of the states.\n\nIn less serious circumstances, environmental regulation violations may result in fines rather than jail time.\n\nThe Indian Penal Code addresses grave offences including causing significant harm or death.\n\nPenalties for infractions of the Environment Protection Act, particularly those about single-use plastic, are upheld by the regulations.\n\nAn Environment Protection Fund will get a part of the penalties that are collected.\n\nThe Environment Protection Act of 1986, which gives the Central Government the authority to guard the environment, stop pollution, and control industry, is one of the most significant environmental laws and regulations.\n\nWith community involvement, the National Afforestation Programme seeks to recover damaged wood.\n\nAiming to expand the amount of forest cover, the India Forest Policy of 1952 established rules for both the preservation and use of forests.\n\nIt divided woods into four categories: Village woods, National Forests, Protection Forests, and Treelands. Each category had a distinct function.\n\nGovernmental Efforts to Encourage Forest Cover\n\nThe GoI has launched several initiatives to promote forest conservation and its management.\n\nNational Mission for a Green India\n\nThis is one of the eight missions included in the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC).\n\nIt was introduced in February 2014.\n\nNational Afforestation Program (NAP)\n\nIt has been applied to the reforestation of degraded forest regions since 2000.\n\nThe MoEFCC implemented the program.\n\nCompensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA)\n\nThis was introduced in 2016.\n\n90% of the fund will go to the states, while the remaining 10% will be held by the centre.\n\nNational Action Programme to Combat Desertification\n\nThis was implemented in 2001 by the Ministry of Environment, Forestry, and Climate Change.\n\nThis was launched to address the concerns of rising desertification and to take necessary initiatives.\n\nGreen India Mission\n\nIt is a centrally sponsored scheme.\n\nIt aims to increase forest and tree cover in the nation and improve the quality of forest ecosystems.\n\nThe mission focuses on increasing forest cover in 5 million hectares of forest and non-forest lands.\n\nJoint Forest Management\n\nIt’s a project for community-based forest management. Local people are involved in the management and conservation of forests through this programme. It aims to:\n\nPromote the sustainable use of forest resources.\n\nEnsure the participation of local communities in forest conservation.\n\nRelated Reads\n\nConservation of Forest and Wildlife in India\n\nForest\n\nTypes of Forests in India\n\nFAQs on Forest Cover of India\n\nWhat is the total forest cover in India?\n\nThe total area covered by forests and trees in the nation is 24.62%. 7,13,789 sq km, or 21.71% of the country’s total area, are covered by forests.\n\nWhat is India’s current forest cover?\n\nAccording to the most recent ISFR 2021, the nation’s total forest cover is 7,13,789 square kilometres, or 21.72% of its total land area.\n\nWhich Indian forest is the most extensive?\n\nTropical dry deciduous trees come after tropical wet deciduous trees.
