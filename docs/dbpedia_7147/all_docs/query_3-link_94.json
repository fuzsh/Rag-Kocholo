        "text": "Unit Quantity Code (UQC) is a uniform measuring unit used by the department for measuring quantity in the returns filed. UQCs are used to maintain consistency and prevent variations in quantities in the returns filed by different businesses. This requires the businesses to measure the quantities of items using the UQC from the list given by the department.\n\nUsing Tally.ERP 9, you can map your unit of measurement to the UQC given by the department, and file the returns. This can be done in the UoM master as well as in the Map UoM-UQC report, which allows you to map all the UoMs at once. In case an item has more than one UoM, and thus linked to multiple UQCs, you will have to select the reporting UQC for such items to report in GST returns.\n\nTo map UoM to UQC\n\n1. Go to Gateway of Tally > Display > Statutory Reports > GST > Map UoM - UQC .\n\n2. Select the UoM that has to be mapped to its UQC, and click S : Map to UQC .\n\n3. Select the right UQC from the predefined list.\n\n4. Press Enter to map. Similarly, you can map each UoM to the right UQC.\n\nThe list of Unit Quantity Code provided by the department does not have the representative code for brass, carats, litres, running foot, and so on. Based on your business requirement, map the unit to the related UQC. For example, you can map litres to KLR-KILOLITRE. Before filing, change the quantity in the hsn worksheet of the template, or CSV file. Examples of mapping units to the related UQCs with the conversion factors are given below:\n\nReporting UQC\n\nSelecting the report UQC for an item, in case it has mulitple UQC's linked, is also made easy in Tally.ERP 9.\n\nTo select the reporting UQC for an item\n\n1. In the Map UoM - UQC report, click U : Update RUQC .\n\n2. Select an item and click A : Map to RUQC .\n\n3. Select the reporting UQC (RUQC) from the list.\n\n4. Press Enter to map the stock item to its RUQC.\n\nThe quantities of the selected stock item will be reported using the RUQC chosen in the GST returns.\n\nButtons\n\nF1 : Detailed - Use this button to view the information in the report in the detailed mode.\n\nF5: Show All / Show Unmapped : Use this button to toggle between unmapped UoM or all UoMs in the report.\n\nSetting UQC after Upgrade\n\nWhen you are upgrading from an earlier version of Tally.ERP 9 to Release 6.1, a message is displayed to inform you about the need to map your UoMs to the UQC. You can directly go to the Map UoM - UQC report to start mapping by pressing Enter ."
