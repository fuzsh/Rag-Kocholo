        "text": "History\n\n‘The year that was and what the future holds’\n\nDr. Col. Alok.C.Khanna President\n\nRetired Army Medical Officers would occasionally catch up and mull over how they can give back to society. These meetings became more regular and soon took a new form giving life to what we know today as HIMAID. HIMAID is short for HIMALAYA INFORMATION MEDICAL ASSISTANCE INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT. As a first step the group decided to help people in the nearby remote areas of Uttarakhand. HIMAID Society was registered on 22 Jan, 2017. The team then went on to conduct numerous surveys to get a sense of where the proposed medical services would have the most impact.\n\nIt was finally decided to work in the Tehri district, 140 Km from Dehradun, Uttarakhand\n\nThese medical clinics provide a full array of medical services previously unavailable in this region. Our family of supporters provide help in many ways, including donations of time, services, goods and money. HIMAID has an ongoing survey in 50 villages covering an approximate area of 35 km to create a baseline health data bank.\n\nIn August of 2019 HIMAID initiated the GAME CHANGERS program, a woman’s only social initiative dedicated to having workshops with women in villages on mental health, menstrual hygiene, personal health and social interactions.\n\nHIMAID is equipped to organize medical treks for healthcare professionals and others to remote villages to provide multi-day clinics. Our organization prides itself on being small and efficient; donations made through HIMAID go to people in the remote rural Himalayan who most need this support.\n\nUttarkhand “A glimpse into the Land of the Gods”\n\nUttarakhand, formerly known as Uttaranchal is a state in the northern part of India. It is often referred to as the \"Devabhumi\" (literally \"Land of the Gods\")due to numerous Hindu temples and pilgrimage centres found throughout the state. Uttarakhand is known for the natural environment of the Himalayas, the Bhabar and the Terai regions. It borders the Tibet Autonomous Region of China to the north; the Sudurpashchim Pradesh of Nepal to the east; the Indian states of Uttar Pradesh to the south and Himachal Pradesh to the west and north-west. The state is divided into two divisions, Garhwal and Kumaon, with a total of 13 districts. The winter capital of Uttarakhand is Dehradun, the largest city of the state, which is a rail head. Gairsain, a town in Chamoli district is the summer capital of Uttarakhand. The High Court of the state is located in Nainital.\n\nArchaeological evidence supports the existence of humans in the region since prehistoric times. The region formed a part of the Uttarakuru Kingdom during the Vedic age of Ancient India. Among the first major dynasties of Kumaon were the Kunindas in the 2nd century BCE who practised an early form of Shaivism. Ashokan edicts at Kalsi show the early presence of Buddhism in this region. During the medieval period, the region was consolidated under the Katyuri rulers of Kumaon also known as 'Kurmanchal Kingdom'. After the fall of Katyuris, the region was divided into the Kumaon Kingdom and the Garhwal Kingdom. In 1816, most of modern Uttarakhand was ceded to the British as part of the Treaty of Sugauli. Although the erstwhile hill kingdoms of Garhwal and Kumaon were traditional rivals, the proximity of different neighbouring ethnic groups and the inseparable and complementary nature of their geography, economy, culture, language, and traditions created strong bonds between the two regions which further strengthened during the Uttarakhand movement for statehood in the 1990s."
