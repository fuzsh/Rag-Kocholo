This entails assessing distances, angles, and positioning these 3D points on the Earth's surface from any location. Surveyors, professionals skilled in engineering, trigonometry, law, mathematics, physics, and geometry, employ this approach to create land maps and boundaries recognized by the government.\n\nGunter's Chain, a historic example, utilized chains of specific length (66 ft, 100 links) for land measurement. Invented in 1620 by Edmund Gunter, an English mathematician, it became a standard unit for land measurement, influencing English-speaking countries like the United Kingdom, United States, and Canada.\n\nThe history of area measurement units can be traced back to the Indus Valley civilisation, where such units of measure have been recorded in our nation’s architecture, metallurgical artefacts, and even folk tales. The term ‘ratti’ from the Sanskrit term ‘raktika’ for example, can be still found in our daily usage of Hindi and Urdu, tracing its origin in measuring the weight of seeds during Akbar’s Mughal regime. Across several empires trying out different measurement units, it was on October the 1st, 1958, when the Government of India adopted the SI or the International System of Units, where:\n\n1 metre = 1,000 millimetres\n\n1 acre = 100 square metres\n\n1 hectare = 100 acres\n\nDespite the diversity of languages, cultures, and religions, what remains the standardized unit for land measurement among modern Indian citizens? Moreover, various measures and constraints are implemented to conserve and protect lands crucial for agroforestry, agriculture, polycultures, and food forests. As a potential future homebuyer, how can you ascertain a fair deal when different land units, such as \"bigha\" (in several northern states of India) and \"kuncham\" (in Andhra Pradesh), are understood by different people?\n\nSo, while you now understand why the land reform measures were necessary, it is time to familiarise yourself with both the standard and regional units of land measurement.\n\nAlso read: Land Survey Number: Verify Land Ownership Details Easily\n\nLand Area Measurement Units Across India\n\nWhile we already know about the metre, hectare, acres etc. already in some native language or the other (a ‘yard’ as per the land measurement scale, for example, is also known as ‘gaj’ in Hindi), it is important to know clearly how they stack up against each other.\n\nStandard Land Measurement Units in India\n\nSo how do these standard units measure in terms of land size details?\n\nAcre (ac): This is a conventional system internationally used to measure land size with the symbol ‘ac’.\n\nHectare (ha): This is a unit of land size that equals 10,000 sq. m. or 107,693 sq. ft. or 1 square hectometre (100 m x100 m), commonly used in legal and survey documents such as sale deeds, planning, as well as used as agricultural land measurement units\n\nSquare foot (sq. ft.): This is a unit of measurement that is equal to 144 square inches.\n\nLet’s look at what converted property measurements of an area look like:\n\nHere you must also understand the difference between the terms ‘ground’ and ‘plot’. While many may have the general question about the measure of 1 plot of land in square feet in India, the reality is that a ‘plot’ is nothing more than a piece of land. For land measurement in English therefore, you can have a plot with different sq. ft. sizes, whereas a ‘ground’ refers to a land that measures exactly 2,400 sq. ft. in size. This is why land measurement formulas and documents always provide the measurement of land in ‘ground’ or ‘sq. ft.’.\n\nAlso read: How To Convert Agricultural Land to Residential Land in India?
