        "text": "Hectare (symbol ha) is the metric unit of area that equals a square with 100 m side (1 hm2) or 10,000 square meters. The term hectare is introduced in French, from the Latin area.\n\nIt is primarily used throughout the world to measure the area of a large section of land. One hectare equals 2.471 acres.\n\nEven though there are different metric units for land measurement, the hectare is most commonly used. The International Committee for Weights and Measures has categorized hectares as a 'non-SI unit accepted for use with the international system of units. Among the geographies, land measurement is most commonly used in Australia, Burma, Canada, the European Union, India, the US, the UK, etc.\n\nHectare can be converted into different metric units used to measure large areas of land. Here, we will discuss the conversion of a hectare to the acre, hectare to square meter, hectare to bigha, hectare to biswa, etc.\n\n(Image will be uploaded soon)\n\nHectare to Acre\n\nHectare is a commonly used unit of area in the metric system and is equal to 100 ares, or 10000 square meters, and is equal to 24.71 acres in the British Imperial system and United State customary measure. The symbol used to represent hectare is ‘ha’.\n\nAn acre is the unit of land area used in the imperial and US customary system. It is defined as the area of one chain by the area of a furlong (66 by 660 feet) which is exactly equivalent to 20 square chains, or 1/640 of a square mile, or 43.560 square feet, and 4047 square meters, or about 40% of a hectare. The symbol used to represent acre is ‘ac’.\n\nHectare to the acre is the conversion of measurement from ha to acre value. One hectare is equal to 2.471 acres.\n\nA hectare unit can be converted into acre value by multiplying the hectare unit by 2.471. For example, to convert 5 hectares to acres, the calculation is:\n\n5 ha = 5 2.471 or 12.355 ac.\n\nTherefore, 5 hectares is equal to 12.355 acres.\n\nAcre to Hectare\n\nAcre to hectare is the conversion of measurement from acre to hectare value. One acre is approximately equivalent to 0.404686 hectares.\n\nAn acre unit can be converted into hectare value by multiplying the acre unit by 0.404686. For example, to convert 5 acres to the hectare, the calculation is\n\n5 ac = 5 × 0.404686 or 2.02343 ha\n\nTherefore, 5 acres is equal to 2.02343 hectares.\n\nHectare to Bigha\n\nA hectare can be defined as the unit of area in the metric system equal to 100 acres of 10,000 square meters whereas bigha is a term used for agricultural land measurements in many Indian states like Assam and Uttar Pradesh.\n\nHectare is considered to be extremely valuable as it helps us understand agricultural output and crop production appropriately. But it is important to understand how to convert hectares into bigha as farmers widely use bigha units. The value of Bigha differs from one state to another state. But generally, 1 bigha falls in the range of 1/3 to 1 acre or approximately equal to almost 1/8 to (2/5)th hectare.\n\nHectare to bigha is the conversion of measurement from ha to bigha value. In a state like Uttar Pradesh, the value of 1 hectare is equal to 6.1772 bighas.\n\nA hectare unit can be converted into bigha value by multiplying the hectare unit by 6.1772. For example, to convert 5 hectares to bigha, the calculation is\n\n5 ha = 5 × 6.1772 or 30.886 Bigha\n\nTherefore, 5 hectares is equal to 30.886 bighas in UP.\n\nHectare to Square Feet\n\nHectare and square feet is a unit of area used in the Imperial and US customary system to measure an area of land. One hectare is equal to 107,639 sq ft.\n\nHectare to square feet is the conversion of measurement from ha to sq ft.\n\nA hectare unit can be converted into sq ft by multiplying the hectare unit with 107,639.\n\nFor example, to convert 5 hectares to sq ft, the calculation is\n\n5 ha = 5 × 107,639 or 538196 sq ft\n\nTherefore, 5 hectares is equal to 538196 Bigha in UP.\n\nCent to Hectare\n\nA cent is a customary unit of measure used in some parts of Southern Indian states such as Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, and Tamil Naidu despite the general use of metric units for other instances.\n\n1 cent is defined as an area of 1/100 of an acre (40.5 m2; 435.6 sq ft).\n\nCent to hectare is the conversion of measurement from a cent to hectare.\n\nA cent can be converted into hectares by multiplying the cent unit by 0.0040468564224.\n\nFor example, to convert 5 cents to ha, the calculation is\n\n5 cent = 5 × 0.0040468564224 or 0.02023 ha\n\nTherefore, 5 cents is equal to 0.02023 ha.\n\nMeters to Hectare\n\nMeters or square meter is the SI derived unit of area. It is widely used while purchasing or selling large plots of land. The symbol used to represent square meters is m2. One square meter is 0.0001 hectares.\n\nMeters to hectare is the conversion of measurement from m2 to ha.\n\nA square meter (meter) can be converted into hectares by multiplying the square meter value by 0.0001 or divide by 10000.\n\nFor example, to convert 5 square metres to ha, the calculation is\n\n5 square metre = 5 × 0.0001 or 0.0005 ha\n\nTherefore, 5 m2 is equal to 0.0005 ha.\n\nKanal to Hectare\n\nA Kanal is the traditional unit of land area used in northern parts of India and Pakistan. In India, Kanal is equivalent to 4500 square feet or one-eighth of an acre. In Pakistan, different values of Kanal exist in different areas. A Kanal is generally considered equivalent to 5400 square feet in Pakistan, but it is equal to 4500 square feet in Lahore.\n\nTo convert Kanal to the hectare, one needs to remember that 1 Kanal is equal to 0.0505857 hectares.\n\nThe unit Kanal can be converted into hectares by multiplying the Kanal value by 0.0505857.\n\nFor example, to convert 5 kanals to ha, the calculation is\n\n5 kanal = 5 × 0.0505857 or 0.252929 ha\n\nTherefore, 5 kanals is equal to 0.252929 ha.\n\nHectare to Biswa\n\nA biswa is the unit of measurement of the area of land used in northern states of India such as UP, Haryana, Uttarakhand, and Himachal along with bigha to represent the shorter land of units.\n\nHectare to Biswa is the conversion of measurement from hectare to Biswa. To convert ha to biswa, one needs to remember that 1 hectare is equal to 79.07372209 biswa (in UP).\n\nA hectare unit can be converted into biswa by multiplying the hectare value by 79.07372209.\n\nFor example, the calculation to convert 5 hectares to biswa is\n\n5 hectare = 5 × 79.07372209 or 398.66334876703 biswa\n\nTherefore, 5 hectares is equal to 398.66 biswa in UP.\n\nFun Facts\n\nThe renowned island in Italy (Venice) has 41,400 hectares of land.\n\nIn London, the O2 Arena covers 10.4 hectares of ground.\n\nIn Scotland, Loch Ness is 5600 hectares in surface area.\n\nAccording to the 2019 survey, around 0.9 billion hectares are suitable for reforestation.\n\nSolved Example\n\n1. Convert 230 hectares to square meters.\n\nSolution:\n\nAs we know,\n\n1 hectare = 107,639 square feet\n\nTo convert 230 hectares into square feet, we will multiply 230 by 107,639.\n\nThe calculation is\n\n230 hectares = 230 × 107,639 = 24,76,870 sq feet.\n\nHence, 230 ha is equal to 24,76,870 sq feet.\n\n2. Convert 20 hectares to acres.\n\nSolution:\n\nAs we know,\n\n1 hectare = 2.471054 acres\n\nTo convert 20 hectares into acres we will multiply 20 by 2.471054.\n\nThe calculation is\n\n20 hectares = 20 × 2.471054 = 49.42108 acres.\n\nHence, 230 hectares is equal to 59.42108 acres."
