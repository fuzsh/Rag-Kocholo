        "text": "Since the formation of Uttarakhand state in 2000, it has lost thousands of hectares of forest land to fires. Forest fires are commonly seen in this state during the summer season. Forest fire is a major threat and reason responsible for the degradation of Western Himalayas and its atmosphere.\n\nFires are categorized into three forms i.e. Natural fires, Intentional fires and Unintentional fires. Natural fires play a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance in the forests. Intentional fires are used for promoting the better growth of grass while the unintentional fire occurs due to the carelessness of humans such as throwing of match stick or cigarettes buds in the open area. In India, all the forest fires are due to careless human activity.\n\nUttarakhand state has total area of 53,483 and a forest area 38,000 square kilometres. According to the Forest department of Uttarakhand, 71% of the total area is covered with different type of forests. Chir pine is the most dominant forest plant in the state, equivalent to 16.15% of the total forest cover. As it easily catch fires, making them more prone to fires. Forest fires have become a regular feature during the summer season in Uttarakhand. Every year, due to these forest fires there is a huge loss to entire ecosystem, flora and fauna and economical wealth. Forest fire is one of the major disasters in the forests of Uttarakhand. Natural fires are certainly not common in this state while 50 percent of forests are more prone to fires due to human activity. Due to its hilly mountainous terrain, it is difficult to control the fire.\n\nFigure 1 Forest Map of Uttarakhand\n\nFire occurs mostly in the summer season known as ‘Fire season’ (15 Feb- 15 June). The most sensitive district prone to forest fires are Pauri-Garhwal, Nainital, Almora, Rudraprayag, Chamoli, Pithoragarh, Tehri and Dehradun and the most vulnerable areas are Pine forests which comprise 28.72% of State total forests.\n\nAccording to Forest department of Uttarakhand, this is the data of forest burn land with respective to the following years:-\n\nYEAR LAND ( in hectares) 1998 2,000 1999 60,000 2000 2,320 2001 1,144 2002 3,494 2003 4,983 2004 4,750 2005 3,652 2007 56,244 2008 1,595.35 2012 1,409 2016 4048 2018 3399\n\nAs the data mentioned depicts the large land owing to forest burns destroying forest properties worth several hundred thousand.\n\nAccording to 2019 Forest fire report,\n\nFire breaks out in the region of Tehri Garhwal district on May 11, 2019. The fire included all the 13 districts of Uttarakhand computing to total 1493 incidents. This resulted in Rs. 35.41 lakhs loss in terms of forest property. Almora and Nainital were worst affected areas with 297 and 289 incidents.\n\nIn the short term, forest fires consume vegetation, woods and organic matter. It kills animals that are unable to escape the fires and further increases the air pollution in the affected areas. While in the long term, soil productivity is altered and also biodiversity changes.\n\nForest fires affect globally as due to the release of carbon material leads to global warming. Fires have been an important function in maintaining the health of ecosystems, but due to misuse of fire it has been a threat to the forests and its biodiversity.\n\nMeasures taken by Uttarakhand government for prevention of forest fires are as follows:\n\nApproval of District Fire Management Plan\n\nThe fire management plan is the establishment of a comprehensive document comprising fire management strategy, resources available, logistics, crew stations, communication system etc in a comprehensive manner.\n\nRestriction of the leaves of forest officials in the forest fire season.\n\nPromotion of community participation in management and prevention of forest fires.\n\nAwareness programs are promoted for generating interests among people for the prevention of forest fires.\n\nRotational burning of Forest floor litter\n\nFloor litter and combustible matter is burned in control manner employed to manage forest.\n\nGeneration of awareness among community to support the department in prevention of forest fires\n\nConstruction of Watch towers\n\nWatch tower is elevated tower used to monitor larger section of forest for any incident of fire or smoke.\n\nEfficient Fire fighting tools\n\nDespite the various preventive measures there are still constraints that come in way of effective and efficient management for forest fires:\n\nPaucity of budget is responsible for poor infrastructure and tools.\n\nDue to change in lifestyle of the villagers, they are least interested in dousing the forest fires.\n\nUncertainty and untimely distribution of financial assistance to village communities creates mistrust issues among the villagers.\n\nAs the fire season collides with tourist season, able bodied persons are not available in the villages.\n\nLack of funds for fire prevention measures has been a major cause for forest fires in spite of the best efforts for fire management and prevention.\n\nAccording to a recent report, this Covid-19 lockdown has been exerting a positive impact on the forests of Uttarakhand. Due to lockdown and frequent rains in the fire season this year, the forest fires have been reduced as compared to last year. Most of the fires in the forests are due to man-made mistakes. But this year due to lockdown movement of public is restricted; forest fires have been negligible so far. With this frequent rains have also been helpful in prevention and spreading of fires. Both these have a cumulative effect in preventing the forest fire this year.\n\nFigure 2 Forest fire comparisons\n\nAs we can interpret from this graph that how much the fires have been reduced from last year. It’s almost negligible as compared to 2019.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Uttarakhand_forest_fires\n\nForest fire risk modeling in Uttarakhand Himalaya using TERRA satellite datasets (2017), Suresh Babu K.V., Arijit Roy & P.
