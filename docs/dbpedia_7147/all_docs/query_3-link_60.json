        "text": "Context:\n\nRecently on the World Environment Day (5 June), Chief Minister of Uttarakhand announced that his stated would be the first state to introduce the Gross Environmental Product (GEP)\n\nMore in the news:\n\nThe environmental degradation in the state has gone beyond the acceptable limit over the past few decades, making it prone to disasters and incurring huge losses to humanity.\n\nGEP is all about periodically evaluating the status of the environment by measuring the growth of natural resources.\n\nThe forest and environment department of Uttarakhand will be in charge of implementing GEP\n\nThe department will work with any institution in the state which defines the norms that will then be evaluated by a competent authority before being adopted.\n\nThe government is developing the formula based on a 2018 report commissioned by the state’s Directorate of Economics and Statistics.\n\nIt provides economic estimates for as many as 21 ecosystem services from the forest area of Uttarakhand and their contribution to the state’s GDP.\n\nThe report was prepared by the Indian Institute of Forest Management (IIFM), Bhopal.\n\nGross Environment Product\n\nGEP: Although GEP does not have a standard definition accepted by all, International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN – see inset) defines GEP as the total value of ecosystem product and services produced by a region in a given unit time. It is a measure of progress while keeping sustainability in the mind.\n\nCommittee for GEP: The Uttarakhand government has set up a committee to formulate the criteria for measurement of GEP under the Principal Secretary of the Forest and Environment Department of Uttarakhand.\n\nMeasurement of GEP: Currently, the Committee is in the process of identifying indicators for the measurement of GEP. However, an environmentalist, Mr Anil Joshi has given the following four pillars for the measurement of GEP:\n\nForests: They can be measured as per the quality and quantity of trees and the changes in the forest for a particular year. For e.g. tree density can be measured by having a look at the canopy of the forest.\n\nWater: There are two aspects of measurement of water as a natural resource. Firstly, the quantity of water can be measured by Annual Precipitation and storage (giving an idea of water runoff). Secondly, the quality of water in a waterbody can be measured by looking at the turbidity and pH value of the water in the waterbody.\n\nSoil: Quality of soil can be measured by analysing the acidity and the presence of nutrients in the soil.\n\nAir: Various indices have been developed by the government to measure the quality of air by measuring the pollution in the form of particulate matter as well as harmful gases. The same can be used for the measurement of GEP.\n\nNeed for GEP\n\nLimitations of Conventional Indices: Indices like Gross Domestic Product (GDP) are unable to measure basic indicators of sustainability like waste generation, pollution in the pursuit of economic growth as well as the inequality existing in the society. Therefore, they have an inherent disadvantage, prompting the formulation and the use of other indices like GEP.\n\nMeasurement of Economic Services: The ecosystem provides humans with multiple benefits contributing to human progress as well as environmental stability. For e.g., a tree provides fruits, timber, fodder, shelter to humans as well as other animals, apart from producing oxygen, regulating water, improving soil quality, fixing atmospheric nitrogen and regulating floods. There is a need to place economic value on these services for awareness regarding the importance of the ecosystem.\n\nAnthropological Pressure on the Ecosystem: Many projects for the human welfare are not really in consonance with the overall sustainability of the natural resources. For e.g., thermal power projects exploit the natural resources in a way which will lead to the depletion of reserves and scarcity for the coming generations.\n\nDisaster Management: Uttarakhand has been subject to disasters like flash floods and landslides due to its fragile topography, which can be attributed to the young Himalayan mountains. Therefore, there is a need to prevent further deterioration of the environment to ensure further disasters do not recur, at least due to anthropological reasons.\n\nPolicy Formulation: Forest area accounts for almost 71% of Uttarakhand’s geography. Yet, they contribute hardly 2% to the state’s GDP. Thus, they are manifestly under-utilized in the economic progress of the state. Armed with such data, the state government can ensure optimum utilisation of resources by formulating appropriate policies.\n\nGreen Bonus: Uttarakhand plays an important role in the survival of wildlife and ensuring the continued existence of biodiversity in the country. This is manifest in the presence of Rajaji wildlife sanctuary and Jim Corbett National Park, among others. Similarly, it plays an important part in the Himalayan river system by being origin of the Ganga and Yamuna rivers. Many experts claim that this entitles Uttarakhand to a ‘Green bonus’ for maintaining the aforesaid resources in the interest of the nation."
