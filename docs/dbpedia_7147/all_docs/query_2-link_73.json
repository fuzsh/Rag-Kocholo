        "text": "Introduction:\n\nThere is definitely something magical about the Kumaon region of Uttarakhand which has attracted, down the years, many great scholars, poets, artistes or other aesthethically and spiritually inclined people such as Mahatma Gandhi,Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore, Sri Aurobindo, Mahadevi Verma and of course, “Nritya Samrat” Uday Shankar. It was due to Uday Shankar’s love for this hill region that people like Guru Dutt and Zohra Sehgal spent time in Kumaon, learning dance from him. Uday Shankar was the pioneer of modern dance in India and a world renowned dancer and choreographer, who had a deep admiration for Kumaon and set up his “dream cultural centre” in Simtola near Almora in 1938.It was called “Uday Shankar India Cultural Centre.”\n\nCulture of Uttarakhand/Kumaon:\n\nUttarakhand houses seven different ethnic groups, having as many as seven different cultures. Some of the important ethnic groups that form a part of the culture of Uttarakhand are:\n\nJaunsari.\n\nBhotia.\n\nBuksha.\n\nTharu.\n\nRaji.\n\nThe people of Uttarakhand are also known as Garhwali or Kumaoni and are divided into following two Indo-Aryan groups :\n\nThe original Khas tribes (that arrived in the hills in the Vedic Age), and\n\nMigrants from North-Central India (that settled in the Medieval Period).\n\nKumaoni Culture:\n\nKumaon is one of the most culturally rich region of not only of Uttarakhand but of India too.Whether it is traditional attire like Pichoda or Dance forms like Chholiya or Decorative art form like Aipan, Kumaoni culture is well known for its rich heritage, traditions and rituals.\n\nThe Kumaoni culture is immersed in folklores and tales of innumerable gods and goddesses. There is not a river of a mountain that is not associated with one folktale or another.\n\nPeople:\n\nThe inhabitants of Kumaon are called as Kumaonis and the language spoken by them is called Kumaoni too. The society in Kumaon is a Patriarchal with the eldest malein the family as the head. The womenfolk, however hold importance in the society as they are integral part of workforce, working in the fields as well as doing householdwork.\n\nLanguage:\n\nKumaoni is one of the 325 recognized language of India and is spoken by around 3 million people in India and has around 20 dialects including Danpuriya,Gangola, Johari,Khasparjiya,Soryali, Majh Kumaiya, Askoti, Chaugarkhyali, Phaldakoti,Sirali, Kumaiya, Rauchaubhaisi and Pachhai.\n\nHowever the area and people speaking Kumaoni are shrinking rapidly and it has been included in UNESCO’s Atlas of the World’s languages in danger.\n\nFolk Dances:\n\n· Chholiya (popular dance in Kumaon region. It is the oldest folk-dance of Uttarakhand has its origin in the warring Khasiya kingdom when marriages were performed at the points of swords)\n\n· Jagars (falls in the category of ghost and spiritual worship in the form of folk songs and at times combined with dance and there are more than 50 ballads on indigeneous spirits).\n\n· Bajuband (folk song of love and sacrifice between the shepherds)\n\n· Khuded (folk songs depict sufferings of woman due to separation from her husband)\n\n· Chhura (folk songs sung by shepherds in the form of advice given by old to youngsters)\n\n· Chhapeli (the dance a duet depicts the joys of beauty,love and romance)\n\n· Chancheri ( a collective dance of kumaon by men and women ina semi circle to a slow tempo)\n\n· Jhora ( a community dance performed at the coming of spring mostly at fairs but also to celebrate weddings)\n\n· Thali,Jadda and Jhainta (Thali is graceful dance of women, jadda and jhainta are dances by both men and women)\n\nGod and Goddesses:\n\nThe region of Kumaon is full of folklores about gods and goddesses, including the local gods and war heroes who have taken the form of gods to the people now. Almost every place in Kumaon is connected with a god or goddeses and a great story around it. The popular gods are Airy, Haru, Gwala or Golu Devta, bholanath,Gangnath, Chaumu,Nagnath, Narsingh etc. The goddesses include Naina Devi probably the most famous diety of the region and a name for goddess Parvati. The goddess Nana is supposed to be diety from which goddesses Naina Devi originated.\n\nArchitecture and Sculpture:\n\nKumaon region is famous for its architectural style as well as sculptural beauty of its temples which is seen in the temples of Jageshwar, Dwarahat,Baijnath,Katarmal,Kasni and Champawat.\n\nFairs and Festivals:\n\nKumaoni people by nature, are very fond of festivities and frolic, hardly missing a chance to celebrate something together. Some important celebrations are:\n\no Uttarayani Mela\n\no Nanda Devi Mela\n\no Jageshwar Fair: Jageshwar is counted as one of the 12 Jyotirlingas in the country and has 12 temples belonging to Lord Shiva. Fairs are held at Jageshwar twice in a year.\n\no Bhitauli: Is a festival named after the the gifts that the brothers send to their sisters and starts on the first day of Navratri.\n\nProposal:\n\nIt is proposed to build a Cultural Centre in Pithoragarh to showcase and to protect ancient rich culture of Kumaon.\n\nJustification:\n\n(a) Bringing Communities Together: As technology like the internet makes the world feel more connected, more and more people are becoming interested in kumaoniculture in addition to wanting to share their own. Hence a Cultural Centre in Pithoragah willbring communities together.\n\n(b) Pithoragarh One of The Biggest District: Areawise Pithoragarh is 03rd largest district of Uttarakhand with an approximate area of 7100 square kms. In terms of literacy it is 4th highest literate district with 86.25% literacy rate. As per 2011 census the total population of Pithoragarh was 483,489 (413,834 urban and 69,605 rural population). Despite all the potential the district of Pithoragarh lacks cultural infrastructure and learning facilities.\n\n(c) Opportunity To Harness Local Talent And Career Opportunity: Classes and cultural events at Cutural Centre would bring numerous volunteer opportunities thus bringing people closer and making them feel good apart from providing chance to spot and polish abundant local talent lying untapped among folk singers, dances and among exponents of local musical instruments. Besides it could also open a career opportunity for many people.\n\n(d) Promotion Of Local Culture And Traditions: The gradual decline in interest of residents in local culture, traditions and dialect could be prevented and revived by virtue of setting up a cultural centre.\n\n."
