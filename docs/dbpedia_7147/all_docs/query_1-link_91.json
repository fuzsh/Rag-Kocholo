        "text": "Uttarakhand is mainly known for lying in the laps of the Himalayas, the Bhabhar and the Terai. Uttarakhand has a total area of 5.3 million hectare, of which 93% is mountainous and 64% is covered by forest. According to the 2011 census of India, Uttarakhand has a population of 10.1 million. The population density of the state is 189 people per square kilometer having a 2001â€“2011 decadal growth rate of 19.17%. Like most of India, agriculture is one of the most significant sectors of the economy of Uttarakhand. Basmati rice, wheat, soybeans, groundnuts, coarse cereals, pulses, and oil seeds are the most widely grown crops. Table 1 illustrates the current area, productivity and production statistics of major crops in Uttarakhand.\n\nNutrient consumption in Uttarakhand in the past decade is given in Fig. 2. Fertilizer consumption in Uttarakhand at 162.8 thousand MT of nutrients during 2013-14, witnessed an increase of 6.7% over the previous year. The consumption of total fertilizer nutrients increased both in Kharif 2013 and Rabi 2013-14 over the corresponding seasons of the previous year. Kharif : Rabi share in total fertilizer consumption changed from 53:47 during 2012-13 to 52:48 during 2013-14.\n\nDuring full year 2013-14, consumption of N and P2O5 increased and K2O declined. The consumption of N at 132.2 thousand MT and P2O5 at 24.1 thousand MT during 2013-14 recorded increase of 9% and 1.3% respectively, over 2012-13. The consumption of K2O at 6.5 thousand MT declined by 12.6% during the period. NPK use ratio changed from 16.3:3.2:1 during 2012-13 to 20.3:3.7:1 during 2013-14. The per hectare consumption of total fertilizer nutrients declined from 134.7 kg to 143.8 kg during the period. Using the area and production of major crops, the total nutrient (N, P2O5 and K2O) removal by each crop was calculated and a nutrient balance sheet was prepared (table 2).\n\nTable 1: Latest Crop Production Statistics of Uttarakhand -2012-13\n\nParametersRiceWheatMaizeTotal CerealsGramTotal PulsesTotal FoodgrainsTotal OilseedsSugarcane Area262.8358.128870.60.561931.632.2109.9 Production579.8858.240.21776.5-51.31827.739.76784.8 Productivity22062396143720408308411962123561736\n\nArea ('000 ha); Production ('000 tonnes); Productivity (kg/ha); # Production and Productivity in 1000 bales of 180 kg each\n\nTable 2: Nutrient balance sheet for major crops of Uttarakhand (2012-13)\n\nCropArea (in '000 ha)Production (in '000 tonnes)\n\nNutrient Removal (kg/tonne)\n\nTotal Removal (tonnes)\n\nNP2O5K2ONP2O5K2O Rice\n\n262.8\n\n579.8\n\n20.1\n\n11.2\n\n30\n\n11653.98\n\n6493.76\n\n17394\n\nWheat\n\n358.1\n\n858.2\n\n24.4\n\n8.6\n\n32.8\n\n20940.08\n\n7380.52\n\n28148.96\n\nMaize\n\n28\n\n40.2\n\n8.2\n\n3.1\n\n15.5\n\n329.64\n\n124.62\n\n623.1\n\nTotal Pulses\n\n61\n\n51.3\n\n40\n\n5\n\n20\n\n2052\n\n256.5\n\n1026\n\nTotal Oilseeds\n\n32.2\n\n39.7\n\n54\n\n14\n\n46\n\n2143.8\n\n555.8\n\n1826.2\n\nSugarcane\n\n109.9\n\n6784.8\n\n1.7\n\n0.2\n\n2\n\n11534.16\n\n1356.96\n\n13569.6\n\nTotal removal by major crops\n\n48653.66\n\n16168.16\n\n62587.86\n\nTotal fertilizer consumption in Uttarakhand\n\n121290\n\n23780\n\n7440\n\nConsumption * Efficiency factor\n\n48516\n\n7134\n\n5208\n\nBalance/Deficit\n\n-137.66\n\n-9034.16\n\n-57379.9\n\nEfficiency of N=40%; P2O5= 30%; and K2O=70%\n\n*Crop production and fertilizer use data are retrieved from Fertiliser Statistics, 2013-14, The Fertiliser Association of India, New Delhi"
