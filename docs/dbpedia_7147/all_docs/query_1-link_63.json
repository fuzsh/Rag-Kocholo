Open- Jeep Safari is done here which is surely very exciting and fun-filled activity. It is an opportunity for an animal lover to enjoy the wilderness and unique landscape of the jungle. Established in 1983, Rajaji National Park came into existence after merging with 3 prominent wildlife sanctuaries: Chilla, Motichur, and Rajaji of Uttar Pradesh. Rajaji National Park is spread over 820.42 Sq. Km of Shiwalik bio-diversity. Jungle Safari in Rishikesh starts from Chilla. The Safari lasts for about 2-3 hours in which the Jeep takes you deep into the jungle through a rough and rugged terrain.\n\nThere are as many as 12 National Park and Wildlife Sanctuaries in Uttarakhand that covers about 13.8% of the total area.\n\nWe believe that stepping outside of ourselves and encountering new perspectives fosters profound and positive change. Our students settle into the daily life of the host community.\n\nLocation: Rishikesh, Uttarakhand\n\n24/7 Service: We respect your necessity and hence gives room service round the clock.\n\nHealth Facility: Your good health is our responsibility and so we provide infirmary and doctor on your one call."
