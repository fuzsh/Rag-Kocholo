The name Mussoorie is said to come from 'mansoor', a shrub that grows here. Sir George Everest, who helped the British measure the height of the world's highest mountain peak Mount Everest (later named after him), is the town’s most famous former resident. After the British rule ended, Mussoorie became popular when Indian personalities, including political leaders, authors, artists and Bollywood superstars, made Mussoorie their home.

It is one of the 51 shaktipeethas (devotional shrines where the severed body parts of Goddess Sati fell) in the country. According to legend, Goddess Sati immolated herself in her father's yagya fire, when he insulted her husband Lord Shiva by not inviting him to the yagya. Bereaved and enraged, Shiva carried the body of Sati and performed tandav (a dance of cosmic destruction). To stop him from annihilating the entire universe, Lord Vishnu severed the body of Sati in 51 parts with his chakra. Some body parts of Sati are believed to have fallen at this spot and thus it is considered as a shaktipeetha.\n\nSir George Everest House and Laboratory (eight kilometers from Mussoorie) is also known as Park Estate. This popular house was from where Sir George Everest helped the British measure the height of the world’s greatest peak, Mt Everest. For his contribution, the peak that was earlier called Peak XV, was named after him.

Though for those who like wispy winters and snowfalls, Kausani is a treat at any time of the year.\n\nKausani registered its place in history as more than just an average hill station when in 1929, Mahatma Gandhi came to stay for 14 days at the Anasakti Ashram and titled Kausani as 'Switzerland of India'. He was in the process of writing his book Anasakti Yoga when he visited here. This book is a Bhagwat Gita treatise. Another famous personality associated with Kausani is the popular Hindi poet Sumitra Nandan Pant, who was born here. A number of famous poems written by Pant were inspired by the natural beauty and vibrancy of this breathtaking place\n\nGetting There: By Air: The nearest convenient airport is Pantnagar, which is 167 kilometers away.

Nestled between the Nar and Narayan mountain ranges and sprawled along River Alaknanda, Badrinath is home to some of the most impressive peaks of the Garhwal Himalayas, including the majestic Neelkanth peak.\n\nAccording to ancient texts, there are many spots of pilgrimage in heaven, earth and the world, but there has been none equal to Badri (as it is popularly called), nor shall there be. Dedicated to Lord Vishnu, the Badrinath Temple is one of the most important pilgrimage sites in India. It is among the four holy places or char dham, which are much revered by Hindus. Devotees undertake a strenuous journey through the mighty Himalayas to reach this holy shrine.\n\nThe Badrinath Temple is built to resemble a cone with a small cupola of a gilt bull and spire. There are several stories tracing their origin to the Vedic age, but popular opinion suggests that it was Guru Adi Shankaracharya who established it in the 9th century. It is divided into three sections - the garbha grih or sanctum sanctorum, darshan mandap or puja hall and sabha mandap where devotees assemble. The present structure is said to have been built by the kings of Garhwal. One will find the idol of Lord Badrinath, also called Badri Vishal, with two arms lifted up, holding the shankh (conch) and the chakra. Two of his arms rest on his lap in the yogamudra. Made in black stone, the main idol of Lord Vishnu is seen sitting in meditation. The temple also houses idols of mythical bird Garuda, Lord Narayan's vehicle, Adi Shankaracharya, Swami Desikan and Shri Ramanujam.\n\nHow To Get Here By Air: Around 317 kilometers away is the Jolly Grant Airport near Dehradun. Flights from several major Indian cities land here. By Road: The major cities of north India are well-connected to Badrinath. One can use buses that ply regularly from Delhi, Haridwar and Rishikesh to Badrinath. By Train: The Rishikesh Railway Station is 297 kilometers away while Kotdwar Railway Station is at a distance of 327 kilometers.\n\nNear Badrinath\n\nMana (on the Indo-Tibetan border) lies along River Saraswati, amid the snow-capped Himalayas. The village is inhabited by Indo-Mongolian tribes, called Bhotias, who are mainly involved in the cultural activities of the Badrinath Temple. Home to several caves including the Vyas cave, where it said Veda Vyas dictated the Mahabharata to Lord Ganesha,\n\nNeelkanth is one of the major peaks of the Garhwal Himalayas, Standing at an height of 6,507 meters (21,348 feet), the snow-clad mountain peak rises just above the Badrinath Temple and is popularly known as the Garhwal Queen. Because of its pyramidical shape, devotees travelling to the Badrinath Temple believe that the mountain gives the impression of Lord Shiva sitting on the cliffs, which is also why it has been named after the lord. The first rays of the sun falling on Neelkanth Peak is a spectacular sight. Famous English mountaineer, Frank Smythe, described the Neelkanth Peak as second only to Siniolchu (in Sikkim) in Himalayan beauty. The 10-kilometer Neelkanth trek is one of the best trekking trails in Uttarakhand.\n\nBrahma Kapal (two kilometers from the hills of Badrinath) holds special importance for Hindus as it is believed to be the place where people pay homage to the souls of their ancestors. The last rites of beloved elders are also performed at Brahma Kapal, a flat platform on the banks of River Alaknanda. All the necessary materials required to perform the last rites of elders are easily available at nearby shops. It is believed that Lord Brahma resides at Brahma Kapal because of which the departed souls get salvation from the cycle of birth and death when their family members perform their last rites or shraddha karma here. You can find several pundits (priests) sitting here with samagri (materials) to perform the rituals.\n\nNanda Devi\n\nNanda Devi (near Badrinath and the Tibetan border, 340 kilometers north of Nainital) is the second highest mountain in India after Kangchenjunga, the highest mountain located entirely within the country and the 23rd-highest peak in the world. Standng at an elevation of 7,816 meters (25,643 feet), it was considered the highest mountain in the world before computations in 1808 proved Dhaulagiri to be higher. It was also the highest mountain in India until 1975 when Sikkim, The state in which 8,586 meter (28,169 foot) Kangchenjunga, the world’s third highest mountain, is located, joined the Republic of India.\n\nWhat makes Nanda Devi particularly spectacular is that it is approached through the Rishi Ganga gorge, one of the deepest in the world. Nanda Devi is part of the Garhwal Himalayas, and is located in Chamoli district of Uttarakhand, between the Rishiganga valley on the west and the Goriganga valley on the east. The peak, whose name means \"Bliss-Giving Goddess\", is regarded as the patron-goddess of the Uttarakhand Himalaya. In acknowledgment of its religious significance and for the protection of its fragile ecosystem, The peak as well as the circle of high mountains surrounding it—the Nanda Devi sanctuary—were closed to both locals and climbers in 1983. Nanda Devi National Park and nearby Flowers National Park are a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nNanda Devi is a two-peaked massif, forming a two-kilometer-long (1.2-mile) -high ridge, oriented east-west. The western summit is higher, and the eastern summit, called Nanda Devi East, (locally known as Sunanda Devi) is the lower one. The main summit stands guarded by a barrier ring comprising some of the highest mountains in the Indian Himalayas, twelve of which exceed 6,400 meters (21,000 ft) in height, further elevating its sacred status as the daughter of the Himalaya in Indian myth and folklore. The interior of this almost insurmountable ring is known as the Nanda Devi Sanctuary, and is protected as the Nanda Devi National Park. Nanda Devi East lies on the eastern edge of the ring (and of the Park), at the border of Chamoli, Pithoragarh and Bageshwar districts. [Source: Wikipedia]\n\nTogether the peaks may be referred to as the peaks of the goddesses Nanda and Sunanda. These goddesses have occurred together in ancient Sanskrit literature (Srimad Bhagvatam or Bhagavata Purana) and are worshipped together as twins in the Kumaon, Garhwal and as well as elsewhere in India. The first published reference to Nanda Devi East as Sunanda Devi appears to be in a recent novel (Malhotra 2011) that has the Kumaon region as backdrop.\n\nNanda Devi is also notable for its large, steep rise above local terrain. It rises over 3,300 meters (10,800 ft) above its immediate southwestern base on the Dakkhini Nanda Devi Glacier in about 4.2 kilometers (2.6 mi), and its rise above the glaciers to the north is similar. This makes it among the steepest peaks in the world at this scale, closely comparable, for example, to the local profile of K2. Nanda Devi is also impressive when considering terrain that is a bit further away, as it is surrounded by relatively deep valleys. For example, it rises over 6,500 meters (21,300 ft) above the valley of the Goriganga in only 50 kilometers (30 miles)\n\nNanda Devi National Park\n\nNanda Devi and Valley of Flowers National Parks were designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1988. According to UNESCO: “The Nanda Devi National Park is renowned for its remote mountain wilderness, dominated by India's second highest mountain at 7,817 meters and protected on all sides by spectacular topographical features including glaciers, moraines, and alpine meadows. This spectacular landscape is complemented by the Valley of Flowers,\n\nAccording to The Nanda Devi National Park is one of the most spectacular wilderness areas in the Himalayas. It is dominated by the peak of Nanda Devi, which rises to over 7,800 meters. No people live in the park, which has remained more or less intact because of its inaccessibility. It is the habitat of several endangered mammals, especially the snow leopard, Himalayan musk deer and bharal.\n\nThe park lies in Chamoli district, within the Garhwal Himalaya. It comprises the catchment area of the Rishi Ganga, an eastern tributary of Dhauli Ganga which flows into the Alaknanda River at Joshimath. The area is a vast glacial basin, divided by a series of parallel, north-south oriented ridges. These rise up to the encircling mountain rim along which are about a dozen peaks, the better known including Dunagiri, Changbang and Nanda Devi East.\n\nThe Nanda Devi and Valley of Flowers National Parks are exceptionally beautiful high-altitude West Himalayan landscapes with outstanding biodiversity. Both parks contain high diversity and density of flora and fauna of the west Himalayan biogeographic zone, with significant populations of globally threatened species including the snow leopard, Himalayan musk deer and numerous plant species. Covering 71,210 ha, these two parks are surrounded by a large buffer zone of 514,857 hectares which encompasses a wide range of elevation and habitats. This entire area, located within the Western Himalayas Endemic Bird Area (EBA), supports significant populations of mountain ungulates and galliformes that are prey to carnivores such as the snow leopard. Nanda Devi National Park, with its wide range of high altitude habitats, holds significant populations of flora and fauna including a number of threatened mammals, notably snow leopard and Himalayan musk deer, as well as a large population of bharal, or blue sheep. Abundance estimates for wild ungulates, galliformes and carnivores within the Nanda Devi National Park are higher than those in similar protected areas in the western Himalayas.”\n\nValley of Flowers\n\nValley of Flowers (between Badrinath and Nanda Devi National Park) lies at an impressive altitude of around 11,000 feet with the majestic Zanskar range in the background. Designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site along with Nanda Devi National Park in 1988, the valley becomes an artist's canvas with a flood of colors amidst snow-capped mountain peaks and glistening white glaciers. The valley is located between the conversion point of the Himalayan ranges, Zanskar and the Western and Eastern Himalayas and is formed by the Pushpawati stream. In August and September, the valley comes alive when thousands of flowers are in full bloom. Besides popular species of ferns, dwarf iris, dwarf larkspur, dwarf rhododendrons, primula, blue poppies, one can also find thousands of shrubs, orchids and plants in beautiful shades. It was Frank Smythe, an English mountaineer, who discovered this beautiful place in 1931 when he was returning after completing an expedition to Mt Kamet. Treks in this area takes travelers through beautiful landscapes of mountains, forests and flowery meadows, past cascading waterfalls and rushing streams.\n\nAccording to UNESCO: Nestled high in West Himalaya, India’s Valley of Flowers National Park is renowned for its meadows of endemic alpine flowers and outstanding natural beauty. This richly diverse area is also home to rare and endangered animals, including the Asiatic black bear, snow leopard, brown bear and blue sheep. The gentle landscape of the Valley of Flowers National Park complements the rugged mountain wilderness of Nanda Devi National Park. Together they encompass a unique transition zone between the mountain ranges of the Zanskar and Himalaya, praised by mountaineers and botanists for over a century and in Hindu mythology for much longer. [Source: UNESCO]\n\n“Valley of Flowers is an outstandingly beautiful high-altitude Himalayan valley. Its ‘gentle’ landscape, breath-taking beautiful meadows of alpine flowers and ease of access has been acknowledged by renowned explorers, mountaineers and botanists in literature for over a century and in Hindu mythology for much longer.” The Valley of Flowers’ gentler landscape “complements the rugged, inaccessible, high mountain wilderness of Nanda Devi. Apart from some community-based ecotourism to small portions of these parks, there has been no anthropogenic pressure in this area since 1983. This property therefore acts as a control site for the maintenance of natural processes, and is of high significance for long-term ecological monitoring in the Himalayas.\n\n“The Valley of Flowers is internationally important on account of its diverse alpine flora, representative of the West Himalaya biogeographic zone. The rich diversity of species reflects the valley’s location within a transition zone between the Zanskar and Himalaya ranges to the north and south, respectively, and between the Eastern and Western Himalaya flora. A number of plant species are globally threatened, several have not been recorded from elsewhere in Uttarakhand and two have not been recorded in Nanda Devi National Park. The diversity of threatened species of medicinal plants is higher than has been recorded in other Indian Himalayan protected areas. The entire Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve lies within the Western Himalayas Endemic Bird Area (EBA). Seven restricted-range bird species are endemic to this part of the EBA.”\n\nNanda Devi and Valley of Flowers National Park Ecosyems\n\nAccording to UNESCO: The Nanda Devi and Valley of Flowers National Parks are naturally well protected due to their remoteness and limited access. Both the parks were unexplored until the 1930s and have not been subjected to anthropogenic pressures since 1983 with the exception of some well regulated community-based ecotourism to small portions of the parks. Therefore, both the parks contain relatively undisturbed natural habitats that now act as control sites for the continuance of natural processes. The integrity of this property is further enhanced by the fact that both the parks form the core zones of the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve and are encircled by a large buffer zone of 514,857 ha. The Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary and the Reserved Forest Divisions located west, south and east of the Biosphere Reserve provide additional buffer to this Biosphere Reserve. The local communities residing in the buffer zones of the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve actively participate in the conservation programs of the Forest Department.\n\n“Nanda Devi West, India's second-highest mountain, lies on a short ridge projecting into the basin and rises up from Nanda Devi East on the eastern rim. Trisul, in the southwest, also lies inside the basin. The upper Rishi Valley, often referred to as the 'Inner Sanctuary', is fed by Changbang, North Rishi and North Nanda Devi glaciers to the north and by South Nanda Devi and South Rishi glaciers to the south of the Nanda Devi massif. There is an impressive gorge cutting through the Devistan-Rishikot ridge below the confluence of the North and South Rishi rivers. The Trisuli and Ramani glaciers are features of the lower Rishi Valley or 'Outer Sanctuary', below which the Rishi Ganga enters the narrow, steep-sided lower gorge.\n\n“Forests are restricted largely to the Rishi Gorge and are dominated by fir, rhododendron and birch up to about 3,350 meters. Forming a broad belt between these and the alpine meadows is birch forest, with an understorey of rhododendron. Conditions are drier within the 'Inner Sanctuary', becoming almost xeric up the main Nanda Devi glaciers. Beyond Ramani, the vegetation switches from forest to dry alpine communities, with scrub juniper becoming the dominant cover within the 'Inner Sanctuary'. Juniper gives way altitudinally to grasses, prone mosses and lichens, and on riverine soils to annual herbs and dwarf willow. Woody vegetation extends along the sides of the main glaciers before changing gradually to squat alpines and lichens. Local populations use a total of 97 species, for medicine, as food plants, fodder, fuel, tools, house building and fibres, as well as for religious purposes.\n\n“The basin is renowned for the abundance of its ungulate populations, notably Himalayan musk deer (listed as 'lower risk' threatened species). Mainland serow and Himalayan tahr are also common. The distribution of goral does not appear to extend to within the basin, although the species does occur in the vicinity of the national park. Large carnivores are common leopard, Himalayan black bear and brown bear, the existence of which has yet to be confirmed. The only primate present is common langur, although rhesus macaque has been sighted outside the park boundaries. Some 83 species are reported from the biosphere reserve.\n\nA total of 114 bird species belonging to 30 families was recorded during the 1993 Nanda Devi Scientific and Ecological Expedition, some 67 for the first time. Species abundant during May and June include crested black tit, yellow-bellied fantail flycatcher, orange-flanked bush robin, blue-fronted redstart, Indian tree pipit, vinaceous-breasted pipit, common rosefinch and nutcracker. Species richness was found to be highest in temperate forests, with a significant decline in richness as elevation increased.\n\nImage Sources: Wikimedia Commons\n\nText Sources: India tourism website ( incredibleindia.org), India’s Ministry of Tourism and other government websites, UNESCO, Wikipedia, Lonely Planet guides, New York Times, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, National Geographic, The New Yorker, Bloomberg, Reuters, Associated Press, AFP, Yomiuri Shimbun and various books and other publications.\n\nUpdated in August 2020"
