        "text": "2. UTTARAKHAND FOREST\n\nThe state ranks sixth among the other states in terms of percentage of recorded forest area. The total forest area under various classes of the State is 37,999.53 km2, which is 71% of the geographic area. The forest area under forest department is 25,863.18 km2. According to forest survey of India (FSI-2015), very dense forest is 4,785 km2, moderately dense forest is 14,111 km2, open forest is 5,612 km2 and Scrub is 262 km2. About 19% area of the State is under permanent snow cover, glaciers and steep slopes and therefore it is unsuitable for trees growth. The forest department of Uttarakhand has 13 circles, 44 divisions, 284 ranges and 1569 beat. The human and livestock population is largely dependent on forests due to agrarian-economy leading to heavy pressure on forests and consequent degradation of ecology and environment of the area. Although the State of Uttarakhand is well endowed with biological resources, the last few decades have seen an increase in pressure on the state's forest ecosystems as for e.g. the Shiwalik range of Uttarakhand has been virtually degraded of its forest cover and forested landscape has been pushed to the upper regions. In the most populated belt (1000-2000 m asl) of Uttarakhand state, Oak (Quercus spp.) and Pine (Pinus roxburghii) forests form the dominant forest vegetation which cover about 12.3% and 16.4%, respectively of the total geographical area of the state (Singh & Singh, 1992).\n\n3. TYPES OF FORESTS IN UTTARAKHAND\n\nThe different types of forests found in Uttarakhand (Fig. 1) as classified by Champion and Seth, 1968 are:\n\nMoist Alpine Scrub: It occurs at tree line around an altitude of 3500 m and the dominant species noticed here are Betula utilis and Rhododendron campanulatum\n\nSub Alpine Forest: It exists at an altitude of 2900 m to 3500 m above sea level and are characterised by patches of Abies-Betula forest interspersed with grassland called as Bugyals.\n\nHimalayan Dry Temperate Forest: This type of forest is found in the inner dry trans-Himalayan valleys of the state. Major species occurring here are Cedrus deodara, a highly valued endemic species, grows mainly in the western part of the range. Other species that occur between 1,900 and 2,700 m are blue pine (Pinus wallichiana), Juniperus spp.\n\nHimalayan Moist Temperate Forest: This type of forest occurs between 1600-2900m altitudes and is mainly characterised by coniferous species such as Picea smithiana, Abies pindrow, Cedrus deodara, Betula spp. and Quercus spp.\n\nSub Tropical Pine Forest: This type of forest is found in the lower region of Himalayas with pines as the dominant species.\n\nTropical Dry Deciduous Forests: This type of forest occurs in the dry southern face of Shiwaliks and adjoining plain’s area. It is open and mixed type forest with the major species as shorea robusta, Terminalia tomentosa, Anogeissus latifolia,etc.\n\nLittoral and Swamp Forest: This type of forest occurs in the valleys of the foothills, characterised by the presence of water loving species such as Ficus glomerata, Syzygium cumini, Pterospermum acerifolium and Diospyros embryopteris\n\nTropical Moist Deciduous Forests: This multi-storey type forest is found in the moist regions of the lower Himalayas and tarai area. The dominant vegetation of these forests is Terminalia tomentosa, Adina cordifolia, Anogeissus latifolia and Shorea robusta\n\n5. FOREST DEGRADATION\n\nUttarakhand forests are subjected to different stresses like over extraction, live-stock grazing, forest fires, climate change, natural calamities, encroachment and illicit felling. According to the report submitted by FSI in 2015, the forest cover of Uttarakhand has been found to be decreased 268sqkm in last two years. Out of 13 districts, maximum forest cover lost was found in Uttarkashi (73sqkm) followed by Nainital (70sqkm), Udham Singh Nagar (40sqkm), Haridwar (27sqkm) and Bagheshwar (22sqkm). The main reasons for decrease in forest cover mentioned in the report were rotational felling and diversion of forest land for development activities. A study by Prabhakar et al. (2006) estimated that 78% of the forest (including scrub) area was degraded and had a crown cover of less than 40% in Almora district of Uttarakhand by different developmental activities. Disturbances in the forest structure increases the rate of species loss and create more opportunities for introduction of invasive species such as Eupatorium, Lantana camara, Parthenium, and Ageratum spp. in the natural forests, which will have a competitive impact on existing species. In the Pithoragarh district a net deforestation rate of -0.13 and a gross deforestation rate of 0.52% was estimated in between 1976 to 2006 (Munsi et al. 2009). Similarly in the Kuchgad micro-watershed of Almora district, a net deforestation rate of 0.48 was noticed from 1967 to 1997 (Wakeel et al. 2005). These authors suggest that with increasing human activities, the deforestation rate has increased over the studied years in Uttarakhand. Major causes for degradation of forest in Uttarakhand are discussed below.\n\n5.1. Climate Change\n\nThe major factor that controls the ecology of a region is climate (Faisal, 2008). Slight change in climate can significantly alter the growth, abundance, survival, composition, productivity, diversity and distribution of species in an ecosystem (Leemans & Eickhout, 2004). Forest ecosystems are one of the most vulnerable ecosystems to any change in the climate (IPCC, 2001). An indication of climate change is the abrupt fluctuation in the meteorological data. Fig. 2 shows 4-year record of monthly averaged surface temperature observations (Hourly) over the 2010-2014 period for the right bank of Alaknanda river Chauras campus, HNB Garhwal University (30°22”N 78°78” E, 560 metres) has been examined to reveal surface temperature trend in Garhwal region. Similarly, monthly averaged surface temperatures derived from the NCEP reanalysis have been examined over the same time period for the Garhwal region (30°22”N 78°78” E). Considerable variation of temperatures from year to year has been observed in both data sets. Trends in annual mean temperature anomalies showed an increase in surface temperature in this region of Garhwal region during past four years. Based on mean monthly and annual surface air temperature records at the Chauras campus, HNB Garhwal University, gradual warming of the order of 0.2 °C (± 0.022) per year has been observed as per NCEP reanalysis data. However, Annual surface temperature at Chauras campus, HNB Garhwal University has been observed 1.58 ± 1.22 °C averaged during 2010 and -0.08 ± 0.47 °C averaged during 2013. Similarly, in a study Mishra (2014) conducted analysis of 100 years of temperature and rainfall data and observed that the Uttarakhand region has recorded a declining rainfall trend during the 1911-1970 period and after 1970 onward, this trend has become steeper. Furthermore, temperature trend of the region shows an increase in warming with year which was more prominent during the last decade (Fig. 3).\n\nDue to increase in temperatures, rapid deforestation, habitat destruction, change in vegetation, scarcity of water and corridor fragmentation may lead extinction of wild flora and fauna (Negi et al. 2012). The abrupt changes in climatic conditions of Uttarakhand are directly or indirectly affecting the vegetation growth and regeneration of important forest species. The regeneration of many species is dependent on the monsoon rainfall mainly the dominant Sal, Banj Oak and Telonj oak in the forests. The variation in rainfall and temperature may lead to changes in phenological events such as flowering, fruiting, budding, coloration etc. of many species, particularly the dominant oaks. In the Himalayan mountains early flowering of several members of Rosaceae (e.g., Pyrus, Prunus spp.) and Rhododendrons are considered the impact of global warming (Khanduri et al. 2008; Negi et al., 2012). Early bud break in Betula utilis has been recorded in 2010 as compared to earlier years (Rai et al., 2010). One of the major consequence of Global warming is the shifting of vegetation from lower elevation to higher elevation and therefore alpine ecosystems are more are very susceptible to the adverse effects of climate change. The species surviving at this region will have no space for their upward movement. (Kumar et al. 2012). Disturbed and fragmented forests and monoculture forests are considered to be more vulnerable to climate change (Rosenzweig 1995; Jandl et al. 2007).\n\n5.2. Natural Calamities\n\nThe frequency of natural calamities in Uttarakhand has increased in last few years mostly heavy rainfall, landslide, earthquakes, cloudburst and avalanche (Table 2). These all are directly or indirectly indicating the impact of climate change. The problems of landslides, subsidence and erosion are quite common in the Uttarakhand due to the contribution of several factors like geological movements, structure, lithology, soil cover, vegetal cover; weather and climatic changes. The problem of landslide is majorly linked to the nature of earthquakes in the region. In the state the frequency of earthquakes per year has been increased in last decade. The other natural calamity i.e. heavy rainfall also shows high frequency of occurrence in 2013, 2014 and 2015. In past few years the problem of cloud burst in Uttarakhand has also caused very severe damage to living and non living thing. Overall all the natural calamities in the state have severely affected the forest ecology directly or indirectly.\n\n5.3. Forest Fires\n\nForest fires in the Uttarakhand state has been a common phenomenon which is increasing more frequently in the decade due to rising temperatures. Forest fires generally occur in two phases; late March and early April when the accumulation of fresh litter can burn, and May-June, when high temperatures, low humidity, extreme dryness becomes favourable. Uttarakhand forests are made up of many species of trees; including chir pine, blue pine, ban oak, sal, sissoo, eucalyptus, etc. The most fire prone zone is the banj oak at the higher altitudes and the chir pine zone, which occupies 17% of the total forest area, and its transition zone with sal (11% of the total forest area) at the lower altitude, a zone with the maximum habitation. Controlled forest fires help in removing and dried litter and allow new growth to come up. However, uncontrolled forest fires, especially summer fires, cause severe damage to the forest biodiversity. Low precipitation during summer season reduces moisture level in the forest making it more susceptible to catch fire and spread quickly over large area of the forest land. It has been observed that forest fires occur mainly due to lightening but in case of Uttarakhand occurrences due to lightening is less as compared to anthropogenic occurrence. All fires in the chir pine forests of Uttarakhand are man-made intentional or accidental. Of the total forest fires incidences in Uttarakhand, 63% were intentional and remaining 37% were accidental (Tiwari et al., 1986, 1987). Table 3 is explaining that a large fraction of area is affected every year due to forest fires and correspondingly a good amount of economic loss is seen in Uttarakhand. Some other effects of forest fires are change in species composition, loss of micro flora and fauna, loss of seeds, loss of habitat of particular species, change in microclimate, migration of species, soil desiccation, soil erosion resulting in landslides and invasion by exotic species.\n\n5.4. Encroachment on Forest Areas and Illicit Felling\n\nIncreasing population leading to poverty is the major factor for stimulating forestland encroachment. In Uttarakhand state large population is below poverty level and most of them encroach forests for shelter, food and a range of subsistence products like fuel wood, food, fodder, timber etc. Forest encroachment results in forest degradation which further results in land degradation and leads to agricultural stagnation and even a lowering of productivity, which in turn promotes further encroachment and completes the vicious cycle. As per the report given by FSI, 2015, the total forest area encroached in Uttarakhand state as on 31 March 2015 is 9646.607 Ha. In the total, Kumaun divison contribute 8318.3 Ha. and Garhwal divison 1323.2 Ha. While the contribution from protected areas includes Rajaji National Park 2.988 Ha, Corbett Tiger reserve 1.980Ha and Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve 0.117 Ha. To control encroachment effective legal restrictions should be forced in the state.\n\nFig. 4 shows trend of illicit felling of trees in the state since 2001. Illicit felling is one of the important causes for forest degradation in Uttarakhand. Many strategies are implemented by government against illicit felling but still there is a large volume of illicit felling conducted in the forest.\n\n5.5. Diversion of Forest Land\n\nTo support the increasing population development is required and therefore diversions of forest for various activities are practised at large scale. The diversion of forest land in Uttarakhand from 09.11.2000 to 31.03.2015 under Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 is 39087.8443 ha. This total diversion includes Irrigation Projects (65.9383 ha), Hydro Power projects (2225.0711 ha), Mining (7375.9770ha), Road construction (6375.4835 ha), Communication (2157.2326 ha), Drinking water scheme (196.4014 ha), other scheme (20691.7404 ha). A large area of forest in state is converted into other forms which has created a huge impact on biodiversity."
