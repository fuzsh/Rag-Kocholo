        "text": "The best travel tips for visiting Uttarakhand\n\nGarhwal is the more visited region, busy with pilgrims who flock to its holy spots. At Haridwar, the Ganges thunders out from the foothills on its long journey to the sea.\n\nThe nearby ashram town of Rishikesh is familiar from one of the classic East-meets-West images of the 1960s; it was where the Beatles came to stay with the Maharishi. From here pilgrims set off for the high temples of Char Dham – Badrinath, Kedarnath, Yamunotri and Gangotri, the source of the Ganges.\n\nEarthier pursuits are on offer at Mussoorie, a British hill station and now a popular Indian resort. The less-visited Kumaon region remains largely unspoilt, and boasts pleasant small towns with panoramic mountain views, among them Kausani, Ranikhet, and the tiny hamlet of Kasar Devi, as well as the Victorian hill station of Nainital, where a lakeside promenade throngs with visitors escaping the heat of the plains.\n\nFurther down, it’s possible to stay inside Corbett Tiger Reserve and take a jeep safari to search for elusive wildlife. Both districts abound in classic treks, many leading through bugyals – summer pastures, where rivers are born and paths meet.\n\nPlanning a trip to India? Perhaps our local experts in India can help you!\n\nWhat to do in Uttarakhand\n\nFrom the pilgrim circuit to the four sacred sites of Garhwal to the Gangotri Trek beyond the tree line to Gaumukh Glacier, here’s what to do in Uttarakhand.\n\n#1 Get spiritual at Char Dham\n\nAs the sacred land that holds the sources of the mighty Ganges and Yamuna rivers, Garhwal has been the heartland of Hindu identity since the ninth century when, in the wake of the decline of Buddhism in northern India, the reformer Adi Shankara incorporated many of the mountains’ ancient shrines into the fold of Hinduism.\n\nHe founded the four main yatra (pilgrimage) temples, deep within the Himalayas, known as the Char Dham – Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamunotri.\n\nEach year, between May and November, once the snows have melted, streams of pilgrims penetrate high into the mountains, passing by way of Haridwar and Rishikesh, the land of yogis and ashrams.\n\nIn addition to their spiritual significance, the hills have become a hub for adventure sports, offering all levels of trekking, whitewater rafting, paragliding, skiing and climbing.\n\n#2 Witness devotion to the life-bestowing goddess Ganga in Haridwar\n\nSplit by a barrage north of Haridwar, the Ganges flows through the town in two channels, divided by a long sliver of land. The natural stream lies to the east, while the embankment of the fast-flowing canal to the west holds the ghats and ashrams around Har-ki-Pairi temple.\n\nBridges and walkways connect the various islands, and metal chains are placed in the river to protect bathers from being swept away. The clock tower opposite Har-ki-Pairi ghat is an excellent vantage point, especially during evening worship.\n\nAt both dawn and dusk, the spectacular ceremony of Ganga Aarti – devotion to the life-bestowing goddess Ganga – draws crowds of thousands. Lights float down the river and priests perform elaborate choreographed movements while swinging torches to the accompaniment of gongs and music\n\n#3 Try yoga in Rishikesh\n\nRishikesh, 238km northeast of Delhi and just 24km north of Haridwar, huddles along the steep wooded banks of the fast-flowing Ganges as it exits the mountains of Garwhal to crash onto the plains.\n\nThe centre for all manner of New Age and Hindu activity, its many ashrams continue to draw devotees and followers, with the large Shivananda Ashram in particular renowned as a yoga centre.\n\nRishikesh has one or two ancient shrines, but its main role has always been as a waystation for sannyasis, yogis and travellers heading for the high Himalayas.\n\nThe arrival of the Beatles, who came here to meet the Maharishi in 1968, triggered the lucrative expansion of the yatra pilgrimage circuit; these days it’s easy to see why Ringo thought it was “just like Butlin’s”.\n\n#4 Tackle the Gangotri Trek\n\nA flight of steps beside the Gangotri temple begins the 20km trek to Gaumukh Glacier, one of the most beautiful and accessible glaciers in the inner Himalayas. Leaving Gangotri, the trail rises gently above the north bank of the river, offering increasingly spectacular mountain vistas.\n\nAbout 7km further is the oasis of Chirbasa, where the skyline becomes dominated by magnificent buttresses and glass-like walls, culminating in the sharp pinnacles of Bhagirathi 3 (6454m) and Bhagirathi 1 (6856m). The path then climbs above the tree line, passing across a steep rocky area prone to landslides.\n\nJust around the bend, beyond a stream crossing, 5km from Chirbasa, is the cold grey hamlet of Bhojbasa, cowering in the shadows of the surrounding peaks. Most visitors spend a night here before the final push to the glacier. It’s worth braving the cold to reach Gaumukh for sunrise.\n\n#5 Admire The Valley of Flowers\n\nStarting from the mountain hamlet of Govind Ghat (1800m), 28km south of Badrinath, an important pilgrim trail winds 15km up a steep stone path to the overgrown village of Gangharia (3048m), also known as Ghovind Dham. This one-street town is a stopover point for hundreds of Sikh pilgrims en route to Hemkund, as well as for a small trickle of visitors to the Valley of Flowers.\n\nStarting at an altitude of 3352m, the valley was discovered in 1931 by the visionary mountaineer Frank Smythe, who named it for its multitude of rare and beautiful flora. The meadows are at their best during the monsoon, from mid-July until mid-August.\n\n#7 Spot big cats at the Corbett Tiger Reserve\n\nBased at Ramnagar, 63km southwest of Nainital, Corbett Tiger Reserve is one of India’s premier wildlife reserves. Established in 1936 by Jim Corbett (among others) as the Hailey National Park, India’s first, and later renamed in his honour, it is one of Himalayan India’s last expanses of wilderness.\n\nAlmost the entire 1288-square-kilometre park, spread over the foothills of Kumaon, is sheltered by a buffer zone of mixed deciduous and giant sal forests, which provide impenetrable cover for wildlife. The core area of 520 square kilometres at its heart remains out of bounds, and safaris on foot are only permissible in the fringe forests.\n\nCorbett is famous for its big cats, in particular, the tiger – it was the first designated Project Tiger Reserve in 1973 – but its 215 or so tigers are elusive, and sightings are far from guaranteed.\n\nBest places to stay in Uttarakhand\n\nAcross Uttarakhand, better quality and more contemporary places to stay are primarily found in the larger cities. Towns and mountain villages often provide only minimal amenities. Here’s where to stay.\n\nRishikesh\n\nWith a range of accommodations, from budget guesthouses and ashrams to luxury resorts, Rishikesh provides a perfect blend of spirituality, adventure, and tranquillity.\n\nMussoorie\n\nPerched at an elevation of 2,000 metres (6,500 feet), Mussoorie is a charming hill station nestled in the Garhwal Himalayas. It boasts a range of accommodations, including cosy hillside retreats and luxury resorts, making it an ideal choice for a rejuvenating mountain getaway.\n\nNainital\n\nNestled around the sparkling Naini Lake, is a picturesque hill station known for its natural beauty and serene atmosphere. Waterside Nainital offers a variety of accommodation options, including lakeside resorts and charming colonial guesthouses.\n\nAlmora\n\nFor a serene and offbeat experience, stay in Almora. This quiet hill town is known for its panoramic views of the Himalayas. It has a mix of heritage hotels to cosy guesthouses.\n\nBrowse the places to stay in Uttarakhand."
