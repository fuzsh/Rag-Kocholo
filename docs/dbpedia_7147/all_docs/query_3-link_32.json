        "text": "What is a Land Area Calculator?\n\nA Geo Measure land area calculator is a helpful app that aids in calculating your land. Different measures are applied to lands all over India. The most straightforward method would be to use a land calculator to determine the equivalent unit of the local name for the unit.\n\nMost Popular Units for Land Area Calculator Conversion\n\n1. Square Feet\n\nThe area of a square with 1-foot sides is referred to as square feet, also written as sq.ft. or ft2. In every Indian city, this is the standard measurement unit that is utilized. The United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Hong Kong, Ghana, Singapore, and Malaysia are the other nations that measure land in square feet in addition to India.\n\n2. Square Meter\n\nA square meter is a unit of area measurement that is commonly accepted as the standard international unit of area measurement. It is used all over the globe to measure two-dimensional areas like a floor or a ground. A square meter, often known as sq. m or M2, is a unit of measurement for the area that is equal to one meter on each side. The area is proportional to the square of the linear dimension when measuring a property. It ought to be appropriately recorded. Therefore, doubling the linear dimensions results in regions that are four times larger.\n\n3. Hectare\n\nOne of the few frequently used land measurement units in the metric system worldwide is the hectare. The symbol for it is \"ha.\" Despite being the basic metric unit for measuring land, the hectare has grown in popularity. Despite the fact that the acre is also frequently used to describe the land in other parts of the world, the hectare is distinct from the acre in that it is a metric unit. The countries with the highest usage include Australia, Burma, Canada, the European Union, India, the United States, and the United Kingdom. The hectare has various names around the world, including Manzana in Argentina, bunder in the Netherlands, gong qing in China, and jerib in Iran.\n\n4. Acre\n\nOne of the first measuring units for measuring land around the world was the acre, which was first used in the imperial system of units. The dimensions of an acre are similarly one furlong by four rods. For land in various geometries, including rectangles, circles, and even pentagons, one acre can be measured. One acre of land can be any size, as long as the overall land area does not go beyond 43,560 square feet.\n\n5. Bigha\n\nOne of the conventional units of measurement in the North Indian States is the bigha. For the purpose of measuring land, bigha is used in the states of Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, and Uttarakhand. The worth of Bigha varies from state to state, nevertheless. In Rajasthan and some areas of Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar, pucca or pakka bigha have been widely used, but kuchha bigha has primarily been employed by landlords when dealing with their tenants.\n\nHow to Get Precise GPS Area Measurement\n\nAn outstanding GPS field area map measurement tool and app is the Geo Measure Area Calculator. If you want to determine the distance between two sites or cities, it is quite helpful to measure anywhere while you are traveling. This GPS and land surveying app is clear. Google Maps is used to quickly assess distance in farming. Additionally, it helps you to easily verify area conversion, their units, and conversion.\n\nYou will be given full instructions on what to do and how to determine the area measure's distance. Anyone with an Android or iOS smartphone may easily use the application to perform an accurate area distance measurement; no special skills are required.\n\nPeople purchase real estate when they need to calculate it. They will be greatly assisted in the computation of that property mapping measure distance by the geomeasure area calculator software. Farmers that cultivate wheat, corn, assassin, maize, and sugar beet must spend a considerable amount of time measuring the area they have planted in order to ensure that their crops are meeting all requirements. Additionally, ranchers who manage ranches and contract workers who perform agribusiness tasks for agriculturalists can use this app to keep track of the number of fields that have been successfully planted. They can also email each other links that can be opened on Google Maps.\n\nThis app is available for all iPhones/iPad, Android, and macOS users\n\nFrequently Asked Questions:\n\nHow Land Area are Calculated?\n\nAny unit of measurement can be used to compute a piece of land's area. The initial measurement of the land is its length and breadth, and the findings are multiplied. The area of the land is calculated as the product of the length and breadth of the land.\n\nHow to Calculate Land Area from a Map\n\nThere are several online apps that may be used to determine a piece of land's area from a map. The only thing you would need to do is zoom in on the map and mark the edge of the plot of land. The region of that specific piece will then be visible on your screen after this is complete. This can be measured manually or with GPS. Additionally, you have the option to convert these computations into whichever unit you like.\n\nHow to Calculate an Irregularly Shaped Piece of Land\n\nThe area of a piece of land with an irregular shape can be manually determined using specific formulas. As an alternative, there are other online calculators that can be used to determine the size of the land.\n\nRecommended Blogs\n\n| Geo Measure Area Calculator - Area Measured By Drawing Custom Path\n\n| Augmented Reality (AR) - A Game Changer For Mobile Apps in 2021\n\n| Measure Your Land In One Minute\n\n| Top Augmented Reality App Development Company In Rajkot, Gujarat, India\n\n| KML Viewer and converter in Android & iPhone\n\n| Geo Measure Area Calculator Tutorial: Create GPS Fields With Manual Measuring\n\n| Feature KML File Viewer on Open any KML file using Geo Measure Area Calculator app"
