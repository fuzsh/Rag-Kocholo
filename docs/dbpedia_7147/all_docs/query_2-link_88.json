        "text": "Hindu religion and culture firmly believed that all constituents of our ambient nature are part and creation of God itself. The God has bestowed some specific powers to certain plants, animals and even rivers, mountains and places which play an important role in human life. Ethnobotany includes all aspects of natural and direct relationship of plants with people. Ethnobotanical knowledge encompasses both wild and domesticated species, and is rooted in observation, relationship, needs and traditional ways of knowing. It can be defined as sacred beliefs, a system of good or evil, faith and worship of supernatural beings and explaining everything in this universe as an act of supernatural beings. There is a need to document the valuable knowledge as it is diminishing very rapidly. During the survey 30 plants belonging to 22 families used for religious purposes have been documented because the local communities and cultures are day by day extincting and with them goes their traditional folklore. An initiative has taken to document the ethnic knowledge regarding the usage of religious plants in Sounla Village of district Tehri Garhwal. The scientific documentation of the plant species which are used in socio-culture and religious activities will definitely give encouragement to the local people.Uttarakhand, the Mountainous State of Himalayan Region is famous for its religious culture, traditions and pronounced as land of Gods or Devbhoomi. People of this state are highly religious and variety of rituals related to God and Goddess worships are performed in various ways, round the year by the local people in which plants have their defined roles and importance (Sharma and Joshi, 2010). Hindu scriptures tell us that a wide range of plants have divine qualities, hence used in a number of religious activities and rituals right from the marriage till death. These plant species are regularly used by the local people in various religious activities and traditional healing system. The traditional worship practices show the symbiotic relation of human beings and nature. Rural communities all over the world lived in harmony with nature and conserved its valuable biodiversity. The man is using plants in various ways since existence of his life on the earth. They use it in many ways including worshipping Gods and Goddess for the protection and betterment of human life. The preservation of indigenous knowledge with plant and forests may be important tools for conservation of the plant species (Brahma et. al. 2014). Nature and scope of the term ethnobotany be widened to include all aspects like natural and direct relationship with plants of any people, at any level of antiquity, primitiveness or acculturation, and even to the most sophisticated gentlemen\n\nThe sacred groves in the Phulbani Forest Division of Odisha were studied to understand the richness of plant biodiversity and traditional socio cultural elements of the local people. Sampling method was adopted to study the biodiversity and growth of trees followed by a questionnaire survey in the sacred grove areas with special interaction with the VSS and sacred grove committee members. Most of the sacred groves were named after the deity dwelling in the respective sacred groves. Trees like sal (Shorea robusta) and rohini (Somida febrifusa) are worshipped in the sacred places by the local people of the area. Apart from common festivals, Mati Yagna and Indra Yagna are also celebrated in the sacred grove areas of this division to obtain a good harvest and timely rain. It was found that various traditional customs associated with sacred groves were in practice by the Kondh tribe. From the sampling enumeration, it was confirmed that the sacred groves were rich in plant genetic diversity and were composed of many medicinally useful species, wild edible fruits, fodder, fuel wood and timber yielding species. The Shannon Weiner Index of individual sacred groves was calculated for knowing the weightage of species by their frequencies."
