        "text": "In Uttarakhand, a state known for its hilly terrain and rich forest resources, Van Panchayats have played a crucial role in preserving and maintaining the forests. These institutions were established with the aim of involving local communities, who are directly dependent on forests for their livelihoods, in sustainable forest management practices. The key features of Van Panchayats in Uttarakhand include:\n\nCommunity Participation:\n\nVan Panchayats comprise members from the local community, often elected by the villagers themselves. These members are responsible for making decisions related to forest protection, afforestation, and sustainable use of forest resources.\n\nForest Management:\n\nVan Panchayats are tasked with managing and protecting the forests in their jurisdiction. This includes preventing illegal logging, controlling forest fires, and regulating grazing and other activities that might harm the ecosystem.\n\nAfforestation and Reforestation:\n\nVan Panchayats are actively involved in planting new trees and restoring degraded forest areas through afforestation and reforestation efforts.\n\nEconomic Benefits:\n\nWhile the primary focus is on environmental conservation, Van Panchayats also work to provide economic benefits to local communities. They often engage in activities like non-timber forest produce collection and sale.\n\nEnvironmental Education:\n\nThese institutions also play a role in educating the local communities about the importance of forests, biodiversity, and sustainable resource management.\n\nLegal Recognition:\n\nVan Panchayats in Uttarakhand are recognized under the state’s Forest Conservation Act, which grants them certain legal powers to manage and protect their designated forest areas.\n\nOverall, Van Panchayats have been successful in fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility among local communities toward their forests. This model of community-based forest management has received praise for its positive impact on forest conservation and rural development. It empowers local people to take charge of their natural resources and contributes to the broader goal of environmental sustainability.\n\nSelection of Van Panchayats in UFRMP:\n\nVan Panchayat (VP) / Village Forest Council is an autonomous local institution having legally demarcated village forests. They were formed for sustainable management and protection of forests and its natural resources. The first VP, approved by the government, was formed in 1921. Uttarakhand has more than 12,000 VPs managing around 4,96,185 ha. of forests. The area under each VP ranges from small tracts of land to more than 2,000 ha. All the community forests are managed as per the guidelines in the Van Panchayat Act (Find attached document Van Panchayat Act 2005). It’s the joint responsibility of the state and communities to manage the Forest Council. For effective results, the Revenue Department guides the forest communities.\n\nWhen it comes to selecting Van Panchayat as part of an Uttarakhand Forest Resources Management Project (UFRMP), the criteria often align with the overall goals and objectives of the project. These criteria are designed to ensure that the selected VPs are best suited to contribute to the successful implementation of the project and the sustainable management of forest resources.\n\nHere are some specific selection criteria that might be considered for a Van Panchayat in a UFRMP:\n\nEligibility Criteria for Van Panchayat in UFRMP:\n\nApproximate area availability (it is proposed to treat 50ha average area under each VP)\n\nWillingness of VP members to participate in restoration works\n\nLocations of certain VPs on SOI topo maps with approximate coordinates (Latitude-Longitude)\n\nDivision/ Range wise list (which could not be located) have been provided to PMU\n\nFeedback on errors in plotting of VP locations, if any\n\nSelection Criteria & Parameters of evaluation of VPs:\n\nPast performance of VPs\n\nExtent of forest degradation\n\nPossibility of VP cluster formation\n\nDistance from RF\n\nPopulation and Target group population Approach:\n\nVisualization / analysis of degradation and possibility of cluster formation requires study of maps showing VP locations\n\nGeographic Information System (GIS) shall be adopted to study such location-based information from SOI maps, FSI Forest Cover maps, Watershed Maps, etc.\n\nRejection of Van Panchayat:\n\nAt times feasibility may be impacted due to reasons such as\n\nOther on-going projects\n\nInactive VP\n\nNon-workable area (rocky or very steep slopes)/ insufficient workable area\n\nAlternate use by local community (grazing, etc.)\n\nOld plantations\n\nFinal Selection after field feasibility report\n\nIt’s important to tailor the selection criteria to the specific goals and context of the UFRMP, while also considering the broader principles of community-based forest management. Ultimately, the goal is to select Van Panchayat who can work together to ensure the success of the project and the sustainable well-being of both the forest ecosystem and the local community.\n\nDuring the Project, eco-restoration, livelihood enhancement, and community development activities will be carried out in 38,000 ha of forest area involving 839 Van Panchayats selected from the 13 forest divisions. Van Panchayats are chosen for these operations based on scientific metrics related to forest degradation, a cluster strategy, and socio-economic criteria.\n\nROLE OF FIELD NGOS (FNGOS)\n\nThe Field NGOs (FNGOs) are responsible for strengthening the capacity of Van Panchayats (VPs) and Self Help Groups (SHGs) in their area of operation for sustainable forest management and improved livelihood. It involves community mobilization, facilitation of participatory micro-planning processes, convergence with other schemes and projects, providing guidance in income generating activities (IGAs), management of revolving funds to be provided to SHGs and to capacity building of VPs and SHGs in implementing the Project activities. FNGOs are also to assist in capacity building of community level resource persons. In executing the above tasks, FNGOs provide qualified personnel to be placed in the field and work in close coordination with PMU/DMU/FMU to achieve the desired Project objectives.\n\nSelection of VPs to be taken up in the Project is being carried out in batches. Eventually a total number of 750 VPs are to be taken up in the project duration. Selected VPs would be implementing various interventions under the Project. From each VP, 2 SHGs (in all 1500 SHGs from 750 VPs) will be provided support for livelihood and income generating activities.\n\nThe FNGOs are providing the services of field level coordinators (FLCs) and Marketing Specialists (MS) for working with the local community of the selected VPs and facilitate micro planning, adoption of existing SHGs or, if required, formation of new SHGs, facilitating income generating activities, organizing various training programs, providing handholding support to the village community and convergence with different Government schemes.\n\nAt the DMU level, Field NGOs engage MS and field coordinators (FLCs) in batches at the FMU level.\n\nMARKETING SPECIALIST\n\nMarketing Specialist works in close coordination with DMU and report to DMU Chief/ DFO about various developments and the inputs provided, and also apprises his FNGO about the progress made at regular interval.\n\nThe indicative list of tasks assigned to Marketing Specialist include,\n\ninter alia, the following:\n\nTo prepare monthly work plan of Field coordinators for assigned tasks for the purposes of SHG formations/adoption, capacity building and IGAs in close coordination with DMU/FMU.\n\nTo identify the training needs of the SHGs and organize training programs and exposure visits.\n\nTo guide SHGs in all the activities from identification of potential activities, development of business models and micro financing.\n\nTo mobilize subject matter specialists as per requirement of SHGs.\n\nTo facilitate linkages between SHGs and market, financial institutions and other schemes/programs to mobilize resources based on convergence.\n\nTo facilitate development of enterprises and setting up of cluster level organizations.\n\nTo prepare monthly and quarterly reports and submit these to DMU.\n\nTo participate in review meetings.\n\nAny other Project related activity as the situation arises.\n\nFIELD LEVEL COORDINATORS (FLCS)\n\nField Level Coordinators (FLCs) report to their respective FMUs and the DMU and are the link between VPs/SHGs and DMU/FMU. They require to carryout capacity building activities so as to enable the VPs/community in executing various Project activities. They carry out the following tasks and report to FMU/DMU in the format devised for this purpose:\n\nMobilize VPs for Project implementation to achieve Project objectives.\n\nGuide VPs in selection of Entry Point Activities (EPAs) and preparation of micro-plans.\n\nCapacity building of village resource persons as per requirements of the Project.\n\nFormation of new SHGs or adoption and revival of existing SHGs.\n\nSupport SHGs in identification of potential IGAs and developing business models with support from market specialists placed at DMU level.\n\nAssist VPs/SHGs in record keeping and organise meetings.\n\nConvergence with other Government Schemes in augmenting livelihood options for the community.\n\nRecord the progress of the field level Project activities as per requirements of the Project.\n\nOrganize various training programs and exposure visits at VP/SHG level.\n\nPrepare various monthly reports for submission to DMUs.\n\nAny other Project related activity as the situation arises.\n\nIntimate FMU/ DMU while making field visits and report back to FMU/DMU.\n\nAttend review meetings.\n\nSend an account of the tasks accomplished to FNGO for review."
