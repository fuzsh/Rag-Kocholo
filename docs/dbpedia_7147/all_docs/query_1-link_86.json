        "text": "From the depth of water bodies to vastness of the sky, if there is any place on the landscape of India that defines beauty, it’s Uttarakhand. Formerly known as Uttaranchal, Uttarakhand is an exquisitely beautiful state in the Northern part of India. If one wishes to plan a rejuvenating vacation to get rid of dryness and hotness that mostly defines the climatic conditions of the city life, this hilly region comes across as an ideal location. It might be enlightening to know the fact that its referential recognition came in August 2006, when India’s Union Cabinet agreed to the demands of the Uttaranchal State Assembly. As a result of which, the influential members of the Uttarakhand Statehood Movement also granted permission to let Uttaranchal be known as Uttarakhand.\n\nThe name might have changed, but its charm and aura remain similarly captivating and attractive.\n\nOften referred to as ‘Devbhumi’ (meaning ‘The land of Gods’), owing to the significant number of Hindu temples and centers of pilgrimage which are found in this state. It is a mesmerizing and multifaceted state with an excellent plethora of culture and nature which complements and enriches each other. Globally acknowledged and appreciated as a state with a beautiful canvas of nature and resplendence, its prestige rests predominantly on the Himalayas, the Bhabhar, and the Terai. The 27th state of the Republic of India, Uttarakhand, was created from the Himalayan and the adjoining northwestern districts of Uttar Pradesh. Uttarakhand circumscribed by the Tibet Autonomous Region from the North, the Far Western Region, Nepal from the East, the Indian States of the Uttar Pradesh from the South, and Himachal from the west. Uttarakhand is a state with an expanded arena and fertile geographical dimensions. It is divided into two regions, i.e., Garhwal and Kumaon, with a total of thirteen districts. The interim capital of Uttarakhand is Dehradun. Dehradun, interestingly, happens to be the largest city in the region. On religious parameters, about 83% of the people belonging to this state follow Hinduism, with Islam being the least supported religious tenet. With beauty, mysticism, and richness of resources all abound, Uttarakhand generally tops the list of a favorite tourist spot by many.\n\nHistory\n\nHistorically, Uttarakhand has a vast arena of factual edges to offer. Since prehistoric times, archaeologists have supported the testimony of the existence of humans in this state. During the Vedic age of ancient India, this region formed a significant portion of the Kuru and the Panchal kingdoms. In the 2nd century BCE (also recognized as the Vedic age of ancient India), an ancient form of ‘Shaivism’ was practiced by the first influential dynasty known popularly as ‘Kunidas.’ Specifically, the region was consolidated under the Garhwal kingdom and the Kumaon kingdom during the medieval period. In 1816, modern Uttarakhand was attributed to the British, as per the conditions of the Treaty of Sugauli.\n\nThe erstwhile hill kingdoms of Garhwal and Kumaon are known to be traditional rivals. However, the proximity of various adjoining ethnic groups and the complementary nature of their geography, culture, economy, and language aided in creating amicable bonds between the two regions. This bond strengthened and was further made strong during the Uttarakhand movement for statehood in the 1990s. It might be enlightening to register the fact that on 24 September 1998, the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly and Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council passed the Uttar Pradesh Reorganization Bill, which initiated the process of creating a new state. In 2000, the parliament passed the Uttar Pradesh Reorganization Bill, and this is how Uttarakhand came into being as the 27th state of Republic India.\n\nGeography\n\nThe significant proportion of Uttarakhand, i.e., 86%, is mountainous, and the forests cover 65 % with total expansion of 53, 483 km square. High Himalayan peaks and glaciers cover most of the Northern section of the state. The state of Uttarakhand evinces a fantastic amalgamation of water bodies that mostly have a traditional and religious edge to it. Two of the most significant rivers in Hinduism originate from the Himalayan peaks situated in this region: The Ganges at Gangotri and the Yamuna at Yamunotri. These two, along with Badrinath and Kedarnath, form the globally acknowledged the ‘Chota Char Dham,’ a holy pilgrimage for the Hindus.\n\nLying on the southern slope of the Himalayan range, the climate and the vegetation of Uttarakhand keeps on varying with elevation, from glaciers at the highest mountains to subtropical forests at the lower elevations. The highest elevations are canopied by ice and the bare rock. Below them, between 3,000 and 5,000 meters, which could also be estimated as about 9,800 ft. and 16,400 ft. respectively are the alpine shrubs and meadows.\n\nBelow 1,500 meters elevation, one observes that Himalayan subtropical forests lie, in all its majesty and grandeur.\n\nThis state indeed exemplifies the rich and fertile interaction between nature in its true essence and also demonstrates how human intervention provides a limiting circumference to it. Strikingly, nature, too, has shown it’s a devastating aspect to Uttarakhand. In June 2013, a hefty rainfall led to a massive flood due to which many people died, and numerous were missing. Known amongst Indian media as “Himalayan Tsunami,” this unfortunate event demands appropriate allusion here; it damaged the land exponentially, and the level of water bodies of Uttarakhand kept on fluctuating for the most extended period of the time.\n\nClimate\n\nWith an outstanding aura of beauty and tranquility surrounding throughout the year, Uttarakhand is a region with a moderate temperature that does not fluctuate except rare calamities. It has mainly two different climatic zones, namely the hilly terrain and the smaller plain zone. The weather varies, respectively, depending on the particular place. The specific climatic conditions, according to the various seasons, are, precisely as follows:\n\nSummers\n\nMore often than not, summers in Uttarakhand are pleasant, but there are certain places where the hot climate may en-nerve people. The temperature, in places, like Haridwar and Rishikesh, can reach even the 40 degrees Celsius mark. Coupled with the humidity, it might be pretty uncomfortable. Nominally, the summer season in Uttarakhand extends from April to June. Visiting Uttarakhand during these months should be ideally avoided, as it does not allow tourists to enjoy the splendor of the state due to the scorching heat.\n\nWinters\n\nExcessively cold and teeth-clattering winds aptly define the winters in Uttarakhand. Many places receive regular rainfalls, and hence the weather in winters remains moist and cold. The temperature during the winter season ranges from sub-zero to about 15 degrees Celsius. The winter season in Uttarakhand generally extends from October to February. People who wish to demystify the splendid layers of nature in its pristine form can visit Uttarakhand during winters and can unravel the greenery in a fresh and captivating ambiance.\n\nMonsoon\n\nThe monsoon season lies from July to September. The temperature is conducive to promoting tourism and sports activities in this exciting state. The monsoon invites people with adventurous and inquisitive streaks in their veins from around the globe. Interestingly, the state receives 90% of its rainfall during this season. Being one of the most pleasant seasons of Uttarakhand, the monsoon illustrates the scenic facets of Uttarakhand and the divine awe of mountains in its most sublime form.\n\nBest Time to Visit\n\nWith freezing sensations in the air and the spirits-lifting joy in the surroundings, the monsoon, i.e., July to September, is the most suitable time to visit Uttarakhand. It is not only conducive to promoting adventurous sports like rock-climbing and trekking but also allows visitors to embark on water games, sight-seeing and exploring the beauty and charm of this beautiful hilly-state.\n\nHow to Reach\n\nBy Rail: There are understandably only a few major cities with railway stations located primarily in hilly regions. Rishikesh, Dehradun, Haridwar, and Nainital are amongst a few of the cities that have railway stations. These stations are favorably well-connected to most of the neighboring states.\n\nBy Road: There are many regular private and state bus services that can be found providing services throughout the country. However, one must keep in mind the fact that due to its hilly slopes, there are probabilities of landslides, but one has to understand the fact that there are not many alternatives available. If carefully handled, road–trips through Uttarakhand can be pure bliss.\n\nBy Air: Uttarakhand has many domestic airports. Two of the most often opted are Dehradun’s Jolly Grant Airport and Pithoragarh’s Naini Saini Airport. Nevertheless, at the peak time of vacations and monsoon season, it’s a difficult task to get the air-tickets for Uttarakhand. So, it’s highly advisable to make the bookings fairly advanced if one wishes to use this mode of transportation to reach Uttarakhand.\n\nPlaces to Visit\n\nUttarakhand provides ample opportunity to the people deeply rooted in religious beliefs as well as the folks who enjoy the serenity of the natural environs. It’s a highly rejuvenating tourist spot that attracts visitors from all the corners of the world due to its local color and traditional heritage.

When nature and culture blend harmoniously, Uttarakhand demonstrates the visual spark that this state wraps within its layers.\n\nCulture\n\nUttarakhand's highly multi-layered ethnicities have formed a rich literary tradition in many languages, including Hindi, Kumaoni, Garhwali, Jaunsari, and Bhoti. Many of its cultural tales and fables originated initially been in the form of lyrical ballads and were chanted by skilled classical singers. Presently, they are seen as the classics of Hindi literature.

These folk songs chant the melodies of the traditional heritage and ancient links of the state. \"Bedu Pako\" is also a famous folk song of Uttarakhand with blazing fame around the globe and highly respectable status within the state premises. Its great value lies in the fact that it is locally adored and appreciated as the \"unofficial song of Uttarakhand.\" Since it's a state with strong mystical and superstitious beliefs, the music here is also seen as a tool to invoke divine figures and gods. For example, Jagar is a popular form of 'Bhavana Upasana' in which the Jagiya sings a saga addressed to the gods by reciting ancient epics such as the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. What is unique about 'Jagar' is that it doesn't sing the glory of the gods concerned ungrudgingly; they mainly sing about the adventures as well as the exploits of the deities. It is enlightening to mention here that Narendra Singh Negi and Mina Rana are famous folk singers of the region.\n\nSports\n\nEncapsulated within the valleys and hills of Uttarakhand are multiple possibilities of enjoying and engaging oneself in adventurous sports and exciting activities.

According to the data provided by the Central Statistical Organization, the growth rate registered in the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) of Uttarakhand in the year 2011 was 9.31%. Its actual GSDP increased by 13.7% during the period spanning 2005 to the year 2012. Also, pegged at approximately ₹ 82,193 for FY 2012, the State per capita income of this advancing state exceeds the national average of ₹ 60,603. By universal consent, it accedes that this high increase is primarily due to the growing investor confidence. It was gradually building trust in the New Industrial Policy, which was proclaimed by the Central Government in the year 2003, according to which the new and rising investment was offered to relieve tax benefits. The more exceptional achievement is that it did not limit itself within national boundaries, this policy related to new industries managed to attract a prominent FDI of US $ 46.7 million. This data is documented up to October 2009, as released by the Reserve Bank of India.\n\nIn addition to it, as elsewhere in India, agriculture remains the predominant sector of Uttarakhand Economy. The major crops produced in this state are Basmati Rice, wheat, coarse cereals, groundnuts, soybeans and sugar cane, pulses and oilseeds, etc. It is generally conceded that the world-famous, aromatic Basmati Rice is an original native of this region of India, though now, it is produced at an ever-increasing rate in the many areas of the country.\n\nOn the other hand, the nourishing mountain climate has helped this state to come across as a leading producer of non-seasonal vegetables – from cauliflower to peas, from tomatoes to cabbage and from peas to potatoes, everything is grown in Uttarakhand almost in all the seasons. In addition to these principle agricultural productions, a large percentage of orchards in Uttarakhand provides ample space for developing and producing many fruits such as apples, plums, peaches, litchis, oranges, and apricots. Apart from it, it has lately become an exceedingly efficient state in producing non-seasonal fruits like strawberries. These increasing and strengthening fruit- processing industry has helped significantly in the overall progression of the state. It has also aided in supporting an indigenous beekeeping industry (Apiculture).\n\nBeing in the vicinity of river Ganges and a few others, the state is blessed with flourishing ‘hydropower’ industry connected to the entire state. It is only because of these water bodies such as the Ganges that Uttarakhand could undertake serious projects like ‘Tehri Dam.’ Tea estates, minerals, transports, horticulture, and tourism also add significantly to the economic dimension of Uttarakhand. About 65% of its overall geographical area lies in the areas of forests. This forest region provides shelter to prospering biodiversity of Uttarakhand, with a large proportion of flora and fauna species, most of which are threatened by the fear of extinction. Ranging from the well- known Jim Corbett National Park and Valley of Flowers to Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve to the Rajaji National Park, many wildlife preserving sanctuaries are active throughout the state to battle the enormous problem of endangered animals and plants. The sincere effort of Uttarakhand’s Wildlife Association has been lately showing practical consequences too. Also, Uttarakhand remains unrivaled when it comes to strengthening the economy through industrial activities and herbal and medicinal plant production and distribution. Talking precisely about the extent of diversity of flora and fauna in this hilly region, one observes that it has a total of 34,651 km, The square area under the forest surface. It is a very considerable ratio since it comprises about 65% of the overall area of the state. Being a residence to many rare varieties of herbs and animals, Uttarakhand has many wildlife sanctuaries and reserves. The oldest National Park i.e., Jim Corbett National Park and Valley of National Park located in Chamoli district, are established in this state only, and they together are an essential part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nIn terms of animals’ population and variety, Uttarakhand is a fascinating state. Leopards are one of the animal species which are found both on hills as well as low-steeped jungles. One finds many types of felines in this broadly expanded state like Jungle cats, leopard cats, and fishing cats are examples of mostly discovered felines. In addition to these, mammals such as Yellow-throated Martens, Indian Pangolins, Langurs, Mongoose, Otters, and Elephants rule the forest lands. The water bodies in this region are mainly inhabited by Ghariyas, Marsh Crocodiles, and few other reptiles. However, the rivers also provide a glimpse of Softshell turtles and Indian Sawback turtles. Beautiful and wonder-inspiring birds like orange-breasted pigeons also add the charm of this state. While talking about plants and trees, one needs to specially mention Evergreen Oaks, Conifers, Rhododendrons, Acacia Catechu, and Bauhinia Variegata that cover the state with a large, splendid green blanket. Sadly, an unfortunate event that occurred in the year 2006 infamously known as ‘Uttarakhand forest fires’ caused massive harm to the resources of the Uttarakhand’s forests, a minor proportion of human-life and many wild animals.\n\nHowever, despite this potentially damaging incident, the resplendence and the mesmerizing plethora of flora and fauna found in Uttarakhand reigns in the heart of nature lovers and wildlife explorers.\n\nEducation\n\nIn terms of education and literacy, Uttarakhand is one of the fastest developing states in India.
