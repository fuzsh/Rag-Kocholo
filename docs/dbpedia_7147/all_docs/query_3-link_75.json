        "text": "Non-Standard Units of Length: The measuring system is the collection of units of measurement and the rules that link them together. There are various ways that we can use measure length around us. We employed bodily parts for informal measurement systems such as foot length and handspan, which were incorrect and varied from one person to another. Therefore, it was reason enough to understand why this system of measurement is not accepted by people at large as a standard way to measure distance or length. Thus, a necessity to standardize the measures was found.\n\nIn this article, we have provided all information on Non-Standard Units of Length the Imperial and US customary units, which were all globally standardized. Read this article to get complete information regarding Non-standard units of length, types, uses and examples.\n\nIntroduction to Non-Standard Units of Length\n\nWe measure the various minor objects in our daily lives using both non-standard and conventional units of length measurement. But how do we know how far apart they are? Metric units are used to measure length and distance. Non-standard and standard are the 2 types of units used to find out length.\n\nFinger width, pace, hand span, foot span, arm span, and a cubit are nonstandard measurement lengths. When the length standard measurement units were not introduced, these measurement units were utilised. The images are as follows:\n\nRulers, measuring tapes, and metric sticks are examples of standard length measurement units. We can measure the length in millimetres, centimetres, decimetres, metres, decametres, hectometres, and kilometres. The millimetre is the smallest unit of length measurement. The metre is the base unit, and the kilometre is the largest unit.\n\nNon-Standard Length Unit – Definition\n\nLet’s take a look at what length is and how to calculate it. The term length refers to the length of an object. For instance, consider the length of the following floor.\n\nLength of the blackboard\n\nLength of a pencil\n\nIt can also be used to measure distances, such as the distance between your home and your school.\n\nDistance between two cities or countries\n\nTo measure shorter distances, we can use a hand span, a foot span, or a cubit.\n\nExamples of Non-Standard Units of Length\n\n1. Hand Span\n\nThe distance between the tip of the thumb and the tip of the little finger on an outstretched hand is measured as hand span.\n\nLet us take some measurements.\n\nMona is using her handspan to measure the length of her arithmetic textbook.\n\nAs a result, the math textbook is two hand-spans long.\n\nLet us look at what is meant by foot span.\n\nThe distance between the tip of the toe and the foot’s heel is called the foot span.\n\nLet us take some measurements.\n\nMona wants to use her foot span to measure the length of her classroom.\n\nAs a result, the classroom is a \\(20-\\)foot span long.\n\n3. Cubit\n\nLet us look at how to measure with a cubit now.\n\nThe cubit is the distance between the elbow and the tips of the fingers. Mona now wants to use her cubit to measure the table’s side.\n\nAs a result, the table’s side is \\(4\\) cubits long.\n\n4. Pace Measurement\n\nTwo natural steps are equal to a pace. So, starting with our right foot as the first step, we can count one pace when our left foot strikes the ground.\n\nWhy should you be aware of your speed?\n\nWhile hiking, our pace can be used to keep track of the miles covered. Most people will not utilise pacing to record lengthy distances. However, it is conceivable if we have a system (pacing beads, etc.) to assist you in keeping track of your pace.\n\nWhat is the length of a pace?\n\nThe average length of a pace in feet varies across people and between different types of terrain. Most people walk at a rate of \\(4.5\\) to \\(5\\) feet per second.\n\nHow to use pacing to estimate distances?\n\n1. Pacing can be used to estimate distances. We can count the steps to walk the distance between two points in a straight line. Pacing is especially effective for scouting surveys, contouring with the grid method, and fast double-checking chaining measurements.\n\n2. To be precise, we need to know how long our average step is when we usually walk. It is referred to as our regular pace. We always time ourselves from the toes of the back foot to the toes of the front foot.\n\nTo calculate the average length of your typical pace (pace factor, or \\(PF\\)), do the following:\n\nStart with the toes of your rear foot from a well-marked location, \\(A,\\) and walk in a straight line for \\(100\\) steps on horizontal ground. Mark \\(B,\\) near the toes of your front foot, marks the finish of our previous step. Measure the distance \\(AB\\) (in metres) with a measuring tape and calculate your pace factor \\(PF\\) (in metres) as follows:\n\nExample: If for \\(100\\) paces, you measure a distance of \\({\\rm{76}}\\,{\\rm{m,}}\\) then your pace factor is calculated like this: \\(PF = \\frac{{76\\,{\\rm{m}}}}{{100}} = 0.76\\;{\\rm{m}}\\)\n\n5. Arm Span\n\nThe physical measurement of the length from one end of an individual’s arms (measured at the fingertips) to the other when elevated parallel to the ground at shoulder height at a \\({\\rm{9}}{{\\rm{0}}^{\\rm{o}}}\\) angle is known as arm span or reach (also referred to as wingspan, or written armspan).\n\nIf we wish to measure the length of cloth, we will use our arm span as a guide. When a height measurement is required, the arm span is occasionally utilised.\n\nDifference between Uniform Non-Standard and Non-Uniform Non-Standard Length Units\n\nAssume Ajay and Nikhil are two buddies who want to measure the length of a long jump ground. Ajay is shorter than Nikhil.\n\nAjay was the first to jump, and he discovered a \\(14-\\)foot span.\n\nNikhil was the second to jump and discovered an \\(11-\\)foot span.\n\nWhy are the foot spans measured by Ajay and Nikhil not the same?\n\nOne’s foot span differs from one person to the other. That is the reason the foot spans are not equal.\n\nWith the use of a stick, they measured the length.\n\nAjay discovered that the distance he jumps is three sticks. Nikhil also discovered that his leap distance is three sticks.\n\nAs a result, they both leapt the same distance.\n\nAs a result, the discrepancy in measurements is observed when measuring with a stick(uniform nonstandard) and a foot span (non-uniform nonstandard).\n\nBlocks and paperclips are two more uniforms, nonstandard length measuring items.\n\nWe can use blocks and paper clips to measure the length of a pencil, for example.\n\nAs a result, the pencil’s length is \\(15\\) blocks and \\(6\\) paperclips.\n\nMeasurement of Length\n\nWhen measuring the length, perimeter, and area of an object or location, we employ the same tools. The term length refers to how long something is. The perimeter of an object is the measure around its boundary. The area of an object or shape is the amount of space it occupies. Therefore, we must first measure the length of the sides to determine the perimeter and area of a shape.\n\nWe can do this by using these tools:\n\n1. Ruler\n\nIt can work in handy in various scenarios, such as drawing a line and measuring distance. It is beneficial to the students’ school projects. The architect can use it to plan the building or construction workers to judge the straightness of their work. As a result, it can be used for a variety of academic reasons.\n\n2. Meter Stick\n\nIt is a length measuring tool that’s extremely popular in the construction business. It is usually made of wood or plastic, with metal or plastic joints that are folded together.\n\n3. Measuring Tape\n\nIt is used to determine the physical object’s length. Carpenters frequently use it in their work. It is highly convenient and portable, making it simple to transport from one location to another. It usually has a handy switch that secures the tape in place. When you release it, the tape rapidly retracts back into the shell.\n\nFor smaller things, we utilise inch and centimetre rulers. A metre stick and a measuring tape can be used to measure larger objects. In the United States, customary units such as inch, foot, and mile are employed. Other countries around the world utilise metric units such as centimetres, metres, and kilometres.\n\nThe following units of length measurement are written in abbreviated form:\n\n\\({\\rm{ inch = in, foot = ft, mile = mi, centimetre = cm, metre = m, kilometre = km}}\\)\n\nMeasuring the Length of a Curved Line\n\nWe can’t measure a curved line directly with a metre scale because we can’t straighten the curved line, and placing a straight metre scale along the curve can result in false readings. But there is a smarter way to deal with such a situation, by using a thread for this.\n\nWe can determine the length of the curved line by carefully moving the thread along it while keeping it stretched tightly, and then measuring the used part of the thread on a metre scale.\n\nSolved Examples\n\nQ.1. How many paper clips long are the pen?\n\nAns: The pen is about \\(4\\) paper clips long.\n\nQ.2. How many blocks long are the scissor?\n\nAns: The scissor is about \\(4\\) blocks long.\n\nQ.3. How many blocks long are the key?\n\nAns: The key is about \\(2\\) blocks long.\n\nQ.4. Which among the given tools would be appropriate to measure the brim of the round table?\n\nAns: The rope would be appropriate to measure the brim of the round table.\n\nQ.5. Determine the length of the pencil in centimetres by using the ruler.\n\nAns: The length of the pencil is \\({\\rm{10}}\\,{\\rm{cm}}\\) long.\n\nNon-Standard Units of Measuring Length: Summary\n\nWe use a ruler, a measuring tape, or a metre stick to measure standard length. In addition, we use a hand span, a foot span, a cubit, arm span, pace, and other nonstandard metrics, which are non-uniform since they vary from person to person. Blocks, paperclips, and stick sticks are some examples of uniform, nonstandard length units.\n\nLet us now understand the concept through practices problem.\n\nFAQs on Non-Standard Units of Measuring Length\n\nQ1. What are the standard units of length?\n\nAns: The standard unit of length based on the metric system is a meter.\n\nQ2. How can we measure length using non standard units of measurement?\n\nAns: If we can use our hand span to find out the length of our table. We would then keep track of how many hands spans the table had.\n\nQ3. Can you explain what are the five non standard unit of length measurement?\n\nAns: The hand span, cubit, pace, arm span, and foot span are the five nonstandard units for measuring length.\n\nQ4. What is an example of a unit that is not a standard unit to measure?\n\nAns: Handspan.\n\nQ5. Explain non-standard units of length with an example?\n\nAns: Units of measurement that are not often used. Examples include: a pencil, an arm, a toothpick, or a shoe.\n\nQ6. Name the different units for measuring the length and their equivalents.\n\nAns: Some units used for the measurement of length are Kilometer, Hectometer, Decameter , Meter, Decimeter, Centimeter and Millimeter.\n\n1 Kilometer = 1000 Meters\n\n1 Hectometer = 100 Meters\n\n1 Decameter = 10 Meters\n\n1 Meter = 100 Centimeters\n\n1 Decimeter = 10 Centimeters\n\n1 Centimeter = 10 Millimeters."
