        "text": "Uttarakhand, often referred to as the “Devbhoomi” or “Land of the Gods,” is a state located in the northern part of India. It was carved out of the state of Uttar Pradesh in the year 2000. The capital city of Uttarakhand is Dehradun. Uttarakhand is a 26th Indian state and 10th Himalayan state.\n\nUttarakhand, as a separate state, was officially formed on November 9, 2000. The creation of Uttarakhand was a significant event in India’s political history and was aimed at addressing the unique cultural, geographical, and developmental needs of the northern regions that were part of the larger state of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nBefore the formation of Uttarakhand, the demand for a separate state had been a long-standing aspiration of the people in the hilly regions. They argued that the distinct socio-economic and cultural characteristics of these areas required a focused approach to development. The movement for a separate state gained momentum over the years, and it eventually led to the establishment of Uttarakhand.\n\nThe state of Uttarakhand comprises 13 districts, each contributing to its cultural and geographical diversity. Dehradun was chosen as the temporary capital, and it later became the permanent capital of the state.\n\nThe formation of Uttarakhand aimed to promote balanced regional development, improve governance, and address the unique challenges faced by the hilly terrain. It allowed for more focused planning and administration tailored to the needs of the people in the region.\n\nSince its establishment, Uttarakhand has made progress in various sectors, including tourism, education, and agriculture.
