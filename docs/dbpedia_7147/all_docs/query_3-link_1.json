Bigha (बीघा)\n\nIn Uttarakhand, the Bigha is a traditional unit of land measurement commonly used for agricultural purposes, especially in rural areas. The value of a Bigha can vary significantly from one region to another, and there is no standardized value for the Bigha across the state. The Bigha is a larger unit, and it is often used to measure larger land areas, such as agricultural fields and orchards. It is divided into smaller subunits like Biswa and Biswansi for more precise measurements.\n\nConvert from Bigha into Square Feet, Square Yards or Square Metre\n\nAs mentioned, Bigha is a unit of land measurement here is the overview of measurement of 1 Bigha in different methods.\n\n1 Bigha = 900 sq yards\n\n1 Bigha in Square Feet 8100 Square Feet1 Bigha in Nali 3.75 Nali1 Bigha in Mutthi 60 Mutthi1 Bigha in Acre0.1859 Acres1 Bigha in Biswa 20 Biswa1 Bigha in Square Yards900 Square Yards\n\n5. Acre (एकड़)\n\nAcre is a commonly used unit of land measurement. It is a part of the imperial system of units and is used to measure large land areas, particularly for agricultural and rural purposes. The acre is also used in real estate transactions, land development, and assessing the productivity of agricultural land. For land development and construction projects, acreage plays a vital role in determining the available space for building structures, roads, utilities, and other amenities.\n\nAcre is a unit of land measurement.
