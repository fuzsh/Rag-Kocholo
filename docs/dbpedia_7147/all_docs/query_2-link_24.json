        "text": "A new lake, Satopanth, has formed near Badrinath in Chamoli district of Uttarakhand after the recent rainfall caused debris to flow into Alaknanda river and block it.\n\nThis development had forced the Uttarakhand government to issue high alert to people living on the banks of Alaknanda on Thursday. However, less than 24 hours after the warning, the Uttarakhand government issued a clarification asking people not to panic as Satopanth's water level is normal - which clearly indicates that it was a hasty decision to sound the alarm.\n\nThe Uttarakhand Space Application Centre (USAC) has released a new satellite image of the lake formed near Bhagirath Kharak and Satopanth Glacier, about 8 km from Badrinath. The length of Satopanth lake is about 457 metres and the approximate area of blocked river is 2,553 m2. The Bhagyanu Bank stream carried debris down to Alaknanda and blocked it. In a July 7 satellite image, the lake was observed and a warning signal sent to the state government.\n\nDr M.M. Kimothi, director of USAC, said: \"The good thing is that the water is receding and is not completely blocked. Otherwise it could have turned dangerous. But, continuous monitoring should be done as a precautionary exercise.\" NRSC (ISRO), Hyderabad will be continuously monitoring impoundment of water of the new lake.\n\nAfter USAC circulated the new satellite image to the media, the state government without wasting any time or consulting any experts decided to issue a high alert on Thursday. They asked different district administrations to move people living on the low line areas to safer locations.\n\nadvertisement"
