        "text": "1. Why do I need sunscreen?\n\nIt is the easiest way to protect your skin not just from pollution and UV rays, but also sunburns and diseases such as skin cancer. Brightness, hydration, reducing marks, pigmentation and fine lines - a good sunscreen takes care of them all!\n\n2. How often should I reapply sunscreen?\n\nWhile it is recommended that you reapply sunscreen at least 2-3 times a day, it really depends on your activity levels. Sweat and increased sun exposure can break down the actives making the sunscreen work much faster than when you are indoors and at a desk. This means the more your activity and exposure, the more your need to reapply sunscreen.\n\n3. Does this mean I don’t need sunscreen indoors?\n\nYou need sunscreen even when you’re indoors with your curtains drawn as light and harmful UV rays can penetrate glass just as easily as they can penetrate the ozone layer. Additionally, the blue light emitted by our screens can accelerate signs of skin damage and ageing just as much.\n\n4. Which sunscreen is best matte or dewy?\n\nEvery sunscreen is effective in its own manner. Foxtale’s dewy finish sunscreen is fantastic for those with normal to dry skin types. It gives the face the ideal quantity of hydration. Foxtale's Matte Finish sunscreen is extremely lightweight and provides the perfect matte finish; it is strongly advised for people with oily and acne-prone skin.\n\n5. Does matte sunscreen dry out skin?\n\nNo, Foxtale’s Matte Sunscreen doesn't dry out the skin; it contains Vitamin E (Tocopherol) - A powerful antioxidant that prevents free radical damage, protects skin from pollution and moisturizes the skin.\n\n6. Does matte sunscreen clog pores?\n\nNo, it does not. All of Foxtale’s products are non-comedogenic,i.e., they do not clog pores.\n\n7. How does niacinamide help in sunscreen?\n\nNiacinamide-containing sunscreen is a terrific way to protect and repair your skin. Niacinamide also lessens sebum production, brightens the skin, and lowers the inflammation that UV light causes in the skin.\n\n8. What is the right way to apply sunscreen?\n\nDispense sunscreen along the length of your index and middle fingers – the perfect amount for one wear. Next, gently massage this formula into your face, neck, and the back of your ears. Reapply every 2 hours.\n\n9. How long does it take for the sunscreen to completely absorb into your skin?\n\nStudies show that it takes 15 minutes for sunscreen to completely absorb into your skin and ward off harmful UV rays. Apply two fingers’ worth of your sunscreen and wait 15 to 20 minutes before stepping out in the sun.\n\n10. Can I reapply the mattifying sunscreen over my makeup?\n\nAbsolutely! Dunk your beauty sponge into the matte sunscreen and apply it on your forehead, cheeks, nose, and so forth. Concentrate on covering smaller areas to prevent your makeup from smudging.\n\n11. Can I use the Vitamin C Serum with this mattifying sunscreen?\n\nYes! Studies show that topical application of Vitamin C increases the amount of harmful UV radiations absorbed by your sunscreen.\n\n12. Why should I pick the Matte Finish Sunscreen for oily skin?\n\nOur mattifying sunscreen has been formulated for the oily or combination skin type. Its lightweight, breathable formula regulates sebum and ensures a gorgeous matte finish.\n\n13. What is the best sunscreen for dry skin?\n\nOur Dewy Sunscreen is formulated for the dry skin type. It deeply hydrates and nourishes the skin while ensuring its infallible sun protection. But you may use the matte sunscreen for dry skin if you prefer a gorgeous matte finish instead. The innovative formula helps prevent tan, brightens the dermis and boosts skin health.\n\n14. Will this sunscreen with matte finish lead to flare ups or inflammation?\n\nNo! Foxtale’s potent matte sunscreen doesn’t lead to any irritation or flare-ups. Additionally, our matte sunscreen for oily skin boasts Vitamin B5 and Niacinamide – a duo that offsets irritation, rashes and redness while promoting skin healing.\n\n15. Can I apply sunscreen directly on my face?\n\nWe recommend applying the matte sunscreen only after a thorough cleanse, followed by a generous amount of your moisturizer.\n\n16. Do I need sunscreen on an overcast or rainy day?\n\nAbsolutely. Harmful UV rays from the sun easily pierce the clouds to cause photoaging, pigmentation and more to the skin. This is why we recommend wearing sunscreen daily, regardless of the weather.\n\n17. Can sunscreen lead my skin to break out?\n\nNot anymore! Foxtale’s Matte Finish Sunscreen doesn’t clog pores, not even in the slightest. Additionally, Niacinamide at the heart of the formulation blots excess oil for smooth, radiant skin.\n\n18. Can I sleep with sunscreen on my face?\n\nWe recommend washing away every trace of makeup and SPF before bed. The skin has a circadian rhythm that prioritises repair and rejuvenation when you’re sleeping. It exfoliates dead cells and debris to ensure healthy cellular turnover – which may be inhibited due to sunscreen (or makeup) on the face.\n\n20. Sunscreens usually make my skin dry. Can I try Foxtale’s Mattifying Sunscreen?\n\nAbsolutely, go for it. Our innovative formulation contains D-Panthenol and Niacinamide which create a moisture-retaining barrier on the skin.\n\n21. What is the minimum SPF or Sun Protection Factor required for Indian skin?\n\nExperts suggest Indian skin needs SPF 30 (or more) for optimal sun protection.\n\n22. What is the best matte sunscreen for skin brightening?\n\nTry Foxtale’s Matte Finish Sunscreen STAT. The lightweight formula contains Niacinamide that reduces dark spots and pigmentation for bright skin.\n\n23. Will the Matte Finish Sunscreen make my foundation look chalky or blotchy?\n\nNot at all. Our lightweight formula blends effortlessly into the skin\n\n24. How do I remove sunscreen from my face?\n\nAdd Foxtale’s Hydrating Face Wash cum Makeup Remover to your skincare rotation. It contains gentle surfactants that melt every trace of SPF and makeup while ensuring long-lasting hydration to the skin. No aggressive rubbing or scrubbing is required.\n\n25. What makes Foxtale’s Mattifying Sunscreen stand out?\n\nReasons To Love Foxtale’s Mattifying Sunscreen\n\nLightweight and breathable\n\nDoesn’t clog pores\n\nOil control formula\n\nBrightens skin\n\nDoesn’t leave a white cast or residue\n\nMaximum protection against UVA and UVB rays\n\nWhy Do You Need A Matte Finish Sunscreen?\n\nDoes applying sunscreen make your face extremely greasy? If yes – Foxtale’s Mattifying Sunscreen should be on your wish list. Formulated for oily, combination and acne-prone skin types, our Matte Finish Sunscreen contains skincare workhorse Niacinamide. The versatile active blots excess sebum and prevents clogged pores while brightening your skin. Plus, the gorgeous matte finish this SPF bestows on the skin is chef kisses!\n\nWhat Are Some Sunscreen Terms You Should Know\n\nBefore carting this exceptional sunscreen with matte finish, here are the different value markers your should find on the label.\n\nSPF: SPF or Sun Protection Factor gauges the level of protection offered against UVB rays. Our mattifying sunscreen boasts SPF 70 that blocks 98.76% of harmful UVB radiation – perfect for your daily skincare.\n\nPA: PA determines the grade of protection offered by the sunscreen against UVA. Luckily, our Matte Finish sunscreen has a value marker of PA++++ that guarantees maximum safeguarding.\n\nBroad Spectrum Sunscreen: A broad-spectrum sunscreen shields your skin against both UVA and UVB radiation.\n\nHow To Wear Sunscreen\n\nTo make the most of your sunscreen, you need to apply it correctly. Follow these steps for 360-degree sun protection for your skin.\n\nCleanse: Before whipping out your Matte Finish Sunscreen, ensure that your face is thoroughly cleansed. If you grapple with dry or sensitive skin, we recommend the Hydrating Face Wash with Hyaluronic Acid for the job. The gentle formula dislodges dirt, grime, and impurities from the skin while ensuring deep hydration. For folks with oily or combination skin, we recommend Foxtale’s Acne Control Face Wash with Salicylic Acid for best results.\n\nTreat: Once your skin is dry, dab a result-oriented serum onto your skin. Foxtale carries a range of high-performing serums that guarantee swift and long-lasting results. Try our Vitamin C serum for dark spots and pigmentation, Niacinamide Serum for skin brightening, Retinol Anti-Ageing Serum for fine lines, wrinkles and so forth.\n\nMoisturize: Preserve your skin’s moisture content with a potent moisturizer. This formulation creates a protective barrier on the dermis, preventing transepidermal water loss. Try Foxtale’s Hydrating Moisturizer with Ceramides for dry and sensitive skin. For oily and combination skin, we recommend our in-house Oil Free Moisturizer.\n\nSun Protect: Next, take two fingers’ worth of the Matte Finish Sunscreen and gently apply it on your face, neck, back of the ears and more. Since it takes approximately 20 minutes for sunscreen to absorb into the skin – we recommend applying it a wee bit before stepping outdoors.\n\nWhat Are Some Tips And Tricks To Ensure Sun Protection\n\nDon’t be stingy with sunscreen. Apply 2 fingers’ worth (30 ml) of the formula on your face and neck.\n\nDon’t rely on only sunscreen. To minimize sun induced damage, we recommend wearing caps, hats or scarves too.\n\nYou need to wear sunscreen even if your makeup has SPF.\n\nApply 15 to 20 minutes before sun exposure.\n\nReapply every 2 hours when outdoors. If you are wearing makeup – dunk a sponge in the mattifying sunscreen and dab it on your face.\n\nIf your legs and arms are exposed, ensure to cover them with a generous amount of sunscreen as well.\n\nGoes without saying, wear sunscreen while at the pool, on the beach and for every outdoorsy activity."
