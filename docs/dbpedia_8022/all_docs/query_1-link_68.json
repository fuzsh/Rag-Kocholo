        "text": "Synthesis\n\nThe compound, 2-chloro-4,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-triazine (50 g, 187 mmol) was dissolved in THF (1 L) under a nitrogen environment, (4-bromophenyl)boronic acid (45 g, 224.12 mmol, Aldrich Corporation), and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (2.1 g, 1.87 mmol) were added thereto, and the mixture was stirred. Potassium carbonate saturated in water (64 g, 467 mmol) was added thereto, and the obtained mixture was heated and refluxed at 80Â° C. for 12 hours. When the reaction was complete, water was added to the reaction solution, and the mixture was extracted with dichloromethane (DCM) and then, filtered after removing moisture with anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated under a reduced pressure. This obtained residue was separated and purified through flash column chromatography to obtain 2-(4-bromophenyl)-4,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-triazine (70 g and 96%)."
