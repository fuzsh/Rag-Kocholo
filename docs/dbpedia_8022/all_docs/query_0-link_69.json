        "text": "Journal scope\n\nRSC Advances papers should provide an insight that advances the chemistry field. Papers that contain little or no chemistry and are not considered to be of interest or relevance to the chemistry community are not within the scope of the journal.\n\nThe criteria for publication are that the work must be high quality, well conducted and advance the development of the field. Articles submitted to the journal are evaluated by our international team of associate editors and reviewers for the overall quality and accuracy of the science presented.\n\nA small number of topic areas have their own additional requirements:\n\nMolecular docking studies should include some physical or experimental validation. Studies that screen a molecule against a set of receptors with no link to physical or experimental data are not suitable for publication.\n\nPurely computational studies on the properties of materials not yet experimentally characterized should include a discussion of the reasons why these materials are potentially interesting for the chemistry community, as well as commenting on their synthetic feasibility. Calculations demonstrating synthetic feasibility should be performed where possible.\n\nPlease ensure you have considered the following points before submitting your manuscript.\n\nDoes the work present an advance over the existing literature? Please supply a covering letter with your submission to demonstrate how the work is advancing the field over the existing literature\n\nHave you provided sufficient evidence/data to support your conclusions?\n\nHave you provided adequate characterisation data for your materials/compounds? (Please check the supporting information section to ensure that the necessary requirements have been met and copies of relevant spectra have been provided where necessary)\n\nAre the results discussed in the context of the literature?\n\nAre the references relevant and do they appropriately reflect the existing literature?\n\nArticle processing charges and licensing\n\nFollowing our peer review process, if the article is accepted, the article processing charges below will be applied to your article. There are no submission charges for RSC Advances.\n\n*15% RSC member and R&P Institution discount available. Applicable to full price only.\n\n**Applicable tax will be added to the stated price.\n\nDiscounts and waivers\n\nUse our journal finder to check if your APC is covered by an institutional agreement with us. Note, if your institution has an agreement with us that covers APCs, you will be notified of this at article acceptance.\n\nDiscounts and waivers are also available on an individual basis. Find out more about applying for a waiver.\n\nCorresponding authors who are not already members of the Royal Society of Chemistry are entitled to one year’s Affiliate membership as part of their APC. Find out more about our member benefits.\n\nAs part of the submission process, authors will be asked to agree to the RSC Advances open access terms & conditions.\n\nWe offer RSC Advances authors a choice of two Creative Commons licences, CC-BY or CC-BY-NC. Publication under these licenses means that authors retain copyright of their article, but allows users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of articles, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without asking prior permission from the publisher or the author. Read our open access statement for further information.\n\nAll published articles are deposited with LOCKSS, CLOCKSS, Portico and the British Library for archiving.\n\nRead more information about APC pricing for all RSC journals\n\nPeer review process\n\nAll submissions to RSC Advances are handled by our team of associate editors, who are established scientists actively working in research. All articles published in the journal have been through the full peer review process.\n\nThe general process for handling manuscripts is as follows:\n\nPhase 1: Manuscripts are assigned to an associate editor with knowledge and expertise in the area. They carry out an initial assessment to ensure the manuscript meets the basic journal criteria (please see the scope section).\n\nPhase 2: If the manuscript passes the initial assessment the associate editor sends the manuscript for peer review. Associate editors have the option to write their own reviewer report on manuscripts they handle, if they choose to do this they will prepare their report in parallel to the external reviewer who may be either a standard reviewer for the journal or a member of the review panel (see below).\n\nIf the manuscript does not pass the initial assessment it is rejected from the journal.\n\nPhase 3: Once both reviewer reports are submitted the associate editor will consider the reports and make a decision on the manuscript. If the reports are conflicting or no clear decision can be made, an adjudicating reviewer will be consulted.\n\nTransparent peer review\n\nAs part of our commitment to transparency and open science, RSC Advances is now offering authors the option of transparent peer review, where the editor’s decision letter, reviewers’ comments and authors’ response for all versions of the manuscript will be published alongside the article under an Open Access Creative Commons licence (CC-BY).\n\nReviewers will remain anonymous unless they choose to sign their report.\n\nFind out more about our transparent peer review policy and read our Editorial on transparent peer review in RSC Advances.\n\nRSC Advances Reviewer Panel\n\nRSC Advances has a dedicated reviewer panel made up of expert reviewers from across the chemical sciences and at all career stages. All members of the reviewer panel work within our terms of reference and we are always happy to consider new applications, particularly from early career researchers and under-represented groups. To apply to join the panel please follow the instructions to become a reviewer.\n\nSupporting information\n\nExperimental information must be provided to enable other researchers to accurately reproduce the work. Figures should include error bars where appropriate, and results should be accompanied by analyses of experimental uncertainty. The experimental details and the characterisation data should preferably be provided as supplementary information (SI) although on occasion it may be appropriate to include some or all of this within the body of the article. This will depend on the nature of the research being reported.\n\nWork that reports new methodology should be applied to existing compounds or materials that have been synthesised by a previous route, to clearly demonstrate how the new method is better than previous procedures.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the author(s) to provide the reviewers with the necessary information to evaluate the merit of the manuscript in terms of its scientific content. Failure to provide the necessary experimental evidence and data may result in the manuscript being withdrawn by the editor."
