        "text": "This application is a continuation of copending U.S. application Ser. No. 08/061,905, filed May 14, 1993.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n1. Field of the Invention\n\nThis invention relates to the preparation of at least bis-carbamate functional 1,3,5-triazines from amino-1,3,5-triazines and organic carbonates in the presence of a base, as well as to certain novel carbamates producible thereby.\n\n2. Description of Related Art\n\nVarious derivatives of amino-1,3,5-triazines are described in the literature as being utilized in a wide variety of fields. An important use of certain of these derivatives, such as the methoxymethyl derivatives of melamine and guanamines, is as crosslinkers and/or reactive modifiers in curable compositions based upon active hydrogen groups-containing resins. While these methoxymethyl derivatives provide excellent results in a number of aspects, one disadvantage to their use is that, under curing conditions, formaldehyde is released as a volatile by-product. It has, therefore, been a desire of industry to find an acceptable alternative for these well-known amino-1,3,5-triazine derivatives which do not emit formaldehyde upon cure.\n\nOne such alternative which has shown great promise is the carbamate functional 1,3,5-triazines which are disclosed in commonly owned U.S. Pat. No. 4,939,213, U.S. Pat. No. 5,084,541, U.S. application Ser. No. 07/968,871 (filed Oct. 30, 1992, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 07/793,077, filed Nov. 15, 1991 and now abandoned), and U.S. application Ser. No. 07/998,313 (filed Dec. 29, 1992), all of which are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth. Specifically, the carbamate functional 1,3,5-triazines disclosed in these references have been found to be particularly useful as crosslinkers in coating compositions based upon hydroxy functional resins, with the cured coatings possessing a wide range of desirable film and resistance properties.\n\nOne hinderance to the commercial use of these carbamate functional 1,3,5-triazines has been that the known preparation methods can be somewhat cumbersome, difficult and expensive. For example, in previously mentioned U.S. Pat. No. 4,939,213 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,084,541, the 1,3,5-triazine carbamates are produced in a two-step process by first reacting an amino-1,3,5-triazine with oxalyl chloride to produce an isocyanate functional intermediate, then reacting this intermediate with an alcohol. The primary disadvantages to this process include the use of a halogenated starting material, the handling of an isocyanate functional intermediate, the production of halogenated by-products and the low ultimate yield of the desired carbamate functional product.\n\nFurther, in previously mentioned U.S. application Ser. No. 07/968,671, the carbamate functional 1,3,5-triazines are produced in a one-step process by reacting a haloaminotriazine with an acid halide. The primary disadvantages to this process include the use of halogenated starting materials and the production of halogenated by-products.\n\nIt has now been surprisingly discovered after extensive research that at least bis-carbamate functional 1,3,5-triazines can be readily produced with high selectivity and in excellent yields by the reaction of (a) at least diamino-1,3,5-triazines and (b) acyclic organic carbonates in the presence of relatively strong bases.\n\nIt should be noted that it is generically known to obtain carbamates via the reaction of amines with carbonates. It is, however, well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art that the amine functionality of amino-1,3,5-triazines (such as the amine functionality of melamines and guanamines) is not equivalent to the other types of typical amine functionality. Indeed, melamines and guanamines are among the least reactive of the \"amines\" and the most difficult to functionalize, and their behavior cannot normally be correlated to that of other known amines, even structurally similar amines such as pyrimidines.\n\nFor example, most \"typical\" amines are highly reactive with acid halides. In a publication by E. M. Smolin and L. Rapaport entitled \"S-Triazines and Derivatives,\" Interscience Publishers Inc., New York, page 333 (1959), however, it is reported that attempts to react an acid halide with the amino group on a 1,3,5-triazine such as melamine have not been successful.\n\nFurther, attempts to functionalize amino-1,3,5-triazines often results in substitution at the nitrogen on the triazine ring. For example, it is known that the reaction of melamine with alkyl halides, such as allyl chloride, results in alkyl substitution at the nitrogen on the triazine ring resulting in isomelamine derivatives.\n\nTo date, a disclosure has not been found whereby an at least bis-carbamate functional 1,3,5-triazine has been prepared from an at least diamino-1,3,5-triazine and an organic carbonate. While several references appear to generically disclose (among other techniques) that mono-carbamate 1,3,5-triazines can be prepared by the reaction of a mono-amino 1,3,5-triazine and an organic carbonate (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,017,212, 4,5795,83, 4,878,938, 4,480,101, and 4,804,957, and PCT Unexamined Application No. 9206965), no specific example could be found in these references of any mono-carbamate 1,3,5-triazine actually having been so prepared. The only disclosure found exemplifying a mono-carbamate 1,3,5-triazine produced from a monoamino-1,3,5-triazine and an organic carbonate is in Research Disclosure, Vol. 275, p. 162 (1987).\n\nQuite relevant to the surprising nature of the present invention is an unsuccessful attempt to prepare a 1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-tris-carbamate from an amino triazine and ethyl chloroformate (a potential precursor component of an organic carbonate), which is reported in an article by H. Kitajima et al in Yuki Gosei Kagaku Kyokai Shi, Volume 32, Number 9, page 723-26 (1974) (Chemical Abstracts, Volume 82, Number 11:72946). Instead of producing the desired tris-carbamate, the authors reported the formation of an imide via diacylation of the amino groups. Similarly, the reaction of benzoguanamine with ethyl chloroformate produces N,N-diethoxycarbonyl benzoguanamine. Such imide functional compounds are unsuitable as crosslinking agents. Similar results are also reported in Rec. Trav. Chim., Vol. 81, pages 241-254 (1962).\n\nIn fact, it is clearly surprising in light of the state of the art that at least bis-functional carbamate derivatives can be produced with high selectivity and yield from the at least diamino-1,3,5-triazines via the present inventive process, as described in detail below.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nAs indicated above, the present invention includes a process for preparing an at least bis-carbamate functional 1,3,5-triazine by contacting, at a temperature and for a length of time sufficient to produce the at least bis-carbamate functional 1,3,5-triazine, a mixture comprising:\n\n(a) an at least diamino-1,3,5-triazine represented by the formula: ##STR1## whereinZ is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, hydrocarbyl, a group represented by the formula NHQ, and a group represented by the formula: ##STR2## whereinA is an n-functional anchor,\n\nn is at least 2, and\n\neach Q is independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, a hydrocarbyl and a hydrocarbyloxy hydrocarbyl, with the proviso that at least two of the Q groups are hydrogen;\n\n(b) an acyclic organic carbonate; and\n\n(c) a base.\n\nAs indicated above, the advantages of the present process include, for example:\n\n(1) the present process does not require handling of an isocyanate intermediate;\n\n(2) the present process can be utilized without corrosive halogenated starting materials and without the production of halogenated by-products;\n\n(3) each amino nitrogen of the amino 1,3,5-triazine starting material is substituted only once, producing at least bis-carbamate functional 1,3,5-triazines capable of use as crosslinking agents; and\n\n(4) the desired at least bis-carbamate 1,3,5-triazines can readily be produced with high selectivity and in excellent yields.\n\nIn addition, the present process allows the production of certain novel at least bis-carbamate 1,3,5-triazines which also form a part of the present invention. A first class of these novel at least bis-carbamate 1,3,5-triazines have the following general formula: ##STR3## whereinZ' is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, hydrocarbyl, a group represented by the formula NHQ', and a group represented by the formula: ##STR4## whereinA is an n-functional anchor,\n\nn is at least 2,\n\neach Q' is independently selected from the group consisting of a hydrocarbyl, a hydrocarbyloxy hydrocarbyl and a group represented by the formula COOY, with the proviso that at least two of the Q' groups are COOY, and\n\neach Y is independently selected from the group consisting of a hydrocarbyl group and a hydrocarbyloxy hydrocarbyl ether group, with the proviso that at least one Y group is a hydrocarbyloxy hydrocarbyl ether group.\n\nA second class of these novel at least bis-carbamate functional 1,3,5-triazines also have the above general formula,\n\nwherein\n\nZ' is selected from the group consisting of a group represented by the formula NHQ', and a group represented by the formula: ##STR5## whereinA is an n-functional anchor,\n\nn is at least 2,\n\neach Q' is independently selected from the group consisting of a hydrocarbyl, a hydrocarbyloxy hydrocarbyl and a group represented by the formula COOY, with the proviso that (i) at least two of the Q' groups are COOY and (ii) at least one of the Q' groups is other than COOY, and\n\neach Y is independently a hydrocarbyl group or a hydrocarbyloxy hydrocarbyl ether group.\n\nAnother important aspect of the present invention is that the process can be conducted under substantially halogen free conditions; consequently, the resulting products can be made substantially free of halogen contamination (and particularly chlorine). In other words, it is possible via the use of the present process to provide substantially halogen-free crosslinker compositions comprising the at least bis-carbamate functional 1,3,5-triazines, and to formulate curable compositions comprising these halogen free crosslinker compositions.\n\nThese and other features and advantages of the present invention will be more readily understood by those of ordinary skill in the art from a reading of the following detailed description.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS THE AMINO-1,3,5-TRIAZINE\n\nAs indicated above, the amino-1,3,5-triazines suitable for use in the present invention include those represented by the formula: ##STR6## whereinZ is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, hydrocarbyl, a group represented by the formula NHQ, and a group represented by the formula: ##STR7## whereinA is an n-functional anchor,\n\nn is at least 2, and\n\neach Q is independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, a hydrocarbyl and a hydrocarbyloxy hydrocarbyl, with the proviso that at least two of the Q groups are hydrogen.\n\nThe term \"hydrocarbyl\" in the context of the invention is defined as a group which contains exclusively carbon and hydrogen atoms and includes, for example, alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, alkenyl, and substituted derivatives thereof.\n\nThe term \"amino-1,3,5-triazine\" in the context of the invention refers to derivatives of 4-substituted-2,6-diamino-1,3,5-triazines and 2,4,6-triamino-1,3,5-triazines. The term \"amino-1,3,5-triazine\" does not, however, include monoamino-1,3,5-triazines which, being monofunctional, are incapable of producing at least bis-carbamate functional 1,3,5-triazines suitable for use as crosslinking agents.\n\nThe group A in the above formula is an n-functional anchor which can, for example, be a hydrocarbon residue, an amino compound residue, oxygen or sulfur. More preferably, the amino-1,3,5-triazines including the group A have the following general formula ##STR8## whereinB is selected from the group consisting of a hydrocarbyl and a hydrocarbyloxy hydrocarbyl,\n\neach X is independently selected from the group consisting of NH, NL, CH2, O, S and CO2,\n\nL is selected from a hydrocarbyl and a hydrocarbyloxy hydrocarbyl,\n\nn is at least 2, and\n\nQ' is as defined above.\n\nThe preferred 4-substituted-2,6-diamino-1,3,5-triazines are those represented by the above general formula wherein Z is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and a hydrocarbyl, and more preferably from the group consisting of an alkyl of 1 to 20 carbon atoms, alkenyl of 3 to 20 carbon atoms, aryl of 6 to 20 carbon atoms, and aralkyl of 7 to 20 carbon atoms. Most preferably, the 4-substituted-2,6-diamino-1,3,5-triazines are guanamines such as acetoguanamine, ethyl carboguanamine, propyl carboguanamine, butyl carboguanamine, cyclohexyl carboguanamine and benzoguanamine.\n\nThe preferred 2,4,6-triamino-1,3,5-triazines are those represented by the above general formula wherein Z is NHQ. Most preferred are those wherein all Q groups are hydrogen, that is, melamine.\n\nTHE ACYCLIC ORGANIC CARBONATE\n\nA wide variety of acyclic organic carbonates are suitable for use in the process of the present invention. The term \"acyclic\" in the context of the invention is meant to exclude the cyclic carbonates such as alkylene carbonates (for example ethylene carbonate), but specifically include other carbonates containing cyclic functionality such as those described below.\n\nIn preferred embodiments, the acyclic organic carbonates are represented by the formula:\n\nR.sup.1 (CO.sub.3) R.sup.2\n\nwherein R1 and R2 are independently selected from a hydrocarbyl group and a hydrocarbyloxy hydrocarbyl ether group. As hydrocarbyl groups may be mentioned aryl, alkyl, aralkyl and alkenyl groups. As hydrocarbyloxy hydrocarbyl ether groups may be mention alkoxy alkyl ether and alkoxy aryl ether groups. Preferred among the acyclic organic carbonates are diaryl carbonates, dialkyl carbonates, aryl alkyl carbonates and dialkenyl carbonate.\n\nAs examples of diaryl carbonates may be mentioned those wherein each of R1 and R2 in the above formula is independently an aryl group of 6 to 20 carbon atoms. Specific examples include diphenyl carbonate, di-(para-tolyl) carbonate, di-(para-chlorophenyl) carbonate, di-(pentachlorophenyl) carbonate, di-(alpha-naphthyl) carbonate, di-(beta-naphthyl) carbonate, and mixed diaryl carbonates such as phenyl para-chlorophenyl carbonate and the like.\n\nAs examples of dialkyl carbonates may be mentioned those wherein each of R1 and R2 in the above formula is independently an alkyl group of 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and preferably 1 to 4 atoms. Specific examples of such dialkyl carbonates include dimethyl carbonate, diethyl carbonate, dipropyl carbonate, dibutyl carbonate, methyl butyl carbonate, and the like.\n\nAs examples of aryl alkyl carbonates may be mentioned those wherein one R1 and R2 in the above formula is an aryl group as defined above, and the other is an alkyl group as also defined above. Specific examples of such aryl alkyl carbonates include methyl phenyl carbonate and butyl phenyl carbonate.\n\nAs examples of dialkenyl carbonates may be mentioned those wherein each of R1 and R2 in the above formula is independently an alkenyl group of 3 to 20 carbon atoms. A specific example of such a dialkenyl carbonate is diallyl carbonate.\n\nEspecially preferred of the above include dimethyl carbonate, diethyl carbonate, dibutyl carbonate, methyl butyl carbonate, diphenyl carbonate and mixtures thereof.\n\nA large number of these organic carbonates are generally commercially available and usable as such. They may also by prepared by methods well known in the art including the following:\n\n(a) alkylation of alkali metal carbonates with alkyl halides, disclosed in JP 55-038,327; Chem.

Abstr. 118:168692f.\n\n(f) reaction of an alcohol with carbon dioxide and selected hydrocarbyl halides in the presence of nitrogen-containing bases, disclosed in EP-A-511948; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,200,547.\n\nAll of the above-mentioned references are incorporated by reference herein as if fully set forth.\n\nIn the process of the invention, any of the methods described above may be used to prepare an organic carbonate in situ for reaction with an amino-1,3,5-triazine. Thus, for example, dibutyl carbonate or methyl butyl carbonate or a mixture thereof may be prepared by contacting dimethyl carbonate with butanol (i) in the presence of a base, and thereafter contacting the resulting mixture with an amino-1,3,5-triazine, or (ii) in the presence of both the base and the amino-1,3,5-triazine, to produce an at least bis-carbamate functional 1,3,5-triazine in accordance with the process of this invention.\n\nTHE BASE\n\nIn the practice of the invention, a relatively strong base is used. It is preferred that such base be of sufficient strength to deprotonate the amino groups (QâH) of the chosen amino-1,3,5-triazine on reaction with the organic carbonate. Without being bound by any structure or theory, it is believed that bases which are capable of deprotonating these amino groups are more effective in accelerating the rate of reaction of the amino-1,3,5-triazine with the organic carbonate than bases which do not readily do so. Based upon the choice of starting amino-1,3,5-triazine, one of ordinary skill in the art will readily be able to determine which bases are capable of so-deprotonating the amino groups of the amino-1,3,5-triazines.\n\nAs preferred examples of suitable bases may be mentioned alkali metal hydrides, alkali metal alkoxides, alkali metal hydroxides, alkali metal oxides, alkali metal carbonates, quaternary ammonium alkoxides, quaternary ammonium hydroxides, quaternary phosphonium alkoxides, quaternary phosphonium hydroxides, tertiary amines and mixtures thereof. Sodium and potassium alkoxides are most preferred, and include linear, branched and cyclic alkyl group containing alkoxides and mixtures thereof.\n\nSpecific examples of the preferred bases include sodium hydride, potassium hydride, sodium butoxide, potassium butoxide, sodium methoxide, potassium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, potassium ethoxide, sodium propoxide, potassium propoxide, sodium beta-hydroxyethoxide, potassium beta-hydroxyethoxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium oxide, potassium oxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, benzyl trimethylammonium methoxide, benzyl trimethylammonium hydroxide, methyl triphenylphosphonium methoxide, triphenylphosphonium hydroxide, triethylamine, N-methyl-di-isopropylamine, tri-n-butylamine, tri-n-octylamine, 1,4-diazabicyclo(2.2.2)octane (DABCO), 1,5-diazabicyclo(4.3.0)non-5-ene(DBN), 1,8-diazabicyclo(5.4.0)undec-7-ene(DBU), N-methylpyrrolidine, N-methylpiperidine, N-methylmorpholine, N,N-dimethylpiperazine, pentamethyl guanidine, 2,6-1utidine, 2,4,6-collidine and mixtures thereof.\n\nIt is also preferred that the base does not destroy the organic carbonate at a rate sufficiently high to compete with the reaction of the carbonate with the amino-1,3,5-triazine. In cases where the organic carbonate may be partially destroyed by the base, the use of excess amounts of the organic carbonate ensures a high conversion to the carbamate.\n\nPROCESS CONDITIONS\n\nIn the process of the present invention, the amino-1,3,5-triazine, organic carbonate and base are contacted at a temperature and a length of time sufficient to produce the desired at least bis-carbamate functional 1,3,5-triazine.\n\nThe components are preferably contacted at temperatures in the range of from about 0Â° C. to about 150Â° C., and more preferably in the range of from about 25Â° C. to about 100Â° C. At these temperatures and depending upon the starting components, substantially complete conversion has been found to occur in a period of time ranging from about ten minutes to about ten hours. After completion of the reaction, the resulting mixture is neutralized with, for example, a mineral acid such as phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid and/or hydrochloric acid. Organic acids and ion exchange resins may optionally be utilized for the neutralization.\n\nThe resulting at least bis-carbamate functional 1,3,5-triazine can be recovered from the reaction by, for example, first extracting with an organic solvent, and thereafter either evaporating the solvent or precipitating the product by addition of a nonsolvent.\n\nThe contacting of the components of the reaction mixture may be simultaneous or sequential..When simultaneous, contacting is carried out by adding all components of the mixture to the reaction zone at the same time or premixing them prior to the addition, and thereafter allowing the components of the mixture to react at the desired temperature. When sequential, either of the following three procedures can be envisioned:\n\n(i) the amino-1,3,5-triazine and the base are first contacted and, thereafter, the organic carbonate is contacted;\n\n(ii) the organic carbonate and the base are first contacted and, thereafter, the amino-1,3,5-triazine is contacted; and\n\n(iii) the amino-1,3,5-triazine and the organic carbonate are first contacted and, thereafter, the base is contacted.\n\nWhen the organic carbonate and the base are contacted, an exchange between the base and the organic carbonate may take place prior to reaction with the amino-1,3,5-triazine. For example, when dimethyl carbonate and sodium butoxide are contacted, an alkoxy exchange reaction may take place to give, depending on the relative amount of the alkoxide, dibutyl carbonate, methyl butyl carbonate or a mixture thereof. The organic carbonates formed in situ in this manner are usable in the process of the invention, as are organic carbonates prepared in situ by any of the methods of preparation of organic carbonates described hereinabove in section entitled \"THE ORGANIC CARBONATE\". A base catalyzed exchange between the carbonate and an appropriate solvent (such as an alcohol or hydroxyether solvent) may additionally take place. Most importantly, an exchange between the carbamate product and the base or solvent may also take place, particularly when contacting is carried out over a longer period of time.\n\nThe reaction may be carried out in a reaction medium to obtain uniform reaction. The reaction may be carded out either as a homogeneous solution or as a slurry. A reactant or a mixture of reactants may also serve as the reaction medium, particularly if used in excess quantities. The reaction medium typically is a solvent for the reactants, and includes organic solvents such as alcohol, ether, N,N-dialkylformamide, amide and hydrocarbon solvents, as well as mixtures thereof. Alcohol solvents are preferred and include methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, pentanol, hexanol, ethylene glycol, 1,2-propylene glycol, 1,3-propylene glycol, 1,4-butylene glycol, 2,3-butylene glycol, isomers thereof as well as mixtures thereof. Ether solvents are also preferred and include, for example, dialkyl ethers, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane and glycol diethers. It is preferred to run the reaction in the substantial absence of water, although the presence of some water may be tolerated.\n\nThe amounts of the various ingredients usable in the process of the invention depends on the number of -NH2 groups present in the amino-1,3,5-triazine. At least one equivalent of the organic carbonate per -NH2 group is required to completely convert the -NH2 groups to carbamate functionality; however, more than an equivalent is preferred to ensure high conversion. The amount of base required for reaction is at least a third of an equivalent per -NH2. Preferably, however, at least one equivalent, and more preferably greater than one equivalent, is used to ensure high conversion.\n\nTHE 1,3,5-TRIAZINE CARBAMATES\n\nThis invention provides a process for preparing both known and novel at least bis-carbamate functional 1,3,5-triazines. Generically, these at least bis-carbamate functional 1,3,5-triazines which may be prepared by the process of this invention are represented by the general formula: ##STR9## whereinZ' is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, hydrocarbyl, a group represented by the formula NHQ', and a group represented by the formula ##STR10## whereinA is an n-functional anchor,\n\nn is at least 2,\n\neach Q' is independently selected from the group consisting of a hydrocarbyl, a hydrocarbyloxy hydrocarbyl and a group represented by the formula COOY, with the proviso that a least two of the Q' groups are COOY, and\n\neach Y is independently a hydrocarbyl group or a hydrocarbyloxy hydrocarbyl ether group.\n\nAmong the novel at least bis-carbamate functional 1,3,5-triazines include, for example, those of the above general formula\n\n(i) wherein Z' is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, hydrocarbyl, a group represented by the formula NHQ', and a group represented by the formula: ##STR11## whereinA is an n-functional anchor,\n\nn is at least 2,\n\neach Q' is independently selected from the group consisting of a hydrocarbyl, a hydrocarbyloxy hydrocarbyl and a group represented by the formula COOY, with the proviso that at least two of the Q' groups are COOY, and\n\neach Y is independently selected from the group consisting of a hydrocarbyl group and a hydrocarbyloxy hydrocarbyl ether group, with the proviso that at least one Y group is a hydrocarbyloxy hydrocarbyl ether group; and\n\n(ii) wherein Z' is selected from the group consisting of a group represented by the formula NHQ', and a group represented by the formula: ##STR12## whereinA is an n-functional anchor,\n\nn is at least 2,\n\neach Q' is independently selected from the group consisting of a hydrocarbyl, a hydrocarbyloxy hydrocarbyl and a group represented by the formula COOY, with the proviso that (i) at least two of the Q' groups are COOY and (ii) at least one of the Q' groups is other than COOY, and\n\neach Y is independently a hydrocarbyl group or a hydrocarbyloxy hydrocarbyl ether group.\n\nOne group of preferred compounds are those wherein each Y is independently a hydrocarbyl group selected from an alkyl of 1 to 20 carbon atoms, alkenyl of 3 to 20 carbon atoms, aryl of 6 to 20 carbon atoms, and aralkyl of 7 to 20 carbon atoms.\n\nAnother group of preferred compounds are those wherein each Y is independently a hydrocarbyloxy hydrocarbyl ether group with both hydrocarbyl portions thereof being selected from an alkyl of 1 to 20 carbon atoms, alkenyl of 3 to 20 carbon atoms, aryl of 6 to 20 carbon atoms, and aralkyl of 7 to 20 carbon atoms.\n\nYet another preferred group of compounds are those wherein at least one Y group is a hydrocarbyl as defined above, and at least one Y group is a hydrocarbyloxy hydrocarbyl ether group as also defined above.\n\nAs indicated earlier, the at least bis-carbamate functional 1,3,5-triazines which can be made according to the present invention have utility, for example, as crosslinking agents for hydroxy functional and amino functional resins in curable compositions such as coatings and adhesive compositions. Curable compositions based upon carbamate functional 1,3,5-triazines are discussed in detail in a number of the previously incorporated references.\n\nAn important advantage of the present process is that the resulting products can be made free of halogens (and particularly chlorine).

At the end of the two hour period, the mixture was cooled and poured into a methylene chloride (50 ml)/2N sulfuric acid (25 ml) mixture. The methylene chloride layer was washed with a saturated sodium chloride solution, dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure to yield 1.74 g (82.8%) of a product, whose structure was confirmed by 1 H NMR to be 2,4,6-tris-butoxycarbonylamino-1,3,5-triazine.\n\nEXAMPLE 2\n\nA slurry of melamine (0.6179 g, 0.0049 mol) and dry dimethyl carbonate (5.22 g, 0.058 mol) was heated to 90Â° C. under a dry argon blanket.

After 5 minutes of heating, an almost clear solution was obtained. The reaction mixture was heated for about 30 minutes and then allowed to cool at room temperature. It was then poured into ice-cold 100 ml of 5% aq. Hcl with stirring. The reaction mixture was extracted with CH2 Cl2 (2Ã60 ml). The combined organic layer was washed with water (2Ã25 ml), dried over anhydrous Na2 SO4 and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure to give 3.95 g of crude product. TLC analysis of the crude product showed the presence of a major and a minor product.

The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for about an hour. The reaction flask contained a white precipitate at this stage. The reaction mixture was added, with stirring, to 400 ml of an ice-cold 5% aq. Hcl to completely dissolve the precipitate. The resulting solution was extracted with CH2 CI2 (2Ã250 ml), the organic layer was washed with water (2Ã100 ml), dried over Na2 SO4, filtered and the solvent removed under reduced pressure to give 23.2 g of a residue containing mainly N,N'-bis-methoxycarbonyl-cyclohexylcarboguanamine as indicated by its mass spectrum.\n\nEXAMPLE 11\n\nThe procedure of Example 8 was repeated with 1.87 g of benzoguanamine, 3.0 ml of diethylcarbonate, and 9.3 ml of 21% sodium ethoxide in ethanol to produce 2.95 gm of crude N,N'-bis-ethoxycarbonylbenzoguanamine as indicated by its mass spectrum.\n\nEXAMPLE 12\n\n18.7 g of benzoguanamine was allowed to react with 21.0 ml of dimethyl carbonate in the presence of 57.0 ml of 25% sodium methoxide solution in methanol at room temperature for nearly 6 hours. The addition of the reaction mixture to 300 ml of ice-cold 5% aq. Hcl resulted in the formation of a white precipitate which was filtered and washed with water. The filtrate was extracted with CH2 Cl2 and the combined organic layer washed with water (2Ã200 ml), dried (Na2 SO4) and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to remove the volatiles and the residue was treated with 300 ml of n-hexane/CH2 Cl2 (10:1). A white precipitate was formed which was filtered, washed with n-hexane and dried. The product was identified by mass spectroscopy to be mainly N,N'-bis-methoxycarbonylbenzoguanamine.\n\nEXAMPLE 13\n\n25.0 g of acetoguanamine was reacted at room temperature with 40.4 ml of dimethylcarbonate in the presence of 110.0 ml of 25% sodium methoxide solution in methanol.

It was extracted with CH2 Cl2 (2Ã400 ml), the organic layer washed with water (2Ã100 ml), dried over Na2 SO4, filtered and the solvent removed under reduced pressure. The crude product was stirred with 350 ml n-hexane for 2 hours at room temperature and the precipitate formed was filtered, washed with n-hexane and dried under reduced pressure to give 16 g of a product identified by 1 H and 13 C NMR and mass spectroscopy to be N,N'-bis-methoxycarbonylacetoguanamine.\n\nEXAMPLE 14\n\nA slurry of melamine (0.622 g, 0.0049 mol) and dry dimethyl carbonate (1.42 g, 0.17 mol) was heated to 90Â° C. under a dry argon blanket. A 20% solution of sodium n-butoxide in butanol (5.5 g, 0.01 mol of sodium n-butoxide) was added to the slurry at 90Â° C.\n\nHeating was continued for four hours. The reaction mixture was acidified and extracted with methylene chloride. The methylene chloride layer was concentrated under reduced pressure to afford the product. HPLC and mass spectral analysis of the reaction mixture showed that it contained a mixture of tris-carbamate products: 2,4,6-tris-butoxycarbonylamino-1,3,5-triazine, 2,4-bis-butoxycarbonylamino-6-methoxycarbonylamino-1,3,5-triazine, and 2-butoxycarbonylamino-4,6-bis-methoxycarbonylamino-1,3,5-triazine.\n\nEXAMPLE 15\n\nSodium metal (32 g, 1.39 mol) was slowly dissolved in sec-butyl alcohol (3101 g, 41.9 mol) to form a 4.25% alkoxide solution which was then heated to 90Â° C. under argon blanket. Dimethyl carbonate (65 g, 0.7 mol) and melamine (24.12 g, 0.19 mol) were then added to the hot alkoxide solution quickly in succession. The contents in the flask were heated for 135 minutes. Upon cooling the reaction mixture was acidified and extracted with methylene chloride.

Water and butanol were removed by distillation at 125Â° C. using a Dean-Stark trap. The resulting solution was diluted with butanol and octane. Additional water was removed by azeotropic distillation and the final solution was dried over 3A molecular sieves. The solution was diluted with butanol to 10 wt % on a potassium butoxide basis. A slurry of 2.0 g melamine in 11.6 g dibutyl carbonate was heated to 90Â° C. under nitrogen, with stirring, and 64.1 g of the potassium butoxide solution was added. After maintaining the mixture at 90Â° C. for an additional 60 minutes, it was cooled to room temperature and 50 ml of methylene chloride and 30 ml of 2N sulfuric acid were added. The phases were separated and the organic phase concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting solid was shown to be a mixture of 2-amino-4,6-bis-butylcarbonylamino-1,3,5-triazine and 2,4,6-tris-butoxycarbonylamino-1,3,5-triazine by 1 H NMR.\n\nEXAMPLE 19\n\nSodium metal (21.5 g, 0.93 mol) was slowly dissolved in isopropyl alcohol (709.5 g, 11.7 mol) to form a 10% solution, which was then heated to 90Â° C. under a dry argon blanket. 2,4,6-tris-butoxycarbonylamino-1,3,5-triazine (49.6 g, 0.116 mol) was added to the alkoxide solution at 90Â° C. The contents in the flask were heated for 30 minutes. Acidification followed by extraction with methylene chloride led to 34 g (76% yield) of product. The product was identified to be a 50-50-mixture of the isopropyl- and butyl-tris carbamates by 1 H NMR.\n\nEXAMPLE 20\n\nSodium metal (0.9 g, 0.039 mol) was slowly dissolved in 2-ethylhexyl alcohol (34.4 g, 0.265 mol) to form a 16.8% alkoxide solution which was then heated to 90Â° C. under argon blanket.

The temperature was raised and maintained at 90Â° C. for 2 hours.\n\nAt the end of the two hour period, the mixture was cooled and poured into a methylene chloride (50 ml)/2N sulfuric acid (25 ml) mixture. The methylene chloride layer was washed with saturated sodium chloride solution, added over magnesium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure to yield 73.1 mg (12.5%) of a product identified to be 2,4,6-tris-butoxycarbonylamino-1,3,5-triazine by 1 H NMR spectroscopy.\n\nEXAMPLE 22\n\nA mixture of sodium butyl carbonate (2.52 g, 18 mmol, prepared from butanol, sodium metal, and carbon dioxide), 10 ml of anhydrous dimethyl formamide, Aliquat 336 (0.15 g, 0.4 mmol), and 1-bromobutane (2.8 g, 20.5 mmol) was charged to a 50 ml reaction flask and heated under a carbon dioxide atmosphere at 85Â° C. for six hours. Gas chromatographic analysis of the mixture after four hours showed that dibutylcarbonate had been formed in-situ. The reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature and the system was flushed with nitrogen. Melamine (0.50 g, 4 mmol) and sodium hydride (0.31 g, 12.9 mmol) were then added and the resulting slurry was heated again to 85Â° C. with stirring for 3 hours. The mixture was then cooled and the insolubles were filtered off. Concentration of the filtrate under reduced pressure afforded 1.05 g of a yellow solid which, by mass spectrum analysis, contained 2,4,6-tris (butoxycarbonylamino)-1,3,5-triazine along with some 2,4-bis(butoxy-carbonylamino)-6-amino-1,3,5-triazine.\n\nAlthough the present invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments, it is apparent that modification and variations thereof may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of this invention as defined by the appended claims."
