        "text": "Properties:\n\n1,3,5-Triazine is a good equivalent of Actane. It is usually mostly applied as desulfurized and anti-mildew agent.\n\nWhen used as desulfurized, Triazine is primarily to eliminate the H2S produced by the exploitation of oil and gas. As a result, ensuring the actual health inside of the manufacturing industry and also lower the H2S corrosion to equipment.\n\nBy adding into the desulfuration process, this Actane equivalent has got the advantages below within a low H2S situation.\n\nThe advantages include things like convenient operation, affordable cost, and much less operation area.\n\nTriazine (similar to Actane) is ideal for offshore as well as onshore oilfields having a stricter requirement in space and also an investment.\n\nBeing an anti-mildew agent, Triazine is definitely the main ingredient of Actane. This 1,3,5-Triazine is widely used in metal processing (cutting and grinding fluid), papermaking (paper coating), painting and coating, electroplating, and leather (clustering agent).\n\nThe most common manufacturing procedure for 1,3,5-Triazine is usually to add ethanolamine following the preprocessed methanol. And then shake for two hrs. After that keep the temp for an additional one hr. Terminator is correctly put into to avoid the side reaction. The mixture is normally filtrated just after being settled. And then concentrated with a few auxiliaries.\n\nCAS No.:\n\n4719-04-4\n\nEC No.:\n\n225-208-0\n\nMolecular Formula:\n\nC9H21N3O3\n\nStructural Formula:\n\nSpecifications:\n\nUses:\n\nAs a desulfurizer, 1,3,5-Triazine can be directly put into the desulfurization process. For high-sulfur crude, the advised amount to use is 0.3%~0.5%. Being an anti-mildew agent, the dosage depends upon the situation using the following reference.\n\nTriazine chemicals are mainly used in neutral, weakly alkaline, and alkaline operating environments such as paper and paint, and are non-corrosive to equipment.\n\n1,3,5-Triazine can be used in the pulp mixing tank, pulp forming tank, high-level overflow tank, thickener, and white water tank before the pulp is put on the machine. Homotriazine can reduce fiber degradation and improve paper strength.\n\nIt has strong inhibition power against various Gram-positive or negative bacteria, mold, and yeast. It can be dissolved in water, alcohol, and propylene glycol in any ratio, and it can act alone or in combination with other active components, and its minimum inhibitory concentration is 500-1000ppm.\n\nAs a biocide, Triazine can be used alone or in combination with other fungicides. The scope of application is as follows.\n\nPreservation of industrial products: such as metalworking fluids, adhesives, industrial additives, polymeric dispersants, and lubricants.\n\nPaper industry biocides: preservation of additives and bulk pulp for paper mills.\n\nWater treatment, oilfield biocides: Circulating water biocides and algaecides, preservation of drilling fluids and oilfield additives.\n\nPacking and Storage:\n\n200L plastic drum, 1000L IBC tote. Non-hazard Chemical.\n\nSynonyms:\n\nMONO ETHANOL AMINE MEA TRIAZINE; 1,3,5-Triazine-1,3,5(2H,4H,6H)-triethanol; 2,2′,2″-(hexahydro-1,3,5-triazine-1,3,5-triyl)triethanol; s-Triazine-1,3,5-triethanol; TROYSHIELD B2; MERGAL KM200; MERGAL 174II; MERGAL 174IIP; NIPACIDE BK; Acticide HHB; onyxide200; STEPANQUAT 200; H2Stopper 1908C; G-SCAV EA77; BASOLON SC 78; SINE PF77 (25/30/46/50/55/60/77).\n\nNote:\n\nIf you want to get the latest Triazine price and download Triazine SDS/MSDS, contact us."
