        "text": "overview cyanuric chloride, also known as cyanuric chloride, is a white crystal with a strong irritating chlorine smell, corrosive to skin, irritating to eyes and tear gas. Melting point 145 â, boiling point 190 â,UVÎ»max241nm (ethanol). Soluble in anhydrous ethanol, ether, chloroform, acetic acid and acrylonitrile, hardly soluble in cold water. Cyanuric chloride cools slowly with water, and hydrolyzes to cyanuric acid (C3H3O3N3) and hydrochloric acid quickly when heated. The products are relatively soluble in water, so they can be separated by extraction. Part of the reaction with concentrated nitric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid at room temperature is converted into cyanuric acid, and the triester of n-cyanuric acid is obtained by the reaction with sodium alcohol, and it can also work with ammonia, amines, phenols, etc.\n\nPreparation method: It is obtained by the reaction of anhydrous hydrocyanic acid and dry chlorine in sunlight (or in anhydrous ether), or by heating cyanuric acid and excess phosphorus pentachloride.\n\nUses: Cyanuric chloride is an important intermediate for the production of high-efficiency and low-toxicity triazobenzene herbicides and insecticides. It is also an intermediate for the production of reactive dyes. It can be used as synthetic resins, rubber, polymer anti-aging agents, Cyanaldehyde resin, photographic sensitizers, fluorescent brighteners, adhesives, and raw materials for various medicinal drugs.\n\nin recent years, the consumption of cyanuric chloride in China has increased rapidly. the average annual growth rate of apparent consumption from 1998 to 2004 is about 32.2%, and the demand for cyanuric chloride will reach 50,000 tons in 2005. it is predicted that cyanuric chloride will maintain rapid growth at an average annual growth rate of 6.0% from 2007 to 2012, and the market prospect is very promising. Due to the large number of follow-up products of cyanuric chloride and the large market demand, relevant enterprises and research institutions in various countries have been continuously developing their downstream products and developing the application field of cyanuric chloride. Therefore, new products derived from cyanuric chloride continue to emerge, and their market demand will further expand.\n\nRelated chemical reactions involving cyanuric chloride:\n\nIt is diazotized by 2-amino-4-nitrophenol, coupled with H acid, and after chromium and cobalt complexation treatment, it is first condensed with cyanuric chloride, and then condensed with ammonia to obtain active black K-BR. Mainly used for printing cotton cloth, polyester/cotton cloth.\n\nUsing cyanuric chloride as raw material, in trichloroethylene solution, at 20~30 â, it reacts with ethylamine to generate 2, 4-dichloro-6-ethylamino-1, 3, 5-triazine, then reacts with ammonia to generate 2-amino-4-chloro-6-ethylaminotriazine, and then reacts with 2-chloro-2-methylpropiononitrile, it can generate selective herbicide grass net, which is used to control annual or perennial narrow-leaf or broad-leaf weeds in corn fields. use used to synthesize fluorescent whitening agents, reactive dyes, medicines, pesticides, etc.\n\ncyanuric chloride is an important intermediate for the production of high-efficiency and low-toxicity homotriazobenzene herbicides and pesticides, and is also an intermediate for the production of reactive dyes for dyeing various synthetic fibers such as fluorescent whitening agents and polyester. It is also used in the production of synthetic resins, rubber, polymer anti-aging agents, explosives, fabric anti-shrinkage agents, surfactants, etc.\n\nCyanuric chloride is an important fine chemical product with a wide range of uses. It is an intermediate in the pesticide industry and a raw material for the manufacture of reactive dyes. It can be used as various additives for organic industrial production, such as fluorescent whitening Agents, textile anti-condensation agents, surfactants, etc., are one of the raw materials used in the manufacture of explosives for rubber accelerators and national defense, and are also the raw materials used in the pharmaceutical and pesticide industry for synthetic drugs."
