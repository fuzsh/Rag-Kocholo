I pulled them off but now I'm concerned if the other fish have them.   \nNow for questions........... \n \nIf one fish has them, do the majority normally have them? \n \nI thought my water quality was decent, is it bad water quality that brought these on?  Where do they come from? \n \nI pulled them off with my fingernail, should I have applied Iodine afterwards? \n \nNow do I need to net each individual fish and treat or treat the whole pond(s)?",
