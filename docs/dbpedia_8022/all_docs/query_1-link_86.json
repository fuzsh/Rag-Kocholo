        "text": "Coordination polymers formed between Cd(NO3)2 or Zn(NO3)2 and 2,4-bis(4-pyridyl)-1,3,5-triazine (dpt) have been synthesized and their single crystal structures determined. Reaction of a 1:1 ratio of Cd(NO3)2 with dpt in MeCN-CH 2Cl2 affords the complex [Cd2(NO 3)4(dpt)2(MeCN)]∞ 1 which exists as a doubly interpenetrated 4.82∞ two-dimensional sheet in the solid state. Each sheet is constructed from nitrate-bridged [Cd(dpt)]4 metallacycles. In sharp contrast the analogous reaction performed using a 2:1 L:M ratio affords the discrete molecular complex [Cd(NO3)2(dpt) 2(MeCN)]2 in which both dpt ligands act as terminal donors rather than bridging metal centres. Reaction of Cd(NO3)2 with dpt in EtOH-CH2Cl2 affords a one-dimensional coordination polymer [Cd(NO3)2(dpt)-(EtOH)]∞ 3. Zn(NO3) 2 reacts with dpt in either a 1:1 or 2:1 L:M ratio to afford the one-dimensional polymer [Zn(NO3)2(dpt)∞ 4 which can be isolated as two polymorphs 4a and 4b which differ in their nitrate binding modes. The product formed is independent of the L:M ratio used in the reaction. Only 4a is formed when MeCN-CH2Cl2is used as reaction solvent whereas both 4a and 4b are formed from either EtOH.CH2Cl2 or 1PrOH.CH2Cl2.\n\nTY - JOUR\n\nT1 - Synthesis and structural characterisation of cadmium(II) and zinc(II) coordination polymers with an angular dipyridyl bridging ligand\n\nT2 - Parallel interpenetration of two-dimensional sheets with 4.82 topology\n\nAU - Barnett, Sarah A.\n\nAU - Blake, Alexander J.\n\nAU - Champness, Neil R.\n\nAU - Nicolson, James E.B.\n\nAU - Wilson, Claire\n\nPY - 2001\n\nY1 - 2001\n\nN2 - Coordination polymers formed between Cd(NO3)2 or Zn(NO3)2 and 2,4-bis(4-pyridyl)-1,3,5-triazine (dpt) have been synthesized and their single crystal structures determined.
