        "text": "Hi Larry-\n\nIn the archives are many threads about how to choose a matboard.\n\nI believe what you really are asking is whether BD mats meet the same criteria thaty Crescent Select do to be considered a conservation quality mat.\n\nTo judge a mat one needs to get away from dangerous buzz words and marketing hype- just because a mat has a \"white core\" and they say it is an alpha cellulose board - one needs to be careful with what your intent is. There are excellent boards made with recycled alpha cellulose that are perfectly fine for decorative framing but inappropriate for the ultimate conservation framing of items that you want to protect.\n\nAre your photographs decorative or for long term display/collections?\n\nA conservation grade mat needs to meet these criteria:\n\n100% virgin alpha cellulose or cotton rag - no recycled materials\n\nlignin, rosin and alum free\n\nneutral pH (for non buffered boards) or\n\nmaintaining an alkaline reserve with a buffering agent (CACO3 - calcium carbonate)\n\nfade and bleed resistant\n\none also needs to know that the surface and backing papers also meet these criteria.\n\nOne manufacturer, (Bainbridge) holds the license on Zeolyte technology and has added molecular traps to their boards. Some feel that this addition makes their boards superior when it comes to conservation quality.\n\nIn addition, the quality of these materials needs to be considered as to the \"workability\" of the product. Crescent Select has specific properites that you may like that other boards may not (and vice versa).\n\nSome reference numbers of Crescent Rag have had problems with the core shredding when cut - and although the boards meet all of the criteria - they were difficult to work with.\n\nAnother thing to consider is how do you get the boards to you and not if but when you get a flawed sheet, who will make it right?\n\nIf cost is an issue - have you looked at Peterboro? They have two lines, a white core line intended for decorative framing and a conservation line that meets all of the criteria I described and it includes both alpha and rag. All of their mats are very well priced. CMI is a national distributor.\n\nI didn't write the criteria- but I would think it has to do with the processing involved in the recycled materials.\n\nIn order to make recycled alpha cellulose \"white\", optical brighteners are used and those compounds are not considered as appropriate for fine art.\n\nOptical brighteners, optical brightening agents (OBAs), fluorescent brightening agents (FBAs) or fluorescent whitening agents (FWAs) are dyes that absorb light in the ultraviolet and violet region (usually 340-370 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum, and re-emit light in the blue region (typically 420-470 nm). Fluorescent activity is a short term or rapid emission response, unlike phosphorescence, which is a delayed emission. These additives are often used to enhance the appearance of color of fabric and paper, causing a \"whitening\" effect, making materials look less yellow by increasing the overall amount of blue light reflected.\n\nThe most common classes of chemicals with this property are the stilbenes and older, non-commercial fluorescent chemical such as umbelliferone, which absorb energy in the UV portion of the spectrum and re-emit it in the blue portion of the visible spectrum. A white surface treated with an optical brightener can emit more visible light than that which shines on it, making it appear brighter. The blue light emitted by the brightener compensates for the diminishing blue of the treated material and changes the hue away from yellow or brown and toward white.\n\nThere are approximately 400 brightener types listed in the Color Index, but less than 90 are actually produced commercially and only a handful are commercially important. Generically, the C.I. FBA number can be assigned to a specific molecule, however, some are duplicated, since manufacturers apply for the index number when they produce it. The global OBA production for paper, textiles and detergents is dominated by just a few di- and tetra-sulfonated triazole-stilbenes and a di-sulfonated stilbene-biphenyl. These are subject to fading when exposed long term to UV, due to the formation of optically inactive stilbene cis-isomers found at the center of the molecule. All brighteners have extended conjungation and/or aromaticity, allowing for electron movement. Some non-stilbene brighteners are used in more permanent applications such as whitening synthetic fiber.\n\nBasic class types of brighteners include:\n\n1. Triazine-stilbenes (di-, tetra- or hexa-sulfonated)\n\n2. Coumarins\n\n3. Imidazolines\n\n4. Diazoles\n\n5. Triazoles\n\n6. Benzoxazolines\n\n7. Biphenyl-stilbenes\n\nBrighteners can be \"boosted\" by the addition of certain polyols like high molecular weight polyethylene glycol or polyvinyl alcohol. These additives increase the visible blue light emissions significantly. Brighteners can also be \"quenched\". Too much use of brightener will often cause a greening effect as emissions start to show above the blue region in the visible spectrum. Besides the formation of cis isomer in stilbene-containing brighteners (only the trans isomer is optically active), continued exposure to UV-containing light will actually cleave the molecule and start the process of degradation."
