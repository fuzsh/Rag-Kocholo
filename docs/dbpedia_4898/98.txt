In an interview with Closer Weekly, the star explained how she moved from NYC to Los Angeles based on the advice from her friend. Her and her husband fell in love with the first home they saw in Brentwood. It was a cottage that contained four bedrooms, four bathrooms, and a pool, where she still lives to this day.

However, the "Friends" alum's marriage didn't last the home renovations. "It was only four tiny rooms, so we opened them up, raised the ceiling, changed the floors...and it's true, that ruined my marriage!" She laughed. "But that's all right. I think doing a house tells you who you are." No matter, because she's been in a beautiful romance with Australian reporter Ian Masters, (via Closer Weekly).
