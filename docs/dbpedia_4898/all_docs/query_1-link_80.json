        "text": "1998\n\nCity Locations\n\nLos Angeles, CA (USA)\n\nLocation Types\n\nHouse, Clubs/Bars\n\nLocation Styles\n\nModern Building, Georgian/Southern, Building Dated/Retro, Colonial\n\nAbout The Wedding Singer\n\nThose who still have a soft spot for the '80s will adore The Wedding Singer (1998), an enchanting romantic comedy that will transport them back to a time of love and fun. Adam Sandler, Drew Barrymore, Christina Pickles, and Christine Taylor feature in this Frank Coraciâdirected masterpiece, which was produced by Robert Simonds and Jack Giarraputo.\n\nIn The Wedding Singer, you'll be whisked away to 1985 in Ridgefield, New Jersey. The plot revolves around the charismatic wedding vocalist Robbie Hart (Adam Sandler). After Robbie's wedding is called off, his life takes a dramatic turn when he falls for Julia Sullivan (Drew Barrymore), a lovely waitress engaged to a cunning businessman. Despite all the obstacles, Robbie finds love, companionship, and resilience as he works through his emotions and battles depression.\n\nThe picture made an incredible $123 million worldwide, essentially due to the warm reception it received from viewers. In 2006, the film was transformed into a stage musical and premiered on Broadway, taking its appeal beyond the realm of cinema.\n\nThe film garnered a blend of opinions, enjoying positive feedback from audiences. It has a 72% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, derived from 67 reviews and an average score of 6.3/10. Metacritic presents it with a weighted average of 59 out of 100, based on the assessments of 21 critics, suggesting \"mixed or average reviews.\"\n\nThe Wedding Singer Locations\n\nThe Wedding Singer takes place in the prototypical American movie town of Ridgefield. The film's development was centered around locales rich in cinematic history and architectural attractiveness, which might make the voyage intriguing for viewers.\n\nLocated at 3400 Wilshire Boulevard in midtown Los Angeles, the historic Ambassador Hotel's ballroom served as the setting for Robbie's serenades. The Graduate, Se7en, and Rocky were just a few of the many films shot within its walls, even if the hotel is no longer standing. It was the end of an era when, in 2006, this landmark structure was demolished despite protests.\n\nIn North Pasadena, near Altadena, Robbie lives in his sister's basement at 1075 East Topeka Street, and Julia lives in the Tucker House in Sierra Madre. Near the world-famous Halloween houses sits the lovely Rosie's house, where Robbie trades singing lessons for meatballs. It's right in the middle of West Hollywood. The magnificent Huntington Library & Gardens in San Marino, Avignon's pub in Montrose, and the old Bank of America skyscraper in downtown Los Angeles are just a few of the other numerous locations that play an essential role in the film.\n\nThese locations serve as the setting for this delightful story and offer a glimpse into LA's diverse architectural landscape. A visit to these sites would not only satisfy the curiosity of film enthusiasts but also provide a deeper appreciation for the city's historical and cultural tapestry, making it a worthwhile adventure for fans of The Wedding Singer and cinema alike.\n\nIn the opening scene, viewers are immediately drawn into the vibrant and nostalgic world of the 1980s as Robbie captivates the wedding guests with his energetic rendition of \"You Spin Me Round (Like a Record).\"\n\nAmidst the festivities, a comedic yet touching moment unfolds when Robbie steps in to save the wedding toast, which is on the verge of disaster due to the groom's alcoholic brother (Steve Buscemi). During these early moments at the wedding, Robbie catches the eye of Julia, a sweet and endearing waitress, sparking the beginning of their heartwarming journey.\n\nThe setting for this memorable scene, the Ridgefield Banquet Hall, is none other than the ballroom of the historic Ambassador Hotel, which was located at 3400 Wilshire Boulevard in LA. The Ambassador Hotel, designed by the renowned architect Myron Hunt, officially opened its doors in 1921.\n\nRenovated by architect Paul Williams in the late 1940s, the hotel transformed into a Los Angeles icon, housing the famous Cocoanut Grove nightclub, hosting six Oscars ceremonies, and receiving every U.S. President from Herbert Hoover to Richard Nixon. Despite its significant history and preservation efforts, the hotel was demolished in 2005 after legal disputes, with demolition concluding in 2006.\n\nToday, visiting the exact location where these scenes were filmed requires a bit of imagination. However, the site is now part of the Robert F. Kennedy Community Schools complex, which pays homage to the historical significance of the Ambassador Hotel.\n\nFor those interested in exploring this cinematic history, this location is found in the Wilshire Center area of Los Angeles. Visitors can reach this location via public transportation by taking the Metro Purple Line to the Wilshire/Vermont station, just a 15-minute walk from the former hotel site.\n\nRobbie faces a heart-wrenching moment early in the film. The scene is set on what is supposed to be one of the happiest days of Robbie's life, his wedding to Linda (Angela Featherstone). However, the joyous occasion takes a devastating turn when it becomes evident that Linda has chosen not to proceed with the marriage.\n\nThis emotionally charged scene unfolds at the stunning Huntington Library & Gardens, 1151 Oxford Road in San Marino. The venue, known for its breathtaking beauty, has been a favored location for various films, including American Wedding, Memoirs of a Geisha, Indecent Proposal, The Nutty Professor, and Serenity. As the story progresses, it's revealed that the film will significantly return to Huntington, further solidifying its importance within the narrative.\n\nFor fans wishing to explore the location where this memorable scene was filmed, The Huntington Library & Gardens remains an accessible and enriching destination. Still fully operational, The Huntington offers a vast library and houses an impressive collection of art, focusing on 18th and 19th-century European art and 17th to mid-20th-century American art.\n\nTo reach The Huntington Library & Gardens in San Marino, visitors can easily travel by car or public transportation from Los Angeles, taking the CA-110 N/Arroyo Seco Parkway.\n\nIn a pivotal moment, the audience finds Robbie grappling with the aftermath of his wedding that never was. Following the heartbreak of being left at the altar by Linda, Robbie retreats to the modest comfort of his living situationâliving in the basement of his sister's house.\n\nOn the staircase in front of the house, Robbie confronts the physical embodiment of his dashed hopes and dreams when Linda shows up, confessing her inability to go through with their marriage.\n\nThe exterior of Robbie's sister's house is located at 1075 East Topeka Street in North Pasadena, edging toward Altadena. The address used in the film, 1075 1/2, points to Robbie's humble abode in the basement. Situated on the north side of the street, this area of Pasadena, provides a picturesque and quintessentially suburban backdrop that complements the film's setting.\n\nFor fans eager to catch a glimpse of this iconic location, it's important to remember that the house is privately owned. While the exteriors remain unchanged from the movie, allowing for a nostalgic visual experience, visitors should ensure they respect the privacy and property of the residents.\n\nReaching 1075 East Topeka Street is straightforward for those traveling within the Los Angeles area. By car, navigate towards North Pasadena via CA-110 N. Public transportation options are also available for those looking to make their way from different parts of the city, with bus routes and metro lines serving the Pasadena area.\n\nAmidst his quest to win over his fiancÃ©e with financial stability, Robbie goes to an amusing job interview at a bank. With his characteristic blend of earnestness and humor, Robbie declares his admiration for money as the primary reason he should be working there.\n\nThe setting for this memorable job interview is none other than the historic building at 650 South Spring Street in downtown Los Angeles. Initially serving as a Bank of America branch, this architectural gem has been a popular location for filmmakers, featuring in a variety of movies such as Ghost, The Mask, Marathon Man, Spider-Man 2, The Prestige, Prizziâs Honor, and St Elmoâs Fire. Its versatility as a filming location extends to more recent productions, where it was used as the exterior for the upscale bridal store Belle en Blanc in Bridesmaids and as an archive in Star Trek Into Darkness.\n\nConstructed in 1911, it proudly stood as the tallest building in Los Angeles for five years. In 2002, the building transformed into 130 residential loft condominium units, with retail spaces occupying the ground floor. It's important to note that direct public access may be limited because it houses residential units. Prospective visitors should contact the building's administration for information on visiting hours or any potential guidelines.\n\nLocated in downtown Los Angeles, the building is conveniently accessible by car or public transit, including the LA Metro. It's just a 20-minute walk from the city center along N Spring St. Public transit routes from the LA city center are also available\n\nRobbie is ready to confess his feelings to Julia. He approaches Julia's residence, only to see her through a window, dressed in a wedding gown and seemingly practicing her vows. Unbeknownst to Robbie, Julia is imagining herself as Mrs. Robbie Hart, highlighting the depth of her feelings for him.\n\nJulia's quaint and charming home is the Tucker House, a historic building that once served as a schoolhouse at 43 Sierra Place in Sierra Madre. Nestled just south of Sierra Madre Boulevard, on the west side of the street, this location provides a picturesque backdrop for the unfolding drama. Sierra Madre, a serene town northeast of Pasadena and close to landmarks like the Santa Anita race track and the L.A. Arboretum, offers a glimpse into a quieter, more idyllic lifestyle within the bustling Greater Los Angeles area.\n\nThe town is easily accessible from Pasadena and the surrounding Los Angeles area, with options for travel by car or public transportation. If youâre driving, you can take the I-210 freeway."
