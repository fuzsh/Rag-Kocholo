        "text": "Bananas are native to Southeast Asia but now grow in many warm climates around the world.\n\nThey’re an excellent choice if you’re interested in adding more healthy fruits to your diet.\n\nBananas contain fiber and many beneficial nutrients, including:\n\npotassium\n\nvitamin B6\n\nvitamin C\n\nvarious antioxidants and phytonutrients\n\nHere are 11 science-based health benefits of bananas.\n\nBananas contain a fair amount of carbs, water, fiber, and antioxidants but little protein and no fat.\n\nOne medium banana contains:\n\nCalories: 112\n\nFat: 0 grams (g)\n\nProtein: 1 g\n\nCarbs: 29 g\n\nFiber: 3 g\n\nVitamin C: 12% of the Daily Value (DV)\n\nRiboflavin: 7% of the DV\n\nFolate: 6% of the DV\n\nNiacin: 5% of the DV\n\nCopper: 11% of the DV\n\nPotassium: 10% of the DV\n\nMagnesium: 8% of the DV\n\nBananas are rich in soluble fiber. During digestion, soluble fiber dissolves in liquid to form a gel. This may also contribute to a banana’s sponge-like texture.\n\nUnripe (green) bananas also contain resistant starch, a type of fiber that your body does not digest.\n\nTogether, these two types of fiber may help moderate your blood sugar levels after meals and regulate your appetite by slowing the emptying of your stomach.\n\nThis means that despite their higher carb content, bananas may not cause major spikes in blood sugar levels in people who don’t have diabetes.\n\nHowever, for those who have diabetes, eating a large portion in one sitting may cause blood sugar levels to rise too high, so it’s best to stick to one banana at a time.\n\nDietary fiber has been linked to many health benefits, including improved digestion.\n\nResistant starch, the type of fiber found in unripe bananas, is a prebiotic. Prebiotics escape digestion and end up in your large intestine, where they become food for the beneficial bacteria in your gut (probiotics).\n\nWhat’s more, pectin — a fiber found in both ripe and unripe bananas — may help prevent constipation and soften stools.\n\nSome test-tube studies even suggest that pectin may help protect against colon cancer, although further research in humans is needed to learn more about this possible benefit.\n\nNo study has directly investigated the effects of bananas on weight loss. However, bananas have several attributes that could make them a weight-loss-friendly food.\n\nBananas have relatively few calories — just over 100 calories in an average banana — but are nutritious and filling.\n\nThey’re also packed with dietary fiber and resistant starch, which may help you feel full longer and therefore reduce the frequency and size of your meals.\n\nIf you’d like to include unripe bananas in your diet, try using them as you’d use plantains.\n\nPotassium is a mineral that’s vital for heart health and especially for blood pressure management. However, few people get enough potassium in their diet.\n\nBananas are a great source of potassium, with a medium banana providing 10% of the DV.\n\nA potassium-rich diet could help lower your blood pressure, reducing your risk of hypertension. A 2017 study in mice also suggests that potassium may lower the risk of heart disease by 27%.\n\nAdditionally, bananas contain 8% of the DV for magnesium, another important mineral for heart health.\n\nMagnesium deficiency (hypomagnesemia) may be linked to an increased risk of heart disease, elevated blood pressure, and high levels of fats in the blood. Therefore, it’s essential to get enough of this mineral from either your diet or supplements.\n\nFruits and vegetables are excellent sources of dietary antioxidants, and bananas are no exception.\n\nThey contain several types of potent antioxidants, including flavonoids and amines. These antioxidants are linked to many health benefits, such as a reduced risk of heart disease and macular degeneration.\n\nAntioxidants help prevent oxidative damage to your cells caused by free radicals. If you do not consume enough antioxidants, free radicals can build up over time and cause harm if their levels become high enough in your body.\n\nThe soluble fiber in bananas may help keep you full by adding bulk to your digestive system and slowing digestion.\n\nAdditionally, bananas are relatively low in calories for their size.\n\nCombined, the low calorie and high fiber content of bananas make them a more filling snack than some other options, such as processed or sugary boxed snacks.\n\nProtein is filling, but bananas are low in this macronutrient. For a hunger-reducing snack, you can try eating a sliced banana with a protein-rich food such as Greek yogurt or blending a banana into a protein shake.\n\nInsulin resistance is a significant risk factor in several chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes.\n\nStudies suggest that regularly eating resistant starch may improve insulin sensitivity, making your body more responsive to the blood sugar-regulating hormone insulin.\n\nBut more research is needed to investigate how the resistant starch in bananas might affect insulin sensitivity.\n\nPotassium is vital for healthy kidney function and blood pressure regulation.\n\nAs a great dietary source of potassium, bananas could be especially beneficial for keeping your kidneys healthy.\n\nA 2019 study that included more than 5,000 people with early stage chronic kidney disease linked potassium with lower blood pressure and a slower progression of kidney disease.\n\nHowever, some people who have late stage kidney disease or are undergoing dialysis need to restrict their potassium intake. If you fall into one of these categories, speak with a healthcare professional before increasing your potassium intake.\n\nBananas are sometimes referred to as the perfect food for athletes. This is largely due to their content of easily digested carbs along with potassium and magnesium, which act as electrolytes.\n\nYou lose electrolytes through your sweat during vigorous exercise. Resupplying your body with potassium and magnesium after sweating may reduce exercise-related muscle cramps and soreness.\n\nSpecific research on the effects of bananas on exercise performance, cramping, and exercise recovery is lacking. But bananas can provide excellent nutrition before, during, and after exercise.\n\nBananas are not only healthy and tasty but also convenient.\n\nThey make a great addition to yogurt, cereal, or smoothies, and they work well as a topping for whole grain toast with peanut butter. You can even use them in place of sugar in your baking and cooking.\n\nBananas are also easy to transport and are usually well tolerated and easily digested. All you need to do is peel them and you’re good to go.\n\nQuick banana recipes\n\nYou can make easy, delicious pancakes by making a banana batter. Combine one mashed banana with two beaten eggs, and then cook the mixture as you would any other pancake batter. Add some quick oats to the batter for extra fiber and bulk.\n\nIf you freeze banana slices, you can use a high powered blender to blend them with cocoa powder to make chocolate “nice cream.”\n\nFor baked oatmeal muffins, combine overripe bananas with:\n\nunsweetened applesauce\n\noats\n\nmilk\n\nbaking powder\n\na sweetener such as agave nectar or maple syrup\n\nOnce the ingredients are mixed, pour the batter into a muffin tin and pop it into the oven.\n\nIs it good to eat a banana every day?\n\nBananas are healthy, delicious, and versatile fruits. They’re full of nutrients that could help prevent constipation, improve digestive and gut health, and promote recovery from intense activity.\n\nEating one banana per day will provide:\n\n12% of the DV for vitamin C\n\n10% of the DV for potassium\n\n8% of the DV for magnesium\n\nEating one banana per day is a healthy option. But since most of the calories in bananas come from carbs, eating too many bananas may result in high sugar intake, which could lead to high blood pressure.\n\nWhat are the benefits of eating a banana?\n\nBananas are a nutritious, low calorie fruit that may help:\n\nimprove blood sugar levels\n\nprevent constipation\n\nimprove gut, kidney, and heart health\n\naid in weight loss\n\nkeep you feeling full\n\nsupport post-exercise recovery\n\nWhat is the best time to eat bananas?\n\nBananas are a common breakfast food because they are nutritious, filling, and easy to eat.\n\nHowever, since bananas are high in carbs, they may increase blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes. Pairing a banana with a food that’s high in protein and fat, such as Greek yogurt, may be more beneficial.\n\nBananas are a popular fruit with many potential health benefits.\n\nThey may improve your digestion and heart health, thanks to their fiber and antioxidant content. Plus, they may support weight loss because they’re relatively low in calories, nutrient-dense, and filling.\n\nBoth ripe (yellow) bananas and unripe (green) bananas can satisfy your sweet tooth and help keep you healthy."
