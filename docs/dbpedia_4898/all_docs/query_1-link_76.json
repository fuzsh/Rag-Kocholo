        "text": "If you grew up on your Mom's Sloppy Joe Sandwiches, prepare to take that sandwich to the next level!\n\nAccording to Dictionary.com, a Sloppy Joe is \"a sandwich of ground beef cooked in a spicy tomato or barbecue sauce and usually served on a bun.\"\n\nSloppy Joe is also the name of a woman's big and baggy sweater from the 1940s - which is news to me.\n\nFor our purposes, we're focusing on the sandwich, not the sweater.\n\nOh, another disclaimer. There is another Sloppy Joe Sandwich, mostly popular in Northern New Jersey. It's a deli-meat-type sandwich. This article is not about that sandwich.\n\nSo, if your mom made Sloppy Joes for you, chances are she made them from scratch or used a product like Manwich.\n\nThe best Sloppy Joe in New Jersey is all home-made - or, restaurant made. It's the Sloppy Joe Sandwich from Jester's Dive Bar in Rio Grande, New Jersey.\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with Jester's, you must check it out. It's located in the same building as the old Rio Station. They've changed the place, and the menu is fantastic.\n\nI've had the Sloppy Joe from Jester's it is just fantastic!\n\nReminiscent of Mom's Sloppy Joe - but, a cut above. (Sorry Mom!)\n\nTheir recipe is pretty traditional: ground beef with onions and peppers. It was the homemade tomato sauce that really kicked up the recipe. I couldn't get enough!\n\nAt Jester's Dive Bar, they offer choices for your Sloppy Joe! (Your Mom never did that!)\n\nYou can choose the traditional Sloppy Joe on a brioche bun, or maybe a Sloppy Jose: topped with cheddar cheese, pico de gallo, and chili lime sour cream.\n\nAlso on the menu, is the Southern Sloppy Joe, with cole slaw, pickles, and a touch of BBQ sauce. The Crunch Joe Sandwich features homemade crunchy chips on your sandwich.\n\nJester's also offers a Sloppy Joe Bowl, the meat topped with bacon and cheese, served over tater tots. Let's go!\n\nYou're going to find a great menu at Jester's. Bar/restaurant food you'd expect, but a lot of surprises too! Take advantage of a Seize the Deal offer: Pay $25 and get a $50 gift certificate. The deal can be found here.\n\nWell, now I'm hungry!"
