        "text": "By Lynn Venhaus\n\nWhether you describe her as a grand dame or a beloved veteran, the multi-talented Donna Weinsting is a true all-around champion in local theater who only garners accolades from her peers.\n\nA popular figure on stage, in films and comedy clubs throughout St. Louis for 60 years, she is not resting on her laurels, by any means. She is part of this year’s ninth annual Tennessee Williams Festival St. Louis (Aug. 8-18), as part of the cast of “Life Upon the Wicked Stage.” (And was part of the first, in “The Rooming House Plays” in 2016).\n\n“Life Upon the Wicked Stage” celebrates the Grand Center Theatre District and includes three one-act plays about show business — “In Our Profession,” “The Magic Tower” and “The Fat Man’s Wife.” It will also feature music and is directed by former St. Louisan Brian Hohlfeld. Donna is cast in “The Magic Tower.”\n\nCarrie Houk, the festival’s artistic director, described the piece as a “like a mini-jukebox musical.”\n\n“It features songs from the period to evoke an era of vaudeville and the type of entertainment Tom (Tennessee Williams) would have encountered in his Grand Avenue outings long, long ago,” she said.\n\nEight performances will take place at 1 p.m. and 4 p.m. on Saturday, Aug. 10 and 17 and Sunday, Aug. 11 and 18, at the Curtain Call Lounge, which is next door to the Fox Theatre, 521 N. Grand Boulevard.\n\nDonna is enthusiastic about the show.\n\n“It’s going to be a treat for Tennessee Williams fans. Interspersed between the three one-acts are musical numbers fitting the times accompanied by the marvelous Tom Clear on piano,” she said. “Brian Hohlfeld is a joy to be directed by and the cast of Julie Layton, Gary Wayne Barker, Julia Crump, and Dominic DeCicco is excellent. I’m happy to be in the mix.”\n\nWeinsting has also been announced as part of the St. Louis Actors’ Studio’s 17th season “Something Old, Something New.” She and Whit Reichert will perform in an original play by Carter W. Lewis called “With,” to be directed by Annamaria Pileggi, set for April 4 – 20, 2025.\n\n“The special thing about this project is just about everything. I’ll be working in a two hander with Whit Reichert written by Carter Lewis and directed by Annamaria Pileggi for Actors Studio. Dream team,” she said.\n\nDonna will play Minnie and Whit will be Clifford, and their world will be humorous, but ultimately heartbreaking, as they navigate a blizzard, a dead son, a rat in the kitchen and worse; in order to hold on to a bit of control over their personal end of life decisions.\n\nThe couple enlists their derelict son to obtain Death With Dignity drugs from the state of Oregon, but due to an accident on the highway, the plan goes hysterically and tragically awry. As a result, Minnie and Clifford cling to daily tasks as they slowly get cut off from the world by a blizzard and disconnected utilities. Their enduring love fuels them through an obstacle course of each day’s events.\n\nShe is happy to contribute to the current arts scene.\n\n“I feel invigorated and full of excitement again,” she said.\n\nEarlier this summer, Donna was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award from the non-profit organization Arts For Life. AFL is dedicated to promoting public awareness of local community theatre, encouraging excellence in the arts, and acknowledging the incredible people who are a part of it.\n\n“I am beyond honored to receive this very special recognition, humbled and excited. I feel that this is a gift — to be acknowledged for something I have had a passion for nearly my entire life,” she said.\n\nBorn Donna Collins, she grew up in St. Louis, and while her family moved several times, she landed in Oakville at age 13, and that is where she has lived ever since. She was first in a summer city park production of “Sleeping Beauty,” then a play in junior high.\n\n“The die was cast and a 60-year career in acting and stand-up comedy was launched,” she said.\n\nA graduate of Mehlville High School, she has never shied away from a challenge, playing leads as well as supporting and brief roles. She has performed in one-woman shows, played characters like Mr. Potter in “It’s a Wonderful Life,” Jabba the Hutt in “Star Wars,” and various animals in WiseWrite plays written by 10-year-olds.\n\nBesides STLAS and TWSL, she has been on the stages of regional professional companies The Repertory Theatre of St. Louis, Max and Louie Productions, New Jewish Theatre, Slightly Askew Theatre Ensemble, Stray Dog Theatre, St. Louis Shakespeare, Upstream Theater, West End Players Guild, and the shuttered Orange Girls, Insight Theatre, OnSite, and others.\n\nShe has appeared at the Bluff City Theater in Hannibal, Mo., Ozark Actors’ Theatre in Rolla, Mo., Arrow Rock Lyceum Theatre in Arrow Rock, Mo., Stages Houston and 59E59 Theatre Off-Broadway in New York as part of the LaBute New Theatre Festival.\n\nThe community theater organizations she has worked with include Clayton Community Theatre, Theatre Guild of Webster Groves, and the no longer active Affton Players.\n\nHer honors include a Kevin Kline Award for Lead Actress, as Bessie in “From Door to Door” at New Jewish Theatre, St. Louis Theater Circle Award for Outstanding Actress as Iola in “Salt, Root and Roe” at Upstream Theater, and a St. Louis Theater Circle Award for Comedy Ensemble for “Jacob and Jack” at New Jewish Theatre, where she played both Ester and Hannah.\n\nShe will be shooting a movie in Springfield this fall called “Big Mike’s Cabin,” and has appeared in other locally shot films “Ethan and Edna” and “Doubting Thomas.”\n\n“It is wonderful that we are giving the film industry the incentive to come to Missouri again,” she said..\n\nWhile awards are a cherry on top, Donna said she is most proud of her family — her two children, five grandchildren, eight great-grandchildren and her 63-year marriage to her high school sweetheart, Mike.\n\n“Being with my amazing family is the absolute joy of my life,” she said.\n\nQuestions and Answers with Donna Weinsting\n\n1. Why did you choose your profession/pursue the arts?\n\n“I didn’t choose the arts, they chose me. I don’t ever remember wanting to be anything but an actor.”\n\n2. How would your friends describe you?\n\n“My friends would all say I’m their funny friend. They support me and make me feel special.”\n\n3. How do you like to spend your spare time?\n\n“I used to fill my spare time with tennis and golf. Lots of tennis and golf. COVID took me away from that and I just got less active. Now my spare time is seeing plays and lots of television.”\n\n4. What is your current obsession?\n\n“My current obsession is binging the really great series you can watch in the comfort of your home. Love Ted Lasso, Outlander, Hacks and many others.”\n\n5. What would people be surprised to find out about you?\n\n“People would probably be surprised to know I have a basement full of archery, tennis and golf trophies.”\n\n6. Can you share one of your most defining moments in life?\n\n“One of my most defining moments in life was entering a talent contest on a cruise and doing stand-up for the first time in my life at 48. It was an epiphany to know I could make 2,000 people laugh just being myself. I can’t explain how overwhelming that feeling of euphoria was.”\n\n7. Who do you admire most?\n\n“I admire the most people who can do it all and do it well. People who can write, perform, direct and produce are superstars. People who devote themselves to the betterment of others is inspiring.”\n\n8. What is at the top of your bucket list?\n\n“Top of my bucket list is to be in a television series. Betty White is gone and can never be replaced but there is a definite need for a sassy old woman.”\n\n9. How were you affected by the pandemic years, and anything you would like to share about what got you through and any lesson learned during the isolation periods? Any reflections on how the arts were affected? And what it means to move forward?\n\n“The pandemic sort of ended my acting career for a while. I got older and even though I am not a strong singer, COVID took a great deal out of my voice and now I no longer have confidence in it. I got through the pandemic by watching a lot of television and keeping track of the lives of my family. I learned from the isolation that I don’t have the drive I would like to have. I could have used the down time to learn a new language, play the piano, write a play and clean out my closets, instead I watched television and bitched about not being in a play.\n\n“The pandemic was disastrous for the arts. Many small companies closed and some of the big ones were hit with financial hardships. I am encouraged by the fortitude of those in the arts though. New companies are springing up and the talent here in St. Louis is so rich and full of promise.”\n\n10. What is your favorite thing to do in St. Louis?\n\n“My favorite thing to do is be on the stage, but if I’m not, I love to see good theatre and support and encourage our plethora of talent here. I love a good martini and being with old and dear friends too. I’ve been married to my high school sweetheart for 63 years and have a son and daughter, five grandchildren and eight of the most beautiful, smart and intelligent great grandchildren in the world.\n\n12. What’s next?\n\n“In the fall I have been cast in a film being shot in the Ozarks called “Big Mike’s Cabin.”. Then in April of next year I will be doing the play with Whit Reichert. I feel reinvigorated and full of excitement again.”\n\nMore About Donna Weinsting:\n\nAge: 82\n\nBorn: Arbyrd, Missouri in the bootheel.\n\nCurrently live: Oakville, Missouri\n\nFamily: Husband of 63 years, son, daughter, five grandchildren and eight great grandchildren.\n\nEducation: I have an associate degree from Meramec Community College.\n\nDay job: I have been a Real Estate Salesperson for almost 50 years.\n\nFirst job: My first job was working the lunch counter in a Walgreen’s Drug Store when I was 15.\n\nFirst play: My first play was in Sleeping Beauty in a St. Louis park summer production.

We have continued to pay the full salaries of our full-time, year-round administrative staff, with no furloughs or other lapses in pay. We have moved our administrative and box office teams to work remotely to serve you during this period,” a statement said.\n\nPlay at Home\n\nThe Repertory Theatre of St. Louis has teamed with Baltimore Center Stage, Long Wharf Theatre, The Public Theater and Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company to present Play at Home, a series of micro-commissioned short plays from some of the American theatre’s most exciting and prominent playwrights.\n\nThese new plays – which all run 10 minutes or less – are available for the public to download, read and perform at home for free at playathome.org.\n\nIn the wake of widespread event cancellations following the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19), the participating theatres conceived Play at Home as a way to support artists, connect people to theatre, and to ignite imagination and joy in these uncertain times.\n\nEach organization commissioned multiple playwrights – most of whom had plays canceled due to the coronavirus outbreak – to create new works that were big, joyful and not bound by the constraints of what might be “possible” on a traditional stage.\n\nThe Rep’s commissioned playwrights feature:\n\nRegina Taylor (playwright of The Rep’s 2020-2021 production of Oo-Bla-Dee)\n\nKaren Zacarias (playwright of The Rep’s 2020-2021 production of Native Gardens)\n\nSteph Del Rosso (playwright of The Rep’s 2020-2021 world premiere of The Gradient)\n\nGuadalís Del Carmen (who appeared at The Rep as an actor in 2020’s Mojada: A Medea in Los Angeles)\n\nTre’von Griffith (a St. Louis performer and playwright, co-founder of TLT Productions)\n\nThese plays are meant to be read at home among family and friends, and we highly encourage readers to share photos or videos of their home performances on social media using the hashtag #playathome.\n\nMax and Louie Productions\n\nEstelle Siteman of Max & Louie Productions said they optimistically look forward to bringing the second play of our 2020 season,”Looking for Normal” by Jane Anderson to the Marcelle. “This beautiful ,moving play full of wit and wisdom opens July 16 through the 26.2020,” she said.\n\nMoonstone Theatre Company\n\nSharon Hunter said Moonstone Theatre Company has postponed their July opening of “The House of Blue Leaves” to July of 2021 at the Wool Studio Theatre at the J.

This is the premiere of the full version of “Now Playing Third Base for the St. Louis Cardinals…Bond, James Bond,” which will be at The Chapel, 4238 Alexander Drive, 63105. Performances are Thursdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m., with a matinee on Sunday at 2 p.m.\n\nIt was performed in a shortened version at the 2018 St. Louis Fringe Festival, and audiences responded enthusiastically and critics raved. Snoops Theatre Thoughts said “A delightful show that’s part personal memoir, part history lesson, part nostalgia, and all fascinating. A difficult show to describe but what it is is excellent.” Limelight said “Hanrahan jumps from omniscient narrator to 15-year old movie fanatic to baseball and theatre historian, the audience hanging on every word. The Cardinals are the talk of the town again. This show should be the talk of the town, too!”\n\nHanrahan said, “There’s never been a play we’ve done that’s received such enthusiastic, visceral reaction, due, surely, to the St. Louis history of the show. At the Fringe, productions are limited to one-hour playing time, and this new version will allow us to incorporate new material that should make the show ever more entertaining and informative.”\n\n“Now Playing Third Base for the St. Louis Cardinals…Bond, James Bond,” concerns a teen-age boy in 1964. JFK’s assassination still casts a pall on the nation. The Beatles’ emergence in February of ’64 starts to lighten the mood of the nation. The Cardinals continue the good times in St. Louis with a mad dash toward the pennant. And when a new movie hero hits the screens that summer, a bunch of boys on a baseball field have their first theatre experience when one of their gang offers a 30-minute one-man show of “From Russia with Love.” Throughout, the playwright draws links between what’s happened and happening – from JFK to James Bond, from segregation in St. Louis to segregation in baseball’s Southern Leagues and Florida stadiums where The Beatles were supposed to play, from WWII to British film production crews and JFK hit squads, from the first cave man who stood up by the fire to the theatre musings of Peter Brook…all of it swirling in front of the eyes of a young boy, and the memory of that time.\n\nShane Signorino will direct the show as he did at The Fringe (Shane just received a Theatre Critics Circle nomination as Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy for Midnight’s POPCORN FALLS), Kevin Bowman will serve as Production Designer, Michael B. Perkins will design video support (as he did for Midnight productions of A MODEL FOR MATISSE, JUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG, and LITTLE THING BIG THING), and Elizabeth Henning will be Stage Manager.\n\nThere will also be a concurrent exhibit in The Chapel lobby of memorabilia from 1950’s/60’s baseball and James Bond films, presented by George Venegoni.\n\nNew Line Theatre\n\nNew Line managed to get two weekends of performances of “Head Over Heels” before the local government mandates of crowd size forced it to close early in mid-March.\n\nIts June production of “Urinetown” has been cancelled.\n\nStray Dog Theatre\n\n“Annie,” which was to open April 9, has been postponed, with dates to be announced.\n\n“We will honor all tickets already purchased to any of the new performance dates once they are announced. To purchase tickets to any other future productions, please call our box office directly at (314) 865-1995.\n\n“We are currently planning to hold the remainder of the 2019-2020 season as scheduled.

Bell.\n\n“We would like to thank everyone for the hard work they’ve already put into the production and we would like to thank you for your patience as we work to bring you the quality story telling you, our family, deserve. Annie is that bit of light we all need right now, ‘the sun will come out tomorrow’ and we will overcome anything,” Bell said.\n\n“We know we are not the only organization dealing with these difficult decisions and we stand with them, ready to come back stronger. Your continued support of all arts organizations is always appreciated but never more than in times like these. We look forward to seeing you soon,” he said. “Please stay safe and be kind to one another.”\n\nKenneth Lonergan’s “Lobby Hero” is set to run June 4 – June 20\n\n“However, due to the extreme strain currently being faced by many organizations we have made the decision to halt online sales of upcoming productions. We will resume online sales once matters have settled and the timeline of events moving forward becomes more defined,” Bell said.\n\n“You may continue to purchase tickets for upcoming shows by calling our Box Office at (314) 856-1995 or emailing us at boxoffice@straydogtheatre.org. Thank you for your patience and your continued support as we manage these unfortunate events.”\n\nFor more information, visit www.straydogtheatre.org\n\nSt Louis Actors’ Studio\n\nNeil LaBute’s Ten X Ten Series 2nd Week free Video is now availalbe!

On April 7, Andrew Jorgensen, general director of Opera Theatre, announced the cancellation of the 2020 festival season that was to open May 23 and run through June 28 with this repertory: the world premiere of Tobias Picker and Aryeh Lev Stollman’s Awakenings, Bizet’s gripping opera Carmen, Strauss’ effervescent comedy Die Fledermaus, and the long-awaited company premiere of Carlisle Floyd’s Susannah.\n\nUnfortunately, due to the size of seasonal staff required to produce each opera season, it is not possible for us to assemble the same casts, creative teams, and backstage artisans at any other point in the next several months. Even if we could postpone our season by a month, we simply don’t know when it will be safe for groups to gather again.\n\nAt this time, there is no active plan in place to move any of the 2020 productions into the 2021 Festival Season. However, they are still evaluating various options and scenarios — stay tuned for more!\n\nFor a complete list of all affected programs and public events, including information on whether an event is canceled or postponed, visit the website and scroll down for a complete list:\n\nhttps://www.opera-stl.org/beyond-the-stage/updates-regarding-covid-19\n\nThis page will be updated frequently in the weeks ahead as new information becomes available regarding the status of events, including possible rescheduling or digital streaming.\n\n“As always, our highest priority is the health of the entire OTSL family — patrons, staff, and artists,” the statement reads.\n\nShakespeare Festival St. Louis\n\nThe 2020 Shakespeare in the Park production of “Much Ado About Nothing” has been moved to Aug. 12 – Sept. 6. Producing Artistic Director Tom Ridgely said it was in order to provide the best possible chance of safely gathering artists and audiences for its 20th anniversary season. It is to be directed by Bruce Longworth.\n\n“For the past 20 years in St. Louis, the opening of Shakespeare in the Park has helped to mark the unofficial start of summer,” Ridgely said. “This year it’s clear that the only way to care for our actors, crew, volunteers and community is to give as much time as possible for social distancing measures to take effect and hope to be one of the ways we all bring our summer 2020 to a much happier close.”\n\nThe previously announced creative team of Matt Pace & Brien Seyle (Original Music), Josh Smith (Scenic Design), Dorothy Englis (Costume Design), John Wylie (Lighting Design) and Kathy Ruvuna (Sound Design) remains the same.\n\nIn response to the widespread cancellation of live events, the Festival has already shifted to generating a full schedule of new and original content for the online and social media platforms under the umbrella of “ShakespeareTV.”\n\nThese include the previously aired “watch party” of its canceled regional tour of Cymbeline, a live reading of “Venus and Adonis” (which Shakespeare wrote during a plague-induced theater closure) and a five-night reading of Albert Camus’ postwar masterpiece “The Plague.” Together they’ve already been viewed 10,000 times.\n\nNow through May 29 on ShakespeareTV, which can be accessed on their Facebook page:\n\nTHE ZOOM PLAYS: a weekly series of 20- to 30-minute original plays written especially to be performed live over the videoconferencing app Zoom. Created and performed by local playwrights, directors and actors.\n\nGREEN SHOW MONDAYS: an eclectic variety program featuring music, comedy and performance from Festival favorites.\n\nSHAKESPEARE AND CHILL: a special selection of Shakespeare-inspired movies featuring live commentary from artists and scholars, co-curated by Cinema St. Louis.\n\nOther one-night only events to be announced.\n\nMay 29 – June 21 is SHAKE20\n\nA 20th anniversary reboot of the beloved engagement program SHAKE38 featuring community responses to 20 of Shakespeare’s plays streaming on Facebook and Instagram Tuesdays through Sundays 8 p.m. during the Festival’s originally scheduled run, May 29-June 21.\n\nLike the original, SHAKE20 will be a region-wide collaboration involving artists and organizations including SHAKE38 alumni: Slightly Askew Theater, Prison Performing Arts: The Alumni Group, RS-Theatrics, Poor Monsters and Theater Nuevo. More details about the program and how to apply will be shared soon.\n\n“In the meantime, we hope that you and yours stay well. We have planned an incredible season of free Shakespeare, and we cannot wait to share it with you. It’s an interesting time to be in the business of live theatre and touring productions, but the Festival is committed to paying our artists and staff throughout this crisis,” Ridgely said.\n\nSo, if you have ever considered becoming a member, know that we are always grateful for your support—but especially so at this time,” he said.\n\n“During this crisis, we feel more connected to Shakespeare and his contemporaries than ever before. Biographer Jonathan Bate wrote, ‘The Plague was the single most powerful force shaping [Shakespeare’s] life and those of his contemporaries.’ During times of quarantine, Shakespeare wrote some of his most important sonnets and plays,” Ridgely said.\n\n“We can’t claim to have his genius, but we will take inspiration from his dedication and from artists around the world that are stepping up to create, facilitate, and share stories in new and exciting ways. Stay tuned for updates on new and existing Festival programs,” he said.\n\nFor more information, visit the website sfstl.com and on social media.

It was the final production of the group’s 109th season.\n\n“As our country copes with the growing threat of the Coronavirus, one of the most important steps we must take to protect ourselves and each other is the kind of “social distancing” that is impossible at a theatrical production. Our Board of Directors believes it is highly unlikely that the need for social distancing will be any less in April than it is today, and decided that the best course of action for our company and our patrons was to act now to cancel the show,” a statement reads.\n\nPatrons who have purchased advance tickets through Brown Paper Tickets will be issued automatic refunds.

Rehearsals start\n\nJuly 2.\n\nThen, he’ll play the Captain of the Inquisition in “Man of\n\nLa Mancha” in September, his only musical with Stages St. Louis this summer.\n\n“Man of La Mancha” runs Sept. 6 to Oct. 6 and concludes\n\nStages’ 33rd season, its final one before they move into a new\n\nPerforming Arts Center in Kirkwood.\n\nFlack has been working with Stages since 1990, when he\n\nplayed the title role in “Snoopy!”\n\nEver since, he’s demonstrated his musical versatility in both comedy and drama,\n\nplaying such roles as the Underling, the butler in “The Drowsy Chaperone,” and\n\n440-year-old Merlin in “Camelot.”\n\n“I’ve been in about 65 (Stages musicals),” he said.\n\n“I’m so grateful to Michael Hamilton and Jack Lane, and the\n\nteam at Stages, how they value the artists. Stages gives us Equity performers more\n\nwork weeks than any company in St. Louis in the summer. They make it possible\n\nfor us to get health insurance, and live and work here,” he said.\n\n“Oklahoma” at Stages St. Louis 2018. Photo by Peter WochniakAnother benefit of being part of a company is the\n\nfriendships forged. For “Indecent,” he was fortunate to work with his longtime\n\nfriend, Ellen Isom, who choreographed the show. They’ve been friends since\n\n1991.\n\n“She is not only one of the absolute treasures of St. Louis\n\ntheater, but she’s first a terrific human being,” he said.\n\nJohn has been active in several regional professional theaters, including The New Jewish Theatre, Upstream Theater, The Black Rep, Shakespeare Festival St. Louis and the former HotCity.\n\nAs Saul Mortera in “New Jerusalem” at New Jewish Theatre, with Rob Riordan.He appeared in three shows at The Muny — “My One and Only” (2008) and “Meet Me in St. Louis” and “Camelot” in 2009.\n\nIn 2015, St. Louis Post-Dispatch Go! Magazine List named him Best St. Louis Stage Actor.\n\n“Indecent” is one of his biggest challenges – and one of\n\nthe finest productions he’s been part of to date, he said.\n\nJohn plays The Elder: Otto, and then as part of the\n\nensemble, he performs various characters Yekel, Peretz, Schildkraut, Immigrant,\n\nBartender, Judge McIntyre and older Asch.\n\n“What a role!” he said about Otto.\n\nBut he has seven others too. “I am on stage the entire\n\ntime,” he said.\n\nMaking each character different as part of the ensemble is\n\nthe daunting task.\n\n“That’s the biggest challenge. They are from different times,\n\nand to make sure they have different dialects. The play spans 50 years,” he said.\n\n“They are all old guys like me. That’s the one thing they have in common.”\n\nWhen the characters speak their native language, they speak\n\nperfect English, but when they speak a second or third language, they speak\n\nEnglish with an accent.\n\nA fierce indictment of censorship as well as a celebration\n\nof art and love, “Indecent” combines theater, music, dance and poetry to make\n\nan impact in an era of chaos. Flack is among the seven actors and three\n\nmusicians who play roles that span continents and decades.\n\nBy Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Paula Vogel,\n\n“Indecent” is the true story of a groundbreaking scandalous play and the\n\ncourageous artists who risked their careers and lives to perform it. During its\n\n2017 run on Broadway, it won\n\nSholem Asch’s drama, “God of Vengeance” debuted\n\non Broadway in 1923 at a time when waves of immigrants were changing the face\n\nof America. A love story that celebrated Yiddish language and unconventional\n\npassion, it was forced from the stage by a reactionary, fearful public. Its fate, and that of the actors who\n\ncherished it even as they confronted the horrors of the Nazi onslaught, are the\n\nsubject of “Indecent.”\n\n“It’s a lovely script, beautifully written and poetic, and it’s very prescient for our time,” he said.\n\n“Indecent” by Max and Louie ProductionsProducing Artistic Director Stellie Siteman issued a\n\nstatement: “As a proud member of St. Louis’ vibrant LGBTQ, Jewish, and Theatre\n\ncommunities, I can think of no better play at this moment in time that\n\ndramatizes a message of inclusion, tolerance and love. The belief in the power\n\nof art is a clarion call to action.”\n\nJoanne Gordon directed. Ron McGowan is the musical\n\ndirector. Ellen Isom choreographed. Besides Flack, “Indecent” stars Alyssa\n\nAvery, Zoe Farmingdale, Katie Karel, TJ Lancaster, Judi Mann, Kris Pineda and\n\nTim Schall.\n\n“It’s a wonderful cast, really a delightful group. I love\n\nworking with these people,” John said. “And the music is tremendous.”\n\nHe is also a fan of the renovated Grandel, where the show\n\nhas been staged.\n\n“It’s a great space, and we have a lot of positive energy\n\nhere,” he said.\n\nJohn Flack won a St. Louis Circle Award as Don.\n\nHe has worked with Max and Louie Productions before, in Ken\n\nPage’s original play, “Sublime Intimacy.” Page not only wrote it but directed\n\nthe show in 2015.\n\n“Sublime Intimacy” was the tale of five friends who were elevated,\n\ntouched and changed by their love of a dancer and his dance overlaps,\n\nintertwines and informs each other.\n\nJohn won a St. Louis Theater Circle Award for playing Don,\n\nan ex-Hollywood actor – Outstanding Actor in a Supporting Role in a Drama.\n\nAs Dan in “Next to Normal” He has been nominated\n\nfour times for St. Louis Theater Circle Awards, for two HotCity productions –\n\nas Ned in “The Normal Heart” in 2014 (which also tied for Outstanding\n\nProduction of a Drama) and Charles Busch’s “The Divine Sister” in 2012, and as the\n\nhusband Dan in Insight Theatre Company’s “Next to Normal” musical in 2017.\n\nWith Eric Dean White in “The Normal Heart\n\n“Max and Louie\n\nProductions like to present an eclectic mix,” he said. “Stellie and De love to\n\nbring plays that they are passionate about to a St. Louis audience.”\n\nA mere few days\n\nafter “Indecent” closes June 30, he starts rehearsals on Tuesday, July 2 for “The\n\nAlmost True and Truly Remarkable Adventures of Israel Potter,” directed by\n\nHerbie Barnes, at the Bluff City Theater in Hannibal, Mo.\n\nHe joins an ensemble cast featuring Donna Weinsting,\n\nJennelle Gilreath-Owens, Brian Kim and Eric Geller, all playing multiple\n\ncharacters, while Erick Lindsey is Israel Potter.\n\nBased on a novel by Herman Melville, who supposedly rescued\n\na tattered journal from the trash in 19th century London. Potter, a\n\nsimple farmer, is drafted into the fledgling Continental Army of the United\n\nStates of America on the eve of his wedding. He’s captured by the British,\n\nimprisoned in England and then escapes, wanting only to return to his waiting\n\nbride and a peaceful life in America. What ensues instead is a madcap series of\n\nimprobable events that thrusts him into one grand adventure after another,\n\npreventing his return home.\n\nThe order this summer is drama, comedy then musical – more\n\nmemorable additions to the resume.\n\nWhat’s best about building an acting career in St. Louis is\n\nthe variety of work.\n\nAs Clarence Darrow in “Never the Sinner” at New Jewish TheatreJohn said St. Louis is great for not pigeonholing an actor.\n\nIf you want to do comedy but have been mainly cast in dramas, you can. Unlike\n\nother cities where you get typecast and they think you can only do one thing.\n\nLavonne Byers and John Flack in “The Divine Sister”\n\n“We feel very lucky in St. Louis to work on different stages,” he said.\n\nHere is our “Take Ten” Questionnaire with John Flack\n\n1. Why did you choose your profession/pursue the arts?\n\n“Wait a minute… I had a choice? I don’t remember it that\n\nway. In an early attempt at adulting, I tried three different career paths\n\noutside of the arts. Each one ended in failure, disappointment, and heartache.\n\nThen I needed a job, so I auditioned for a singing waiter gig on the old\n\nAdmiral riverboat. When that job ended, I auditioned for the next (Imaginary\n\nTheatre Company at The Rep); and so-on and so-on. I’ve just been putting one\n\nfoot in front of the other, following my heart’s desire and staying a step\n\nahead of creditors ever since.”\n\n2. How would your friends describe you?\n\n“I don’t have financial wealth, but I am blessed with an\n\nincredible wealth of dear friends and family. I don’t mean this to be glib or\n\ncute; but I think one of the reasons I’ve been so fortunate in this regard is\n\nbecause I was taught by my parents that what others think of me (or anything\n\nelse, really) is none of my business.”\n\n3. How do you like to spend your spare time?\n\n“I have a love/hate relationship with spare time. As a\n\nfree-lancer, empty space on my calendar is frightening to me, so I try to keep\n\nas little open space as possible. When I do have spare time, I like to do\n\nnothing. Take a break. Sit. Breath. Go on a hike with the dog. And, of course,\n\nnap.”\n\n4. What is your current obsession?\n\n“Dachshunds. And napping.”\n\n5. What would people be surprised to find out about\n\nyou?\n\n“Considering my obsession, people might be very surprised\n\nto learn that I like all dogs, not just Dachshunds. But I really, really like\n\nwiener dogs.\n\n6. Can you share one of your most defining moments in life?\n\n“Oh, no! Why are all of my “defining moments” so\n\nembarrassing? I’m going through them in my mind, and I think they ought stay\n\nthere. I really don’t think any of them are appropriate for print. Let’s go out\n\nfor cocktails, and I’ll tell you one or two choice ‘moments’ off the record.”\n\n7. Who do you admire most?\n\n“Those who remain calm, kind, and dignified under difficult\n\ncircumstances large and small.”\n\n8. What is at the top of on your bucket list?\n\n“Travel, travel, and more travel. Next up: The Eastern\n\nPacific rim next Spring. I can’t wait!”\n\n9. What is your favorite thing to do in St. Louis?\n\n“Eat. The restaurant scene in St. Louis is on fire. In\n\nfact, it reminds me a lot of the theatre scene here in that there are so many\n\ncreative, energetic people doing what they love with a strong commitment to the\n\nart and passion for excellence. Plus, I love food.”\n\n10. What’s next? “The Almost True and Truly Remarkable\n\nAdventures of Israel Potter” at Bluff City Theatre in Hannibal, Mo., then\n\n“Man of La Mancha” at Stages St. Louis. I ask you, am I a lucky guy?\n\nAs Col. Pickering in Stages St. Louis’ “My Fair Lady” along with good friend Zoe Vonder Haar.MORE ABOUT JOHN FLACK:\n\nName: John Flack\n\nAge: 56\n\nBirthplace: St. Louis\n\nCurrent location: St. Louis\n\nFamily: Married to Michael Marvaso\n\nEducation: Parkway West High School (for you curious STL locals), attended The\n\nConservatory of Theatre Arts at Webster University\n\nDay job: Equity Actor — which means I also have a list of side hustles the\n\nlength of my left arm\n\nFirst job: Busboy at Le Soupcon, Famous-Barr\n\nFirst role: Snoopy in “You’re a Good Man, Charlie Brown” Parkway West\n\nJr High.
