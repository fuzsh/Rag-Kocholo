        "text": "WORDtheatre never disappoints! Short stories are my go to for listening, and some of the greatest stories in the world are performed here by first rate actors! Every story and performance is a gem.\n\nOk. Maybe thatâs a bit presumptuous of a title, but if you are a fan of literature, theater, or just having someone sit you down and read you a story, then yes, this is why podcasts exist (perhaps even inventedð¤ðð).\n\nA bit different than an âaudiobookâ experience, as these performances, captured live, ignite that realm of actor/audience interactive attendance that characterizes and elevates your participation. I happily happen to have had the great fortune in attending WORD THEATER performances back when they were young (as was I), and other than the LA drive and finding a parking spot (âParking Spotâ! I was young!!), these episodes duplicates that delectable and âliterallyâ the most intimate experience between your ears. E N J O Y.\n\nArthur Millerâs âbulldogâ is a beautiful, poignant and evocative story about his adolescence in 1940s Brooklyn. Jeff Goldblum reads it like a stand-up comedy routine, and the sound mix leans hard into the audienceâs almost continuous, uproarious laughter. Itâs depressing. Itâs the same with Selected Shorts. The producers are afraid that audiences canât handle literature unless itâs presented as a comedy routine, with actors hamming it up for the audience like a summer camp talent show."
