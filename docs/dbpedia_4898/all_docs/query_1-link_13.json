        "text": "Jeanie Hackett will stage the biting comedy about infidelity that will run through April 18 at the Skirball Cultural Center.\n\nJoining Burton will be Stephen Collins, John de Lancie, Christina Pickles, Kirsten Potter, Rosalind Ayres and Mark Capri.\n\nHere's how LATW bills the production: \"There's something Constance Middleton's friends are dying to tell her: her husband is having an affair - with her best friend! Despite their hints, Constance remains ever cool, and seemingly oblivious. Or is she? In this biting comedy of manners, marriages and mistresses, Constance - a not-so-desperate housewife - has some ideas of her own about extra-marital activity that surprise everyone in the end.\"\n\nIn 2002 Kate Burton received dual Tony nominations: Best Actress in a Play for Hedda Gabler and Best Featured Actress in a Play for The Elephant Man. Burton has also appeared on Broadway in Spring Awakening, The Constant Wife (Tony nomination), The Beauty Queen of Leenane, An American Daughter, Company, Jake's Women, Some Americans Abroad, Wild Honey, Doonesbury, Alice in Wonderland and Present Laughter. Her screen credits include \"Celebrity,\" \"Ice Storm,\" \"First Wives Club\" and \"August.\"\n\nAs with all LATW productions, the play will be recorded and broadcast on LATW's nationally syndicated radio theatre series, \"The Play's the Thing.\" For tickets to any of \"The Play's the Thing\" productions at the Skirball Cultural Center, 2701 N. Sepulveda Boulevard, call the L.A. Theatre Works box office at (310) 827-0889."
