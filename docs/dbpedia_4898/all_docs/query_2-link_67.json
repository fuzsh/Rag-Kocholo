        "text": "Several years ago, I was pulling my hair out trying to figure out what I could and couldn’t eat. I didn’t know how to do a Mast Cell Activation Syndrome Diet back then.\n\nI just knew I was reacting to most foods. I had no clue what a low histamine or a Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) diet was.\n\nEvery time I ate, my hands and feet would swell up and get red. I’d be so itchy, I’d scratch at my hives until I bled.\n\nI had abdominal pain that was misdiagnosed as IBS. It was actually a bad leaky gut.\n\nAnd the number of foods I could eat without having reactions was minimal.\n\nI spent a lot of time studying and experimenting to figure out what was going on.\n\nEventually I discovered histamine. I also learned about other types of inflammatory foods.\n\nDid you know: Some “healthy” foods can actually make you worse if you have MCAS?\n\nI figured out how to eat foods that were healing for me. And how to spot foods that would make my Mast Cell Activation Syndrome worse.\n\nI got my inflammation way down by making good food choices. But it also took adding in:\n\nNervous system work\n\nAntihistamines\n\nEnzymes\n\nMedications\n\nMast cell-stabilizing supplements (like quercetin)\n\nAnd gently detoxing from mold\n\nI was eventually able to reintroduce a lot of foods. In fact, I’ve reversed most of my food intolerances at this point.\n\nI can eat strawberries without itching, insomnia, GI distress, headaches, or anxiety. I can eat in restaurants. I’ve increased my oxalates. Even FODMAPs are improving.\n\nI can eat rice and some pressure cooked winter squashes now. But I’ll likely not re-introduce these as a staple due to their inflammatory nature.\n\nThese days, I eat a wide variety of healthy and healing foods. The itchy hives, sleep issues, and leaky gut are gone. And my MCAS is under control.\n\nAre you having reactions to foods?\n\nRead on to learn what to eat and not to eat for the MCAS diet.\n\nIt’s important you know that this blog post is for informational and educational purposes. It’s not meant to treat any health condition or to be prescriptive for anyone. If you have any medical condition, it is critical you work under the care and guidance of a licensed medical provider.\n\nWhat is the Mast Cell Activation Syndrome Diet?\n\nThe Mast Cell Activation Syndrome Diet (MCAS Diet) incorporates the Low Histamine Diet as one part.\n\nThat’s because even if you don’t have Histamine Intolerance, you may still get relief from some of your MCAS symptoms by switching to a low histamine diet.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nHigh histamine foods can still trigger mast cells to release high levels of other inflammatory mediators.\n\nBut if you trial a low histamine diet for 6 weeks and don’t notice any differences with adding histamine foods back in, then you may not be sensitive to histamine.\n\nIf you don’t notice a difference with a low histamine diet then eating anti-inflammatory, nutrient dense, and avoiding sugar, wheat, and dairy may be very helpful for you.\n\nThe MCAS diet emphasizes choosing low histamine foods that are:\n\nAnti-inflammatory – because inflammation sparks mast cells\n\nNutrient dense – fresh, healthy foods may help calm your immune system\n\nFree of major allergens – since most are inflammatory for many\n\nHowever, those with Mast Cell Activation Syndrome may have specific food triggers.\n\nSo be sure to test for food intolerances and food sensitivities with your practitioner.\n\nLet’s look at each of these factors of the MCAS Diet in more detail.\n\nLow Histamine MCAS Diet\n\nHistamine triggers the mast cells. And when mast cells are triggered, they can release more histamine. This histamine then triggers the mast cells. And on and on.\n\nIt’s a cycle you want to break.\n\nAnd one way you can do this is to choose lower histamine foods.\n\nSo, the most important part of the MCAS Diet is that it is low histamine.\n\nIf Histamine Intolerance is your only concern, a low histamine diet can be helpful in reducing your symptoms.\n\nBut if you also have Mast Cell Activation Syndrome, you’ll want to consider these other food factors, too.\n\nAnti-Inflammatory MCAS Diet\n\nAn effective MCAS Diet will emphasize clean, anti-inflammatory foods.\n\nMost of these are going to be whole foods like fruits, veggies, and clean meats.\n\nEven your low histamine food choices affect how much inflammation you have.\n\nFor example, trans fats are technically low histamine, but it’s inflammatory which will still raise histamine levels in the body.\n\nInflammation triggers immune cells and mast cells to become more reactive. The more inflammation, the more immune response and MCAS symptoms.\n\nSo, you’ll want to focus on eating anti-inflammatory foods in your Mast Cell Activation Syndrome Diet.\n\nSimilarly, the MCAS Diet is also nutrient dense.\n\nNutrient Dense MCAS Diet\n\nThe best MCAS diet is going to be full of nutrients that will help your body heal itself.\n\nIn the MC360TM Method, we emphasize feeding and nourishing your mast cells, so they don’t release extra histamine.\n\nThis is why our low histamine recipes list the top nutrients and their health benefits.\n\nFood forms the building blocks for everything in our bodies.\n\nCertain foods are healing. Other foods are damaging.\n\nFoods that tend to be allergenic can also be a problem. Let’s look at that next.\n\nAllergy Friendly MCAS Diet\n\nLastly, the MCAS Diet avoids the major food allergies (which are usually inflammatory.)\n\nMany people who try eating low histamine still eat inflammatory foods and low nutrient foods (like many processed foods.)\n\nThis can lead to them still feeling ill.\n\nThere are different arms of the immune system that can react to food. Not all are technically allergies, but these foods still cause inflammation.\n\nThe major allergens to avoid initially are:\n\nGluten\n\nCorn\n\nDairy\n\nPeanuts\n\nSoybeans\n\nSome of the food groups listed above are high histamine or histamine liberating. So, you’d want to avoid those anyway.\n\nBut corn, for example, isn’t high histamine. Yet, it can still be an issue. Some dairy is low histamine, too. But things like lactose and casein which are found in dairy may be causing trouble for your body.\n\nThe MCAS Diet recommends low histamine foods. And it also encourages you to eat foods that won’t trigger your body to produce histamine.\n\nTo review, the Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) diet is:\n\nLow histamine\n\nAnti-inflammatory\n\nNutrient dense\n\nFree of major allergens\n\nLet’s take a quick look at how this works.\n\nMast Cell Mediators\n\nThe best MCAS Diet emphasizes anti-inflammatory and nutrient dense food because histamine isn’t the only mediator that can spark your mast cells.\n\nIn addition to histamine, other mediators that mast cells release as part of the immune response in your body include:\n\nLeukotrienes – blood vessel constriction or dilation\n\nTryptase – allergic responses and immunity\n\nCytokines\n\nProstaglandins\n\nInterleukins\n\nAnd hundreds of others\n\nWhen your mast cell mediators have gone haywire, all this inflammation can lead to:\n\nAllergic reactions\n\nConstipation\n\nDiarrhea\n\nItching\n\nBloating\n\nCramping\n\nRashes\n\nHives\n\nAbdominal pain\n\nIBS\n\nAnaphylaxis\n\nSleep problems\n\nRelated Article: Cytokines, Mast Cells, and Mast Cell Activation Syndrome\n\nNow that you know more about what to eat, we’ll explore more on what to avoid on the MCAS Diet.\n\nBut first, a note on histamine food lists.\n\nA Note on Histamine Food Lists\n\nThere are a number of high and low histamine food lists online.\n\nHere’s the problem with most histamine food lists. They were created through studies on small groups of people and were not well controlled.\n\nThis means the researchers usually didn’t know if someone was reacting because of Histamine Intolerance or to something else.\n\nSo, what happened is that many foods that aren’t actually high histamine were put on the ‘do not eat’ list. While some foods that are high histamine were mislabeled on low histamine diet lists.\n\nAlso, many lists leave out the histamine liberators. These are foods that may technically be low histamine, but they spark the body to release histamine.\n\nSome examples are walnuts, citrus or certain teas.\n\nBefore you go any further, here’s what I want you to know. Everyone is different in how foods affect them.\n\nIf you have MCAS or Histamine Intolerance, you probably have a hard enough time finding foods you can eat.\n\nDo your best and know that you may need to make exceptions sometimes.\n\nFor example, if you are down to only 10 foods and one happens to be high histamine, it’s usually better to keep that food for now.\n\nYou want to get as much variety in your diet as possible. It’s always best to swap instead of drop when you can. And it’s important to work with someone if you are struggling.\n\nBut generally speaking, it is important to identify the foods that are the highest histamine and replace them with lower histamine choices.\n\nYou can find my well researched low histamine foods list to help give you some ideas!\n\nIf you aren’t sure what you might be reacting to, keep a food and symptoms journal. You can use this info to see what works best for you.\n\nNext up, take a look at histamines and the MCAS diet.\n\nMast Cell Activation Syndrome Diet: What to Avoid\n\nIf you have MCAS, you’ve probably heard about histamines.\n\nYour body naturally makes histamine, which is an important mediator for digestion. It is also a part of the immune system and nervous system with receptors all over your body.\n\nProper balance of histamine levels is really important for good gut health.\n\nBut with MCAS, these histamine levels can easily get out of control. Too much histamine is inflammatory. And that inflammation causes the mast cells to release even more histamine.\n\nMast cells release over 200 other inflammatory chemicals when the receptors get stuck in this loop. It’s called degranulation when the mast cells become hyperactive.\n\nRelated Article: Mast Cell Foundations: Mediators and Receptors\n\nSo, it is really important to keep those histamine levels in check.\n\nMany foods naturally have histamine content in them. And some foods cause the body to release histamine.\n\nHere are the main ways histamine comes from food:\n\nNaturally in some food – eggplants, strawberries, banana, pineapple, etc. (see more below)\n\nHistamine liberators – that cause mast cells to release histamine like citrus, walnuts, cinnamon, cloves, etc.\n\nHistamine producing bacteria – in foods that give hospitable environment like being high in protein, high moisture content, or fermented\n\nThe most common sources of histamine producing bacteria are:\n\nGround meats\n\nAged meats\n\nFish that wasn’t gutted or frozen soon after catch\n\nLeftovers in the fridge\n\nDried fruit (still has some moisture)\n\nNote: Fats don’t tend to harbor bacteria that grow histamine.\n\nAnd low histamine very dry foods like uncooked rice or dried sorghum pasta are okay.\n\nWhile most of the people I work with at Mast Cell 360 also have Histamine Intolerance, not everyone with MCAS does.\n\nRelated Post: Do You Have One or Both? Histamine Intolerance vs MCAS (Mast Cell Activation Syndrome)\n\nBut with either case, avoiding high histamine foods can be helpful.\n\nHigh Histamine Foods to Avoid in the MCAS Diet\n\nBased on what we just learned about what foods are high in histamine, here are some more comprehensive lists.\n\nAged, Cultured, Fermented Foods and Leftovers\n\nRemember, any foods with bacteria in them can create high histamine. So, anything that is out of date, spoiled, moldy, or not fresh is higher histamine.\n\nThis also means leftovers become higher histamine the longer they sit.\n\nThat rotisserie chicken at the grocery store that has been sitting all day is building high histamine levels.\n\nMeat in the refrigerator section increases in histamines.\n\nFermenting, culturing, and aging increases histamines too.\n\nMost beef and bison are especially high histamine because they get aged for at least 2 weeks before going to market.\n\nLook out for these types of high histamine foods:\n\nFermented alcoholic beverages:\n\nWine\n\nChampagne\n\nBeer\n\nWhiskey\n\nBrandy\n\nFermented foods:\n\nSauerkraut\n\nVinegar\n\nSoy sauce\n\nKefir\n\nYogurt\n\nKombucha\n\nSoured foods:\n\nSour cream\n\nSour milk\n\nButtermilk\n\nSoured bread\n\nVinegar foods:\n\nPickles\n\nMayonnaise\n\nOlives\n\nKetchup\n\nCured meats:\n\nBacon\n\nSalami\n\nPepperoni\n\nLuncheon meats\n\nHot dogs\n\nGround meat (increased surface area increases histamines)\n\nBeef (aging process increases histamine)\n\nSmoked or processed meats:\n\nSalami\n\nBacon\n\nHam\n\nSausage\n\nAged cheese, including goat cheese\n\nSmoked fish (fish not gutted within minutes of catch)\n\nAnchovies\n\nSardines\n\nDried fruit:\n\nApricots\n\nPrunes\n\nDates\n\nFigs\n\nRaisins\n\nUncooked egg whites (histamine liberator)\n\nLeftovers\n\nLearn more about identifying high histamine foods in this blog post.\n\nFruits, Vegetables, and Nuts High in Histamines\n\nThere are only a few fruits, vegetables, and nuts that are high in histamines or release histamines.\n\nDo any of these foods bother you?\n\nWalnuts\n\nCashews\n\nPeanuts\n\nSpinach\n\nMushrooms\n\nEggplant\n\nAvocado\n\nPineapple\n\nStrawberries\n\nMost citrus (small amounts lemons and limes sometimes ok)\n\nThese are all examples of high histamine fruits, vegetables, and nuts.\n\nI used to always itch badly when I ate walnuts or pineapple. Spinach made me not be able to sleep. And strawberries gave me a migraine.\n\nFortunately, there are still plenty of other fruits, veggies, and nuts you can enjoy that won’t cause histamine-related reactions.\n\nInflammatory Oils\n\nAvoid canola oil, corn oil, safflower oil, and peanut oil. These are inflammatory oils.\n\nCold pressed sunflower oil is usually ok in small amounts.\n\nHerbs & Spices\n\nYou want to avoid using dried spices that have been sitting in your cupboards for a long time. Fresh are best.\n\nBut some herbs, even fresh, can liberate histamine and cause mast cell reactions.\n\nAvoid or restrict:\n\nAnise\n\nCinnamon\n\nCloves\n\nCurry powder\n\nPaprika\n\nNutmeg\n\nI have some ideas for what to use that will help lower histamine instead further down!\n\nSpiking Your Blood Sugar\n\nOn the MCAS diet, you’ll need to be careful with sweeteners, high glycemic fruits, and refined carbs.\n\nThis is because increases in blood sugar can cause inflammation. And inflammation increases mast cell reactions.\n\nYou want to be sure to avoid:\n\nSugar\n\nArtificial sweeteners (like sugar alcohols)\n\nCorn syrup\n\nThese are all very inflammatory.\n\nBut don’t fear! I have some sweetening solutions for you below in the what to eat section.\n\nProcessed Foods and Additives\n\nYou want to avoid packaged and processed foods as much as possible. Period.\n\nThis may seem obvious, but many people with MCAS still eat lots of packaged foods. They think if the label says organic or gluten free then it must be healthy.\n\nCrackers, chips, cereal, and frozen dinners can be a problem. Canned foods, boxed nut milks, cookies, prepared sauces, and protein bars are higher histamine and inflammatory too.\n\nPackaged foods are highly processed to make them shelf stable. (Think chips from dried rice or sorghum pasta.)\n\nThis destroys the nutrients your body so desperately needs. Avoid sugar, additives, colorings, flavorings – anything artificial.\n\nIn addition to avoiding processed and packaged foods, watch out for these additives that can wreak havoc with mast cells:\n\nCarrageenan\n\nSodium benzoate\n\nPotassium sorbate\n\nLecithin\n\nMsg\n\nCitric acid\n\nSodium triphosphate\n\nPotassium triphosphate\n\nSodium nitrite\n\nMaltodextrin\n\nCalcium chloride\n\nXanthan gum\n\nFood colorings\n\nSmoke flavoring\n\nYeast extract\n\nHistamine In Your Supplements\n\nYou even need to be careful that your supplements aren’t fermented!\n\nOne of the most common fermented supplements is vitamin C.\n\nAll of the supplements I recommend across this site are low histamine.\n\nAnd I have a supplement course that goes more in-depth on supporting calm mast cells, how to onboard things, and troubleshooting tips.\n\nMy Top 8 Mast Cell Supporting Supplements class is online so you can access it anytime, from anywhere, and go at your own pace.\n\nOther Mast Cell Triggering Foods\n\nBeyond histamines, you may need to rule out other foods that are inflammatory for you.\n\nSome of the most common ones are:\n\nLectins\n\nOxalates\n\nSalicylates\n\nFODMAPs\n\nSulfur\n\nThese are types of foods in addition to histamine that can affect MCAS.\n\nThese aren’t like allergies with antibodies, but you may still react to them.\n\nKeep reading to learn more.\n\nBefore you change your diet on your own, please make sure you’re working with a healthcare practitioner who can help you with this. Never limit foods unnecessarily, and always have a medical provider who is supervising your case.\n\nLectins\n\nLectins are proteins found in certain plants.\n\nMore and more research indicates that lectins activate mast cells in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nLow lectin diets can make a big difference in mast cell issues.\n\nSo, you may need to consider whether lectins are affecting you.\n\nOxalates\n\nOxalates are tiny crystals that are also found in plants.\n\nPeople with dysbiosis, leaky gut, low B1 or B6, and certain genetic predispositions can have more trouble with oxalates than others.\n\nFungal species like molds and candida feed on oxalates. So people dealing with these issues can have more trouble with oxalates. You can have oxalate issues from leaky gut and Mold Toxicity as well.\n\nI find oxalate issues in about 50% of my clients with MCAS.\n\nYou can order the Great Plains Organic Acid Test for yourself below, to see if oxalates might be an issue for you.\n\n>>> US – Order the Great Plains (now Mosaic DX) Organic Acid Test\n\n>>> Canada – Order the Great Plains (now Mosaic DX) Organic Acid Test\n\nBut know that the OAT test doesn’t always catch oxalate issues. That’s because oxalates can be stored in the tissues and not excreted in the urine.\n\nSalicylates\n\nSalicylate issues are less frequent but do occur.\n\nSalicylates are found in many plants, especially in mint.\n\nSome people start to have trouble breaking down salicylates. And Salicylate Intolerance is very common in Mold Toxicity.\n\nThis can cause a variety of symptoms similar to MCAS.\n\nFODMAPs\n\nFODMAPs are a type of short chain carbohydrates and sugar alcohols found in foods like:\n\nBeans\n\nOnions\n\nGarlic\n\nBrussel sprouts\n\nCauliflower\n\nSometimes people end up with FODMAP sensitivity when their gut flora gets out of balance.\n\nIt can be tricky to track down sulfur and FODMAP sensitivities. These usually require elimination diets.\n\nFODMAP Intolerance is common with Small Intestine Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO). If you suspect you have that, here’s more on SIBO and Histamine Intolerance, and how to do a SIBO Diet.\n\nSulfurs\n\nSulfur foods can cause trouble for some people. It mostly affects people with genetic weaknesses for sulfur metabolism or those low in B6 and/or molybdenum.\n\nIdentifying Food Triggers in MCAS\n\nBe sure to think beyond histamines and consider whether you may have any other food sensitivities or IgE allergies.\n\nYou may want to consider giving the low histamine diet at least 6 weeks to see if it helps. Always talk with your doctor about any changes to your diet.\n\nThen do a challenge with reintroducing high histamine foods for 2-3 days and see if symptoms increase. If there is no change, then histamine may not be a problem.\n\nThose with autoimmunity, gut, and/or heart problems, may want to try 6 weeks low histamine and low lectin.\n\nAsk your healthcare provider about doing a challenge with reintroducing several servings of high histamine foods for 2-3 days and see if symptoms increase. If there is no change, then histamine may not be a problem.\n\nAfter that, 2-3 days of reintroducing several servings of high lectin foods for 2-3 days to see if symptoms increase. If there is no change, then lectins may not be a problem.\n\nI’ve outlined the phases in more detail in this post on Lectin Intolerance.\n\nIf there is joint pain, muscle pain (like fibromyalgia), urinary burning, interstitial cystitis, chronic UTI type symptoms with negative culture, then it may be worthwhile to explore Oxalate Intolerance.\n\nBut this needs to be done under the guidance of a healthcare practitioner. Oxalates are tricky to navigate.\n\nDo NOT go cold turkey off of oxalates. (Learn more about the low oxalate diet) It can trigger oxalate dumping and kidney stones, which are extremely painful.\n\nIdentifying your personal food triggers can go a long way toward helping you feel better.\n\nWhat Can I Eat in a Mast Cell Activation Syndrome Diet?\n\nIt’s not unusual to feel overwhelmed when you first start the low histamine diet. At first, you may feel like there is nothing left to eat.\n\nBut truly, there are so many nutritious and flavorful foods you can eat.\n\nIt is easy to feel deprived if you just focus on the foods you can’t have. This is a sure road to feeling angry, resentful, and depressed.\n\nFocus on replacing food instead of removing. For example, eat arugula and lettuce, as a swap for spinach and curly kale, in salad and other dishes.\n\nThe key is to think about how much eating fresh, nutritious foods will improve your health. Focus on choosing the foods that are healing and that you enjoy.\n\nSometimes it is good to splurge on yourself. I don’t mean buying a chocolate cake. I mean by spending a little extra time in the kitchen making something healthy and delicious just for you.\n\nSome of my favorite low histamine treats are:\n\nScones with Blueberry or Cream Topping – Medium Oxalate and Low Lectin\n\nLow FODMAP Ice Cream – Low Lectin and Low Oxalate\n\n“Yogurt” Parfait – Low Oxalate and Low Lectin\n\nCarrot Cake – Low Lectin and Low to Medium Oxalate\n\nEat Fresh Foods on the Mast Cell Activation Syndrome Diet\n\nBe sure you are eating fresh, whole, nutrient dense foods.\n\nAs produce ages, it loses nutrition. The fresher your foods are, the more vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants they have.\n\nWhen you have MCAS, you need as many nutrients from healthy foods as you can get. These nutrients support a healthy immune system.\n\nThey are also necessary to make histamine degrading enzymes, like DAO and HNMT.\n\nSo, nutrient rich foods also have the added bonus of helping to lower histamine.\n\nBe sure to buy your produce as fresh as possible.\n\nLook for these vegetables with their tops still attached:\n\nCarrots (Note: raw is high oxalate, 1/2 cup of boiled with cooking water discarded is medium oxalate)\n\nRadishes\n\nBeets (Note: Very high oxalate)\n\nTIP: Be sure to cut the tops off when you get home so they don’t suck any more nutrients out of the roots.\n\nIf you can, get produce at the farmer’s market or even grow your own for the most nutrient dense options.\n\nThe book Eating on the Wild Side by Jo Robinson is a great resource on the highest nutrient varieties of fruits and vegetables.\n\nEmphasize Vegetables on the MCAS Diet\n\nEmphasize vegetables!\n\nCover most of your plate with vegetables.\n\nYes, this means lots of vegetables.\n\nVegetables have nutrients and antioxidants you need to heal.\n\nThese are histamine lowering, low oxalate, low lectin vegetables you can emphasize:\n\nArugula\n\nBok Choy\n\nBroccoli\n\nBrussels Sprouts\n\nCabbage, Green and Red\n\nCauliflower\n\nCollards\n\nKale (flat dinosaur or lacinato kind – curly is high oxalate)\n\nNapa Cabbage / Chinese Cabbage\n\nWatercress\n\nOnions, Any\n\nLeeks\n\nChives\n\nScallions (green onions – especially use green parts)\n\nRadishes\n\nDaikon Radishes\n\nCilantro\n\nAsparagus\n\nGarlic\n\nRomaine, Red and Green Leaf Lettuce\n\nKohlrabi\n\nMesclun\n\nEndive\n\nDandelion Greens\n\nButter Lettuce\n\nFennel\n\nEscarole\n\nMustard Greens\n\nMizuna\n\nBasil\n\nMint\n\nPerilla (Shiso)\n\nMaking sure you get as many nutrient-rich vegetables as possible will help your body heal.\n\nEat Clean Protein on the MCAS Diet\n\nIn addition to eating lots of veggies, you’ll want to choose clean proteins.\n\nIf you eat meat, look for pasture raised and organic.\n\nPasture-raised chicken, pork, lamb, and turkey are a few good options to consider.\n\nCheck the sell by dates and make sure you get the freshest packages.\n\nFor the lowest histamine levels, get meat and seafood that has been frozen right after slaughter or catch.\n\nCook frozen meats in a pressure cooker. (I use an Instant Pot.)\n\nThe next best option is to thaw your meat in the refrigerator (not on the counter). Thaw until it is still just a little frosty.\n\nFinally, avoid slow cooking which allows histamine levels to go up.\n\nRelated Post: The Best Tips for Keeping Meat Low Histamine\n\nOther good options for pasture raised meats are farmers markets.\n\nI use a local farmer as well as these favorite producers:\n\nNorthstar Bison >>> Get 10% off with code MASTCELL360\n\nWhite Oak Pastures >>> Get 10% off your first purchase with code MASTCELL360\n\nVital Choice\n\nFor fish, I recommend Vital Choice and Northstar Bison. They both use sustainable fishing methods.\n\nLook for the low histamine fish frozen within 2 hours after catch. If you try fish, start with a small amount first to make sure you don’t react.\n\nThose with both MCAS and Histamine Intolerance may still have a hard time with fish and may need to take DAO Enzyme before meals. Many wait until phase 2 of the low histamine diet to try fish.\n\nI get my meat delivered to me frozen. Once I get it, I put it in the freezer right away to prevent histamine levels from rising.\n\nWhen I’m ready to prepare it, I thaw the meat in the fridge until it is still a little frosty to keep histamine levels low.\n\nPasture raised chicken, duck, or quail eggs are also a good protein source.\n\nSome people react to eggs, though. So, you’ll need to test them for yourself.\n\nBe sure to cook egg whites thoroughly.\n\nDepending on your situation, you might also use protein powder.\n\nUnfortunately, I haven’t found a protein powder that checks all these boxes:\n\nHistamine Intolerance\n\nOxalate Intolerance\n\nLectin Intolerance\n\nSalicylate Intolerance\n\nMost protein powders will be high in salicylates.\n\nRice and pea protein are lectins.\n\nHemp protein is high oxalate.\n\nSoy is high histamine.\n\nI’ve found one that is lower histamine with lower levels of salicylates and oxalates.\n\nBut it does have rice and pea protein. So, it won’t be well tolerated with Lectin Intolerance.\n\nHowever, if you aren’t concerned about lectins, you can look into this Ultrameal Advanced Protein Powder by Metagenics to see if it might be right for you.\n\nAnd if you don’t have trouble with oxalates, this Hemp Yeah! protein is one to consider.\n\nIt tastes great in my low histamine smoothies like this cherry smoothie recipe.\n\nI know these lists feel long but there are still so many delicious foods you are able to eat on a MCAS diet.\n\nLegumes\n\nLegumes can cause histamine release and are also high oxalate and high lectin.\n\nSo, you may need to be careful with these. In the MC360TM Method, we recommend avoiding them during the first phase on the MCAS Diet.\n\nFats\n\nHealthy fats are needed for overall health, too. Be sure you are getting enough good fats.\n\nFats are necessary for healthy brain cells and to make hormones.\n\nAlso, some vitamins are fat soluble. This means they are best absorbed when eaten with fats.\n\nSo, add healthy fats to your vegetables to absorb the most nutrition.\n\nHealthy fat sources include:\n\nGrass fed ghee\n\nVery fresh extra-virgin olive oil\n\nVirgin coconut oil\n\nCold-pressed flax oil\n\nCold pressed avocado oil\n\nUnrefined palm oil\n\nNuts\n\nFresh nuts can be a good source of protein and fat when eaten in moderation.\n\nBuy nuts as fresh as possible.\n\nTo make them more digestible, soak them overnight in salt water. Then dry in a food dehydrator or oven at 250 degrees.\n\nYou can also make your own fresh nut butters using a VitaMix or Blendtec blender.\n\nThe best low histamine, low to medium oxalate, and low lectin choices are:\n\nFlax Seeds, under 1/2 cup\n\nMacadamias, under ¼ cup\n\nPistachios, under ¼ cup\n\nCoconut\n\nPecans, under ¼ cup\n\nKeep the pecans, pistachios, and macadamias to 1/4 cup to stay low oxalate.\n\nIf you don’t have oxalate issues, you can also enjoy:\n\nAlmonds (blanched to remove lectins in the skin)\n\nHazelnuts\n\nPine Nuts\n\nSesame Seeds\n\nBrazil Nuts (only 3-4/day)\n\nHemp Seeds\n\nHemp Protein Powder\n\nPumpkin and sunflower seeds are lower oxalate and lower histamine but do contain lectins.\n\nHerbs\n\nSeason with a lot of fresh herbs.\n\nFresh herbs are some of the most nutrient-dense foods. And they are antioxidant foods.\n\nCultures that use a lot of fresh herbs live longer than those that don’t use herbs. Plus, adding herbs to your meals will give them more flavor.\n\nIf you enjoy what you are eating, you’ll be more likely to stick to making healthy choices.\n\nThese are all excellent histamine lowering herbs:\n\nGinger\n\nBasil\n\nChives\n\nOregano\n\nGarlic\n\nPeppermint\n\nRosemary\n\nFruits\n\nFruits should be eaten as a dessert.\n\nThis is due to higher sugar content. Spikes in blood sugar affect the mast cells.\n\nPrioritize lower sugar berries like blueberries. Tart cherries and green apples are also good choices.\n\nA squeeze of lemon or lime are ok, if you tolerate them.\n\nIf you don’t have trouble with oxalates, blackberries are lower in sugar.\n\nOther lower histamine, low lectin, low oxalate fruits are:\n\nApples (any)\n\nApricots (fresh, not dried)\n\nCherries\n\nFresh Cranberries\n\nFresh Currant\n\nFresh Figs\n\nGrapes (especially black)\n\nHoneydew\n\nKiwi (Golden is medium oxalate at 1/2 cup)\n\nMango\n\nNectarine\n\nPeach\n\nPear\n\nRaspberries\n\nLarge servings of fruit have higher sugar levels though.\n\nSo, again, think of these as healthy, tasty desserts rather than as staples.\n\nHowever, currants and cranberries are very low sugar.\n\nGrains and Carbs\n\nSome people do better with carbs and some worse.\n\nExperiment to find what works best for you.\n\nI find grains increase my inflammation. I do better with lower levels of carbs. I think this is because many grains are high lectin and high oxalate.\n\nToo low carb keeps me from sleeping, though.\n\nFinding your own optimal carb intake takes a little trial and error.\n\nYou might be able to use the flour of the cassava root as a carb. I use this to make cassava tortillas and pizza crusts.\n\nIf you get cassava, be sure to buy Otto’s brand. It is the only one that isn’t fermented.\n\nYou can try these sources of low lectin, low oxalate carbs too:\n\nTiger Nut flour\n\nFlax meal\n\nHi-maize resistant starch\n\nCoconut\n\nShirataki noodles\n\nRutabagas\n\nTurnips\n\nIf oxalates aren’t a problem for you, then histamine-lowering sweet potatoes are a great carb choice.\n\nSweeteners\n\nSweeteners should be kept to a minimum.\n\nThere are some good sweetener options that don’t affect blood sugar, though.\n\nThese are:\n\nStevia\n\nMonk fruit\n\nInulin\n\nThese come from plants, and our bodies don’t metabolize them like sugar.\n\nBe sure you get stevia, monk fruit, and inulin without other additives.\n\nOften they have sugar alcohols added, which isn’t good for MCAS. So you have to check the ingredients.\n\nI use the 100% pure monk fruit powder from Smart Monk.\n\nYou can also use coconut sugar in moderation for a treat.\n\nCoconut sugar affects blood sugar more slowly than regular sugar.\n\nHoney, molasses, and maple syrup do have some good nutrients. They also have a big impact on blood sugar, so use sparingly.\n\nHandling Leftovers\n\nLeftovers grow histamine quickly.\n\nYou’ll want to freeze your leftovers if they are going to be kept more than a couple hours in the fridge.\n\nI try to make a double batch of whatever I’m cooking. Then I freeze the leftovers in single serving containers.\n\nMaking batches and freezing them in single servings makes it easy to pull out a healthy meal to take for lunch or have for dinner after a busy day.\n\nWhen I worked in an office, for lunches, I put the frozen meal in my lunchbox and put it in the fridge. By lunch time, it is usually mostly thawed. You can also thaw foods by running hot water over the container. Then reheat in a pan or toaster oven.\n\nSometimes, you might have to use a microwave. I just trust that my nutrient dense foods outweigh any negatives of occasional microwave use.\n\nBut you should know, I leave the room when the microwave is running and go to the other side of the house.\n\nI store leftovers in glass or silicone bags to avoid chemicals from plastics leaching into food.\n\nStill not sure what to eat?\n\nSample Meal Ideas for the MCAS Diet\n\nHere are some of my favorite low histamine meals ideas.\n\nMast Cell Activation Syndrome Diet Breakfast:\n\n“Pumpkin Spice” Drink – Low FODMAP, Low Lectin & Low Oxalate\n\nFrozen Vanilla Coffee Cooler – Low Lectin, Low Oxalate & Low FODMAP\n\nBlueberry Cassava Flour Muffins – Low Lectin & Medium Oxalate, with Low Salicylate Options\n\nEverything Bagel Bread – Low Lectin, Low FODMAP & Medium Oxalate\n\nTiger Nut Cereal – Low Lectin, Low FODMAP & Medium Oxalate\n\nMast Cell Activation Syndrome Diet Lunch:\n\nLow Histamine Pizza – Low Oxalate & Low Lectin\n\nMango Blueberry Basil Salad – Low Oxalate & Low Lectin\n\nRoast Chicken Salad with Rosemary Dressing – Low Oxalate & Low Lectin\n\nSesame Chicken Salad with Asian Salad Dressing – Low Oxalate, Low Lectin & Low FODMAP\n\nWaldorf Salad – Low lectin, Medium Oxalate, and with Low Salicylate Options\n\nWarming Chicken Ginger Soup – Low Oxalate, Low Lectin & Low FODMAP\n\nLeek and Fennel Soup – Low Lectin, Low Oxalate & Low Salicylate\n\nCreamy Cauliflower Veggie Soup\n\nMast Cell Activation Syndrome Diet Snack:\n\nRoasted Garlic Hummus – Low Oxalate & Low Lectin\n\nPesto – Low Lectin, Medium Oxalate, with Low FODMAP options\n\nFlaxseed Crackers – Low Lectin & Medium Oxalate\n\nCassava Herb Crackers – Low Lectin, Medium Oxalate & Low FODMAP\n\nMast Cell Activation Syndrome Diet Dinner:\n\nEasy Chicken Tacos – Low FODMAP, Low Lectin, Low Oxalate, Low Salicylate\n\nSpring Roll Stir Fry – Low Salicylate, Low FODMAP, Low Lectin, Low Oxalate\n\nRosemary Roasted Garlic Pork Chops – Low Oxalate, Low Lectin\n\nLow Histamine Bacon with Southern Greens –Low Oxalate, Low Lectin\n\nRoasted Cauliflower with Cherries and Pecans – Low Lectin, Lower Oxalate, Low Salicylate Option\n\nInstant Pot Chicken & Pork Roast – Low Oxalate, Low Lectin\n\nMast Cell Activation Syndrome Diet Dessert:\n\nCarrot Cake – Low Lectin & Low to Medium Oxalate\n\nMango Ice Cream – Low Lectin & Low Oxalate\n\nWhite Chocolate Cookie Dough – Low Lectin and Medium Oxalate\n\nMacadamia Nut Butter – Low FODMAP, Low Lectin & Low Oxalate\n\n6 Layer Cranberry Trifle – Low Lectin & Low Oxalate\n\nPecan Clusters – Low Lectin & Medium Oxalate\n\nGinger Cardamom Breakfast Rolls – Low Lectin, Moderate Oxalate, & Moderate FODMAP\n\nApple Pie – Low Lectin, with Medium Oxalate & Low Salicylate Options\n\nSee all my low histamine recipes here.\n\nCan Antihistamines Replace the Mast Cell Activation Syndrome Diet?\n\nA common misconception with Mast Cell Activation Syndrome is that you can just take histamine blockers to get rid of histamine in the body.\n\nThis is a myth.\n\nRelated Article: Mast Cell Myths\n\nThere are some supplements that can help lower histamine levels. But reducing the amount of dietary histamine you eat is going to be your best way to lower histamine.\n\nLong Term MCAS Diet\n\nEating low histamine may not be forever for most people with MCAS. Your needs may shift over time as you heal. (The rare exception to this is a rare genetic disorder called Mastocytosis.)\n\nI can now tolerate a lot more histamine and oxalates than I used to.\n\nI still have trouble with most lectins. But I’ve found I have been able to reintroduce rice and pressure-cooked winter squashes, like kabocha squash.\n\nFODMAPs are still a work in progress for me.\n\nI can go out to eat occasionally. But when I do, I make sure to take my DAO enzyme supplement beforehand.\n\nHere are some more posts on how to do this MCAS Diet (aka low histamine diet):\n\nThe Low Histamine Diet Plan\n\nIdentifying High Histamine Foods\n\nHow to Low Histamine Meal Plan\n\nLow Histamine Foods List\n\nHealing foods are a big foundation for those recovering from MCAS.
