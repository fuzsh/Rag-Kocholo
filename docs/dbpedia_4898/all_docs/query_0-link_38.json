There she obtained her BFA in Professional Theatre. She has been in love with all forms of storytelling since she fell in love with reading in elementary school. The many movie nights with her grandparents fostered her love of movies. Her fun fact is that her mother would not let her watch Disney Channel or Nickelodeon during the school week. Instead, she’d come home from school, catching reruns of 90s sitcoms. That's where her love of television comes from. All these factors made her the creative that she is. During college she started her indie production company. Out of pure passion and the desire to see the visions God placed in her outside of her mind, she wrote and produced a 5-episode web-series entitled \"Together\", one pilot episode of her original TV show \"New Life'', and a few short films. Ciara is so excited to start her journey in LA with the YADA family!\n\nCody Collier\n\nDirector\n\nCody is a performer and director who originated the title role of Scooby in Warner Bros. “Scooby-Doo LIVE” North American, Middle Eastern, and Australian national tours.
