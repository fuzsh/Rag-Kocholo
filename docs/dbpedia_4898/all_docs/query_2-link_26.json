Welcome to Radio Cherry Bombe, the number one female-focused food podcast in the universe. I'm your host, Kerry Diamond.\n\nKerry Diamond: I am so excited about today's show. Our guest is Christine Tobin. Christine is a food stylist and consultant who has worked on 16 film sets, most recently Greta Gerwig's highly anticipated adaptation of the beloved novel Little Women by Louisa May Alcott. In addition to her work on TV and film, Christine works as the key food stylist at Christopher Kimball's Milk Street.\n\nKerry Diamond: Some housekeeping first, tickets are on sale right now for the Cherry Bombe Jubilee Conference, the biggest gathering of women in the food world in the US. That's true. It's taking place Sunday April 5th at the Brooklyn Expo. Visit Cherry Bombe dot com to snag your ticket and for more information.\n\nKerry Diamond: Also, the new issue of Cherry Bombe is out right now. It's our first ever fashion issue and it's filled with lots of great stories, photography, and recipes. You can get a copy on Cherry Bombe dot com or from your favorite bookstore or magazine shop like Casa Magazines in New York's West Village and Coutelier in New Orleans and Nashville.\n\nKerry Diamond: Not only is this your Radio Cherry Bombe debut but it's your first podcast, right?\n\nChristine Tobin: Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yes.\n\nKerry Diamond: Oh my God. I kind of cannot believe that. We're honored.\n\nChristine Tobin: Oh, well, thank you for having me.\n\nKerry Diamond: How did you wind up working on this film?\n\nChristine Tobin: I got a call from Dave Gulick, who is the prop master and someone I've worked ... I think this is my fourth film with him. He said, \"What are you doing starting in September?\" I said, \"What do you have going on that you need me?\" I immediately signed on and jumped onboard.\n\nKerry Diamond: I mean, you must be so excited when you got that phone call.\n\nChristine Tobin: I was very excited. I knew it was coming to town but I'm not needed on all films that come to the Boston area so you just never know if there's someone else that they're thinking about or they even need food but clearly with Little Women I knew there might be a phone call coming my way. I was sort of bouncing.\n\nKerry Diamond: What was your relationship like to Little Women? I mean, had you grown up ... When you were younger had you read the book?\n\nChristine Tobin: I read the book. Being from Massachusetts we would go to the Alcott House for field trips. Probably starting when I was eight years old, nine years old. Coincidentally, just a few months before I was up with a friend of mine and just to go on a hike and revisit that area and saying, \"I should really spend more time in this area. It's just such a nice place\" and then here I was then embarking on a piece that I'd be spending a lot more time there. It's a beautiful part of Massachusetts.\n\nKerry Diamond: The story is set in Concord, Massachusetts in the mid-1800s. The Alcott House is still in Concord?\n\nChristine Tobin: Yes.\n\nKerry Diamond: That's amazing.\n\nChristine Tobin: Everyone if they can visit it, should. Especially being a fan of the book or a new fan because of the film, it's just a magical place to visit.\n\nKerry Diamond: You get called for this project.\n\nChristine Tobin: Yes.\n\nKerry Diamond: How do you even begin figuring out the food and the food styling for a project like this that's set 200 years ago?\n\nChristine Tobin: I went back to Concord on a whim for another hike and thought, \"Why don't I just parachute into the Alcott House, maybe see if I can get a tour ...\" I had made visits to that area. I know that the Alcott House is there but wouldn't necessarily pop in there each time I would go visit.\n\nChristine Tobin: In this case, I went for that specific meeting. I happened to then find myself with Jan Turnquist, who is the executive director of the Alcott House, and she was so generous with me. I am forever indebted to her. She spent four hours with me. I had the whole house to myself with her. We sat and we talked and talked. I took scrap papers. Asked for a pen.\n\nChristine Tobin: It was a gift really because it's from my meeting with her from the very beginning after that first phone call helped me focus on what I needed to do to bring not just Little Women to life but bring the Alcotts and their family foods and what they would prepare and what they grew and their surroundings and their community to life. I'm completely indebted to her.\n\nKerry Diamond: I haven't read the book in decades but are there a lot of sort of lush descriptions about food in the book?\n\nChristine Tobin: We have the limes. The limes were a big part. You have the Christmas scenes. You have cookies and cakes but not in a written ... Like MFK Fisher description of the succulence of anything. Just knowing that you are a family and there's food on the table, there's breads being kneaded, it's not just the food for the scene itself but also for background, for staging.\n\nKerry Diamond: How much time did you have to prepare in terms of research?\n\nChristine Tobin: Maybe a month?\n\nKerry Diamond: Oh, that's it? Wow.\n\nChristine Tobin: Yeah. It happens really quickly and you get quickly absorbed into ... You're hired to be just that when you work ... In my experience in film, you're hired to be obsessed with nothing else except what you got hired to do.\n\nKerry Diamond: Wow. You technically are part of the prop team, right?\n\nChristine Tobin: Technically, yup.\n\nKerry Diamond: Okay. We learned that from Sofia Coppola few weeks ago. She was on the podcast.\n\nChristine Tobin: Anything that an actor picks up.\n\nKerry Diamond: What are the production meetings like? What is your interaction with the production team like?\n\nChristine Tobin: You're sort of your own deserted island a bit. In this case, again, having my relationship and comfort zone with the prop master Dave Gulick, he brought me into meetings, he made sure that I was included in production meetings that involved the food scenes.\n\nChristine Tobin: My first meeting very quickly was to meet Greta and her assistant director and the prop team and I came with the start of what would be my bible and various cookbooks to show visuals. I baked an array of scones to see which ones she preferred.\n\nKerry Diamond: You must have been very popular in the production meetings.\n\nChristine Tobin: Everyone gains five pounds when I'm on set. It's true. All the food is edible, it's real.\n\nKerry Diamond: Right. I was going to say, one of my favorite things that I read about you was that you don't make fake food for film sets.\n\nChristine Tobin: I don't. Even what would be considered fake food ... Sometimes, which I didn't like at first when I started this, I'm like, \"No, you don't tell people you sprayed things with hairspray.\" Then I learned after the labor intensiveness that goes into making this food that they're going to eat it and they're going to ask for seconds and thirds and that's there ...\n\nChristine Tobin: Now, say for a large restaurant scene where there's burgers, say a Friday's or something, I'll take pumpernickel bread and make circles and put it in-between other breads. It's real food but there's no meat in it or anything that would go bad or smell up the set and the extras sitting there pretending, doing their job.\n\nKerry Diamond: I would think that's so much more expensive for the film, it's so much more work on your part to make it edible-\n\nChristine Tobin: Sometimes I don't have the equipment to even prepare on site. My work that I do is typically out of my own space and so everything is prepped, everything is put in Cambros, and packaged and then I arrive on set, as a caterer would, and sort of shift into action. Again, not knowing if when I land there's a refrigerator or a stovetop. I mean, running water. I've been put in very dodgy situations in the past.\n\nKerry Diamond: I understand why they would gravitate toward fake food because it has to withstand the lights and time and people touching it over and over again. You still manage to make real food that withstands all that.\n\nChristine Tobin: I've gotten away with it. For me, and especially depending on the scene at hand, so if there's a feast and people are surrounding the table and they are being asked to eat, it's not that they're doing it because they're asked. They're doing it because they really want it and enjoy it.\n\nChristine Tobin: You know, it makes for beautiful moments to be captured. I can't see myself putting a product that couldn't be enjoyed. That would make me really sad and make everyone else sad. \"I can't eat it? I can't touch it?\"\n\nKerry Diamond: When they're eating your food they're not acting, they're actually enjoying what's in front of them.\n\nChristine Tobin: No. They're really eating. There's only one time on Labor Day because there was just so many takes on a biscuit scene that eventually you can't eat that many and they'll introduce the spit bucket. It's a very rare occurrence.\n\nKerry Diamond: Oh, I didn't know a spit bucket was a thing on set.\n\nChristine Tobin: I think that's just happened once for me.\n\nKerry Diamond: It's like a wine tasting. You mention a feast. The most beautiful food scene in the movie is when Mr. Lawrence sends over the Christmas feast for the girls. You must have had such a great time.\n\nChristine Tobin: I did.\n\nKerry Diamond: Working on that scene. For those who haven't seen the movie yet can you sort of set the scene for us?\n\nChristine Tobin: Well, what was in the book and what was scripted and even reading the script it is in capital letters, \"Ice cream is pink.\" Thinking, \"Okay, what's pink ice cream? Is it cherry ice cream? Is it strawberry ice cream?\" No, it's peppermint ice cream.\n\nChristine Tobin: That was sourced by a local ice cream maker in Roslindale, Mass. They've been in business for over 100 years. If I could have made the ice cream myself I would have because of the importance of that for that scene.\n\nKerry Diamond: It was a huge beautiful bowl of pink ice cream scoops.\n\nChristine Tobin: It was a huge beautiful bowl, a punch bowl, and the funny thing is is on set ... We're working together with set dressers and people bringing me the platters, me selecting platters, and you're just sort of ... As if you're about to have this huge dinner party at your house, you're just sort of making magic happen, and it was the prop master Dave who ... I was like, \"Where are we going to put this ice cream?\" He was like, \"Eh ...\" He just shows up with this beautiful sterling silver bowl. I would love to take credit for that prop but it was all him.\n\nChristine Tobin: We filled it and we babysat the ice cream. It was real ice cream. Fake ice cream could have been used but to have the result that it did, having the girls ... I mean, they were immediately excited. They didn't know what they were walking into themselves. I think it brought a real life exciting moment for young women to walk into and say, \"Wait, what is this?\" They were just licking their fingers.\n\nKerry Diamond: Peppermint ice cream was a thing back then?\n\nChristine Tobin: Peppermint ice cream was a thing back then.\n\nKerry Diamond: I love that.\n\nChristine Tobin: Luckily, my Puritan ice cream company was still making it and it's still popular and usually it's a seasonal item so to have them make it for me off-season was something I appreciated.\n\nChristine Tobin: As far as the cakes, looking at the table scape, to scale and just sort of playing with various textures and colors and heights comes into play with that. We just came with a lot of different things-\n\nKerry Diamond: Yeah. Tell us what else was on that table.\n\nChristine Tobin: A Victoria sponge with fresh cream and strawberries that would have been preserved because we did a lot of that prior to the filming. We had a plethora of things that we could use for each of the food scenes that would be very realistic to what they would have done. There were fresh artichokes. Things that would be exotic for the March family being brought from the Lawrence house.\n\nKerry Diamond: Because Mr. Lawrence was the rich guy across the street.\n\nChristine Tobin: Just exotic candies, Turkish delights, little marshmallow-y treats covered in chocolate. Not so much cookies but it was more a cake-based spread. A beautiful ham that had the little cloves ... You know, a carving ham. Creamed spinach was on there. I mean, then all around ... I mean, there's just food everywhere. I'm very happy with that scene.\n\nKerry Diamond: How big was your crew?\n\nChristine Tobin: Three of us.\n\nKerry Diamond: You did everything in your kitchen?\n\nChristine Tobin: Or I said do it ... If you have to stay up all night in your space that's totally cool, but typically I work alone and so talking to ... Right upfront I said, \"This is going to be impossible\" and so I had actually one of my closest family friends, I've known her since she was nine, Caroline White, who is a chef in Boston. She was my on-set.\n\nChristine Tobin: Then poaching Brianna Berelli from Clear Flour Bakery, who is a master pastry chef, so she was sort of behind the scenes and constantly rotating out the scones that ... All the things that I designed that would just be on rotation for the March family to have on hand, for example, tons of pie doughs, discs in my freezer. There was never a moment where we had to scurry or scatter. It's quite seamless and it's because of them really. I owe a lot to them.\n\nKerry Diamond: How much do you interact with the cast?\n\nChristine Tobin: I want to say everyone likes me around a bit.\n\nKerry Diamond: That's okay. You can say everyone likes you.\n\nChristine Tobin: You're stationed there and they're just the loveliest group of kind people that were curious and I called them my naughty nibblers and they would come. I would sometimes, at the end especially, send them home with little box of treats. Most especially for the director. I just loved handing over to her assistant like, \"Just take this cake.\"\n\nChristine Tobin: I don't know. I just liked that element of sharing. I know it's for the production costs ... It's not purposely done but at the end of each day if you have a plethora of cookies that we slaved over I'm not going to throw it away. They're going to find a home.\n\nKerry Diamond: I love that it's real food too because everyone is trying to find ways to cut food waste and there's so much food waste on photo shoots and film sets. That's really wonderful that you're fighting that.\n\nChristine Tobin: One of my assistants actually started bringing a compost bag. She did it in the most heightened feast. I was like, \"What are you doing? My head is about to explode. I'm totally in the weeds. I can't think about where these eggshells are going right now.\" She did it for me and so in the future working ... You know, for future projects I think it's a wise place to start with new habits.\n\nKerry Diamond: Did you watch the film?\n\nChristine Tobin: I've seen it three times.\n\nKerry Diamond: You have? You're not like Adam Driver. You can't go watch your work.\n\nChristine Tobin: No.\n\nKerry Diamond: I'm joking. I love Adam Driver.\n\nChristine Tobin: I saw Marriage Story. Heart wrenching. I went to watch that a second time and I was like, \"I can't. I'm not ready yet.\"\n\nKerry Diamond: That scene where he breaks into song?\n\nChristine Tobin: All of it. The film ... All of it is brilliant. I'm a huge fan. I went the first time for the crew screening and then I went Christmas day at the Coolidge Corner Theater in Brookline. That was ... The energy in the room, the charge of it, and I've never been to the movies on Christmas before. I don't know if that was part of it.\n\nKerry Diamond: Oh, my family goes every Christmas.\n\nChristine Tobin: It's a game changer. Then a third time with my daughter and my mom so over Christmas break, which was really special.\n\nKerry Diamond: That's so special. How old is your daughter?\n\nChristine Tobin: She's nine.\n\nKerry Diamond: Oh my gosh. The perfect age.\n\nChristine Tobin: We've been reading Little Women. Every few nights ... We're almost done. It's a slow read for her. She says, \"There's just so many words. I can't ...\" We just take turns and her seeing the film and her little part at the end with Marmee's birthday cake she wasn't expecting that. I kept that from her as a little surprise. It was a touching moment for us.\n\nKerry Diamond: It's so amazing. I mean, congratulations. The film really is so beautiful. It's just so beautiful to watch. The costumes and just everything about it.\n\nChristine Tobin: Everyone on it took such great care of what their jobs were and I think also because it's such a huge endeavor for this director and the producers to take on this project so I know, for me, I just felt a great responsibility to her to know that I had her back in my little cocoon of my craft, that I think most people took on that same attitude. There was a really just wonderful feeling of care and thoughtfulness I think with everybody that was involved. It's just taking care of New England and the cinematography and the photography.\n\nKerry Diamond: Well, it 100% comes out in the film.\n\nChristine Tobin: Yeah.\n\nKerry Diamond: Did you cry when you watched it?\n\nChristine Tobin: I just had a huge smile on my face. I was touched by the Marmee cake scene because it was scripted to be this cake that was made by the children with Jo and Jo was to bring it to Marmee. In the script it doesn't say it's ... We're going to play this cake all day long so I just thought it was a couple of hours that I would need to be on set but, in fact, it was a full day into the very early evening light that this cake was played. I knew standing there this was to be a special part but I wasn't expecting how it showed in the final product. I was really touched.\n\nKerry Diamond: Since you did so much research what goes into a mid-1800s cake versus a modern cake?\n\nChristine Tobin: Well, for our purposes we use modern recipes but mimicking old recipes where their recipes would be more dense and egg-y ... They had leaveners so that was sort of saving our butts all across that we were able to use those agents.\n\nChristine Tobin: It really is not that much of a difference. I mean, I had a Victoria sponge on New Year's Eve. That's my go-to cake for my own personal entertaining. You know, having spent time with Jan Turnquist and my meeting with her and her sharing of what the Alcotts loved to eat or prepare themselves was really the point where the granulated sugar came in. You'll see strawberries, which were a huge Alcott family favorite and the pears.\n\nKerry Diamond: There was some jam making. I remember that from the film.\n\nChristine Tobin: There was jam making. Laura Dern took a jam making workshop the day before and that was the first day on set that I met her. She came right up. She's like, \"I took a jam making workshop yesterday.\"\n\nKerry Diamond: I'm impressed.\n\nChristine Tobin: \"What do I need to do?\"\n\nKerry Diamond: I'm impressed. That's how you win a Golden Globe. Oh, she won it for Marriage Story. But still-\n\nChristine Tobin: That day was a hot day. There was jam everywhere. There was a cranberry jam and a raspberry jam because they weren't sure what season it was to be played. Another circumstance, you're outside, there's no running water, there's yellow jackets everywhere. We all survived. No one got stung.\n\nKerry Diamond: I'm happy to hear that.\n\nChristine Tobin: Everyone wanted to go home with a little container of jam.\n\nKerry Diamond: How did you break into food styling for films?\n\nChristine Tobin: Well, for films I first started food styling for print with Ana Sortun of Oleana and Cambridge. I was with her for six and a half years working front of the house and, like many people in restaurants do, they have another passion or another profession besides waiting on tables. In my case, I was an artist and just I was like, \"I think I want to get into food styling\" having watched Ana and studying her on the other side of the counter while she plated foods and just sort of ... She really made me just awaken to this wonderful ability to look at food as art and sharing it and people being wowed.\n\nChristine Tobin: She was at actually my father's wake with a group of people from Oleana, which I was very touched by, and it was my friend who I would be ... My confidant, who I'd be like, \"I really want to get into food styling\" who shared with her, \"Hey, Christine wants to be a food stylist\" after Ana said, \"I need to hire a food stylist.\"\n\nChristine Tobin: Her first cookbook Spice was my first project. Then from there I came to New York with those connections that I made with her photographer Susan Kushner, assisted for a number of years, had babies, took time off, was sitting at a park with my two kids going, \"What am I doing with my life? I totally am not ... The phone is not ringing.\"\n\nChristine Tobin: Literally the phone rang. It was Chris Ubick from Los Angeles based on a referral from my mentor, John Carafoli, who is the godfather of food styling. I was brought into that meeting with producers. They're like, \"There's no sign of you on Google. Who are you?\" I'm like, \"I'm someone who has this experience but I'm also a home cook, I'm a mom, and this movie needs those sort of hands potentially\" and they hired me.\n\nKerry Diamond: Which film was that?\n\nChristine Tobin: That was for Labor Day directed by Jason Reitman. It was Susan Spungen who was hired as the culinary consultant and director and food stylist that I had the amazing opportunity to work with and for. I mean, you can't get bigger than Susan.\n\nKerry Diamond: We love Susan.\n\nChristine Tobin: She taught me everything I needed to know. I'm still learning things on set but just on set etiquette, how to play with the walkie talkie, timing, \"Do you really need 100 pies?\" \"Yes, Christine, we need 100 pies.\" That experience was incredible.\n\nChristine Tobin: Then immediately came American Hustle and then immediately came Olive Kitteridge with Frances McDormand. I've just been doing this work since. If the phone rings I, of course, say yes because I love the pace of it. It's gritty. It's not glamorous. It's working on a circus. I really enjoy it.\n\nKerry Diamond: Like all good members of the bomb squad, it's not your only job.\n\nChristine Tobin: It's not my only job.\n\nKerry Diamond: Tell us what else you do.\n\nChristine Tobin: I am key food stylist at Chris Kimball's Milk Street.\n\nKerry Diamond: Which is based in Boston.\n\nChristine Tobin: Based in Boston. I work on their magazines, their cookbooks. We just won the James Beard cookbook last year for best general cooking. That was super exciting, and their television production. Their beauty pieces. When I'm not there I pick up the phone and work with other photographers on various projects, commercials, editorial.\n\nKerry Diamond: How did you hook up with Chris?\n\nChristine Tobin: Based on a referral.\n\nKerry Diamond: People must really like you. You get lots of referrals.\n\nChristine Tobin: I think that's just how all this works. Frankly, I have terrible social media presence. I'm terrible at it.\n\nKerry Diamond: You know what? I think that's good for people to hear because today I feel like we live in such an Instagram world that if you don't have a certain number of followers and a beautiful Instagram ...\n\nChristine Tobin: People really beat themselves up or especially people getting into or wanting to launch into, say, this profession in particular to obsessively take pictures of what you're cooking and it's great but ...\n\nKerry Diamond: It doesn't come naturally to everyone.\n\nChristine Tobin: It definitely does not to me or my hands are always dirty and I can't or I'm like, \"No one needs another person to say, 'Look at this beautiful cucumber.\"\n\nKerry Diamond: You got referred to Chris. A lot of cool women there.\n\nChristine Tobin: Very cool.\n\nKerry Diamond: I visited a few times. I always love all the people I meet there.\n\nChristine Tobin: It's mostly a women staff. They're all bad ass chefs and they come in with every week they do ... I think it's Thursdays. They source the most funkiest flavor potato chips. Everyone is just each other's cheerleader a bit. I like being in those environments.\n\nKerry Diamond: Do you cook at home much or are you so burned out on food?\n\nChristine Tobin: I'm kind of burned out on food.\n\nKerry Diamond: You're like, \"Can I just have some yogurt?\"\n\nChristine Tobin: I do cook a lot. I do miss cooking the way I used to cook when the phone wasn't ringing. I hate to say it like that but I was self-teaching, especially when I was working at Oleana, and taking notes and asking lots of questions and then coming home and trying to replicate. I miss those days a bit but now I'm just ... I'm a single parent. I have two young children. We always eat dinner together. That's the most important thing. It's always just very simple cooking. You know, there's always a roast something and a fluff of salad and call it a day, take showers, go to bed, repeat.\n\nKerry Diamond: Rinse, repeat.\n\nChristine Tobin: I like a nice challenge every once in a while.\n\nKerry Diamond: Yeah. Are you in Cambridge?\n\nChristine Tobin: I'm in Roslindale, which is part of Boston proper. Yeah. It's funny because going back to the social media presence and referrals and such I think in a lot of regard it's about your skillset but also how you are to work with and what you bring in your personality and if you're flexible, if you're not going to lose it because X drops out of the universe and you sort of are creative in making executive decisions on the fly without being a jerk about it I think it's come pretty handy for me.\n\nKerry Diamond: What was your first job in food?\n\nChristine Tobin: Waiting tables.\n\nKerry Diamond: Where?\n\nChristine Tobin: Oh, boy. The Village Restaurant in Brewster, Massachusetts when I was a teenager.\n\nKerry Diamond: Were you a good waitress?\n\nChristine Tobin: No, I was a terrible waitress. I would spill trays with pancakes and syrup. That's so funny. I'm having a flashback. Yeah. Then an ice cream stand at the pool. You know? Stuff like that. Those were my first. I grew up in a suburb of Boston and my mom is from New York City as my dad was and New Yorkers do food like no one else does food, especially coming from a Sicilian family as my mom did and my nana lived with us off the boat from Sicily my whole life until she passed when I was a teenager. Food was always just the most important element of our existence.\n\nChristine Tobin: On Pine Crest Road, each month my parents and some other friends, I think there was six couples-\n\nKerry Diamond: That's where you grew up?\n\nChristine Tobin: At Pine Crest Road. They created this group called the Gourmet Club and every month they got together ... This was in the '70s and the early '80s and they picked a country and the ladies got together and they created a menu and then it was rotating in the houses.\n\nChristine Tobin: The children we got to then not only just be part of it, we were hidden at adult time with our own snacks and goodies, but sit at the stairs and listening to all the adult chitter chatter and then eating the leftovers the next day and enjoying them as much as if we were there.\n\nKerry Diamond: Do you think that somehow planted a seed?\n\nChristine Tobin: Oh, it absolutely ... I owe a great deal to my mom, who is like the Martha Stewart of Pine Crest Road. She really is.\n\nKerry Diamond: Every time you say Pine Crest I feel like you're saying pie crust.\n\nChristine Tobin: Oh, no. Pine Crest.\n\nKerry Diamond: Rename the street Pie Crust.\n\nChristine Tobin: In fact, she handed me ... One of the last times I was home she handed me a huge box of all the binders with that thin tissue-like typing paper and all the menus, all the recipes of the Gourmet Club. I've yet to have a second to look into this box but it's going to be a treasure chest.\n\nKerry Diamond: Absolutely.\n\nChristine Tobin: I hope to do something with it.\n\nKerry Diamond: I know you said you don't love Instagram but I would love to see you Instagram.\n\nChristine Tobin: Well, that's a project that would probably get me fired up to get on Instagram.\n\nKerry Diamond: Oh, you're not on Instagram?\n\nChristine Tobin: No, I am on Instagram but just to be more present. I did snap a picture on my Instagram of Ted Allen today because I accidentally was following him.\n\nKerry Diamond: Did you say hi?\n\nChristine Tobin: I sure did.\n\nKerry Diamond: Yeah. Good. He's a nice guy.\n\nChristine Tobin: So lovely. So nice.\n\nKerry Diamond: You've really had just such a remarkable existence in this industry. It seems very special.\n\nChristine Tobin: I'm very lucky.\n\nKerry Diamond: Absolutely. What's next for you?\n\nChristine Tobin: Well ...\n\nKerry Diamond: Are you allowed to say?\n\nChristine Tobin: I'm not allowed to say but ...\n\nKerry Diamond: Just whisper. Nobody will hear.\n\nChristine Tobin: I got a text ... It's a go-ahead for me to be part of an HBO pilot series coming up.\n\nKerry Diamond: Oh, how exciting. Are they filming it in the Boston area?\n\nChristine Tobin: Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n\nKerry Diamond: Great. Are you the go-to gal when there's something filmed over there?\n\nChristine Tobin: I'm the only person in the local union 481. That's something ... While on set with Olive Kitteridge ... I mean, that's what's interesting too about this. The industry because ... Especially as a specialty craft ...\n\nChristine Tobin: For example, at Olive Kitteridge I was asked not to get on stage and do the job that I was hired to do because I wasn't union. There's all these rules and regulations that get into it, which was really cumbersome to me doing my job. I was, luckily, forced through.\n\nKerry Diamond: I mean, you can explain this more but it's not just a matter of joining the union. You have to do ...\n\nChristine Tobin: You have sponsorship.\n\nKerry Diamond: And you have to do a certain amount of work and a certain amount of hours first. It's pretty complicated.\n\nChristine Tobin: It's very complicated. There's a lot of people who dedicate their hours and jobs that they might not even want to be doing to get to.\n\nKerry Diamond: To qualify?\n\nChristine Tobin: Yeah. To qualify to then get to that next ... Once you're union and you've started out as a PA, for example, but your ambition is to be a screenwriter you're just sort of plopping on little opportunities when they come. It's a lot of work and I think it takes a lot of ambition.\n\nKerry Diamond: Before we get to our speed round, what advice do you have for anyone listening who is really interested in food styling?\n\nChristine Tobin: I would say if the phone rings and you don't think that you can pull it off just say yes to it because you're always going to be asked to learn and asked to dive into someone else's life. You know, to help create a storytelling or a character development ...\n\nChristine Tobin: It's not as simple as just preparing food and bringing it to a stage for camera. It's very much more involved with it. I think having various life experiences, both devastating and happy, sort of all helps you evolve your work to be as real as possible.\n\nKerry Diamond: You can't really go to school to be a food stylist.\n\nChristine Tobin: School of hard knocks.\n\nKerry Diamond: There you go, folks.\n\nChristine Tobin: No. I know that there's some that will do workshops but, no, there isn't. There's conferences around our country that have people but I don't know ...\n\nKerry Diamond: In terms of honing your eye is it museums? Looking at photography?\n\nChristine Tobin: Well, my background is in fine arts so my degrees ... I never went to culinary school. I went to art school. I have a thousand bazillion dollars in student loans because of my art school experience. I go in looking at things sculpturally ... Meaning, my hands on approach to food but everyone is different. I think that's the thing with the food styling niche. Everyone has a niche. Some people are really into precision and microscopic whereas I just use my hands and the less I touch food, the more alive I think it is. That might not jive with people but what I look at is it's creating it sculpturally but using various textures and balance as you would a painting and colors and shapes. I think that's how my eye works.\n\nKerry Diamond: That's so beautiful, Christine. All right. Speed round.\n\nChristine Tobin: Oh, boy. Yes.\n\nKerry Diamond: Most treasured cookbook?\n\nChristine Tobin: I will have to say it's Julia Child's The Way To Cook and I say this because it's my go-to ...\n\nKerry Diamond: Because she's from Boston?\n\nChristine Tobin: She was from Boston, Cambridge. Just go-to, straight forward, foolproof recipes. Her Boeuf Bourguignon, AKA beef stew, I use ... You'd be amazed at how many times I have to make beef stew for movies. Everyone is being fed a beef stew and it's Julia Child's recipe.\n\nChristine Tobin: I want to followup with Food 52 Genius cookbook. That saved my butt quite a number of times for some really foolproof baking.\n\nKerry Diamond: They're really genius?\n\nChristine Tobin: I think so.\n\nKerry Diamond: Good to know. Good to know. We love our pals over at Food 52. Okay. Favorite kitchen utensil or piece of equipment?\n\nChristine Tobin: I have this massive Brazilian cast-iron pot that is something I have used ... This is the only thing I use. It's like I can fry in it, I can braise in it, boil in it. It's the only thing I use.\n\nKerry Diamond: Song that makes you smile?\n\nChristine Tobin: Sara by Stevie Nicks.\n\nKerry Diamond: Dream vacation destination?\n\nChristine Tobin: I never leave Boston. I'm really excited to be here. I turned 48 this year. Just a few weeks ago. I said, \"When I turn 50 I'm going to Italy.\" Like that's ... If I could be Susan Spungen, right? And someone calls me and says, \"We need actor X to be slurping spaghetti\" like Eat, Pray, Love I would ... Take me anywhere.\n\nKerry Diamond: All right. If anyone is listening and they can make that happen.\n\nChristine Tobin: Yeah, make it happen.\n\nKerry Diamond: Oldest thing in your fridge?\n\nChristine Tobin: Pickles.\n\nKerry Diamond: One food you would never eat?\n\nChristine Tobin: I'm not a fan of eel.\n\nKerry Diamond: If you had to be trapped on a desert island with one food celeb who would it be and why?\n\nChristine Tobin: Julia Turshen.\n\nKerry Diamond: We love Julia.\n\nChristine Tobin: If I was to meet her I would faint because I'm a huge fan and I was introduced to her through her working on Gwyneth Paltrow's cookbook, which I think those are awesome recipes. Knowing that she was a big contributor to it, I was like, \"Who is this wacky lady?\" I've been following her and her cookbooks are wonderful but, most importantly, what she's doing in her community is just what we all ... I do my small part in my community but what she's doing is something that's very inspiring to me.\n\nKerry Diamond: I think what you're talking about is the volunteering that she and her partner Grace do for the food pantry and food kitchen up in their community in upstate New York, which is really amazing.\n\nChristine Tobin: We all started ... I remember going with my dad to Rosie's Place on the Pine Street Inn in Boston and volunteering when we were old enough and I plan to do that with my children but more that.\n\nKerry Diamond: I'm so sad this show is over. I've had such a nice time talking to you.\n\nChristine Tobin: You're both very nice. Thank you very, very much.\n\nKerry Diamond: Thank you. Thank you. We try, right, Jess? All right.
