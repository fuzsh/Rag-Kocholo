Now it's just outside Mt Pleasant and easy to get to. We go there and sometimes just eat the sides. Get their fried flounder. It's the best this side of the Cooper.\n\nReview by - Yelp\n\nDavid F:\n\nGreat rustic dining near Mount Pleasant, SC. Seafood selection was very good. We started with the fried clams, and then my wife had the grouper fingers while I had the broiled flounder. Food and sides were fantastic, and service was very good. We would dine here again.\n\nReview by - Yelp\n\nJeff H:\n\nThe fresh and local seafood here is always amazingly delicious! The service is top notch and friendly every time.
