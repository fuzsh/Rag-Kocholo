        "text": "One of the best restaurants in Buenos Aires is in a restored house in Villa Crespo, where twenty-something Tom√°s Treschanski leaves you speechless with his Michelin-starred conceptual cuisine. The youngest chef in America awarded by the famous guide also won his Young Chef Award. Plenty of imagination and all techniques come together in the tasting menu, which is accompanied by four styles of pairing, with Argentine wines, world labels, and mocktails. Just when we thought fine dining was dying in Buenos Aires, the revelation chef revived it with a disruptive proposal. A revolution in 14 bites. From beet and tangerine macaron with spicy peanut praline and foamy kimchi and saffron beignet to lemon fish cured in kombu; turnip tarte tatin with English cheddar ice cream; and the petit fours kiosk. With black garlic and licorice fudge; cocoa, caramelized and mushroom praline bonbon. There are no limits, neither between sweet and salty, nor in creation. \"The product always has something new to say,\" asserts Tom√°s.\n\nWhere: Murillo 725.\n\nWe don't care if it didn't make it into the Michelin guide because it's on the outskirts of Buenos Aires. Those from the Northern Zone are grateful that there is such a high proposal out there. Those who come from the capital will be rewarded with the wonders of Alejandro Feraud and his brigade, who we already know: they are a breeding ground for geniuses. Organic, wild, and seasonal, that's how their haute cuisine is, in a cozy place, with a fascinating wine cellar. As for the setting, there's a lot of woodwork, with petirib√≠ tables, deck, and grill: the perfect setting for their proposal, which however worked and well thought out, remains comfort food. As you taste it, it unfolds in layers of flavor and embraces you. If you sit at the high chef counter, you will see all the complexity involved in each dish and the mega equipment to carry them out. For starters, quail, sweet potato, and purple leaves; gnocchi, brain, spinach, parmesan; buffalo, cashew, purslane. For the main course, cappellacci, corn, miso, and cocoa; duck, grilled okra, banana. If you're a fan of desserts, don't leave without trying the bonbon experience: sweet cuisine is part of Alo's identity. For its Honest Haute Cuisine, Latin America's 50 Best Restaurants awarded it 38th place.\n\nTip: this year they are celebrating their 10th anniversary and they are constantly organizing special events with invited international chefs (you can follow them on IG to find out). You can also opt for the 10-year root tasting menu. King crab, turnip, almonds; lamb, prawns, plums; fish, beetroot, figs, and many more steps.\n\nWhere: Av. Blanco Encalada 2120, Boulogne, San Isidro.\n\nYes, the era has come when the restaurant of a super hotel like the Palacio Duhau Park Hyatt goes vegan. In the most exclusive area of Recoleta, from a contemporary salon and an exceptional terrace, chef Juan Simonte shares the joy of cooking with plants. Explore fermented vegetables, pickles, and plant-based cheeses. Fruits, legumes, cereals, seaweed, and the fungi kingdom, which is the food of the future. Everything arrives selected and from the green hands of small producers. Gioia is committed to sustainability, something that is seen in every detail, even in the breadbasket made of reclaimed wood. Its dishes seem like a jungle, and like nature itself, the landscape changes with the season. Beetroot mille-feuille, peanut puree, fried capers, onion paper, and radish pickles; Lima causa with mushrooms; pickled mushrooms with fermented pistachio sauce and plum barbecue; charred avocado with leek ash, kimchi emulsion, and pop quinoa; Kale pakoras with roasted bell pepper and yellow curry sauce; tagliatelle with wasabi crumble. An artwork and consciousness that received a mention from the Michelin Guide. Of course, with such botanical mastery, their mocktails are the best.\n\nTip: join Botanical Tuesdays: tapas and gin cocktails, all free, every Tuesday, all year round, from 7 pm.\n\nWhere: Posadas 1350.\n\nThey have won plenty of awards for the best Neapolitan pizza in Argentina, South America, and the world. They live making pizzas, and that's what they love. The Santoro sisters are the geniuses behind this project born in the southern area of Gran Buenos Aires. From Adrogu√© to everywhere. \"We started in our mom's backyard, as a hobby. We began inviting friends, who invited friends and things exploded,\" they recount without really understanding how they achieved this success. They chose to make Neapolitan pizza because it was impossible to find in their neighborhood, so they made it themselves. Not in a mold, nor on a stone. Neapolitan: a contemporary, soft, airy, and light style. The place Carola and Victoria created is warm and welcoming, with Maradona as a bridge of passion and culture between Naples and Buenos Aires. We recommend ordering the margherita, which features Italian tomato sauce, mozzarella fior di latte, basil, kilos of Parmesan, and can include spicy peppers. Or the burrata heart. Among the bianca pizzas, Brava comes with oven-baked raw ham with honey; Umbria brings caramelized onion and ricotta; Sorrento, potatoes with rosemary and lemon. They make seasonal specials like the fig one, which was a hit. Also, some days, they offer pepperoni and 5-cheese calzones.\n\nTip: They organize events to knead pizza, learn how to make the Neapolitan style, use the wood-fired oven, and then eat together and pair the pizza with Italian beer. Follow them to find out about the next edition. It fills up quickly so sign up as soon as you see it!\n\nWhere: Diagonal Toll 1420, Adrogu√©.\n\nA wood-fired grill born from a butcher shop in Belgrano, and not just any butcher shop: the first one where meat has identity and history. They buy live cattle at the market or directly from the producer and have all the info: what breed it is, where it was raised, what feeding system it fattened with, how old it is. With this backbone, traceability is their strength, besides this format, with Corte Comedor, allows them to fully utilize and integrate the animal. Here everything revolves around the good quality of raw material, charcuterie, dry aging that concentrates flavors and gains tenderness. \"We don't use charcoal and our grills are made of iron, we work with a crust burning on the meat that for us is fundamental. Our cooking points are below traditional Argentine ones. Ours is a meat cooked rare,\" Santiago Garat, one of the project owners, who is in charge of the gastronomic part, told us. The cuts most valued for aging and offered here are: T-Bone, narrow steak and ribeye with bone, roast, rump, picanha, and kidney. Before that, you have to try the trio of unique sausages: with jalape√±os, green curry paste, and mirasol chili. Or the golden chinchulines. As a side dish, lead sweet potato, fries proven√ßal. And yes, dessert is a classic flan with cream.\n\nWhere: Av. Olaz√°bal 1391.\n\nIt's already in its third season: it was born from Chila in 2023 to explore new paths hand in hand with friendly restaurants from different corners of the country, and thus achieved a federal and plural cuisine that makes the gastronomies of the provinces visible. Now, Amarra opens a new chapter: a three-course √† la carte menu, with five starters, five main courses, and a dessert cart; plus snacks and pre-dessert, which give a total of five courses. \"During the past year, we have dedicated ourselves to weaving intersections, uniting ties, creating moorings through dishes with colleagues from all regions of the country. Today, our project longs to intertwine with the nuances of culture, to find points of connection in regional cuisines, in world traditions, in the diverse disciplines of art, as we firmly believe that each gastronomic experience is, in its essence, a cultural act,\" chef Pedro Bargero told us. In 2024, Amarra will bring together professionals from the country to make dishes together, from a food engineer specializing in enzymes to a historian, a political scientist, different personalities with whom they will transform the menu throughout the year.\n\nWhere: Av. Alicia Moreau de Justo 1160.\n\nOne of the best tapas in Buenos Aires is Asian and it's at Chacarita, at ApuNena. This year they celebrate their 5th anniversary, full of vibes, flavors, and color in each of their dishes. Christina Sunae and Flor Ravioli are the friends and partners behind this venture that knows no bounds. The seed is a journey they took together to the Philippines, where Christina grew up, who has Korean blood, and learned to cook with her aunts and grandmother. Flor, who is a cook and nutritionist, was fascinated by the markets and street culinary culture. Having worked at El Bulli, she found a connection with Spanish tapas bars. Together they combined all these sensations and influences, plus Christina's experience in the two Asian restaurants she had in Buenos Aires, and Flor's at Moshi Moshi; to create ApuNena.\n\nApu means \"grandma\" in the dialect of Christina's Filipino family and Nena is the name of her grandmother, who lived until her nineties. Asian essence with local products in a conscious kitchen is the formula they found to synthesize all their knowledge and quests. Bar, lounge, terrace, you choose where to sit and what to try from the tremendous variety of flavors they propose in each tapa. Dumplings, baos, soups, noodles, grilled squid, fried chicken, Filipino empanadas, fish curry. \"Our mission is to bring Asian flavors and grandma's recipes to the neighborhood residents, tourists who visit us, and the whole community, of all ages. The little ones love ApuNena,\" Flor tells us, who also had a grandma who cooked really well.\n\nTip: Reservations are recommended if you want to eat at a table. They have two shifts, at 8 pm and at 10 pm. If it's a spontaneous visit, you can choose to sit at the bar.\n\nWhere: Aguirre 1600.\n\nRECOMMENDED:\n\nApuNena: 7 Unmissable Dishes You Have to Try\n\nThe first 100% gluten-free Italian restaurant in Latin America. Yes, although it may seem like a paradox, Donato de Santis made it possible. Instead of including gluten-free options on the menu of his famous restaurant in Buenos Aires, he decided to go to its original headquarters, the beloved small venue in Palermo that we all adore, and transform it with this premise. Thus, its flagship store where the mega gastronomic project was born has been different since 2021. But the soul and warmth remain intact, just like the feeling of an Italian trattoria.\n\nSo, here comes the tomato and rosemary focaccia, fluffy, soft, golden, made with sorghum and cassava flour. You can continue with a bruschetta, to taste all the magic they make without wheat, oats, barley, or rye. It's time for the Sicilian arancini di riso: fried rice croquettes filled with meat ragu, peas, and mozzarella, breaded with rice flour. Now it's time to try the star of the place, the great Ravioli Nino Bergese, filled with ricotta, parmesan, fresh spinach, and a center of fresh yolk, which explodes like a flavor volcano and melts over a truffle butter. If you've always dreamed of gluten-free fettuccine alla puttanesca, here you have them: capers, garlic, black olives, and Mar del Plata anchovies. Another option is to eat these homemade egg pastas with polpettine: meatballs of three meats cooked in Pomodoro sauce. We tried the cappellacci di zucca alla mantovana and they blew our minds with their delicacy: inside, butternut squash, outside an emulsion of butter and sage that we still remember. We leave with two desserts, the unmissable tiramisu from Donato and the Caprese cake, a delight from the island of Capri that is pure moist chocolate and almonds, it comes with amarenas.\n\nThe tip: there are specials off the menu. Maybe you arrive and they surprise you with some ravioli with Genoese sauce stuffed with braised meat, sweetbread, brain, and spinach.\n\nWhere: Ar√©valo 1538.\n\nOne of the most frequented restaurants in Villa Crespo is a vegetarian warehouse, set up on land that was unused, next to the train tracks. Yes, you can be a reference in gastronomy, even distinguished by Michelin, and do things differently. Without animal protein and for a mass audience, in a space that reclaimed a forgotten area of the city, where the only pretension is the clay oven and the vegetation. The four young owners of this restaurant, which is celebrating its 3rd year, have given a prominent place to mushrooms, which besides being all over the menu, in tasty dishes like the oyster mushroom milanesa and mushroom p√¢t√©; they are also seen in the cultivation cabinet. There are also preserves and pickles. The challenge is to change the classic dynamics of a kitchen, expand the limits of creativity, and focus on vegetables and grains. Fermented and pickled items crown the preparations; the pizza is supreme, like the unique brul√©e cheesecake.\n\nWhere: Loyola 1250.\n\nEverything that happens after ringing the bell is a pleasant surprise. This omakase spreads the art of giving without expecting anything in return, through its offering of flavors and attentive service. You share the bar with foreign tourists, Asians, and faithful followers of Damian Shiizu, who is of Japanese descent. The menu changes to offer the best catch of the day: after marinated and cooked edamame with soy, come lenguado nigiris, matured pejerrey, lemon fish, blow-torched squid; then sashimis, temakis, gunkan. And a delicious sesame ice cream to finish. A choreography so delicate and detailed that takes you straight to the East. The Michelin-recommended omakase is a very authentic expression of the importance of respect, hospitality, cordiality, and harmony for Japan. This spirit is known as Omotenashi: even if you don't know Japanese and can't read what's written on the canvas above the bar, you'll feel it all the time you're at Uni.\n\nWhere: Guatemala 5820.\n\nA steakhouse that respects the tradition and essence of the Argentine family, paying proud tribute to the culture of the R√≠o de la Plata. Gast√≥n Riveira is the chef behind this success, which has many reasons to stay at the top. They were consecrated for two: the quality of grilled meats and the set of small casseroles that accompany the main dish, with dozens of creative combinations. These small side dishes, served in an original way, gave them a different stamp, which they have maintained since day one.\n\nTwenty years is nothing or it's a lot, and they are already going for more. They take care of everything: what you're going to eat, where you're going to eat it, and how. Menu, ambiance, and service are their triad. The space is a marriage between a French bistro and a typical Buenos Aires tavern, which spreads joy. The art displayed by the grillers transforms the typical barbecue into a unique experience. The wine list is another ally.\n\nWhat started as an adventure of a lover of grilling, who decided to use the money from wedding gifts and savings to start his own project, is, was, and will continue to be a cult grill, which is already much more than just from Palermo. They have branches in Pilar, City Bell, Jujuy, and Salta. Abroad in Spain, the United States, the Philippines, Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Paraguay, and Chile.\n\nThe tip: La Cabrera's sirloin steak weighs 800 grams and the ribeye, 600. They don't go small.\n\nWhere: Jos√© Antonio Cabrera 5099. Jos√© Antonio Cabrera 5127.\n\nTo experience the tradition of Argentine barbecue in the front row, in front of the fire and the grill chef. Meats and wines are protagonists, in this old house in Palermo that was a tango theater, now renovated with a taste as exquisite as the meats they serve. The vegetables are organic, the proteins from La Pampa, from pasture animals that preserve the characteristic flavor of the Angus breed. The firewood comes from the North: the white wood, lighter, is used to light the fire; the red one, to make the embers. Eyebrow with cauliflower cream and corn on the coals, ribeye steak with sweet potato puree, a rib rack -which has 8 hours of cooking with different techniques-, matambre with citrus salad and yellow chili are some of the Argentine flavors that this luxury grill offers where the fire never goes out. The 9 steps are completed with smoked eggplant with ricotta, crispy provolone, and sweetbread with roasted tomato sauce plus ginger. The blood sausage comes with quince and apple chutney; the chorizo with bell pepper. For dessert, dulce de leche pancake, with Patagonian berries and cream. The pairing? An outstanding tour of high-end national wines, you choose from four proposals: standard, premium, Malbec discovery, and sommelier selection. The thing is, don't go by car because every time they see your empty glass, they'll fill it with happiness. The immensity of our countryside and our livestock culture, as the trigger for an immense tasting menu.\n\nWhere: Gorriti 3780.\n\nTo express in an 18-course menu the ecosystems of Argentina. That's what he set out to do and he succeeded masterfully: Gonzalo Aramburu's restaurant already has two Michelin stars. And he is very convinced: for 18 years he has been offering fine dining (he started in his place in Constituci√≥n). Another very important thing for someone who also made it to The Best Chef Awards list is haute cuisine with passion, with all the techniques and emotion. Everything here is important: innovation, aesthetics, and of course, flavors. In conservative Recoleta, Gonzalo makes very palpable avant-garde Argentine cuisine in every bite. Patagonian prawns are presented on a volcanic rock; razor clams, with yogurt, melon, and samphire; oysters, in champagne cream. The unbeatable one is the deer tartare with shiso leaf and king crab. White fish, duck magret, each one unfolds its character calmly, in ingenious combinations. In the charming Pasaje del Correo, the atmosphere is suggestive, with dark colors, subdued light, a scenic setting that also lets you see the chef at the stoves. A luxurious night, on every level, with the Relais & Ch√¢teaux seal. The wine list, with more than 120 labels, makes everything harmonious. The sweet steps transport you to the first floor of the restaurant, in a relaxed atmosphere to enjoy Aguaribay, pink pepper ice cream, and raspberries.\n\nTip: the quinoa and Andean potato risotto that is harvested at more than 2,400 meters above sea level -in the north of our country-, deglazed with northern white wine and goat bone broth was the dish that this chef took to Madrid Fusi√≥n this year.\n\nWhere: Vicente L√≥pez 1661.\n\nThey raise their own cattle and grow their own vegetables, in a close relationship with the environment that earned them a green Michelin star. This respectful presence with the environment is added to a past full of history: it opened its doors in 1952 as a simple diner, in this iconic pink building dating from 1885. In this super busy corner, the charm of the old grocery store-house coexists -which has cold cuts and peppers hanging at the counter- with a traditional menu of Porte√±o food. You have to start with the artisanal cold cuts that demonstrate Guido Tassi's mastery: chacarero salami, bondiola, spianata, pancetta. And continue with its acclaimed ribeye steak milanesa. For side dishes, you can choose any salad, they work with organic vegetables and unique varieties, like Reliquia tomatoes. \"El preferido de Palermo\" has been renewed to face its glory stage and international awards keep pouring in.\n\nWhere: Jorge Luis Borges 2108.\n\nLet's start with the basics: the name. Casa S√°enz refers to the hardware store owned by Chef Ximena S√°enz's father, in Monte Grande. And that already gives us a hint of everything: through her restaurant, Ximena seeks to express all her heritage, her roots, and what she learned in so many years of traveling around the country and enjoying Argentine cuisine. That's why a large clay oven is the center and heart of Casa S√°enz, inspired by her travels through our provinces, where the chef found one in many homes.\n\nThe menu is inspired by the entire Argentine territory, dishes that tell stories, and others, reimagined classics, always starting from a strict curation of federal raw materials. The wines have the same national spirit: from more than eight Argentine provinces. Also, as our country has done throughout its history, the menu adds other influences: immigrant cuisine, from communities. The result is a beautiful melting pot that invites flavor with potato omelette with aioli; patagonzola with roasted peach; beef milanese, Jujuy steak with peanuts, lime, and cilantro; trout over pea puree with pebre. For desserts, you'll be amazed by the chocolate shimmy with buffalo milk dulce de leche and sabl√© dough topped with toasted marshmallow. It went so well that they've already opened their second location, now you can enjoy their vibrant cuisine in Belgrano and near the Botanical Garden.\n\nThe tip: if you're on a veggie plan, you can't miss the roasted sweet potatoes, pumpkins, and carrots with yogurt sauce and chermoula - the North African herb sauce -, some crispy oyster mushrooms, and Greek tomato croquettes with tzatziki.\n\nWhere: Echeverr√≠a 2102 and Rep√∫blica √Årabe Siria 3001.\n\nA hidden gem in Colegiales, Catalino was one of the pioneers in professing and practicing agroecology and food sovereignty. Organic, conscious, and run by its owners: the Tejerina sisters, Mariana and Raquel, who only work with raw materials from small producers and alternative meats. The feminine energy is palpable in this house with high ceilings, wooden floors, and a charming courtyard with a clay oven. Calmness, skill, and commitment are the values behind the dishes they propose, which naturally change with the seasonality of the products. Whenever you visit, you'll be surprised, whether with a parsley root tempura or a hearty stew with beans and buffalo. Carvivores and veggies alike are satisfied: in addition to unusual meats like vizcacha and partridge, they offer dishes with seasonal vegetables and fruits, which pair perfectly with a selection of biodynamic wines and labels from small Argentine wineries.\n\nFun fact: In addition to composters, they have their own garden, planting to achieve circularity in the city. When they harvest and have surplus, they put it up for sale. Follow them on IG to find out about their markets!\n\nWhere: Maure 3126.\n\nHere, they don't serve grandma's food, but rather food from grandmothers, on dishes that are also from another era. The vintage dining room, with rustic touches, exudes a relaxed yet fun atmosphere. Home recipes from different parts of the world, rescued and given a daring twist by the young owner-chef, Nicol√°s Tykocki, and his father. The exuberance is twofold, in flavors and satisfaction: each dish comes with several side dishes. From a lamb kofta served with labneh, baba ganoush, and bazlama, to Korean tteokbokki, fried chicken, or the off-menu item that changes daily. To finish, the brioche torrija. They don't take reservations, so it's best to arrive early not to miss out on this Chacarita boom.\n\nFun fact: On special nights, the staff's grandmothers come as guest chefs. Don't miss the \"Abuelas de √Åcido\" cycle!\n\nWhere: Charlone 999.\n\nMore than a restaurant, it's a bet on the future of food, a research project by chef Germ√°n Martitegui. It opened its doors in 2021, taking over from Tegui: the unforgettable fine dining in Palermo that became an emblem of Argentine haute cuisine internationally for 12 years. This time, Germ√°n's dream is different: to offer good food without sacrificing animals. The jury of the reality show \"Masterchef Argentina\" surprises with an authorial and seasonal proposal, 100% vegetarian, which also includes vegan options. Located in the inner garden of an elegant Buenos Aires mansion, Marti is dominated by a central kitchen-bar, from where you can see the team in action.\n\nThe freshness of the ingredients and natural products come together in delicate dishes that can include up to 20 ingredients, making them a feast of authentic flavors. Everything changes with the season, but the hits remain: mushroom shawarma and cheese souffl√©. On weekends there's brunch with cassava omelet and Green Grape Spritz.\n\nTip: We recommend ordering the mushrooms they grow themselves in the \"mushroomery.\"\n\nWhere: Rodr√≠guez Pe√±a 1973.\n\nA bistro with the soul of a tavern, housed in a classic \"chorizo house\" in Palermo. Facundo Kelemen brings contemporary inspiration to the classics of Buenos Aires' popular recipes, served in small plates for sharing. Bar cuisine with a fresh perspective, through the eyes of a chef who worked in New York and has been a gastronomic tourist since childhood, sampling the best of the best restaurants in the world. On the walls, photos of his grandfather, who was a football player at Racing Club; on the menu, 14 dishes, including spicy fried beef empanadas that you have to eat in one bite because they burst with juice, scrambled eggs with potato foam, steak tartare with quince and capers accompanied by a fried cake, pizza-flavored matambre, and fain√°. And the repertoire goes further, with a milanesa sandwich that emulates a Japanese katsu sando. For dessert, chocolate mousse with cereals, or rogel with layers of meringue. Wines also have a contemporary vision, focusing on small wineries with minimal intervention viticulture.\n\nWhere: Cabrera 5172.\n\nAwarded the Bib Gourmand distinction by the famous Michelin guide for the best value-for-money relationships. A cozy and informal corner, with homemade touches. This trattoria is everything we expect (and love) from an Italian restaurant in Buenos Aires. Simplicity elevated to excellence. Or product exalted. The formula with which chef-owner Julieta Oriolo touches hearts. In addition to her passion for her ancestors' country and family culinary legacy, her travels to different Italian regions update her recipes. The cellar provides a great selection that accompanies the Italian essence of this cuisine with labels from garage wineries and prestigious Argentine wineries. To start, veal carpaccio, marinated zucchini, and plenty of parmesan; some calamaretti with pallares beans, jalape√±os, and guanciale. Or classic eggplant parmigiana with Italian tomato pomodoro, fior di latte, and pesto. Among the homemade pastas, garganelli with white ragout, mushrooms, truffle; tortelli with ricotta, mortadella, and peas; spaghetti aglio, olio e gamberi with plenty of chili and fresh parsley. For dessert, pistachio ice cream profiteroles with chocolate sauce or pavlova with lemon curd, fresh cream, and red fruits.\n\nFun fact: Stop by La Alacena Pastificio & Salumeria to take home everything you liked (it's two blocks away).\n\nWhere: Gasc√≥n 1401.\n\nThis restaurant is everything done right, even in terms of value for money. That's why it's fully booked for 2024, and it proudly doesn't have a single post on Instagram, in the age of gastrotubers. The secret is in taking risks and heading to Chacarita to see if you can snag a table to experience this factory of successes that was once a soda siphon factory. Excellent charcuterie and Argentine cheeses on boards designed for sharing are the perfect prelude to a river fish that takes us to the Argentine coast, like the chipa guaz√∫ with smoked surub√≠. Or something from the grill - which captivates you as soon as you enter the dining room - like a skirt steak with chimichurri, ending with a reimagined Mar del Plata alfajor. If you're out of luck, head to Anchoita Cava, which far from being the consolation prize for those who can't get a table, is another fantastic idea from the multifaceted Enrique Pi√±eyro for his gastronomic project. Inconceivable like everything the pilot, actor, filmmaker, activist, rescuer, and aeronautical doctor does, who has also created a myth of Buenos Aires cuisine, winning the green Michelin star. For its 18 hectares of production, farms where they raise pigs, chickens, and geese, agreements with sustainable suppliers, and work with anthropologists for a respectful supply chain.\n\nWhere: Juan Ram√≠rez De Velasco 1520.\n\nWe continue with another Bib Gourmand that also delivers authentic food in a friendly space: a beautiful corner in Palermo with a decorated facade is the perfect introduction to its cuisine. The place is as warm as the gastronomy, a blend of style with a homely spirit. The menu caters to all tastes; whether you prefer meats or vegetables, there are flavors and textures to suit varied preferences. The experience begins with brioche and smoked butter, and can continue with pat√© with fig chutney, hazelnuts, pickles, and crackers or duck terrine with hazelnuts. Then, lemon fish crudo, tuna juice, cherry granita, or chorizo beef tartare with fried red quinoa and aguaribay emulsion. For mains, the pasta dishes are a favorite, such as spaghetti with grilled mushrooms and mushroom broth. A dessert that encapsulates all flavors is the coffee parfait with black olives, carob, and cocoa meringue.\n\nTip: Don't miss the new cycle of guest restaurants: friends' chefs intervene at Reliquia.\n\nWhere: Carranza 1601.\n\nIt has a red star and a green one. What comes first? The chicken or the egg? The gastronomy and sustainability award was given for controlling the seeds they plant and the cattle they raise, which are also considered for soil recovery. Pablo Rivero's holistic vision for this grill is talked about in Argentina and around the world. The corner where the chef-owner founded a local after coming from Rosario, where his grandfather was a butcher and his parents were ranchers, has become an icon. Overflowing with people, it has all the fans and all the records. They work at full capacity every day - the wait is with champagne in hand - in this gourmet grill where everything is on display, from Hereford and Angus cuts to mixed aging processes and fires. Another highlight is the terrace, overlooking the lively Palermo neighborhood. Their concept is regenerative livestock farming, their spirit, that of a Buenos Aires barbecue. The cellar focuses on great national wines. A plaque on the facade makes it clear: it's a tourist attraction in Palermo. The grill master recommends house cuts, such as sirloin steak and skirt steak, after the chorizo, blood sausage, and grilling sausage board. Yes to empanadas and corn with squash and cheese. Even the french fries are sublime.\n\nWhere: Guatemala 4699.\n\nWe continue with its younger sister, born a couple of blocks away, on a modern corner with glass walls. The bar and grills catch the eye in this restaurant that revolves around the ingredient, permeated by fire. Wine, of course, is part of the equation - they have a rich selection from our country's terroirs, from North to South through its grape varieties - as is the service. Various shared dishes are dispatched from the open kitchen: fried artichoke with peanut sauce and smoked turnip ponzu, halloumi with burnt watermelon, garlic prawns, vinegar-marinated Torront√©s wine pickled smelt, grilled squid with bean stew. The rule is to put them in the center of the table and try a bit of each, in a feast of colors and flavors, like the salad of fresh and charred leaves with calendula and lavender flowers. For dessert, a cup of fruit and sparkling wine sabayon. The space was conceived for that, for enjoyment in company. There's noise of cooking, conversations, and laughter! An idea of Julio Mart√≠n B√°ez, who is also the executive chef of this Michelin-recommended restaurant.\n\nWhere: Darwin 1111.\n\nElena is the only hotel restaurant on Latin America's 50 Best Restaurants list, where it has held its place for 10 years now. Being housed in the elegant Four Seasons Buenos Aires adds another layer of mystique to the experience. Before even reaching the table, guests immerse themselves in the international atmosphere and traveler's spirit that permeates the sophisticated building. Upon entering Elena, the magic reignites: its design draws inspiration from the old houses of San Telmo and the tango halls of that neighborhood. The glass dome, the wine cellar, the open kitchen, and the aging chambers create a salon full of stimuli, where it's a pleasure to sit down and enjoy the meats that have made them so renowned. Charcuterie and brasserie are their two pillars, so it's worth starting with a platter of cold cuts: Kobe bresaola, duck ham, Camembert, and aged cheddar, followed by the dry-aged steak, a monumental piece weighing 950 grams to share. Josper-grilled meats are their signature (Angus sirloin steak, 45-day dry-aged Angus T-Bone, Argentine Wagyu ribeye), although if you're craving something from the sea, the achiote octopus and Andean potato ceviche are excellent choices. Their wine list treasures several national gems, with labels from all regions of Argentina.\n\nFun fact: The side dishes are out of this world, crafted as meticulously as the proteins themselves.\n\nWhere: Posadas 1086.\n\nThe newest Italian restaurant in the Michelin Guide resides within a Palermo hotel. It's been around for just over a year, yet everyone is already talking about its Italian cuisine with Argentine ingredients. Mar del Plata anchovies, Salta chili, and Mendoza olives in artisanal casarecce pasta. La Rioja black olives and Santiago del Estero capers for puttanesca sauce. The pistachios are from San Juan; the meat and vegetables from the Buenos Aires countryside. At Raggio, the products of our land and sea come together with traditional recipes that Sebasti√°n Raggiante brings from his native Bologna. The bar catches the eye and is well-equipped: it offers a high-end selection of Italian cocktails, world classics, and signature drinks. The wine selection includes a variety of lesser-known grapes in these parts, such as garnacha, sangiovese, nebbiolo, and barbera for reds; and Pedro Xim√©nez, malvas√≠a, and verdicchio for whites.\n\nTo start, indulge in some affettati. Bresaola, a cold cut from the central Alps, is served with whole grain mustard and lemon. Mortadella comes with fresh ricotta. Don't miss the olives and matured Parmesan, served with organic honey. For homemade pasta, the chef offers a variety of gnocchi, rigatoni, conchiglioni, and some rarities like gigli or maltagliati. Their seafood marinara is unforgettable: a bounty of mussels, squid, octopus, and scallops. For dessert, don't skip the panna cotta.\n\nFun fact: When you sit down at Raggio, without asking, a bountiful breadbasket arrives at the table, accompanied by a spicy oil. Also, sparkling or still water, all at no extra cost.\n\nWhere: Gurruchaga 2121.\n\nLet's head to Parque Lezama to enjoy a restaurant that, in the heart of the historic neighborhood, offers retro details and homestyle cooking, as its name suggests. Without many other pretensions than to serve very delicious food in a pleasant and luminous space with large windows. Here, the only secret is that they cook the way they like to eat: they strive to make everyone feel welcome and relaxed, so they can unwind and enjoy that food they could cook at home but has that certain something here. The menu, very traditional, offers Argentine classics, from grilled polenta with tomatoes and portobellos to sirloin steak with smashed potatoes and salad. The coconut flan is unbeatable.\n\nWhere: Avenida Caseros 486.\n\nThe Korean cuisine boom in Buenos Aires shows no signs of stopping and adds spaces to enjoy its peculiar flavors. Nowadays, there's no need to go to the Flores neighborhood; the second and third generation of immigrants, who traditionally worked in the textile industry, have ventured into the kitchen and opened restaurants in other neighborhoods of the city. This is the case of Marina Lis Ra, leading Na Num in Chacarita, with her proposal of non-traditional Korean cuisine. A small yet impeccable space, with a bar and an open kitchen plus a few tables. All dishes on the menu are recommended, from sweet potato tortilla with wasabi aioli, teriyaki & fennel salad, and spicy tteokbokki with blue cheese & mozzarella cream to smoked mushrooms with roasted kimchi and cauliflower puree, pork ribs, and their interpretation of humita. Accompany with jasmine gin tonic. We love it because it's open on Mondays. We admire it because Na Num opened in Madrid. We applaud it because it's a Michelin recommendation.\n\nFun fact: They launched the evening executive menu, an excellent idea that runs from Monday to Thursday. You choose your starter, main course, and dessert, with a glass of wine included.\n\nWhere: Roseti 177.\n\nTo champion seafood in a country obsessed with barbecue: that's what this restaurant set out to do 19 years ago, and it succeeded. Argentina's immense coastline couldn't continue to be ignored. Gabriel Oggero's talent in a disruptive kitchen overlooking the water made Crizia \"swim strong\": it achieved the Michelin star for sustainability, among other international recognitions. Oysters are their flagship product, with which they have worked since day one, carefully monitoring their development and traceability. Other dishes draw inspiration from the ocean and the forest, with products from Patagonia, such as the Comodoro Rivadavia shrimp snack with tree tomato, tangerine, and red currant vinegar. Using the same approach is the crispy black rice with fresh seafood finished on the iron griddle with extra virgin olive oil and lemon aioli. And the Las Grutas scallops, roasted with wood-fired butter. Everything is enjoyed in a modern space in Palermo, with an open kitchen and an impressive wine cellar at its center. Desserts pay homage to seasonal flowers and fruits.\n\nWhere: Fitz Roy 1819.\n\nIt's the coolest place in La Lucila, with a graffiti-covered open kitchen, a pioneer of the sharing plate trend, complemented by fine wines. The wine cellar is precisely the heart of this project, with labels characterized by minimal intervention. The communal table that dominates the salon is always buzzing, just like the sidewalk, which provides the perfect setting to enjoy their street food from various world capitals in a sophisticated version with Asian nods. Chicken wonton, ginger, negui, and chili oil; smoked pork belly bao, pickled cucumber, spring onion, chili dipping sauce; pork shoulder tacos with achiote, black bean sauce, llanero cheese, and avocado foam; beef tataki in rice paper with oyster dressing, cured egg yolk br√ªl√©e, and lemon ash; langoustine and pork dumplings with walnuts, fermented carrot, homemade hoisin, spring onion, and pepper gomasio. The appearance is simple; the flavors, bold, like the natural wines that accompany them: oranges and P√©t Nat from small biodynamic producers. The vision of five lifelong friends to create a small space filled with good flavors.\n\nWhere: Av. del Libertador 3810, La Lucila.\n\nSince we're in the Northern Zone, let's head to the place that transformed the face of Olivos Harbor, with the signature of Fernando Trocca, who, after success in Jos√© Ignacio and the Hamptons, opened his place on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, always close to the water. At noon, a rich buffet is served, a play of levels, colors, and textures, so you can create your plate to your liking, serving yourself whatever protein and side dishes you fancy, in the size of plate you've chosen. When the sun sets, the fire ignites in this charming space with a deck as a forecourt. It's worth starting with a cocktail on the riverfront terrace - the Bloody Mary is very good - and then indulging in some Lyon-style baby squid with caramelized onion, garlic, and cubed fries. And grilled corn and cabutia humita with pistachio cream. For the main course, pork shoulder with orange reduction, yogurt, and pickles. Or ribeye with grilled kale and bell pepper. To finish, banoffee cake. To get into vacation mode.\n\nWhere: Juan Bautista Alberdi 25, Olivos.\n\nNot everyone knows about this seafood and shellfish emporium, tucked away in a corner of Almagro, where many other loyal customers - who do have it on their radar - come in search of the best Portuguese cuisine in the city. \"Our culture is familial; here, Argentines come to eat, sometimes a tourist drops by from word of mouth,\" Gustavo Cano told us, serving artisanal fish and defending cod. It turns out that the chef-owner, after his time in Europe, brought to Buenos Aires an unconditional love for this fish and recipes that aren't as popular with the locals. After 26 years of Damble√©, he now welcomes Portugal's ambassadors to his premises. Even the president of his home country, Luis Lacalle Pou, has visited. The chef champions the power of cod, which disappeared from restaurants due to its cost and the amount of work it requires. For him, it's a passion and a mission: to respect tradition and ensure that gastronomic heritage isn't lost. And there's much more. \"We're receiving fibrous anchovies from Mar del Plata, spectacular Patagonian sole, meaty grouper, prawns, octopus,\" Gustavo added. Their oyster bar - mesmerizing as soon as you enter the salon, very brasserie-style - comes alive during happy hour. For snacks, potato omelet with clams, sardines with tomato, scallop ceviche, gratinated oysters. The menu has more than four pages (almost as long as the avenue where they're located) and is full of genius, from Basque-style tripe to Valencian paella.\n\nWhere: Av. Rivadavia 3401.\n\nContinuing our culinary excursion outside the classic gastronomic circuit of Buenos Aires, we venture into the Maradonian neighborhood of La Paternal, to find a restaurant that is still a well-kept secret. In a large property that was once a bakery and still retains the old ovens, chef Jazm√≠n Marturet set up her temple of multiple influences, founding her own creed. Having traveled the world as a chef for a well-known Latin American singer, she now summarizes what she's learned at MN Santa In√©s. From a curry to a pozole, from a pho to brain ravioli or feijoada with fried fish. Or a spicy Malaysian rendang with tamarind and coconut milk. For dessert, peanut butter flan, with cream and mango. The menu is concise, inventive, and hearty, and the prices are very friendly for an extraordinary midday meal on the island of La Paternal. Note that it only opens for lunch.\n\nWhere: √Åvalos 360.\n\nThis omakase is gaining momentum, albeit very quietly, hidden in an apartment in Palermo Hollywood already listed in the pages of the Michelin Guide. Even if you have the address, you'll be surprised upon arrival because nothing gives you a hint. What happens after you ring the doorbell is also amazing, so we won't spoil it for you now. \"When I traveled to Japan, I learned that restaurants are not only on the street,\" observed its creator, Marcello El. And he told us: \"Buri isn't a secret; it's entering a magical place, different from what we're used to when we go out to eat. You leave everything behind and prepare yourself to enjoy.\" Consistency, product work, generating new channels for the commercialization of Argentine fishing. Everything comes together with the intention of delighting the diner. The bar accommodates 10 guests in a single shift, at 8:30 pm. The chef-owner draws inspiration from Kyoto traditions, more kaiseki style, so before the local fish nigiri (sometimes serving more than 12 varieties of fish), he serves other dishes, such as chawanmushi, in a crescendo of flavors.\n\nWhere: Guatemala 5781.\n\nLeonardo Fumarola presents modern Italian cuisine at L‚Äôadesso. \"The idea is to bring the new concept of Italian cuisine, updating the image in Buenos Aires that comes from what the immigrants brought. This has to do with what is happening there now,\" the author summarized his adaptation of ancient cuisine for us.
