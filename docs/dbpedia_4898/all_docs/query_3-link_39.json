        "text": "Co-founder of Pickles by EITC with Christine Beziat.\n\nTrained social worker (Cardijn, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium).\n\nAfter having travelled all across Ireland from 1998 to 2008 as an actor in school tours for students learning French, Xavier decided to share his knowledge and experience on the continent. And so, as a writer and director, he now creates english speaking shows for students learning english as a foreign language.\n\n“In my role as a director, it’s a joy to be able to follow our teams of actors daily, having pushed them so hard during the rehearsals :) and what a joy it is to see your reactions, our dear audience! What else? Oh yes, I love a good beer, perfectly chilled, after a long day of walking or snowboarding. I also love swimming in ice cold water (from the beaches of Donegal to the Saint Lawrence river) but, some things that I can’t stand are flat tyres, sweetbread (even if they are nothing alike, I still don’t like them) and not being able to control the situation.\n\nDreams, I’ve got plenty… but I never remember them when I wake up in the morning.”\n\nCo-founder of Pickles by EITC with Xavier Hock.\n\nTrained trilingual secretary assistant (Ozenne, Toulouse, France)\n\nShe’s the one who organises the tour’s planning for our actors, an impossible puzzle that only she knows the answer to. She’s in charge of the tour, our communication…\n\nOriginally from Toulouse, Christine lived in Dublin between 2002 and 2009. She’s worked in banks, as a riding teacher before finally dipping her toe into the world of Theatre in Education. Her first experience was with FTFS and then in 2008, she created Pickles by EITC with Xavier.\n\n“My dream would be to travel the world and to be able to speak multiple rare languages. I love the sun, a Bach prelude, a galop in a field, Ludwig von 88, a good book, time with friends, blueberries… Injustice drives me mad, disrespect makes my hair stand on end and as for meat, I’ve been disgusted by it forever.”\n\nIn 2010, when my little sister (Christine) asked me if I was able to help out for a few hours here and there with the accounts or to send a few mails… I answered “of course! I’ve got time to do that”. Well, now I have a lot less time because I’m working full time in this great adventure and what a joy that is!!!\n\nI may be a part of the less artistic side of the company, the one who keeps everyone grounded, but it takes all sorts to keep a team running!\n\nBut don’t worry, I leave my office from time to time in order to take part in my passion: handball. After travelling all across France as a player, I’m now involved as a referee.\n\nDreams? Surely! But just like Xavier, I don’t remember them in the morning. A philosophy? Never regret the past, don’t speculate about the future and live fully in the present!\n\nI love it when a plan comes together. I love packing my back, it’s always the promise of new adventures, new encounters. I love Monty Python and a cold beer, even if these two have nothing to do with each other.\n\nI hate the smell of body spray in a rehearsal room, “endives cuites” and I hate it when actors ask me “what’s that?” when talking about “endives cuites” it’s impossible to translate!! Try and see what happens, all you need is a native english speaker and a plate of “endives cuites”. Let it rest for 5 minutes and serve hot.\n\nMy dream: To travel the world on skates. Or without.\n\nStarting my journey in the East of London in a place known as Walthamstow, passing by East 15 acting school, across Europe and ending up in Paris where I now live, I have always loved the way that theatre crosses borders. Whether that be through language, culture, class or generation. Theatre has a power like no other. And that is what I love about working with Pickles, they explore this power to its full extent!\n\nHaving worked with Pickles at 21 as an actress, I have now been working with and training the new actors since 2016. Here’s to more adventures!\n\nAn actor at heart, I loved the idea of hitting the road and showing our beautiful country to our Irish friends.\n\nTo go on an adventure together, for better or for worse. And so we happily shout at the cars in front of us that aren’t moving, we sing old classics that come on the radio and we let ourselves be swept away by the countryside that passes beside us. Well… we do all that when we’re not late, otherwise, we race down the motorway!\n\nAlong with all that, I love old french films and playing cards, but I don’t tell the actors that when we play poker and the winner gets to choose the time when they can use the bathroom!\n\nI made a deal with the actors, they teach me the secrets of Shakespeare and I reveal the wonders of Molière to them. And who knows, maybe one day it’ll be me hitting Irish roads to share a bit of French culture with the Irish.\n\nFrench actor for the last 10 years, I’ve already traveled almost all the french roads, from north to south and east to west but always for shows in french.\n\nFrom now on I would like to expand my career internationally. Thus, the idea of practicing the English language on a daily basis with the PICKLES Company immediately appealed to me.\n\nI am always eager to live new experiences and I am looking forward to being on the road with these young English speaking native actors."
