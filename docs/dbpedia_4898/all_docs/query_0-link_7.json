She is primarily known for television roles, and was once nominated for a \"Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series.\"\n\nIn 1969, Weigert was born in Washington D.C. Her family is of Jewish heritage. Her parents were the psychiatrist Wolfgang Oscar Weigert and his wife Dionne Laufman. Her father was from Berlin, Germany, but emigrated to the United States decades before Robin's birth.\n\nWeigert was educated at Brandeis University, an American private research university located in Waltham, Massachusetts. Brandeis is a secular, non-sectarian, and coeducational institution, sponsored by the Jewish-American community, It was named after Louis Dembitz Brandeis, the first Jewish Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States (1856-1941, term 1916-1939). Weigert graduated in 1991, at the age of 22.\n\nDeciding to follow an acting career, Weigert enrolled in the Graduate Acting Program of the New York University Tisch School of the Arts. Tisch is a performing, cinematic, and media arts school located in Manhattan, New York City. Following her graduation, Weigert spend the first years of her career as a theatrical actress in New York City. She eventually decided to move to Los Angeles, California, where she hoped to find better career opportunities.\n\nWeigert started her television career with cameo roles in television films such as \"Mary and Rhoda\" (2000), a spin-off of the sitcom \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" (1970-1977). She appeared in guest star roles in a number of police procedural television series, such as \"Law & Order\", \"Without a Trace\", \"NYPD Blue\", \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\", and \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\". Her first recurring role was that of Detective Anna Mayes in the early seasons of the police procedural series \"Cold Case\" (2003-2010). In the series Mayes is a former work colleague of Scotty Valens (one of the main characters) and is on occasion called to assist the main team in their investigations of cold cases.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2006, Weigert played her breakthrough role of frontierswoman Martha Jane \"Calamity Jane\" Canary (1852-1903) in the Western television series \"Deadwood\" (2004-2006). The series was set in the 1870s, and depicted life in the Dakota Territory (1861-1889), an organized incorporated territory of the United States. Weigert's role as the \"unkempt, cantankerous, and foul-mouthed drunkard\" Calamity Jane received critical praise. Weigert was nominated for a \"Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series\" for this role, but the Award for 2004 was instead won by rival actress Drea de Matteo (1972-).\n\nThe increased attention helped Weigert gain a number of film roles. She appeared in the drama film \"Loggerheads\" (2005) which depicted estranged families, in the neo-noir film \"The Good German\" (2006), and the drug-addiction themed film \"Things We Lost in the Fire\" (2007). She had a more substantial role in the \"postmodern\" drama film \"Synecdoche, New York\" (2008), playing the adult version of the character Olive Cotard (with the child version played by Sadie Goldstein).\n\nAfter several years of mostly appearing in films, Weigert returned to television in 2010 with the recurring role of lawyer Ally Lowen in the contemporary Western television series \"Sons of Anarchy\" (2008-2014). The series depicted the lives of a close-knit outlaw motorcycle club in California, and utilize Old West themes and motifs in a contemporary setting. Lowen was a recurring character in Seasons 3, 5, and 6.\n\nIn 2013, Weigert played the lead role of Abby Ableman in the lesbian-themed drama film \"Concussion\". Weigert received critical praise for the role, and was nominated for a \"Gotham Independent Film Award for Breakthrough Actor\". The Award for the year was instead won by rival actor Michael Bakari Jordan (1987-).\n\nIn 2015, Weigert joined the cast of the neo-noir television series \"Jessica Jones\" (2015-) during its first season. She played the role of physician Dr. Wendy Ross-Hogarth, the same-sex wife of lawyer Jeryn \"Jeri\" Hogarth (played Carrie-Anne Moss).\n\nIn 2016, Weigert provided voice acting for the animated television series \"Transformers: Robots in Disguise\" (2015-2017). In the series, Weigert depicted the female villain Scatterspike, a member of the Scavengers. The Scavengers are depicted as a sub-group of the Decepticons, who earn a living by salvaging technological relics left behind by the Autobots during Cybertron's Great War.\n\nIn 2017, Weigert depicted the CIA agent Heather Myles in the British mini-series \"Fearless\". Myles is the series' main antagonist. Also in 2017, Weigert joined the cast of the dramatic television series \"Big Little Lies\" (2017-). She plays the recurring role of Dr. Amanda Reisman. the therapist attending to a married couple, Perry and Celeste Wright (played by Alexander Skarsgård and Nicole Kidman).\n\nIn 2018, Weigert played the role of \"body-positive therapist\" Verena Baptist in the black comedy mini-series \"Dietland\". In the series, Baptist is a published author and feminist activist, who is known for helping marginalized women to gain a new perspective in life and to struggle against misogyny. But her life lessons may have inspired a vigilante group in a series of murders against supposedly villainous men.\n\nFrom 2018 to 2019, Weigert played the recurring role of Jamie Hudson in the third and and final season of the espionage-themed series \"Berlin Station\" (2016-2019). Hudson is depicted as a college buddy of Valerie Edwards (played by Michelle Forbes), the Section Chief of CIA's operatives in Berlin, Germany. Edwards is one of the main characters of the series.\n\nIn 2019, Weigert returned to the role of Calamity Jane in the Western television film \"Deadwood: The Movie\". It is a sequel of the television series \"Deadwood\" and the main action is set in the year 1889, just as South Dakota is declared a new U.S. state. By 2019, Weigert was 50 years old, but her career showed no signs of slowing down. She remains a popular character actress, with regular appearances in television.\n\nMarg Helgenberger is an established dramatic actress whose prominence has been steadily increasing. Her work has been noted on stage, film and TV. Most of her career has been spent in dramatic roles on television, but she has also had a noteworthy presence in feature films.\n\nHelgenberger earned a degree in drama at Northwestern University. A talent scout recruited her from there to work on the soap opera Ryan's Hope (1975) where she appeared over the course of the next four years.\n\nThroughout the 1990s Helgenberger took on numerous roles in made-for-TV movies and as a guest star on many TV series. In particular she appeared in many movies made specifically for the Lifetime cable network and also for Showtime. She won critical acclaim for Brennende Herzen (1992), Thanks of a Grateful Nation (1998) and Es geschah in Boulder (2000).\n\nIn TV series she won an Emmy for her portrayal of a hard-bitten prostitute who catered to Vietnam War soldiers, in the series China Beach (1988). She also was George Clooney's love interest in a multi-episode arc of the monumentally successful TV series Emergency Room: Die Notaufnahme (1994).\n\nIn feature films, Helgenberger has appeared in Tootsie (1982), Steven Spielberg's Always - Der Feuerengel von Montana (1989), Species (1995) and Reine Chefsache (2004).\n\nHer greatest claim to fame on the silver screen may be when she played opposite Julia Roberts as a chemical exposure victim in the popular movie Erin Brockovich (2000).\n\nHelgenberger is most known for her TV role as a crime scene investigator in CSI: Vegas (2000). She shared in CSI's 2005 Screen Actors Guild award for outstanding performance by an ensemble in a drama series.\n\nIn her personal life, Helgenberger is the daughter of a cancer survivor and is very active in supporting research for breast cancer.\n\nEllen Corby was born Ellen Hansen on June 3, 1911, in Racine, Wisconsin. She played many uncredited bit parts from the late '20s through the '30s. Ellen would not be seen on the big screen again until 1945 in Cornered (1945). In 1946, she appeared in 14 films, although mostly in small, minor roles. One of them was in the Christmas classic Ist das Leben nicht schön? (1946). One of the highlights of her career came about in 1948 in Geheimnis der Mutter (1948) as Aunt Trina. Ellen garnered a nomination for Best Supporting Actress, which was ultimately won by Claire Trevor in Gangster in Key Largo (1948). The Oscar nomination didn't send her to the heights she had hoped. This wonderful actress continued in roles that were mostly minor compared to some of her contemporaries. However, it was television where she would receive the acclaim that had eluded her on the screen. Time after time she played parts that were absolutely outstanding. One of the funniest was as Myrt \"Hubcaps\" Lesh in The Andy Griffith Show (1960). She was the ringleader of a gang that stole cars and then sold them, and she sold Barney Fife a stolen car that turned out to be a real lemon. The series that brought her worldwide recognition, though, was the highly acclaimed Die Waltons (1972) as Esther \"Grandma\" Walton. The role got her Emmy awards in 1973, 1974, and 1975. Although a stroke in 1976 slowed her down, Ellen still made appearances on the series. Her last TV appearance was in 1997 in the TV movie Die Waltons - Nachwuchs für John Boy (1997). On April 14, 1999, Ellen died at the Motion Picture & Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, California. She was 87 years old.\n\nBetty Thomas was born July 27, 1947 in St. Louis, Missouri, graduating from Ohio University with a BA in fine arts. Initially sidetracked, Betty first taught school in Chicago but found herself restricted and needing more of an open forum for self-expression than a classroom. She found herself drawn inextricably to comedy. After toiling as a waitress, she became part of the Second City improvisational troupe where she made use of her towering (6' 1\") imposing features in aggressive routines and sketches. True to form, she made her film debut in the sketch satire Tunnel Vision (1976) which parodied TV programming. The movie is lesser known today for its satirical bite and more for its exceptional cast of up-and-coming comedy artists at the time including Chevy Chase, Laraine Newman, John Candy, Joe Flaherty, Gerrit Graham, Howard Hesseman, and the team of Al Franken and Tom Davis. Other innocuous comedies/spoofs followed such as Chesty Anderson U.S. Navy (1976), Mit einem Bein im Kittchen (1980), and Loose Shoes (1978) which, at the very least, helped to bulk up her comedy resume. She also appeared as a regular on The Fun Factory (1976), which was three parts quiz show, silly sketches, and audience participation.\n\nIronically, Betty achieved her stardom not in comedy but in hard-hitting drama. Doing a complete about face as tough-talking Officer Lucille Bates on the hit police series Polizeirevier Hill Street (1981), she displayed both grit and vulnerability as she stood nose-to-nose alongside the rest of the male-oriented precinct. She was nominated for six Emmys in all and won the \"Best Supporting Actress\" trophy in 1985. Some equally compelling mini-movie roles came along with this success. In the late 1980s, Betty made an abrupt and concentrated move into TV and film directing, one of her last acting roles being that of the butch, underhanded scoutmaster (and Shelley Long's misery-inducing nemesis) in the obvious comedy film Die Wilde von Beverly Hills (1989).\n\nBetty received her bookend Emmy award while directing the cable sitcom Dream On (1990). She never lost her taste for comedy satire, however. One of her major box office successes would come with the spot-on parody Die Brady Family (1995). She has continued in this lighter vein of late, guiding the one-man promotion machine Howard Stern to a surprisingly entertaining critical hit with Private Parts (1997), which was based on his memoirs, the Jennifer Love Hewitt film Ich kann's kaum erwarten (1998), I Spy (2002), an updated remake of the 1960s TV series, and Wie überleben wir Weihnachten? (2004). In recent years she has directed TV movies and episodes of such series as \"Audrey\" and \"Grace and Frankie.\"\n\nHailing from an English theatrical family, Christina Pickles is a beloved stage-trained actress who has enjoyed a rich and varied career that has allowed her to show her incredible range and great depth of character in her performances. She sets the bar for all at an entirely new height with this year's \"Outstanding Actress, Short Form, Comedy or Drama, Short Form\" for her critically lauded performance in \"Break a Hip\" earning a remarkable seventh Emmy nomination for a superior performance. Earlier, Christina earned an Emmy nod for her hilarious role on \"Friends\" as 'Ross' and 'Monica Geller's' mom adding to five nominations for her historic role on precedent-setting \"St. Elsewhere.\"\n\nProbably best known for her portrayal of \"Nurse Helen Rosenthal\" on the NBC hit hospital drama \"St. Elsewhere\" and \"Judy Geller,\" the dysfunctional mother of Monica (Courtney Cox) and Ross (David Schwimmer), on the NBC smash comedy hit \"Friends,\" Christina was Emmy-nominated five times for \"St. Elsewhere\" and once for her indelible role on \"Friends.\"\n\nChristina just added her seventh Emmy nomination this summer for her hilarious and touching performance as \"Biz\" in the short-form comedy series \"Break A Hip.\" Guest stars and riveting performances surround her indelible character including those from Oscar winners Allison Janey, Octavia Spencer and Jim Rash as well as a laugh-out-loud turn from Peri Giipin. It was Christina five years ago that learned about the infectious storyline of \"Break A Hip\" and its protagonist, 'Biz,' insisting producer/director Cameron Watson turn this into the Short Form hit series you see today. It's the best in its space at a time when all of us are living longer and know a 'Biz' in our lives.\n\nChristina trained at The Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London before moving to New York where she was a member of The APA Repertory Company and enjoyed a luminous career starring on and Off-Broadway. After moving to Los Angeles for \"St. Elsewhere,\" she worked consistently in film and television establishing herself as a versatile actress able to perform both comedy and drama deftly. Film credits include \"The Wedding Singer,\" Baz Luhrmann's \"Romeo + Juliet,\" \"Grace of My Heart,\" and \"Legends of the Fall.\" As a voice-over artist, Christina can be heard in classic episodes of \"The Family Guy\" and as the spokesperson for Pavilions supermarket.\n\nKim Delaney was born on November 29, 1958, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and was raised in Roxborough. She is the daughter of Joan and Jack Delaney, who retired from Delphi Automotive, where he served as a committeeman for the United Auto Workers. She has four brothers: Ed Delaney and John Delaney, who are older than her, and Keith and Patrick Delaney, who are younger. As a cheerleader at John W. Hallahan Catholic Girls High School in Philadelphia, she dreamed of being a court reporter and settling close to home. Kim began her modeling career working for the Elite agency while still in high school. After graduation, Kim continued to model in Philadelphia and then headed for New York City, quickly winning commercials. She studied acting in New York with William Esper. She auditioned for Der Denver-Clan (1981) and Dallas (1978) , but lost out. When she auditioned for All My Children (1970), however, she got the part of Jenny Gardner, and in August 1981 her acting career took off. In the spring of 1983, she made her busy schedule even busier by performing in an off-Broadway play directed by Dorothy Lyman. She has been nominated for many acting awards, winning an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for playing Diane Russell on New York Cops: NYPD Blue (1993). She has continued to star in both television and theater, as well as in films such as Rules of Engagement (1997) and Mission to Mars (2000). Kim Delaney lives in Los Angeles, California.\n\nEntrancing Leigh Taylor-Young was born on January 25, 1945, in Washington, D,C,. to a diplomat father and raised in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, the older sister of future actress Dey Young and writer/director Lance Young. She studied classical ballet and, following high school, attended Northwestern University where she initially majored in economics. She switched gears after developing an interest in theater, however, and studied under drama teacher Alvina Krause, and would apprentice as the youngest member of the Eaglesmere Summer Repertory Theatre.\n\nLeigh eventually moved to New York with designs on a professional career and studied under acting guru Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse. Her major break came when she was cast in the already firmly established primetime TV soap Peyton Place (1964). She played the mysterious Rachael Welles, whose character was brought in to provide clues to the disappearance of Allison MacKenzie (played by Mia Farrow who shocked ardent viewers by abruptly leaving the series). A mysterious girl herself, Leigh proved to be a fetching figure with her slightly off-kiltered beauty and unsympathetic countenance.\n\nLike Farrow, Leigh developed a bit of bad publicity when she too walked off the weekly series after only one season. She also fell into the arms of the very popular -- and very married -- series star Ryan O'Neal. The couple would marry in February 1967 following his divorce from actress Joanna Moore. By then, Leigh was already pregnant with their child Patrick O'Neal, who would later become an actor before turning to sportscasting.\n\nLeigh started off in films auspiciously as a \"flower child\" of the psychedelic late 1960s. She earned a Golden Globe nomination for \"Best Newcomer,\" when she played opposite Peter Sellers, in the eccentric comedy, Lass mich küssen deinen Schmetterling (1968), but then appeared opposite her husband in Nancy, ein eiskaltes Playgirl (1969), a kinky misfire. She went on to appear in a cameo in her husband's British-made movie, The Games (1970), but her career sputtered again with a series of misguided features, including the star-heavy epic, Die letzten Abenteurer (1970); another kinky British film, The Buttercup Chain (1970), which dealt with kissing cousins who don't quite stop at kissing; the beautifully photographed but rather hollow action-adventure Die Steppenreiter (1971) co-starring Omar Sharif; and the mild romp, Wo Gangster um die Ecke knallen (1971) which is best remembered for starting Robert De Niro off and running in films. Arguably, Leigh's best remembered role during that period came alongside Charlton Heston in the controversial film ...Jahr 2022... die überleben wollen... (1973), although she was a bit overshadowed by the grisly topic material and showier performances of co-stars Heston and Edward G. Robinson.\n\nFollowing her separation from O'Neal in 1971 (they didn't divorce until 1974), the actress made herself somewhat scarce while raising her young son. In 1978, she married agent/director Guy McElwaine, but that marriage would also end in divorce. In the 1980s, she made a comeback of sorts as a mature -- but still spicy -- presence. Taking a backseat to Albert Finney in the film thriller Kein Mord von der Stange (1981) and to Glenn Close and Jeff Bridges in the whodunnit Das Messer (1985), she found her best results back on TV.\n\nLeigh would nab a supporting Emmy award in 1994 for her portrayal of vixen Rachel Harris on the acclaimed drama series Picket Fences: Tatort Gartenzaun (1992). In addition, she performed in several plays, in the US, England and Scotland, including \"The Beckett Plays\", \"Knives\" and \"Sleeping Dogs\". More recently, she appeared in her writer/director brother Lance Young's film Bliss - Im Augenblick der Lust (1997). Leigh also would play a regular role on the daytime soap, Passions (1999) as wealthy Katherine Crane.\n\nA few movie roles have come her way into the millennium, including the film comedy Slackers (2002); a cameo role (as Mrs. Leigh Taylor Young) in then-husband Craig Sheffer's film Das Ritual - Im Bann des Bösen (2002); the comedy crimer Klepto (2003); the comedy A-List (2006); as a psychiatrist in the sci-fi adventure Spiritual Warriors (2007) and, more recently, the drama The Wayshower (2011).\n\nFinding a fulfilling life off-camera, Leigh became an ordained minister in the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness, and her voice can be heard in the Search of Serenity series of audio meditations from The Course in Miracles trainings. She is also a grandmother of two granddaughters from son Patrick's affair with the older Rebecca De Mornay.\n\nBlue-eyed, red-haired American character actress, often seen as resolute, strong-willed women. Though born in Kansas, Barbara Babcock spent much of her early childhood in Japan, where her father, U.S. Army Major General Conrad Stanton Babcock Jr., was posted (he was also a noted equestrian, who competed at the 1936 Summer Olympics). Her mother was Chilean-born Jadwiga Florence Noskowiak (1903-2000), a former stage actress and singer.\n\nBabcock attended universities in Lausanne and Milan and later graduated from Wellesley College in Massachusetts. She initially interviewed for a job with the State Department, aiming at a diplomatic career. When this fell through, she turned to acting, debuting on screen in 1956. From the early 60s, Babcock made guest appearances in numerous television series. She ultimately became best known for her Emmy Award-winning performance as the over-amorous Grace Gardner in NBC's Polizeirevier Hill Street (1981) and as pioneer newspaper editor Dorothy Jennings in Dr. Quinn - Ärztin aus Leidenschaft (1993) (a regular role, lasting from 1993 to 1998).\n\nBabcock featured several times on Raumschiff Enterprise (1966), though it was more often her voice that was utilized for assorted alien background characters. She also played a member of the 'underground' in episodes of Ein Käfig voller Helden (1965) and Pam Ewing's fashion boss in Dallas (1978). Babcock was one of the leads in Alan Alda's sitcom The Four Seasons (1984), about four middle-aged couples who vacation together four times annually, once per season. In this, she played the orthopedist wife of Allan Arbus (of M*A*S*H (1972) fame). Babcock subsequently starred in her own right as a demure attorney, counterpoint to Jerry Orbach's vociferous, seedy 'old school' gumshoe, in the short-lived CBS mystery drama Privatdetektiv Harry McGraw (1987). One might also remember her as one of the (ill-fated) residents of Brennen muß Salem (1979) and as a repeat guest star on Mannix (1967) and (alternating between murder victim and villainess of the week) in Mord ist ihr Hobby (1984).\n\nHer occasional forays to the big screen tended to be in smaller supporting roles, first up as an Apache kidnap victim in the Glenn Ford western Totem (1968). More recently in maternal roles, she portrayed an Irish immigrant, the mother of Nicole Kidman's character, in Ron Howard's big budget western In einem fernen Land (1992). Her last motion picture appearance was as the wife of test pilot and would-be-astronaut Frank Corvin (Clint Eastwood) in Space Cowboys (2000).\n\nBarbara Babcock retired from acting in 2004, the year she was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. In her private life, she has had a lifelong interest in travel and exploration and has dabbled in writing. She is known as an avid crusader for animal rights.\n\nBarbara Bosson, who earned an Emmy Award nomination for her performance on Murder One (1995), was raised in Belle Vernon, Pennsylvania, a small coal-mining town about 30 miles south of Pittsburgh. When she was a teenager, she and her family moved to Florida, where she attended Boca Ciega High School in Gulfport. After graduation, she was accepted into the Drama Department of Carnegie Tech in Pittsburgh (now Carnegie Mellon). When Bosson learned the tuition would be too great a burden on her parents, she instead moved to New York. She supported herself in a variety of jobs -- secretary, television production assistant, Playboy Bunny, etc. -- while studying acting with Milton Katselas and Herbert Berghof, and musical comedy with Word Baker. Six years later, Bosson reevaluated her prospects while working as a secretary for ACT (the American Conservatory Theater). She spoke frequently with various drama department heads, including Earl Gister, head of Carnegie Tech's Drama Department. Deciding it wasn't too late to pursue her dream, she asked Gister for an audition. He agreed. Bosson can't remember her audition, but it convinced Gister to place her in the school and to assist her in finding scholarship money. So, at 26, she became Carnegie Tech's oldest freshman. While attending Carnegie Tech, Bosson met her future husband, Steven Bochco (whom she would not marry until years later), and fellow Polizeirevier Hill Street (1981) stars Bruce Weitz and Charles Haid. On a summer break from Carnegie Tech, she landed a job in San Francisco with the improvisational group, \"The Committee\". With Gister's blessing, she stayed with the group and performed with them for three years. Bosson is a five-time Emmy Award nominee for Best Supporting Actress in a Dramatic Series for her portrayal of \"Fay Furillo\" in the Emmy Award-winning series, Polizeirevier Hill Street (1981). An innovative cook, Bosson raises her own herbs and vegetables. She enjoys skiing, doing crossword puzzles and dancing. Bosson also hates dieting, which she has done unsuccessfully for 25 years. Bosson and Steven Bochco have two children and reside in Los Angeles."
