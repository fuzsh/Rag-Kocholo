        "text": "Have you ever watched a movie or TV show, and noticed that one of the actors is in a similar role before, in a reversal type role from a similar show or movie, or is linked to other works by fellow cast members?\n\nHere are some examples I have noticed:\n\nKirsten Dunst played the daughter to Tom Hanks' character in the 1990 movie Bonfire of the Vanities, then in 2001 Dunst and Colin Hanks (Tom's real life son) played the roles of sister and brother in the forgotten teen comedy Get Over It.\n\nEnglish actor David Warner has appeared in two Titanic movies - SOS Titanic in 1979, and Titanic in 1997. His 1979 character survived, but he was not so lucky in 1997.\n\nGeoffrey Rush won an Oscar for his portrayal of a musical prodigy who had an overbearing father in the 1996 movie Shine, but in the 2003 Australian movie Swimming Upstream Rush played an overbearing, abusive father.\n\nBrittany Snow has twice appeared in works about TV Dance shows in the early 1960s. These were the TV show American Dreams, where Snow played a nice girl who got a chance to be a dancer on the Philadelphia TV Show American Bandstand; and the 2007 musical Hairspray, where she played a diva far removed from her earlier character.\n\nCanadian actress Cobie Smulders is best known for her role of Robin in sitcom How I Met Your Mother, a show which had a much maligned ending when it was revealed that Ted's wife Tracy was dead all along, and he was still in love with Robin, Ted's past flame who while a nice person was shown not to be right for him and who had changed little throughout the show. During the time HIMYM was on the air, Smulders had a major role in the movie Safe Haven in 2011, an unsuccessful adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks novel. Smulders' role was as Jo, the friendly neighbor of Katie (played by Julianne Hough) a newcomer in town who falls for a local widower Alex (played by Josh Dhumel). At the end of the movie, a twist shows that Jo is dead all along and has been appearing to Katie as a ghost - she was Alex's late wife, who is helping Katie find love again with her widowed husband. This movie ending was heavily criticized, but is kind of eerie considering HIMYM turned out.\n\nA complicated casting web links together the movies 17 Again, George of the Jungle and George of the Jungle 2 with sitcoms Two & A Half Men and Friends. In 17 Again, actress Lesley Mann and Matthew Perry played a married couple, while in George of the Jungle Mann's character Ursula had parents played by John Bennett Perry (Matthew Perry's real life father) and Holland Taylor. The George of the Jungle sequel, made 6 years after the first, had few cast members return. Holland Taylor did not return, and her role was recast to Christina Pickles. George of the Jungle 2 had a new character - George Jnr who was George and Ursula's son - and portrayed by young actor Angus T Jones best known for playing Jake in Two & A Half Men, where his grandmother was played by none other than Holland Taylor. And to round things out, Christina Pickles played the recurring role of Judy Gellar in Friends, and Matthew Perry the role of Chandler, who became her son-in-law when he married Monica.\n\nDoes anyone have any more examples like these?"
