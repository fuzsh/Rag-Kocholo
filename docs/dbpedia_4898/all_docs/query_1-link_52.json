Read on for those, but know that an honorable mention goes to “The One Where Chandler Crosses the Line” (Season 4, Episode 7) for its cut-for-time C-story about Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) eating by herself in a restaurant. That was a bold move for a character like her, and it’s unfortunate it only sees the light of day on the original season box set of DVDs Warner Bros. released in late 2001."
