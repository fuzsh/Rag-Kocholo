        "text": "The St. Elsewhere cast graced television screens from 1982 to 1988 and was one of the first groundbreaking medical dramas on television. It drew a loyal audience in part because of its intricate storytelling and compelling characters.\n\nThe setting of the show was St. Eligius Hospital, a decaying urban teaching hospital in Boston. The series lasted for 137 episodes and was instantly a fan favorite. It was nominated for over 60 Emmy awards over the six seasons.\n\nThe show celebrated its 40th Anniversary in 2022. Howie Mandel, one of the stars of the show, said he strongly felt like he was a part of television history. “I have no idea what I was doing when I was doing it,\" Mandel told People. \"But when you think back and look at it from that perspective, the kids that I was playing with, including Denzel Washington, went on to much bigger and amazing things. I'm a part of television history, which makes me thrilled to be a small part.\"\n\nHere, a look back at the St. Elsewhere cast and where the medical staff from St. Eligius Hospital are today.\n\nDenzel Washington as Dr. Philip Chandler\n\nWashington rose to fame and got his start as Dr. Philip Chandler on St. Elsewhere. He was on the show all six seasons from 1982-1988.\n\nAfter the series, Washington went on to star in a variety of films including Glory (1989), Malcolm X (1992), The Hurricane (1999), Remember the Titans (2000), Training Day (2001), American Gangster (2007) and Flight (2012).\n\nWashington has long since been recognized for his acting chops. He was nominated for nine Academy Awards and won twice—for Best Supporting Actor in Glory and Best Actor in Training Day.\n\nHe also has appeared on stage throughout his career. His performance in Broadway's Fences won him a Tony Award in 2010.\n\nBeyond acting, Washington was named a Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient (2022). He is married to Pauletta Washington and has four kids.\n\nDid you know? Denzel Washington was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Pennsylvania in 2011.\n\nHowie Mandel as Dr. Wayne Fiscus\n\nHowie Mandel, known for his comedic talents, took on the role of Dr. Wayne Fiscus in St. Elsewhere. Before the medical drama, Mandel had established himself as a stand-up comedian. In terms of films, he was best known for the 1981 comedy Gas.\n\nBeing a part of the St. Elsewhere cast almost didn’t happen. Originally Mandel was not picked for the show. He told People, \"They had done the pilot and a few other episodes and then they made a casting change. I replaced the guy by the name of David Paymer who went on to get nominated for an Academy Award for Mr. Saturday Night. So he did fine,\" Mandel explains. \"But I'm lucky, and I came in at the last minute and auditioned. I don't think they knew me, knew what I did. I think had they, they probably wouldn't have cast me. But I'm glad about the breadth that I've been able to experience in my career.\"\n\nAfter, the show, Mandel continued to excel in comedy, achieving widespread fame as the host of Deal or No Deal. He also became a judge on America's Got Talent and voiced the character of Bobby Generic in the animated series Bobby's World.\n\nPersonally, Mandel has been open about living with severe anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) for nearly his entire life. He told People, “I'm living in a nightmare. I try to anchor myself. I have a beautiful family and I love what I do. But at the same time, I can fall into a dark depression I can't get out of.”\n\nHe credits his wife (Terry, who he has been married to since 1980) and kids (he has a son and two daughters) for helping him get through. He says the pandemic was especially triggering for his mental health, but has found coping skills in finding humor to get through the tough times.\n\nDid you know: Mandel is still good friends with St. Elsewhere costars Ed Begley Jr.\n\nEd Begley Jr. as Dr. Victor Ehrlich in the St. Elsewhere cast\n\nBegley was born in 1949 in Los Angeles, California and is best known for his role as Dr. Victor Ehrlich on St. Elsewhere (1982).

His home is solar powered and he primarily uses his bike and public transportation to get around. He also produces and sells an all-natural household cleaning product called Begley's Best.\n\nHe’s been married to Rachelle Carson-Begley since August 23, 2000 and they have one child.
