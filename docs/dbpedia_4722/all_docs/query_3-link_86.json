        "text": "Mayor of Moscow 21 June 2023 12:39\n\nMoscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin and Russian President Vladimir Putin have opened the first regular route of electric river transport on the Moskva River. This is a unique project not only for Moscow and Russia, but also in world practice.\n\nBetween the berths \"Kievsky\" and the \"Heart of the capital\" in the area of the residential complex of the same name on the Shelepikhinskaya embankment will now run an innovative water transport all year round.\n\nThere are 8 electric vessels on the 6.5 km long route, they were named after the capital's rivers: Sinichka, Setun, Presnya, Filka, Skhodnya, Ramenka, Yauza and Neglinka. Each can accommodate up to 50 passengers, there are places for people with limited mobility.\n\nThe main elements of the vessels — including all the software — are Russian-made. Information screens and USB charging are installed in the cabin, free Wi-Fi is available, and platforms for transporting scooters and bicycles are provided.\n\nThe operator of river transport was the company \"Vodohod. Passenger Port\", with which we have signed a full life cycle contract. The company will be engaged in the supply, repair and maintenance of electric vessels and floating berths for 15 years.\n\nOn the new vessels, passengers will be able to get from Kievsky to the City without a transfer and with a beautiful view of the city in about 20 minutes.\n\nThe second regular route \"Avtozavodsky Bridge — Printers\" with a length of 13 km is planned to be launched before the end of the year.\n\nAs a result, trips will become even more convenient for residents of 18 districts of the capital — this is about 1.5 million people. In addition, the use of electric vessels will improve the environmental situation in the city.\n\nIt will be possible to pay for travel in the usual ways: with a \"Wallet\" ticket of the \"Troika\" card, a \"One\" subscription for 90 and 365 days without additional charge, by bank card or by biometrics. We decided to make travel free until June 23 inclusive.\n\nPlease note that this press release is based on materials provided by the company.
