        "text": "Photo by Ray Harrington on Unsplash\n\nRussian river cruise ships in 2022\n\nA cruise along Russia’s rivers and lakes provides a unique way to experience all that this magical country has to offer. In just one trip you can sail between the great cities of Russia, uncover hidden gems only accessible by boat, and get acquainted with traditional Russian culture, food and way of life. You’ll have a front-row seat of the magnificent Russian landscape and can watch the world go by, undisturbed by the hustle and bustle of the city. What are the different ships you can travel on during your Russian river cruise, and what can you expect on board?\n\nPhoto by Tsarev A on Wikimediа\n\n3-star ships\n\nGeorgy Chicherin\n\nThe 3-star Georgy Chicherin cruise liner was constructed in Germany and completely renovated in 2012 to a deluxe 3-star liner standard. It was named after the Marxist revolutionary and Soviet politician Georgy Chicherin – a distant relative of Alexander Pushkin, who served as the first foreign minister of the Soviet Union.\n\nPassengers can enjoy their free time aboard the Georgy Chicherin in the Volga restaurant, Neva restaurant-bar, Ladoga bar, Panorama music lounge, and coffee shop; visit the open sun deck with its sun-loungers, tables and chairs, or the sauna on the lower deck; and browse the souvenir shop. The ship is also equipped with ironing/laundry facilities and a medical center.\n\nUp to 280 passengers can sail aboard the Georgy Chicherin liner, staying in four classes of cabins which are arranged over four decks. Each cabin is equipped with heating and ventilation, a refrigerator, wardrobe, mirror, 220 V electrical socket, and private shower and toilet facilities.\n\nSingle: a cabin with one single bed, around 7 square meters in size. The cabin is equipped with a large, opening window. Single cabins are located on the Boat Deck (4th floor).\n\nTwin: a cabin which measures approximately 11 square meters. It has two single-tier twin beds, one of which can fold away allowing the cabin to be single occupancy, and an opening window. Twin cabins are on the Boat, Middle and Main Decks (2nd, 3rd and 4th floor).\n\nQuad: a four-bed cabin with two sets of bunk beds. The upper beds can be folded away and the cabin can accommodate 2, 3 or 4 passengers. The room is 13 square meters in size and equipped with two non-opening portholes and small table and chairs. Quads are located on the Lower Deck (1st floor).\n\nSuite: a two-room cabin ideal for a luxury getaway, which can sleep up to 3 guests.
