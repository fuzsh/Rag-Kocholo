        "text": "Russian river cruise operator Vodohod partnered with CLIA to build brand popularity across Europe.\n\nThe new partnership brings Vodohod into the wider community of cruise lines, travel agents, and executive partners of CLIA Europe.\n\nAccording to Andy Harmer (CLIA UK and Ireland's Director), the addition of Vodohod's Russian River Cruises was \"a sign of long-term consumer confidence and resilience in the cruise industry.\"\n\nHarmer said they were thrilled to have Vodohod join CLIA and looked forward to working with them closely. He added that over recent months, the river cruise sector had been slowly starting up again, as ships gradually resumed sailings.\n\n“The recent addition of Vodohod to CLIA bears testament to the continued desire for travellers to cruise and their confidence that the industry will always have the health and safety of passengers and crew as the number one priority.”\n\nAccording to Rishat Bagautdinov (CEO of the Moscow-based Vodohod), the brand was delighted to join CLIA and they looked forward to contributing to CLIA’s important work in advocating for their industry.\n\nJohn Warner, Vodohod UK-based Managing Director added that the immense Russian waterways and Vodohod as a brand largely remained a secret to the international river cruise traveler and they hoped by partnering with CLIA they could \"demystify Russia as a destination and help educate the industry about the benefits of Russian river cruising with Vodohod.”"
