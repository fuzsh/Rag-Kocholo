        "text": "October 2, 2020: a four-decker entered Taganrog harbour for the first time in post-Soviet history. The steam-ship, named after Bashkir Soviet poet, writer, playwright Mustai Karim (1919-2005), is a brand new liner. It was built by Vodohod, a Russian cruise company, at Krasnoye Sormovo Shipyard (Nizhny Novgorod), and was launched on September 11, 2019. \"Mustai Karim\" is able to travel at speeds of up to 12-13 knots. The ship's dimensions are: 141 m (length), 16,82 m (width); draught is 3 m, seating capacity is 329 seats.\n\n\"Mustai Karim\" at berth in the port of Taganrog (Taganrog VIC)\n\n\"Mustai Karim\" arrived in Taganrog within the framework of the first of three one-week cruises around the Black Sea and Azov Sea. Other scheduled stops are in Rostov-on-Don, Yeisk, Novorossiysk, Abrau-Dyurso, Temryuk. Locally Taganrog Visitor Information Center has provided tourists with board and lodging, as well as excursion programs. Notably, \"Mustai Karim\"'s tourist groups have visited the Taganrog Museum of Architecture and Urbanism, Birth House of Anton Chekhov and Chekhov Gymnasium.\n\nTaganrog Visitor Information Center's team (Taganrog VIC)\n\n\"This sea cruise will go down in history. Clearly, voyages around Azov-Donetsk area are able to set the pace for tourism development in Rostov Oblast. The level of tourist interest towards the Don region is traditionally high\", noted Viktor Vovk, Deputy Governor of Rostov Oblast.\n\nAccording to the plan announced this summer, the second and third cruises are scheduled for October 2-8 and October 9-15, respectively."
