        "text": "Vestnik ATOR 30 May 2023 13:19\n\nThe first electric catamaran built at the shipyards of the shipbuilding company \"Imperium\" in the Leningrad region by order of JSC \"Vodohod. Passenger Port\" will start operating in Krasnoyarsk in the first half of June 2023, Rishat Bagautdinov, General Director of Vodohod tour operator, told reporters.\n\nInitially, it was planned that the vessels with a passenger capacity of 130 would perform the first flights at the end of last season, but the start of passenger traffic was postponed.\n\nThe second similar vessel, according to Mr. Bagautdinov, is currently heading along the Volga-Baltic Canal to Nizhny Novgorod, where it should arrive on May 31. The electric catamaran will also be used for pleasure flights and events.\n\nThe third one is currently under construction and will go to work in Perm, but passenger flights are already scheduled for navigation next year.\n\nTHREE KARELIANS ARE BEING BUILT IN KRASNY SORMOVO\n\nIn addition, the head of Vodokhod reminded that the Krasnoe Sormovo shipyard has begun construction of three Karelia project motor ships for the tour operator: two have already been laid, the laying of the third will take place in early July.\n\n\"Today, shipyards have problems with the supply of imported equipment, which we have solved: we have found alternatives on the Russian market and in China,\" said Rishat Bagautdinov\n\n\"Karelia\" will receive a marine class higher than that of the newest \"Mustai Karim\". The length of the new ship will be 130 m, and the width – 13.8 m, passenger capacity – 180 people.\n\n\"Such dimensions were chosen in order to expand the geography of navigation of this vessel. We plan to go on the \"Karelia\" on the White Sea: to Kandalaksha, to the Solovetsky Islands, on the Black Sea: Sochi, Anapa, probably Tuapse. In addition, we hope to go to the Caspian Sea – we will call at the ports of the Caspian states.\n\nThe Vodohod company notes that Karelia will be even higher in terms of comfort than Mustai Karim. Most of the cabins there will be equipped with balconies, and there will be a swimming pool on the sun deck.\n\nPlease note that this press release is based on materials provided by the company.
