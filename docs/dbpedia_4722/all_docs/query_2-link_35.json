        "text": "AK&M 17 June 2021 18:49\n\nRosturizm has changed the rules of the promotion with the provision of cashback for tours in Russia in relation to certain categories of tourist products. We learned about cruises, popular destinations and prices for the autumn cashback.\n\nCASHBACK FOR RIVER AND RAIL CRUISES WILL START IN SEPTEMBER\n\nRecall that, according to the previously published rules, the fourth stage of the cashback began on June 16, 2021 (sales will last until July 31 inclusive), and you can go on a trip from October 1 and return until December 24 inclusive.\n\nHowever, on the day of the launch of the campaign, on June 16, Rosturizm and NSPK changed the conditions for sea, river and railway cruises – for them, the terms of arrivals, for which the 20% cashback rule begins to apply, are now shifted to September 1. Thus, tourists will be able to use the cashback a month earlier.\n\nThe companies affected by this decision received it positively, especially cruise tour operators.\n\n\"River cruises traditionally have a short season, so the October wave of cashback has hardly affected us or our tourists,\" Svetlana Goncharova, Deputy Director for Tourism of the cruise operator Mosturflot, told Vestnik ATOR.\n\nShe stressed that a special approach is very important for the cruise business now in the situation of loss of the external market and the resulting imbalance of supply and demand. Moreover, the industry was among the most affected by the pandemic, but did not receive appropriate assistance.\n\n\"For us, it would not even be superfluous to extend the cashback for the summer period, since today literally every empty cabin on the liner is an irreparable loss,\" the expert is sure.\n\nOPERATORS ARE WAITING FOR AN INCREASE IN THE DEPTH OF SALES\n\nFirst of all, the September cashback is expected to significantly increase the depth of sales.\n\nNow, according to experts of Mosturflot, September flights are loaded by no more than 20%, because in the conditions of the pandemic, many tourists simply do not dare to book something long before departure.\n\nNevertheless, according to the results of the already completed third wave of cashback (purchases from March 18 to June 15, 2021), about 80% of all cruise sales in June were held on the Mir card, i.e. the introduced refund measures really had a good effect on summer demand.\n\nIn the most optimistic scenario for the development of the fourth wave, cruise companies are ready to expand the range of offers and even extend the cruise season – in Mosturflot, for example, the last flight will end on October 3, but the schedule may be changed.\n\nA decision on this may be made in the near future – according to experts, the sale of cashback tours in the summer period will allow you to quickly make changes to the autumn travel.\n\nTHANKS TO THE CASHBACK, MANY TOURISTS CAN DECIDE ON A SECOND TRIP\n\nThe range of offers for September cruises is almost identical to the summer period. Flights to the most popular destinations from Moscow to St. Petersburg, Kazan and Astrakhan will continue to operate, and the Vodohod shipping company, which will complete navigation in early November, will also add sea cruises on the Mustai Karim.\n\nExperts predict good demand, and first of all for the luxury segment, which at the beginning of navigation accounted for at least 40% of all sales. The companies expect that the increased demand for cashback cruises will also be for those ships that have been operating on the market for a long time and have their own regular tourists. It is possible that many of these customers, thanks to the cashback, will decide on a second trip in September.\n\nHOW MUCH DO CRUISES DEPARTING IN SEPTEMBER COST?\n\nIn Mosturflot, a full package with meals and excursions starts from 4 thousand rubles per day per person on a low-cost airline (if only accommodation-from 2.7 thousand rubles per day). On a premium class ship, also from 4 thousand rubles per day per person and from 5,5 thousand rubles per person per day on a luxury. Vintage motor ships offer a full tour package from 3.6 thousand rubles per person per day.\n\nIn Vodohod, according to the website, a trip in September also starts on average from 4-5 thousand rubles per person per day, a sea trip on the Mustai Karim - from 12 thousand rubles per day per person, and the Yenisei expedition on the Maxim Gorky-from 40 thousand rubles per person per day.\n\nRecall, according to the rules of the promotion, from these prices, you can get a refund to the card in the amount of 20% of the purchase amount, but not more than 20 thousand rubles. for one transaction (you need to make a purchase only online and only on the Mir card). The number of purchases per card is unlimited.\n\nPlease note that this press release is based on materials provided by the company.
