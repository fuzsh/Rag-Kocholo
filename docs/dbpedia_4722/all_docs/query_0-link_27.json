Voyages will feature a newly chartered...\n\nJuly 27, 2020\n\nCruise Industry\n\nshow more news\n\nMS Nizhny Novgorod Wiki\n\nBuilt as Sovetskaya Rossiya, MS Nizhny Novgorod is one of Russia's signature \"Project 301\" river cruise ships.\n\nVladimir Ilyich-class Russian river ships\n\n\"Vladimir Ilyich class\" (aka \"Project 301\") are 3 series of Russian river cruise ships built in GDR (Germany) for USSR (Soviet Union) in the period 1974-1983. The vessel class name honours Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov (1870-1924) who is considered the founder of USSR (Soviet Union).\n\nThese Russian river cruise ships (a total of 22 units) were all produced by VEB Elbewerft Boizenburg as one of the industry's most successful riverboat designs. These ships were used for passenger (cruise) shipping in Northwestern USSR - in the rivers Volga, Belomorkanal, Lake Onega, Volga–Don Canal, Kama and Amur rivers as well as on Dnieper River (Ukraine ) and in the Black Sea. Following the USSR's collapse (1991), all these boats were acquired by private companies (Russian and foreign).\n\n\"Project 301\" ship technology\n\nAll \"Project 301\" ships have the following details:\n\nLOA length 125 m (410 ft),\n\nwidth 17 m (55 ft)\n\nDWT tonnage 3063 tons\n\nV-shaped hulls - differ by series as external elements, window shape (rectangular or rounded), wheelhouse headlights\n\n5 decks\n\nEach boat has capacity 240 passengers and 110 crew, 102 cabins (all outside), 2 restaurants, 2 bar lounges, Sauna Room, Souvenir Shop, Lobby (Reception Desk with safe), 360-degree Promenade Deck (with outdoor seating).\n\nPowerplant includes three marine diesel engines \"Viertakt-Dieselmotor \" (4-stroke, model 6ЧРН 36/45 / aka ЭГ70-5) each with a turbocharger.\n\nThe 3rd (last) series motor ships are with stronger propulsion (bow thrusters).\n\nStaterooms are single and double (originally 1-2-3-bed cabins), all fitted with en-suite bathrooms.\n\nAfter reconstruction, to the ships were introduced larger cabins (including suites).\n\nDepending on series, boats differ in terms of size and equipment (different diesel engine designs). Many of these Russian ships were completely refurbished and rebuilt for foreign river cruise companies (like Viking, AMAwaterways, Grand Circle). During their multi-million-dollar drydock refits, the vessel's passenger capacity was considerably reduced to improve travel comfort and safety.\n\nProject 301 ships\n\nFrom Project 301's first series are the boats\n\nVladimir Ilyich (1975, now Sankt Peterburg / Санкт-Петербург)\n\nMariya Ulyanova (1975, now Viking Rurik)\n\nYevgeniy Vuchetich (1976, now Dnieper Princess)\n\nSovetskaya Ukraina (1976, now Konstantin Korotkov)\n\nTikhiy Don (1977, Тихий Дон)\n\nXXV Syezd KPSS (1977, now Petr Chaykovskiy)\n\nFrom Project 301's second series are the boats\n\nSovetskaya Rossiya (1977, now Nizhny Novgorod / Нижний Новгород)\n\n60 let Oktyabrya (1978, scrapped as Avicena)\n\nRossiya (1978, Россия)\n\nVladimir Mayakovskiy (1978, Владимир Маяковский)\n\nLenin (1979, now Mikhail Bulgakov / Михаил Булгаков)\n\nAleksandr Ulyanov (1979, now Kronstadt / Кронштадт)\n\nMikhail Lomonosov (1979, now Viking Sineus)\n\nKonstantin Fedin (1980, Константин Федин)\n\n30 let GDR (1980, scrapped as Ferris Flotel)\n\nVissarion Belinskiy (1980, Виссарион Белинский)\n\nFrom Project 301's third (last) series are the riverboats\n\nSovetskaya Konstitutsiya (1981, now Nikolay Karamzin / Николай Карамзин)\n\nNikolay Chernyshevsky (1981, Николай Чернышевский)\n\nNikolay Dobrolyubov (1981, now Andrey Rublev / Андрей Рублев)\n\nAleksandr Radishchev (1982, Александр Радищев)\n\nAleksandr Griboyedov (1982, now Knyazhna Viktoria / Княжна Виктория)\n\nFedor Dostoevskiy (1983, Федор Достоевский)\n\nShare with friends\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nRSS"
