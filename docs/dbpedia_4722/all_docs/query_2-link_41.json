        "text": "The 2022-built MS Pyotr Velikiy cruise ship (\"теплоход Пётр Великий\" круизный корабль) is a Russian passenger ship owned by the private Russian shipping company Mosturflot (\"Мостурфлот\") and operated under charter by Russia's largest cruise company VODOHOD (\"Водоход\"). The 6-deck newbuilds (sisterships Pyotr Velikiy and Mustai Karim/Мyстай Карим) were both designed and constructed in Russia. The vessel was scheduled for launch in May 2020. This new-design Russian riverboat (Project PV300LMPP-110, sea-and-river vessel) is currently under construction at Lotos Shipyard in Narimanov (Astrakhan Russia).\n\nThe cruise vessel is named after Pyotr Velikiy (Peter the Great, or Peter I / 1672-1725). He was the ruler of the Russian Empire in the period 1682-1725. After winning the Great Northern War with Sweden (1700-1721) and several battles with the Ottoman Empire, he greatly expanded Russia to the north, west and south and gained access to the waterways of Baltic Sea, Black Sea and Caspian Sea. Peter I founded St Petersburg, which served as Russia's capital city in the period 1703-1917.\n\nVODOHOD's cruise ship \"Project PV300LMPP-110\"\n\nAt the end of 2016, VODOHOD (Russia's largest passenger shipping company) signed a contract with the Russian shipbuilder USC (United Shipbuilding Corporation) for the construction of one PV300 unit. The shipbuilding contractor was the USC's subsidiary PJSC \"Krasnoe Sormovo\". The newbuild was planned to be ready for 2020's Volga River navigation season. The cost of the contract was ~RUB 3,2 billion (USD 57 million).\n\nVODOHOD's new cruise ship project partly resembles the PV300 project, which was modified to meet the company's updated standards for commercial shipping efficiency. The full name of this ship design is PV300LMPP-110. The cruiser Pyotr Velikiy was planned for navigation on Volga River (between homeports Moscow and Saint Petersburg during summer, for up to 5-6 months) and for sea cruises (during winter) in Caspian Sea, Azov Sea and Black Sea.\n\nDecks and Cabins\n\nVODOHOD increased the ship's passenger capacity from 300 to 342. The boat has 6 decks and a total of 169 staterooms, including 2 Suites, 2 Owner Suites, 2 Junior Suites, 159 Deluxe (Twin Comfort) and 4 Standard Twin cabins. All staterooms are outside (no interior cabins) and with floor-ceiling windows.

With the event officially started ship's construction at Lotos Shipyard (in Narimanov) near Astrakhan Russia. The shipbuilding plant is fully-owned by USC (United Shipbuilding Corporation). The vessel was launched (floated-out from drydock/building hall) on May 24, 2019.\n\nInitially planned for inauguration in 2019, in early-June 2019 was announced that due to construction issues ship's delivery will be delayed by ~9 months (re-scheduled for June 2020).\n\nOne of the reasons for the delay was the choice of ship's powerplant. The vessel was designed for Wartsila marine diesel engines. However, at the tender, Ruselprom (one of Russia's largest manufacturers and suppliers of electrical machines and drives) was selected to supply the diesel-electric generator (fitted with one Wartsila engine). Then Wartsila refused to supply the engine and Ruselprom chose as replacement two Japan-made diesel engines (total power output 2,4 MW) manufactured by Yanmar Co Ltd (1912-founded company based in Osaka, Japan). The engine change led to redesigning of the entire PV300VD project as the Yanmar engine was designed differently and had too much heat dissipation (which affected the neighboring crew areas).\n\nIn August 2016, the companies Mosturflot (Moscow River Shipping Company), Lotos Shipyard and Mashpromleasing signed a 3-party contract for building and delivery of one Project PV300VD unit. Under a similar agreement, at Krasnoye Sormovo Shipyard (also part of USC) on March 28, 2017, started the construction of the sistership Mustai Karim, with scheduled delivery in February 2020.\n\nThe PV300 shipbuilding project (management firm MNP Group) stated that these ships can be operated in waterways with waves up to 3 m (10 ft) high, which allows them to operate on Russia's largest inland waterways (rivers and large lakes, like Volga, Neva, Don, Onega, Ladoga), as well as on.Black, Azov and Caspian seas.\n\nDesigned by Marine Engineering Bureau, the liner Pyotr Velikiy is the first (within the PV300VD project) built at Russian shipyards - followed by Mustai Karim. With optional 5 more such units, with the PV300 ships, VODOHOD targets both Russian and foreign customers who consider river cruises in Russia among the best value-for-money European travel vacation alternatives. These premium leisure ships feature modern design and implement the latest marine technologies developed for passenger ships. They also provide top-luxury hotel amenities, the highest level of comfort and superior services (both onboard and ashore).\n\nOn August 13, 2019, the cruise liner Mustai Karim was moved out of shipyard's building hall after all the hull works were completed. Followed the launch (float-out from drydock) and sea trials.\n\nRussian cruise ship Project PV300VD\n\nIn mid-August 2016, the \"Lotos\" plant in Astrakhan started the construction of the first Russia-made cruise liner for the past 60 years. Lotos Shipyard plans to construct 2 more same-design (PV300VD) vessels.\n\nBoth sisterships Pyotr Velikiy and Mustai Karim have maritime class \"river-sea\" (река-море) and ranked 5-stars (as level of luxury and comfort). The RSCM (River Shipping Company of Moscow) and affiliated company Mosturflot took part in the development of the vessel's technical plan. \"Mosturflot\" is the first company to operate the newbuild, featuring the following main characteristics: LOA length 141 m (463 ft), max-width/beam 16,8 m (55 ft), height 16, 2 m (53 ft), max draught 3,2 m (11 ft), passenger capacity 300+, endurance 15 days (fuel) and 10 days (total supplies).\n\nThe PV300VD project was developed by Marine Engineering Bureau (Морское Инженерное Бюро in Odessa) in the period 2010-2015. The project was ordered by Russia's \"Federal Agency for Sea and Inland Water Transport\".\n\nShipbuilder Lotos\n\nLotos Shipyard was constructed in the late-80s (during the Soviet Union / USSR) and is now one of Russia's newest shipbuilding plants. The yard is located in Narimanov (town in district Narimanovsky, Astrakhan region). The company is one of region's largest and is included in the Russian Federation's register of companies which are part of its military-industrial complex.\n\nThe shipbuilder Lotos specializes in the construction of inland vessels and block modules for the Caspian Sea-deployed oil and gas platforms of CNRG (Caspian Energy Group). The Lotos plant manufactures annually ~17000 tons of steel structures and has as facilities and equipment steel warehouse fitted with 32-ton cranes, plasma-cutting and metal bending machines, assembly-welding lines. A total of 5 covered pre-fabrication halls (each sized 200x24 m) plus 6 covered assembly/construction halls, each fitted with 4 heavy-lift cranes (max lifting capacity 100 tons) and capacity to handle block structures with max weight 200 tons. The shipyard has an output to open slipway for vessel launching and an outfitting dock (quay length 150 m) served by an 80-ton rail-mounted portal crane.\n\nLotos Shipyard is owned by USC (JSC United Shipbuilding Corporation / Объединённая судостроительная корпорация) that specializes in shipbuilding, ship repairs and vessel maintenance (works and services). The state-owned corporation was founded in 2007 and produces commercial and naval ships, submarines, missiles. Its revenue for FY2017 was USD 5,58 billion, with total assets USD 15,1 billion.\n\nNote: You can see the CruiseMapper's list of all river cruise ships and riverboats in the \"itinerary\" section of our River Cruises hub.
