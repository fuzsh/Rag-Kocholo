        "text": "Russian river cruise tour operator Vodohod has partnered with CLIA to build brand awareness across Europe.\n\nThe partnership brings Vodohod into CLIA Europe’s wider community of cruise lines, travel agents and executive partners.\n\nCLIA UK & Ireland director Andy Harmer said the addition of Vodohod Russian River Cruises is a sign of long-term consumer confidence and resilience in the cruise industry.\n\nHarmer said: “We are thrilled to have Vodohod join CLIA and we look forward to working with them closely. Over recent months, the river cruise sector has been slowly starting up again, as ships gradually resume sailings.\n\n“The recent addition of Vodohod to CLIA bears testament to the continued desire for travellers to cruise and their confidence that the industry will always have the health and safety of passengers and crew as the number one priority.”\n\nRishat Bagautdinov, CEO of Vodohod Russian River Cruises based in Moscow, said: “Vodohod is delighted to join CLIA, the cruise industry’s leading professional association. We look forward to contributing to CLIA’s important work in advocating for our industry.”\n\nJohn Warner, Vodohod UK based Managing Director added: “The immense Russia waterways and Vodohod as a brand largely remain a secret to the international river cruise traveller. We hope by partnering with CLIA we can demystify Russia as a destination and help educate the industry about the benefits of Russian river cruising with Vodohod.”"
