        "text": "What could be more pleasant and exciting than a boat tour along the river? The Vodokhod company offers regular as well as new clients a useful and memorable vacation with an overview of the cities on the banks of the Volga, Kama, Neva and other beautiful rivers, lakes and reservoirs of Russia. From morning to evening you will find an extensive program of entertainment, the opportunity to relax comfortably in cozy cabins and add to your collection of pleasant sensations. You can visit Valaam, Karelia, Kizhi, the cities of the Golden Ring, traveling from Samara, Kazan, Moscow, St. Petersburg and Nizhny Novgorod.\n\nIn order to inexpensively buy a tour for river cruises on a ship, it is advisable to plan your vacation in advance: you can get an excellent discount.\n\nYou will find a 4-deck comfortable water transport, 3 meals a day, excursions in the parking lots and every day - new emotions from breathtaking views along the shores of Russian waters. You can choose a weekend trip or a long trip for 25 days to see as many of the most beautiful sights of our Motherland as possible. We welcome guests of all ages, and for children we have prepared special programs conducted by professional animators.\n\nYou won’t be bored while traveling, although you can always retire to your cabin or take care of your own health.\n\nOur guests never tire of sharing their impressions on the pages of the site, where you can get acquainted with the features of excursions in different cities, the wishes of tourists and the most vivid travel impressions. If you haven’t vacationed on the river yet, it’s time to buy a cruise on a ship (you can make your choice in the corresponding section of the site). If you have questions, call and Vodokhod operators will answer them in detail.\n\nThe company regularly offers discounts to customers (schoolchildren, students, pensioners) and various other promotions. The relevance can be clarified on the official website of Vodokhod; sometimes, by the way, it is mistakenly called a “vodovoz”, as is the most accurate cruise schedule. The site of the company.\n\nCruises\n\nVodokhod mainly organizes cruises and excursions along the rivers of Central Russia. On weekends there are routes from Moscow, St. Petersburg, Samara and Nizhny Novgorod.\n\nVodokhod usually conducts river cruises from Samara with only one intermediate stop - in Elabuga or Perm. The duration of such a trip will be 9 or 5 days.\n\nRiver cruises\n\nCruises to Karelia are never less than five days, and some last 22 days (from Volgograd) or 20 (from Saratov). Along the way there is always an excursion to Valaam or Kizhi, but besides this, even on the shortest routes there is always something to see. The classes of such walks are either “Comfort” or “Comfort+”.\n\nShort “weekend” sailings from Nizhny Novgorod pass through Kostroma, Makaryevo, Yaroslavl or Cheboksary. The prices are very reasonable, you can find a day when you can spend five thousand if you go alone.\n\nImportant! All current information about special offers and changes in routes is available on the shipping company’s website; Vodohod constantly updates it.\n\nService on ships\n\nRegarding service, we can say that if you board Vodokhod’s ships, you receive a service that allows you to completely relax on a boat trip. On boarding ships you can improve your health with herbal teas or wellness treatments (for a fee).\n\nTour crews on all ships offer a wide range of entertainment, games, music events and the like. This type of leisure activity is available for both children and adults.\n\nThe Vodohod motor ship provides excursions at any time of the year.\n\nThere are basic excursions, which will be included in the tour price, and there are additional ones that can be selected separately and paid for. Both types are interesting, only sometimes those who are generally not interested in the issue covered in the story come away not too happy. This is understandable, because most excursions include monasteries and temples, and this is not of interest to everyone.\n\nImportant! Although well organized in general, some excursions that involve long walks can be very disappointing due to difficult transitions. Therefore, if walking is difficult, it is better to choose those excursions where walking will be minimal.\n\nThe berths of the Vodokhod cruise company are located:\n\nIn Petersburg.\n\nIn Moscow.\n\nIn Nizhniy Novgorod.\n\nIn Kazan.\n\nIn Samara.\n\nDuring the voyage, the ships will call, depending on the route, at such ports as:\n\nYaroslavl;\n\nMyshkin;\n\nSaratov;\n\nVolgograd;\n\nPlyos;\n\nCherepovets;\n\nGoritsy;\n\nPetrozavodsk;\n\nKizhi;\n\nSortavala;\n\nKonevets;\n\nBalaam.\n\nThe motor ship went on a cruise from the river station pier\n\nA detailed schedule and summary table of all cruises with ports can be found on the Vodokhod website. In order to see all the cruises and when the closest one is of interest, you need to follow this path: “Vodohod” (official website) - Cruises (tabs with options are located directly under the “header” of the site).\n\nAbout the company's fleet\n\nThe company's operating vessels are far from all that is in the fleet. An approximate list of ships for 2018 in the form of a table (summary table of Vodokhod river cruises):\n\nMotor shipDraft, metersPassenger capacity \"Alexander Pushkin\" 2,3 186 \"Maksim Gorky\" 2,3 186 \"Georgy Zhukov\"2.9 318 \"Konstantin Simonov\"2.9 288 \"Leonid Sobolev\"2.9 284 \"Alexander Radishchev\"2.8 272 \"Felix Dzerzhinsky\"2.9 339 \"Mstislav Rostropovich\" 2,9 212 \"Georgy Chicherin\"2.9 298 \"Zosima Shashkov\"2.9 298 \"Konstantin Fedin\"2.8 256 \"Lev Tolstoy\"2.9 178 \"Lenin\"2.9 278 \"Nikolai Chernyshevsky\"2.8 228 \"Rus\"2.9 282 \"Vissarion Belinsky\"2.8 289 \"Saint Petersburg\"2.8 298 \"Yuri Andropov\"2.9 296 \"Kronstadt\"2.8 274 \"Konstantin Korotkov\"2.8 255 \"Nizhny Novgorod\"2.8 261 \"Mikhail Frunze\"2.9 328 \"Semyon Budyonny\"2.9 299 \"Alexander Suvorov\"2.9 307 \"Sergey Kuchkin\"2.9 300\n\nImportant! Information is current for 2018. Next year, some ships may remove or return a vessel.\n\nMeals on board will be either buffet type or restaurant. A buffet is usually served on Comfort ships. Those that fall into the “Comfort+” category and above try to avoid this type of nutrition. Moreover, in both cases it will be simple, but tasty and healthy food. Some provide a children's menu. Vegetarian and dietary meals will be available on every flight.\n\nIf mealtime falls during an excursion, you can always eat in the city, or the tourist will be given something to eat on the go.\n\nBuffet\n\nCabins and what's in them by default\n\nDifferent types of cabins look different on different ships. The only drink available in the cabins is water. On the Comfort ships, this is bottled water on the first day; on all other days it is renewed.\n\nIn general, typical cabins are singles, doubles with two or one tier, suites and junior suites. Not every ship has cabins for three or four people.\n\nAll suites always have upholstered furniture, refrigerators and TVs, their area is larger, and sometimes they have two rooms. Junior suites differ from them only in size.\n\nThe rest of the cabins are pretty much the same everywhere. One, two or four beds, when there are four of them there are always two tiers, a wardrobe, air conditioning and a standard bathroom with toilet and shower. Sometimes they have a balcony (this depends on the class of the ship), a TV and a refrigerator. If the cabins are on the lower decks, they have portholes instead of windows.\n\nImportant! It is best to check with a company representative about the specific cabin type before purchasing tickets. Sometimes the interior and equipment may change.\n\nTriple bunk cabin\n\nEntertainment, recreation and leisure on ships\n\nAs for entertainment, Vodokhod offers the services of a team of animators who are ready to entertain children through various programs, which include master classes, holidays and competitions, as well as adults. For adults, games, music events and dance classes are offered.\n\nIf you are not interested in entertainment programs, the ships have a reading room where you can escape all entertainment, and sometimes there are film screenings.\n\napproximate cost\n\nImportant! In terms of price, cruises are too different to name the exact cost; in addition, it changes from year to year and will be different depending on how many days the trip is for, what class of cruise, etc. The approximate price can start from five thousand and end at mark of more than sixty thousand.\n\nThe price always includes:\n\nmeals three times a day;\n\nWi-Fi (in the bar);\n\nmain excursions;\n\ncaptain's cocktail at the end of the route;\n\nbottled water in cabins on the first day.\n\nWhen it is a “Comfort+” class, there are more included services:\n\na free glass of alcoholic drink, water or juice is provided for dinner;\n\nin the cabins there are free hygiene kits of shampoo and shower gel;\n\nTV, refrigerator and hairdryer are also in every cabin, not just in suites.\n\nVodohod Company\n\nNext comes the Premium class of ships, where travel will be even more expensive, and Luxury, where the service can already be partially compared with what is available on those liners that carry passengers across the seas. In “Premium”, the hygiene kit also includes slippers with napkins, and, in addition, the passenger has access to a common table with sweets and hot drinks. Bottled water is renewed daily. The suites, in addition to all of the above, provide intra-ship communications in each cabin, and the hygiene kit additionally includes a robe and body lotion. Cabins have balconies. There is, however, only one such ship - the Mstislav Rostropovich.\n\nImportant! All other services, such as massage, if available, exercise therapy, etc., are always provided for a fee.\n\nSo, Vodokhod, a cruise liner company, is ready to offer its clients many amenities and a wide variety of ships. How the trip will go and what services will be included in the basic price depends on the selected category of vessel. But if you want to relax with full service, including a robe in a hygiene kit, you need to be prepared to fork out some money. The company regularly holds various promotions, you can always find interesting offers and discounts, but searches should be carried out on “water carrier” cruises on the official website. You can save a lot of money there by booking early."
