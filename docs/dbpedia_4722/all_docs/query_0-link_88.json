        "text": "The expedition cruise market will have another player from 2021 when Swan Hellenic returns to operation three years after going bankrupt.\n\nSwan Hellenic was purchased by G Adventures in 2017, which envisioned relaunching the brand in 2018.\n\nThe 70-year-old British cultural and expedition cruise brand will be resurrected in November 2021 under new management, launching the first of two brand-new 152-guest (76-berth) expedition ships. The second vessel will follow in April 2022. The ships were previously ordered by Russian river cruise operator, Vodohod.\n\n“I am proud to announce the rebirth of Swan Hellenic, a pioneering iconic travel brand with the mission to be the leader in cultural expedition cruising,” said Andrea Zito, CEO of Swan Hellenic.\n\n“The new Swan Hellenic retains its British heritage whilst being international in outlook. Aimed at the traveller, who wishes to explore, experience and enrich whilst the infinite beauty of the world and its inhabitants in a safe and sustainable way.”\n\nFor now the ships are working under the project names of Vega 1 and Vega 2, in homage to the first ship to sail the Northeast Passage. The five-star sister-ships will feature “elegant Scandi-chic” designs and “stylish sophisticated interiors”. Cabins will feature soft wood fittings, earthy tones and textures.\n\nOn board will be a Photography Lab, 150-seat restaurant, Club Lounge and state-of-the-art gym.\n\nSwan Hellenic’s nine-deck ships will have PC5 ice-strengthened hulls, paired with extra-large stabilisers to ensure a smooth ride. Not only will the ships operate in the Arctic, Antarctic and Russian Far East, Swan Hellenic will offer voyages in New Zealand, the Pacific (New Caledonia, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands), Micronesia and Melanesia, Papua New Guinea, the Raja Ampat, the Philippines and Japan. Australia, however, appears to be left off the current agenda.\n\nBoth vessels are designed to meet the latest environmental regulations and will feature hybrid propulsion and power generation. They will be built at the Oy shipyard in Helsinki, Finland.\n\nSwan Hellenic will be headquartered in Cyprus and will have its operations office in Monaco.\n\nRenderings credit: Swan Hellenic"
