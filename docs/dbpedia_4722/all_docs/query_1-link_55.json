It’s spectacular beauty is as unique as the huge range of fun and varied activities it has to offer. It is my distinct pleasure to share with you the magnificence of this land down under known as Aotearoa or the “Land of the Long White Cloud”.\n\n4 Day 1 & 2 Depart the USA for your flight to Los Angeles where you will embark on your international non-stop flight from Los Angeles to Auckland on Air New Zealand, ranked one of the top airlines in the world. Cross the international dateline and lose one day. This overnight non-stop flight is approximately 12 ½ hours.\n\n5 After settling in at our accommodations in Auckland, you'll have the rest of the day at leisure to relax or to enjoy the \"City of Sails\" on your own. Visit the Sky Tower, New Zealand's highest man-made structure, Kelly Tarlton's Antarctic Encounter and Underwater World, take a sail in the harbor or visit any of the other major attractions in this great city. I highly encourage you to sign up for the optional Hop-On Hop-off bus that takes you to 14 of Auckland's major points of interest. Day 3\n\n6 A truly captivating experience awaits visitors at Auckland's Sky Tower. At 1076 feet, it is the tallest man-made structure in New Zealand and offers breathtaking views for up to 50 miles in every direction. Travel up in the glass-fronted elevators to one of the three spectacular viewing platforms, or for more thrills and excitement, SkyWalk round the pergola at 630 feet up or SkyJump off the Tower! Relax with a coffee and light refreshments at Sky Lounge, enjoy a seafood feast at The Observatory Restaurant or dine at Orbit - Auckland's only 360-degree revolving restaurant. Sky Tower is one of New Zealand's most exhilarating and spectacular tourist attractions. You will be amazed at what you can see and do under one roof! Day 3\n\n7 Kelly Tarlton's Antarctic Encounter & Underwater World was the brainchild of the late Kelly Tarlton, a wreck diver, treasure hunter & visionary. Highlights includes the Antarctic Encounter, where you’ll be taken back in time to the life-sized replica hut of intrepid South Pole explorer Captain Robert Falcon Scott; Antarctic snowcat a ride where you can observe sub-Antarctic Penguins and view the birds as they swim underwater; Amazon tank to view the deadly Piranha; Stingray Bay Stingrays some 6 ½ long; Underwater World - while travelling in a clear tunnel, surrounded by ocean water and the awesome sea creatures within it, including sharks. Free shuttle picks up from the Sky City Hotel on the hour every hour, 7 days a week. Day 3\n\n8 World renowned Waitomo Glowworm Caves are a must see for any traveler. The glow worm, Arachnocampa luminosa, is unique to New Zealand. Thousands of these tiny creatures radiate their unmistakable luminescent light as expert guides provide informative commentary on the caves' historical and geological significance. Day 4 – Auckland - Waitamo - Rotorua During the world famous boat ride you will journey underground on a subterranean adventure in complete darkness with just the glowworms shining like a starry night. The hardy little glowworms are oblivious to the huge number of admirers they have been receiving over the past 100 years and they keep glowing to attract their food in the caves.\n\n9 Day 4 Rotorua Complete your adventure through Rotorua with a trip to the Tamaki Maori Village where your local guide will escort you on a cultural journey to the \"marae\" (Maori village), the life force of New Zealand's indigenous people. In this authentic Maori village nestled in the Rotorua forest, you’ll discover Maori art forms, ancient rituals and traditions, experience thrilling song and dance, and then share in a 3 course “hangi” feast with your Maori hosts. Before you indulge in your feast, you’ll see how your meal is cooked in the traditional underground pit on top of heated volcanic rocks.\n\n10 Your day begins with an optional morning sightseeing tour around 3 of Rotorua's iconic visitor attractions. Visit the cultural centre at Te Puia and gain an insight into Māori traditions and ways of life before entering a geothermal wonderland of impressive geysers and boiling mud pools. Explore Rainbow Springs, a nature park which showcases native flora and fauna including the famous New Zealand kiwi and tuatara. Then see New Zealand's agricultural industry in action with an entertaining sheep-shearing display along with sheep dog trials at the famous Agrodome. Day 5 Rotorua\n\n11 Following the sheep show you’ll have lunch on your own in Rotorua, then have the chance to experience the real Middle-Earth on the Hobbiton Movie Set Coach Tour. On the way there, you’ll enjoy a scenic drive across the Kaimai Ranges to the picturesque 1,250 acre farm near Matamata where scenes from the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit movies were filmed. The set was completely rebuilt for The Hobbit and has remained as it was seen in these films. During your tour you will see Hobbit Holes, The Green Dragon Inn, The Mill, double arched bridge and other structures and gardens built for the films. Day 5 Rotorua\n\n12 In the morning we depart Rotorua for Wellington. We arrive in Wellington in time to get cleaned up and celebrate NYE - the ideal time to visit Wellington as it is the most awaited night of the year. New Zealand is one of the first countries in the world to ring in the New Year. There will be plenty of countdown parties and endless ways to celebrate the transition to 2015. The all time hot favorites of this city are Lambton Quay and Courtenay Place. You may also try the Civic Centre, which is not far from the Lambton Quay. Here you will find a wonderful blend of live music, people partying together, counting down and welcoming the New Year 2015. It is always a very happening place to visit. Day 8 Wellington – Picton - Nelson\n\n13 We spend the entire day in Wellington, the capital of New Zealand. Situated at the southern end of the North Island, Wellington was recently named \"the coolest little capital in the world\" by Lonely Planet. Nestled between a sparkling harbor and rolling green hills, New Zealand's capital city is renowned for its arts, heritage, culture and native beauty. After the opportunity to sleep in, we take the Wellington Cable Car, one of Wellington’s oldest & most popular tourist attractions to the Wellington Botanic Gardens. The cars run from Lambton Quay in the heart of the central business district and within 5 minutes whisk you from under the corporate towers of The Terrace past Kelburn Park and Victoria University to the top entrance of the Botanic Gardens. Day 7 Wellington\n\n14 Next we visit Te Papa - New Zealand's bold and innovative national museum and a recognized world leader in interactive and visitor-focused museum experiences. New Zealand's geology and natural environment and the stories of New Zealand's indigenous people, the Māori, are celebrated in Te Papa's permanent exhibitions, while Te Papa's Marae is a vibrant contemporary meeting house and a living communal centre, unique in a museum. An exciting range of exhibitions display New Zealand's diverse art and visual culture and top-rating international exhibitions tour regularly. Te Papa also features entertainment, performances, floor talks, lectures, and more. Day 7 - Wellington\n\n15 In the mid-afternoon we join the optional Wellington Movie Tour. Take in the sights around New Zealand's movie-making capital, Wellington, and visit some of the most famous The Lord of the Rings filming locations. Walk through the Hobbiton Woods and see the 'Frodo Tree', 'Shortcut to the Mushrooms', 'Get off the Road' and 'Race to the Ferry' scenes from The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Another highlight is the one hour visit to the Weta Cave where you'll see many props and miniatures from the films and have the chance to watch an exclusive behind-the-scenes video from Weta Workshop. Day 7 - Wellington\n\n16 Day 8 Wellington – Picton - Nelson In the morning, we are transported to the ferry terminal where we take the 3 hour ride across Cooks Straight. The Interislander travels between the North and South Islands of New Zealand and has been described as \"one of the most beautiful ferry rides in the world”. With 57 miles of breathtaking views, the three- hour journey between Wellington and Picton really is one of New Zealand's most iconic tourism activities. Once you're on your Interislander journey, you can take a stroll on the decks, enjoy a meal, a drink or even catch the latest movie releases. Or just relax and take in the breathtaking view. Once we arrive in Picton, we are transported by bus to the city of Nelson.\n\n17 Situated at the top north-western part of the South Island, Nelson is the sunniest region in New Zealand. Nelson's diverse geography captures everything from the long golden beaches to untouched forests and rugged mountains. Perhaps it’s the sun, perhaps it’s the location, but Nelson, New Zealand, has long been a magnet for creative people. There are more than 350 working artists and craftspeople living in Nelson, traditional, contemporary and Maori. Visit their studios and find a unique piece to take home with you, marvel at the Christ Church Cathedral or just relax, sit in the sun, sip a wine from one of the local vineyards, and dine on the famous Nelson Bay scallops. Day 9 Nelson\n\n18 Day 9 Nelson - Abel Tasman National Park Full Day optional Cruise, Hike & Kayak through Abel Tasman National Park Cruise: Relax aboard the Abel Tasman Sea Shuttle for a full scenic cruise as far north as Totaranui. Learn about the history of the park and let the experienced skippers take you along a string of beautiful beaches. Then head south to Anchorage Bay where you disembark. Hike: Enjoying breath-taking views as you walk to Watering Cove where your kayak guide awaits you. Sea Kayak: Kayaking south, we watch for playful seals as we visit Adele Island and embrace the wonderful bird song ringing from this bush clad coastline. This paddle is great for taking it easy and exploring the nooks and crannies of this stunning coastal paradise. Then kayak to Marahau where you connect with your return transport.\n\n19 Day 10 Nelson - Punakaki - Christchurch Depart Nelson in the morning. At lunch time we make a stopover at Punakaiki, a small community on the West Coast of the South Island of New Zealand, between Westport and Greymouth,on the edge of the Paparoa National Park. After lunch we take the 20 minute hike through the Pancake Rocks via their many groomed walkways that wind around the rock formations. The Pancake Rocks are a heavily eroded limestone area where the sea bursts though a number of vertical blowholes during high tides. Together with the 'pancake'-layering of the limestone (created by immense pressure on alternating hard and soft layers of marine creatures and plant sediments), these form the main attraction of the area. Then onto Greymouth to catch the TranzAlpine Train.\n\n20 Day 10 – TranzAlpine Train Ride from Greymouth to Christchurch It's perhaps the most scenic train ride in New Zealand, and one of the most scenic train trips anywhere in the world. The TranzAlpine, run by New Zealand train operator Kiwi Rail, runs once daily between Greymouth, Arthur's Pass and Christchurch, through the amazing misty mountain scenery of the Southern Alps. The journey takes 4½ hours and you can listen to the informative commentary via headphones while taking in the stunning scenery from your comfortable seat or the viewing platform. Carriages are air conditioned and centrally heated with advanced air bag suspension system for quieter and smoother travel. They feature un-tinted, non-reflective, panoramic side and roof windows to capture the dramatic mountain views.\n\n21 Day 11 Christchurch The February 22, 2011 Christchurch 6.3 magnitude earthquake severely damaged New Zealand's second-largest city, killing 185 people and destroying 10,000 homes in one of the nation's deadliest peacetime disasters.. The total cost to insurers of rebuilding was originally estimated at NZ$15 billion. At that point it was already predicted to be by far New Zealand's costliest natural disaster, and the third-costliest earthquake (nominally) worldwide. But by April 2013, the total estimated cost had ballooned to $40 billion. Some economists have estimated it will take the NZ economy 50-100 years to completely recover. \"Be courageous! Whatever setbacks America has encountered, it has always emerged as a stronger and more prosperous nation. -Thomas Edison\n\n22 Day 11 Christchurch\n\n23 Spend the entire day at leisure in the “garden city”, the South Island’s largest and most innovative. This is thanks to a resilient and enterprising community determined to forge a bright future for the city. Intriguing shops, businesses and buildings are continually popping up as the city rebuilds. The original Christchurch Cathedral was badly damaged in the February 2011 earthquake and has been replaced by another remarkable effort by the emergency architecture guru Shigeru Ban – the Cardboard Cathedral, made substantially of cardboard! Along with Christchurch's rich history and heritage, colorful gardens and lively recreation, and you'll find plenty to entertain and inspire.\n\n24 Day 11 Christchurch After the early 2011 earthquakes left the picturesque city in ruins, Christchurch has been revamped and revived through creative innovation & sustainable modern architecture that’s put fashion and design back into the city. The signs of resilience of the Cantabarians are all there for everyone to see in the funky creations with a temporary ‘pop up ‘ twist that has sprung up like the Re:Start where shipping containers make up for a shopping precinct, a coffee shop Crafted Coffee Company or Smash Palace Bar out of two buses and a shipping container.\n\n25 Day 11 Christchurch Christchurch has a history of involvement in Antarctic exploration–both Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest Shackleton used the port of Lyttelton as a departure point for expeditions. The International Antarctic Centre provides both base facilities and a museum and visitor centre focused upon current Antarctic activities.\n\n26 Day 11 Christchurch In the morning, take the 30 minute bus ride to Lyttelton for the optional Christchurch Gondola Ride with stunning views of the surrounding mountains and harbor. Then return to the city center and relax while Punting on the Avon. Your Edwardian Punter will give an informative commentary while guiding you quietly past trailing willows, woodlands and leafy banks as you absorb the beauty of Christchurch’s Hagley Park.\n\n27 Day 12 Kaikoura Take the optional tour to Kaikoura, located on the east coast of the South Island just 2 hours north of Christchurch. Kaikoura is a base for wildlife experiences of all kinds, especially whale watching and it’s also known for being a great place to eat crayfish. Kaikoura’s whales, fur seals and dolphins live permanently in the coastal waters. Whale watching trips leave the town several times a day and the local seal colony is always entertaining. Whale Watch Kaikoura is New Zealand's only vessel based whale watching company offering an exciting up-close encounter with the world's largest toothed predator the Giant Sperm Whale in their natural environment at all times of the year. There are also plenty of great cafés, restaurants and shops to explore in this charming town.\n\n28 Day 13 Christchurch – Mt. Cook - Queenstown Depart Christchurch in the morning for Queenstown with a lunch stopover at the Hermitage Hotel with spectacular views of Mount Cook, New Zealand’s highest mountain. Then make a photo stop at Lake Tekapo which gets its milky-turquoise color from the fine rock-flour ground by glaciers which is suspended in the water. Arrive in Queenstown in the early evening, one of New Zealand’s top visitor destinations. While there you’ll understand why. The town sits on the shore of crystal clear Lake Wakatipu among the dramatic Remarkable Mountain ranges.\n\n29 Day 14 – Queenstown The lake and mountain landscape make Queenstown suited to all kinds of adventure. There’s skiing in the winter and activities such as bungy jumping, jet boating, horse trekking and river rafting all year round. AJ Hackett International is the most recognized and respected of all adventure brands. It has been at the forefront of adventure tourism since its creation in the late 1980s. Started by AJ and Henry van Asch in the mountain setting of Queenstown, Bungy Jumping was a vehicle for the perfect lifestyle, a never-ending adventure by two mates to push each other and their friends to the limit.\n\n30 Day 14 – Queenstown Join an optional scenic afternoon cruise to Walter Peak on board the vintage steamship TSS Earnslaw. During the cruise, the ship's pianist entertains with a variety of old favorites and you are encouraged to join in sing-a-long around the piano. Upon arrival at the Colonel's Homestead, you will enjoy high tea and then you can wander through the beautiful lakeside gardens, take a farmyard walking tour, viewing the livestock including sheep, highland cattle, deer and goats. Your hosts will work the sheep dogs and demonstrate sheep sheering and the art of wool spinning. After your farm tour, return to Queenstown across the lake aboard the TSS Earnslaw.\n\n31 Day 15 – Queenstown Join an optional scenic tour to Skipper’s Canyon where you’ll discover exciting Lord of the Rings film locations. The Wakatipu Basin tour takes you to The Remarkables, which were used as various mountains throughout the trilogy including the Misty Mountains. Travelling part way up this beautiful mountain range you get a view of Deer Park Heights, which was used for the refugees of Rohan and the Battle of the Wargs scenes. Then head to the Kawarau Gorge where the filming took place for the Argonath. Leaving the Kawarau Gorge, the trip heads to Arrowtown where the loss of The One Ring at Gladden Fields was filmed. Near Arrowtown you will experience some true off road adventure. Following a historic gold mining road up the Arrow River you will cross the river to get to the Ford of Bruinen. Indulge in morning tea and try your hand at a spot of gold panning. From Arrowtown you will travel to the entrance of Skippers Canyon where you will be offered spectacular panoramic views of the Wakatipu Basin.\n\n32 Day 15 – Queenstown By night you can enjoy dinner at Queenstown's most spectacular location. Reputed to be the steepest lift in the Southern Hemisphere, the gondola carries visitors high above Queenstown to the Skyline complex located on Bob's Peak, an easy five minute walk from central Queenstown. The Skyline Restaurant serves up a mouthwatering Taste of New Zealand buffet of legendary proportions every night of the year. Feast on South Island salmon, seafood, salads, roast meats and delicious desserts - and feast your eyes on the most spectacular scenery in the country. Tiered seating guarantees stunning views from every table.\n\n33 In the morning we travel to Milford Sound checking out the most amazing scenery in New Zealand along the way. The day includes a two hour boat cruise and a delicious hot buffet luncheon. See the Homer Tunnel, gigantic waterfalls and amazing fiords. One of the highlights of the cruise is the stunning Mitre Peak, an iconic mountain and one of the most photographed peaks in the country. The distinctive shape of the peak gives the mountain its name, after the miter headwear of Christian bishops. Part of the reason for its iconic status is its height – it rises to just over a mile from the water of the sound. Day 16 – Milford Sound\n\n34 Milford Sound is a fjord in the south west of New Zealand's South Island, within Fiordland National Park, a World Heritage site.

New Zealand's agricultural industries are free of many insect pests, and plant and animal diseases common elsewhere in the world. They put a lot of effort into minimizing the risk of these being introduced at ports and airports. Heavy fines may be imposed on people caught carrying prohibited materials. On arrival visitors should place any questionable items, particularly fruit, in the bins provided.\n\n40 New Zealand does not have a large temperature range, lacking the extremes found in most continental climates. However, the weather can change unexpectedly, as cold fronts or tropical cyclones quickly blow in. Because of this, you should be prepared for sudden changes in weather and temperature if you're going hiking or doing other outdoor activities. Spring - September, October, November Summer - December, January, February Autumn - March, April, May Winter - June, July, August New Zealand has a largely temperate climate. While the far north has subtropical weather during summer, and inland alpine areas of the South Island can be as cold as - 50 degrees in winter, most of the country lies close to the coast, which means mild temperatures, moderate rainfall, and abundant sunshine. Because New Zealand lies in the Southern Hemisphere, the average temperature decreases as you travel south. The north of New Zealand is subtropical and the south temperate. The warmest months are December, January and February, and the coldest June, July and August. In summer, the average temperature ranges between 65-80ºF and in winter between 50-60ºF. NEW ZEALAND CLIMATE\n\n41 Occupying an island nation with a primarily agricultural economy, New Zealanders enjoy quality local produce from land and sea. Typical New Zealand favorites are lamb, pork, venison, seafood, sweet potato, kiwi fruit, tamarillo, and pavlova, the national dessert - a meringue cake with a light, delicate, crisp crust and a soft sweet marshmallow center. Similar to the cuisine of Australia, the cuisine of New Zealand is a diverse British-based cuisine with Mediterranean, Pacific Rim and Indian influences. Like other Polynesian people, Māori cooked their food in earth ovens known as hāngi. Stones are heated by fire and food parcels, packed in leaves, are placed on top. The packs are further covered with foliage and cloth, or, nowadays wet sacks, then earth. Other cooking methods included roasting and, in geothermal areas, boiling or steaming using natural hot springs and pools. Māori were one of the few people to have no form of alcoholic beverage.
