        "text": "Perhaps most notably we heard the rumour that Carnival is in early talks with the Saudi sovereign wealth fund for a potential sale of Seabourn, who recently celebrated the full return to service of their fleet with Seabourn Sojourn sailing from Athens in early June. Rumours of interest in cruise from the Saudi government have been circulating for some time, as demonstrated by recent charters with Silversea and Scenic plus the significant investment being made to attract cruise ships to Saudi ports. Carnival haven't commented on the speculation, and it's fair to say we've heard gossip like this before, most recently regarding Crystal, so it remains to be seen whether it will come to anything.\n\nOn the subject of Crystal, there was news earlier this month that buyers have been found for their three ocean ships. Crystal Serenity and Symphony were sold at auction to A&K Travel Group, while the word on the street is that expedition ship Crystal Endeavor has been acquired by Silversea and will be renamed Silver Endeavor - exciting news if this turns out to be the case!"
