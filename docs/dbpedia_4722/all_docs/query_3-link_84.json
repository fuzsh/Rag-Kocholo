In addition to his blog you can find his writing in \"Hi Fructose\" magazine and witness him almost life-sized in various plays at The Dark Room Theater in SF's Mission district.\n\nHe tends to write about theater, humor, San Francisco culture and history, and stuff that's just plain weird. He thanks Scott for sharing the keys to the Laughing Squid virtual HQ and promises to uphold whatever it is that the mirthful cephalopod would prefer to be uplifted."
