        "text": "Description\n\nThe Biryusa hovercraft was built in the Leningrad region of Russia at the 'Parma' shipyard. The craft has an inner tube of 0.9 m, enabling it to navigate on land, ice or water, while guests rest comfortably on reclining seats. The propellers enable the boat to turn around and back up, which makes it possible to reach the most beautiful and inaccessible spots along the route and to take guests to any unequipped shore. The double glazing provides additional acoustic and thermal insulation.\n\nOn board there is a bathroom and ample luggage storage.\n\nThe ship is equipped with modern navigation facilities and sails up to a speed of 50 km / h (31 MpH) on calm water and 60 km / h (37.3 MpH) on ice.\n\nGiorgia Lombardo"
