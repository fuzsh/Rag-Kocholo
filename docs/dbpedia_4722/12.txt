Our concept

Vodohod has designed more than 250 excursion programs to suit all tastes and provide you with a flavour of what Russia has to offer. We tested each and every experience ourselves: we walked, we rode the bus, we looked, listened, tried, selected and endorsed only the best of the best.

Either in a small group or by private tour if your prefer, we’ll make sure you see all of the highlights on your itinerary and we’ll even throw in some hidden gems that only those cruising with Vodohod get to see.

At every port of call, we have scheduled just the right amount of time to take in the sights and flavours each place offers.

How the tours are arranged

A selection of must-see daily excursion programs are included as part of your trip. As part of a group you will be assigned an expert local guide who will share their knowledge and insight of the places you visit on your daily excursion programme.

In addition to these tours, we have created a collection of premium optional excursions showcasing extraordinary and rare sites, people and history. These experiences can be pre-booked in advance of your cruise (recommended) or when you arrive on board should you prefer.

Adventure seekers will step into a permafrost cave, hike to construction 503 whilst learning the history of the Gulag and Stalin’s train to nowhere, try your hand at real Siberian fishing and even take a helicopter tour of Plateau Putorana.
