For example, I would like it only to give out IPs between 192.168.254.1 and 192.168.254.199 (but not above!).<BR>Thanks!<BR><BR>-EDIT-<BR>Yes, I want to know if any of the cheap routers can specify a DHCP range and options (gateway, DNS, etc...) other than the default 192.168.1.x. We can't use 192.168.1.255 because the switch is configured to treat that range differently.<BR><BR>[This message was edited by inferno77 on March 13, 2003 at 13:50.]\n\nDepends on the router. Some do DHCP but only in the range they have hard-coded. Others allow you to set it. So you need to read the docs carefully before you buy. Many companies post the docs to their equipment in the 'support' section of their web pages.<BR><BR>Looks like NetGear, D-link, and LinkSys are the popular ones. I like Netgear best but that is a personal preference.\n\ni am reading manuals right now, it is just that there are so many products, and the manuals are quite long (if i find them). i was hoping somebody who owns one with the capability would read the thread.<BR>thanks!<BR>-EDIT-<BR>I have read about most of the Netgear, SMC and Linksys models now, and the main problem seems to be that they don't let you specify a gateway different from the IP of the router in the DHCP configuration. I don't have the option of using this box as the gateway, as the drop in the room is coded to only accept the Cisco switch present (which is also already doing NAT and has multiple gateway IPs).<BR><BR>[This message was edited by inferno77 on March 13, 2003 at 16:02.]\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote\"><font size=\"-1\">quote:</font><HR>and the main problem seems to be that they don't let you specify a gateway different from the IP of the router in the DHCP configuration<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR><BR>Why would you need DHCP clients to use a gateway IP address that's different than the IP for the router that they're directly connected to? (Just curious, as I honestly don't know)<BR><BR>-EDIT- Nevermind- just re-read the part about 192.168.1.x in your forst post.<BR><BR>As far as I know the SMC7004VWBR can be given <I>any</I> LAN IP address that you want to give it. It defaulsts to 192.168.2.1, but you can change it to whatever you want. You can also specify the exact IP range that will be assigned to clients. See page 4-17 of the manual.\n\nYes, most can do what you've asked.<BR>I'm currently using a ultra cheap Hawking Techlonogy broadband router to only dole out IPs in the 192.168.1.20 to 192.168.1.200 range. Bought it on sale a few months ago at MicroCenter for $20 (after rebate).<BR>I used to have a NetGear ISND router and it had the same options for controlling the range of addresses it. The Linksys routers I've worked on also offer the same DHCP ranges."
