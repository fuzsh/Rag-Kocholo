From ‘Our Own Correspondent, Cmicaco, Ti)., Saturday; Aug, 12, 1871. Last Spring some real estate. operators thought. Chicago ought to ‘have 360,000 in- habitants.\" They opened 9 ‘correspondence with Mr. Epwarps,. the.-publisher of our: antual City Directory, and he thought -that he could take a.cenens that would come up to thei figures, or, ae the Tribune expresses it, “‘make two men -' grow ‘where’ there was ‘was but one'before.” He went to work—putung his mark bigh—fally: agsured lie could beat the Federal enumeration of last year, if he didn’t comé.up to the wishes of the laiid speculators. The result is a reported population of -334,719, or a little over 35,000 in excess ot ‘the enumeration 1D 1870. Chicago has inoreased respectably during the past year ; but when we see the'largze number of empty dwellings and bnsiness places which’ are to be found on all-our. streets, we have no idea that the additions to our population have been as large a8 stated, ‘The censts shows somé cnu- fious figures. For instance, while .the native population is nearly doubie that of the German. ‘there is reported less than a hundred difference in the number. of-heads ‘of. families—such as usually go into the Directory—of the two ta- tionalities, And then in the business statistics, there are 1,385 saloon-keepers, when the Mayor has licensed over 2,300, There are: 97,238, Hamés in the Directory, a8 heads of families—miore than | tio a third‘of whom have no: families at: all... Oui · cago is getting along fast enough, and it is a. great piece of folly to get up these enumerations by private individuals, in tle correctness of which nobody ‘has any confidence, The job, I understand, is.paid for by. real. estate agents and others engaged fn land trading, whose in- téereste lie m the direction of making the popu- lation of the city appear as large as possible. A decision just rendered by Judge BuopGsEtTr, of the United States District Court, concerning the taxing of bank shares, is exciting consider- able comment. He holds that the steck must be asséssed at ite par yalue, and net at its market value, as was. attempted to be done. This invalidates the entire tax m this city, and the State too, I suppose, as the existing law extends to all. So the owners.of bank stock~ escape’ free from the burdens of taxation this time. The: law will doubtless be so amended at the next session of the — ture as to meet the cage, The City tax-gatherére aré also baving trouble about their assessments. They have to go.be- fore the County Court in order to have them coufirmed, and the sale of the delinquent list ordered. When there is a contest,in a great number of cases some irregularity is shown, and the assesgment pronounced void,. An immense amount of property. is annually advertised.

A meeting of the Italian Committee of Ar- Trangements for the celebration on the 25th of August next was held last evening, at No. 407 Broome-street, N. Cornrnapr in the. chair.

ENGLISH AFFATIRS.. Prince Arthur's Anauity- Anuuity—The Royal Vis- Saturday, Aug. Prince ARTHUR PaTRICK has got his pen- sion of £215,000 a year for life—thrée times the salary ofan Américan Président—voted by both Houses of Parliament, Mr. Pster TAYior and afew Radicals voted notto give it. Mr. Drxon, of Birmingham, thought ten thousand'a year vould do for a young man who is not very use- ful or ornamental, but he got. only fifty mem- bers or_so to agree. with: him. So Prince Pat- RICK and his big brother, the Prince of Wa.zs, have goné on a loyalty-starring expedition to Ireland, where the Prince of Wats, at a great Dublin dinner, proposed the toasts of the Queen and the royal family, and said he might say that bis: brother, the Duke of .Eprupures, had. gone ee taay oamie cies , and that his next brother some claim upon Irishmen, because one of his many. names wee PaTRick.
