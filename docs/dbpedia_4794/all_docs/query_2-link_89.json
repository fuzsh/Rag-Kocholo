In this document, the term \"PC\" applies generically to all these computers, unless specified otherwise.\n\nThe VPN Client on a remote PC, communicating with a Cisco VPN device at an enterprise or service provider, creates a secure connection over the Internet that lets you access a private network as if you were an on-site user. This secure connection is a Virtual Private Network (VPN).\n\nSystem Requirements\n\nRefer to Chapter 2, \"Installing the VPN Client,\" in the VPN Client User Guide for Windows, Release 4.0 or Cisco VPN Client User Guide for Mac OS X, as appropriate for your platform, for a complete list of system requirements and installation instructions.\n\n• To install the VPN Client on any system, you need\n\n– CD-ROM drive (if you are installing from CD-ROM)\n\n– Administrator privileges\n\n• The following table indicates the system requirements to install the VPN Client on each of the supported platforms.\n\nThe VPN Client supports the following Cisco VPN devices:\n\n• Cisco VPN 3000 Concentrator Series, Version 3.0 and later.\n\n• Cisco PIX Firewall, Version 6.2.2(122) or Version 6.3(1).\n\n• Cisco IOS Routers, Version 12.2(8)T and later\n\nIf you are using Internet Explorer, use version 5.0, Service Pack 2 or higher.\n\nInstallation Notes\n\nBecause of platform differences, the installation instructions for Windows and non-Windows platforms also differ.\n\n• Refer to the VPN Client User Guide for Windows, Release 4.0, Chapter 2, for complete installation instructions for Windows users.\n\n• Refer to the Cisco VPN Client user Guide for Mac OS X, Chapter 2, for complete installation information for those platforms.\n\nThe following notes are important for users who are upgrading to Windows XP and users who want to downgrade to an earlier version of the VPN Client software.\n\nInstalling Release 4.0.3\n\nRelease 4.0.3 on Windows operating systems is localized for Canadian French and Japanese, as well as English. The following sections describe how to install this version on a Windows system.\n\nOverriding the MSI Installation Language.\n\nTo perform this action you must already have Windows Installer Version 2.0 installed. You can determine which version you have by executing msiexec.exe without parameters. If the version is lower than 2.0, execute instmsiw.exe, which updates the software to the correct version.\n\nNote You must run the following commands from the command line, and the current directory must be the install source.\n\nThe default installation is in English. To specify a language other than English, enter the following command, all on the same line:\n\nmsiexec /i vpnclient_setup.msi TRANSFORMS=vpnclient_<language>.mst;vpnclient_help_<language>.mst\n\nThe supported language codes are:\n\n• fc (Canadian French)\n\n• jp (Japanese)\n\nTo force an English only language install, enter the following command:\n\nmsiexec /i vpnclient_setup.msi\n\nTo force a Canadian French language installation, enter the following command, all on the same line:\n\nTo force a Japanese language installation, enter the following command, all on the same line:\n\nOverriding IS Installation Language:\n\nThe install image must contain a vpnclient.ini file with the following two lines:\n\n[main]\n\nClientLanguage=<language code>\n\nThe supported language codes are\n\n• fc (Canadian French)\n\n• jp (Japanese)\n\nNon-localized Features\n\nThe following parts of the VPN Client are not localized:\n\n• VPN Client GUI Splash Screen\n\n• Copyright statements\n\n• Log Messages\n\n• Any text pushed down from the VPN 3000 Concentrator. This includes the banner and the user authentication request text message (which most often appears as \"Enter User Name and Password\").\n\n• InstallShield text. We are localizing only the MSI install text.\n\n• The company name, \"Cisco Systems\", and product name, \"VPN Client\".\n\nInstallation Notes - Windows Platforms\n\nIn addition to the installation considerations for Release 4.0.3, Release 4.0.x includes the following installation considerations for Windows users:\n\nInstalling the VPN Client Software Using InstallShield\n\nInstalling the VPN Client software on Windows NT, Windows 2000, or Windows XP with InstallShield requires Administrator privileges. If you do not have Administrator privileges, you must have someone who has Administrator privileges install the product for you.\n\nNote The VPN Client Installer does not allow installations from a network drive (CSCeb43490).\n\nInstalling the VPN Client Software Using the MSI Installer\n\nIf you are using the MSI installer, you must have Windows NT-based products such as Windows NT 4.0 (with SP6), Windows 2000, or Windows XP. Installing with MSI also requires Administrator privileges.\n\nNote Windows Installer 2.0 must be installed on a Windows NT or Windows 2000 PC before configuring the PC for a Restricted User with Elevated Privileges (CSCea37900).\n\nVPN Client Installation Using Windows Installer (MSI) Requires Windows NT SP6\n\nWhen you attempt to install the VPN Client using MSI install (vpnclient_en.exe) on NT SP3, SP4, or SP5, the error messages do not indicate that the VPN Client cannot be installed on those operating systems because they are unsupported. Once the errors occur, no other messages are displayed and the installation is aborted.\n\nWhen you attempt to run vpnclient_en.exe on Windows NT SP3, SP4, or SP5 you see the following messages:\n\n\"Cannot find the file instmsiw.exe (or one of its components). Make sure the path and filename are correct and that all the required libraries are available.\"\n\n-then-\n\n\"Cannot find the file MSIEXEC (or one of its components). Make sure the path and filename are correct and that all the required libraries are available.\"\n\nThe Windows Installer (MSI) can be installed only on NT SP6, so the error messages you see using earlier service packs are due to an MSI incompatibility (CSCdy05049).\n\nInstallation Notes - Solaris Platforms\n\nThe following sections describe actions you must take when installing the VPN Client on a Solaris platform.\n\nUninstall an Older VPN Client If Present on a Solaris Platform\n\nIf you have a previous version of the VPN Client running under Solaris, you must uninstall the older VPN Client before installing a new VPN Client. You are not required to uninstall an old VPN Client, if one is present, before installing a new VPN Client for Linux or Mac OS X.\n\nRefer to the Cisco VPN Client User Guide for Linux, Solaris, and Mac OS X, Chapter 2, for complete uninstallation information.\n\nDisable the ipfilter Firewall Kernel Module Before Installing the VPN Client on a Solaris Platform\n\nIf you have an IP firewall installed on your workstation, the reboot after installation of the VPN Client takes an inordinate amount of time. This is caused by a conflict between the vpnclient kernel module cipsec and the ipfilter firewall module. To work around this issue, disable the ipfilter firewall kernel module before you install the VPN Client (CSCdw27781).\n\nUsing the VPN Client\n\n• To use the VPN Client, you need:\n\n– Direct network connection (cable or DSL modem and network adapter/interface card), or\n\n– Internal or external modem, and\n\n• To connect using a digital certificate for authentication, you need a digital certificate signed by one of the following Certificate Authorities (CAs) installed on your PC:\n\n– Baltimore Technologies (www.baltimoretechnologies.com)\n\n– Entrust Technologies (www.entrust.com)\n\n– Netscape (www.netscape.com)\n\n– Verisign, Inc. (www.verisign.com)\n\n– Microsoft Certificate Services — Windows 2000\n\n– A digital certificate stored on a smart card. The VPN Client supports smart cards via the MS CAPI Interface.\n\nNew Features in Release 4.0.5\n\nRelease 4.0.5 of the VPN Client software includes the following new features.\n\nMutual Group Authentication\n\nNote This feature addresses a VPN Client group password vulnerability identified in the following Security Notice: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk583/tk372/\n\ntechnologies_security_notice09186a0080215981.html (CSCed41329).\n\nGroup Authentication is a method that uses pre-shared keys for mutual authentication. In this method, the VPN Client and the VPN central-site device use a group name and password to validate the connection. This is a symmetrical form of authentication since both sides use the same authentication method during their negotiations.\n\nMutual group authentication is asymmetrical in that each side uses a different method to authenticate the other while establishing a secure tunnel to form the basis for group authentication. In this method, authentication happens in two stages. During the first stage, the VPN central-site device authenticates itself using public-key techniques (digital signature) and the two sides negotiate to establish a secure channel for communication. During the second stage, the actual authentication of the VPN Client user by the central-site VPN device takes place. Since this approach does not use pre-shared keys for peer authentication, it provides greater security than group authentication alone, as it is not vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack.\n\nTo use mutual group authentication, the remote user's VPN Client system must have a root certificate installed. If needed, you can install a root certificate automatically by placing it on the VPN Client system during installation. The certificate must be in a file named rootcert, with no extension, and must be placed in the installation directory for the remote user's VPN Client system.\n\nFor more information on mutual group authentication, see the VPN Client Administrator Guide, Chapter 1.\n\nYou must configure both the VPN Client and the VPN Concentrator to allow mutual group authentication (Hybrid mode). Ensure that the Certificate Authority being used on both the VPN Client and the VPN Concentrator is the same. Configure the VPN Concentrator in a similar fashion to the use of User Certificates.\n\n1. Select an IKE Proposal that allows HYBRID mode authentication such as those listed in Table 8-3 of the VPN Client Administrator's Guide. HYBRID-AES256-SHA-RSA for example.\n\n2. Configure an IPSec SA to use the appropriate Identity Certificate to be authenticated with the CA certifcate of the VPN Client. If certificates have not yet been obtained for the VPN Concentrator, please refer to the VPN 3000 Series Concentrator Reference Volume I: Configuration Release 4.1.\n\n3. Configure a VPN Group to use the new IPSec SA from step 2. The VPN Clients under test for Mutual Group Authentication will be connecting to this group.\n\nNew Features in Release 4.0\n\nRelease 4.0 of the VPN Client software includes the following new features.\n\nVirtual Adapter\n\nA virtual adapter is a software-only driver that acts as a valid interface in the system. Its purpose is to solve protocol incompatibility problems. The virtual adapter appears in the network properties list just like a physical adapter.\n\nNote When installing the Release 4.0 VPN Client on a Windows 2000 system, the following warning appears during the virtual adapter installation, indicating that no digital signature was found and asking whether to continue the installation:\n\nThe Microsoft digital signature affirms that software has been tested with Windows and that the software has not been altered since it was tested.\n\nThe software you are about to install does not have a Microsoft digital signature. Therefore, there is no guarantee that this software works correctly with Windows.\n\nCisco Systems VPN Adapter\n\nIf you want to search for Microsoft digitally signed software, visit the Windows Update Web site at http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com to see if one is available.\n\nDo you want to continue the installation?\n\nIf you see this message, click \"Yes\" to continue (CSCdz14583).\n\nCommon Graphical Interface for Windows and Mac VPN Clients\n\nIn Release 4.0, the VPN Client provides a consistent graphical user interface across all supported Windows operating systems and Mac OS X, recognizing that the Windows and Mac operating systems follow different conventions, and that the Windows version has additional features. The VPN Client documentation is based on this new user interface.\n\nAlerts (Delete With Reason)\n\nIn Release 4.0, the VPN Client can display to the user the reason for a VPN 3000 Concentrator-initiated disconnection. If the VPN 3000 Concentrator, Release 4.0, disconnects the VPN Client and tears down the tunnel, the VPN Client, Release 4.0, displays a popup window showing the reason for the disconnect and also logs a message to the Notifications log and the IPSec log file. For IPSec deletes that do not tear down the connection, the event message appears only in the log file.\n\nThe administrator on the VPN 3000 Concentrator can enable or disable this feature, called Alerts in the VPN Concentrator configuration. It is not configurable on the VPN Client. When this feature is enabled, the VPN 3000 Concentrator and the VPN Client negotiate whether to display these messages. See the Cisco VPN Client User Guide, Release 4.0, for a description of the conditions that can cause such disconnects.\n\nSingle IPSec-SA\n\nRather than creating a host-to-network security association (SA) pair for each split-tunneling network, this feature provides a host-to-ALL approach, creating one tunnel for all appropriate network traffic apart from whether split-tunneling is in use. With this feature, the VPN Client supports a single SA per VPN connection and directs all the appropriate traffic through this tunnel, regardless of whether split tunneling is in use. The Statistics page on the VPN Client reflects the traffic for this single SA.\n\nPersonal Firewall Enhancements\n\nIn Release 4.0, the VPN Client supports Sygate Personal Firewall and Sygate Personal Firewall Pro, Version 5.0, Build 1175 and higher. Other supported features new with this release include:\n\n• The ability to enable or disable stateful firewalls from the command line.\n\n• Configurable ICMP permissions.\n\nCoexistence with Third-Party VPN Vendors\n\nIn Release 4.0, the VPN Client is compatible with VPN clients from Microsoft, Nortel, Checkpoint, Intel, and others. This feature offers the ability to use other VPN products while the Cisco VPN Client is installed.\n\nImproved RADIUS SDI XAuth Request Handling\n\nThe VPN Client, Release 4.0, includes improvements in RADIUS SDI XAuth handling, which may improve performance. Administrators can configure this feature in the .pcf file and the .ini file. For information, see VPN Client Administrator Guide, Release 4.0, Chapter 2.\n\nNew, ISO-Standard Format for Log File Names\n\nThe format of the names of log files generated by the VPN Client GUI has changed to LOG-yyyy-MM-dd-hh-mm-ss.txt from MMM-d-yyyy-hh-mm-ss.log. This new format complies with the ISO 8601 extended specification for representations of dates and times and avoids issues with localization.\n\nThe new log file names have a chronological order that is the same as their alphanumeric order. This provides for a method of enumerating only the log files generated by the GUI.\n\nEnhancements to GINA\n\nRelease 4.0.2 includes an improved application launch verification mechanism employed by the Graphical Identification and Authentication (GINA) dynamic-link library (DLL). This affects only the Windows NT4, Windows 2000, and Windows XP platforms (CSCeb12179).\n\nUsage Notes\n\nThis section lists issues to consider before installing Release 4.0.x of the VPN Client software.\n\nIn addition, you should be aware of the open caveats regarding this release. Refer to \"Open Caveats\" on page 37 of these Release Notes for the list of known problems.\n\nPotential Application Compatibility Issues\n\nYou might encounter the following compatibility issues when using the VPN Client with specific applications. Whenever possible, this list describes the circumstances under which an issue might occur and workarounds for potential problems.\n\nWindows Interoperability Issues\n\nThe following known issues might occur with the indicated Microsoft Windows operating systems and applications software.\n\nWINS Support\n\nOn Windows 95 and Windows 98, dynamic WINS support works with DHCP-enabled adapters (for example, PPP or NIC adapters that get their IP information dynamically). For static configurations, users must manually configure the adapters with WINS information.\n\nWindows NT\n\nUsers running Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 4 require a hot fix from Microsoft for proper operation. This fix is available on the Microsoft GetHostByName API Returns Unbindable Address page: http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q217/0/01.ASP.\n\nImporting a Microsoft Certificate Using Windows NT SP3\n\nThe following problem has occurred on some Windows NT SP3 systems (CSCdt11315).\n\nWhen using the Client with digital certificates stored in the Microsoft certificate store, the Client may fail to connect. This is accompanied by the following Client event in the Log Viewer:\n\n4101 13:41:48.557 01/05/01 Sev=Warning/2 CERT/0xA3600002\n\nCould not load certificate (null) from the store.\n\nWorkaround: Two workarounds exist. Choose one of the following:\n\n• Import the certificate from the Microsoft certificate store into the Cisco certificate store using the Cisco Certificate Manager. Refer to \"Importing a Certificate\" in the VPN Client User Guide for Windows, Release 4.0,\n\nChapter 6.\n\n• Alternatively, upgrade to a Windows Service Pack later than SP3.\n\nVPN Client Cannot Launch Microsoft Connection Manager\n\nThe VPN Client does not see a dialup connection made with Microsoft Connection Manager because of incompatibilities between the requirements of the two applications (CSCdx85663).\n\nWindows 98 Might Hang on Shutdown\n\nOn some Windows 98 PCs with the VPN Client installed, if you restart the PC, it may stop responding (that is, \"hang\") on the screen that says \"Windows is shutting down\".\n\nWait a minute. If the PC is still not responding, press the reset button. When the PC reboots, it should not run through ScanDisk, indicating the shutdown was successful in closing all open files. This problem may occur on some PCs and not on others, and we are looking for a solution. Windows 98 shutdown has numerous issues, as can be seen the following Microsoft Knowledge Base Article:\n\n\"Q238096 - How to Troubleshoot Windows 98 Second Edition Shutdown Problems\" (CSCdt00729).\n\nWindows 2000 (only) Requires Adding Client for MS Networks for Dialup Connections\n\nFor the Cisco VPN Client running on a Windows 2000 system, you cannot access Microsoft resources unless you add the Client for Microsoft Networks for the Dial-up adapter.\n\nAladdin Runtime Environment (RTE) Issue with Windows NT and Windows 2000\n\nUsing versions of the Aladdin Runtime Environment (RTE) on Windows NT and Windows 2000 can cause the following behavior. The login prompt that is posted by the Aladdin etoken when connecting the VPN Client can get hidden in the background. If this happens, the VPN connection can timeout and fail with the following event:\n\n\"System Error: Connection Manager failed to respond.\"\n\nA side effect of this is that the VPN Client's service and dialer might become out of synch, and the PC might need to be restarted (CSCdv47999). To avoid this issue, use the Aladdin Runtime Environment (RTE) version 2.65 or later.\n\nMicrosoft MSN Installation\n\nMicrosoft's MSN installation fails if you have already installed the VPN Client. Uninstall the VPN Client before you install MSN. After MSN has completed installation, you can install the VPN Client.\n\nWINS Information Might Not Be Removed from Windows Servers If Not Disconnected Before Shutdown\n\nIf the VPN Concentrator is configured to send WINS server addresses down to the VPN Client and the PC is shut down or restarted without first disconnecting the VPN Client, the WINS servers are not removed from the network properties. This might cause local PC registration and name resolution problems while not connected with VPN.\n\nTo work around this problem, do one of the following:\n\n• Be sure to disconnect the VPN Client before shutting down. If you are having problems, check your network properties and remove the WINS entries if they are not correct for your network.\n\n• Alternatively, enable \"Disconnect VPN connection when logging off\". Go to Options > Windows Logon Properties, check Disconnect VPN connection when logging off (CSCdv65165).\n\nVPN Client May Falsely Trigger Auto Initiation Connection Event though the NIC Card Has Been Removed\n\nThe 4.0 VPN Client with Auto Initiation enabled on a Windows NT system may exhibit the following behavior. After removing a NIC card, the VPN Client may continue to trigger an Auto Initiation connection event though the NIC card has been removed. To stop its connection attempts, you can place the VPN Client in Suspended mode after a failed or canceled VPN connection. You can also disable this feature from the GUI by using Options > Automatic VPN Initiation, and unchecking \"Enable\". If you add a new NIC, the problem goes away. (CSCdx46812).\n\nDNS\n\nFor DNS resolution, if the DOMAIN NAME is not configured on the network interface, you need to enter the fully qualified domain name of the host that needs to be resolved.\n\nNetwork Interfaces\n\n• The VPN Client does not support Point-to-Point Protocol over ATM (PPPoA).\n\n• The VPN Client cannot establish tunnels over Token Ring. However, it does not conflict with an installed Token Ring interface.\n\n• DELL Docking Station users running the VPN Client on Windows NT may experience bluescreen failures if the latest version of Softex Docking Services has not been installed. The Softex Docking Service utilities are available directly from the DELL Support Web site, http://search.dell.com/index.asp. Select the checkbox for the File Library and search for the term \"Softex Docking Services\".\n\nNetwork ICE BlackICE Defender Configuration\n\nNetwork ICE's BlackICE Defender is a traffic monitoring security product. If you properly configure it, BlackICE Defender can work with the VPN Client. You must configure BlackICE Defender for Trusting, Nervous, or Cautious mode. If you use Nervous or Cautious mode, add the public IP address of the VPN Concentrator to the list of trusted addresses. You can now configure the VPN Client to work with BlackICE Defender configured for Paranoid mode when in Tunnel-everything mode. Split Tunneling requires BlackICE to be in Trusting, Nervous, or Cautious mode.\n\nThe Cisco VPN Client firewall has the following requirements for BlackICE (BlackICE Defender 2.5 or greater or BlackICE Agent 2.5 or greater). For BlackICE Defender 2.5, copy the BICTRL.DLL file from the Cisco installation release medium to the BlackICE installation directory on the VPN Client PC. This is a mandatory step for making a connection requiring BlackICE.\n\nBlackICE Defender version 2.9 and greater includes the BICTRL.DLL file in the Network ICE distribution medium, so that you do not need to copy it from the Cisco installation release medium.\n\nMicrosoft Outlook Error Occurs on Connection or Disconnect\n\nThe following Microsoft Outlook error might occur when the VPN Client connects or disconnects:\n\n\"Either there is no default mail client, or the current mail client cannot fulfill the messaging request. Run Microsoft Outlook and set it as the default mail client.\"\n\nThis message does not affect operation of the VPN Client. The issue occurs when Microsoft Outlook is installed but not configured for email, although it is the default mail client. It is caused by a Registry Key that is set when the user installs Outlook.\n\nTo eliminate this message, do one of the following:\n\n• Right-click the Outlook icon, go to Properties, and configure it to use Microsoft Exchange or Internet Mail as the default mail client.\n\n• Use Internet Explorer to configure the system to have no default mail client.\n\n• Configure Outlook as the default mail client (CSCdv67594).\n\nAdjusting the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) Value - Windows Only\n\nVPN Encapsulation adds to the overall message length. To avoid refragmentation of packets, the VPN Client must reduce the MTU settings. The default MTU adjusted value is 1300 for all adapters. If the default adjustments are not sufficient, you may experience problems sending and receiving data. To avoid fragmented packets, you can change the MTU size, usually to a lower value than the default. To change the MTU size, use the VPN Client SetMTU utility. If you are using PPPoE, you may also have to set the MTU in other locations. Refer to the following table for the specific procedures for each type of connection.\n\nThe MTU is the largest number of bytes a frame can carry, not counting the frame's header and trailer. A frame is a single unit of transportation on the Data Link Layer. It consists of header data, plus data that was passed down from the Network Layer, plus (sometimes) trailer data. An Ethernet frame has an MTU of 1500 bytes, but the actual size of the frame can be up to 1526 bytes (22-byte header, 4-byte CRC trailer).\n\nRecognizing a Potential MTU Problem\n\nIf you can connect with the Cisco VPN Client but cannot send or receive data, this is likely an MTU problem. Common failure indications include the following:\n\n• You can receive data, such as mail, but not send it.\n\n• You can send small messages (about 10 lines), but larger ones time out.\n\n• You cannot send attachments in email.\n\nSetting the MTU Value\n\nIf you are not experiencing a problem, do not change the MTU value. Usually, an MTU value of 1300 works. If it doesn't, the end user must decrease the value until the Cisco VPN Client passes data. Decrement the MaxFrameSize value by 50 or 100 until it works.\n\nThe following table shows how to set the MTU value for each type of connection.\n\nAsante FR3004 Cable/DSL Routers Require Asante Firmware Version 2.15 or Later\n\nVersions of the Asante firmware caused a problem with rekeying and keepalives when a VPN Client had an all-or-nothing connection to a VPN Concentrator through an Asante FR3004 Cable/DSL router. Version 2.15 (or later) of the Asante firmware resolves these issues. For more information about Asante cable/DSL routers, see the following Web sites:\n\n• http://www.asante.com/products/routers/index.html\n\n• http://www.practicallynetworked.com/pg/router_guide_index.asp\n\nUsing Nexland Cable/DSL Routers for Multiple Client Connections\n\nAll Nexland Pro routers support passing multiple IPSec sessions through to Cisco VPN 3000 Series Concentrators. To enable this function, the Nexland user must select IPSec Type 2SPI-C on the Nexland options page.\n\nThe discontinued Nexland ISB2LAN product correctly handles a single connection, but problems can occur when attempting to make multiple client connections to the same Secure Gateway from behind an ISB2LAN Nexland Cable/DSL router. Nexland has fixed this problem in the Nexland Pro series of routers (CSCdt10266).\n\nCert DN Matching Cannot Match on Email Field EA\n\nYou cannot match on the Cert DN field (EA) when using the Peer Cert DN Verification feature because the VPN Concentrator does not assign a value to that field (CSCdx25994).\n\nVPN Dialer Application Can Load During OS Shutdown or Restart\n\nWhen using the VPN Client's Start Before Logon feature (Windows NT, Windows 2000, or Windows XP) in \"fallback\" mode, the VPN dialer application loads during a shutdown or restart of the operating system. This will not cause any problems and can be ignored (CSCdu02071).\n\nAmerica Online (AOL) Interoperability Issues\n\nAOL Versions 5.0 and 6.0\n\nThe VPN Client supports AOL Version 5.0. AOL Version 6.0 is also supported, with one limitation: when connected, browsing in the network neighborhood is not available.\n\nAOL Version 7.0\n\nAOL Version 7.0 uses a proprietary heartbeat polling of connected clients. This requires the use of split tunneling to support the polling mechanism. Without split tunneling, AOL disconnects after a period of time between 5 and 30 minutes.\n\nAOL 7 Disconnects after VPN Authentication\n\nWhen making a dialup connection with AOL 7.0 Revision 4114.537 (for Windows 95, 98, ME, Windows 2000 and XP), then attempting to connect with the VPN Client, AOL might disconnect while the user is being authenticated. This is an AOL issue, not a VPN Client problem (CSCdy45351).\n\nVPN Client Fails to Connect over Some AOL Dialup Connections\n\nThe Cisco VPN Client connecting over an AOL dialup connection fails to complete the connection, particularly when using AOL 7.0 and 8.0.\n\nThe AOL dialup process uses a fallback method which, if your initial attempt to connect fails, resorts to a different connection type for the second attempt. This second attempt can sometimes cause AOL to communicate over two PPP adapters (visible in ipconfig /all output). When this happens, the VPN Client cannot connect. This is a known issue, and AOL is investigating the problem.\n\nThe workaround is to try to reconnect the dialup connection to try to avoid getting two PPP adapters (CSCea29056).\n\nBrowser Interoperability Issues\n\nThe following known issues might occur when using the VPN Client with the indicated browser software.\n\nIssues Loading Digital Certificate from Microsoft Certificate Store on Windows NT SP5 and on IE 4.0 SP2\n\nThe following error occurs in the VPN Client log when using a Digital Certificate from the Microsoft Certificate Store. This can occur on Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 5 and on Internet Explorer 4.0 with SP2 and using the VPN Client v3.1 or v3.5:\n\n\"Could not load certificate cn=Joe Smith,ou=Engineering,o=MyCompany,l=Buffalo, st=new york,c=US,e=jsmith@mycompany.com from the Unsupported Store store\"\n\nBoth the VPN Client and the Certificate Manager can see and validate the Certificate, but when you try to connect using that Certificate, you get a message in the Connection History dialog that says, \"Failed to establish a secure connection to the security gateway\".\n\nTo fix this problem, do one of the following:\n\n• Upgrade to Internet Explorer v5.0 or greater.\n\n• Upgrade the PC to Service Pack 6.0a (CSCdv70215).\n\nRequirements for using VPN Client for Windows Using Digital Certificate With Non-exportable Keys\n\nTo use certificates with non-exportable keys, you must have the VPN Client, Release 3.6 or 4.0, and your PC must have Internet Explorer version 5.0 SP2 or later installed to function properly. (CSCdx90228).\n\nEntrust Entelligence Issues\n\nThe following known issues might occur when using Entrust Entelligence software with the VPN Client.\n\nPotential Connection Delay\n\nUsing the VPN Client with Entrust Entelligence might result in a delay of approximately 30 seconds if you are trying to connect while Entrust is \"online\" with the CA. This delay varies, depending on your Entrust CA configuration. If the Entrust CA is on the private network, then the chance of Entrust being online are low, since the VPN connection is needed to communicate with the CA.\n\nIf you experience this delay, do one of the following:\n\n• Wait for the delay to end and proceed with the VPN connection normally.\n\n• Before initiating the VPN Client connection, log out of Entrust. The VPN Client will initiate the Entrust Login Interface with the \"work offline\" checkbox checked, which alleviates the problem. The easiest way to log out of Entrust is to right-click on the Entrust tray icon (gold key) and select \"Log out of Entrust\" (CSCdu25495).\n\nEntrust System Tray Icon Might Erroneously Indicate Logout\n\nWhen using VPN Client with Start Before Logon (Windows NT and 2000) and Entrust Entelligence, the Entrust system tray icon indicates that it is \"logged out\" once in Windows. It is really logged in, just not in the normal Windows desktop. The reason for this is that the context that Entrust was logged into was on the \"Logon desktop\". This is an Entrust issue, not a VPN Client problem.\n\nEntrust operates normally once logged into within Windows (CSCdu29239).\n\nEntrust Client May Appear Offline\n\nAfter establishing a VPN connection with Entrust Entelligence certificates, the Entrust client may appear offline. It may appear this way even after the Entrust client has successfully communicated with the Entrust i500 directory.\n\nTo work around this issue, do one of the following:\n\n• Upgrade to Entrust Entelligence version 5.1 SP3 or later.\n\n• Once connected, right click on the Entrust tray icon (gold key) and uncheck \"Work Offline\". This manually puts Entrust online (CSCdu33638).\n\nUse Entrust Entelligence 4.0 with VPN Client Release 3.5.1 or 3.1 Start Before Logon\n\nWhen using the Release 3.5.1 or 3.1 VPN Client with the Entrust Entelligence 4.0 software, the Start Before Logon feature does not function properly. Upgrading to Entrust Entelligence 5.1 resolves this problem (CSCdu61926).\n\nSome Entrust Dialogs Do Not Display Properly When Using VPN Client Start Before Logon\n\nWhen using the VPN Client with Start Before Logon and Entrust Entelligence, some Entrust dialogs do not display properly on the logon desktop that displays before going into Windows NT or Windows 2000. The first time the VPN Client dialer and service access the Entrust certificates, it prompts for a security check. This prompt displays in Windows, but not at the logon screen.\n\nTo work around this problem, connect the VPN Client once, while in Windows and after installing, to register the VPN applications (ipsecdialer.exe and cvpnd.exe) with Entrust. Once you have done this you can use it at the logon desktop (CSCdu62212).\n\nRenewing Entrust Entelligence Certificate (Key Update) Requires Entrust Version 5.1 SP 3 or Later\n\nEntrust Entelligence certificate renewal (key update) will not work over a VPN Client connection unless Entrust Entelligence version 5.1 SP3 or later is being used. Other Entrust Entelligence operations using older versions work properly.\n\nTo work around this issue, do one of the following:\n\n• Upgrade to Entrust Entelligence version 5.1 SP3 or later.\n\n• Computers need to have Entrust digital certificates renewed by placing them directly on the network during the renewal period to get updated (CSCdu84038).\n\nAccessing Online Glossary Requires Connection to Cisco.com\n\nThe Glossary button at the top of all Help screens tries to contact univercd at www.cisco.com (the Cisco documentation site). This connection requires connectivity to Cisco's main web site. If your PC does not have a corporate Internet connection or your firewall blocks access, the following error appears when you attempt to access the Glossary:\n\n\"The page cannot be displayed.\"\n\nTo access the Glossary, you must be connected to www.cisco.com (CSCdy14238).\n\nZoneAlarm Plus Versions 3.1.274 and Earlier Are Incompatible with VPN Client\n\nThe following known incompatibility exists between the Cisco VPN Client and Zone Labs ZoneAlarm Plus version 3.1.274 and earlier. If you are using such a version of ZoneAlarm Plus, please visit http://www.zonelabs.com or contact your Zone Labs representative for an update.\n\nOn a PC with ZoneAlarm Plus version 3.1.274 (or earlier) and the VPN Client, the following errors occur when the PC boots:\n\nOn Windows 2000:\n\nZAPLUS.exe has generated errors and will be closed by Windows. You will need to restart the program.\n\nAn error log is being generated.\n\nThe Application Log states:\n\nThe application, ZAPLUS.EXE, generated an application error. The error occurred on 7/23/2002... The exception was c0000005 at address 00401881 (<nosymbols>).\n\nSimilar errors occur on other Windows operating systems.\n\nThe result of this error is that the ZoneAlarm GUI does not run, and therefore a user can not change any settings in ZoneAlarm Plus or allow new programs to access the Internet.(CSCdy16607).\n\nZoneLabs Automatically Adds Loopback and VPN 3000 Concentrator Addresses to Trusted Zone for Windows NT PCs\n\nThe Loopback address and the VPN 3000 Concentrator's address are automatically added to the ZoneLabs \"Trusted Zone\" on Windows NT-based systems.\n\nIf a Windows NT based-PC has ZoneAlarm, ZoneAlarm Pro, or Zone Labs Integrity Agent, and the VPN Client Release 4.0 installed on it, the loopback address (127.0.0.1) is automatically added to Zone Labs \"Trusted Zone\" when the Client service is started. Additionally, the VPN 3000 Concentrator's address is automatically added to the \"Trusted Zone\" when a connection is made (CSCea61272).\n\nUpgrading Zone-Alarm Pro to Version 3.7.098 Causes Error When VPN Client Is Already Installed on the PC\n\nUpgrading ZoneAlarm Pro version 3.5.xxx to ZoneAlarm Pro version 3.7.098 when the VPN Client is installed on the PC might cause the following error to appear:\n\n\"The procedure entry point DbgProcessReset could not be located in the dynamic link library VSUTIL.dll.\"\n\nClick OK, and the installation continues (CSCea25991). See ZoneLabs' bug number 10182.\n\nHarmless Warning Might Occur with Linux Kernel 2.4\n\nLinux users running 2.4 kernels may encounter the following warning when the VPN Client kernel module is loaded:\n\nWarning: loading /lib/modules/2.4.18-3/CiscoVPN/cisco_ipsec will taint the kernel: no license\n\nThis message indicates that the VPN Client kernel module is not licensed under the GPL, so the Linux kernel developers will not debug any kernel problems that occur while this kernel module is loaded. This message does not affect the operation of the VPN Client in any way (CSCdy31826).\n\nDHCP Route Renewal in Windows 2000 and Windows XP\n\nIn a Windows 2000 or Windows XP environment, if the public network matches the private network (for example, a public IP address of 192.168.1.5, with a subnet mask of 255.255.0.0, and an identical private IP address) and the public network's route metric is 1, then traffic might not be tunneled to the private network (CSCdz88896). The same problem can occur if you are using a virtual adapter and the public metric is smaller than the virtual adapter metric.\n\nIn Windows 2000 and Windows XP, you can increase the metric of the public network by doing the following steps:\n\nStep 1 Select Start > Settings > Control Panel > Network and Dial-up Connections.\n\nStep 2 Select the public interface and click properties for the public interface.\n\nStep 3 Select Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) and get the properties for the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP).\n\nStep 4 Click Advanced, and set the interface metric to 2 or greater.\n\nSolaris Client Using Routed RIP Might Lose Connectivity\n\nIf the VPN Client running in the Solaris environment uses routed RIP to learn its default route, you might lose connectivity. This is because RIP is blocked when the VPN Client is connected in all tunneling mode (CSCdv75825).\n\nData Meant for Private Network Stays Local if VPN Client's Local Network Is on Same IP Subnet as Remote Private Network\n\nThis problem occurs only with the VPN Client, Release 4.0 and only with Virtual Adapter (Windows 2000 and Windows XP), when the VPN Client's local network is on the same IP subnet as the remote private network. When a VPN connection is up, data meant for the private network stays local. For example: 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0\n\nThe VPN Client, Release 4.0, with Virtual Adapter attempts to modify local route metrics to allow data to pass over the VPN tunnel. In some cases, it is impossible for the VPN Client to make this modification (CSCdz38680).\n\nTo work around this problem, make the change manually, using the following procedure:\n\nStep 1 Run > Control Panel > Network and Dialup Connections.\n\nStep 2 Right-click on the adapter in question and select Properties.\n\nStep 3 From the Adapter Properties dialog, select TCP/IP from the list and click Properties.\n\nStep 4 Click Advanced and increase the number in the \"Interface metric\" box by 1 (it is usually 1, so making it 2 works).\n\nStep 5 Click OK to exit out of all dialogs.\n\nStep 6 The VPN connection should now work.\n\nDNS Server on Private Network with Split DNS Causes Problems\n\nWhen an ISP's DNS server is included in the Split Tunneling Network List and Split DNS Names are configured, all DNS queries to domains other than those in the Split DNS Names list are not resolved.\n\nBy definition, split DNS is used so that only certain domains get resolved by corporate DNS servers, while rest go to public (ISP-assigned) DNS servers. To enforce this feature, the VPN Client direcds DNS queries that are about hosts on the Split DNS Names list to corporate DNS servers, and discards all DNS queries that are not part of the Split DNS Names list.\n\nThe problem is when the ISP-assigned DNS servers are in the range of the Split Tunneling Network List. In that case, all DNS queries for non-split-DNS domains are discarded by the VPN Client.\n\nTo avoid this problem, remove the ISP-assigned DNS server from the range of the Split Tunneling Network List, or do not configure split DNS (CSCee66180).\n\nVPN Client Supports Sygate Personal Firewall V. 5.0, Build 1175\n\nThe supported version of Sygate Personal Firewall is version 5.0, build 1175. Earlier versions might cause the following Blue screen to occur on a Windows NT-based system that has made many connects/disconnects with the VPN Client (CSCdy62426):\n\nStop: 000000d1 (BAD0B0B8, 00000002, 00000000, BFF12392)\n\nDriver_IRQL_Not_Less_Or_Equal\n\n***Address BFF12392 base at BFF10000, Datestamp 3CCDEC2C - Teefer.sys\n\nThe 4.0 VPN Client Is Not Supported on Windows 95\n\nThe VPN Client for Windows, Release 4.0, requires the use of the Windows 98 or later operating system. We recommend updating your Operating system to a newer version of Windows (CSCea06231).\n\nVPN Client Not Supported on Windows NT Servers\n\nThe VPN Client is not supported on any Windows NT server version (including Windows 2000 and Windows XP/.NET/2003 servers). Only Windows NT 4.0 Workstation and Windows 2000 Workstation are the supported platforms.\n\nNo Limit to Size of Log File\n\nWhen logging is enabled on the VPN Client, all of the log files are placed in the Program Files\\Cisco Systems\\VPN Client\\logs directory and are date and time stamped. There is no limit to the size of the log when logging is enabled. The file will continue to grow in size until logging is disabled or the VPN Client program is closed. The log is still available for viewing until the VPN Client program is re-launched, at which time the display on the log tab and log window are cleared (CSCdy87504). The log file remains on the system and a new log file is created when the VPN Client, with logging enabled, is launched.\n\nStart Before Logon and Microsoft Certificate with Private Key Protect Fails\n\nTrying to connect the VPN client using Start Before Logon (SBL) and Microsoft Machine-based certificates fails. This is a Microsoft issue, not a VPN Client problem.\n\nIf your certificate has private key protection enabled, every time you use the certificate keys you are either prompted for a password to access the key, or notified with a dialog and asked to click OK.\n\nThe prompt displayed when using a certificate with private key protection appears on the Windows Desktop. You do not see this message while at the \"Logon\" desktop, therefore the VPN Client cannot gain the access to the certificate needed to connect.\n\nUse one of the following workarounds:\n\n• Get a certificate without private key protection (just make sure it is machine-based, otherwise it won't be accessible before logging on).\n\n• Instead of using Start Before Logon, log on to the PC using cached credentials, make the VPN connection, and— using the \"stay connected at logoff\" feature—logoff/logon with the VPN established to complete the domain logon (CSCea03349).\n\nDowngrading VPN Client from Release 4.0 Causes Start Before Logon Failure\n\nStart Before Logon fails if the VPN Client is downgraded from Release 4.0 to 3.6. The reason for this is that the file csgina.dll is upgraded when the VPN Client version 4.0 is installed. If the VPN Client is downgraded to version 3.6, the csgina.dll file for version 4.0 is not replaced, and this breaks ability in the VPN Client version 3.6 to Start Before Logon (CSCea03685).\n\nFollow this procedure to drop back to the VPN Client version 3.6 from version 4.0.\n\nStep 1 Uninstall the VPN Client version 4.0.\n\nStep 2 After rebooting, search for csgina.dll. This file is found in the System32 directory.\n\nStep 3 Rename csgina.dll to something like csgina.old.\n\nStep 4 Install the VPN Client version 3.6.\n\nLinksys Wireless AP Cable/DSL Router Version 1.44 or Higher Firmware Requirement\n\nTo use the VPN Client behind a Linsksys Wireless AP Cable/DSL router model BEFW11S4, the Linksys router must be running version 1.44 or higher firmware. The VPN Client cannot connect when located behind a Linsksys Wireless AP Cable/DSL router model BEFW11S4 running version 1.42.7 firmware. The VPN Client may see the prompt for username/password, then it disappears (CSCdz52156).\n\nFaultlog.txt File Logs Severity 1 Events\n\nThe faultlog.txt file is created when severity 1 events occur. It logs only severity 1 events. All severity 1 log messages go to the logs and also to faultlog.txt. This file exists in the installation directory of the VPN Client.\n\nThe advantage that the faultlog.txt file provides is that messages are logged even when the log viewer is not running. For example, errors during service initialization can't be logged to the log viewer, because these errors happen even before the service has attached itself to the log viewer.\n\nCertificates exported from Netscape 7 do not import into the VPN Client Macintosh Version\n\nThis incompatibility exists with Netscape 7.0 and the Release 3.7.x Macintosh versions of the VPN Client. Netscape 7.0 uses the latest RSA libraries that are not compatible with the previous RSA libraries that the Clients are using. Previous versions of Netscape are still compatible with the VPN Client.\n\nTo work around this issue, export the certificate using a browser other than Netscape 7.\n\nOn the Mac OS X platform, Internet Explorer 5.2 that comes installed does not allow certificates to be exported. The best course of action for these users is to either enroll and export the certificate from a Windows workstation and email it to the Mac user or to use direct enrollment from the Client itself.\n\nVerisign works fine with the Macintosh version of the VPN Client. But the \"browsers\" available on the Macintosh don't export certificates (Verisign or others) in the proper format for the VPN Client to receive them, or they don't allow the export of certificates at all (IE). This is because IE is a Windows product and doesn't support on the Macintosh platform everything the normal Windows IE does (CSCdz23397).\n\nVPN Client Can Require Smart Card When Using Certificates\n\nFor Windows 2000 and Windows XP systems, you can configure the VPN Client to require the presence of a Smart Card when Certificates are used. If this feature is configured, the VPN Client displays an error message if a Smart Card is not present. The Certificates need not be present on the Smart Card itself. To configure this feature, add the following line to the user's client profile, specifying the appropriate vendor for your Smart Card:\n\nSmartCardName=<Name of Smart Card Vendor>\n\nIf you are using pre-shared keys instead of Certificates, this requirement is not enforced, even if configured.\n\nTo disable the Smart Card verification function, completely delete the entry: SmartCardName=<text> from the user's client profile (CSCec82220).\n\nVPN Client GUI Connection History Display Lists Certificate Used\n\nIn Release 4.0.3.C, the VPN Client GUI connection history dialog box now displays as the first entry the name of the certificate used for establishing the connection (CSCec79691).\n\nUse Zone Labs Integrity Server 2.1.052.0 or Higher with VPN Client 4.0\n\nVersions of the Zone Labs Integrity Server earlier than 2.1.052.0 exhibit the following problem. If two or more VPN Clients (running on Windows 2000 or XP) are connected to a VPN 3000 Series Concentrator and receive firewall policy from a ZoneLabs Integrity Server, the Integrity Server registers only one connection.\n\nOn the Integrity Flex (client agent), under \"Policies\", the \"Integrity Server\" column flashes \"Connected\" then \"Disconnected\" over and over. Also, the VPN Client log includes the following event: \"The firewall, configured for Client/Server, returned a status of lost connection to server.\" Zone Labs Integrity Server version 2.1.052.0 fixes this issue (CSCea66549).\n\nRestart VPN Client Service If You Install VPN Client Before Zone Alarm\n\nThe Firewall Enhancement, \"Prevent VPN Traffic Blocking\", automatically adds the Loopback address (127.0.0.1) and the address of the VPN 3000 Concentrator to the ZoneAlarm or ZoneAlarmPro trusted zone.\n\nAn exception to this, however, occurs if the VPN Client is installed before Zone Alarm. Then the VPN Client's service must be restarted by rebooting the PC or stopping and restarting the service through the Control Panel (on Windows NT-based PCs) (CSCea16012).\n\nInstallShield Error Might occur during VPN Client Installation\n\nThe following error message might occur during VPN Client installation:\n\nIKernel.exe - Application Error\n\nThe instruction at \"0x771c741a\" referenced memory at \"0x00163648\". The memory could not be \"read\".\n\nThis error is caused by an InstallShield component, possibly because of a run-once stale remnant. To recover, you must reboot.\n\nThe InstallShield Knowledge base article q108020 addresses this problem. To view this article go to the following URL (CSCea43117):\n\nhttp://support.installshield.com/kb/view.asp?articleid=q108020\n\nMicrosoft has a fix for this issue. For more information and to obtain the fix, go to the following URL:\n\nhttp://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;329623\n\nVPN Client cTCP Connection Fails If Checkpoint Client Is Installed\n\nWhen the Checkpoint VPN-1 Securemote client is installed with the 4.0 VPN Client, and the VPN Client attempts to connect using cTCP, the 4.0 VPN Client cannot make the connection. Connections do work with UDP, NAT-T, and non-NAT connections.\n\nTo make a connection with cTCP when the Checkpoint VPN-1 Securemote is installed, you must disable the Check Point SecuRemote driver in the Connections Properties. To do this, you must be administrator. Follow these steps:\n\nStep 1 Click Start > Settings > Control Panel >Network and Dial-up Connections.\n\nStep 2 Select the Local Area Connection you use.\n\nStep 3 Click on File > Properties.\n\nStep 4 Uncheck Check Point SecuRemote, and click OK.\n\n(CSCea31192)\n\nOpen Caveats\n\nCaveats describe unexpected behavior or defects in Cisco software releases. The following lists are sorted by identifier number.\n\nNote If you have an account with CCO, you can use Bug Navigator II to find caveats of any severity for any release. To reach Bug Navigator II on CCO, choose Software & Support: Online Technical Support: Software Bug Toolkit or navigate to http://www.cisco.com/cgi-bin/Support/Bugtool/launch_bugtool.pl.\n\nThis section lists open caveats for the VPN Client running on a Windows platform.\n\n• CSCdt07491\n\nThe VPN Client may swap Primary and Secondary WINS received from the Concentrator. In a few cases, the VPN Client receives a Primary and a Secondary WINS server from the Concentrator but swaps them when they are added to the IP Configuration. If this happens, it may cause browsing problems if the Secondary WINS server is not as populated as the Primary. Disconnecting and reconnecting may fix the problem.\n\n• CSCdt07673\n\nWhen the VPN Client is installed on a Windows 2000 PC with the Efficient Networks NTS EnterNet 300 PPPoE version 1.41 or 1.5c, the following message appears:\n\n\"EnterNet could not find the (adapter) for complete pc management NIC (adapter). But it did locate the (adapter) for complete pc management NIC (adapter) - Deterministic Network Enhancer Miniport adapter through which your network server is reachable. Do you want to switch to this adapter?\"\n\nAnswer Yes every time this question appears. The installation then continues normally.\n\nA similar message appears on Windows NT 4.0. The message is:\n\n\"EnterNet could not find the (adapter). But it did locate the (adapter) through which your network server is reachable. Do you want to switch? Yes No\"\n\nAnswer Yes to this question. The installation then continues normally.\n\nIf the VPN Client is uninstalled, the next time the NTS EnterNet 300 PPPoE version 1.41 is used the message, \"EnterNet could not find the (adapter). But it did locate the (adapter) through which your network server is reachable. Do you want to switch? Yes No\"\n\nAnswer Yes to this question. The installation then continues normally.\n\n• CSCdt07787\n\nProblems have occurred when an ISA legacy NIC card (IBM Etherjet 10MB) is used in a PC with PnP OS enabled. The WINS servers did not function correctly when a VPN Client connection was made. This could be an issue with other legacy NIC cards as well.\n\nThe end results are that the WINS servers sent from the Secure Gateway cannot be viewed in the Network configuration, and problems with browsing/logon over the VPN connection may occur.\n\nWorkaround:\n\nDisable PnP OS in the PC's BIOS or statically configure the WINS servers.\n\n• CSCdt13380\n\nWhen you connect the VPN Client to a VPN 3000 Concentrator that issues two DNS servers, both appear under ipconfig /all, but only one appears under the Network settings TCP/IP Properties. DNS server appears to be missing under TCP/IP Properties (Advanced button, DNS TAB). We do not know whether this causes any problems.\n\n• CSCdt56343\n\nYou might see the following problem on systems running Windows NT and Windows 2000 when you are using the Start Before Logon feature of the VPN Client with third-party dialer. If the third-party dialer does not get set to the foreground when launched, add the following parameter to the vpnclient.ini file in the VPN Client directory (\\Program Files\\Cisco Systems\\VPN Client\\Profiles):\n\n[main]\n\nTopMostDelay=2500\n\nThe value is the time in milliseconds that the VPN Client waits for the third party dialer to load before attempting to place it in the foreground. The default time is 1000 milliseconds.\n\nWorkaround:\n\nFor problem dialers/applications, try 2500 milliseconds or greater.\n\n• CSCdu22174\n\nSCEP enrollment might fail to complete successfully after the PKI administrator has granted your request.\n\nWorkaround:\n\nIf this happens, delete your failed request and submit a new one.\n\nTo delete the request, click the Certificate tab, select the failed request, and click Delete on the toolbar. Alternatively, open the Certificates menu and select Delete.\n\n• CSCdu50445\n\nThe following issue can exist when using the VPN Client Start Before Logon feature with Entrust SignOn. Entrust SignOn is an add-on to the Entrust Entelligence client that allows logging into the Entrust profile and the NT domain from a single login.\n\nThe Entrust SignOn GINA dll does not support chaining to other GINA dll files. To make the Entrust SignOn product and the VPN Client with Start Before Logon function properly together, install the VPN Client after Entrust SignOn. The VPN Client replaces the Entrust GINA (etabcgin.dll) with its own (csgina.dll).\n\n• CSCdu62275\n\nVPN Client and Entrust Entelligence - VPN Connection timeout.\n\nIn version 3.1, the potential exists for the VPN Client Connection Manager and the VPN dialer to get out of sync with each other. This occurs only after a VPN Client upgrade on the first time the VPN Client accesses a given Entrust profile. The following sequence outlines how a user could get the connection into this state:\n\nStep 1 In the VPN dialer, the user clicks Connect.\n\nStep 2 Entrust prompts for password and security hash check. The user clicks Yes.\n\nStep 3 Entrust prompts for password for cvpnd.exe security access.\n\nIf the user waits here or walks away from PC, the VPN Connection times out in 3 minutes.\n\nStep 4 The user returns and enters the Entrust password, then clicks Yes to the security hash check question.\n\nStep 5 The VPN connection completes, and data can be passed. The VPN dialer appears as not connected.\n\nStep 6 Clicking Connect returns \"A connection already exists\". The user clicks Cancel, and the dialer appears connected in the system tray.\n\nThe VPN connection can be used as a normal connection.\n\n• CSCdu70660\n\nThis issue occurs on a Windows NT PC that is running ZoneAlarm or Sygate Personal Firewall, if the VPN Client is set to Start Before Logon and an upgrade to the VPN Client is implemented. Do not attempt a connection before the logon when you reboot, because both firewalls do not automatically give the VPN Client permission to access the Internet. Both firewalls see the upgrade as a new application attempting to access the Internet, and it requires user permission through its pop-up menus. The user must logon to the Windows NT PC using cached credentials, then launch a VPN connection. The firewall then asks permission to allow the VPN Client to connect. Answer yes to each connection. After that, Start Before Logon works fine.\n\n• CSCdu77405\n\nThe message, \"The necessary VPN sub-system is not available. You will not be able to make a connection to the remote IPSec server.\" might appear on a PC when Start Before Logon is enabled on the Client and ZoneAlarm is also running. The message appears when the ctrl+alt+del key combination is pressed. This has happened because the Cisco Systems VPN Service has terminated unexpectedly.\n\nWorkaround:\n\nLogon to the PC with cached credentials, open \"Services\" in control panel and start the VPN service. A connection to the VPN Concentrator will be possible once the service has started.\n\n• CSCdu81905\n\nWhen connecting to a VPN 3000 Concentrator over PPPoE using the EnterNet 300 client software from Efficient Networks, Inc., if a firewall is required by the VPN Concentrator, the following message might appear:\n\n\"The Client did not match any of the Concentrator's firewall configurations...\"\n\nIf this message appears, click OK and then click Connect. The connection to the VPN Concentrator then proceeds successfully.\n\n• CSCdu83054\n\nIf you make connections from the command line interface, the following problem can occur. When a firewall is required to connect and the firewall fails or is shut down, you do not see any message giving the reason for the lost connection.\n\n• CSCdu86399\n\nIf you use the VPN Client with a Digital Certificate and your Client sits behind a Cable/DSL router or some other NAT device, you might not be able to connect to your VPN Gateway device (that is, the VPN 3000 Concentrator). The problem is not with the VPN Client or the Gateway; it is with the Cable/DSL router. When the VPN Client uses a Digital Certificate, it sends the Certificate to the VPN Gateway. Most of the time, the packet with the Certificate is too big for a standard Ethernet frame (1500), so it is fragmented. Many Cable/DSL routers do not transmit fragmented packets, so the connection negotiation fails (IKE negotiation).\n\nThis problem might not occur if the Digital Certificate you are using is small enough, but this is only in rare cases. This fragmentation problem happens with the D-Link DI-704 and many other Cable/DSL routers on the market. We have been in contact with a few of these vendors to try to resolve the issue.\n\nTesting with the VPN Client Release 3.1 indicates that VPN Client connections using Digital Certificates can be made using the following Cable/DSL routers with the following firmware:\n\nLinksys BEFSRxx v1.39 or v1.40.1\n\nSMC 7004BR Barricade R1.93e\n\nNexland Pro400 V1 Rel 3M\n\nNetGear RT314 V3.24(CA.0)\n\nAsante FR3004 V2.15 or later\n\nOthers like 3COM 3C510, and D-Link DI-704 either had updated firmware that was tested and failed, or had Beta firmware that was NOT tested because the firmware notes did not indicate a fix specifically for fragmentation.\n\n• CSCdu87521\n\nThe following message might appear when a connection using the EnterNet 300 version 1.4 PPPoE software and transferring via FTP:\n\n93 09:42:06.020 08/02/01 Sev=Warning/2 IPSEC/0xE3700002\n\nFunction CniInjectSend() failed with an error code of 0xe4510000 (IPSecDrvCB:517)\n\nThis does not interfere with your connection. You can ignore this message.\n\n• CSCdv40009\n\nWhen Zone Alarm's Internet setting is set to high and the VPN Concentrator sends a CPP firewall policy that allows inbound traffic on a specific port, the CPP rule takes precedence over the Zone Alarm rule allowing the specified port to be open.\n\n• CSCdv42414\n\nImporting a PKCS12 (*.p12 or *.pfx) certificate using the Certificate Manager that has not been password protected will fail with the following error:\n\n\"Please make sure your import password and your certificate protection password (if for file based enrollment) are correct and try again.\"\n\nWorkaround:\n\nGet a *.p12 certificate that has been password protected.\n\n• CSCdv44529\n\nAttempting to install/uninstall Gemplus Workstation version 2.x or earlier while the Cisco VPN Client and its GINA (csgina.dll) is installed will cause the following error, and Gemplus will not install/uninstall:\n\n\"A 3rd party GINA has been detected on your system. Please uninstall it before installing this product.\"\n\nWorkaround:\n\nDo one of the following:\n\n– Uninstall the VPN Client and reinstall it after Gemplus software.\n\nor\n\n– Use Gemplus version 3.0.30 that no longer installs the gemgina.dll\n\n• CSCdv46591\n\nWhen a CPP Firewall policy is in place that drops all inbound and outbound traffic and no WINS address is sent to the VPN Client from the 3000 series Concentrator, Start Before Logon fails. If a WINS address is in place, Start Before Logon works fine. Also, if a WINS address is sent and the CPP rule drops all inbound traffic, but allows all outbound traffic, Start Before Logon works fine.\n\n• CSCdv46937\n\nUsing the Aladdin \"R2\" model etoken, certain functions can be performed using the certificate even after the R2 token has been detached from the system (USB port). The VPN Client, for instance, can perform an IKE rekey without the token attached to the system. The reason for this is the design of the \"R2\" etoken: it does not contain the RSA key functions needed and must upload the private key to the system for these functions.\n\nIn contrast, the Aladdin \"PRO\" etoken must be connected to the USB port during an IKE rekey, otherwise the VPN Client connection terminates. This is Aladdin's problem; it is not a VPN Client problem.\n\n• CSCdv55730\n\nUsing the Solaris VPN Client, some applications are unable to operate properly. A possible indicator of the problem is that a large ping is unable to pass through the VPN Tunnel.\n\nNo problem exists when passing large packets using cTcp or normal IPSec. When using IPSec over UDP, Path MTU Discovery problems exist, as a result of which large packets cannot be transmitted.\n\nAn MTU issue currently exists with the Solaris VPN Client that causes fragmentation errors that might affect applications passing traffic through the VPN Tunnel.\n\nTo identify whether the VPN Client is properly fragmenting packets, use the following commands:\n\nping -n <known good ping target address>\n\nping -n -s <known good ping target address> 2500\n\nThe first command ensures that the target is reachable, and the second determines whether fragmentation is an issue.\n\nWorkaround:\n\nStep 1 Before opening the tunnel, bring down the MTU of the point-to-point interface to the MTU of the rest of the path to the concentrator (generally 1500). This would allow large packets to pass through, when using IPSec over UDP. No problems exist when using normal IPSec or cTcp.\n\nStep 2 Set IP Compression to \"LZS\" in the VPN Group on the Concentrator. This decreases the size of the encrypted packet and might allow the smaller packet to avoid fragmentation. If you are using NAT, switching the NAT method of the client from cTCP (TunnelingMode=1) to UDP (TunnelingMode=0) might also reduce the size of the packet.\n\n• CSCdv62613\n\nWhen you have multiple VPN Client connections behind Linksys Cable/DSL router, the following problem can occur. Due to a Linksys problem with firmware versions 1.39 and 1.40.1, making multiple VPN Client connections enabling the feature \"Allow IPSec over UDP\" (transparent tunneling) may cause data transfer problems.\n\nAllow IPSec over UDP is a VPN Client feature that allows ESP packets to be encapsulated in UDP packets so they traverse firewall and NAT/PAT devices. Some or all of the clients may not be able to send data. This is due to a Linksys port mapping problem, that Linksys has been notified of.\n\nWorkaround:\n\nUse a newer version of Linksys code (higher than firmware version 1.40.1). If you must use one of the problem versions, do not use the \"Allow IPSec over UDP\" (transparent tunneling) feature when you have multiple VPN Client connections behind Linksys Cable/DSL router.\n\n• CSCdv67594\n\nThe following Microsoft Outlook error might occur when the VPN Client connects or disconnects. This occurs when Microsoft Outlook is installed but not configured.\n\nEither there is no default mail client or the current mail client cannot fulfill the messaging request. Pun Microsoft Outlook and set it as the default mail client.\n\nTo set Microsoft Outlook as the default mail client, right-click on the Outlook icon, go to Properties, and configure it to use Microsoft Exchange or Internet Mail.\n\n• CSCdv73541\n\nThe make module process fails during installation of the VPN Client for Linux.\n\nWorkaround:\n\nThe module build process must use the same configuration information as your running kernel. To work around this problem, do one of the following:\n\n– If you are running the kernels from Red Hat, you must install the corresponding kernel-sources rpm. On a Red Hat system with kernel-sources installed, there is a symlink from /lib/modules/2.4.2-2/build to the source directory. The VPN Client looks for this link first, and it should appear as the default value at the kernel source prompt.\n\n– If you are running your own kernel, you must use the build tree from the running kernel to build the VPN Client. Merely unpacking the source code for the version of the kernel you are running is insufficient.\n\n• CSCdw60866\n\nGetting Entrust certificates using SCEP does not get the Root CA certificate. The Entrust CA does not send the whole certificate chain when enrolling with SCEP. Therefore, making a VPN Client connection might require the manual installation of the Root certificate before or after SCEP enrollment. Without the existence of the Root CA certificate, the VPN Client fails to validate the certificate and fails with the following VPN Client event/error messages:\n\n\"Get certificate validity failed\"\n\n\"System Error: Unable to perform validation of certificate <certificate_name>.\"\n\n• CSCdw73886\n\nIf an attempt to load the VPN Client is made before the Clients Service loads, the following error occurs: \"The necessary VPN sub-system is not available. You will not be able to make a connection to the remote IPSec server.\"\n\nWorkaround:\n\nWait until the Service has loaded, then start the VPN Client.\n\n• CSCdx04343\n\nA customer had problems enrolling the Mac OS version of the VPN Client. Following some troublesome attempts at debugging the enrollment of the MacOS VPN Client with a Baltimore CA, it was felt that the Documentation should be improved and the Certificate Manager enhanced.\n\nWorkaround:\n\nIt seems that the critical thing as far as Baltimore is concerned is to put either or both of the challenge phrase (-chall) and the host's FQDN (-dn) in the request. This appears to be similar for the successful SCEP enrolment in a Verisign Onsite PKI. Perhaps there's a case for tweaking the interface a bit, or at least making some notes in the manual!\n\nJust doing cisco_cert_mgr -U -op enroll only asks for a Common Name, which is not enough. The request that succeeded on two separate Baltimore installations, one of which had an expired RA certificate, was as follows (switches only shown for brevity):\n\ncisco_cert_mgr -U -op enroll -cn -ou -o -c -caurl -cadn -chall -dn\n\nThe ou is required for connecting to a Cisco 3030 VPN Concentrator and is the group name. On almost every attempt, the certificate manager dies after starting to poll the CA, with an error in the log: \"Could not get data portion of HTTP request\".\n\nIf this happens, it is possible to resume the enrollment with cisco_cert_mgr -E -op enroll_resume. The last attempt didn't fail at all though, and the certificate manager kept running until the request was approved, which is how it should behave.\n\n• CSCdx51632\n\nIf the computer is powered off or loses power during an MSI installation of the VPN Client, the VPN Client may not be registered in Control Panel, and the following may occur when attempting to reinstall:\n\n– A message may appear stating:\n\nDeterministic Network Enhancer Add Plugin Failed\n\nClick the \"OK\" button.\n\n– Error 1722. There is a problem with this Windows Installer package. A program as part of the setup did not finish as expected. Contact your Support personnel or package vendor. Click the \"OK\" button.\n\n– Error 1101. Error reading from file c:\\config.msi\\laff4.rbs. Verify that the file exits and you can access it. Click the \"OK\" button.\n\n– Error 1712. One or more of the files required to restore your computer to its previous state could not be found. Restoration is not possible. Click the \"OK\" button.\n\nAfter clearing the last message box, restart MSI installation. It should successfully install the VPN Client.\n\n• CSCdx57197\n\nIf IOS sends a split tunnel attribute that is host-based (255.255.255.255 mask), the VPN Client uses the host in a QM, but it passes the IPV4_ADDR_SUBNET in the ID payload.\n\nIOS expects IPV4_ADDR, as this is a host ID. This causes connectivity issues.\n\n• CSCdx70223\n\nThe VPN Client's xauth dialog always stays in the foreground so it doesn't get \"lost\" (on XP it goes to the background and then jumps forward within seconds). The xauth dialog does not have focus, however, and it can be difficult to enter the username/password without first clicking on it with the mouse. This was observed on Windows 2000 and Windows XP; we have not checked Windows 98.\n\n• CSCdx72463\n\nInstalling the VPN Client using the Microsoft Windows Installer (MSI) displays \"Time Remaining\" for the installation. This time is not very accurate and should be ignored.\n\n• CSCdx77292\n\nMicrosoft article Q234859 states that for the resiliency feature to work on Windows 4.0, IE 4.01 sp1 and shell32.dll version 4.72.3110.0 or greater must be installed on the computer.\n\n• CSCdx78868\n\nThe Microsoft Installer (MSI) resiliency (self healing) feature does not restore all files that are installed with the VPN Client. The files that will be restored are files that are associated with the shortcuts under Start | Program Files | Cisco Systems VPN Client.\n\n• CSCdx81491\n\nAn issue can occur when using the Release 4.0VPN Client with Start Before Logon (SBL), after enabling SBL. The first time you log out of Windows, the VPN Client does not load after you press the CTRL+ALT+DEL key combination at the Windows logon prompt.\n\nWorkaround:\n\nReboot the PC after enabling Start Before Logon; after a subsequent logout, the VPN Client should operate properly.\n\n• CSCdx83687\n\nThe following error occurs after the resiliency feature has reinstalled a missing file on Windows NT 4.0:\n\nc:\\winnt\\profiles\\all users\\start menu\\programs\\cisco systems vpnclient\\xxx.lnk\n\nThe Windows installer failed to install the program associated with this file.\n\nPlease contact your system administrator.\n\nxxx.lnk is whatever file is being restored.\n\nWhen you click OK, the PC reboots and the file is restored. The resiliency feature is working, but the error should not appear.\n\n• CSCdx88063\n\nWhen attempting to launch the dialer when the dialer is already running on the logon desktop (due to SBL or SBL and AI), the following error occurs instead of the VPN Client dialer loading:\n\n\"Single dialer instance event creation failed with error 5.\"\n\nThis is most likely to happen when Start Before Logon and Auto Initiate are being used on a Windows NT/2000/XP system.\n\nWorkaround:\n\nThis is due to the fact that the VPN Client dialer is already running on the \"logon desktop\". Most likely during Windows logon the dialer launched and posted an error, the Windows logon was completed and the error was never closed. To work around this error, do the following:\n\nStep 1 Press CTRL+ALT+DEL to get to the logon desktop.\n\nStep 2 Look for and close any VPN Client error dialogs.\n\nStep 3 Press ESC to return to the normal Windows desktop; the VPN Client should load normally.\n\n• CSCdy14218\n\nDuring installation of the VPN Client on a PC that already has the Enternet v.1.5c or v. 1.5c SP2, the following error might appear:\n\n\"SVCHOST.EXE has generated errors and will be closed by Windows.\"\n\nWorkaround:\n\nIf this message appears, click OK, then reboot the PC when the VPN Client prompts for the reboot. After this, The message does not reappear and all connections work fine.\n\n• CSCdy50648\n\nInstallShield's \"Tuner\" application produces warnings and errors when validating the Cisco MSI installation package.\n\n• CSCdy68888\n\nOn a Windows 98 PC that has the Sygate Personal Firewall, the following message may appear in the VPN Client log file:\n\n\"Packet size greater than ip header\"\n\nThis message does not interfere with the VPN Client's ability to pass data and can be ignored.\n\n• CSCdy70168\n\nA user with the VPN Client cannot establish an IPSec tunnel to a VPN Concentrator running over an Internet satellite connection.\n\nThere are three observed results:\n\n– User is never prompted for XAUTH username and password.\n\n– After successfully authenticating, the user cannot transmit/receive any data.\n\n– After successfully transmitting data for approximately 5 minutes, the VPN session is disconnected regardless of the user activity at the time of disconnect.\n\nThis problem occurs only if IPSec over TCP is used.\n\nWorkaround:\n\nUse IPSec over UDP.\n\n• CSCdy79358\n\nThe following error might occur on Windows 98 when making many VPN connections without closing the VPN Client between connections:\n\nVPNGUI caused an invalid page fault in module MSVCRT.DLL at 0167:78002f52.\n\nTo avoid this error, exit the VPN Client after disconnecting.\n\n• CSCdz48584\n\nThe VPN Client on Windows XP using native XP PPPoE client fails to connect when using IPSec/TCP.\n\nWorkaround:\n\nMake sure that the Windows XP Internet Connection Firewall is disabled for the PPPoE connection. This feature defaults to enabled when the connection entry is created. To disable it do the following:\n\nStep 1 Run Control Panel, then click on Network Connections.\n\nStep 2 Right click on the PPPoE connection entry (may be called \"Broadband\") and select \"Properties\".\n\nStep 3 Change to the Advanced Tab and uncheck the \"Internet Connection Firewall\" option.\n\n• CSCdz56076\n\nSome AOL applications might not be usable while a 4.0 VPN Client connection is active. These include the AOL integrated web browser and some internal links. Using external web browsers and other applications should work over the VPN. These issues were seen most recently using AOL version 7.0 and 8.0.\n\n• CSCdz71367\n\nTo connect to a VPN 3000 Concentrator requiring Sygate Personal Firewall, Sygate Personal Firewall Pro, using Are You There (AYT), the version of the firewall must be 5.0, build 1175 or later. The VPN Client might not detect an earlier version of the Sygate Personal Firewall and therefore, a connection will not be allowed.\n\n• CSCdz74310\n\nAfter upgrading, the VPN Client is unable to connect to the VPN 3000 Concentrator. The ability for the VPN Client to negotiate an AES-192 IKE Proposal has been removed. This change affects all VPN Client versions greater than 3.7.2.\n\nWorkaround:\n\nReconfigure the VPN Concentrator so that it does not require an AES-192 IKE Proposal for VPN Client connections.\n\n• CSCdz75892\n\nThe Equant remote access dialer does not automatically connect the Release 4.0 VPN Client, as it could when using the Release 3.x VPN Client. If you have the Equant dialer configured to establish your VPN connection, the VPN Client appears, but you must manually click Connect to connect. An updated, Cisco-specific .dll file is available from Equant to fix this problem.\n\n• CSCdz87404\n\nThe 4.0 VPN Client (on Windows 2000 or Windows XP) connects but is unable to pass data over the VPN tunnel. Viewing the routing table using \"route print\" at a command prompt shows the default gateway has been modified incorrectly as in the example below.\n\n0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 n.n.n.n n.n.n.n 1\n\nWhere n.n.n.n is the IP address assigned to the VPN.\n\nWorkaround:\n\nThis is due to a misconfiguration on the VPN3000 at the central site. Make sure that the Group | Client Config settings for Split Tunneling Policy are correct. If the group is set to \"Only tunnel networks in the list\" and the Split Tunneling Network List is the predefined \"VPN CLient Local LAN\" list this problem will occur.\n\nIf split tunneling is the desired result, change the Split Tunneling Network List to an appropriate list, otherwise make sure that the Split Tunneling Policy is set to \"Tunnel Everything\" and check \"Allow the networks in the list to bypass the tunnel\". This allows for proper Local LAN function.\n\n• CSCea03597\n\nWhen the VPN Client is installed and Start before Logon is configured, logging into an Active Directory Domain might take a long time, with or without a VPN connection.\n\nThis issue occurs under the following conditions:\n\n– The VPN Client is installed on Windows 2000 or Windows XP Professional.\n\n– You have enabled \"Start before Logon\" in the VPN Client.\n\n– You are logging in to a Windows Active Directory domain (not an NT 4 Domain).\n\nWorkaround:\n\nThis problem occurs because of a fix that was added for CSCdu20804. This fix adds the following parameter to the registry every time Start before Logon is enabled:\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\NetLogon\\Parameters\n\nExpectedDialupDelay\n\nRemoving \"ExpectedDialupDelay\" from the registry (then rebooting) should fix the problem with slow logons to an Active Directory Domain.\n\nNote If you disable, then re-enable Start before Logon, this entry is added again and must be removed.\n\n• CSCea16482\n\nIf the Digital Certificate you are using has expired, the Windows VPN Client GUI does not popup with an error message indicating it has expired. The only indication you have is in the log file.\n\nA message does appear if you are using the VPN Client command line - vpnclient.exe\n\n• CSCea17705\n\nIf a ZoneLabs product such as ZoneAlarm or ZoneAlarm Pro is installed on the PC and the VPN Client is installed or upgraded, ZoneAlarm blocks the VPN Client service (cvpnd.exe). The VPN Client's splash screen appears, but the GUI does not. ZoneAlarm does not ask the user whether to allow the VPN Client to access the Internet. Additionally, the following error appears after about two minutes:\n\n\"The necessary VPN sub-system is not available. You can not connect to the remote VPN server.\"\n\nWorkaround:\n\nDo the following steps:\n\nStep 1 Open the ZoneLabs product and select \"Program Control\".\n\nStep 2 Click on the \"Programs\" Tab\n\nStep 3 Cisco Systems VPN Client's Access permission is a ?. Click under \"Trusted\" and select \"Allow\". The ? mark changes change to a Check mark.\n\nStep 4 Reboot the PC.\n\nStep 5 When the PC boots back up, the client will launch normally.\n\n• CSCea25682\n\nThe following Notification might occur if the Cisco Systems Integrated Client is required to make a connection:\n\n\"The Client did not match the firewall configured on the central site VPN device. Cisco Systems Integrated Client should be enabled or installed on your computer.\"\n\nWhen this occurs, the connection is not allowed. If this Notification appears, click Close and attempt to reconnect. If this second attempt to connect fails, reboot the PC. The connection should succeed at this point.\n\n• CSCea27524\n\nThis problem has two facets. You cannot select text from the VPN Client log tab, and trying to save the VPN Client log results in an empty (zero byte) file. This problem might occur if the VPN Client logging has been enabled, disabled, or cleared.\n\nWorkaround:\n\nIf the all or part of the log must saved, you can select the text with the mouse or by using CTRL+A, and then copy it using CTRL+C. You can then paste it as usual using CTRL+V in Notepad or your favorite editor.\n\nAs an alternative, the VPN Client log files are saved to the directory c:\\Program Files\\Cisco Systems\\VPN Client\\Logs by default and can be opened and viewed using a text editor and saved as a different name if needed.\n\n• CSCea29976\n\nAfter the user enters the username and password, the VPN Client machine might go blank for a moment and then continue. This behavior has not shown any negative effect on the tunnel connection or the user's ability to use the PC.\n\n• CSCea44601\n\nThe VPN Client does not put any limit to the number of log files that are saved in the \\VPN Client\\Logs directory. Users must manually delete these files to remove all or some of them.\n\n• CSCea62229\n\nUsing the 4.0 VPN Client with Entrust Entelligence certificates, the \"Send CA Certificate Chain\" option should be grayed out and unavailable, but it is not.\n\nWorkaround:\n\nChecking the \"Send CA Certificate Chain\" option when using Entrust Entelligence certificates makes the VPN Client connection fail to complete, leave this option unchecked.\n\n• CSCea63957\n\nIf you uninstall the VPN Client from a Windows 2000 or Windows XP Computer with RASPPPOE, the following message box might appear:\n\nFailed to uninstall the Cisco Network Adaptor.\n\nError: 0xe000020b\n\nClick OK. The Client uninstallation then continues normally.\n\n• CSCea75956\n\nThe following problem has occurred with non-Windows VPN Clients. While connected to the VPN Client, DNS resolution to the internal network works at first but fails later in the connection.\n\nIf the workstation is set to use DHCP and receives a DNS address from the DHCP server, the new DNS overwrites the VPN Concentrator's pushed DNS that had been resolving internal network devices. Once the new DNS has overwritten the Concentrator-pushed DNS, internal devices are no longer resolved properly.\n\nWorkaround:\n\nAfter connecting to the ISP, record the DNS addresses assigned by the DHCP server and hard code them into the workstation. This prevents the workstation from accepting the DHCP-pushed DNS addresses in the future but still allows resolution when not connected over VPN.\n\nThe drawback of this is that if the ISP changes their DNS server addresses, the user must find out the hard way and hard code these new addresses once more.\n\n• CSCea92185\n\nThe PKCS#10 thumbprint for the certificate request is missing on 4.x VPN Client, so it is impossible for the CA to verify the user's request by comparing the thumbprint.\n\nWorkaround:\n\nDowngrade to 3.6.X VPN Client.\n\n• CSCea93535\n\nPerformance issues exist with H.323 and the 4.0 VPN Client virtual adapter. These performance issues could be related to MTU.\n\nWorkaround:\n\nTo use this workaround, you need to be running VPN Client Release 4.0.3.C or later. Set the Virtual Adapter MTU at the MAC layer to 1500 (default value is 1300). To do this, run the command \"SetMTU.exe /va 1500\", then re-establishing the tunnel. (A reboot is not required.) SetMTU.exe should be located in the VPN Client installation directory. Please use \"SetMTU.exe /?\" for other options.\n\n• CSCeb48663\n\nThe `vpnclient stat firewall' command cannot be run while not connected. This command should return the state of the firewall at all times, not just when the VPN Client is connected.\n\n• CSCeb68102\n\nCVPND does not free file handles when it disconnects from the VPN gateway. This might cause an out-of-resources situation. This problem occurred under Windows NT, running VPN Client version 4.0. No problem running with Windows 2000.\n\n• CSCeb83746\n\nThe following problem occurs when using the VPN Client, Release 4.0 running on MS Windows 2000 or Windows XP. After connecting, a \"classfull\" route is installed in the routing table, due to not receiving a subnet mask.\n\n• CSCec00525\n\nIPSec SA rekeying fails on VPN Client 4.0.2A/B. The VPN4.0.2A/B and IPSec SA Lifetime Measurement is configured as Data on the VPN 3000 Concentrator.\n\nWorkaround:\n\nUse Time Lifetime on the VPN 3000 Concentrator.\n\n• CSCec18923\n\nAfter the Cisco VPN Client is connected, the PC stops receiving the local multicast traffic. The \"Allow Local LAN Access\" check box is checked, and the multicast addresses are also included in the bypass list on the VPN 3000 Concentrator.\n\n• CSCec20680\n\nThe ForceNetLogin feature might not work properly with Entrust Intelligence client version 6.1.\n\n• CSCec22783\n\nVPN Client sends the first ESP packet after IKE negotiation is successful using an SPI number that doesn't exist. Then the central-site Concentrator sends back a delete notification, which the client ignores because the SPI doesn't actually exist in the VPN Client. This does not affect any functions.\n\n• CSCec30347\n\nA customer installed an RSA Keon CA server with root and subordinate CA. When we are using the VPN Client, Release 3.1 with the certificates, we can connect to VPN 3000 Concentrator running either 3.x or 4.0.1D (Concentrator code does not matter).\n\nOnce I upgrade the VPN Client to 3.6.x or 4.0.x, I can no longer get a connection to VPN 3000 Concentrator.\n\nI play around all the settings including \"check uncheck CA chain\" on the Client end, as well as the Concentrator end, \"Certificate Group Matching\", IKE group 1 or group2, no matter what I do, it does not work.\n\nWorkaround:\n\nDowngrade the VPN client to 3.1.\n\n• CSCed05004\n\nWith the VPN Client, Release 4.0.x installed on a Windows XP (tablet edition) system, whenever the VPN dialer is opened we get an error \"System Error: IPC Socket allocation failed with error ffffffff8h\" and then it cannot go out to the DHCP server and get an IP address.\n\n• CSCed11256\n\nWhen installing a customized VPN Client InstallPath, a pop-up box appears during the installation with the following message:\n\nUsage:\n\nVAInstaller i <INF Location> <HardwareID>\n\nr <HardwareID>\n\nf <HardwareID>\n\nOptions:\n\ni - installs the Virtual Adapter\n\nr - removes the Virtual Adapter\n\nf - finds if the Virtual Adapter in installed\n\nWorkaround:\n\nIf the installation path includes $BASEDIR\\Program Files\\, then the InstallPath works.\n\n• CSCed26068\n\nUsing VPN Client, Release 4.0.3.C running under Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows ME, we can not log in to the Microsoft network using the Command-Line Interface to connect VPN communication. NetBIOS packets fail to be encrypted.\n\n• CSCee08782\n\nMac OS X VPN Client Release 4.0.3.E and higher no longer supports Mac OS X 10.1.5. VPN Client Release 4.0.2.C is the last released client compatible with Mac OS X 10.1.5.\n\nWorkaround:\n\nInstall the Mac OS X VPN Client Release 4.0.2.C.\n\nCaveats Resolved in Release 4.0.5.D\n\nRelease 4.0.5.D resolves the following issues:\n\n• CSCed49306\n\nIf a user is member of at least 500 groups in the domain (Win2000), the VPN Client cannot open a connection. A message in the log says that the certificate could not be retrieved because the store is empty. The same user can connect without a problem if the number of groups he belongs to is less than 500.\n\n• CSCef69451\n\nAn error is generated on the VPN Client when trying to connect after a certificate renewal is performed:\n\n\"Error 31: The certificate \"User Name\" associated with this Connection Entry no longer exists or failed to open. Please select another certificate.\"\n\n• CSCef82642\n\nThe VPN Client software is unable to verify some user certificates.\n\n• CSCeg14196\n\nThis was introduced in 4.0.3.C. If the user has more than 10 certificates, and wants to select a certificate number 10 or higher, the wrong certificate is selected.\n\n• CSCeg30023\n\nThe VPN Client's DPD processing is correct, but it was logging the wrong DPD sequence number in the logs.\n\n• CSCsa41980\n\nIn rare cases in which IKE packets are fragmented and received out of order, it is possible for the Cisco VPN Client to terminate abruptly.\n\n• CSCsa42416\n\nIf Netopia's NetOctopus is installed on the host, the Cisco VPN Client cannot disable the Virtual Adapter at tunnel disconnect.\n\nCaveats Resolved in Release 4.0.5.C\n\nRelease 4.0.5.C resolves the following issues:\n\n• CSCeb04745\n\nCan't Install the Virtual Adapter after removing a VPN 5000 client. This happens because some of the VPN 5000 Registry keys are not removed by the Uninstall.\n\n• CSCef84479\n\nClient fails when Sygate firewall is installed and the system is not configured with correct DNS servers.\n\nIf Ethernet or wireless is connected after logging into Windows and the DNS server is not reachable, you get warning201 on the GUI, and then you get the XAuth prompt. You are eventually connected, but after the connection, you cannot pass any traffic. But from the second connection onwards, everything works just fine.\n\n• CSCef89853\n\nThere is currently no way to differentiate certificates that have the same common name and reside in the same store. The VPN GUI does not allow users to associate a different certificate with same name in the profile.\n\n• CSCef93731\n\nThe parent suffix is not appended by VPN Client even if \"AppendOriginalSuffix\" value is present in vpnclient.ini under [DNS] section. This could be seen by a DEBUG log message that the correct value was present in vpnclient.ini. Windows network connection property pages also had the right checkbox selected to append the parent suffix.\n\nCaveats Resolved in Release 4.0.5.B\n\nRelease 4.0.5.B resolves the following issue:\n\n• CSCef46893\n\nWhen the VPN Client and the head-end device are using different subordinate digital certificates, IKE authentication fails.\n\nCaveats Resolved in Release 4.0.5.A\n\nRelease 4.0.5.A resolves the following issues:\n\n• CSCdz58488\n\nCisco-proprietary NAT Transparency can be enabled in environments where NAT/PAT is not used, but perhaps a firewall allows UDP but not ESP packets. The standards-based implementation does not allow for this option, since it is autodetecting the need for NAT transparency based on whether or not the client is in a NAT/PAT environment.\n\nRequesting a mechanism per profile to force use of NAT-T even if the VPN Client or VPN Concentrator do not detect that they are behind a NAT/PAT device.\n\n• CSCeb11271\n\nWhen trying to import a certificate, on the GUI, the \"Unable to import certificate\" message is displayed. A password has been provided when generating the Certificate request file. This password has been correctly re-entered in the \"Import Password\" field.\n\n• CSCeb15093\n\nWhen a connection is made with the VPN Client using a certificate in the Cisco store that does not contain a password, the GUI still prompts the user for a password. This problem happens only if the certificate is in Cisco store.\n\n• CSCec47637\n\nUsing the VPN Client with multiple-monitor display enabled on a Windows XP machine, the VPN Client authentication dialog box appears split between the two monitors rather than completely in one side or the other.\n\n• CSCed25166\n\nIf entrust certificates are used with the VPN Client, the Client writes the timeout values to entrust.ini file. The VPN Client deletes comments in the entrust.ini file when it writes the timeout values.\n\n• CSCee13237\n\nWhen fast user switching is enabled in Windows XP and multiple users log in, the VPN username/password prompt window always shows up in the first user's desktop. All other users cannot see this window when opening a VPN connection. They may think the VPN Client is stuck.\n\n• CSCef15043\n\nWhen connecting from the VPN Client to the VPN 3000 Concentrator, with Cisco Pushed Policy enabled, the Firewall tab on the VPN Client is disabled and is therefore unusable.\n\n• CSCef50703\n\nThe VPN Client cannot load a certificate that has an incorrect value for the CRL Distribution Point extension. Since this field is not used by the VPN Client, it should ignore this field.\n\nCaveats Resolved in Release 4.0.5\n\nRelease 4.0.5 resolves the following issues:\n\n• CSCed13978\n\nRebranding of the Cisco VPN Client (4.0.3) does not update the VPN Client title bar correctly and/or automatically. When the steps are followed, the VPN Client installation creates a folder called oem.ini and then put the actual \"oem.ini\" file within this folder.\n\nThe title bar is correctly rebranded if the oem.ini file is moved from the previously mentioned directory to the C:\\Program Files\\Cisco Systems\\VPN Client\\ folder (which is the default client installation folder) or whatever folder the client was installed on.\n\n• CSCee22560\n\nWhen the 4.0.3.F VPN Client is installed in a directory other than the default (C:\\Program Files\\Cisco Systems\\VPN Client), the virtual adapter can not be installed on Windows 2000 or Windows XP. The installation displays the following error message:\n\nFailed to install Cisco Network Adapter. Error: 0x3.\n\nPlease uninstall this client and try the install again.\n\n• CSCee88153\n\nIf the connection profile uses certificates, the VPN Client requires users to enter the CertSubjectName field in the profile. This happens to be fairly large, something like:\n\nCertSubjectName=cn=Test1,ou=rootou,o=cisco,l=city,st=state,c=US,e=some@email.com\n\nThe client should allow users to just enter the CertName field in the profile. The VPN Client should not force the use of SubjectName, as it is long and hard to enter in the profile. The CertName field for the above subject name looks like:\n\nCertName=Test1\n\n• CSCef17800\n\nIf you want the DNS suffix to be appended to the actual list, you will have to add AppendOriginalSuffix=1 in the vpnclient.ini file. Otherwise the existing DNS suffixes are overwritten by default. The purpose of this DDTS is to change this default.\n\nCaveats Resolved in Release 4.0.4.D\n\nRelease 4.0.4.D resolves the following issues:\n\n• CSCdv54087\n\nWhen connected over a PPP connection using any of the Linux, Solaris, or Mac VPN Clients, the Excluded networks do not allow traffic to the network directly connected to the workstations ethernet adapters.\n\nThe EnableLocalLan keyword combined with the proper Concentrator Group configuration should allow the client to pass traffic to the workstations local ethernet network. An issue with the client prevents traffic only to the network directly attached to the workstation. Other networks excluded from the tunnel pass traffic normally.\n\n• CSCea65854\n\nVPN Clients should exclude all local networks with wildcard push.\n\nThe VPN Client feature to push the 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 wildcard during the excluded networks negotiation only excludes the network currently connected to the VPN Concentrator. The client SHOULD be excluding ALL local interfaces and networks.\n\nIf a user has Ethernet and PPP and dials in to connect to a group with a wildcard exclude, they will only exclude th"
