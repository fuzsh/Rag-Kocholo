        "text": "The Los Angeles County Superior Court of California has jurisdiction over Los Angeles County and the City of Los Angeles. Serving over 9.5 million residents who live and work across the 4,080 square miles of LA County, the LA Superior Court is the largest single unified trial court in the United States that provides online case search tools for court records and public records.\n\nIn its mission statement, the Los Angeles Superior Court notes that it is \"dedicated to serving our community by providing equal access to justice through the fair, timely and efficient resolution of all cases.\"\n\nTo fulfill its mission to provide equal access to justice, the Superior Court operates approximately 40 courthouses and 600 courtrooms across LA, including specialized courts such as the Drug Court, Proposition 36 Court, Homeless Court, Informal and Juvenile Traffic Court, and the Juvenile Mental Health Court. The LA Court is also broken up into 9 divisions to help with case efficiency: Appellate, Civil, Criminal, Family Law, Juvenile, Mental Health, Probate, Small Claims, and Traffic.\n\nSome of the most popular courthouses in Los Angeles are the Stanley Mosk Courthouse at the Los Angeles Civic Center, the Airport Courthouse, the Spring Street Courthouse, the Metropolitan Courthouse, and the Beverly Hills Courthouse.\n\nThe Executive Officer and Clerk of the Court for Los Angeles County Superior Courts is Sherri R. Carter, located at 111 N. Hill Street, Rm 105E, Los Angeles, CA 90012. You can reach the Clerk of Court's office by calling (213) 830-0801 or faxing (442) 247-3741.\n\nThe Presiding Judge for Los Angeles County Superior Courts is Eric C. Taylor, located at 111 N. Hill Street, Rm 204, Los Angeles, CA 90012. You can reach the Presiding Judge's office by calling the same number as the Clerk of Court at (213) 830-0801 or by faxing (213) 680-1263.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Superior Court's website only lets you search cases for free by using case numbers. But if you want to search by a party's name, they charge you up to $4.75 per search, which can quickly become expensive if you need to do multiple searches or accidentally type in the wrong name into the search bar.\n\nWith UniCourt, you can lookup LA Superior Court cases online by using more than just a case number or a party's name, and we don't charge you an excessive fee for every search you make. UniCourt lets you search for cases by attorney, law firm, judge, case type, filing date, docket entry, case name, and many other unique identifiers, all without bloated case search fees.\n\nYou can easily find the latest court docket information for cases in Los Angeles, view case summaries for trending cases, and check court case statuses. You can also download court documents, opinions, and tentative rulings all on-demand, and get real-time alerts on new case filings in LA.\n\nUniCourt gives you access to California trial court cases across the Los Angeles Superior Court system. With our case search tool you can search for limited civil court collections and non-collections cases, small claims cases under $10,000, unlimited civil cases for $25,000 or more, and all of the misdemeanor and felony criminal cases in our CrowdSourced Library™. You also have unlimited access to family cases in Los Angeles, such as divorce, separation, and annulment cases, as well as child custody, child visitation, child support cases, and probate cases."
