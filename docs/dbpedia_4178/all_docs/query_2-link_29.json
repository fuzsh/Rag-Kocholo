Supports .NET 5.0 or higher, .NET Standard 2.0 and .NET Framework 4.6.1 or higher, on Windows, Linux and Mac. This package contains strong-named assemblies for legacy use cases (not recommended).\n\nCOMPATIBILITY: net5.0, net48 better supported with explicit builds\n\nCOMPATIBILITY: netstandard1.x, net40, net45 no longer supported\n\nBREAKING: drop all which was marked as obsolete\n\nBREAKING: all native provider adapters moved out to separate NuGet packages\n\nBREAKING: switch many usages of tuples to value tuples (experimental)\n\nLinear Algebra: Fix sparse inplace pointwise multiplication and division ~jkalias\n\nDistributions: Logistic ~Bobby Ingram\n\nDistributions: Perf: Cauchy avoid duplicate evaluation ~Febin\n\nRandom: NextBigIngegerSequence ~Silver-Fang\n\nRandom: xoshiro256StarStar fix out of range exception ~Charlie Turndorf\n\nPrecision: Perf: pre-compute negative powers ~Febin\n\nOptimizations: Remove static properties in LevenbergMarquardtMinimizer ~Jong Hyun Kim\n\nRoot Finding: Newton-Raphson better handling of zero-evaluations\n\nFit.Curve and FindMinimum extended to accept two more parameters\n\nFixed an index out of bounds issue when calculating BFGS minimizer with one variable ~Shiney\n\nFixed Sparse COO NormalizeDuplicates ~Mohamed Moussa\n\nMarcum-Q and Log1p functions ~CHUTORO\n\nSeries: stable series summation\n\nCubic Spline: Extrema and Stationary Points ~Eduardo Rojas\n\nStatistics: Weighted Descriptive and Running Statistics ~Richard Allen\n\nProviders: binary names and loading changes to follow conventions and better x-plat\n\nProviders: drop managed reference linear algebra provider\n\nProviders: native providers no longer inherit managed providers, managed now sealed\n\nProviders: MKL provider compilation switched to Intel oneAPI MKL\n\nProviders: support for provider packages with runtime folders\n\nBetter support for System.Text.Json: Polynomial, DescriptiveStatistics ~Joseph Petersen\n\nLots of internal cleanup, leveraging newer language features\n\nData: now released always together with Numerics (no longer separate versioning)\n\nControl.Describe now includes CPU architecture and family identifier if know"
