        "text": "What is an IP address?\n\nAn Internet Protocol address is a series of numbers that identify a computer on a network. It is represented by four groups of up to three numbers, with each group separated by a period. For example, the default private IP address for many routers is 192.168.0.1.\n\nWhat does a public IP address tell you?\n\nIf a computer is connected to the internet, it has a public IP address. This address is just like a home address: it gives information about where that computer is located. Additionally, it also gives information about who controls that IP address, which in most cases will be an internet service provider (ISP) such as Comcast, Verizon, Frontier, etc.\n\nHow can I find my public IP address?\n\nThere are numerous ways to find your public IP address. The easiest way is right on this page. In the search bar at the top of our site, your public IP address is already pre-filled in. If you don’t see it, just refresh the page.\n\nWhat else can I use this tool for?\n\nIf you have a public IP address that’s not connected to the system you’re using right now, you can check its location. Just key in the address in the search bar above. This is useful if you want to check the approximate location of another connected system, such as a smartphone or even an internet-connected car.\n\nYou can also use this tool if you are using a virtual private network (VPN). A VPN masks your public IP address, making it seem like your system is located in a different place. If you check this tool and it shows a different IP address from what your ISP provides, that means your VPN is working correctly.\n\nPrivate IP Addresses\n\nPublic IP addresses identify your modem on the internet. However, your router has its own set of private IP addresses it distributes to the devices connected to the internet in your home. These addresses are not unique and entering them here won’t give you any information.\n\nGenerally, IP addresses that look like 10.x.x.x, 172.16.x.x, and 192.168.x.x are private addresses. These identify your various devices to your router, not the internet at large. If you can’t get our tool to work, make sure you are entering a public IP address, not a private one."
