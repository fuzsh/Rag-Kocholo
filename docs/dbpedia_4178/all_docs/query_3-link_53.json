        "text": "Man, I miss this show. It's such a shame kids today don't have this. The best they ever got was \"All That\". Pah! No Ross or Barth there, man.\n\n\"Blue skies...Barthie burgers, girls!\"\n\nArcadum, \"3-2-1 Contact\" had The Bloodhound Gang. Mathnet was on \"Square One TV\".\n\nThey both appear every so often on Noggin.\n\nSadly, YCDTOTV has no TV outlet at this time. Nick should do a nostalgia channel for children of the Eighties. It would get a lot of eyeballs watching. A lot of people, too.\n\nAh, I miss \"Square One TV\" too. I actually had one of their dumb songs in my head earlier this morning for no reason whatsoever. Was I just imagining it or was Lynne Thigpen (RIP) on Square One TV? I know that she was on \"Where in the World is Carmen SanDiego\" but I can't find any other info.\n\nNick has like 5 channels now, one of which shows the old school game shows. I like Finders Keepers, Legends of the Hidden Temple, and Double Dare (the original). It also shows Nick Arcade and Get the Picture.\n\nI would love a channel that showed You Can't Do That On Television and Salute Your Shorts again. Nick Toons TV shows Rocko's Modern Life, at least some classic Nick is still aired. Rocko is much better than the newer cartoons (with the exception of Spongebob which is like the new Rocko's Modern Life).\n\n/i don't know.\n\nAt times like this, I'm glad I have getright.\n\n*Click click click click*\n\n*set for auto-download*\n\nThe server is getting nailed hard though. Even while using getright on cable with four file segments the speed is only around 42 kb/s.\n\nWow, my wishes have been granted. Next, I wish for hot naked females at my front door.\n\nRiddil: Probably people who actually had good children's shows on TV when they were growing up.\n\nRob\n\nThis show was like crack.. my mom wouldn't allow me to watch it because one time she saw me watching it and one of the kids on the show told his mom \"i hate you\".. My mom freaked and told me to never watch it... I would sneak and watch it sometimes... Same with the simpsons, but screw that I watched it anyway, now shes doesn't care, she lets my little brother watch anything he wants... Sucks to be a first child.. She overprotected me and now i have social anxiety disorder and depression yay.\n\n/rant\n\nYCDTOTV, Salute Your Shorts, Welcome Freshmen, I grew up on those shows. Hell, Welcome Freshmen made me utterly scared of high school until I got there and realized it was only so much worse in reality. (Well, far more boring anyway.)\n\nNow here's one I wish I could find episodes of: \"Count Duckula\""
