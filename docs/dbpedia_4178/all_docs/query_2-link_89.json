        "text": "In Euclidean geometry, a rhombus is a type of quadrilateral. It is a special case of a parallelogram, whose all sides are equal and diagonals intersect each other at 90 degrees. This is the basic property of rhombus. The shape of a rhombus is in a diamond shape. Hence, it is also called a diamond. Check lines of symmetry in a rhombus.\n\nYou must have seen the diamond shape in the playing cards. All the rhombi are parallelograms and kites. If all the angles of the rhombus are 90 degrees, then it is a square.\n\nTable of Contents:\n\nDefinition\n\nFormulas\n\nArea\n\nPerimeter\n\nProperties\n\nExamples\n\nNow, before we discuss rhombus and its properties, let us know what a quadrilateral is? A quadrilateral is a closed polygon containing 4 sides and 4 vertices enclosing 4 angles. The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is equal to 360 degrees. The quadrilateral is basically of 6 types such as:\n\nParallelogram\n\nTrapezium\n\nSquare\n\nRectangle\n\nKite\n\nRhombus\n\nRhombus Definition\n\nA rhombus is a special case of a parallelogram. In a rhombus, opposite sides are parallel and the opposite angles are equal. Moreover, all the sides of a rhombus are equal in length, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. The rhombus is also called a diamond or rhombus diamond. The plural form of a rhombus is rhombi or rhombuses.\n\nIn the above figure, you can see a rhombus ABCD, where AB, BC, CD and AD are the sides of a rhombus and AC and BD are the diagonals of a rhombus.\n\nProperties of Quadrilaterals\n\nTypes Of Quadrilaterals\n\nArea of Rhombus\n\nDifference Between Rhombus And Parallelogram\n\nQuadrilaterals for Class 9\n\nIs Square a Rhombus?\n\nRhombus has all its sides equal and so does a square. Also, the diagonals of the square are perpendicular to each other and bisect the opposite angles. Therefore, a square is a rhombus.\n\nAngles of Rhombus\n\nBelow are some important facts about the rhombus angles:\n\nRhombus has four interior angles.\n\nThe sum of interior angles of a rhombus adds up to 360 degrees.\n\nThe opposite angles of a rhombus are equal to each other.\n\nThe adjacent angles are supplementary.\n\nIn a rhombus, diagonals bisect each other at right angles.\n\nThe diagonals of a rhombus bisect these angles.\n\nRhombus Formulas\n\nThe formulas for rhombus are defined for two major attributes, such as:\n\nArea\n\nPerimeter\n\nGet more: Mathematics formulas\n\nArea of Rhombus\n\nThe area of the rhombus is the region covered by it in a two-dimensional plane. The formula for the area is equal to the product of diagonals of the rhombus divided by 2. It can be represented as:\n\nArea of Rhombus, A = (d1 x d2)/2 square units\n\nwhere d1 and d2 are the diagonals of a rhombus.\n\nPerimeter of Rhombus\n\nThe perimeter of a rhombus is the total length of its boundaries. Or we can say the sum of all the four sides of a rhombus is its perimeter. The formula for its perimeter is given by:\n\nThe perimeter of Rhombus, P = 4a units\n\nWhere the diagonals of the rhombus are d1 & d2 and ‘a’ is the side.\n\nProperties of Rhombus\n\nSome of the important properties of the rhombus are as follows:\n\nAll sides of the rhombus are equal.\n\nThe opposite sides of a rhombus are parallel.\n\nOpposite angles of a rhombus are equal.\n\nIn a rhombus, diagonals bisect each other at right angles.\n\nDiagonals bisect the angles of a rhombus.\n\nThe sum of two adjacent angles is equal to 180 degrees.\n\nYou will get a rectangle when you join the midpoint of the sides.\n\nYou will get another rhombus when you join the midpoints of half the diagonal.\n\nAround a rhombus, there can be no circumscribing circle.\n\nWithin a rhombus, there can be no inscribed circle.\n\nYou will get a rectangle where the midpoints of the 4 sides are joined together, and the length and width of the rectangle will be half the value of the main diagonal so that the area of the rectangle will be half of the rhombus.\n\nWhen the shorter diagonal is equal to one of the sides of a rhombus, two congruent equilateral triangles are formed.\n\nYou will get a cylindrical surface having a convex cone at one end and concave cone at another end when the rhombus is revolved about any side as the axis of rotation.\n\nYou will get a cylindrical surface having concave cones on both the ends when the rhombus is revolved about the line joining the midpoints of the opposite sides as the axis of rotation.\n\nYou will get solid with two cones attached to their bases when the rhombus is revolving about the longer diagonal as the axis of rotation. In this case, the maximum diameter of the solid is equal to the shorter diagonal of the rhombus.\n\nYou will get solid with two cones attached to their bases when the rhombus is revolving about the shorter diagonal as the axis of rotation. In this case, the maximum diameter of the solid is equal to the longer diagonal of the rhombus.\n\nRhombus Solved Problems\n\nThe sample example for the rhombus is given below.\n\nQuestion 1:\n\nThe two diagonal lengths d1 and d2 of a rhombus are 6cm and 12 cm, respectively. Find its area.\n\nSolution:\n\nGiven:\n\nDiagonal d1 = 6cm\n\nDiagonal d2= 12 cm\n\nArea of the rhombus, A = (d1 x d2)/2 square units\n\nA = ( 6 x 12)/2\n\nA = 72/2\n\nA = 36 cm2\n\nTherefore, the area of rhombus = 36 cm2\n\nQuestion 2:\n\nFind the diagonal of a rhombus if its area is 121 cm2 and length measure of longest diagonal is 22 cm.\n\nSolution:\n\nGiven: Area of rhombus = 121 cm2 and Lets say d1 = 22 cm.\n\nUsing Area of the rhombus formula, A = (d1 x d2)/2 square units, we get\n\n121 = (22 x d2)/2\n\n121 = 11 x d2\n\nor 11 = d2\n\nTherefore, the Length of another diagonal is 11 cm.\n\nQuestion 3:\n\nWhat are the basic properties of rhombus?\n\nSolution:\n\nThe basic properties of the rhombus are:\n\nThe opposite angles are congruent.\n\nThe diagonals intersect each other at 90 degrees.\n\nThe diagonals bisect the opposite interior angles.\n\nThe adjacent angles are supplementary.\n\nQuestion 4:\n\nWhat is the perimeter of a rhombus whose sides are all equal to 6 cm?\n\nSolution:\n\nGiven, the side of rhombus = 6cm\n\nSince all the sides are equal, therefore,\n\nPerimeter = 4 x side\n\nP = 4 x 6\n\nP = 24cm\n\nFor more such interesting information on properties of the quadrilateral, register with BYJU’S – The Learning App and also watch videos to learn with ease.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions on Rhombus – FAQs\n\nQ1\n\nIs a rhombus a square?\n\nNo, rhombus is not a square but a square is a rhombus.\n\nQ2\n\nWhy is a rhombus not a square?\n\nRhombus is not a square since for a square all the sides are equal and all the interior angles are right angles. However, in rhombus all the interior angles are not equal even though they have equal sides.\n\nQ3\n\nDoes a rhombus have 4 right angles?\n\nNo, a rhombus does not have four right angles.\n\nQ4\n\nAre all angles of a rhombus equal?\n\nNo, in rhombus only the opposite angles are equal.\n\nQ5\n\nDo rhombus angles add up to 360?\n\nWe know that the sum of all the interior angles of a quadrilateral is equal to 360 degrees. Hence, the angles of a rhombus add up to 360 degrees.\n\nTest your Knowledge on Rhombus\n\nQ5\n\nPut your understanding of this concept to test by answering a few MCQs.
