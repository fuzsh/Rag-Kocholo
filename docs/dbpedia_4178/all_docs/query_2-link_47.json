        "text": "As per @robert-dodier's suggestion, the MatrixNormal distribution becomes the multivariate normal at p = 1. This is more verbose than if there were a native Multinormal distribution class, but not by much:\n\nusing MathNet.Numerics.LinearAlgebra; Vector Sample<T>(System.Random random, Vector<T> mean, Matrix<T> cov) { return MatrixNormal.Sample( random, mean.ToColumnMatrix(), cov, Matrix<T>.Build.DenseIdentity(1)).Column(0); }\n\nHowever, only positive-definite covariance matrices are allowed, since the distribution performs the Cholesky decomposition."
