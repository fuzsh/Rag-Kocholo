        "text": "Season 3 refers, collectively, to the 40 episodes that comprise the third season of the PBS series Square One Television.\n\nSeason Overview[]\n\nThe series' third season would possess the same number of episodes at its second, but there would be more episodes with a listed minor emphasis. The season would introduce segments such as Math-a-thon and Eddie \"the Old Philosopher\" Lawrence, while retooling game shows such as But Who's Counting?. The show's most prominent sketch, Mathnet, would also be moved from Los Angeles to New York in order for Sesame Workshop to have more control over its production.\n\nEpisodes[]\n\nNUMBER IMAGE AIR DATE LENGTH EMPHASIS-MAIN EMPHASIS-MINI 301 January 15, 1990 None Large Numbers 302 January 16, 1990 None None 303 January 17, 1990 None None 304 January 18, 1990 None None 305 January 19, 1990 None Large Numbers / Geometry 306 January 22, 1990 None None 307 January 23, 1990 None None 308 January 24, 1990 None Percents 309 January 25, 1990 None Large Numbers 310 January 26, 1990 None Data Representation 311 January 29, 1990 None Large Numbers / Approximation 312 January 30, 1990 None Multiples 313 January 31, 1990 None None 314 February 1, 1990 None None 315 February 2, 1990 None Data Representation 316 February 5, 1990 None None 317 February 6, 1990 None None 318 February 7, 1990 None Data Representation 319 February 8, 1990 Combinatorics None 320 February 9, 1990 None None 321 February 12, 1990 None None 322 February 13, 1990 None None 323 February 14, 1990 None Estimation in Measurement 324 February 15, 1990 None Negative Numbers 325 February 16, 1990 None None 326 February 19, 1990 None Rational Numbers 327 February 20, 1990 None None 328 February 21, 1990 None Multiples 329 February 22, 1990 None Percents 330 February 23, 1990 None None 331 February 26, 1990 None None 332 February 27, 1990 None Large Numbers 333 February 28, 1990 None None 334 March 1, 1990 None None 335 March 2, 1990 None Data Representation 336 March 5, 1990 None None 337 March 6, 1990 None None 338 March 7, 1990 Fractions None 339 March 8, 1990 None None 340 March 9, 1990 None Large Numbers\n\nCast[]\n\nStarring[]\n\nArthur Howard\n\nBeverly Mickins\n\nCris Franco\n\nLarry Cedar\n\nLuisa Leschin\n\nReg E.
