        "text": "You can write your own complex decimal struct. The way I would do this is to look at the System.Numerics.Complex - Struct and copy the definitions, so that you have the same functionality and naming. You can leave out some functions if you're not going to need them, like maybe trigonometric functions, conversion operators, or even the polar coordinate functionality.\n\nI implemented some of the functionality in the code below. Note that you may want to add the interfaces, and maybe some input checking for the functions."
