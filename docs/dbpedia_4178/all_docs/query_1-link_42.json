        "text": "Try matrix.Enumerate().Maximum() instead, that is both much simpler and much faster. You could also use the Enumerable.Max extensions method, but Statistics.Maximum is significantly faster in case of a dense matrix.\n\nFor sparse matrices you may want to do matrix.Enumerate(Zeros.AllowSkip).Maximum() instead, although that would need special handling if the returned value is negative (but might have to be zero)."
