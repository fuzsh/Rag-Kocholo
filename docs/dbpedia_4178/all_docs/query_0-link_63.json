They've signed up with a door-to-door business, which gives them candy bars to sell. The operator of the business tells them to go out and sell the candy bars and he'll give them 1/10 of the money they collect. They decide to go to Dirk Niblick to find out if this is a good deal. In the process, they break down his door, when they his piano playing, which sounds awful. They thought something was wrong. After dealing with this, Dirk addresses their question. He says that they could do quite well with this arrangement. 1/10 is the same 10%. Therefore, if they were to sell, say, $10 worth of candy bars, they would make $1. If it were $100, then they would earn $10 and so on. So Fluff and Fold go out and sell the candy bars and return for their pay. They collected $250 and are given $25.

The first is that you only need math in jobs that require handling money, such as being a banker. Mathman points out that there are other jobs in which math is used, such as being a scuba diver, or a choreographer, or an airplane pilot, so the statement is false. The next is that math isn't used outside of school. Mathman gives many examples of how math is used outside of school, but in this season, the amount of time Mathman has to make a decision becomes important. Mathman failed to say false in time, so Glitch eats him, figuring, \"\"Play by the rules, get eaten by the rules.\"\" \"\"Square One Challenge\"\" Another installment involves a tower of blocks, a statue of Mr. Beasley, and comparing 60% of 80 to 80% of 60. \"\"Mathnet: Despair in Monterey Bay Part 2\"\" The continuation of the Monterey Bay case.\n\nSkits in this Episode: \"\"Infinity\"\" A music video by the Jets about the concept of infinity.

Glitch has to determine the truth and falsehood of statements regarding who's better in math.

Mathman points out that it's false, as all sorts of people are good at math, and so Mathdog consumes Glitch.

They roll the clip. The plot is that a stinkbomb has been set up to go off in just a few minutes in a game show studio. Catman and his female assistant Kitty need to figure out a way to stop it before that happens. The villain who set up the bomb, The Rhymeseter, is present there. He's not about to tell our heroes the combinations to open the locks to the bomb, but will give them clues. He begins by calling them rubes and says that they can open the first lock by adding one to the largest two digit cube.

The district attorney accuses her of false advertising. Her advertising claims that using ten different flavors, she can create 100 different two dip ice cream cones. The district attorney contends that with ten ice cream flavors, she can only create 90 different flavors. He demonstrates, using a model. He shows that you can put one dip of any particular flavor on for the first dip and then make the second dip any of the other 9, making for 90 different flavors. The ice cream lady doesn't deny this. However, she says that there's something that the district attorney is missing and goes over to show him. She demonstrates that what the dist\n\nSkits in this Episode: \"\"Sneaky Peeks: Gorillas In Our Midst\"\" In the movie, a newsanchor (Reg E. Cathey) uses a chart to count the number of gorilla sightings in New York City, and addding up the numbers on each block he gets 132, so he assumes there are 132 gorillas. A gorilla expert proves that's not the case-there's only one gorilla, and all those people saw the same gorilla at different times. The newsanchor admits his error, saying, \"\"You made a monkey out of me,\"\" which offends the gorilla.

Queeg arrives and admits that he lied on the Donnawhy show, but claims that he only did so to look good on television. When the mathnetters set sail, the same thing that happened on Queeg's previous voyage happens again: loud moans are heard and the compass spins out of direction.

Back at Mathnet HQ, Benny Pill sets an electromagnet on a compass and it spins out of direction. The Mathnetters conclude that Queeg set up the electromagnet as he operated the sonar, and found a way to fake the screams.

This is confirmed by investigating Revolutionary War history and finding that the first HMS Twain was headed for Hamilton Massachussetts to divert the colonists while the second HMS Twain, which actually had the supplies went to Hamilton North Carolina a few days later, as Cornwallis was stationed at Hamilton at the time of the Twain's voyage. \"\"Blame Earl\"\" appears on one of the maps, and after triangulating from Hamilton and Jackson in North Carolina Twice, the wreck seems to be traced to the Albemarle sound, of which Blame Earl was an anagram.
