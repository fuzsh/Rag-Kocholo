        "text": "You are here: Home → Worksheets → Grade 7\n\nFree Math Worksheets for Grade 7\n\nThis is a comprehensive collection of free printable math worksheets for grade 7 and for pre-algebra, organized by topics such as expressions, integers, one-step equations, rational numbers, multi-step equations, inequalities, speed, time & distance, graphing, slope, ratios, proportions, percent, geometry, and pi. They are randomly generated, printable from your browser, and include the answer key. The worksheets support any seventh grade math program, but go especially well with IXL's 7th grade math curriculum.\n\nThe worksheets are randomly generated each time you click on the links below. You can also get a new, different one just by refreshing the page in your browser (press F5).\n\nYou can print them directly from your browser window, but first check how it looks like in the \"Print Preview\". If the worksheet does not fit the page, adjust the margins, header, and footer in the Page Setup settings of your browser. Another option is to adjust the \"scale\" to 95% or 90% in the Print Preview. Some browsers and printers have \"Print to fit\" option, which will automatically scale the worksheet to fit the printable area.\n\nAll worksheets come with an answer key placed on the 2nd page of the file.\n\nIn seventh grade, students will study pre-algebra topics, such as integer arithmetic, simplifying expressions, the distributive property, and solving equations & inequalities. They continue studying ratio and percent and learn about proportions. Please note that these free worksheets do not cover all 7th grade topics; most notably, they do not include problem solving.\n\nIntroduction to algebra\n\nThe worksheets in this introductory section correspond with Math Mammoth Grade 7, Chapter 1, and don't involve negative numbers.\n\nOrder of operations\n\nReview: expressions with exponents\n\nSolve in the correct order: two or three operations\n\nSolve in the correct order: three or four operations\n\nSolve in the correct order: three or four operations with decimal numbers (round to two decimal digits)\n\nExpressions\n\nEvaluate simple expressions\n\nWrite a number expression from a verbal expression\n\nSimplify expressions (by combining like terms; no negative numbers)\n\nMultiply using the distributive property\n\nFactor the expressions\n\nSimplify expressions -
