In honour of the signing of the armistice, we are celebrating Rememberance Day in Canada, Veterans Day in the US, and similar holidays in countries around the world.\n\nThis week we look at the first mention of World War I and armistice in The Simpsons.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nMorning Mathematical Monsters & Maniacs!\n\n(Today’s post is sponsored by the letter “M”)\n\nHi, I’m Super Safi and you may remember me from such stats and strategy posts as Kwik-E-Mart Farming and the advanced losing-to-win Superheroes battle strategy.\n\nOver the past 600+ episodes, The Simpsons has taken us on an amazing mathematical journey involving fractions, probability, Fermat’s last theorem, and hundreds of other aspects from the wonderful world off mathematics.\n\nAnd what better way to start your week, then by discussing math Monday morning?\n\nThis week we look at Bart’s homework on reducing fractions to irreducible fractions. I know this will split you readers into either Barts or Lisas from Postcards From the Wedge (Season 21, E14), as they so eloquently discussed fractions:\n\nBart: “I would end all life on this planet just to get out of doing fractions.”\n\nLisa: “Fractions aren’t that hard. You just have to have a common denominator. For example, one-half plus one-third equals three-…”\n\nBart: “End. all. life. on. this. planet!” [makes explosion sound]\n\nLisa: “You’ll need to know fractions to make that explosion!”\n\nSo let’s find out if you’re a Bart or a Lisa.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nMorning Mathematical Monsters & Maniacs!\n\n(Today’s post is sponsored by the letter “M”)\n\nHi, I’m Super Safi and you may remember me from such stats and strategy posts as Kwik-E-Mart Farming and the advanced losing-to-win Superheroes battle strategy.\n\nOver the past 600+ episodes, The Simpsons has taken us on an amazing mathematical journey involving fractions, probability, Fermat’s last theorem, and hundreds of other aspects from the wonderful world off mathematics.\n\nAnd what better way to start your week, then by discussing math Monday morning?\n\nHappy Halloween!
