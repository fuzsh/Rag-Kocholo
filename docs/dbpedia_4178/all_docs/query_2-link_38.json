        "text": "In April 2002 the Executive Committee of the International Mathematical Union (IMU) endorsed a recommendation to install Math-Net Pages. The Math-Net Page for departments or research institutes is a web portal for mathematics departments and institutes that presents information in a standardized, well-structured, and easy-to-use format. The Math-Net Page is only the first step towards building a distributed information system for the international mathematics community. Other Math-Net services like the Navigator, Persona Mathematica or mathnet.preprints (MPRESS) can use the Math-Net Page as a standardized entry point. All these services together form the nucleus of a global electronic information and communication system for mathematics (which could be used in a very similar way for other sciences too). Since the Math-Net Page for departments and MPRESS are very well accepted in the community the next step could be a world directory of mathematicians driven by the Math-Net community."
