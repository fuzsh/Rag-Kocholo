They solved weird ass cases too.\n\nI've been saying this since I first saw the \"Pilot\" I was just afraid to admit\n\nthis. I remember one time they did a murder mystery. Anyone who thinks they\n\ndon't remember but not quite, all you need to do is to look at the opening\n\ncredits of the \"X-Files\". Yep, that's right. There is a shot of Scully in the\n\nopening credits wearing a plaid suit jacket, and her short hair, slightly\n\ncurled, with a flash light. That was actually why I watched part of the\n\n\"Pilot\". I said, what? no, way. I can't believe they gave \"MathNet\" it's own\n\nprime time t.v. show, but it was the X-Files. And they had that \"based on real\n\ndocumented evidence\" line and the rest was history.\n\nIn that one opening shot, Scully looks exactly like the lady from \"MathNet\"\n\nThank you so much for bringing this up!!! I am not alone. I'm not the only\n\none who noticed this.\n\nSomeone please look at the opening credits and let me know if I'm right?\n\nJenniferelise\n\n\n\n\"It didn't say anything. I had to read it.\"\n\nThat was also the episode that featured Nomanissan Island, an old codger\n\nnamed Jesse Motz (whose boat left from Motz Landing), Fishmonger\n\nAirlines, Crusty the mechanic, the Brothers KARamazov (or was it\n\nKaraMAzov), William Windom (sp?) as the judge, and the Next to the Last\n\nNational Bank.\n\nI have been a fan of Mathnet for YEARS (ever since it came on TV when I\n\nwas 12) and have ALWAYS thought XF resembled it, to the point where I\n\nactually wondered if CC took some uncredited inspiration from it. Sure,\n\nit's a kids' show (a parody of Dragnet), but the dynamic between the two\n\nleads (short, practical, brainy, solemn, by-the-book female and tall,\n\ngoofy, comic-relief-y, instinct-following male who remain absolutely\n\nprofessional but just shy of flirtatious) and the show itself (two\n\ncompletely deadpan, even when they're cracking jokes, detectives\n\ninvestigate the \"odd\" cases for the LAPD that have a sort of\n\nmathematical bouquet, all the while finishing each other's sentences and\n\nmanaging to mesh beautifully despite their differing personalities) are\n\nawfully similar to XF. I mean, this isn't a COMPLETELY novel concept,\n\nbut trust me, the resemblance is there and it's almost eerie in\n\nretrospect.\n\nIn fact, it so happens that a friend and I are writing a crossover as we\n\nspeak. :)\n\nCathy\n\n--\n\nCatherine J.

She was on one of the actor\n\npanels due to her guest-starring role in \"Sea Bride\" (a 2nd season episode\n\nin which her character got to *Tango* with TuxWearing!RoseInHisTeeth!Sam,\n\nthe lucky gal ... 8-) She was great! Like everyone else on the guest\n\nactor panels -- and just about every other guest actor who has ever\n\nappeared on QUANTUM LEAP -- she assured us that QL's was *the* friendliest\n\nset (cast & crew) she'd ever worked on, that Scott Bakula was the *nicest*\n\nguy she'd ever worked with/The Nicest Guy In Hollywood, etc. etc. etc..\n\n(As they say, \"The Man Is A Saint.\" O ;-)\n\nAt the autograph table, I summoned up the nerve to say that I'd\n\nbeen a fan of hers ever since MATHNET ... and was relieved when she\n\nreacted with warm surprise. She said I was the 2nd person in line so far\n\nwho'd mentioned the show, and that she had had no idea that anyone would\n\nremember it. I think she said that it had been a fun show to work on.\n\nAlso, since this LeapCon was held shortly after her episode of\n\nBABYLON 5 aired (she played Sheridan's visiting sister), I said I hoped\n\nwe'd see her again there. She said she hoped so too (at least, as much as\n\nany actor can); and we agreed it was a good sign that they hadn't killed\n\nher off by the end of the hour (in hindsight, not good enough, alas ...)\n\nFinally, although I only asked to take a picture *of* her,\n\n*she* also insisted that someone take a picture of us both -- and did the\n\nMATHNET salute, with a totally deadpan Kate Monday expression on her face.\n\nWheeeee!\n\n* please do not email * please POST replies * thankyoukindly * Semper FI *\n\nPamela T.

Since then I haven't seen her except in a couple of\n\ncommercials.\n\nShe's in a commercial right now, actually. It's for Sony (?) Minidiscs.\n\nIt's one of a series of sequential ads. They're at a cocktail party, and\n\nJames Brolin lets her listen to his minidisc. She says, \"This doesn't\n\nsound like the kind of music James Brolin would listen to.\" He replies,\n\n\"But then, you're not really a James Brolin fan,\" and reaches behind her\n\nhead, ripping off the rubber mask she is wearing. She turns\n\ninto...someone else, I forget. :P\n\nSame with Joe Howard (George) - commercials and nothing else (though I\n\nheard he was in Grumpy Old Men 2 or something).\n\nCathy\n\nMay the Math be with you\n\n--\n\nCatherine J.
