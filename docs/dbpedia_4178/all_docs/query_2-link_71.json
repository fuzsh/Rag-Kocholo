        "text": "Synopsis\n\nMath detectives George Frankly and Pat Tuesday take a wrong turn going to a mystery weekend and come to a manor where they need their math skills to solve a real mystery\n\n\"synopsis\" may belong to another edition of this title.\n\nFrom School Library Journal\n\nGr 5-8--Two pun-filled cases based on the Square One television series. In Weekend, the Mathnet detectives are invited to participate in a murder-mystery overnight. When their fellow guests begin disappearing, it seems at first to be part of the play. Then the Mathnetters discover that they are at the wrong house and realize that a real crime is taking place. The Smart Dummy, Charlie, belongs to a ventriloquist who has gone into shock over the loss of his second puppet. Its case was apparently switched for a suitcase containing one million dollars in counterfeit money. The human performer refuses to talk, so the detectives must communicate with Charlie to recover the missing dummy and apprehend the criminals. Both cases require the use of mathematical logic. The clues are well presented and the solution process is clearly explained. The writing style perfectly mirrors the old Dragnet shows, complete with DUM DE DUM DUM to mark climactic points! Many of the punning references are beyond the intended audience, but the broad humor and mock-serious dialogue will appeal to many readers. Teachers will appreciate the math angle in the stories and the related puzzles at the end of each book.\n\nElaine E.
