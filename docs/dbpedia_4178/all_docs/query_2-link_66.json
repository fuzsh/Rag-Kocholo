WARNING: Methods with the Inplace-suffix may modify the data array by reordering its entries.\n\nBucket\n\nA Histogram consists of a series of Buckets, each representing a region limited by a lower bound (exclusive) and an upper bound (inclusive).\n\nCorrelation\n\nA class with correlation measures between two datasets.\n\nDescriptiveStatistics\n\nComputes the basic statistics of data set. The class meets the NIST standard of accuracy for mean, variance, and standard deviation (the only statistics they provide exact values for) and exceeds them in increased accuracy mode.\n\nHistogram\n\nA class which computes histograms of data.\n\nMovingStatistics\n\nRunning statistics over a window of data, allows updating by adding values.\n\nRunningStatistics\n\nRunning statistics accumulator, allows updating by adding values or by combining two accumulators.\n\nSortedArrayStatistics\n\nStatistics operating on an array already sorted ascendingly.\n\nStatistics\n\nExtension methods to return basic statistics on set of data."
