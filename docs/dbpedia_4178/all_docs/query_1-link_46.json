        "text": "Alright, who’s with me on this one? Remember back to 1987, we’d come home from school, flip on PBS and watch “Square One TV” – a half-hour series that featured a revolving door of characters and segments, all related to math and learning.\n\nIn other words, a show that would feel totally out of place on television today. And yet, as a child, I would run home to see what today’s case would be on “Mathnet” or if I could outsmart the contestants on “Triple Play.” There was also Mathman – a Pacman rip off that moments ago transported me back to childhood upon hearing the theme music.\n\nWhy isn’t this on DVD? I’d definitely rent (if not buy) it, along with my other childhood fave, “Where In The World Was Carmen Sandiego” featuring the best rock/a cappella group in history, Rockapella. I wonder if kids TV today is nearly as educational as it was for me — parents, weigh in!\n\nAnyway, if you’re like me, watching the videos below is going to be a really unexpected trip down memory lane, so let’s kick things off with my favorite guy — Mathman, and after the jump check out the theme song, an episode of “Mathnet” and a full round of Triple Play that emphasizes a few things: We really rocked some real bad hair in the late 80s and it was a much simpler time when viewed through today’s “Deal or No Deal” lenses. The grand prize is a Square One Sweatshirt, an article of clothing I remember desperately wanting — almost as bad as my very own Mortimer the Marker from “Picture Pages!”\n\nTheme Song\n\n(embedded video intentionally removed)\n\nMathnet\n\n(embedded video intentionally removed)\n\nTriple Play\n\n(embedded video intentionally removed)"
