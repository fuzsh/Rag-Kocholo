They use their understanding of his physiology, the geography, and math to get him home.\n\n01:34\n\nMatt, Digit, and Slider make a fake ring that looks just like the original in order to trick Hacker. They have the plan from which the original ring was made and simply need to adjust the radius of the inner and outer circles. Digit is confused, so Matt explains what the radius is and how it influences the size of a circle. Slider uses a tool to create the correct ring size, while Digit adds the markings to finalize the fake ring.\n\nA boy and his younger brother calculate how far they have to drive, and how long it will take them."
