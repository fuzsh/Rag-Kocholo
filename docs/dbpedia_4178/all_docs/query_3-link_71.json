        "text": "I was watching the episode of Parks and Recreation \"Ron & Tammy II\", and noticed something about the Pawnee Police Station. You only see it at the start of the scene when Ron Swanson and Tammy are in jail, but there's an establishing shot of the police station.\n\nIt looked very familiar. Parks and Recreaction is shot in California, and there was another show that was shot there about 25 years earlier. The building looks a tiny bit different (and thanks to the wonders of modern computer graphics, had \"Pawnee Police Station\" added to the top), but the architecture design was unmistakeable.\n\nYes, the Pawnee Police Station was the same building they used for exterior (and interior) shots on the Mathnet segments of Square One TV, the PBS sketch-comedy math show, at least while they were still shooting in L. A. Remember those?\n\nIn real life, the building is the former Los Angeles Police Station No. 11 on Yost Boulevard, now the Northeast Area L. A. Police Community Service Center, and home to the L. A. Police Historical Society Museum. The building has also been used for other TV and film productions over the years.\n\nThere’s a podcast called The Loudest Girl In The World, hosted by Lauren Ober. The show concerns Ober’s autism diagnosis at 42, as well as her experience dealing with this information and opening up to others about it. When I listened to it last summer, I related pretty heavily to what she was talking about. I’ve also started to make peace with how my own brain works in the last few years. It’s been a rough road, though.\n\nI’m on the bus. It’s too early to be human and I haven’t had my coffee yet so I don’t really want to do much; maybe read or listen to music, things that help tune out the other people or the monotony of the commute. When I leave the suburbs, it's usually dark. I sometimes look out the windows, but more to see how far I’ve traveled than at anything interesting. By the time I arrive downtown, I can see the sun coming up over the harbour.\n\nThe year is winding down. I’m preparing to go to New Brunswick for my regular Christmas visit with the family; my travel arrangements up there have all been taken care of. I haven’t bothered with Christmas shopping yet; my cash flow was a little tight until my last paycheque came in, and my tolerance for the malls has dropped over the years. Everything costs too much money now."
