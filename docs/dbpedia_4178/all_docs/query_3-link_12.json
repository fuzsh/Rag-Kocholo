It was sort of a comedy math show that was also a parody of (of all things) Dragnet.\n\nPost by Limity (BLM) on\n\nI LOVED this show. It came on after school, I have so many memories about it and all the various skits. It was set up like a variety show with various sketches and musical pieces, and then the last ten minutes would be an episode of Mathnet.\n\nAlong with Mathnet, it also had a running cartoon, Dirk Nibbler of the math brigade.\n\nPost by Spider2024 on\n\nThis show gets 8% of my love.\n\n(That sounds like a little, but I've loved many good TV shows over the years. I have a pie chart somewhere illustrating that. )\n\nPost by Allie Kitsune on\n\nThe show that introduced us to Reg E Cathey.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nPost by Lupin the Third on\n\n@vyse said:\n\nNot gonna lie, that evil Twister guy scared me as a kid.\n\nPost by Lupin the Third on\n\nI think enjoying the Mathnet part of the show was what made me appreciate Dragnet when I got older.\n\nPost by Kevin Hamilton on\n\nSquare One ruled. One of Reg E Cathey's first big roles as well.\n\nPost by Kevin Hamilton on\n\n@vyse said:\n\nNot gonna lie, that evil Twister guy scared me as a kid.\n\nMy sister and I always rooted for Mr. Glitch\n\nPost by wildojinx on\n\nWhy this hasnt shown up on an official Weird Al album is beyond me.\n\nPost by WoodStoner1 on\n\nI think enjoying the Mathnet part of the show was what made me appreciate Dragnet when I got older.\n\nThis is another case of knowing the parody before the original for me!\n\nMathnet, Mathman, and the game show parodies would be the highlights of the show for me.\n\nPost by Paul on\n\nWhy this hasnt shown up on an official Weird Al album is beyond me.\n\nThe reason is that Al doesn't think it would really work outside of the show (also there's probably some legal issues since he wrote it for use on the show). I was hoping it would be on the \"rarities\" disc of the box set, but it wasn't.\n\nPost by Paul on\n\n@vyse said:\n\nNot gonna lie, that evil Twister guy scared me as a kid.\n\nThat's totally understandable- he sorta freaks me out now!\n\nPost by Rumble McSkirmish on\n\nThe show was great and yes Mathnet was the best the part of the series hands down.\n\nThe producers agreed because as the series went on the segments went from 8-10 minuets to 15 minuets and after Square One ended its run they took the some of the Mathnet daily episodes and edited them together as an hour long TV movie of the week styled episode.\n\nAlso I've mentioned it before (but I'll mention it again) Mathnet did a Pro Wrestling story line with a pre WWF Damien Demento playing the heel wrestler.\n\nPost by carp (SPC, Itoh Respect Army) on\n\nINCREDIBLY catchy songs, on this show. Not surprising, with the CTW people behind it, but it's stuff I still remember to this day.\n\n(sue me; I like shitty 80s rap)\n\nAnyone remember how this show got weird and stupid at the very end? It went from teaching math concepts to kind of just plaintively begging the audience to believe that match is useful everyday life.\n\nPost by Paul on\n\nMan, those are catchy songs. Now I want an album full of them.\n\nPost by Brandon Walsh is Insane. on\n\nRun DMC was on this... which was awesome. And the Fat Bous I think.\n\nLoved this show so much!\n\nTaught me about 1, 1, 2, 3... with Lisa Simpson and that parrot lol\n\nPost by horseface on\n\nI loved the Mathman bits. And I was also a bit frightened by that tornado. He was so vicious toward docile Mathman!\n\nPost by Main Event Mark on\n\n@vyse said:\n\nNot gonna lie, that evil Twister guy scared me as a kid.\n\nlol me too. I remember getting very anxious when Mathman got it wrong."
