        "text": "Maple\n\nMaple by Waterloo Maple Inc. is for symbolic mathematics. In other words, you give it formulae and it can substitute one into another, solve for one of the variables, solve a differential equation symbolically, and numerous other activities. It can then go on to evaluate the resulting formulae including numerical solution of differential equations. Follow this link to an index of Maple's features.\n\nWe have the 2015 x86_64 version. This software is licensed.\n\nTo start it, type maple at the command prompt. This gives you a textmode interface. If you give the -x option or use the command xmaple, you will get an X-Windows interface. Alternatively find it in your desktop environment's software menu in the Mathematics category. (If we or they had set that up…)\n\nMathematica\n\nMathematica by Wolfram Research is another symbolic mathematics package with a similar function as Maple but quite a contrasting style. Particularly see the reference document on the Wolfram Language.\n\nWe have the latest version 10. OK on both x86_64 and i686. This software is licensed. Wolfram has a cloud service, which is not cheap.\n\nTo start Mathematica, type mathematica at the command prompt. Alternatively find it in your desktop environment's software menu in the Mathematics category. (If we or they had set that up…) You get an X-Windows interface.\n\nMatlab\n\nMatlab by Mathworks is mainly intended for numerical and matrix computations, and data visualization. See this link for a summary of key features of Matlab.\n\nWe have version R2016a. OK on both x86_64 and i686. Available for Linux and Windows. This software is licensed. We also have licenses for a number of Matlab toolboxes.\n\nTo start Matlab, type matlab at the command prompt. Alternatively find it in your desktop environment's software menu in the Mathematics category. (If we or they had set that up…)\n\nOctave\n\nOctave from GNU is intended for numerical computations and data visualization. It has been described as a free Matlab; the programming language is very similar and programs are easily ported from one to the other.\n\nWe have version 3.6.4; the latest is 3.8.2. OK on both x86_64 and i686. Octave is free software under GPL; client licenses are not required.\n\nTo start it, type octave at the command prompt. This is a text interface (not a GUI); however, graphs are plotted using X-Windows (OpenGL).\n\nTo see the online documentation do tkinfo octave\n\nThe reference manual is available online.\n\nThe support page has links to the FAQ, wiki, and other resources.\n\nSage\n\nSage is a free open-source mathematics software framework that incorporates many other open-source packages, including:\n\nGAP (computational discrete algebra, computational group theory)\n\nPARI/GP (number theory)\n\nMaxima (symbolic mathematics, descendant of Macsyma)\n\nmwrank (elliptic curves)\n\nR (statistics)\n\nsingular (polynomial rings and noncommutative algebras)\n\nKANT/Kash (algebraic number theory)\n\nMacaulay2 (algebraic geometry and commutative algebras)\n\nAnd quite a number of others, plus infrastructure\n\nThe framework language is Python.\n\nWe have version 4.7; latest is 6.5. OK for x86_64 and i686. Sage and its components are free software; client licenses are not required.\n\nTo start Sage, just type sage at the command line. It takes a while to start up. When you get its command prompt (sage:), you can enter commands or type notebook() for a GUI. It will open an instance of Firefox on the local machine and you can use Sage from the web form.\n\nAn alternate way to use Sage is via the SageMathCloud. This is a free service hosted at the University of Washington.\n\nMath Libraries"
