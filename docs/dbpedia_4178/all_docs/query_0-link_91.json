        "text": "Square One Television (sometimes referred to as Square One or Square One TV) was an American children's television program produced by the Children's Television Workshop (now known as Sesame Workshop) to teach mathematics and new abstract mathematical concepts to young viewers.\n\nCreated and broadcast by PBS in the United States from January 26, 1987 to November 6, 1992, the show was intended to address the math crisis among American schoolchildren. After the last episode aired, the show went into reruns until October 7, 1994. The show was revived for the 1995â€“96 PBS season as a teacher instruction program, Square One TV Math Talk.[citation needed]"
