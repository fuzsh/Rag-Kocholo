        "text": "Low blood pressure, or hypotension, may be a sign of good health and a decreased risk of heart disease. But not always.\n\nAt times, continually low blood pressure or a sudden drop in blood pressure can lead to worrisome symptoms and may occur because of serious health problems, including blood loss, dehydration, diabetes, and several heart issues. Pregnancy can lead to hypotension, as well as certain medications for other conditions.\n\nUnderstanding Hypotension (Low Blood Pressure)\n\nA blood pressure reading contains two numbers: systolic pressure and diastolic pressure.\n\nSystolic pressure is the top, or first, number in your blood pressure reading. This indicates the pressure within your arteries when your heart pumps out blood. Diastolic pressure is the bottom number, showing the pressure in your arteries while your heart is filling with blood.\n\nIf your blood pressure is 120/80 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) or lower, healthcare professionals consider it normal. Generally, if the blood pressure reading is under 90/60 mmHg, it is abnormally low.\n\nA doctor will refer to this as hypotension.\n\nSome adults regularly have blood pressure in the hypotensive range but no symptoms. They may not require treatment. In serious cases, low blood pressure can result in a decreased supply of oxygen and nutrients to your brain and other essential organs, which can eventually lead to life-threatening shock.\n\nAnyone can develop hypotension, but certain groups of people are more likely to experience it.\n\nThere are also different types of low blood pressure, notes Mayo Clinic.\n\nFor instance, orthostatic (positional) hypotension occurs when you stand up after sitting or lying down. It is more common in older adults.\n\nTypically, “your body has certain compensatory mechanisms to prevent your blood pressure from falling when you stand up,” explains Willie E. Lawrence, MD, a cardiologist with the Lakeland Care Network in St. Joseph, Michigan. But, he adds, “orthostatic hypotension is a problem for some people because these reflexes that should occur don’t occur.” Dehydration or blood loss can also cause orthostatic hypotension.\n\n6 Ways to Prevent High Blood Pressure\n\nHigh blood pressure may lead to stroke, heart attack, vision loss and sexual dysfunction among other things.\n\nSymptoms of Hypotension (Low Blood Pressure)\n\nMost doctors do not consider hypotension to be a problem unless it occurs alongside certain signs and symptoms, per the American Heart Association (AHA).\n\nSome symptoms to watch for include:\n\nConfusion or problems concentrating\n\nDizziness\n\nFainting\n\nFatigue\n\nNeck or back pain\n\nBlurry vision\n\nNausea\n\nHeart palpitations\n\nShortness of breath\n\nWhat Is a Dangerously Low Blood Pressure Number?\n\nAccording to the AHA, no specific number suggests that day-to-day blood pressure is too low, although anything under a 90/60 mmHg reading noted fits the clinical definition of hypotension.\n\nWhen any of the dangerous symptoms listed above accompany a blood pressure reading that suggests hypotension, it is time to seek medical care.\n\nCan Low Blood Pressure Make You Tired?\n\nLow blood pressure can cause weakness and fatigue — that feeling of overwhelming tiredness and lack of energy.\n\nResearch has found an association between low blood pressure and chronic fatigue syndrome, a condition that causes ongoing, profound fatigue that doesn’t get better with sleep, sleep abnormalities that physical exertion often makes worse, and pain.\n\nPotential Causes of Hypotension (Low Blood Pressure)\n\nSome people have naturally low blood pressure, and they don’t experience any symptoms. But for people who are used to normal or high blood pressure, a sudden decrease in blood pressure can signal a problem and can cause symptoms.\n\nPer the AHA, an episode of hypotension is more likely to occur under these conditions:\n\nResuming an upright posture after bed rest for a long period of time\n\nBeing in the first 24 weeks of pregnancy\n\nLoss of a large amount of blood\n\nDehydration\n\nCertain medications, such as blood-pressure-lowering medications, heart medications, Parkinson’s disease medications, tricyclic antidepressants, or medications to treat erectile dysfunction\n\nA heart problem, such as a very slow heartbeat, heart valve problems, heart attack, or heart failure\n\nAn endocrine problem, such as hypothyroidism, parathyroid disease, Addison’s disease (an adrenal gland disorder), low blood sugar, or diabetes\n\nA severe infection that enters your bloodstream\n\nExperiencing anaphylaxis, a life-threatening allergic reaction\n\nA neural disorder that affects your blood pressure\n\nA nutrient deficiency, such as low vitamin B12 and folic acid levels\n\nWhen to See a Doctor\n\nIf your blood pressure is always on the low side and you do not have any of the dangerous symptoms, there is usually no cause for concern.\n\nSimilarly, if you have a single at-home blood pressure reading that is abnormally low without any symptoms, you probably do not need to see your doctor.\n\nIt is normal for your blood pressure to rise and fall over time, and your body is usually able to get your blood pressure back to normal.\n\nBut, Dr. Lawrence advises that, “when you sense there’s a recurrent problem or there’s no clear explanation for what’s happened, you need to seek medical advice.\"\n\nIf your blood pressure drops suddenly and you are experiencing symptoms like dizziness, you should call your healthcare provider. They can assess your situation and rule out underlying problems, such as internal bleeding, serious infection, or an allergic reaction.\n\nTreatment for hypotension will depend on the cause of the low blood pressure. Immediate steps might include the following, according to Mayo Clinic:\n\nWear compression stockings\n\nDrink more water\n\nAvoid low blood pressure triggers like prolonged standing and other positional changes\n\nAfter evaluation, a doctor may make these recommendations:\n\nAvoid alcohol\n\nAdjust your diet\n\nAdjust your medications (possibly lowering dosages of blood-pressure-lowering drugs)\n\nTake blood-pressure-raising medications, such as fludrocortisone (Florinef) and midodrine (ProAmatine)\n\nPeople who experience shock related to hypotension will need emergency treatment to restore blood flow to their organs and raise their blood pressure back to normal.\n\nDetermining whether your low blood pressure is a primary problem or secondary problem is crucial, notes Lawrence. A primary problem means that the body’s reflexes are not working as they should. Secondary causes mean that the low blood pressure is a result of other health problems like dehydration or the effects of certain medications.\n\n“Some antihypertensive [medications] are more likely to cause hypotension than others, and a lot of it is dose-dependent,” says Lawrence. “In most people, there will be some easily identifiable secondary cause or some easy solution to what may even be a chronic problem that has no secondary cause. And that’s why it’s important to see your doctor, so they can make an appropriate assessment.”\n\nKeep track of your blood pressure readings, even if you don’t have any health issues, so that you know what your personal normal reading is. And if you have medical reasons to monitor your blood pressure, talk to your doctor about the blood pressure target range that’s best for you.\n\nResources We Trust\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nWhile low blood pressure, also known as hypotension, can sometimes indicate good health, it may also cause serious symptoms like dizziness, fatigue, or fainting. Hypotension can occur due to sudden blood loss, dehydration, and the effects of certain medications or pregnancy.\n\nWhile blood pressure can fluctuate high or low, understanding your personal normal blood pressure range is crucial for managing potential health risks. Stay hydrated and keep track of your blood pressure readings to prevent the complications of ongoing low blood pressure.\n\nEditorial Sources and Fact-Checking\n\nEveryday Health follows strict sourcing guidelines to ensure the accuracy of its content, outlined in our editorial policy.
