        "text": "The greatest police procedural ever aired... on PBS\n\nIt was amazing and had the best murder mystery episode ever (followed closely by Saved by the Bell). I will forever remember the Fibonacci sequence because of the show. Haven't seen it since it aired but I wonder how many cultural references I missed as a kid.\n\nSquare One in general was my jam. Mathman was such a fun parody and I especially loved it when the tables were turned and Mr. Glitch had to play.\n\nThis fucking kicked ass. On the EXTREMELY rare occasion that our math teacher would roll out the VHS player and TV and put this on, we would all be like YES YES YES YES.\n\nI swear not every episode if Square One Television had a Mathnet segment so when I'd watch and it did have one I always got mad excited.\n\nMathnet, Where In the World is Carmen San Diego, Magic School Bus, Wishbone, and Ghostwriter were my go to educational tv\n\nSquare One inserts in 321 Contact magazine (and the show before we moved) were always a joy for me. I lived overseas while the show was on PBS so i missed out. There was always a Mathnet comic in each issue however. Was always good times.\n\nSide note I wish there was a 321 Contact Magazine archive somewhere, the magazine informed a lot of knowledge for me as a kid. All I could find are scans of Slipped Disk, a column where kids ask computer questions.\n\nIts nice theres clips of the show on youtube though.\n\nThe following story is a fib, but it's short.\n\nSquare One in general was my favorite show as a kid. My favorite segment was probably Mathman, probably cause of the video game reference, but I did enjoy watching Mathnet as well.\n\nExactly the same for me, lol. I remember wishing I could play something with these incredible graphics:"
