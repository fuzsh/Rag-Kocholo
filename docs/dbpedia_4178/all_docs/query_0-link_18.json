        "text": "There was the case of the robber in a monkey suit.\n\nAnd of the woman who staged her own kidnapping.\n\nAnd a woman who seemed to predict earthquakes.\n\nThe ''Mathnet'' team solved them all.\n\nWith calculators in holsters under their uniforms, with deadpan looks and with the background theme of the old ''Dragnet'' detective series, Kate Monday (Beverly Leech) and George Frankly (Joe Howard) have been figuring things out on ''Square One TV'' since the mathematics series for 8-to-12 year-olds made its debut two seasons ago on public television.\n\nNow, the daily half-hour program, which is produced by the Children's Television Workshop - the ''Sesame Street'' crowd - is pleased by some new calculations of its own.\n\nA study of fifth graders in Corpus Christi, Tex., conducted by the workshop, reported that those who watched ''Square One TV'' improved dramatically in problem-solving.\n\nEve R. Hall, the director of research for ''Square One TV,'' said 48 youngsters were tested at the start of the study. Then half of them watched 30 episodes of ''Square One'' and everybody was tested again.\n\nThe Degree of Improvement\n\nViewers improved by an average of 46 percent in the number and variety of techniques they used to solve problems, Ms. Hall reported, and by an average 56 percent in the sophistication and completeness of their answers. Nonviewers did not improve at all, on average, in either category, she said.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
