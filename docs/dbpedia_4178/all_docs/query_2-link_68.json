        "text": "SQUARE ONE TELEVISION (sometimes called SQUARE ONE TV or just SQUARE ONE) was a late 80s/early 90s kids show designed by the Children’s Television Workshop to teach mathematics in creative and fun ways. If you were lucky enough to be an elementary school kid in those days, it’s entirely possible you learned of concepts like Roman numerals or polygons or tessellation from this amazing series.\n\nAside from sketches, cartoons and such, SQUARE ONE would often present information in the form of music videos. Of course, this was a time when MTV actually stood for Music Television and music videos were a burgeoning art form so videos were a great way of educating viewers.\n\nOne of my favorites was called “Archimedes” featuring the late Reg E. Cathey as the Ancient Greek genius and Beverly Mickins singing the catchy tune. I remember being impressed with it way back when and I think it’s still pretty cool.\n\nIf you’re not a fan of “Weird Al” Yankovic, what’s wrong with you? Seriously, the accordion playing musician best known for his parody songs has been entertaining folks for decades and rarely fails to amuse. I recalled a bit he did on the old SQUARE ONE TV – a little number called “Patterns” that extolled the joyous virtue of, well, patterns – and looked to see if it was available on YouTube. It was. It IS. Although the quality is not great (probably recorded from an old VHS tape), it does feature Weird Al in his glorious polka best (plus Dr. Demento as well).\n\nI would note, from what I read online, that apparently Al did not write this tune so it does not appear on any of his albums. So if you are a Weird Al fan and haven’t heard this before, you’re welcome.\n\nWhat LAUGH-IN regular voiced Dirk Niblick of the Math Brigade on SQUARE ONE TELEVISION?\n\nIf you were a kid in the late 80s/early 90s, it’s entirely possible you learned about concepts such as combinatorics and tessellation not in math class but from the delightful SQUARE ONE TV. Produced by the Children’s Television Workshop, SQUARE ONE used music videos, comedy sketches, cartoons and parodies to teach mathematics to young viewers. One of the regular segments was DIRK NIBLICK OF THE MATH BRIGADE, a cartoon in the style of ROGER RAMJET. The main character was a Lieutenant in the titular Math Brigade and solved problems using his skills in mathematics – when he wasn’t talking on the phone to his mom, of course.\n\nAmong the many cool things about this SQUARE ONE segment was that Dirk Niblick had the honor of being voiced by an actor who was seen regularly on the NBC sketch comedy series ROWAN & MARTIN’S LAUGH-IN.

Tune in for Do Not Resist – tonight at 10 on UNC-TV.\n\nSad news for fans of Square One TV. Emmy-winning actor and Square One regular Reg E. Cathey has passed away. He was 59.\n\nExplore the story behind the mostly-forgotten 1920 bombing in the nation’s financial center, which left 38 dead – a crime that launched the career of J. Edgar Hoover yet remains unsolved today. AMERICAN EXPERIENCE relives The Bombing of Wall Street – Tuesday night at 9 on UNC-TV.\n\nOf course, Bill Nye has the coolest friends. Everyone’s favorite Science Guy watched last week’s SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy rocket with none other than astronaut Buzz Aldrin! Continue reading →\n\nIf you watched the 67th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards on Sunday night, you didn’t see a lot of PBS shows taking home awards. In fact, none by my count. A bit of a shame (and I was really pulling for Wolf Hall) but, when a lot of quality shows get nominated, the winner’s margin can be extremely thin. So, cliché as it is, this is honestly is a case of “it’s an honor just to be nominated.”\n\nThat being said, there was a very interesting PBS connection I couldn’t help but notice.\n\nAs you may have noticed, actor Reg E. Cathey won Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for his role in House of Cards. He received the Emmy when the Creative Service Awards were presented a few weeks back (PBS did win a few of those) but made an appearance at Sunday night’s festivities as a presenter.\n\nWell, it’s certainly fair game to point out that Netflix’s House Of Cards is an adaptation of the British mini-series House of Cards – a drama that UNC-TV has broadcast as recently as this year. (And while the Kevin Spacey series is very good, I will always favor the original with Ian Richardson as Machiavellian Tory Francis Urquhart.) But Reg E. Cathey has a far more interesting PBS connection in that he was a regular on a classic kids’ series UNC-TV aired in the late ’80s/early ’90s.\n\nYou may remember Square One TV. Created by the Children’s Television Workshop, Square One may be best known for the Dragnet-parody “Mathnet” but the educational anthology series featured lots of skits, parodies, cartoons, music videos and the like, all designed to teach basic mathematics. Reg E. Cathey was one of the regular performers on the show (I know that’s where I first saw him) so you might say that PBS launched his career.\n\nSo, congratulations to Mr. Reg E. Cathey. You may not have won an Emmy for PBS per se but it’s nice to see a former employee made good.\n\n[Addendum: A quick glance at Cathey’s imdb profile also lists a performance as Guildenstern in a Hamlet adaptation starring Kevin Kline which Great Performances aired in 1990. I have that on VHS somewhere, so I’ll have to fish it out and watch it again.]"
