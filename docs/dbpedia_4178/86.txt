Season 3 refers, collectively, to the 40 episodes that comprise the third season of the PBS series Square One Television.

Season Overview[]

The series' third season would possess the same number of episodes at its second, but there would be more episodes with a listed minor emphasis. The season would introduce segments such as Math-a-thon and Eddie "the Old Philosopher" Lawrence, while retooling game shows such as But Who's Counting?. The show's most prominent sketch, Mathnet, would also be moved from Los Angeles to New York in order for Sesame Workshop to have more control over its production.
