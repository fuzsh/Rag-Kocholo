See SQL Compliance for the SQL syntax.\n\nConnecting from C/C++\n\nSee Getting Started for the prerequisite information you need to deploy the driver and configure the connection to API. Connecting shows how to connect with ODBC functions.\n\nExecuting SQL\n\nUse ODBC functions to execute SQL to API:\n\nSee Querying Data to execute SELECT statements and iterate over the results.\n\nSee Modifying Data to execute other SQL data manipulation statements.\n\nSee Parameterized Statements to execute parameterized statements. Parameterized statements provide a means to efficiently execute queries more than once and to mitigate SQL injection attacks.\n\nSee Discovering Schemas to obtain schema information, such as the available tables, columns, keys, and types. See Data Model to obtain the driver metadata by querying the available system tables.\n\nExecuting Stored Procedures"
