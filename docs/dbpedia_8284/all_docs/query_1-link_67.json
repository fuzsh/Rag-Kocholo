Thus, it seems logical to focus on the free MySQL clients for Linux too. However, the catch with free software is that it often has functional limitations and lacks support. Therefore, in this article, we focused on the capabilities of both free and paid solutions.\n\nOne more condition is always a big advantage when considering the best SQL client Linux version. It is the support.\n\nIf the software provides quality and comprehensive documentation, a forum where one can discuss different issues and share tips, you will work with it more efficiently. It does not matter if you are a beginner or an established professional. When reviewing different tools, we paid special attention to the factor of user support.\n\nConclusion"
