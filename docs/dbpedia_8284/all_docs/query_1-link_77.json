        "text": "MySQL Tutorial\n\nMySQL is the most popular and a free Open Source Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). An RDBMS system stores the data in the form of tables that might be related to each other. MySQL uses Structured Query Language (SQL) to store, manage and retrieve data, and control the accessibility to the data. It is one of the best RDBMS being used for developing web-based software applications.\n\nMySQL is written in C and C++. Its SQL parser is written in yacc, but it uses a home-brewed lexical analyzer.\n\nMySQL works on many system platforms, such as, Linux, macOS, Microsoft Windows, AIX, BSDi, FreeBSD, HP-UX, ArcaOS, eComStation, IBM i, IRIX, NetBSD, Novell NetWare, OpenBSD, OpenSolaris, OS/2 Warp, QNX, Oracle Solaris, Symbian, SunOS, SCO OpenServer, SCO UnixWare, Sanos and Tru64.\n\nThis tutorial will give you quick start with MySQL and make you comfortable with MySQL programming.\n\nMySQL Examples\n\nConsider an example table CUSTOMERS created in the MySQL database. This table contains the details of customers like ID, NAME, AGE, ADDRESS, SALARY.\n\nID NAME AGE ADDRESS SALARY 1 Ramesh 32 Ahmedabad 2000.00 2 Khilan 25 Delhi 1500.00 3 Kaushik 23 Kota 2000.00 4 Chaitali 25 Mumbai 6500.00 5 Hardik 27 Bhopal 8500.00 6 Komal 22 Hyderabad 4500.00 7 Muffy 24 Indore 10000.00\n\nSince MySQL uses SQL to manage data, it also uses almost all DDL, DML and DCL statements. For instance, the following DML statement lists the records of all customers who are 25 years old.\n\nSELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE AGE = 25;\n\nFollowing records are displayed as a result-set −\n\nID NAME AGE ADDRESS SALARY 2 Khilan 25 Delhi 1500.00 4 Chaitali 25 Mumbai 6500.00\n\nMySQL Online Editor\n\nIn this tutorial, we provide a MySQL Online Editor which helps you to Edit and Execute the MySQL code directly from your browser. Click on the icon to run the following MySQL code to be executed on the CUSTOMERS table and retrieve the records matching with the given condition.\n\nSELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE NAME = 'Chaitali';\n\nThis Online Editor will save you the time to install the MySQL setup in order to execute any query. Try our MySQL Online Editor now.\n\nWhy to Learn MySQL?\n\nMySQL is generally faster, more secure and efficient than other relational databases.

It organizes data into tables with rows and columns. Users can interact with MySQL using SQL (Structured Query Language) to perform operations like inserting, updating, and querying data. The system works by processing SQL commands to manage and retrieve data efficiently.\n\nWho developed MySQL?\n\nMySQL was developed by Swedish company MySQL AB, founded by David Axmark, Allan Larsson, and Michael \"Monty\" Widenius. It was later bought by Sun Microsystems in 2008, which was subsequently acquired by Oracle Corporation in 2010.\n\nHow to install MySQL?\n\nYou can install MySQL from the MySQL Installer Community, along with other MySQL products you require. The MySQL Installer will allow you to install a certain version of MySQL or you can customize the installation as per your requirements.

If you want to check the server version, you can use:\n\nmysql -u your_username -p -e \"SELECT version();\"\n\nReplace \"your_username\" with your MySQL username, and you will be prompted to enter your password. After entering the password, the command will display the MySQL server version.\n\nHow do I access my MySQL database?\n\nTo access your MySQL database, you can use the MySQL command-line client or a graphical user interface (GUI) tool. Here are the basic steps for both:\n\nUsing MySQL Command-Line Client\n\nOpen terminal/command prompt.\n\nEnter: mysql -u your_username -p.\n\nEnter your password when prompted.\n\nUsing GUI Tool (e.g., MySQL Workbench)\n\nDownload and install the tool.\n\nCreate a new connection with your details.\n\nTest the connection.\n\nUse the GUI to manage your MySQL database.\n\nWhat are the main features of MySQL?\n\nMySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) known for its ease of use and scalability. Its main features include support for SQL queries, efficient data storage and retrieval, and robust transaction management, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from small websites to large enterprise systems. Additionally, MySQL offers strong security measures and a vibrant community for support and development.\n\nHow to Start, Stop, and Restart MySQL Server\n\nTo start, stop, or restart the MySQL server, you can use the command-line interface. The exact commands may vary depending on your operating system. Here are instructions for different operating systems:\n\nWindows:\n\nTo Start MySQL Server: Open a command prompt with administrator privileges and run the following command: net start mysql.\n\nTo Stop MySQL Server: Open a command prompt with administrator privileges and run the following command: net stop mysql.\n\nTo Restart MySQL Server: You can stop and start the MySQL service using the commands mentioned above. Alternatively, you can use the MySQL Notifier or the Services application to restart the MySQL service.\n\nLinux (Ubuntu/Debian):\n\nTo Start MySQL Server: sudo service mysql start.\n\nTo Stop MySQL Server: sudo service mysql stop.\n\nTo Restart MySQL Server: sudo service mysql restart.\n\nmacOS:\n\nTo Start MySQL Server: sudo brew services start mysql.\n\nTo Stop MySQL Server: sudo brew services stop mysql.\n\nTo Restart MySQL Server: sudo brew services restart mysql.\n\nThese are general commands, and depending on your specific setup, you might need to adjust them. Also, note that on Linux, the service management commands may vary depending on the distribution (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS).\n\nRemember to replace \"mysql\" with the actual service name if it's different in your system.\n\nWhat is MySQL Schema?\n\nA MySQL schema can simply be defined as a blueprint of the database. It stores all the information of the tables, its attributes and entities. As MySQL is a relational database management system, it is important to have schema as it also represents the relationship between the attributes and entities of multiple tables."
