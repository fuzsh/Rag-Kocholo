        "text": "MySQL Workbench is an application written mostly in C++. There are platform specific parts written in C# (Windows) and Objective-C (Mac). Frameworks used for the GUI are:\n\n.NET on Windows\n\nGTK on Linux\n\nCocoa on Mac\n\nPlugins can be created using either C++, Python or Lua. A big part of the administrator section in MySQL Workbench has been written in Python. The platform specific parts are wrapped by a thin layer called mforms that is used by the application and can be accessed by plugins (including those written in Python or Lua). The first version was created on Windows using Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 and later enhanced for Mac OS X and Linux.\n\nUpdate:\n\nBeginning with version 6.1 Lua support has been removed.\n\nUpdate 2:"
