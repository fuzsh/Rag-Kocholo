        "text": "Why is a database schema required?\n\nIn enterprise relational databases, schemas act as a top-level organizations structure. A schema typically maps to a single problem domain such as shipping or billing or user preferences. For cloud-native developers who follow the 12-Factor App guidelines, one schema typically maps to a single microservice.\n\nFurthermore, most JDBC drivers require a schema name to create a JDBC connection to the database.\n\nSchemas and the JDBC URL\n\nThe schema is part of the connection URL and the JDBC driver requires it at runtime to figure out which database tables are available for manipulation.\n\nWithout a database schema, your data-driven apps go nowhere.\n\nSteps to create a schema in MySQL\n\nFortunately, it’s not hard to create a database schema in MySQL, especially if you have the MySQL Workbench tool at your disposal. Just follow these steps:\n\nOpen the MySQL Workbench\n\nClick the Create Schema option\n\nProvide a schema name\n\nClick apply to create the MySQL scheme\n\nThe MySQL workbench executes the required SQL statement under the covers, and the schema is listed in the tool.\n\nWith the schema created, you can now provide any JDBC drivers, Hibernate config or JPA persistence.xml file the name of the database URL with the schema name attached. That allows your Java programs to connect to the database.\n\nOnce you’ve created the schema, you can then create database tables, add columns and rows, insert data and perform CRUD operations.\n\nYour ability to manipulate relational data is only limited your knowledge of JPA, Hibernate and the JDBC APIs."
