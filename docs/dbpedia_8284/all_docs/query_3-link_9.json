        "text": "Adding data handling capabilities to your application or website can make it more user-friendly and enable you to store information obtained from users. MySQL, a free software application, helps you build applications that manipulate data tables. After setting it up, you can manage passwords, remember user settings and even display products for sale on a Web page. MySQL's MySQL Workbench helps you use MySQL productively.\n\nMySQL\n\nMySQL, not affiliated with Microsoft SQL Server, is a relational database management system that allows you to store information in multiple tables that have relationships. A Customer table, for instance, might hold customer information along with a key field that links the table to a Sales table that contains critical sales data. Your application can store information in these tables and retrieve it as needed. SQL server developers may feel comfortable working with MySQL because of the many similarities between the two-database management systems.\n\nManaging MySQL\n\nYou must enter commands to communicate with MySQL. You can do this by typing statements using the command line utility that comes with the software. This utility is fine for performing small tasks such as running a quick query or opening a database. However, to manage a complex database application productively, you may need to create tables, add data to them and perform other tasks that would require a bit of typing. Several third-party developers provide user-friendly tools with graphical user interfaces that help you manage MySQL efficiently.\n\nMySQL Workbench\n\nMySQL also distributes a user-friendly database management tool named MySQL Workbench. Download it from MySQL's website to use the program to perform data modeling, system administration and a variety of other tasks needed to keep a successful data-driven application running smoothly. The software is free, and you must register to download it. After the setup file downloads, double-click it and follow the instructions as a wizard guides you through the installation steps.\n\nProgram Features\n\nSetting up users and securing tables is a critical task needed to safeguard an application's information. MySQL Workbench has separate windows that allow you to set up user IDs, assign privileges and even view event logs that track database activity. MySQL's Editor helps you to create queries quickly, edit them and view query results on multiple tabs. Rerun old queries instantly from the program's History panel. Managing database connections also gets easier when you let the program's Connections Wizard assist you with that task.\n\nReferences\n\nResources\n\nWriter Bio\n\nAfter majoring in physics, Kevin Lee began writing professionally in 1989 when, as a software developer, he also created technical articles for the Johnson Space Center.
