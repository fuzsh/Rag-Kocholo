        "text": "While MySQL and SQL are used in relational database management systems, they serve different functions.\n\nWhat they are\n\nSQL is a programming language that you can use to query and process information in a relational database. You can use SQL to add, update, or retrieve data within a database. In 1986, the American National Standards Institute made SQL the official standard for relational databases. The International Organization for Standardization followed in 1987.\n\nIn contrast, MySQL is a relational database management system. As a relational database management system, you can use MySQL to store and manage data using tables. You can create tables and define relationships between them. You can also use multiple techniques—like indexes, transactions, and normalization—to store and retrieve data while maintaining consistency and accuracy.\n\nHow they work\n\nSQL implementation involves a server machine that processes the database queries and returns the results. Your SQL query goes through several software components, including the following:\n\nA parser tokenizes the SQL query statement and checks it for accuracy\n\nA relational engine plans the best way to run the query\n\nA database engine performs the physical storage operations\n\nThe default database engine in SQL is Microsoft SQL Server, owned and maintained by Microsoft.\n\nIn contrast, MySQL has several more software components for data management and storage optimization. MySQL components include the SQL parser and relational engine. However, the database engine in MySQL is InnoDB, owned and maintained by Oracle.\n\nWhile both are database management tools, there are several differences between Microsoft SQL Server and MySQL.\n\nPlatform support\n\nMySQL and SQL Server both support different platforms.\n\nSQL Server supports many platforms, but not nearly the same quantity as MySQL. SQL Server primarily supports Windows, with cloud deployment options for Linux and macOS via Docker.\n\nMySQL supports more platforms than SQL Server. You can install MySQL on most operating systems, including Linux, macOS, Windows, Oracle Solaris, OpenBSD, and HP-UX.\n\nProgramming language support\n\nThese are some programming languages that SQL Server supports: C++, Java, Python, PHP, Go, Ruby, and Delphi.\n\nMySQL supports the languages that SQL Server does and more, including Perl, Haskel, and TCL. Part of the appeal of MySQL is that it supports so many programming languages. This makes it a flexible choice for developers to use.\n\nFeatures\n\nAs they are both relational database management systems, MySQL and SQL Server offer many of the same features. They are both high-performing and can manage projects of varying sizes. Equally, they can host multiple databases on a single server and use indexes to sort data and optimize performance. However, there are some features that MySQL has that SQL Server does not, and the opposite is also true.\n\nFor example, you can use SQL Server to filter through multiple tables without performing individual searches. You can also stop a query without stopping the backup process.\n\nWith MySQL, you would have to run various statements, as you can only filter on an individual database level. With MySQL, you must also stop the entire process to cancel a query execution.\n\nScalability\n\nWhen you increase the number of rows in SQL Server, there isn’t much increase in response time. That is why most developers consider SQL Server a highly scalable technology. In its paid version, SQL Server has a number of features that help it scale more effectively. These features include compression, advanced partitioning, and in-memory technology.\n\nWhen the number of data rows increases in MySQL, you also experience an increase in the time it takes to do things.\n\nPerformance\n\nMySQL and SQL Server are both high-performance relational database management systems. You should consider both databases as powerful, scalable, and reliable.\n\nSQL Server offers query optimizer and columnstore indexes to optimize performance. As you increase database workloads, SQL Server typically performs slightly better than MySQL.\n\nMySQL uses connection pooling and query caching to optimize performance.\n\nQuery language and syntax\n\nSQL Server and MySQL both use SQL to query the database. You can use SQL commands and SQL statements to interact with them. This is the standard language for managing relational databases. However, MySQL and SQL Server differ slightly in syntax, including for the create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) commands.\n\nSQL Server uses INSERT to add new data to a table. To delete data, SQL Server uses SELECT FROM and DELETE FROM. SQL Server uses double quotes to enclose tables.\n\nMySQL uses INSERT INTO to add new data to a table. To delete data, MySQL uses SELECT and DELETE. MySQL uses backticks to enclose tables.\n\nConnectors and integration support\n\nThe connectors and integrations that SQL Server offers work better with other Microsoft products. For example, it offers Microsoft ADO.NET, ODBC Driver, and JDBC Driver. You can also connect to Azure Data Studio and other Microsoft-based products.\n\nMySQL starts with MySQL Workbench, which you can use to design and create databases. As an open-source tool, it also comes with several additional APIs and connectors that you can use.\n\nProduct support & documentation\n\nBoth SQL Server and MySQL are mature technologies. So, there’s a lot of documentation online that you can find and read.\n\nSQL Server is Microsoft’s proprietary software, which means you have to pay to use it in most cases.\n\nMySQL is open source and is under the General Public License, version 2. While you can pay for additional support, most MySQL versions are free.\n\nSecurity Features\n\nSQL Server and MySQL both have a range of security features that protect against data breaches, unauthorized access, and similar major security threats.\n\nWith SQL Server, you can’t access files during run time. Additionally, SQL Server has a range of other features that restrict unauthorized user access, like role-based access control. SQL Server also provides row-level security to protect sensitive data and dynamic data masking.\n\nThey are binary collections, but developers can use MySQL to manipulate databases while they’re running. Because of this, you can consider MySQL as less secure than SQL Server\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) has many offerings to support your SQL and MySQL requirements.\n\nAmazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a collection of fully managed services that make it easy to set up, operate, and scale relational databases in the cloud. Amazon RDS supports seven popular engines, two of which are SQL Server and MySQL.\n\nAmazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for SQL Server supports Enterprise, Standard Edition, Web, and Express Editions for SQL Server versions 2014, 2016, 2017, and 2019.\n\nAmazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for MySQL supports MySQL Community Edition versions 5.7 and 8.0.\n\nYou can also choose the cloud-centered solution Amazon Redshift instead of SQL Server or MySQL. It uses SQL to analyze structured and semi-structured data across data warehouses, operational databases, and data lakes. Amazon Redshift uses AWS-designed hardware and machine learning to deliver the best price-performance at any scale.\n\nHere are ways you can benefit from using Amazon Redshift:\n\nBreak down data silos and gain real-time insight into all your data\n\nGain up to five times the performance against any other cloud data warehouse\n\nGet data insight in seconds, without worrying about data infrastructure management\n\nGet started with MySQL and SQL Server on AWS by creating an account today."
