        "text": "MySQL Workbench (Download and Installation)\n\nMySQL Workbench is a unified visual database designing or graphical user interface tool used for working with database architects, developers, and Database Administrators. It is developed and maintained by Oracle. It provides SQL development, data modeling, data migration, and comprehensive administration tools for server configuration, user administration, backup, and many more. We can use this Server Administration for creating new physical data models, E-R diagrams, and for SQL development (run queries, etc.). It is available for all major operating systems like Mac OS, Windows, and Linux. MySQL Workbench fully supports MySQL Server version v5.6 and higher.\n\nMySQL Workbench covers five main functionalities, which are given below:\n\nSQL Development: This functionality provides the capability that enables you to execute SQL queries, create and manage connections to the database Servers with the help of built-in SQL editor.\n\nData Modelling (Design): This functionality provides the capability that enables you to create models of the database Schema graphically, performs reverse and forward engineering between a Schema and a live database, and edit all aspects of the database using the comprehensive Table editor. The Table editor gives the facilities for editing tables, columns, indexes, views, triggers, partitioning, etc.\n\nServer Administration: This functionality enables you to administer MySQL Server instances by administering users, inspecting audit data, viewing database health, performing backup and recovery, and monitoring the performance of MySQL Server.\n\nData Migration: This functionality allows you to migrate from Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite, Microsoft Access, PostgreSQL, Sybase ASE, SQL Anywhere, and other RDBMS tables, objects, and data to MySQL. It also supports migrating from the previous versions of MySQL to the latest releases.\n\nMySQL Enterprise Supports: This functionality gives the support for Enterprise products such as MySQL firewall, MySQL Enterprise Backup, and MySQL Audit.\n\nMySQL Workbench Editions\n\nMySQL Workbench is mainly available in three editions, which are given below:\n\nCommunity Edition (Open Source, GPL)\n\nStandard Edition (Commercial)\n\nEnterprise Edition (Commercial)\n\nCommunity Edition\n\nThe Community Edition is an open-source and freely downloadable version of the most popular database system.

Click the table, which will open a new window where the upper section shows the MySQL statement, and the lower section shows the data rows.\n\n3. To enter a data row, select the respected column, and insert the data value. Inserting data value in rows is similar to the Microsoft Excel Worksheet.\n\n4. After entering the data rows, click on the Apply->Apply>Finish button to save the data rows.\n\n5. Similarly, we can edit or modify the previously saved data rows. After modification, save new value, click on the Apply button to save changes. It will generate an SQL update statement save the changes to the database.\n\nDelete Row\n\n1. To delete an individual row from the table, you need to select a data row, right-click on the right icon in front of the row and select Delete Row(s) option.\n\n2. Now, click Apply->Apply->Finish button to save changes to the database.\n\nMySQL Workbench Export and Import Database(Table)\n\nIn this section, we are going to learn how we can export and import the database or table by using the MySQL Workbench.\n\nExport Databases(Tables)\n\n1. To export databases or tables, go to the Menu bar, click on Server, and select the Data Export option, as shown in the following screen. It will open a new window of data export settings and options.\n\n2. Select any database, and it will display all the corresponding tables under the selected database. Here, we can also select one or multiple database checkboxes to include the database in the Export file. Similarly, we can select one or multiple tables from the left section of the window.\n\n3. Let us select two databases, namely (myproductdb and mystudentdb), including all tables under this database. Now, go to the drop-down setting, we can select 'Dump Structure and Data', 'Dump Data Only', and 'Dump Structure Only' option.\n\nDump Data and Structure: It will save both table structure and data rows.\n\nDump Data Only: It will save only the inserted rows in the tables.\n\nDump Structure Only: It will save only the table structure, which are database columns and data types defined by us.\n\n4. In the Export option, you can select the export path of your choice. Here, I will keep the default setting. Also, there are two radio buttons that are explained below.\n\nExport to Dump Project Folder: It will save all the tables as separate SQL files under one folder. It will be useful when you import or restore the export file one by one table.\n\nExport to Self-Contained File: It will store all the databases and tables in a single SQL file. It is a good option when you want to import all the databases, tables, and data rows using a single SQL file.\n\n5. Click the Start Export button, which displays the progress bar and log. Now, open the Document folder in your system to locate the export files.\n\nImport Databases (Tables)\n\n1. To import databases or tables, go to the Menu bar, click on Server, and select the Data Import option. It will open a new window of data import settings and options.\n\n2. Here, you can see the two radio options to import databases and tables, which are:\n\nImport from Dump Project Folder\n\nImport by using Self-Contained File\n\n3. We are going to select 'Import from Dump Project Folder' and click on 'Load Folder Content' to display all the available databases in the project folder.\n\n4. Select myproductdb database from the Data Import option and also select the corresponding product table.\n\n5. Choose the 'Dump Structure and Data' option and click the Start Import button to import the databases and tables from the backup file.\n\n6. Now, go to the Schema->myproductdb->table and refresh it to see the currently imported database or table."
