        "text": "Arvid Eichner\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n6 min read\n\n·\n\nOct 23, 2023\n\n--\n\nMySQL is one of the most popular open-source relational database management systems, and MySQL Workbench is a powerful graphical tool for managing and interacting with MySQL databases. If you’re looking to set up MySQL and MySQL Workbench on your Windows machine, this step-by-step guide will walk you through the installation process.\n\nBefore we begin, make sure you have the following:\n\nA Windows computer (Windows 7 or newer)\n\nAdministrative access to your computer.\n\nStep 1: Download MySQL Installer\n\nOpen your web browser and navigate to the MySQL website at https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/.\n\nScroll down to the “MySQL Installer” section, make sure “Microsoft Windows“ is selected under Select Operating System and click on the “Download” button for the MySQL Installer MSI (both the 2.4M and 331.3M version will work)\n\nN ote: This guide uses screenshots that might be hard to read on mobile.\n\nOn the next page, you’ll be prompted to log in or create a MySQL account. You can choose “No thanks, just start my download.”\n\nStep 2: Install and Configure MySQL\n\nLocate the installer file you just downloaded (e.g., mysql-installer-web-community-x.x.xx.x.msi) and double-click it to run the installer.\n\nIn the installer window, choose “Full” under “Setup Type.” This option will install MySQL Server, MySQL Workbench and other components, such as documentation and examples. Then click “Next.”\n\nYou can also choose “Custom” and only install MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench.\n\nIn the next window, just click “Execute.”\n\nAfter all products have been downloaded sucessfully, as indicated by the green checkmark, click “Next.”\n\nIn the next window, just click “Execute.”\n\nAfter all products have been installed sucessfully, click “Next” to start the configuration.\n\nUnder “Type and Networking” choose “Development Computer” as Config Type and leave everything else as is. Then click “Next.”\n\nNext, you will be asked to choose an authentication method. For increased compatibility, choose “Use Legacy Authentication Method” and click “Next.” Choosing “Use Strong Password Encryption” will also work.\n\nIn the “Account and Roles” window, choose a new password for your root account. Be sure to choose a strong password and enter the password under MySQL Root Password and Repeat Password then click “Next.”\n\nIn the next window, leave everything as is and click “Next.”\n\nNext, grant full access to let the Installer update server file permissions and click “Next.” Click “Execute” to apply the configuration changes.\n\nOnce the configuration is done (green checkmarks), click “Finish.”\n\nThat’s the first step done. You just downloaded and installed MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench. In the next step, we will configure MySQL Router and “Samples and Examples”. Both Services are part of the full Installation. If you chose a custom installation earlier, you can skip ahead to Step 3.\n\nClick “Next” to start the configuration.\n\nUnder “Connect To Server” enter the password you chose earlier under Password and click “Check.”\n\nIf the password was correct, a green checkmark will appear and the status of the connection will change to “Connection succeeded.”\n\nClick “Next.”\n\nClick “Execute” to apply the configurations.\n\nOnce the configuration is completed (green checkmarks), click “Finish.”\n\nThat’s it! The installation is complete. You can now choose whether MySQL Workbench and Shell should be launched — we only need MySQL Workbench right now.\n\nClick “Finish” and MySQL Workbench will launch.\n\nStep 3: Using MySQL Workbench\n\nAt the end of the installation process, MySQL Workbench should launch automtically. If it doesn’t, start the programm manually. You are greeted by the graphical user interface (GUI) tool for MySQL, the MySQL Workbench.\n\nIn the bottom half of the window under “MySQL Connections” you should see one tile for your local instance connection, Local instance MySQL80.\n\nGo ahead and double-click it.\n\nIn the new window, enter the password you chose earlier and click “OK.”\n\nAaaand we’re in. You are now connected to your MySQL Server and can start using the MySQL Workbench.\n\nLet’s quickly look at the most important components of the user interface:\n\nNavigator\n\nThe Navigator is typically located on the left-hand side of the MySQL Workbench GUI. It serves as a central hub for database management and navigation. It houses some administrative features and a handy tree-like structure of all your databases under the tab “Schemas.”\n\nQuery\n\nThe “Query” tab, located in the middle of the workspace area, is where you can write and execute SQL queries. This is where you interact with your MySQL databases using SQL commands.\n\nOutput\n\nThe “Output” tab, usually positioned at the bottom of the MySQL Workbench interface, displays various types of information and feedback. This includes feedback on the (successful) execution of your SQL queries, any error messages, and status updates regarding your MySQL server.\n\nStep 4: Testing the Connection\n\nTo test your connection, use the following steps:\n\nIn MySQL Workbench, open a new query tab by clicking the “+ SQL” icon in the top left corner or selecting “File” > “New Query Tab.”\n\nYou can use a basic SQL query to test the connection. For example, you can run a query to display the current date and time:\n\nSELECT NOW();\n\nThis query will retrieve the current date and time from the MySQL server. If you receive a result with the current date and time, it confirms that your connection to the MySQL server is working.\n\nEnter SELECT NOW() into the new query tab.\n\nClick the “Execute” button (lightning bolt symbol) or press Ctrl+Enter to execute the query.\n\nIf the query executes successfully and you see the current date and time in the result pane, it means that your connection to the MySQL server is functioning correctly. If you get an error or don’t see any results, it could indicate a connection issue. In that case, double-check your connection settings, including the hostname, port, username, and password, and ensure your MySQL server is running.\n\nThat’s it. With MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench installed and configured, you are now ready to import or create your databases and query them."
