        "text": "MySQL Workbench Tutorial\n\nThe video shows step-by-step how to build your database schema & relations with the MySQL Workbench software.\n\nThis is an easy way to create your internal/external relations with foreign keys.\n\nOnce your database structure & relations are ready, the next step will be to open the CRUD Generator and begin to generate your Admin Panel content.\n\nAbout MySQL Worbench\n\nMySQL Workbench is a unified visual tool for database architects, developers, and DBAs. MySQL Workbench provides data modeling, SQL development, and comprehensive administration tools for server configuration, user administration, backup, and much more. MySQL Workbench is available on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.\n\nhttps://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/\n\nMySQL Workbench is free software provided by the MySQL team. It enables you, after setting up your connection, to create your tables, fields and relationships, and integrate them into diagrams.\n\nThe diagrams provide a functional visual of the model, which you can edit right away using a range of tools (creating/editing relationships, adding fields, etc.).\n\nYou then export to your database to synchronise it.\n\nIn short, MySQL Workbench makes working with your databases much more pleasant, simple and efficient than using the PHPMyAdmin interface.\n\nLet's take a closer look at how to get started.\n\nCreate your database with phpMyAdmin\n\nMySQL Workbench requires a connection to a database, so it must first be created with PHPMyAdmin.\n\nOpen PHPMyAdmin in your browser\n\nClick the New button on the top left, enter a name for your new database, choose the charset in the dropdown menu (usually \"utf8_general_ci\" is a good choice) then click create.\n\nConnect MySQL Workbench to your server\n\nNow that you have created your database, the second step is to connect MySQL Workbench to it.\n\nOpen MySQL Workbench, then go to database => manage connections.\n\nCreate a new connection and enter your connection settings:\n\nhostname (\"localhost\" for a connection on your local server)\n\nport (usually \"3306\")\n\npassword\n\ndefault schema ; you can choose your database here, or leave it blank for a global connection.\n\nTest your connection, then close the settings window.\n\nCreate a new Model and schema\n\nClick file => new model in the main menu. It creates a new project with a database named mydb.\n\nDouble-click the mydb tab to open it and enter your real database name.\n\nCreate your tables & fields\n\nClose the database tab to go back to the main screen.\n\nFrom here you can create your tables, add and parameterise your fields by selecting the appropriate options (Data type, primary key, not null, auto-increment, etc).\n\nAdd a new Diagram\n\nNow we will create a diagram, which will then allow us to create the relationships between the tables in a few clicks.\n\nClose your table tab then double-click the Add Diagram from the main screen.\n\nThis opens the diagram window.\n\nThe Catalog tree on the left shows your database schema with its tables.\n\nDrag and drop the tables you want to add to the diagram into the main area.\n\nNote that MySQL Workbench allows you to create several different diagrams in the same project, which is recommended if you have many tables. This will allow you to group the different logical parts of your project, and have a more readable view of each.\n\nYou can also create a global diagram that includes all your tables, and several sub-diagrams.\n\nCreate your relations (add foreign keys)\n\nNow that your diagram is in place you can create the relationships between your tables.\n\nThe foreign key fields will be created and named automatically.\n\nSeveral types of relationships are available from the toolbar:\n\n1:1 non-identifying\n\n1:n non-identifying\n\n1:1 identifying\n\n1:n identifying\n\nPour des explications sur les diff√©rents types de relations, voir le tutoriel The different kinds of relationships in a MySQL database\n\nTo add a relationship between two tables:\n\nSelect the appropriate relationship type from the toolbar\n\nIn the diagram, click on the header of the table you want to add the relational field to\n\nThen click on the header of the table you want to link\n\nYour relationship is generated. You can see the arrow that links the two tables in the diagram. When you hover the mouse over your relationship it is highlighted, along with the relevant fields: primary key of the origin table, relational fields of the destination table.\n\nExport your database from Mysql Workbench to your server\n\nSo far we have been working with MySQL Workbench, but nothing has been transferred to the MySQL server.\n\nMySQL Workbench allows you to synchronise your databases in both directions, easily and securely. Here is how to export from the software to your MySQL server:\n\nIn the main menu, go to database => synchronize model.\n\nIn the opened window, check your connection settings, and enter the name of your database in the \"default schema\" field, then click next.\n\nIn the next step you are given options to skip certain synchronisations. You can ignore them and go to the next step.\n\nClick the next button until you reach the \"Model and data difference\" screen (screenshot below).\n\nMySQL Workbench will connect to your database, retrieve and analyse its data.\n\nFrom the \"Model and data difference\" screen:\n\nThe Model is the MySQL Workbench database schema\n\nThe Source is the server database schema\n\nFrom the \"update\" column, you can double-click the arrows to choose the direction of synchronisation for each table.\n\nThen click the next button.\n\nIt'll show a preview of the SQL statements that will be sent to your server.\n\nClick the Execute button to finalize the synchronisation, and MySQL Workbench will do the magic.\n\nIn addition to allowing you to structure your databases in a simple and efficient way, MySQL Workbench of course offers many options and possibilities.\n\nYou can for instance export diagrams in different formats (image, pdf), which allows you to share them with your co-workers or customers.\n\nFurthermore, after saving your project in .wmb format you can reload it and start synchronising it on another server, which allows you to recreate and even share your database with a few clicks."
