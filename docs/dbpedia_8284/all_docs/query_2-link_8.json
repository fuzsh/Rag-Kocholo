        "text": "MySQL was created as an extension to the commercial programming language, SQL, which was based on the relational model described in Edgar F. Codd’s paper. The Swedish company MySQL AB, founded by David Axmark, Allan Larsson, and Michael Widenius, developed and released MySQL in 1995. The name \"MySQL\" is a combination of Michael Wildenius' daughter’s name \"My\" and “SQL,” which refers to Structure Query Language (SQL). Sun Microsystems acquired MySQL AB in 2008. MySQL is currently under the ownership of Oracle Corporation after the acquisition of Sun Microsystems in 2010.\n\nMySQL was originally developed in C and C++ programming languages and has enjoyed lots of popularity for its many versions over the years because of its availability on many open source and proprietary operating systems. The latest version of the database, MySQL version 8.0, was released in 2018.\n\nThe MySQL project was forked many times over the years due to various reasons with some forks not even existing anymore. Of the remaining forked projects, the most popular ones are MariaDB and Percona Server for MySQL. MariaDB was forked by the original founders of MySQL to make sure that MySQL remains open source after commercialization concerns arose from the Oracle acquisition. Percona Server for MySQL is another open source distribution of MySQL which intends to maintain close compatibility with MySQL. Learn more about versions of MySQL and the complete ecosystem around MySQL.\n\nMySQL can be accessed either through a graphical user interface (GUI) or command line interface tools.\n\nGraphical user interface (GUI)\n\nGUIs provide an integrated environment consisting of buttons and interaction widgets making the querying and development of applications a visual experience, as opposed to using text-based commands in a command line interface. There are many MySQL GUIs developed by both the MySQL open source project and third-party integrators. One of the more popular ones is MySQL Workbench, which is also open source and was developed by MySQL AB. Some other well known GUIs are phpMyAdmin, an administration tool popular for web application development, and HeidiSQL, an open source administration tool that can be used for administering other databases besides MySQL.\n\nCommand line\n\nMySQL can also be accessed through command line tools. These tools, also referred to as MySQL utilities, are shipped with MySQL distribution and are invoked with text commands either in the MySQL shell or other command line interface tools like the Percona Toolkit.\n\nA user can deploy MySQL manually on their own physical machine, using the open source code, or it can be deployed by downloading one of the packaged distributions. MySQL is most commonly installed on a single instance or machine with vertical scaling as the primary way to improve performance. However, MySQL can be set up in a replicated configuration with one primary node and many secondary nodes, which have the ability to be promoted to primary in case of instance failure.\n\nAnother increasingly popular way of hosting MySQL is through cloud service providers (CSPs). There are a couple of ways of deploying MySQL in a cloud service provider's environment. One is by installing MySQL directly on a virtual machine and self managing it. The other is through the use of managed offerings of cloud service providers that make the administration of MySQL a lot easier by taking care of many operational aspects of managing MySQL. Google Cloud offers a managed service in the form of Cloud SQL. Cloud SQL for MySQL is a fully managed database service that helps you set up, maintain, manage, and administer your MySQL relational databases on Google Cloud, reducing the toil on database administrators and helping organizations innovate by offering Value-Add Services around security, high availability, and observability. Learn how to set up a Cloud SQL instance of MySQL from this article on best practices of setting up a Cloud SQL for MySQL instance. Migrating to Cloud SQL for MySQL from on-premises MySQL or from another database in a cloud service provider is made very easy and simple with many tools and options available to the user.\n\nTo understand the advantages of and differences between the fully managed offering of Cloud SQL for MySQL and self-managed MySQL, visit the article on MySQL hosting options."
