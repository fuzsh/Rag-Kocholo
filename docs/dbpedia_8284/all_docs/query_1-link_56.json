        "text": "Introduction\n\nIn this tutorial, you'll learn how to connect to a PlanetScale database using a MySQL GUI. While this tutorial uses Sequel Ace as a demonstration, many applications that connect to MySQL databases will support connecting to and querying a PlanetScale database as long as the applicaton supports connecting over SSL.\n\nGather the credentials\n\nTo connect to a PlanetScale database, you'll need four pieces of information:\n\nThe database name\n\nHost name\n\nUsername\n\nPassword\n\nThe easiest way to gather this information is by selecting the Connect button from the Dashboard tab. Then, on the Connect page, select the branch that you wish to connect to and click the Create password button. Within the Select a language or framework section, select \"Other\" to display the connection details as a list instead of a language or framework-specific connection string.\n\nNote\n\nAs a security best practice, passwords are only displayed when they are created.\n\nConnect to the database\n\nIn the application you are using, enter the access information you gathered in the previous step into the appropriate fields. Make sure to check \"Require SSL\" as SSL is required to connect to a PlanetScale database. Click \"Connect\" once you are finished.\n\nIf the connection is successful, you should be able to query your database and perform other supported operations.\n\nCaveats\n\nWhile many standard MySQL statements are supported, there are a few caveats worth calling out:\n\nEach branch of a PlanetScale database is considered an isolated MySQL database. You'll need separate connection details per branch.\n\nProduction branches with safe migrations enforce the use of branching and deploy requests to safely make schema changes and do not support direct DDL as a result. However, DDL is supported on development branches and production branches without safe migrations enabled (not recommended).\n\nCreating new databases is not supported using any GUI tool.\n\nTested GUIs\n\nThe following MySQL GUI applications have been tested and confirmed to work with PlanetScale databases:\n\nSequel Ace\n\nTablePlus\n\nMySQL Workbench\n\nJetBrains DataGrip\n\nNeed help?"
