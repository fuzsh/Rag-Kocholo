        "text": "The Workbench Scripting Shell provides a means for expanding MySQL Workbench. Through the use of the scripting shell, MySQL Workbench can support new behavior and data sources using code written in languages such as Lua and Python.\n\nThe scripting shell is not only useful for expanding MySQL Workbench. By using a script file from within the scripting shell you can perform repetitive tasks programmatically from the command line.\n\nThe default development language is Lua, a lightweight scripting language expressly designed for extending applications. For more information about this language see lua.org.\n\nThe Python language is also supported, further details of this language can be found from the official Python site.\n\nThe programming language to be used in Workbench Scripting Shell can be selected from the General tab of the Workbench Preferences dialog. The Workbench Preferences dialog can be displayed using the main menu item Edit, Preferences."
