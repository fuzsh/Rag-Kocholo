Unfortunately, I'm facing problems:\n\nIn the Object Browser, when I click on my DB and right click on tables to create one, I can not insert any column (disabled) and therefore, can not insert tables. check this: Can not create table in MySQL workbench 5.2.40\n\nI can create table from the EER model. But even though, I faced problems when tried to connect my Java application to this database. MySQL and Java: table doesn't exist\n\nI have searched, and not sure from this, some of what I found is that workbench have probelms with Windows 7 - 64 bit (any idea if this is correct??). The only version I found was for 68, it installed successfully but I'm having probems.\n\nI want to downlod MySQL server but before that: Will Mysql Server give me the same features that the workbench does? I need to work with GUI (insert, delete, update,..etc).\n\nEDIT:\n\nAlso, the table I added using the EER are not visible in the Object browser. I only can see the schema in the Object browser without any table underneath it."
