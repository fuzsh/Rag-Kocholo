        "text": "Constructing Knowledge Through SQL Coding\n\nOur MySQL computer science course content emphasizes students applying and exploring the information presented within the context of PostgreSQL databases. To provide a thorough introduction to SQL, a code editor accompanies each page with new concepts so students can see for themselves how the computer responds to code. In addition, the content provides code snippets to get students started as well as suggested avenues for investigation.\n\nIn order to maximize their benefit from this course, students should possess a basic understanding of thePython programming language. You will use data structures like lists, tuples, and dictionaries to help manage SQL query results. Students will use Python to establish connections to a database, execute SQL queries, and manage the data returned by these queries. This involves using specific libraries (like PyGreSQL), creating connection objects, and executing SQL commands through cursor objects or the custom Db.query wrapper provided by PyGreSQL.\n\nLowering the Barrier to Entry\n\nThe materials for this introductory SQL course are designed to align with the current needs of computer science education, meeting students at their level of understanding. Like any specialized community, computer science has its own jargon. The formal teaching of computer science should not burden students with the assumption that they are fluent in this special language.\n\nThe material is presented in smaller units that are more manageable for the students. The same vocabulary and concepts are covered, but in a more approachable way - state things as plainly as possible, and, when appropriate, use images, tables, or lists.\n\nAnother way in which our intro to SQL programming content is more approachable is that it uses many small programs instead of one large program. Research shows that a variety of smaller problems increase student performance and reduce stress. Using many small programs leads to students spending a sufficient amount of time on their work, and they do not wait until the last moment to begin their work."
