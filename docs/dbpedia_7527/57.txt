Hans Grundig, who graduated from the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts, was a German painter with a distinct social attitude. After the Nazis came to power, he was forbidden to continue his professional work. Despite the prohibition, he created his best pieces in the late 1930s. One of them was The Sign of the Future — the first sketch for Grundig’s famous triptych “The Thousand Year Reich.” The tragic death of our civilization with its emptiness and fantastical images of mad animals creates the scene of a modern Apocalypse.
