        "text": "Fellow radiophiles,\n\nI have recently been reading several accounts, mostly by our Hans Knoll, of the post-war story of the \"Heinzelmann\" line of radios made at RVF-Grundig starting around 1946.\n\nThe design of these radios appears to be the continuation of the DKE (Deutche Klein Emfaenger) series of radios before the war, that were built around a regenerative triode or tetrode detector front end and a power tetrode driving intially a high impedance reed speaker, then later a moving coil speaker with an audio transformer. The prewar half wave rectifier tube gave way to the selenium rectifier in the Heinzelman radios.\n\nIf I understand correctly from the German language account given by Hans Knoll, the last of these single tuned circuit radios was the Grundig Gloria 51W, that derived it's name from the model line of Lumophon that had been acquired by Grundig in 1951.\n\nMy question is: Where did the \"Heinzelmann\" name come from, and does it have a special meaning in German that does not come across in a translation by Google?\n\nBest regards,\n\n-Joe\n\nTo thank the Author because you find the post helpful or well done.\n\nHallo Joe, even as I am not living in Cologne, I try to explain this expression:\n\nThere is a tale from Cologne that \"Heinzelmännchen\", little gnomes, lutins or dawarfs doing good things. In this tale, they come every night to to the work of the Cologne citizens, in the morning, all work is done. The citizens could be lazy the whole day long.\n\nThis help has foun it's end after a curious tailor's wife put peas on the floor, this made the gnomes slip and fall, she wanted to see the helpers. They were very annoyed and disappeared, since then, the Cologne citizens had to work for themselves.\n\nThe \"Heinzelmann\" in this case stands for a little helper, doing al lthe work for You, as the little gnomes from Cologne did.\n\nYou might find more about this topic by searching Wikipedia for \"Heinzelmännchen\" (this is simply plural form) with a poem of the original tale.\n\nA little bit off -topic: another company used little dwarfs / kobolds as a mascot: the \"Mainzelmännchen\" had their short appearence in animated cartoons coming from 2nd German Television Channel, Mainz. The go their name because of a ressemblance of hard-working little gnomes and the hard-working television people from Mainz ZDF production center.\n\nYou might have look at the current website or a nice compilation found on Youtube, there are examples of animated cartoons use before the weather forecast.\n\nKind regards Martin Boesch\n\nTo thank the Author because you find the post helpful or well done."
