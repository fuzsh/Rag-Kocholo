        "text": "Hello Robert, Your question was:\n\nDo you, or any other radiomuseum member know if the information was translated into English.\n\nMy answer is:\n\nI think, but I am not sure, this technical information is not translate to english.\n\nI believe I have seen a reference for an export model as Grundig 5040W/3D \"Ausfuhrung B\" . . .\n\nThat's possible, but I don't now!\n\nI have only a' information and a' question in the past Years from Great Britain, some on looks for Infos to this 5040W 3D \"GB\" or \"U\" ( U means USA)\n\nI am beginning the complete restoration of this impressive model, and would be most appreciative of any technical hints.\n\nDon't stopp!\n\nI have performed some service (in 1976-1978) on the \"signal sensing tuners\" employed in the US automobile radios of the mid-1950s. . . .with the \"Wonder Bar\" tuning.\n\nIs the Grundig system quite similar with an unlatching and locking (stop) mode dependent upon signal strength?\n\nNo, this is not a searching Type, like SABA from the late fivties or sixties , and not like a Car -Radio with automatic searching and store, its only a' memory like \"favorite - or last - Station - Memory\".\n\nSome US Table models for Medium - Wave used this Feature in the fivties.\n\nWell I am happy that I can give a small Information.\n\nRegards from Hans M. Knoll\n\nTo thank the Author because you find the post helpful or well done.\n\nHallo Robert, here my statement to your questions!\n\nSome off your questions was:\n\nI understand how the tuning motor causes the tuning capacitor and dial pointer to\n\ntravel from right to left (and left to right). I believe the reversing feature activates as the tuning capacitor reaches full open or full closed. Am I thinking correctly?? I am sorry, no!\n\nI will give you a example,\n\n\"A\" Given is, the Set comes as new from the factory. In the MW1 Memory is loaded = 600kcs. on MW2 Memo is loaded = 1500kcs. On FM1 Memo is loaded = 90Mcs And on FM2 is loaded 100Mcs.\n\nWhen the lever: \"Motor- Abstimmung\"is in \"off position, the unit works like a simple Radio -set.\n\n\"B\" At next we suppose,The automatic is always \"off\" you have tuned by hand first, on MW1 range to 900kcs, on then MW2 to 1200kcs, and also on FM1 to 95 Mcs and at least, on FM2 to 97Mcs. The automatic is always \"off\" . If you chance the Band -buttons now, from FM2 to MW2, or FM1 and at next to MW1 the Unit toes nothing. The Pointer is fixed mechanical on the last given position of 97Mcs.\n\nIn this moment, when you switch on the lever: \"Motor- Abstimmung\", the unit tuned by using the Motor to 600kcs when you have selected MW1, on MW2 to 1500kcs, on FM1 to 90Mcs and on FM2 to 100Mcs . this are the factory loaded frequencies.\n\nThe reason is, this positions are programmed on Factory in the Memory. see \"A\"\n\n\"C\" And now\n\nIf you tune the Set by hand, and to not switch the lever: \"Motor- Abstimmung\" in \"off\" position, any of your information, made from you goes now in the memory. I have called before < last station memory> mostly used for the favourite Station.\n\nThis process always repeat if you not switch \"off \" the lever: \"Motor-Abstimmung\".\n\n\"D\" or\n\nIf you tune and have switch, before, the lever: \"Motor- Abstimmung\" in \"off\" position, ( the standard for receives far Stations) this information goes not in the memory. And now, when you switch \"on\" the lever: \"Motor- Abstimmung, your last (favourite) station comes back.\n\nO.K.?\n\nYou:\n\nI suppose the user must activate the EIN-AUS lever to select the desired station as it slowly passes by, since the motor stops VERY abruptly as the lever is moved to AUS.\n\nNo, is not correct! During the Motor move the Pointer, the Sound is \"off\".\n\nAnd Moving the Lever, during the Motor is in action, the Memory ( rotate connectors) was killed!!Very bad thing!\n\nO.K. Robert, I think its enough for the moment . It is very hard for me, to write this difficult Processes in English.\n\nReading is good, searching for words, hard!\n\nBest regards from Hans, in Franconia near Nuremberg\n\nTo thank the Author because you find the post helpful or well done."
