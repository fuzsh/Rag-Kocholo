Before SB I have recorded over 150 songs for different artists, musicians and producers in my studio, and now I also want to expand my services here on Soundbetter.\n\nIf you like to hear some of the songs I play drums on you can check out this Spotify playlist:\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/playlist/50sSVIrMkrHZtIoF9jgeBL?si=cbee3e21da214984\n\nProcess:\n\n- You send me the song(s) and let me know what you'd like. Links to references are helpful.\n\n- I record the song(s) and email you an Mp3 of your song with my drum take. Then we can talk about changes etc. Once you're happy I send all tracks and a Drums-stereomix.\n\nWhat I need from you:\n\nA rough mix of your song without drums (and also with drums if you have), the BPM. A split between the vocals/lead-instrument from the rest of the instruments is helpful for monitoring.\n\nThe drum kit (Ludwig Classic Maple or Premier Genista) is fully miked up and I use high quality gear including analog preamps that contribute to a warm, fat and good classic drumsound. I use different snares and cymbals that I change between.\n\nI'd love to hear about your project. Click the 'Contact' button above to get in touch."
