        "text": "Well done to the French National Assembly üëè Here's some fun (quite sickening!) facts on (the) fast(est) fashion: Shein drops around 10,000 new items on its website daily. It produces a few hundred of these styles and makes more IF people start to buy them. (So at a bare minimum this is 1 million pieces of clothing PER DAY.) At any one time, they have around 500,000 styles on their website. Calculate this into a year and you are looking at 356, 000, 000 pieces of clothing (at a minimum) from one brand each year in the world. The quality might ensure a couple of wears (if any! You've seen the hauls, right?), then it's binned. Here's a little more ... the manufacturer's rapid use of virgin polyesters and huge consumption of oil churns out the same amount of C02 as around 180 coal-fired power plants. Feel ill about this yet?\n\nOther than being stylish, M.J. Bale customers are shopping with Australia‚Äôs first fully carbon neutral fashion brand, covering both products and organisation.‚Äù I discovered this while flipping through an M.J. Bale book/magazine and I couldn‚Äôt be more thrilled! I would encourage those who can, to support M.J. Bale as their go-to for professional attire. They are leading the fashion industry and achieving a ‚Äúcarbon neutral status‚Äù a decade before most organisations aim to. They have also been able to measure Scopes 1-3 effectively, which is another obstacle organisations are currently facing, especially Scope 3. This achievement is huge and I am excited to see how they influence Australia‚Äôs fashion industry. #mjbale #fashion #fashionindustry #australianfashion #carbonneutral #sustainable #scopeemissions #circularity #professionalattire #australia #cscadvisory #sydney\n\nFrance slows down fast fashion? Last Thursday, France's National Assembly (the lower house of the French Parliament) made history by pioneering the global fight against fast fashion. Implementing groundbreaking legislation, the new bill, which reins in the industry's rampant excess, imposes an environmental charge on low-cost items and bans fast fashion advertising, including social influencer ads. From 2025, France will be implementing a surcharge to help reduce the environmental impact of fast fashion. Each item will be subject to a ‚Ç¨5 fee, increasing to ‚Ç¨10 by 2030. This charge will be capped at 50% of the item's price tag. With this commitment, France will showcase that it is both fashionable AND sustainable. This bill is still to be greenlighted by a vote by the French Senate, allowing it to be published in a decree, but hopefully this is only as a matter of time. Where France leads the way, I wonder when the UK will follow... #fastfashion #sustainability #france\n\nOther than being stylish, M.J.

This initiative is a testament to France's commitment to environmental protection and sets a precedent for global action against fast fashion's harmful practices. I applaud this milestone and continue pushing for a fashion industry that values both beauty and sustainability. Together, we can create a brighter and greener future for fashion! ‚ôªÔ∏èüëó Read more in the article from The Guardian in my comment below. ‚¨áÔ∏è #SustainableFashion #EnvironmentalProtection #FranceLeadingTheWay #FastFashion #Regulations #Leadership üì∏ : Vestiaire Collective Maximilian Bittner Fanny Moizant\n\nToday, we are at the dawn of a new era üí• We are pleased to see that the French National Assembly Assembl√©e nationale will be discussing today a bill brought forward by Anne-C√©cile Violland.

The nation‚Äôs fashion image speaks a similar effect to its natural beauty being sighted for the first time ‚Äì modest (or a somewhat quiet luxury that has risen to fame recently) ‚Äì and unapologetic, attracting the eyes of envious fashion enthusiasts that can‚Äôt help but chase that materialistic yearning for something new. In other words, it‚Äôs like when foreigners and visitors alike arrive to get a taste of Australia‚Äôs glorious sunshine, only to crave it constantly once they‚Äôve returned home. From one extreme to the other, pioneers are encapsulating this polarity quite seamlessly ‚Äì leading the way for Australian style. Those mentioned below are simply pioneers in the wake (for it would be too difficult to spotlight every patron of the luxury scene). We present you, Aussie It girls who are dominating the fashion universe. Read more on #CSPTimes"
