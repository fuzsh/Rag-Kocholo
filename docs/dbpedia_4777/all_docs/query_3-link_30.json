As James Madison reasoned in The Federalist Papers: ``If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels governed men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: You must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place, oblige it to control itself.'' It is precisely for the purposes of government controlling itself that Congress investigates. A century after Madison, another thoughtful authority on Congress, Woodrow Wilson, judged the ``vigilant oversight of administration'' to be as important as legislation. Wilson argued that because self-governing people needed to be fully informed in order to cast their votes wisely, the information resulting from a Congressional investigation might be ``even more important than legislation.'' Congress, he said, was the ``eyes and the voice'' of the nation. In 1948, the Senate established the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to continue the work of a special committee, first chaired by Missouri Senator Harry Truman, to investigate the national defense program during World War II. Over the next half century, the Subcommittee under our predecessor Chairmen, Senators John McClellan, Henry Jackson, Sam Nunn, William Roth, and John Glenn, conducted a broad array of hard-hitting investigations into allegations of corruption and malfeasance, leading repeatedly to the exposure of wrongdoing and to the reform of government programs. The phase of the Subcommittee's history from 1953 to 1954, when it was chaired by Joseph McCarthy, however, is remembered differently. Senator McCarthy's zeal to uncover subversion and espionage led to disturbing excesses. His browbeating tactics destroyed careers of people who were not involved in the infiltration of our government. His freewheeling style caused both the Senate and the Subcommittee to revise the rules governing future investigations, and prompted the courts to act to protect the Constitutional rights of witnesses at Congressional hearings. Senator McCarthy's excesses culminated in the televised Army-McCarthy hearings of 1954, following which the Senate voted overwhelmingly for his censure. Under Senate provisions regulating investigative records, the records of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations are deposited in the National Archives and sealed for fifty years, in part to protect the privacy of the many witnesses who testified in closed executive sessions. With the half century mark here relative to the executive session materials of the McCarthy subcommittee, we requested that the Senate Historical Office prepare the transcripts for publication, to make them equally accessible to students and the general public across the nation. They were edited by Dr. Donald A. Ritchie, with the assistance of Beth Bolling and Diane Boyle, and with the cooperation of the staff of the Center for Legislative Archives at the National Archives and Records Administration. These hearings are a part of our national past that we can neither afford to forget nor permit to reoccur. Carl Levin, Chairman. Susan M. Collins, Ranking Member. Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. INTRODUCTION ---------- In 1954, the investigators found themselves the subject of investigation. Senator Joseph R. McCarthy stepped aside temporarily as chair of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations after the United States Army accused him and chief counsel Roy Cohn of having demanded special treatment for the subcommittee's former consultant, G. David Schine, then an army private. Senator McCarthy rebutted that the army had held Schine hostage in order to silence the subcommittee's investigations. A special subcommittee, chaired by Senator Karl Mundt, then attempted to unravel these charges. Senator McCarthy, Cohn and executive director Francis Carr served as the principals in the investigation, along with Secretary of the Army Robert T. Stevens, Army Counsel John G. Adams, and Assistant Secretary of Defense H. Struve Hensel. The Army-McCarthy hearings were televised nationally and captured public attention. They resulted in an erosion of the senator's public standing, and contributed to his censure by the United States Senate that December. Revising the Subcommittee's Rules In the months leading up to the Army-McCarthy hearings, Senator McCarthy faced several challenges to his chairmanship of the permanent subcommittee. Eight senators died in office during the Eighty-third Congress, including Majority Leader Robert Taft, which from time to time gave Senate Democrats a numerical advantage, even though Republicans officially retained their majority status and held the committee chairmanships. Complicating matters for the permanent subcommittee in July 1953 were the resignations of all three of its Democratic members--Senators John McClellan, Henry Jackson, and Stuart Symington--over the subcommittee's hiring practices. During their absence, Senator McCarthy was often the only subcommittee member to attend its closed hearings, many of which he held out of town with little advance notice. Republican senators on the subcommittee had other Senate business to attend to in Washington. Senator Everett Dirksen and Senator Charles Potter occasionally sent staff to represent them at the hearings, and Senator McCarthy allowed them to interrogate witnesses. Unaware of this development, Senator Potter eventually dismissed his staff delegate, Robert Jones, for misrepresenting his position. On a few occasions, even Senator McCarthy was not present and staff interrogatories replaced hearings. David Schine sometimes presided, with Roy Cohn conducting the interrogation and addressing Schine as ``Mr. Chairman.'' \\1\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ Charles E. Potter, Days of Shame (New York: Coward-McCann, 1965), 152-159; Staff interrogatory, October 30, 1953. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Democrats' continued boycott jeopardized the subcommittee's appropriation at the opening of the second session in January 1954. Arizona Senator Carl Hayden, the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, threatened to cut off the subcommittee's funds for lack of a ``majority vote.'' At the same time, Iowa Senator Guy Gillette called on the Senate to restrict the subcommittee's freewheeling scope and prohibit it from overlapping other committees' jurisdictions. Senator McCarthy described these efforts as ``a vote against the exposure of spies and saboteurs,'' and asserted that it was ``a natural thing for left-wing Democrats to try to stop the exposure of treason.'' \\2\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\2\\ New York Times, January 15, 1954; Chicago Tribune, January 3, 7, 15, 1954. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Senator Karl Mundt, a South Dakota Republican who served on the Government Operations Committee, sought to mediate between the chairman and Democrats. At a closed meeting on January 14, 1954, Senator McCarthy agreed to the Democrats' demand that they be permitted to hire a minority counsel. The subcommittee formally adopted these rules: 1. Future staff members as well as all present members shall be confirmed by a majority of the subcommittee. 2. The minority shall select for appointment to the subcommittee staff a chief counsel for the minority who shall, upon being confirmed, work under their supervision and direction; who shall be kept fully informed as to investigations and hearings, have access to all material in the files of the subcommittee, and, when not otherwise engaged, shall do other subcommittee work. 3. The minority counsel shall be hired at a salary not to exceed the maximum allowed Senate employees. An increase of $16,000 on Senate Resolution 19 will be requested to cover the salary and travel, per diem, allowance, and incidental expenses. 4. A clerk already on the staff, acceptable to it, shall be assigned to the minority and it is understood that when she is not busy she will do any work assigned to her on the subcommittee. 5. It is understood that before a voucher is submitted to the chairman for a new employee, that an FBI investigation be conducted--a full field investigation requested. 6. No public hearing shall be announced or held if the minority members unanimously object, unless the Committee on Government Operations by majority vote approves of a public hearing.\\3\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\3\\ Congressional Record, 83rd Cong., 2nd sess., 1101. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- When Democrats returned to the subcommittee they selected as their counsel a former subcommittee staff member, Robert F. Kennedy, the younger brother of Massachusetts Senator John F. Kennedy. The full committee then voted unanimously to approve the subcommittee's appropriation. In the Senate chamber, Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas cast the sole vote against the appropriation.\\4\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\4\\ Congressional Record, 83rd Cong., 2nd sess., 1085-1103. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- With criticism of investigative tactics mounting, the Republican Policy Committee in February 1954 proposed new rules under which a vote of the full committee would be necessary to authorize any subcommittees; hearings would be prohibited unless a quorum was present; and committees were restricted from delegating subpoena power, initiating an investigation, holding a hearing outside of the District of Columbia, or taking confidential testimony unless authorized by a majority of committee members. Witnesses subpoenaed would have the right to counsel. Only senators and authorized staff personnel could interrogate witnesses. The policy committee unanimously approved these rules and forwarded them to the Senate Rules Committee. The Rules Committee chose to let individual committees set their own investigative standards and procedures. The next year, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations adopted rules similar to those that the policy committee had recommended:\\5\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\5\\ Donald A. Ritchie, A History of the United States Senate Republican Policy Committee, 1947-1997, S. Doc. 105-5 (Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1997), 43-44. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. An investigating subcommittee of any committee may be authorized only by the action of a majority of the committee. 2. No investigating committee or subcommittee is authorized to hold a hearing to hear a subpoenaed witness or take sworn testimony unless a majority of the members of the committee or subcommittee are present: Provided, however, That the committee may authorize the presence of a majority and a minority member to constitute a quorum. 3. An investigating committee or subcommittee may not delegate its authority to issue subpoena except by a vote of the committee or subcommittee. 4. No hearing shall be initiated unless the investigating committee or subcommittee has specifically authorized such hearing. 5. No hearing of an investigating committee or subcommittee shall be scheduled outside of the District of Columbia except by the majority vote of the committee or subcommittee. 6. No confidential testimony taken or confidential material presented in an executive hearing or an investigating committee or subcommittee or any report of the proceedings of such an executive hearing shall be made public, either in whole or in part or by way of summary, unless authorized by a majority of the committee or subcommittee. 7. Any witness summoned to a public or executive hearing may be accompanied by counsel of his own choosing, who shall be permitted while the witness is testifying to advise him of his legal rights.\\6\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\6\\ Congressional Record, 83rd Cong., 2nd sess., 2970. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- McCarthy and the Army The subcommittee's investigation of Communist infiltration of the army eventually focused on two principal subjects: Irving Peress, an army dentist, and Annie Lee Moss, a Pentagon file clerk. Both appeared only fleetingly before the subcommittee, but with considerable consequence. During the autumn of 1953, the subcommittee had looked into charges of subversion and espionage at the Army Signal Corps laboratories at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. Security officers abruptly suspended forty-two employees as security risks, and Senator McCarthy began calling them as witnesses. Many had graduated from the engineering program at the City College of New York (CCNY) where they had sat in classes with Julius Rosenberg. Since Rosenberg had worked at Fort Monmouth during the Second World War, suspicions arose that he had operated a spy ring within the laboratories. Army officials at first cooperated with the investigation, with Secretary of the Army Robert T. Stevens and the army's counsel John G. Adams attending executive sessions. Relations grew strained, however, when President Dwight D. Eisenhower refused to allow army security board members to be identified and questioned by the subcommittee. The president withheld other requested materials on the grounds of executive privilege. Discovering that an army dentist suspected of being a member of the Communist party had been promoted to major, and then honorably discharged, Senator McCarthy raised the question: ``Who promoted Peress?'' He further demanded the names of those who had cleared Peress' discharge. Peress' commanding officer, Brigadier General Ralph Zwicker, cited an executive order that forbade him from divulging such information. ``Then, General, you should be removed from any command,'' the chairman stormed. ``Any man who has been given the honor of being promoted to general and who says, `I will protect another general who protected Communists,' is not fit to wear that uniform, General.'' General Zwicker's executive session testimony was made public on February 22, 1954, and caused some alarm even among the senator's strongest supporters. An editorial in the Chicago Tribune suggested that McCarthy learn to ``distinguish the role of investigator from the role of avenging angel.'' Since McCarthy's clash with Zwicker has already been published, it is not included in this edition of executive sessions, but the volume does contain an exchange between the senator and Lt. Colonel Chester T. Brown that immediately preceded General Zwicker's testimony, when the senator used equally abusive language: ``I think, may I say this, that any man in the uniform of his country, who refuses to give information to a committee of the Senate which represents the American people, that that man is not fit to wear the uniform of his country.'' Army counsel John G. Adams noted that Senator McCarthy's supporters on the Government Operations Committee initially tried to strike from the record his verbal assault on General Zwicker, but they had ``underestimated the efficiency of the stenographic company.'' The army had already received copies of the transcript. Learning this, the committee voted to release the controversial exchange.\\7\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\7\\ John G. Adams, Without Precedent: The Story of the Death of McCarthyism (New York: W. W. Norton, 1983), 79, 129. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The subcommittee had gotten the name of Annie Lee Moss from an FBI informant, Mary Stalcup Markward, who told them that she had seen ``a woman by the name of Annie Lee Moss on the list of card-carrying, dues-paying members.'' However, Markward could not recall having met Moss personally. Moss, an African American, had worked in a government cafeteria before getting a job as an Army Signal Corps communications clerk at the Pentagon in 1950. She had been cleared by loyalty boards of the General Accounting Office in October 1949 and by the army in January 1951. In September 1951, the FBI raised questions about Moss, and offered Markward's testimony as evidence, but the army did not reopen the case. Senator McCarthy described Moss herself as ``not of any great importance,'' but he demanded to know: ``Who in the military, knowing that this lady was a Communist, promoted her from a waitress to a code clerk?'' Due to ill health, Moss did not attend an executive session and made her first appearance before the subcommittee at a televised public hearing on March 11, 1954.\\8\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\8\\ Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Army Signal Corps-- Subverision and Espionage, part 8 (Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1954), 314-29. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The army described Annie Lee Moss' position as a relay machine operator who received and transmitted ``unintelligible code messages.'' When the charges against her became public, the army first transferred her to a supply room and then suspended her entirely. At the public hearing, Moss denied having been a member of the Communist party, having paid any dues, or having attended any party meetings. She testified that her late husband had received copies of the Daily Worker, although she was uncertain whether they had been addressed to him or to her. Moss had paid dues to a cafeteria-workers' union in 1943, but could not say whether the union had any Communist party connections. Appearing frail and perplexed at the hearing, she seemed an unlikely espionage agent even to Senator McCarthy, who left midway through her testimony. The hearing was replayed on Edward R. Murrow's popular See It Now television program and proved a public relations blow to the chairman. The army eventually reinstated Annie Lee Moss, placing her in its finance and accounts office. In 1958 the Subversive Activities Control Board confirmed Markward's assertion that Moss' name had appeared on the Communist party rolls in the mid-1940s. But the board conducted no further investigation of Moss, and the following year it concluded that ``Markward's testimony should be assayed with caution.'' \\9\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\9\\ Thomas C. Reeves, The Life and Times of Joe McCarthy (New York: Stein and Day, 1982), 548-50, 667-69, 766-67; David M.

And other than that, she knew little about the world outside. She was a widow. In those days, when the Communist Party was really campaigning in black areas to recruit blacks to join the Communist Party, they were very active. I know in Chicago, when people were evicted, Communists would come and move their furniture and everything else back into these houses, and they would bring baskets of food. They launched a serious campaign in the black community. Well, Mrs. Moss' husband was one of those who had been contacted by the Communists. He was just a simple working man, but they were sending him free subscriptions to the Daily Worker, the organ of the Communist Party. And I don't know what he did with them, but when he died, they kept coming, these papers, and they piled up on her back porch, some with the wrappings still on them. She never paid any attention to it; the Bible was her thing.'' \\10\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\10\\ Ethel Payne oral history, 1987 Washington Press Club Foundation, 39-40. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Peress and Moss cases further eroded Senator McCarthy's relations with the army. Then the controversy escalated when the army charged that McCarthy and Cohn had demanded special privileges for the subcommittee's former chief counsel, David Schine. Ruth Watt, chief clerk of the subcommittee since 1947, had observed that Cohn and Schine operated outside the normal rules for Senate staff. Rather than work out of the subcommittee's limited quarters, they had rented office space in a nearby office building. Schine, as a consultant, was not on the subcommittee's payroll and could not be reimbursed for his expenses. Watt noted his ten- dency to place long-distance calls to notify friends whenever he expected live television coverage of the subcommittee's hearings. ``Then when the bill came, it was personal, I wasn't going to pay it,'' she explained. ``So Roy Cohn ended up paying his telephone bills.'' Schine once signed Senator McCarthy's name to a letter to the Senate Rules Committee asking permission for Cohn and Schine to have access to the ``Senators' Baths,'' a pool and steam room reserved exclusively for senators. When the chairman of the Rules Committee informed Senator McCarthy that the request could not be granted, McCarthy, who had known nothing about it, simply nodded and said he knew that and would inform his staff.\\11\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\11\\ Ruth Watt oral history, 107-8; Nicholas von Hoffman, Citizen Cohn (New York: Doubleday, 1988), 177-78. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- That pattern of seeking special privilege continued after Schine was drafted into the army as a private. Schine made numerous requests for passes and release from basic training, which Cohn demanded of army officials. Senator McCarthy, by contrast, seemed indifferent to special treatment for Schine. During a monitored telephone conversation in November 1953, Senator McCarthy had told Army Secretary Stevens: ``For God's sake, don't put Dave in service and assign him back to my committee. If he could get off weekends--Roy--it is one of the few things I have seen him completely unreasonable about. He thinks Dave should be a general and work from the penthouse of the Waldorf.'' Secretary Stevens had expected Senator McCarthy to turn the Fort Monmouth investigation over to the army after the initial inquiry, but began to suspect that Roy Cohn was pursuing the investigation more aggressively as leverage to win favors for Private Schine.\\12\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\12\\ Special Subcommittee on Investigations of the Government Operations Committee, Special Senate Investigation in Charges and Countercharges Involving: Secretary of the Army Robert T.

Carr, 83rd Cong., 2nd sess., Part 10 (Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1954), 377-78. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The resulting Army-McCarthy hearings were played out before televised audiences. Only a few closed-door executive sessions were held. Rather than leading the questioning, both Senator McCarthy and Roy Cohn were called upon to testify. Reviewing his own testimony, Cohn saw things that had managed to elude him during his previous year as subcommittee counsel. ``I was rambling, garrulous, repetitive,'' he admitted. ``I was brash, smug, and smart-alecky. I was pompous and petulant.'' Cohn had a similarly negative assessment of Senator McCarthy's performance at the hearings: ``He complained bitterly of being interrupted . . . and yet he came charging in on everyone else's testimony time and again with his `point of order, Mr. Chairman, point of order.' He used the words so often they were taken up by countless comedians and had a vogue as a national catch-phrase. His language toward his opponents was often less than parliamentarian. He was verbally brutal where he should have been dexterous and light; he was stubbornly unwilling to yield points where a little yielding might have gained him advantage; he frequently spoke before thinking of the effect of his words; he was repetitious to the point of boredom.'' Cohn recognized that McCarthy was addicted ``to dramatic techniques in presenting information,'' and was ``impatient, overly aggressive, overly dramatic. He acted on impulse. He tended to sensationalize the evidence he had.'' The Senator ``would neglect to do important homework and consequently would, on occasion, make challengeable statements.'' These were the qualities that McCarthy revealed to television audiences, and that the army's counsel Joseph Welch employed so effectively against him.\\13\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\13\\ Roy Cohn, McCarthy (New York: New American Library, 1968), 181, 208, 223, 275, 277. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Investigating Communists in the Defense Industry The Army-McCarthy hearings consumed the better part of the session and delayed other subcommittee business, but Senator McCarthy was anxious to develop a new investigation of Communist involvement in the defense industry. Both before and after the Army-McCarthy hearings, the subcommittee looked into the activities of the United Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers (UE), which had organized workers at General Electric and Westinghouse plants. UE had once been the third largest union in the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). In 1941, UE president James B. Carey had been defeated for reelection largely after refusing to follow the Communist party's line on foreign policy. The union had supported the war effort throughout World War II, but in 1946 it conducted a massive strike against GE for increased wages. During the Eightieth Congress (1947-1948) enactment of the Taft-Hartley Act required union leaders to sign non-Communist affidavits, and several top UE officials had refused to comply. In 1948 the House Un-American Activities Committee had investigated the UE and heard testimony that the union's secretary-treasurer Julius Emspak and director of organization James J. Matles were members of the Communist party. Both Emspak and Matles cited the Fifth Amendment in refusing to answer the committee's questions. Senator McCarthy entered in the debate in 1950 when he denounced the United Electrical union as ``one of America's worst security risks,'' and accused the UE of representing the ``interests of the Kremlin'' rather than of GE workers and management. Prior to the subcommittee's investigation, the Senate Labor Committee had also looked into the role of Communists in the UE. By then the CIO had expelled the UE for being Communist dominated. A rival International Union of Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers (IUE), headed by the UE's former president Carey, won elections in most General Electric plants, although the UE remained the bargaining agent at GE plants in Lynn, Massachusetts; Erie, Pennsylvania; and Schenectady, New York. In 1952 and 1953, articles in the Saturday Evening Post and Reader's Digest had linked the UE with ``spies in our defense plants.'' In 1954, the IUE defeated the UE for the right to represent GE workers in Schenectady. As a result of this turmoil, General Electric concluded that its labor problems stemmed in large part from poor communications with its employees and the community. In September 1954, GE hired the actor Ronald Reagan (who at that time was known as a liberal anti-Communist) to promote better public relations through speaking engagements and by hosting its weekly television program, General Electric Theater.\\14\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\14\\ Congressional Record, 81st Cong., 2nd sess., A7002; Herbert R.

Knowland denied permission for committee hearings to be held outside of Washington for the remainder of the session. At that juncture, the subcommittee also underwent major changes in its staff. Under pressure, Roy Cohn resigned as chief counsel in August 1954. Cohn never again held a government post. As a private attorney he was frequently reprimanded for unethical conduct, and was tried and acquitted in 1964, 1969, and 1971 on charges of conspiracy, bribery and fraud. He was eventually disbarred in 1986, just prior to his death. In his books and later interviews, Cohn conceded that Senator McCarthy's ``penchant for the dramatic'' and exaggerated claims and accusations had invited much of the critical storm that engulfed them, but he always insisted that McCarthy had performed ``a substantial service to the country by alerting the country to the menace of communism when most people in this country were not tuned in to how deadly it was.'' Cohn discounted charges that their investigations had ruined people and cost them their livelihood. ``Name one,'' he challenged. Looking back, Cohn concluded: ``I can live to be 300 years old and do all sorts of things. . . . and when I die, when I'm referred to, it's going to be as Joe McCarthy's counsel.'' \\15\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\15\\ Cohn, McCarthy, 94-95; New York Times, August 3, 1986; Washington Post, December 22, 1985. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- G. David Schine, whose army service caused so much commotion, disengaged from the political sphere and spent the rest of his life in Hollywood as a motion picture producer, winning an Academy Award for The French Connection. He also made a guest appearance as himself on a television episode of Batman. In 1996 Schine and his wife died in the crash of a small plane piloted by one of their sons. As Cohn and Schine departed from the subcommittee, Robert F. Kennedy, who had resigned from the staff in 1953, returned as minority counsel. Kennedy wrote the final report on the Army-McCarthy hearings and then became chief counsel when Democrats took the majority in the next Congress. He rose to national prominence as counsel during the labor racketeering investigations, managed his brother's presidential campaign, served as attorney general, and was elected senator from New York in 1964. As a senator he served on the Government Operations Committee but not on the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. In 1968, Robert Kennedy ran for the Democratic nomination for president of the United States. On the night that he won the California primary, he was assassinated in Los Angeles' Ambassador Hotel, by coincidence one of the Schine family's chain of hotels. In July 1954, Vermont Republican Senator Ralph Flanders introduced a resolution calling for the censure of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy for conduct unbecoming a senator. The resolution was referred to a select committee chaired by Utah Republican Senator Arthur Watkins. In September, after the Senate had recessed, the Watkins committee issued a report recommending the senator's censure. Following the November congressional elections, when Democrats won narrow majorities in both the Senate and House, the Senate returned in a lame duck session to debate the Watkins report and vote on censure. Friends from both parties appealed to Senator McCarthy to avoid censure by apologizing for his conduct, but he would hear none of it. On December 2, 1954, the Senate voted 67 to 22 to condemn McCarthy's conduct for having been ``contrary to senatorial tradition.'' With his party losing the majority, McCarthy also lost the chairmanship of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. Reporters ignored his speeches and press releases and his name disappeared from the front pages. His health and spirit declined rapidly and he died in 1957 at the age of forty-eight. Senator McCarthy's most lasting legacy came in the form of judicial review of the rights of witnesses before congressional investigations. The chairman's single-minded focus on possible sedition and espionage had made him impatient over governmental efforts to treat the accused with due process. When informed that rules of the Civil Service Commission forbade the release of details of any loyalty hearing, Senator McCarthy said: ``I do not care what is in any loyalty review board memorandum. This man is ordered to produce certain information. He will produce it or his case will go to the grand jury.'' The loyalty boards, he insisted, ``are not running this committee. The senators on the committee are running it.'' Along those lines, the senator defined the constitutional right against self-incrimination as incriminating in itself. He instructed witnesses that they could claim the Fifth Amendment only if they honestly felt that answering would incriminate them. Then he took the position that anyone who claimed self- protection had admitted guilt, and demanded that they be dismissed from any government-related employment. At the time that Senator McCarthy made these assertions, the weight of judicial precedent was on his side. Dating back to the Teapot Dome investigations, the Supreme Court had ruled in McGrain v. Daughtery (1927) that a congressional committee could subpoena anyone, even those who were not government officials or employees, to testify. In Sinclair v. U.S. (1929), the Supreme Court recognized the right of Congress to investigate anything remotely related to its legislative and oversight functions. In 1940, Congress passed the Alien Registration Act (or Smith Act) that had made it illegal to advocate overthrowing the government by force or violence. In 1948 the Justice Department indicted twelve Communist leaders for having conspired to organize ``as a society, group and assembly of persons who teach and advocate the overthrow and destruction of the Government of the United States by force and violence.'' In Dennis v. U.S. (1951), the Supreme Court upheld those convictions on the grounds that the government's power to prevent an armed rebellion enabled it to subordinate free speech. During the next six years, the government indicted 126 individuals for being members of the Communist party. Congress had also passed the Mundt-Nixon Act in 1950, which barred Communist party members from employment in defense facilities, denied them passports, and required them to register with the Subversive Activities Control Board. In Rogers v. U.S. (1951) the Supreme Court ruled that a witness who admitted having been treasurer of a local Communist party could not claim privilege under the Fifth Amendment when asked to whom she had given her records. Her initial admission had waived her privilege and she was guilty of contempt for failing to answer. These rulings supported Senator McCarthy's operating assumption that those who belonged to the Communist party were committed to overthrowing the government by force and violence, and that those who claimed the Fifth Amendment must be guilty of the accusations made against them. He believed that the subcommittee gave him license to interrogate anyone regarding any possible links to communism, and that nothing could be too private or personal in nature to escape notice. The need to uncover disloyalty, in his mind, justified all means available, including the verbal abuse and intimidation of witnesses, and the firing of suspected subversives without due process. In 1957, the Supreme Court acted to restrict the government's ability to prosecute under the Smith Act and broaden the rights of congressional witnesses. On June 17, 1957, a majority led by Chief Justice Earl Warren handed down a series of sweeping decisions. In Yates v. U.S. (1957) it reversed the convictions of fourteen Communist party members under the Smith Act, finding that joining the Communist party was not tantamount to advocating the overthrow of the government by force and violence. Thereafter, the Justice Department ceased all further indictments under the Smith Act. In Watkins v. U.S. (1957), the Supreme Court bolstered the rights of witnesses by insisting that an investigating committee had to demonstrate a legislative purpose in order to justify probing affairs, that public ``education'' was insufficient reason to force witnesses to answer questions under the penalty of being held in contempt, and that the Bill of Rights applied to anyone subpoenaed by a congressional committee. Despite Senator McCarthy's repeated threats that witnesses would be imprisoned for perjury or contempt, not a single witness went to jail for testimony given to the subcommittee during his chairmanship. Several were tried for contempt, but their convictions were all overturned on appeal. It was a noticeably subdued and cooperative Joseph McCarthy who attended the organizational meeting of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations on January 24, 1955, as ranking minority member rather than chairman. In that executive session (not included in these volumes since it occurred outside of the Eighty-third Congress), the new chairman, Senator John McClellan, announced his intention to address unfinished business left pending from the previous Congress. As Senator McClellan turned to Senator McCarthy and to James Juliana, the new minority counsel, they engaged in these valedictory remarks: Senator McClellan. Let me say to you now that you two are certainly familiar with these files, and I mean the things that are unfinished and need attention. We want your wholehearted cooperation, Joe and Jim, in calling to our attention what in your judgment needs further work of this committee. I am not familiar with them. I want your wholehearted cooperation in these matters because there is no desire on my part to evade any responsibility that we have here. We are going through with it, whatever comes before us. I am not interested in any Democrat who has in the present administration or in the past administration as such, in no action that smacks of corruption or waste or inefficiency or anything else. I am prepared to defend or shield and I do not--there are a lot of things I don't know, and of course the work of the committee will find some other things as we go along. I am sure that every member of this committee will go into anything that needs our attention and any duty with which we are charged. I invite your wholehearted cooperation in this field. Beyond that now, I have nothing further. Senator McCarthy. I have already instructed Jim here to give you all the available information. He cannot do that just on the spur of the moment, but I think the chair knows that I have not tried to protect either the Eisenhower administration or the Truman administration. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the chair that politics plays no part in this. If we find a wrongdoing, I certainly will call it to your attention. Donald A.

Senator McCarthy then told reporters that he planned to pursue fraud and mismanagement in government operations in the territory of Alaska, and that he was considering going to Alaska once the weather had improved. Scheduled for March 1954, the public hearings were never held due to the subcommittee's preoccupation with matters related to Fort Monmouth. The subcommittee then referred the Alaska investigation to the Senate Banking and Currency Committee, which conducted its own hearings. A certified public accountant, Carmine Bellino (1905-1990) had served as a special agent in the Federal Bureau of Investigations from 1934 to 1945, becoming an administrative agent to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. From 1945 to 1947 he was assistant director of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and the War Assets Administration. He established a private accounting practice in 1947 but soon afterwards was called back to government service by the Truman committee and continued to assist its successor, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. He was later an investigator during the Senate's labor racketeering investigation in the 1950s, special counsel to Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, 1961- 1964, chief investigator for the Senate Watergate Committee, 1973-1974, and chief investigator for the Senate Judiciary Committee, 1978-1981.] ---------- WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 13, 1954 U.S. Senate, Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Government Operations, Washington, DC. The subcommittee met (pursuant to Senate Resolution 40, agreed to January 30, 1953) at 10:00 a.m., in room 357, Senate Office Building, Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, presiding. Present: Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, Republican, Wisconsin; Senator Everett McKinley Dirksen, Republican, Illinois. Present also: Francis P. Carr, executive director; Roy M. Cohn, chief counsel; Karl Baarslag, research director; Herbert S. Hawkins, investigator; Ruth Young Watt, chief clerk. TESTIMONY OF CARMINE BELLINO Mr. Cohn. Mr. Bellino, you are consulting accountant for the committee? Is that right? Mr. Bellino. Yes, sir. Mr. Cohn. Have you and Mr. Hawkins, an investigator for the committee, been in Alaska in the last few months? Senator Dirksen. Roy, would you mind--I wonder if it wouldn't be well, for the purpose of the record, to qualify the accountant with respect to background. Mr. Cohn. Could you tell us briefly something about your accounting experience. I believe you were with the FBI, and some other valuable experience. Mr. Bellino. I am a certified public accountant in the State of New Jersey and the District of Columbia. I had seven years of public accounting with a public accounting firm in New York City; seven years in my own business; eleven years with the FBI; five and a half as administrative assistant to Mr. Hoover; assistant director of the investigation division of the RFC and WAA; and I have been on the Hill since 1947 on various major investigations. Mr. Cohn. Now, you and Mr. Hawkins were up in Alaska. When did you arrive there? Mr. Bellino. I arrived in Juneau about November 2, 1953. Mr. Cohn. And from that time, did you conduct an investigation of various expenditures of money and situations involving the expenditure of government funds in connection with the development of Alaska? Mr. Bellino. Yes, sir. Mr. Cohn. And from that investigation, as a result of that investigation in which Mr. Hawkins participated, did you uncover evidence of waste and corruption? Mr. Bellino. Yes, sir. Mr. Cohn. Now, I wonder if you could tell us the name of the principal person involved in the transaction which you addressed yourself to? Mr. Bellino. I might explain this way, Senator. I was sent to Alaska at the initiation of the Department of Interior on the basis of suspicions of their man, Don R. Wilson, who is head of the Alaska Public Works Administration, which has under the law an authorization of $70 million. They have spent up to the present time approximately $45 million and have about $7 million more authorized and appropriated. [Off-record discussion.] Mr. Bellino. In looking into Wilson, we found that Mr. Kenneth Kadow---- Mr. Cohn. He is the man involved in this? Mr. Bellino. I will explain just how we got into him. Mr. Kadow was interested in certain housing developments in Fairbanks and Anchorage, Alaska, and he was able to get from Mr. Wilson the installation of utilities, street paving, sidewalks, water mains, etc., and we couldn't understand how a private venture could get government funds and pay only 50 percent of the actual cost. It was learned that Mr. Kadow had been chairman of a field committee---- The Chairman. I missed something. You said government funds and pay only 50 percent of the cost---- Mr. Bellino. Under the Alaska Public Works Act, the communities and public bodies that participate in public works may be charged at the discretion of Alaska Public Works Administration anywheres from 25 to 75 percent of the cost. They have established a policy of only 50 percent because the law said on an overall basis it should not be any more than 50 percent. What they have been doing is putting in utilities and have the public body pay 50 percent to the government by giving them notes at interest of about 2 percent. Kadow was sent to Alaska, according to his initial statement--and I am emphasizing this, at the request of former Secretary of the Interior, [Julius] ``Cap'' Krug. He has put that in a letter that ``Cap'' Krug sent him up there. When I started questioning him with a tape recorder he changed immediately and said it was Mr. Warne, William A. Warne. Mr. Cohn. He is now the head of the Stassen Mission in Iran? Mr. Bellino. Yes, sir. Kadow's job in Alaska was to coordinate all the activities of the Interior Department agencies. Now, there is a point that is unusual and that is that the governor's function in Alaska is to coordinate all activities, including the territorial units and agencies of the Interior Department. Senator Dirksen: Kadow, was he on the Interior payroll? Mr. Bellino. Yes, sir. Senator Dirksen. And he had the title of coordinator---- Mr. Bellino. Director of the field service. He was the only one in the office besides D'Epiro, his assistant and a secretary. Later on he had a public relations man that was on the staff of the field service. However, in addition to the governor, in the development of Alaska, they also had a board of which George Sunbourg was consultant. They had the existing function of developing Alaska. Kadow was sent up there especially to initiate various projects, one of the first being housing and I found in going through the various records and documents that we have here that he was not only interested in getting people to become interested in Alaska, but he would go so far as to take them by the hand, get cost prices, write letters, analyze financial set-ups and get financing for them. He did everything possible. In fact, at one point George Megrath, public relations man wrote a letter---- Senator Dirksen. He wrote a letter to whom? Mr. Bellino. William Dougherty, who is head of the public relations office, Interior, here in Washington. Senator Dirksen. When was that letter written? Mr. Bellino. We have a copy of that. Senator Dirksen. Identify it for the record. Mr. Bellino. This is a letter dated May 5, 1959, to William J. Dougherty. Senator Dirksen. 1959? Mr. Bellino. It is typed 1959, but it should be 1949, in which he states: Particularly, did I warn Kadow against continued traffic with a Mr. Cole with whom he had a joint housing proposition and who is a shareholder in the Newcastle Engineering Company of Newark, Delaware, a corporation having Kadow as president and Mrs. Kadow as vice-president along with Cole who is another vice-president. Incidentally, the man whom Kadow has been attempting to locate in Alaska as the Department Counsel is another officer and stockholder in the same corporation, a Mr. Mackey. As he pointed out---- Mr. Cohn. Let me see if I can ask you about a couple of points which will interest them particularly and then you can go on. One project which you told us about, that is involving the U.S. Tin Company--is that right? Mr. Bellino. Yes, sir. Mr. Cohn. Does the U.S. Tin Company operate a mine or attempt to operate a mine up in Alaska? Mr. Bellino. The U.S. Tin Corporation--I might say that tin was discovered on the property in about 1903. Senator Dirksen. Tin was discovered in 1903. Where? Mr. Bellino. At Lost River, Alaska. That is ninety miles northwest of Nome, possibly forty miles from Siberia. Senator Dirksen. And how extensive was the discovery? Mr. Bellino. The ore has been of a very poor grade. However, in 1944 the Bureau of Mines, by drilling, discovered a granite cupola where they believed that possibly there was a higher grade of ore, but the exploration was discontinued until 1950 when the Defense Material Procurement Act was passed which permitted acquiring critical material and the government advancing funds in that connection. In other words, apparently they were of the belief it was not necessary that a corporation be financially sound, but merely that here is critical material which we could use for our stockpile. Mr. Cohn. They selected this one company, the U.S. Tin Corporation, and the government has given to that a considerable amount of money? Mr. Bellino. Yes, sir. Senator Dirksen. Who is the U.S. Tin Corporation? Mr. Bellino. The U.S. Tin Corporation was organized in 1949. The principal officer is one Harry Fishnaller. The other two principal officers at that time were Fred Furey and a Robert A. F. McIntosh. They were the principal ones. Mr. Cohn. Is Kadow in that company now? Mr. Bellino. He is now president. Mr. Cohn. When did he become president? Mr. Bellino. He became president about October 2, 1951. Mr. Cohn. How long after he left the government was that? Mr. Bellino. Well, in connection with his employment, I might point out first in connection with Kadow's employment. Kadow left Interior March 15, 1951. He started to plan on leaving Interior in July 1950. We have a letter which he wrote to Cash Cole and in the letter he asked Cash Cole to talk to the Mortensen Construction Company, who was one of those interested in housing, to see whether they would be favorable to Kadow's joining up with them. The Chairman. Who is Cash Cole? Mr. Bellino. Cash Cole is the Alaskan who owned the land Kadow initially wanted to buy--either to buy from him and start a housing development or get him started in a housing development. Kadow is--actually the letters indicate he was financial advisor to Cash Cole. The Chairman. Was Kadow in a position to influence or aid U.S. Tin in getting the federal monies to start this mining project? Mr. Bellino. Here is a letter dated January 27, 1951, from Harry Fishnaller to the other officers of U.S. Tin, Bob and Henry, in which he says: Alaska representative of Secretary of Interior (Kenneth Kadow) of great help to me. He says Lorain thoroughly sold on our property and has convinced him (Kadow) of magnitude. The Chairman. Do you know how much money Kadow has drawn out of the corporation since he went in? Mr. Bellino. He was supposed not to get a salary. However, in October 1952, he arranged it so that he would get $1,500 a month. I might say that under the contract no officer is supposed to get anything until the mill and mine are in full production, which was a period of thirty days. The Chairman. Is he still getting $1,500 a month? Mr. Bellino. Yes, sir. The Chairman. And no tin is being produced? Mr. Bellino. No tin at all. In fact, this one statement-- about June 5th, a telegram was sent from the mine superintendent indicating the mill was operating on a test basis. In other words, up to that point, 1952, they had not been able to get the mill operating and suddenly they make it operate on a test basis. It is not in production; it never has been in production but Kadow told GSA that they were producing, mining and milling, and on the basis of that mining and milling they should begin to pay him $1,500 immediately. From that point on they were supposed to be mining and milling. Actually GSA went to Lost River and found they haven't mined or milled one ton of ore whatsoever through the lode operation. The Chairman. Up to now, we have sunk about how much into it? Mr. Bellino. A little over $2 million. The Chairman. And the U.S. engineer has long since recommended that the project be dropped as a hopeless project; that there was no tin there? Mr. Bellino. There have been two recommendations to drop the project on the part of GSA. However, as he wrote in one letter that we have, he points out that ``I had a nice talk today.'' This is a letter from Kadow. The Chairman. The question is: Did the engineer recommend that the project be closed up? Mr. Bellino. This is after the project was to be closed up. I want to mention who he said helped them. Had a nice talk today with the guy that has been trying to kill us off--he acts so friendly and nice that you'd never guess he actually tried to cancel our contract two months ago-- Maull and Gumbel stopped it in its tracks with Nicoll's help. Nic sure is our real friend. The Chairman. Who is Nichols? Mr. Bellino. J. S. Nichols, who is employed by the credit and finance division, and who we have evidence of private correspondence and who came to Kadow's office---- The Chairman. Was there a difference between our government engineers as to whether or not the project should continue? Mr. Bellino. There has been a difference to this extent. One group felt that what they should do was explore the mine-- let's find out whether the granite dome has got valuable ore, then consider putting money into it. Let's not put any development into it. The other group wanted both. That was the difference. Senator Dirksen. Then to summarize one phase. While Kadow was in government, he helped this corporation, the U.S. Tin Corporation get money. After he had the money transferred over to U.S. Tin, while there is a provision in the agreement of our government that no officer can get money until thirty days after tin is produced, he wrote untruthful letters to GSA, which said he was now producing tin and on the basis of that got $1,500 a month. Is that correct? Mr. Bellino. Yes, sir. Senator Dirksen. Does he have any other occupation? Mr. Bellino. That is the important thing too. I might mention when he submitted his resignation, about January 25, 1951, then he came to work--in fact, January 27, 1951, he contacted Fishnaller as to definite employment. Fishnaller agreed to take him on, while he was still in government service. He submitted his resignation as of January 27, 1951, effective March 31, 1951. The Chairman. Is he getting money besides the $1,500? Mr. Bellino. Yes, sir. In fact he was getting money---- The Chairman. How much money is he getting and from whom? Mr. Bellino. Mortensen Construction Company. Under agreement of a partnership, he gets 25 percent interest in anything done. Mortensen has interest in anything Kadow does. The Chairman. Is Mortensen doing work for the government? Mr. Bellino. Yes. The Chairman. Was it doing work for the government when he was a government official? Mr. Bellino. Yes, sir, he helped them. The Chairman. Did he have 25 percent interest at the time he was a government official, who was negotiating with them? Mr. Bellino. Senator, in that connection Mr. Kadow operated on promises for the future so there is nothing definite to show he definitely had an interest. The Chairman. Then there was an agreement, was there? You have letters to show it? Mr. Bellino. Not that particular one. Another instance gives inference that he must have had that agreement with Mortensen. The Chairman. Has he billed the government for liquor and collected money for it? Mr. Bellino. My recollection on some of the entertainment for liquor and business dinners, as he called it--in fact, Lorain, Bureau of Mines, I believe those were paid for but the letters that I recall seeing from that time on, he was not going to charge U.S. Tin anymore. The Chairman. How much did he get from the government for liquor and that sort of thing? Mr. Bellino. Roughly, the bill on which that appeared amounted to $1,600. However, the major portion of that was for travel. I'd say roughly $200. I am not certain of that. The Chairman. Did he also make claims for money with the statement that he had water available when there was no water? Mr. Bellino. Yes, sir. The Chairman. Would you give us the story on that? Senator Dirksen. There is a break here somewhere that we have to pick up. Number one, let's summarize for a moment. Tin was discovered in Alaska, low grade form, way back---- Mr. Bellino. Yes, sir. Senator Dirksen [continuing]. And somebody made the suggestion that perhaps it ought to be developed. Mr. Bellino. They had developed---- Senator Dirksen. Did the Bureau of Mines or anybody in the government make a suggestion this might be developed? Mr. Bellino. Yes, sir, the Bureau of Mines and the U.S. Geological Services both. Senator Dirksen. Number two, in 1949 three men organized a company called the U.S. Tin Corporation. Mr. Bellino. Yes, sir. Senator Dirksen. It had no corporate life before that time? Mr. Bellino. No, sir. Senator Dirksen. It was organized under the laws of what state? Mr. Bellino. The state of Washington. Senator Dirksen. Before that it was the Lost River Tin Company, which just folded up without going through liquidation. Mr. Bellino. They just didn't do anything more on that. Senator Dirksen. Now, this corporation had to have money to sink a shaft and develop tin? Mr. Bellino. Yes, sir. Senator Dirksen. Where did they get the money and how did they get it? Mr. Bellino. When they began to operate it was merely a placer operation. They didn't need much money. There was water available to run it down the creek and then put it through the mill and get it in concentrated form and ship it out. Senator Dirksen. So out of their own capital structure they probably raised that money? Mr. Bellino. Yes, sir. Senator Dirksen. Did they come to the government for money? Mr. Bellino. They came to the government for money in the latter part of 1950. Senator Dirksen. To what agencies? Mr. Bellino. They had to get the approval of the Department of Interior on the basis of it being a critical item but the money was---- Senator Dirksen. Did the Department of Interior approve it? Mr. Bellino. Yes, sir. Senator Dirksen. I presume it was in the form of an application under the old Exploration Act for funds with which to go ahead with exploration. How much did they ask for? Mr. Bellino. Initially over $300,000. Senator Dirksen. U.S. Tin Corporation asked for $300,000. To whom was that application directed? Mr. Bellino. I might mention in connection with the application, Senator, in one of his letters, Harry Fishnaller's letter to Bob and Henry, he stated: Am enclosing an application blank. Don't think we can answer all requirements as to statements, etc. Consult with Henry Schaefer and Fred Loomis as to how we might answer or side-step where we need to. Henry Schaefer was connected with the Seattle Trust and Savings Bank at that time. I want to get to the point where he said what should be left out of the application to get their thinking. Senator Dirksen. That can come later. They filed an application to a federal agency for $300,000. Mr. Bellino. Yes, sir. Senator Dirksen. Do you know who signed the application? Mr. Bellino. I believe it was Mr. Walsh from the Emergency Procurement Service. Senator Dirksen. No, it would have had to be somebody in the Tin Corporation. Mr. Bellino. From the U.S. Tin Corporation, Harry Fishnaller. Senator Dirksen. This went to the Department of Interior? Mr. Bellino. It went to the GSA, which was Jess Larson's outfit. Senator Dirksen. You said the Department of Interior had to first approve it. Mr. Bellino. They had to approve it. The project itself was one coming under the Defense Procurement Act, you see. It involved no money as far as the Department of Interior was concerned. Senator Dirksen. They did approve it under the Exploration Act; then the application had to go where? Mr. Bellino. The application went to GSA, which is now GSA, it was then the Emergency Procurement Service. Senator Dirksen. When was the application filed? Mr. Bellino. It was filed in the early part of February 1951. Senator Dirksen. February 1951! Was Mr. Kadow still in the government service? Mr. Bellino. Yes. In fact, we have a telegram to Harry Fishnaller at government expense asking him to send the application blank to him here in Washington and second to advise him whether he could be at a meeting of the Geological Services in Washington. Senator Dirksen. This was 1951 or before? Mr. Bellino. 1951. Senator Dirksen. Now, when the application got to GSA, what happened to it? Mr. Bellino. When it got to GSA, it was reviewed and eventually recommended on the basis of a 25 ton mill per day project. In other words, there was a considerable difference of opinion whether the government should put a lot of money in this project so they agreed to permit them to go ahead on a test basis. ``Let's see if it is feasible to operate up there.'' The climatic weather conditions were terrific, the shipping and everything else. They felt it would not be feasible to put it in full production. They permitted them to start on a 25 ton basis. However, Mr. Lorain of the Bureau of Mines in Juneau was against the 25 ton mill. The money they were permitted to have would only be sufficient to operate that type of mill. He was against the 25 ton mill. Mr. Kadow got his instructions, but he said, ``Let's disregard the 25 tons; we are going to build up to 100 tons on the basis of what we have got.'' We have a letter where Mr. Lorain doubted the feasibility of that very much. As a result of proceeding on a 100 ton basis, they got money for 25 tons, and naturally they had to ask for more money later on. That is what happened. When GSA finally approved the application for 25 tons test--they approved it about March 23, 1951---- Senator Dirksen. When was the money disbursed? Mr. Bellino. The first money was a guarantee by GSA to the bank, Seattle Trust Company. The bank was willing to stand 10 percent of this loss while the government would stand 90 percent. The bank, however, was willing to do that provided the company got in production and produced by a certain time. When the time came and the company failed to go into operation, the bank said, ``We will not give them any more money.'' At that time $157,000 out of $300,000 some odd guaranteed had been spent, so they came back to Washington and they got GSA---- Senator Dirksen. Wait. How long after this was approved, namely in February or March 1951 was it before the bank indicated they could get no more money under this guarantee? Mr. Bellino. About August 1951. Senator Dirksen. They had roughly six or seven months to operate? Mr. Bellino. Actually, their operation would not have begun until July. If it was a mine which had been able to operate and able to deliver what they said they could deliver, they should have begun to operate by the first of July. Senator Dirksen. By August there was no actual production? Mr. Bellino. No, sir. Never has been. The Seattle Bank said they would disburse no more money. GSA, however, got them to agree to loan $10,000 more but this time GSA was responsible for 95 percent so the bank's loss, on the outside, would be 5 percent. At 6 percent interest, the bank was doing pretty good. Senator Dirksen. Was that money all spent--approximately $250,000 or $300,000? Mr. Bellino. $257,000, I think, was gotten and spent. Senator Dirksen. With that additional money, how long did they run? Mr. Bellino. They have been trying to run ever since 1951. They came back into Washington in the latter part of November 1951 for a $35,000 advance. In fact, on one of the letters he says: I had a new idea. Sell GSA on this. Instead of having the bank give them money to pay interest, the government was paying the interest, the corporation never did pay interest, they said: Let's have GSA advance the money to use monthly as we need it and pay GSA interest unless they indicate we don't have to pay interest. It was finally agreed that they pay 4 percent interest. They never did pay the interest. Senator Dirksen. With this $35,000 was any tin produced? Mr. Bellino. There was never any tin produced. Senator Dirksen. Now, they came back for more money? Mr. Bellino. Yes, sir. Senator Dirksen. How much? Mr. Bellino. I believe the next amount was two hundred and some thousand. Senator Dirksen. What happened to that application? Mr. Bellino. That was the time about February 1952 when Mr. Bourret recommended that they stop giving any more funds to the development. Senator Dirksen. Who is Mr. Bourret? Mr. Bellino. He is with the GSA, one of the mining engineers. Senator Dirksen. Did they get the money or didn't they? Mr. Bellino. They got the money. Senator Dirksen. Notwithstanding his objection? Mr. Bellino. Yes, sir. Senator Dirksen. Was the money spent? Mr. Bellino. Yes, sir. Senator Dirksen. How long did they take to spend that money? Mr. Bellino. It didn't take them long because they were back in July for about $900,000 more. Senator Dirksen. Now, by fall 1952, they had spent $2 million? Mr. Bellino. I wouldn't say--they were getting close to it. Senator Dirksen. How much tin was produced between November 1951 to November 1952? Mr. Bellino. Never tin--placer tin on placer ground producing tin of a very poor grade. Senator Dirksen. How much? Mr. Bellino. They have gotten on an average about forty tons. Senator Dirksen. Altogether forty tons? Mr. Bellino. A year--not out of this project however. In that area. U.S. Tin operated that also. Senator Dirksen. Out of these funds? Mr. Bellino. Yes, sir. Senator Dirksen. They got forty tons of tin? Mr. Bellino. Concentrate. They ran out of the next $200,000 and came back for $900,000. Senator Dirksen. When did they come back? Mr. Bellino. They came back for the $900,000 sometime in the latter part of 1952. Senator Dirksen. What happened to that application? Mr. Bellino. That was also approved. Senator Dirksen. So they got another $900,000. How long did that run, if you know or roughly? Mr. Bellino. Well, they were back in--well, that would be for 1953. Senator Dirksen. Up to the present time they have spent around two million dollars altogether? Mr. Bellino. That is including the money they are spending at the present time. Senator Dirksen. Now, what is the value of the ore concentrate--you say they got forty tons? Mr. Bellino. Approximately forty tons a year. I don't have the actual value in dollars. Senator Dirksen. Have you any notion as to what ore concentrate is worth in tons? Mr. Bellino. Of course, the concentrate has to be put into tin and the tin price now is at least $1.05 a pound. There never has been more than enough to do any more than pay off part of the bank loan. That is the most they have ever been able to do. Senator Dirksen. Let's find out what the market is for ore concentrate. We have the actual amount of the sales? Mr. Bellino. Yes, sir. Senator Dirksen. Now, I have got one other question. This is with reference to Mr. Kadow. He filed his resignation in January 1951, effective March 31, 1951. Did he actually go off the rolls in March 1951? Mr. Bellino. Subsequent to that resignation letter, he sent a telegram about March 13th requesting that his resignation be effective March 15th. Then he entered into an agreement with Mortensen and U.S. Tin on March 16th. Senator Dirksen. When did he become president of U.S. Tin? Mr. Bellino. He was general manager on March 16, 1951. He became president about the latter part of September or October 2, 1951. Senator Dirksen. Now then, after he became general manager on March 16th, 1951, the company actually then got the $200,000 you referred to in 1952? Mr. Bellino. Yes, sir. Senator Dirksen. So your recollection would indicate that U.S. Tin got $1,100,000 within a short period of time after Mr. Kadow's resignation from the government service became effective. Mr. Bellino. Senator, altogether he got $2,900,000. Senator Dirksen. I am speaking about these two items? Mr. Bellino. Yes, sir. [Off-record discussion.] Senator Dirksen. Did he have a written contract with U.S. Tin when general manager? Mr. Bellino. I think initially it was oral and eventually he entered into a written contract. What I want to explain in connection with U.S. Tin was that what I did there is take everything I could. I did not look at the records or audit the record. The GSA auditor was going to do that and we haven't gotten his report as yet. The Chairman. Do you know when he went with U.S. Tin on the sixteenth of March if he had a contract either oral or written, and if so, how much he was to get? Mr. Bellino. How much stock he was to get? The Chairman. What was he getting from U.S. Tin the day after he left the government? Mr. Bellino. The records indicate that the corporation gave him gratis 8,500 shares of stock in this corporation. The Chairman. How many shares were outstanding? Mr. Bellino. Three hundred thousand authorization. There was outstanding, I believe, somewheres around 180,000; balance was all optioned. The Chairman. So he got about 10 percent of the outstanding stock? Mr. Bellino. Yes, sir. The Chairman. And do you know what that stock was worth, if anything? Mr. Bellino. The stock had book value of $1.00 a share. The stock had a par value of $1.00 a share. The book value was minus zero. However, they were selling the stock not less than--from $3.00 a share to as much as $6.00 a share. The market value was between $3.00 and $6.00 a share. The Chairman. Were they actually selling stock at that time at that figure? Mr. Bellino. At that date I do not know. Subsequent to getting the money from the government they began to sell stock to other individuals from $3.00 to $6.00 a share. Mr. Cohn. Did Kadow sell his? Mr. Bellino. Kadow, according to tax returns, sold some of his. Mr. Cohn. How? Mr. Bellino. Not less than $3.00 a share. Mr. Cohn. And he paid zero? Mr. Bellino. Yes, sir. Mr. Cohn. What was his consideration? Mr. Bellino. Actually, it had been his help to the corporation. Mr. Cohn. Mr. Bellino, Senator Dirksen very correctly points out here, I think the pattern is very clear. Senator Dirksen makes this point: What, very specifically, did Kadow have to do with giving of any monies or any other benefits to this company prior to his leaving this government? Mr. Bellino. He definitely contacted officials in both Interior and GSA and helped them get the loans. The Chairman. You have told us that. Was that his job? Mr. Bellino. No, sir. He says this. He says, ``I was up there to develop Alaska.'' Everything he did was for the purpose of---- The Chairman. I am trying to find out whether in his official capacity he was supposed to contact people or not. It makes a big difference. Was part of his job to advise that money be given to deserving developing companies? If not, what was his job? He was on the government payroll. He had a job. Do you follow me on this, Carmine? Mr. Bellino. Yes, sir. The Chairman. Let's say I went to Alaska, while Kadow was holding his government job and if I had some vision of developing a certain project and I needed federal funds, was Kadow part of the chain of command through which I would go to get those funds. Was he the man who would recommend for or against it. Mr. Bellino. Senator, Kadow injected himself into everything that he desired. I might say on that, he would go to extremes making sure they got the funds--whether it was government, Stettinius or any fund. The Chairman. What I want to know--if that was his job. If not---- Mr. Bellino. His job isn't spelled out at all--just development of Alaska. Anything he could do to develop Alaska was his job. The Chairman. Then if the government sent him up there to develop Alaska, he is the man who would be depended upon, relied upon for recommendations for loans. Mr. Bellino. It would appear from the Alaska field service that he was in an advisory capacity. However, he went much further than that. The Chairman. He advised the government to give loans to worthy projects? Mr. Bellino. No, I wouldn't say that. The Chairman. Who would he advise? Mr. Bellino. His staff was made up of heads of various government agencies, Bureau of Mines, Geological Survey---- Mr. Cohn. The fact is that one of his jobs was to recommend to his superiors what would be good and what bad; which ones they should finance and which ones they shouldn't. Is that correct? Mr. Bellino. Yes, sir. Mr. Cohn. Here is a man who was in Alaska when U.S. Tin wanted money. One of his tasks was to advise his superiors whether or not they should get the money. He did that, didn't he? Mr. Bellino. Yes. Mr. Cohn. In fact, on February 27, 1951, he was down here with Harry Fishnaller seeing Mr. Ellis in the Bureau of Mines about money for the corporation. Mr. Cohn. Do you have any statements that he advised his superiors, made recommendations on contracts? Mr. Bellino. No. Mr. Cohn. You don't? Mr. Bellino. No, unless--no, nothing. That was not part of his official duty, Senator. He took that all upon himself and his own interpretation. The Chairman. How do you know? Mr. Bellino. I will say that this way. When he started out, started doing that, rumors came down about his activities, so Warne wrote him a letter calling his attention to being like Caesar's wife, vulnerable, above suspicion. The Chairman. Above suspicion of what? Mr. Bellino. In developing Alaska, of having any personal interest in any way or seeking to have any personal interest. The Chairman. I didn't ask about that. I didn't ask about personal interest. Listen to me a minute. I am not talking about personal interest. I am trying to find out whether there is a conflict here, taking over a company which he had promoted and fostered while a government agent--whether or not he did that. In order to find that out, I must find out from you or someone else whether he did perform the function of advising his superiors, advising GSA, advising Interior, the Bureau of Mines or anyone else, when they should or should not give a company some aid. It had nothing to do with personal interest. Mr. Bellino. Senator, this is his job description. I could read that. The Chairman. I can read it. Let's read it into the record. This is the job description for Kadow dated July 8, 1948: Under the general direction of the Secretary of the Interior to serve as Director of the Alaska Field Staff, Chairman of the Alaska Field Committee, and ex officio Commissioner for Alaska for the Department. To be responsible for integrating the activities in Alaska of the bureaus and offices of the Department and for increasing the effectiveness of the Alaskan program of the Department. Will report to the Secretary through the Director of the Division of Territories and Island Possessions. To serve as the representative of the Department and of the Secretary in Alaska in dealing with other Federal agencies, the Territorial government, and other public or private groups or persons on matters of common interest.

When did he have the agreement with U.S. Tin, if you know, to get the stock or anything else? Mr. Bellino. About the stock, that just appeared in the minutes. I don't know when he made the agreement. The Chairman. When did it appear in the minutes? Mr. Bellino. I do not recall. However, about January 27, 1951, he has admitted speaking to Fishnaller about the job. He says it wasn't until after he told Fishnaller he would work for the company that he began to help the Tin Company. The Chairman. How much salary was he supposed to get as general manager? Mr. Bellino. I haven't seen any salary, Senator. The Chairman. Did you ask him? Mr. Bellino. No, sir. The Chairman. That is an important thing, isn't it. Mr. Bellino. Certainly, yes, sir. The Chairman. That should be in the record. Mr. Bellino. From what I could see, he hasn't received any salary. The agreement was that he would not receive a salary while with the government. The Chairman. What type of deferred salary did he receive? If I go to work for your corporation, I don't go to work for nothing, even under an agreement with the mortgagee. If I don't get money as of today, certainly I am going to pile up salary. Mr. Bellino. He said he wasn't interested in such, that he was interested in capital gains and for that reason felt eighty-five hundred shares of stock was his salary. The Chairman. Did you ask him? Mr. Bellino. I went there by what the records showed in connection with his signing the contract--his agreement to sign the contract gave him eighty-five hundred shares. The Chairman. Do you have documents, letters or anything else to show the date that he became interested in becoming part of this company? Mr. Bellino. The first document that I found of this corporation, which was called to his attention, was about October 2nd. In October, I am not sure of the date, 1950, at which time a copy of a letter written by Mr. Lorain was sent to Mr. Kadow. The Chairman. Setting out what? Mr. Bellino. It showed this corporation was anxious to get money and begin doing business. The Chairman. Have you identified Mr. Lorain? Mr. Bellino. Mr. Lorain was director of Bureau of Mines in Juneau. I might explain to the senator, actually we jumped to the tin mine and you can't follow Kadow's activities. If we were to follow his prior activities we could understand his thinking,when he was ready to leave the government and go to work for Mortensen and U.S. Tin. For instance, in 1947, October 21, 1948, which was about three months after he arrived in Alaska--he went there, got there about July 15, 1948, Mr. Warne wrote a handwritten memo for the files pointing out: Director Jam"
