The average age at diagnosis was 59.3 years for women within and 60.7 years outside the MSP (see Table ). Geographically, more BC cases are within the MSP in the canton of St. Gallen, compared to the more rural canton of Grisons (p < 0.05).\n\nTable 1\n\nAll observationsWithin MSPOutside MSPTest for differences within versus outside MSPNMean (SD)/Proportion %NMean (SD)/Proportion %NMean (SD)/Proportion %p-valueAge255860.1 (6.0)105759.3 (6.2)150160.7 (5.9)p < 0.05Birthplacep = 0.30 Outside Switzerland66926.2%26525.1%40426.9% In Switzerland188973.8%79274.9%109773.1%Cantonp < 0.05 Grisons72628.4%25824.4%46831.2% St. Gallen183271.6%79975.6%103368.8%Stage distributionp < 0.05In-Situ31612.4%18517.5%1318.7% I98738.6%49146.5%49633.0% II82132.1%29027.4%53135.4% III2319.0%666.2%16511.0% IV2037.9%252.4%17811.9%Mean tumor size (in mm)239022.7 (18.9)101219.3 (16.4)137825.3 (20.3)p < 0.05Tumor Size < 2 cm130754.7%65965.1%64847.0%p < 0.05Tumor Size < 5 cm220892.4%96295.1%124690.4%p < 0.05Lymph nodes involvementp < 0.05 Positive (N1+)90735.7%27526.1%63242.4% Negative (N0)163764.3%77873.9%85957.6%Hormone receptorp = 0.21 Positive214690.8%87291.7%127490.2% Negative2189.2%798.3%1399.8%Estrogen receptorsp = 0.19 Positive213590.5%86891.5%126789.9% Negative2249.5%818.5%14310.1%Progesterone receptorsp < 0.05 Positive177476.5%74078.6%103475.0% Negative54623.5%20121.4%34525.0%Ki-67 proliferation indexp < 0.05 High (i.e. ≥ 25%)82538.7%29334.4%53241.5% Low (i.e. < 25%)130761.3%55865.6%74958.5%Gradingp < 0.05 Grade I36716.7%20023.0%16712.6% Grade II117053.3%46453.3%70653.2% Grade III66030.0%20623.7%45434.2%HER2 over expressionp = 0.58 Positive34115.5%12814.9%21315.8% Negative186384.5%72985.1%113484.2%\n\nWhile ~ 40% of BC cases in our sample were detected within the MSP, the share of detection varied considerably across the years, from 7% in the inauguration year of the program (2010) to 45–53% in the last two rounds from 2015 to 2019 (see Fig. ). Tumor stage distribution of women within the MSP was significantly different from women outside the MSP (p < 0.05). Figure displays the corresponding distributions and shows that BC within the MSP were diagnosed at earlier stages with fewer locally advanced and metastatic characteristics. In particular, within the MSP 17.5% of BC were in the in-situ stage (vs. 8.7% outside the MSP) and further 46.5% were detected in stage I (vs. 33.0%). Finally, only 6.2 and 2.4% of BC cases within the MSP had stages III and IV (vs. 11.0 and 11.9%). Moreover, lymph node involvement (26.1 vs. 42.4%) and tumor sizes (19.3 vs. 25.3 mm) were significantly different. Other significant differences between the two groups could be found for positivity of progesterone receptors (78.6% vs. 75.0%), Ki-67 (34.4% vs. 41.5%) and the distribution of the histologic grading—with a more favorable grading for BC within compared to outside the MSP.\n\nComparative treatment and survival analyses\n\nAs can be seen in Table , treatments of women with invasive BC (stages I–IV) within the MSP were less aggressive and less burdensome than for women outside the MSP, which is reflected by half the rate of radical mastectomies (8.8% vs. 18.4%; p < 0.05) and a significantly lower proportion of patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy (33.7% vs. 44.1%; p < 0.05). Treatment was significantly more often performed within certified breast centers for women within the MSP. Noteworthy, the share of treated women in certified breast centers has changed over time. For instance, the first breast centers were certified in 2012 and the overall fraction of patients treated in breast centers has increased from 2% in 2012 to 74% in 2019.\n\nTable 2\n\nAll observationsWithin MSPOutside MSPTest for differences within versus outside MSPNProportion in %NProportion in %NProportion in %p-valueCertified Breast Centers52623.5%27431.4%25218.4%p < 0.05Radical Mastectomy32914.7%778.8%25218.4%p < 0.05Adjuvant Chemotherapy89840.1%29433.7%60444.1%p < 0.05Recurrence or metastasis in the follow-up period27212.1%586.7%21415.6%p < 0.05Overall survival 5-year158589.6%64296.7%94385.1%p < 0.05 10-year55878.9%15891.4%40072.1%p < 0.05Stage I 5-year74397.0%37098.7%37395.4%p < 0.05 10-year26190.6%9496.3%16885.8%p < 0.05Stage II 5-year62294.6%22198.6%40292.5%p < 0.05 10-year22383.6%5590.7%16980.4%Not significantStage III 5-year16286.5%4491.3%12084.7%Not significant 10-year5968.8%976.6%5166.3%Not significantStage IV 5-year6036.3%1049.1%5134.5%Not significant 10-year1718.1%336.4%1516.2%Not significant\n\nFurthermore, Table shows that the survival rates were significantly higher for women within the MSP. The difference in the survival rates increased over time, where 1-year survival rates differed by 2.9 percentage points (pp) (99.7% vs. 96.8%), the 5-year survival rate already differed by 11.6pp (96.7% vs. 85.1%) and the 10-year survival rate by 19.3pp (91.4% vs. 72.1%). Similar differences were also observed for the subgroups of tumor stage I and II. Other stages have a fairly low number of cases but show similar, albeit insignificant patterns.\n\nKaplan–Meier curves\n\nFigure depicts the survival probabilities over time. While the difference in survival increases over time, the differences are at almost all points in time significant. The overall Kaplan–Meier HR of within versus outside the MSP is 0.271 for all BC cases (Table ). These significant better outcomes for women within the MSP persist, albeit at a lower magnitude, for the subgroups of stage I and II, that account for 71% of diagnosed BC cases. Moreover, Fig. b shows the lead-time corrected Kaplan–Meier curve for all tumor groups. The lead-time correction lowered the survival curve for women within the MSP, but survival was still significantly better for women within the MSP (84.7% survival rate after 10 years). Confidence intervals become large over time as sample size within MSP shrinks due to the lead-time correction.\n\nTable 3\n\nHazard ratiosModels(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)Screening program0.271*** (0.197, 0.369)0.377*** (0.277, 0.512)0.394*** (0.290, 0.536)0.550*** (0.389, 0.778)0.691** (0.486, 0.983)0.674** (0.471, 0.965)Age1.041*** (1.022, 1.060)1.052*** (1.030, 1.074)1.048*** (1.026, 1.071)1.048*** (1.026, 1.072)Ki-67 proliferation index1.016*** (1.010, 1.024)1.015*** (1.009, 1.021)1.018*** (1.011, 1.024)Tumor size1.016*** (1.011, 1.021)0.998 (0.991, 1.004)0.996 (0.989, 1.021)HER21.911*** (1.315, 2.777)UICC TMN tumor stage (stage I) II1.492** (1.058, 2.105)1.495** (1.059, 2.110) III3.264*** (2.128, 5.007)3.498*** (2.276, 5.376) IV15.500*** (10.502, 22.874)16.965*** (11.407, 25.230)Certified breast centers1.391 (0.994, 1.936)Control factors Lead-time correctedxxxxx Incidence-period correctedxxxxxxModel statistics No. of observations224222422242199819981972 Proportional-hazards assumption holdsYesYesYesYesYesYes Prob > Chi20.0000.0000.0000.0000.0000.000\n\nFurthermore, Fig. shows, that the within MSP survival curve of BC specific survival is higher than for overall survival. For instance, 10-year BC survival lies at 96.5% for women within the MSP vs. at 92.5% for overall survival (82.5% vs. 74.0% for BC outside MSP). The Kaplan–Meier HR of BC related mortality of within MSP vs. outside MSP is 0.231 (see Table ). This pattern is also true for the lead-time corrected Kaplan–Meier curve—which shows a survival rate at year 10 of 89.5%.\n\nCox proportional hazards regressions\n\nTable displays HR for overall mortality from six specifications of the Cox proportional hazards regression model, from a simple specification (1&2) only including whether the woman participated in the MSP or not, to controlling for different variables (3–6). Specifications (2–6) show results for lead-time corrected survival times. Specification (1) shows that women within the MSP had a 72.9% lower hazard of mortality (HR: 0.271; p < 0.01). When only looking at BC-related mortality, the HR was 0.231 (p < 0.01) (see Table ). The lead-time adjusted results (2) show a change of the HR to 0.377 (p < 0.01). The HR of the program remained similar when accounted for age (3). When controlled for tumor size and Ki-67 (4), control variables for length bias, the HR increases to 0.550 (p < 0.01) with significant negative effects of Ki-67 and tumor size on survival. The similar specification for BC-related survival showed an HR of 0.469 (p < 0.01).\n\nTable 4\n\nHazard ratiosModels(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)Screening program0.231*** (0.154, 0.346)0.313*** (0.212, 0.463)0.318*** (0.215, 0.470)0.469*** (0.294, 0.749)0.688 (0.428, 1.108)0.700 (0.433, 1.134)Age1.013 (0.991, 1.035)1.016 (0.900, 1.044)1.006 (0.978, 1.034)1.007 (0.979, 1.035)Ki-67 proliferation index1.023*** (1.016, 1.031)1.023*** (1.014, 1.031)1.026*** (1.018, 1.035)Tumor size1.021*** (1.015, 1.026)0.998 (0.991, 1.006)0.996 (0.989, 1.003)HER22.338*** (1.453, 3.763)UICC TMN tumor stage (stage I) II3.513*** (1.844, 6.690)3.587*** (1.883, 6.836) III10.698*** (5.353, 21.379)11.752*** (5.868, 23.537) IV60.610*** (31.589, 116.293)69.953*** (36.149, 135.369)Certified breast centers1.440 (0.859, 2.415)Control factors Lead-time correctedaxxxxx Incidence-period correctedbxxxxxxModel statistics No. of observations224222422242199819981972 Proportional-hazards assumption holdsYesYesYesYesYesYes Prob > Chi20.0000.0000.0000.0000.0000.000\n\nThe effect of the MSP decreased when additionally accounted for tumor stages (HR: 0.691; p < 0.05). The higher the tumor stage, the higher was the hazard of mortality. Women diagnosed with stage IV had a ~ 16-times higher hazard of mortality than women with stage I carcinomas. When further controlled for HER2 and treatment in certified breast centers (6), the effect of the MSP changed slightly (HR: 0.699; p < 0.05), where HER2 had a significant effect on survival (HR: 1.880; p < 0.01), and certified breast center had no significant effect on the HR. HRs for BC-related mortality are shown in Table , and show insignificant HRs for the MSP as soon as tumor stages are included in the model.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe results demonstrate a statistically more favorable tumor stage distribution within compared to outside the MSP. Tumor stage is predictive for survival and women with lower stages had less aggressive treatment options available. We found, furthermore, that the proportion of Ki-67 levels is significantly higher for BC diagnosed outside the MSP. High Ki-67 levels are associated with higher grading, larger tumor size [19] and correlate to late endocrine resistance [20]. Consequently, we found that the number of mastectomies for cases within the MSP was about half compared to outside the MSP (8.9% vs. 17.7%). These results are in line with Hermann et al. [21] in a partially overlapping population covering a different time period. Less invasive and aggressive treatments directly translate into an improved quality of life for patients, as reported by Jay et al. [22] who showed better patient reported outcomes with respect to breast, psychosocial and sexual well-being of breast conserving therapy compared to mastectomy. Moreover, less lymph node infiltrations lead to fewer axillary dissections, potentially preventing possible burdensome side effects, such as lymphedema.\n\nMost importantly, we found a significant survival difference for women within the MSP compared to women outside the MSP, starting in the first year after diagnosis with a continuously widening survival difference in absolute terms. At ten years after diagnosis the uncorrected survival difference amounted to 18.2pp (92.2% vs. 74.0%). However, estimations for survival effects of MSPs in observational studies are prone to lead-time bias [23]. Lead-time bias happens when screening increases the perceived survival time without affecting the course of the disease [24]. When correcting the survival of women with screen-detected BC for lead-time [13] the positive effect of MSPs on survival was still highly significant (HR: 0.377; p < 0.01). HR of the MSP, uncorrected and corrected for lead-time were in line with other studies [13, 25]. For instance, Schumann et al. [25] found an unadjusted HR of a German MSP of 0.23, and when adjusted for lead-time bias via several methods HRs between 0.32 and 0.39. Duffy et al. [13] estimated lead-time corrected HR for a Swedish MSP of 0.40. Nevertheless, other studies such as Munck et al. [14] reported lower effects of MSPs (HR: 0.76) in the Netherlands on disease-free survival when corrected for lead-time bias. This difference might be explained by a shorter follow-up time, investigating disease-free survival instead of overall survival, and by different patient characteristics in their sample (e.g., tumor stage distribution).\n\nFurthermore, a different age distribution between the groups could affect overall survival, due to non-BC related mortality. Accounting for age only marginally affected survival. Further, differences in other characteristics such as Ki-67 and tumor size—potential determinants for a length bias (screening detects disproportionately more slowly growing tumors) [26]—could lead to an overestimation of the effectiveness of MSPs. However, lead-time corrected HR controlled for age, Ki-67 and tumor size still showed significantly positive effects of the MSP (HR: 0.550; p < 0.01).\n\nThis sustained difference in survival can have multiple reasons. Firstly, we observed different tumor characteristics of women depending on MSP participation. For instance, a more favorable tumor stage distribution is a well-recognized prognostic factor [27] and an acknowledged advantage of screening [28], and might explain the survival differences. While we showed that the detection of BC at an earlier stage had a significant effect on survival, it only partially explained the observed effects. Significant overall survival differences lowered but persisted when women of the same tumor stages were compared (e.g., for stage 1 at 10 years: 96.3% vs. 85.8%; p < 0.05), and when HR were controlled for tumor stage distribution (HR: 0.691; p < 0.05).\n\nSecondly, outcome differences might occur if groups are treated in different medical settings. We found that women within the MSP were more often treated in certified breast centers, where treatment was different with less mastectomies and fewer chemotherapy. These differences are supported by evidence from other studies. For example, a Dutch study found that non-screeners more often stopped taking adjuvant antihormonal treatments [29]. Moreover, if a suspicious finding appears in a screening mammography, the warranted sequence of further examinations, biopsy, and interdisciplinary tumor boards is still part of the organized MSP. Most of the time surgery and adjuvant treatment are given in one of the certified breast centers according to strict quality-controlled guidelines. The fact that women, whose BC was diagnosed outside the program, were more often treated outside of a certified breast center, could contribute to the different treatment outcomes and is a possible explanation for the finding that survival differences persisted in favor of the MSP even if corrected for stage distribution. Surprisingly, we did not find significant effects from treatments in certified breast centers for our sample. This result needs to be taken with care as certification only started in 2010 in Switzerland and their share varied considerably from 2010 to 2019. Furthermore, lower shares of detected BC cases within the program in earlier years (see Fig. ) coupled with treatment advancements over time potentially bias our results. Therefore, we included an incidence year dummy in our regressions to account for period effects.\n\nLastly, as this was an observational study, there might have been unobserved differences in the characteristics of women participating in MSPs compared to those not participating. For instance, the screened population might differ in socioeconomic status (SES) and simultaneously in health-related factors as shown in several studies [30, 31], which can affect survival. A study from the Netherlands [30] showed that women of low SES were less likely to participate in MSPs than women with high SES (odds ratio of 1.8), and further had less favorable tumor stages—and thus were more likely to die from BC. Similar studies from Switzerland demonstrated significant differences of the tumor stage distribution of BC diagnosed in patients of lower compared to higher SES [32] as well as higher screening uptake of women with higher SES [33, 34]. While we controlled for tumor stage distribution in our analyses, other unobserved differences in survival relevant factors between the groups might have affected the differences in survival, and would, if systematic, lead to an overestimation of the survival effect from participating in MSPs.\n\nComparing our results to other studies shows that various incidence based mortality studies could find a 26% reduction of deaths of BC comparing to historical controls or areas without screening [11]. A more current survey of European screening programs showed a wide variation but significant reductions of BC mortality when comparing screened to non-screened women [12]. Duffy et al. [35] found that in the population of women regularly undergoing mammography screening the proportion of BC fatal after 10 years was reduced by 50%, somewhat less so in intermittent participants (− 36%). For women participating at five consecutive screening rounds the risk of dying from BC was reduced by 74%, and after statistical adjustments for self-selection to 66% (HR: 0.34) [36]. These HR are in the range of our findings.\n\nLimitations\n\nOur study comes with limitations. Firstly, the overall mortality rate of age-standardized BC has significantly shrunk over the last 30 years not only internationally, but also in our local data from 34.3 to 18.7 per 100,000/year, whereas the age-standardized incidence has increased from 87.0 to 103.5 cases per 100,000/year [37]. Improvements in treatment had an important and beneficial effect on BC mortality and might be more relevant for decreasing overall mortality than screening [38]. In our study we do not compare with historical controls before the introduction of screening. Using incidence-based mortality data of the two groups diagnosed and treated at the same time in the same area eliminates a bias caused by considerably better treatment regimens over time. We controlled for period effects by including the year of the incidence as dummy variable to account for improvements in treatment over time. Secondly, the correction of lead-time bias can only approximate the effect of sojourn time and is based on a multi-state Markov model [13]. Abrahamsson et al. [39] in their simulation based on a tumor growth model showed that lead times can be shorter when conditional to tumor characteristics. This could potentially result in an underestimation of lead-time corrected survival effects from MSPs. Thirdly, adjustment of length bias is usually based on many assumptions [39]. By estimating models controlling for Ki-67 and tumor size, potential indicators for length bias, we showed that survival differences persisted. At the same time, differences in tumor size and Ki-67 are also direct advantages of MSPs—and controlled results do not fully reflect length bias. Lastly, bias might arise due to an overdiagnosis of tumors within the MSP [40]. By estimating our models excluding in-situ carcinoma we partially address the overdiagnosis bias [41]. Lastly, a certain share of BC cases outside the MSP are detected via opportunistic screening (see Fig. ), which might affect the survival likelihood of the outside MSP cases positively. As we want to evaluate the effectiveness of an organized MSP, the “donna” program, compared to any outside detected BC, the key takeaways from our study are unaffected."
