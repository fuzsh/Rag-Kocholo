        "text": "Spiro Agnew was a Greek-American politician from Baltimore, Maryland. He served as the Governor of Maryland from 1967 to 1969. He became a national celebrity for his \"law and order\" rhetoric in response to nationwide civil unrest. He was chosen by Richard Nixon as his running mate for the presidential election of 1968. Agnew served as the 39th Vice President of the United States from 1969 to 1973, easily winning re-election in 1972. He was forced to resign after a criminal investigation in Maryland uncovered evidence of Agnew's involvement in criminal conspiracy, bribery, extortion and tax fraud. Agnew eventually pleaded no contest to a single felony charge of tax evasion, and the other charges were dropped. He spend the rest of his life in retirement. A number of historians have cited Agnew as one of the founders of the \"New Right\" movement, which went on to dominate the Republican Party in the 1980s.\n\nIn 1918, Agnew was born in Baltimore. His father was restaurant owner Theodore Agnew (born Theophrastos Anagnostopoulos ). Theodore was from the small town of Gargalianoi in Messenia, Greece, located about 18 km (11 mi) north of the historic town of Pylos. His family were olive growers , but were impoverished during a financial crisis in the 1890s. Theodore emigrated to the United States in 1897., and had managed to open his own restaurant by 1908. Agnew's mother was Margaret Marian Akers, a retired government worker from Virginia. She was the widow of a close friend of Theodore who had died in 1917. She had a young child from her previous marriage.\n\nDuring the 1920s, the Agnew family was relatively affluent, and Theodore acquired a larger restaurant. The restaurant closed shortly following the Wall Street Crash of 1929, due to financial problems. In 1931, the Agnew family's savings were wiped out in a bank failure. The family was forced to sell their private house and moved to a small apartment. Theodore sold fruit and vegetables from a roadside stall. Spiro helped financially support his family by taking part-time jobs, such as delivering groceries and distributing leaflets.\n\nIn 1937, Agnew started his college education at Johns Hopkins University. He pursued studies in chemistry, but found academic life to be stressful. He dropped out of his chemistry studies in 1939, then decided to pursue legal studies instead. He enrolled at the University of Baltimore School of Law, taking night classes. To financially support himself during his college years, he started working as an insurance clerk for the Maryland Casualty Company. Agnew pursued a romantic relationship with Elinor Isabel \"Judy\" Judefind, his co-worker at the insurance company. They were married in May 1942. By coincidence, her father was a chemist.\n\nAgnew was drafted into the United States Army in December 1941. He completed his basic training at Camp Croft in South Carolina, which he credited with breaking him out of his previously sheltered life. He was sent for further training to the Officer Candidate School at Fort Knox, Kentucky. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in May, 1942, a few days before his wedding.\n\nFrom May 1942 to March 1944, Agnew served in various administrative positions at both Fort Knox and Fort Campbell. In March 1944, Agnew was transferred to England. His transfer was part of the build-up of forces for the upcoming Normandy landings (June, 1944). Agnew spend several months on standby in Birmingham, West Midlands, before being assigned to a combat role. He was assigned as a replacement officer for the 54th Armored Infantry Battalion in France. His unit saw action at the Battle of the Bulge (December, 1944-January 1945). Agnew took part in the Siege of Bastogne (December, 1944), defending the Belgian city against a German attempt to recapture it.\n\nIn the early months of 1945, Agnew and his unit fought their way into Germany. By the end of the war in Europe, the unit had managed to capture the ski town of Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Bavaria. The town had previously hosted the 1936 Winter Olympic Games. Agnew was awarded the Combat Infantryman Badge and the Bronze Star for his combat service. He was discharged from the Army in November 1945.\n\nBy the winter of 1945, Agnew resumed his legal studies. He was also hired as a law clerk by the Baltimore-based law firm of Smith and Barrett. His boss Lester Barrett noted Agnew's political ambitions, and advised him to join the Republican Party. Barrett had noted that the Democratic Party in Baltimore had numerous young and ambitious political hopefuls, while the Republican Party was suffering from a scarcity of competent recruits. According to Barrett, it would be easier for Agnew to stand out in the Party that offered less competition for elected positions. Agnew took the advise, and became a registered Republican in 1947.\n\nIn 1947, Agnew graduated with a Bachelor of Laws. After passing the bar examination in Maryland, he opened his own legal office in Baltimore. His business soon failed, but Agnew found work as an insurance investigator. In 1948, he was hired as a store detective for the supermarket chain Schreiber's. In 1951, Agnew was briefly recalled for Army service due to the outbreak of the Korean War. He then resumed working for Schreiber's. He resigned in 1952, opening another legal office. He specialized in labor law.\n\nBy 1955, Agnew was prosperous enough to move with his family to the suburb of Loch Raven, Baltimore. He became the president of the local school district's Parent-Teacher Association. He also joined the service club Kiwanis, whose members volunteered for community service. His biographers have noted that Agnew had become \"an almost compulsive conformist\", and already professed a love for \"law and order\".\n\nIn 1956, Agnew unsuccessfully sought nomination as a Republican candidate for the Baltimore County Council. He campaigned vigorously for other Republican candidates, and the Party gained a majority on the council seats at the election. To reward his loyalty to the Party, party officials appointed Agnew for a one-year term to the county Zoning Board of Appeals. The job came with a respectable salary and some political prestige. In 1958, Agnew was reappointed to the Board for a full three-year term. He soon became the Board's chairman.\n\nIn 1960, Agnew unsuccessfully sought election to the county circuit court. He finished last among the five candidates of the election, but his campaign made him a target for the Democratic Party which regained control of the county council in the election. The new council quickly removed Agnew from his position at the Zoning Appeals Board, in what was seen as an unfair act of retaliation.\n\nIn 1962, Agnew was an unsuccessful candidate for nomination to a Congress seat. Party officials noted that Agnew had loyal followers, and encouraged him to seek election as the county's chief executive officer. All holders of this position were members of the Democratic Party since 1895. But in the 1962 elections, there was a feud between rival factions of the local Democratic Party. The Democratic candidate chosen was the elderly Michael Birmingham, who was seen as out of touch with the public's wishes. Agnew chose to run as a reformist candidate, campaigning for an anti-discrimination bill which would require public amenities such as parks, bars and restaurants be open to all races. Agnew easily won the election, surpassing his supposedly racist rival by over 18, 000 votes. Agnew became the highest-ranking Republican in Maryland.\n\nAgnew spend 4 years as a county executive. He succeeded in having his anti-discrimination bill pass as official legislation in the county. His administration build new schools, increases the teachers' salaries, reorganized the police department, and improved the water and sewer system. While he was seen as a moderately progressive administrator, Agnew's \"law and order\" rhetoric led him to denounce all demonstrations in the area, regardless of their cause. More controversial was Agnew's newfound reputation for cronyism. He bypassed the normal bidding procedures to appoint political allies in lucrative positions as the county's insurance brokers of record.\n\nIn the 1964 presidential elections, Agnew was a vocal critic of the Republican front-runner Barry Goldwater. In his view, Goldwater's extremist views would deprive the Republicans of any chance of victory. He was proven correct, as Goldwater lost the election and only won about 38.5% of the popular vote.\n\nIn the elections of 1966, Agnew decided to seek nomination for the position of the Governor of Maryland. He easily won the Republican primary, as he was the highest-profile candidate for the nomination. The Democratic candidate for this year was the segregationist George P. Mahoney. Liberal Democrats refused to vote for Mahoney, and flocked to support Agnew. Agnew easily won the election, gaining 49.5 percent of the popular vote. He had campaigned as the anti-Ku Klux Klan candidate.\n\nShortly after the election of 1966, allegations of corruption surfaced against Agnew. He had reportedly been offered three different bribes by the slot-machine industry in order to prevent him from vetoing legislation favorable to the industry. He had kept silent about the matter, though he had apparently declined to take the bribes. Agnew was also found to have partial ownership in a business venture, and his partners were businessmen who had ongoing business deals with Agnew's county administration. In both cases, Agnew publicly denied that he had broken the law.\n\nAgnew's agenda as a governor included tax reforms, clean water regulations, and the repeal of laws against interracial marriage. He expanded community health programs, and passed legislation offering higher educational and employment opportunities for low-income voters. He took steps to desegregate Maryland's schools. He introduced fair housing legislation, but only for new building projects and only for those projects above a certain size. Agnew's reputation for cronyism expanded, as he had close ties with an ever-increasing number of businessmen.\n\nDespite his own support for civil rights legislation, Agnew vocally opposed the militant tactics used by African-American leaders. He denounced protest leaders as professional agitators, and criticized the administration of Lyndon Johnson for its \"misguided compassion\" for radicals. In 1968, there were student protest at Bowie State College, a historically black institution. Agnew responded by closing the college and ordering more than 200 arrests.\n\nOn April 6, 1968, riots broke out in Baltimore in response to the then-recent assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. As the city burned, Agnew decided to declare a state of emergency and requested an intervention by the National Guard. By the time the riots ended, 6 people were dead and 4,000 people were under arrest. Agnew summoned moderate African-American leaders to the state capitol, where he castigated them for their perceived failure to control radical protesters. Agnew's criticisms for the African-American leadership gained him additional support from white suburbanites. Republican conservative leaders throughout the country increasingly lauded Agnew, while Agnew's African-American supporters felt betrayed by him.\n\nAs the 1968 presidential elections were approaching, Agnew declared his support for Nelson Rockefeller. When Rockefeller decided to discontinue his political campaign, Agnew was disappointed. Soon afterwards, Agnew started being courted as a political ally by Richard Nixon. Nixon had been impressed with his \"law and order\" rhetoric. At the Republican National Convention (August, 1968) in Miami Beach, Agnew declared his support for Nixon. On August 8, 1968, Nixon chose Agnew as his running mate for the election. Agnew himself felt surprised, as he was not among the highest-profile candidates for the position. He had only known Nixon for a few months.\n\nDuring the election campaign of 1968, Agnew's \"law and order\" rhetoric impressed voters in the Southern United States. Liberal Republicans in the Northern United States were , however, alarmed by his increasingly belligerent views and statements. Agnew criticized the Democratic candidate Hubert Humphrey as overly soft on communism, and compared his political views to those of Neville Chamberlain. Agnew's vocal support for \"orderliness, personal responsibility, the sanctity of hard work, the nuclear family, and law and order\" impressed suburban voters across the country. The Republican Party easily won the Presidential elections, gaining 43, 2% of the popular vote and carrying 32 states. Maryland voted for the Democratic Party, but Agnew was largely credited for the Republican victories in South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee and Kentucky. He was more popular in these states than Nixon himself.\n\nAs Vice President, Agnew was initially granted his own office in the West Wing of the White House. In December 1969, Agnew moved to another office in the Executive Office Building. As the Vice President had no official residence at the time, Agnew and his wife moved secured a suite at the Sheraton Hotel in Washington, D. C. The same suite had been used by Lyndon Johnson when he was Vice President. Nixon appointed Agnew as the new head of the \"White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs\", in charge of overseeing coordination between state, local, and tribal governments and the federal government. Agnew was not part of Nixon's inner circle of advisers, and Nixon often ignored Agnew's opinions on foreign policy matters.\n\nAgnew took his duties in the Senate seriously, personally opening every session for the first two months of his term. In the first year of his term in office, he spend more time presiding in the Senate than any vice president since Alben Barkley's term in office (term 1949-1953). Agnew lunched with small groups of senators, in an attempt to build good relations with them. Nixon appointed him as the chair of various government commissions, but many of these positions were sinecures. Agnew hoped for a more active role in politics.\n\nAgnew's speeches in 1969 warned that there was \"a vast faceless majority of the American public in quiet fury\" over the continued unrest in the country. In October 1969, Agnew gave a press conference where he denounced the apparent political ties between American protesters and the government of North Vietnam. Nixon was rather impressed with Agnew's approach, and tasked Agnew with attacking the Democrats in general. Nixon could thus appear to avoid mudslinging, while Agnew would become the president's \"attack dog\". Agnew found his new role to be enjoyable.\n\nBy late October 1969, Agnew started blaming \"liberal elites\" for condoning violence by demonstrators. Agnew's anti-intellectual speeches and newfound support for the South, further attracted Southern whites to the Republican Party. Agnew played a large role in Nixon's Southern Strategy, an attempt to turn the Southern United States into a Republican stronghold. Agnew kept attacking the Democrats as supposedly soft on crime, unpatriotic, and favoring flag burning over flag waving. His speeches attracted enthusiastic crowds, but liberal Republicans complained to the Republican National Committee that Agnew's attacks had a detrimental effect to the party's support.\n\nAfter Nixon's own Silent Majority speech (November 1969) met with a hostile reception by the American press, Agnew was encouraged to verbally attack the press itself as overly liberal and biased. Agnew drew praise from the conservative factions of both major parties, but alienated the press. Media executives started perceiving Agnew as a threat to the freedom of the press. Agnew singled out \"The New York Times\" and \"The Washington Post\" for criticism, as they were among the most vocal critics of Nixon's administration. By the end of November, Agnew enjoyed an approval rating of 64%. He had never been more popular in his political career.\n\nIn early 1970, Agnew became a popular speaker at Republican fund-raising events. He traveled over 25,000 miles (40,000 km) on behalf of the Republican National Committee. Agnew replaced Ronald Reagan as the party's leading fundraiser. He kept praising \"the everyday law-abiding American\", in an attempt to attract votes. In April 1970, Agnew finally managed to have one of his ideas about foreign policy heard by Nixon. Agnew's preferred solution for the Viet Cong strongholds in Cambodia was to launch an American attack on Cambodia. Nixon found the idea sound, approving it over the \"dovish\" advice from Secretary of State William P. Rogers and Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird.\n\nIn early May, 1970, Nixon cautioned Agnew to cease the verbal attacks on the student protest movement. Agnew had delivered an anti-student speech in reaction to the Kent State shootings. Nixon feared that the speech would backfire, and would cost a loss of support for Republicans in the upcoming midterm elections. In September of the same year, Agnew became the main speaker of the party's election campaign. Nixon also entrusted Agnew to verbally attack dissenting voices within the Republican Party, such as the novice senator Charles Goodell. The results of this election was disappointing for the Republicans. They gained two more seats in the Senate, but lost 11 governorships. Agnew was frustrated that Maryland had become a Democratic stronghold.\n\nDuring 1971, the relationship between Agnew and Richard Nixon deteriorated considerably. Agnew was too independent and outspoken for Nixon's tastes, and he was popular with factions of the party which were hostile to Nixon. Agnew typically disapproved on Nixon's foreign policy decisions, and he felt that Nixon was insufficiently committed to winning the Vietnam War. Nixon seriously considered replacing Agnew as his running mate in the 1972 presidential elections, but eventually decided against it.\n\nOn July 21, 1972, Nixon officially asked Agnew to become his running mate again. Agnew was mildly surprised, but he took the offer. Agnew was given a hero's welcome at the 1972 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, by delegates who viewed him as the party's future leader. His acceptance speech focused on praising the administration's accomplishments. Despite Nixon's instructions to the contrary, Agnew launched verbal attacks on George McGovern (the Democratic candidate of the election). During the election campaign, Nixon repeatedly instructed Agnew to tone down his verbal attacks on Democratic candidates. Meanwhile, Agnew was informed that administration officials were responsible for the Watergate break-in. He had no personal involvement in the matter, but felt that the break-in was a foolish decision.\n\nNixon and Agnew easily achieved re-election in the 1972 presidential elections. They won 60.7% of the popular vote, and carried 49 states. Massachusetts and the District of Columbia were the only areas who voted for the Democratic ticket. To Agnew's disappointment, Democrats dominated both houses of Congress after the election.\n\nBack in Maryland, there was an ongoing criminal investigation on long-term corruption in Baltimore County. Among those investigated by the authorities were public officials, architects, engineering firms, and paving contractors. While investigating the engineering firm of Lester Matz, the authorities learned that Matz had won many of his contracts through the direct influence of Agnew. And Agnew was paid 5% of the value of each contract, in a bribery scheme that had lasted for most of his political career. Agnew learned of this investigation in February 1973, but district attorney George Beall assured him that he would do his best to protect Agnew's name.\n\nBy June 1973, evidence surfaced that Agnew had continued to receive bribes during his term as a vice president. Unlike previous charges against him, he was not protected by the statute of limitations. Further witnesses came forward to report criminal transactions with Agnew. Nixon himself was informed of the case in July 1973. By August 1973, the first press reports on Agnew's criminal activities surfaced. In October 1973, Agnew entered into negotiations for a plea bargain on the condition that he would not serve jail time. Agnew pleaded no contest to a tax evasion charge on October 10, 1973. As part of the plea bargain, the other charges against him were dropped. Agnew was fined 10,000 dollars, and was placed on three years' unsupervised probation. He officially resigned from the vice presidency on October 10. Nixon replaced him as vice president with Gerald Ford. Unlike Agnew, Ford had a reputation for personal honesty.\n\nFollowing his resignation, Agnew moved to his summer home at Ocean City. He was initially unable to pay for his legal bills. He received a loan of 200,000 dollars from singer Frank Sinatra (1915-1998), who he had befriended during his political career. Agnew hoped that he would be able to resume his career as a lawyer. The Maryland Court of Appeals disbarred him in 1974, due to surfacing evidence about his crimes.\n\nAgnew eventually secured enough funds to establish his own business consultancy, Pathlite Inc. He attracted an international clientele. Among his early successes was preparing a contract that would provide new uniforms for the Iraqi Army. Agnew lost money when he invested in a beer distributionship in Texas. In 1976, he published his debut novel \"The Canfield Decision\". Based on his own political career, it depicted an American vice president who has a troubled relationship with his president. The book was a best seller, and earned Agnew 100,000 dollars for serialization rights alone. But it attracted considerable controversy for its supposed anti-Semitism. Agnew had used the novel to publicize his views that the American news media were controlled by (in his words) \"Zionist lobbies\". He made further statements to the press against Israel and its influence on the United States.\n\nIn 1977, Agnew was wealthy enough to purchase a new home in Rancho Mirage, California. He also fully repaid Frank Sinatra's loan. In the same year's \"Nixon interviews\", Richard Nixon publicly defended Agnew's reputation. Nixon stated that Agnew must have been unaware that he was breaking the law by receiving bribes.\n\nIn 1980, Agnew claimed to be facing new financial problems. He secured an interest-free loan from Fahd bin Abdulaziz, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. He claimed that they had a common enemy in Israel, and voiced support for Saudi Arabia's anti-Israel policies. Also in 1980, Agnew published his memoir: \"Go Quietly ... or Else\". The book claimed that Agnew had never taken a bribe, and that the charges against him were unjust. The book was discredited when George White (Agnew's former lawyer) testified that Agnew had confessed to him about his many years of receiving bribes. The book also claimed that Agnew had unwillingly resigned in 1973, because Nixon administration officials had threatened him with assassination. The officials named in the book later denied that they had ever threatened Agnew.\n\nIn 1980, Agnew gave his first television interview in several years. He advised young people never to seek a political career, because high public office came at the price of overwhelming expectations. In 1981, legal students of the \"George Washington University Law School\" launched a lawsuit against Agnew. Agnew had been found to have received 268,482 dollars in bribes, and they argued that he should fully repay that sum to the state. In 1981, a court sentenced Agnew to pay the state 147,500 dollars for the kickbacks, and 101,235 dollars in interest. He fully repaid the debt in 1983. He then launched a legal case in an attempt to declare the payments as tax-deductible. He lost his case in 1989.\n\nIn 1987, Agnew was the plaintiff in a court case in Brooklyn. He was forced to disclose information about the business activities of his company, Pathlite, Inc.. He was found to have various business activities in Argentina, France, Greece, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Taiwan, and West Germany. The court found no evidence of illegal activities. Agnew claimed at the time that his business success was based on his ability \"to penetrate to the top people\".\n\nIn 1994, Agnew was invited to Richard Nixon's funeral at Yorba Linda, California. He decided to attend it, though he had intentionally avoided all contact with Nixon and his family for two decades. He received a warm welcome by former colleagues from the Nixon administration. In 1995, Agnew was invited to the Capitol in Washington D.C. for the dedication ceremony of a bust of him. He gave his first speech in many years, in order to address his poor reputation.\n\nOn September 16, 1996, Agnew suddenly collapsed at his summer home in Ocean City, Maryland. He was transferred to a hospital, and he died there on September 17. He was 77-years-old. An autopsy revealed that he was suffering from untreated acute leukemia. His death came as a surprise to his family and friends. Agnew had remained fit and active into his seventies, and regularly played golf and tennis. He had no visible signs of poor health.\n\nAgnew was buried at Timonium, Maryland, in a ceremony primarily attended by members of his family. Among his former political allies, only Pat Buchanan bothered to attend the funeral. Buchanan had written some of Agnew's speeches. There was also an honor guard of the combined military services at the funeral. Agnew was survived by his wife Judy Agnew, who died in 2012. They had 4 children. Agnew is considered among the most controversial American politicians of the 20th century, but he is also counted among the influential founders of the New Right movement. Some of Agnew's political tactics have been imitated by other Republican politicians, particularly his attacks on the press.\n\nThe preeminent singing sister act of all time with well over 75 million records sold by which the swinging big-band era could not be better represented were the fabulous Andrews Sisters: the blonde melodic mezzo Patty Andrews, the brunette soprano Maxene Andrews and the red-headed contralto Laverne Andrews.\n\nWith their precise harmonies and perfectly syncopated dance moves, the girls reached heights of worldwide fame still unattained by any group which followed. They delivered an optimistic, upbeat war campaign that instilled hope, joy and allegiance through song, comedy, and lively movement. Providing a musical security blanket to a war-torn country via records, films, radio, clubs, stages, canteens, they bravely traveled overseas war zones emphasizing through song the motto that America was strong and proud ... and to keep on singing and swinging! Unfortunately, while the adhesive harmonies of The Andrews Sisters were intricately close, their personal harmonies were more discordant.\n\nSecond only to perhaps Bob Hope in commitment and extensive USO touring, the girls' profound influence extends even today with such current pop idols as Bette Midler, The Pointer Sisters, Barry Manilow, The Manhattan Transfer and Christina Aguilera. All have reinvented themselves in Andrews Sisters' style at one time or another. .\n\nHailing from Minnesota, eldest sister LaVerne Sophie was born on July 6, 1911, followed by Maxene Angelyn on January 3, 1916, and finally Patricia Marie on February 16, 1918. Greek father Peter was a restaurateur in the Minneapolis area; their mother Ollie was a Norwegian homemaker. Childhood was, for the most part, lost to them. The girls' musical talents were quickly identified and they started performing on the road as youngsters, entering assorted kiddie contests and often winning for their efforts. They practically grew up on the vaudeville circuit, roughing it and toughing it with various bands and orchestras.\n\nSigned by orchestra leader Leon Belasco in 1937, the girls made their very first recordings with \"There's a Lull in My Life\" (an early solo by Patty), \"Jammin'\" and \"Wake Up and Live.\" Subsequent radio work eventually led to the Decca Records label. Although LaVerne read music and was, in fact, an accomplished pianist, the trio learned by sense memory, pure instinct and a strong ear. Patty, the youngest, became the lively melodic leader, engulfed by the warm harmonies of LaVerne and Maxene.\n\nThe old Yiddish song \"Bei Mir Bist Du Schon\" was translated into English for them by Sammy Cahn and the girls walked off with their first huge hit in late 1937 (and paid a flat fifty dollars and no royalties!). An overnight sensation upon release wherein it sold more than a million copies, their contract was immediately revised by Decca and throughout the rest of the decade, they recorded smash after smash -- \"The Beer Barrel Polka (Roll Out the Barrel!),\" \"Well, All Right,\" \"Hold Tight, Hold Tight\" (with Jimmy Dorsey ), \"Oh, Johnny! Oh, Johnny! Oh!,\" and their first two duets with Bing Crosby in 1939: \"Ciribiribin\" and \"Yodelin' Jive\" (both featuring jazz violinist Joe Venuti and his orchestra).\n\nThe country was absolutely enthralled and captivated. Universal responded in like by signing them to some of their nonsensical \"B\" musicals derived purely for escapism as the U.S. prepared itself and became embroiled in WW2. Their first appearance co-starred the zany and sometimes corny antics of The Ritz Brothers in an unflattering ditty called Argentine Nights (1940). The frizzy-bobbed trio were introduced as a sort of specialty act with the songs \"Hit the Road,\" \"Oh, He Loves Me\" and \"Rhumboogie.\" This was followed by a 1-2-3 punch back at the recording studio with their renditions of the rollicking \"Beat Me, Daddy, Eight to the Bar,\" a reinvention of the WW1 waltz \"I'll Be with You in Apple Blossom Time\" and the soft, sentimental ballad \"Mean to Me.\"\n\nTheir second film was the above-average Bud Abbott - Lou Costello vehicle Buck Privates (1941), which solidly showcased the tunes \"You're a Lucky Fellow, Mr. Smith,\" \"Bounce Me Brother with a Solid Four,\" \"I'll Be with You in Apple Blossom Time,\" and their infectious signature jump hit \"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy.\" The girls vocalized perfectly and stepped in swinging time for two other Bud Abbott - Lou Costello comedies, In the Navy (1941) and Vorsicht Gespenster! (1941).\n\nBox-office sellouts on stage and in personal appearances across the nation, they were given their own radio show in late 1944, which continued through 1946, featuring such weekly guest stars as Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, Bob Hope, Eddie Cantor, Bud Abbott and Lou Costello, Carmen Miranda, Judy Garland, Ethel Merman, Rudy Vallee, and many other prominent celebrities. In late1947, CBS Radio signed the sisters as regulars on \"Club Fifteen\" (they appeared three times a week for five years with alternating hosts Bob Crosby and crooner Dick Haymes.\n\nIn 1942, Universal decided it was the right time to spruce them up and give them a bit more on-screen persona by featuring them front-and-center in what turned out to be an unfortunate string of poorly-produced \"quickies.\" In Give Out, Sisters (1942), they posed as rich society matron types out to better their careers while featuring their big hit \"Pennsylvania Polka.\" In Private Buckaroo (1942), they put on a show for servicemen singing, among others, the huge hit \"Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree with Anyone Else But Me\". The plots may have been pancake-thin but they were sure-fire morale boosters and needed war-time tension relievers. No trained actresses by any margin, the girls emanated a down-home naturalness and appeal with a comedic flair that attracted audiences coast-to-coast.\n\nIn later films, the girls played everything from \"lonely hearts\" club managers in Always a Bridesmaid (1943), to elevator operators in How's About It? (1943), to war-time factory workers in Swingtime Johnny (1943). The girls were also featured in Universal's Follow the Boys (1944) and Paramount's Hollywood-Kantine (1944), popular all-star productions designed to promote the war effort. With a never-say-die flair, they finished up their Universal contract rather inauspiciously with Her Lucky Night (1945), just as WW2 had come to an end.\n\nStill highly in demand in the recording studio, on radio, on stage and in clubs, they had no trouble moving on. In the post-war years, they appeared in Paramount's Die Welt dreht sich verkehrt (1947) and teamed with Bing Crosby on \"You Don't Have to Know the Language.\" The picture was the highest-grossing film of that year. The Disney company also utilized the girls' voices in their cartoon features Lachkonzert in Entenhausen (1946) and Musik, Tanz und Rhythmus (1948).\n\nAll three girls experienced down times in their personal lives as well during the late-1940s. There were rumblings amid the group. Maxene and Patty went through painful divorces (Maxene split with the group's manager Lou Levy; Patty lost agent and husband, Martin Melcher to singer Doris Day), and lost their parents within a year of each other, as did their mentor Jack Kapp of Decca Records. Moreover, the girls squabbled over their parents' estate shares and individual career desires.\n\nIn 1953, Patty, the group's lead, declared she was going solo. LaVerne and Maxene attempted to duo for a time until Maxene attempted suicide, of a drug overdose in 1954, heartbroken over the brittle breakup of the group. LaVerne denied the suicide attempt to reporters. The girls reunited in 1956 and worked constantly for the next decade in recording studios (Capitol and Dot), on stages throughout the world (frequently in England), and in countless guest-star television spots.\n\nLaVerne's serious illness in 1966, however, promptly ended the trio permanently. She died of liver cancer in May of the next year. Maxene retired shortly after and became Dean of Women at a Tahoe, Nevada college. Patty, ever the trouper, continued on television, in clubs and in film cameos...wherever there was an audience.\n\nIn 1973, Patty and Maxene reunited for their first Broadway musical, the nostalgic \"Over Here\" (Tony-winning Janie Sell played the LaVerne counterpart) in which they performed their old standards following the show's second act; but it did little to repair the strained Patty/Maxene off-stage relationship, especially since LaVerne wasn't around to foster peace-making tactics. As Maxene blamed Patty's husband, Walter Weschler, as an instigator in separating her from Patty, the estrangement remained permanent until Maxene's death in 1995.\n\nThe two sisters did reunite briefly when they earned a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1987. The group was also inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1998. Patty sang in shows and on cruise ships while Maxene continued soloing and did quite well for a time in such musical shows as \"Pippin\" and \"Swing Time Canteen\" (the latter as late as 1995).\n\nPlagued by heart problems (she suffered a massive heart attack in 1982), Maxene died of a second coronary on October 21, 1995. Patty remained in seclusion in her Northridge home near Los Angeles with husband Wally for years. After his death in 2010, Patty began a slow and steady decline and died on January 30, 2013, just two weeks before her 95th birthday.\n\nFortunately, The Andrews Sisters' legendary feuding can never overshadow their exhaustive musical contributions and unparalleled success during 36 years of performing together. In 1987, the group was honored with a Hollywood Walk of Fame star for their recording work. The following year, they were among the inaugural inductees to the Vocal Group Hall of Fame."
