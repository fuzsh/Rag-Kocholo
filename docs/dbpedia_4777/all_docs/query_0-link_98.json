        "text": "Prior to becoming AIM’s interim CEO in April following Silvia Montello’s exit, former COO Davy had a hand in a wide range of industry initiatives — from the creation of an agreement to improve music metadata based on the United Kingdom’s Streaming Inquiry, to the Worldwide Independent Network’s AI Principles best practices, to the British government’s Streaming Transparency Code of Practice. Of the lattermost, which seeks to streamline digital monetization, Davy says, “My work has ensured the code is practical for all businesses, regardless of scale, type, location or background.”\n\nThe last year has been busy for the digital rights agency: Not only did it add six new faces to its board (which now spans 12 countries), but Merlin continued to expand and improve its Merlin Engage mentorship program. Tapping into its membership, the program pairs “executive-level mentors with talented mentees … as a means to help empower the next generation of female leaders in the independent community,” Sirota says. Last year, Merlin doubled the size of that program while introducing workshops to assist mentees with “public speaking, time management and executive presence.”\n\nLVRN recently signed South African amapiano DJ duo TxC and partnered with South African artist agency HGA and producer Tony Duardo (who helped shape Uncle Waffles’ breakout debut single, “Tanzania“); Grimes calls the deals “an exciting and essential part of our journey toward becoming a truly global independent company.” She cites the “international success” of TxC’s “Turn Off the Lights” and HGA artist Ggoldie’s “Asambe” as examples of that work paying off. “Tunde Balogun, who sealed the deal, and Jairus ‘J.Shep’ Sheppard, who oversees the partnership, have been actively involved in South Africa,” Grimes adds, “immersing themselves in the music culture to establish a robust infrastructure for local creators to thrive both locally and globally.”\n\nRimas landed at No. 2 on Billboard’s Top Latin Labels year-end chart, and marquee artist Bad Bunny was the Top Latin Artist for the fifth straight year. But Rimas’ strength goes beyond a single name. The 10-year-old label, known primarily for its urban music roster, also boasts trap star Eladio Carrión (No. 21 on the Top Latin Artists year-end chart), veteran Arcángel (No. 24 on the chart) and newcomer Mora, who in the past three years has placed seven hits on Hot Latin Songs. “I have the honor of saying I work with people who want to work with me and I want to work with them, too,” Assad says. “I have a philosophy: I do 30% of the job. If an artist gives 100%, we’re at 130%. There’s always potential to grow and to develop.”\n\nThrough acquisitions of such labels as Heroic Music Group and partnerships with +1 Records and Mom + Pop Music, among others, investment fund Exceleration Music has put a stamp on the industry since a diverse collection of indie music veterans founded it in 2021. One particular acquisition, North Carolina-based Redeye Worldwide in September 2023, stands out because it “put us in a position to offer other indie labels both physical and digital distribution services on a global basis,” says Barros, a former CEO of Concord Music Group.\n\nThis year, Big Machine partnered with Dolly Parton’s Butterfly Records for the release of her 49th studio album, Rockstar, which achieved Parton’s biggest first-week sales of the Luminate era, dating to 1991, Borchetta says, noting that she “topped charts she has never even charted on before,” including her first No. 1s on Top Rock & Alternative Albums and Top Rock Albums. Borchetta continued the company’s push into the genre with the signing of legendary rock outfit Mötley Crüe — “The new music is ferocious,” he says — and saw Brett Young’s “In Case You Didn’t Know” certified diamond by the RIAA, the ninth country song to achieve that level and BMLG’s third.\n\nG59 Record$’s marquee act, $uicideboy$, had a career year in 2023, generating 2.5 million album consumption units in the United States, including 3.4 billion on-demand streams — both peaks for the group, and metrics that have grown each year since its 2016 Billboard chart debut. Or, as Biondi puts it, “In 2023, $uicideboy$ were named one of Billboard’s top-grossing hip-hop touring artists of all time, one of Spotify’s top groups of 2023 and one of SoundCloud’s top five most streamed artists.” Overall, he adds, the G59 roster produced 4.5 billion streams in 2023, while the annual Grey Day 2023 Tour grossed $42.9 million across 44 days from 431,000 tickets sold.\n\nGeneration Now continues to tower over the competition, courtesy of its two superstar signings, Jack Harlow and Lil Uzi Vert. Last year, the latter enjoyed a top 10 single on the Billboard Hot 100 with his Jersey Club-influenced song “Just Wanna Rock.” Harlow was also a Hot 100 staple, most notably with “Lovin’ on Me,” which peaked at No. 1 and reigned for six weeks. In late May, Harlow hosted his first-ever Gazebo Festival in Louisville, Ky., featuring himself, SZA, Pinkpantheress, James Blake and more.\n\nCatling is especially proud of “taking AudioSalad into its next phase of growth, in particular global expansion,” having run point on its acquisition by SESAC Music Group last March. And while the metadata management and distribution platform launched its own data analytics product that can detect fraudulent activity and stream manipulation, Catling also warns of technology’s rapid advancements: “The very thing that initially created more opportunities for indies now presents a more complex, competitive market,” he says. “The independent community must fully understand the impact technology brings and equip themselves to navigate the new, challenging environment.”\n\nDreamville signee JID experienced unexpected success with “Surround Sound,” the 21 Savage- and Baby Tate-featuring single from his 2022 album, The Forever Story. Thanks to TikTok’s viral Ceiling Challenge, “Surround Sound” reached No. 40 on the Hot 100 and earned the rapper his first chart-topper on Rhythmic Airplay in March and highest-charting entry on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, peaking at No. 13 nearly two years after its release. J. Cole’s surprise mixtape, Might Delete Later, debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 and became his seventh No. 1 project on Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, while its buzzy Kendrick Lamar dis track, “7 Minute Drill,” debuted at No. 6 on the Hot 100 — even after he publicly apologized for it at this year’s Dreamville Festival and eventually removed the song from streaming services.\n\nThe 60th anniversary of Curb Records in 2024 is the company’s “greatest achievement” of late, Curb says, adding that Lee Brice surpassed 1.5 million equivalent album units of his Hey World album, for King + Country’s Burn the Ships went gold and Dylan Scott’s second studio album, Livin’ My Best Life, has nearly gone platinum. Independence itself is also a point of pride for Curb, whose empire includes Word Entertainment; still, he says, indie labels “need to find more new, innovative ways to break new artists to positively impact radio and the charts.”\n\nIt’s hard to overstate the impact that Big Loud’s Morgan Wallen has had in recent years. His 2023 album, One Thing at a Time, was the biggest in the United States last year, with 5.4 million equivalent album units; his January 2021 release, Dangerous: The Double Album, was No. 5, with 2.2 million units; and his One Thing at a Time single “Last Night” racked up 1 billion U.S. on-demand audio streams in 2023, the most in a calendar year ever and just the second song to surpass 1 billion streams in a calendar year. Coupled with stars like ERNEST and HARDY, it’s little surprise that Big Loud was named Billboard’s top country label for 2023.\n\nEMPIRE has established a dominant position in West Africa, but its recent expansion into the rest of the African continent and the Middle East “has proved that we are continuing to build out our global footprint,” Kadin says. Closer to home, the company has overseen a breakout year for Shaboozey, the rising country star with whom they first partnered in 2021: He landed two featured spots on Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter, and his solo track “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” flew into the top five of the Hot 100 in May.\n\nFollowing a period highlighted by acclaimed new albums from Del Water Gap and MGMT — the latter of which also enjoyed a Saltburn-led catalog revival — Goldstone and Rudd are now prepping for much-anticipated new sets from Porter Robinson and Tiny Habits. “With more talent and accessibility than ever before, there’s an incredible opportunity for new artistry to thrive and grow,” Rudd says of what makes the industry exciting in 2024. “We want to make sure that we continue to develop long-lasting careers in times where attention on artists can sometimes move quickly.”\n\nLast summer, Stem made headlines by raising $250 million in capital for artist advances — and, in the months since, it has put those dollars to work. While continuing to financially back musicians forging careers outside of the traditional major-label machine, the company recently unveiled a new product, Tone, which simplifies royalty tracking and payouts for users. Among its artist success stories in the past year is pop band LANY, whose single “XXL” logged 17 weeks on the Pop Airplay chart and appeared on the inaugural TikTok Billboard Top 50 list.\n\nThe Azoff Company-owned label, launched in 2022, brought on Mighty Mighty Bosstones co-founder and accomplished A&R veteran Albert as president in January, adding him to an impressive executive roster that includes former Columbia co-head of urban music Holiday and longtime marketing whiz LaMotte. This past year, they’ve had big success with Cash Cobain, whose breakout single, “Fisherr,” is “the culmination of all of his creative brilliance and the hard work put in by his whole team,” the trio said in a statement. “Streaming, social, press, radio, live events and the right co-signs have helped us elevate him to the place we always knew he should be.”\n\nSince its March 2023 launch, gamma., which purchased indie distributor Vydia, has logged several impressive wins. Chief among them was Usher’s epic Super Bowl performance in February, as well as two Adult R&B Airplay No. 1s — “Good Good” with 21 Savage and Summer Walker and “Risk It All” with H.E.R. — from his long-awaited album, Coming Home. And Sexyy Red continued to pound her way to fame with a cameo on Drake’s “Rich Baby Daddy,” a stellar turn at Rolling Loud California and a top 20 Hot 100 hit in “Get It Sexyy.” Citing Rick Ross and Meek Mill’s joint album, Too Good To Be True, as well, Jackson says, “Our market share has grown substantially and quite rapidly based on the output and success of such releases.”\n\nBlack River artist Kelsea Ballerini’s acclaimed 2023 EP, Rolling Up the Welcome Mat, reached No. 11 on Billboard’s Top Country Albums chart and earned her a Grammy nomination for best country album and a Country Music Association Awards nod for album of the year. In February, she re-signed with Black River. In 2023, the label also added Scotty Hasting to its roster. Froio says one of the biggest issues facing the independent community is “recognition. Indies can help artists grow as well as the majors.”\n\nScoring hits such as Artemas’ “I Like the Way You Kiss Me” (a 10K Projects track that hit No. 1 on the Billboard Global Excl. U.S. chart) and The K’s’ debut album, I Wonder If the World Knows? (a LAB release that reached No. 2 on the U.K. Official Albums chart), Warner Music Group’s independent distribution division has “never felt more in sync,” Kreidich says. “The increasing strength of our global teams helped deliver multiple chart-topping results around the world,” she adds, citing Mexico’s Bellakath and Germany’s AYLIVA as proof.\n\nDale Play’s remarkable growth across management, records, live entertainment, gaming and publishing is exemplified by Duki, who sold out Madrid’s Santiago Bernabeu Stadium for his June 8 show as early as January, following a massive turnout of over 150,000 at Buenos Aires’ River Plate Stadium. Additionally, Bizarrap won three Latin Grammys in 2023 for his “Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 52” and “Vol. 53” with Quevedo and Shakira, respectively, and performed at Coachella in April. The label further expanded its reach by signing superstar Paulo Londra, while its touring division has sold over 1.5 million tickets in Latin America for major tours with artists like Karol G, Maná and Alejandro Sanz.\n\nLubliner defines being indie as “pushing boundaries,” a quality he shares with the artists on his roster, all of whom are set for busy years ahead. In January, John Summit sold out his first Madison Square Garden show ahead of releasing his debut album this summer; alternative artist d4vd scored a major synch with “Feel It” for Amazon Prime Video’s animated series Invincible; and the label’s biggest star, Billie Eilish, released her third album, Hit Me Hard and Soft, in May. Her project followed a winning awards season with “What Was I Made For?” from the Barbie soundtrack, which won the Academy Award for best original song and the Grammy for song of the year.\n\nWorking releases from artists such as Passenger, Paris Paloma and SYML, Nettwerk has spent the last 18 months building a model around fan-connected artist communities. “Rather than solely relying on traditional promotion or genre-based marketing, we harness the power of audience affinities and behavioral patterns to build shared success across our artist communities,” Mortimer-Lamb says. “We leverage data science to understand audience engagement and maximize success through a full suite of artist development services. From online engagement strategies to retail marketing and everything in between, we’ve tailored our approach to leverage the power of music scenes and artist communities.”\n\nAyers describes Beggars Group’s 2023 as “perhaps the most musically diverse period in the company’s history,” thanks to Peggy Gou’s global dance hit, “(It Goes Like) Nanana,” along with “successful records” in many other genres, from jazz saxophonist Kamasi Washington to Tuareg guitar great Mdou Moctar. In addition, Queens of the Stone Age cracked the top 10 on the Billboard 200 with a new album and scored a pair of rock Grammy nominations, while Romy earned one for best dance/electronic recording. There are more where these came from — Ayers is thrilled by “the abundance of exciting new artists” in the independent community.\n\nPastor says four of Virgin Music Group’s top five songs over the past year — Rema and Selena Gomez’s “Calm Down,” Jungkook’s “Seven” (featuring Latto), Jimin’s “Like Crazy” and Eslabon Armado and Peso Pluma’s “Ella Baila Sola” — came from outside the United States or were recorded in a language other than English. “That’s an awesome reflection of our global business,” Pastor says, adding that the company has “spent the past year centralizing our global team” — a reference to the October announcement of Virgin’s leadership, with executives’ responsibilities split across five regions as part of Universal Music Group’s artist services consolidation.\n\nXL added to its roster of indie megastars such as Adele and Radiohead by signing South Korean DJ-producer Peggy Gou, whose “(It Goes Like) Nanana” hit No. 33 on the Billboard Global 200 in September, and Irish club-rockers Fontaines D.C. Romy, a member of Young veterans The xx, earned a 2024 Grammy nomination for her dance hit with Fred again.., “Strong.” North says his focus is on “helping artists who put their music and craft first find a balance with the extraordinary demands of social media and promotion.”\n\nWith the Grammy-winning album Bewitched by jazz-pop sensation Laufey, the viral smashes “Back on 74” by Jungle and “End of Beginning” by Djo, and the critical success of Drop 7 by British rapper Little Simz, AWAL has proved it can go toe-to-toe with the major labels by doing things its own way. Olinick says that with AWAL’s flexible deal offerings ranging from distribution to full label services, its artists are intent on “building a real fan base,” which “is done over years, with the artist putting in the work of becoming the best at their craft. It requires riding out extreme lows in the pursuit of creating better and better art.”\n\nLast year, Cinq Music landed several new initiatives and large deals, including the launch of a new Nashville office, the closing of a $300 million fund for the acquisition of music intellectual property (which led to the purchase of late producer Flow La Movie’s catalog) and signing a deal with Fuerza Regida’s Street Mob Records. Earlier this year, Cinq raised another $250 million from parent company GoDigital Media Group to fund further acquisitions of music rights, “which will allow the company to continue its trajectory as a major global independent music company driving large and fast-growing music genres forward, including reggaetón and música mexicana,” Daffurn says.\n\nArtist Partner Group is on a roll, thanks to a boost from breakout producer Odetari, who in 2023 landed three straight top 10 singles on Billboard’s Hot Dance/Electronic Songs, including the genre-blending dance hit with 6arelyhuman, “GMFU,” which has racked up 145.9 million U.S. on-demand streams. “As an independent label, we accumulated almost 4 billion streams last year and are on track to crush that in 2024,” Piccarreta says. Other artists contributing to APG’s success include Lay Bankz, who topped the TikTok Billboard Top 50 chart with “Tell Ur Girlfriend” in May.\n\nThe iconic Seattle indie label, which turns 36 this year, finds itself “more inspired than ever by the incredible talent of the artists we work with and the overwhelming dedication and passion of our team,” says Kiewel, who counts releases from acts like METZ, Amen Dunes, Iron & Wine, J Mascis, Washed Out, Shabazz Palaces, Man Man, La Luz, Pissed Jeans, Weyes Blood and Bully as some of the label’s best output for the year. “We were also honored to celebrate newly platinum-certified singles from Father John Misty and Suki Waterhouse, along with the multiplatinum status for Beach House’s ‘Space Song,’ ” he adds.\n\nAfter spearheading a global campaign for Lizzo that culminated in the superstar winning record of the year at the 2023 Grammys for her Hot 100-­topping “About Damn Time,” Nice Life is applying that playbook to the wide range of artists on its roster. In the last year, the company has signed new talent including TisaKorean and Ambar Lucid, helped Tinashe launch her first Coachella performance in 2024 and successfully promoted the work of fast-rising cumbia singer Estevie. It’s a return to form for the company, according to Reed: “It’s a passion to lift up voices that are not in the mainstream conversation,” he says, “to always champion the underdog.”\n\nAlready an indie powerhouse of the new Mexican music movement in the United States, Rancho Humilde opened an office in Mexico in November, “strategically expanding our territorial footprint and unlocking a plethora of new opportunities,” Sánchez says, including high-grossing tours for top acts Natanael Cano, Junior H and Fuerza Regida. Sánchez also spearheaded a campaign to capture radio airplay for Rancho Humilde artists who have long thrived on digital exposure alone and secured three Latin Airplay No. 1s for Fuerza Regida, including smash hit “Bebe Dame” with Grupo Frontera, significantly heightening brand visibility.\n\nGaither has “achieved significant milestones” in growing its reach and impact within music and media, Sizelove says, including through its distribution deal with Virgin Music Label & Artists Services/Capitol Christian Music Group to cover master recordings and publishing. “This alliance underscores our commitment to providing a platform for our artists to share their music with audiences worldwide,” he says. Another notable achievement is this year’s launch of music company Sun Label Group under Primary Wave, which combines the legacies of Gaither, Sun Records, Green Hill Music and emeraldwave by Green Hill into “a cohesive and forward-thinking musical conglomerate.”\n\nMelhado says the company attributes its “significant growth” over the past 18 months in part to striking new partnerships with artists such as Brent Faiyaz, Earthgang and Anycia while also intensifying its focus on artist development, citing BigXthaPlug and Ekkstacy as examples. Also noteworthy is the company’s international expansion through foundational partnerships with Davido and Sarz in Nigeria; Veigh, Nagalli and Supernova in Brazil; and FloyyMenor and Nickoog Clk in Chile. “With these achievements,” Melhado says, “we’re well positioned to empower the next generation of independent talent at every phase of their career.”\n\nAs Secretly Group expanded with new offices in Paris, Berlin, Amsterdam and Sydney, Mitski (Dead Oceans) went similarly global in 2023 thanks to “My Love Mine All Mine,” which became “a top 10 streaming song on Spotify in countries throughout North America, Europe, [the Middle East and Africa], Southeast Asia, Australia and beyond,” Waldorf says. A six-week No. 1 on the TikTok Billboard Top 50 chart (and a top 30 hit on the Hot 100), “it is a song that has traveled everywhere,” he adds. “The exponential growth of Mitski on her seventh album is a huge achievement.”\n\nTaylor highlights the label’s work on The Lumineers’ fourth studio album, Brightside, which debuted at No. 6 on the Billboard 200 upon its 2022 release and has accumulated 486,000 album consumption units in the United States. Taylor says MNRK just wrapped up its work on the “amazing campaign” for the release, adding, “We have recently re-signed with the group, and we are planning their fifth album now.”\n\nWith its own label, studio, publishing company and management firm, Quality Control opted to handle most affairs in-house, only tapping external partners like 300 Entertainment and, later, Motown for bigger marketing and radio pushes. The system worked. The Atlanta-based independent media company minted a bevy of stars including Migos, Lil Baby and City Girls and exported numerous hits over its decade-plus run. But in 2023, Thomas and Lee charted a new course and sold Quality Control to HYBE America, the U.S. subsidiary of Korean entertainment juggernaut HYBE. True to form, though, the pair retained control of the company to ensure the quality remains.\n\nTorres divides his time between his indie label, The Wave Music Group — in partnership with Caleb Calloway — and his management company, Top Floor Talent, and has found success with both. Wave is home to exciting new talent Young Miko, who was honored at Billboard’s 2024 Women in Music event, opened for Karol G, collaborated with top names in Latin music including Bad Bunny and whose debut album, att., landed at No. 9 on the Top Latin Albums chart. At Top Floor, Torres works with up-and-coming singer-songwriter Mariangela and rapper Álvaro Díaz. “This year, [Díaz] co-headlined Mexico’s most prestigious festival, Ceremonia,” he says. “I’m very proud of what we’ve accomplished together and what’s to come.”\n\nIn 2023, Downtown “completed the final phase of a comprehensive integration aligning all of our companies as a unified group,” van Rijn says, noting that 30% of all Grammy winners in 2024 worked with the company in some capacity. That reorganization makes it better equipped to navigate what van Rijn calls “a point of radical transformation” in the music industry, as AI technology becomes more popular and “opportunities for independent creators to make music and engage with their audiences” keep expanding. “As the music ecosystem continues to grow,” van Rijn says, “we must anticipate the challenges that growth creates.”\n\nThird Man Records is, according to White, “a world unto itself.” And while that world already includes a label, book publisher, pressing plant and school band recording programs, it recently expanded to include Third Man Hardware, which makes “strange” and innovative effects pedals and equipment. “It takes a large, talented team to make a Hollywood film, even with an amazing auteur director,” White says. “It’s no different for making an album or a music career, and even some of the best DIY artists can’t be expected to do it all themselves. That’s where labels can and should help artists.”\n\nContinuing to guide their legendary label to its next successful chapter penned by R&B singer-songwriter Jacquees and rappers Eighty8, Onsight Deeda and Saxkboy KD, the Crescent City natives received keys to their beloved hometown of New Orleans earlier this year as the mayor commended their “contributions to music and commitment to the community.” Recently selected to participate in YouTube’s Leaders & Legends initiative, Ronald notes that for him and his brother, the bottom line is still about “having the freedom we’ve always had: to sign artists we want and work with artists we choose to work with.”"
