        "text": "With live sports content about to flood the pipelines, the infrastructure of the streaming advertising business may not be able to handle it.\n\nMore and more major sports coverage will migrate to streaming in the next two years, with Amazon’s likely NBA package for Prime Video and Netflix’s Christmas Day NFL games just two of the most prominent examples.\n\nAnd streaming-exclusive broadcasts are only part of the picture. Disney’s direct-to-consumer ESPN product is set to launch by next fall, while the joint streaming venture dubbed Venu Sports will bring linear sports broadcasts to cord-cutters later this year (barring antitrust action).\n\nThere’s no question advertisers are eager to seize upon the new inventory that’s soon to become available. Live sports broadcasts, with their typically large and highly engaged audiences, represent valuable advertising real estate, and an ad executive told the Hollywood Reporter ahead of this year’s upfronts that live sports could account for more than 40% of 2024 upfront ad spending.\n\nBut when it comes to advertising on these broadcasts via connected TV (CTV) — the industry term for streaming — the ad ecosystem is a tangled thicket of interests and limitations, which remains far from fulfilling its true potential.\n\nFor one thing, ad inventory during live streaming sports telecasts is split among several controlling parties, including the sports league, the streaming app and both national and local linear broadcasters (if an event, such as the Super Bowl, is being simulcast on linear and streaming), as well as any ad-tech firms — known as supply-side platforms, or SSPs — streamers may employ to help sell inventory.\n\nThis creates a dynamic ad buyers say can often lead to inefficient results, with commercial slots (known as pods) going unsold. As Joel Cox, co-founder and EVP of strategy and innovation at CTV ad agency Strategus, explained to VIP+, the situation is aptly compared to leaky plumbing, with ad inventory potentially seeping out at several points along the pipeline.\n\n“You may have an organization that got 75% of their ad pods filled through a direct sales arrangement but didn’t sell that other 25%,” Cox says. As a result, the remaining inventory may be sent to an SSP to sell through the automated, real-time bidding process known as programmatic advertising.\n\nThe problem is, sometimes the SSPs are also unable to fill the ad slot, leading to either “house ads” for the service you’re already watching or the familiar “We’ll be right back” streaming slates being displayed.\n\nThis situation is less common for marquee sporting events such as the Super Bowl but often occurs week to week during regular-season telecasts. And the addition of more inventory is hardly going to solve this problem, as more cooks are added to an already overcrowded kitchen.\n\n“There’s so many layers of platforms that are involved that the advertisers don’t always know who to go to, and the ad doesn’t always trickle down the way it should,” says Matt Duffy, chief marketing officer at Pixability, another CTV-focused marketing firm.\n\nThe effects of this are visible in more than just dead air. Ad inventory remains low on streaming, with linear platforms continuing to make up the bulk of sports advertisers’ budgets.\n\nAccording to a study by research firm SponsorUnited, linear TV accounted for an average of 90% of ad placements on national sports broadcasts over the past year across a range of brand categories. The category with the highest share of ads on streaming — transportation — had just 16% of its inventory placed on such platforms.\n\nAs a case study, the report also notes Prime Video had about 145 brands advertise on its “Thursday Night Football” broadcasts during the 2023-24 season, versus 220 for NBC’s Sunday night coverage and 365 for ESPN’s “Monday Night Football.”\n\nMeanwhile, the fragmentation of sports rights across the media landscape, so frustrating to consumers, can be irritating for advertisers as well — “I've heard advertisers say, ‘Are people going to even know where to find this [game]?’ ” Duffy says — and is compounded by the industry’s continued conflict over that most essential of procedures, audience measurement.\n\nFor instance, Nielsen abandoned plans (at least temporarily) to incorporate first-party data from Amazon in “Thursday Night Football” ratings following intense pushback from other networks and streamers. At the same time, those networks and streamers have backed efforts by other measurement firms to provide alternatives to Nielsen’s longstanding dominance of TV ratings.\n\nThe result is a landscape in which it can be difficult to compare ad impressions across different platforms and to know the exact size of the audience one’s ads are reaching. Given the contention over Nielsen’s data and potential alternatives, a standardized audience measurement system for streaming still seems far off.\n\nThe good news for advertisers is that progress is being made. Both Amazon and Netflix have been making concerted efforts to improve their offerings to advertisers, wooing buyers with new measurement capabilities and revised strategies. Media companies have also adopted a seemingly constant refrain of boosting programmatic inventory to help increase ad buyers’ flexibility.\n\nPerhaps in recognition of the “too many cooks” problem, meanwhile, Venu will not have its own ad-sales team, with ads being passed through via the joint owners’ respective properties, a representative confirms. (For example, ad inventory for a Venu-streaming NFL game under Fox’s rights package will be controlled by Fox.)\n\nIn short, as Pixability’s Duffy puts it, there is likely to be “a year or two of working the kinks out” before live sports advertising truly comes into its own on streaming. As sports viewership continues to shift away from linear, the industry will have no choice but to get its act together. Still, advertisers and streamers alike should brace themselves for what’s likely to be a chaotic year or two."
