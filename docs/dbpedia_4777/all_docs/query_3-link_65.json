        "text": "During boys’ transition into adolescence in the Middle School, teachers are role models whom the boys respect and admire.\n\nIn Middle School, we focus on increasing boys’ aptitude for challenge in all areas, broadening their interests, and fostering their social-emotional growth. We accomplish these goals by cultivating close relationships between teachers and students, which may be glimpsed by a high-five in Spanish class or a conversation during recess. As our teachers come to know each boy, they can draw the most effort and success from him and vary their instruction, coaching, and mentorship accordingly.\n\nOur Middle School curriculum equips boys with the tools to thrive in our challenging Upper School courses.\n\nTeachers collaborate across disciplines to present an integrated academic experience that mimics learning in the real world. They also design lessons that are active, engaging, and developmentally appropriate. As they progress through the Middle School, boys hone the skills that make them deep thinkers, proficient writers, and strong public speakers.\n\nTeacher-Coach-Mentor\n\nBoys work harder and achieve more when they respect and connect with their teachers.\n\nLandon faculty members are experts in boys’ education and know that boys will only fully open themselves to intellectual challenges and inspirational ideas when they trust that their teachers genuinely care about their well-being and success.\n\nDijon Anderson, for example, serves as the Grade 7 dean, a math teacher, as well as a soccer and basketball coach.\n\nThis is the basis of our entire educational approach—what we call teacher-coach-mentor. Our teachers get to know your son not only in the classroom but also in the chorus room, on the playing field, and in ethics discussions. See how below!\n\nPortrait of a Graduate\n\nLandon students are offered a unique experience. Our goal is that they will do something with it, that they will make a positive difference in their communities and the larger world, in ways big and small.\n\nOur goal is that they will become virtuous and well-rounded men who contribute and give back to the common good out of both a sense of personal responsibility and an awareness that much has been given to them. Our ambition is that Landon graduates might be described individually and collectively – and throughout their lives – as persons who live into these characteristics and mindsets.\n\nBecause athletics represents a great way to develop invaluable skills like resilience, teamwork, and leadership, every boy in Landon’s Middle School participates in an interscholastic or intramural sport every season.\n\nWe know that boys who learn physical wellness in Middle School are more likely to carry their healthy habits throughout their life. As boys begin to compete against other schools, our teacher-coach-mentors guide boys in their development as athletes and as young men of high character.\n\nOur work with boys around health, wellness, and fitness is found in every facet of the Middle School experience.\n\nUsing the teacher-coach-mentor model, our teachers develop deep and meaningful relationships with the boys and address larger issues like empathy, self-esteem, sportsmanship, and humility in a one-on-one capacity. We also instill in the boys that being active isn't only about athletics. It can be fun and good for you!\n\nCharacter development is central to all we do.\n\nOur ability to advance this goal is dependent on the willingness of individual community members to agree to and embrace the principles of good character outlined in our Character Pledge. This Pledge serves as an overarching standard for daily ethical conduct and includes three parts: an Honor Code, a Civility Code, and our Core Values. Each year all Landon students, teachers, and staff are asked to read and sign a document pledging themselves to these principles.\n\nStudents arrive between 7:45 and 8 a.m. to catch up with friends or talk with teachers, and classes begin at 8:05 a.m. Landon School has a rotating schedule, so his classes change from day to day. That means he will take subjects at different times each day to experience every class when he is energetic and focused.\n\nTo make sure he is ready to learn when he is in the classroom, he will never have more than two classes in a row. In addition to daily recess and lunch to break up classes, he will have study halls, school meetings, an advisory period to meet with his advisor and a small group of classmates, and a small-group discussion about ethics, service, and leadership or diversity, equity, and inclusion. Each day ends with athletics from 2:30–3:40 p.m.\n\nThe Middle School curriculum is made up of five core academic subjects: English, history, math, science, and a world language (Chinese, French, Latin, or Spanish). He will also take a studio arts class and either meet regularly with a music group (band, chorus, handbells, or strings) or take a theatrical arts class, depending on how he chooses to fulfill the Middle School’s performing arts requirement. There are also health and wellness as well as ethics classes that are part of the schedule.\n\nWe understand that every boy learns differently. If he needs extra help, his teachers and the Middle School specialist from our Center for Teaching and Learning Resources will work with you and your son to develop a plan tailored to his strengths and needs so he can improve academically, complete work on time, and develop a sense of confidence in his learning style.\n\nOur class sizes average 14 students in the Middle School, so he will get to know his classmates well. Recess, lunch, afterschool clubs, and advisory groups offer other ways to meet and bond with other students. Before opening day, he will participate in an orientation to help him get to know other new students. He will also be named to one of eight Bear Teams, made up of approximately 30 students (7–10 from each Middle School grade), and stay on that team throughout his Landon career for our field days, known as \"One Landon\" Days.\n\nThere is time set aside for academic and ethics collaborations with Holton-Arms School. Our Grade 8 students participate in a leadership summit that discusses the qualities and values of being a good leader. Our Grade 7 students and their parents attend a viewing of the documentary Like which discusses good habits around social media. Students from both schools then get together to discuss digital citizenship and the habits and behaviors that make for healthy social media use.\n\nOther areas for collaboration include our theater arts program, where students from both schools play roles in productions together, and in athletics, where our swim teams sometimes practice together, for example.\n\nOur location in Bethesda, close to Washington, D.C., provides so many field trip opportunities, and he will take both day trips and overnight trips to extend classroom learning and have fun with Bear brothers and teacher-coach-mentors.\n\nFor example, each grade takes an outdoor adventure trip in the fall where students both bond with one another and learn that they are capable of far more than you know. Form I does a day trip to Baltimore Chesapeake Bay Outward Bound School, and Form II participates in camping, hiking, and environmental education through Experience Learning in West Virginia.\n\nEach spring he will participate in our two-day Mini-Mester program, where you select a course of study that interests him and travel to locations around the D.C. area—including the U.S. Naval Academy, the National Mall, the Spy Museum, the National Air and Space Museum, and Great Falls—to learn outside the classroom. Form II students close out their time in the Middle School with a rafting trip in June.\n\nWhile community service is voluntary at Landon, we offer a wide range of opportunities to serve others, and most boys participate in at least one project. The Middle School partners with 17 organizations, and nearly 40 events are usually scheduled. He can work with Special Olympics athletes during basketball games hosted in Landon’s gym, serve meals to the homeless with Thrive DC, help organize household items for families in need at A Wider Circle, or clean up local trails for the good of the environment.\n\nEach year, members of our faculty and staff sponsor several extracurricular clubs that meet before or after the regular school day at no extra cost to families. Clubs, which usually meet once a week, change from year to year. In years past, teachers hosted Math Club, Jazz Band, Junior Bearitones (singing), Strategic Games, Debate Society, and the Multicultural Student Alliance, among others.\n\nOne highlight of the year is our Mini-Mester program, when he has a special two-day program on topics ranging from superheroes to spies. He will also bond with Bears from the Lower, Middle, and Upper Schools when they all work together in our One Landon Day program, which includes a field day, service events, and special performances. There are sporting events, school dances, and our annual Azalea Festival with games, food and fun in May.\n\nLandon teacher-coach-mentors will always be there for your student. Those who teach him in the classroom also coach him on the athletics field, advise him on the Student Council, lead after-school clubs, and direct him on the stage.\n\nIn addition to teachers, he will have a faculty advisor, a grade-level dean, a dean of students, and a guidance counselor to talk to. He will meet with his advisor several times during the week—both one on one and in groups with other students—to discuss what is happening at school, in his life, or in the world around us."
