        "text": "I take a trip each year with my family to Florida .. no one ever needed an excuse to get out of Chicago in February. It's also a weirdly great way to mark the passage of time. Two years ago, my wife was pregnant with our daughter and I felt the baby kick for the first time. I remember watching the stupidest Super Bowl ad I think I've ever seen .. that bouncing QR code for Coinbase .. but, everyone seemed pretty sure web3 was about to change the world. Tandym was still ~6 months away from booking our first account. This time last year, my daughter was just starting to crawl. Tandym had just launched our largest brand (up to that point) a few weeks prior. And then on the last day of my trip, SVB started to collapse. The internet at our rental was crap and I was basically stuck to following along on a delay. I remember thinking, \"this would be a really silly way for this to end.\" Fintech winter was most certainly upon us. This year, my daughter is running around the pool, talking up a storm, and our second kid is on the way. All the broader market wants to talk about is how AI is going to change the world. In the DTC world, brands seem to be waking up to the notion that there is more to life than ROAS .. it's way more efficient to retain and grow customers than constantly churn and find new ones (i.e., the thing we do best). Tandym is on the verge of closing multiple 9- and 10-figure brands, and the next step for us has never felt closer. I guess my point is .. the outside world can change really fast. Some days we look really smart for jumping in to this corner of fintech, other days we may look behind the trends. Through it all, we've stayed focused on our mission to deliver a next-gen branded payments platform that unlocks value for our partners and delights their customers. One thing's for sure .. it's fun to dream about what I'll be reflecting on this time next year on a sunny beach with a cold drink in my hand... üèñ üçª\n\nDumb Money is a Top 10 movie on Netflix and finally getting the recognition it deserves. I interviewed Ben Mezrich, who wrote the book the film is based on, about how he picks his projects... Every creator out there should have their own criteria for picking projects. For awesome insight from Mezrich, read my Q&A: First, I suppose it‚Äôs somewhat meta to reach out to the author of the book that inspired The Social Network about his recent book, The Antisocial Network on AN ACTUAL SOCIAL NETWORK, which inspired the movie Dumb Money, about how a dude on another social network took on Wall Street (deep breath)‚Ä¶ BUT when used as a force for good, social media can help us get in touch with people whose work we admire in record time and with near zero friction. It was through this miracle of modern connectivity that I got in touch with one of my favorite authors, Ben Mezrich. Within hours, he agreed to a short interview and we were on our way to a Books & Biceps exclusive about how he wrote Dumb Money, which is killing it on Netflix right now: Finkel: Because I‚Äôve read a ton of your books, from Bringing Down the House to The Accidental Billionaires to Bitcoin Billionaires, whenever a wild story involving money or technology breaks through and trends on social media or makes its way to national news, I think to myself, I wonder if this is book-worthy for Ben Mezrich? What are some of the hooks a story has to have for you to decide, ‚Äúyes, this is my next book‚Äù? Mezrich: For me to dive into a story, there usually needs to be something big, explosive, and revolutionary about it. Vegas, Facebook, GameStop, woolly mammoths, UFOs ‚Äì there has to be some hook you could imagine millions of people all over the world getting excited about. There also has to be some sort of ‚Äúsmart young people taking on the system‚Äù element; I love David vs Goliath stories. Usually also, I have to be able to tell the story in a single sentence: ‚Äúsix MIT kids who took Vegas for millions‚Äù or ‚Äúthe GameStop short squeeze and the amateur traders who took down Wall Street‚Äù both fit the bill! When you zero in on a story like your new book, how much research into things like GameStop, WallStreetBets and stuff like Short Squeezes do you have to do before you know it‚Äôs going to be compelling enough for a book? Do you ever start the research on a project and bail because after looking under the hood it‚Äôs not that great/interesting/entertaining? Yes, I have to do tons of research and legwork. I‚Äôm not really an expert in anything until I write about it ‚Äì so I spend a lot of time on the phone with the main characters learning everything I can. I‚Äôve developed a really good spidey-sense at this point so... You can read the full article here: https://lnkd.in/es4aERyS --- PS.
