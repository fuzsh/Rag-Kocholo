        "text": "Old Thread and me being a HUGE Duffey fan, I'll comment-above Scotti Adams is correct on the recordings John used his \"Duck\" There is a you tube video from a fest posted recently and John is playing the Duck and it sounds mighty fine!\n\nAs far as John's Duck's \"he made two\" there was his-a friend owns it as far as I know-I will not give his name!! My Uncle Dick has had John's redone F-7 convert that John did and recorded with in the early 60's-its shown in many old photos and on the record \"On the Road and More\" its hanging on a fence in the background. That's a killer! Many know Uncle Dick Smith has this so I don't mind sharing. Uncle Dick got this in 1968 from a guy who sometimes posts here-Uncle Dick told me he traded 2 real fancy pre 1910 F-4's for it if I remember correctly \"great score right!?\n\nThe other Duck John made for his friend Akira as Akira had to sell his old Gibby A to come back to the states! On YouTube there is a 4 part Doc. that Akira talks about it and John's other mandolins! Akira also has the famed F-12 that John had/redone in 68 I believe, then it was stolen so then the Duck came along and John got the 12 back a few years later and used until the end!\n\nThere is another Duffey F-5 out there, it is pictured on the first Folkway record/CD I believe in the white \"John was probably redoing it at the time as the finish was stripped off, I believe it was a 50's F-5 as it had a large peg head of that time frame!\" I also know who has that but they have passed away so their family may have it? I know John cut the huge peg head down and refinished it and I'm sure like with all of John's reworked mandolins he gave it a deep neck set! I know that works as it puts more down pressure on the top hence more volume and better tone-think on how violins are for a moment right? I won't drop that name either because well I want it-Lol!!\n\nAkira told me he's seen a few Duck copies from around the world but all were rather crude and not real good sounding! I'm sure if someone had the time and specs they're may be a small niche market for these Ducks-I mean who wouldn't want a Duffey Duck clone? If your a fan of John's why not, they sure are a complete odd ball mandolin that's different from the 100's of thousand A and F models right!\n\nThere is one guy who made only 2 Ducks and there is a demo on YouTube of him showing it off and playing it and all I can say is WoW! Look it up-type in Duffey Duck mandolin and ya can't miss it! He nailed it as that one sounds and looks amazing! That one sold to someone who wants to also remain anonymous for now! But yesterday I had an interesting phone call with the owner of the 2nd and only other one that was built \"it took me a lot of legwork/computer work to find this gentleman!\" and his looks awesome and sounds as great as the first one, he sent me many photos and a video demo-I won't mention his name either as more or less I will be getting that Duck in the future as we came to an understanding after talking for an hour or so about Big John and his mandolins and he respects the fact that I would love and play the Duck and not sell it for a fast buck to anyone as he knows I'm a huge Duffey fan and have been ever since I got my first mix tape back in the early 90's my Dad made and sent me off some old records and yep it was John's Duck on those recordings! He's a really nice and great guy, we had a lot of laughs and stories! It was great meeting and talking with him about his Duffey stories and he remembers seeing my Uncles play back in the early 70's and such. I just have to come up with the $ or the guitar he wants! So ya'll wish me luck as yep I don't need it but I sure would love and honor having that Duck!"
