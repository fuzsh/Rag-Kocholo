        "text": "Abstract\n\nReliable execution of behaviors requires that brain circuits correct for variations in neuronal dynamics. Genetic perturbation of the majority of excitatory neurons in a brain region involved in song production in adult songbirds with stereotypical songs triggered severe degradation of their songs. The song fully recovered within two weeks, and substantial improvement occurred even when animals were prevented from singing during the recovery period, indicating that offline mechanisms enable recovery in an unsupervised manner. Song restoration was accompanied by increased excitatory synaptic inputs to unmanipulated neurons in the same region. A model inspired by the behavioral and electrophysiological findings suggests that a combination of unsupervised single-cell and population-level homeostatic plasticity rules can support the observed functional restoration after large-scale disruption of networks implementing sequential dynamics. In the model the sequence is restored through a parallel homeostatic process, rather than regrown serially, and predicts that sequences should recover in a saltatory fashion. Correspondingly, we observed such recovery in the songs of manipulated animals, with syllables that rapidly alternate between abnormal and normal durations from rendition to rendition until eventually they permanently settled into their original length. These observations indicate the existence of cellular and systems-level restorative mechanisms that ensure behavioral resilience.\n\nAnimal survival and reproduction requires reliable execution of behaviors. However, neuronal representations change over time, as a consequence of natural drift, or due to neuronal perturbations caused by trauma, disease, or aging1,2. What are the mechanisms that allow brains to maintain reliable behaviors over long periods of time or after neuronal loss? To investigate this question, we studied the zebra finch, a songbird that after learning a song as juveniles, produces stereotypical renditions of the song with minimal variability over several years. Songbirds have a series of brain nuclei dedicated for song learning and production called the song system3. HVC is the premotor nucleus in the song system that projects to the motor nucleus RA (robust nucleus of the arcopallium)4, involved in song production3. Previous experiments have shown that complete ablation of HVC abolishes song production3, but localized, partial lesions of HVC cause song degradation followed by recovery after different amounts of time5–7, suggesting that the song circuit is somewhat resilient. However, the precise behavioral, circuit and cellular level dynamics responsible for this resilience remain unknown. To investigate this question, we used genetic methods to selectively manipulate the activity of projection neurons in the HVC of adult finches and quantified the changes in the song as it degraded and recovered. In addition, we investigated the electrophysiological changes that occurred in this brain circuit after the genetic perturbation and created a data-inspired model to explore the cellular mechanisms underlying the observed behavioral and electrophysiological findings.\n\nHVC projection neurons fire in an extremely sparse and precise manner when birds sing8,9. To explore how singing may be affected by disrupting the precise firing of these neurons, we expressed an ion channel to alter their electrical properties. Towards this goal, we bilaterally injected into both HVCs lentiviral vectors (LVs. Fig. 1a), which have been shown to selectively infect HVC projection neurons10,11 (Extended Data Fig. 1). To alter the electrical properties of HVC neurons, the LVs carried NaChBac, a bacterial voltage gated Na+ channel12. NaChBac expression in neurons perturbs their activity due to two features13–15: first, NaChBac is activated at membrane potentials in which the vertebrate Na+ channels are inactive; second, whereas the vertebrate Na+ channel depolarizations are several ms long, those of NaChBac expressing neurons last up to >1 s. The NaChBac transgene carried by the LVs contains the sequence of NaChBac fused in frame to GFP, which allows for visual identification of the infected neurons (Extended Data Fig. 1). Whole-cell patch clamp recording of HVC neurons in brain slices confirmed that GFP+ neurons displayed the characteristic NaChBac currents (Fig. 1c and Extended Data 2a-c).\n\nFor the first 2-3 days after viral injection there were no changes in the songs. Normal songs consist of repetitions of a so-called motif, which is made up of 3 to 7 syllables, depending on the individual. In unperturbed zebra finches, the acoustical structure of the syllables, the number of syllables per motif, and the duration of each motif are highly stereotypical, with minimal variations between renditions, even across months. In contrast, by 5 days after NaChBac injection the songs became highly irregular and bore no resemblance to their original songs.\n\nTo visualize the dynamics of the changes in these perturbed songs, we used Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), a non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithm, to project the high-dimensional acoustic representation of hundreds of songs onto a 2D plane (see Methods and Fig. 1b)16–18. NaChBac delivery caused strong acoustic and temporal degradation across all syllables and greatly increased the variance between song renditions, which made it difficult to identify motifs (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Audio 1-3). However, at approximately 7 days post-injection (dpi) the song started to recover, and gradually regained structure. By 14 dpi, the songs of NaChBac animals were highly similar to their original songs and remained so for several months. To investigate how NaChBac expression caused song degradation, we performed whole-cell patch clamp recordings. As early as 48 hours after injection, NaChBac+ RA-projecting (HVC(RA)) neurons displayed the characteristic NaChBac current and abnormal long depolarizations. However, starting at 4 dpi, at the onset of song degradation, NaChBac+ HVC(RA) neurons had a substantial increase in inhibitory synaptic inputs leading to their silencing (Extended Data Fig. 3), as observed before in the mammalian brain13,15,19. These synaptic changes were also present at >25 dpi after the song had recovered. Thus, we hypothesize that the degradation of the song after NaChBac injection is primarily due to the eventual silencing of a large fraction of HVC projection neurons.\n\nTo investigate whether directly silencing HVC projection neurons would be sufficient to degrade the song, we delivered a LV carrying the light chain of tetanus toxin (TeNT). TeNT is an enzyme that cleaves synaptobrevin, a protein essential for the release of neurotransmitters. Thus, expression of TeNT in a neuron does not alter its electrical activity, but it abolishes its ability to communicate with its postsynaptic targets20. Paired whole-cell patch clamp recordings in brain slices showed that expression of TeNT in HVC(RA) projection neurons abolished their excitatory drive onto inhibitory neurons in HVC at all times, both during song degradation, and after recovery, indicating the TeNT permanently muted the projection neurons (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 2d-f).\n\nInjection of LV-TeNT into HVC caused song deterioration and recovery with an overall similar pattern to that described for LV-NaChBac (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Audio 4-6), although songs started to degrade faster with TeNT (as early as 1 dpi). Lentiviral expression starts at ∼ 24 hours, TeNT is a powerful toxin, and a handful of TeNT molecules is sufficient to mute a neuron, thus this likely accounts for its rapid action. To investigate the dynamics of song changes caused by these genetic perturbations, we quantified multiple acoustic features of syllables of birds receiving either LV-TeNT or LV-NaChBac21. In both types of perturbation, degraded songs consist of shorter (Fig. 2a), weaker (Fig. 2b), and noisier (Fig. 2c) syllables than those of the original songs. Note, we use the term ‘syllable’ to refer to any continuous song segment in the degraded song, even if they are not stereotypical, and they bear little or no resemblance to the original syllables. We measured the acoustic distortion of songs by calculating the distance of disordered syllables to the original (pre-perturbation) syllables, normalized to the maxima, in a high dimensional acoustic space derived from the spectrograms (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 4. see also Methods) and plotted the trajectories of each syllable to show the timeline of dynamics of song degradation and recovery (Fig. 2e). We found that, both for LV-TeNT and LV-NaChBac animals, the acoustic distance to all original syllables increased drastically after the virus injection, but the onset and peak distortion occur earlier for LV-TeNT (3.53 ± 0.39 dpi) than for LV-NaChBac animals (6.25 ±0.66 dpi. Fig. 2e). Although the peak distortion happens later for NaChBac the time to recovery was comparable for the two types of manipulations (13.71 ± 0.72 vs 14.80 ± 1.90 dpi. Fig. 2e). The recovered song was very close to the original, but some localized aspects of the song changed permanently, including fine-scale acoustical structure, and loss of some syllables (Fig. 1d,f).\n\nWe also measured the rendition-to-rendition syllable variability across days (See Methods). For both NaChBac and TeNT, the peak of variability in syllable renditions occurred at around 10 dpi (Fig. 2f), approximately 4-6 days after the acoustic features of the songs were maximally degraded (Fig. 2e). By 20-25 dpi, the acoustic features were fully recovered, and the syllable variability returned to the pre-perturbation level (Fig. 2f). Importantly, the degradation of song was not due to toxicity or mechanical lesion, because no behavioral change was observed when the same amount of viral vector expressing either GFP or a dead-pore NaChBac was injected (Extended Data Fig. 5. N = 4). Finally, song recovery was not due to the restoration of normal firing activity in the NaChBac+ HVC(RA)neurons, because they still had the same amount of NaChBac current (Extended Data Fig. 2a-c) and highly increased inhibitory synaptic input at >25 dpi, 10 days after the song had recovered (Extended Data Fig. 3). Similarly, the muting of HVC(RA) neurons by LV-TeNT also persisted at >25 dpi, even after the song had recovered (Extended Data Fig. 2a-c). The similar behavioral outcomes after NaChBac and TeNT delivery suggests that the mechanisms by which these different genetic manipulations caused song degradation were due to the functional loss of a large percentage of HVC projection neurons, by direct muting caused by TeNT,or by homeostatic silencing in response to NaChBac.\n\nIs the process of song recovery after HVC perturbation similar to the way young animals learn the song? Juvenile finches listen to the song of their fathers, memorize it, and attempt to copy it by continuous trial and error over 2-3 months and tens of thousands of practice renditions. The juvenile song is initially unstructured, until it eventually becomes a faithful copy of the father’s song, and it “crystallizes” into a stable motif with minimal variability22. To investigate if song recovery after HVC perturbations also required practice, we prevented LV-TeNT animals from singing during the two-week period when the recovery usually occurs, and after this time, they were allowed to sing freely (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 6). Surprisingly, the very first song renditions sung on the first day after prevention were already highly similar to the original pre-perturbation song (Fig. 3b-g). After singing a few dozens of renditions within the same day, the songs recovered to the same degree as in animals that had sung thousands of renditions for two weeks after viral injections. These observations indicate that much of the song restoration after perturbation could occur without practice and suggest that offline mechanisms could enable recovery in an unsupervised manner.\n\nWhat are the cellular mechanisms by which the brain restores the precise execution of the song after such drastic perturbations? Both LV manipulations (NaChBac and TeNT) reduced the number of functioning HVC projection neurons. We hypothesized that the recovery may depend on changes among other neurons that were not genetically perturbed (“unmanipulated neurons”) within the same HVC. We performed whole-cell recordings to measure the synaptic and intrinsic properties of unmanipulated (GFP-negative) HVC(RA) neurons after LV-TeNT. These neurons showed no change in their intrinsic excitability or inhibitory synaptic inputs (Extended Data Fig. 7). However, they recruited a substantially higher level of excitatory synaptic inputs than neurons in unperturbed animals, as revealed by a much higher frequency of mEPSC (193.0 ± 31.5 %. Fig. 4a-c), suggesting that presynaptic mechanisms, such as formation of new synapses, activation of silent synapses, or strengthening of preexisting synapses might be responsible for these changes. Similar synaptic changes were observed in manipulated (TeNT+) neurons as well; however, because TeNT irreversibly muted these cells, it is unlikely that synaptic changes in the manipulated cells contributed to the recovery. To investigate whether these synaptic changes are caused by local perturbation of neuronal activity within the same region, we injected the virus unilaterally just in one HVC. We detected synaptic changes in unmanipulated neurons in the injected hemisphere, but not in the contralateral (unmanipulated) hemisphere (Extended Data Fig. 8a,b). This suggests that the observed synaptic changes are induced by local phenomena restricted to the HVC that was perturbed.\n\nThe excitatory inputs received by HVC inhibitory neurons in LV-TeNT animals were initially greatly reduced, consistent with a reduction of the synaptic output from the projection cells expressing TeNT. Dual whole-cell recordings between HVC(RA) projection neurons and interneurons indicated that expression of TeNT leads to permanent muting of the infected cells (Extended Data Fig. 2). However, these excitatory inputs to inhibitory neurons eventually recovered to a level that was indistinguishable from control animals (Extended Data Fig. 8c,d), suggesting that the recovery of the inhibitory tone was due to changes in unmanipulated neurons. Thus, our findings show that alongside song degradation and following recovery, the HVC network is drastically restructured.\n\nWe used modeling to explore how synaptic plasticity mechanisms could contribute to unsupervised recovery of network activity after perturbation and to account for the observed synaptic changes. Song recovery in animals that were prevented from singing suggests that plasticity mechanisms are initially largely driven locally within HVC rather than by behavioral feedback from practice. We sought to determine which mechanisms are consistent with restoration of the sequence as well as recapitulation of our physiological findings on synaptic strength changes. We modeled HVC as an excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) network, with HVC(RA) neurons connected to each other in a feedforward, polysynchronous chain and recurrently connected to HVC(INT) neurons (Fig. 4d)9,23,24. We then inactivated varying fractions of the HVC(RA) population (Fig. 4d) to mimic the silencing of neurons caused by TeNT expression. To explore mechanisms that may enable recovery, we first implemented spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) between excitatory neurons (E→E), which is integral to many models of sequence self-organization23,25–27. In addition, implementing STDP between excitatory and inhibitory neurons (E→I) enabled the rebound of input to inhibitory neurons observed in our experiments. However, we found that STDP alone did not reliably restore sequential activity (Extended Data Fig. 9), as the perturbed chain lacks activity in both pre- and postsynaptic neurons required to strengthen synapses, and further did not produce the overshoot in excitatory connectivity into HVC(RA) neurons observed by our electrophysiological measurements.\n\nAs STDP alone was insufficient to restore the sequential dynamics in our model of HVC, we next considered whether cell-autonomous homeostatic mechanisms based on changes on either intrinsic excitability or synaptic inputs may enable recovery of the network. Our recordings revealed that unmanipulated HVC(RA) neurons did not change their intrinsic excitability post-perturbation (Extended Data Fig. 7), but they displayed changes in their synaptic inputs. Thus, we added a cell-autonomous homeostatic rule into our model, based on scaling the excitatory synaptic inputs to individual excitatory neurons to maintain their firing rates (Fig. 4e). The implementation of this rule is consistent with reports that found activity-dependent synaptic homeostasis in other circuits with sequential dynamics28. We found that adding this form of cell-autonomous synaptic homeostasis in excitatory neurons reliably restored sequential network activity (Fig. 4f,g). However, in models employing STDP alone or both STDP and cell-autonomous synaptic homeostasis, the recovered HVC outputs were reduced in proportion to the percentage of neurons inactivated, thereby drastically weakening the drive to downstream regions (Fig. 4h). Additionally, these models did not reproduce the overshoot in excitatory synaptic input to unmanipulated excitatory neurons as revealed by our experiments (Fig. 4c,g).\n\nOne potential mechanism by which HVC might restore its output to downstream targets is the recruitment of neurons that initially do not participate in the sequential dynamics, defined here as “silent” neurons (Fig. 4i). Multiple experiments have indicated that a large fraction of HVC(RA) neurons do not fire during song, suggesting a possible redundant role8,29,30. We hypothesized that the presence of such silent neurons--assumed to be HVC(RA) neurons connected within the network, but whose inputs are subthreshold--might provide additional resilience by allowing the sequential dynamics to be partially carried by newly recruited HVC neurons when active constituents of the network fail. While such shifts in representation could be due to the loss of inhibition onto silent cells following the loss of excitatory neurons, this picture of recovery is inconsistent with our experiments in that it does not require the large increase in the excitatory inputs onto HVC(RA) neurons that we observed in our recordings. We therefore hypothesized that silent neurons may be recruited into the sequence through a form of population homeostasis, for which there is an emerging body of support31–34. In our model, we implemented one potential mechanism by which such population homeostasis can be achieved: synaptic scaling based on the activity-dependent release of secreted factors (Fig. 4j), such as BDNF and TNFα, which have been shown to regulate local network activity in a non-cell-autonomous manner35–38. While local population homeostasis alone enabled reliable recovery of sequences (Extended Data Fig. 10), the recruitment of previously silent neurons enabled the most complete recovery consistent with our experiments in that the total output of the network was restored and E→E synaptic inputs increased by ∼100% (Fig. 4k-m). Furthermore, the dynamics of the sequence in terms of numbers of participating neurons and their temporal resolution most closely resembles the pre-perturbation state. Finally, the recruitment of silent neurons (either mature cells already present or potentially new neurons produced during adult neurogenesis7) may initially add noise to song production (Fig. 4k), consistent with the observation of an increase in the song’s variability, peaking at ∼10 dpi, approximately 4-6 days after the acoustic features of the songs were maximally degraded (Fig. 2f).\n\nWe use modeling, beginning from standard assumed architectures for HVC, to explore the potential roles of different plasticity rules and to seek conditions that lead to agreement with experimental data. The core of our model is that the sequence is more reliably restored through a parallel homeostatic process, in contrast to serial regrowth through a timing-dependent process (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 9). A prediction of the model is that the sequence should recover in an abrupt fashion: all links are repaired simultaneously, so that by the time any broken link is restored, all other links tend to have recovered (Fig. 5b-d). Correspondingly, we found many examples of such saltatory recovery in the song, whereby syllables show a bimodal temporal distribution (Fig. 5e-h), with syllables rapidly alternating between two durations from rendition to rendition until eventually they permanently recover their original duration. Syllables with these bimodal temporal distributions are only present in renditions that include song segments that bear acoustic resemblance to the original syllables. This suggests the existence of a remaining chain “skeleton” that supports production of the correct syllable on occasional renditions until the sequence’s strength fully recovers. A further implication of these observations and the recovery set out by the model is that the skeleton can act as a scaffold upon which the homeostatic plasticity can rebuild the dynamics in an unsupervised manner. As this redundancy can exist very ‘locally’ in the chain (i.e. only between adjacent links) it is still consistent with an extremely sparse network, and may be a key contributor to resilience in HVC.\n\nThe precise recovery of a complex learned behavior from extensive perturbations to a brain region essential for its production indicates the presence of cellular and systems-level restorative mechanisms that operate locally and in an “offline”, partially unsupervised manner. Song restoration occurred even when animals were prevented from singing during the recovery period, which indicates that the restoration mechanisms were mostly guided by neuronal activity without any information regarding how these cellular changes may improve behavior. Song recovery was accompanied by increased excitatory synaptic inputs to unmanipulated neurons within the same brain region. Based on these findings we modeled sequential dynamics to test how plasticity mechanisms can support this restoration. The inclusion of population-level homeostasis in the model confers a unique form of resilience as it enables the recruitment of HVC(RA) neurons that did not initially participate in song dynamics, providing a potential role for these inactive cells; neither STDP nor single-cell homeostasis can recruit these silent neurons into the active dynamics. The model predicts that the set of HVC(RA) projection neurons active in song would shift substantially following perturbation. Such population-level activity regulation could support naturally occurring “representational drift”, which has been observed in several brain regions wherein the qualitative nature of the sequential dynamics is preserved but the neurons that participate in the dynamics change39–43, potentially increasing circuit robustness44,45. Population-level homeostasis accounts for the experimentally observed increase in excitatory synaptic inputs to unmanipulated excitatory neurons as the song recovers. The observed upregulation of synaptic strength may have occurred through a random global process that could be later refined through activity-dependent plasticity. Instead, we find that the excitatory weight changes remain after the song has fully recovered in the experiment, suggesting, consistent with our modeling, that these changes represent a persistent network reorganization critical to the recovery process. Finally, the model recapitulated the experimental finding that restoration of sequential firing can happen offline (without feedback from practice) to result in song recovery, pointing to a largely unsupervised, circuit-level reorganization. We hypothesize that the potential for self-organized restoration of sequential dynamics may be key to enable such circuit mechanisms to support resilient behavior.\n\nAuthor contributions\n\nAll authors contributed to the conceptualization, methodology, and writing of the paper.\n\nInvestigation - Experiments: BW, ZT, SW, TV, CL\n\nInvestigation - Computational: AD, DB\n\nVisualization: BW, ZT, AD, DB\n\nFunding acquisition & Supervision: AF, CL\n\nCompeting interests\n\nAuthors declare that they have no competing interests."
