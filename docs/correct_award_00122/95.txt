Article

Verner von Heidenstam was a Swedish poet and prosaist whose name is closely associated with modern Swedish nationalism. He is counted among the most influential advocates of the conservative movement throughout early Swedish modernism and was also attacked by Strindberg during the famous Strindberg Feud. The national romantic tendencies in his literary works, as well as their idealistic historicism, stand in sharp contrast to the realistic, socio-critical slogans of the 1880s. As of 1912, Heidenstam was a member of the Swedish Academy, and in 1916 he received the Nobel Prize in Literature. In 1910 he acquired the manor Övralid in the south of Sweden where he died in 1940.
