        "text": "The stately proceedings of the Nobel Prize for Literature were briefly enlivened this year when its own website suddenly declared that the prize had gone to the Serbian nationalist writer Dobrica Cosic. As the first President of Serbia, the man who declared in 1993 that “outside forces” were determined to subordinate “the Serbian people to Muslim hegemony,” Mr Cosic was always going to be an unlikely winner. Happily, the hoax, or error, was quickly corrected, and a new, much more Nobel-ish sort of winner declared.\n\nFor the ninth time in the Nobel Prizes’ 110 years, the Swedish Academy has decided to give it to a Swedish writer, Tomas Transtromer. He joins those other mighty masters of world literature, Bjornsterne Bjornson, Selma agerlof, Verner von Heidenstam, Erik Axel Karlfeldt, Par Lagerkvist, Nelly Sachs, Eyvind Johnson, Harry Martinson.\n\nThese Swedish writers, too, were thought at the time to stand in the company of the giants of world literature. Time has shown every single Swedish winner of the prize to be “a little phenomenon of no interest” outside their own country, as onedisgruntled juror described William Golding in the year he won. What will it do for this popular Stockholm favourite?\n\nTomas Transtromer was by profession a psychologist who worked with criminals, drug addicts and in prisons. He published small amounts of poetry over the years, much of which reflects an interest in nature and in a kind of imagistic approach to the natural world. In 1990, Transtromer suffered a major stroke which made it impossible for him to speak in public. However, he has gone on writing and indeed has published an autobiography. His work is well-known among admirers of poetry worldwide, and has been translated into dozens of languages.\n\nThose keen to sample his work will find an easily available Collected Poetry in English, including much nature poetry. Here is a haiku, which perhaps has more of a swing to it in Swedish: “My happiness swelled/and the frogs sang in the bogs/of Pomerania.”"
