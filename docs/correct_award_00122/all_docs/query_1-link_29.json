        "text": "August 29, 2018\n\nBeware of nationalism!\n\nReposted in protest against the nationalist anger we still see in Europe, fuelled by the pompous ideas that Heidenstam stood for. Sadly, our present-day Heidenstams are not as eloquent when they march the streets to show their hatred for people of a different look or accent, based on an idea of collective rather than individual identity.\n\nI feel shame today. Shame! 101 years after this nationalist author received the Nobel Prize in Literature for his romanticised ideal of Nordic heroic (fictional!) history, we see where blind patriotism can lead. Whether Heidenstam later became a Nazi or not (which depends on how you interpret his extremely German-friendly comments in the 1920s and 1930s), he definitely is a symbol for the \"values\" of the contemporary extreme right-wing group that today demonstrates its hatred for the world outside the blonde, blue-eyed, Swedish, Christian, nationalist, male, militaristic, exclusive little club that they think will make them strong without having to use their brains or hearts at all - by simply excluding everything they fear or do not understand.\n\nToday, Swedish Neonazis march through central Gothenburg in conjunction with the annual Bokmässan - Sweden's biggest book fair. Since last year, their newspaper Nya Tider is allowed to present their hate propaganda inside the fair itself, leading to hundreds of international authors withdrawing their participation, and to condemnation by European cultural institutions such as the Cervantes and the Goethe Institute, as well as the Institut Francais.\n\nOne of my favourite candidates for this (and last!) year's Nobel, Ngugi Wa Thiong'o, announced his withdrawal early on:\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/books/201...\n\nIf I had planned to attend, I would now happily ignore the fair to join the counter-demonstrations in the streets of Gothenburg instead. Stuck as I am in Stockholm, I will only say this:\n\nBeware of romantic glorification of a nation - it is often the first sign of fascism. Why would Sweden need heroes? Our regular life in peaceful, tolerant, secular, democratic spirit is so much more worth celebrating!\n\nCheers to authors who do not need to write with pathos of Swedishness, cheers to authors who dare to use their \"freedom of speech\" to speak up against fascism.\n\nCheers to those who do not indulge in retro-nostalgic delusions!\n\nThe stars in the rating stand for Heidenstam's ability to put Swedish words together to an artistic, if somewhat bombastic and historically inaccurate composition. I am taking away three stars because I am angry today. Angry with the mindset he introduced and cultivated in the country I happened to be born into.\n\nI am not proud of it. It would be ridiculous to be proud of such a random fact. Would I be proud of my\"Nordic heritage\" if I were born with another passport? No! Therefore it is not a human value at all. It is a superficial distinction like so many others.\n\nI am ashamed of my passport today. Bear with us! This is Charlottesville.\n\nChoose sides. There is no middle between tearing down walls or building them.\n\nAugust 25, 2010\n\nI came across this book in the following way: I stole it. Decades ago, back in my impetuous youth, I chose this book at random from a bookshelf and put it into my backpack. I kept it all this time, packing and unpacking it into cardboard boxes each time we moved, but I never once cracked it open.\n\nMy wife and I recently decided that we simply have too many books. A lot of them we've never even read. For unread books, our new rule is simple: either read it right now and decide it's worth keeping or take it to the thrift store. Accordingly, I sat down with Mr. Heidenstam's volume and finally cracked it open, fully expecting to read the first fifty pages or so and to find, as with most books, that it was too poorly written to continue.\n\nImagine my surprise, then, to find myself almost instantly transported into the magical and violent world of Swedish Vikings and chieftains of the Middle Ages. Written in a simple, almost matter-of-fact style, the prose stays out of the way of the shimmering images being conveyed to the reader's mind: chests full of gold, huts thick with campfire smoke, dwarves dancing on barren shores, bodies of dogs hanging from trees, twisting in the wind of the night, sacrifices to the old gods.\n\nMr. Von Heidenstam does more, however, than to simply weave a strange and fascinating story out of these wonderful images. He has a real taste for character, and the characters are the subject matter and stars of the book. From the first pages, when the curtain opens on a Viking ship returning home after years of plundering, and the members of the crew, as was the custom, are allowed to speak (and speak loudly) in criticism of their captain for that one time only, we are introduced to the complexity and strangeness of the main character of the first book, Folke Filbyter.\n\nThere are larger themes here as well. The book is divided into two parts, one taking place a few hundred years after the other. But the subject matter of both books is the new Christian influence and way of thinking as it seems to invade, like some kind of virus, the warlike and almost anarchic Viking culture. An example of what I mean by warlike: when the book begins, the rule of the land is that if you take something by force, it's yours, if you are caught stealing something, you must give back half, and if you beg for something, you are put to death.\n\nMr. Von Heidenstam examines this theme, of the growing Christian influence, in all its real complexity, and he doesn't shy away from the violence involved, or the paradoxes inherent therein. He furthermore is somehow able to use the particular personalities of the characters as symbols which mirror the larger conflicts of theme which are taking place. I am tempted to give examples, but any of them would spoil the effect when these actual events are read in the novel.\n\nWithout spoiling anything I will at least note that the characters of the two brothers, in the second part of the book, seem to me to represent two conflicting and equally powerful ways of living one's life and that these two viewpoints have often conflicted in the history of the church.\n\nFinally, I have to mention Mr. Von Heidenstam's excellent sense of pacing. He spends just the right amount of time on each aspect of the story, and he seems to have a great feel for when to switch the action to some other location. Each scene feels complete and whole, yet the story continues to move forward in its weird way. Managed correctly, as in this novel, the way in which an author paces his work can add levels of depth far deeper than the events described might otherwise contain. It is the difference between music sung a cappella versus a song sung while playing a guitar. The words are the same, but the feeling (in most cases) is layered and deeper.\n\nAll in all, a great book, and one I will surely read again."
