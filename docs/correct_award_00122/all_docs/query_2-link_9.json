        "text": "(1859–1940). The poet and prose writer Verner von Heidenstam led the literary reaction to the naturalist movement in Sweden, calling for a renaissance of the literature of fantasy, beauty, and national themes. He won the Nobel prize for literature in 1916.\n\nCarl Gustav Verner von Heidenstam was born on July 6, 1859, in Olshammar, Sweden, but ill health forced him to spend most of his youth in the central and eastern Mediterranean countries. His first book of poems, Vallfart och vandringsår (1888; Pilgrimage and Wander Years), full of the fables of the southern lands and the philosophy of the East, was an immediate success with the Swedish public. With his essay “Renässans” (1889) he first voiced his opposition to naturalism and the realistic literary program that had been rather short-lived in Sweden."
