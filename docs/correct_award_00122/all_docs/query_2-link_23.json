        "text": "September 16, 2022\n\nRepeating the failures of Poltava\n\n#vernervonheidenstam never developed much of a following outside of Scandinavia though his poem and novels were influenced by decades of travel and venturing. As the winner of the #1916 #nobelprizeforliterature his achievement was so glaringly overlooked as #worldwarI was raging in Europe and, though still handing out #nobels , the ceremonies were cancelled as it would have been a little treacherous traipsing across Europe with all that mustard gas floating around. So, #heidenstam got the trophy and the cash but no ceremony during which he was recognized.\n\nThe #nobellibrary published a few of his numerous poems in this collection but most poignant and, at present, timely offering was Part One of #thecharlesmen , his most noted novel, written in a modern style but rich in detail of the #greatnorthernwar , launched in 1700 by #charlesxii of the #swedishempire against #peteri and the #russianempire . This war and the crushing of Swedish imperial ambitons is what transformed Russia #czarpeter into #peterthegreat and #russia on the road to becoming a #superpower. Interestingly, one of the most important battles was fought at #poltava in what is now #ukraine where #cossacks and #tatars of the #crimea fought for Russia against Sweden. 300 years later, their descendents now fight again #putin and Russia in this region now called the #donbas where #ukrainian forces just pushed the Russians out of #kharkiv which is just a few miles from #poltava . I have made a goal to revisit this for the rest of the story as it is extremely well told and engaging. Incidentally, I had studied this war as it is a background story of my #thatchertheunauthorizedbiographyofblackbeardthepirate which linked Russia and Peter.\n\n#readtheworld #readtheworldchallenge #globalreadingchallenge #nobelprizereadingchallenge #swedishliterature"
