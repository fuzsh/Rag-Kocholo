This unique work has been called a poem in prose and also a hymn on the beauty of Sweden's destruction under King Charles XII. Verner von Heidenstam (1859-1940) was the 1916 Nobel Laureate in Literature in recognition of his significance as the leading representative of a new era in Swedish literature.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1410204766/?tag=2022091-20\n\nThe soothsayer\n\n(Leopold Classic Library is delighted to publish this clas...)\n\nLeopold Classic Library is delighted to publish this classic book as part of our extensive collection. As part of our on-going commitment to delivering value to the reader, we have also provided you with a link to a website, where you may download a digital version of this work for free. Many of the books in our collection have been out of print for decades, and therefore have not been accessible to the general public. Whilst the books in this collection have not been hand curated, an aim of our publishing program is to facilitate rapid access to this vast reservoir of literature. As a result of this book being first published many decades ago, it may have occasional imperfections. These imperfections may include poor picture quality, blurred or missing text. While some of these imperfections may have appeared in the original work, others may have resulted from the scanning process that has been applied. However, our view is that this is a significant literary work, which deserves to be brought back into print after many decades. While some publishers have applied optical character recognition (OCR), this approach has its own drawbacks, which include formatting errors, misspelt words, or the presence of inappropriate characters. Our philosophy has been guided by a desire to provide the reader with an experience that is as close as possible to ownership of the original work. We hope that you will enjoy this wonderful classic book, and that the occasional imperfection that it might contain will not detract from the experience.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015WCNLYC/?tag=2022091-20"
