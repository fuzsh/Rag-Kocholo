        "text": "LiU involved in a megastudy on climate behaviour\n\nWhat is the best way to make people behave in a more climate-friendly way? Researchers at Linköping University and Karolinska Institutet have contributed to a worldwide study on this topic.\n\nNerve damage from cancer treatment can be predicted\n\nMany women treated for breast cancer using taxanes, a type of cytostatic drug, often experience side effects in the nervous system. Researchers at LiU have developed a tool that can predict the risk level for each individual.\n\nHer mission is difficult – but fun and achievable\n\nWe are in the midst of a tough transition towards more sustainable development. This requires innovation and knowledge, says Marie Trogstam, a LiU alumna who is now head of sustainability and infrastructure at the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise.\n\nA liver biopsy may predict spread of pancreatic cancer\n\nMicroscopic changes in the liver can be used to predict spread of pancreatic cancer. The discovery may provide new ways of predicting the course of the disease and preventing pancreatic cancer from spreading to other organs.\n\nShe wants to make robots behave better\n\nResearcher Hannah Pelikan believes that we will see increased conflicts between humans and robots in the future. In her research, she films everyday encounters between humans and machines to see what happens.\n\nInternational collaboration lays the foundation for AI for materials\n\nAI is accelerating the development of new materials. Large-scale use and exchange of data on materials is facilitated by a broad international standard. A major international collaboration now presents an extended version of the OPTIMADE standard.\n\nFrom sketches to a robot with artificial intelligence\n\nHow do you develop a product with as little human involvement as possible? LiU students built a robot using generative artificial intelligence.\n\nMore effective cancer treatment with iontronic pump\n\nWhen low doses of cancer drugs are administered continuously near malignant brain tumours using so-called iontronic technology, cancer cell growth drastically decreases. This is demonstrated in experiments with bird embryos.\n\nElectronic medicine – at the intersection of technology and medicine\n\nSwedish researchers have developed a gel that can form a soft electrode capable of conducting electricity. In the long term, they aim to connect electronics to biological tissue, such as the brain.\n\nAgreement signed – supercomputer Arrhenius to Linköping\n\nThe hosting agreement between NAISS at LiU and EuroHPC JU has been signed.

This autumn, it will be upgraded thanks to a donation of SEK 125 million from the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation.\n\nMaking remanufacturing profitable\n\nReturning end-of-life products to as-new condition is called remanufacturing. For more industrial companies to take an interest in it, remanufacturing needs to be economically viable. Johan Vogt Duberg has investigated how this can be accomplished.\n\nDisturbed blood flow can damage the aorta\n\nAbnormal blood flow in the aorta is linked to inflammation and breakdown of the vessel wall in conditions where the aorta is dilated. These findings by LiU researchers can contribute to better diagnosis.\n\nBarnafrid supports war-torn Ukraine\n\nThose working to help traumatised children in Ukraine are themselves in great need of support. Barnafrid at LiU, has been commissioned by the government to assist with working procedures and methods.\n\nHe heals skin and shares his knowledge\n\nAhmed Elserafy spends his days researching skin and stem cells and how they can be used in the treatment of burns and wounds that do not heal properly.
