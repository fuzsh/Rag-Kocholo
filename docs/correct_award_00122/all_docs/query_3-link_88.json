Battle of the Somme follows in July. Verdun, was the longest and one of the bloodiest engagements of WWI. Two million men fought beginning Feb. 21, 1916, when the Germans, commanded by Crown Prince Frederick William, launched a massive offensive, but the French rallied under General Pétain (with the cry, \"They shall not pass\") and resistance stiffened. Here occurred the first delivery of poison gas via artillery shells in conflict with the 1899 Haige Treaty. The phosgene gas used penetrated the gas masks used at the time and is credited with 85% of all gas deaths during WWI.\n\nBritish offensive on the Somme relieved the pressure on Verdun in July, 1916. The Germans sustained almost as many casualties as the French; an estimated 328,000 to the French 348,000.

Social structures begin to change in favor of higher education for women, and for questioning even the US President's right to hold women back.\n\nPreparedness Marches paraded in many US cities, including Washington pictured above during 1916. The cause had opponents from radical circles claiming that war would encourage many a business to profit off the carnage. Other opponents objected because they believed that WWI should be left a battle between capitalists and emperors, not the working man. This war was a European struggle and should not be fought with American blood. Those with the preparedness movement saw American involvement as inevitable and wanted the country’s industrial strength to turn toward a war footing sooner so American soldiers would be best armed and supplied. They also wanted to encourage the American public to prepare.\n\nThe Suffrage Movement continued to headline the news with more and more rallies and protests, especially in Washington against President Wilson’s opposition. By 1916, suffragettes encouraged more women to seek training in industrial settings preparing for their role in WWI and to seek higher educations. Many found a home at George Washington University.\n\nOrganized youth groups, particularly the scouts, arranged awareness drives collecting peach pits which were turned into carbon for gas mask filters. The US was sending gas masks to Britain along with food and necessary supplies.\n\nThe Fifty-fourth annual convention of ex-slaves was held at the Cosmopolitan Baptist Church on Tenth and N Streets NW from October 22 through November 6, 1916, presided over by Dr. Simon Drew, Pastor of the church. A dinner was served each day for the participants. Former slaves of Gen. Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson were present.\n\nPresident Wilson and candidates running for president were invited to speak, but no record can be found to indicate who accepted.\n\nIN FLANDERS FIELDS\n\nin Flanders fields the poppies blow\n\nBetween the crosses, row on row,\n\nThat mark our place; and in the sky\n\nThe larks, still bravely singing, fly\n\nScarce heard amid the guns below.\n\nWe are the Dead. Short days ago\n\nWe lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,\n\nLoved and were loved, and now we lie\n\nIn Flanders fields.\n\nTake up our quarrel with the foe:\n\nTo you from failing hands we throw\n\nThe torch; be yours to hold it high.\n\nIf ye break faith with us who die\n\nWe shall not sleep, though poppies grow\n\nIn Flanders fields. ~ Major John McCrae, Canadian\n\nFor More History Articles\n\nThe ENDEAVOR News Magazine"
