        "text": "[1881-1971]\n\nBorn in Philadelphia, Pa., Feb. 12, 1881. Took the degree of A.B. at Haverford College, 1902; of A.M. at Harvard, 1903, and of Ph.D. at the University of Pennsylvania, 1905. He then went abroad to do research work in the universities of England and Germany, where he spent several years. In 1908 he married Elisabeth, daughter of Franz von Pausinger, artist, of Salzburg, Austria, and, returning to America, took up his work at the University of Pennsylvania, where he remained as instructor and associate professor until 1916, when he resigned to engage in literary work. Mr. Stork's first book of verse to become known was \"Sea and Bay\", 1916. Since then he has done a great deal of translating from the Swedish and German, having made admirable renderings of Gustaf Fr√∂ding, 1916, as well as many other Swedish poets, whose work he published in an \"Anthology of Swedish Lyrics\", 1917. He has since made a translation of \"Selected Poems of Verner Von Heidenstam\", the Nobel Prize winner of 1916. In addition to his work in Swedish poetry, he has made an excellent rendering of the lyrics of Hofmansthal, the Austrian poet. Mr. Stork is the editor and owner of `Contemporary Verse', devoted to the poetry of the present group in America. A second collection of his own verse will soon appear."
