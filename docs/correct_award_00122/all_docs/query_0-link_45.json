        "text": "Heidenstam\n\nHeidenstam\n\nVerner von Heidenstam was born in the north-easterly room in the gable on the ground floor of the mansion on the 6th of July 1859. The room is kept with furniture from Verner von Heidenstam's time. One of the door architraves is very original in that Verner von Heidenstam and his relatives have measured and noted their height on it. Verner von Heidenstam's height is marked from age 4 to 21. In the room there is a tiled stove (Marieberg stove), which has been moved here from Naddö where the poet lived during his heydays in the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nThe building itself is today rebuilt as a kind of heritage building, but which houses also conference rooms, an inn, library, rooms for rent etc.\n\nBehind the building is the linden arbour, \"the twelve apostles\".\n\nVerner von Heidenstam was awarded the Nobel prize in literature in 1916. His most famous works are \"Karolinerna\" (The Charles Men) and \"Folkungaträdet\" (The Tree of the Folkungs) along with \"Nya dikter\" (New Poems) and \"När kastanjerna blommade\" (When the Chestnuts Bloomed). Verner von Heidenstam died in 1940. He is buried at Övralid, where he lived his last 15 years.\n\n\"Ensamhetens tankar\" (Thoughts of loneliness)\n\nI long for home since eight long years.\n\nIn sleep itself I've felt longing.\n\nI long for home. I long wherever I go\n\n- but not for people! I long for the ground,\n\nI long for the rocks where as child I played."
