        "text": "H.Res. 588 (107th) was a simple resolution in the United States Congress.\n\nA simple resolution is used for matters that affect just one chamber of Congress, often to change the rules of the chamber to set the manner of debate for a related bill. It must be agreed to in the chamber in which it was introduced. It is not voted on in the other chamber and does not have the force of law.\n\nResolutions numbers restart every two years. That means there are other resolutions with the number H.Res. 588. This is the one from the 107th Congress.\n\nThis simple resolution was introduced in the 107th Congress, which met from Jan 3, 2001 to Nov 22, 2002. Legislation not passed by the end of a Congress is cleared from the books.\n\nHow to cite this information.\n\nWe recommend the following MLA-formatted citation when using the information you see here in academic work:\n\nWhere is this information from?"
