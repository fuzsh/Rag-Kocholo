        "text": "Since its inception in 1901, nearly 900 people across the world have been awarded the Nobel Prize. In honor of Nobel Prize Day, Wounded Warrior Project® (WWP) salutes veterans who have made significant contributions to peace, physics, chemistry, physiology, or literature. Here are a few who have obtained a Nobel Prize nomination or award:\n\nLeonard P. Kaine\n\nDecorated Navy Captain and retired Fighter Pilot Leonard Kaine, or Len, received his second Nobel Peace Prize nomination in 2017. His post-military career has revolved around Golden Rule Society, his philanthropic organization that focuses on world peace and improving the lives and opportunities of people all over the world.\n\nRandy Sandifer\n\nRandy Sandifer was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 for the environmental research he conducted while stationed in Abu Ghraib prison while in the Army Reserve. His research led to the closing of the prison due to the dangerous hydrocarbon levels in the soil near residents’ water supply. Sandifer moved to the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) in 2012.\n\nJimmy Carter\n\nFormer U.S. president and Navy veteran Jimmy Carter was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for undertaking negotiations, campaigning for human rights, and working for social welfare. Some feel Carter deserved to be awarded as early as 1978 for mediating a peace agreement between Egypt and Israel.\n\nGeorge C. Marshall\n\nGeorge Marshall won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1953 for crafting the Marshall Plan, which aimed to provide economic and military aid to foreign nations. He served in both world wars for the U.S. Army and is one of the most decorated military leaders in American history.\n\nCharles G. Dawes\n\nCharles Dawes, former U.S. Vice President, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1925 for his role in reducing the tension between Germany and France after World War I. Charles is also recognized for his service during World War I as a highly decorated military officer."
