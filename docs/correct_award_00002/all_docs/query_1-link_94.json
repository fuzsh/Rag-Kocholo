        "text": "Part of this column was left out of its normal run in Thursday's Scene magazine, so it will run again in its entirety in Friday's edition of the Gainesville Sun.\n\nOn Oct. 9, the Norwegian Nobel Committee shocked the world, but especially my mother, by not awarding me the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nIt was a snub that will go down in history as a vicious affront to all those who value freedom, prosperity and the triumphant nature of the human spirit. It was a slap in the face to the millions of people who have sacrificed to better the world through peaceful protest, civil disobedience and — to a much lesser extent — hippie drum circles.\n\nAnyone who knows me will tell you that I am violently passionate about peace. I even go as far as to say “peace out” instead of “goodbye” when I leave social situations.\n\nI’m not going to say that President Barack Obama doesn’t deserve the prestigious award. He’s already made that clear himself. Instead, I posit only that I deserve it as much, if not more so, than the current leader of the free world. When our résumés are compared side-by-side, it becomes painfully obvious that our respective efforts to achieve peace have been equally fruitful. One of us, however, is an attention-hungry showboat.\n\nTake, for example, then-Senator Obama’s podcast from a Tel Aviv airport after touring Israeli and Palestinian settlements in January 2006. In it, he highlighted the region’s rich and textured history while asserting that despite the differences between Jewish and Muslim faiths, there are a number of elements connecting the two.\n\nIt’s a lovely sentiment, but I made that exact same point to a friend of mine in October 2005 as we were standing in line for frozen yogurt. When the subject of Middle East peace negotiations came up — as it often does in casual conversation — I remarked on the irony of two religions being at such odds with each other when their basic tenets, rituals and laws are so similar and each has so much to gain from mutual cooperation.\n\nMy words didn’t have any tangible impact on the world or its problems but neither did Obama’s. We both gave empowering and eloquent speeches, but only I brightened someone else’s day by paying for dessert. I doubt anyone in that Tel Aviv airport left with a free parfait, but he’s the one who looks good because he posted a self-righteous podcast on the Internet.\n\nThat wasn’t the first time Barack Obama stole my words and used them to boost his reputation.\n\nIn his 2008 speech “A More Perfect Union,” Obama tried to quell the outrage surrounding Reverend Jeremiah Wright’s controversial statements on race and unite our shattered nation with sentences like, “Let us find that common stake we all have in one another, and let our politics reflect that spirit as well.”\n\nI was irate when I heard those words leave his mouth because he was quoting verbatim from a speech I had given two days earlier to the youth soccer team I coach on weekends. We were having trouble gelling as a team so I took it upon myself to stop the game and inspire my ragtag group of 8-year-olds with juice boxes and a lesson on racial equality and and national identity.\n\nThe Fightin’ Doves didn’t go on to win the game, but Obama’s speech didn’t exactly heal our country’s wounds overnight, either. Despite our loftiest ideals, we remain a nation united by name but divided by race. At least I made sure everyone on the team got a trophy at the end of the season.\n\nThe fact of the matter is, the Nobel committee gave the Nobel Peace Prize to a man whose country is currently involved in two real wars overseas and countless metaphorical wars at home. It’s true that President Obama didn’t technically start any of them, but neither did I. The least the Nobel committee could do was recognize me for that."
