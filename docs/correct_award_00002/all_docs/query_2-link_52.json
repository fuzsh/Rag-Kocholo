        "text": "James Earl Carter Jr. served as president of the United States of America from 1977 to 1981. In 2002, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his negotiation of peace between Israel and Egypt and for his global humanitarian work through The Carter Center.\n\nSignificant foreign policy accomplishments of Jimmy Carter’s White House administration included the Panama Canal treaties, the Camp David Accords, the treaty of peace between Egypt and Israel, the SALT II strategic arms limitation treaty with the Soviet Union, and the establishment of U.S. diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. He also made human rights a central element of U.S. foreign policy.\n\nOn the domestic side, his administration's achievements included a comprehensive energy program conducted by a new Department of Energy; deregulation in energy, transportation, communications, and finance; major educational programs under a new Department of Education; and major environmental protection legislation, including the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. Prior to becoming president, Mr. Carter served two terms in the Georgia Senate and was governor of Georgia from 1971 to 1975.\n\nAfter leaving public office, President Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, founded the nongovernmental, not-for-profit Carter Center, devoted to advancing human rights and alleviating human suffering. Since 1982, The Carter Center has worked to resolve conflict, promote democracy, protect human rights, and prevent disease in many of the world’s poorest nations. The Center has spearheaded the international effort to eradicate Guinea worm disease, which will be the second disease in history to be eradicated, and has observed 101 elections in 39 countries since 1989."
