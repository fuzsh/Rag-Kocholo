The young man from Plains became the 39th President of the United States and remains a loyal Georgia Southwestern supporter. President Carter holds an Honorary Doctor of Humanities degree from Georgia Southwestern, and the campus library is named in honor of his father, James Earl Carter. On January 28, 2003, President Jimmy Carter and his wife Rosalynn (GSW 1946) announced that $370,000 of his Nobel Peace Prize Award would go to the Rosalynn Carter Institute for Human Development at Georgia Southwestern State University.",

        "text": "Jimmy Carter became the 39th President of the United States and a loyal Georgia Southwestern supporter. As State Senator and later Governor of Georgia, the Honorable Jimmy Carter assisted Georgia Southwestern, and he continues that support today. President Carter holds an Honorary Doctor of Humanities degree from Georgia Southwestern, and the campus library is named in honor of his father, James Earl Carter.\n\nOn February 13, 1942, four GSC freshmen etched their names in the wet cement of the newly constructed driveway entering the campus from the end of Glessner Street. Six decades have passed since these students left their mark, but their names are still visible: Bill Davis (Desoto), John McCrea (Atlanta), Bob Logan (Quitman) and Jimmy Carter (Plains).\n\nPictured is Jimmy Carter (back left) and the freshman basketball team."
