        "text": "I see Jimmy Carter has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, which must tickle Democrats everywhere.\n\nMr. Carter has been lobbying hard for the award for years, and, since he is a really nice person, he probably deserves it as much as anyone else – any American, that is – the Nobel committee would ever consider.\n\nHis work with Habitat for Humanity, I believe it is, has served him well, and I suspect the recent visit to Cuba – where he schmoozed with Fidel Castro and criticized current U.S. government policies – probably put him over the top for the award.\n\nAnd, as the head of the committee selecting Mr. Carter for the prize stated, it was partially intended as a “kick in the leg” to George W. Bush.\n\nHowever, I think many Americans may still find some fault with Mr. Carter’s service as an American president, and he probably will not go down in our history as a great president of the 20th century.\n\nHis work on the Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt has been touted as his greatest accomplishment, although it’s still difficult to say even 24 years later that lasting value to the Middle East peace process actually resulted.\n\nBut I would say his ineffectual handling of the Iran crisis – the kidnapping and impudent holding of almost 100 American diplomats for an extended period, then the absolutely horribly botched rescue attempt – may stand as the low point in American foreign policy in the last century.\n\nAs I remember, most of his foreign policy was characterized by, “Why can’t we all get along,” and “the-United-States-apologizes” approach to making the world peaceful.\n\nDictators and despots had free rein during his administration, with the United States apparently asleep at the wheel, and worldwide respect for the U.S. and the U.N. went basically into the crapper.\n\nI’m not sure I would say the result contributed to the peace process, but I’m not Norwegian. And possibly the worst domestic effect, in some opinions, is that some historians have suggested the Republican victories that ushered in the Reagan era were primarily predicated on a backlash to Mr. Carter’s ineffectual foreign policies.\n\nSo, he probably won’t win any prizes at home, but at least he impressed a five-man Norwegian selection committee and won a million bucks – if they give you the money."
