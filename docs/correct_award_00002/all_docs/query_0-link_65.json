        "text": "Jimmy Carter, the former US president, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize yesterday in what the chief judge said was a deliberate snub for President Bush over his war plans for Iraq.\n\nWhen asked if the award to Mr Carter, 78, was a \"kick in the leg\" for Mr Bush, Mr Berge replied: \"Yes, the answer is an unconditional yes.\"\n\nA \"kick in the leg\" is the Norwegian equivalent of a \"slap in the face\".\n\nAri Fleischer, Mr Bush's spokesman, refused to comment on Mr Berge's remarks.\n\n\"The president thinks this is a great day for Jimmy Carter and that's what he's going to focus on,\" he said.\n\nWhen pressed, Mr Fleischer would say only that Mr Bush had made a \"friendly call\" to Mr Carter and he did not know if they had discussed Iraq. \"It was a short call, it was a call to congratulate him.\"\n\nMr Berge, a senior Labour politician and former minister, leads the five-member parliamentary committee that makes the annual award.\n\nHis criticism of Mr Bush and admission that the award to a former president was a political gesture towards another was highly unusual.\n\nAlthough the citation for Mr Carter's award, which includes $1 million, did not mention Iraq specifically, the final paragraph made it clear the committee's decision, which was finalised only last week, should be seen in the light of the confrontation with Saddam Hussein.\n\n\"In a situation currently marked by threats of the use of power, Carter has stood by the principles that conflicts must as far as possible be resolved through mediation and international co-operation based on international law, respect for human rights, and economic development,\" it said.\n\nMr Carter said: \"I don't want to comment specifically on President Bush's policies, but I do think that in every way before we go into a war of any kind we should exhaust all other alternatives, including negotiation, mediation or, if that's not possible in the case of Iraq, working through the United Nations.\n\n\"I don't think there's any doubt that the Nobel prize itself encourages people to think about peace and human rights, so I'm very grateful and honoured by this.\"\n\nJan Petersen, the Norwegian foreign minister, said: \"I am somewhat taken aback about that [final] part of the citation.\n\n\"Irrespective it must not overshadow the fact that Jimmy Carter is a very deserving winner. He has done a lot of good things and could have won the prize previously.\"\n\nBut the row over Mr Berge's comments threatened to increase political criticism of the committee and draw charges of inappropriate meddling at a time when Anglo-American efforts to bring about United Nations Security Council consensus is at a highly sensitive stage.\n\nIn particular, critics will see the award as an attempt to influence future events rather than simply to reward past efforts to make peace.\n\nAccording to the will of Alfred Nobel, the peace prize should be awarded to \"the person who shall have done the most or best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the promotion and holding of peace congresses\".\n\nMr Carter's diplomacy was a vital contribution to the Camp David accords between Israel and Egypt but he did not receive an award because of the technicality that he was not nominated."
