        "text": "Jimmy Carter, the 39th President of the United States, has led a remarkable post-presidential career as a human rights advocate, the winner of the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize, and a bestselling author and diplomat. However, his 1977-1981 presidency remains controversial.\n\nMarc Lendler, a Wallingford resident & professor of political science at Smith College, will re-evaluate Carter's legacy, looking back at key moments of his administration such as the 1973 Oil Embargo, the Nicaraguan Revolution, the Iran hostage crisis, and much more.
