        "text": "ATLANTA, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - Former President Jimmy Carter’s grandson says the nation’s 39th president is “doing OK,” but nearing the end.\n\nDuring Tuesday’s 28th annual Rosalynn Carter Georgia Mental Health Forum, Jason Carter said he was in Plains, Georgia, two weeks ago, and watched an Atlanta Braves game with his Nobel Peace Prize-winning grandfather.\n\n“I told him people ask me how you’re doing, and I don’t know,” Jason Carter said. “He said, ‘well, I don’t know either.’”\n\nThe former president entered hospice care more than a year ago in his hometown of Plains, Georgia. Since then he celebrated his 99th birthday last October and attended the annual Peanut Festival, which celebrates the region’s cash crop.\n\nHe also mourned the loss of his wife, Rosalynn Carter, who died in November at the age of 96. To date, that has been Jimmy Carter’s last public appearance.\n\nIn late May, the Carter Center announced Mrs. Carter was experiencing dementia. The announcement came months after the center announced Jimmy Carter was entering hospice care.\n\nOn Oct. 17, 2019, having married 26,765 days, Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter became the longest-married presidential couple in history (George H.W. Bush and Barbara Bush previously held the record).\n\nThe couple had been married for 77 years.\n\nLast week, Jason Carter said the former Georgia governor recently cast a a mail-in ballot for the May 21 Georgia primary, emphasizing his grandfather is not going to miss an election.\n\nAtlanta News First and Atlanta News First+ provide you with the latest news, headlines and insights as we look at the life and accomplishments of Georgia’s favorite couple.
