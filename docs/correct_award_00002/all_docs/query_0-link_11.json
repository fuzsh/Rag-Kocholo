        "text": "Transcript\n\nNARRATOR: Jimmy Carter—the 39th president of the United States—received sharp criticism for his handling of domestic and foreign affairs while in office. After leaving the presidency, however, he won wide respect for his efforts as a diplomat and humanitarian. In fact, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.\n\nCarter grew up in the small town of Plains, Georgia, where his family owned a peanut farm. After high school, he attended the U.S. Naval Academy and served in the navy for seven years. He returned home to run the family farm after his father's death in 1953. Carter also became involved in local politics, fighting for equality and integration. He was elected Georgia's governor in 1970 and declared . . .\n\nJIMMY CARTER: The time for racial discrimination is over.\n\nNARRATOR: In 1976 Carter ran for president. His background as a peanut farmer became a large part of his image. He was seen as an outsider to the national political scene, someone who could restore public confidence following the Watergate scandal and President Richard Nixon's resignation. Carter's campaign slogans proclaimed him to be \"A Leader, for a Change,\" and \"Not Just Peanuts.\" He won the election, defeating President Gerald Ford, Nixon's former vice president.\n\nAfter taking office, President Carter faced an energy crisis and a struggling economy. He established the Department of Energy, emphasized spending cutbacks, and approved measures designed to stimulate the economy. Despite his efforts, unemployment remained high and inflation rose sharply during Carter's administration.\n\nCarter achieved one of his greatest presidential successes in September 1978. He hosted a summit meeting between Egyptian President Anwar el-Sādāt and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland. Egypt and Israel had been in a state of war since the establishment of Israel 30 years earlier. After nearly two weeks of talks, Begin and Sādāt reached an agreement to end the fighting between their countries. They signed a peace treaty six months later.\n\nThe second half of Carter's term saw several foreign policy challenges. After the Soviets invaded Afghanistan in 1979, Carter banned the export of certain American goods to the Soviet Union. He also led a boycott of the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow.\n\nIn November 1979 Carter faced a greater crisis as Iranian militants stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehrān and took more than 50 Americans hostage. Carter's attempts to win their release proved unsuccessful, and the hostages remained captive for more than 14 months.\n\nThe Iran hostage crisis and the struggling economy caused many Americans to lose confidence in Carter's abilities as president. Carter had addressed America's \"crisis of confidence\" in 1979. He argued that Americans were not only doubting him, they were doubting themselves, too.\n\nJIMMY CARTER: We've always believed in something called progress. We've always had a faith that the days of our children would be better than our own. Our people are losing that faith, not only in government itself but in the ability as citizens to serve as the ultimate rulers and shapers of our democracy.\n\nNARRATOR: President Carter sought reelection in 1980 but lost decisively to Ronald Reagan. The hostages were finally released on January 20, 1981, minutes after Carter left office.\n\nCarter's image and legacy improved in the years after his presidency. He and his wife, Rosalynn, began working with Habitat for Humanity in 1984. In the following decades, they spent one week each year helping build homes in the United States and abroad. The Carters became the organization's most visible advocates, helping to raise awareness and recruit volunteers for the Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter Work Project.\n\nThe couple also founded the Carter Center, which advocates for peace, democracy, health, and human rights. The center has engaged in conflict mediation and election monitoring across the world. It also played a leading role in the initiative to eradicate Guinea worm disease, which affected millions of people in Africa and Asia.\n\nIn 2002 the Nobel Foundation awarded Carter the Nobel Peace Prize \"for his decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development.\""
