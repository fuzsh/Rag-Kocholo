        "text": "“Report to the American People,” Remarks from the White House Library. In remarks while seated beside a burning fire (a literal fireside chat) Carter wore a yellow cardigan sweater. He discussed an array of issues including inflation, taxes, improving government efficiency, and foreign affairs. “All of us must learn to waste less energy.”\n\nAddress to the Nation on Energy. In an address to the nation from the oval office, Carter calls his forthcoming program of energy conservation the “moral equivalent of war.” “If we do not act, then by 1985 we will be using 33 percent more energy than we use today.”\n\nAddress at Notre Dame University Commencement. “. . . I believe we can have a foreign policy that is democratic, that is based on fundamental values, and that uses power and influence, which we have, for humane purposes. We can also have a foreign policy that the American people both support and, for a change, know about and understand.”\n\nRemarks and Statement on Signing Civil Service Reform Act. Establishes Senior Executive Service. “This bill changes the rules in a constructive fashion, a carefully considered fashion. It puts incentive and reward back into the Federal system. It allows Federal employees to be encouraged, transferred, or discharged for the right reasons if they cannot or will not perform. And it prevents discouraging or punishing them for the wrong reasons, for whistleblowing or for personal whim in violation of basic employee rights.”\n\nRemarks on Signing Five Energy Bills. “Today we can rightfully claim that we have a conscious national policy for dealing with the energy problems of the present and also to help us deal with them in the future.” In a separate News Conference, explains that he signed the Revenue Act, cutting capital gains taxes contrary to his wishes because it did lower taxes for many.\n\nAddress to Joint Session of Congress on the Vienna Summit Meeting. Discusses the signing of the second Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT II) with the USSR. “. . . we must prevent an uncontrolled and pointless nuclear arms race that would damage the security of all countries . . .“\n\nThe U.S. Senate never ratifies the treaty as tensions build with the Soviet Union. Also see, Remarks at the Signing Ceremony.\n\nThe “Malaise Speech.” In a televised address to the nation on energy and national goals, Carter discussed at length a “threat to the nation:” “The threat is nearly invisible in ordinary ways. It is a crisis of confidence. It is a crisis that strikes at the very heart and soul and spirit of our national will. We can see this crisis in the growing doubt about the meaning of our own lives and in the loss of a unity of purpose for our Nation.” People are losing faith in the future. “We must face the truth, and then we can change our course.” He never used the word “malaise” in that speech, but he did in several other instances.\n\nState of the Union Address. Articulates what became known as the “Carter Doctrine.” \"An attempt by any outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States of America. And such an assault will be repelled by any means necessary, including military force.”\n\nIn interview session with editors and broadcasters, Carter says that concerning the hostages being held at the Embassy “we have reserved for ourselves the right to use any means permitted under international law.” This is interpreted to mean military action against Iran.\n\nRemarks on Signing the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. “We've tried to look forward to the year 2000, and we've been very concerned at what we've seen. We must face the fact that these threats to the quality of life will perhaps be the greatest challenges which this Nation must face. None of us can afford to relax our vigilance, and we certainly cannot afford to rely on government alone to be vigilant for us.”"
