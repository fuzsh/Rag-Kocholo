The choice this year could not have been more just,\" he told Portugal's Lusa news agency.\n\nRamos-Horta was awarded the Nobel prize for peace together with Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo for their non-violent struggle for independence from Indonesian rule in East Timor.\n\nPortugal colonised East Timor for four centuries before it abruptly withdrew in 1975, leaving the territory to be annexed by Indonesia. East Timor officially became independent in May.\n\n\"Perhaps the Nobel Committee is betting that Jimmy Carter, as a Nobel Peace prize winner and a great figure, could relieve the spirit of confrontation that exists at this moment between Iraq and the US,\" Horta said, adding Carter could perhaps meet with Iraqi president Saddam Hussein.\n\nCarter made an appeal for exhausting all alternatives to war with Iraq in an interview with CNN television after the announcement that he had been awarded the Nobel peace prize.\n\nBack to October Menu\n\nAugust\n\nMain Postings Menu\n\nNote: For those who would like to fax \"the powers that be\" - CallCenter is a Native 32-bit Voice Telephony software application integrated with fax and data communications... and it's free of charge!
