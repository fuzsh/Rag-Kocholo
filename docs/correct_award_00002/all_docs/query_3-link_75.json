        "text": "WASHINGTON, D.C. -- As President Gerald R. Ford fought to retain the position he inherited after Richard Nixon's resignation, one man stood in his way.\n\nA Georgia peanut farmer named Jimmy Carter was destined to defeat Ford in 1976, placing a Democrat in the White House after eight years of Republican leadership.\n\nForty-one years later, the friendship and mutual respect that grew between the former opponents was on display as Carter was presented with a medal bearing the visage of his onetime political rival. Carter was announced Monday, June 5, as the 2017 recipient of the Gerald R. Ford Medal for Distinguished Public Service.\n\nThe honor, presented to the 39th president by the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Foundation, was announced during a ceremony at the Capitol Hill Club in Washington D.C., though Carter was not able to travel to Washington for the ceremony. In a pre-recorded video at the Carter Center in Atlanta, Georgia, the former president recalled the bond that grew between himself and his former political opponent.\n\n\"As I reflect back on more than 25 different projects that Jerry and I collaborated and shared leadership, I can't help but be grateful for the mutual respect and the intense personal friendship that developed during that time together,\" Carter said.\n\nSteven Ford, son of the 38th president, recalled how the foundations of a friendship were laid during a cross-Atlantic flight for the funeral of former Egyptian president Anwar el-Sadat in 1981.\n\nRed Cavaney, chairman of the foundation's board of trustees, pointed to the relationship that resulted as an important example for others in the current political climate.\n\n\"This unique relationship between two very special couples began late in your respective lives,\" Cavaney said. \"Yet, it sets a model for so many others to emulate, especially in the trying times we are in today.\"\n\nSteven Ford echoed that sentiment before presenting Carter with the medal.\n\n\"Looking at the current toxic times and reflecting back to President Carter's and dad's times in office, through their examples we can learn how politics should be conducted,\" Ford said. \"They illustrated to the nation that politics can be handled with dignity, class and respect.\"\n\nIf his father was still here today, he said, he would certainly be \"leading the charge\" to honor Carter with this award.\n\n\"Mr. President, your lifelong work illustrates what this award is about,\" Ford said.\n\nA former naval officer and peanut farmer, Carter served two terms in the Georgia State Senate and later as the Peach State's 76th governor. Despite being relatively unknown outside his home state, Carter won the 1976 Democratic presidential nomination and went on to defeat incumbent Republican President Gerald Ford in the general election.\n\nSworn in as president on Jan. 20, 1977, Carter went on to achieve a series of significant foreign policy goals including the Panama Canal treaties, the Camp David accords, the SALT-II treaty with the Soviet Union and the establishment of diplomatic relations with China. In domestic policy, his presidential legacy includes the establishment of a national energy policy and creation of both the Departments of Education and Energy.\n\nKnown as an advocate for civil and human rights before, during and after his presidency, Carter declared \"the time of racial segregation is over\" during his inaugural speech as Georgia's governor.\n\n\"No poor, rural, weak, or black person should ever have to bear the additional burden of being deprived of the opportunity for an education, a job or simple justice,\" Carter said.\n\nCreated in 2002, the Gerald R. Ford Medal for Distinguished Public Service seeks to recognize qualities many admired in Ford. Those qualities, according to Ford Foundation Trustee Carla Hills, include \"strength of character, integrity, trustworthiness, sound judgement, fidelity to principle and personal discipline.\"\n\nThose qualities, Hills said, are exemplified in the life and work of Jimmy Carter.\n\nThe former president has been honored many times for his work facilitating peace negotiations, observing democratic elections and advancing disease prevention and eradication efforts in developing nations. Carter has also been a key volunteer and champion for nonprofit Habitat for Humanity.\n\nCarter is a recipient of the United Nations Human Rights Award (1998), the Presidential Medal of Freedom (1999) and the Nobel Peace Prize (2002). Though three sitting presidents -- Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson and Barack Obama -- have also received the Nobel Peace Prize, Carter has the distinction of being the only U.S. president to receive the award for his actions after leaving office.\n\nBefore presenting the award to Carter, Steven Ford reiterated his family's strong feelings for their father's former opponent.\n\n\"My family and I are grateful for President Carter's public service and how he has conducted himself throughout his life,\" Ford said. \"We are proud to call the Carter family friends.\"\n\nIn accepting the honor, Carter chose to praise his predecessor and friend, Gerald R. Ford, whose eulogy he delivered during the former president's January 2007 funeral service in East Grand Rapids.\n\n\"The words I spoke about my dear friend both at my inauguration and his funeral still ring true today,\" Carter said. \"For myself and for our nation I thank my predecessor for all he did to heal our land. I am thrilled to receive the Gerald R. Ford Medal for Distinguished Public Service and I'm prouder still of the lasting friendship we still have with the Ford family.\"\n\nPrevious recipients of the Gerald R. Ford Medal for Distinguished Public Service include:\n\nPresident George H.W. Bush (2016)\n\nJohn D. Dingell and Carl Levin (2015)\n\nJohn O. Marsh Jr. (2014)\n\nGeneral Brent Scowcroft (2013)\n\nThomas P. \"Tip\" O'Neil (2012)\n\nWilliam T. Coleman (2011)\n\nHenry Kissinger (2010)\n\nJohn Paul Stevens (2009)\n\nCarla A. Hills (2008)\n\nJames Baker and Lee Hamilton (2007)\n\nMen and Women of the United States Armed Forces (2006)\n\nBetty Ford (2005)\n\nRichard Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld (2004)\n\nAlan Greenspan (2003)\n\nAlso honored Monday were the winners of the foundation's 2016 Gerald R. Ford Journalism Prize for Distinguished Reporting:\n\nGregory Korte (USA Today)\n\nDavid Martin and Mary Walsh (CBS News)\n\nDavid Cloud (Los Angeles Times)\n\nKorte was awarded the foundation's Prize for Distinguished Reporting on the Presidency for a series of reports about the use of the president's pardon power, the increased utilization of lower-risk sentence commutation and its unintended consequences. He also generated unique reports examining diverse White House practices, ranging from signing ceremonies to flag-lowering procedures for government buildings.\n\nMartin and Walsh received the foundation's Prize for Distinguished Reporting on National Defense for their report \"The New Cold War.\" The story explained why the nation's nuclear missions remain critical by tying it to changes in Russia's aggressiveness on land and an increase in the size and frequency of Russia's nuclear strategy, which includes changes to Russian military doctrine approving the use of smaller tactical weapons.\n\nCloud received an honorable mention national defense reporting for his investigative series highlighting the California National Guard and how demand for troops to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan resulted in significant military bonuses for soldiers who were eventually deemed ineligible."
