        "text": "The following interview was originally published in Britannica’s Book of the Year in 2004.\n\nFew people in the United States have a better overview of the state of the world than Jimmy Carter. He has been a submarine officer in the U.S. Navy, a successful peanut farmer, governor of Georgia (1971–75), the 39th president of the U.S. (1977–81), and, with his wife, Rosalynn, founder of The Carter Center (1982), an organization dedicated to the well-being of the world's people. In addition to his many other honours, Carter received the 2002 Nobel Prize for Peace. Now 79 years old, Carter is still very active in The Carter Center’s projects, which include monitoring national elections, promoting peace through personal diplomacy, and eradicating or preventing tropical diseases such as river blindness, Guinea worm disease, and trachoma. Since leaving the White House he has written 18 books, including political memoirs, personal reminiscences, inspirational works, poetry, and, most recently, a novel. This written interview is excerpted from a conversation with Encyclopædia Britannica Director of Yearbooks Charles Trumbull at The Carter Center in Atlanta, Ga., on June 26, 2003.\n\nEncyclopædia Britannica: How would you characterize the state of the world in 2003?\n\nPresident Carter: I think the world is deeply concerned and uncertain about the future. The number of conflicts on Earth now is close to the highest in history. There is rapidly increasing wealth in the industrialized countries and a growing gap, or chasm, between the quality of life of those nations and the nations of the developing world. The status of the international community has changed dramatically in the last year. For the first time in human history, there is one undisputed superpower that is asserting its military strength.\n\nThe strength of the United Nations has been dramatically challenged and potentially weakened. There is a lack of understanding or cooperation between Europe and the United States that is unprecedented in recent history. The effects of so-called globalization have not attenuated the disparities between the rich and poor countries but maybe have accelerated them. The ability of people now in the poorer nations to understand through mass media the degree of their economic plight has made them increasingly resentful as they can compare themselves with families in other nations and not just families in the next village. Yet the quality of life for people like me and most readers of Encyclopædia Britannica is improved every year by scientific and medical developments that hold promise for the future.\n\nThe decrease in colonial or central authority in Russia, the former Yugoslavia, and throughout Africa has unleashed ethnic strife and tribal differences that were subdued under colonial influence in Africa and under the powerful central governments of the Soviet Union and Marshal Tito. But I believe most of our individual fears of terrorism in industrialized countries are unjustified. Statistically speaking, it is highly unlikely that any of us or our friends will be directly affected by terrorism, although the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks has made us all extraordinarily fearful.\n\nEB: Do you see terrorism or state terrorism as a new phenomenon?\n\nCarter: No, I think there has been an incipient element of terrorism for a long time. When I was president, we dealt with terrorism in the form of explosions, aircraft hijackings, and things of that kind, but there was not a worldwide awareness of it. Leaders were concerned, however, and we acted to try to control it.\n\nEB: Would you agree that the history of the 20th century was a history of the clash between various ideologies—capitalism, communism, fascism, and so on—and, if so, what do you think the arena for the 21st century is going to be? Will ideologies again be the issue, or will it be our cultural, ethnic, and social differences?\n\nCarter: In the first few months of 2001, I gave several speeches addressing the question of the greatest challenge the world faces in the new millennium. My answer was the “growing gap between rich and poor people.” This is the preeminent potential element of conflict and dispute we face in the coming years. It is exacerbated by the growing sense of a religious difference, that you have Muslims on one side and Christians on the other who have been identified, at least in the public consciousness, as adversaries. Since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, this potential difference between Islam and the Christian world has become a very important concern, almost an obsession for some people. I do not see it as justified, but it exists.\n\nEB: You suggested in your Nobel Prize lecture that in the new era nations will be called upon to cede some of their sovereignty to international organizations, yet in many ways the U.S. seems to be backing away from initiatives that would limit its ability to act independently—for example, in the United Nations recently over Iraq, in the World Trade Organization whenever it rules against the U.S., in regard to the International Criminal Court, and so on.\n\nCarter: Some of my Nobel address was targeted toward the United States and its recent policies, which concern me very deeply: the inclination to bypass the United Nations or to derogate its work; an attempt to deal unilaterally with the problems of the world; trying to impose our will on others with military action as a very great and early possibility, not a last resort; a strong inclination, proven by actions, to abandon all the important international agreements that had been approved by presidents of the past and to prevent the implementation of agreements in the embryonic stage, including the International Criminal Court; and the abandonment of the agreement at Kyoto concerning global warming. The Kyoto Agreement represented consensus reached after a decade or more of analysis of scientific facts, laborious negotiation, and trying to reach a common purpose. The U.S. now has separated itself publicly from most commitments it made and is also embarking on a new effort to develop new atomic weaponry, as shown in the recent vote in Congress in support of deep-penetrating nuclear bombs, and the antiballistic-missile placements that have recently been approved in Alaska and are now facing China and North Korea. Many of these are departures from past policies and, I think, contravene the general premises espoused by the rest of the world and previous leaders of this country, regardless of our partisan commitments.\n\nEB: You have spoken frequently about the important role that nongovernmental organizations and private initiatives have in alleviating some of the world’s problems.\n\nCarter: A typical NGO is an organization designed for humanitarian or altruistic purposes—for example, to alleviate suffering, provide improved environmental quality, promote freedom and democracy, or guarantee human rights. Second, although some NGOs may be bound by the purposes expressed by the founder, or their heirs, many are adequately flexible and can deal without the restraints of complicated government structures, economies, and so forth and can make decisions rapidly. Third, NGO representatives quite often work in areas of the world and among people of the world who are most in need. If an NGO like The Carter Center devotes itself, say, to dealing with tropical diseases, we are on the ground in the villages, in the homes of people who suffer from these diseases.\n\nAnother aspect of NGOs is that they have no special authority and could not have it even if they wanted it. The Carter Center has now observed 45 elections in the world. We go into those countries by invitation, and the first thing I always announce when I arrive is that we have no authority. All authority rests in the local government or its national election commission.\n\nEB: I am interested in your humble use of the word authority. You claim that you have no authority, yet you have enormous authority when you go into a country. The personal dimension of your involvement with The Carter Center gives you an enormous amount of sway, does it not?\n\nCarter: Well, there is certainly moral authority and the influence of my voice, on behalf of The Carter Center. Quite often we monitor an election side by side with representatives of the United Nations. On election day, if I see something going wrong, I have no reluctance to take it up directly with the head of the ruling party, the president, or the prime minister. If that is unsuccessful, I am not shy about calling an international press conference and saying, “This is wrong, and the ruling party should take action to change it.” When the election is over, I have no reticence about saying, “This election was faulty, and I do not believe the will of the people was represented.”\n\nEB: How do you view some of the other grand-scale personal efforts to alleviate suffering? I am thinking particularly of rock musician Bob Geldof, who earlier this year called for a “Marshall Plan” for Africa. Geldof said that during the Marshall Plan for Europe, 1% of the gross national product of the United States went to rebuilding Europe and that the same thing could be done in Africa with 0.16% of GNP.\n\nCarter: I think we could do it if we invested 0.1% of the U.S. GNP for humanitarian aid. By the way, the humanitarian aid figure from the U.S. government is the lowest percentage of any industrialized country in the world. European countries give about 4 times as much; Norway gives about 17 times as much per capita.\n\nEB: You set up The Carter Center 21 years ago. What was your vision then, and what is your vision now, say, looking 20 years out?\n\nCarter: They were quite different. When we conceived of The Carter Center, Rosalynn and I had the very limited vision of creating here a Camp David in miniature. I thought I would deal exclusively with conflicts or potential conflicts in the world, analyze their causes and the principles of the parties involved, and offer my services as a mediator, as I had mediated between Israel and Egypt in the Camp David Accords in 1978 that led to the peace treaty between those countries—by the way, not a word of which has ever been violated.\n\nWe still do that. But The Carter Center has evolved, because I realized that my earlier commitments to human rights and to peace were primarily predicated on my limited viewpoint as a president and governor. I did not understand that intense personal hunger and suffering from preventable diseases was such a terrible problem. I did not know about all the poor countries I know well today. Now over half our total effort is devoted to health programs. The most remarkable progress is against Guinea worm disease. Incidences have been reduced from 3.5 million, when the eradication campaign began, to less than 50,000 today, and almost three-fourths of those are in southern Sudan, where we cannot reach some of the villages because of the civil war.\n\nThe Carter Center has extended its vision to encompass a much broader range of human rights, not only civil and political rights, such as freedom of speech, freedom of mistreatment by authorities, and the right to self-governance, but social and economic rights, including environmental concerns, alleviation of suffering, and the right to health care.\n\nEB: You have mentioned the 9/11 attacks several times today. How have those events changed your thinking or the policies of The Carter Center?\n\nCarter: It really has not changed our policies. I was pleasantly surprised after 9/11 that the worldwide support for The Carter Center went up noticeably. Many people saw The Carter Center as an element of international stability, that we operated across ethnic and religious lines, in mundane commitments, like growing more rice on a farm or treating children for river blindness, and realized that we dealt with all kinds of governments and leaders equitably. So, as far as The Carter Center was concerned, 9/11 was a terrible atrocity but not an adverse factor on our own projects.\n\nEB: Let me ask for your quick responses to situations in a couple of hot spots around the world. Brazil—There are very interesting developments with the election of Pres. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.\n\nCarter: Yes. I have very good hopes about Brazil. I understand that President Lula has chosen excellent advisers, is making good decisions, and is putting Brazil on the right track.\n\nEB: One of Lula’s first acts as president was to declare that nobody in Brazil should be without housing. As if to underline his determination, Lula canceled a very large order of military equipment.\n\nCarter: That is a very good move. We have tried to encourage that all over Latin America. The leader in this regard is Costa Rica, a country that devotes all its resources to nonmilitary purposes.\n\nEB: Zimbabwe—You were present at the creation, were you not?\n\nCarter: I think I spent more time working on the issues in Zimbabwe than I did on the Middle East peace process!\n\nEB: It seems to be a country that is on the brink.\n\nCarter: It is because of malfeasance and maladministration of Pres. Robert Mugabe.\n\nEB: What is the way out?\n\nCarter: To find some means to terminate his leadership. I do not see any way out as long as he is the leader.\n\nEB: Iraq—Do you think the Iraqis had weapons of mass destruction in the spring of 2003?\n\nCarter: Well, I know they had weapons of mass destruction in the era of the Iran-Iraq War. They used them, I think with the knowledge of the United States. Maybe by the time this interview is published, my opinion will not amount to anything, but I am increasingly doubtful that they did have substantial weapons of mass destruction at the time of the U.S. invasion.\n\nEB: Thank you very much, Mr. President."
