        "text": "The winners of this year's Nobel Prizes for Literature, Medicine, Physics, Chemistry and Economics received their awards from King Carl XVI Gustaf at a gala ceremony in Stockholm today.\n\nIn a separate ceremony held earlier in Oslo, former US president Jimmy Carter received the prestigious Nobel Peace Prize, in the presence of Norway's King Harald and Queen Sonja.\n\nAll of the laureates received a diploma and a gold Nobel medal, as well as a cheque worth 10 million Swedish kronor (about $A1.78 million)- to be shared if the prize was awarded to more than one person.\n\nThe Stockholm ceremony, held at the city's Concert Hall, was to be followed by a gala banquet for 1,400 guests at Stockholm's City Hall.\n\nThe other winners of this year's prizes included Hungarian novelist Imre Kertesz, who won the Literature Prize for his body of work shaped by his experience of the Holocaust.\n\nBritons Sydney Brenner and John Sulston and H Robert Horvitz of the United States won the Medicine Prize for their gene research, while Raymond Davis of the US, Masatoshi Koshiba of Japan and Italian-born Riccardo Giacconi of the US were awarded the Physics Prize for their pioneering work in astrophysics.\n\nThe Chemistry Prize went to John Fenn of the US, Koichi Tanaka of Japan and Kurt Wuethrich of Switzerland for research which turned chemical biology into a powerful tool against diseases such as Alzheimer's, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease, and some of the deadliest forms of cancer.\n\nFinally, Daniel Kahneman, an Israeli-US psychologist, and US economist Vernon Smith received the Economics Prize for research on how people deal with choices about money, laying the foundations for two new areas of research, economic psychology and experimental economics.\n\nAFP"
