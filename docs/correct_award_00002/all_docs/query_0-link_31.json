        "text": "The Nobel Peace Prize for 2002\n\nThe Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided to award the Nobel Peace Prize for 2002 to Jimmy Carter, for his decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development.\n\nDuring his presidency (1977-1981), Carter's mediation was a vital contribution to the Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt, in itself a great enough achievement to qualify for the Nobel Peace Prize. At a time when the cold war between East and West was still predominant, he placed renewed emphasis on the place of human rights in international politics.\n\nThrough his Carter Center, which celebrates its 20th anniversary in 2002, Carter has since his presidency undertaken very extensive and persevering conflict resolution on several continents. He has shown outstanding commitment to human rights, and has served as an observer at countless elections all over the world. He has worked hard on many fronts to fight tropical diseases and to bring about growth and progress in developing countries. Carter has thus been active in several of the problem areas that have figured prominently in the over one hundred years of Peace Prize history.\n\nIn a situation currently marked by threats of the use of power, Carter has stood by the principles that conflicts must as far as possible be resolved through mediation and international co-operation based on international law, respect for human rights, and economic development.\n\nOslo, 11 October 2002\n\nNorwegian Nobel Institute\n\nDrammensveien 19, N-0255 Oslo, Norway\n\nWebsite: www.nobel.no (Link to be opened in new window).\n\nBOES.ORG\n\nMultilingual Human Rights\n\nInternational Campaign\n\nto Ban Landmines (ICBL)\n\nICBL NGO-links\n\nCarter Center\n\ncartercenter.org\n\nLaureates\n\n2004: Wangari Maathai.
