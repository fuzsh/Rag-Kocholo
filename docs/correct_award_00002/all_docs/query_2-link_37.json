Signed First Edition, First Printing with a full number line on the copyright page as required. Personally hand signed by President Jimmy Carter, the Nobel Peace Prize Winner, directly into the book.\n\nAbout:\n\nIn 2002, President Carter received the Nobel Peace Prize for his work \"to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development\" through The Carter Center. He was the third U.S. President, after Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, to be awarded the Prize. Carter shares with Martin Luther King, Jr., the distinction of being the only native Georgians to be so honored.\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize Lecture was delivered by Jimmy Carter on December 10, 2002, at the ceremony in Oslo, Norway, where he received the Nobel Prize for Peace.\n\nAbout the author:\n\nJimmy Carter was born in Plains, Georgia, and served as thirty-ninth President of the United States. He and his wife, Rosalynn, founded The Carter Center, a nonprofit organization that prevents and resolves conflicts, enhances freedom and democracy, and improves health around the world. He is the author of numerous books, including Palestine Peace Not Apartheid, An Hour Before Daylight and Our Endangered Values. He received a \"Best Spoken Word\" Grammy Award for his recording of Our Endangered Values. All of President Carter's proceeds from this series will go to the Maranatha Baptist Church of Plains, Georgia.\n\nAbout The Nobel Peace Prize\n\nSince March 1901, it has been awarded annually (with some exceptions) to those who have \"done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses\"."
