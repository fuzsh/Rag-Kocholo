        "text": "The University of California, Merced, USA, is to present its 15th annual Alice and Clifford Spendlove Prize in Social Justice, Diplomacy and Tolerance to His Holiness the Dalai Lama in a live conference on Sep 18, reported the mercedcountytimes.com Aug 25.\n\nThe live video link from India will be limited for viewing, but the full ceremony will be shown at a later date to a larger in-person audience during a special Spendlove Prize celebration at UC Merced, the report said.\n\nThe award has been announced by Sherrie Spendlove, the Merced native who made the award possible by a generous gift in honor of her parents Alice and Clifford back in 2005 during the UC Merced opening ceremonies.\n\n“As the leader of the Tibetan Buddhist people and culture, His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama had to flee Tibet for India as a young man to escape the genocide of his followers and the eradication of his culture by the Chinese government,” Spendlove has said. “To this unfathomable injustice he has repeatedly responded with generosity of spirit and love for his victimizers.\n\n“In our increasingly politically-divided and highly confrontational world, the messages of kindness, peace, compassion, and forgiveness of His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama, are helpful, not only in advancing sustainable social justice using non-violent methods, but also as a path to better interpersonal relations and a more meaningful life.”\n\nSpendlove has further said, “The Dalai Lama is an internationally-acclaimed spiritual leader whose work promotes peace and is recognized as such by many other international spiritual leaders such as former President Jimmy Carter and South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, both fellow Nobel Peace Prize winners.”\n\nSource: TibetanReview.net, Aug 26, 2022\n\nHuman rights activist Nadia Murad has been selected as the 14th recipient of the Alice and Clifford Spendlove Prize in Social Justice, Diplomacy and Tolerance. The 2018 Nobel Peace Prize recipient will be honored during a virtual ceremony on Nov. 3.\n\nMurad is an advocate for survivors of genocide and sexual violence. Her New York Times bestselling memoir “The Last Girl: My Story of Captivity, and My Fight Against the Islamic State” provides a harrowing account of the genocide against the Yazidi ethno-religious minority in Iraq and Murad’s imprisonment by the Islamic State.\n\nMerced native Sherrie Spendlove, who in 2005 established the Spendlove Prize in honor of her parents, Alice and Clifford, identified some of the atrocities Murad and her community experienced.\n\n\"One of the greatest injustices that exist is that innocent women and children bear the backlash of the violence of any war or armed conflict,” she said. “Nadia Murad, a young Yazidi woman from northern Iraq, experienced this travesty of justice. In August 2014, ISIS committed genocide against her people, her entire village and her family. They also kidnapped the young females, some as young as 9, along with Nadia and her sisters for the purpose of sexual trafficking.”\n\nAfter escaping captivity, Murad began speaking out on behalf of her community. Murad is the founder and president of Nadia’s Initiative, a non-profit dedicated to rebuilding communities in crisis and advocating for survivors of sexual violence. Nadia’s Initiative’s current work is focused on the sustainable re-development of the Yazidi homeland in Sinjar and pursuing holistic justice for survivors of ISIS atrocities.\n\nMuch of Nadia’s advocacy work is focused on meeting with global leaders to raise awareness of the genocide against the Yazidi people and the systemic use of sexual violence as a weapon of war. She and her team have advocated for legislation that protects and promotes women’s rights, as well as drafting and advocating for the passage of resolutions to expand the UN’s commitments to end sexual violence in conflict.\n\nIn 2016, Murad became the first United Nations Goodwill Ambassador for the Dignity of Human Trafficking. She was also awarded the Council of Europe Václav Havel Human Rights Prize and Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. Two years later, Murad won the Nobel Peace Prize with Dr. Denis Mukwege. Murad was appointed as a UN Sustainable Development Goals Advocate in 2019.\n\n“The Spendlove Prize supports Nadia's righteous quest to bring ISIS to the International Court of Justice for their egregious crimes against humanity and her life's work to help other survivors of genocide and human sex trafficking to heal and rebuild their communities through her program Nadia's Initiative,” Spendlove said.\n\n“We are delighted to have Nadia Murad join the growing number of recipients of the Spendlove Prize,” School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts Dean Jeffrey Gilger said. “Alice and Clifford Spendlove focused their careers on improving the lives of others – something that Nadia is working tirelessly to accomplish as well.”\n\nThe award, made possible by a generous gift from Spendlove, recognizes a renowned scholar, author, artist or citizen who exemplifies, in their work, the delivery of social justice, diplomacy and tolerance in the diverse local and global society. The recipient serves as a role model and inspiration for students, faculty, staff and the community surrounding UC Merced.\n\nThe Spendlove Prize Selection Committee, which determines the recipient, is chaired by the dean of the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts and includes a representative from the Spendlove family or a designee, an undergraduate student, graduate student, faculty member and representatives from the UC Merced community.\n\nPast recipients of the prize include Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza, former President Jimmy Carter 1992, and Nobel Peace Prize winner Rigoberta Menchú, among several other high-profile figures.\n\nView the recording of the event\n\nWhile this year's ceremony looked quite different from years past due to the coronavirus pandemic, the presentation of the Alice and Clifford Spendlove Prize in Social Justice, Diplomacy and Tolerance remained an important celebration.\n\nAlicia Garza, author, civil rights activist and co-founder of #BlackLivesMatter and the Black Lives Matter Global Network, became the 13th recipient of the prestigious award during the virtual event on Tuesday, April 20.\n\nGarza was raised in the San Francisco Bay Area and graduated from UC San Diego with degrees in anthropology and sociology. She has spent the past few decades working to improve others' lives through various organizations including the National Domestic Workers Alliance, Supermajority and the Black Futures Lab, which she founded. The activist is a powerful voice in the media and frequently contributes opinion pieces and expert commentary on politics, race and other topics to major news outlets.\n\nTuesday's ceremony kicked off with remarks by Professor Nigel Hatton, with the Department of Literatures, Languages and Cultures at UC Merced, who described the award as a \"moral arc in the Valley\" and stated that the \"celebration of justice was alive even in a virtual event.\"\n\nAs Garza took the virtual podium, she made reference to the verdict in the Derek Chauvin trial. Just hours earlier, a jury in Minneapolis found the former police officer guilty of murder and manslaughter in the death of George Floyd.\n\n\"At this moment, while we're experiencing incredible, incredible victories that we did not think or see possible a year ago, five years ago, a decade ago, we still have a lot of work to do,\" Garza said.\n\nIn her discourse, Garza said she has worked to forge a new path, leaving behind the \"limited options that have been placed in front of us.\" This led her to declare \"Black Lives Matter,\" a phrase that grew from a social media post to an organization with chapters around the world. Now, she's calling on people to think about what kind of builders they will be and what they're building for the future.\n\n\"I believe that Black communities deserve to be powerful in every area of our lives, and we know that Black communities are indeed powerful,\" she said. \"It is Black communities that have shown this country what it is made of and what it can be if it, too, dares to be free.\n\n\"It is Black communities who have endured and Black communities who are innovators. We've persevered because of and despite all of the barriers that have been placed in our paths,\" she said. \"We are creators, visionaries, leaders, builders, fighters and winners - not because it's something that is inherent within us but because we've had to be.\"\n\nGarza took a moment to pay homage to her mother, who passed away three years ago. She said her mom taught her that the \"most important lessons in organizing and in building power - at the heart of it all, it's dignity and survival.\"\n\n\"Freedom is our birthright,\" Garza said. \"In my freedom dreams, we're building a new world where none of us get left behind.\"\n\nAs the event drew to a close, UC Merced Chancellor Juan Sánchez Muñoz called it a \"privilege\" and an \"honor\" to have the opportunity to listen to Garza's message. He went on to present this year's award, albeit virtually, to Garza, who expressed her gratitude and called it an \"incredible honor.\"\n\nThe Spendlove Prize was established at UC Merced in 2005 and is made possible by a generous gift from Merced native Sherrie Spendlove.\n\n\"This prize is named in honor of my parents, Alice and Clifford Spendlove, but it is also an elegy to the common man and woman - largely unsung heroes; people who work hard with honesty and integrity, with good will toward all people; people who have built and are continuing to build our community and our country - this is your prize too,\" Spendlove said during the event.\n\n\"UC Merced is deeply appreciative of Sherrie's generosity and the example that her family and parents have given us,\" Muñoz stated.\n\nThe Spendlove Prize Selection Committee, which is tasked with choosing the recipient, is chaired by the dean of the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts and includes a representative from the Spendlove family or a designee, an undergraduate student, a graduate student, a faculty member and representatives from the UC Merced community.\n\nThis year, the award committee was chaired by Dean Jeffrey Gilger and included Spendlove as family representative, Hatton as a member of the faculty and Lee Anderson and Charlie Bennet as members of the local community. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the undergraduate and graduate student positions were left vacant after the previous students departed.\n\nPast recipients of the Spendlove Prize include former President Jimmy Carter, 1992 Nobel Peace Prize winner Rigoberta Menchú Tum, civil rights activist John Y. Tateishi, Harvard Professor Charles Ogletree, Jr., 2016 Pulitzer Prize winning poet Peter Balakian, a leading voice of Armenian Genocide recognition, among many other high-profile national and international figures.\n\nView the recording of the virtual event\n\nNobel laureate Rigoberta Menchú Tum, recognized for her work in social and ethno-cultural reform, has been selected to receive the 2018 Alice and Clifford Spendlove Prize in Social Justice, Diplomacy and Tolerance at UC Merced.\n\n“Rigoberta Menchú is a perfect choice for the Spendlove Prize because she embodies so much of what UC Merced stands for — equality, justice, a place for the underserved and underrecognized, and opportunity despite adversity,” Chancellor Dorothy Leland said. “I greatly look forward to welcoming her to meet with our community of students, staff and faculty, as well as members of the Merced community, to share her important work and message.”\n\nMenchú Tum — who uses both names specifically to honor her parents — was born in Guatemala to a poor, indigenous peasant family and raised in a branch of the Mayan culture. Her family worked farms in the highlands and along the coast, picking coffee.\n\nThe 1992 Nobel Peace Prize winner also won the Prince of Asturias Award in 1998. She is the author of the autobiographical work “Crossing Borders.” Menchú Tum is a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador and ran for president of Guatemala in 2007 and 2011.\n\nShe has a long life of service to social justice, dating back to when she was a teenager, when she joined social reform activities through the Catholic Church and became prominent in the women's rights movement.\n\nHer work drew attention and opposition. Her family was accused of taking part in guerrilla activities and Menchú Tum’s father was imprisoned and tortured. After his release, he joined the Committee of the Peasant Union, as did she. That year, her brother was arrested, tortured and killed by the army, and the following year, her father was killed when security forces in the capital stormed the Spanish Embassy where he and other peasants were staying. Shortly after, her mother died after being arrested, tortured and raped. Menchú Tum became increasingly active in the CUC, and taught herself English, Spanish and Mayan languages other than her native tongue.\n\nShe helped lead farm-worker strikes and demonstrations, and as part of the radical group 31st of January Popular Front, she helped teach the indigenous peasant population to resist massive military oppression.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Menchú Tum went into hiding and Guatemala and fled to Mexico, becoming an organizer to resist oppression in Guatemala and advocating for indigenous peoples’ rights. She helped found the United Representation of the Guatemalan Opposition and joined the National Coordinating Committee of the CUC.\n\nHer work drew the attention of the Spendlove Prize Committee, which selects honorees from among scholars, authors, artists or other citizens who exemplify, through their work, the delivery of social justice, diplomacy and tolerance in the diverse local and global society.\n\nCampus friend Sherrie Spendlove established the prize in 2005 through a gift to the university in honor of her parents, lifelong Merced residents Alice and Clifford Spendlove, who dedicated their lives to education and public service.\n\n“The Spendloves left us a legacy that exalts education through their teachings,” Menchú Tum said. “It is an honor for me to be part of this legacy that will continue to illuminate future generations.”\n\nMenchú Tum’s work has earned her recognition across the Western Hemisphere generally and several international awards, including the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nShe also narrated a film about the struggles of the Maya called “When the Mountains Tremble” and is the subject of a book entitled “I, Rigoberta Menchú.”\n\nShe returns sometimes to Guatemala to plead the cause of the indigenous peasants, but death threats keep her in exile.\n\n“Rigoberta Menchú is a courageous crusader, at great personal peril, for basic human rights for her people — the indigenous populations of Guatemala. She has campaigned against the cruelty, greed and ignorance of those in power who deny them the basic right to exist, to eat, work and live,” Spendlove said. “The government authorities have done this by the theft of their native land, the destruction of the natural ecosystem upon which their civilization depends, by the mass murder and widespread rape and torture of the indigenous population, and by wiping out entire families and communities, their centuries-long traditions and their entire way of life.”\n\nMenchú is in good company with past Spendlove Prize recipients, including Native American activist and author Winona LaDuke; Professor Anita Hill, attorney and professor of social policy, law and women's studies; slain Civil Rights activist Viola Gregg Liuzzo; Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Peter Balakian; California Supreme Court Justice Cruz Reynoso; President Jimmy Carter; Sara O’Meara and Yvonne Fedderson, who founded Childhelp USA; Jonathan D. Jansen, South Africa's first black dean; Professor Faye J. Crosby, an expert in inclusiveness, gender, race and affirmative action at UC Santa Cruz; John Y. Tateishi, the leader of the successful struggle for reparations for Japanese-American internees; and Charles Ogletree, Jr., a Merced native, Harvard Law School professor, social justice and ethics expert and constitutional law scholar.\n\n“An internationally-recognized spokesperson and ambassador for human rights, Rigoberta Menchú has dedicated her entire life to the defense and support of indigenous people and women,” School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts (SSHA) Dean Jill Robbins said. “She is an inspiring world leader, one who embodies the values that the Spendlove Prize seeks to recognize.”\n\nRobbins leads the Spendlove Prize Selection Committee, which includes Sherrie Spendlove, an undergraduate student; a graduate student; a faculty member; and representatives from the UC Merced community. The Prize includes a $10,000 award.\n\nMenchú Tum will accept her award at a public ceremony beginning at 6 p.m. Nov. 5 at the Merced Theater, and will deliver a keynote address. She will also spend time with students on campus that day, as well as attending a private reception with Chancellor Leland, among others."
