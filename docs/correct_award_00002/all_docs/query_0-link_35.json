        "text": "Former US President Jimmy Carter has been named the recipient of the Nobel peace prize for 2002.The Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded the Georgia-born statesman this year’s honour for “his decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development”.\n\nThe Committee cites Carter’s mediation between Israel and Egypt – “in itself a great enough achievement to qualify” for the award – during his 1977-1981 presidency as one reason behind his selection. “At a time when the cold war between East and West was still dominant, he placed renewed emphasis on the place of human rights in international politics.”\n\nHis not-for-profit Carter Center, which is now in its 20th year, is based on the slogan “waging peace, fighting disease, building hope”. Famed for his decades of work with Habitat For Humanity, which uses volunteers to build and renovate housing throughout the world, he has most recently gained admiration for his efforts to bring about economic progress in developing countries. In May, he made a groundbreaking visit to Cuba in an effort to persuade the US to end its 40-year economic embargo against the country.\n\nThere were a record 156 candidates nominated this year, ranging from Afghan President Hamid Karzai for his work in rebuilding Afghanistan, to musician Bono, who has been a high-profile activist for famine and development in Africa.\n\nPresident Carter joins a prestigious list of previous peace prize winners chosen by the five-member committee, including former South African President Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama and Mother Teresa.\n\nSign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage\n\nEmail Address\n\nBy entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
