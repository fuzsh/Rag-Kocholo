        "text": "Former President Jimmy Carter joined Diane as a guest on The Diane Rehm Show 12 times over the years.\n\nTheir first interview took place in January 1993. Bill Clinton was about to take office and Carter had just published his seventh book, “Turning Point,” chronicling his first campaign for elected office.\n\nThat day, Diane and Carter covered how he got his start in politics, his relationship with the press, and why he says it sometimes takes more courage to maintain peace than to send troops into battle.\n\nNow, with Jimmy Carter receiving hospice care at his home in Georgia, Diane recalled her many conversations with Carter and what made him one of her favorite guests:\n\nOver the years I had the chance to interview President Jimmy Carter more than 10 times. We talked about his faith, his rural childhood, his triumphs and challenges as president, and his work as a global humanitarian after his years in the White House.\n\nHe was always kind, warm, gracious, funny and thoughtful. But what made him such an interesting person to talk to was that he never stopped learning, never stopped evolving. You could see this in how he approached the issues he cared about: housing and homelessness, the peace process in the Middle East, and international health, to name a few."
