        "text": "In the hundred and one years since the Nobel Peace Prize was first awarded, the Norwegian Nobel Committee has given it to citizens of the United States eighteen times. When Jimmy Carter travels to Oslo in December to collect his medal and his check, he’ll make it nineteen. In Nobel Peace Prizes, as in so much else, America is No. 1.\n\nThe Americans are an interesting group. They include five Secretaries of State and one Vice-President, Charles G. Dawes (1925). As was widely noted last week, Carter is the third Peace Prize President, after Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson. T.R., the boisterous, big-stick Rough Rider, was the first American winner, in 1906, for bringing representatives of Japan and Russia to a retreat in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and keeping them there until they agreed to end the Russo-Japanese War.\n\nT.R.’s feat in New Hampshire foreshadowed Carter’s in Maryland, where, in 1978, he wheedled Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin into signing the Camp David Accords. There has been peace, albeit a cold peace, between Egypt and Israel ever since. This, the Norwegian committee said the other day in its announcement of the award to Carter, was “in itself a great enough achievement to qualify for the Nobel Peace Prize.” The lands of Israel and Palestine have been anything but peaceful in the past two years; still, as a senior official in the office of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon told the Times, the treaty Carter brokered “is still the basic building block for any future peace agreement between Israel and the Arab world.”\n\nThe Nobel Committee did not mention Carter’s other great diplomatic achievement as President, the Panama Canal treaties, but it probably should have. In negotiating the transfer of the canal’s management to the Panamanians, Carter was taking up a task that Presidents Johnson, Nixon, and Ford had regarded as strategically essential but politically toxic. They were right on both counts. Holding on to the canal would have guaranteed an indeterminate future of violence, sabotage, regional instability, and perhaps even guerrilla war. The campaign against Carter’s “giveaway” became the organizing and fund-raising engine that propelled its leader, Ronald Reagan, to the forefront of the Republican Party. Reagan insisted that the treaties would be a mortal threat to American security. Once in the White House, he wisely consigned such nonsense to the memory hole. Today, the Panama Canal is about as much of a flash point as the Gowanus Canal.\n\nCarter has as much or more in common with the private citizens among the American laureates as he does with the high officials. Like Jane Addams (1931), the pioneering Chicago social worker, Carter, in his house-building work for Habitat for Humanity, has labored on behalf of the poor, face to face and with his own hands. Like Elihu Root (1912), the first president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Carter heads a “non-governmental organization.” (But while Carnegie is a think tank, the Carter Center is more of a do tank.) Like Norman E. Borlaug (1970), the agronomist who spurred the “Green Revolution,” Carter has made concrete improvements in the lives of the Third World’s poorest, via the Carter Center’s unglamorous, little-known, and successful programs for the control of river blindness and the eradication of guinea-worm disease.\n\nThe chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee had the ill grace to tell the press that the award to Carter should be interpreted as a rebuke to President Bush, whose policy toward Iraq Carter has criticized. The controversy points to another stone in the mosaic of American laureates: protest. Linus Pauling (1962), the chemist and nuclear-test-ban advocate, Jody Williams (1997), the anti-land-mine campaigner, and, above all, Martin Luther King, Jr. (1964), were dissenting outsiders. In a small way, Carter partakes of that tradition, too.\n\nExcept for his fellow service-academy graduate Dwight Eisenhower, no President of the twentieth century spent more years in uniform than Carter. Yet it is fair to say, as John O’Sullivan, of National Review, wrote the other day, that “Carter waged war like a pacifist.” (O’Sullivan was referring to the aborted mission to rescue the Americans held hostage in Iran throughout 1980.) But Carter, both as President and as an ex-President, has also waged peace like a warrior. We customarily admire a certain ruthlessness in the makers of war—a willingness to do what is necessary, a recognition that moral purity is ultimately impossible in a fallen world, an understanding that ends sometimes really do justify means. “Carter has put in more amiable sofa time with more despots than anyone,” a commentator sneered in print last week. And it’s probably true. But if flattering a tyrant is what it takes to manipulate him into ceding power peacefully, releasing a few political prisoners, or agreeing to a ceasefire, then Carter is willing to do what it takes. And the only casualty is the esteem in which he is held by the armchair generals of the op-ed brigade.\n\nCarter has been driving the conservative punditocracy to distraction for a quarter of a century. The demonologists of the right have a long litany of grievances against him. As President, he called on Americans to free themselves from an “inordinate fear of Communism.” But he was expressing skepticism about Communism’s appeal, not indifference to its villainy. He was more prescient than the “realists” who, as late as 1989, were dismissing glasnost as a hoax designed to lull the West into lowering its guard. He pronounced himself surprised at the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. (And it was surprising: never before had the Soviets overrun a country beyond the Red Army’s stopping point in 1945.) But it was Carter who, for good and for ill, first extended aid to the Afghan resistance. Carter’s human-rights crusade vexed some of America’s authoritarian allies. But, as Vaclav Havel has repeatedly pointed out, it also demoralized the apparatchiks, and heartened the dissidents, of Eastern Europe. As a freelance diplomatic meddler, Carter has given no less offense. For example, earlier this year, “he became the first U.S. ex-President to pay homage to Fidel Castro in Havana,” as the Post put it last week. But that’s not how the island’s dissidents saw his public dressing-down of the maximum leader. Carter has often erred; anyway, no one could be right as consistently as he has sometimes seemed to think himself. (The secular humanists who worked for him in the White House, including the undersigned, did not regard his initials as coincidental.) But Jimmy Carter honors the Nobel Peace Prize as surely as it honors him. ♦"
