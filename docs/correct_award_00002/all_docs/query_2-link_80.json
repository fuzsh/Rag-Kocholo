        "text": "Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter's legacy goes back almost half a century. His environmental contributions are as much a part of his legacy as his widespread volunteerism with Habitat for Humanity.\n\nThe former president began volunteering with the organization in 1984 during a build in Americus, GA. Later that year, he, his wife Rosalynn, and a few volunteers they recruited assisted the organization in New York City.\n\nHe walked by the work site and realized they were short on volunteers. The selfless act contributed to 19 families having apartment housing.\n\nBefore that, Carter used his time as the United States' 39th president to advocate new environmental laws. With his contributions to Habitat for Humanity, Carter has one of the most selfless legacies in American history.\n\nKeep reading to learn more about his contributions.\n\nJimmy Carter and the Carter Work Project\n\nFormer President Jimmy Carter and his wife have been strong voices for affordable housing for almost four decades. Their endeavors have expanded around the globe alongside Habitat for Humanity.\n\nThey've worked alongside over 100,000 volunteers in at least fourteen countries. Their efforts have helped provide housing and home repairs to families who otherwise wouldn't be able to gain or sustain homeownership.\n\nIt's estimated that Jimmy Carter contributed to at least 4,300 homes.\n\nResiliency and Commitment\n\nCarter's legacy also speaks to his resiliency. Back in 2019, former President Jimmy Carter, at the age of 95, fell during a home build. He sustained an injury requiring fourteen stitches, leaving him with a bruised eye.\n\nThe mishap didn't stop him from honoring his commitment for the following day. To the surprise of many, he arrived in Nashville ready to lend a hand at the following site.\n\nHis resiliency that day matched his commitment to the organization he had maintained since the 1980s.\n\nSolving Environmental Issues\n\nCreating sustainable housing for everyone involves new environmental laws and eco-friendly solutions. During his presidency, Jimmy Carter's ecological contributions included implementing the Department of Energy.\n\nHe used his executive power in Alaska to save 56 million acres of public land by using the 1906 Antiquities Act. His love for Alaska continued long after his term as president.\n\nIn 1988, Carter wrote his memoir, \"An Outdoor Journal: Adventures and Reflections.\" In the book, he discusses the importance of preserving the earth for future generations.\n\nHis eco-friendly projects during his presidency included installing solar panels at the White House.\n\nLegacy\n\nRegarding legacy, former President Jimmy Carter will be remembered as many things. The list includes a humanitarian, recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize twice, and a selfless volunteer.\n\nHis contributions to Habitat for Humanity are cemented in the fibers of every home he touched. He motivated many people to join our volunteer ranks and helped make the road to homeownership easier for many people."
