        "text": "Intense heat, floods, cyclones and other disasters add to the challenges for millions of displaced people. Three women detail how they struggle to cope. Displaced by wars, ethnic conflict and, increasingly, climate change, the number of refugees worldwide climbed to an estimated 117 million at the end of last year, according to the U.N. high commissioner for refugees. Millions of them end up in camps in nations that, according to a study last year, “are also among the countries most vulnerable to climate variability.”\n\nAlayna Cowan, a college student in Savannah, Ga., learned about the attempted assassination of Donald Trump from a news alert on her phone. Then she saw was a TikTok edit — a video splicing different clips together — featuring images of President Biden talking about trying to reach Trump after the event set to the lovesick Chappel Roan song “Casual.” As she scrolled, she saw video after video in the same vein: The point was that there is no point. Social media platforms were flooded with dark humor in the aftermath of the shooting. Some expressed glee, disappointment or grief at the attempted assassination of Trump, but many were apolitical, poking fun at mainstream reactions or U.S. presidential politics in general.\n\nBreaking news: Former House speaker Nancy Pelosi has told some House Democrats she believes President Biden can be convinced fairly soon to exit the presidential race amid serious doubts he can win in November, according to three Democratic officials.\n\nAs the summer movies season gets underway, it will feature hits and duds. While most people will watch the top movies, others will actively seek out the flops. The list of bad quality movies infamously includes “The Room,” “Sharknado” and “Cocaine Bear.” This phenomenon seems to run counter to intuitions about human decision-making. “Human behavior is complicated. And even things that seem obvious, like people are going to choose the things that they think are better than the things they think are worse, are not always the case,” said Caleb Warren, a professor of marketing at the University of Arizona who studies a related phenomenon of ironic consumption.\n\nA wave of Silicon Valley leaders has publicly lined up behind Donald Trump since Saturday’s assassination attempt — including some who had previously denounced the former president or supported his rivals — cementing a political shift in the tech world years in the making. In recent months, many tech elites quietly latched onto Trump, the perceived front-runner, drawn by Trump’s promises of industry-friendly policies on cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence and driven away from President Biden by scrutiny of the sector they see as kneecapping innovation. But since the shooting in Butler, Pa., tech leaders have enfolded Trump in a very public embrace.\n\nA summer covid wave has washed over most of the United States, bringing yet another round of gatherings turned into superspreaders, vacations foiled by illness and reminders that pandemic life has not been fully erased. Not even President Biden was spared. In a July 7 campaign event in Pennsylvania, Biden contrasted himself against Donald Trump by declaring, “I ended the pandemic — he didn’t.”\n\nFormer president Barack Obama has told allies in recent days that President Biden’s path to victory has greatly diminished and he thinks the president needs to seriously consider the viability of his candidacy. Obama has spoken with Biden only once since the debate, and he has been clear in his conversations with others that the future of Biden’s candidacy is a decision for the president to make. He has emphasized that his concern is protecting Biden and his legacy, and has pushed back against the idea that he alone can influence Biden’s decision-making process."
