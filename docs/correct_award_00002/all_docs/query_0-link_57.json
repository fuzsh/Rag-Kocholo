        "text": "The award of the Nobel Peace Prize to ex-President Jimmy Carter sparked a major flap yesterday when the committee chairman said the choice was a direct slap in the face for President Bush.\n\nOther members of the five-person Nobel committee immediately jumped into the controversy, accusing chairman Gunnar Berge of going too far after announcing the award in Oslo, Norway.\n\nWith the position Carter has taken against attacking Saddam Hussein without U.N. approval, Berge said, the award “can and must also be seen as criticism of the line the current U.S. administration has taken on Iraq.”\n\nBerge, a former Norwegian cabinet minister, was then asked if the prize was a “kick in the leg” at the Bush administration.\n\n“Yes, the answer is an unconditional yes,” Berge said.\n\nA “kick in the leg” is a Norwegian phrase meaning “a slap in the face.”\n\nTwo committee members immediately took issue with Berge.\n\nInger-Marie Ytterhorn said Berge had acted “unprofessionally” in going beyond the official citation, which only made a veiled reference to Iraq.\n\nHanna Kvanmo agreed, saying: “In the committee, we didn’t discuss what sort of interpretation of the grounds there should be. It wasn’t a topic.”\n\nBerge defended his criticism, saying, “I expressed myself as leader of the committee, not on behalf of all of the members.”\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer sidestepped the issue.\n\n“The president thinks this is a great day for Jimmy Carter and that’s what he’s going to focus on,” he said.\n\nCarter declined to comment on Berge’s criticism, but said he would have voted “no” on the House and Senate resolutions allowing the president to use force against Iraq.\n\nBut Carter said he felt the Bush administration had come a long way from earlier threats to attack Iraq unilaterally.\n\nCarter, a Democrat who was president from 1977 to 1981, won the $1 million prize for decades of work to resolve conflicts from the Middle East to North Korea, and from Haiti to Eritrea. The five-member prize committee praised the 78-year-old for “decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development.”\n\nCarter came close to winning the award in 1978 when Israel’s Menachem Begin and Egypt’s Anwar Sadat shared the prize for a peace pact he brokered at Camp David."
