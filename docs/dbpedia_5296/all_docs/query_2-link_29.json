Presenters at the conference included BYU President Cecil O. Samuelson, BYU faculty members, dean of Baylor University‚Äôs Honors College Thomas S.

In his article ‚ÄúLegal Insights into the Organization of the Church in 1830,‚Äù David Keith Stott shares his research on the question of whether or not the LDS Church was actually incorporated at its founding.
