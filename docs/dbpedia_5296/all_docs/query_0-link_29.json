Using principles from Martin Luther King, Jr. about dialogue on race, Whitaker argues for the need for greater dialogue to overcome the past.\n\nMormons & Lineage: The Complicated History of Blacks & Patriarchal Blessings, 1830–2018\n\nDialogue 51.3 (Fall 2018): 83–129\n\nThe priesthood revelation of 1978 eased some of the tension when the apostles affirmed that Blacks could now be “adopted into the House of Israel” as full participants in Mormon liturgical rites. But this doctrinal shift did not resolve the vexing question of whether or not Black people derived from the “seed of Cain.”\n\nLooking Back, Looking Forward: “Mormonism’s Negro Doctrine” 45 Years Later\n\nIt has been forty-five years since Dialogue published Bush’s essay entitled “Mormonism’s Negro Doctrine: An Historical Overview”2 and forty years since Official Declaration 2 ended the priesthood/temple ban.\n\nRemember Me: Discursive Needlework and the Sewing Sampler of Patty Bartlett Sessions\n\nThomas Aquinas Meets Joseph Smith: Toward a Mormon Ethics of Natural Law\n\nThe Word of Wisdom in Contemporary American Mormonism: Perceptions and Practice\n\nAuthority and Priesthood in the LDS Church, Part 2: Ordinances, Quorums, Nonpriesthood Authority, Presiding, Priestesses, and Priesthood Bans\n\nDialogue 51.1 (Spring 2018): 167–180\n\nIn the prequel to this article, I discussed in general contours the dual nature of authority—individual and institutional—and how the modern LDS concept of priesthood differs significantly from the ancient version in that it has become an abstract form of authority that can be “held” (or withheld, as the case might be).\n\nThe Darkest Abyss in America\n\nThy mind, O man! if thou wilt lead a soul unto salvation, must stretch as high as the utmost heavens, and search into and contemplate the darkest abyss, and the broad expanse of eternity—thou must…\n\nYearning for Notoriety: Questionable and False Claimants to America’s Worst Emigrant Massacre\n\nA History of Two Stories: Women of Covenant: The Story of Relief Society\n\nPreparation for the Kingdom | Milton V.

The recent article by Professor Dallin H. Oaks[1] is a prudent, well researched attempt to deal with one…\n\nMormonism and American Religion | Clifton E. Olmstead, History of Religion in the United States, and Winthrop S. Hudson, Religion in America\n\nIn a sense this review can be termed an attempt to make much of fairly little, for the amount of space devoted to Mormonism in each of these works is very small — six pages…\n\nBrigham Young and the American Economy | Jonathan Hughes, The Vital Few: American Economic Progress and Its Protagonists\n\nJonathan Hughes has written a spritely book about those men, the vital few in American history, who have had a major impact on our economic growth. Brigham Young is selected as one of them. Hughes,…\n\nThoughts on Anti-Intellectualism: A Response\n\nWhenever a young Mormon intellectual attempts to discuss anti-intellectualism within his Church, especially in the broad, 166-year historical context attempted by Professor Bitton, it seems to me that he is faced with at least three…\n\nAnti-Intellectualism in Mormon History\n\nAlmost from its beginning Mormonism was disparaged as funda mentally superstitious and irrational, with an appeal only for the poor and uneducated. Even before the description of Joseph Smith as “ignorant” and “illiterate” by the…\n\nThe Life of Brigham Young: A Biography Which Will Not Be Written\n\nOn Sunday morning, October 5, 1856, Brigham Young stood before thousands of Mormons in Salt Lake City, to open the semi annual conference of the Church. During the morning he spoke twice. His very first…\n\nFederal Authority Versus Polygamic Theocracy: James B. McKean and the Mormons, 1870-1875\n\nDialogue 5.3 (Fall 1966): 85–100\n\nDuring the years of the Utah Territory, outsiders got appointed to the terrority to serve in various positions. For the most part, these Gentiles weren’t sympathetic towards the church, and one of the more famous outsiders is Chief Justice James B. McKean who tried to crack down on plural marriage.\n\nThe Metamorphosis of the Kingdom of God: Toward a Reinterpretation of Mormon History\n\nPolygamy, contrary to popular opinion, probably seduced few men into the seraglio that was Mormonism in the mind of a prurient, Victorian America. Yet it lured several generations of historians — not to speak of…\n\nWriting the Mormon Past\n\nDialogue 1.3 (Fall 1966): 47–62\n\nUnderstanding Mormon history involves appreciating some of the formidable obstacles which confront throse who seek to write it. There is still sensitivity among Mormons to probing that might bring embarrassment to cherished offical views of Latter-day Saint orgins, martyrs, or heroes.\n\nThe Significance of Joseph Smith’s “First Vision” in Mormon Thought\n\nDialogue 1.3 (Fall 1966): 29–46\n\nIn this early article, Allen shows that the First Vision was not well known during Joseph Smith’s lifetime. It became well known after the Prophet’s death, which is when missionaries started to teach about it for the first time.\n\nIntroduction: The Future of Mormonism\n\nPreface The articles in this section reveal the strength and vibrancy of current Mormon historiography. In December, 1965, in connection with the meetings of the American Historical Association at San Francisco, approximately 100 Mormon historians,…\n\nEarly Mormon Churches in Utah: A Photographic Essay\n\nThe following photographs are geographically and, I believe, architecturally representative of early Mormon churches in Utah.

Foner, The Case of Joe Hill\n\nLegends often live on simply because believers like them. Some people like them so much they want to prove them. Legends may have their origins in real situations and may have relationships to some facts,…\n\nChrist Without the Church: The Challenge of Dietrich Bonhoeffer\n\nOn August 24, 1932, Dietrich Bonhoeffer began an address at the International Youth Conference in Glad, Switzerland, with the words, “The Church is Dead.”[1] Today, 1966, Bonhoeffer is dead, yet the church lives.

Eldon Tanner of the First Presidency, who accepted them on behalf of…\n\nThe Facsimile Found: The Recovery of Joseph Smith’s Papyrus Manuscripts: A Conversation with Professor Atiya\n\nDialogue 2.4 (Winter 1967)51– 54.\n\nAlthough not a member of the Church, Dr. Atiya for many years had cherished his Latter-day Saint friends and is well informed about Church beliefs. He is aware of the history of the papyri and their relationship to the Book of Abraham in the Pearl of Great Price and is acquainted with the three facsimiles.\n\nSome Reflections on the Kingdom and the Gathering in Early Mormon History\n\nDialogue 9.1 (Spring 1976): 34–42\n\nHistorical studies embrace the most extensive, intensive, and well-matured of the scholarly endeavors which have the Restoration as their subject. The paucity of critical writings in the various fields of theology and philosophy is by comparison especially striking.\n\nLearning to Lead | Kent Lloyd, Kendall Price, V. Dallas Merrell, and Ellsworth Johnson, The Church Executive, and Paul H. Dunn, The Ten Most Wanted Men\n\nThe Church Executive is a report (also summarized in the Winter 1967 issue of Dialogue) of a seminar (workshop training program) conducted by three weeks, they hoped to see the stake presidents achieve the following:…\n\nOn the Mormon Trail | Alma P.

Some may feel that his wide ranging…\n\nThe Joseph Smith Egyptian Papyri: Translations and Interpretations: Phase One\n\nDialogue 3.2 (Summer 1968)101 – 105\n\nEven a casual reading of the Book of Abraham shows that the story refers not so much to unique historic events as to ritual forms and traditions—all these must be checked. So far we have heard what is wrong or at least suspect about the Book of Abraham, but as yet nobody has cared to report on the other side of the picture. It is for that we are saving our footnotes.\n\nThe Joseph Smith Egyptian Papyri: Translations and Interpretations: The Book of Breathings\n\nDialogue 3.2 (Summer 1968)98\n\nTHE BOOK OF BREATHINGS (FRAGMENT I, THE “SENSEN” TEXT, WITH RESTORATIONS FROM LOUVRE PAPYRUS 3284) translated by Richard A.

Meanwhile, it is significant for the Reorganized Church that undue haste and overzealous faith did not move it in the nineteenth century to canonize this work of Joseph Smith, Jr., primarily on the basis that it was accomplished by Joseph Smith, Jr.\n\nThe Joseph Smith Egyptian Papyri: Translations and Interpretations: The Joseph Smith Papyri: A Preliminary Report\n\nDialogue 3.2 (Summer 1968):86 – 88\n\nThe papyri need to be carefully cleaned and straightened and then rephotographed with care to illuminate the under side somewhat to eliminate all shadows in cracks and breaks, which can frequently look just like writing.\n\nThe Joseph Smith Egyptian Papyri: Translations and Interpretations: A Summary Report\n\nDialogue 3.2 (Summer 1968):67 – 85\n\nThe Joseph Smith Egyptian papyri once consisted of at least six separate documents, possibly eight or more.\n\nThe Search for Truth and Meaning in Mormon History\n\nThe philosopher Plato, to whom dialogue was the highest expression of intellectuality, denned thought as “the dialogue of the soul with itself.” It is thus altogether fitting that the editors of Dialogue should encourage Mormon…\n\nJoseph Smith as a Student of Hebrew\n\nDialogue 3.2 (Summer 1968): 41–55\n\nZucker describes the efforts that Joseph Smith went through to study Hebrew. Joseph Smith’s personal behavior was apparently not changed, but in other aspects in later years there is evidence that Joseph Smith was using Hebrew language structure\n\nMrs. Brodie and Joseph Smith | F. L. Stewart, Exploding the Myth about Joseph Smith, the Mormon Prophet\n\nDialogue 3.3 (Fall 1968): 142–145\n\nIn response to Fawn Brodies’s biography of Joseph Smith, F.L. Stewart published a book called Exploding the Myth About Joseph Smith, the Mormon Prophet.\n\nA Mirror for Mormon’s | Richard F. Burton, The City of the Saints\n\nA superlative is an automatic challenge, and when Mrs. Brodie calls City of the Saints “the best book on the Mormons published during the nineteenth century,” my impulse is to disprove it. At surface glance…\n\nOne Man’s Utah | Wayne Stout, History of Utah\n\nThe writing of history is fraught with difficulties because the historian has no direct access to the past. Through newspapers, diaries, journals, and public documents prior events may be glimpsed as shadows, but even then…\n\nWhose Victory? | W. Cleon Skousen, Fantastic Victory: Israel’s Rendezvous with Destiny\n\nFantastic Victory is without a doubt the most ambitious attempt by any “Mormon scholar” to set the recent Arab—Israeli conflict into some perspec tive. Cleon Skousen, in the amazingly short period of less than three…\n\nA Translation of the Apparent Source of the Book of Abraham\n\nThe speed with which photographs of the Joseph Smith Egyptian Papyri were published once they came into the possession of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a gratifying contrast to the secrecy with which their previous custodians surrounded them. The definitive edition of the documents will take time, but in the meantime the Egyptologist can show his appreciation by taking advantage of the opportunity to make preliminary studies.\n\nMormons in the Executive Suite\n\nOnly in a city can a full cast of characters for the human drama be assembled; hence only in the city is there sufficient diversity and competition to enliven the plot and bring the performers up to the highest pitch…\n\nArt and the Church\n\nIt is through the performance of creative arts, in art, in thought in personal relationships that the city can be identified as something more than a purely functional organization . . . Lewis Mumford Perhaps it is presumptuous to…\n\nManhattan Faces\n\nIf you like fresh air, 25¢ hamburgers, and security, New York may not be the place for you. If you want a Rinso-clean wash you can hang in the backyard, where crickets sound at night, and neighbors who are people much like you, the city probably isn’t your bag.\n\nMormons as City Planners\n\n. . . one key to urban development should be plain—it lies in the widening of the circle of those capable of participating in it, till in the end all men will take part in the conversation.

But the tourist boom means the same thing in Utah that it means in Vermont, the same thing it means wherever the past has been piously “restored,” roped off, and put on display—not the vitality but the decadence of a way of life.\n\nSuch is the devastating indictment of Mormonism by Christopher Lasch in the January 26, 1967, New York Review of Books\n\nB.H. Roberts as an Historian\n\nIn 1930, when B. H. Roberts published his six-volume Comprehensive History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, learned journals were silent. But he himself, with pardonable pride, had described his work as “monumental.” One Mormon, answering Bernard De Voto’s contemptuous description of Utah as an intellectual desert, hailed Roberts as “another Gibbon.” Although hyperbolic, the favorable judgment was in general well deserved….\n\nMormons and Psychiatry\n\nAmong many Mormons there exists a genuine distrust of psychiatry. Apprehensions arise partly from misconceptions about psychotherapy and partly from a stigma that many attach to anything associated with emotional disorders. Many believe “If you live your religion, you won’t need a psychiatrist.” For many, to visit a psychiatrist would be to admit emotional and spiritual failure. Mormons might enter psychotherapy with not only the usual fears and anxieties concerning an unknown experience that lies ahead…\n\nIncome and Membership Projections for the Church Through the Year 2000\n\nIt is currently fashionable to look ahead to see what the future is likely to be, and, if what is seen is unsatisfactory, to consider alternative futures and means necessary to achieve them.

These are “Joseph Smith’s Egyptian Papyri” numbers 1, 10 and 11, and the three Facsimiles of the Pearl of Great Price. But these are enough. I have glued them to a roll of paper 10×150 centimeters long (according to Doctor Baer’s indications), and I have a pretty good idea of what PJS (as I shall call this document) must have looked like before it broke into pieces over a century ago.\n\nToward a History of Ancient America\n\nDialogue 4.2 (Summer 1971): 65–68\n\nIf there is no history of ancient Antarctica, there is a valid reason for it.

Taggart’s Mormonism’s Negro Policy: Social and Historical Origins\n\nDialogue 4.4 (Winter 1969): 86–103\n\nLester E Bush wrote in response to Stephen G Taggart’s book which the author tried to show that the Church came from abololonist ideas because the Church was orginially founded in New York, but when they encountered pro slavery settlers in Missouri and faced the hostiltiy from the settlers early church leaders apparently changed their mind, even though Joseph Smith eventually did a turnabout from what records have shown regarding African Americans.\n\nThe Secular Relevance of the Gospel | Hugh W.

McKay: 1873-1970: President McKay As a Neighbor\n\nMy grandfather used to say “There’s lots and lots of ‘man-ism’ in Mor monism.” Often we see President McKay and we think and talk of him as the prophet.

By Fawn Brodie\n\nDialogue 5.3 (Fall 1970): 96–99\n\nMarvin S Hill was responding to Fawn Brodie’s lecture at the Hotel Utah in 1970 called “Can We Manipulate the Past?” Her point in giving it was she was claiming that the people in charge only emphasize the points of history that fit their gains. She then compared that to Church Leaders only focusing on Joseph Smith’s early attitudes towards slavery, but then she claimed that Church Leaders didn’t focus on the fact that in the future he changed his mind regarding Slavery and became more against it, kind of like Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson. Marvin S Hill kept mentioning that she overlooked certain aspects.\n\nThe Coming of the Manifesto\n\nDialogue 5.3 (Fall 1970): 11–25\n\nGodfrey describes the steps leading to Wilford Woodruff issuing the First Manifesto.\n\nThe Lesson of Coalville\n\nAs suggested in the preceding discussions, the confrontations surrounding the destruction of the Coalville Tabernacle were so devisive and frustrating that those involved on any side of the issue must have vowed to avoid similar…\n\nThe Last Days of the Coalville Tabernacle\n\nSurely if it be worthwhile troubling ourselves about the works of art of today, of which any amount almost can be done, since we are yet alive, it is worthwhile spending a little care, forethought,…\n\nA Comment on Joseph Smith’s Account of His First Vision and the 1820 Revival\n\nDialogue 6.1 (Spring 1971): 106–107\n\nEver since people first heard of the First Vision, the events surrounding it has been clouded by controversy.

What follows, therefore, are simply reflections on some problems which relate to the religious affirmations of the L.D.S. people and a tentative approach to my personal philosophy of history.\n\nThe Sterling M.

How were they understood?\n\nReligious Accommodation in the Land of Racial Democracy\n\nDialogue 17.3 (Fall 1984): 23–34\n\nBrazil, with a high concentration of African heritage, was a difficult place for the Church (because of the Church’s racial policy) to make headway among native members. Due to the high risk of Brazilians potentially having African ancestry, the Church came to the point where they eventually discouraged missionaries in Brazil from baptizing anyone who is known to have African ancestry.\n\nA Shaded View: Suribonnet Sisters: True Stories of Mormon Women and Frontier Life\n\nBleaker by the Dozen?: Life in Large Families: View of Mormon Women, by H.

Embry and Bradley make the argument that the daughters in a polygamous relationship pay attention to how their own mom is doing, which determines whether or not when they are older they enter into a polygamous relationship.\n\nWomen’s Response to Plural Marriage\n\nDialogue 18.3 (Fall 1985): 84–98\n\nMehr shares stories of polygamy in late 19th century and early 20th century. He especially focused on LDS women’s opinions of polygamy when they entered into polygamous relationsips.\n\nMormon Polyandry in Nauvoo\n\nDialogue 18.3 (Fall 1985): 67–83\n\nVan Wagoner defines polyandry as having two or more husbands at the same time.

I will venture a guess that many men who have the priesthood do not particularly want to hold it either, and that some of them also have no interest in passing the sacrament. But the reluctance of some men would hardly be a good reason to prevent all men from holding the priesthood.\n\nThe Ultimate Stegner Interview: Conversations with Wallace Stegner on Western History and Literature\n\nThe Benefits of Partisanship: Joseph Smith and the Beginnings of Mormonism by Richard L.

Sexual intercourse does have a place in Mormon heaven, though not as an end in itself. Heavenly residents are busy with activities. Those righteous individuals who become gods in Mormon heaven will certainly be using their intellects as they create worlds and keep them running, and they will undoubtedly be learning continuously.

John Gee has responded by claiming that our method is “anything but accurate” and that it “glaringly underestimates the length of the scroll.” He states that “Two different formulas have been published for estimating the original length of a scroll,” then attempts to show that “Hoffmann’s formula approximates the actual length of the papyrus,” whereas “Cook and Smith’s formula predicts a highly inaccurate length.” The fact is, the two formulas are completely equivalent. They are both exact expressions of an Archimedean spiral and they yield precisely the same results, if correctly applied.\n\nMormon Pulp with a Reading Group Guide David Ebershoff.
