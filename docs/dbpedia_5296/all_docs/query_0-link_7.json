        "text": "The Council of Fifty minutes reveal that Joseph Smith asked a committee to draft a replacement to the U.S. Constitution. The effort was eventually replaced by a revelation from God wherein the Prophet was told that the council itself was to be a living constitution. While the White Horse Prophecy is extremely suspect from a historical standpoint, the Prophet’s efforts to draft a new constitution are well-documented. Legal scholar Nathan B. Oman explains what was going on behind the scenes of the Council of Fifty.\n\nWhat were the primary factors behind the Council of Fifty’s constitution?\n\nThere were theological factors and practical factors being the Council of Fifty’s constitution. The theological factors had to do with an increasingly elaborate theology of the kingdom of God, which was tied to the expectation that the world was on the threshold of the last days. Latter-day Saints expected secular governments to fail and that religious community would form the nucleus of a divinely inspired government to replace them.\n\nPractically, the Latter-day Saints were facing rising persecution in the United States and needed a forum in which leaders could discuss plans to deal with that persecution—and ultimately to relocate beyond the then-borders of the United States.\n\nWhat did the Council of Fifty spend most of its time discussing?\n\nIt spent most of its time discussing practical and political matters related to the Latter-day Saint community, particularly plans to quit the United States and settle someplace in the western interior of North America.\n\nWhat assignment did the Council of Fifty give on March 11, 1844 to John Taylor, Willard Richards, William W. Phelps, and Parley P. Pratt?\n\nThis committee was tasked with composing a constitution for the kingdom of God.\n\nWhy did the Council of Fifty feel that a new constitution was necessary?\n\nIt’s not entirely clear. Mainly, one suspects that as Americans that members of the Council took it as axiomatic that any polity required a written constitution. There was no immediate practical problem to which the constitution would have been a solution.\n\nLikewise, there was no polity in existence or in the immediate future that would have required a written constitution.\n\nDid the Council of Fifty’s constitution model itself after another constitution?\n\nThe basic structure is modeled on the U.S. Constitution, which begins “We the people of the United States.” The draft constitution for the Kingdom of God began, “We the people of the Kingdom of God.”\n\nHowever, unlike most constitution-writing in the 19th century, the document did not copy extensively from an already functioning constitution.\n\n(This, for example, was the strategy taken a few years later when the Latter-day Saints drafted a proposed constitution for the State of Deseret.)\n\nRather, the document consisted of an imperfectly specified system of judges and a great deal of largely horotory language. In short, the document that they produced couldn’t possibly have been used to completely specify a set of actually functioning set of institutions.\n\nHow did the Council of Fifty constitution aspire to be a direct revelation from God?\n\nMuch of the document is written in the first person voice of God. The authors of the document assumed that only a government inspired by God could be wholly legitimate.\n\n(John Taylor would later explicitly argue for this position in a short book entitled The Government of God.)\n\nAccordingly, they felt that any constitution for the kingdom of God needed to be a revelation.\n\nDid the Council of Fifty committee feel like the draft was a revelation?\n\nThey did not. The Council of Fifty committee produced a draft but expressed doubts that they had fully captured the mind and will of God.\n\nWas the Council of Fifty’s constitution a blueprint for a functioning democracy?\n\nNo. The Council of Fifty’s constitution didn’t fully specify that institutional structures that would govern the kingdom of God and thus failed to work out the precise mechanics of how a democratically accountable but divinely inspired government—what Latter-day Saints at the time called theodemocracy—was supposed to work.\n\nWhy did Joseph Smith‘s Council of Fifty forgo its constitutional goals?\n\nJoseph Smith claimed to receive a revelation in which he stated that the council itself was the constitution of the kingdom of God. By this he seemed to have meant not so much the institutional structure of the council but rather its collective membership.\n\nHow did George Q. Cannon later describe the Council of Fifty’s attempt to draft a constitution?\n\nGeorge Q. Cannon later reinterpreted the constitution-making and constitution-revelation in the council of fifty not as a prelude to a Latter-day Saint political sovereignty but rather as being about the government of the church.1\n\nThe kingdom of god went from being an independent political entity to being a synonym for the church.\n\nWhat is the contemporary legacy of the Council of Fifty’s constitutional ideal?\n\nThe failure of the constitution writing in the Council of Fifty probably increased the political flexibility of the Latter-day Saints in the succeeding decades. This proved useful as they had to adapt themselves to rapidly changing legal and political circumstances.\n\nAbout Nathan Oman\n\nNathan Oman lives in Williamsburg, Virginia where he is the Rollins Professor at William & Mary Law School. He was educated at Brigham Young University and Harvard Law School. While at BYU, he developed an interest in Latter-day Saint legal history, a topic on which he has published several articles in law journals, BYU Studies, Journal of Mormon History, and Dialogue. In addition to law and religion, he enjoys running slowly, fishing badly, and playing the banjo wretchedly.\n\nFurther reading\n\nJoseph Smith Q&A\n\nJoseph Smith’s Political Missionaries\n\nJoseph Smith’s 1844 Presidential Campaign\n\nKnowing Brother Joseph\n\nLeonard Arrington: Diaries of a Latter-day Saint Historian\n\nCouncil of Fifty, Joseph Smith, and Constitution resources\n\nConstitution of the Council of Fifty Draft (Joseph Smith Papers)\n\n‘We the People of the Kingdom of God’: Constitution Writing in the Council of Fifty (Nathan B.
