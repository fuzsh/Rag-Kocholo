        "text": "From COACh Director, Geri Richmond\n\nJuly 7-28, 2020 COACh Workshops \"in\" Karnal Haryana, India on \"Career Advancement for Women in Science and Technology\" For several years now Prof. Pushpa Murthy (Michigan Tech University, USA) and I have been trying to make it to Shimla India to give COACh workshops. Dr. Punam K. Singh, Regional Director of the IGNOU Regional Centre in Karnal has been so patient and persistent in getting us to come. Then - COVID-19. So we shifted to two Zoom Sessions and they went great! We had women science and engineering faculty from the region. The first day we did a workshop on \"Women's Career Advancement and Leadership\" and the second day on \"Mentoring and Networking for Career Success in Science and Innovation\". Both went well with good audience participation. Attached are some pictures from the workshops as well as the flyer.\n\nHuge thanks to Dr. Punam for all the incredible work that she put into the event. It was great to also see again Prof. Lalita S. Kumar, Professor of Chemistry, School of Sciences, IGNOU, New Delhi at our event. Best wishes to all! We look forward to working with you on future events.\n\nCheers and thanks again,\n\nGeri and Pushpa\n\nAugust 14, 2020 COACh Virtual Workshop with Empowering Women in Organic Chemistry (EWOC) Event We were invited to be part of another fantastic event for women scientists working in organic chemistry sponsored by EWOC. I gave a fun workshop on \"Honing your Negotiation Skills for Positive Outcomes\" to a large number of women attending the event. Great questions and discussions. Thanks EWOC for including COACh again in your important work!\n\nJuly 7-28, 2020 2020 PEER Women in Science Mentoring Program Congratulations to the 36 women scientists from India, Indonesia and the Philippines on being chosen to participate in this special USAID PEER Program to Accelerate the End of Tuberculosis. This year, the program is supporting networks of female scientists conducting research on tools and approaches for preventing, detecting, and treating TB in specific countries in Asia. The goal of this program is to support cohorts of women in junior and senior faculty positions. For one year, the mentoring program allows time and space for cohorts of mentors and mentees to build personal and professional skills.\n\nAlthough originally scheduled to be held in Bangkok, the pandemic caused us to hold the program through a series of virtual sessions. I was fortunate to be asked to facilitate a series of 2 hour sessions held over the month of July with participants. During that time everyone got to know each other, learn about the research in tuberculosis that the women do and learn skills in mentoring. It is an amazing group and so much fun to work with. Big thanks to Lynette Lusenaka (NAS) and Lisa Patel (USAID) for inviting COACh to be part of this event. Lynette was part of the last mentoring workshop like this that was held in Rwanda last summer. As always, big thanks to COACh's Priscilla Lewis for electronically bringing us all together. Best wishes to all as you seek to make the world safer from TB.\n\nJune 23, 25, & 29, 2020 Center for Synthesizing Quantum Coherence Celeste Rohlfing and I virtually gave a series of sessions \"Mentoring for Success in Science and Innovation\" to graduate students and faculty involved in this NSF funded center that involves research groups from Duke University, University of Illinois, University of California, Berkeley and Northwestern University. COACh is happy to couple with centers and institutes as part of their Broader Impacts plan to help both their students and faculty as well as others in their departments. This was a lot of fun - with lots of discussion and break-out group activities.\n\nJune 16, 2020 WISE Women at Emory University Following up on my visit to Emory a few months ago when I gave a scientific lecture, Cassandra Zaremba who is a chemistry graduate student and Speaker Chair of their WISE Chapter invited me to give a virtual workshop on mentorship. While at Emory my schedule was too packed for me to fit in a COACh workshop so I was delighted to reconnect with the Emory WISE group to give the mentoring workshop virtually. Was a lot of fun! Happy Mentoring!\n\nMay 21, 2020 The COACh Reach is Amazing! A few weeks ago I was contacted by Claire Benjamin, the communication officer on a large international research project called Realizing Increased Photosynthetic Efficiency (RIPE). It seems that a Dr. TJ Higgins from CSIRO in Australia had gotten ahold of our COACh slides on \"Persuasive Scientific Presentations\" and wondered if they could use them to help train participants on how to give a good scientific presentation at their upcoming (now virtual) Annual International RIPE meeting in New Zealand. I was so thrilled that I offered to give the workshop virtually to interested participants and they took me up on the offer. Knowing that everyone is getting zoomed to death these days, I modified the workshop to make it more applicable for virtual scientific presentation. I gave the workshop today and it went great! Thanks so much to the many that attended and RIPE for the invitation. Best wishes for your upcoming meeting!\n\nMay 13, 2020 CIFAR Azrieli Global Scholars Today I had the opportunity to work with a great group of early career scientists in Canada that are part of the CIFAR Azrieli Global Scholars program. The program supports exceptional early-career researchers with funding, mentorship, a global network and professional skills development. As part of their professional skills development activities I had the opportunity to work with the group to provide a \"Mentoring for Success in Science and Innovation\" workshop and lead a discussion on mentoring today. Although we originally had planned to meet in Montebello, we met today through a ZOOM session. It was fun to be part of such an important Canadian based program. Best wishes to all.\n\nMarch -May 2020 Life has Changed Indeed As I am sure has happened with all of you, the COVID-19 virus is affecting all of our lives in unexpected ways, first as a seemingly small impact to now a global pandemic. I do hope that all of you are safe and staying healthy. It is indeed hard times in ways that we have never experienced. All of our COACh activities after March 15 have been converted to on-line Zoom/Bluejeans/Microsoft Team meetings. Although I miss the rich personal interactions that come from face-to-face meetings, it has allowed us to keep active in helping women - and men - scientists around the US and the world through our COACh workshops.\n\nIn the U.S. we are also impacted by a long-over due reckoning and recognition of the injustices that African American's have been suffering since brought to our country as slaves. I am hopeful that the Black Lives Matter movement will finally enable sustainable and meaningful changes that are so drastically needed in this country. Our STEM field is not immune from these inequities as can be seen from the small number of African Americans and people of color that are in our country in science and engineering. It is up to all of us to work to make the changes to ensure that unnecessary racial barriers and biases are recognized and removed. In these 22 years of COACh, I have seen the impact of these biases on black scientists and engineers (men and women) through our COACh activities and our research.\n\nIn these 22 years of COACh, I have seen the impact of these biases on black scientists and engineers (men and women) through our COACh activities with NOBCChE, AISES and SACNAS and our research. And I have learned so much about their experiences and challenges from the amazing women of color on our COACh Advisory Board. We have far to go but listening and learning is the critical first step. Black Lives do Matter in STEM.\n\nMarch 8, 2020 Happy International Women's Day! With a special shout out to all the thousands of women scientists and engineers we have worked with through the COACh program around the world!\n\nI spent the day at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, helping researchers in the Energy Sciences area to develop a robust mentoring program. It was a wonderful visit and a super day.\n\nMarch 5, 2020 Center for Synthesizing Quantum Coherence Duke UniversityCOACh Advisory Board member Celeste Rohlfing and I are helping the NSF Quantum Coherence Center with the broader outreach activities by providing training sessions for their graduate students and faculty on a number of topics. The Center is comprised of chemistry research groups from Duke University, Northwestern University, University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana and UC Berkeley. Today's focus was on \"Mentoring for Success in Science\". It was super visit with planned upcoming visit to the other campuses in the near future.\n\nJanuary 27-30, 2020 Back to Bangkok and KMUTT This week brought me to Bangkok and King Mongkut’s University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT) for the annual review of its research programs by the International Research Advisory Panel (IRAP). While there I conducted, along with dear friend Supapan Seraphin, COACh workshops for their students and faculty on publishing and proposal writing. I also gave a scientific presentation on “The Power of Combining Experiment and Computer Simulations”. It was a very successful review and a wonderful time to be in Bangkok.\n\nJanuary 14,15, 2020 Brussels and the Solvay Prize This week I had the pleasure of serving on the selection committee for the Future Solvay Prize which recognizes a scientist every two years for major discoveries that lay the foundation for the chemistry of the future while serving human progress. The winner unanimously selected by the committee was Carolyn Bertozzi, Professor of Chemistry at Stanford University for her invention of bioorthogonal chemical reactions that can be performed in living cells. Bertozzi will receive her award on March 10 in a ceremony held at the Palais des Académies in Brussels in the presence of His Majesty King Philippe of Belgium. HUGE KUDOS to Carolyn!! Another amazing woman scientist to celebrate!\n\nDecember 10-13, 2019 There’s Talent in Tanzania!I had the pleasure of being part of the 10th International Conference of the African Materials Research Society (AMRS) held this week in Arusha. The conference brings together over 700 materials science researchers from all over the world. It’s a great meeting for scientific and research communities to build knowledge, foster relationships and promote action for further understanding and collaborations in the broad fields associated with materials science and technology. The meeting was held at the Nelson Mandela African Institute of Science and Technology. I gave two COACh workshops, one on publishing and the other on proposal writing. Big thanks to everyone for inviting me to be involved in another Africa MRS meeting.\n\nNovember 21, 2019 Visit to IUPUIWhat an honor it was for me to be the first Frank J. Welcher Lecturer in the chemistry department at the University of Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis(IUPUI). I gave a scientific presentation and also a COACh Negotiation workshop for the faculty as hosted by the IUPUI STEM Education Innovation and Research Institute. It was a particular treat to be hosted by Pratibha Varma-Nelson is a COACh alumni who has gone on to be incredibly successful in numerous leadership roles.\n\nNovember 4, 2019 Women Rule at the US Naval Academy!The 1st WOMEN IN STEM Symposium was held today at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis Maryland and I got to be there! What an event! See the picture of the fantastic STEM women faculty and students who were part of this amazing symposium at the U.S. Naval Academy. The symposium was the brain-child of Professor Shirley Lin, a fantastic chemistry faculty member there. Takes courage to pull any 1st time event and she did and it was fantastic! The symposium preceded the 9th Annual Naval Academy Science and Engineering Conference.

I was privileged to be invited to lead several COACh sessions on topics such as mentoring, networking, negotiation and publishing at the 3 day workshop in Kigali. Approximately 45 women scientists came as cohorts from South African, Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria, Ethiopia and Tunisia. Each cohort from each of the countries consisted of 3-5 mentees and one mentor. This unique workshop was the brainchild of Dr. Anjali Kumar of USAID. The goals of the workshop were to learn and practice best practices of mentoring and for each cohort to develop a one-year plan for working together with their senior mentor to address issues that would help them advance in their careers.\n\nFrom all accounts the workshop was an amazing experience for everyone – including me. Anjali felt that it went well beyond her expectations. Everyone left with dozens of new friends from different countries that they could stay in touch with as the months and years go forward. More importantly, they now have a deeper understanding of what it means to be a mentor, sponsor or coach for each other and have a plan developed for group mentoring in the coming year.\n\nOnce again it proved to me that magical and powerful things can happen when women scientists get together and share their stories, aspirations and friendship.\n\n.\n\nMay 23, 2018 BUSY in BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan A whirlwind trip to Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan, allowed me to visit a number of laboratories and meet with many STEM researchers and students. As in Uzbekistan, finding resources for science is difficult and equally difficult to find collaborators in the US. My first visit was to the highly esteemed Academy of Science with it’s beautiful and artful representations of the atom outside. Many laboratory and institute directors attended my presentation on science in the U.S. including the president of the Academy.\n\nA visit to the highly regarded Polytechnic Institute was very exciting, especially being on a campus with many STEM students engaged in their courses and also studying for their exams. I was quite impressed with their agricultural oriented laboratories and their facilities in general that prepare students for agricultural jobs while also conducting research. I am so grateful for their warm welcome.\n\nAt the Sapat primary and secondary school in Bishkek I had another opportunity to meet with many dedicated teachers and with women in technology at the American Center that is co-located with the Bishkek Children’s library. Too many wonderful people to list so please see them in the pictures.\n\nEveryone that I met would like to connect with scientists in the US but they don’t know how. All ideas are welcome. Although english can be an impediment for some, the younger generation is working hard to learn english and with much success.\n\nBig thanks to everyone that was so generous in coming to my talks and engaging in conversations. Many traveled many hours from different provinces to come to Bishkek to see my, including my dear friend Myskal Sagynbaeva. And a special thanks to Cori and Manas at the U.S. Embassy for all their help with my visit and the US Charge d'Arraires Alan Meltzer for meeting with me.\n\nMay 18, 2018 STEM and COACh in Osh, Kyrgyzstan Kyrgyzstan is a beautiful country with over 90% of the landscape covered with gorgeous mountains. Boutiful farm fields cover much of the remaining land. Like Uzbekistan and many neighboring countries, much of the STEM academic research and educational endeavors mirror the structure of the former Soviet Union. Transitioning to a research and educational structure that is updated and more like western countries has been long in coming but clear signs of recent progress are apparent.\n\nOsh, the second largest city in Kyrgyzstan has about 10 universities. The last two days I have had a chance to meet with scientists and students one of the best, Osh Technical University, with a group of young inventors at the American Center and with high school STEM teachers from the southern region of Kyrgyzstan at the highly regarded Sapat school. There are 16 Sapat schools in the country and they graduate some of the best students in the country – their students winning many STEM local and international Olympiad awards.\n\nI am so grateful for all of the visiting arrangements made by the U.S. Embassy in Kyrgyzstan (and a big shout-out to magnificent Manas Kaarav from the Embassy who shephered me around and helped with my shortcomings with Russian and Kyrgyz languages). I also want to thank the institutes that hosed my events and the students and teachers that came to my events and shared with me their knowledge about STEM in the country, their aspirations and the challenges that they have in elevating the science and innovation ecosystem in their country.\n\nMay 16, 2018 COACh’s First Visit to Central Asia – Tashkent Uzbekistan I have learned much in the past few days about science and innovation efforts in this wonderful country. My visit to the region is a result of a very special International Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP) of the U.S. State Department called #HiddenNoMore: Empowering Women Leaders in STEM. While speaking about COACh to the 2017 class of women scientists from all over the world, several women from Central Asia asked if there was anyway that I could bring COACh to the region. With funds from the University of Oregon I have finally been able to make the trip and am so glad that I did.\n\nWhile here I have given several talks and visited with professors, researchers and students from the Uzbekistan Academy of Science, the newly formed Center for Advanced Technologies, and the Tashkent Chemical Technological Institute. I have toured laboratories and even had a special event with you students from around Tashkent who are practicing their English skills through the English Conversation Club at the U.S. Embassy. Like in many countries the number of women in the biological sciences is nearly at gender parity but men far outnumber women in the physical sciences and engineering. Women are even fewer in number when it comes to leadership posts, Academy of Science membership and directorships. That said, I met some amazing women who are leading the way in science in Uzbekistan and are serving as role models for those to come.\n\nThank you so much to Claire Thomas from the U.S. Embassy and her assistant Ekaterina Biryukova for hosting my visit and also Shahlo Turdikulova, Director of the Center for Advanced Technologies and member of the 2017 class of IVLP that invited me to come. It’s been a wonderful visit with lots of great pictures to remind me of all of you.\n\nMarch 17, 2018 Greetings from the ACS Spring Meeting in New Orleans What a great way to spend St. Patrick’s Day, meeting reconnecting, and working with women scientists at our COACh workshops here in New Orleans.
