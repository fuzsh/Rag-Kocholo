        "text": "One of the unique characteristics of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is its emphasis on education and scholarship. Studies have shown that among Latter-day Saints (Mormons), higher levels of education are strongly correlated with higher church attendance, and higher levels of devotion. (see footnote)\n\nIn LDS scripture, member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are encouraged to study and learn. In the book Doctrine and Covenants, a book considered to be a collection of modern day revelation from God, it says:\n\nD&C 109:7 And as all have not faith, seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom, seek learning even by study and also by faith;\n\nThis website gives LDS scholars the opportunity to express their views and feelings about the Gospel of Jesus Christ and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. There are some who may feel that people of education and learning can’t be religious. It is hoped that these testimonies will help dispel that myth, educate, and give insights into the thoughts and feelings of LDS scholars.\n\nEach page will have the testimony of the scholar and at the bottom of the page you will be able to read the credentials of the scholar. We hope you enjoy reading these testimonies.\n\nNumber of testimonies: 357\n\nNumber of schools/organizations represented: 168\n\nTestimonies also available in alphabetical order or by post date.\n\nArts\n\nCarma Rose de Jong Anderson – Theater and Film, Brigham Young University\n\nGerald Argetsinger – Theater, Rochester Institute of Technology\n\nMichael Ballam – Music, Utah State University\n\nRobert Cundick – Tabernacle Organist Emeritus, Salt Lake City\n\nMartha Peacock – Art History, Brigham Young University\n\nElizabeth Young Rennick – Music, Eastern Kentucky University\n\nEric Samuelsen – Theater, Brigham Young University\n\nLarry V.
