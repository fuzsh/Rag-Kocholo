Reviewed by Mack C. Stirling This book consists of eighteen chapters based on papers read at the twentieth annual Sidney B. Sperry Symposium on October 26, 1991. All of the contributors were members of the Brigham Young University religious education faculty except John Welch (Professor of Law at Brigham Young University), Gerald W. Lund (employed by the Church Educational System), and Elder Robert E. Wells of the First Quorum of the Seventy. Prior to publication each paper underwent two reviews, one by a member of the religion faculty and one by a member of another B YU department. The editors state in the preface to the book that the purpose of the symposium was to teach &quot;sound doctrine&quot; from the Book of Mormon. It was hoped as well that the essays in the book would prove of particular use t...\n\nJoseph Fielding McConkie and Robert L.

Millet reproduce the text of the Book of Mormon divided into blocks of dissimilar length, which they follow with annotations on what they understand to be doctrinal matters. Though they never indicate exactly what they mean by doctrine, the Book of Mormon is treated as a &#39;&#39;theological treatise&quot; (2:2) containing &quot;theological gems,&quot; which provides an indication of what they have in mind. Doctrinal Commentary on the Book of Mormon is a series of statements, either about phrases or about topics suggeste...\n\nJohn R. Farkas and David A. Reed. Mormonism: Changes, Contradictions, and Errors. Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker Books, 1995. 256 pp., with bibliogra. phy and index. $11.98. Reviewed by Craig L. Foster With their latest combined effort , authors John R. Farkas and David A. Reed have undertaken an impress ive task. They have, as they explain in their preface, taken up Joseph Fielding Smith&#39;s challenge to detect errors and contradictions of Mormonism through the &quot;accepted standards of measurement, the sc riptures.&quot;\\ Such an undertaking would be impressive for any scholar. At the minimum, a writer or writers would need a thorough background of Latter-day Saint history and an understanding of the complex.ities of an open canon and evolving doctrine. Indeed , something of this magnitude would encompass numerous primary and secondary works discussing not only Latter-day Saint but primitive Christian history and theology. It would also have to be an honest, unbiased, scholarly wo..."
