        "text": "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, commonly referred to as the \"Mormon Church,\" was founded in 1830 by Joseph Smith in New York after his claims to have seen the resurrected Father and the Son along with his translation of the Book of Mormon. It is a relatively young denomination of Christianity (though there is constant debate about whether Mormons are truly Christian) and one that emerged during the infancy of the United States of America. The study of this group has risen in popularity as the Latter-day Saint movement has grown more influential in recent decades with the failed presidential candidacy of Mitt Romney in 2012 and has continued its rise in popularity in scholarly fields as the church has embraced digitization of historical records with its Joseph Smith Papers Project, an attempt to digitize all the early sources surrounding the enigmatic leader. The history of this church is closely tied with the history of American Western expansion and early American religious history in general, making it a crucial aspect of any historical study of that time period.\n\nThis LibGuide offers patrons links to important databases, websites, journals, and introductory materials to begin their research.
