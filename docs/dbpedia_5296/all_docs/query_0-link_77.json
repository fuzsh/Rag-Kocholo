You only need to fill in one field below. This can be any field. If you select \"not\" as your match criteria, you must select at least one other field.\n\nExplanation of Terms, Operators, Queries, and Grouping\n\nCapitalization of alphabetic characters is ignored. \"MormoN\" matches \"mormon\", \"Mormon\", \"MORMON\", etc.\n\nCommon words and words with only 1 or 2 characters are ignored.\n\nAll punctuation marks other than the following operators are ignored.\n\nPhrases enclosed within double quotes (\") only matches exactly the same words in the same order. Nonword characters are ignored. \"test phrase\" matches \"test, phrase\" but not \"phrase test\", or \"test or phrase\".\n\nParentheses may be used to group words and operators into subexpressions.\n\nA plus (+) in front of a word means it must be present.\n\nA minus (-) in front of a word means it must not be present. There must be at least one other search term in the same field.\n\nA space in front of a word means the word is optional, but it should be present.\n\nA tilde (~) in front of a word means it should not be present.\n\n> or < in front of a word increases (>) or decreases (<) the word's relevance.\n\nAn asterisk (*) at the end of a word serves as a wildcard operator. \"apple*\" matches “apple”, “apples”, “applesauce”, “applet”, etc.\n\n@<distance> tests whether two or more words all start within the specified distance, measured in words. Specify the search words within a double-quoted string immediately before the @<distance> operator. For example, \"jakarta apache\"@10 looks for \"apache\" and \"jakarta\" within 10 words of each other.\n\nAny field:\n\nAND\n\nTitle:\n\nAND\n\nTopic:\n\nAND\n\nAuthor:\n\nAND\n\nAbstract:\n\nAND\n\nCitation:\n\nAND\n\nKeywords\n\nAND\n\nContent\n\nAND\n\nCollection:\n\nUse the Ctrl or ⌘ key to select multiple Collections.\n\nAND\n\nArticle Type:\n\nUse the Ctrl or ⌘ key to select multiple document types.\n\nAND\n\nMedia Type:\n\nUse the Ctrl or ⌘ key to select multiple media types.\n\nAND\n\nDate:\n\nA full year or month may be searched by entering only a year or a month & year.\n\nAND\n\nDate range:\n\nto\n\nSort by:\n\nRelevance Author Publication Date Volume/Issue\n\nDisplay:\n\nDescriptions/Abstracts Keywords\n\nBasic Search\n\nA\n\nHamblin, Laura. “A.M.

Adventures of the Soul: The Best Creative Nonfiction from BYU Studies. Provo, UT: BYU Studies, 2009.\n\nDisplay Abstract\n\nTo help celebrate our 50th anniversary, Doris R. Dant has compiled a new book of personal essays titled Adventures of the Soul: The Best Creative Nonfiction from BYU Studies. Expect startling disclosures if you open this book, for these are personal essays—the reality show of literature. Sometimes with brutal candor, these essays trace gospel messages in the lives of the humble. A Xhosa black man with three teeth and a perfectly round head becomes the Savior of all races. A young mother recognizes her entire body belongs to her children—“take, eat!” A harmonica player is awakened and washed by irrigation water, the water of life. A returned missionary learns to see God’s mysterious hand in the life of a former foe. Miracles, love, pain, the substance of life—all can be found in these stories. “Adventures is a page-turner!

An Advocate for Women: The Public Life of Emmeline B. Wells, 1870–1920. Provo, UT: BYU Studies, 2021.\n\nDisplay Abstract\n\nIn her fifty years as a public figure, Emmeline B. Wells edited the Woman’s Exponent, represented Latter-day Saint women in national women’s organizations, courageously defended her religion in the halls of Congress, and helped mitigate anti-Mormon sentiments, all before becoming Relief Society General President in 1910 at age eighty-two. Her mediating efforts won friends inside and outside LDS circles and earned her a sculpted bust placed in a niche in the Utah state Capitol. The simple inscription speaks volumes: “A Fine Soul Who Served Us.” “Emmeline Wells left indelible footprints not only in Utah—where she had a close working relationship with five church presidents—but on the national stage, including interviews with four U.S. Presidents, one in her own home. . . . Madsen broadens and deepens what she began in her award-winning dissertation [on Wells’s life and work] to provide the full, engaging story of this woman who both chronicled and made history. Wells encouraged and inspired the women of her day. With Madsen’s eloquent retelling, Emmeline’s accomplishments may now inspire those of our own age, too.” Ronald K.

This is the underlying idea behind Alma2’s discussion of Melchizedek in Alma 13. In this article, I first look at “priest” in the biblical record and tradition. I follow this with a discussion of Book of Mormon “priesthood” notions up to Alma1 and Alma2 (including the interaction with Nehor). Finally, I examine the conflict between Alma2 and the Nehorite people of Ammonihah, where Alma2 draws on a narrative expansion of the Melchizedek tradition in Genesis 14 to make his point about his priesthood order and its superiority to the order of Nehor.\n\nKeywords: Alma the Younger; Ammonihah (City of); Melchizedek (King of Salem); Nephite Kingship; Order of Nehor; Priesthood\n\nTopics:

This way of seeing things surfaces explicitly in various texts and is known among scholars as the Doctrine of the Two Ways. While the same teaching has been noticed in the Book of Mormon, there is as yet no study that examines the Book of Mormon presentations systematically to identify the ways in which they might follow any of the ancient versions of the Two Ways doctrine, or the ways in which these might feature original formulations. In this article, Noel Reynolds shows that the Book of Mormon writers did retain most elements of the earliest biblical teaching, but with enriched understandings and original formulations of the Doctrine of the Two Ways in their prophetic teachings. He documents twelve exemplary passages in the Book of Mormon that explicitly refer to two paths or ways and assesses the extent to which these follow or vary from each other or from Jewish and Christian models.\n\nKeywords: Ancient Near East; Church of the Devil; Commandment; Doctrine; Jacob (Son of Lehi); Jesus Christ; King Benjamin; Lehi (Prophet); Mormon (Prophet); Nephi (Son of Helaman); Nephi (Son of Lehi); Opposition: Church of the Lamb of God; Righteousness; Two Ways; Wickedness\n\nTopics: Book of Mormon Scriptures > Jacob\n\nBook of Mormon Scriptures > Helaman\n\nID = [10680] Status = Type = journal article Date = 2017-01-03 Collections: bmc-archive,bom,byu-studies Size: 64021 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:12:59\n\nSmoot, Stephen O., John Gee, Kerry Muhlestein, and John S.

While I have been waiting for this shift to occur among those who don’t have the Mormons’ axe to grind, I have been collecting every available evidence to support my belief in the existence of such writing. My own findings and the findings of others not only establish the fact that writing did exist in ancient America, but they also indicate that metal plates were frequently used as a medium for this writing and that the writings themselves often denote Old World, specifically Hebrew, origins.\n\nKeywords: Ancient America; Mesoamerica; Writing System\n\nID = [9543] Status = Type = journal article Date = 1972-01-04 Collections: bmc-archive,bom,byu-studies Size: 666 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:12:51\n\nBushman-Carlton, Marilyn. “‘And gladly wolde he lerne and gladly teche’” BYU Studies 50, no. 1 (2011): 98.\n\nID = [11087] Status = Type = journal article Date = 2011-01-01 Collections: byu-studies Size: 778 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:13:02\n\nAthay, R.

It is usually in this creation setting or in a temple or on a mountaintop that Gnosticism places the revelation of the esoteric mysteries and the knowledge needed to thwart the archontic powers and return to God.\n\nGnosticism is primarily concerned with the questions, Who am I? Where am I from? and What is my destiny? That the answers to these questions are often associated with the creation, the Garden, and the fall of man is probably due to the Gnostic presupposition that the end of all things is to be found in their beginning. Of those documents which manifest this concern, the Nag Hammadi Apocalypse of Adam is perhaps the prime example.\n\nKeywords: Adam (Prophet); Apocalypse of Adam; Eve; Garden of Eden; Gnosticism; Nag Hammadi Library\n\nTopics: Old Testament Scriptures > Genesis\n\nOld Testament Topics > Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha [including intertestamental books and the Dead Sea Scrolls]\n\nID = [4682] Status = Type = journal article Date = 1977-01-01 Collections: bmc-archive,byu-studies,moses,old-test Size: 50008 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 7/22/24 10:12:47\n\nBrown, S.

Subsequent writers have noted that this date corresponds to the Jewish Passover, during which the arrival of Elijah is traditionally awaited. A parenthetical note in the Missionary Training Manual: For Use in the Jewish Proselyting Program states the correlation of the two events emphatically. There we are informed that Elijah appeared in the Kirtland Temple “at about the same hour that the Jewish families in that time zone would have been preparing to begin their feast of the Passover.” These statements, although correct in their identification of the Jewish Passover with the ritual expectation of Elijah and in their connecting the time of the appearance of Elijah in the Kirtland Temple with the Passover season, warrant further elucidation and modest chronological correction.\n\nKeywords: Elijah (Prophet); Kirtland Temple; Moses (Prophet); Passover\n\nTopics: Old Testament Scriptures > Twelve Minor Prophets\n\nOld Testament Topics > Elijah\n\nOld Testament Topics > Moses\n\nID = [9030] Status = Type = journal article Date = 1983-01-04 Collections: bmc-archive,byu-studies,old-test Size: 989 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:12:47\n\nAllen, James B. “Appendix I: Historical Milestones.” BYU Studies 34, no. 2 (1995): 343.\n\nID = [12156] Status = Type = journal article Date = 1995-01-01 Collections: byu-studies Size: 6013 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:13:10\n\nAllen, James B. “Appendix II: Microfilm Places and Operators.” BYU Studies 34, no. 2 (1995): 347.\n\nID = [12157] Status = Type = journal article Date = 1995-01-01 Collections: byu-studies Size: 4743 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:13:10\n\nAllen, James B. “Appendix III: Microfilm Production.” BYU Studies 34, no. 2 (1995): 351.\n\nID = [12158] Status = Type = journal article Date = 1995-01-01 Collections: byu-studies Size: 2265 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:13:10\n\nSmoot, Stephen O., John Gee, Kerry Muhlestein, and John S.

Arm the Children. Provo, UT: BYU Studies, 2011.\n\nDisplay Abstract\n\nAs the century closes, subcultures are being swallowed up by a world culture of mass media and increased secularization. Like a great and abominable church, much of this culture is fundamentally opposed to the principles of the gospel. For twenty-five years, Arthur Henry King has critiqued this mass culture. But he does more. He teaches us to spiritu­ally arm ourselves and our children to win the battle against the destructive forces encompassing us worldwide. King’s talks encourage a deeper commitment to a life of repentance and service and an empathy for the unconverted. They counsel us to turn away from the ugly, vulgar, violent entertainments of our time. Rather, we should seek happiness, not as a goal, but as an activity that includes learning from the best art, music, and literature. By attending to the minute particulars of texts and to the de­tails of everyday living, we free ourselves from traditions that stunt our souls. We open our hearts and minds to the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, our souls to the Atonement. Professor King persuasively argues that genuine education begins in homes where parents read the scriptures to and with their children. The language and moral­ity of scripture then form the foundation for learning and judging every activity, art, and discipline. Arm the Children includes all the talks found in King’s Abundance of the Heart plus several previously unpublished talks that continue his jeremiad on behalf of us all.\n\nID = [75252] Status = Type = book Date = 2011-01-01 Collections: byu-studies Size: Children: 0 Rebuilt: 7/22/24 11:09:35\n\nOlson, Terrance D. “Arm the Children: Faith’s Response to a Violent World.” BYU Studies 39, no. 1 (2000): 215.\n\nID = [11760] Status = Type = journal article Date = 2000-01-01 Collections: byu-studies Size: 9259 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:13:07\n\nClark, E.

Dant. Art and Spirituality: The Visual Culture of Christian Faith. Provo, UT: BYU Studies, 2006.\n\nDisplay Abstract\n\nSince 1998 the Brigham Young University Museum of Art has hosted the biennial Art, Belief, Meaning Symposium. The purpose of the symposium is to provide an opportunity for Latter-day Saint artists, critics, and commentators to contribute to the ongoing discussion about issues related to art and spirituality. Our goal is to articulate our interest in the making of art that not only is relevant and meaningful for our day, but which also bears witness and gives perspective to the realities that flow from the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. The symposium provides a welcome forum for discussion regarding issues that have always concerned serious religious artists: • What is the role of the artist in relation to the mission of the Church? • What is the place of self expression, belief, and inspiration in religious art? • Do artists have a “mission” through their work? • How does individual testimony find expression in the work of the artist? • Does religion create untenable tensions in the expression of the artist? • What is the relationship between idea and technique in religious art? • Can religious art find expression through contemporary art movements? This series provides an opportunity for like-minded believers, those with deep and often passionate interests in the arts, to come together, reason together, and benefit from each others’ points of view. Hopefully others who find themselves confronted by similar issues will benefit from a careful reading of these essays.\n\nTopics: Book of Mormon Scriptures > Ether\n\nID = [75253] Status = Type = book Date = 2006-01-01 Collections: bom,byu-studies Size: Children: 0 Rebuilt: 7/22/24 11:09:35\n\nMathews, Conan E. “Art and the Church.” Brigham Young University Studies 3, no. 2 (1961): 3.\n\nID = [9972] Status = Type = journal article Date = 1961-01-02 Collections: byu-studies Size: 10285 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:12:54\n\nToit, Herman du, and Doris R.

Russell Ballard once said, Inspired art speaks in the language of eternity, teaching things to the heart that the eyes and ears can never understand. Students and scholars at Brigham Young University discuss art in our theology in this new publication entitled Art, Belief, Meaning. The articles in this volume come from the proceedings of the 2003 Art, Belief, and Meaning symposium. This volume starts by analyzing some of the challenges of being a Latter-day Saint artist. Examples include Pat Debenham’s “Seduction of Our Gifts” and Tanya Rizzuti’s “Imparting One to Another: The Role of Humility, Charity, and Consecration within an Artistic Community.” The next section deals with the aesthetics of art. Articles in this section like Grant L. Lunds’s “What Makes a Good Image? What Makes a Good Life?” and Bruce H. Smith’s “What Can You Do with an Eclair?” help us to understand what makes art beautiful. The last section looks at the role of postmodernism in art. Some articles include “Taking Off Our Shoes: On Seeing the Other Religiously” by Keith H. Lane, and Nancy Andruk’s “Accountability, Efficacy, and Postmodernism.”\n\nID = [75254] Status = Type = book Date = 2011-01-01 Collections: byu-studies Size: Children: 0 Rebuilt: 7/22/24 11:09:35\n\nCook, Lyndon W. “The Articles of Faith.” Brigham Young University Studies 17, no. 2 (1977): 254.\n\nID = [9336] Status = Type = journal article Date = 1977-01-01 Collections: byu-studies Size: 5016 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:12:50\n\nBradshaw, Merrill K. “The Articles of Faith—Composer’s Commentary.” Brigham Young University Studies 3, no. 3 (1961): 73.\n\nID = [9967] Status = Type = journal article Date = 1961-01-03 Collections: byu-studies Size: 25990 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:12:54\n\nLeonard, Glen M., ed.

As museum curators and historians worked to exhibit and tell the history of these objects, they sometimes found that stories told about them were incorrect. This collection’s aim is to tell a more accurate history about these treasured heirlooms. Since the beginning of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, members have kept records and honored their past. Documents and artifacts provide evidence of sacred events and connect the spiritual aspect of the Church to tangible objects. This book reports on selected buildings and objects that bring to life important events that took place in the first two decades of the Restoration. As museum curators and historians worked to exhibit and tell the history of these objects, they sometimes found that stories told about them were incorrect. This collection’s aim is to tell a more accurate history about these treasured heirlooms. Items discussed in this volume: The two Smith family homes in Palmyra-Manchester, New York The artifacts of the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum Smith, including weapons, canes, Carthage Jail, and watches Eliza R. Snow’s watch, given to her by Joseph Smith The Nauvoo Temple bells The Relief Society Campanile on Temple Square Cannons and other artillery used in Nauvoo and Utah Odometers used on the pioneer trail Telling a better history of these physical objects helps preserve them for future generations. 504 pages Paperback\n\nID = [75255] Status = Type = book Date = 2022-01-01 Collections: byu-studies,church-history Size: Children: 0 Rebuilt: 7/22/24 11:09:35\n\nKimball, Edward L. “The Artist and the Forger: Han van Meegeren and Mark Hofmann.” BYU Studies 27, no. 4 (1987): 5-16.\n\nDisplay Abstract Display Keywords\n\nIn 1947 the artist Han van Meegeren stood in the criminal court in Amsterdam and admitted he was guilty of forgery in what may be the greatest known art fraud. Forty years later, in 1987, Mark Hofmann confessed his guilt of forgery, fraud, and murder growing out of what may be the greatest known historical document fraud. The two cases show some striking similarities.These two men, the artist and the forger, turned their considerable talents to crime because of vanity, anger, and greed. They might have gone undetected, but the love of money held them captive. They risked again and again exposure and imprisonment, unable to quit while ahead. Their forgeries went undetected for years but ultimately came to light when police began investigating the men for much different crimes. As bizarre as the story of Mark Hofmann may seem, he was merely acting out a new production of an old play.\n\nKeywords: Forgery; Hofmann Forgeries; Mark Hofmann; Salamander Letter\n\nID = [10240] Status = Type = journal article Date = 1987-01-04 Collections: bmc-archive,bom,byu-studies Size: 898 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:12:56\n\nAnderson, Travis T. “Artistry and Aesthetics in Contemporary Mormon and Iranian Film.” BYU Studies 48, no. 2 (2009): 111.\n\nID = [11192] Status = Type = journal article Date = 2009-01-02 Collections: byu-studies Size: 77571 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:13:03\n\nPacker, Boyd K. “The Arts and the Spirit of the Lord.” Brigham Young University Studies 16, no. 4 (1976): 575.\n\nID = [9360] Status = Type = journal article Date = 1976-01-03 Collections: byu-studies Size: 953 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:12:50\n\nProbert, Josh E. “The Artwork of Ron Richmond: Catharsis no. 27 and Triplus.” BYU Studies 46, no. 1 (2007): 176.\n\nID = [11354] Status = Type = journal article Date = 2007-01-01 Collections: byu-studies Size: 1313 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:13:04\n\nMajor, Jill C. “Artworks in the Celestial Room of the First Nauvoo Temple.” BYU Studies 41, no. 2 (2002): 47.\n\nID = [11597] Status = Type = journal article Date = 2002-01-02 Collections: byu-studies Size: 27505 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:13:06\n\nReed, Leonard. “‘As a Bird Sings’: Hannah Tapfield King, Poetess and Pioneer.” BYU Studies Quarterly 51, no. 3 (2012): 101.\n\nID = [11005] Status = Type = journal article Date = 2012-01-03 Collections: byu-studies Size: 45256 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:13:02\n\nTice, Richard Ellis. “As Fire.” BYU Studies 44, no. 2 (2005): 168.\n\nID = [11469] Status = Type = journal article Date = 2005-01-02 Collections: byu-studies Size: 762 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:13:05\n\nBennion, Lowell L. “As for Me and My House.” BYU Studies 30, no. 2 (1990): 124.\n\nID = [10123] Status = Type = journal article Date = 1990-01-02 Collections: byu-studies Size: 1066 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:12:55\n\nTaylor, Sally T. “As He Has Spoken.” Brigham Young University Studies 25, no. 4 (1985): 146.\n\nID = [8914] Status = Type = journal article Date = 1985-01-04 Collections: byu-studies Size: Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:09:46\n\nNibley, Hugh W. “As Things Stand at the Moment.” Brigham Young University Studies 9, no. 1.

Every aspect of writing a history, from the selection of sources to the interpretation of those sources bears the imprint of the author. The profoundly precarious and contingent character of all reconstruction of the past led Roland Barthes to quip that biography is “a novel that dare not speak its name.” Clearly, this is an overstatement, but it does warn us away from an unhealthy critical complacency when engaging in studying written histories.\n\nKeywords: Bushman; Histories; Joseph; Jr.; Richard L.; Smith; Sources\n\nID = [11432] Status = Type = journal article Date = 2005-01-04 Collections: bmc-archive,byu-studies Size: 19379 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:13:05\n\nHarline, Paula. “Audacious Women: Early British Mormon Immigrants.” BYU Studies 36, no. 1 (1996): 189.\n\nID = [12012] Status = Type = journal article Date = 1996-01-01 Collections: byu-studies Size: 5952 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:13:09\n\nGunter, Susan E. “August 10, 1995.” BYU Studies 38, no. 1 (1999): 186.\n\nID = [11834] Status = Type = journal article Date = 1999-01-01 Collections: byu-studies Size: 2987 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:13:08\n\nBYU Studies. “Author Index (31:4).” BYU Studies 31, no. 4 (1991): 41.\n\nID = [12308] Status = Type = journal article Date = 1991-01-04 Collections: byu-studies Size: 162418 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:13:11\n\nKeller, Roger R. “Authority and Worldwide Growth.” BYU Studies 44, no. 4 (2005): 307.\n\nID = [11448] Status = Type = journal article Date = 2005-01-04 Collections: byu-studies Size: 18146 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:13:05\n\nCampbell, Eugene E. “Authority Conflicts in the Mormon Battalion.” Brigham Young University Studies 8, no. 2 (1968): 127.\n\nID = [9793] Status = Type = journal article Date = 1968-01-01 Collections: byu-studies Size: 36976 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:12:53\n\nSearle, Howard C. “Authorship of the History of Brigham Young: A Review Essay.” Brigham Young University Studies 22, no. 3 (1982): 367.\n\nID = [9093] Status = Type = journal article Date = 1982-01-03 Collections: brigham,byu-studies Size: Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:12:48\n\nSearle, Howard C. “Authorship of the History of Joseph Smith: A Review Essay.” Brigham Young University Studies 21, no. 1 (1981): 101.\n\nID = [9172] Status = Type = journal article Date = 1981-01-01 Collections: byu-studies Size: 739 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:12:48\n\nBitton, Davis. “The Autobiography of B.
