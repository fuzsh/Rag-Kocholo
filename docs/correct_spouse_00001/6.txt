Looks like Owen Wilson takes his ab workouts very seriously.

The Wedding Crashers actor is expecting a baby with his married personal trainer.

Caroline Lindqvist is embroiled in a divorce from her plastic surgeon husband, Dr Ritu Chopra, according to the National Enquirer.

Wilson, 44, and Lindqvist, 41, met after his suicide attempt in 2007, which is thought to have been caused by his split from actress Kate Hudson.

The pair became good friends and he hired her to become his trainer, but their relationship is said to have only turned romantic after she split from her spouse over a year ago.

Meanwhile, Star magazine has revealed Lindqvist's husband was stunned by the pregnancy news.

"Ritu was completely blindsided by the news of Lindqvist's pregnancy," a source told the magazine.

A representative for Lindqvist, who is is due in January, said Lindqvist became pregnant after she and Chopra separated, according to the report. She filed for divorce on May 29.

Wilson already has a two-year-old son, Robert, with his former girlfriend Jade Duell, but the couple split up five months after the birth.
