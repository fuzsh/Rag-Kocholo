        "text": "LOS ANGELES — Owen Wilson, 42, gets to enjoy the alleged joys of a \"Hall Pass\" from marriage in the new film from the comedy-minded Farrelly brothers, Bobby and Peter.\n\nOf course, if anyone knows comedy, it should be Wilson, whose career extends from wide-ranging roles in films for buddy Wes Anderson (\"Bottle Rocket,\" \"Rushmore,\" \"The Royal Tenenbaums,\" to name a few) to teaming with pal Ben Stiller in the \"Night at the Museum\" movies and \"Little Fockers.\" Here, he talks about the \"R\"-rated \"Hall Pass,\" working with the Farrellys for the first time, and a little more.\n\nI don't know if you've done a film with just you and a leading actress. It's usually more an ensemble, such as this. Do you specifically look for those scripts?\n\nIt’s not necessarily a plan. I think from growing up with my brothers and those kind of buddy comedies, I kind of relate to those and the humor in those. Maybe it’s just kind of what I’ve responded to.\n\nOn a Farrelly Brothers movie, you know you're going to have some compromising scenes. Was there something in your read of this script where you said, \"Oh, no\"?\n\nI think more it was that I had kind of known these guys for a little bit, so I always felt comfortable that we were on the same wavelength, sense of humor-wise. I didn’t have that fear of “These guys are going to be thinking something is funny that I don’t think is funny. Am I really going to be on the same page?”\n\nBut then, it always is that everybody has a different way of working. The Farrellys are kind of particular in the way that they direct, very specific with the way that they hear things, and I like that. There were also more wrap parties on this movie than normal movies. In fact, we even had one last night.\n\nDespite all the \"raunchy\" stuff in the film, the Farrellys are saying this is a \"chick flick\"?\n\nYeah, they’d often say that to me that we’re making “Mystic Pizza” here. Or maybe (laughing), “The Traveling Sisterhood.”\n\nYou've recently become a father (with girlfriend Jade Duell) and your character in this film suddenly matures. Have you had any similar moments in real life?\n\nYeah, I think definitely my character has that kind of thing toward the end, where he’s looking at a wedding picture and realizes how special that was and what a good thing he has. I guess that is kind of a little bit of the arc of my character, that he realizes what he has.\n\nBut, what about your real life?\n\nI think so. This is my first child (Robert Ford Wilson, born Jan. 14), and that's a pretty amazing thing. It's a beautiful moment, but I don't know that it made me think, \"OK, now everything is completely different.\" I don't know if I thought that.\n\nWhen we think about you, it's always as though you love to party, but you're totally different with this character. Did you enjoy that contrast to roles in your past?\n\nI did. One of the things the Farrellys had in mind was kind of having a “real” look for the guy. I remember my older brother (Andrew), who’s actually in the movie, coming to Atlanta where we filmed and just seeing me in my wardrobe and saying, “Man, you look so bad.” Just putting on the clothes made me feel like, “Gosh, I’ve got no game.” Believe me, you don't feel that when you’re wearing pleated jeans and these kind of orthopedic shoes. You don’t feel very sexy.\n\nYou have such a strong comedic background. How much improv was there while shooting?\n\nI think everybody was really comfortable trying to come up with stuff, but when I read the script, I just thought it was really funny. It’s nice when you’re working on something where you don’t feel you have to try to change it and come up with something. This was always the sense that we had a good base, and then you could kind of go with it from there.\n\nIs there any real merit to this application of a weeklong \"hall pass\" from marriage? Jenna Fischer (of TV's \"The Office,\" who plays Wilson's wife) said it was a horrible idea in real life.\n\nAll the guys are just kind of sighing, but yeah, I agree. It is a terrible idea.\n\nBesides Applebee's and Chili's, where else would you recommend to pick up women?\n\nThe Olive Garden. The more wholesome ones go to Trader Joe’s."
