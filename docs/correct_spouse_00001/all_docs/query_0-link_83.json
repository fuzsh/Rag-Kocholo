        "text": "Maybe Owen Wilson and Simon Cowell should start a support group for celebrities who unexpectedly knocked up married women.\n\nThat weirdly specific problem is now one they both share. Wilson’s personal trainer, Caroline Lindqvist, 41, is pregnant, according to E! News, and he’s the dad.\n\nThe “Wedding Crashers” star has one child, 2-year-old son Ford, with his former girlfriend Jade Duell. They split five months after Ford’s birth.\n\nLindqvist, who’s in the midst of a divorce from her husband, plastic surgeon Ritu Chopra, has reportedly had an on-again, off-againthing with Wilson for some time. Though they’re now having a baby together, they have no intention of settling down together.\n\n“She is just happy that Owen is helping her out any way that he can,” an insider told E! News. “They have an amicable relationship and [care about] what’s best for their unborn child. They are both excited to have a baby.”\n\nWhew! That’s all right then. It’s every child’s dream to grow up with parents who describe their relationship as “amicable.”"
