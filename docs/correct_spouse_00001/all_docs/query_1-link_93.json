        "text": "Owen Wilson might be having another child.\n\nAccording to a Page Six, the \"Wedding Crashers\" star is reportedly having his third child with a third woman. The two other kids are with two different women.\n\nThis comes only a few months after reports surfaced that he had offered to take a paternity test after a woman allegedly claimed she was pregnant with his child.\n\nSources told the publication that the \"Marley & Me\" star, 49, did take a paternity test after she came forward and is indeed the father.\n\n\"If a paternity test establishes that he is the father of another child, he will fulfill all of his obligations to support his child,\" a source told Us Weekly earlier this year.\n\nThe woman is reportedly Varunie Vonsvirates, and when an Instagram follower asked her if Wilson was the father, she said yes. She reportedly switched her Instagram account from private to public on Wednesday night just as the report about her was about to be published.\n\nIn one of her posts, Vonsvirates posted an image of her ultrasound, revealing sheâ€™s expecting a girl.\n\n\"Say hello to Lyla,\" she captioned the photo.\n\nWilson has yet to publicly confirm that he's expecting a third child. He shares son Robert Ford, 7, with ex-girlfriend Jade Duel and son, Finn, 4, with Caroline Lindqvist"
