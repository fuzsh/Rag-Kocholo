        "text": "Actor Owen Wilson is going to become a dad again after getting his former personal trainer pregnant while she was still married.\n\nSwede Caroline Lindqvist, 41, filed for divorce from her husband in May but Owen’s agent said they had already separated when she got together with the Wedding Crashers star.\n\nWilson, 44, is no longer with Caroline but a source said: “She’ll score big time by having his baby.”\n\nActor Wilson turned to the personal trainer after his suicide attempt in 2007, which is thought to have been caused by his split from actress Kate Hudson.\n\nOwen’s ex Jade Duell has reportedly asked that Caroline does not give birth at his home in Hawaii, where she had their son Robert in 2011."
