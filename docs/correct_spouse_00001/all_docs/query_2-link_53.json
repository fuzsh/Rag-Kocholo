        "text": "Owen Wilson has played a father figure in many of his films, but the Bliss star isn't doesn't know his three-year-old daughter Lyla, and fans want to know why.\n\nOwen Wilson is a dad of three, but if you listen to interviews with him, you wouldn’t know it.\n\nHe talks openly about his sons, Robert, 10, whom he shares with ex Jade Duell and Finn, seven, whom he shares with Caroline Lindqvist.\n\nBut Owen has a third child, a daughter named Lyla. And although he’s had a paternity test to prove he’s the dad, and he pays child support every month, he’s never actually met his daughter.\n\nEveryone, from his fans to Lyla’s mum Varunie Vongsvirates have questioned the why, when the Cars voice actor attended a paternity hearing in June 2018, four months before Lyla was born, he ticked the “no visitation” box on the forms.\n\n“He does not want to visit [and does not] want any custody of her,” a source told Us Weekly.\n\nWant to join the family?

Photo: Instagram\n\nOwen Wilson pays child support but hasn't met his daughter Lyla\n\nOwen is apparently a great dad to his sons. “[He] has maintained a warm and close relationship with their mothers,” a source told Us Weekly when the paternity of Varunie’s unborn child was in question.\n\nThe source in 2018 said that if a paternity test revealed that Owen was the dad, “he will fulfil all of his obligations to support his child”.\n\nRELATED: Six-year-old reviews Lightning McQueen toys\n\nLyla was born in 2018. Photo: Instagram\n\nAnd he does generously fulfil his legal obligations.\n\nAccording to reports that surfaced in January 2020, Owen pays US $25,000 a month in child support for Lyla. He also made a one-off payment of $70,000 to Varunie to cover things like a night nurse, labour coach and her legal fees.\n\nNo one really knows why Owen doesn’t want to meet his daughter, but a report by Radar in 2019 speculated that things didn’t end well when Owen and Varunie broke off their five-year relationship.\n\n“When Varunie told Owen she was pregnant, he was not happy about it, and that was the last time they ever spoke,” the source said.\n\n“He changed his phone number. He’s never met his daughter and then he gave no heads up that he was changing his number.”\n\nAfter the paternity hearing, a representative for Owen told Us Magazine, “This is a private matter and it’s not appropriate to comment further.”\n\nRELATED: Cars creator reveals the reason kids love Lightning McQueen\n\nRELATED: Mum questions paternity of her daughter’s baby\n\nLyla just celebrated her third birthday . Photo: Instagram\n\nVarunie Vongsvirates says Owen Wilson 'missing out' not seeing daughter\n\nVarunie is devastated. She addressed Owen in an interview, saying the actor was “missing out”.\n\n“She’s incredible, you’re really missing out. She looks just like you. Lyla needs a father,” she said.\n\n“It’s ironic how [Owen] keeps getting these father roles, he playing a father in his new movie, and he’s never met his own daughter.”\n\nLast week Varunie posted a photo of Lyla to celebrate her birthday. Lyla is adorable with wide set blue eyes and blonde hair.\n\n“Happy 3rd birthday to my wild child! I love you so much!!!!” the proud mum wrote."
