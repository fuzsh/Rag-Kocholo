It’s a beautiful boy and everyone is incredibly happy!”\n\nThe news of Duell’s pregnancy broke less than a week before the birth, but her parents had more time to prepare than the rest of us — they were by her side when the baby was born.\n\n“The family is thrilled,” Duell’s uncle said. “We all love Jade, she is an amazing girl.”\n\nWilson, 42, has previously dated Sheryl Crow and Kate Hudson, who is expecting another little one herself.\n\nread on for more owen wilson"
