        "text": "According to the reports, Lindqvist, who is Wilson's long time personal trainer, is six months pregnant with his child. The suggested due date is January next year.\n\nPHOTOS: Sexiest Movie Stars announced\n\nAn inside source told Star Magazine: \"Caroline is six months pregnant with Owen’s child…She was shocked to learn that she was pregnant but decided to keep the baby. Owen plans on being fully involved and will financially care for the child, but has no intention of settling down with Caroline, which is tearing her up.\"\n\nIt's unclear how long Wilson and Lindqvist have actually known each other, with some sources suggesting they met after Wilson's 2007 suicide attempt when he hired her to get him back into shape. Star magazine suggests however that the pair met in 2003 and have \"dated on and off for years.\"\n\nPHOTOS: Risky Movie Roles\n\nLindqvist, a former model, moved from Sweden 15 years ago, and is currently practicing as a realtor in California.\n\nWhile Lindqvist is still married, she is separated from husband plastic surgeon Dr. Ritu Chopra, filing for divorce on May 29 this year. Reps for the personal trainer insist that she got pregnant after the pair had separated.\n\nThis is the second child for Wilson, who has a two year old son, Robert, with former girlfriend Jade Duell. The pair split after just five months together."
