        "text": "Owen Wilson is expecting his second child!\n\nThe Internship actor is expecting the baby with personal trainer Caroline Lindqvist, Wilson’s rep confirmed on Thursday.\n\nThe rep for the actor, who is already father to a little boy named Robert Ford, two, with ex-girlfriend Jade Duell, declined to address any further details about the pregnancy.\n\nWilson, 44, and Lindqvist, 41, reportedly met in 2003 when she was working as his personal trainer and stayed close over the years, the New York Daily News reported. However, the two are not together and Lindqvist, 41, filed for divorce in May from her plastic surgeon ex-husband, Ritu Chopra, whom she married in 2004, Us Weekly reported.\n\nRegardless of their relationship status, the Wedding Crashers star is reportedly on board with being there for her and the baby.\n\n“Owen is very involved with the pregnancy,” a source told Us Weekly. “He isn’t in a relationship with Caroline, nor do they plan to be in one, but he is very supportive of everything. They see each other and talk often about what they want for the child. Owen is very open-minded about everything and has told Caroline he will do whatever he can.”\n\nWilson and Duell, Ford’s mother, split five months after the baby was born but the actor has still been involved with his son and talked about him quite a bit while he and costar Vince Vaughn were promoting The Internship over the summer. They spoke fondly of their children bonding on set.\n\n“It did kind of give you a good feeling just seeing the kids running around,” Wilson said at the time.\n\nThe actor, who has repeatedly lent his voice talents to kid-friendly films like Cars and Cars 2, will next be heard in Free Birds, an animated comedy about two turkeys trying to change Thanksgiving. The film, which costars Woody Harrelson, hits US theatres on November 1."
