        "text": "Meet The Fockers star Owen Wilson has become a dad for the first time, only days after it was revealed his girlfriend was pregnant.\n\nJade Duell gave birth to their first child in Hawaii with the Hollywood actor at her side. News that Owen was going to be a dad was kept quiet until less than a week ago.\n\nJade, 28, had the 6lb 13oz boy by a water birth at their home on the Hawaiian island of Maui on Friday after a marathon 18-hour labour. Jade works as an armed federal air marshal. Owen, 42, who also starred in sequel Little Fockers, met her on a flight. They have been together for more than a year. A friend said: \"They are both thrilled. Owen has been doing a celebratory hula dance. He has a beautiful boy and everyone is incredibly happy.\""
