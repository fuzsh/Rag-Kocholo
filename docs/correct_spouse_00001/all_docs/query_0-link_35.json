        "text": "Actor Owen Wilson is a new dad.\n\nA publicist for the 42-year-old actor confirms that Wilson and girlfriend Jade Duell welcomed a baby boy in Hawaii on Friday.\n\nWilson spokeswoman Ina Treciokas did not release additional details, but the Los Angeles Times reports the child, named Ford Linton Wilson, weighed in at 6 pounds, 13 ounces.\n\nWilson appeared in the recent films “Little Fockers” and “How Do You Know.” His other credits include “Marley & Me,” “Drillbit Taylor” and “Wedding Crashers.”\n\nKanye West, making fun of his infamous interruption of Taylor Swift, tweeted Britney Spears over her No. 1 new hit. She needn’t worry about him, he said, tweeting “I’mma let you be #1,” according to the New York Daily News.\n\nThe controversial rapper took to Twitter to joke around with the singer with the same line that made millions watching the VMAs cringe more than a year ago.\n\n“Yo Britney,” he tweeted. “I’m really happy for you and I’mma let you be #1, but me and Jay-Z single is one of the best songs of all time.”\n\nHis song “H.A.M..” which reached the No.2 spot on iTunes, is a collaboration with Jay-Z.\n\nThe tweet wasn’t the first time West made fun of his interruption of Taylor Swift’s acceptance speech at the 2009 VMAs that brought criticism on the rapper.\n\nIn a track he posted last summer, he finished the song “Uncle Charlie, by the way, and I’ma let you finish, but I got Beyonce on the track.”\n\nWhile the tweet to Spears was caught in a screengrab by popeater.com, West apparently received enough backlash from the apparently not-funny-yet joke that he took it down on Friday.\n\n“On a serious note, I’m truly happy for @AvrilLavigne and @BritneySpears … No hate in 2011!” he tweeted.\n\nOn Spears’ Twitter account, her manager Adam Leber, tweeted back at West, “Thanks for “letting” us be #1. Much appreciated …”\n\nMickey Rourke is spending a lot of time in the UK, working on preparations for his movie about Gareth Thomas, according to the website Janetcharltonshollywood.\n\nMickey will star as the first rugby player to come out of the closet in 2009. Macho Thomas was tormented by his secret and even and married his childhood sweetheart before admitting he was gay.\n\nAlthough Thomas is 6’3″ and 21 years younger than Mickey, he says “He’s the perfect person to play me.”\n\nMickey and Gareth have had several long meetings about the role. Gareth stubbornly insisted on Mickey although “Gays want someone hotter.” Thomas feels Mickey has the right sensitivity for the part.\n\nAretha Franklin has said she would like to have Halle Berry play her in a biopic, and it appears that what Queen of Soul decrees is what she’ll get.\n\nLast year, the singer sent out a press release to The Associated Press stating she wanted Oscar-winning superstar Halle Berry to tackle the lead role in an upcoming biopic about the powerhouse songstress. During a recent phone interview on “The Wendy Williams Show,” Franklin said Berry is set to star in the project.\n\n“Halle Berry is my pick,” Franklin said to a swell of cheers from the daytime-TV audience. The singer said Berry has been tapped to play an adult version of Franklin but added that the rest of the cast has not been firmed up. “There’s a young Aretha that has yet to be named.”\n\nFranklin — who is recovering from an undisclosed illness reported to be cancer — also said the film has been in the works for years but hinted that a flick could be in production soon now that all the necessary elements are coming together.\n\nIn September, Franklin said that, in addition to Berry, she wanted Academy Award-winning actor Denzel Washington and Oscar nominee Terrence Howard to appear in the film. The “Respect” diva had apparently already been in touch with the stars, saying that the trio were “enthusiastic about the project and have agreed to take on these roles, subject to further negotiation.” The script will be based on her 1999 autobiography “Aretha: From These Roots.”\n\n— The Associated Press also contributed to this report\n\nlsmith@denverpost.com\n\nMore celebrity headlines"
