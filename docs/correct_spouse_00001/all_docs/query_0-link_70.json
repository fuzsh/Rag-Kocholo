Put a condom on ffs\n\nLMAO what is protection?\n\njesus get a vasectomy\n\nwhy though? doesn't seem like he doesn't want the kid\n\nYeah, he has the means to provide for the child & it seems like he's emotionally invested.\n\nUS Weekly, tho. Lemme know when it's in People.\n\noops\n\nnice\n\nWhat with these famous men getting married women pregnant? It like a real life soap opera\n\nHe reminds me of my cousin. What makes these guys think it's okay to just have random, unprotected sex with women and have random kids with them? Ugh.\n\nAs Baby Spice once said - be a little bit wiser, put it on, PUT IT ON!\n\n2 Become 3, tbh.\n\naaahahaha\n\nLOL\n\nlol\n\nnot if you're octomom!\n\nlol\n\n(no subject) - annpaulveal Expand\n\nKind of reminds me of the Hugh Grant thing.\n\nThis really isn't that scandalous. The woman has probably been separated from her husband for a while. It seems more possible/likely for people at this age to be mature about not forcing a relationship but raising a child together.\n\nYa, i was going to say some people are separated for years before filing for divorce.\n\nit's so annoying when people think it's a scandal to date someone who is separated. Divorce can take a long time, the relationship is over by the time you separate.\n\nForreal most states require a full 12 months of separation before you can even proceed with the actual divorce, which can take plenty long just by itself. By the time your marriage is dissolved you're looking at multiple years of a relationship that's essentially over. Like HDU START DATING THREE YEARS AFTER ENDING YOUR LAST RELATIONSHIP.\n\nia\n\nPretty much agreed.\n\nShe's actively ending her marriage and has been for a while now. They're two adults who wanted to have a sexual but not emotional relationship. They're not going to try and force a standard marriage situation. Both parties seem interested and invested in the child and can support it.\n\nLike, what's the issue here? Yeah sure it would be super-rad if every child was born to parents who were deeply emotionally invested in their own relationship but, yannow, I could think of far worse situations than this one.\n\nDamn, married women out here securing them a payday for 18 years all willy-nilly out here.\n\nTale as old as God and Mary. Kind of.\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\nBow @ your icon\n\nwhere did you get your icon? or did u make it? :(\n\ni thought he was married. oops."
