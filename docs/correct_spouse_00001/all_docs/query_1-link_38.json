        "text": "Owen Wilson [Photo/Agencies]\n\nShirley Temple dead at 85\n\nJennifer Aniston to star in Cake\n\nOwen Wilson has named his newborn son Finn Lindqvist Wilson.\n\nThe 'Midnight in Paris' star, who also has a three-year-old son, Robert Ford, with his ex-girlfriend, Jade Duell, welcomed his second child with \"close friend\" Caroline Lindqvist into the world at Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre in Los Angeles on January 30.\n\nThe tot has been given both of his parents surnames, according to his birth certificate, obtained by gossip website TMZ.com, despite the fact they were never in a relationship and Caroline is still legally married to her estranged husband, plastic surgeon Dr. Ritu Chopra.\n\nSwedish born Caroline, 41, said last October: \"Owen and I decided to have a child even though we're not in a relationship. And we're not planning on starting a relationship, either.\n\n\"Owen and I are two close friends. We are really looking forward to it and can't wait to welcome our child at the end of January.\"\n\nThe personal trainer also denied Owen had ever been one of her clients as well as rubbishing rumours she'd had an affair with him before the end of her marriage.\n\nThe 45-year-old 'The Internship' star supported Caroline throughout the pregnancy and sources previously insisted he would be a hands-on father."
