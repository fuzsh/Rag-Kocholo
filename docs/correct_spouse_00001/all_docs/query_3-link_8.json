        "text": "On January 10, 2011, Wilson's representative announced that Wilson and his girlfriend Jade Duell were expecting a baby. Four days later, on January 14, it was confirmed that Duell had given birth in Hawaii to a baby boy, Robert Ford Wilson. Wilson and Duell had ended their relationship by June 2011\n\nOwen Wilson has a new role to tackle: fatherhood!\n\nThe 42-year-old Little Fockers star welcomed a baby boy with girlfriend Jade Duell in Hawaii Friday, a source confirms to UsMagazine.com.\n\nThe actor kept news of Duell's baby bump a secret until Monday -- but a source recently told Us that Wilson was \"very exited and involved with the pregnancy.\"\n\nThe first-time dad -- whose past loves include Kate Hudson and Sheryl Crow -- \"has been doing research and learning as much as he can,\" a source adds. \"He's super into it and asks a lot of questions to make sure he knows what's going on every step of the way.\"\n\nThough Wilson has yet to pop the question, he did offer Us some insight about how he realized Duell may be The One.\n\n\"When you stop talking about yourself and you're more open to listening to what they're interested in and what they want to talk, that's how you know,\" he told Us at December's How Do You Know premiere in Westwood, Calif. \"Maybe you're more open to even renting a movie like Steel Magnolias. Before you know it, you're getting late fees for Sleepless in Seattle and you're giving up the remote control! Although by that definition, not many men have been in love!\"\n\nIn January 2011, Wilson and his girlfriend Jade Duell had a son, Robert Ford Wilson. Wilson and Duell ended their relationship later that year."
