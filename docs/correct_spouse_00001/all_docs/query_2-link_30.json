        "text": "Owen Wilson and his girlfriend Jade Duell named their son Robert Ford Wilson, People has confirmed. Earlier reports by some outlets that the couple named their son Ford Linton Wilson were incorrect.\n\nThe couple hasn't made any public statements about the name (it does bring to mind the man who assassinated Jesse James in 1882, also Robert Ford). The couple, who revealed that they were expecting on Jan. 10, welcomed their baby Jan. 14 in Hawaii.\n\nRelated:"
