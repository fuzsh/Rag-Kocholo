        "text": "Funny guy Owen Wilson is about to take on a serious role: new dad.\n\nA source close to the actor told UsMagazine that his girlfriend Jade Buell is pregnant and “due any day.”\n\nBuell is currently in Hawaii, where she plans to give birth.\n\nWilson, 42, is “very excited and involved with the pregnancy,” the insider tells Us, adding that the couple “want to do everything as natural as possible.”\n\nAnother new dad says the birth of his daughter has given him a “different purpose.”\n\nVince Vaughn, whose wife, Kyla Weber, gave birth to daughter Locklyn Kyla on Dec. 18, says he’s loving the family life.\n\n“I’ll tell you When Kyla and I had the first pediatrician appointment, we gotta get the car seat and put it in the back of the car. Kyla buckled up and I got in the car. And I was like, ‘We’re a family.’ We’re going to an appointment as a family. It’s just a great feeling,” he told ET Canada.\n\n“The Dilemma” star says he loves the many good things about having a little girl, but acknowledges there are some worries that come with parenthood.\n\n“I feel so grateful. You know, my wife’s so great,” Vaughn, 40, notes. “But I gotta tell you. Just the minute they come out, so beautiful and just so sweet — I was just so glad that everyone was healthy.”\n\nBut, he adds, “My thing is getting ahead (of myself) and worrying about stuff. She’s only three weeks old, right?! People are like, ‘Where is she going to college?’ I didn’t even know she wanted to go to college!”\n\nVanity Fair announced this week that tween pop sensation Justin Bieber, in addition to mugging on the mag’s February cover, will be taking on the title of first-ever guest editor via Facebook this week.\n\nThe announcement sparked immediate reactions from fans and critics alike, who bombarded the Facebook page with comments of both adoration and disgust.\n\n“This is nuts. Perhaps VF is pulling a fast one on all of us and doing a social experiment on the idiocracy & infantile obsession had by tweens of society’s pop culture icons? ‘The rise and fall of Bieber Before Puberty… and After,'” one writer posted.\n\n“Dear VF, Please keep the Tiger Beat stuff off the cover. thanks, The Readers,” another added, with several Facebook users “liking” his note.\n\nIn response to the outpour of opinion to the announcement, a Vanity Fair rep took to the Facebook account to urge readers to be polite to the star.\n\n“Well, it’s good to know we can still trust you folks for uncensored feedback!” the rep wrote. “That said, we trust the adults among us will show some courtesy to our young guest.”\n\nBieber, who is the youngest male star ever featured on the cover of Vanity Fair, used his first post to let his fans know what exactly he’ll be doing in his new role this week.\n\n“Pretty cool that I get to host the Vanity Fair Facebook page this week,” the Biebs wrote. “I’m proud of my interview and cover – it was the most intense interview I’ve ever done.\n\n“Gonna be a fun week – make sure you make some comments because I will send one random fan who writes in the comments section a signed copy of my book,” he continued. “LEGGOOOO!”\n\nActor Michael Douglas says he’s beaten cancer.\n\nThe “Wall Street” star is revealing that radiation and chemotherapy treatments he’s been undergoing since August have completely gotten rid of the tumor in his throat.\n\n“I think the odds are, with the tumor gone and what I know about this particular type of cancer, that I’ve got it beat,” an ebullient Douglas said in an interview with Matt Lauer on NBC’s “Today” show.\n\nDouglas said he feels good and that he has started working out again to regain the 32 pounds he lost during what he described as “a wild six-month ride.”\n\n“I lost a lot of muscle mass, so I’m going to work on that,” said Douglas, adding that he was looking forward to his next movie, in which he plays the flamboyant piano man Liberace.\n\nDouglas, 66, was diagnosed in August with stage four throat cancer. From the start, he vowed to beat the disease.\n\n— lsmith@denverpost.com\n\nMore celebrity headlines"
