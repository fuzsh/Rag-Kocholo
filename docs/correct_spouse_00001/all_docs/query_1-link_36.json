        "text": "The 'Little Fockers' star's girlfriend, Jade Duell, gave birth to a baby boy who they named Ford Linton Wilson last Friday (14.01.11) in Hawaii and although the actor kept his partner’s pregnancy a secret until recently, his ‘Hall Pass’ co-star Carly thinks the actor will be a great parent.\n\nShe explained: \"He's actually really quiet. He's very reserved. He's just a normal sweet guy.\n\n\"I think he's going to be a good dad. Owen's normal, you know what I mean? He's not all crazy and wacky. He's not at all Hollywood. I think that makes a good parent.\"\n\nFriends have previously revealed that 42-year-old Owen - who has been dating Jade for over a year - was \"very excited and involved\" in the pregnancy.\n\nThe source added: \"He has been doing research and learning as much as he can.\n\n\"He's super into it and asks a lot of questions to make sure he knows what's going on every step of the way.\"\n\nThe baby, who weighed 6 pounds, 13 ounces, was reportedly born naturally via a water birth at Owen’s oceanfront home in Maui, with Jade's labour lasting 18 hours.\n\nA source said: \"Owen and Jade are thrilled! Owen has been doing a celebratory hula dance all afternoon! It's a beautiful boy and everyone is incredibly happy!\""
