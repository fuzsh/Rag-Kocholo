        "text": "American actor Owen Wilson, 49, whose most recent role was in the hit film Wonder, welcomed a baby last month. But according to sources, he isn’t interested in being a father to the infant.\n\nAmerican publication Us Weekly is reporting they have spoken to a source who claims Wilson has not met his new daughter, Lyla, whom he fathered with Varunie Vongsvirates, 34, a former business development manager, and his reported girlfriend of five years.\n\nVongsvirates, who shares snaps of her love of fitness on social media, was open about her pregnancy all year, sharing a photo on Instagram of the ultrasound in June – by which time the couple, it seems, had already split.\n\nLyla was born on 9 October, 2018. A source has now told Us Weekly, “[Wilson] refuses to meet his daughter. He even checked the no visitation box in court in June… He does not want to visit [and does not] want any custody of her.”\n\nIn June, the Wedding Crashers star reportedly took a paternity test to confirm he is Lyla’s father. A representative for Wilson told Us Weekly he would not comment on the matter.\n\nLyla is now a sister to Wilson’s seven-year-old son Robert Ford, whom he had with then-girlfriend Jade Duell. The couple split in 2011, and were reportedly not together at the time of the birth.\n\nWilson then had four-year-old son Finn with his then-personal trainer, Caroline Lindqvist, who was mid-divorce (separated but technically still married) with plastic surgeon husband Ritu Chopra.\n\nIt is indeed a very modern family, especially as Wilson does not now appear to be in a relationship with any of the mothers of his children.\n\nOf course, that does not mean that the actor is not an excellent and loving father. In the below clip from his appearance on Ellen in June 2017, Wilson speaks proudly and intimately of his sons, calling Ford “a little stuntman in training”, and sharing a personal video of the child’s antics in a swimming pool.\n\nWilson is certainly not the only high-profile celebrity with a somewhat complicated family life. Soccer superstar Cristiano Ronaldo has four children, and has been very private about their family arrangement.\n\nRonaldo’s oldest son, Cristiano Ronaldo Jr, seven, resides full-time with his father. The identity of Cristiano Junior’s mother is unknown, but reports have always circulated implying that the mother was paid £10 million for her silence and to give full custody to Ronaldo.\n\nRonaldo’s second and third borns, twins Eva Maria and Meteo, also arrived in equally private circumstances. The soccer star announced in June 2017 that he had fathered twins via a surrogate mother in the United States. It was an announcement that made headlines because at the time, he was dating model Irina Shayk – who was not the mother.\n\nRonaldo’s fourth child, a daughter named Alana, arrived in November 2017. For the first time, the identity of the mother of one of his children was public knowledge. Ronaldo confirmed in an interview on July 18, 2017, that he and Spanish girlfriend Georgina Rodriguez were expecting their first baby together.\n\nBritish actor Hugh Grant‘s domestic life seems to be equally complex. In September 2011, Grant welcomed his daughter Tabitha, the product of what his publicist called a “fleeting affair” with Chinese restaurant receptionist Tinglan Hong.\n\nHugh Grant’s second and third children – two boys – were actually in utero at the same time, to different mothers.\n\nThe first to arrive, John Mungo, was born in September 2012 to Swedish television producer Anna Eberstein. The other, Felix, was born three months later in December 2012; Grant’s second child with Tinglan Hong.\n\nFrom there, Grant and Eberstein welcomed another child – who has never been publicly named – in December 2015.\n\nIn a more traditional move, the couple married earlier this year."
