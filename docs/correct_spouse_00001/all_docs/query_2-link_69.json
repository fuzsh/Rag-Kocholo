        "text": "Owen Wilson has three children …but he has only met two of them, apparently. A DNA test result led to the news breaking into headlines a few years ago, but Owen Wilson’s ex says he’s never his daughter.\n\nOwen Wilson’s youngest child, five-year-old Lyla, was born in October 2018 to the Hollywood star’s on-again, off-again partner, Varunie Vongsvirates. The pair dated for about five years, but since Lyla’s birth, the pair haven’t seen him, she says.\n\nA paternity test and court documents\n\nInsiders told Us Weekly a month after his little girl was born that he “refuses to meet his daughter. He even checked the no visitation box in court in June … He does not want to visit [and does not] want any custody of her.” She claimed the actor was told that Varunie, 40, was pregnant four weeks into the term, but he wanted no part in her life.\n\nDespite not contacting her “at all” or being present at the youngster’s birth after, there were doubts about her paternity. However, an insider said he would “fulfill all of his obligations” to support her.\n\nA source said at the time: “Of course, if a paternity test establishes that he is the father of another child, he will fulfill all of his obligations to support his child.”\n\nCourt documents obtained by Radar showed he had demanded a test to determine if he was the baby’s father. Then, when it showed Owen Wilson was after his daughter’s birth, he marked “none” on a petition about having visitation rights.\n\nMORE: Arnold Schwarzenegger ‘taking things slow’ with new girlfriend 35 years younger\n\nVarunie and her daughter receive a $25,000 child support check monthly, according to the documents. His ex was given a one-off payment of $70,000 to help with medical and legal costs. Lyla will also be covered by the celebrity’s Screen Actors Guild medical insurance.\n\nHis representatives told Us Weekly at the time: “This is a private matter, and it’s not appropriate to comment further.”\n\nOwen Wilson helps his daughter out financially\n\nDespite there being a clause in the documents that states the former couple shall “not make disparaging and/or derogatory remarks about the other party, or their significant others, if any, in the presence of the minor child,” Varunie has made very cutting comments publically about the 55-year-old.\n\nShe told the Daily Mail that it was “ironic” that the movie star often landed fatherly roles despite never having met one of his children.\n\n“He helps financially, but it’s never been about that,” she told the outlet. “Lyla needs a father.”\n\nWhen asked if she had a message for her ex-boyfriend, she replied at the time: “You should see your daughter, she’s incredible, you’re really missing out. She looks just like you.”\n\nMeet the actor’s children\n\nBefore Lyla, Owen welcomed two sons with two different partners, all of whom he maintains close relationships with.\n\nHe shares Robert Ford, 13, with ex-Jade Duell, and nine-year-old Finn with Caroline Lindqvist, a fitness trainer.\n\nTalking about being a strict parent during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel, he said: “I’m pretty strict about manners and everything. But, yeah, you know, I’m not unreasonably strict. I guess I’m a little old-fashioned.\n\n“You know, I’ve said to both of them, ‘I don’t care what Uncle Woody and what Uncle Willy do, there’s no smoking pot in this house’. My house, my rules.”\n\nMORE: Jennifer Lopez sets pulses racing with barely-there cut-out top"
