        "text": "'Owen is Very Involved With the Pregnancy,' According to Reports\n\nOwen Wilson will reportedly become a father for the second time with married personal trainer Caroline Lindqvist. The 44-year-old actor has no plans to become a couple with the soon-to-be-single future mother of his child, but he will be there for the baby, according to reports.\n\nOwen Wilson's involvement with Lindqvist and her subsequent pregnancy was confirmed by his representative to The Los Angeles Times Thursday. The \"You, Me and Dupree\" actor has plans to be an involved father to the baby.\n\n\"Owen is very involved with the pregnancy,\" a source told Us Weekly. \"He isn't in a relationship with Caroline, nor do they plan to be in one, but he is very supportive of everything. They see each other and talk often about what they want for the child.\"\n\nGet Our Latest News for FREE\n\nSubscribe to get daily/weekly email with the top stories (plus special offers!) from The Christian Post. Be the first to know.\n\n\"Owen is very open-minded about everything and has told Caroline he will do whatever he can,\" the insider added.\n\nLindqvist, who is six months pregnant, is currently married to plastic surgeon Ritu Chopra, but filed for divorce about a month after she reportedly became pregnant. Her representative said that despite the seemingly dubious timing, the 41-year-old personal trainer had been separated from her husband long before the pregnancy.\n\nLindqvist and Wilson met in 2003 when she became his personal trainer. Even though their professional relationship ended, their personal one didn't and they stayed close, according to The New York Daily News.\n\nThe purported arrangement with Lindqvist is a familiar one for Wilson. After his first child, Robert Ford, was born to girlfriend Jade Duell 2011, the pair split up just five months later."
