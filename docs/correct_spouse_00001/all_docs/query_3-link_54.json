        "text": "Owen Wilson and and his sons had some ultra-fun father-son bonding over the weekend. The trio went to see LA’s soccer team, the Los Angeles Football Club, take on the NY Red Bulls. The game may have ended in a 2-2 tie, but the Wilson boys had the biggest sideline celebrations during their rare public outing.\n\nThe actor shares son Ford, 13 with his ex-girlfriend Jade Duell and Finn, 10 with former trainer Caroline Lindqvist. In a video posted by LAFC, the three were seen cheering on the team, holding player Denis Bouanga’s jersey.\n\nEach time we see them, the boys look more and more like their dad. Especially Ford, who now has his father’s signature long and wavy blond locks. They also have the same long faces, wide eyes, and ear-to-ear grins.\n\nWilson told Esquire in 2021 that he lives near his sons and that everyone “gets along.” He revealed that he loves making up bedtime stories for the two.\n\n“Sometimes telling the stories at night, you do take a little pride that these guys are into this story! One of them even said, ‘Dad, you should do something with this. This is a really good story!’ It was about this little pack of boys in a post-apocalyptic world, and there’s a pack of dogs — I play to my audience.”\n\nWilson is also dad to a 5-year-old daughter, Lyla, whom he shares with ex Varunie Vongsvirates and reportedly “refuses to meet.” “He even checked the no visitation box in court in June … He does not want to visit [and does not] want any custody of her,” a source told Us Weekly soon after Lyla’s birth.\n\nIn 2019, Vongsvirates told The Daily Mail that she “begged” the Marley & Me actor to be a part of their little girl’s life.\n\n“He helps financially but it’s never been about that,” she told the outlet, adding, “Lyla needs a father. It’s ironic how [Owen] keeps getting these father roles, he’s playing a father in his new movie, and he’s never met his own daughter.”\n\nIt’s unclear why the Wedding Crashers star has a relationship with his sons but not his daughter. And while the intricacies of every blended family is different, we’d certainly love to see Wilson and Lyla celebrating on the sidelines of an LAFC game one day."
