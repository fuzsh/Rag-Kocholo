        "text": "If the National Enquirer is to be believed -- and sometimes it really is -- Owen Wilson is about to expand his franchises. The tabloid says the actor has fathered a child with his personal trainer, who is married. But it's oaky, because she's in the middle of getting divorced.\n\nThe Enquirer says 41-year-old Caroline Lindqvist, who was born in Sweden, is due to have Wilson's baby in January. She met Wilson, 44, some time after his 2007 suicide attempt after he and Kate Hudson broke up. She apparently has been separated from her plastic surgeon husband Ritu Chopra for more than a year.\n\n\"Caroline broke the news to Owen this past May shortly after confirming that he was the father,\" a source told the tabloid. \"A few days later she filed for divorce from her husband. Caroline begged him for a quiet, hassle-free divorce, and he obliged. Neither has hired an attorney, and Caroline is going to walk away from the divorce with practically nothing. But she is going to score big time by having Owen's baby â€“ she'll be set for life.\""
