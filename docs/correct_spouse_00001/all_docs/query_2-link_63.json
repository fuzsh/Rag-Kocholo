        "text": "He has a reputation as a bit of a ladies man – but actor Owen Wilson has once again sparked romance rumours after being spotted with a 21-year-old college tennis player at the French Open.\n\nThe Zoolander star – who has been filming the sequel to the 2001 hit alongside co-star Ben Stiller – was seen laughing and joking with Wan-Yi Sweeting as they watched the action at the Stade Roland Garros on Friday.\n\nAccording to The Sun Owen, who is 25 years older than Wan-Li, has bonded with his new companion over their love of tennis – and they certainly seemed to be getting on very well as they sat courtside.\n\nAlthough the actor has never married, he has two children by previous partners as well as being romantically involved with a string of celebrities.\n\nHe previously dated singer Sheryl Crow in the early 2000s, and also had a relationship with actress Kate Hudson after they met on the set of the 2006 film You, Me and Dupree.\n\nThe pair had reportedly been planning to marry in 2008 but split for good the following year.\n\nOwen went on to father his first child, Robert Ford Wilson, with girlfriend Jade Duell in 2011, although they broke up just months later.\n\nHe also welcomed a second son, Finn Lindqvist Wilson, with personal trainer Caroline Lindqvist last year, although she later told People magazine they were ‘not planning’ on taking their relationship further.\n\nThe actor will be bringing his model alter-ego Hansel back to cinema screens early next year when Zoolander 2 is released."
