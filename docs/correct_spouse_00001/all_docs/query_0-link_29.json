        "text": "Actor Owen Wilson and Varunie Vongsvirates dated for five years. However, their relationship ended around the time Varunie realized she was pregnant. However, Wilson did not contact her during the pregnancy or after the birth. In June 2018, he agreed to take a paternity test, which reportedly did not rule him out of being the father. Still, he made it clear via court documents that he was not interested in custody or seeing his daughter in any way. So Lyla Aranya Wilson was born in October 2018 without him there.\n\nOwen Wilson’s Three Children\n\nWhile Lyla may be Owen Wilson’s only daughter, Wilson has two sons from two previous relationships. Robert Ford Wilson was born in Hawaii in 2011 to Wilson and his girlfriend at the time, Jade Duell. They had dated for about a year before they learned they were expecting. Two years later, Wilson fathered another son, Finn, with fitness trainer Caroline Lindqvist, who was going through a divorce at the time. Until today, Wilson remains active in his sons’ lives. In fact, he seems to take a lot of pride in his children.\n\nWhile he was promoting his movie “Hall Pass” in 2011, he spoke about his firstborn. “He’s not, I wouldn’t say, a wonderful conversationalist at this point, but he kind of doesn’t have to be, he’s so cute. He becomes a sort of a little scene-stealer when he comes in the room. [He’s like] Steve McQueen in The Magnificent Seven, where he didn’t have a lot of dialogue … you just kind of gave him the camera and he was able to hold the screen. I feel like Ford is heading in that direction.”\n\nRead: 12 Critical Things You Should Never Tolerate\n\nA Proud Father\n\nOwen Wilson also spoke about the new sleep schedule that comes with a baby. “What they say about newborns and not getting a lot of sleep, that’s true. You look at every place as a potential nap place. I’m looking at this couch, maybe at commercial break [I’ll take a] little shut-eye there.” [1]\n\nIn 2017, he spoke proudly about Finn worships his older brother on the Ellen DeGeneres Show to promote Cars 3 in 2017. “It’s unbelievable. I mean, anything Ford says is just, like, the funniest thing ever, and I can make and joke and it’s, like, crickets. It’s like nothing from those guys… I’m already sort of seeing how they’re gonna be as teenagers, where they’re gonna be sort of be ganging up on me.\n\n“We went to Sequoia National Park, and they have the biggest tree in the world. I’m like: ‘Guys, this is the biggest tree in the world,’ and Ford’s like: ‘I’ve seen bigger. And I’m like: ‘Well, no, Ford, actually you haven’t seen bigger. This is the General Sherman tree. This is the biggest tree.’ And he’s like: ‘If you say so. And I’m like: ‘No, it’s not if I say so! There’s the plaque right here!’ And he’s like: ‘I can’t read.’’‘\n\nHowever, things went sour in his relationship with Varune when Owen Wilson discovered she was pregnant. He wanted nothing to do with the child. He had allegedly changed his phone number and cut off all contact with Varunie. Although it’s not confirmed the child is his, the paternity test says “the alleged father is not excluded as the biological father of the fetus.” However, the uncertainty and the end of his relationship with Varunie may be part of his decision not to be part of Lyla’s life.\n\n“Owen has never met Lyla. Never.”\n\nIn 2020, reports claimed that Own Wilson pays about $25,000 a month for child support. He allegedly also paid $70,000 to Varunie to cover her legal fees, labor coach, and a night nurse. Although the documents show he didn’t want any visitation rights, he had agreed to add his daughter to his medical insurance. However, Vongsvirates has sole custody and only she could decide about Lyla’s health, welfare, and education. [2]\n\nEither way, Varunie explained that Lyla Aranya feels the lack of a father’s presence in her life. “Owen has never met Lyla. Never,‘ Varunie said. “He helps financially but it’s never been about that.” She added that “Lyla needs a father. It’s ironic how [Owen] keeps getting these father roles, he’s playing a father in his new movie, and he’s never met his own daughter.”\n\nWhen asked if she has a message for Owen Wilson, Varunie said, “You should see your daughter, she’s incredible, you’re really missing out. She looks just like you.” [3]"
