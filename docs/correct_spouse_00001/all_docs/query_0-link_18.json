He left the airport and drove around Santa Monica for hours.\"\n\nOwen - who has previously dated Kate Hudson and Sheryl Crow - has previously stated he thought of Jade as an ideal partner for him because he was open to \"listening\" to her.\n\nHe said: \"When you stop talking about yourself and you're more open to listening to what they're interested in and what they want to talk, that's how you know.\n\n\"Maybe you're more open to even renting a movie like 'Steel Magnolias'. Before you know it, you're getting late fees for 'Sleepless in Seattle'.\""
