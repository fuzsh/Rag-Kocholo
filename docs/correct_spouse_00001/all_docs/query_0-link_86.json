        "text": "It's official: Owen Wilson is a father times two!\n\nThe actor's personal trainer, Caroline Lindqvist, gave birth to a baby boy on Thursday morning, the actor's rep confirms to E! News.\n\nThis is the second child for the 45-year-old Wedding Crashers star, who is already a dad to his 3-year-old son Ford from a previous relationship.\n\nWilson's rep confirmed the pregnancy news in early October. At the time, a source told E! News that Lindqvist was going through a divorce with her plastic surgeon husband, but did not plan on pursuing a relationship with the actor after her split was finalized or after the baby was born.\n\nNEWS: Owen Wilson expecting a baby with his personal trainer\n\n\"She is just happy that Owen is helping her out any way that he can,\" the source told us after the baby news broke, adding that Wilson was \"very supportive\" of Lindqvist's pregnancy. \"They have an amicable relationship and [care about] what's best for their unborn child.\"\n\n\"They get together for dinner and see each other fairly often,\" the source revealed just three months ago. \"Owen has shown a desire to be involved with ultrasounds and doctor appointments. He's definitely invested in their unborn child.\"\n\nU.S. & World\n\nThe Internship star welcomed son Ford on Jan. 14, 2011, with then-girlfriend Jade Duell. He most recently lent his voice to the animated comedy Free Birds, which also starred Woody Harrelson and Amy Poehler.\n\n--Reporting by Marcus Mulick"
