        "text": "Owen Wilson’s married personal trainer is six months pregnant with his baby, according to a report.\n\nStar Magazine reports that the “Wedding Crashers” star’s longtime personal trainer, statuesque blonde Caroline Lindqvist , 41, is pregnant with Wilson’s child even though she is still married, but separated, from a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon Ritu Chopra.\n\nThe magazine quotes an insider who says, “Caroline is six months pregnant with Owen’s child…She was shocked to learn that she was pregnant but decided to keep the baby. Owen plans on being fully involved and will financially care for the child, but has no intention of settling down with Caroline, which is tearing her up.\n\nAccording to the report the actor and Swedish-born Caroline met at a party in 2003 and have, “dated on and off for years.” The insider added, “They love to work out together, running the steps in Santa Monica.”\n\nA rep for Caroline insisted that she got pregnant after she and Chopra separated, according to the report. She filed for divorce on May 29.\n\nWilson also has a two-year-old son Robert with former girlfriend Jade Duell. Eternal bachelor Wilson split with Duell five months after the child’s birth.\n\nA rep for Wilson – who is currently filming the oddly-titled movie “Squirrels to the Nuts” with Jennifer Aniston in New York – didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment."
