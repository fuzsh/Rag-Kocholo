He's super into it and asks a lot of questions to make sure he knows what's going on every step of the way.\"\n\nPost by lonegazer on\n\nThat's a surprise and I bet it is the girl pictured in Paris and Canada and the one talked about in that Hall Pass thread, the government worker from Viriginia, someone's already asked today if it's her. A comment on Huffington Post by an ex-colleague says she only told him she was pregnant six weeks ago so she managed to keep it a secret for a fair while. But reading back the Hall Pass thread, the person who knew her replied last August to a comment from a previous poster who'd said they hoped Owen didn't become a father too soon with this girl (true in the end) - 'as far as being a father guess we will know in a few months!!!! Aha! It didn't mean anything then but obviously it was known to a few already.\n\nwww.onlocationvacations.com/2010/04/19/hall-pass-filming-at-peachtree-hills-park-in-atlanta-today/\n\nI'm still waiting to see a baby Lukey? Meg's been with him for nearly 3 years now so who knows, they could be next.\n\nPost by cookie on\n\nWell, good for Owen. I am glad to hear that he is happy and settling down. It is time. I bet Mr. and Mrs. Wilson are ecstatic...their fourth grandchild! How in the world do they keep these things a secret, though?\n\nJade is a pretty name. This is the girl who visited him in Vancouver and Paris, too, right? I remember thinking at the time that it was nice to see Owen with a girl who was not all hootchied up with everything hanging out. I guess she was covering up a little Wilson bun in the oven. (Would she even have been pregnant then? Ha! I can't count backwards.)\n\nI bet Luke is engaged and/or married and/or expecting with Meg in 2011. Gotta keep up with those big bros!\n\nwww.laineygossip.com/Owen_Wilson_with_Woody_Harrelson_and_brother_Andrew_hiking_Grouse_Mountain_31may10.aspx\n\nx17online.com/gallery/view_gallery.php?gallery=MCotillardWAllenOWilson072610_X17&index=31\n\nx17online.com/gallery/view_gallery.php?gallery=MCotillardWAllenOWilson072610_X17&index=33\n\nx17online.com/gallery/view_gallery.php?gallery=owilson072510_X17\n\nI guess birth control is just not cool these days, huh? LOL!\n\nUPDATED TO ADD: Lonegazer - You and I were posting the same thing at the same time. Great minds?\n\nPost by cookie on\n\nHere is a comment on the EW.com site:\n\nTrue story. They met on a flight from LA to Washington D.C. while he was filming that new movie with Paul Rudd and Reese Witherspoon. At the time she was living with a boyfriend in Virginia and needless to say they shortly thereafter broke up. Talk about a tough one to tell your parents. ‘Jade and I broke up because she was sleeping with Owen Wilson’. Owen and her continued seeing each other while her and the ex boyfriend were living with one another and later she got pregnant and moved into his pool house.\n\nThe meeting-on-a-plane part seems to be true. I wonder if she was the 'friend' that Owen talked about who was with Andrew when he got bitten by the shark in Hawaii. I wonder if she is the one who tied the BlackBerry cord around his ankle. Easy there, sister. Be careful with THE Sexy Beast."
