        "text": "In an interview on The Ellen Degeneres Show in 2017, Wilson opened up about his family life: “Sometimes it feels like I’m already seeing how they’re gonna be as teenagers, where they’re gonna be ganging up on me.”\n\nWhen chatting to Esquire in 2021, he added that he and his two sons “get along” and that he lives with them on a “single dad schedule”.\n\nSo what about his daughter, Lyla? Her mother Varunie Vongsvirates told British media in 2021 that, “He has never met her unfortunately.”\n\nHere’s everything we know about Wilson’s reportedly estranged five-year-old daughter:\n\nWhen was Lyla Aranya Wilson born?\n\nAccording to People, Lyla Aranya Wilson was born on October 9, 2018, to Owen Wilson and Varunie Vongsvirates – who gave Lyla her Thai middle name to honour her own father’s heritage.\n\n“My sweet little princess Lyla Aranya Wilson, born on 10-09-18,” she wrote on Instagram upon Lyla’s birth.\n\nHow many kids does Owen Wilson have?\n\nPer People, Wilson, 55, has three kids. He shares his first son, 13-year-old Robert Ford Wilson, with his then-girlfriend Jade Duell; his second son, 10-year-old Finn Lindqvist Wilson with personal trainer Caroline Lindqvist; and his five-year-old daughter, Lyla Aranya Wilson, with Vongsvirates.\n\nWhen talking about parenting with Esquire in 2021, he said, “Sometimes telling the stories at night, you do take a little pride that these guys are into this story! One of them even said, ‘Dad, you should do something with this. This is a really good story!’ It was about this little pack of boys in a post-apocalyptic world, and there’s a pack of dogs – I play to my audience.”\n\nHas Owen Wilson ever been married?\n\nWho is the mother of Owen Wilson’s daughter?\n\nA paternity test reportedly confirmed that Wilson was indeed the father in 2018.\n\nWhy does Owen Wilson reportedly refuse to meet his daughter?\n\nDespite playing the doting dad in various Hollywood films, Wilson has been criticised for not meeting his daughter in real life. In 2018, a source told Us Weekly that Wilson “refuses to meet his daughter” and “he even checked the no visitation box in court in June … he does not want to visit [and does not] want any custody of her”.\n\nLyla was also described as being the spitting image of her father. “The baby looks just like Owen,” said the source.\n\nIt’s unclear why he hasn’t met her yet, but her mother spoke up about the situation in an interview in 2019. “Owen has never met Lyla. Never,” Vongsvirates told British media while she was out in Los Angeles. “He helps financially, but it’s never been about that.”\n\nShe added, “Lyla needs a father. It’s ironic how [Owen] keeps getting these father roles, he’s playing a father in his new movie, and he’s never met his own daughter.”\n\nWhen asked if she would like to relay anything to Wilson, she responded, “You should see your daughter, she’s incredible, you’re really missing out. She looks just like you.”\n\nAs reported by The Things, he’s currently paying around US$25,000 a month in child support."
