Owen Wilson has reportedly split from girlfriend Jade Duell.

The Midnight In Paris actor and Duell - who welcomed their first child together in January - are said to have ended their relationship over Wilson's inability to commit.

"Owen wanted the freedom to do what he wanted with his friends, both male and female, while remaining a family unit with Jade and the baby," a source told The National Enquirer.

"But Jade wasn't willing to go along with that, so Owen decided to end things with her instead of cheating behind her back."

Duell is said to have taken the couple's 5-month-old son Robert with her to New York while Wilson remains in California.

Wilson previously confessed that he finds fatherhood "exhausting" and has a hard time keeping up with his baby son.
