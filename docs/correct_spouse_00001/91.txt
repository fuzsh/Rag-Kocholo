Owen Wilson has a baby boy

The couple has not revealed what inspired the name. However, the name is perhaps best associated with the American outlaw who famously killed Jesse James in 1882.

Wilson, 42, and Duell welcomed the baby last week in Hawaii, shortly after her pregnancy was revealed. This is Wilson's first child.
