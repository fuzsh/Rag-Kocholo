For archaeologists, missing gravesites aren’t that uncommon. When put into perspective, it’s not surprising that we can’t locate the graves of many famous … Continue reading Where Are the Human Remains?: Fielding and Betty Lewis\n\nMeet the Lewis Family: John and Fielding Jr.\n\nFielding Lewis was married twice. He and Catharine Washington, his first wife, had three children: John, Frances and Warner. Both Warner and Frances died leaving John as the sole heir from this first marriage. After Catharine’s death, Fielding married Betty Washington, and not quite a year later Fielding Lewis Jr. was born in 1751.
