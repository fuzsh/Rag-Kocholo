The following year he entered the formation program of the Province attended Villanova University, from which he received his B.A. degree in English. He was received as a novice on August 16, 1983 and made his first profession of vows on August 4, 1984.

He made his solemn profession on May 15, 1988, and was ordained to the priesthood on November 18, 1989 by Bishop John H. Ricard, S.S.J. at St. Augustine Parish, the Mother Church of African Americans. At this time he had already been ministering at St. Augustine and remained there as associate pastor until 1996. He was responsible for the widely-known music and liturgical traditions of the parish, and co-authored several pieces with the renowned songwriter Leon C. Roberts. During this period he was a member, of the Augustinian College Community in Washington. Later he became a member of St. Ezekiel Moreno Friary in Silver Spring, MD, and was assigned to St. Thomas of Villanova Friary, Villanova from 2008 until his death.\n\nIn 1995 Father Payne became Director of the He Rose Project at the Duke Ellington School of the Arts.

In 2014, the Board of Directors appointed him Head of School, with an effective date of August 1, 2014. After a few short months in this latest position, Father John collapsed on Thursday, October 9, of an apparent heart attack, at the school. He was rushed to the hospital but died shortly after.\n\nAs the chancellor of Washington’s public schools stated, “(Father Payne) had an abundance of faith in his students, showed them love every single day, and set an example that created a welcoming and thriving school community.”\n\nA wake was held on Sunday, October 19, 2014 at St. Augustine Church in Washington D.C.. His funeral Mass was celebrated at the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, in Washington, D.C., on Monday, October 20, 2014, with 4,000 people in attendance.
