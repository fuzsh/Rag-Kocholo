        "text": "In 1877, the Founding Fathers of the United States and other eminent men and women appeared in a vision to Wilford Woodruff, president of the St. George Temple, for the purpose of completing their temple work. President Woodruff, assisted by others, immediately went forth and had the ordinances performed for these men and women. A listing of those who appeared can be found below.\n\nDate: 1877\n\nLocation: St. George Temple\n\nInspiring Narrative by Wilford Woodruff\n\nTwo weeks before I left St. George, the spirits of the dead gathered around me, wanting to know why we did not redeem them. Said they, “You have had the use of the Endowment House for a number of years, and yet nothing has ever been done for us. We laid the foundation of the government you now enjoy, and we never apostatized from it, but we remained true to it and were faithful to God.\n\nEveryone of those men that signed the Declaration of Independence, with General Washington, called upon me as an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ, in the Temple at St. George, two consecutive nights, and demanded at my hands that I should go forth and attend to the ordinances of the House of God for them.\n\nI straightway went into the baptismal font and called upon Brother McCallister to baptize me for the signers of the Declaration of Independence, and fifty other eminent men, making one hundred in all, including John Wesley, Columbus, and others.\n\nWhen Brother McAllister had baptized me for the 100 names I baptized him for 21, including General Washington and his forefathers and all the Presidents of the United States–except three. Sister Lucy Bigelow Young went forth into the font and was baptized for Martha Washington and her family and 70 of the ’eminent women’ of the world.\n\nWilford Woodruff, Conference Report, April 10, 1898; Discourses of Wilford Woodruff, 160-61; Wilford Woodruff Journal, August 21, 1877.\n\nIn the April 1898 General Conference, President Woodruff again recalled this sacred experience:\n\nI am going to bear my testimony to this assembly, if I never do it again in my life, that those men who laid the foundation of this American government and signed the Declaration of Independence were the best spirits the God of heaven could find on the face of the earth. They were choice spirits, not wicked men. General Washington and all the men that labored for the purpose were inspired of the Lord. Another thing I am going to say here, because I have a right to say it. Everyone of those men that signed the Declaration of Independence, with General Washington, called upon me, as an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ, in the Temple at St. George, two consecutive nights, and demanded at my hands that I should go forth and attend to the ordinances of the House of God for them. Men are here, I believe, that know of this, Brother J. D. T. McAllister, David H. Cannon and James S. Bleak. Brother McAllister baptized me for all those men, and then I told these brethren that it was their duty to go into the Temple and labor until they had got endowments for all of them. They did it. Would those spirits have called up on me, as an Elder in Israel to perform that work if they had not been noble spirits before God? They would not.”\n\nWilford Woodruff, Conference Report, April 1989, pp. 89-90.\n\nList of Eminent Spirits\n\nThese are the names recorded in the journal of Wilford Woodruff and on the Temple records as those who appeared to him for two consecutive nights requesting their ordinance work be completed:\n\nFamily of George Washington\n\nGeorge Washington (was ordained a High Priest at this time)\n\nMary Ball Washington, Mother of George Washington\n\nMartha Dandridge, Wife of George Washington\n\nMartha Parke Custis, Daughter of Martha Washington\n\nJohn Washington\n\nWife of John Washington\n\nSir Henry Washington\n\nWife of Henry Washington\n\nLawrence Washington\n\nAnne Fairfax, Wife of Lawrence Washington\n\nWife of Lawrence Washington\n\nAugustine Washington\n\nM.

Cowley\n\nJames G. Bleak\n\nVicki Jo Anderson, author of the book, The Other Eminent Men of Wilford Woodruff\n\nVicki Jo Anderson is the author of the book, The Other Eminent Men of Wilford Woodruff. This book is the effort of her years of research to bring forth biographical sketches of the “other eminent men” mentioned by Wilford Woodruff who appeared to him in the St. George Temple, asking that their temple work be done. In the introduction to her book, she explains her reasons for compiling this book, as well as the Divine help she received throughout its compilation:\n\nOne day, while reading from the book “The Vision or The Degrees of Glory” (a compilation of talks and writings of the early brethren of the Church), she came across the testimony of President Wilford Woodruff regarding the appearance of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence in the St. George Temple in August 1877. Quoting from the introduction to her book, Sis. Anderson writes:\n\nThe purpose of their visit was to request their temple ordinances be done. . . . President Woodruff stated that not only was he baptized for the Signers of the Declaration of Independence, but also ‘fifty other eminent men.’\n\nFifty other eminent men–the phrase seemed to leap at me. I was struck with a great desire to know the names of these men . . . [I was told] that I could find their names in Wilford Woodruff’s journal. That summer we were able to visit Brigham Young University. My husband and I went to the Special Collections section of the library to see if we could locate the names. Because we had limited research time, we began anxiously searching through the many volumes of President Woodruff’s journals. At random we selected one from a group of four or five volumes . . . When I lifted the cover of my book, the pages seemed to turn themselves until they fell open to the page containing names of the signers, and the ‘other eminent men’! It was as if someone was at my shoulder, as anxious as I, to have these men’s names known.\n\nPresident Woodruff said of these men in his journal that they were noted men of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries; two exceptions were Christopher Columbus and Amerigo Vespucci. After recording the names of each of these eminent men and stating that he was baptized personally for them, President Woodruff wrote: ‘Sister Lucy Bigelow Young went forth into the font and was baptized for Martha Washington and her family and seventy of the eminent women of the world.’ This present volume contains only the biographies of the eminent men. The women will appear in a later volume.\n\nAlthough President Woodruff gave the number as fifty men, he recorded only forty-five names. I believe that President Woodruff’s statement was not precise, but rather an estimate of the number of many men who appeared. In his journal he specified that there were one hundred men in all. The names of the signers total fifty-four; by adding the forty-five listed eminent men, the total number comes to ninety-nine. As we searched the temple records, we found in the endowments of these eminent men the name of Sir Edmund Burke, whose name was not listed in the journal. It is possible that a clerical error was made, omitting Burke’s name. I am including Edmund Burke, bringing the total number of eminent men to forty-six, matching President Woodruff’s journal total of one hundred. These one hundred names do not include the United States presidents whose names were also recorded in President Woodruff’s journal. . .\n\nWithout actually intending to write a book, I began to research the lives of these men and women. My sole object was to find the greatness in the lives of these men and women and use them in teaching my own children . . . As time passed, I began to sense the value of the information I was finding. A desire grew within me to share what I had found. The lives of each of these men carried such powerful messages that I knew their stories must be told.\n\n. . . [my uncle Patriarch] gave me a blessing regarding this work. In the blessing he mentioned that these men and women had appeared to Wilford Woodruff and to others, and that this work would be written to edify and uplift. The blessing stated:\n\n“You will not look upon that which tears down, finds fault, criticizes. They [the eminent men and women] fulfilled their measure and calling upon the earth. For that reason they were permitted after their death to come to Wilford Woodruff so rapidly and have their temple work done. It is the Lord who judges from the intent of the heart, not from the popular opinion of the day. Nor should we judge by only a few facts. As you write and study the intent of the hearts of these men and women you will find that they were uniform. They came to Wilford Woodruff and reminded him that they lad the foundations of freedom . . .\n\nIt is this approach that must be taken in compiling this history, so that the children of men, the faithful, the righteous children of our Heavenly Father, may realize that they too have a premortal life, that they have a calling. They have an assignment and it is for them to study and follow the feelings and promptings of the spirit in righteousness. You will write about the good things, the fine things, their accomplishments.”\n\nThese instructions gave me a new perspective, a perspective that is perhaps different from that of others who have previously written these men’s stories. My duty was to seek out and record that which was good and noble in the lives of these men and women who so much desired the blessings of the gospel in their post-mortal lives.\n\n. . . We discovered in our years of historical research, that history written prior to 1920 was often written of great men and women who performed great deeds. After 1920, history has highlighted the miseries of men. As Brother Dean Belnap once stated: “Young people of our generation have been deprived of their birthright, which is to be conscious that they are the children of a high destiny in the line of great men who performed great deeds.” One cannot appreciate the future unless there is an understanding of the past. It is the intent of this book to illustrate from the lives of these eminent men, that one individual can make a difference. Hopefully this approach might give the reader the courage, determination, and hope needed to fulfill his or her own measure and calling upon this earth. We live in the greatest time history will ever be written. Therefore, we have the greatest measures and callings that have ever been given.\n\nIn writing this book I have received a great deal of help. Some of the research has come in truly miraculous ways. [The author then relates some of the miracles in her research–very fascinating stories.]\n\nThe lists of eminent men and women are not meant to imply that there were not other eminent people of the time nor that others were not great in the sight of the Lord. But those who appeared to President Woodruff helped lay the foundation for others in the spirit world to obtain their future blessings.\n\nLessons of God’s Superintending Care\n\nTo fulfill the purpose of His omniscient design, our Heavenly Father foreordained certain valiant spirit children and assigned them to come to earth at specific times and places to fulfill their appointments. The greatest of these spirits He reserved to come as prophets and priesthood leaders in His kingdom. “Every man,” said the Prophet Joseph Smith, “who has a calling to minister to the inhabitants of the world was ordained to that very purpose in the Grand Council of Heaven before this world was” .\n\nOther good and valiant spirits were foreappointed to lay the foundation for man’s liberty through their service in political matters. The Founding Fathers of this American nation were in this category. President Wilford Woodruff said, “They are the best spirits the God of Heaven could find on the face of the earth. They were choice spirits.” They were held in reserve to collectively come in the time and at the place when one of history’s greatest crises demanded their talents.\n\nThe foundation of the United States of America is spiritual. We must never forget this vital truth. This country was founded on a belief in the sovereignty of God, and He, not man, granted man his rights. This was possible because the Founding Fathers of this nation were God-fearing men disposed to deliberately acknowledge the hand of God in the events that brought about the nation’s independence.\n\nThe Lord raised up the founders of the United States, sanctioned their work, and designated them “wise men.” His approbation of their work is recorded in section 101 of the Doctrine and Covenants: “And for this purpose have I established the Constitution of this land, by the hands of wise men whom I raised up unto this very purpose, and redeemed the land by the shedding of blood” (D&C 101:80).\n\nThe restoration of the gospel and the establishment of the Lord’s Church could not come to pass until the Founding Fathers were raised up and completed their foreordained missions. Those great souls who were responsible for the freedoms we enjoy acknowledged the guiding hand of Providence. For their efforts we are indebted.\n\nResources\n\nScanned Images of Temple Work\n\nThe following are some of the temple records noting work done for the eminent spirits of Wilford Woodruff.\n\nReferences\n\nAnderson, Vicki Jo (1994), The Other Eminent Men of Wilford Woodruff, Cottonwood, AZ: Zichron, ISBN 0-9642524-0-6.\n\nProducts\n\nArtist renditions of this event\n\nMatthew David Grant\n\nwww.matthewdavidgrant.com\n\nHarold Hopkinson (father, artist of original rendition now found in the St. George Temple\n\nhttps://www.thechurchnews.com/archives/1989-02-18/painting-honors-founding-fathers-151928\n\nGlen Hopkinson (son, recently made his own version of this event)"
