Mary was the second wife of Augustine and helped him raise his eldest children.\n\n* Augustine first married Jane Butler (1694-1729), an orphan, in 1715. The couple had four children, only two lived to adulthood. Butler, an infant, died in 1716; Lawrence (1718-1752) renamed the family home 'Mount Vernon', Augustine II (1720-1762) was to inherit Mount Vernon - if he would give his own estate to George, and Jane (1722-1735) who died during an epileptic seizure.\n\n* Augustine Washington died from \"gout of the stomach\" on April 12, 1743, at approximately 49 years of age, in King George County, Virginia.\n\n* Mary Ball Washington may have died from breast cancer, but there is no proof. She was buried, as she desired, on the Fielding Lewis plantation, near \"meditation rock\" that was close to the Lewis Fielding home. Tradition has it that this was her favorite retreat for reading, prayer, and meditation. Her mother's maiden name and family are unknown at this time.\n\n* AUGUSTINE was married previously to Jane BUTLER (1699-1728), an orphan, and had four children:\n\nButler Washington (1716-????)\n\nLawrence Washington (17181752)\n\nAugustine Washington II (17201762)\n\nJane Washington (17221735)\n\n* Nothing is known of MARY Ball's mother except that she was the widow Mary JOHNSON.\n\n* SAMUEL married 5 times\n\nJane CHAMPE (1724-1755)\n\nMildred THORNTON (about 1741-1763)\n\nLucy CHAPMAN (1743-1762)\n\nAnne STEPTOE (17371777)\n\nSusannah PERRIN (1740-1783)\n\n* JOHN and Hannah Washington's son Corbin married Hannah LEE, of the Stratford Hall Lees. Her nephew Henry \"Lighthorse Harry\" Lee III was the father of Robert E. Lee.\n\n* MILDRED was about 16 months old when she died.\n\n**The two Mildred Thorntons were cousins, not the same person.\n\n* [All information was taken from various articles at Wikipedia and several family sites.]"
