        "text": "So I'm totally jumping on the George Washington bandwagon but who cares! This may not be my best work but here's The American Cincinnatus as he lived in Hail, Britannia:\n\n----\n\nGeorge Washington, 1st Marquess of Mount Vernon was a British American soldier and statesman, who was a major figure in the American colonial unrest of the late eighteenth century. Born at his parents' estate in Westmoreland County, Colonial Virginia on 22 February 1732 (Gregorian calendar), Washington was of primarily English gentry descent, and the Washington family were moderately prosperous members of the Virginia gentry.\n\nSpending parts of his early life as a surveyor in western Virginia, Washington is more well known for his military service, which began 1752 when he was commissioned as a Major in the Virginia colonial militia. Washington was involved in some of the early engagements of the French and Indian War, particularly in the sparsely settled Ohio Country. In 1755 Washington was the senior American-born aide to General Edward Braddock on the ill-fated expedition. Although the expedition was an unmitigated disaster, with Braddock's forces suffering devastating casualties, Washington was credited with demonstrating much braery and stamina. It was during this mission that he first met and befriended Daniel Taylor of New York, a friendship that would prove crucial in the coming decades.\n\nWashington served with distinction in the colonial militia before retiring in 1758. In 1759 he marred the wealthy widow Martha Dandridge Cutis, and together raised her two children from her previous marriage; John Parke Custis (later 1st Viscount Abingdon) and Martha Parke Custis, who would marry George Taylor, 2nd Marquess of Valcour, the eldest son of Washington's close friend Daniel Taylor. The couple never had any children together. After their marriage, the pair settled in Mount Vernon near Alexandria.\n\nWashington became involved in politics in 1758, when he was first elected to the Virignia House of Burgesses, and he served in the colonial legislature until 1765. He later became involved in the growing colonial unrest when he opposed the 1765 Stamp Act and the 1767 Townshend Acts, which he regarded as unlawful given the lack of colonial representation in the British Parliament. Washington regarded the passage of the Intolerable Acts in 1774 as \"an Invasion of our Rights and Privileges\", and in late 1774 he was sent by Virgina as a delegate to the Philadelphia Congress. Washington found the Congress to be split between loyalists and patriots, and it was here that Daniel Taylor used his longstanding friendship with Washington to persuade him to support reconciliation. With Washington's support for the loyalists many other delegates shifted to reconciliation, and he was one of the key individuals behind the Petition to the King. Washington, alongside Benjamin Franklin and Daniel Taylor, accompanied the Petition to London to be presented to King George III, an event commemorated by the painting entitled \"The King and The Three Loyal Americans\".\n\nFor services to the Crown, Washington was granted one of the first American peerages to be created in 1776 as the Marquess of Mount Vernon, and the title remains the Premier Marquess of America as well as retaining an hereditary seat in both the Imperial Council and the Virginia House of Lords. Washington served in the American Colonial Congress as a delegate from Virginia between 1776 and 1785, when he was appointed the 2nd President General (the monarch's viceregal representative), a position he held until his resignation in 1796. In 1785 Washington was also elected as one of the first American Representative Peers, a position he held until his death in 1799 at his plantation home.\n\nA special request by Washington meant that upon his death his titles passed to his closest male relative, in this case his great-nephew John Thornton Augustine Washington. Washington is remembered as an important United Empire Loyalist and one of the Fathers of Imperial Federation, and is regularly ranked as one of the greatest British Americans in history (along with Benjamin Franklin and Daniel Taylor).\n\nThe Washington family is a British American political and land-owning family of English and Virginian descent, considered one of the preeminent aristocratic families of Britain-in-America. Descended from Augustine Washington (1694-1763), the most prominent member of the family was George Washington (1732-1799), 1st Marquess of Mount Vernon, who helped prevent the British North American colonies from breaking away from the Empire. In Virginia the family continues to be held in high esteem by the people, and are sometimes described as \"Virginia's First Family\" or \"the unofficial Virginian royal family\", and many members have held prominent roles in government in both Virginia, where several Washingtons have served as Viceroy, and the wider United Kingdom.\n\nJeremy 'Fucking' Corbyn had become Prime Minister of the UK against all odds, and against the wishes of over 75% of the British people. But he was by no means home and dry, as he found when he attempted to form a Cabinet (most of his Shadow Cabinet having resigned on election night, and some of the rest being unwilling to serve a Jeremy with actual power). It wasn't long before he had been rejected by most Labour MPs, and although hard-left Momentum activists had won seats thanks to controversial deselections and the accidental landslide, there weren't nearly enough to fill a Front Bench. On the Sunday, Corbyn was forced to go outside the PLP and name Jon Lansman, the new Mayor of London (who had made a name for himself by removing Santander sponsorship on the 'Boris bikes' and replacing it with harrowing images of the First Intifada) as Secretary of State for Infrastructure.\n\nSo Corbyn, despite his historic majority, was impelled by lack of support from his own Party to form a Coalition. And so the last great chance for a Labour Government was fluffed. Margaret Ritchie of the SDLP was made Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and members of the SNP were given the Scotland, Health and International Development briefs. Finally, on 13 May, running very short of options, Corbyn offered the Home Office (which had been refused by 33 very sensible people up to that point) to Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein. This caused a bit of a kerfuffle, so two days later a young aide plucked up the courage to ask the Prime Minister whether he was aware that: A) Mr Adams was not in fact a Member of Parliament, of B) That due to the policy of abstentionism, Mr Adams could hardly be expected to turn up for Home Secretary's Questions. Five hours later, Adams was out, with no appreciable hard feelings. But who was to be Home Secretary?\n\nThe answer was Douglas Carswell, a former Tory MP who had defected to the Radical Party over the EU issue and what he felt to be insufficient Liberalism in the Conservative and Lib Dem parties. Traditionally, the Radicals are seen as erring towards the centre-right, but their focus on personal freedom, taxing large estates and Disestablishing the Church of England appealed to Jeremy Corbyn. Carswell, just happy to be noticed at this point, after the Radicals had lost two thirds of their seats and half of their purpose with the whole Brexit thing, accepted and moved into Marsham Street. In truth, very little was actually done by this Government due to incessant backbench rebellions, but Carswell did manage to push through the legalisation of cannabis with cross-party support over the summer.\n\nIt was, of course, not a situation that could last any longer than a few months. In July, Labour Party grandee Hilary Benn managed to corrall the swaying hordes of Labour MPs dithering about whether to try couping Corbyn for the third time in four years. He got the nominations, attended the hustings (unaccompanied by Corbyn, who was usually \"busy with the business of Government\" and on one occasion 'missed' a train) and, when the result of the poll of Party members was announced at Annual Conference at the end of September 2020, lost by 1.4%. Labour had chosen Corbyn once again - he was that most remarkable of men: an 'unelectable' Leader who won more elections than Blair but failed to gain the support of his Party or the nation.\n\nHe retreated to 10 Downing Street and received a stream of resignations (in truth, there hadn't been a period since May when this wasn't the case - Angus Robertson had resigned as Deputy Prime Minister in June citing Corbyn's \"impossibility\" and been replaced with an increasingly bemused Douglas Carswell). By the beginning of October, nobody apart from Chancellor McDonnell and 'Lord High Everything Else' Richard Burgon was actually doing their jobs - something of a surprise, actually, since Burgon hadn't ever been known for his work ethic - and the media Siege of Downing Street began. This was no mere hype: bricks were thrown at windows outside the PM's residence by journalists who were so impatient for competent governance or, failing that, a sodding story to cover. Finally, on 2 October, Hilary Benn pulled a leaf out of Theresa May's book and called an impromptu meeting of sympathetic Labour MPs. Within half an hour, 256 of them had defected to a new 'Moderate Party' which had been hastily registered with the Electoral Commission, and Benn went to the Palace. Corbyn only had the support of 53 MPs within Labour, and the Queen's only option was to name Benn PM. He went into Downing Street with an armed guard from G4S, 'evicted' Corbyn, and set about forming a new, Moderate, Government.\n\nThe dangerous Corbynite experiment had not been an unqualified success.\n\nThe Radverse\n\nThe Radical Party\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg\n\nOpen Left Mayoral Selection, 2019\n\n2020 General Election"
