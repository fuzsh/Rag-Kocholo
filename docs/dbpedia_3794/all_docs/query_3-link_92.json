        "text": "To figure out the Founding Fathers’ British influences, we must verify their birthplaces, associations, and loyalties. The Founders needed 100% allegiance to America-not the British Crown. This would be the first crucial step to achieving liberty and independence for the future United States.\n\n17 of 152 Founding Fathers had British influence. This is where they were born: 4-Scotland, 4-England, 8-Ireland, and 1-Wales. Alexander Hamilton was another Founder born outside the 13 original colonies in Charlestown, Saint Kitts and Nevis.\n\nNow, that you know the birth statistics of the Founding Fathers, let’s see how their British influences affected the American Revolution. Birthplace is important. But, were they loyal to their homeland?\n\nAncestry of the Founders\n\nAnswering your question about the Founding Fathers requires us to explore their ancestry in greater detail.\n\nOrigin of the Statistics\n\nMy research to answer this query required that I find a list of the Founding Fathers. A definitive list became hard to find. I scoured the internet, but I acquired a list of the founders here.\n\nThen, I had to figure out how I classified these historic figures. I asked myself a series of questions.\n\nWhat documents did they sign against the British?\n\nWhat historical significance did these individuals stand for?\n\nDid the Founders with British influence have a passion for liberty?\n\nAfter much thought, I settled on a few basic premises.\n\nFounding Fathers did not let their backgrounds deter them from their goal of independence.\n\nFounding Fathers had to sign a document proclaiming liberty from the British.\n\nIn other words, they had to show independence mindset from the British Crown- whether that was before or after the American Revolution. I didn’t want them displaying allegiance to Great Britain even if they had relatives from there.\n\nThese are the documents that the Founding Fathers had to sign:\n\nArticles of Association (1774)\n\nDeclaration of Independence (1776)\n\nArticles of Confederation (1777)\n\nThe Constitution (1787)\n\nAfter making those conclusions, I did my research on the origins of each founder to prove my statistics.\n\nMy results for each founder are in the graph below:\n\nBirthplace of America’s by J liberty\n\nDid the Famous Founders Have British Influence?\n\nGrowing up as 2nd or 3rd generation American boys, the Founders saw the British influence represented in daily American culture. They knew America’s struggles, aspirations, and dreams. Would they let that influence their decisions?\n\nIn American history class, you are going to hear these famous names:\n\nGeorge Washington\n\nJohn Adams\n\nThomas Jefferson\n\nJames Madison\n\nBenjamin Franklin\n\nAlexander Hamilton\n\nThese founders had the most power and influence. Their future decisions would affect generations of unborn Americans.\n\nTheir origins are listed below:\n\nHis dad- Augustine Washington- attended school in England\n\nPuritan background\n\nMost Puritans came over in the 16th and 17th centuries as English Protestants\n\nFamily Origins in Wales\n\nEarliest Madison family predecessor-Captain Isaac Madison born in London, England 1590\n\nBenjamin Franklin\n\nJosiah Franklin (Ben Franklin’s father)- born directly in England\n\nBen Franklin spent a great deal of time as a diplomat in London\n\nAlexander Hamilton\n\nJames Hamilton (Alexander Hamilton’s father)- a Scottish tradesman\n\nAs seen above, the Founding Fathers had immediate family ties to British influence. These ties played crucial roles in the fight for independence.\n\nWhere Were the Founders’ Loyalties? Britain or America?\n\nIf America were to gain independence from the British, loyalty and unity became the primary virtues.\n\nMany of you proudly fly the American flag outside of your home. My grandfather- a Marine- always flew the American flag. I couldn’t imagine him flying a British flag or any other country’s flag outside his house. Growing up, I never questioned his loyalty to America and the values that America represented.\n\nMuch like my grandfather, the Founding Fathers’ loyalty never wavered. They may have had British roots. But, with loyalty and sacrifice to liberty, no other country’s flag mattered except the American flag.\n\nSpecifically, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin spent considerable time abroad in Great Britain. They learned British customs and traditions but kept American values closer.\n\nBenjamin Franklin-the most experienced U.S. ambassador- educated John Adams and Thomas Jefferson on British customs.\n\nFranklin saw the pros and cons of the British system. He became an advocate for instituting the positive changes made after years of struggle. The British fought a multitude of civil wars with workers wanting better representation, rights, and cheaper taxes.\n\nAdams and Franklin knew fair representation and basic human dignity belonged in the new American government.\n\nThere was no way they wanted to bring a monarchy system back to America. John Adams despised the absolute rule of the British monarchy.\n\nFurthermore, Thomas Paine receives- the honorary American award- even though he did not sign any of the founding documents.\n\nHis British roots persuaded the Americans to make a clean break. Thus, Common Sense became the sole document to rally Americans to independence.\n\nAs you have seen, the core Founders believed in America. They wanted liberty from the British Crown. While there were famous traitors during the American Revolution, like Benedict Arnold, those were isolated incidents.\n\nConclusion\n\nOne of the most common questions asked when you meet someone is: “Where are you from?” I know you wondered the same about the American Founding Fathers.\n\nYes, the Founding Fathers had British ancestry and a select few were from the present-day United Kingdom. Some had influence from parents or grandparents directly from Britain.\n\nMany of the Founding Fathers traveled abroad to experience and explore British culture. Famous Founders as John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin discussed their knowledge of British culture to inspire Americans about the need for British separation.\n\nTheir loyalty to liberty never wavered. Britain didn’t mean as much to them since their loyalties belonged to their American families and friends.\n\nWhich Founding Father is most interesting to you?\n\nJ. Liberty"
