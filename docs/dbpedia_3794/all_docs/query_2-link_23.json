And in truth not having enquired much into the names or connection of the lateral Branches of the family I am unable to give a Satisfactory account of them. But if it be in any degree necessary, or satisfactory to Sir Isaac Heard Garter Principal King of Arms, I will upon intimation thereof, set on foot an enquiryâand will at the sametime endeavor to be more particular with respect to the births, names, ages and burials of those of the branch to which the Subscriber belongs."
