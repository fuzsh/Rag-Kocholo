        "text": "Theoretically I should hate this with every fiber of my curdmugeonly being. An over-the-hill John Wayne is in charge of a dozen prepubescent boys on a cattle drive. It sounds like the worst kind of crowd-pandering, cutesy pie filmmaking imaginable.\n\nBut damn it, if the thing didn't hook me. Sure it's adorable seeing pint-size cowboys trying their hand at roping and steering but the kids play it right, striving to be recognized as men while still retaining a healthy degree of youthful hubris and stupidity. There's not a cloying note in the bunch.\n\nAnd John Ford was right, that son of a bitch Wayne can act. For the most part he plays it crotchety with the kids but he gets…\n\nWhy I watched this one? One of the few John Wayne movies that I had not seen. Not counting his many B westerns of the 1930s I have now seen 57 of his movies.\n\nWhat is this one about? John Wayne needs to move his cattle 400 miles so he can sell them. All of his regular cowboys leave town when a gold rush occurs in a close town. This forces Wayne to hire a bunch of schoolboys to move the cattle. Bruce Dern plays the bad guy in the villain....a guy named Long Hair.\n\nWhat I thought about this movie? Probably the best Wayne movie of the 1970s (with The Shootist). This one actually has an overture, an intermission…\n\nMark Rydell's The Cowboys was one of the last really good Westerns that John Wayne made before he died. Of course The Shootist will be remembered as Wayne's final screen performance, and it was a fitting end to a remarkable career, but between 1972 and 1976, or between The Cowboys and The Shootist, Wayne made three other Westerns which didn't warrant his star wattage. Cahill US Marshal was bland and uninspiring, The Train Robbers was unfocused, and Rooster Cogburn, despite Wayne having Katharine Hepburn as a co-star, lacked the \"grit\" of the original film. The Cowboys however had Wayne starring alongside a group of 11 child actors, an experience that Wayne himself described as one of the best of his…\n\n1972 In Review - January\n\n#5\n\nA grizzled veteran rancher, Wil Andersen (John Wayne) is almost ready to embark on a big cattle drive when his crew abruptly quits to join in a gold rush. Left with no alternative, Anderson enlists the help of a group of local schoolboys. Training the youngsters to be cowboys, Andersen manages to get the drive underway, but their long journey is placed in jeopardy when the devious bandit Long Hair (Bruce Dern) sets his sights on stealing the herd.\n\nThe Cowboys feels more like a film from the 50’s or the 60’s. With John Wayne here at his best. He brings such a charismatic magic to these kinds of film, that I can never…\n\n\"I'm proud of ya... All of ya. Every man wants his children to be better'n he was. You are.\" - Wil Anderson\n\nWow, just wow. I did not expect this one to hit as hard as it did. This was a fun, lighthearted and damn enjoyable adventure until it really wasn’t. I don’t want to give anything away but there is a significant tonal shift happening here and I did not see it coming. All I can say is that I loved it and think that the movie is better for it. It’s really nice to find out that movies can still surprise me. Especially one that is half a century old at this point.\n\nOther than that I think…\n\n\"The Cowboys\" seems to fit that staple of a John Wayne western where he's the weathered old man who rookie youngsters just entering into manhood look up to as a role model. In this case it's boys from the schoolhouse that show up at Wayne's ranch to drive his herd of cattle to market after the regular \"cattle men\" had abandoned the Duke at the moment when he most needed them to go look for gold. This is one cool setup actually that turns out to be full of surprises. It borrows from a lot of Wayne's films but mostly \"Red River\". However \"The Cowboys\" has its own story to tell even as it constantly reminds you of other westerns…\n\nIn the list of John Wayne Westerns, The Cowboys feels like a real deviation from the bunch and is maybe one of the ones that I like more because of the type of film and tone it goes for. Part of this is because it's not an action film at all (until the last half hour) but instead a coming-of-age adventure that sees The Duke taking on a mentor role and most of the movie being a slow, methodical drama. In this, it's oddly tender and has a good deal of heart to it as we see Wayne and his charges embarking on a cattle drive with a story that shows a gentler side to its lead in a very…\n\nI reckon the reason I much prefer John Wayne's later or, in the case of The Cowboys, late westerns is because there's a reflection and self-criticism in them that was largely absent in the earlier parts of his career.\n\nMark Rydell's film is actually far more contemplative than I was expected, and I also wasn't expecting there to be such a brooding cloud to hang over it. Having read the synopsis of this, I thought it was going to be a fairly comedic affair with Wayne getting the hump with a bunch of nauseating adolescents who think they're cowboys, only to gain a grudging respect for them at the end.\n\nIt's really not like that at all, and I'm actually…\n\n☆\"Nothin' but cowboys, just like the word says, and I'm gonna remind ya of it every single night.\"☆\n\nMarch to the West 2023 – Film #14 of 31\n\nI have a couple films lined up that explore the final decade of John Wayne's career, and though there are some poor films among those 1970s pieces if they're anything like the wonderful The Shootist then I'm all in. The Cowboys certainly isn't at that level but it's a fine watch, because one can begin to see his personal self-reflection after a career lasting a half-century. Admittedly melodramatic, it's hard not to be charmed by Mark Rydell's 1972 Western anyway. Oh, why don't you just stay for the film score, composed by…"
