        "text": "AS a successful Broadway play, Ernest Thompson's ''On Golden Pond'' was processed American cheese, smooth, infinitely spreadable and bland, with color added by the actors. The screen version, directed by Mark Rydell from Mr. Thompson's screenplay, is not much different in any superficial way.\n\nIt's still the upbeat, learning-to-love-you lesson about one summer in the lives of Norman Thayer Jr., a retired, crotchety university professor; Ethel Thayer, his bright, spunky wife of nearly 50 years, and their only daughter, Chelsea, whom Norman has never forgiven for not being a boy. You don't have to have seen the play to guess what happens to Norman's gentle misanthropy, especially to his feelings toward Chelsea, after he and Ethel spend a month taking care of the foul-mouthed, lonely, misunderstood teen-age son of Chelsea's fiance, a dentist named Bill Ray. Life can be beautiful, if full of tears.\n\nThe movie, which opens today at the Cinema 1, is still American cheese, but its stars - Henry Fonda, Katharine Hepburn, Jane Fonda and Dabney Coleman - add more than color to this pasteurized product. ''On Golden Pond'' now has the bite of a good old cheddar.\n\nAs Norman Thayer Jr., celebrating his 80th birthday with reluctance, furiously aware of his physical and mental decline and as frightened of death as he is angry with it, Mr. Fonda gives one of the great performances of his long, truly distinguished career. Here is film acting of the highest order, the kind that is not discovered overnight in the laboratory, but seems to be the distillation of hundreds of performances.\n\nAs you watch him in ''On Golden Pond,'' you're seeing the intelligence, force and grace of a talent that has been maturing on the screen for almost 50 years, in everything from ''You Only Live Once,'' ''Jesse James,'' ''The Grapes of Wrath,'' ''The Lady Eve'' and ''My Darling Clementine,'' through ''Mr. Roberts,'' ''Twelve Angry Men'' and all of those more recent films in which he has given class to junk simply by his presence in a cameo role.\n\nIn ''On Golden Pond,'' Mr. Fonda is very funny, nonchalant and tough in ways that deny the essential gooiness of the material, and of Mr. Rydell's direction, which, when in doubt, cuts to lyrical shots of the sun-dappled waters of Golden Pond, of loons paddling along together in blissful harmony and of lily petals glistening with dew. One more drop of dew and this movie would have drowned.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
