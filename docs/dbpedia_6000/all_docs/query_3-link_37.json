        "text": "To paraphrase an old song, how're you going to lure them back to the box office after they've seen gremlins, ghostbusters and gyrating rock stars? By keeping them down on the farm.\n\nIf there is a single fresh pattern woven into the season of motion pictures about to begin, it is Hollywood's newfound affection for the drama and sturdy virtues of farmfolk, especially the women. In the weeks and months to come, no less than three major productions - each set on a farm, each with a major female star - will be released; and one of them, ''Country,'' starring Jessica Lange and Sam Shepard, has been accorded the honor of opening this year's New York Film Festival on Sept. 28.\n\nAs always, the advent of autumn brings with it a renewed sense of excitement and competition, peaking toward Christmas, when studios release cherished productions in hopes that fresh memories will yield a bountiful harvest when the Academy Awards are bestowed come spring. Coupled with the excitement is uncertainty. Which highly touted new films will fall flat? What unexpected hit will usher in a new cycle of imitations? What hot director will construct a self-indulgent dud? What stars will suddenly lose their grip on audiences? What success will breed a multimillion-dollar cornucopia of byproducts: best-selling records, popular books, a television series, toys and T-shirts?\n\nNo crystal ball reveals the answer to such questions, only the unfolding of the season itself. The motion picture industry is far from a fabulous invalid, but it is a high stakes game, and the expensive risks of failure and the awesome rewards of success lend an undercurrent of drama to a contemplation of the schedule.\n\nWhile the forthcoming farm movies constitute a relative novelty, the season ahead is characterized by a generous admixture of the familiar with the new: new offerings by well-regarded directors, new vehicles for famous stars; screen versions of established properties from the theater, opera, and fiction from classics to comics; the continuation of trends, such as the affinity for extraterrestrials and the affection for sequels; and new examples of popular genres - spy stories, science-fiction, comedy and romance. And, to round out the scene, an assortment of festivals will celebrate various aspects of the medium.\n\nAmong the farm movies, there is not only ''Country,'' which finds Miss Lange and Mr. Shepard in a drama about the travails of modern life on a Middle Western farm, there are also ''Places in the Heart,'' starring Sally Field, Ed Harris and John Malkovich, and ''The River,'' with Sissy Spacek, Mel Gibson and Scott Glenn. In ''Places in the Heart,'' directed by Robert Benton (''Kramer vs. Kramer'') and drawn from his recollections of Texas boyhood during the Depression, a widowed mother battles to save her farm from foreclosure. As in ''Country,'' too, the struggle to preserve a way of life engages the family in ''The River,'' directed by Mark Rydell (''On Golden Pond'').\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
