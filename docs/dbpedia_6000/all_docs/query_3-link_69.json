        "text": "From “On Golden Pond” to “12 Angry Men,” Stacker compiled a list of the 50 best Henry Fonda movies, using data from IMDb. - Twentieth Century Fox\n\nMadison Troyer\n\nWhen Henry Fonda died in 1982, The New York Times called him “one of the most celebrated and enduring American performers,” an epitaph the actor more than deserved.\n\nBorn in Nebraska in 1905, Fonda began acting at the age of 20, but his big breakthrough didn’t come until 1934 when he won a role in the Broadway show “The Farmer Takes a Wife.” Over the next five decades, he would appear in more than 100 roles on stage and in films. Some of his more memorable performances were in movies like “12 Angry Men,” “The Grapes of Wrath,” and “The Ox-Bow Incident,” though he appeared in projects of all genres, from Westerns to comedies to psychological thrillers, crime dramas, and war movies.\n\nHere, Stacker has compiled a list of Fonda’s 50 best movies. To do so, we tallied all of his feature films and ranked the top 50 by IMDb user rating, with ties broken by votes. Cameos were not included. From lesser-known projects like “The Mad Miss Manton” to Academy Award winners like “On Golden Pond,” read on to see where your favorite projects with Fonda fall on our list.\n\nYou may also like: Worst movies from the last decade, according to critics\n\nWalter Wanger Productions\n\n#50. The Moon’s Our Home (1936)\n\n– Director: William A. Seiter\n\n– IMDb user rating: 6.6\n\n– Metascore: data not available\n\n– Runtime: 80 minutes\n\nIn “The Moon’s Our Home,” Anthony Amberton (Fonda) and Cherry Chester (Margaret Sullavan) meet by chance in New York City and get married on a whim. However, their marriage starts to fall apart during their honeymoon when they both discover the other is famous. The film is based on the 1936 Faith Baldwin novel of the same name.\n\nTwentieth Century Fox\n\n#49. Rings on Her Fingers (1942)\n\n– Director: Rouben Mamoulian\n\n– IMDb user rating: 6.6\n\n– Metascore: data not available\n\n– Runtime: 86 minutes\n\nVariety called “Rings on Her Fingers,” a movie about a family of swindlers that mistake Fonda’s character for a wealthy businessman and ideal target, “a vacuous story that gets no assistance on the directing end … a lightweight film that tumbles and stumbles along in boresome fashion to emerge as misfit entertainment.” The outlet’s negative stance on the lighthearted rom-com may have had something to do with how racy it was; the Production Code Administration insisted at least half a dozen elements be changed before the movie earned its stamp of approval.\n\nTwentieth Century Fox\n\n#48. Immortal Sergeant (1943)\n\n– Director: John M. Stahl\n\n– IMDb user rating: 6.6\n\n– Metascore: data not available\n\n– Runtime: 91 minutes\n\nJust before production began on “Immortal Sergeant,” Fonda enrolled in the Navy, making it the last film he’d work on until the end of World War II. Set in the North African desert during the war, the movie follows a soldier (Fonda) as he reminisces on the girl he left behind and worries over his lack of leadership abilities.\n\nUnited Archives // Getty Images\n\n#47. The Male Animal (1942)\n\n– Director: Elliott Nugent\n\n– IMDb user rating: 6.6\n\n– Metascore: data not available\n\n– Runtime: 101 minutes\n\nIn “The Male Animal,” Fonda plays a college professor fighting against censorship and for the affection of his wife, who’s being wooed by a football player. The New York Times raved about the “charming” film, specifically praising the way it played with the “brains over brawn” trope.\n\nThe Return of Frank James (1940)\n\n#46. The Return of Frank James (1940)\n\n– Director: Fritz Lang\n\n– IMDb user rating: 6.6\n\n– Metascore: data not available\n\n– Runtime: 92 minutes\n\nThe sequel to “Jesse James,” “The Return of Frank James” follows Frank (Fonda) as he attempts to avenge his cowboy brother’s death. The movie is regarded as wildly historically inaccurate, despite the fact that 20th Century Fox had purchased the rights to both brothers’ lives.\n\nYou may also like: 50 best space movies of all time\n\nParamount Pictures\n\n#45. Spawn of the North (1938)\n\n– Director: Henry Hathaway\n\n– IMDb user rating: 6.7\n\n– Metascore: data not available\n\n– Runtime: 110 minutes\n\nOne of the most commercially successful films of Fonda’s early career, “Spawn of the North” is an adventure film about two Alaskan fishermen who go from friends to rivals. Its special effects, which won an Academy Award, helped draw in huge audiences, as did its star-studded cast, which included the likes of George Raft, John Barrymore, and Akim Tamiroff.\n\nVintage Images // Getty Images\n\n#44. Let Us Live (1939)\n\n– Director: John Brahm\n\n– IMDb user rating: 6.7\n\n– Metascore: data not available\n\n– Runtime: 68 minutes\n\n“Let Us Live,” a story about two men convicted and sentenced to death for a crime they didn’t commit, is reportedly based on a real-life case that took place in Massachusetts. According to IMDb, the state was unhappy with the way the movie portrayed its legal system and pressured the studio into trimming down the script, budget, publicity, and runtime, considerably.\n\nRKO Radio Pictures\n\n#43. The Mad Miss Manton (1938)\n\n– Director: Leigh Jason\n\n– IMDb user rating: 6.7\n\n– Metascore: data not available\n\n– Runtime: 80 minutes\n\nIn this screwball comedy, a young socialite gets wrapped up in a murder investigation after the body she found mysteriously disappears. Barbara Stanwyck stars as the daffy upper-cruster alongside Fonda, who plays newspaper editor and assistant investigator Peter Ames. Katharine Hepburn reportedly was offered but turned down the lead role of Melsa Manton.\n\nABC Pictures\n\n#42. Too Late the Hero (1970)\n\n– Director: Robert Aldrich\n\n– IMDb user rating: 6.7\n\n– Metascore: data not available\n\n– Runtime: 145 minutes\n\nFonda has only a minor role in this 1970 war film.

Along with Roberston, Michael Caine, Ian Bannen, and Harry Andrews also star.\n\nPonti-De Laurentiis Cinematografica\n\n#41. War and Peace (1956)\n\n– Director: King Vidor\n\n– IMDb user rating: 6.7\n\n– Metascore: data not available\n\n– Runtime: 208 minutes\n\nIn this extremely truncated version of Leo Tolstoy’s famous novel, a 50-year-old Fonda plays the 20-year-old character Pierre alongside Audrey Hepburn’s Natasha and Mel Ferrer’s Andrei. The critically acclaimed movie was nominated for several Academy Awards and Golden Globes and reportedly cost between $6–7 million to make, an exorbitant sum for film production at that time.\n\nYou may also like: Mistakes from the 50 best movies of all time\n\nMichael Ochs Archives // Getty Images\n\n#40.

Starring Fonda alongside Charlton Heston, Glenn Ford, and Robert Mitchum, the movie repurposed many of its battle scenes from previous movies like “Away All Boats,” “30 Seconds Over Tokyo,” and “Tora! Tora! Tora!”\n\nTwentieth Century Fox\n\n#39. The Magnificent Dope (1942)\n\n– Director: Walter Lang\n\n– IMDb user rating: 6.8\n\n– Metascore: data not available\n\n– Runtime: 83 minutes\n\nWhen a contest run by a self-improvement course identifies Thad Page (Fonda) as the “biggest loser in the country,” the laid-back northerner reluctantly heads to New York to claim his prize. There, he falls in love with a woman named Claire (Lynn Bari) and considers abandoning his lazy lifestyle in an effort to win her heart. One of the film’s working titles during production was “The Magnificent Jerk,” but it was changed after the Hays Office (a common nom de plume for the Production Code Administration) objected.\n\nJohn Springer Collection // Getty Images\n\n#38. The Trail of the Lonesome Pine (1936)\n\n– Director: Henry Hathaway\n\n– IMDb user rating: 6.8\n\n– Metascore: data not available\n\n– Runtime: 102 minutes\n\nBased on the novel of the same name by John Fox Jr., “The Trail of the Lonesome Pine” was one of Fonda’s earliest films. A sort of Romeo and Juliet story set in the wild West, the movie was the first Technicolor film to be shot on location.\n\nTwentieth Century Fox\n\n#37. Daisy Kenyon (1947)\n\n– Director: Otto Preminger\n\n– IMDb user rating: 6.8\n\n– Metascore: data not available\n\n– Runtime: 99 minutes\n\nAnother film based on a novel, “Daisy Kenyon” brought the bestselling story of a woman trapped between her married lover and a charming war veteran to the big screen. Joan Crawford stars as the eponymous Daisy, with Fonda playing the WWII vet Peter Lapham, and Dana Andrews the married commercial executive.\n\nWarner Bros./Seven Arts\n\n#36. Firecreek (1968)\n\n– Director: Vincent McEveety\n\n– IMDb user rating: 6.8\n\n– Metascore: 65\n\n– Runtime: 104 minutes\n\n“Firecreek” marks a rare occurrence of Fonda playing the antagonist in a movie.
