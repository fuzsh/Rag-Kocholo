(In wide release.)\n\nTHE WENDELL BAKER STORY\n\nReviewed this week in The Current Cinema. Opening May 18. (In wide release.)\n\nNOW PLAYING\n\nAWAY FROM HER\n\nJulie Christie is sixty-six, but her face hasn’t lost its beautiful definition—the downward-turning mouth, the slightly pointed chin, the eyes that can explode with wrath. Her temperament hasn’t fallen out of shape, either. As Fiona, an Ontario woman succumbing to Alzheimer’s, she seems quite lost one second but then, as an intention pierces through a cloud of unhappiness, becomes crisp and incisive. Christie, turning a medical condition into a dramatic coup, makes it impossible for us merely to feel sorry for Fiona, and that toughness gives the film the abrupt, challenging intelligence of a fresh and exploratory work rather than the soft piteousness of, say, a “Movie of the Week” from 1973. With Gordon Pinsent, the veteran Canadian actor, who has a capacious gut, a fine beard, and the burnished aspect of an aging lion, as Grant, Fiona’s longtime husband; Michael Murphy as the stricken man whom Fiona falls in love with at an assisted-living facility; and Olympia Dukakis as the practical old broad who gives Grant a way to remain loyal yet survive as a man. The young Canadian actress Sarah Polley adapted the Alice Munro story “The Bear Came Over the Mountain” and also directed the movie, with attention to the human mysteries and a feeling for the spiritual meaning of landscape. In all, a minor triumph.—David Denby (Reviewed in our issue of 5/14/07.) (In wide release.)\n\nDAY NIGHT DAY NIGHT\n\nJulia Loktev wrote and directed this ambitious drama, which follows a nameless terrorist recruit (Luisa Williams) as she prepares to carry out a suicide bombing in Times Square. Loktev pays close attention to personal detail, using a claustrophobic camera style and slow, real-time pacing. The plotter is portrayed as a lost soul hoping for the approval and succor of a God she’s not quite sure exists. With no ethnicity or affiliation specified for the woman (she’s clearly American, with dark features), the story lacks context, leaving one with a sense that the filmmaker has little more to say than that terrorists are people, too. But not mentioning the political motives of those who want to give their lives to take the lives of others makes an incomplete picture, to potentially detrimental effect.—Shauna Lyon (IFC Center.)\n\nDISTURBIA\n\nJudged as an adolescent, suburban version of Hitchcock’s extraordinarily sophisticated 1954 urban thriller “Rear Window,” this movie, written by Christopher B. Landon and Carl Ellsworth and directed by D. J. Caruso, can rightly be called a travesty. The dopiness of it, however, may be an indication not so much of cinematic ineptitude as of the changes in a movie culture that was once devoted to adults and is now rather haplessly and redundantly devoted to kids. Shia LaBeouf, Sarah Roemer, and Aaron Yoo, aided by enough electronic equipment to open a Circuit City, spy on a suspected murderer (David Morse) living across the street. When he gets wise to them, the picture turns into a conventional (and at times effectively scary) horror movie, with splattered blood and corpses floating in some sort of basement vat.—D.D. (In wide release.)\n\nEVEN MONEY\n\nThe director Mark Rydell (“The Rose,” “On Golden Pond”) suffuses this hard-nosed anti-gambling drama with the grim knowledge that, in the end, the house always wins. The script, by Robert Tannen, links the fortunes of ten characters in a round of doomed compulsion: an English professor (Ray Liotta) whose novelist wife (Kim Basinger) abandons work and home for the casino; the washed-up magician (Danny DeVito) she meets there; an indebted sports bettor (Forest Whitaker) who wants his younger brother, a college basketball star (Nick Cannon), to shave points; two small-time bookies, one of whom (Jay Mohr) loves the action and the other of whom (Grant Sullivan) loves a nurse (Carla Gugino) who wants him to quit; a suave, sadistic mobster (Tim Roth); and the war-wounded detective (Kelsey Grammer) who collects the bodies as they fall. Rydell’s blunt moralism and almost campy sincerity seem a throwback to distant decades. He elicits amazingly vivid and concise performances (especially from DeVito and Whitaker), and, without rummaging through backstories, simply shows the lure of the payoff to be irresistible to certain unfortunate souls. Despite huge gaps in the plot and some implausible staging of scenes, the old-school storytelling exudes a primal force.—Richard Brody (Empire 25 and 19th Street East 6.)\n\nHOT FUZZ\n\nA worthy successor to “Shaun of the Dead,” though not a sequel. That dealt with zombies in London; this, even more forbiddingly, deals with the British rural classes, hellbent on preserving their way of life. Simon Pegg (who co-wrote the script) stars as Nicholas Angel, an ambitious policeman consigned, for his own good, to a blameless country town, where he pairs up with an overweight local officer, Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), to chase shoplifters and swans. Needless to say, there are darker crimes to come, and the partners are finally drawn into deafening shoot-outs and high-speed chases—all the paraphernalia of the American cop movies to which Danny is so devoted. Edgar Wright’s movie, generous with its gags, doesn’t so much spoof the action-thriller genre as pay it prolonged homage, in the most inappropriate of settings; along the way, it finds time to anatomize, as did “Shaun of the Dead,” the peculiar lusts and lunacies of modern England—or, at least, that part of it which tries to wish modernity away.—Anthony Lane (4/30/07) (In wide release.)\n\nI DON’T WANT TO SLEEP ALONE\n\nThe first shot of Tsai Ming-Liang’s oblique drama—a paralyzed man in bed, fed through a tube and serenaded by a recorded aria from “The Magic Flute”—sets out the blend of degradation and exaltation that marks the entire story. A homeless man in Kuala Lumpur collapses at the side of the road and is taken in by a Bangladeshi migrant laborer. As the vagrant recovers and explores the neighborhood, he meets the paralyzed man’s sister; they become a couple of sorts, spending too much time looking for a trysting place among the hulking ruins of abandoned skyscrapers. But the man who took him in is attracted to him, too, as is the invalid’s mother (who, in scenes of colossal squirm value, can’t keep her hands off her son). This record of grinding frustration and fleeting tenderness, composed mainly of static long takes, plays out in a deadened, polyglot, pan-urban landscape of globalization’s unfulfilled promise; instead of a world brought together, Tsai shows natives turned into aliens at home, who remain silent in every language. His political point regarding Malaysia is sharp and angry: when government, religion, and tradition put desire under an iron fist despite the free market in labor, humans are reduced to beasts of burden, and their desire turns beastly as well. In Taiwanese, Malay, Mandarin, and Bengali.—R.B. (IFC Center.)\n\nLUCKY YOU\n\nThis gambling movie is tight and focussed at the Vegas tables where men (and the occasional woman) play the incomparable high-stakes game of Texas hold’em but is conventional, weak, and dumb everywhere else. Eric Bana is a poker brat who’s too emotional and undisciplined to be a winner; Robert Duvall (slit-eyed, and in good form) is his champion father; and Drew Barrymore is the moral girl from Bakersfield who falls in love not with the gambler in Bana but with the responsible man she would like him to be—a terrible basis for a love affair and a stuffy idea for a movie romance. Many real-life champion players sit around with the actors, muttering insults and a few grudging compliments. Written by Eric Roth and Curtis Hanson; directed by Hanson.—D.D. (5/14/07) (In wide release.)\n\nLES MAÎTRES FOUS\n\nTo the French filmmaker Jean Rouch, all the world’s a stage. In this 1955 documentary, he reports on the annual festivities of the West African Hauka cult. The group withdraws from the city of Accra, Ghana, to a rural compound, which they call the “government palace,” and play-act as the “mad masters” of the title. Working themselves up into drooling fits, burning themselves, sacrificing a dog and drinking its spurting blood, they mime the pomp of their colonial overlords, calling one another “captain,” “governor,” “secretary general,” and so on, and holding an officious conference to debate whether to eat the dog raw or cooked. The next day, back in Accra, the revellers trade one role for another, returning to their jobs as merchants, soldiers, laborers, and thieves. In subsequent films, Rouch pushed the idea of self-dramatization to more radical ends by working onscreen with his subjects to develop their personae, but here he embeds his illuminating psychosocial speculations in a straightforward documentary essay. In French.—R.B. (Film Forum; May 21.)\n\nSEVEN MEN FROM NOW\n\nBudd Boetticher’s stark 1956 Western offers a Hemingwayesque intensity of unspoken emotion and bitter wisdom and a visually terse style to match. Before you blink, two of the seven men are already gunned down by Stride (Randolph Scott), the former sheriff of Silver Springs, Colorado, who trawls the desert for the bandits who killed his wife, a Wells Fargo clerk, in a robbery. But the chest full of gold is still missing, and Masters (Lee Marvin), a criminal whom Stride had put away twice, is after it. Meanwhile, John and Annie Greer (Walter Reed and Gail Russell), two Easterners on their way to California whose wagon gets stuck in mud, are rescued by Stride, who falls for Annie but doesn’t act on it. In Boetticher’s harshly judgmental view, the lawless and barren landscape proves the humanity of some but dehumanizes others: the crazed robbers pursuing Stride scuttle among rocks like scorpions, while the wounded hero, as embodied by the huge yet delicate Scott, moves with a dancer’s proud grace.—R.B. (Walter Reade; May 16 and May 19.)\n\nSPIDER-MAN 3\n\nThe third and least of the series so far. Tobey Maguire, looking ever more costive and uncomfortable, returns as Peter Parker, who finds himself doubly transformed—first into the crime-busting arachnid whom we know and revere, and, second, into a black-suited alternative who revels in violence and, for some unknown reason, keeps breaking into dance moves. He is paired with a distracted Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) and, briefly and more entertainingly, with Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard), who looks like a villain waiting to happen. For the moment, we have to make do with a couple of dullards: the New Goblin (James Franco), warmed up from the previous films, and Venom (Topher Grace), a frustrated hack consumed by an extraterrestrial compound. All this is orchestrated by the director, Sam Raimi, with a halting, scattershot approach that verges on panic. The only person to emerge from the wreckage with any credit is Thomas Haden Church, who finds a grainy, melancholic streak in the unstoppable Sandman.—A.L. (5/7/07) (In wide release.)\n\nTHE TREATMENT\n\nOren Rudavsky’s movie tells of Jake Singer (Chris Eigeman), a flustered and bookish New Yorker; he could be the bulkier, less funny second cousin of Woody Allen’s Alvy Singer in “Annie Hall.” Jake has trouble with his love life, the specific problem being that he doesn’t have one. This is surprisingly solved when he falls for Allegra (Famke Janssen), the widowed mother of a boy in the private school where Jake teaches English; more surprising still, she falls for Jake in return. Their affair feels slight and plaintive, and the film—adapted by Rudavsky and Daniel Saul Housman from Daniel Menaker’s novel—would curl up and die were it not for the bracing presence of Ernesto Morales (Ian Holm), Jake’s Argentinean psychoanalyst. The movie flirts with the idea that Dr. Morales might be a figment of Jake’s fancy, but to no avail; thanks to Holm, it is Morales—at once withering and enlivening—who compels our attention, while the other figures fade away.—A.L. (5/7/07) (Angelika Film Center and Lincoln Plaza Cinemas.)\n\nTHE VALET\n\nAnother busy French farce from Francis Veber (“The Dinner Game”). Gad Elmaleh plays François Pignon, a humble parker of cars, who by sheer mischance—Veber’s specialty—ends up posing as the temporary lover of a supermodel (Alice Taglioni). Caught up in the whirl of circumstance are a number of other fools and avengers, including a bewildered billionaire (Daniel Auteuil) and his needle-sharp wife (Kristin Scott Thomas). As ever, Veber piles on the obstacles, but the movie feels unresolved, and it lacks the misanthropic verve of his earlier work; it almost seems to be priming itself for a softhearted Hollywood remake. In French.—A.L. (4/30/07) (Angelika Film Center and Cinemas 1, 2, and 3.)\n\nWAITRESS\n\nAdrienne Shelly wrote and directed this winning comedy (sadly, her last), starring Keri Russell as Jenna, a small-town waitress and expert pie baker married to a freakishly controlling husband (Jeremy Sisto). When Jenna gets pregnant, she drowns her sorrows by baking desserts with names like Bad Baby Pie and begins a torrid affair with her handsome, bland gynecologist (Nathan Fillion). The able supporting cast includes Andy Griffith (as the curmudgeonly diner owner), Cheryl Hines and Shelly (as Jenna’s sparky waitress friends), and Eddie Jemison (as a nerdy suitor), and Russell conveys Jenna’s bleak world with a pretty, expressionless face. Shelly deftly achieves a tone pitched between fantasy and reality, its levity belying an astute and humane study of an unhappy relationship steeped in inertia.—S.L. (In wide release.)\n\nWHITE NIGHTS\n\nLuchino Visconti, conjuring up Livorno in the Cinecittà studio, wrests visual poetry from that city’s winding streets and canals in his uneven yet touching 1957 adaptation of Dostoyevsky’s story. The film accumulates strength from the simple force of the central concept: a lonely man (Marcello Mastroianni) meets the woman of his dreams (Maria Schell), only to discover that she’s pining for the man of her dreams (Jean Marais). Mastroianni is wonderful as a modest fellow who pushes beyond his limits; he externalizes every bit of the character’s doting alertness and jealousy, especially in a funny, nerve-racking scene in which he draws his date’s attention away from a wiry rock-and-roller by doing his own slapstick jitterbug. The final sequences soar to those operatic heights which Visconti negotiated better than anyone, peaking when snow drapes the tormented heroine in white. Despite lapses in pace, tone, and casting, the movie is a showcase both for Mastroianni and for Visconti’s simultaneously baroque and limpid style. In Italian.—Michael Sragow (Walter Reade; May 16.)\n\nALSO PLAYING\n\nDELTA FARCE: In wide release. THE EX: In wide release. GEORGIA RULE: In wide release. THE HIP HOP PROJECT: In wide release.
