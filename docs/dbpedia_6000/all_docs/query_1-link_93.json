        "text": "''THE RIVER,'' which has absolutely nothing to do with Jean Renoir's 1951 classic set in India, is about Tom and Mae Garvey (Mel Gibson and Sissy Spacek), their two children and their attempts to hang on to their farm in spite of mounting bank debts, big business interests and, of course, the river.\n\nThe setting is rural Tennessee and the time is now. For generations the Garvey family has been farming the rich, brown, bottom lands along the river's banks. Every few years, after heavy rains, the river does what rivers have tended to do since the beginning of time. It overflows and wipes away crops, livestock, buildings and, frequently, people.\n\nThe problems faced by the Garveys are real and, in many parts of this country, they are still almost commonplace. Why do such farmers stay on? The land is incredibly rich and when there are no floods, the harvests are bountiful. It's also their land. Their roots are there. There is something staunch and heroic about farmers like the Garveys, but not about this movie, directed by Mark Rydell (''On Golden Pond'') and written by Robert Dillon and Julian Barry.\n\n''The River,'' which opens today at the Beekman Theater, has a meticulously detailed physical production and, from time to time, is acted with passion by its cast. Yet its ideas are so profoundly muddled that the film must run mainly on sentimentality. It is so mixed up, in fact, that it makes Jessica Lange's ''Country,'' which it resembles in many ways and which has its own problems, seem a model of clarity.\n\nThe film's most peculiar decision was to make a villain of the one person who has some idea of what might be done to temper the effects of nature. This man is Joe Wade (Scott Glenn), a childhood sweetheart of Mae's who has married rich and is a farmer himself. Wade appears to be the only man in the area to understand - as did the Administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933 - that nature may be altered. Though Wade is out to make his own fortune in the process and, if possible, to seduce Mae, his ideas are essentially sound.\n\nIt was in 1933 that the Federal Government sponsored the Tennessee Valley Authority and the eventual construction of a network of dams, canals and locks along the Tennessee River and its tributaries, not only to control flooding but also to provide cheap electrical power and to increase river transportation.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
