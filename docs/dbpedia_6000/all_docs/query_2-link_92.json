        "text": "I learned yesterday, as word quickly spread about the sudden passing of Bart Blatstein’s son, Ryan.\n\nI want to take this opportunity to extend my deepest condolences to Bart, who is a good friend and the owner of Showboat Atlantic City.\n\nBart is presently living every parent’s worst nightmare, the impossible loss of a child.\n\nA profound loss such as this, goes against the laws of nature, as no parent should ever have to suffer the loss of a child.\n\nThe photo above and below is from Laura Goldman, a freelance producer at Good Morning America, who wrote about Bart and his son Ryan flying to Israel to volunteer on a military base during the war against Hamas through through Sar-El.\n\nGoldman shared about Bart and Ryan’s journey (in Bart’s own words) in an effort to encourage others to volunteer.\n\nThis is a great example of the kind of person that Bart Blatstein is and the volunteer mission with his son Ryan is a case study as to how they have lived their lives together.\n\nBart said that “if Jews can’t be safe in Israel, there's no where we can be safe,” Blatstein told Goldman.\n\nBart explained to Goldman why he volunteered on this mission to Israel:\n\nI was 13 years old when the 6 day War broke out. We were living in Northeast Philly across the street from our synagogue, Shaare Shamayim. At the breakout of the war, all members were called to the synagogue for an emergency meeting. I remember like it was yesterday. I remember even where I sat that night. It was one of those things that are forever burned in your memory ; where you were when Kennedy was assassinated, the 9/11 attack, etc.\n\nOctober 7th changed me forever. I always telt an underlying antisemitism in the world, but never could I imagine the viciousness of what is happening now. How could the world be blind to the utterly blatant lying of the haters? Israel is smaller than New Jersey, has never attacked another country, is the only democracy in the Middle East, and accepts all people as equal in Israel, said Blatstein, to Goldman.\n\nBlatstein was greatly influenced by his Father, Harry and here he was in Israel with his son, Ryan doing such important and unselfish work.\n\nThis is The Bart Blatstein that I have gotten to know over the past decade.\n\nPlease pray for Bart Blatstein and his family during this very difficult time of profound loss.\n\nSOURCE: Laura Goldman, Freelance Producer at Good Morning America via Facebook."
