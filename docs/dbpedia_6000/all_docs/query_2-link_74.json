        "text": "Plot Summary • Norman and Ethyl Thayer visit their Summer cottage on Golden Pond to celebrate Norman’s 80th birthday. • Joining them is their daughter, Chelsea, her boyfriend Bill, and his son Billy Jr. • Norman is faced with his mortality and changes that often accompany aging. These changes bring about a negative attitude that revolves around limited time and death. • Chelsea and her father have been estranged and her visit brings up old wounds.\n\nPlot Summary continued • Chelsea and Bill leave for Europe for a month, leaving Billy Jr. behind to spend the time with Norman and Ethyl. • Billy’s attitude toward the old couple is one of disdain and he talks of leaving and going back to California. • Norman and Ethyl slowly interest Billy Jr. in life on the pond and soon he begins fishing and doing things around the house with them. • Norman and Billy forge a bond that changes Billy Jr.’s attitude toward the old couple and relationships with elders. • Chelsea returns to see that Norman has a relationship with Billy Jr. that she never had with her father. • Norman and Chelsea work toward healing the rift that has pulled them apart for so many years.\n\nAging-Related Concepts in the Film • Director Mark Rydell sets the film in an old cottage on Golden Pond that has seen some wear and tear similar to the physical changes that Norman and Ethyl have experienced over the years. The unhinged door is a metaphor for Norman’s aging mind,body, and his attitude. With some care, it may be repaired. • Norman and Billy Jr. search for “Walter”, the elusive trout that is the prize of their fishing trips. The fish symbolizes the peace that Norman is seeking in dealing with his mortality."
