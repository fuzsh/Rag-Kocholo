        "text": "1991 film directed by Mark Rydell\n\nFor the BoysDirected byMark RydellScreenplay byMarshall Brickman\n\nNeal Jimenez\n\nLindy LaubStory byNeal Jimenez\n\nLindy LaubProduced byBette Midler\n\nBonnie Bruckheimer\n\nMargaret SouthStarringCinematographyStephen GoldblattEdited byJerry Greenberg\n\nJere HugginsMusic byDave GrusinDistributed by20th Century Fox\n\nRelease date\n\nRunning time\n\n138 minutesCountryUnited StatesLanguageEnglishBudget$40 millionBox office$23.2 million\n\nFor the Boys is a 1991 American musical comedy-drama film that traces the life of Dixie Leonard, a 1940s actress/singer who teams up with Eddie Sparks, a famous performer, to entertain American troops.\n\nThe film was adapted by Marshall Brickman, Neal Jimenez, and Lindy Laub from a story by Jimenez and Laub. It was directed by Mark Rydell and the original music score was composed by Dave Grusin. It stars Bette Midler, James Caan, George Segal, Patrick O'Neal, Arye Gross, and Norman Fell. A then-unknown Vince Vaughn made his film debut as a cheering soldier in a crowd.\n\nAs in The Rose, Midler's first starring role and also a large budget quasi-biopic, the film is fiction. However, actress and singer Martha Raye believed that Midler's character was based on many widely known facts about her life and career with the USO and pursued legal action based on that assumption. After a protracted legal engagement, Raye ultimately lost the case. The Caan character was generally believed to be based on Bob Hope.\n\nFor her performance, Midler won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress. The soundtrack features covers of many classic songs, including \"Come Rain or Come Shine\", \"Baby, It's Cold Outside\" by Frank Loesser, \"P.S. I Love You\", \"I Remember You\" and the Beatles' \"In My Life\". Five of the 13 songs have lyrics by Johnny Mercer. The soundtrack's first single, \"Every Road Leads Back to You,\" was an original written by Diane Warren.\n\nDespite a mixed critical reception and box office failure, the film was adapted for the musical stage in 2011 by Aaron Thielen and Terry James and debuted at the Marriott Theatre in Lincolnshire, Illinois.[1][2]\n\nIn the early 1990s, retired entertainer Dixie Leonard has a commitment to attend a Hollywood ceremony being televised live to honor her and her longtime show-biz partner Eddie Sparks. When a young man from the TV show comes to pick her up, Dixie balks and explains what brought Eddie and her together, as well as what drove them apart. The majority of the film is an extended flashback.\n\nDixie's story begins during World War II when she receives an offer to entertain the troops overseas as part of Eddie's act. Dixie is an instant hit with the boys in uniform, but Eddie wants her gone, ostensibly because he finds her kind of humor too coarse, but in actuality because she stole the show by topping his jokes. Dixie doesn't care for him much, either, but fellow entertainers and her joke-writer uncle Art persuade her to stay.\n\nEddie wins her over, particularly by reuniting Dixie with her soldier husband on stage. However, later in the war, Dixie's husband dies in battle.\n\nDespite her distaste for Eddie, Dixie continues working with him back in the States...mostly to support herself and her son Danny. Eddie is married with daughters, yet he becomes a proud surrogate father to Danny.\n\nAs the Korean War breaks out, Eddie announces on stage that he and Dixie will be performing for the U.S. troops there, without having told Dixie of his plans first. In revenge, Dixie announces that Eddie made a $100,000 donation ($1,174,000 today) to the Red Cross. Reluctantly, she travels to Korea with him. On their way to the camp, they encounter a unit of soldiers that has been ambushed. Dixie cares for a wounded soldier but cannot save him: he is pronounced dead on arrival at the field hospital. Dixie and Eddie appear to spend the night together. At the Christmas dinner, a fight ensues after Art announces to everybody that Eddie has fired him for being a communist sympathizer.\n\nIn the meantime, Danny has grown up to be a soldier like his father and is deployed to Vietnam. At Art's suggestion, Dixie eventually agrees to perform there for Christmas with Eddie. On their way to the camp, the performers are warned of the camp possibly being attacked, because of which they are to be flown out immediately after their performance. Before going on stage, Dixie and Eddie meet Danny, who reveals to them the barbarity that is spreading among his comrades. The show begins with the performance of a dancer, who starts getting harassed by the soldiers, and only Eddie's intervention prevents the situation from getting out of control. Dixie comes on stage and makes some cynical remarks about the soldiers, then sings “In My Life”. While she is still on stage, the camp is attacked in a mortar barrage. Dixie and Eddie find shelter, but Danny is killed right in front of them; both mourn deeply for him.\n\nDixie has not forgiven Eddie for his part in all this, and they have another heated argument in the dressing room. Eddie goes out on stage alone. But, at the last minute, because he speaks of their joint loss in Vietnam, Dixie joins him on stage for one last song and dance, before appearing to accept their mutual love for one another.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics, holding a 44% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 16 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10.[3] John Simon of the National Review called For the Boys \"mindless\".[4]\n\nProduced on a $40 million budget, For the Boys was a commercial disappointment upon its original release, returning just $23 million in box office receipts worldwide.\n\nAward Category Nominee(s) Result Academy Awards[5] Best Actress Bette Midler Nominated Chicago Film Critics Association Awards[6] Best Actress Nominated Golden Globe Awards[7] Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy Won Best Original Score – Motion Picture Dave Grusin Nominated\n\nThe soundtrack album is composed largely of popular standards from the era, although several were written after the time period in which the film takes place.\n\nTrack Listing Information based on the album's Liner Notes[8]\n\n\"Billy-a-Dick\"\n\nPerformed by Bette Midler\n\nwith Orchestra arranged & conducted by Marc Shaiman\n\nMusic composed by Hoagy Carmichael\n\nLyrics written by Paul Francis Webster\n\nBackground Vocals: Patty Darcy\n\n\"Stuff Like That There\"\n\nPerformed by Bette Midler with Orchestra conducted by Billy May\n\nWritten by Jay Livingston & Ray Evans\n\nArranged by Billy May & Arif Mardin\n\n\"P.S.
