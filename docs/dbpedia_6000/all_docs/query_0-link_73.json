        "text": "The Cowboys\n\nThe Score Card\n\nThe Movie : 7.5\n\nThe story is a simple one: Wayne is a rancher whose hands have succumbed to gold fever and left him without help to drive his 1500 head of cattle to market 400 miles away. Reluctantly he agrees to train ten or eleven schoolboys, none older than 15, one barely half his height, to help him manage the two-month drive. While not without some riding experience, the boys are fairly ignorant about the trail, so they, and us, can expect the drive to be an ordeal. But even before they leave, we can see serious trouble looming in the form of likely bad guys when Bruce Dern and friend are rejected by Wayne as hired help for the liars they are. The light touch Rydell and his writers have with the boys never gets mired into sentimentality – this is no Disney movie of the period. When things turn south, and they do, Rydell doesn't flinch, and the boys find the necessary grit to do what needs to be done. There's a traditional formula that needs to be observed, and Rydell & Co. do so - perhaps too handily and too easily in the end. To some the resolution will seem a satisfying conclusion, to others, its weakness. On this, my first screening of the movie, my feeling is that \"growth\" came at a high price: namely, by a method not dissimilar from the evil forces opposed to them.\n\nImage : 9 - One of the many things I like about the image is how clear it is when Wayne is seen in close-up – like they went to extra trouble to present every nook and craggy. When the camera pulls back, the texture of his vest and leather accoutrements are downright palpable. The indoor lighting of the classroom is a complete fraud (looks like the roof was taken off just for this shoot) but they are also some of the most gorgeous images in the movie: saturated color, deep focus, great textures. The vistas with large open sky struck me as a tad overexposed and soft, but there was an impression of endless prairie that a more saturated picture might not have offered. The BD image is terrific and hard to imagine we shall see it bettered in our lifetime."
