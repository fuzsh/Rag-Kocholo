        "text": "Coogan’s Bluff, American crime drama, released in 1968, that marks the first teaming of Clint Eastwood and director Don Siegel, who later collaborated on the popular Dirty Harry movies.\n\nDeputy Sheriff Walt Coogan (played by Eastwood) is a tough lawman from Arizona who travels to New York City to extradite an escaped killer, James Ringerman (Don Stroud). Ringerman, however, is in the hospital after overdosing on LSD. Coogan grows increasingly frustrated at the legal technicalities hindering Ringerman’s release and soon takes matters into his own hands. He tricks the hospital into releasing Ringerman into his custody, but plans go awry when the killer’s girlfriend arranges for Coogan to be beaten. Ringerman escapes with a gun stolen from Coogan, leading to further chases—on motorcycles and on foot—and additional fights, including a vicious confrontation in a pool hall, before the fugitive is finally apprehended.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nBest Picture Movie Quote Quiz"
