        "text": "A former jazz pianist who appeared on Broadway and TV before beginning his directing career with series such as \"Ben Casey,\" \"I Spy\" and \"Gunsmoke,\" Rydell earned critical acclaim for his debut feature, \"The Fox\" (1968). He also won plaudits for his helming of \"Cinderella Liberty\" (1973) and \"The Rose\" (1979). \"On Golden Pond\" (1981), a typical film, in that it displayed its director's fondness for sentiment and nostalgia, earned him an Oscar nomination as Best Director. Rydell has subsequently made films only occasionally, some (\"The River\" 1984) doing fairly well with critics, while others (\"Intersection\" 1994 and the somewhat overly maligned \"For the Boys\" 1991) did less well with critics and public alike."
