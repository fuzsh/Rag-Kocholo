        "text": "is there a film genre name where a bunch of of different characters have separate plotlines that end up tying them together somehow even if they never meet all together?\n\n20 bucks - This multi-character comedy follows the path of a single twenty-dollar bill in a city neighborhood, focusing on various holders and their intertwining stories, including two convenience store robbers, an estranged father and daughter, and a young newlywed couple.\n\neven money - Forest Whitaker, Kim Basinger, Danny Devito, Kelsey Grammer and Ray Liotta star in director Mark Rydell’s ensemble addiction drama detailing the manner in which gambling and drugs affect a variety of people’s lives during the weeks leading up to a championship college basketball game.\n\nbug - In the charming independent movie Bug, a small boy squashing an insect sets in motion a series of events, large and small, that include a lost restaurant reservation, a drunken fender-bender, disruption of basic cable television service, and more than one relationship falling apart. One person’s disaster becomes another’s boon, and vice versa–because a man loses his job, a young girl becomes the lead ballerina in the school play, which in turn causes the death of a pet pig. Featuring Brian Cox (Manhunter, L.I.E.), Jamie Kennedy (Scream, Malibu’s Most Wanted), Sarah Poulson (Down with Love), and John Carroll Lynch (Fargo, Bubble Boy), Bug takes a comic look at the interconnectedness of life. The movie occasionally tries too hard for emotional resonance, but its best comic touches–like some vengeful fortune cookie messages written by a jilted boyfriend–give Bug a wry wit worth checking out. --Bret Fetzer"
