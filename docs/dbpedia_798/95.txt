Last fall, Låpsley treated eager fans waiting for new music to a double single release which featured “Burn” and “Hurt Me.” Since then, however, she has been rather quiet, but for good reason. Today, Låpsley announces her forthcoming debut album Long Way Home will be released on March 4 via XL Recordings.

Låpsley follows up the good news by sharing her new single “Love Is Blind.” The 19-year-old digs deep into subjects of relationships and maturing as she continues the journey her career has taken her on. For the album’s first single, Låpsley takes a leap of faith and trusts her heart to lead her in the right direction.

Listen to “Love Is Blind” below.
