“Love Is Blind” is back.

Just four months after Season 5 of the Kinetic Content series wrapped up on Netflix, the new season will debut on Netflix. Season 6 will be set in Charlotte, North Carolina, as 30 singles attempt to find true love and choose to get engaged before ever meeting their partner face-to-face.

The premise each season remains the same: if two singles connect in the pods, through a wall, they can get engaged and finally meet. Next, they’ll move in together, plan their wedding and find out if and how their lives can come together. Once their wedding days arrive, they each must decide if they want to get married or call it off.

Nick and Vanessa Lachey return to the 10-episode season, during which the singles will “form deep and immediate connections, setting the stage for an unexpected journey full of twists, turns, and shocking revelations that will test each relationship well after the participants leave the pods for the real world,” according to Netflix.

The first six episodes will debut on February 14; episodes 7-9 will drop on Feb. 21, followed by episodes 10 and 11 on Feb. 28. The finale will drop on March 6.

Creator Chris Coelen executive produces along with Ally Simpson, Brent Gauches, Eric Detwiler and Brian Smith.
