        "text": "On this day in 1969, Blind Faith reached #1 with their self-titled album in the UK. The album also made it to #1 in the States.\n\nThe band was an English supergroup consisting of Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood, Ginger Baker, and Ric Grech. Their collaboration was short-lived, lasting only a few months and producing just one album.\n\nHow Blind Faith Started\n\nIn December of 1968, Eric Clapton and Steve Winwood were playing together in Clapton’s basement. Clapton’s band, Cream, had broken up the month before due to animosity between Jack Bruce (bass) and Ginger Baker (drums).\n\nIn early 1969, the pair moved to a rehearsal cottage that Winwood’s band, Traffic, normally used. Traffic had started a year earlier but was already down a guitarist.\n\nWhat started out as informal jam sessions quickly evolved into Blind Faith when Baker joined in.\n\nInitially, Clapton didn’t think a band with him and Baker was a good idea. Firstly, he had promised Bruce that if any of Cream’s members performed together again, all three of them would play, but he had little interest in reuniting the trio only 9 weeks after the band had called it quits. He was also hesitant to start working with another group whose members each had their own individual fame. He wanted to do something more low-key.\n\nBut Winwood pushed the issue and Clapton eventually agreed to let Baker into the band.\n\nTraffic disbanded when the supergroup formed and Windwood began focusing his attention on Blind Faith.\n\nReleasing Their One And Only Album\n\nIn May of 1969, Ric Grech left his current band, Family, to join Blind Faith.\n\nBlind Faith quickly began recording their self-titled album, which released in July of 1969. Upon its release, the album sold more than 500,000 copies in a single month. It also helped refresh sales for Cream’s albums. In fact, while Blind Faith was sitting in the top position, Best of Cream moved up to #3 on the Billboard charts.\n\nA Controversial Cover\n\nThe original release of Blind Faith’s self-titled album had a photo of a topless 11-year-old girl holding a silver spaceship.\n\nAs you would expected, the cover provoked a lot of controversy. As a result, the US release instead used an image of the band on the cover.\n\nTouring\n\nLeading up to the album’s release, Blind Faith held a free concert at Hyde Park in London. They performed all 6 songs that would appear on the album as well as covers of Rolling Stone, Traffic, and Sam Myer songs.\n\nWhile the band still needed to spend more time rehearsing to tighten up the show, their management pushed them to continue touring. They started at small venues in Scandinavia to help prepare for the bigger audiences they would have in the UK and US. They then travelled to the US, where they debuted at Madison Square Garden. Because their set list was so short, Blind Faith had to fill time with covers of Cream and Traffic songs.\n\nFree, Taste, and Delaney & Bonnie were the opening acts for the show. As the tour progressed Clapton began spending more time with Delaney & Bonnie. He would sit in on their sets and sometimes take up percussion to support them. Soon he was more interested in them headlining the show instead of Blind Faith.\n\nFollowing the completion of their US tour on August 24, Winwood and Clapton decided to disband. While they told Grech right away, Baker didn't find out until returning from a trip to Jamaica. News of the band's break up became official in October of 1969.\n\nRELATED: Clapton’s first project after Blind Faith broke up was the Plastic Ono Band …\n\nOther Notable Rock Events From September 20\n\n1957 - Buddy Holly released “Peggy Sue.”\n\n1968 - Still recording as The Yardbirds, Led Zeppelin started to record their debut album.\n\n1969 - CCR went to #1 for the second time with the release of “Bad Moon Rising.”\n\n1969 - John Lennon left The Beatles after his performance at Rock And Roll Revival in Toronto.
