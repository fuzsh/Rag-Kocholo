LAU) by NINA, released 05 June 2020\n\nGonna regret in the morning\r\nDon’t waste your time\r\nGonna feel worse than when you first started\r\nAnd you’ll feel the loneliness\r\nIf love is blind\r\nThen why is it that no one cares tonight?\r\nCan’t stop, I’m racing down the motorway, I know,\r\nWon’t stop the feeling but I’m racing just like the speed of light\r\nOh give me someone that I can love\r\nGive me someone cause that’s all I’ve got\r\nJust take my heart and the rest of my devotion\r\nCause I am drowning, drowning, drowning so bad\r\nGonna forget in the morning\r\nWhy you first went out\r\nGonna drink all night and you’re still heavy hearted\r\nAnd the memories remain\r\nCan’t fight them back, you were trying to erase your mind\r\nCan’t stop, I’m racing down the motorway I know\r\nWon’t stop the feeling but I’m racing just like speed of light\r\nOh give me someone that I can love\r\nGive me someone cause that’s all I’ve got\r\nJust take my heart and the rest of my devotion\r\nCause I am drowning, drowning, drowning\r\nOh Give me something that I can have\r\nGive me something cause that’s all I’ve got\r\nJust take my love and the rest of my emotions\r\nI’m tired of trying trying trying so hard\r\nLife feels so long without direction\r\nYou’re my own reflection\r\nOh give me someone that I can love\r\nGive me someone cause that’s all I’ve got\r\nJust take my heart and the rest of my devotion\r\nCause I am drowning, drowning, drowning\r\nOh Give me something that I can have\r\nGive me something cause that’s all I’ve got\r\nJust take my love and the rest of my emotions\r\nI’m tired of trying trying trying so hard\r\nThey say that love is blind\r\nGive me someone",
