        "text": "My debut album, Dark Angel, charts the course of a soul in search of peace, a mind in pursuit of enlightenment, and a being intent on a passionate and richly sensual life. I sing of “spiritual winters” that “turn lead into gold” (“Dark Angel”), of crucible experiences that break you but “in all the right places” such that you emerge “better than before” (“Broken”). An idealist, I present a utopian vision for a peaceful humanity – a universe of plenty where “no one is need, and beauty isn’t physical, it’s in the way you think” (“Secret Place”).\n\nAll songs were written by Sarah Melanie Prodan and produced by Robert Sibony. Vocals and piano were performed by Sarah Melanie Prodan. Drum set, percussion, and string arrangements by Robert Sibony. For “Source Divine”: guitar by Winston Hancock; orchestration and (additional) piano by David Nelson; bass by Mike Costantino. Recorded at 01 System Studio and St-Denis Studios in Toronto.\n\nThe title track to this album, “Dark Angel,” was released to radio in March 2016. It has aired on CBC and SiriusXM Satellite Radio Canada.\n\nTo listen, stream, or purchase, click here.\n\nIt is a pleasure to thank my friends and family for their love and encouragement, and my musical collaborators for their generous contribution to the project. This album would not exist if not for the dedicated guidance and passionate expertise of Robert Sibony. I would like to thank James Meier for making 01 System Studio consistently available to us throughout our recording period. To Roger St.-Denis, I remain indebted for the memorable use of his hauntingly beautiful Bösendorfer. I am grateful to David Hixon for his breathtaking photography and graphic art, which I had the privilege to include on the cover of this album. I owe a special thanks to Joe Prodan, my partner in love and life, for his support of this project and of my creative path generally.\n\nLyrics\n\nWhat’s It All For?\n\nYou come, you go, like the wind\n\nI feel both empty and full within\n\nI’ve been down this road before\n\nPicking my clothes up off your floor\n\nSwearing, once again, never more\n\nWhat’s it all for?\n\nWhat’s it all for?\n\nI leave, tiptoe out the door\n\nHeading home, at the dawn of a new day\n\nI rinse away the night\n\nFighting the memory with all my might\n\nSwearing, once again, never more\n\nWhat’s it all for?\n\nWhat’s it all for?\n\nConnections make for heartache\n\nWhen love don’t reach your heart\n\nIt’s over before it starts\n\nWhat’s it all for?\n\nWhat’s it all for?\n\nThis time a truth sets in\n\nKeep it up, in love how can I win,\n\nWhen cravings that beg for more\n\nKnocking at midnight upon my door?\n\nSwear, once last time, never more\n\nWhat’s it all for?\n\nWhat’s it all for?\n\nAll and None\n\nWhen I’m lost and I can’t see\n\nThe forest for the trees\n\nI stop and breathe and ask: fight or flee?\n\nAnd the answer is always up to me\n\nAll and none\n\nAll and none\n\nWhy be a slave to everyone?\n\nIn truth, you answer but to one\n\nLeave me, I won’t plead\n\nPierce me, I won’t bleed\n\nI’ve made my peace\n\nWhat will be will be\n\nI trust in me\n\nAll and none\n\nAll and none\n\nWhy be a slave to everyone?\n\nIn truth, you answer but to one\n\nWhen I’m on my knees\n\nIt’s not to appease\n\nSome earthly ruler\n\nWith a godless ring\n\nI answer to another king\n\nAll and none\n\nAll and none\n\nWhy be a slave to everyone?\n\nIn truth, you answer but to one\n\nBroken\n\nIt’s around the corner\n\nYou can feel it now\n\nA lot like winter\n\nBut worse somehow\n\nCold and jarring\n\nBut you’re not alone\n\nA fire will warm you\n\nWhen you’re frozen to the bone\n\nFirst, there’ll be a storm\n\nOutside forces, in your path\n\nAnd you’ll be broken\n\nIn all the right places\n\nIs this what grace is?\n\nLost at sunset\n\nBut you’re not alone\n\nA light in the darkness\n\nGuides you home\n\nWhen you get there\n\nyou’ll see how much you’ve grown\n\nFirst, there’ll be a storm\n\nOutside forces, in your path\n\nAnd you’ll be broken\n\nIn all the right places\n\nIs this what grace is?\n\nBroken, and better than before\n\nOpen to so much more\n\nBroken, and better than before\n\nOpen to so much more\n\nBroken, and better than before\n\nOpen to so much more\n\nDark Angel\n\nDark angel sleep\n\nLost inside a dream\n\nHolding on\n\nFor the dawn\n\nDark angel, think:\n\nWhat brought you to this brink?\n\nDid all your choices?\n\nLead to this scene?\n\nIce in your heart\n\nSnow in your soul\n\nSpiritual winters\n\nCreate the worst cold\n\nYou want to break free\n\nYou’re frozen in fear\n\nReaching for something\n\nThat’s no longer here\n\nDark angel, breathe\n\nYou’re stronger than you know\n\nSeek the truth\n\nYou’ll find your way through\n\nDark angel, feel\n\nSo you can finally heal\n\nLet it go\n\nSun follow snow\n\nIce in your heart\n\nSnow in your soul\n\nSpiritual winters\n\nCreate the worst cold\n\nYou want to break free\n\nYou’re frozen in fear\n\nReaching for something\n\nThat’s no longer real\n\nDark Angel hope\n\nYou are all I see\n\nI pray for your reprieve\n\nPlease believe\n\nYou will break free\n\nThe fear will melt\n\nYou’ll reach for new\n\nAnd see it’s in view\n\nGo with love in your heart\n\nAnd light in your soul\n\n’Cause spiritual winters\n\nTurn lead into gold\n\nTurn lead into gold\n\nSource Divine\n\nI had traveled far to find you\n\nFrom galaxies beyond\n\nThrough danger, illusion\n\nWith this longing in my heart\n\nIn your arms, I found\n\nA twin soul, a lover\n\nA new friend, so old I\n\nWould long for no other\n\nA dream shared\n\nA need to surrender\n\nTo the path of love\n\nNew life did begin\n\nArose from within\n\nRenewed us\n\nLife, choosing new life\n\nRemembered its source divine\n\nSource divine\n\nSource divine\n\nAll mine, divine\n\nBut our honeymoon would end\n\nThe stars were not aligned\n\nWith one last kiss we parted\n\nIn remembrance and regret\n\nA dream shared\n\nA need to surrender\n\nTo the path of love\n\nNew life did begin\n\nArose from within\n\nRenewed us\n\nLife, choosing new life\n\nRemembered its source divine\n\nSource divine\n\nSource divine\n\nFor all time\n\nDivine\n\nSecret Place\n\nThere’s a secret place I go to\n\nWhen all the world’s asleep\n\nA kaleidoscope reality\n\nOf ever-shifting scenes\n\nSeashells, now cornucopias\n\nNo one is in need\n\nAnd beauty isn’t physical\n\nIt’s in the way you think\n\nWhen I’m staring down the crossroads\n\nOf overwhelm and calm\n\nThis is my still point\n\nWhere life and I meet\n\nPeace\n\nSerenity\n\nFor you and me\n\nFloating free\n\nA full spectrum universe\n\nOf different frequencies\n\nColours are richer\n\nFor their diversity\n\nWe exist as thought-forms\n\nPlain for all to read\n\nEver-changing entities\n\nEntwined and yet distinct\n\nWhen I’m staring down the crossroads\n\nOf overwhelm and calm\n\nThis is my still point\n\nWhere life and I meet\n\nPeace\n\nSerenity\n\nFor you and me\n\nFloating free\n\nThere’s a secret place I go to\n\nWhen all the world’s asleep –\n\nBlind with eyes wide open\n\nTo all that lies beneath\n\nIt’s not an illusion\n\nFor those who dare to dream\n\nOf a world of truth and love\n\nWhere all is energy\n\nWhen I’m staring down the crossroads\n\nOf overwhelm and calm\n\nThis is my still point\n\nWhere life and I meet\n\nPeace\n\nSerenity\n\nFor you and me\n\nFloating free\n\nCome to me\n\nThey had met before\n\nYears ago, at a tender age\n\nFor a purpose ill defined\n\nHe would fall in love\n\nShe would not return his gaze\n\nHe turned it deep within\n\nCome to me\n\nYou’re all I see\n\nI’d give it all\n\nTo fall from grace\n\nShe would fade away\n\nThat he might know a brighter day\n\nBehold the sight of God\n\nCome to me\n\nYou’re all I see\n\nI’d give it all\n\nTo fall from grace\n\nThey would say goodbye\n\nShe would die to save his soul\n\nDeliver him beyond\n\nCome to me\n\nYou’re all I see\n\nI’d give it all\n\nTo fall from grace\n\nCome to me\n\nYou’re all I see\n\nLoving Touch\n\nAlone by a candle, still in the dark\n\nRevealed, she trembles, a tree without bark\n\nNaked beside one so veiled and disguised\n\nDeceit, devastation side by side\n\nAn emotional soul in a spiritual cage\n\nA clairvoyant blind to sins of a darker age\n\nRavaged by reason, she accepts defeat\n\nSpirit takes over as her senses retreat\n\nLoving touch\n\nYou hurt so much\n\nLoving touch\n\nA sphinx unrisen, alone she rides\n\nDown the hall of history to her maker and scribe\n\nTo answer quandaries deep in her soul\n\nBeg for restitution for all he stole\n\nThe labyrinth of her mind\n\nCan no longer hide\n\nThe simple truth\n\nOf her secret bind\n\nLoving touch\n\nYou reveal so much\n\nLoving touch\n\nIn the flicker and flash of half a breath\n\nSuspended, she is, between life and death\n\nAn icy finger dispels the night air\n\nDistilling her conscience, decanting with care\n\nLeft of centre and the eye of the storm\n\nBlinded by chaos, enlightened by form\n\nAs at last she spies with her inner-eye\n\nSelf-betrayal – the only honest lie\n\nLoving touch\n\nYou hurt so much\n\nLoving touch\n\nLoving touch\n\nYou reveal so much\n\nLoving touch\n\nLoving touch\n\nYou hurt so much\n\nLoving touch\n\n© Sarah Prodan 2015.
