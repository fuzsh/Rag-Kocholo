        "text": "As you're watching the new reunion special Love is Blind: After the Altar, you may have a few creeping questions. When was this filmed? Where was this filmed?\n\nIt may or may not surprise you to find out that the answer...is basically the same as it was for Love Is Blind Season 1.\n\nHere's what we know about when and where Love is Blind: After the Altar was filmed.\n\nNetflix's almost sci-fi-esque dating (marriage?) reality show Love is Blind was an unquestioned phenomenon when it first dropped way back in March 2020. And, well, since then we've had a whole damn pandemic, and the all-powerful producers obviously realized that the fans needed at least a little bit more. So while the wait for a true Love is Blind Season 2 continues, some of that thirst was quenched with the release of Love is Blind: After the Altar, which checks back in on the show's couples and contestants two years after their marriages (and their not-marriages) over three drama-packed episodes\n\nWhile you watch the updated stories of the cast unfold (and try to figure out whatever drama is happening with Damian and Francesca from Too Hot to Handle), you may have been wondering when the show was filmed. Again, in case you haven't noticed, there's been an ongoing pandemic and it can be a little confusing to see things filmed that basically look normal. You also may have been wondering where the show was filmed—after all, some of those skylines and locations are pretty striking. The good news is that while we don't have much more information on when we'll be checking in on the Love is Blind world again, we can answer the When and Where of it all for you.\n\nWhere was Love is Blind: After the Altar filmed?\n\nFor anyone wondering where the first season of Love Is Blind was filmed—mainly thinking of that incredible set, complete with the pods and the futuristic aesthetic—the answer was in a set built completely from scratch at Pinewood Studios in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nFor After the Altar, the special celebrating the two-year-later event, Love is Blind once again returned to film in Atlanta, Georgia. The city has a recognizable skyline, but Georgia has also become a popular state for film and television production because of its generous income tax credits. Fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies may know that almost all of those movies are filmed in Atlanta, as are many other production companies, including Tyler Perry Studios.\n\nWhen was Love is Blind: After the Altar filmed?\n\nWe know that Season 1 of Love is Blind began filming in October of 2018, and concluded the following month, November 2018, with the weddings of Lauren and Cameron and Amber and Matthew (which means they had to keep their relationships/marriages secret for more than a year!).\n\nGiven that Love is Blind: After the Altar takes place during the two-year anniversary of these two weddings, that would place the filming date around November 2020. Around when that would've been happening, Amber and Cameron posted Instagrams celebrating their successful two years of marriage.\n\nThe show also make references to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, which, along with the fact that most productions had started back up by late summer/early fall of 2020, helps to place the show at a specific point in recent time/memory."
