        "text": "I'm kinda hoping once Maiden call it a day (on the road) that they still do some releases & studio stuff. I can't imagine it happening at all, but I'm dreaming here... (totally off-topic btw!)\n\n...so they do a live studio session (like Abbey Road) where they play SiT from start to finish, trying to recreate the sound. They dust of some old solid state Gallien Krueger amps; Adrian delves into the massive guitar collection he has, and finds his old Roland G-707 synth guitar controller (if he kept it; but I've read he's kept most guitars he's played over the years) --& we just sit back & listen to that heavenly 80's guitar sound, filtered through 30 years of experience. Of course, I wouldn't let Janick anywhere near any of the solos!\n\nThis is a hard one, but I think it would have to be a combination of hits and rare songs:\n\n1. Aces High\n\n2. Futureal\n\n3. Revelations\n\n4. The Trooper\n\n5. Brighter Than a Thousand Suns\n\n6. Run Silent Run Deep\n\n7. Killers\n\n8. Blood Brothers\n\n9. The Clairvoyant\n\n10. Lord of the Flies\n\n11. Paschendale\n\n12. Run to the Hills\n\n13. Fear of the Dark\n\n14. Iron Maiden\n\n-------------------\n\n15. The Number of the Beast\n\n16. Starblind\n\n17. Alexander the Great\n\n-------------------\n\n18. Hallowed Be Thy Name\n\nOf course, this is a dreamer setlist.\n\nBut, it hits every album at least once, gets in the inevitable hits, and nails a few never played songs.\n\nThe set opens with the double salvo of Aces High -> Futureal, and then settles into Revelations. The epics are spaced nicely throughout with the short songs. The encore begins with a favorite in Number, and then does what are quite possible the best songs never played. Then, the show closes. The sense is that it was a great show, but how could they not play Hallowed on their final tour? And then they play it on a second encore!\n\nThis is really just my fantasy final setlist, and the last part is just based on my possibly weird obsession with suspense. But I had fun making it, and that's what matters.\n\nAriana, you've got it. And (why not dreaming ?), I'd like DiAnno to be onstage for the first few songs, then Dickinson, Bayley, and Dickinson back again (although he would never accept that). Burr coul never play again, which is a shame 'cos I used to love his playing so much. And I think ending with Iron Maiden is a must, and they should play all the cornerstones of their long career. And I obvioulsly hope Steve and Davey will be the very last to quit the stage, hopefully crying.\n\nI hope they bring out some rarely or never played songs for the hardcore fans but also for new fans who never have had the chance to hear those \"forgotten\" gems before.\n\nCaught somewhere in Time\n\nPurgatory\n\nStill Life\n\nOut of the silent Planet\n\nFlight of Icarus\n\nChildren of the Damned\n\nRun to the Hills\n\nNo Prayer For The Dying\n\nBe quick or be dead\n\nStranger in a strange land\n\nNumber of the Beast\n\nInfinite Dreams\n\nIron Maiden\n\nAces High\n\nAlexander the Great\n\nOnly the good die young\n\nAces High\n\n2 Minutes to Midnight\n\nWrathchild\n\nChildren of the Damned\n\nPhantom of the Opera\n\nThe Trooper\n\nEl Dorado\n\nCan I Play With Madness\n\nRime of the Ancient Mariner\n\nBlood Brothers\n\nRun to the Hills\n\nWasted Years\n\nDance of Death\n\nFear of the Dark\n\nIron Maiden\n\n------\n\nThe Number of the Beast\n\nThe Evil That Men Do\n\nHallowed Be Thy Name\n\nBasically I see the \"FINAL TOUR\" as a revamped Somewhere Back In Time Tour showcasing their greatest hits from their heyday in the 1980s and adding some newer hits from the 2000s and 2010s (Blood Brothers, Dance of Death, and El Dorado). I thought of putting The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg where Rime currently is but I thought it would be awesome that if they did do a final greatest hits tour, how fitting it would be to include their longest and most epic song? So that's what I think the TOP 18 GREATEST MAIDEN HITS would be. Wish I could have added more from NPFTD or AMOLAD. But who knows, maybe their final setlist will look like this or be totally different. Plus with rumors of a NEW Maiden album coming next year, we might see a couple new hits on the way.\n\nI'd love to see them do a whole evening of Maiden as a final tour. No support. Maybe a 20 minute docu screened at the start, fast paced for a live audience, plenty of humour and live footage through the years. Then two sets, the first post-reunion, an interval with a mix of intro music through the years played, then a second set of old stuff. Maybe an hour on stage for the first set, 20 minute interval, and an hour and a quarter for the second set.\n\nAs for the set lists though... I've tried a few but none work. Tougher than it seems!\n\nI'd love to see them do a whole evening of Maiden as a final tour. No support.

Tougher than it seems!\n\nThat's an awesome idea. Similar to what Dream Theater does, and more than a fitting farewell to the fans. As you said, this is REALLY hard, especially not taking into account any new material before this tour happens...\n\nSet 1:\n\n01. The Wicker Man\n\n02. Futureal\n\n03. These Colours Don't Run\n\n04. Paschendale\n\n05. Brave New World\n\n06. The Final Frontier\n\n07. Sign of the Cross\n\n08. Brighter Than a Thousand Suns\n\n09. Rainmaker\n\n10. When the Wild Wind Blows\n\nSet 2:\n\n11. Aces High\n\n12. Tail Gunner\n\n13. Phantom of the Opera\n\n14. Wasted Years\n\n15. Stranger in a Strange Land\n\n16. The Evil That Men Do\n\n17. The Clairvoyant\n\n18. The Trooper\n\n19. Wrathchild\n\n20. Murders in the Rue Morgue\n\n21. Powerslave\n\n22. Fear of the Dark\n\n23. 2 Minutes to Midnight\n\n24. Iron Maiden\n\n-----\n\n25. Run to the Hills\n\n26. Hallowed Be Thy Name\n\nThat still puts them playing about 2 1/2 hours...but, I just couldn't cut it down any more. Seems pretty realistic for a farewell tour, with a few nuggets thrown in.\n\nI'm gonna try:\n\n01. Aces High\n\n02. Wrathchild\n\n03. Stranger In A Strange Land\n\n04. The Talisman\n\n05. The Trooper\n\n06. Dance Of Death\n\n07. The Number Of The Beast\n\n08. The Reincarnation Of Benjamin Breeg\n\n09. The Evil That Men Do\n\n10. Man On The Edge\n\n11. Brave New World\n\n12. Phantom Of The Opera\n\n-intermission-\n\n13. Sign Of The Cross\n\n14. 2 Minutes To Midnight\n\n15. Coming Home\n\n16. The Clansman\n\n17. Where Eagles Dare\n\n18. Afraid To Shoot Strangers\n\n19. Run To The Hills\n\n20. Paschendale\n\n21. Wasted Years\n\n22. No Prayer For The Dying\n\n23. Murders In The Rue Morgue\n\n24. Fear Of The Dark\n\n25. Iron Maiden\n\n-encore 1-\n\n26. The Wicker Man\n\n27. Bring Your Daughter To The Slaughter\n\n28. Hallowed Be Thy Name\n\n-encore 2-\n\n29. Alexander The Great\n\nTried to be realistic in terms of the songs I picked, but ofc they'll never play a concert this long\n\nI'm gonna try:\n\n01. Aces High\n\n02. Wrathchild\n\n03. Stranger In A Strange Land\n\n04. The Talisman\n\n05. The Trooper\n\n06. Dance Of Death\n\n07. The Number Of The Beast\n\n08. The Reincarnation Of Benjamin Breeg\n\n09. The Evil That Men Do\n\n10. Man On The Edge\n\n11. Brave New World\n\n12. Phantom Of The Opera\n\n-intermission-\n\n13. Sign Of The Cross\n\n14. 2 Minutes To Midnight\n\n15. Coming Home\n\n16. The Clansman\n\n17. Where Eagles Dare\n\n18. Afraid To Shoot Strangers\n\n19. Run To The Hills\n\n20. Paschendale\n\n21. Wasted Years\n\n22. No Prayer For The Dying\n\n23. Murders In The Rue Morgue\n\n24.

Alexander The Great\n\nTried to be realistic in terms of the songs I picked, but ofc they'll never play a concert this long\n\nThey play 28 songs on their last ever night, the crowd roars and they step back on for a second encore... Bruce announces \"Alexander The Great\", the crowd go ape, Bruce gets out his kazoo and the other five leave the stage, laughing."
