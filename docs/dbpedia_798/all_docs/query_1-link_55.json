        "text": "Love Is Blind fans faithfully tuned in on Sunday, April 16 for the live reunion of season 4, but they were met with error messages and livestream issues. The special, which was the streaming service's second live event after Chris Rock's Selective Outrage standup show last month, was delayed from its scheduled 8 p.m. ET start time for hours. Several subscribers were able to stream the reunion through a glitch in the system, while others remained unable to access the footage.\n\nEventually, Netflix announced that the reunion would be available globally at 12 p.m. PT on Monday, April 17, in a tweet late Sunday night.\n\nET was able to stream the reunion special's bombshell moments and also got exclusive access to the stars moments after it taped, getting their candid reactions to the drama that unfolded.\n\nWhile the chaos was going down live on Sunday, co-host Vanessa Lachey went live on her Instagram to share that the reunion had not started as they waited for a fix, assuring fans, \"This is so 2023. I can't show the season 4 cast, but Nick and I and the audience is all here. We are sitting here. Apparently y'all, everybody broke the internet to see this reunion! So we're ready to roll. We just gotta figure this out. We're getting everything to work. We are not asking any questions to anybody until we are streaming live into your living rooms, onto your phones, onto your tablets or whatever you're watching on. I promise we will save all of the tea for you.\"\n\nShortly after ET learned the Love is Blind reunion would be pre-recorded and intended to be posted to Netflix later Sunday evening. The official watch party at The Vermont in Los Angeles, which many of the show's former cast members attended and live streamed, was the only venue to see the special live.\n\nA recording began and shut off on the streaming service, featuring Vanessa saying that the reunion was no longer live due to the delays. She also revealed that Jackie Bonds and Josh Demas would not be in attendance, but that they had recorded an interview with the Lacheys to be featured later in the special.\n\nNetflix tweeted out at 9:29 p.m. ET: \"To everyone who stayed up late, woke up early, gave up their Sunday afternoonâ€¦ we are incredibly sorry that the Love is Blind Live Reunion did not turn out as we had planned. We're filming it now and we'll have it on Netflix as soon as humanly possible. Again, thank you and sorry.\"\n\nThe official Love Is Blind account shared a post writing, \"Love is late. It will be worth it.\"\n\nThe account also gave fans a teaser at some of the cast's reunion ensembles for the big event. Those shown in attendance included Chelsea Griffin, Paul Peden, Micah Lussier, Kwame Appiah, Zack Goytowski, Bliss Poureetezadi, Tiffany Pennywell, Brett Brown, and Irina Solomonova.\n\nAhead of the reunion, ET spoke with this season's cast and got answers on their present-day relationship statuses and what happened after the altar.\n\nLove Is Blind season 4 is currently streaming on Netflix."
