        "text": "An in-depth look at the Band discography, with interviews and both album and song reviews.\n\nIncluded are seven albums from the legendary original lineup featuring Robbie Robertson, among them Music from Big Pink and The Last Waltz; a trio of reunion-era recordings from the core remaining trio of Rick Danko, Levon Helm and Garth Hudson after Richard Manuel‘s tragic death; as well as key solo moments from the individual members like the terrific self-titled debuts by Danko and Robertson, and Helm’s rollicking valedictory Ramble at the Ryman, among others.\n\nClick through for expanded information on the Band discography …\n\nTHE BAND, ‘MUSIC FROM BIG PINK’ (1968)\n\nRick Danko, Levon Helm, Garth Hudson, Richard Manuel and Robbie Robertson\n\nThe Band discography begins on July 1, 1968 with an album that grew out of loose collaborations with Bob Dylan, many of which were later explored more fully in ‘The Basement Tapes.’\n\nSong reviews:\n\n“Caledonia Mission”\n\n“Chest Fever”\n\n“In a Station”\n\n“I Shall Be Released”\n\n“Long Black Veil”\n\n“Lonesome Suzie”\n\n“Tears of Rage”\n\n“The Weight”\n\n“This Wheel’s On Fire”\n\n“To Kingdom Come”\n\n“We Can Talk”\n\nAlbum review: Exploring Deep Cuts From the Band’s ‘Music From Big Pink’\n\nTHE BAND, ‘THE BAND’ (1969)\n\nRick Danko, Levon Helm, Garth Hudson, Richard Manuel and Robbie Robertson\n\nThe Band’s self-titled platinum-selling follow up, released on September 22, 1969, is considered their masterpiece. “Up on Cripple Creek” reached the Top 30 as a single.\n\nSong reviews:\n\n“Across the Great Divide”\n\n“Jawbone”\n\n“Jemima Surrender”\n\n“King Harvest”\n\n“Look Out Cleveland”\n\n“Rag Mama Rag”\n\n“Rockin’ Chair”\n\n“The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down”\n\n“The Unfaithful Servant”\n\n“Up On Cripple Creek”\n\n“When You Awake”\n\n“Whispering Pines”\n\nAlbum review: Deep Cuts from the Band’s Self-Titled 1969 Masterpiece\n\nTHE BAND, ‘STAGE FRIGHT’ (1970)\n\nRick Danko, Levon Helm, Garth Hudson, Richard Manuel and Robbie Robertson\n\nThe Band discography continues with the often-overlooked ‘Stage Fright,’ which became their second – and last –\n\ngold-selling original album after its release on August 17, 1970.\n\nSong reviews:\n\n“All La Glory”\n\n“Daniel and the Sacred Harp”\n\n“Just Another Whistle Stop”\n\n“Stage Fright”\n\n“The Rumor”\n\n“Time to Kill”\n\n“Sleeping”\n\n“Strawberry Wine”\n\n“W.S. Walcott Medicine Show”\n\nAlbum review: Exploring Deep Cuts from the Band’s Underrated ‘Stage Fright’\n\nTHE BAND, ‘CAHOOTS’ (1971)\n\nRick Danko, Levon Helm, Garth Hudson, Richard Manuel and Robbie Robertson\n\nIssued on September 15, 1971 to mixed reviews, ‘Cahoots’ failed to crack the Top 20 in the U.S., becoming the Band’s last album of original material for four years. In the meantime, the Band discography continues with live sets, a covers album and collaborations.\n\nSong reviews:\n\n“4% Pantomime”\n\n“The River Hymn”\n\n“Thinking Out Loud”\n\n“When I Paint My Masterpiece”\n\nAlbum review: The Band’s Overlooked, Imperfect ‘Cahoots’ Held a Few Musical Treasures\n\nTHE BAND, ‘ROCK OF AGES’ (1972)\n\nRick Danko, Levon Helm, Garth Hudson, Richard Manuel and Robbie Robertson\n\nThe Band returned with a muscular No. 6 hit live recording on August 15, 1972. The shows, recorded from December 28 through December 31, 1971, were later reissued as ‘Live at the Academy of Music 1971.’\n\nSong reviews:\n\n“Don’t Do It”\n\n“Get Up Jake”\n\n“(I Don’t Want To) Hang Up My Rock ‘n’ Roll Shoes”\n\n“Loving You is Sweeter Than Ever”\n\nInterviews on The Band’s ‘Rock of Ages’:\n\nRobbie Robertson on a thrilling, unrehearsed New Year’s Eve set with Bob Dylan\n\nAlbum review: The Band – Live at the Academy of Music 1971\n\nTHE BAND, ‘MOONDOG MATINEE’ (1973)\n\nRick Danko, Levon Helm, Garth Hudson, Richard Manuel and Robbie Robertson\n\nThe Band discography’s lone all-covers album, this October 15, 1973 release continued their chart slide, only reaching No. 28. They’d return to work with early collaborator Bob Dylan thereafter.\n\nSong reviews:\n\n“Back to Memphis”\n\n“Mystery Train”\n\n“Saved”\n\n“Share Your Love (With Me)”\n\n“The Great Pretender”\n\nAlbum review: Five Key Tracks from ‘Moondog Matinee’\n\nBOB DYLAN AND THE BAND, ‘PLANET WAVES’ (1974)\n\nRick Danko, Bob Dylan, Levon Helm, Garth Hudson, Richard Manuel and Robbie Robertson\n\nA No. 1 smash upon arrival on January 17, 1974, this next item in the Band discography was delayed for a couple of weeks when Dylan decided to change its original title, ‘Ceremonies of the Horsemen.’\n\nSong reviews:\n\n“Forever Young”\n\n“Going Going Gone”\n\n“On a Night Like This”\n\n“Something There Is About You”\n\nBOB DYLAN AND THE BAND, ‘BEFORE THE FLOOD’ (1974)\n\nRick Danko, Bob Dylan, Levon Helm, Garth Hudson, Richard Manuel and Robbie Robertson\n\nA document of the roaring reunion tour that actually began before ‘Planet Waves’ even arrived.

Another Bob Dylan collaboration, released June 16, 1975, sent the Band back to the Top 10.\n\nSong reviews:\n\n“Ain’t No More Cane”\n\n“Bessie Smith”\n\n“Clothes Line Saga”\n\n“Don’t Ya Tell Henry”\n\n“Dress It Up, Better Have It All”\n\n“Katie’s Been Gone”\n\n“Lo and Behold”\n\n“Odds and Ends”\n\n“Orange Juice Blues”\n\n“Yazoo Street Scandal”\n\nInterviews on The Band’s ‘The Basement Tapes’:\n\nGarth Hudson on the Band’s Influences, ‘Basement Tapes,’ Tragic Losses\n\nThe Band’s Garth Hudson on Why ‘The Basement Tapes’ Are Still ‘Special and Treasured’\n\nAlbum reviews: Bob Dylan and the Band – The Basement Tapes Complete: The Bootleg Series, Vol. 11\n\nBob Dylan Found Refuge, Artistic Rebirth with the Band on ‘The Basement Tapes’\n\nTHE BAND, ‘ISLANDS’ (1977)\n\nRick Danko, Levon Helm, Garth Hudson, Richard Manuel and Robbie Robertson\n\nThe final release from the five-man edition of the Band arrived on March 15, 1977 as a collection of odds and ends – then promptly slumped to No. 64. Still, there were a few moments worth celebrating.\n\nSong reviews:\n\n“Ain’t That a Lot of Love”\n\n“Christmas Must Be Tonight”\n\n“Let the Night Fall”\n\n“Livin’ In a Dream”\n\nRICK DANKO, ‘RICK DANKO’ (1977)\n\nRick Danko, with Eric Clapton, Levon Helm, Garth Hudson, Richard Manuel, Robbie Robertson, Ronnie Wood and others\n\nThe first solo album in the Band discography was also Rick Danko’s only full-length, non-collaborative studio effort.

Filled with a slew of great guests, it was worth the wait.\n\nSong reviews:\n\n“Evangeline”\n\n“The Well”\n\nInterviews on The Band’s ‘Last Waltz’:\n\nProducer John Simon on the Band, Fixing ‘The Last Waltz’ and Taking Credit\n\nMavis Staples goes behind the scenes at the Band’s ‘Last Waltz’\n\nThe Band’s ‘Last Waltz’ was nearly derailed, time and again\n\nThe Band’s Robbie Robertson discusses the conflict on Thanksgiving for native peoples\n\nLEVON HELM, ‘AMERICAN SON’ (1980)\n\nLevon Helm, with Buddy Emmons, Jerry Carrigan, Hargus “Pig” Robbins and others\n\nA typically forgotten project in the Band discography that grew out of soundtrack work for the Loretta Lynn biopic ‘Coal Miner’s Daughter,’ in which Helm played the country star’s father.\n\nSong reviews:\n\n“Dance Me Down Easy”\n\n“Hurricane”\n\nLEVON HELM, ‘LEVON HELM’ (1982)\n\nLevon Helm, Donald “Duck” Dunn and Steve Cropper of Booker T. and the MGs, among others\n\nWhen this second all-star, self-titled studio release failed to hit, Levon Helm began to focus more intently on movie work. He didn’t have add another item to the Band discography until 2007’s ‘Dirt Farmer.’\n\nSong review:\n\n“Even a Fool Would Let Go”\n\nROBBIE ROBERTSON, ‘ROBBIE ROBERTSON’ (1987)\n\nRobbie Robertson, with Rick Danko, Garth Hudson, Peter Gabriel, U2, Terry Bozzio, Tony Levin, Manu Katche and others\n\nA Top 40 comeback released on October 27, 1987, Robbie Robertson’s long-awaited solo debut was produced by Daniel Lanois, who was also working with guest stars U2 and Peter Gabriel on ‘Joshua Tree’ and ‘So,’ respectively.\n\nSong reviews:\n\n“Broken Arrow”\n\n“Fallen Angel”\n\n“Sonny Got Caught in the Moonlight”\n\nRICK DANKO, ‘RINGO STARR AND HIS ALL-STARR BAND’ (1990)\n\nRick Danko, Levon Helm, Ringo Starr, Dr. John, Joe Walsh, Billy Preston, others\n\nRingo Starr’s first official live album was also the first recorded under his then-new All-Starr Band banner.
