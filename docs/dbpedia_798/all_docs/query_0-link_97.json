        "text": "In many ways, Pet Sounds is the solo work of band leader Brian Wilson. Not only was this a blueprint for later conceptual albums, but it was also a major experiment for The Beach Boys. After this progressive journey that included some unique accompaniment, the band was no longer considered a full-blown pop group — for better or worse. “Wouldn’t it Be Nice,” “Sloop John B,” and “God Only Knows\" remain some of the best songs of all time.\n\nOften regarded as the gold standard for concept records, Sgt. Peppers represents the Fab Four's maturity as songwriters and composers. The rousing closer, “A Day in the Life,” is an example of that mature pop sound, while the trippy “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds” is as conceptual as they come. Ringo Starr's “With a Little Help from My Friends” adds to the polished, sing-a-long feel of the album.\n\nThis Kinks progressive gem should be considered one of the band's most underrated efforts within their stellar catalog. Critics lauded the project about Ray Davies' tribute to the days of old in England. There is also a healthy blues influence on the record, especially the track “Last of the Steam Powered Trains.\"\n\nThe Who put out two of the best concept albums ever made, and though critics and fans will argue as to which is better, there's no doubt Tommy received more acclaim. The story of the \"deaf, dumb and blind kid, (who) sure plays a mean pinball\" and his friends, the Pinball Wizard and the Acid Queen, is also one of the most iconic records of all time. The band's breakthrough effort led to movie and stage versions of the stellar rock opera.\n\nThis Gaye classic features only nine songs, but the overall synergistic flow of the album is what makes it special. Classics like the title song and “Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)\" are the backbone of a release that is among the most socially conscious efforts in music history.\n\nThe best part about Tull's most recognizable piece is that it's a conceptual project making fun of concept albums. The record is one continuous song (ultimately edited for radio play), divided into two parts, and, when listening to it on vinyl, it spans both sides of the record. The brilliance of leader Ian Anderson, Brick is a poem from the fictional young boy Gerald Bostock. It's also the epitome of '70s progressive rock.\n\nAnother case for whether an album is truly conceptual from the textbook sense. Still, the story of Bowie's androgynous alter ego from another world is conceptual enough, but also perhaps the most influential glam rock album in music history. Highlighted by the super-charged \"Suffragette City,\" the record not only made the legendary artist a star but also opened the door for a glam movement that touched everybody from the New York Dolls to Van Halen.\n\nAgain, there's some gray area as to whether to consider Desperado a concept album regarding a linear storyline. For the sake of this list, it works. The Eagles take a trip through the Old West with what should be considered its most ambitious project and one truly fitting for a band of great \"outlaw\" songwriters. The popular title cut and \"Tequila Sunrise\" stand out.\n\nWhile Tommy drew mass appeal, The Who's other well-regarded concept album might be a better overall piece of work in terms of writing and composition. Led by \"Real Me” and “Love, Reign o’er Me,\" Quadrophenia was the brainchild of guitarist Pete Townshend and told the tale of a young mod trying to fit into 1960s London. The band sometimes shed its pop side on this album, and it worked.\n\nWord is, ELO leader Jeff Lynne had been toying with the idea of a concept piece for some time. He finally made it happen with this masterful fantasy tale through dreams to escape a disillusioned world. Critics quickly pointed out The Beatles' influence on the record. The project's centerpiece remains one of the group's biggest hits in \"Can't Get It Out of My Head.\"\n\nThis was singer Peter Gabriel's swan song with the band, but he certainly left his mark. Genesis became a household name with this album about a boy taking in all that New York City has to offer. While the making of the record wasn't easy for Gabriel and the rest of the group, it still stands up well from a lyrical, musical, and production standpoint. The title cut is an epic example of that.\n\nNot all hardcore Rush fans consider this a true concept album, but it has the feel and flow of one. That's good enough for us, and most fans agree it's a true listening experience. The seven-part title track opus is a futuristic ride that might be the band's most ambitious work within its stellar catalog. As usual, the brilliance of drummer Neil Peart, who wrote most of the lyrics, is evident.\n\nZappa's three-act concept gem was certainly before its time. Some fans and music critics were not ready for it. His edgy and raw story about a place where music was not allowed would be accepted and praised today. Regardless of the period, this Zappa album has stood the time test.\n\nThe Floyd has always been a progressive and conceptual rock band, but this album was especially bombastic and grandiose. This semi-autobiographical work of bassist and leader Roger Waters let rock fans know that \"we don't need no education\" while also dealing with family loss and being a burned-out rock star looking to reinvent himself. It's also responsible for one of the band's greatest songs, \"Comfortably Numb.\" Fellow musician Bob Geldof played the lead role in the movie version, and Waters still tours on the album.\n\nPerhaps metal's best storytelling band, Maiden has always seemed a bit progressive. They took it to the hilt with this late 1980s effort that delved into the world of folklore. Though the album received a hit-or-miss response from die-hard Iron Maiden supporters, songs like “The Evil That Men Do” and “The Clairvoyant\" are some of the band's best work.\n\nArguably metal/hard rock's most commercially well-known concept album. While hair bands were dominating the Sunset Strip and MTV, these Seattle rockers were showing off their originality, creativity, and quality musicianship behind a dark tale involving a recovering addict sucked into a revolutionary organization. Geoff Tate's vocal range adds even more punch to the project, which produced Queensrÿche staples “Eyes of a Stranger” and “I Don’t Believe in Love.”\n\nNIN's mainstream breakthrough is brilliant on many levels. The way Trent Reznor is able to weave his self-destruction and personal demons into a pop-fueled experience worthy of MTV is perhaps most impressive. \"Closer\" brings the listener in, while the haunting \"Hurt\" almost has us feeling Reznor's emotional and physical pain. Thanks to its overall production value, The Downward Spiral is up there as one of the best overall records of the 1990s.\n\nOne of the more creative and unique conceptual listening experiences can be found on what should be considered QOTSA's best project. The album follows a drive through the California desert, interspersed with radio bits and talking DJs as if the listener was also riding along with the band. The hard-charging \"No One Knows\" is perhaps the group's most notable song. Dave Grohl played drums, while Dean Ween also offered his services to the album.\n\nGreen Day was an accepted pop-punk machine well before releasing American Idiot, but this record and the subsequent stage play that followed turned Billie Jo and Co. into mainstream giants. It's the band's most mature work, attacking a questionable U.S. government and calling out the overall dysfunction of the country. Fueled by the title track, “Boulevard of Broken Dreams,” Holiday,” and “Wake Me Up When September Ends,” the album sold 16 million copies and won the Grammy for Best Rock Album.\n\nOver a three-year stretch, the multi-talented and versatile Stevens wrote two albums about states (there was 2003's Michigan). The second was this piece of brilliance that topped many \"Best of 2005\" lists. It's almost like a musical road trip or history lesson of Illinois, complete with memorable tracks on state-associated topics like \"John Wayne Gacy, Jr.\" and \"Casimir Pulaski Day.\"\n\nThese New Jersey emo rockers hit it out of the park with their third studio effort. One of the best albums of 2006, The Black Parade tells the story of a terminal cancer patient taking stock in the life that's left and preparing for what is after. Highlighted by the magnitude of singer Gerard Way's dramatic voice, the bombastic title track should go down as the band's signature song.\n\nTaken from the movie of the same name, Jay went to No.1 with an album about getting rich for all the wrong reasons. As usual, the record is exceptionally produced to the point that any music fan can probably appreciate the greatness that comes across from an artist who needed a professional jolt at the time. \"Blue Magic\" captures the album's overall theme.\n\nThe exceptional storytelling is prominently displayed on this Arcade Fire album that can be debated for its place in the traditional concept album world. Whatever side one might be on, all should agree that the lyrics work like a well-written novel about the upbringing of bandmates Win and Will Butler in Houston. The Suburbs won the Grammy for Album of the Year and is highlighted by the stellar \"Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains).\"\n\nNot only is this one of the best concept albums of all time, but it's also perhaps up there among the overall great rap projects. It was Lamar's debut on a major label and offered a raw, unabashed, and uncensored view of his time growing up in Compton. Thanks to the Dr. Dre-helped hits \"The Recipe” and “Backseat Freestyle,\" the album earned multiple Grammy nominations.\n\nBeyonce's most creative work, arguably her best, is a personal album that features plenty of emotion while also delivering a variety of sounds. From hip-hop to reggae to gospel, \"Lemonade\" is a wonderful musical ride through the superstar's life in many ways, and \"Formation\" should be within the top five of her catalog.\n\nDepending on who one listens to, Dirty Computer is a prequel to Monáe's storyline of the messianic android Cindi Mayweather from her first two albums The ArchAndroid (2010) and The Electric Lady (2013). According to Monáe, this was a more personal record, as opposed to creating an alter-ego of sorts, to convey her feelings and experiences. The concept of the album is also broken down into three parts -- \"Reckoning,\" \"Celebration\" and \"Reclamation.\" Paced by the popular \"Make Me Feel\" and empowering \"Django Jane,\" Dirty Computer reached No. 6 on the Billboard 200 in the U.S.\n\nRocky relationships tend to make for good lyrical fodder. In the case of the Spaniard's second studio release, it resulted one of the best records of the century. She wrote the entire album, which was reportedly influenced by a 13th-century, southern European novel Flamenca. Rosalía staged the recording as chapters in a book, which superbly showed off, seemingly how easy, she could pull something that complex for a young artist. Though the record was a hit with fans of Latin music, it also enjoyed viral mainstream crossover recognition. Thanks to singles \"Malamente,\" \"Pienso en tu mirá\" and the underrated \"Bagdad.\" The album won the Grammy for Best Latin Rock, Urban or Alternative Album\n\nThe follow-up to 2019's Map of the Soul: Persona, which has strong in its own right. However, 7, the band's fourth straight album to debut at No. 1 on Billboard 200, truly shows a mature side of the beloved K-poppers, who consider this to be their most personal album. It chronicles the seven years since the band's debut, and all the feelings and experiences that shaped them to that point. Sure, there is plenty of pop and hip hop to entertaining, but the band also worked with Ed Sheeran (who co-wrote \"Make it Right\" from the album), among other notable artists to deliver, what's arguably, their most complete record -- musically, lyrically and emotionally. Peaking at No. 4, the single \"On\" was a BTS first to crack the top five on the Hot 100.\n\nMore from Lamar, who've noted already on this list, has delivered some remarkable material over the years. His most recent offering was a Grammy-winning conceptual project that tales Lamar's post-therapy soul-searching. According to Esquire, the Mr. Morale portion of the album represents \"the moral clarity of the Conscience\" of a Black man at this point in time in the U.S. It's reportedly in reference to Lamar's new persona -- in the wake of some personal growth. Meanwhile, the Big Steppers are \"the moral corruption of the Culture.\" Together, the back-and-forth makes for another fantastic record. \"N95\" remains the star of this collection.\n\nIt took some time for Beyoncé to release a follow-up to the aforementioned Lemonade. However, as far as her fans are concerned, it was well worth the wait. She wrote a rather optimistic record with Renaissance. Written during the heart of the COVID-19 pandemic, Beyoncé was looking for a method of escapism to give her fans, and conceptually, the tracks are arranged from the standpoint of a club DJ offering such an outlet for those in the house. Filled with messages of self-belief and perseverance, Renaissance was Beyoncé's seventh straight album to debut at No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100. \"Cuff It,\" the second single from the record, earned a Grammy nomination for Best R&B Song."
