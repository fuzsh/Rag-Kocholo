Vox, Eyes of Perdition, Coma Cluster Void)\n\nInstagram: @lindsayovox\n\nDeftones – Diamond Eyes\n\nThe sixth studio album from Sacramento’s Deftones, Diamondeyes proved to be a chapter-turning release for the band, as they refined their quiet/loud dynamic in highly emotive, and at times down-right sexy (here’s looking at you, “You’ve Seen the Butcher”) tracks. Diamond Eyes furnishes a truly lush soundscape as much as calls up the band’s 90s alterna-metal roots, while opening up the decade for the band’s ambitious subsequent efforts to follow.\n\nVermin Womb – Permanence\n\nVermin Womb’s 2014 debut, Permanence, is the stuff of the human id, where all things raw and primal are channeled through dissonant, Blackened Death Grind that just gets inside of you and loosens all higher-order thinking. The result: six truly upsetting tunes from onslaught to finish.\n\nKhemmis – Absolution\n\n“Ash, Cinder, Smoke,” the second track on Khemmis’ 2015 debut, Absolution, possibly best captures the essence of this album: classic Progressive Rock/Metal underscores soaring melodies and vocalist Phil Pendergast’s pitch-perfect choruses. The entire album, however, is deeply effective, honest, and without hyperbole – it’s a standout debut from a band that quickly thereafter gained immense and well-deserved praise.\n\nConverge – All We Love We Leave Behind\n\nManic, emotive, self-aware, kinetic – everything we love about Boston’s Converge coalesces on All We Love We Leave Behind. The spirit of this release is one of maturity – that of the band and that of the hardcore genre itself. AWLWLB is a reflection on the rage of youth and what you take with you into new epochs of life. In the case of Converge, not a drop of aggression is wasted or “left behind–” it’s simply refined and then again amplified through innovative and thoroughly cathartic tunes.\n\nBell Witch – Mirror Reaper\n\nA single, 83-minute track, Mirror Reaper resounds in its quiet moments as much as it does in its loud ones, and both are equal in abundance. Every note carries dramatic heaves of contemplative, mournful Doom; every breath between the phrases carries spectacular revelation. It’s the interplay of internalization and relief that makes Mirror Reaper toe the line between life and death very closely – tread carefully.\n\nThe Faceless – Autotheism\n\nWith a touch of the dramatic, Autotheism from The Faceless touches corners of the psyche that are a little frayed, but rife with genius – much like band leader Michael Keene. Favorite track: “Movement I: Create,” where Keene’s voice is captured in beautiful narration, as angular riffs spin tangled webs that lead to a precarious inner world rife with self-realization (“I am God…”). Autotheism is a universe Keene has architectured to exorcise many demons, while aurally inviting in so many more.\n\nMaruta – Remain Dystopian\n\nHorrifically underrated, Maruta’s Remain Dystopian is a feather in the Death Grind cap at a time when things were becoming a little predictable. The album braids mega-stellar riff after mega-stellar riff into songs that are interesting and meaningful. The world on this album may be a battered one, but the music presented here is just so finely done that you’ll at least have something killer to listen to as you watch the world burn.\n\nMeshuggah – The Violent Sleep of Reason\n\nViolent Sleep of Reason synthesizes Meshuggah’s nearly 30 year, meticulous study of dissonance and poly-rhythms into explosive yet characteristically precise and well-architectured songs. The album collects, refines, then highlights everything I personally love about the band’s journey: Frederick Thordendal’s jazzy, inter-dimensional interludes from Contradictions Collapse; the aggressive, atonal beat down of Chaosphere; the abysmal, heady opus of Catch-33; the decipherable and unequivocal aggression of Obzen. The band is slated for a new album in 2020, which means we can look forward to yet another decade of schooling from the Swedish maestros.\n\nArtificial Brain – Infrared Horizon\n\nInfrared Horizon is breathless, furious, and yet so moving. Artificial Brain is heralded for their creative combination of subgenres (“old school” 90s DM, Black Metal, Grind, Progressive Metal, and so on), but what is most impressive about them is the bleak, introspective atmosphere that simply carries effortlessly through their music. And it’s this ambiance that elevates Infrared Horizon from being a mere melange of styles into a showcase of superior instrumentation that breathes, feels, and lives a life of its own.\n\nThe Contortionist – Language\n\nI’ve often used the word “beautiful” to describe moments in Metal that dare to be moving and introspective, honest or vulnerable. But in the case of Language by The Contortionist, the music transcends all superficial adjectives, as it takes you into a new level of consciousness. This is, of course, in no small part due to Michael Lessard’s remarkable voice, which can soothe and color, as much as it can brutally pummel. Language is the band’s learned presentation of Progressive Metal in the 21st century, and its an album that will assuredly dignify The Contortionist in the eyes and ears of open-minded Metal fans for generations to come.\n\nElder – Lore\n\nPsyche-Rock, Progressive Metal, Doom…whatever you want to call it, Lore from Elder is a guitar-guided, ambiance-focused album that just fucking rocks. The Massachusetts trio knows when to drive ahead with pulsing riffs and when to let the proverbial kite fly into the wind on the album. As well-done as Lore is, the album, to me, signifies freedom, and is no tightly wound, noodly Prog-Rock scheme. It drives you, and it teaches you to let go of the reigns once in a while to usher in a whole new era of possibilities.\n\nOther Standouts\n\nPeriphery – Periphery II: This Time It’s Personal\n\nEvery Time I Die – Low Teens\n\nThe Dillinger Escape Plan – One Of Us Is the Killer\n\nCarcass – Surgical Steel\n\nGojira -‘L’Enfant Sauvage\n\nPower Trip – Nightmare Logic"
