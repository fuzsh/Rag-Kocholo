        "text": "An insider history of the Blind Boys of Alabama, the longest running group in American music, and the untold story of their world, written with band members and key musical colleagues, drawing from the group’s private archive.\n\nThought-provoking, heartfelt, and deeply inspiring, Spirit of the Century is a fascinating and one-of-a-kind read that you won't be able to put down.\n\nToday, the Blind Boys of Alabama have returned with ‘Echoes Of The South’- their first new album in six years - which signals a homecoming for the Gospel Music Hall of Fame inductees, and a declaration of their tenacity over the span of 80 years. The eleven-song collection is a portrait of perseverance from a group well-versed in overcoming incredible odds - from singing for pocket change in the Jim Crow South, to performing for three different American presidents, soundtracking the Civil Rights movement and helping to define - and redefine - modern gospel music as we know it. The group has reckoned with the loss of two of their own in the lead up to ‘Echoes Of The South’, Paul Beasley and Benjamin Moore, both longtime members of the Blind Boys’ tight-knit family. 'Echoes Of The South' is released in their honor, continuing their spirit of resilience and marking their pledge to keep on singing.\n\nBlind Boys of Alabama have returned today to unveil the closing track from their upcoming album Echoes Of The South, coming September 8 on Single Lock Records. A reimagining of Stevie Wonder’s “Heaven Help Us All” (originally penned by Ron Miller), the five-time GRAMMY-winners bring their iconic and unmistakable vocal stylings to this chart-topping classic from one of their multi-time collaborators. With its focus on empathy and compassion in the face of calamity, “Heaven Help Us All” was first released in 1970 but feels more relevant than ever today; a rallying cry against war, racism and gun violence through the powers of light and love.\n\nListen to the latest single from the forthcoming Blind Boys of Alabama album, Echoes of the South, out September 8.\n\nBlind Boys of Alabama have shared “Work Until My Days Are Done,” which finds the five-time GRAMMY winners shifting between heart-wrenching doo-wop and a raucous, rafter-raising second half; recalling the group’s rich history “epitomizing a livelier breed of gospel” (New York Times). While the Blind Boys make this standard their own, the themes of “Work Until My Days Are Done” perfectly suit the group’s long-held mission statement: “as long as everybody gives all that they have to give and we sing songs that touch the heart, we'll live on forever.” That belief has taken on even deeper meaning recently, as they've reckoned with the loss of two of their own - Paul Beasley and Benjamin Moore - and they’ll release their first album in six years Echoes Of The South (Single Lock Records) on September 8 in their honor. “We lost two great champions in Ben and Paul,” reflects 91-year-old group leader Jimmy Carter. “But I know they would want the Blind Boys to keep on going.” Both the new album and song were co-produced by Matt Ross-Spang (Margo Price, John Prine), Ben Tanner (Alabama Shakes, Jason Isbell) and Charles Driebe.\n\nBlind Boys of Alabama will release Echoes Of The South, their first album in six years, on September 8.\n\nCo-produced by Matt Ross-Spang, Ben Tanner and Charles Driebe, Echoes Of The South was titled after Birmingham, Alabama radio station WSGN’s show that was the first to welcome the Blind Boys as guests. The 11-song Echoes Of The South was recorded in Sheffield, Alabama at The NuttHouse Recording Studio and marks the Blind Boys’ first full-length release for the Alabama-based independent label Single Lock Records.\n\nThe Blind Boys are excited to announce that they are releasing a collaborative limited edition 45 RPM 7” single with Béla Fleck on June 12, as part of Record Store Day on Single Lock Records!\n\nThe A-side is a cover \"I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free,\" the classic song made famous by Nina Simone. The B-side is the first physical release of “See By Faith,\" a previously unreleased song by Bob Dylan which was a bonus track for album Almost Home.\n\nThis release is available exclusively at your local participating record store on June 12! For a complete list of participating shops, visit recordstoreday.com\n\nThe Blind Boys of Alabama have signed to Alabama-based Single Lock Records, who widely released the band's critically acclaimed album Almost Home to all digital music platforms for the first time on August 28.\n\nTo celebrate the signing and the wide release, the Blind Boys made a bonus track from the Almost Home sessions at FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals — a previously unrecorded Bob Dylan song from his gospel period, “See By Faith” - available now on all major digital platforms! Click here to stream the album.\n\nThe Blind Boys are excited to announce that they have been nominated by the Recording Academy for 2017's 'Best American Roots Performance!' The nominated track, \"Let My Mother Live,\" was co-written by John Leventhal, Marc Cohn, and the Blind Boys' own Jimmy Carter. It includes an array of sentiments and stories behind Jimmy's relationship with his mother throughout his lifetime. Click the photo above to see the full list of GRAMMY nominations.\n\nNPR Music has written a rich summary of the Blind Boys' new album, Almost Home, in anticipation of its release on August 18.

We enjoyed benefiting God's Love, We Deliver by singing with our friends Jackson Browne and Michael McDonald (pictured above), as well as joining Aaron Neville to sing one of our favorite songs, People Get Ready. Its always a pleasure to be surrounded by so many talented artists, such as William Bell, Mavis Staples, Gary Clark Jr., Dr. John, Paul Schaffer, John Varvatos, and so many more. Thanks for Love Rocks NYC for inviting us to take part!\n\nThe Blind Boys of Alabama have contributed their version of the song \"Mother's Children Have A Hard Time\" to the album God Don’t Never Change: The Songs Of Blind Willie Johnson, which is being released by Alligator Records on February 26th. The track was recorded at the legendary FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, and was produced by fellow Alabaman Jason Isbell (who also contributed slide guitar to the track). The star-studded album (which includes Tom Waits, Lucinda Williams and many others) is being released on CD, vinyl and as a digital download. For more information, click the photo above."
