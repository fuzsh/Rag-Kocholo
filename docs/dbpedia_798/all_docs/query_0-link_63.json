        "text": "Iron Maiden's third studio album, released in March 1982, featured the debut of Bruce Dickinson on vocals. It racked up significant acclaim, hitting No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart and breaking into the top 40 on the US Billboard 200. With tracks like \"Run to the Hills\" and \"Hallowed Be Thy Name,\" it quickly became a heavy metal cornerstone. Produced by Martin Birch, its recording was plagued with strange happenings, including malfunctioning studio equipment and uncanny coincidences. The album's controversial themes sparked a backlash in the U.S., but this simply elevated Iron Maiden's mystique.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. \"Invaders\"\n\n2. \"Children of the Damned\"\n\n3. \"The Prisoner\"\n\n4. \"22 Acacia Avenue\"\n\n5. \"The Number of the Beast\"\n\n6. \"Run to the Hills\"\n\n7. \"Gangland\"\n\n8. \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\"\n\nIron Maiden's seventh studio album quickly climbed to No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart, earning gold and platinum certifications worldwide. With its hit singles \"Can I Play with Madness\" and \"The Evil That Men Do,\" it was a commercial and critical triumph. This concept album, inspired by Orson Scott Card's novel Seventh Son, examines mysticism and the supernatural; it also incorporates keyboards for the first time. Produced by Martin Birch and recorded in Germany's Musicland Studios, it was Adrian Smith's last appearance until 1999.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. \"Moonchild\"\n\n2. \"Infinite Dreams\"\n\n3. \"Can I Play with Madness\"\n\n4. \"The Evil That Men Do\"\n\n5. \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\"\n\n6. \"The Prophecy\"\n\n7. \"The Clairvoyant\"\n\n8. \"Only the Good Die Young\"\n\nIn 1986, Iron Maiden's sixth studio album hit No. 3 on the UK Albums Chart and earned platinum certification. Known for hits like \"Wasted Years\" and \"Stranger in a Strange Land,\" the record marked a shift for the band, exploring themes of time and space and making use of guitar synthesizers. Produced by Martin Birch and recorded across international studio locations, it was one of their most ambitious projects. Despite a grueling tour schedule and lineup tensions, Somewhere in Time received positive reviews and remains a fan favorite, often celebrated for its futuristic sound and intricate cover art.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. \"Caught Somewhere in Time\"\n\n2. \"Wasted Years\"\n\n3. \"Sea of Madness\"\n\n4. \"Heaven Can Wait\"\n\n5. \"The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\"\n\n6. \"Stranger in a Strange Land\"\n\n7. \"Deja-Vu\"\n\n8. \"Alexander the Great\"\n\nReleased in September 1984, Iron Maiden's fifth studio album has an ancient Egyptian theme and encapsulates the band's intense energy and creative prowess. Among its popular tracks are \"2 Minutes to Midnight\" and \"Aces High,\" both of which gained major popularity and airplay. Powerslave received critical acclaim, landing at No. 2 on the UK Albums Chart and earning Rolling Stoneâ€™s praise as one of the \"100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time.\" Produced by Martin Birch in the Bahamas and mixed in New York, its elaborate storytelling includes a musical adaptation of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. \"Aces High\"\n\n2. \"2 Minutes to Midnight\"\n\n3. \"Losfer Words (Big 'Orra)\" (instrumental)\n\n4. \"Flash of the Blade\"\n\n5. \"The Duellists\"\n\n6. \"Back in the Village\"\n\n7. \"Powerslave\"\n\n8. \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\"\n\nPiece of Mind, unveiled in May 1983, was Iron Maiden's fourth studio album and marked the debut of drummer Nicko McBrain. It rose to No. 3 on the UK Albums Chart and achieved platinum certification in the UK and US. Featuring tracks like \"The Trooper\" and \"Flight of Icarus,\" it drew inspiration from literature and film, including Frank Herbert's Dune and Tennyson's The Charge of the Light Brigade. Recorded in the Bahamas and mixed in New York, its production was peppered with quirks, including equipment malfunctions.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. \"Where Eagles Dare\"\n\n2. \"Revelations\"\n\n3. \"Flight of Icarus\"\n\n4. \"Die with Your Boots On\"\n\n5. \"The Trooper\"\n\n6. \"Still Life\"\n\n7. \"Quest for Fire\"\n\n8. \"Sun and Steel\"\n\n9. \"To Tame a Land\"\n\nThe 12th album from Iron Maiden featured the return of Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith, solidifying its lineup as a six-piece for the first time. Recording live at Guillaume Tell Studios in Paris with producer Kevin Shirley, it brought hits like \"The Wicker Man\" and \"Out of the Silent Planet\" into the metal lexicon. Brave New World reached No. 7 on the UK Albums Chart and debuted at No. 39 on the Billboard 200 in the US. Critics largely praised the band's revitalized energy, and a live performance of \"Blood Brothers\" later snagged a Grammy nomination.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. \"The Wicker Man\"\n\n2. \"Ghost of the Navigator\"\n\n3. \"Brave New World\"\n\n4. \"Blood Brothers\"\n\n5. \"The Mercenary\"\n\n6. \"Dream of Mirrors\"\n\n7. \"The Fallen Angel\"\n\n8. \"The Nomad\"\n\n9. \"Out of the Silent Planet\"\n\n10. \"The Thin Line Between Love and Hate\""
