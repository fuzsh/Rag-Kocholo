The eleven-song collection is a portrait of perseverance from a group well-versed in overcoming incredible odds - from singing for pocket change in the Jim Crow South, to performing for three different American presidents, soundtracking the Civil Rights movement and helping to define - and redefine - modern gospel music as we know it. The group has reckoned with the loss of two of their own in the lead up to ‘Echoes Of The South’, Paul Beasley and Benjamin Moore, both longtime members of the Blind Boys’ tight-knit family. 'Echoes Of The South' is released in their honor, continuing their spirit of resilience and marking their pledge to keep on singing.\n\nThe Blind Boys of Alabama open the album with lyrics embodying a long-held core value: by singing from the heart, and surrendering to the music, the group will continue to resonate across decades and generations; “Blind Boys of Alabama, you know, we’ve been around a long time, but the good news is we’re still here, singing and praising God.” This mission statement is also at the center of “This May Be The Last Time,” an uplifting short film about the group, which pays tribute to their history - through anecdotes full of wisdom from group members, and an inside look into making the new album in Muscle Shoals.\n\nWatch “This May Be The Last Time,” directed by Daniel Fox, which premieres at 1PM ET today: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VQWpWmHcJ0\n\nThe Blind Boys of Alabama have previewed 'Echoes of the South' with advance tracks including their version of the Pops Staples standard “Friendship,” which notably features the late Benjamin Moore and Paul Beasley splitting lead vocal duties, “Work Until My Days Are Done” - called an “instant classic” by American Songwriter, and a reimagining of Stevie Wonder’s chart-topping hit “Heaven Help Us All.” Across its eleven songs, ‘Echoes Of The South’ transcends genre and era, “displaying the Blind Boys of Alabama’s ability to blend gospel, soul, country, and rock into transcendent songs of faith and hope” (No Depression). The Blind Boys will continue to bring their life-affirming music and message across the globe, with a slate of North American tour dates announced into 2024 including shows coming up this month in Philadelphia (September 15), Boston (September 16) and New York City (September 18).\n\nListen to the full album ‘Echoes of the South’ here: https://link.singlelock.com/blindboys\n\n‘Echoes Of The South’ finds the Blind Boys returning to their roots; on the group’s first album fully made in their home state of Alabama, featuring a tracklist which draws on the music that's most inspired them throughout their careers: long-lost gospel classics, traditional spirituals and timeless R&B/soul cuts made famous by artists like Wonder, Pops Staples and Curtis Mayfield. Co-produced by Matt Ross-Spang (Margo Price, John Prine), Ben Tanner (Alabama Shakes, Jason Isbell) and Charles Driebe. The album is named for the first radio show that ever booked the Blind Boys as guests (out of WSGN in Birmingham), and the cover art features braille for the first time — two of the many personal touches that establish ‘Echoes Of The South’ as a \"homecoming\" in so many senses of the word.\n\n‘ECHOES OF THE SOUTH’ TRACKLIST\n\n1.
