        "text": "Reality television series have an incredibly hit-or-miss track record when it comes to producing viable music acts, especially bands made up of people who have only ever wanted to be solo artists. The 2010s struck gold with One Direction, Fifth Harmony, and Little Mix — all of which were products of The X Factor, and only one of which actually won their respective season. The 2000s had Making the Band, but Danity Kane’s “Damaged” is really the only good thing to have come out of that. Now, Netflix will take a stab at the build-a-band formula with its own music-based reality series, Building the Band.\n\nAccording to a synopsis for the show, Building the Band “seeks to discover the next great music group without bandmates initially meeting face-to-face.” The series will attempt to merge the traditional music competition format with that of Love Is Blind, bringing together 50 musicians tasked with collaborating without ever seeing each other in person.\n\n“All they have to go on is musical compatibility, connection, chemistry and merit. What will happen when the bands finally meet and… looks, choreography, and style come into play?” the synopsis teases. “Incredible performances, compelling drama and one big goal: find the next great music band.”\n\nAdditional details about the series, including its hosts and premiere date, will be announced at a later time. Building the Band will be produced by Remarkable Entertainment and Banijay UK with executive producers Cat Lawson, Alison Holloway, Katrina Morrison, and Clara Elliot.\n\nNetflix has also announced plans for a new reality series titled Selling the City, Battle Camp, Owning Manhattan, and Love Is Blind: UK. The streaming service has also renewed The Mole, Too Hot to Handle, and Perfect Match."
