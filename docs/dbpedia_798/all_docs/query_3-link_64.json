        "text": "Someone said “if you love Beer, Chicago and Rock n Roll, you will love this album”, two out of three works for me, not saying which, but I’m pretty sure the true of punk spirit can guess.\n\nThis is Blind Adam’s second outing into the world of the album, ‘An Act Of Desperation’ released on 10th September via A-F Records is the release in question.\n\nThe name Blind Adam and The Federal League definitely has sport connotations, which did put me off a little, sport and music is not something that sits well (personal choice), but when the only offering seems to be ‘There Was A Ball Game’ which holds a marching beat throughout and offers an anthemic feel to a song of reminiscence, I suppose it can’t all be bad.\n\n‘Drier Ground’ kicks off the main body of an album that has it’s roots in country/folk, a sing-a-long song that has a Dropkick Murphys sensibility about it. What Adam gives to you is a body of lyric and music that diversifies enough to keep things a lot more interesting than what on the surface could fall into a very deep pit of anthem filled woe, ‘Black Jean Jacket’ is a moment the listener gets the rawness of vocal that makes for a powerful Gaslight Anthem esque ballad, full of country licks that collide with rock guitar riffs, not long after we are given 42 seconds of ‘Is This A Nightmare Or A Joke?’ a revolutionary ode.\n\nNot only do we find ourselves fighting the fight against the wrongs in the world, delving deep into the depths emotional sadness, we also have enough time to take in broken hearts and the lone between the have and have nots.\n\n‘Tattoos Of Broken Hearts’ is one of these instances, if you say you didn’t get your foot tapping or head nodding along to this Rancid clad beauty, then you’re a liar.\n\nThis album is a journey, a mix of styles, a tipping your toe into what Rock n Roll really means, songs that bring a tear, songs that have you dancing stupidly and most of all leave you exhausted but happy. Which brings us to the end and the title track ‘An Act Of Desperation’ how can you not feel this song, how perfectly does this fit in the world today! An absolute song of its time, try listening and not having a feeling of hopelessness at where we are when it comes to giving compassion to our fellow human beings.\n\nMusic with a heart, music with a conscience, music that rocks its ass off! What more can you ask."
