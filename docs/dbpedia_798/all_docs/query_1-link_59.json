        "text": "“Love Is Blind” Season Six reunion is almost here. Netflix teased that the upcoming tell-all will be “unlike any other we’ve had in previous seasons.”\n\nOn Feb. 23, hosts Nick and Vanessa Lachey revealed the date and time of the reunion in a YouTube video filmed on the show’s set. In the clip, the couple read from a script and take notes to prepare for their sit down with the cast.\n\nVanessa Lachey lists some of the contestants fans can expect to see, like AD, Brittany, Clay, Jimmy and Chelsea.\n\n“There’s so much to ask. And America and the world will be watching,” Nick Lachey says, possibly a playful jab at contestant Matthew who frequently referenced being on camera during his time on the show.\n\n“You know who has the best questions?” Vanessa Lachey asks.\n\nThey both respond, in unison, “The fans!”\n\nVanessa Lachey then encourages the show's devoted fan base to share who they want to see make an appearance at the reunion and what questions they want to hear.\n\nWhen is the 'Love Is Blind' Season 6 reunion?\n\nThe “Love Is Blind” Season Six reunion will air on Netflix Wednesday, March 13 at 9 p.m. ET / 6 p.m. PT.\n\nWhat to expect from the reunion\n\nThe streaming giant said the Season Six reunion will be filmed in front of a live audience and feature special guests.\n\nSeason Four was also recorded with an audience in attendance and was supposed to be live until technical difficulties caused the show to be delayed for hours. Fans voiced their frustrations with funny memes on social media at the time. When the episode finally arrived, the reunion continued to generate of conversation on social media as viewers called out Nick and Vanessa Lachey for some “biased” questions. Vanessa Lachey also sparked backlash for asking the Season Four couples intimate questions about starting a family.\n\nFor Season Five, “Love Is Blind” opted to avoid another mishap and instead filmed in advance. Fans seemed less enthused to hear updates about the couples and Netflix skipped an “After the Altar” special for the cast.\n\nBut with major storylines in Season Six, like the love triangle between Jeramey, Sarah Ann and Laura and the explosive arguments between Chelsea and Jimmy, fans have been invested on social media and will surely want to know where the couples stand now.\n\nThe new fan element Vanessa Lachey announced will likely ensure that all of the dramatic moments from the season, such as the bean dip fiasco and Jess’s relationship with Jimmy, will be addressed in a few weeks."
