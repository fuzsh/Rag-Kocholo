        "text": "Justin Saladino — “Blind Faith”\n\nAmericana Highways is hosting this video premiere of Justin Saladino’s song “Blind Faith” from his recently released album, Honest Lies. Honest Lies was produced by Ariel Posen (The Brothers Landreth); engineered by Jean-Sébastien Chouinard and Phil Pelletier; mixed by Charles-Émile Beaudin; and mastered by Jonathan Kaspy.\n\nThe video was filmed by Zachary Saladino and Esther Shpigelman; edited by Zachary Saladino; engineered by Phil Pelletier and mixed by Charles-Émile Beaudin\n\nMusicians on the recording are Justin Saladino on vocals and guitar; Antoine Loiselle on guitar; Denis Paquin on drums and backing vocals; and Gabriel Forget on bass and backing vocals. Crisp bluesy vibes that grab you from the first electrified note. Let Justin’s music take you for a ride on a sunshine-y day in the cool breeze. “It’s been this way so long. Have I got it all wrong?”\n\nComing in hot off a big Montreal Jazz Fest show that weekend, the quartet got to the studio we recorded the album in on that Monday morning and banged out the first 3 songs from the album, Honest Lies, live off the floor. I usually feel nervous when doing these productions. It’s a lot of pressure to get “the take,” the songs were pretty new, and the day isn’t cheap but for some reason, on that particular day, I was calm, energized and ready to kick ass… I think that’s exactly what we did and how it came across. — Justin Saladino\n\nDiscover more of his music here: https://music.apple.com/us/album/honest-lies/1637776933\n\nFind our previous coverage here: Interview: Justin Saladino Plumbs Emotional Depths for “Honest Lies”"
