        "text": "Status: Married\n\nCome on, not since season one's Cameron Hamilton and Lauren Speed has an LIB pairing seem so meant to be! The oldest couple in the experiment—Tiffany was 36 and Brett was 37—exchanged vows, even though Brett had a sartorial emergency when his pants did not fit properly on their wedding day. (Shout out to seamstress Lucia, you're a real one!)\n\nSince filming wrapped, Tiffany and Brett moved to Portland and are still perfect! Phew!\n\nStatus: Didn't make it to wedding day\n\nFans watched with dismay as Jackie chose to give Josh Demas, the other man she connected with in the pods, a second chance, meeting up with him before ending her engagement to Marshall. However, during the reunion, Jackie set the record straight on the timeline of events. \"I broke up with Marshall before I met Josh at the coffee shop,\" she said. \"It looks like I'm a cheater. I am not a cheater.\"\n\nJackie then addressed the end of her relationship with Marshall, saying she \"can take accountability\" for her words and actions, but \"I hope that he would do the same. We just weren't meant to be.\" As for her romance with Josh? They were still dating and living together in After the Altar, released in September 2023.\n\nUnfortunately for Marshall, who was hoping for some closure with Jackie, he was unable to fully express his feelings to his former fiancé as she chose not to attend the live taping, conducting a pre-recorded interview with Nick and Vanessa Lachey. But in an interview with E!, Marshall revealed he briefly connected with fellow contestant Kacia after the show.\n\n\"We tried,\" Marshall explained, \"But I wanted to just distance myself from all of that from that experience. It was going to be difficult to try to make a relationship with Kacia.\"\n\nIn After the Altar, Marshall revealed he's been dating girlfriend Dr. Chay Barnes for one year and wants to spend forever with her. \"Chay is the perfect woman for me. She's the yin to my yang,\" he said. \"Opposites attract. She's quite literally my opposite and we mesh so well. That's what I love the most about her.\"\n\nStatus: Separated\n\nOpposites seemed to attract all season for this pair...until they got to the altar. Sensing Paul's hesitation, Micah asked him to give his answer first and it was a pass on marriage for Paul. \"I literally feel like a disaster,\" Micah said. \"If Paul would have wanted to marry me, I 100 percent would have said 'I do.'\"\n\nAt the reunion, Paul apologized for his comment in a confessional about not being able to see Micah as a mother. \"I think I phrased that really unfairly toward her,\" Paul explained. \"I think the better way to phrase that would be that I can't see us as parents.\"\n\nWhile the duo briefly reconciled after filming, they ultimately weren't able to make their relationship work, with Paul explaining they broke up for good when he visited Micah in Arizona.\n\nIn After the Altar, Paul revealed he is dating a new woman who enjoys traveling and his cooking skills.\n\nStatus: Married\n\nSure, they say love is blind, but occasionally it needs a little bit of time—or proposing to another woman—to realize you made the wrong choice. Which is what happened when Zack initially got engaged to Irina Solomonova, only for the couple to break up during their trip to Mexico. After asking Bliss for a second chance, the pair defied the odds (and Bliss' dad's wishes) and both said \"I do\" at the altar. (And, no, they did not sit it out, enjoying that all important first turn around the dance floor to Lee Ann Womack's \"I Hope You Dance,\" the song that bonded them in the pods.) After the finale aired, Zack shared a photo of the couple on Instagram with the caption \"Eternal Bliss.\"\n\nSince filming, Bliss revealed, Zack and her father have become \"best buds,\" one of the many reasons Vanessa predicted they would be the first Love Is Blind couple to have a baby.\n\nStatus: Sorry\n\nDeemed the villain of season four due to her mean girl antics in the pods and for the way she treated Zack before their breakup, an emotional Irina showed up to the reunion ready to take accountability for her behavior.\n\n\"My intention was never to hurt anyone,\" she said, \"but my impact did.\" Irina added that she had offered private apologies to the female cast members before addressing Zack.\n\n\"No one deserves to be treated like that,\" she told him. \"I completely belittled you and made you feel so small. I was going through a lot mentally. That does not mean that was an excuse to do that, but looking back, I'm sorry.\"\n\nAs for Zack and Bliss, the couple said they have \"100 percent\" forgiven Irina, though Bliss did reveal Irina sent her a direct message on Instagram while the pair was in Mexico, telling her she \"dodged a bullet.\"\n\nIrina has since been focusing on herself, sharing her one-year fitness transformation from July 2022 to July 2023. \"So proud of my body,\" she said. \"Making little choices that just help me feel better inside & out.\""
