These CDs represent just how good these events are.”\n\n~ Matt Kent\n\nUMR is proud to announce PETE TOWNSHEND LIVE > IN CONCERT 1985-2001 an expanded 14-CD box set and digital set featuring seven long-out-of-print live albums by Pete Townshend.\n\nNewly remastered by Jon Astley at Close To The Edge, the set gathers together for the first time all of the live solo recordings that were only available via Pete Townshend’s website, Eel Pie. All of the albums have been out of print for two decades.\n\nThe box set features expanded deluxe packaging in a CD-size hard slip case and tray with new art by longtime Townshend collaborator Richard Evans, including updated gatefold CD wallets, and a 28-page booklet with sleeve notes by Who and Townshend archivist Matt Kent, a new exclusive foreword by Pete Townshend, plus rare photos and memorabilia.\n\nThe live shows included in the box set are Pete Townshend’s Deep End live at Brixton Academy in London recorded on the 1st and 2nd November 1985 and featuring David Gilmour of Pink Floyd on guitar, a live full rendition of Pete’s album Psychoderelict and more recorded at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York, 7th August 1993 during Pete’s only full solo tour, an intimate show from The Fillmore in San Francisco on 30th April 1996 around the time of his first solo compilation album CoolWalkingSmoothTalkingStraightSmokingFireStoking, Pete returned to his old stomping ground for the first time in 30 years for a live show at the Shepherd’s Bush Empire, 9th November 1998; there are also two nights at London’s Sadler’s Wells Theatre, usually home to ballet and modern dance, presenting music from Life House. It was the only time a full Life House show has been attempted and the only time some of those songs were ever performed, and finally, two shows from the La Jolla Playhouse in La Jolla, California (where the Tommy musical first ran) on the 22nd and 23rd of June 2001.\n\nThe shows included in this boxset were all previously released online through Pete’s company, Eel Pie; there was only one run of each CD, and they all quickly became collector’s items. While Townshend has often performed short solo sets for charitable causes for, amongst others, Amnesty International, The Prince’s Trust and The Who’s own Double O charity which helps victims of domestic abuse and those suffering from addiction, full solo shows have been few and far between. When Pete has put on an entire solo show, the set lists have been picked from his own output, including specific Who songs, and cover versions of artists who have influenced him over the years.\n\nSpeaking of performing solo or performing with a band that wasn’t The Who, Pete Townshend said “I always have too much to do, too much responsibility, and not enough time. I have to live enough life to provide me with inspiration and context for my songs, I have to then spend enough time in my home studio finessing songs so they feel worthy of my band (The Who), then I have to re-record them with that band, then speak eloquently about them to the media, justifying my creative divergences, then I must tour endlessly behind the new music, continuing to celebrate the old stuff as well, and then start all over again. The idea that I would do all that for The Who and then do it for myself as well is simply plain insane. And yet for a while I tried. It didn’t go well. One career is enough.”\n\nAs Who and Townshend archivist Matt Kent puts it, “When Pete Townshend plays a solo show it isn’t just a concert, it is an EVENT. These CDs represent just how good these events are.”\n\nPETE TOWNSHEND\n\nLIVE > IN CONCERT 1985-2001\n\nDISC ONE: Brixton Academy, London, 1 & 2 November 1985\n\nMary Anne With The Shaky Hand\n\nWon’t Get Fooled Again\n\nA Little Is Enough\n\nSecondhand Love\n\nThat’s Alright Mama\n\nBehind Blue Eyes\n\nThe Shout\n\nHarlem Shuffle\n\nBarefootin’\n\nAfter The Fire\n\nLove On The Air\n\nMidnight Lover\n\nBlue Light\n\nI Put A Spell On You\n\nI’m One\n\nDISC TWO: Brixton Academy, London, 1 & 2 November 1985\n\nDriftin’\n\nMagic Bus\n\nSave It For Later\n\nEyesight To The Blind\n\nWalkin’\n\nStop Hurting People\n\nThe Sea Refuses No River\n\nBoogie Stop Shuffle\n\nFace The Face\n\nPinball Wizard\n\nGive Blood\n\nNight Train\n\nDISC THREE: Brooklyn Academy of Music, Brooklyn, NYC, 7 August 1993\n\nIntro\n\nEnglish Boy\n\nMeher Baba M3\n\nLet’s Get Pretentious\n\nMeher Baba M4 [Signal Box]\n\nEarly Morning Dreams\n\nI Want That Thing\n\nIntro : Outlive The Dinosaur\n\nOutlive The Dinosaur\n\nGridlife\n\nFlame [Demo]\n\nNow And Then\n\nI Am Afraid\n\nGridlife 2\n\nDon’t Try To Make Me Real\n\nIntro : Predictable\n\nPredictable\n\nFlame\n\nMeher Baba M5 [Vivaldi]\n\nFake It\n\nIntro : Now And Then [Reprise]\n\nNow And Then [Reprise]\n\nBaba O’Riley [Demo]\n\nEnglish Boy [Reprise]\n\nDISC FOUR: Brooklyn Academy of Music, Brooklyn, NYC, 7 August 1993\n\nPinball Wizard / See Me Feel Me / Listening To You\n\nLet My Love Open The Door\n\nRough Boys\n\nBehind Blue Eyes\n\nThe Kids Are Alright\n\nKeep Me Turning\n\nEminence Front\n\nA Little Is Enough\n\nYou Better You Bet\n\nFace The Face\n\nWon’t Get Fooled Again / Let’s See Action\n\nMagic Bus\n\nDISC FIVE: The Fillmore, San Francisco, 30 April 1996\n\nLet My Love Open The Door\n\nEnglish Boy\n\nDrowned\n\nThe Shout\n\nI Put A Spell On You\n\nCut My Hair\n\nSheraton Gibson\n\nI’m One\n\nHeart To Hang Onto\n\nParvardigar\n\nA Legal Matter\n\nDISC SIX: The Fillmore, San Francisco, 30 April 1996\n\nA Friend Is A Friend\n\nI Am An Animal\n\nAll Shall Be Well\n\nSlit Skirts\n\nEyesight To The Blind\n\nDriftin’ Blues\n\nNow And Then\n\nRough Boys\n\nI’m A Boy\n\nMagic Bus\n\nDISC SEVEN: Shepherds Bush Empire, London, 9 November 1998\n\nOn The Road Again\n\nA Little Is Enough\n\nPinball Wizard\n\nDrowned\n\nAnyway, Anyhow, Anywhere\n\nYou Better You Bet\n\nBehind Blue Eyes\n\nBaby Don’t You Do It\n\nEnglish Boy\n\nThree Steps To Heaven\n\nMary Anne With The Shaky Hand\n\nSheraton Gibson\n\nSubstitute\n\nI Am An Animal\n\nNorth Country Girl\n\nDISC EIGHT: Shepherds Bush Empire, London, 9 November 1998\n\n(She’s A) Sensation\n\nA Friend Is A Friend\n\nNow And Then\n\nLet My Love Open The Door\n\nWho Are You\n\nThe Kids Are Alright\n\nAcid Queen\n\nWon’t Get Fooled Again\n\nMagic Bus\n\nI’m One\n\nDISC NINE: Sadler’s Wells, London, 25 & 26 February 2000\n\nOne Note\n\nPurcell (Quick Movement)\n\nTeenage Wasteland\n\nTIme Is Passing\n\nLove Ain’t For Keeping\n\nGoin’ Mobile\n\nGreyhound Girl\n\nTragedy\n\nMary\n\nI Don’t Even Know Myself\n\nBargain\n\nGettin’ In Tune\n\nPure And Easy\n\nBaba O’Riley – Orchestral\n\nDISC TEN: Sadler’s Wells, London, 25 & 26 February 2000\n\nBaba O’Riley\n\nHinterland Rag\n\nBehind Blue Eyes\n\nLet’s See Action\n\nSister Disco\n\nRelay\n\nWho Are You\n\nJoin Together\n\nWon’t Get Fooled Again\n\nTragedy Explained\n\nThe Song Is Over\n\nCan You Help The One You Really Love?\n\nDISC ELEVEN: La Jolla Playhouse, 22 June 2001\n\nPinball Wizard\n\nLet My Love Open The Door\n\nHeart To Hang Onto\n\nCut My Hair\n\nSlit Skirts\n\nDrowned\n\nGreyhound Girl\n\nTattoo\n\nThe Sea Refuses No River\n\nDISC TWELVE: La Jolla Playhouse 22, June 2001\n\nSaint James Infirmary\n\nEminence Front\n\nWon’t Get Fooled Again\n\nBehind Blue Eyes\n\nWon’t Get Fooled Again (Electric)\n\nDISC THIRTEEN: La Jolla Playhouse, 23 June 2001\n\nPinball Wizard\n\nLet My Love Open The Door\n\nHeart To Hang Onto\n\nCut My Hair\n\nSlit Skirts\n\nDrowned\n\nGreyhound Girl\n\nTattoo\n\nCollings\n\nEminence Front\n\nDISC FOURTEEN: La Jolla Playhouse, 23 June 2001\n\nSheraton Gibson\n\nWon’t Get Fooled Again\n\nI’m One\n\nBehind Blue Eyes\n\nDriftin’ Blues\n\nEyesight To The Blind\n\nWon’t Get Fooled Again (Electric)\n\nRELEASED BY UMR ON 26th JULY 2024\n\nAVAILABLE FOR PRE-ORDER NOW"
