        "text": "Montana Singer/Songwriter, Mike Murray, has a voice that is honest, direct, and embodies the pureness of a classic folk storyteller. His music carries a message of camaraderie and empathy, while drawing inspiration from his adventurous life experiences. His tales are all his own, but somehow the way he tells them, we can all find ourselves in his words.\n\nWith a career in the music industry that spans over more than a decade, a thousand plus live performances, and six studio albums, Murray has developed the experience and versatility to explore a broad range of genres, both on stage and in the studio. His writing and composing ebb and flow from his recent rock album We Are Like Warriors, to his fully fledged pop-rock album Difficult Days, to his Americana albums, The Devil’s Rope, and Tumbleweed, to his 5 song, rock/blues EP Balance and Rhythm, to his folksy debut album International. His wide stylistic range and creative freedom are prevalent throughout his work.\n\nMurray released his sixth studio album The Devil’s Rope on November 12th, 2021, on all major streaming platforms. The Devil’s Rope is an Americana album that reflects Murray’s inner most thoughts while traversing the Western landscape. It is a cohesive piece of American art which is comforting, nostalgic and thought provoking. Murray recently signed The Devil’s Rope to A-Tone Recordings a label of Extreme Music. Renowned as production music’s poster child, Extreme Music has been a trusted media industry taste-maker since 1997. A-Tone Recordings is a connoisseur’s label celebrating the World’s greatest Musicians curated and produced by the legendary Steve Lindsey: the man behind the sounds of Leonard Cohen, Elton John, Bruno Mars and many more.\n\nPiano was Mike Murray’s first instrument, now he’s returning to it for an upcoming album. Where his last album focused on themes surrounding nature and western landscapes, he said, this upcoming album is more about the “landscape of the human heart.” – Taylor Inman – Daily InterLake – Feb. 22, 2024\n\n“Through TV and Streaming Shows, Mike Murray’s Music Is Finding New Listeners. A licensing agreement with a record label has resulted in Murray’s songs showing up on a range of shows, including Big Sky, American Idol, Lucifer, The Today Show and Love Island” – Mike Kordenbrock – Flathead Beacon – Oct. 28, 2022\n\n“‘Murray’s been one of the busiest sought-after musicians in and around the Flathead (since 2011). Murray’s message is one of hope for the pursuit of equality and justice in our country and in the world” – Carol Marino – Daily Interlake – February 8, 2021\n\nWith lyrics that channel his day-to-day experiences living in Montana and being human, Murray’s popularity has soared with local audiences. His music flirts with a smattering of unique styles, from his folksy 2011 debut album “International” to the alternative rock of his most recent release, 2018’s “Difficult Days” which landed a spot on the 2019 Grammy nomination consideration list for “Best Rock Album.” – Austin Amestoy – Montana Kaimin – Feb 12, 2020\n\n“Murray’s terrific mid-baritone range allows him to swoop and dive from low notes to falsetto. His burnished voice is heightened by a quivery, grainy honesty. He swaddles [it] all in great guitar solos and sailing choruses.” –Mariss McTucker – Lively Times (04/2018)\n\n“In contrast to his previous music, Murray describes the new 12-song album (We Are Like Warriors) as a “heavily introspective piece of work” in the rock genre. Murray played all the instruments on the album, experimenting with a lot of guitars, and mastered it himself in his studio at home in Kalispell.”- Maggie Dresser – Flathead Beacon – February 2, 2021\n\nMike Murray [has] carved out [a] successful niche in the Montana music scene, with [his] reach at times extending to regional and national levels. [He] has a number of well-received albums and countless sold-out shows to [his] name, including big festivals. [He’s] known, [He’s] good and [He’s] done this for a while. – Myers Reece – Flathead Beacon – July 11, 2019\n\nMUSICIAN’S SPOTLIGHT: July 9th 2021\n\nKalispell, Montana singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Mike Murray returns to Musician’s Spotlight to visit with host John Floridis and discuss his eventful last several years.\n\nCONNECT MT PODCAST: January, 8th 2020\n\nMike Murray has spent the past two decades honing his crafts as a songwriter, instrumentalist and vocalist. His insight and honesty hit hard in this in-depth interview, bringing us all along for the ride."
