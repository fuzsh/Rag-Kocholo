        "text": "Searing, empowering and an exciting sign of what we can look forward to, Ella Eyre’s new single is a testament to her ability to write a brilliant tune.\n\nHer second release since becoming an independent artist, Ella Eyre’s newest track ‘Ain’t No Love That Blind’ is the music she was always meant to make. Overflowing with humility, authenticity and palpable soul, it’s a vibrant and heartfelt letter to her younger self. Speaking words she wishes she had heard sooner, the way it explores heartbreak, relationships and the trials and tribulations of growing up is Eyre at her most raw but also her most powerful.\n\nAn explosion of sound, Eyre is joined and emboldened by producer Detonate who allows for her to create something that packs so much punch. Supporting vocals and an instant earworm of a bassline bolster up her silk smooth tone and the distortion and drums give the track the edge and grit that so brilliantly compliments the lyrics.\n\n‘Kamikaze, the kind that cuts deep, hit the concrete when your phone went. Renegade ways, don’t be shy babe: say it with a straight face you should come clean. Damn we were good, we were great, what a waste of a perfectly painted out dream. Kamikaze yeah you got me, kinda shocked me but ain’t no love that blind.’\n\nWords that deserve to be yelled by a crowd in a packed out venue, her lyrics are filled with fire. They point to both her frustrations with her past and the reclamation of her sound and identity as an independent artist. The energy of the track never lets up and the cool ferocity she delivers her vocals with is unwavering. Things break down momentarily for the bridge and we get a moment to truly appreciate Eyres vocal agility, but much like the anticipation of waiting for the beat to drop, the chorus comes crashing back in an anthemic style.\n\nTalking about her intentions with the track, she explains\n\n‘Ain’t no love that blind is the anthem I feel like I needed to hear in my teens when I was writing songs about a heartbreak I could never imagine getting over. It’s about a betrayal, one you weren’t expecting but also weren’t surprised by because after years of romantic (and unromantic) relationships, I learnt to protect my peace by being very careful who I put my faith in. This song just makes me feel so good and when that chorus hook hits there’s a real sense of empowerment and freedom in knowing my own strength now.\n\nWritten to more than just her younger self, this track is in dialogue with the Ella we have known these last ten years. So much has changed since she was signed to a major label at 16; ups and downs with health, familial loss and the never-ending struggles that come from being thrown into the music industry at such a young age. It makes absolute sense then that so much of what goes into this track is the strength she has forged through everything; we are just getting the chance to finally see it.\n\nThe track saw its live debut as part of the BAFTA celebrations earlier this week and if the recordings are anything to go by, this is a song you need to experience to appreciate fully. Any hints as to what we can expect to hear next are kept tightly under wraps but with festival season on the horizon speculations and manifestations that Ella might appear on the lineups are causing a frenzy already. Whether she is working towards an album or is simply experimenting with her newfound style and voice, it is safe to say that Ella Eyre is back and is here to stay."
