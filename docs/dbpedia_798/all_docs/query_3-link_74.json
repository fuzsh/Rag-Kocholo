        "text": "i cant find the stars\n\nand the moon it seems so far\n\ncos the one i love has blinded me\n\nshes the only one i'll ever see again\n\nshe stole my heart\n\nright from the very start\n\nshe took my love\n\nthen everything went down\n\nand now i know the stars dont shine no more\n\nshe broke my heart\n\nit tore my life apart\n\ni'm here alone we're women till the morn\n\nand the love i had slowly drains away\n\nthey say love is blind\n\nyeah the lies they're hard to find\n\nbut my loves now gone so i cant carry on\n\nand now i know, yes now i know\n\nthe stars still shine once more\n\nLyrics powered by www.musixmatch.com"
