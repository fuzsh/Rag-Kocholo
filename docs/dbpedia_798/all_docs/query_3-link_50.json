        "text": "published on 2023-06-15T21:31:28Z\n\nAlbum analysis and review on Bustena: https://bustena.wordpress.com/2024/05/21/un-album-electronico-unrequited-self-love-story/ I'm incredibly happy and honored to present my debut âUnrequited Self Love Storyâ LP!!! A 10 track album on a trip through finding your own true peace. And I'm also out of words to be able to say that it's out now on my favorite label in this world @wearesilkenwood !!! Stream it anywhere: https://www.silkenwood.us/releases/tbb-usls This album goes through the inner journey of realizing that nothing from outside yourself itâs gonna ever bring you peace. For some reason, we all seem to disconnect from our most pure heart essence and try to look for that same thing outside. We try to recover that strength and confidence finding someone to love us, trying to achieve our goals and looking for succession; but none of those seem to work long term and we seem to feel even emptier and more sad at the end of the day, when everything is quiet. We frenetically run from our shadow as much and as fast as possible even though the mind keeps calling our attention harder and noisier, till it finally takes over and we have no chance to ignore it any more. Once weâre in front of our biggest fear, we still struggle to look at it face to face and we keep asking our gods for some guide; but even them tell us that we have to look at it straight into their eyes. So then we realize that apparently scary demon was just our inner kid being afraid of growing up. We have to calm them then telling that becoming an adult is not that of a deal; itâs just the art of not giving a fuck about peoples opinion, making your own decisions and keep pushing no matter if you fail or if you get it! So we finally stop looking for anyone or anything! We finally realize that weâre just complete on our own! But to fully love ourselves we need to embrace our darkness, so that primary spark of love can come out again brighter and more powerful than ever, not negating its inseparable shadow. Its own dual nature. So that we can finally free fly by!
