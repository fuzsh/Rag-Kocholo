[DAVE] We could really use you’re support here kiddo. [BRITTAIN] What about Rose? [DAVE] Roxie honey, how old are you now? [BRITTAIN] Seven. [DAVE] Seven! Hey, that’s pretty old! You’re getting to be a real big girl. [BRITTAIN] Yeah, guess so. [DAVE] Remember last spring when we put a bunch of your old toys and books away, in the Northern wing? [BRITTAIN] Yeah… [DAVE] Well don’t you think that maybe it’s time to kind of, put Rose away too? [BRITTAIN] No! [BRENT] None of us have ever even seen her, so— [DAVE] Look Roxie, it’s fine to have an imagination…I mean I used to play when I was little, and I had friends in my head, sure. This is a big house, I know it gets lonely. But we’re afraid that Rose may be holding you back from playing with the other kids. [BRITTAIN] That’s not nice! [GELSEY] Roxie, it’s time to grow up. [BRITTAIN] Oh, get over yourself Mom! [BRENT] Oooooo... [DAVE] Roxie! [BRITTAIN] Look, I know who she is. She told me, Rose told me. [DAVE] Roxie… [BRITTAIN] She’s my sister, she died when I was a baby, blah blah blah. And now she’s lonely and wants me to “cross over.” And maybe that’d be sad for you, but maybe it’d be great for me. She says all the adults over there wish they had died when they were little too, cuz it’s so much better over there than all this crap, and all this crap with getting old, and disease, and war, and torture, and butchers, and having to be alone with your stupid mind all the time? She says that over there they don’t have computers or any of that shit and everyone’s mind is just fine. They just hang out in nature all the time, only it’s better cuz it’s perfect nature, with no bugs or humidity or anything. And no, Brent, it’s not so perfect it’s boring, they figured that out too, so there are grey days and rain and stuff, but it’s fine, cuz everyone likes to be a little sad some of the time, and watch the rain on the windowsills... Cuz they're all soul. They are all soul. Did you know Rose is a Starchild? That's right, she's a freaking Starchild! So I’m sorry if this is like, sad for you, but you're gonna be dead in like, 30 years, and even less if you two keep drinking like— [GELSEY/DAVE] Roxie! [BRITTAIN] —and when you meet me over there you’ll see, and you’ll think God, that 30 years of being all sad was just stupid, but who cares anymore, because now it's just an eternity of soul! And swimming! And fruit! So why don't you just shut up! Why don’t you, just have another fucking drink, and shut the fuck up! ____________________________________\n\n9.\n\nFour Friends 05:08\n\nFOUR FRIENDS _______________ [DAVE] Side 2, Track 3. “Four Friends.” [ALL] OH EVAN WILLIAMS YOU DIRTY-FACED, SCRUFFY-KNEED BOY [BRENT] WHEN I WAS POOR AND LONELY I’D PUT YOU IN A JELLY JAR PUT YOU IN THE POCKET OF MY OLD TRENCH COAT AND SNEAK YOU INTO THE BAR NOW I GOT PLENTY OF MONEY BUT THAT DOESN’T MEAN I DON’T LOVE YOU WHEN THE ENDTIMES FALL AND THE ZOMBIES CRAWL I‘M GONNA DRINK YOU OUT OF MY SHOE [ALL] I LIKE TO LOSE MY MIND GET BLURRY SLOPPY BOOZY AND BLIND LIKE TO PUT MY HAND ON A PRETTY GIRL’S KNEE AND I GOT FOUR DEAR FRIENDS TO HELP ME OH JAMESON YOU DIGNIFIED, RIGHTEOUS YOUNG MAN [BRITTAIN] I DON’T CARE MUCH FOR GOD NO MATTER WHAT SET OF RULES YOU GOT PROTESTANT THIS AND-A CATHOLIC THAT TO ME IT’S JUST DIDDLY-SQUAT BUT I LOVE A GOOD REBELLION AND I LOVE TO HEAR A FIDDLE SLIDE SO WHEN THE REBELS CROON ‘BOUT THAT RISING MOON I’M STANDING RIGHT HERE ON JAMIE’S SIDE [ALL] I LIKE TO LOSE MY MIND GET BLURRY SLOPPY BOOZY AND BLIND LIKE TO PUT MY HAND ON A PRETTY GIRL’S KNEE AND I GOT FOUR DEAR FRIENDS TO HELP ME OH, MAKER’S MARK YOU SWEET LITTLE TEMPTRESS YOU [DAVE] I REMEMBER YOU AND MY DADDY SITTING IN THE EASY CHAIR HE’D RIP OPEN YOUR WAX AND POUR A FINGER OR TWO AND THEN HE'D SIT IN THE DARK AND JUST STARE I KNOW THAT HE WAS THINKIN’ ‘BOUT SOMETHING MAYBE SOMETHING SAD FROM LONG AGO BUT WHEN HE’D TUCK ME IN, WITH THAT SAD LITTLE GRIN I’D THINK MAYBE I DON’T WANNA KNOW [ALL] I LIKE TO LOSE MY MIND GET BLURRY SLOPPY BOOZY AND BLIND LIKE TO PUT MY HAND ON A PRETTY GIRL’S KNEE [BRITTAIN & GELSEY] PRETTY BOY’S KNEE [ALL] AND I GOT FOUR DEAR FRIENDS TO HELP ME OH, LAGAVULIN YOU LOVELY LADY OF THE LOCHS [GELSEY] THERE’S A FOREST BURNING SOMEWHERE AND THE MOON IS RED AS BLOOD BUT THEN I LOOK IN YOUR EYES AND THE FAIRIES COME AND I’M SQUISHING MY TOES IN THE MUD I’M DANCING ON THE STONES OF THE ORACLE I’M KISSING IN THE WATERFALL I’M UNDER YOUR SPELL, IN A WISHING WELL I’M LOST AND I DON’T CARE AT ALL [ALL] I LIKE TO LOSE MY MIND GET BLURRY SLOPPY BOOZY AND BLIND I LIKE TO PUT MY HAND ON A PRETTY GIRL’S KNEE [DAVE & BRENT] PRETTY BOY’S KNEE [ALL] AND I GOT FOUR DEAR FRIENDS TO HELP ME FOUR DEAR FRIENDS TO HELP ME FOUR DEAR FRIENDS TO HELP ME ____________________________________\n\n10.\n\nFathers & Sons 02:22\n\nFATHERS & SONS _________________ [GELSEY] Side 2, Track 4. “Fathers & Sons.” [DAVE & BRENT (Edgar & Fool)] LET ME DRINK TONIGHT DON’T BOTHER ME YOU ALL CAN GO AWAY AND JUST THE BOTTLE CAN STAY LA DA DA DA DA DA DA DA DA DA DA DA DA DA DA DA DA I’M NEVER REALLY HAPPY AND I’M NEVER REALLY SAD BUT I’M A PRETTY BAD LOVER AND I’D PROBABLY BE A DEADBEAT DAD [DAVE] MY SON MY SON GET AWAY FROM ME STRIKE OUT ON YOUR OWN PACK YOUR BAGS UP AND FLEE AND NEVER LOOK BACK AT YOUR ROTTEN POP DRINKING IN THE BATHROOM OF AN ICE CREAM SHOP [BRENT (Fool/Pusher)] MY DAD MY DAD I’M OUTTA HERE I’LL FINISH MY DRINK AND THEN I’LL DISAPPEAR I'M GONNA PLAY CELLO IN A ROCK’N’ROLL BAND MAKE MONEY ON THE SIDE FROM MY HEROIN STAND AND IF ANYONE PUSHES ME I’M GONNA PUSH THEM BACK AND IF ANYONE PUSHES ME I’M GONNA PUSH THEM BACK [DAVE & BRENT] LA DA DA DA DA DA DA DA DA DA DA DA DA DA DA DA DA LA DA DA DA DA DA DA DA DA DA DA DA DA DA DA DA DA [BRITTAIN & GELSEY (Rose & Pearl)] THERE’S A MAN ON THE PLATFORM SCREAMING ABOUT THE APOCALYPSE SCREAMING ABOUT THE DAY OF REVELATION THE DAY OF REVELATION IS AT HAND REVEAL IT TO ME REVEAL ME EVERYTHING REVEAL IT TO ME PLEASE RIGHT NOW [DAVE & BRENT] I’M NEVER REALLY HAPPY AND I’M NEVER REALLY SAD BUT I’M A PRETTY BAD LOVER AND I’D PROBABLY BE A DEADBEAT DAD ____________________________________\n\n11.\n\nUsher, Part 2 02:48\n\nUSHER, PART 2 ________ [BRENT] Side 2, Track 5. “Usher, Part 2.” [DAVE (Edgar)] AS ROXIE LAY DYING IN HER BEDROOM MY WIFE SANG AND OUR SON PLAYED HIS GUITAR WILD IMPROVISATIONS DIRGES AND WALTZES FEVERED RHAPSODIES [GELSEY & BRENT (Lady Usher & Fool)] THE STONES ARE ALIVE THE STONES ARE ALIVE THE DECAYING TREES THE MOSS ON THE WALL THE MOSS ON THE WALL THE CONDENSATION ON THE WINDOW IT IS ALL ALIVE ALL ALIVE [ALL] THE DRIVER CAN’T STOP THE GHOST IS HERE THE DRIVER CAN’T STOP THE GHOST IS HERE THE DRIVER CAN’T STOP DRIVER CAN’T STOP THE GHOST IS HERE DRIVER CAN’T STOP DRIVER CAN’T STOP THE GHOST IS HERE [BRITTAIN (Roxie)] WHERE IS MY BROTHER?

He thinks that the ghost of Thelonious Monk is living behind that door, this hidden door in the 14th century Persian palace of Shah Zaman. David serenades him every night with music from that piano. And it’s the last piano in the world, and its keys cut his fingers with every note he plays, because the Gods have decreed that humans don’t deserve music anymore, because they think we don’t treat it holy enough. And every sound gives him migraine thickness, blinding pressure, bamboo shoots in the fingernail. Yet, listen. He plays Thelonious Monk’s music every night in the hope that Monk’s ghost will awaken from his slumber, open the door and forgive him, and grant him a smile, a kiss, and a meaning for all of his pain.
