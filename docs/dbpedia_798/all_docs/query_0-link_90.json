        "text": "\"I’ve really had to let this one sink in. It’s been out for nearly a year, but until recently I’ve been unsure as to whether this album has clouded my brain in pure nostalgia fog, or whether I genuinely love it. Yes, it effectively evokes the very specific vibe of a certain era in metal’s history – but it is done so with such sincerity and oodles of potential that it tends to look to the future just as much as the past. I utterly adore this album and, though it might not be my #1 record of 2021, it’s probably the album I’ve listened to the most. There’s a wickedly addictive quality to this that fans of early 2000s power metal will get hooked on. Despite being Swedish, Evermore sound incredibly German. The likes of Helloween, Edguy, Blind Guardian – even the less pompous parts of Freedom Call – are immediate obvious comparisons. Yet, the sound created on their debut full-length record Court Of The Tyrant King is certainly their own. In the years to come, the overall timbre of Evermore will become instantly recognizable.\n\nThe initial approach, despite the obligatory (and brilliant) intro “Hero’s Journey”, is one of ‘all guns blazing’. Straight out of the starting gates comes this Swedish trio with rapid double-kick attacks, quick up-and-down strumming, soaring background keyboards and huge major melodies. Exactly the kind of thing you’re looking for if you often find yourself staring wistfully at old Gaia Epicus album covers. The production values positively reek of 2001-esque Euro-power; many comparisons being drawn in my head to Edguy’s Mandrake but with slightly less theatre. It’s a wonderful sound that evokes nostalgia whilst also being able to stir with excitement for what’s to come. The three band members are absolutely on fire, playing with charisma, conviction and – most importantly – authenticity. No overdone studio trickery here; this LP sounds fresh, raw and real. Andreas Vikland injects that classic power metal gallop with real energy in his drum performance, and Johan Karlsson’s string work has just the right amount of flamboyance the style needs – not to mention a classy use of keyboards that support well and never overpower.\n\nJohan Haraldsson’s inimitable vocal style is instantly a focal point. Refreshingly unpolished, blaringly treble and full of character. This is one of the most fun vocalists to sing along with – helped by the almost forcefully major tunes he undertakes. Every vocal line here does exactly what you think it will, and that could have been an issue that led to stagnation, but Evermore make it incredibly satisfying. No unnecessary frills, just pure, undiluted, joyful power metal melodies. Sure, the chord progressions are predictable, but you wish you could write songs that make this much of an impact. Most striking of all is the utterly stunning title-track. Easily one of my favourite power metal numbers of the last decade; “Court Of The Tyrant King” covers all bases. From its exciting choral ‘Bow and kneel!’ verse, through the female-led tenderness of the pre-chorus, to the absolutely phenomenal chorus. Seriously, that is one of the best choruses ever written for this genre. It refuses to exit my head and I refuse to let it leave. Simultaneously melancholy and triumphant. There is even some fancy bass work in the bridge, and a very rare use of the word ‘twat’ in the second verse.\n\nWhilst nothing hits quite as hard as the title-track, no other song drops the ball. There’s that awkward moment 3 minutes into “Northern Cross” where Johan’s vocals go a little rogue but, overall, every track – to put it maturely – fucking slaps. My only gripe is with the structure of the album itself. Not only is there a mistake with the tracklist on my CD from Alone Records (“Northern Cross” & “See No Evil” are the wrong way round), but this disc would have had a perfect score if these external factors were polished. Firstly, they could manage perhaps one more song. 40 minutes is a little short for songwriting with this much grandiosity. Then there’s the issue of the finale. Now, I have nothing against “By Death Reborn”; great track, and it brings out some of the band’s heavier riff set – a real headbanger. But it’s not a finale! Why, o why, did they not end with “See No Evil” and its colossal closing chords? Or “My Last Command” with its blindingly obvious dramatic ending?! Listen and you’ll see what I mean.\n\nThat last paragraph sounded a little negative I admit, but I only complain out of adoration, because I fell in love with Evermore’s sound immediately. This is an absolutely brilliant power metal album that knows exactly what it wants to be. It pulls no punches and makes no apologies. The fantastic cover art is perfectly suited to the music within (and, once again, reminiscent of Edguy!). It’s also responsible for one of the best power metal songs…like…ever. Come to think of it, the title-track probably would’ve made a good closing number, too!"
