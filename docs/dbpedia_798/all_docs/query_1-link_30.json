        "text": "Love Is Blind Season 5 is a rollercoaster ride. Although only three couples are featured in this season, it turns out there's enough footage and drama between the six contestants that there's still just as much to discuss as in all the previous seasons. Whether it's Lydia and Uche's secret past relationship or Izzy and Stacy's conflict with Johnie, each episode brings a bit more chaos as each member of the pods gets closer to the altar.\n\nBut Netflix knows the stories of these couples don't end at the altar. Even if they don't say \"I do,\" there's still much to unpack about the very real relationships fostered in the pods. Plus, since filming happens so far from when the show airs for viewers, there's months of contestants' lives immediately after the show viewers are eager to know more about.\n\nThat's where Love Is Blind's reunion episode comes in. Aired right after the season concludes, we get to see where all the show's couples ended up. And for the ones that said no at the altar, we get to find out if they dated after the show, or even found someone after the fact. Plus, contestants watch back the biggest moments in the show and get to have conversations with one another, as well as respond to any lingering online discourse.\n\nSo, how do you make sure you're tuned in for the next Love Is Blind reunion? Here's what you need to know.\n\nHow to Watch the Love Is Blind Season 5 Reunion\n\nDon't worry, there won't be a repeat of the previous season. After the absolute mess that was the Season 4 live reunion, Netflix will be pre-recording the reunion and premiering it after the fact, as it did in the show's first few seasons.\n\nThe episode will premiere on Sunday, October 15 at 8pm ET. As long as you have a Netflix subscription, you'll be able to watch. After October 15, you'll be able to watch the episode forever."
