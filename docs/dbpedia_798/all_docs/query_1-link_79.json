        "text": "File photo\n\nDuring an early '90s when alternative-rock was wrestling the throne away from arena-metal as the dominant guitar species, The Black Crowes offered an alternative to alternative.\n\nThe Crowes' bluesier, classic-sounding rock helped the band stand out amid grunge-groups and hair-bands. It also made them a band without a country. And got them branded with the scarlet R for \"retro\" by more than a few media types.\n\nFor a band that sold millions of records, The Black Crowes often seemed to be swimming upstream, but some of that was their own doing, with head-scratching career decisions later and a talented frontman who when not singing could be charismatic or unlikable depending on the minute.\n\nEarly on, these Atlanta-founded rockers seemed destined to play arenas for the next 20 years. Instead they ended up pretty much a cult band - albeit a cult band doing mostly theaters and halls instead of clubs. But make no mistake, if the band reunited tomorrow for a tour, they'd do good business. And there will be renewed interest in The Black Crowes soon, beyond their longtime faithful.\n\nThe band's drummer Steve Gorman is readying a memoir, titled \"Hard to Handle\" after their breakthrough Otis Redding cover.\n\nGorman is a clever storyteller and likable dude. Having been behind the kit for almost every Crowes gig and every single album, he'll have a unique perspective on the group's famously warring brothers (guitarist Rich Robinson and singer Chris Robinson) and the many stars whose orbits intersected with The Crowes. The band's entire journey, really. Gorman is writing his book with Steve Hyden, author of one of 2018's most critically lauded music tomes, \"Twilight of the Gods.\" Ahead of Gorman's memoir, due Sept. 24 via De Capo, I ranked The Black Crowes' officially released studio releases, worst to best. The band has plenty of opinionated, knowledgeable fans. I fully expect them to disagree with some or all the following words.\n\n9. \"Lions\"\n\nReleased: 2001\n\nI gave The Black Crowes lots of my money during the '90s and 2000s. Still love the band. However, I loathe their \"Lions\" album and generally pretend it never even happened, kind of like I do with Jimmy Page's \"Kashmir\"-defiling Puff Daddy collaboration \"Come With Me.\" That said, there are a handful of \"Lions\" tracks that don't deserve to be erased from time - most notably, joyous jam \"Soul Singing.\" \"Cosmic Friend\" offers psych-pop sparks. Having recently backed former Zep guitarist Page on a memorable 1999 tour and resulting live album sounds like it inspired The Crowes' thrashy \"Cypress Tree\" and molten \"Midnight from the Inside Out.\" The heartfelt \"Lay It All On Me\" closes \"Lions\" on a high-note. But lead single \"Lickin'\" sounds like a malfunctioning dot-matrix printer. Black Crowes may not have ever gotten noticed back in 1990 if not for Chris Robinson's soaring pipes and magnetic stage presence. But later, on the band's lesser works, his lyrics or vocals are almost always the weak link. In Chris' defense, the same can be said of many other rock bands. But that's the case here with \"Come On,\" \"No Use Lying,\" \"Young Man, Old Man,\" \"Miracle to Me\" and cringe-inducing quasi-rapped \"Ozone Mama.\" Unfairly this is the lone Crowes studio disc featuring Audley Freed, the band's talented lead guitarist for several of their wilderness years, so Crowes fan don't appreciate Freed like they should. (Kind of how Ronnie Wood would likely be revered like Mick Taylor if those two guitarists swapped Stones periods.)\n\n8. \"Before the Frost...Until the Freeze\"\n\nReleased: 2009\n\nThe concept for \"Before the Frost...Until the Freeze\" was intriguing: record an album of new material, live in front of an audience in the studio. If you were a devout Crowes-head this was like getting a chance to pay to watch Jean-Michel Basquiat paint or Paul Thomas Anderson direct. The band's playing is dexterous on these beardy tunes. Yet, \"Frost\" would be vastly improved if narrowed down to a single 10-track album instead of its 20-song double-LP chassis. \"Make Glad,\" \"Kept My Soul,\" \"Shady Grove\" and sitar jam \"Aimless Peacock\" should've hit the cutting room floor, for starters. Lead vocals are off-key on several tracks. And on Chris' disco-rocker \"I Ain't Hiding\" you can almost hear Rich gritting teeth during his guitar solo. There' still some durable songwriting here, on \"Good Morning Captain,\" \"So Many Times,\" the Faces-y \"A Train Makes a Lonely Sound\" and stirring \"Been a Long Time.\" After a 2015 breakup due to a tour money-split disagreement, \"Frost\" stands as The Black Crowes last studio album. But their previous release, \"Warpaint,\" would've been a more-fitting final statement.\n\n7. \"By Your Side\"\n\nReleased: 1999\n\nAs I've said before, with \"By Your Side\" the band's new label Columbia Records was obviously trying to turn them into the new \"new Aerosmith.\" Columbia even suggested The Crowes collaborate with \"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\" songwriter Diane Warren. Many once-popular bands given another shot at stardom would've said \"Yes sir\" at such an idea, but the ornery Crowes of course did not. It's also worth noting \"By Your Side\" was released during Chris' tragic-hat period. (See album cover art.) The disc does contain some excellent hard-rock. Zep-tastic \"HorseHead\" is the most metallic The Crowes ever got, with Gorman summoning \"Physical Graffiti\" boom. \"Kickin' My Heart Around\" traffics in venomous velocity. Title track \"By Your Side\" recaptures \"Shake Your Money Maker\" strut, while \"Only a Fool\" and \"Diamond Ring\" are well-crafted valentines. The Band-like gem \"Welcome To The Goodtimes\" deserved more acclaim and wider audience. The best \"By Your Side\" songs are arguably stronger than those on \"Three Snakes.\" Unfortunately, subpar lyrics sink many other \"BYS\" tracks, like \"Heavy,\" \"Virtue and Vice,\" \"Go Tell the Congregation\" and \"Then She Said My Name,\" although Chris generally sings his can off here.\n\n6. \"Warpaint\"\n\nReleased: 2008\n\nLeft for dead by many after the limp \"Lions,\" the band returned with the much rootsier and potent \"Warpaint.\" The addition of North Mississippi Allstars slide-guitar ace Luther Dickinson revitalized The Crowes. And there were better songs again. Opening track \"Goodbye Daughters of the Revolution\" rekindled Stones sashay. Released during the White Stripes/Black Keys era, \"Walk Believer Walk\" proved a band could still do blues cool without being a garage-duo. \"Oh Josephine\" is a stoned heartbreaker and \"Locust Street\" one of the Crowes' most poignant works. \"Movin' on Down the Line\" is a fine highway song. Alas, \"Wee Who See the Deep,\" \"Evergreen\" and \"There's Gold in Them Hills\" are hippy snoozers. Album closer \"Whoa Mule,\" a folky reflection of making it to the other side of Rock Star Mountain, works much better. Overall, \"Warpaint\" is a damn-solid album from band 18 years into their recording career.\n\n5. \"Three Snakes and One Charm\"\n\nReleased: 1996\n\nHere's the fork in the road. \"Three Snakes\" is when casual listeners dropped The Black Crowes and ardent fans dug-in for life. A possibly cause is how the record was mixed. The guitars are harder to grab onto, a turn-off for listeners who'd tuned-in for another \"Southern Harmony\" fret-fest. \"Three Snakes\" is Chris Robinson's favorite Crowes record. It's easy to see why, as it contains some of his most brilliant lyrics, especially \"perfume and Valium\" laced \"Under a Mountain,\" strummy kiss-off \"Good Friday,\" Prince-ish power-ballad \"Girl From a Pawnshop,\" trippy \"One Mirror Too Many\" and corrosive \"Nebekanezer.\" Lesser material weighs the LP down though, like sappy \"Better When You're Not Alone,\" faux-funk \"(Only) Halfway to Everywhere\" and bar-band-ish \"Let Me Share The Ride.\" \"Blackberry,\" which hops with \"Hard to Handle\"-worthy Gorman beats and hot Chris vocals, is a rare instance where a Rich guitar riff tanks a Crowes track. Despite those flaws, one could do much worse for a daytrip soundtrack than \"Three Snakes.\" Many of the band's more tie-dyed-type fans hold this album in high regard.\n\n4. \"The Lost Crowes\"\n\nThis is cheating a bit. \"The Lost Crowes\" is a compilation of two shelved projects, \"Amorica\" precursor \"Tall\" and \"The Band,\" tracks originally recorded around 1993 to 1997. But even just the latter \"lost\" album would be the fourth best Crowes LP. A click closer to \"Southern Harmony\" lightning than \"Amorica\" fog. Longhaired like \"Three Snakes\" but more resonant. \"The Band\"-era highlights include blacklight-rockers \"Paint an 8,\" \"Another Roadside Tragedy\" and \"Peace Anyway,\" the pastoral \"Wyoming and Me,\" bittersweet \"Lifevest\" and tear-jerking \"My Heart's Killing Me.\" The druggier, \"Tall\" stuff like \"Dirty Hair Halo,\" \"Feathers,\" \"Song of the Flesh\", \"Tied Up & Swallowed\" is equal parts good-trip and bad-trip. The buzz from acoustic songs - like lyrically twisty hayseed lark \"Tornado\" and paranoia hymn \"Thunderstorm 6:54\" - lasts just as long though.\n\n3. \"Amorica\"\n\nReleased: 1994\n\nIts best songs are among the group's zenith - particularly cosmic-cowboy jams \"Wiser Time,\" \"Nonfiction\" and \"Ballad in Urgency.\" Percussion-driven \"High Head Blues\" and afterglow saunter \"She Gave Good Sunflower,\" too. \"Descending\" is a gorgeous piano-gospel fadeout. It's well-documented recording \"Amorica\" was a mess. While there were piles of drugs present during the sessions, (perhaps not coincidentally) there weren't as many songwriting homeruns as before. The music on \"Gone\" and \"A Conspiracy\" is interesting, but the lyrics have lost a step. I've owned a copy of \"Amorica\" since the first day it came out and listened to it probably a thousand times, but never been able to make it through off-brand shuffle \"P. 25 London\" without fast-forwarding. Hustler-sourced cover art (presented here in \"censored\" version sold at some big-box retailers) often overshadowed the music inside - at least in mainstream pop-culture.\n\n2. \"Shake Your Money Maker\"\n\n\"Amorica\" may be the better album to get high to, but \"Shake Your Money Maker\" is the better album. Familiarity fatigue causes many superfans to devalue The Crowes' debut. Heroin ballad \"She Talks to Angels,\" guitar-ified \"Hard to Handle\" reboot and swaggering \"Jealous Again\" became ubiquitous. But there's a reason for that - they're outstanding tracks. Ditto, slide stomp \"Twice As Hard.\" Muscle Shoals-style ballads \"Sister Luck\" and \"Seeing Things\" hold up extremely well. Raucous \"Thick N' Thin\" and \"Could I've Been So Blind\" are sterling deep-cuts. The Stones reuniting for 1989 album \"Steel Wheels\" and tour clearly didn't hurt \"Money Maker,\" nor did Guns N' Roses' 1987 LP \"Appetite for Destruction\" reminding mainstream fans how much fun raw hook-laden rock could be. But commercially, the real key was \"Shake Your Money Maker\" was one of few 1990 guitar albums that could appeal to both Motley Crue fans and R.E.M. fans, a range that helped it move more than 5 million copies.\n\n1. \"The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion\"\n\nReleased: 1992\n\nThe sound of a young band, height of their powers, chip on their shoulder, hot to show what they can really do. There's an edge to \"Southern Harmony\" missing from The Crowes' spirited yet straight-up debut. Chris' howls are more serrated, the balladeering more nuanced. Rich's guitars sound more distinctive and creative, particularly jubilant roof-rattler \"Remedy\" and intricate \"Thorn In My Pride.\" Gorman and bassist Johnny Colt give everything the right shake or sway. After touring the world, the band had honed their chops. But as astute Crowes fans know, hotshot California guitarist Marc Ford's arrival is the big difference between \"Southern Harmony\" and \"Money Maker.\" Ford's vicious \"No Speak No Slave\" wah and \"Sometimes Salvation\" fuzz knots are particularly spectacular. The addition of blues vet Ed Harsch on keyboards is less heralded than Ford's but no less impactful. (Rolling Stones pianist and former Allman Brother Chuck Leavell added tasty keys to \"Money Maker,\" but it was Harsch who joined The Crowes on the following tour.) Many of \"Southern Harmony's signature moments - the \"Remedy\" Wurly breakdown, \"Thorn in My Pride\" organ, etc. - don't come from the band's \"stars.\" They came from the late great Ed Harsch. All told, this sophomore LP is a snapshot between mass-appeal \"Money Maker\" hooks and alluring \"Amorica\" shagginess. \"Hotel Illness.\" \"Black Moon Creeping.\" \"My Morning Song.\" \"Bad Luck Blue Eyes Goodbye.\" Even \"Beggar's Banquet\"-styled Bob Marley cover \"Time Will Tell.\" There's not one clunker here. If a band makes a truly great album no one can ever take that away from them, no matter how many lineup changes and so-so releases follow. The Black Crowes did that here. Fans of fad-proof rock-music will cherish \"Southern Harmony\" for decades to come.\n\nFile photo/Star-Ledger/Dorab Khandalavala\n\nMore on music\n\nChris Robinson talks Black Crowes, Jimmy Page, drugs\n\n45 years later, Buckingham Nicks album still casts spell\n\nMidnight Rider's last goodbye: The story of Gregg Allman's Muscle Shoals album\n\nHow The Black Keys made a modern Muscle Shoals classic"
