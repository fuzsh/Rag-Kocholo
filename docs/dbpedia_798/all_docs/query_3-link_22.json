        "text": "Blind Pilot have returned radically transformed and revitalized on their first release since 2016 – In The Shadow Of The Holy Mountain – giving hard-earned depth and perspective to the group’s “elegant, thoughtful reflections” (NPR Music). The eleven-song collection arrives August 16 via ATO Records, on the other side of a years-long journey for Blind Pilot’s Israel Nebeker – both geographically and spiritually – to reclaim his voice as a songwriter. “I was struggling with a lot of fear surrounding expectations of who I was supposed to be,” he confides, “I’d lost my path with music.”\n\nTraveling to Scandinavia to reconnect with his family’s roots in the nomadic Sámi community, a drum ceremony led Nebeker to visions of his ancestors, and to the mountain where his creative rebirth began. From there, his return to songwriting was solidified when he and Blind Pilot co-founder Ryan Dobrowski were invited to perform in Mexico City by a humanitarian group helping migrants in the country. After speaking with them for hours, “I got the idea to write a song that looks at ideas of ownership and othering, and what it does when we tell people, ‘This is our home, not yours.'” After years of not writing so much as a single verse, In The Shadow Of The Holy Mountain flowed out of him in one month. Soon after, he found himself reuniting with Dobrowski, bassist Luke Ydstie and multi-instrumentalist Kati Claborn to begin work on Blind Pilot’s first new album in eight years in their longtime homebase of Astoria, Oregon.\n\nPre-order the new album In The Shadow Of The Holy Mountain: https://atorecords-ffm.com/itsothm\n\nListen to “Just A Bird” here, a song with carefree spirit that sharply contrasts the emotional complexity of its lyrical sentiment: https://atorecords-ffm.com/justabird\n\nTeaming with producer Josh Kaufman (The National, The War On Drugs) at a 19th century church turned home studio in upstate New York, the recording sessions for In The Shadow Of The Holy Mountain were the most free-flowing of the band’s career, approaching perfection like “an overly Photoshopped picture of someone you love.” The final result was “the most joy we’d ever had in making an album together,” as Nebeker described it – which shines through palpably on a collection that’s equal parts celebration and revelation. “We’re still feeling that deep connection that’s been a throughline for our entire adult lives,” adds Dobrowski, who formed an early version of Blind Pilot with Nebeker nearly two decades ago as college students.\n\nMuch of the enrapturing energy pulsing through In The Shadow Of The Holy Mountain stems from Blind Pilot fully harnessing the chemistry of their live performances (“listening to each other and trusting our instincts”) – which has included tours with The Shins, Andrew Bird, and Gregory Alan Isakov along with major festival stages like Lollapalooza and Bonnaroo. This time around, they’ll tour North America deep into 2024 – beginning with a cross-country run of intimate shows this summer at venues like Los Angeles’ Masonic Lodge at Hollywood Forever and New York’s Sultan Room. They will debut new material from In The Shadow Of The Holy Mountain at these shows – celebrating Blind Pilot’s first album since And Then Like Lions in 2016, a collection they brought to CBS This Morning and NPR’s Tiny Desk alongside praise as “reminiscent of Lou Reed’s ‘Magic and Loss’ and Arcade Fire’s ‘Funeral,’ which are excellent company” (Wall Street Journal).\n\n‘In The Shadow Of The Holy Mountain’ Tracklist\n\nJacaranda\n\nBrave\n\nPocket Knife\n\nDon’t You Know\n\nJust A Bird\n\nComing Back\n\nFaces of Light\n\nOne Drop\n\nLucky\n\nBitter Water\n\nSame Thing\n\nBlind Pilot Tour Dates\n\nJune 16 – Fry Family Farm – Medford, OR [SOLD OUT]\n\nJune 18 – The Venice West – Los Angeles, CA [SOLD OUT]\n\nJune 20 – Masonic Lodge at Hollywood Forever Cemetery – Los Angeles, CA [SOLD OUT]\n\nJune 21 – Ojai Deer Lodge – Ojai, CA [SOLD OUT]\n\nJune 22 – Felton Music Hall – Felton, CA\n\nJune 23 – The Grove House – Mariposa, CA\n\nJune 25 – The Big Room at Sierra Nevada Brewing Co – Chico, CA\n\nJune 26 – WOW Hall – Eugene, OR\n\nJuly 13 – The Sultan Room – New York, NY [SOLD OUT]\n\nJuly 14 – United Theatre – Westerly, RI\n\nJuly 15 – Iron Horse Music Hall – Northampton, MA\n\nJuly 16 – The Atlantis – Washington, DC [SOLD OUT]\n\nJuly 19 – Maurer Hall at Old Town School of Folk – Chicago, IL [SOLD OUT]\n\nJuly 20 – Vivarium – Milwaukee, WI\n\nJuly 21 – Off Broadway – St. Louis, MO\n\nJuly 23 – The Raccoon Motel – Davenport, IA\n\nJuly 24 – HI-FI Indy – Indianapolis, IN\n\nJuly 26 – Grog Shop – Cleveland Heights, OH\n\nAugust 11 – Remlinger Farms – Carnation, WA\n\nAugust 12 – Biltmore Cabaret – Vancouver, BC\n\nAugust 15 – Churchill School – Baker City, OR\n\nAugust 16 – Mississippi Studios – Portland, OR\n\nAugust 17 – Trout Lake Hall – Trout Lake, WA\n\nAugust 31 – The Gorge Amphitheater – George, WA *\n\nNovember 8 – The Domino Room – Bend, OR\n\nNovember 9 – Harlow’s – Sacramento, CA\n\nNovember 12 – The Fillmore – San Francisco, CA\n\nNovember 15 – Teragram Ballroom – Los Angeles, CA\n\nNovember 16 – Lobero Theatre – Santa Barbra, CA\n\nNovember 17 – Belly Up Solana Beach – Solana Beach, CA\n\nNovember 19 – Hotel Congress – Tucson, AZ\n\nNovember 20 – Meow Wolf – Santa Fe, New Mexico\n\nNovember 21 – Gothic Theatre – Englewood, CO\n\nNovember 22 – Washington’s Foco – Fort Collins, CO\n\nNovember 24 – The Commonwealth Room – South Salt Lake City, UT\n\nNovember 26 – The Bing Crosby Theater – Spokane, WA\n\nNovember 29 – Liberty Theatre – Astoria, OR\n\n* with Dave Matthews Band\n\nFollow Blind Pilot"
