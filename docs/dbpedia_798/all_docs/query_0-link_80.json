        "text": "12/12/17\n\nWhat do you make of Al Franken’s intention to resign? Is this the right thing for him to do?\n\n– Terry\n\nGiven that he was abandoned and denounced by his own party, with at least 35 fellow Democratic senators in effect refusing to work with him, he was effectively forced out. He would not have been able to do his job, and his ability to function as the smartest, most persistent, and effective interlocutor of the Trump administration would have been destroyed. Given what he did, and may have done, he could have fought it, with the tacit or explicit support of his party. But two state legislators in Minnesota, one Democratic and one Republican, had just been forced to resign, making the issue overwhelming at home (I was in Minnesota as the scandal unfolded, watching Franken’s resignation speech in the airport on my way home to California).\n\nI agree with Lucien Truscott IV [link] that this is a Democratic circular firing squad. I think Kirsten Gillibrand is sincere, but I think for Chuck Schumer it was all calculation about the—and I hate this word, but in this degraded context it’s accurate—Democratic brand, just as it’s clear that Republicans called on Moore to drop out—Ryan, McConnell, Cornyn, and even, at the start, Trump, in the “if these allegations are proved true” weasel out—only because they thought he’d lose. When it became clear it was likely he would win anyway, then it was, you know, up to the voters of Alabama. To elect a pro-slavery sexual predator. It won’t hurt among Republicans and other Trump voters. They’ve made it plain they’ll accept anything to keep the Trump show going and to indulge their delight in seeing America dissolved.\n\nMy fantasy is that Al runs for congress in the special election in November 2018 after Mark Dayton appoints a placeholder in January. But I wouldn’t want him to experience the humiliation of Anthony Wiener, to whom he can hardly be compared, except instrumentally.\n\nHere is what I wrote Al Franken the day he announced he would resign:\n\n7 December 2017\n\nDear Senator Franken,\n\nToday at the MSP airport my wife, Jenny, and I talked with the men working the shoeshine stand at Concourse E. We all spoke of our affection and respect for you. They mentioned the times you had patronized their stand, and before you Paul Wellstone, and the conversations you and he had had together in the airport.\n\nWe feel great sadness and loss in your resignation. You have been a great senator. You have asked questions no one else has asked, and refused to accept obfuscation, lies, or evasions in response. You have done this without self-aggrandizement, and with respect for the body of which you are a part. Your speech today was of a piece with your way of speaking throughout your political career: humble, calm, measured, direct, and without cutting corners, or making matters seem better or worse than they are. It is, these days, a very rare form of public speech.\n\nWe live most of the year in Oakland, and vote in California, so while we are in Minnesota part of the time, we have not voted for you. But we were here in 2008 when you were elected, when I was teaching at the U, and I have often thought of seeing some of my students carrying a huge FRANKEN manner across the campus.\n\nWe hope you will, as you promised, continue to make your voice heard. The state and the country will be poorer for your absence from the senate, but there are many other platforms, and many people who will want to hear what you have to say.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nGreil and Jenny Marcus\n\n12/12/17\n\nDo you believe that the best writer in America could write almost nothing but grocery lists?\n\n– Steve O’Neill\n\nMaybe. I’d have to see them. But check out the end of Umberto Eco’s Foucault’s Pendulum for another answer.\n\n12/12/17\n\nGiven how important the Band were to you, did you find anything in their solo work that approached their communal efforts? Any thoughts on Robbie Robertson’s last solo album, How to Become Clairvoyant?\n\n– Jay\n\nHow to Become Clairvoyant is by far Robbie’s best solo album. There’s a directness, a forthrightness, to the singing and the songwriting, and an absence of clutter in the music. But the real test is, do you go back to it, either in mind or by putting it on? In that sense, hardly anything—“Book Faded Brown” from Jubilation. Levon Helm’s Electric Dirt. But most of all, the YouTube album of a Levon and Rick Danko show from 1983, in a small club in Portland, Oregon, called The Living Room Tapes. Everything on it is lovely, with a soft touch, a sense of confidence in the songs, but “It Makes No Difference” is from another world. I never remotely grasped what a great song this is until I heard it from this night. I knew Rick, but I never understood how much of himself he never revealed until I played this over and over and over.\n\n12/12/17\n\nLately I have been thinking about different kinds of lyrics in rock music. I think one of the great joys of rock music is that lyrics may seem “difficult” or “simple.” Some artists has written songs with rather complicated lyrics. Lyrics which makes it hard to get an idea what the song is all about. I am not talking about “the meaning” of the song, rather what images the song gives you as a listener. Since English is not my main language some lyrics are even more difficult to grab. One of my favourite albums is Astral Weeks by Van Morrison but I still find it hard to tell what the lyrics says to me.\n\nBut some lyrics may seem very simple. Many early songs by the Beatles have rather simple lyrics like “She loves you, and you know you should be glad.” But sometimes the lyrics are not as simple as they seem. What about Ritchie Valens “Come On Let’s Go”? Come on and let’s do WHAT again and again?\n\nIsn’t this one of the great joys of rock music that even “simple” lyrics may be rather difficult to understand?\n\n– Christer\n\n“I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill” has always confused me. What’s so special about blueberries? As a friend said of the Angels’ “My Boyfriend’s Back”—“I don’t get it. Why is she bragging about her boyfriend’s back?”\n\nYes, it’s those that are far deeper conundrums than anything Bob Dylan ever wrote. You may not be able to figure out all the lyrics to “Memphis Blues Again” in terms of linear narrative, but they all make immediate emotional and metaphorical sense if you don’t ask what they mean. “Come on let’s go!”—where? As Diane Lane sings in Streets of Fire, “Nowhere Fast.”\n\n12/09/17\n\nMy father (born 1945 and white) said growing up in 1950s New Orleans there was so much local R&B on the radio that, for him and his friends, mainstream rockers like Buddy Holly and Jerry Lee Lewis seemed like marginal figures. Elvis was present but did not move them. Their world was black rock and roll made by blacks.\n\nThey loved doo wop and Chuck Berry, but the only non-New Orleans artist who broke inside, who made music they could claim alongside Fats Domino, Little Richard, and Huey Smith—the only musician who meant as much, if not more—was Ray Charles. “Mess Around,” “Lonely Avenue,” “Hallelujah I Love Her So,” and “What’d I Say” were epochal records, new species of life, but their favorite, and the first LP they saved up the money to buy, was 1958’s Ray Charles At Newport.\n\nFor these white middle class kids, Charles’ savage howling on “The Right Time” and, especially, the six wailing minutes of “I Got A Woman” were moments of transformative freedom. After school they would gather, transfixed, around the hi-fi console blaring this new live album from their hero. “What would y’all do?” I asked. Dad’s answer: “We would scream.” Fats Domino made fine music, but they wanted to BE Ray Charles.\n\nI wonder if you like this album, but I’m more interested in what you think of this story, both as a Ray Charles fan and as one who studies how American culture is formed. Does it surprise you that Ray Charles could be their towering figure, or that 1950s white middle class kids could be pulled so far into black music without any help from Elvis? Was there a different “giant wedding ceremony” happening here?\n\n– Randy\n\nRay Charles was the towering figure in the years before the Beatles. To me (born 1945, white) and my friends in the Bay Area, he didn’t seem like anyone you could be—he was a man apart, bigger than life, too handsome, too commanding, truly The Genius, a savant: “What’d I Say” seemed to contain all knowledge. Yes, Newport was the one—have you seen Bruce Conner’s overwhelming film Cosmic Ray based on Newport footage?—but for me it was the Recipe for Soul album—because it had “That Lucky Old Sun.”\n\nHe didn’t, for me, seem to be performing a giant wedding ceremony—between black and white—as Marion Keisker of Sun said of Elvis’s first record, except on Modern Sounds in Country and Western. He seemed above race. Almost from another planet.\n\n12/09/17\n\nA few Real Life Rock’s ago, you brought up the Rite of Spring. As someone who grew up with classical music in the house and who fell deeply into rock and roll later, I believe Stravinsky wrote this folk orchestral dance like a great set of popular songs. Melody after melody, hook after hook, it keeps coming back in killer repetitions, ripping you apart. It’s such a giant, intensely urgent beast over a hundred years later—as Lucy Gray conveyed so well—and it gets stuck in your head the more you listen. I was wondering more about your relationship to it—when it began, what it’s meant to you.\n\n– Joe\n\nI really can’t remember. Seems like it’s always been there.\n\n12/09/17\n\nDo you believe that the best writer in America could write almost nothing but record reviews?\n\n– Steve O’Neill\n\nSure.\n\n12/09/17\n\nDo you put any credence (sorry) in the idea that CCR were kept out of the #1 Billboard spot in some sort of deliberate blockage, maybe against independents or some other nonsense? All those #2s… as a chart-watching kid it always angered me on behalf of my favourite band, and it still feels suspicious all these years later.\n\n– Ian McGillis\n\nThey always thought so. Because their music was too crude. Because anyone could play it. And who ever heard of El Cerrito?\n\n12/09/17\n\nI was really happy to see The Drones mentioned here, and I when I went back to the Real Life Rock book I realized I’d missed you writing about them (and the Liddiard solo record) in the column. I think they’re a stunning band. I’m curious what you mean when you say that you’ve “worried about them” and whether that’s something you generally do (worry about rock bands) or if it’s something specific to them. Also curious what you think (if anything) about Camp Cope, another great Australian band.\n\n– Graham\n\nI worried that people wouldn’t hear them, that they would quit out of frustration. They pushed to extremes, they played with dangerous material, they went far enough into horror that at their highest pitch they might not have been sure where they stood—or realized it when they heard the playback. That might have scared them. I know it scared me.\n\n12/05/17\n\nIn the late 1980s punk and Lester Bangs (I came late to both, via Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung) led me to seek out the MC5. I think what I was really seeking was the cachet of knowing this (at the time) forgotten source of punk, but that was enough to bring me to their music.\n\nThe discovery was a thrill, but most of it has not aged well. Kick Out the Jams sounds like a clumsy mess (which didn’t register until I heard the X-Ray Spex’s Live at the Roxy, a moment of careening, shambolic energy hitting what the MC5 were aiming for, and much more). Back in the USA has some good songs and a spry rock & roll spirit but is undermined by its anemic production. Dave Marsh and Lenny Kaye make a promising case for High Time, and the sound is there, but even its best songs don’t stick.\n\nI still appreciate the MC5 as a band, and there are a few archival moments that capture and deliver their knockout power: the sheer crunching noise of the original 1968 Detroit single of “Looking At You” (with the Atlantic version right behind it), a jet-propelled live 1970 performance of “Kick Out the Jams” at Wayne State University (on YouTube), and “Power Trip,” a supercharged demo of High Time‘s “Skunk” without the absurd horns. I wish there was more.\n\nWhat do you make of the MC5’s music? What stands out for you today?\n\n– RL\n\nKick Out the Jams was a mess, but Rolling Stone had, very oddly, run a huge hype feature about the band so we went to see them when they played Berkeley. They were playing a place where fringe acts often went, since not everyone had even heard of the Finnish Brotherhood Hall, let alone knew where it was. The band made no sense to me, and no one in the crowd was reacting in any way, but after a number of songs Brother So-and-So appeared to announce that “We are not allowed to perform! We are being shut down! The police are here!” This was an obviously rehearsed shtick, where the band would bravely defy the authorities and keep playing (unless it was a way to get away from a dead audience), but since we knew there was no chance the Berkeley police were going to shut down a show like this, even over a neighborhood noise complaint, we didn’t stick around to find out.\n\nThere are some songs on Back in the USA that were initially hot, but that too didn’t make sense to me. Here’s Jon Landau producing, and in his writing, his musical values are clearly from R&B, soul music, the Rolling Stones—bass, rhythm, thick textures, and here’s this tinny sound? Why? How? And the concept—and the album was quickly all concept—of “we’re just a good time rock ‘n’ roll band with cool songs”—made it sound like either one or the other side of the band was a lie.\n\nThen came High Times and “Sister Anne” roared out the box and hit the way the band was always supposed to. It brought both the rebel and the good boy sides together and blew them both up. They sounded like they were having fun, too. This was prophetic music—what the CBGBs bands would be chasing. It’s more than seven minutes and I’m not sure there’s a need to hear anything else—the whole story of a band is here. I like the high school horn band exit, too, though they didn’t have to play out of tune to let us all know they know how uncool it is. And it goes on… and on… and on…\n\n12/05/17\n\nI was wondering if you have any fond memories of the band Marah? Kids In Philly, Angels Of Destruction!?\n\n– Heather\n\nA tough, fine band. You could hear their dedication in every song.\n\n12/05/17\n\nWith all these Bob Dylan “bootlegs” from Sony, why do you think so little live music from his Neverending Tour has been made available. I’ve seen some great shows with excellent bands and strong reinterpretations of his songs that I’d love to see memorialized.\n\n– Dave Wasser\n\nMaybe because there’s just too much for any sentient being to wrap his or her head around. There was a 9 CD Never-Ending Tour set—an actual bootleg, very lavish—from quite a few years out, all covers, organized by genres—and only one disc truly came to life, a collection of very old folk songs. I’ve seen memorable shows too—especially one right after Tempest came out, in uptown New York, where “Early Roman Kings” was an epic. Maybe put all ten thousand shows online and let people expire trying to find their way into that labyrinth, never mind out of it.\n\n12/05/17\n\nIn 1978, you wrote a terrific piece for New West on the (then) recent live broadcast of Bruce Springsteen at the Roxy. A line from that piece that stuck with me at the time was something along the lines of “the sound of the broadcast was so clear you could hear the grain on Max Weinberg’s woodblock.” Two or so years later, I had the occasion to interview Randy Newman (on his soundtrack to The Natural, if memory serves me well), and you and Mystery Train came up. I brought up that “woodblock” line. He had not read your Springsteen piece, but we had a mutual head shake of appreciative literary wonder at that great image. Two or so years later, in Newman’s song “My Life Is Good,” the following cropped up:\n\nMy wife and I\n\nWent to the hotel in the hills\n\nThat’s right\n\nThe Bel-Air Hotel\n\nWhere a very good friend of ours\n\nHappens to be staying\n\nAnd the name of that young man\n\nIs Mr. Bruce Springsteen\n\nThat’s right, yeah\n\nOh, we talked about some kind of woodblock or something\n\nJust thought you’d like to know, if you didn’t already! God does not roll dice.\n\n– Erik Nelson\n\nWow. What a wonderful story. Makes my day. Thanks for this.\n\n12/05/17\n\nI enjoyed reading your Van Morrison book recently. One thing I noticed was that you skipped over Wavelength in your evaluation—you neither condemned it with the 1980-1996 work (I love your line about the titles acting as warning labels!), nor did you include it in your admiration of his Them-1979 work. I’m just curious what you think. To me, it’s a very intentionally “pop” album that almost has an arena-rock sound, like Boston, or something, that strikes me as not a good sound for Van. But the music isn’t terrible either. Did you skip it on purpose, or is it just not worth mentioning?\n\nAlso, are you still looking for that beer?\n\n– Rob\n\nIt seemed whited out—no highs, no terrible lows. And nothing to say about it I was interested in putting into words.\n\nAs for the beer—it’s only available at certain pubs in the DC area, only on tap, so no art, and not now, since it’s a small batch and not currently in production. So there’s nothing to search for, except maybe a bar menu card for Right and Proper Brewing from Shaw Brew Pub.\n\n12/05/17\n\nAs far as I can tell Old Weird America Pale Ale is/was only available on tap, so no bottles or cans exist… out of curiosity, if you were able to get hold of one—the only one extant, say—would you drink it or keep it unopened?\n\n– Steve O’Neill\n\nOh, I’d taste it for sure.\n\n12/05/17\n\nThanks very much for answering my question regarding “A Brighter Summer Day. In response to your own question, the film was recently released on Blu-Ray by Criterion (I should have mentioned that in my question!). I hope you’ll enjoy it.\n\n– revelator60\n\nI’ll be looking.\n\n12/03/17\n\nHas any of Neil Young’s 21st Century work resonated with you? I keep hoping and buying, but for me nothing seems to stick for very long.\n\n– Jeff Vaca\n\nAmericana. A lot it is astounding, feverish, blowing up early ’60s folk hits until you think all the 19th Century really wanted was Crazy Horse—the band, the person it already had.\n\n12/02/17\n\nI return often to Dave Marsh’s The Heart of Rock & Soul: The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made. As a “long walk through one person’s taste, sense of history, idiosyncrasy, love and hate” (in your words), the book is compelling and enjoyable, with surprise discoveries, connections, and conversations flashing from hiding places everywhere.\n\nI don’t always find Marsh’s supporting mini-essays inspired or convincing, but his Sex Pistols entries are that and more. For someone who had little taste for punk (“What’s this doing here?” he begins), Marsh puts great thought, openness, and sincerity into fixing and fitting these singles into his R&B-centered musical universe, and I think it’s a valuable perspective.\n\nWhat is your response to his Sex Pistols entries? Did you ever discuss them with him?\n\n– Randy\n\nI was surprised at how empathetic, specific, and right Dave’s comments were. But the deepest thing he ever said about punk was his saying that Bruce Springsteen’s “Nebraska” had more in common with the Adverts’ “Gary Gilmore’s Eyes” than anything else.\n\n12/02/17\n\nMy question concerns a piece you wrote on Lana Del Rey’s album Ultraviolence, where you wrote, “Even if the artist starts out thinking she knows exactly what she means to say, the rich text, as I once read, resists not only the reader but the writer as well, and intent vanishes into the swirl of the songs.” Are there any particular books or essays that you recommend, perhaps the thing you “once read,” that are authorities on this relationship between art and its creator?\n\nI really liked what you wrote about Amy Winehouse’s Grammy performance along similar lines:”You could hear her listening to the song as well as singing it, hear the song talking to her, hear her asking herself, as she sang, ‘Is that true? Is that what I want? Is that all I’ve got?'” I am currently an undergraduate taking a class on Chaucer, and I found your writing really illuminating during a discussion in my class about The Pardoner’s Tale. I wonder if it’s something you’re familiar with or have thought about. The Pardoner is an abominable man, shamelessly swindling other people out of their money, no matter how poor his victims, by offering BS relics that promise to do ridiculous wonders for people and selling indulgences while he confesses that he does not care if the souls of the buyers go to hell. The complication is that he says, “For thogh myself be a ful vicious man,/A moral tale yet I yow telle kan,” and is truly an enthralling preacher. It’s why he’s such a successful swindler. In the Tales he tells a moral, surreal horror story of three bawdy men who set out to kill death, who has killed their friend. They get sidetracked by gold coins that they come across and, caught up in greed, they end up killing each other in their desire to have a larger share of the gold. This is the story the Pardoner uses on his victims, and it also completely implicates himself. In fact, the story’s power seems to come from the close relation between his own vices and the morality of the story. The fascinating question to me is, “Who’s the master, the tale or the teller?” He uses the story to get other people’s money, to fuel his own greed, but at the same time maybe he realizes he’s as fucked as the three men in the tale. Anyways, thought you might enjoy this.\n\n– Eric\n\nIt will take some time to dig up the article I quoted on “the rich text.” Part of my research for Lipstick Traces, and I’m not where it is. I don’t know of any books or essays on the approach we’re talking about.\n\nI love the Chaucer story. A student I had as a TA at Berkeley in the 1960s, Betsy Bowden, went on to write one of the first academic books on Bob Dylan, if not the first, Performed Literature, and then became a Chaucer scholar at Rutgers, and wrote books on his work. You’d find her interesting.\n\n12/02/17\n\nOne of my favourite comparisons of yours—one I found jarring at first—was when you called the Funky 4+1’s “That’s the Joint” “one of the richest and most exuberant pieces of rock ‘n’ roll vocal music since Music From Big Pink.” In your Mystery Train chapter on the Band you note how “voices yelp and wail as one man finishes another’s line or spins it off in a new direction”—I assume this sort of thing is what you had in mind with that comparison (correct me if I’m wrong). I’m wondering if you’ve heard good versions of this style from any direction whatsoever since “That’s the Joint” (1981)?\n\n– Scott Woods\n\nThere are a lot of cypher/freestyles that are in the same spirit. Not to mention the real progenitors of the style: Huey, Dewey, and Louie.\n\n12/02/17\n\nI got a kick out of reading that in 1963 you thought “Please Please Me” was by a group called The Beetles… I grew up in the 1970s with five older brothers and their record collections; until I was about ten years old I just assumed the insect was called a ‘beatle.’\n\n– Steve O’Neill\n\nPerfect.\n\n12/02/17\n\nI loved your comments on Abdurraqib’s piece on Kendrick Lamar’s “Alright.” I was wondering if you had any further thoughts you’d share about KL’s album To Pimp a Butterfly. The more I’ve listened, the more it feels like the greatest album I’ve heard in many years.\n\n– Joe\n\nIt’s great. I’m not remotely near the bottom.\n\n11/29/17\n\nThe four artists you chose for the main chapters of Mystery Train were still active at the time of the book’s publication, but your writing indicates that you were witnessing all of their suns setting. At this time, which if any of the Inheritors were you realistically hoping might produce a surprise comeback—with a moment of reversal like Some Girls or The Belle Album?\n\n– Randy\n\nI knew Randy Newman was anything but finished. Sly I had no hopes for—a feeling that unfortunately proved true. The Band I had hopes for, cut with real doubt: I knew how bad off Richard Manuel was, and I didn’t see the Band without him (or any of them). As for Elvis—well, so many Elvis fans like me wanted him to make a blues album, maybe with the Rolling Stones. Any reason why not? I wish I knew why I didn’t include him in the Masked Marauders. But really, as Dave Marsh put it when he died, I thought he would always be there.\n\n11/29/17\n\nIsn’t it about time you revised your pretentious—and DEEPLY uninsightful—July, 1970 RS review of The Who’s Live at Leeds? You were wrong on SO many levels, with all due respect.\n\n– David\n\nYou apparently want me to hear the album as you do. I don’t know how you hear it, so I have no idea what you’re objecting to. Want to be specific?\n\n11/29/17\n\nAn unusual (I hope) Elvis-related question: Have you seen Edward Yang’s film A Brighter Summer Day? It’s a four-hour epic set in early 1960s Taipei, during the “White Terror.” The main characters are high schoolers crazy about American music, and Elvis is present throughout: the title is a misheard line from “Are You Lonesome Tonight,” two of the hero’s friends cover his hits, and Elvis pops up again in an unforgettable way near the end. The film is a stringent, almost anti-nostalgic, drama, which makes its argument about the liberating power of rock’n’roll doubly effective. As Yang put it, “These songs made us think of freedom.”\n\n– revelator60\n\nI don’t know a thing about it. How can it be seen?\n\n11/25/17\n\nDo you still think “You’re Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go” is the “one certifiable stinker” on Blood on the Tracks, or has it grown on you? Personally, I have always loved its bittersweet poetry and breezy tune, but I am curious what about it offended or still offends your sensibilities.\n\n– Jay\n\nIt sounds the same to me. A soft, corny, obvious song that could have been written or sung by anyone, either saying of the hard, inventive, inspired songs that make up the album “I was only kidding” or, more likely, “I had this lying around, so why not?” Compared to anything else on the record, it’s so unconvincing.\n\n11/24/17\n\nIn his post re: Howlin’ Wolf, Randy quotes you on music in 1960-61 as being “so grey, so beige.” Yet in your liner notes to the Bobby Vee Legendary Masters collection and in your 1975 article on girl groups you discuss and praise a lot of the pop music of the early ’60s. I agree with that assessment—even if music from ’60 to ’64 may seem grey/beige in comparison to Presley/Lewis et al. and to Beatles/Stones et al. Have you resiled from your earlier opinion or do you still find merit and—more important—pleasure in e.g. The Shirelles and Gene Pitney?\n\n– Michael\n\nOf course great records were still being made. But not all of them were really heard—for instance, Gene Pitney’s “Every Breath I Take”—and more to the point, they didn’t always feel as great as they were. I thought Curtis Lee’s “Pretty Little Angel Eyes” was just fine on the radio but its utter fantasticness, the dynamic reversals, the too-fast-to-hear complex momentum, didn’t hit me until it appeared on a Phil Spector collection in the 1980s. The Chiffons’ “One Fine Day” and the Crystals’ “Da Doo Ron Ron,” either of which I’d happily be buried with, or be shot in the street waving a copy of while screaming “THIS IS THE GREATEST RECORD EVER MADE AND IF YOU DON’T AGREE SHOOT ME,” were like bursts of oxygen and freedom in a cold and closed world. “Beige”—I will never forget a San Francisco DJ whispering in about 1961, “Everything is beyyyyyyyy… gehuh… beige.” The records didn’t speak to each other. There was no sense of all sorts of people—people as odd as Bo Diddley and as, supposedly, conventional as the people who bought his records—caught up in a common conversation, and the subject of that conversation, which was in some sense unknown and unvoiced by the people involved, was living in a different America. The best essay on this is by Langdon Winner, “The Strange Death of Rock ‘n’ Roll,” in part the memoir of the keyboard person in a high-school San Luis Obispo rock ‘n’ roll band in the early ’60s. It appeared in Rock & Roll Will Stand, my first book (edited), in 1969. Should have been reprinted in all of the rock writing compendiums that have come out since, but as far as I know it hasn’t been.\n\nI can’t explain why, but I heard a change in August 1963, with Martha and the Vandellas’ “Heat Wave” and a record that was being played a lot in the Bay Area but not many other places, something called “Please Please Me” by a group that, we assumed, was called “The Beetles.” They seemed part of something bigger, something new. And there were extremes in them—in “Heat Wave,” the snap of the rhythm, in “Please Please Me,” the absolute joy and hurry and demand in the music—that were truly different, something you could feel other people would respond to, by wanting more out of their music, more out of their lives.\n\n11/24/17\n\nI’m curious about Bob Dylan’s “George Jackson.” Other songs of his—“Hattie Carroll”, “Hurricane”—that were topical when he wrote them still occupy space; “George Jackson” seems barely an echo now. As far as I can tell, the song, which made the top 40 when it was released in ’71, has only appeared on one domestically-released Dylan album since, a freebie bonus disc of rarities included with a Best of compilation. Interestingly enough, the only posting of the original recording I could find on YouTube (the acoustic version; I couldn’t find the big band version at all) comes from the indie-label collection Listen Whitey: the Sounds of Black Power 1967-1974 (cover photo: a shirtless Huey Newton holding a copy of Highway 61 Revisited). I’ve never heard “George Jackson” on the radio or used in a movie soundtrack, never seen it mentioned in any recent written discussion of Dylan and his work.\n\nThis is all the more puzzling since I gather “George Jackson” generated some contention in its day. From what I understand (sorry for all the qualifiers but it was a bit before my time) there was questioning of Dylan’s motives for writing the song, suspicion that he was just paying lip-service to “the Movement” to get the Webermans of the world off his back, or something. Lester Bangs was pretty brutal: as far as Dylan was concerned, he wrote, Jackson was just “another human life to exploit for his own purposes.”\n\nMe, I hear “George Jackson” as Dylan at his most wounded and unguarded. What’s your opinion of the song, in terms of both musical quality and sincerity? Do you have any idea as to what accounts for its near-obscurity (if you even agree with that characterization—maybe I’ve just been listening in the wrong places)? And what do you think of Steel Pulse’s reggae version?\n\n– Steve O’Neill\n\nI never doubted the sincerity of the song. I assume Dylan read George Jackson’s book and was seduced as so many were, myself included. Why hasn’t the song gone on to live a life, as–as you say—“The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll” and even “Hurricane” have? “Hurricane,” despite the clumsiness all over it, musically, lyrically, has a great feeling of hurry, got to get this out right now, a life is at stake—when I think of the song I hear Scarlet Rivera’s whiplash violin between verses, just jerking my head back. “Hattie Carroll” is one of Dylan’s great songs—elegant, detailed, profoundly empathetic, hard to take, perfectly delivered, about something real—making sure, and this might have been his motive, though it might have sounded silly to say so, that the names of Hattie Carroll and William Zantzinger were, in their different ways, never forgotten. “George Jackson,” as a song, doesn’t have any of those extremes. It was, I think, a way of saying, this matters to me. I have the chance to say something and I will. But perhaps just as important, Jackson’s reputation too fell to ruins. He proclaimed his innocence in the murder of the guard at Soledad. He was guilty. He was a figure of great physical, moral, and sexual charisma who brought many people into the prison-rights movement, and the theory that in the revolution those who had most deeply suffered the predations of the state were the vanguard, and so activists, especially white activists, but also the Black Panthers, had to accept their wisdom and follow their lead. The movement was deeply infiltrated by the FBI and state intelligence agencies. Who knows who was really behind, or part of, the plot to bring a gun into the prison, which led to Jackson’s prison break murders and his own death? And Angela Davis’s love affair with Jackson, and her involvement in the Marin County shoot-out that followed? Read Jo Durden-Smith’s Who Killed George Jackson for a sense of the labyrinth that swallowed up the song—which, if I remember correctly, isn’t even mentioned.\n\n11/24/17\n\nHow does War sound to you today? I agree that “Slippin’ Into Darkness” is their eternal track, but I think their 1976 Greatest Hits album has aged gracefully and now feels like an irresistible, organic triumph: not a wasted cut, bursting with variety and flavors, and a fine version of what There’s A Riot Goin’ On did to black music—or maybe even black America—before disco completely took over. But even among the tough stuff I hear humor, friendliness, good times. The rhythms of “Me and Baby Brother” are full of pleasure. Doesn’t “Why Can’t We Be Friends” make you smile? Isn’t “Summer” a sublime reverie?\n\n– RL\n\nI can only agree. Only you didn’t mention “Cisco Kid.”\n\n11/22/17\n\nI’ve been listening constantly to the solo version of “Feel Like Going Home” by Charlie Rich, pretty much since the election. Rich has always been a personal favorite since I was introduced to his music by you and Peter Guralnick.\n\nI was wondering if you’d ever had the chance to speak with Rich, and where you’d fit him in the scope of Southern music.\n\n– David McClure\n\nI met Charlie Rich to shake hands with in Memphis, when he performed as the recipient of a Memphis Music Award. He died soon after. I don’t think he ever fit, either expectations or genres, unless it was a two person genre made up of himself and Joe Tex. He and his wife Margaret Ann were songwriters, and he was a soul singer. “Mohair Sam” is a wonderful record but in a lot of ways a complete anomaly. “Life Has Its Little Ups and Downs” was where his music was always going. I like what he said about why he didn’t like “happy music”: “I don’t think it says anything.”\n\n11/22/17\n\nI really enjoy reading your Real Life Rock Top 10. My friend, who is an especially huge fan, is quick to send them to me. I appreciate your wittiness and the way in which you engage your readers. Plus, I always learn something new. My question is in regards to: Eminem: “The Storm,” on BET Hip Hop Awards (BET, October 10).\n\nCan you explain what you mean by Eminem’s solo attack being “more frightening to me than anything that Donald Trump has said in the last year or that anyone else has said about him.”? I’ve read this section several times and I am not sure I understand exactly what you are trying to communicate.\n\nThank you.\n\n– Tracy from Maryland\n\nIt had an intensity, a sense of shock, that cut right to my heart and past it.\n\n11/22/17\n\nIn 1960-1961, Howlin’ Wolf recorded “Wang Dang Doodle,” “Back Door Man,” “Spoonful,” “Down in the Bottom,” “Shake for Me,” “You’ll Be Mine,” and “Going Down Slow.” Are you bewildered at this, how he could make this earth-rattling music (I think his best) at age 50, a decade after his first record—and during this era, when most of rock had turned, as you wrote, “so grey, so beige”?\n\nAlso, when and how were you first exposed to Howlin’ Wolf’s music, and how did you respond?\n\n– Randy\n\nI was first exposed to just that music—The Rockin’ Chair Album. I fell on the floor. I never thought about his age—I must have thought 30. I didn’t know anything. My God.\n\n11/22/17\n\nI read Soul Music and its Double or… (04/16/16) with great interest. I’m in complete agreement with the idea that “over-souling” has turned soul music as it’s sung by far too many of today’s singers into its opposite—reduced it to a set of techniques that has destroyed the essence of the song—and does nothing but call attention to the singer’s egotistical drive to outdo another singer. Overall this certainly fits Manny Farber’s concept of “hard-sell art.” But doesn’t it also fit his concept of termite art*: Melisma eating itself—competitively pushing past its own boundaries—for the sake of nothing other than pushing past its own boundaries?—with no concern that the work as a whole has been stood on its head and destroyed?. If you allow that melismatic madness has “termite” aspects—doesn’t that compromise the Farber distinctions as they might apply to today’s music scene? Too much melisma is, I think, really about competition among singers—with no care or awareness of the larger goals. I know at least one of the over-riffers that I hear who cites Stevie Wonder and Donny Hathaway as formative influences.\n\nWhere, when, and who would you charge as the main culprits in this decline?\n\nUnfortunately people today like these empty displays of “technique.” And, for all I know, maybe they always did in all genres.\n\nUltimately, like in so many other things, it’s the “voters'” fault for contemporary conditions.\n\n*Farber, in the essay you refer to, says “A peculiar fact about termite-tapeworm-fungus-moss art is that it goes always forward eating its own boundaries (my emphasis) and, likely as not leaves nothing in its path other than the signs of eager, industrious, unkempt activity.”\n\n– David Rabinovitz\n\nThe difference is that the termite doesn’t care where its going, it has no goal, it’s just eating away—and the over-souler knows exactly where he or she is going: to the bank. That’s the idea, anyway; that’s the goal. To me over-souling is the epitome of termite art’s opposite, white elephant art: a house constantly being overburdened by more rooms, lattice-work, gables and balconies, all painted with gold trim. And inside? You wouldn’t want to go inside.\n\n11/17/17\n\nThank you for your reply to my post regarding the whole Bill Clinton-sexual-misconduct-allegations issue—it was a much more measured and respectful response than my rant probably deserved. (Although I did seem to rattle you into making a rare grammatical error—something to brag to the grandkids about). I can’t argue with your main point—Juanita Broaddrick joining Donald Trump’s pre-debate parade of Clinton accusers does make her guilty of having a double standard. That fact, though, is rendered largely unimportant by either possible answer to the simple, enormous question central to all this: is Broaddrick being truthful when she says that Bill Clinton raped her?\n\nIf the answer to that question is yes, then Broaddrick aligned herself with an asshole who spoke in the abstract about sexually assaulting women in order to turn the heat up on the man who brutally raped her and then skated on it for forty years; a hypocrisy most could understand.\n\nIf the answer is no, then Broaddrick is a sociopath who spent twenty years trying to ruin a man’s life in the most malicious way possible, and hypocrisy is the least of her crimes.\n\nHere’s a question you can answer, even if it’s a ridiculous hypothetical one: if the unimaginable happened, if Bill Clinton admitted to the rape of Juanita Broaddrick, copped to the whole mattress-pinning, lip-biting scenario… would you still fault Broaddrick for letting herself be used by Donald Trump?\n\n– Jackie\n\nYes.\n\n11/16/17\n\nI’ve always had a grudging admiration for your willful (proud?) cultivation of a blind spot toward Bill Clinton, but you may have outdone yourself in your response to Robert Fiore. The recent re-examination of possible sexual abuse by Clinton is “a rush to judgment”? So obvious, when you think of it… I mean, it’s a scant twenty years that Juanita Broaddrick’s been claiming publicly that Clinton raped her twenty years before that—whoa, folks, what’s the all-fired hurry? I also enjoyed the frisson that just days after John Oliver’s takedown of “whataboutism” from Trump supporters, you took the time to remind us that Trump actually bragged about his own degeneracy rather than keeping it on the downlow, like a gentleman. And the only Clinton accuser you referenced by name was the lying opportunist Kathleen Willey.\n\nWell, Donald Trump will get his comeuppance one day (hopefully it won’t take twenty, or forty, years), Juanita Broaddrick isn’t Kathleen Willey, and while Monica Lewinsky wasn’t a Clinton accuser, she was a Clinton victim: if he didn’t prove that by his casual use of her as a receptacle—you know that’s how he thought of it—he sure as shit did with his finger-jabbing demonization of her on TV. If that little number didn’t tear the scales from your eyes I don’t expect anything will, but if I were you I’d prepare for a rough couple of months.\n\nBill Clinton may indeed be a political stand-in for Elvis Presley, but I’ve a feeling that for him history is going to be more Goldman than Guralnick.\n\n– Jackie\n\nJust as I would not give a pass to a Trump voter “who likes what he says about people left out and left behind”—in other words, who have no problem with a candidate and then a president who stands for white supremacy—I don’t give a pass to someone who, to buttress her claim against a former president, is willing if not eager to be used by a presidential candidate who affirms his right to sexually assault any woman he chooses—though Broaddrick would have been safe around him, because, as he said in different words about a woman who accused him (“She wouldn’t be my first choice”), she’s too old and looks it. Though there are plenty of things Bill Clinton did as president I find reprehensible, you say I have a double standard, and I may—but so does Juanita Broaddrick.\n\n11/16/17\n\nDid the Pogues ever mean anything to you? If memory serves, you once made a fairly admiring remark about their contribution to—Egad!—a tribute album titled The Last Temptation of Elvis.\n\n– Edward\n\nThey had a great sense of humor, but they were too drunk to function. I once spent an unpleasant afternoon with Cait O’Riordan who was so ruined she couldn’t talk or leave.\n\n11/16/17\n\nWhat effect do you think an artist’s personal misconduct should have on one’s view of his work? I recall reading an essay by Clive James on Jorge Luis Borges which argued that our view of his fiction ought to be colored by the author’s collaboration with authoritarian regimes—that punishment for his misdeeds ought to be exacted against his work. I was wondering also in view of what you’ve written about Bill Clinton what you think about the current argument that he should suffer a reckoning of some sort for his mistreatment of women. I remember back when we were all discussing whether Clinton should be impeached for lying under oath, I used to make what I called the Michael Jordan Analogy. Say you were a fan of the Chicago Bulls. Michael Jordan is draining shots from all parts of the court. However, it appears that he has committed his sixth foul, which means he must be ejected from the game. While you might well say that rules are rules and we have to abide by them, what you are not going to be saying is, “Get that hacking son of a bitch off the court! How dare he sully the name of Chicago Bull with his unsportsmanlike conduct?” And you might be tempted to look favorably on any rationale that would allow him to stay in the game.\n\n– Robert Fiore\n\nI don’t know the Clive James essay. If he was saying that Borges’s work was, or must have been, affected by his attempt to curry favor with, protect himself from, or advance the goals of regimes that oppressed, censored, kidnapped, murdered, and disappeared other writers, let alone any other sort of persons, then that seems to me politically moral and intellectually necessary: you have to go back and look at his work and see what’s there, and what isn’t. And the same holds true for, say, French writers, filmmakers, and any other sorts of artists who continued to work publicly during the Nazi occupation. And when, or if, we are able to look back, the same may be true of American writers and artists.\n\nIf James meant, as you say, that writers (we’ll just keep it there for convenience’s sake) ought to be punished for what (again for convenience’s sake) we’ll call collaboration (or collaborative self-censorship or deformation), by having their work taken out of print, banned, shamed, removed from syllabuses, and so on, that’s absurd. We can rewrite history but we should not unwrite it, and in any case I don’t think history is the proper plane on which to judge. There are writers (again, filmmakers, painters, composers, singers) with destructive and corrupt perversions and political instincts whose work may include attempts, conscious or not, to escape, deny, or damn those proclivities. Again, while this is not the right plane on which to judge, it might lead to the right place: ultimately a work lives its own life in the world, which it may, in some tiny or even not tiny way, have affected—made. If it is self-evidently a morally corrupt act of self-defense and self-congratulation, that is unlikely to happen, at least over any amount of time, and ought to be attacked as such, as, say, Woody Allen movies ought to be and aren’t (but then, I don’t like Woody Allen movies since Annie Hall anyway). What the work does and what happens to it out in the world is an open, complex, and interesting question. The work, if it deserves that word at all, is not the author. It’s reductionist and anti-intellectual to think so and an aesthetically corrupt way to live.\n\nWith Bill Clinton, I think there is, suddenly, a rush to judgment, right now, to let no stone go unturned. I think it ought to be remembered that the accusations against him by the women Donald Trump was able to sign up, if not pay off, to counter the scandal over his taped bragging that he could and as a matter of course did get away with anything, and I think more important to him than countering any scandal, to humiliate Hillary Clinton before the second presidential debate last year, either to throw her off or, I believe, just for the pleasure of humiliating her, have to be seen (I realize that this is an absurdly convoluted sentence, but I think it scans, so please bear with me) in the context of, it not part of, the enormous scandal-machine, the accurately described vast right-wing conspiracy, to destroy Bill Clinton. Remember the Clinton hit lists, the body-counts, which claimed more than twenty murders on the part of the Clintons during Bill Clinton’s years as governor of Arkansas and after? Remember that much of what has been said by Clinton’s accusers—and Monica Lewinsky was not an accuser—fits perfectly with the narrative that had been constructed before they came, or were brought forward, and that the word narrative, in political use if not standard definition, means constructed, which is to say false, story? Some people find the sexual harassment and worse described by Kathleen Wiley credible. Do her claims that the Clintons had not only her husband but her pet killed buttress the credibility of her sexual accusations or, you know, make you laugh?\n\nI can’t follow your Michael Jordan analogy at all. Unless they’re meant to injure, fouls are not son-of-a-bitching, sullying, or unsportsmanlike conduct. They’re a strategic part of the game. Some players, like Larry Bird and Michael Jordan, got a pass. Dennis Rodman did not.\n\n11/16/17\n\nI love D.A. Pennebaker’s documentary on Sondheim’s Company cast recording. It’s one of the more fascinating documentaries about a recording process. Any thoughts on this film? While most musical theater rubs me the wrong way, I count Sondheim as a huge exception and a major American artist, not just onstage, but on record. How does his work feel to you?\n\n– Joe\n\nI don’t know anything about this film. Sondheim means nothing to me. Blank spots.\n\n11/14/17\n\nSeveral years ago, filmmaker John Sayles came through town on a promotional tour for his movie Honeydripper. During his q&a session, he stated that one of the lines in his movie was based on Elvis saying something to the effect of “the only things black people are good for is buying my records and shining my shoes.” This always seemed to me to be an urban legend, as Elvis was never known for verbal arrogance, at least until the pills took over. Peter Guralnick confirmed this suspicion in Last Train To Memphis, detailing the misty origins of the legend in early 1957 and Elvis’ granting of an interview with (I think) Jet magazine to refute the story. As John Sayles has spent a career doing films based on historical incidents, I suspect he knows fully well how untrustworthy the story always was, but found it useful as an example of white theft of African American culture and a convenient buttress to the movie’s point. You went on a well-known crusade of refuting Albert Goldman’s misquoting of Sam Phillips’ “if I could find a white man with the Negro sound…” utterance, so my questions are: what are your thoughts on this, and how has this story gained so much traction over the years?\n\n– Jim Cavender\n\nThere are other variations, of course. “The only thing niggers are good for…” I first encountered this full-face in 1991, when I was on a book tour in the south for my book Dead Elvis. Every black person I met—in bookstores, TV interviewers, critics—brought this story up, as fact. It struck me as completely out of character, but the certainty of the people I’d met—this absolutely defined, and buried, Elvis as far as they cared—was upsetting. Peter and I talked a lot about it. We agreed that it wasn’t inconceivable that Elvis could have said it, but starting with the original notice in Jet magazine and going forward (and even backward) from there, Peter found no evidence that he ever did say it. Elvis might as well have said he hoped Mahalia Jackson would be the first black president—that’s just as likely. Who knows he didn’t say that?\n\n11/14/17\n\nIt seems that you have written relatively little about Bob Dylan’s “Christian period.” Any thoughts you’d like to share now that we have the new box set Trouble No More” And any thoughts on how his Christianity—temporary or permanent, take your pick—has informed his post-1981 music? I was really hoping we’d someday get a book by you on the subject, but I think I read that you are not planning to write any more books on Dylan. (And if you have written any extended pieces on Christian Bob, can you provide a link?)\n\n– Jay\n\nI wrote about Slow Train Coming and various shorter pieces on different Evangelical concerts, all collected in my Bob Dylan by Greil Marcus book. Looking through it in light of the new set of Christian music, I was surprised to see how closely my responses then track mine now: the material from the second to last of his initial 1979 religious shows is just as vibrant and inventive as the one I saw one night later. “Pressing On” is still a revelation.\n\nI don’t think any of this has ever left him. The ideological construct he built, the religious insanity of his end-times sermons, that may have receded, but the roots were always there and they became thicker, more twisted, and that comes out in many ways. But the strongest thought on all of this I’ve ever heard came from Amy Vecchione, a student in my first class, on “Prophecy and the American Voice,” at Berkeley in 2000. We were discussing both Saved: The Gospel Speeches of Bob Dylan, edited by Clinton Heylin and published in 1990 by Hanuman Books, and Time Out of Mind. People were talking about the album as a set of songs about romantic betrayal when Amy said, “No, it’s not about a love affair. Not the kind we’re talking about. He’s been betrayed by God. He’s found out that the answers he believed in aren’t real. He’s fallen out of love with Jesus. That’s what’s happening here. That’s why the sense of loss is so absolute.”\n\n11/14/17\n\nSo many brainiacs weighing in on Dylan’s spirituality! Do you care? (I don’t, except that we got some great “new” music on Trouble No More, and songs are the reason we’re here, right?) I’m wondering if anybody has written lately about the Christmas albums, especially Christmas in the Heart, in this context. (Admittedly, Christmas and spirituality don’t have much in common here these days.) Lloyd Fonvielle wrote about the album best, if humorlessly. I agree with him about the “Adeste Fidelis,” it is as beautiful and moving as possible.\n\nBut I also like the back cover art. I guess Dylan’s idea of fun is as confounding as his ideas about everything else. Can you wrap your head around this holiday novelty?. Time to put an egg in my shoe and beat it, I guess.\n\n– Laura Leivick\n\nAs far as Bettie Page goes, I wish. I never got all the way through the Christmas album. I went out caroling too in my Boy Scout days. It was fun. But I wouldn’t want to listen to an album of that either.\n\n11/14/17\n\nI am always interested in the backstory or inspiration of music I like. Dylan’s “Visions of Johanna” is one of my favorites for the atmosphere it sets. Doing some research, I learned it was likely written in Nov 1965 in the Chelsea Hotel in NYC. Interestingly, the Northeast blackout occurred on Nov 9, 1965. Reviewing the lyrics, the blackout could have inspired such phrases as “we sit here stranded,” “lights flickering in the opposite loft,” “ghost of ‘lectricity”, “really nothing to turn off,” “watchman clicks his flashlight” and several others. I also experienced the blackout and it was really eerie as the whole city just went pitch black and everything just shut down. The song is beautiful and complex and I’m not attempting to assign any specific meaning to it. However, do you think the mood it sets might have been inspired by the ’65 blackout?\n\n– Ted Foster\n\nPeople have long thought that. Especially New York people. I’m not aware that Dylan has said anything about it. More interesting to me are the many different attempts he made at recording it before finally settling on the Nashville Blonde On Blonde version—and then, on later pressings, ending up with a signature guitar slash near the end, either because Dylan, or someone, found it too obvious, like italicizing a word for emphasis and later realizing the internal rhythm of the sentence has already created the emphasis so you don’t need to overdo it, or because someone pressed the wrong button.\n\n11/14/17\n\nYou must have talked with many people who think technical virtuosity is the measure of a rock musician (as in, potency) and are drawn to music that is “difficult” to play. Sometimes this is an obnoxious elitism, which you touched on in your Creedence answer of 3/24/17, but sometimes it’s just an honest preference.\n\nIt’s pointless to debate the superiority or rightness/wrongness of one’s tastes or responses to music—to each his/her own, I think we would all agree—but do you find it challenging to hold a conversation with people who hear rock music this way? That is, does it seem like two different languages are being spoken?\n\n– Randy\n\nIt’s been a long time since I encountered anyone who argued that technical virtuosity is the key–or even a key–to better music.\n\n11/14/17\n\nPitchfork has run an interview with Grant Hart, done shortly before his death. Basically a reminiscence of his childhood, it’s bitter and funny (“[My father] was in the Greatest Generation, and he wouldn’t let you forget it”) and moving in a way I wanted Springsteen’s autobiography to be. I don’t thing I’ve read anything by you on Husker Du—were they important to you at all?\n\n– Steve O’Neill\n\nMostly “Diane.” Whenever I listen to them I just want to hear that.\n\n11/09/17\n\nAre you as worried as shit as I am about the future of the Democratic Party? Could Donna Brazile (not to pin this all on her) have chosen a worse time to escalate a new Clinton-Bernie war? Where is the hope, if anywhere?\n\n– Terry\n\nWhat’s most interesting to me about the results of the Tuesday elections is that the question of identity politics has been completely misconstrued both by mainstream media and the debates among Democratic pundits. Tuesday saw the election of all sorts of non-white or non-western people to state and local offices—whether the new Liberian mayor in Montana, the Sikh mayor in New Jersey, and more, not to mention the headbanger transgender legislator in Virginia whose band describes itself as “drunken metal” and their songs as “about drinking.” None of these people ran on their ethnicity, none were elected with identitarian support, all ran and were elected as ordinary American candidates. If there’s a hint of a good future, that’s it.\n\nI’ve read excerpts from the Brazile book—until I gave up in the slough of self-serving, self-aggrandizing noise. I don’t doubt much of what she says about the way she was treated by Clinton campaign heads or what she says about the atmosphere of the campaign itself. But her going full-Bern on attempting to construe the Clinton rescue of the DNC as rigging—and really, if the primary was rigged, where did all those Sanders victories come from?—and saying that while it really was her responsibility to kick Clinton—and the perfectly qualified and legitimately nominated Tim Kaine—off the ticket, but she refrained from doing so to not hurt the feelings of “women”—well, that would have worked, right?\n\nThe real scandal in her book is her account of the consequences of Obama’s absenting himself from the Democratic Party, which was evident from the start of his first term. The refusal of his campaign to in essence merge with the DNC and provide it with all of its information about voters and volunteers, and to work with it to support turnout in the 2010 and 2014 elections, and to ensure strong and sustained fund-raising, leaving the DNC in debt in 2016, was ruinous. And no one’s asked him about that.\n\n11/09/17\n\nDid your understanding or estimation of America change, in any fundamental way, with Trump’s election? Do you see him more as just the latest (perhaps the most grotesque) manifestation of an American type that we’ve never really done without, or does his capture of the Presidency (and what he’s done with it over the past year) represent something genuinely unprecedented, in terms of his effect on our political discourse and culture?\n\n– R.L.\n\nI don’t know that my understanding of America changed. Two of my lodestone texts on American politics are Sinclair Lewis’s 1935 novel It Can’t Happen Here, about the election of a western populist—“Buzz” Windrip—running on a fascist platform, and the dissolution of America into a hell of racist militias and murderous mobs, with the government all but dissolved, and Philip Roth’s 2004 novel The Plot Against America, where Charles Lindbergh is elected president in 1940 and makes common cause with Nazi Germany while turning the USA into a land of anti-semitic pogroms (until FDR comes riding over the hill again with the cavalry and everything goes back to normal, which is kind of a cheat). While Trump still, as a plain fact, makes any sense of everyday reality nearly impossible, as a figure he was not unthinkable—he had been thought.\n\nBut there is only a bare precedent in the first years of the Reagan administration for the dismantling of government that is, I think, the real goal of Trump and the people around him. Without public government there will be effective government by corporations and private money: such institutions, never before understood as such, but that’s what the Trump Company, exercising, say, unchecked eminent domain wherever it likes, or the Adleson, Mercer, and Koch fortunes, directing city and state governments as well as replacing the Republican Party, will make decisions previously considered to be in the public domain, would effectively be. I think that’s the real goal playing out here—and depriving the existing constitutional government of revenue, through the Republican tax bill, is very much part of this. This is what “rolling back burdensome regulations” really means.\n\nIt was a good while ago, when one could read that Bill Gates’s personal fortune had passed some landmark figure—it could have been $50 billion, or maybe even $20 billion—that I realized people were amassing too much money. From the time of the New Deal through the 1950s, the top marginal tax rate was 90%—Col. Parker once said it was his patriotic duty to keep Elvis at 90%. While many rich people did not pay that much, they paid a significant portion of their income, and nearly an infinity more than rich people do now. That fostered not only an income equality incomprehensible today, but a sense of patriotism and common purpose. A steelworker could afford a house and two cars, and public college, because tax revenues were high, was often effectively free of any form of tuition. The purpose of the tax code was, among other things, to underwrite a robust public government AND to prevent some people from getting too rich–so rich they could dominate the nation.\n\nBut when one individual, like Bill Gates–or one family, like the Waltons or the Mercers or the Adelsons–has tens of billions of dollars, then they are in a position to FULLY FUND candidates in every electoral race in the country in any given year–on the presidential, US House and Senate, gubernatorial, state legislative, mayoral, council, board, referendum, and even tax district levels–without even feeling a pinch. That means, in a democracy, that some people have enough money to obviate democracy, and that means some people have too much money. Once it was common for people to be proud of paying high taxes: “It means I’m doing well,” was what many people said. Now taxes are considered evil, and not even necessary evil. It is common for activists and legislators to be described as “anti-tax.” Which means they want no public government, but government by corporations and private money.\n\nThe person to follow on this is Gabriel Zucman of Berkeley.\n\n11/09/17\n\nEdmund Wilson learned Hebrew to write about the Dead Sea Scrolls, and you learned French to write about the Situationists. How did you go about it? Just out of workbooks, or were other methods (tutors, Rosetta Stone) involved?\n\n– Devin McKinney\n\nWell, I taught myself to read and translate French (with a wasted backdrop of Menlo-Atherton High School French, with a teacher who today would have been fired his first day for how he treated the girls in the class—he would have said, “I’m French, you know,” as Roland Barthes does to get away with everything in Percival Everett’s Glyph, even though he was Belgian—and who I encountered behind the bar at the Monkey Inn in Oakland the year after I graduated. I didn’t even show him my fake ID; he knew who I was, I knew teachers weren’t supposed to moonlight as bartenders, so I asked for a beer and he gave it to me and I never saw him again). But I never learned to speak it.\n\nBut yes—I just sat down with an Oxford French-English dictionary, and then a lot more—slang dictionaries, archaic French dictionaries—and within a few months there was a change. I know the day: I’m staring at an idiomatic phrase, trying to tease it away from a literal translation, which says nothing, and then “Birds of a feather flock together” pops into my head, and after that the pages opened up, and every old newsletter or manifesto or news story was a philosophical Rosetta Stone. I later had some passages I’d translated for Lipstick Traces retranslated by a professional; mine were sometimes better, because I could write better English and had a better ear for rhythm, just like there are passages in James Brook’s translation of Guy Debord’s Panegyrique that are better in English than they are in French.\n\n11/09/17\n\nThe soundtrack to The Vietnam War doesn’t bother me, but one thing I notice is the nearly complete absence of country music. I’m given to understand that country was one of the main things you’d be hearing over there. The only cut I would say surprised me is “Blues Run the Game” by Nick Drake. But another thing I recall reading is that when they first came out Drake’s albums sold in the low three figures.\n\n– Robert Fiore\n\nI know “Blues Run the Game” by the odd folk singer Jackson C. Frank, who worshipped Elvis and recorded an odd version of “Mole in the Ground” that was later covered by Marianne Faithfull. I don’t know the Nick Drake version of the Frank song. Why wasn’t country music all over the documentary the way, say, Marvin Gaye was? Maybe because country music was rarely Top 40 at that time, while Motown, Stax, and more was? Maybe because country music on Armed Services Radio would be divisive? Which isn’t to say African-American soldiers didn’t often love country songs the way Charlie Parker and Richard Berry did.\n\n11/09/17\n\nI was happy to see your affection for 1969: The Velvet Underground Live. I had spent years losing myself in the band’s studio recordings, and then, with nothing left to discover, I bought this, and it became my favorite. I hear many definitive versions of songs from every VU album (which is to say, era) and lost delights like “Lisa Says,” but best of all are the pre-Loaded performances, with Maureen Tucker’s drums, of signature Loaded tracks, and on top is “New Age”—I’ve never heard chord changes swell and crash with such enormous waves of emotion. (And then you hear about twenty people clap.)\n\nWhich brings us to 2015’s The Complete Matrix Tapes. Taken from pristine, superbly mixed soundboard reels at the same shows, this long-awaited collection meant to fulfill every promise made by the famously imperfect sound of 1969 Live—and yet, much of the feeling is wiped clean: it seems less dimensional, less full of blood and color, less crackling with thrill and mystery, less glowing with warmth and life.\n\nI hope I’m all wrong; I feel like I must be. What do you think about The Complete Matrix Tapes? Should I listen again?\n\n– RL\n\nNo, you’re right. It’s a great disappointment.\n\n11/09/17\n\nWho is the most musically knowledgeable rock critic, in your opinion? When I have music questions I ask my friend John Duesenberry, who composes electronic music and is conversant in the blues, Bob, you name it. When Bob sang “Free Fallin,'” somebody noted that he sounded different because “he was singing in his high register.” I was so startled by the sound I thought maybe the audio had been enhanced. JD wrote, “”The song itself is little more than a one-note chant, so it’s probably not that challenging for BD. He is singing 3 notes thru almost the whole song— middle C and the E & F above it. The melody also drops an octave to the C below that. He seems to be in good voice and in tune in this range, but he’s straining for the F sometimes, and he sounds a lot weaker on the lower note. BD finesses this by doing a rock ’n’ roll growl on the higher notes, and sliding down into the lower note. In general his timing and attack are good but he’s certainly not belting it out. Sounds better than the croak-and-rasp he’s been doing in recent years, but it sounds like a natural performance to me. The mix is a bit sloppy in general IMHO.”\n\nThen I found this version of “Rocks and Gravel,” which Bob sings “Moonshiner”-sweet, an obvious antecedent of “It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry,” though that song’s roots are so deep in the blues we’ll probably never dig ’em up.\n\nSo I went looking for Mance Lipscomb (bless you again for introducing me to him!). Get this [editor’s note: video linked to not available]:\n\nNot the same song, not even close it seems to me. But thrilling. The key sounded unusual and I couldn’t fathom the complex, experimental sound. Here’s JD:\n\n“He’s doing the song in the key of F IMHO (not exactly in tune w/a concert piano F but close enough). But I’m not sure that’s what you were asking. I think he might have the strings tuned to a non-standard tuning with the bottom string tuned to F. (Still with me?) He’s continually picking on that low F, almost like a drum. At the same time he’s finger-picking at least two other patterns, and there are some ‘dissonances’ resulting. (Maybe that sounds ‘experimental’?) One of these patterns doubles his vocal line. He does all this pretty consistently in every verse.\n\n“In short, he’s doing the work of 2 or 3 guitarists. He’s a mutant! I love this guy.\n\n“If he were just strumming chords, it would sound like a pretty standard blues progression, similar to ‘Rollin’ and Tumblin’’ or ‘Divin’ Duck.’ But he is sort of ‘implying’ the chords.”\n\nClear as a bell, right?\n\n– Laura Leivick\n\nWho’s the most knowledgeable? In terms of formal musical analysis, Jon Pareles and John Rockwell can do what your friend John Duesenberry can do, if not more. As far as knowing everything goes, Jon Caramanica in the New York Times obviously knows everything every hip-hop, country, and manufactured pop performer has ever done, and not done, and why, and why not, and especially what sliced-and-diced genre (“left-field semi-serious guacamole boy-band goth funk”) whatever it is belongs in—and it’d better stay there if it knows what’s good for it—and Clinton Heylin knows everything about Bob Dylan, sometimes to great effect, as in his little known “Dylan’s Daemon Lover,” but too often you get the feeling he needs to know everything in order to master his envy. There’s knowing, and there’s gnosis.\n\nI like the Mance Lipscomb verse about taking his pony out west. It’s not much of a song, though. Even when I discovered the band version on “Freewheelin'” I was surprised by the novelty and bored with the music.\n\n11/09/17\n\nJust wondered: are you at all a fan of Billy Childish? In any of his incarnations?\n\n– Sophie\n\nNo. That went by me.\n\n11/09/17\n\nDavid Kamp (in United States of Arugula) notes that you were one of the people who “convened” at Chez Panisse to talk about new ideas of food, music and culture. I’m wondering if you described these conversations anywhere.\n\n– Grant\n\nI’m not sure what that means. My wife Jenny and I didn’t convene anything. We were friends of Alice Waters in Berkeley and involved with Chez Panisse from the beginning, and I’ve been a member of the Board of Directors, which runs the restaurant, since the 1970s. I wrote about this, in a severely edited way, in the Food number of Lapham’s Quarterly, but the full essays I wrote for Alice’s 40th Anniversary of Chez Panisse book, from which the Lapham’s piece was taken, haven’t yet been published. I hope they will be, someday, somewhere.\n\n11/05/17\n\nGiven your love of “Stolen Car” on The River, I’m curious what you think of the version on Tracks, which includes a dream sequence similar to the one that turned up in “Point Blank” and the indelible lines “I can remember how good I felt inside/ When the preacher said ‘Son, you may kiss the bride'” (which was used as the title of a bootleg)? When I first heard the bootleg, I found this version, with its country western arrangement, a revelation, but by the time it came out on Tracks, I felt like its emotional peaks and valleys took away from the fundamental meaning of the version on The River. I guess I’m saying it made it more of a story or a song, and less of a state of mind. The version on The River seems, in retrospect, like a prelude to Nebraska. How do you respond to the two very different versions?\n\n– Jay\n\nBruce has always known how to edit, and nowhere to better effect than here. The shorter version says a hundred times more.\n\nIn 1985, when he was playing the Oakland Coliseum—the baseball stadium—I asked him to do that song. I thought it didn’t come off—the place was too big, the song was too small. I just watched it on YouTube. I couldn’t have been more wrong—and though he didn’t, it seems, swaying along with the balance in this performance, he edited it even more. Maybe it’s the way he brings out each element more fully.\n\n11/05/17\n\nIn 2002, when asked how you might revise “Treasure Island,” you said you’d really missed “most of the Velvet Underground, which didn’t come across for me, perhaps because of West Coast snobbery, until punk had opened it up for me.”\n\nThis was surprising, because in that discography you have VU’s work represented quite fully: their first three albums by a 2-LP retrospective followed by their final album Loaded in its entirety.\n\nCan you clarify? Did you mean that, after Stranded, punk opened you up to additional non-album recordings by VU—perhaps bootlegs, or the mid-1980s collections of outtakes, or the 1995 box set? Or were you saying that, even though in 1979 you appreciated VU as an essential piece of the story, punk subsequently led you deeper into VU’s music?\n\nFinally, can you tell us what that coming across was like for you? And what is your favorite Velvet Underground music?\n\n– RL\n\nI first heard the Velvet Underground when DJ Tom Donahue, who I’d grown up listening to on San Francisco Top 40 stations and was now in 1967 on the far left of the dial very odd FM station KMPX, played “Heroin.” I found it terrifying. I also thought it sounded much too much like Bob Dylan, at a time when rumors of his heroin use were all over the place—that’s what I’d heard the year before in “Rainy Day Women,” too. “That was from New York,” Donahue said. “Let’s hope it stays there.” As if heroin wasn’t already taking over the Haight-Ashbury. Not long after that the band arrived in San Francisco with their whole Exploding Plastic Inevitable extravaganza and were laughed at by newspaper critics and otherwise ignored. It took me a good while to hear the greatness in “Heroin” and “White Light, White Heat.” I didn’t cotton to them, really, until they turned into a rock ‘n’ roll band, as anyone might understand the term, with Loaded. I don’t think Lou Reed sounded both like a singular artist and a real person until Street Hassle. Does anyone remember that it’s Bruce Springsteen at the end of the title track? And then I fell in love with his Lenny Bruce meets Don Rickles masterpiece, Take No Prisoners. I love that line about John Rockwell, then the New York Times pop critic, having a bodyguard (“And he’s a big guy”). He is a big guy, and he’s his own bodyguard. I once saw him pick up a jerk who was ruining everyone’s time at a restaurant off the Bowery and throw him out of the place. After that I could hear what Lou Reed was doing.\n\nMy second favorite Lou Reed recording, though sometimes it’s first, is “Like a Possum,” which is 18 minutes long and too short. My number one, from 1969, didn’t surface until 1974, thanks to my friend Paul Nelson, with 1969: The Velvet Underground Live, when Paul was working as in A&R for Mercury. One track: the almost nine minutes of “What Goes On.” It’s mesmerizing. It’s from another world. It’s a walk down the street. It’s why it can sometimes take all day to answer when someone asks you what’s going on and you still have more to say.\n\n11/05/17\n\nOther than a passing reference in The Shape of Things to Come, I don’t think I’ve ever come across any words from you re: David Lynch’s The Elephant Man. It sits within his filmography in an odd way: often just cited as a piece of studio-contracted work a la Dune (though I’ve yet to see anyone claim Dune is actually good), glossed over quite a bit in (for instance) Dennis Lim’s book length study of Lynch, yet not without its vocal adherents too (Kael loved it). And perhaps the most European of his films. Any thoughts?\n\n– Scott Woods\n\nI loved it when I saw it. It was so austere. I suppose I’m less drawn back to it than any other Lynch movie (other than Dune, which I’ve never seen, and Inland Empire, which I got so tired of, and The Straight Story, which has only one indelible scene, in the bar near the end) because it isn’t American, doesn’t use the American ethos mythos mind body as its terrain—doesn’t fill the country up with all of the unlikely characters in all the other pictures.\n\n11/05/17\n\nHave you written on/Do you have any thoughts on Aussie group, The Go-Betweens? Are there any other groups or artists from down under that you think can hold a candle to the rest of the world’s rock pantheon?\n\n– Tim\n\nWhile I’ve been sparked by Australian music from the Easybeats’ “Friday on My Mind” to Midnight Oil’s “Beds Are Burning” to, most of all, Men at Work’s musically perfect “Down Under”—I still break into a smile every time the instrumental break is about to begin, knowing that wonderful low note turnaround it coming—the only band I’ve ever really loved, followed, worried about, gone to see, is the Drones.\n\n11/05/17 [note: response to G.M.’s answer re: The Vietnam War, 10/31]\n\nTo your query about the songs used in The Vietnam War, the complete list can be found by looking at each episode’s individual page. The 2-CD soundtrack largely cherry picks the selections for what is easiest to swallow. As to your specific asks, The Doors are not used, as far as can be recalled or found in the lists, and neither is the Dylan version of “Watchtower.” The great-but-shopworn Hendrix recording is in Episode 10, just when you think you will escape it.\n\nNotice, too, the PBS site describes a sidebar project that hands some of the songs to people like Gary Clark Jr. and The Lumineers, though they are not included in the documentary. A soundtrack of wholly new interpretations of songs of the Vietnam era might have been very effective, both as part of the content (especially if the new artist saw the scene where the song would be placed) and as a calling card for the series.\n\nFinally, I recall now that one very effective music match was, I believe, the only song not a part of the time period examined in the series. That was the riff of “Kashmir” used in Episode 10, during the fall of Saigon). This hit hard… It seemed to illustrate both panic and a conquering army at once. Thinking about it now, I can imagine how any number of later-recorded songs might have elevated a long documentary, if only used for their dramatic, monochrome music and not the lyrics: “Bullet The Blue Sky”, “Killing In The Name”, “For Whom The Bell Tolls.”\n\nAs I said, I learned a great deal of the intricacies of the war, and I’m grateful. But I think the impact of the story was foreshortened by a sentimental, predictable soundtrack. By slanting the series toward those who lived through Vietnam, versus those who did not, an opportunity was missed.\n\n– Glenn Burris\n\n11/05/17\n\nRegarding Lennon’s reaction to “Fourth Time Around,” his feelings changed over time, apparently. Here is his take on it from a 1968 Rolling Stone interview:\n\nQ: “What did you think of Dylan’s version of ‘Norwegian Wood’?”\n\nA: “I was very paranoid about that. I remember he played it to me when he was in London. He said, ‘What do you think?’ I said, ‘I don’t like it.’ I didn’t like it. I was very paranoid. I just didn’t like what I felt I was feeling—I thought it was an out-and-out skit, you know, but it wasn’t. It was great. I mean, he wasn’t playing any tricks on me. I was just going through the bit.”\n\nPersonally, I think “Norwegian Wood” is the better song, with a gorgeous melody and arrangement. By comparison, Dylan’s does feel like a skit—not unlike what John did late in life when he sang newspaper headlines in Dylanese.\n\n– Jay\n\nDylan’s song is a lot meaner. Lennon was, among other things, trying to tell his wife about an affair while maintaining plausible deniability. Dylan strips the cover off.\n\n10/31/17\n\nI noticed your anticipation of Ken Burns’ The Vietnam War back in August. I’ve watched the complete series now, and found it more compelling and rewarding than any other Burns documentary that I have seen. Not only were many vagaries of the war made clearer to me, but I found myself regularly trying to solve Vietnam in my head. For example, what if Ike had strong-armed the French in the fifties, and struck a deal with Ho Chi Minh that would give the country to his movement, but not under the communist brand? As thought-provoking as the series is, I was disappointed at the way the music of the period was selected and used. The soundtrack choices are almost unerringly cliché, from The Animals to Procol Harum to Simon and Garfunkel, to “Gimme Shelter.” You could feel each one of them coming around the corner, and I thought scenes were sometimes stretched just to accommodate another verse or chorus. And all of it at the expense of the instrumental music contributed by Trent Reznor and Yo-Yo Ma, which appeared most often as brief, soft padding. After a while, I felt I was being hustled, and could imagine a voiceover reminding me I could receive the 2-CD soundtrack “at the $120 membership level.” To be fair, that soundtrack does include some unusual choices, like Otis Redding’s version of “Tell The Truth.” But those were either crowded out in the series or I can’t recall hearing them at all. Would this story have suffered for lack of rock and roll music? Does any account of that era really need to be decorated by “Get Together” and “For What It’s Worth”? And if the story has to have “’Nam songs” to make its impact, can you think of any that would be more striking to the ear if they were included?\n\n– Glenn Burris\n\nI haven’t seen it. Your account is as pointed a review as I’ve read. I wonder—does he use the Doors, who were so present in Vietnam that one GI said years later he had to force himself to stop listening to the band, because their music was the only thing that made what he’d seen and done real, but he had to finally put it behind him—and never listen again. Dylan’s “All Along the Watchtower”? Some years ago Bear Family put out a nearly insane 13 CD box called …Next Stop is Vietnam, a collection of Vietnam songs—super-patriotic, weirdly erotic, absurdist—that, as no sneer at Ken Burns, had exactly what he’d never touch. A lot of it is unlistenable, musically and morally. But it’s not a cliché.\n\n10/31/17\n\nRecently one of your correspondents, Randy, wrote that your “insight” into the Ramones “changed the way I heard them, and I think you’re right: they really do sound like a bunch of twits.”\n\nNow, I talk shit to people all the time about their tastes in music, but I’d be pretty bummed if my opinion actually turned someone off an artist that he or she liked. Are you okay with it?\n\n– Steve O’Neill\n\nI never want to encourage anyone not to like what they like, or be ashamed of it.\n\nExcept maybe for Journey.\n\n10/31/17 [Note: G.M.’s original reference to Irving Wallace has been corrected and changed to Harold Robbins; thanks to D. Schilling for the catch.]\n\nBob Dylan has always had angry songs. “Like A Rolling Stone,” “Positively 4th Street” and “Idiot Wind” are some of the best. But in the past 2 decades I notice some over the top proclamations that just appear in the middle of songs. Just a few examples:\n\n— “I’ll drag ‘em all down to hell and I’ll stand ‘em at the wall, I’ll sell ‘em to their enemies” (“Workingman’s Blues #2”)\n\n— “I’m preaching the word of God, I’m putting out your eyes” (“High Water”)\n\n— “Yes, I’m leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift, gonna break the roof in—set fire to the place as a parting gift” (“Summer Days”)\n\n— “My enemy crashed into the dust, got pinned down. He lost his lust. Bled to death against a tree. I didn’t notice it ‘til later, that he had wounded me” (“Long And Wasted Years”)\n\nAnd then there is “Pay In Blood” from Tempest, which is nasty the whole way through.\n\nI acknowledge that this kind of thing is not new with Bob. From “Idiot Wind”:\n\n— “You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies/One day you’ll be in the ditch, flies buzzin’ around your eyes/Blood on your saddle…”\n\nBut that line seems alive and honest and it still moves me. These new outbursts mostly seem forced and artless to me. What do you think?\n\nI wonder why Bob is still so angry, who all these enemies are, and is it really necessary to pay them back in such a way?\n\n– Bob Ryan\n\nThe songs you mention from the past have never sounded angry to me. I hear empathy, regret. Dylan described “Like a Rolling Stone” as an attempt to warn someone of the danger she was facing: you can hear that. The sense of weariness, tiredness, fatigue at the very concept of hate and envy directed toward him by the Llewyn Davises of his world is what I hear in that song, not anger.\n\nWhat you’re hearing in the songs you mention from Love and Theft on down doesn’t sound angry to me either, or as you say forced and artless, even though a lot of the lines are borrowed from Ovid and elsewhere. They sound nihilistic, sadistic, funny, playful—don’t ever hear these words outside of their music, outside of what the band is doing and the way Dylan is singing, which tells you what he feels about what he’s singing if not what he means.\n\nAnd they sound real. It’s not unusual for someone, as he or she gets older, to contemplate the hell one’s enemies, which can simply mean, or mostly mean, people who irritate you, deserve: their brutal, dismembering, death-by-a-thousand-cuts deaths, their Harold Robbins fantasies of, as with Nevada Smith, slitting someone’s eyelids so they can’t close and then putting anthills on the villain’s face so the ants will eat his eyes while he bakes in the sun staked down to the ground—you get the idea. That’s all over “Ain’t Talkin’.” I don’t doubt him for a moment. I also think—I hear—that conjuring up scenarios of revenge is a form of energy, the energy behind such great songs as “Highwater,” “Ain’t Talkin’,” and so much of Tempest. But “Highwater” is also hilarious all the way through, and “Summer Days, Summer Nights”—I mean, what better way to end that party than burning down that roadhouse and moving on to the next one?\n\n10/31/17\n\nWhat is your assessment of John Mellencamp’s career? I am particularly interested in which songs have resonated with you and best represent what he seems to be about.\n\n– Bradley Fackler\n\nIt’s a good question and a good response would be a 5000 word piece—at the least—tracing what’s so distinctive, inventive, sustained, and honorable about his music. But—\n\nBreaking free from the conceptual art/traditional UK rock manager’s slave camp and reclaiming his own uncommon, funny-sounding name—after David Bowie’s maestro Tony DeVries scooped up the young cutie pie and renamed him Johnny Cougar in the manner of such first-wave British Elvis (and Pat Boone!) imitators as Johnny Eager and Billy Fury—was a great accomplishment. It must have been a struggle, and a scary thing to do, and I’ve never read anything about it. He—the Johnny Cougar him—was a hit almost from the start—the promotional push even before his launch was sophisticated and relentless, with very classy seeming scams meant to compromise critics into taking him seriously. But even the perfectly decent early hits like “Jack & Diane” and “Pink Houses” self-destructed with the oversold drawl. You heard calculation before anything else. Rod Stewart combed his hair in a thousand ways, but then he walked out of his room and into the world. What you heard here was a guy trapped in front of the mirror.\n\nThere’s such a huge leap from the ducks-in-a-row of “Two American kids growin’ up in the heartland” from “Jack and Diane”—a song including its own ad, its own franchising campaign—and the loose and rambling “Another boring romantic, that’s me” in “Small Town” from Scarecrow. That great album, his eighth album, was a shout of freedom: now I’m going to say what I want to say in my own voice, if I can find it, and he found it, and he found it in his band. Drummer Kenny Aronoff might as well have been the lead guitar player, or for that matter the singer. It sounded as if they’d put him inside the mike. Explosions were going off everywhere.\n\nAfter that you could feel the liberation, and hear the sense of play, the creativity—and the fiddle playing!—that came from it. “Paper in Fire.” “Colored Lights,” which he wrote and produced for the Blasters and recorded so beautifully himself. The odd covers album from 2003, Trouble No More, with the obscure doo-wop combo Dicky Do and the Don’ts walking down the street with Son House and Charlie Poole. He collapsed place, time, genre with No Better Than This, which was based on a very corny conceptual art idea: record his own new songs on hallowed ground—the Sun Studios, a church that was part of the Underground Railroad, and a hotel room where Robert Johnson recorded. And do it in mono. Why not release it as a set of 78s? But it worked. It really did carry mystic echoes.\n\nI remember a show in 2003, a Buddy Holly tribute concert after a conference on his work in Cleveland. Maria Elena was there: there was something to live up to. The show was a terrible bore until Mellencamp showed up to close it. He couldn’t have been more relaxed, and he couldn’t have conveyed more authority. Why not me? he seemed to be saying. I can do it. A year later Sean Wilentz and I were working with Columbia on a companion CD for a book we’d edited on American ballads. The label wanted one of their own contemporary performers on the album: they chose Mellencamp for “Wreck of the Old 97.” It’s been recorded by hundreds of people since the ’20s. He sang from the day after the train crashed in 1903 to the day after he died himself, whenever that would turn out to be.\n\nHe should do more car songs.\n\n10/31/17\n\nIs the new Jann Wenner biography any good?\n\n– Steve O’Neill\n\nI haven’t finished it yet. I’ll just say that it’s instructive that the two books the author cites as inspirational, Albert Goldman’s The Lives of John Lennon, which was written to destroy Lennon in favor of Goldman, and David Hadju’s Positively Fourth Street, which was written to discredit Bob Dylan in favor or Richard Farina, are proof along with his that it’s really not a good idea to write a book when its animating factor is the author’s contempt for his or her subject.\n\n10/29/17\n\nYou’ve been clear about your opinion of the Ramones, writing that “there’s no conviction in their music” and discounting their contribution to punk—not in terms of influence but in terms of speaking from the same place, with the same voice. This insight changed the way I heard them, and I think you’re right: they really do sound like a bunch of twits.\n\nBut I still wonder about your first musical impression of “Blitzkreig Bop,” assuming you heard it in early 1976. I can’t help but think that the first 20 seconds (before the singing) must have sounded startling, exhilarating, alive, and promising to your ears against the prevailing blandness, staleness, and deadness of rock at this time. Or—did it hit you as “cold and ugly” right away? Can you tell us more?\n\n– Randy\n\nThere’s no way to minimize the impact, influence, and most of all inspiration of the Ramones, from all the UK punk groups to countless US and elsewhere bands, right up to and past Sleater-Kinney with their ultimate tribute to Joey Ramone. That said, aside from the real anger, hurt, and rage in “Bonzo Goes to Bitburg”—Reagan tossing a yellow star all the way from Germany to New York to say, You don’t matter and you never did—I never heard any stakes in their music, high or low. And I was in Berkeley. “Sheena Is a Punk Rocker” is the first song that registered for me and it seemed like an expert pop record. At the time New York critics were beside themselves: I remember one asking if this could be the most important single ever made. In other words, a local band that the concentration of media in New York tried to make world-historical, which in a way they already were, but not with the kind of recognition certain people wanted for them, which is to say for themselves. In other words: the New Roches.\n\n10/29/17\n\nThe recently unearthed Allen Ginsberg tapes of Bob Dylan and the Hawks live in San Francisco (12/11/65) and San Jose (12/12/65) seem to have rewritten history, since they’ve shown that the bootleg of the Dec. 4 Berkeley concert (titled Long Distance Operator) is actually a recording of the San Jose show. No recording of the actual Berkeley concert, which you had the great fortune to attend, is known to exist.\n\nDoes it feel strange knowing that you had been listening to an imposter for several decades? One that seemed to represent your memories of a great show but actually did not? And do you worry that your memories of the Berkeley show have been influenced over time by the San Jose recording?\n\nTwo further questions: you’ve described the rediscovered San Francisco show as “fierce, physical, like a riot where the tension only builds and is never released.” Do you think it’s a greater concert than the Berkeley one? And in light of Dylan’s cryptic comments about a “new drummer,” who do you think was behind the kit in San Francisco?\n\n– revelator60\n\nBobby Gregg, the drummer on Highway 61 Revisited, was the drummer for those shows. What we now know is the San Jose show was not different from the Berkeley show in any way I can remember or reconstruct. (I wonder if it was bootlegged as from Berkeley because Berkeley seemed cooler, i.e., more salable, than San Jose.) I was utterly swept away—the term is much too mild—more like taken into another dimension—by the performance with the Hawks of “It Ain’t Me Babe,” and the bootleg let me understand why. The San Francisco show was different in kind.\n\n10/29/17\n\nIs the new Jann Wenner biography any good?\n\n– Steve O’Neill\n\nI haven’t finished it yet. I’ll just say that it’s instructive that the two books the author cites as inspirational, Albert Goldman’s The Lives of John Lennon, which was written to destroy Lennon in favor of Goldman, and David Hadju’s Positively Fourth Street, which was written to discredit Bob Dylan in favor or Richard Farina, are proof along with his that it’s really not a good idea to write a book when its animating factor is the author’s contempt for his or her subject.\n\n10/29/17\n\nNever heard the Mance Lipscomb version of “Jack O’iamonds” you posted (October 19, 2017) along with your wonderful response to my query. I love it and thank you.\n\nNow try this on for size. Sounds to me like the Jack of diamonds was a hard card to play, but he finally did it—and it turned his money green!\n\n– Laura Leivick Fabulous. He could take that to the World Poker Championship in Las Vegas.\n\n10/29/17\n\nI’m reading The History of Rock ‘n’ Roll in Ten Songs, which I began before I saw the Flamin Groovies play their first Nashville show a couple of days ago. I like what you write about “Shake Some Action” and think you caught the mystery of the song in your description of how the rhythm falls behind the singer. The guitar lick that sets up the chorus is perfect because Cyril Jordan pauses an entire beat before landing on the last note. My theory is he had to pause in order for all of the other guitar licks to fall into place metrically, but it always strikes me as rather eerie, as does the whole scheme of all those guitar licks and singing he devised.\n\nTwo questions: first, I don’t know your other writing, if any, on the Groovies. What do you think of their other work? Was the Roy Loney Groovies too revivalist for you, or do you find Supersnazz as much fun as I do these days? Second, has any power-pop or, let me limit it a bit, self-conscious revivalist British-American-Invasion band of the ‘70s ever recorded a song that comes within shouting distance of “Shake Some Action”?\n\nBy the way, the performance here was very weird. They rocked, but they also played “Shake Some Action” like a good bar band would. Jordan doesn’t play that lick any more.\n\n– Edd Hurt\n\nFor me the band has always come down to that one song.\n\n10/29/17\n\nI enjoyed reading what you had to say about Bruce Springsteen and The River. Have you heard this version of “Cadillac Ranch”? For me, it’s something else entirely: pure, unfettered joy, presented almost as a comfort to the citizens of New York state only weeks after the death of John Lennon. Towards the end, he becomes completely lost in the song, happily morphing it into Chuck Berry’s “No Money Down.” As I say, pure rock ‘n’ roll joy. I hope you agree.\n\n– Lucas Hare It’s wonderful. Thanks. The glissandos remind me of that scene in Diner when some of the guys are at the most depressing strip club in town, the band is doped and half dead, when one of them sits down a the piano, runs his fingers from left to right, and everyone’s lights go on.\n\n10/26/17\n\nYour link to the Charlatans version of “Jack O’ Diamonds” (which is great) led me to a live 1960 performance of the song by Lonnie Donegan. Stiff in a suit and bow tie, looking like he knows skiffle’s race has been run, Donegan sings some of the verses, but mostly repeats the refrain: “Jack o’ diamonds/Jack o’ diamonds/diamonds is hard card to find.” I’d never questioned those lines before—in every other version of the song I’d heard, they made sense without being explicable. Watching Donegan spit the words through his ventriloquist’s grin/grimace, I wondered, for the first time, what the fuck does that even mean?\n\nThankfully, in the comments, Terry Hesticles offers this trenchant analysis: “I think, what he’s really trying to say here, is the Jack O’ Diamonds is a really hard card to find.”\n\n– Steve O’Neill\n\nPeople change things around because one phrase simply, which is to say complexly, feels right. People slip, and words enter songs that were never meant to be there. (In one of my first published pieces, in Rolling Stone, I made a point about Buddy Holly and the Everly Brothers; a typo dropped half of the sentence, which as it was printed scanned in terms of syntax but made no sense. It was quoted over and over by other people as if it actually said something. I wish I knew what.) The Jack of Diamonds is a hard card to play because it’s in the middle, not the lowest face card, not the highest, sort of near the bottom, a booby prize unless you can improvise and bluff with not nothing, but not much. “Hard card to find” would mean it’s very useful but it doesn’t come up as often as you’d like, which seems unlikely. Of course it could have a much deeper, older meaning, in which the Jack of Diamonds goes back to Arthurian times, when it would have been the name of a knight, and that knight might have kept company with witches, following the old, pre-Christian religion, and so the Jack of Diamonds is really a wood sprite, casting spells the effect of which we feel but the meaning of which is completely unrecoverable.\n\nI’m making all this up, of course, but that’s just what the line is in the song for—to take you elsewhere.\n\n10/26/17\n\nTwo questions, one of the moment and one as the result of lingering curiosity:\n\n1- Who’s your favorite current artist who isn’t an old one in the midst of a comeback?\n\n2- And am I right to conclude that you saw The River as a wrong turn in Springsteen’s career?\n\nThanks for all the great writing and even better arguments you’ve started.\n\n– Derek Murphy\n\n1- Lana Del Rey.\n\n2- I don’t see The River as any kind of turn. There are too many songs on it for it to cohere, so it dissipates and doesn’t hold its place as albums before and after it did and do. There are many powerful songs—“Point Blank,” “The River” itself, which is somewhat clumsy and predictable, but has that great cutting line, “A union card and a wedding coat.” There are wonderful loose songs: “Cadillac Ranch.” But to me there is only one great song, which goes to the heart of the loneliness that is, you could say, the root cause of Springsteen’s music, and also links up to the loneliness, the fundamental inability to find anyone in America willing to stop for a moment and listen to you, and that’s “Stolen Car.” “Each night I wait to get caught, but I never do.” That’s haunting if I’ve ever heard it. Has he even left his house for twenty years? Is it boarded "
