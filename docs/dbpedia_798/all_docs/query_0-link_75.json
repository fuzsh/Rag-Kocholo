        "text": "Greetings readers!\n\nHello there, hi! It’s been a while hasn’t it? Haha. Yes, these days have been *busy* for me. I know I said July would be a month of catching up on blogging and reviews, but I promise I will say more on that in a wrap up that is forth coming.\n\nI am doing great, I have just lost track of time per se. Nonetheless, I figured I’d ease my way back into the bloggoverse with a fun tag! I was tagged by the incredible Michaela @ Journey into Books! Many thanks to her and this is your reminder to check out her blog (it is fantastic!)\n\nAlright, no disclaimers only honest answers…Here we go!\n\nWhich trope(s) in books annoys you the most?\n\nI am not a fan of love triangles! I get that they can be realistic-ish (because humans are messy), but I hate being on the losing side (which happens often) so I prefer if romances are just clear from the start but with lots of drama hehe.\n\nWhich writer(s) do you feel is overrated/overhyped?\n\nSarah J. Maas. I’ll be brief: I think she can write entertaining books, but I don’t like how she treats her characters of colour and in the end the plots weren’t very memorable for me.\n\nJay Kristoff. I’m not a big fan of his writing style and I’m not super interested in his newer works…so yeah.\n\nWhat are your least favorite books you’ve read since joining BookTube blogging?\n\nOh gosh, well certainly the final books of Throne of Glass, 99% Mine is awful imo, but I think The Good Luck Charm by Helena Hunting takes the cake. I hated that book! To this day I still think about how I hated it so much XD\n\nWhat is a terrible ending that ruined an otherwise quality book?\n\nThe ending to Immortal Reign by Morgan Rhodes was just not it…\n\nIt wasn’t a terrible ending, but this whole series was top quality and then this final book was just so lackluster! My disappointment was real.\n\nWhich fictional character(s) do you wish was not killed off?\n\nAs much as I loved Jade City by Fonda Lee, I feel like if this *one* character had not been killed off we still could have had so much drama, suspense and action. Like maybe they could have gone missing or faked their death teehee but yeah I wish we could bring this one back.\n\nWhat are some of your bookish pet peeves?\n\nSaying that listening to an audiobook or reading a graphic novel is not “real” reading. You can kindly exit the premises if you believe that, I will not have people trying to police what is and what isn’t reading around me.\n\nWhat are some books you feel should have more recognition?\n\nThe Chronicles of a Bitch Queen by K.S. Villoso needs your attention now! If you are a fantasy reader, you need to read these now. This character-driven fantasy is phenomenal. There is deception, betrayal, action and dragons plus so so so much more! The fact that these books have been slept on enrages me!! So read it, please!\n\nWhat are your thoughts on censorship and banning books?\n\nI don’t think anything good comes out of either and it often makes me question who has the authority to ban/censor books these days, when historically these tactics have been used to silence voices of those being oppressed and/or marginalized. So yeah, miss me with those.\n\nI tag…\n\nAnyone who feels up to the challenge (Yes, I am lazy right now hehe)\n\nLet me know what you think! What are your opinions on these prompts? What is one bookish opinion you will never back down from?\n\nHappy reading!\n\n~ Rendz\n\nGreetings readers!\n\nI was tagged by the amazing Michaela @ Journey Into Books to do this fun tag and answer her excellent questions. I must confess that…I have been tagged to do this award many times but have lost count so I’m sorry to those I’ve missed, but I am starting anew.\n\nRules\n\nThank the blogger who nominated you and link to there post.\n\nAnswer the 11 questions asked of you.\n\nNominate 11 new bloggers and ask 11 new questions.\n\nList the rules and showcase the logo in your post.\n\nMichaela’s Questions\n\n1. What was your last 5 star read and why?\n\nThe Dragon of Jin-Sayeng by K.S. Villoso\n\nAn absolutely incredible finale to what is one of my favourite series ever. I cannot recommend it enough! This book was a rollercoaster of emotions. Screaming, crying, laughing and my total destruction. I love it.\n\n2. Recommend a book for each season?\n\nSpring: The Penderwicks series by Jeanne Birdsall (So cozy and warm, total new life vibes)\n\nSummer: Somewhere Between Bitter and Sweet by Laekan Zea Kemp (Hot and sweaty and MARVELOUS)\n\nFall: The Bitch Queen Chronicles by K.S. Villoso (So much chaos, so much emotional destruction)\n\nWinter: Mexican Gothic by Silvia Moreno-Garcia (A chilling and thrilling horror novel)\n\n3. If you weren’t a reader what do you think you would spend your time doing instead?\n\nI’d probably spend my days doing more art! Even though I get a lot of my artistic inspiration from books, without reading I would definitely spend more time actually making art and refining my skills hehe.\n\n4. What book would you love to see turned into a movie or tv show?\n\nAn Ember in the Ashes by Sabaa Tahir!!\n\nThis needs to be done and it needs to be done NOW! I want this on screen so bad!!\n\n5. Which fictional character would you want to travel the world with?\n\nNikolai Lanstov. My suave king knows how to have a good time and I want to have a good time with him everywhere!\n\n6. Most anticipated release for this year?\n\nVelvet was the Night by Silvia Moreno-Garcia!\n\nThis is an obvious one if you know me! I love everything SMG and I am so lucky to already have an ARC of this book! It comes out in August so have your eyes peeled for it!\n\n7. Why did you decide to start blogging?\n\nI attended a bookish event held by Canada’s biggest book retailer, Indigo, where we basically talked all things books! I met so many bloggers, got some ARCs a stuffed swag pack and well I just knew I wanted to be part of this beyond that night. I started up my blog a few days later and well it’s been a journey ever since!\n\n8. What is your favourite thing about blogging.\n\nI love getting to express myself as a total bookworm! I know there are lots of platforms where I can do that, but on this blog that I created, it just feels extra special! There is no limit to how much or how little I can write! I can add all sorts of fun images, videos and clips. It’s just a space that is so near and dear to my heart and the very first place that published my voice!\n\n9. Is there a specific book or series that made you fall in love with reading?\n\nHmmm…I would say The Hunger Games, but I think more likely it was Marie Lu’s Legend series. It was the first series I picked up of my own volition (not because it was becoming a movie) and I loved it!! It was the first series that I became obsessed with and am still obsessed with today!\n\n10. Favourite fictional pairing? (Romantic or Platonic)\n\nOh wow this is such a hard question to answer!!!!!!\n\nBut you know what? Cresswell (Cress x Thorne) still owns my heart.\n\n11. What book do you planning on reading next?\n\nI’m in the middle of three reads right now, but I’m planning on picking up The Jasmine Throne by Tasha Suri next! So excited for this next glorious adult fantasy!\n\nMy Questions:\n\nWhat is your favourite book trope?\n\nWhich book brings you the most comfort?\n\nSpill the tea, what is one book you will *never* be picking up?\n\nWhat song do you associate with a certain book?\n\nWho are your favourite authors?\n\nWhich book character would you want to trade lives with?\n\nWhat is the first book you remember reading?\n\nHow often do you buy/borrow books?\n\nDuring what time of the day do you like to read?\n\nWhat is one non-bookish fun fact about you?\n\nWhat is your star prediction for your current read?\n\nI tag:\n\nHehe…I won’t be nominating 11 people, but some bloggers I have loved as of late. As usual there is no pressure to do this and if I didn’t nominate you, you are more than welcome to answer my questions!\n\nGaby @ Living in Libros\n\nAngele @ A Dominique Reads\n\nThat’s it for me folks! Let me know what you think! What would be your answers to some of these questions?\n\nHappy reading!\n\n~ Rendz\n\nGreetings readers!\n\nToday, I figured we’d have some fun and do a good ol’ tag to spice up the blog. And why not do a tag about a booklover’s greatest frenemy, Goodreads. Goodreads has been a hot topic as of late, while it may be a great site for readers, it also has its problems hehe. I for one have been slowly moving away from GR to use other book platforms to track my reading (StoryGraph!). But for the sake of this tag, I hopped onto to the old, big G and went through my shelves (which need some major editing).\n\nI found this tag on A Dominique Reads! This tag is originally created by GabsAboutBooks! Definitely give both posts a look through, both have such great answers!\n\nWhat is the highest rated book that you gave a low rating? (Sort your books in Goodreads based on Average Ratings and find the highest rated book you gave a low rating)\n\nKingdom of Ash by Sarah J. Maas\n\nGR rating: 4.57\n\nMy Rating: 2 (should be a 1)\n\nNot surprised. I have not been a fan of this series since book 2, just one big swoop downhill for me. The fact that I endured however many hundreds of pages this book contained is a small miracle. But yeah, this was such a huge no for me.\n\nWhat is the lowest rated book that you gave a high rating? (Sort your books in Goodreads based on Avg Ratings, in reverse order, and find the lowest rated book you gave a high rating)\n\nThe Star-Touched Queen by Roshani Chokshi.\n\nGR rating: 3.56\n\nMy Rating: 5\n\nI know the rating is not bad, but this was such a beautiful book! The writing, the imagery, the plot. ALL OF IT was spectacular in my eyes and the reasons why I love Roshani’s books so much.\n\nWhat is the most popular book you disagree with the avg rating? (Sort your books in Goodreads based on number of Ratings, and find the first book you disagree with the avg rating)\n\nQueen of Shadows by Sarah J. Maas\n\nNumber of Ratings: 288,861\n\nGR rating: 4.54\n\nMy rating: 3 (It should really be 2)\n\nThis book was just *shakes head* torturous for me to read. Again, no surprise. This series just was not for me after book 3 and my ratings reflect that despite it being so popular.\n\nWhat is the least popular book you disagree with the avg rating? (Sort your books in Goodreads based on number of Ratings, in reverse order, and find the first book you disagree with the avg rating)\n\nA Mark Unwilling by Candace Wondrak\n\nNumber of Ratings: 126\n\nGR Rating: 3.76\n\nMy rating: 1\n\nThis book is *shivers* a big nope! A. BIG. NOPE. The characters, the writing style, the plot, the token PoC character no no no.\n\nChoose two books that have an average rating of 3/5 stars but you gave a higher rating\n\nThe Matchmaker’s List by Sonya Lalli\n\nGR rating: 3.34\n\nMy Rating: 4\n\nObsidian Mirror by Catherine Fisher\n\nGR rating: 3.67\n\nMy rating: 5\n\nI really enjoyed both of these books! The Matchmaker’s List was funny and intense, but definitely not perfect. Still I laughed a good bunch. As for Obsidian Mirror, it’s a very quiet YA novel, but I enjoyed it so much! I picked it up on a whim from my library and it turned out to be quite entertaining!\n\nChoose two books that have an average rating of 3/5 stars but you gave a lower rating\n\nThe Good Luck Charm by Helena Hunting\n\nGR rating: 3.59\n\nMy Rating: 2 (But it should be 1)\n\nThe Wedding Date Disaster by Avery Flynn\n\nGR Rating: 3.75\n\nMy rating: 1\n\nBoth of these books were technically DNFs but I made it almost to the end…so I’m counting them. These were AWFUL reads for me. I hated almost every second which is why I had to stop. I hated the romance in The Good Luck Charm and it’s a romance book, so yeah. As for The Wedding Date Disaster, it was one disastrous CRINGE-fest. Nope. Nope. Nope.\n\nChoose two books that have an average rating of 4/5 stars but you gave a lower rating\n\nKingdom of the Wicked by Keri Maniscalco\n\nGR Rating: 4.01\n\nMy Rating: 2\n\nThe Sky Weaver by Kristin Cicarreli\n\nGR Rating: 4.10\n\nMy Rating: 2\n\nSigh. These books were highly anticipated but ending up being such let downs. Kingdom of the Wicked was so bland, to put it simply. I expected so much more, but plain, bland and boring is all I got. As for The Sky Weaver, my buddy reader and I both agreed that it did not live up to the vibe and feels of the previous books in the series. Disappointing.\n\nChoose two books that have an average rating of 2/5 stars but you gave a higher rating.\n\nI don’t have any avg 2/5 stars books on my shelves!\n\nDo you tend to agree or disagree with GR average rating and do you use GR as a guide for books you want to read?\n\nIt depends. But from my shelves, it seems my ratings tend to match the average ratings. Other times they are way off. I try not to use GR as a guide, usually I just take a quick glance at star raitngs, but mostly I don’t. Unless I’ve heard about some questionable things I tend to go in blind and just give the book a try! 🙂\n\nI TAG…\n\nAnyone! I would love to see what answers you would put in!\n\nLet me know what you think! Do you use Goodreads? Do you follow GR ratings and reviews closely?\n\nHappy reading!\n\n~ Rendz\n\nGreetings readers!\n\nAs you all know fantasy is my genre! If I had to pick one genre of books to read for the rest of my days, we all know it would be fantasy no question about it! So when I found this tag on Angele @ A Dominique Reads‘s blog, I knew I really wanted to give my shot at it! The fantasy version of this tag was created by The Book Pusher.\n\nWHAT IS YOUR FANTASY ORIGIN STORY? (First fantasy novel you read)\n\nI think the first fantasy novel I ever read was The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis. Okay, it was read to me in the sixth grade and I had already been OBSESSED with the movie since the tender age of six…but still it definitely was the first fantasy story in my life.\n\nIF YOU COULD BE THE HERO/HEROINE IN A FANTASY NOVEL, WHO WOULD WRITE IT, AND WHAT IS ONE TROPE YOU WOULD INSIST ON BEING IN THE STORY?\n\nOh my…such hard decisions! Well if we’re going for a magical and mythical fantasy I want Silvia Moreno-Garcia to write me as a heroine with rivals to lovers THAT STAY TOGETHER. I just gotta make that note because SMG does have a track record here and there *eyes two of her novels*\n\nWHAT IS A FANTASY YOU’VE READ THIS YEAR THAT YOU WANT MORE PEOPLE TO READ?\n\nThe Ikessar Falcon by K.S. Villoso! Well, first you would have to read The Wolf of Oren-Yaro…so maybe it would be more relevant to say that I want you all to read The Chronicles of a Bitch Queen! It is a high stakes, character driven epic fantasy set in a world that draws from the author’s Filipino heritage. It is an absolutely brilliant series that I recommend to all fantasy readers!\n\nWHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE FANTASY SUBGENRE? WHAT SUBGENRE HAVE YOU NOT READ MUCH FROM?\n\nFavourite subgenre is definitely Portal Fantasy! (Hello Narnia obsession) Any and all books that deal with travelling to a different world instantly grabs at my attention. And even though I haven’t read many (I know, I know) it is a subgenre I absolutely love.\n\nA subgenre I have not read much from is Urban Fantasy. There are lots of UF books out there but there is just something that gives me a pause before I pick them up. I want to give them a better shot, so if you have any recommendations I am all ears!\n\nWHO IS ONE OF YOUR AUTO-BUY FANTASY AUTHORS?\n\nSabaa Tahir. K.S. Villoso. Leigh Bardugo. Marie Lu.\n\nAhh and I’m hoping to lengthen the list with time. I definitely want to add more BIPOC to the list!\n\nHOW DO YOU TYPICALLY FIND FANTASY RECOMMENDATIONS? (Goodreads, YouTube, Podcasts, Instagram, etc.)\n\nI think mainly Instagram! People just have a way of selling books to me with gorgeous pictures and fun captions. I have gotten so many amazing recommendations from my bookstagrammer friends! I also look through the weekly publishing announcements to find out what books I can look forward to!\n\nWHAT IS AN UPCOMING FANTASY RELEASE YOU’RE EXCITED FOR?\n\nOh so, so many!\n\nWitches Steeped in Gold by Ciannon Smart\n\nThe Light of the Midnight Stars by Rena Rossner\n\nThe Dragon of Jin Sayeng by K.S. Villoso\n\nThe Jasmine Throne by Tasha Suri\n\nWHAT IS ONE MISCONCEPTION ABOUT FANTASY YOU WOULD LIKE TO LAY AT REST?\n\n“Fantasy books are all always way too long and complex.”\n\nThere are a lot of long and complex fantasy novels. There are some series that just go on and the worlds get more convoluted as you go. There are some books that are chunky and thick that intimidate even me! Can’t deny that, BUT fantasy books come in all shapes and sizes! Using the excuse that they are all long and complex makes you miss out on all the short and concise fantasy books there are to enjoy! Need some recommendations? Here you go:\n\n*These are all less than 400 pages*\n\nGods of Jade and Shadow by Silvia Moreno-Garcia (standalone)\n\nThe Young Elites by Marie Lu (trilogy)\n\nThe Star-Touched Queen by Roshani Chokshi (standalone w/ companion sequel)\n\nRaybearer by Jordan Ifeuko (duology)\n\nIF SOMEONE HAD NEVER READ A FANTASY BEFORE AND ASKED YOU TO RECOMMEND THE FIRST 3 BOOKS THAT COME TO MIND AS PLACES TO START, WHAT WOULD THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS BE?\n\nAhhh the pressure is on! Okay top 3…here we go!\n\nAn Ember in the Ashes by Sabaa Tahir\n\nSix of Crows by Leigh Bardugo\n\nA Song of Wraiths and Ruin by Roseanne A. Brown\n\nI’m tagging ANYONE who wants to give this tag a shot!\n\nAhhh this whole tag has only made me want to drop everything and go read a fantasy novel! I don’t even know which one! But I just want the magic and tension and high stakes of a good book to immerse myself in!\n\nLet me know you think! What kind of fantasy reader do you consider yourself? What is your ultimate favourite fantasy book? What fantasy worlds/stories would you love to visit yourself?\n\nHappy reading!\n\n~ Rendz\n\nGreetings readers!\n\nI’ve been in a creative blog slump as of late because I’ve been busy enjoying my reading and doing other things. Not to mention some big things I’m preparing for a certain celebratory month that is coming up soon (more on that later!)\n\nI found this tag on Kaya @ A Fictional Bookworm’s blog! I had so much fun reading through her answers that I decided to have a go at it myself!\n\nWould you rather only read ebooks or audiobooks?\n\nGreetings readers!\n\nLast month, Mandy and Sha from Book Princess Reviews created this splendid tag to celebrate the amazing Disney movie that is Hercules!\n\nWith the announcement of the live action of Disney’s Hercules on the way, I couldn’t be more excited to do this tag!! This movie has a great story, yes, but it also has some of the greatest songs! Shower concerts are always pumping when a Hercules song pops in 😉\n\nZero to Hero – Name a Character That You Didn’t Think Much Of At First But Ended Up a Favorite\n\nLee – Fireborne by Rosaria Munda\n\nI didn’t love Lee at the beginning of this story because he was just so golden-boy and some of the stuff he did I just couldn’t get behind. Nevertheless, I really warmed to him in the end. He made some really tough choices and I had to give him credit for them!\n\nThe Muses – Name Some Characters/Books/Authors That Inspire You\n\nCharacters: Laia of Serra, Cress Darnell, Nina Beaulieu\n\nBooks: Gods of Jade and Shadow, The Penderwicks, Empire of Sand\n\nAuthors: Sabaa Tahir, Marie Lu, Marissa Meyer\n\nMegara – Name a Character Who Has to Do Morally Complex Things To Save Themselves/Others/World\n\nViridiana – Untamed Shore by Silvia Moreno-Garcia\n\nOh yess she does some shady things. I mean other characters do even worse things, but I really liked reading about Viridiana getting herself out of some serious trouble that she is lured into. This crime story has lots of morally complex things going on so I definitely recommend picking it up if you’re into that!\n\nHercules – Character That Goes Through a Huge Change\n\nMaia Tamarin – Spin the Dawn by Elizabeth Lim\n\nOne transformation is obviously the disguise as the boy to enter the competition and so on, but I feel like Maia goes through a lot in this book. She learns so much and embraces new techniques in the hope of becoming the best. Plus she goes through a rather BIG and DANGEROUS transformation at the end so…\n\nI Won’t Say (I’m in Love) – Name Your Favorite Romance With the Miscommunication Trope\n\nOh geez, what romance doesn’t have this trope!!! Honestly I don’t love this trope, but if I had to choose one book that I love…\n\nThe Wedding Date by Jasmine Guillory\n\nI’m pretty sure this book has miscommunication or rather lack of communication in it. I really enjoyed how the author explored the struggle between the characters though and 10/10 I would read it again!\n\nHades – Name a Villain That Stole the Show\n\nAdelina Amouteru – The Young Elites by Marie Lu\n\nThis trilogy follows the villain origin story of a young girl so of course she steals the show! It is action-packed, magical and heart-wrenching all in one! I love this trilogy and it deserves your love too, especially those of you who love villainous characters.\n\nGreetings readers!\n\nWhen I was young, we didn’t have internet in our home. Trust me, I’m not that old, it’s just that my parents didn’t think the internet was essential until my sisters got older and needed it for school and such. That being said, I didn’t play video games growing up. No Nintendo or Wii for me. The most I got was a hand-me down Tamagotchi from my eldest sister.\n\nAll this to say that I still am not that into video games and I haven’t played the famous Animal Crossing that has taken over the world.\n\nAm I still doing the tag? Absolutely! Because we are here for books.\n\nMany thanks to the lovely blogger Michaela @ Journey into Books for tagging me!\n\nPast Villager – Who is a character you found when you were younger that still has a place in your heart?\n\nI wasn’t much of a reader as a kid-kid and to say one of the Pevensie siblings would be cheating because I was more into the movies. I guess the first book character that really stuck with me would be Amy Flowers from the Accidentally series by Lisa Papademetriou.\n\nI think it was the fact that she blushed so easily was super relatable to me hahaha\n\nBlather’s Blatherings – Recommend a historical fiction book that you think everybody should read.\n\nThe Sisters of the Winter Wood by Rena Rossner\n\nThis is an amazing story set in the early 20th century (possibly late 19th century) that follows the adventures of two sisters. It is infused with Jewish folklore and tradition in the historic context. The writing is gorgeous and the plot is absolutely riveting! I cannot recommend this book enough! READ IT!\n\nCeleste’s Wish – What is a future book release you wish you could read now?\n\nA Sky Beyond the Storm by Sabaa Tahir\n\nI have waited long and patiently for this book, but given the chance I would read this book right now and tune out the rest of the world just to be destroyed by this book!\n\nTimmy and Tommy – What is your favourite sibling relationship in a book?\n\nThe Penderwicks.\n\nI adore my sisters, but is there ever a time I wish we could be more like these siblings? The answer is yes. They are just so loving and messy and funnt. My sisters are as well, but there is just something so quintessentially honourable and endearing about these siblings that I would love to be a part of their family.\n\nThe Easter Bunny – A popular book character that you’re not a big fan of.\n\nMy oh my what could be my answer….Aelin Galanthinyus or however the hell you spell her name. I hate her.\n\nAnd her Rowan Whitehorn. Bleh. Trash trash trash.\n\nNook’s Loans – An author you’d give all your money to.\n\nI would? I already do give my money to the following authors:\n\nMarissa Meyer\n\nMarie Lu\n\nSilvia Moreno-Garcia\n\nI own very large collections for all of these authors and I hope to keep growing them!\n\nThe Sisters Able – What is your favourite fictional family (found or otherwise)?\n\nThe Rampion Crew!\n\nI love this group of children so much! I think they are the first found family I encountered in my reading journeys and I am still so in love with them! Having recently reread the books, I enjoyed going back and re-falling in love with these personalities.\n\nIt’s a C+ – What is a book trope that you don’t like that keeps popping up?\n\nThere were golden specks in [their] eyes\n\nI used to be a sucker for this trope, but now it is just plain annoying to me. Especially since this is how authors make brown eyes “sexier.” If there is not that glitter than they’re just plain brown and that is so unfair to the majority brown-eyes population that deserve their eye-colour to be romanticized too without the over-used gold glimmers.\n\nSuper obvious secret identities\n\nIf the characters are looking for lost royalty obviously the main character is said lost royal!!!!!!!!!! I’m being a little hypocritical here because hello the Lunar Chronicles is exactly that plot for the first book, but still this trope is so obvious can we just not in new books! Or at least make it harder to decipher!!!!!!\n\nThe Wedding Camel – What is your favourite book set in a land far away from yours?\n\nThe Wolf of Oren-Yaro by K.S. Villoso is the most recent book I read that is set in a world far different from my own! It is so cutthroat and intriguing at the same time! I loved the world so much and I bought the companion series for the sole joy of re-immersing myself into that world!\n\nWhat Would Dodos Do? – A fictional land you wish you could fly away to at any moment?\n\nNarnia. No doubt about it. I always tell my family that given the opportunity to go to Narnia, I wouldn’t even hesitate to take the chance. It makes my mom a little sad…but it’s the truth XD\n\nI Tag…\n\nAnyone who is interested in playing! Especially the Animal Crossings fans out there!\n\nLet me know what you think! Have you played Animal Crossing? Do you play a lot of video games? What book would you love to become a video game?\n\nHappy reading!\n\n~ Rendz\n\nGreetings readers!\n\nI feel like I haven’t done a tag in ages, so here I am with one that is long, long overdue.

THIS SERIES IS SO INCREDIBLE AHH.

It is action packed and there are lots of twists!\n\nPrincess: I’m definitely a cross between Moana and Merida. All curls, all day.\n\nBook: The Beauty of the Moment by Tanaz Bhathena.
