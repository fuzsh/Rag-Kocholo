(NYSE:PLOW), the North American leader in the design, manufacture and sale of snow and ice control equipment for light trucks, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2010.\n\nFourth Quarter Results\n\nDouglas Dynamics' fourth quarter follows its pre-season sales period in which distributors were offered pre-season pricing and payment deferral until the fourth quarter to encourage them to re-stock their inventory in anticipation of their peak fourth quarter retail sales period. Therefore, sales to distributors in Douglas Dynamics' fourth quarter vary from year-to-year as the fourth quarter is primarily driven by the level, timing and location of snowfall during the quarter as well as general economic conditions.\n\nIn the fourth quarter 2010, net sales were $48.5 million, representing a 1.4% decrease from the corresponding period in 2009. This slight decrease in net sales reflects the late start to the snow season in the Company's key markets. In many areas, significant snowfall did not begin until late December. Parts and accessories sales remained strong, at a similar level to the prior year, driven by the continued trend toward repair rather than replacement as a result of continuing poor economic conditions.\n\nJames L. Janik, President and Chief Executive Officer of Douglas Dynamics, commented, \"We are pleased with our fourth quarter performance despite the late start to the snow season, which did not occur in time to generate significant demand that would impact 2010 results. We were able to produce results that were in line with our previously stated guidance and the record storms in late December and so far in 2011 bode well for a solid start to 2011 for the Company.\"\n\nJanik added, \"Sales of parts and accessories continued to be strong, trending higher than the average when compared to the preceding ten years, which we believe to largely be the result of the continued deferral of new equipment purchases during a slow period of economic recovery.\"\n\nNet income was $5.1 million, or $0.23 per diluted share based on weighted average shares of 21.6 million shares, in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to net income of $5.9 million, or $0.40 per diluted share based on weighted average shares of 14.7 million shares, in the fourth quarter of 2009.\n\nThe Company reported Adjusted EBITDA of $15.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, an 11.1% decrease compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $17.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA is primarily attributable to lower equipment unit shipments during the quarter and shifts in product sales mix toward lower margin mounts which is typical of the fourth quarter when distributors restock these parts to meet in-season demand.\n\nFull Year Results\n\nFor the full year 2010, net sales were $176.8 million, representing a 1.4% increase from the corresponding period in 2009.\n\nNet income was $1.7 million, or $0.09 per diluted share based on weighted average shares of 19.3 million shares, for the full year 2010 compared to net income of $9.8 million, or $0.67 per diluted share based on weighted average shares of 14.7 million shares, for the full year 2009. Net income for the full year 2010 reflected the impact of non-recurring expenses, net of tax, incurred in connection with the Company's initial public offering totaling $11.0 million. Adjusted net income (net income excluding these expenses) was $12.7 million, or $0.66 per diluted share.\n\nThe Company reported Adjusted EBITDA of $47.3 million for the full year 2010, a 4.8% increase compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $45.2 million for the full year 2009.\n\nThe effective tax rate for the full year 2010 was 34.4%.\n\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\n\nFor the full year 2010, the Company recorded net cash provided by operating activities of $15.8 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $25.6 million in the same period last year. The net cash provided by operating activities in 2010 includes the non-recurring negative impact of $6.8 million relating to the Company's initial public offering.\n\nInventory was $23.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2010, a decrease of $3.2 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, which was in line with the Company's expectations.\n\nAccounts receivable at the end of fourth quarter of 2010 were $37.0 million, an increase of $4.9 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase in accounts receivable results from an increase in shipments in December 2010 versus the prior year.\n\nRevolver borrowings at the end of the third quarter totaling $37.0 million were completely paid off by the end of the year. This is in line with historical expectations.\n\nDividend Policy\n\nAs previously announced, pursuant to the Company's dividend policy, its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share of the Company's common stock. The declared $0.20 per share cash dividend was paid on December 31, 2010 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 21, 2010. The quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share represented an increase of 9.6% from the initial quarterly dividend paid on September 30, 2010.\n\nIn addition to regular quarterly dividends the Company currently anticipates paying in calendar year 2011, the Company also announced in a separate press release this morning that its Board of Directors has declared a special cash dividend of $0.37 per share on the Company's common stock, for a total special dividend payment of approximately $8.0 million. The special dividend will be payable to shareholders of record as of March 21, 2011 and will be paid on March 31, 2011.\n\nJames L. Janik, President and Chief Executive Officer of Douglas Dynamics, commented, \"Our priorities for excess cash remain the same: debt pay-down, acquisitions and dividends. In light of the fact that we have recently begun to evaluate opportunities to restructure our debt and had not completed any acquisitions as of December 31, 2010 based on our disciplined acquisition strategy, the board decided it was appropriate to return some excess cash to shareholders in the form of a one-time special dividend. This decision reflects the Company's strong cash flow from operations and our confidence in the Company's financial strength.\"\n\nOutlook\n\nConsistent with previously stated annual range guidance, the Company expects Adjusted EBITDA in any given year to be in a range from $35.0 million to $75.0 million. Pursuant to the Company's financial guidance practices, the Company intends to update and narrow its outlook in conjunction with its second quarter 2011 earnings press release.\n\nThe estimated effective tax rate for 2011 is 38.0%.\n\nMr. Janik concluded, \"We made significant progress over the course of 2010 as we successfully completed our initial public offering, executed against various operational initiatives designed to increase efficiencies across our organization, and delivered solid financial results despite the challenging economy. As we have stated in the past, the potential adjusted EBITDA range for our company is between $35 and $75 million in any given year. The bottom end of that range assumes a poor economy and poor snowfall, while the top end assumes a strong economy and strong snowfall. As we look at 2011, we do not believe either extreme end of the range will occur. We are optimistic that the significant snowfall that began very late in 2010 and continued into the first quarter will help drive the flow of pent-up demand for equipment replacement throughout our business. While snowfall is a very important driver of our results, we are also awaiting and are well prepared to benefit from the beginnings of a multi-year replacement cycle as the economy continues its slow recovery.\"\n\nWebcast Information\n\nThe Company will host an investor conference call on Tuesday, March 8, 2011 at 10:00 a.m. Central Standard Time.

Additional press releases and investor relations information is available at .\n\nThe Douglas Dynamics, Inc. logo is available at\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThis press release contains financial information calculated other than in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"). These non-GAAP measures include:\n\nAdjusted net income;\n\nAdjusted earnings per diluted share; and\n\nAdjusted EBITDA.\n\nThese non-GAAP disclosures should not be construed as an alternative to the reported results determined in accordance with GAAP.\n\nAdjusted net income and Adjusted earnings per diluted share represent net income or earnings per diluted share, respectively, as determined under GAAP, excluding non-recurring expenses incurred at the time of our initial public offering, namely the buyout of our management services agreement, the loss on extinguishment of debt, stock based compensation expense associated with the net exercise of stock options, and the payment of cash bonuses under our liquidity bonus plan. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted for certain non-recurring charges related to the closure of our Johnson City, Tennessee manufacturing facility, and certain unrelated legal expenses, as well as management fees paid by the Company to affiliates of the Company's principal stockholders, stock based compensation, payment of cash bonuses under our liquidity bonus plan and loss on extinguishment of debt.\n\nThe Company uses, and believes investors benefit from the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA in evaluating our operating performance because it provides the Company and its investors with additional tools to compare its operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect the Company's core operations. In addition, the Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and other external users of its consolidated financial statements in evaluating the Company's operating performance as compared to that of other companies, because it allows them to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense, taxes, depreciation and depletion, and amortization and accretion, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets and liabilities, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired. The Company's management also uses Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes, including the preparation of its annual operating budget and financial projections. Management also uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the Company's ability to make certain payments, including dividends, in compliance with its senior credit facilities, which is determined based on a calculation of \"Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA\" that is substantially similar to Adjusted EBITDA.\n\nManagement believes that the presentation of Adjusted net income and Adjusted earnings per diluted share provides useful information to investors by facilitating comparisons to the Company's historical performance.\n\nConsistent with Regulation G under the U.S. federal securities laws, the non-GAAP measures in this press release have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure, and this reconciliation is located under the headings \"Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted Net Income\" and \"Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\" following the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, included in this press release.\n\nForward Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
