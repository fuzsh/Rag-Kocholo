        "text": "\"[The Vlachs] never kept their word to anyone, not even to the ancient Roman Emperors. Having been attacked in war by Emperor Trajan and having been defeated totally, they were subdued and their King, named Decebal, was killed and his head was put on a pike and brought to the city of the Romans. These [Vlachs] are, in fact, the so-called Dacians, also called Bessians [Bessoi]. Earlier they lived in the vicinity of the Danube and Saos, a river which we now call Sava, where the Serbians live today, and [later] withdrew to their inaccessible fortifications. Relying upon these fortifications, they feigned friendship and submission to the ancient Roman Emperors and then swept down from their strongholds and plundered the Roman provinces. Therefore, the exasperated Romans crushed them. And these left the region: some of them were dispersed to Epirus and Macedonia, and a large number established themselves in Hellas.\"\n\nthe text from Kekaumenos, \"Ethnic Continuity in the Carpatho-Danubian Area\", Elemér Illyés\n\nFor a Byzantine general like Kekaumenos, \"along the Danube and Sava\" obviously meant the land east of\n\nSirmium,towards Belgrade,Branicevo and Vidin.Sirmium,the most important Danubian town\n\nfor the Byzantines,a place of great strategic importance,especially in the relations with the\n\nHungarians,must have been eventually one of the main sources of informations for Kekaumenos.\n\nThe Byzantine military chief of Sirmium had the title of \"strategos of Serbia\",who was in charge\n\nto defend a large section of the Danubian frontier,from this city until Vidin,that's why Kekaumenos\n\nuses the words \"along the Danube and Sava,WHERE NOW THE SERBS LIVE\".\n\nThe Byzantines' most frequent name for the Hungarians was \"Dacians\",this,corroborated with\n\nanother geographical reference, the frontier of\"the Danube and Sava\",points that Kekaumenos obvioulsly places\n\nthe \"Dacian\" Vlachs, in the territory located north of the Danubian sector between Sirmium and Vidin,\n\nin/near the Hungarian lands.For the Byzantines,the Hungarians and the Dacian Vlachs are \"Dacians\",\n\nwhile the Bulgarians(with the core in the NE part of the country) and the Vlachs from the Haemus(Balkan\n\nMountains) are \"Mysians\".\n\nBut the Vlachs are also the \"Bessi\"from the Byzantine Empire,so the military mind conceives their\n\nhomeland in the contact zone with the Hungarian state,\"along the Danube and Sava',to justify\n\nthe present \"dispersion\" and differentiation(Byzantine Bessi vs. Hungarian Dacians).\n\nAfter Basil II's conquest of Bulgaria,the ecclesiastical structure is\n\nreorganized in this territory,the seat of Vlach bishop was in Vreanoti,\n\ntoday's Vranje,located in the\n\nvalley of Southern Morava,which is part of the \"land of Bessi\".\n\nThat's why Kekaumenos was definitely not the only Byzantine/Greek\n\nwho knew about the Vlach communities from this area.\n\n\"Komnena, like other Byzantine authoers, generally refers to the Hungarians as Dacians.\"\n\n(Elemer Illyes,\"Ethnic Continuity in the Carpatho-Danubian Area\")\n\nfrom Paul Stephenson,\"Byzantium's Balkan Frontier\":\n\n\"Anna adds that they were inspired\n\nby the treachery of the Dacians. The latter were clearly the\n\nHungarians;\n\n\"A glance at any map of the middle Byzantine empire at its ‘apogee’ in\n\n1025 will show that Basil II exercised authority throughout the lands of\n\nthe southern Slavs, and the border of his empire ran west along the Sava\n\nand Danube from Sirmium to the Black Sea, and south the length of the\n\nAdriatic coast from Istria through Dyrrachium and into Greece.\"\n\n\"In 1018 the patrikios Constantine Diogenes was designated commander\n\nin Sirmium and the neighbouring territories. The geographical\n\nrange of Constantine Diogenes’ powers is remarkable, and he seems to\n\nhave enjoyed de iure authority across a wide, if poorly defined region\n\nwhich stretched from Sirmium at least as far as Vidin, and then south\n\ninto the mountains of Raska (modern Serbia) and Bosna (Bosnia). A seal\n\nin the Dumbarton Oaks collection bearing the legend ‘Constantine\n\nDiogenes, [. . .] strategos of Serbia’ can only be attributed to this character.\"\n\n\"Geza I pursued a more friendly policy towards Byzantium. He was\n\nmarried, probably in 1075, to the daughter of the Byzantine aristocrat\n\nTheodoulus Synadenus,3 and received at that time the famous crown\n\nwhich bears (on the reverse) his portrait on an enamel plaque beneath\n\nthat of the emperor Michael VII Ducas, and beside the image of\n\nConstantine Ducas the porphyrogennetos.\"\n\n\"After the Byzantine defeats at Bari and Mantzikert in 1071 imperial authority\n\nwas challenged throughout the empire and from beyond the frontiers.\n\nThe Hungarian Chronicle relates how Belgrade came under attack\n\nfrom the Hungarian King Salomon, where the Bulgarian and Greek\n\ndefenders used ‘Greek fire’ to set light to the Magyars’ ships. To deflect a\n\nsecond assault they appealed to the Pechenegs (Bisseni), upon whom the\n\nMagyars inflicted great slaughter. The besieged city fell after three months,\n\nand many of the inhabitants were put to the sword before Salomon, and\n\nthe dukes Geza and Ladislas marched on to Nis, seizing much plunder en\n\nroute. The situation was resolved by negotiation soon thereafter, but it seems\n\nprobable that Salomon was allowed to keep the former Byzantine outpost\n\nof Sirmium (modern Sremska Mitrovica), which sat on the northern bank\n\nof the Sava, opposite the residence of the bishop of Sirmium (at\n\nMacvanska Mitrovica)\"\n\n\"In the same\n\nway, the peoples who occupied the various lands might be called\n\n‘Bulgarians’ (Boulgaroi), although other names were used more frequently,\n\nand with little concern for contemporary accuracy. Thus the\n\nBulgarians are often called Mysoi, Mysians (but not Moesians) because\n\nthey occupied the lands of the former Roman province of Moesia.\"\n\n\"The Vlach-Bulgar rebellion was provoked by an arbitrary imperial\n\ndecision to levy taxes. Choniates relates that, in order\n\nto raise money to celebrate his marriage to the daughter of Bela III,\n\nIsaac levied an extraordinary tax. This fell most heavily on the settlements\n\nin the vicinity of Anchialus and the Haemus mountains where the\n\n‘barbarians . . . . formerly called Mysians (Mysoi), and now named Vlachs\n\n(Vlachoi)’, were provoked to rebel\"\n\n\"The region between the Sava and the Danube was then ceded by\n\nMichael VII to Geza, in 1075, so that he would secure an ally and save at least the region\n\neast of Belgrade, which remained under Byzantine rule nearly until the collapse of the\n\nempire in 1204.\"\n\n\"Confrontations between Hungary,\n\nthe Byzantine Empire and Bulgaria\n\nfor the Belgrade–Vidin Border Region\n\nin the 9th-14th Centuries\",Alexandru Madgearu\n\n\"Donja Ljubata is situated ca. 15 km west of Bosilegrad,\n\nat the natural communication connecting this region\n\nwith the Vranje–Bujanovac Basin\"\n\n\"Bowl from Davidovac, situated between Vranje and\n\nBujanovac, decorated with cogwheel tool and circular stamps, kept\n\nin the National Museum in Vranje.\"\n\nhttps://www.google.ro/url?sa=t&rct=...Rkf0FvA3bbw0h1SkTziVnA&bvm=bv.127984354,d.bGs\n\n\"Nadalje ,u njoj se prvi pu t spominju vlaški vjernici koji su raštrkani na čitavom područj u tearhiepiskopije , tak o reći na čitavom Balkanu .

This fell most heavily on the settlements\n\nin the vicinity of Anchialus and the Haemus mountains where the\n\n‘barbarians . . . . formerly called Mysians (Mysoi), and now named Vlachs\n\n(Vlachoi)’, were provoked to rebel\"\n\n\"Once he had reached\n\nNisˇ, as we have seen, Frederick met with Stefan Nemanja and his brothers,\n\nand had received envoys from Peter and Asen. Moreover, once the\n\nGerman emperor had arrived at Adrianople, he once again approached\n\n‘Kalopetrus’ who offered 40,000 Vlach and Cuman archers for an\n\nassault on Constantinople, and once the city was taken, requested that\n\nthe emperor present him ‘with the imperial crown of the realm of\n\nGreece (coronam imperialem regni Grecie)’.(Byzantium Balkan Frontier)\n\n\"Markeri STR autozomali\n\nUn număr de 5777 probe biologice au fost împărţite în 4 macroregiuni istorice astfel:\n\nValahia - probe biologice recoltate de la un număr de 1910 persoane provenite din 14\n\ndin cele 15 județe ale regiunii: Argeş (259), Brăila (148), Buzău (10), Călăraşi (11),\n\nDâmboviţa (215), Dolj (288), Giurgiu (114), Gorj (154), Ialomiţa (117), Ilfov (113),\n\nMehedinţi (122), Olt (20), Prahova (331) şi Teleorman (8);\"\n\n\"Nu exista diferente între Moldova si populatia din Bucuresti.\"\n\nFrom \"Byzantium's Balkan Frontier\":\n\nPeter and Asen came to Kypsella in spring  in search of concessions.\n\nThey hoped to be granted privileges by a new emperor, and their\n\nhope was well founded, since Byzantine emperors regularly granted\n\nlocal rulers in the northern Balkans such concessions. However, they\n\nwere insulted and dismissed. Isaac Angelus had decided to make an\n\nexample of the upstart Vlachs. He must have imagined he could control\n\nthe pastoralists, and determined that crushing their uprising would gain\n\nhim much needed military credibility. However, and in spite of his\n\nattempt to prove otherwise by announcing false victories to the faithful\n\nin Constantinople, Isaac had miscalculated, and it proved to be costly.\n\nNevertheless, the escalation of the Vlach rebellion was not inevitable,\n\nnor was it based on an ethnic, still less a ‘national’, grievance against\n\nByzantine rule. Both Vlachs and Bulgarians played a major role in the\n\nescalation of the rebellion, but others fought on the Byzantine side.\n\nMeanwhile, however, the Vlachs and Bulgars made unprecedented\n\nadvances. Whereas previously their assaults had been concentrated\n\non villages and fields, now they advanced against ‘lofty-towered\n\ncities. They sacked Anchialus, took Varna by force, and advanced on\n\nTriaditza, the ancient Sardica, where they razed the greater part of the\n\ncity. They also emptied Stoumbion [south-west of Sardica on the upper\n\nStrymon] of its inhabitants, and carried away large numbers of men\n\nand animals from Nisˇ.’\n\n\"The Byzantine campaigns of autumn  were, by all extant\n\naccounts, successful. Forces despatched to the north-east recovered\n\nVarna and Anchialus, and the latter was reinforced with towers and a\n\ngarrison.72 Isaac himself led a campaign against the Vlachs and Cumans\n\nfrom Philippopolis, and from there continued on to confront Stefan\n\nNemanja\"\n\n\"More threatening for the empire was the fact that, after Isaac’s demise,\n\nthe nature of Vlach-Bulgar raids changed. Whereas before  they\n\nwere content to plunder lands south of the Haemus and around the\n\nBlack Sea ports, which remained in Byzantine hands, from  the\n\nVlach-Bulgars began to contemplate permanent possession of both\n\nkastra and cities.\"\n\n\"Ivanko, who had fled\n\nto Constantinople, was betrothed to Alexius III’s granddaughter, an\n\nexceptional prize for the pretender to a realm the autonomy of which\n\nwas not recognized. Subsequently, he played a crucial role in defending\n\nthe environs of Philippopolis, serving as ‘a precious bulwark against his\n\nown countrymen’. Even so, ‘the devastation of the lands towards the\n\nHaemus and the despoiling of the inscribed monuments and pillars of\n\nMacedonia and Thrace give a more accurate picture of the damage\n\nwrought than any detailed historical account\"\n\n\"The employment of Ivanko and Dobromir-Chrysus against their\n\nfellow Vlachs and Bulgars was not exceptional. As we have seen, it was\n\na standard Byzantine strategy for dealing with recalcitrant peoples to\n\nemploy divide and rule tactics; and nobody knew better how to deal with\n\nhighly mobile Vlach raiding parties than Vlachs.\"\n\nhttps://books.google.ro/books?id=Lv...AB#v=onepage&q=ivanko vlach prisoners&f=false\n\nhttps://izi.travel/en/c1e4-vlasiei-woods-codrii-vlasiei/en\n\nhttp://www.danubiushunters.com/web/\n\nPlovdivian faces:\n\nMilan:\n\nNot every toponym having Vlaška is refering to the Vlachs but the god Veles (god of cattle) similarly the stars Hyades are named Vlašici not because of Vlachs but because of the god Veles.\n\nSee Veles town,Vlaška mountain or valley etc,more often valleys ,you see Do (valley) are connected to the god name.The Vlachs could have received their exonym by South-Slavs later on by their occupation cattle-breeders from the god of cattle Veles.\n\nYour theory has slim chances to be reliable because it is\n\na compromise(Vlach Vlaska vs. Veles' Vlaska),the term\n\ncomes from Vlas(i) plus the suffix \"-ka\",like in\n\nHrvatska.\n\nThe only metathesys that Veles had suffered was through\n\nChristianity,when his horns and tale were chopped off,\n\nbut it doesn't mean that we can't feel the original vibe\n\nin the present.\n\nI had strong arguments for the fact that I2a was ultimately also\n\nspread by populations having mostly Dinaric racial traits:\n\n-it is very present among Serbs,Croats,Bosniaks,they all share this\n\nanthropological feature\n\n-in Romania I2a only partly corresponds the Slavic imput,while the\n\nbigger Balkanic-like one must have haplogroups too.\n\n-this set of genes was transplanted to the northwestern Carpathians,\n\nthe association of I2a(30%) with E-V13(15%) from the Moravian Vlach\n\nlineages supports the Romanian origin of this group.Many of them had\n\ncome from Maramures,a region that also has lot of genetical ties with\n\nthe Balkans,the connections with Kosovo shown in the above maps\n\nonly represents a late impulse that had been engaged in Dragos' and\n\nBogdan's movements to Moldavia:\n\n\"The name of\n\nthe Maramuresh noble village of Sarbi8, inhabited by the great families of Berinde9,\n\nBud10 , Feier11 and Tiplea12, descended from Locovoj13 knez of Cosau14, is called\n\nOlahtotfalu, and Cosau comes from Kosovo. The naming of one of the most important\n\nvillages from Maramuresh Olahotfalva in Hungarian and Sarbi in Romanian shows\n\nthe mutual synonymy of the terms in medieval mentality, and the reference to Kosau Kosov\n\nis important.
