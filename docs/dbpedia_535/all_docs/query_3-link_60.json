        "text": "International quantitative studies among children, such as the Health Behaviour of School-Aged Children and the Programme for International Student Assessment have revealed a gap between learning outcomes and children’s subjective well-being across countries. The Children’s Worlds international study showed that liking school decreases from the second to the sixth grade. Compared to other countries the decrease is one of the biggest among schoolchildren in Estonia. The aim of the study is to find in-depth evidence to explain the low level of satisfaction with school life and reasons for the decrease in children liking school in Estonia. The analysis is based on data from eight focus group interviews with 12-year-old children in rural and urban schools. The study showed that children develop negative feelings from various aspects of school life that leads to criticism and a dislike for school. Bullying among children and behavioural shortcomings of teachers (including coping with per...\n\nThis phenomenological inquiry investigated children's wellbeing experiences at school, including their hedonic (feeling good) and eudaimonic (doing good) accounts, a distinction often overlooked. Further, while phenomenological inquiries of children's mental ill-health exist, wellbeing, a fundamental part of mental health, is neglected. This is at odds with positive psychology which favours strengths-based approaches to studying human development. Phenomenology provides rich detail, facilitating deeper understanding of why and how certain factors affect wellbeing, as described by children themselves. A sample of 15 children (aged 9-11), attending one English primary school broadly representative of the national socio-demographic, engaged in interviews. Children's experiences of 'feeling good' at school were characterised by: an interdependence on peers' emotional states (described as 'a domino effect'), a need to feel cared for by, and trust, adults, and desire for autonomy over their time. Children attributed mistrust in adults to adults disregarding seemingly incidental events which felt significant to children. Children experienced 'doing well' as equating to academic attainment, conveying a fixation with test scores, using language of 'correctness' and efficiency. Shame pervaded when 'correctness' was not achieved, with children describing being ridiculed for poor test scores. Recommendations for schools to support children's hedonia include prioritising wellbeing curricula and emotional literacy, greater staff reflexivity, and prioritisation of pupil voice. To foster children's eudaimonia, recommendations include the need for teachers to provide formative, personalised feedback for pupils focused on the learning process, and the need for Government to embrace a range of ways pupils can feel successful beyond academic attainment.\n\nUnderstanding children and adolescents’ psychological well-being is a global imperative. Conducting this type of research in Romania, a country that underwent major transformations in the past two decades at a political, economic, and social level, is even more pressing. Both the family life and school system of the country have been subjected to significant changes (Mărginean, 2002; Robila, 2004; Schifirnet, 2007; Stanciulescu, 2010) and this raises the important questions of how children experience such changes and to what degree their life, education, and well-being are affected by them. This is particularly important since, an accurate identification of how the main actors of the school system in Romania (students and teachers) make sense of psychological well-being, is central for the development of healthy schools and communities, aligned with international standards for contemporary education."
