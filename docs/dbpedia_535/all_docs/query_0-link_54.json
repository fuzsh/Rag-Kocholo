        "text": "I've had a realization about my own learning journey that I believe could resonate with many of you. For the longest time, I struggled with mathematics, finding it significantly more challenging than physics, even though both fields are closely related. But why was this the case? Recently, I stumbled upon a crucial insight – the subjects I feel comfortable in are the ones I can visualize and bring to life in my mind's eye. The ability to imagine and mentally picture concepts has always been my key to feeling comfortable and confident in my studies. Lately, I've been participating in discussions on Coders High, where I've connected with individuals who share their insights and experiences. It was during these conversations that I realized the core reason why math felt elusive to me – I could never quite picture its concepts in the same way I could with physics. This realization has not only given me a deeper understanding of my own learning style. Let's celebrate our unique ways of learning and discovering new methods to make tough subjects more understandable.\n\n👩🏼🏫 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐰𝐞 𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐞𝐝 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐝𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐥𝐨𝐩𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐭𝐞𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚 𝐜𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐬𝐞 𝐚𝐭 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐝!

Here are our top 3 learnings: 🎸 𝐄𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐭𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬 Modeling our favorite classes at Stanford, we tried to make the class as fun and entertaining as possible. This included an Intro-Rap Song, memes and surprising real-life examples.

What we found most helpful is to do a pre-assessment of student skills and frequent check-ins during class about their level of understanding.

Also, I participated in a Research Presentation competition on the eve of Engineer's Day, further fueling my passion for exploration and discovery. 🌐👩💻 Reflecting on personal and academic growth, I am excited to delve deeper into the world of AI with a strong ethical foundation. Cheers to conquering challenges, late-night coding sessions, and forming lasting friendships! 🌌 Looking forward to what the next semesters have in store - let's keep the momentum going! 💪 #AI #EngineeringJourney #FirstSemester #ContinuousLearning #chitkarauniversity\n\nI just completed my first semester in the Artificial Intelligence masters program at University of Texas Austin. I decided to start off with \"Ethics in AI\", which was a great class to just get back into the swing of things after many years out of the classroom. If you are like me and starting to think about diving into world of Artificial Intelligence, well consider this a huge endorsement for this program. If you find yourself with full-time job, full time parenting and everything else...this masters is actually doable. Granted, I only took one class this semester and it will take 3 1/3 years to complete my degree if I only take one course each semester (including summer). The application process for next Spring (classes start January 2025) opens on June 1st. Quick Datapoints... * The classes are super flexible. There are video lectures that you watch when you have time. Homework however, has deadlines you need to turn them in by. The reading is manageable. * You go at your pace, meaning you can take as few or many classes as you want each semester. * The program is offered at $1,000 per class. That's $10,000 for a master's degree at a top 10 Computer Science program. * If you get stuck or have questions, there are TA's assigned to you that have office hours and are super responsive in the chat forums. Your classmates are also super friendly and helpful. * While the masters is online, there is nothing that differentiates it from a Masters that you would earn if you were on campus. This summer semester I am registered for Machine Learning and excited to get going. If anyone in my network is interested in learning more and wanting to chat, I will make time to talk to you and tell you my experience. Until then...\"Hook em Horns!\" https://lnkd.in/gz2e6G7n\n\nIt’s pretty clear to me that generative AI will profoundly shape higher education. I have had a blast brushing up my coding skills and learning new tricks while developing Pruju AI - with patient support and help from Enrico Glerean and Thomas Pfau from the Aalto Research Software Engineers team. Pruju AI acts as a helpful teaching assistant that is designed to answer any student question, but only if the answer can be found in the course materials (e.g., syllabus, slides, lecture transcripts). The assistant can also be guided to answer in ways that align with the course’s pedagogical objectives. It’s a no-brainer application, but a pretty useful at that. With GPT-4 in the background, I think it’s really good actually. Check out a small demo below and stay tuned for more information!

During the session, I discussed the transformative role of Applied AI in our recent use cases. This was a refreshing shift from the intensity of academic writing, where even the most novel ideas could contend with highly competitive review environments. Together, we explored how AI technologies, such as LLMs, can streamline tasks like completing natural language requirements, refining goal models, extracting requirements, and improving regulatory compliance. My goal was to bridge the gap between the research opportunities and challenges and their practical perspectives that can play a role in students' careers in software engineering. If this lecture has sparked curiosity or the ambition to further explore AI for software engineering for even a single student, then I consider it a triumph for myself. Here's to the next generation of software engineers, ready to explore AI and unlock new possibilities in ways we are just beginning to imagine! I want to also extend my thanks to my supervisors and co-authors for their invaluable support and collaboration throughout my academic journey.\n\n🎓 Excited to share that I've successfully completed the \"Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms \" part of \"Algorithms Specialization\" course! 💻 This comprehensive program delved deep into the world of algorithms, equipping me with a robust understanding of fundamental concepts and their practical applications in computer science. 🚀 Throughout this journey, I dedicated countless hours to mastering various algorithms, refining problem-solving skills, and gaining insights into efficient coding practices. 🌐 The knowledge gained is not just theoretical; it's a practical toolkit that I'm eager to apply in real-world scenarios.
