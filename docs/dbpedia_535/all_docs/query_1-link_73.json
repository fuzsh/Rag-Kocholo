        "text": "Personify delivers the software, interactive web solutions, consulting and cloud hosting solutions that help leading associations and non-profits optimize relationships and achieve sustainable success. Personify was adopted as the new corporate brand because the name concisely encapsulates the value they deliver in all of their products and services.\n\nPresident and CEO for Personify, Edi Dor states, “Our company is at the forefront of change in our industry. Our innovative solutions and services help clients personalize their relationships with constituents. The name Personify helps us communicate that promise in a single word.”\n\nTo assist with their rebranding efforts TMA Resources hired Signal Marketing Group, an organization that provides marketing strategy, communications and technology support to companies and organizations.\n\n“We recognize that association and non-profits face multiple challenges today, such as changing demographics and increased sources of completion. Our products and services help such organizations get in front of these challenges, explains Paul Gannon, vice president of marketing for Personify. He continues, “We hired Signal Marketing Group to help us develop a corporate identity to showcase our unique promise of value. The brand Personify does exactly that.”\n\nThe new corporate brand identity includes a new logo, website, and updated messaging that underscores Personify as a company that helps associations optimize relationships. The organization’s web solutions, consulting and hosting services will remain under the corporate brand as Personify Interactive, Personify Consulting, and Personify Cloud respectively.\n\nThe new brand will be unveiled at the ASAE Annual Meeting and Expo, which takes place August 3-6, 2013 in Atlanta, GA.\n\n-30-\n\nPersonify, formerly TMA Resources, delivers the software, consulting, interactive web solutions and cloud hosting solutions that help leading associations optimize relationships to achieve sustainable success. Our solutions help your organization better understand, track and manage the individual interests, behaviors and transactions of constituents in order to enhance loyalty, increase engagement and grow revenues.
