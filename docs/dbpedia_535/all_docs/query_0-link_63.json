        "text": "John P. Janik, Sr. passed away on June 3, 2022, at the age of 81 at Elmbrook Hospital surrounded by loved ones. John is survived by his loving wife of 33 years, Jeanne, of Milwaukee; his children John P. Janik, Jr. (Charmaine), Kim Vomberg, Beth Weirick, Michael Janik (Katie), Mark Janik (Jennifer Longato), Joe Janik (Kelly Kostecki); stepchildren Donna Incrocci (Brad), Judy Dollhopf (Gary Janicki), and David Dollhopf; grandchildren John P Janik, III (Katie), Gary Janik (Sarah), Krystal Vomberg, Amber Vomberg, Justin Nicols (Nora), Shawna Nicols, Lily Janik, Cooper Janik, Nik Janik (Tyler), Nathan Janik; sister Toni Aubrey (Edmund), loving aunt Nancy Janik; 12 great grandchildren; nieces and nephews.\n\nJohn is preceded in death by his father Emil Janik, mother Lillian Janik, and grandchild Noah.\n\nJohn graduated from Pius High School in 1959 and, soon after, married Yvonne and started a family. John was always a productive man; there were times in his life he worked three jobs to provide. John was a mechanic by profession and Mr. Fix It in life! He spent a good portion of his career at Bluemound Automotive; after “retirement” he worked at several other automotive stations in the area. He was never too busy to rescue us when a car broke down, which was often, especially when all the kids were younger. John loved working with his hands, he was incredibly talented and knowledgeable in so many areas. If he wasn’t working on cars, he was helping someone remodel, put up a shed, fix a water heater, lay flooring, you name it, he did it. His intentions were simple, he loved helping his family and friends. He was absolutely a giver in life! Until the very end, he kept his hands busy constructing things out of popsicle sticks, wrappers, or any little thing he could find.\n\nJohn had many medical issues through the last decade; however, he persevered with strength, sass, and a smile. This was a man so mentally tough, that once upon a time he cut the tip of his finger off, glued it back on and kept working. Despite the challenges he faced, John stayed strong until the end, always showing love and concern for others, and always happy to see his kids and grandkids. He was blessed to have his wife, best friend and caretaker, Jeanne, by his side all these years. She helped him focus on the positives, keeping his life full of love and adventure.\n\nJohn spent a lot of his time creating magical spaces filled with wonder in his garden and in his home. His creative Christmas décor was always a site to see. John loved traveling to Las Vegas and Biloxi with his wife, who shared his passion for making memories, his mother (Lillian), and other members of the family. This High Roller had his lucky moments, but in reality, it was just for fun, and new friendships made along the way. Throughout his life John also enjoyed golfing, fishing trips to Canada with family and friends, motorcycling, and Great Danes. His motorcycle license plate embodied the essence of his sassy spirit stating “URAQT.”\n\nJohn, we love you and we will miss your mischievous laughter, which will forever echo in our hearts. You will always remain our go-to fix it guy even though you’ve taken your toolbox to Heaven.\n\nA Memorial Service will be held on Friday, July 15, 2022, at Krause Funeral Home, 12401 West National Avenue, New Berlin, Wisconsin. Visitation will be from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM with a service immediately following.\n\nMemorials appreciated to the Alzheimer’s Association."
