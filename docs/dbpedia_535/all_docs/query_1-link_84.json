(NYSE: PLOW), North America’s premier manufacturer and upfitter of work truck attachments and equipment, today announced its planned CEO transition plan.\n\nJames L. Janik (Jim) will transition from his role as President and Chief Executive Officer, effective December 31, 2018, to lead the Board of Directors as Executive Chairman. In his new role, Mr. Janik will continue to play a key role in the development of the Company’s strategy, merger and acquisition activity, investor relations, and executive talent development. The Board of Directors has appointed current Chief Operating Officer, Robert McCormick (Bob), to serve as successor to Mr. Janik as President and Chief Executive Officer, with his appointment to be effective January 1, 2019. Mr. McCormick will also join the Board of Directors effective January 1.\n\nDuring Mr. Janik’s illustrious 26-year career at the Company, Douglas Dynamics has grown from a relatively small company, with approximately 250 employees and approximately $34 million in sales in 1992, to a NYSE-listed public company with approximately 1,700 employees and sales expected to be in the region of $500 million for 2018.\n\nLead Independent Director James D. Staley stated, \"On behalf of everyone at Douglas Dynamics, the Board of Directors would like to thank Jim for his exemplary leadership and dedicated service as President and CEO. It is hard to overstate the importance of his innumerable contributions during the past 18 years leading the Company, which have significantly changed both Douglas Dynamics and the industry for the better. We are pleased Jim will remain a leader of the Company as Executive Chairman.”\n\nMr. Staley continued, \"We believe that Bob is the best and natural choice to succeed Jim, given his demonstrated success in both the COO and CFO roles and his proven ability to enhance culture and ensure that customers remain at the center of our strategy. Our Board has full confidence that Bob is ready to take the next step and assume the President & CEO role. We expect a seamless transition, as we have been preparing for this transition for some time.”\n\nCurrent Chairman, President and CEO James L. Janik noted, “During my 26 years at Douglas Dynamics, the Company and industry have experienced dramatic changes, and I am proud of my contributions and everything we have accomplished together. The strength of this Company is driven by all its employees and the culture of teamwork and continuous improvement we have cultivated over the years. Given the Company’s current robust financial and operating position, Bob’s achievements and experience, the successful integration of our recent acquisitions, plus the quality and depth of the overall management team, I firmly believe this is the perfect time for me to start to transition the CEO role. Having worked closely with Bob for the past 14 years, I know the Company is in great hands and that Bob will hit the ground running, continuing to drive profitable growth and operational improvements across all areas of the business. It has been my privilege to lead this great team, and I look forward to continuing to serve the Company as Executive Chairman.”\n\nCurrent Chief Operating Officer Bob McCormick commented, “I am honored to have the opportunity to lead Douglas Dynamics and build upon our achievements. As our Company continues to evolve and expand, we are ready to seize the opportunities and face the challenges ahead. We have a fantastic team in place, and we will strive to realize our considerable potential. Jim and I have forged a strong and effective working partnership over the past 14 years, which will continue going forward. We all look forward to continuing to benefit from Jim’s knowledge and expertise.”\n\nJames L. Janik Bio\n\nJames L.
