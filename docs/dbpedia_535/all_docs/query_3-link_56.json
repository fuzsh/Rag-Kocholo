        "text": "Histories of archaeology show that our disciplinary knowledge has immensely diverse origins: not just in terms of interactions with other fields of scientific inquiry, but inside the field of archaeology itself. There are routes of communication outside the “regular” academic channels that have great influence on production and transmission of disciplinary knowledge. In other words: the knowledge that is now perceived as canonical has often been conceived through networks outside institutional circles and their rules. The aim of this paper is to examine one of such networks, webbed around Austrian autodidact, Felix Kanitz, at the beginning of the institutional phase of the Serbian archaeology. In short, Kanitz, in accordance with the Austrian-Hungarian “frontier colonialism”, was the surveyor of archaeological remains of Serbia, someone who had “found” and presented them to the academic as well as wider European audience. His iconic status in Serbian archaeology is shown through the fact that even today his works are the starting point of almost every archaeological project in the country. Kanitz was the heart of the informal network which gathered scientists of different statuses, academic and ethnic origins, and political views. For example, his circle included Theodor Mommsen, with his open hostility towards the Slavs, on the one hand, and some of the greatest promoters of Slavic independence, such as Janko Šafařík or Konstantin Jireček, on the other. All of them, and many others, were part of Kanitz’s invisible college, without whom his great work on the Balkan past would not have been possible.\n\nAs known, Knowledge is a real phenomenon of the human brain, which is observed by the eyes and understanding of the mind of the human and formed through the experience. As it is known from all periods of history, the human's relationships with the environment always call him for new discoveries. Therefore, the emergence of the knowledge is believed firstly started with the transition to agricultural civilization. People's moving from hunter-gathering into sedentary occupation has changed the needs for the life ways and, accordingly, the origins of scientific knowledge have gradually emerged. Human values and pleasures have changed from culture to culture, from time to time and from person to person and mankind has developed technology to meet the needs that it perceives as its own, not the basic necessities that nature has enacted. Therefore, there is widespread agreement that the Prehistoric knowledge is based entirely on experiment. With the development of society, natural phenomena have begun to be examined in more detailed and thus a solid knowledge accumulation has emerged. The undeniable fact is that today, all levels of cultural development in the world have been made possible by the achievements of experimental knowledge. In this research paper, the importance of today's archaeological knowledge was studied as the source of those scientific knowledge that had been possessed by ancient societies through the practical skills.\n\nThis book is a revised and updated version of the monograph Historija arheologije u novim zemljama Jugoistočne Evrope, originally published in Sarajevo in the Bosnian language. It is divided into chapters dedicated to the seven new countries created after the break-up of Yugoslavia and their archaeologies, with the final chapter reflecting the concept of ‘Yugoslav’ archaeology. Each chapter starts with a brief geographical, archaeological and historical introduction of the country in question. In the English edition, these parts are somewhat enlarged to help readers who are not well acquainted with the geography, archaeology and history of the region to contextualise the subject of study better. The main goal of the monograph is a reflection on the development of archaeology and the historical, social and cultural conditions of its knowledge."
