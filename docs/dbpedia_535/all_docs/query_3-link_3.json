In analyzing these issues, the report focuses on the programs implemented in Arkansas, Florida and New Jersey as part of the Cash and Counseling Demonstration, but also briefly addresses variations on the liability analysis for two well-established CDPAS programs, California's In-Home Supportive Services Program and New York's Consumer-Directed Personal Assistance Program. The purpose of this report is twofold: first, to identify the circumstances in which negligence or other misconduct could result in liability and what persons or entities are likely to be liable; and second, to identify steps that can be taken to reduce exposure to such liability.\n\nThe methodology for this analysis involved review of all available program materials and operational procedures, relevant law and regulations, available literature and reports on the state programs,1 and telephone interviews with several key contacts from the three Cash and Counseling programs and the California and New York programs. Legal research revealed that there are very few reported cases that discuss liability issues in the context of government sponsored consumer-directed care. Consequently, much of the legal analysis in this report is based on either the application of basic legal principles of tort law or analogies to comparable situations where appropriate. However, in the case of claims between workers and consumers, there is considerable case law that is directly analogous, in the context of both traditional agency care and privately employed care providers.\n\nAlthough not identical, the Cash and Counseling programs in Arkansas, Florida and New Jersey share the following characteristics:\n\nAll participants are Medicaid recipients who have been determined to be eligible for specific numbers of hours of home care services, based on their level of need or claims history.\n\nThe consumer's eligibility level for traditional Medicaid long term care benefits is converted into a cash benefit amount or \"allowance.\"\n\nConsultants, who are private agencies or individuals with whom the state has contracted, provide supportive services to consumers to help them convert the cash allowance into a spending plan. Most of the consumer's allowance typically is used to pay wages to CDPAS workers, but consumers have the discretion to spend part of their allowance on a variety of goods and services that enable them to function more independently, such as equipment and home modifications.\n\nConsultants are also responsible for advising the consumer about hiring, training and supervising personal assistance workers.\n\nIf the consumer is unable to or does not wish to assume the responsibility of directing his or her own care, the consumer has the option of designating an authorized representative.\n\nIn addition to providing these supportive services from consultants, the state contracts with one or more fiscal intermediary agencies that are available to perform employer bookkeeping functions for the consumer.\n\nOnce the spending plan has been completed and the workers hired, consultants maintain regular contact with the consumer, and consultants and/or fiscal agents periodically review consumer records to check for errors or overspending.\n\nIn this model of consumer-directed care, the state relinquishes considerable control over services to consumers. This raises the concern that in the absence of state control, there may be a decline in the quality of care and that: (1) poor care may result in injury to consumers; and (2) the state or its agents may be held responsible for the injury. However, the preliminary data from the Cash and Counseling Demonstration supports the conclusion that there is no increase in risk of injury to consumers under the consumer-directed model of care, compared to agency-provided care.2\n\nBuilding on that conclusion, this analysis of liability risk (i.e., the risk of being held legally responsible for the injury suffered by another) finds that the risk of liability as between the consumer and the worker is no greater than that encountered under agency provided care. In addition, because in many cases family members serve as CDPAS workers under this model of care, there is, as a practical matter, less likelihood that the parties will seek compensation for personal injuries in the courts.\n\nPutting aside any impact of familial relationships, personal assistance workers face a heightened theoretical risk of liability if they are negligent in performing caregiving duties, compared to agency provided care, because in the latter structure the agency shoulders the ultimate responsibility for injury under the doctrine of vicarious liability. Absent the agency, the individual worker employed by the consumer bears the sole legal responsibility for injuries caused by the worker's negligence. However, the practical likelihood of liability is influenced by the extent of assets or insurance owned by a prospective defendant. Individuals providing personal assistance are likely to have insignificant assets compared to agencies and in practical terms, are therefore likely to be \"judgment proof.\"\n\nIn the case of injury to workers while on the job, liability risk is affected dramatically by the availability of workers' compensation. Where workers are not covered by workers' compensation benefits, consumers who have assets are more likely to be subject to suit for compensation if a worker is injured on the job, because of the absence of other remedies. Workers' compensation provides a relatively simple administrative remedy to injured workers and, at the same time, bars most personal injury actions by the worker against the consumer.\n\nWith respect to other actors in the provision of services -- i.e., the state sponsoring agency, consultants, fiscal agents, public authorities (as in California), or consumer-directed provider agencies (as in New York) -- this analysis finds that their liability risk is limited to the specific tasks they perform, with minimal risk of vicarious liability for personal injury negligently caused by personal assistance workers. The risk of direct liability is also relatively very low because of each actor's limited functions. Thus, in general, delivering home care services through the Cash and Counseling model or a similar consumer-directed structure results in a relatively low level of liability risk where employer and support functions are \"unbundled\" in a clearly defined and communicated fashion.\n\nSeeking to provide a broad taxonomy of all possible tort liability risks, this report identifies the following liability risks for each of the actors in consumer-directed care:\n\nWorker's Liability Risk\n\nSection II.A and Section II.C discuss the following liability risks for workers:\n\nNegligent caregiving. Case law demonstrates that individual workers face a significant risk that they may be found liable if they are negligent in performing their caregiving duties, including leaving the consumer unattended. However, if a worker's income and assets are low or modest, as is the case for many in this field, the worker may, in practical terms, be \"judgment proof.\" From this perspective, the risk of enforceable liability for negligent caregiving is a risk that is not likely to materialize (Section II.A.1).\n\nNegligence in non-caregiving matters. A worker may be found liable for negligence in non-caregiving activities, most notably creating a hazard in the consumer's home. However, here, again, if a worker does not have sufficient income or assets to pay the judgment in a damage action, this is a risk that is not likely to materialize (Section II.A.2).\n\nFailure to report abuse or neglect. A worker may be a mandatory reporter under the state's adult protective services (APS) law and may therefore be both civilly and criminally liable for failure to report abuse or neglect that comes to attention of the worker. However, liability can easily be avoided by complying with the APS law (Section II.A.3.a). As a practical matter, workers employed by the consumer or the consumer's representative, especially if the worker is a family member, may have greater emotional or economic barriers to reporting, compared to agency-employed workers.\n\nLiability for abuse or neglect. A worker may be criminally liable under the state's APS law if the worker abuses or neglects the consumer. This is a low level risk because of the infrequency of encountering worker misconduct that rises to the level of abuse or neglect. Of course, on the rare occasions when it does occur, the injury to the consumer can be extremely serious (Section II.A.3.b).\n\nLiability for injury to third party caused by the worker. The worker and the consumer are potentially liable for injuries to third parties caused by the worker while acting within the scope of employment. The worker's liability is direct, i.e., flowing directly from his or her own action or inaction, while the consumer's risk of liability is vicarious, arising from the employer-employee doctrine of respondeat superior. Unless the worker and the consumer have sufficient income or assets to pay the judgment in a damage action, this too is a risk that has a low probability of materializing (Section II.C).\n\nLiability for injury to third party caused by consumer. A third party may claim that an injury inflicted by a consumer was caused by the negligent care or supervision of the worker, thus making the worker liable for damages. However, such claims are rare and are likely to be dismissed for failure to prove that the worker owed a duty of care to the third party (Section II.C).\n\nConsumer's Liability Risk\n\nSection II.B and Section II.C discuss the following liability risks for consumers:\n\nNegligence in maintaining the workplace. Consumers face a distinct risk of liability for on the job injuries to individual workers they employ unless those employees are covered by workers' compensation. The existence of workers' compensation coverage is a key protection for both workers who risk injury and for consumers who, without it, face significant liability risk. The case law demonstrates that a consumer may be found liable for negligence in maintaining the workplace -- that is, for creating or failing to correct hazardous conditions in the consumer's home. If the consumer lives with a family member or friend who is the owner or renter of the consumer's home, that family member or friend may also be liable on a theory of premises liability (Section II.B.1). It is true that the consumer could be liable for injury caused to any person invited into his or her home on these same legal grounds. However, the frequency and level of involvement of a personal assistance services worker in the home raise the risk to a substantially higher level, although no higher than is faced with agency-provided services.\n\nInjuries caused by the consumer's mental impairment. Cases in which consumers with mental impairments engage in negligent or aggressive behavior that causes injury to the worker are more complicated, because state law varies on whether the consumer's mental impairment will be recognized as a defense in an action for damages. The trend is to recognize the defense when asserted by a defendant who is confined to a residential facility, and there is case law suggesting that in at least some circumstances, this defense will also be accepted in the home care setting (Section II.B.2).\n\nWrongful discharge and other employment-related claims. As an employer, the consumer is potentially liable for a variety of employment related claims, such as discharge in violation of an employment agreement or employment actions that are discriminatorily motivated. However, this is a low frequency risk, and consumers can be protected from liability by a carefully worded employment agreement and by being made aware of any applicable state employment laws (Section II.B.3).\n\nLiability for injuries to third parties caused by the workers. Consumers may be liable as employers on the basis of vicarious liability (also referred to as respondeat superior) for injuries caused to third parties by their workers while acting within the scope of employment. For example, an auto accident caused by the worker while running an errand for the consumer could result in such liability (Section II.C).\n\nAuthorized Representative's Liability Risk\n\nSection II.D discusses the following liability risks for authorized representatives:\n\nLiability for negligence and for breach of fiduciary duty. In addition to potential liability for negligence (that is, failure to exercise ordinary care) in performing the duties of an authorized representative, an authorized representative may well have a heightened \"fiduciary duty\" to the consumer. However, in most cases authorized representatives are relatives or friends whose caregiving commitment is high, as is their level of care in performing their duties, thus significantly reducing the likelihood of negligence or breach of fiduciary duty (Section II.D).\n\nLiability for negligent hiring of a worker. The parent or other legally responsible person who is acting as the consumer's authorized representative may be liable for injuries or damage that results from a worker's failure to properly supervise or care for the consumer. However, case law on negligent hiring and parental liability strongly suggests that the authorized representative would be liable only if the representative: (1) knew or had reason to know that the consumer was likely to cause such damage or injuries; and (2) the authorized representative was negligent in hiring the personal assistant responsible for the supervision or care of the consumer (Section II.D).\n\nLiability as the employer of the worker. The authorized representative normally will be considered the joint employer, or the sole employer of the worker if the consumer has no ability to self direct his or her care, and therefore will have potential employment related liability (see Section II.B.3), including vicarious liability for torts committed by the worker that cause injury to third parties.\n\nLiability for abuse, neglect or exploitation of the consumer. In states that provide for a civil cause of action for abuse of a vulnerable adult, the representative may be liable to the consumer if the representative abuses, neglects or exploits the consumer. The representative could also be criminally liable. Again, this is a very low-incidence risk. Finally, the representative may be a mandatory reporter under the state APS law (Section II.D).\n\nFiscal Agent's Liability Risk\n\nBecause the role of the fiscal agent is limited (processing payroll records and issuing paychecks, and, in some cases, fiscal monitoring), the liability risks for fiscal agents are correspondingly quite limited. The report does not address the various contractual obligations to the state that the fiscal agent may incur. The report does analyze the following personal injury liability risks for fiscal agents in Section III:\n\nLiability to consumers for breach of contract. In some states, the fiscal agent (FA) enters into an agreement directly with the consumer, creating the possibility of a breach of contract action by the consumer if the FA fails to issue a paycheck to the worker and the consumer, as a result, loses the worker's services and suffers injury. However, the possible theories of liability are speculative and difficult to prove, and even if the plaintiff is nonetheless successful, the amount of damages a consumer or worker will be able to recover is likely to be insignificant (Section III.A).\n\nTort liability to consumers and workers for failure to pay worker. Negligence resulting in failure to pay the worker could also give rise to a tort action by the worker or the consumer against the FA. Here, too, there are serious legal obstacles to these claims, such as the difficulty of proving causation, and in any case, the amount of damages at stake is likely to be insignificant (Section III.B).\n\nLiability to consumers for negligent monitoring. A fiscal agent's negligence in monitoring a consumer's expenses and detecting problems could result in negative consequences for the consumer such as dis-enrollment from the CDPAS program, but here again there are serious legal obstacles to recovery, most notably the consumer's contributory negligence in deviating from the spending plan (Section III.C).\n\nLiability for failure to report abuse or neglect. A fiscal agent may be a mandatory reporter under the state's adult protective services (APS) law and may therefore be both civilly and criminally liable for failure to report abuse, neglect, or exploitation that comes to attention of the FA. Liability can easily be avoided by complying with any applicable APS reporting requirements (Section III.D).\n\nConsultant's Liability Risk\n\nIn the Cash and Counseling model of CDPAS, consultants, rather than the state, are assigned the most critical program functions -- assisting the consumer in designating an authorized representative and developing the spending plan and the back-up plan; providing consultation with regard to hiring, training and supervising workers; and monitoring program quality and initiating action to correct problems. While the fact that the consultant's functions are so critical certainly creates a significant risk of liability, this risk is mitigated by the fact the consumer explicitly bears primary responsibility for decisions regarding development of the spending plan and the back-up plan and selection and supervision of a worker, including hiring/firing, training, and scheduling. This separation of responsibility should protect the consultant from being deemed vicariously liable for injury to consumers caused by workers or by deficiencies in the spending plan or back-up plan. The way the program defines the functions of the consultant (or case worker by any other name) is critical to the liability risk analysis, for liability risk follows function.\n\nConsultants can effectively protect themselves against liability by: (1) being very clear in practice about staying within the bounds of consultation versus case management; (2) complying with program procedures and instructions carefully and executing all responsibilities conscientiously and with reasonable care; and (3) making it clear all times that it is the role of the consumer, not the consultant, to make decisions regarding the consumer's care.\n\nSection IV discusses the following liability risks for consultants:\n\nLiability for negligent designation of an authorized representative. To the extent that the consultant takes on responsibility for screening and/or approving an authorized representative, the consultant may be liable to the consumer for negligence in investigating, evaluating, or approving that selection, if the representative subsequently is negligent in performing his or her responsibilities or otherwise fails to act in the consumer's best interest (Section IV.A).\n\nLiability for negligent assistance in the development of the spending plan and back-up plan. If the consultant provides inadequate or incorrect advice, the consultant may be liable for negligent assistance in the development of the spending plan or back-up plan. In states that give consultants authority to approve the spending plan and/or the back-up plan, the consultant may be liable for negligent approval of a deficient plan (Section IV.B).\n\nLiability for negligent assistance in hiring, training and supervising workers. Similarly, if the consultant provides inadequate or incorrect advice regarding hiring, training or supervising workers, the consultant may be liable for negligence if the consumer who relies on that advice is subsequently injured (Section IV.C).\n\nLiability for negligent monitoring. A consultant may be liable if the consultant is negligent in monitoring program quality or fails to initiate action to correct problems identified in the course of monitoring, resulting in injury to the consumer (Section IV.D).\n\nLiability for failure to report abuse or neglect. A consultant may be a mandatory reporter under the state's adult protective services (APS) law and may therefore face civil and/or criminal liability for failure to report abuse or neglect that comes to attention of the consultant (Section IV.E).\n\nState's Liability Risk\n\nIn the Cash and Counseling model of CDPAS, the state's risk of liability for personal injury is greatly reduced. Most of the functions that were performed by the state or a provider agency in traditional Medicaid-funded home care services are now unbundled and performed by consumers (e.g., hiring and supervising workers), consultants (e.g., advising consumers and monitoring care), and fiscal agents (e.g., payroll services for workers). The core functions that continue to be performed by the state, such as enrolling consumers and responding to serious problems in connection with consumer care, carry some risk of liability, but if the state program is well structured and operated in accordance with that structure, this risk is minimal.\n\nSection V discusses the following liability risks for states:\n\nLiability for failure to obtain adequate consent. State programs that elect not to screen applicants to determine whether the applicant is an appropriate candidate for CDPAS risk liability if the state enrolls a consumer without first obtaining the consumer's voluntary agreement to participate in the program (Section V.A).\n\nLiability for failure to adopt adequate criteria and procedures for selection of an authorized representative for consumers who lack the capacity to designate a representative. The relatively informal criteria and procedures for selection of an authorized representative that are now in effect in the Cash and Counseling states create the risk that the state may be liable if a representative mismanages a consumer's care, particularly the care of a consumer who lacks the capacity to designate a representative (Section V.B).\n\nLiability for negligent response to a problem or complaint regarding consumer's care. The state may be liable if it fails to exercise ordinary care in responding to a problem or complaint regarding a consumer's care However, this liability risk is no different from that faced in agency-provided care (Section V.C).\n\nLiability as alleged employer of the individual worker. If the state is found to be the employer of the individual worker, the state will be vicariously liable for torts committed by that person while acting within the scope of employment and for workers' compensation if the worker is injured on the job. However, in the Cash and Counseling model, where the consumer, and not the state (or fiscal agent), controls the key employer functions (hiring/firing, assigning and scheduling tasks, training, and supervision), the risk of such liability is negligible (Section V.D).\n\nVicarious liability for consultant's or fiscal agent's negligence and other tortious conduct. Even though the state identifies an individual who provides consultant or fiscal agent services as an independent contractor, if the state exercises sufficient control over the independent contractor, the state can nevertheless be found to be the employer of that contractor and will be vicariously liable for the contractor's negligence and other tortious conduct. In the Cash and Counseling model, the state typically does not exercise such control (Section V.E).\n\nLiability based on nondelegable duty. The state will be liable if a tortious act is committed by the consultant or the fiscal agent while carrying out a \"nondelegable duty\" of the state. The concept of \"nondelegable duty\" has been used in those cases where a court concludes that as a matter of policy, the government should be responsible for the torts of independent contractors who are carrying out the work of or executing a responsibility of the government. However, courts vary in how they approach this issue, and the content of statutes or regulations setting forth the state's responsibilities in connection with CDPAS is likely to determine whether a nondelegable duty exists (Section V.E).\n\nLiability for failure to provide effective emergency back-up care. The Cash and Counseling Demonstration states required consumers to develop back-up strategies as part of the planning process, but if the state takes on a system-wide role in securing or providing emergency back-up, the state will take on significantly greater risk of liability for failure of back-up care, depending upon the level of responsibility and function assumed. For example, under the current federal Independence Plus Medicaid waiver templates for consumer-directed personal assistance programs, the state is required to \"assure\" emergency backup care for consumers. Undertaking a responsibility to \"assure\" emergency back-up brings with it a high level of liability risk if the state's emergency backup system fails and the consumer suffers injury as a result. (Section V.F).\n\nCDPAS programs can be structured in many ways, and it is beyond the scope of this report to identify and analyze the liability issues associated with each of the variations on CDPAS. However, Section VI of the report does address two well-established CDPAS programs, California's In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) Program and New York's Consumer-Directed Personal Assistance Program (CDPAP). There are several significantly different liability issues that may arise in the California IHSS program:\n\nThe liability risks for counties and state agencies involved in IHSS are small because they have been given broad statutory immunity. However, the state does assume the responsibility of covering all workers with workers' compensation protection (Section VI.A.2).\n\nThe public authorities in each county act as the employer of IHSS workers for purposes of collective bargaining, but the public authorities have been granted statutory immunity which shields them from vicarious liability arising out of the consumer-worker relationship (Section VI.A.3).\n\nThe public authorities also perform certain other designated functions, such as: screening and referral of workers through employment registries; providing training; providing emergency back-up support; and monitoring services. The immunity provision for public authorities, unlike that for the state and counties, does not extend to functions such as these that a public authority carries out directly. Therefore, liability risk follows and is proportional to the breadth and depth of the specific function undertaken by the public authority (Section VI.A.3).\n\nThe New York CDPAP program is structured around a provider agency, Concepts of Independence, Inc., that serves as the employer of record of the workers for purposes of employee payroll and benefits functions and for purposes of entering into a Medicaid provider agreement with the state. At the same time, the consumer retains responsibility for directing his or her care and services to substantially the same extent as is done in the Cash and Counseling model. Accordingly, the liability issues are substantially similar in the two models, except that all workers are mandatorily covered by workers' compensation through Concepts, the provider agency.\n\nSection VII, Conclusions and Options to Address Liability Risk, reiterates the conclusions reached in Sections II through VI. This section also sets forth an array of steps CDPAS program administrators may want to consider to address the liability risks for each actor in consumer-directed care. The steps include:\n\nOptions to Address the Worker's Liability Risks\n\nFully inform the worker of the liability risks and document the process.\n\nRequire workers' compensation coverage for all workers.\n\nMake available optional training programs for workers.\n\nOptions to Address the Consumer's Liability Risks\n\nFully inform the consumer of the liability risks.\n\nInform the consumer of the possible need for liability insurance if the consumer has assets at risk.\n\nDocument that the consumer has received this information and agrees to these risks.\n\nProvide workers' compensation for all individual workers.\n\nOffer worker background checks to consumers.\n\nAdvise the consumer to enter into a written employment agreement with the worker that allows termination of employment at will.\n\nProvide information and training regarding employment laws that apply to the consumer.\n\nOptions to Address the Authorized Representative's Liability Risks\n\nFully inform the authorized representative of the liability risks.\n\nGet written documentation that the authorized representative has been informed of and agrees to these risks.\n\nFollow the same options as for consumers, as appropriate.\n\nOptions to Address the Fiscal Agent's Liability Risks\n\nImplement a quality management plan.\n\nUtilize liability insurance.\n\nSeek assurance from the state regarding the adequacy of back-up plans.\n\nCheck applicability of the state APS law.\n\nOptions to Address the Consultant's Liability Risks\n\nImplement a quality management plan.\n\nUtilize liability insurance.\n\nClearly communicate and document the consultant's role.\n\nEnsure that important decisions are made by the consumer.\n\nAdopt clear and explicit criteria for the approval of spending plans and back-up plans.\n\nCheck applicability of state APS law.\n\nOptions to Address the State's Liability Risks\n\nInstitute procedures to obtain the consumer's informed and voluntary agreement to participate in the program.\n\nConsider adopting more formal criteria and procedures for the designation of an authorized representative.\n\nAdopt a quality management plan in connection with consultant monitoring and the state's response to problems that are reported by consultants.\n\nAvoid vicarious liability as the employer of workers by following the Cash and Counseling model.\n\nMinimize the risk of vicarious liability for the torts of consultants and fiscal agents by avoiding indicia of an employment relationship.\n\nTake care to avoid assumption of additional potential liability risks when drafting regulations, rules and protocols relating to CDPAS.\n\nNegotiate an indemnity clause in contracts with consultants and fiscal agents.\n\nEnact legislation limiting liability in connection with CDPAS.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nGovernment-sponsored programs offering consumer direction and consumer choice in personal assistance services3 are not a new or unusual concept. The largest state program, the California In-Home Supportive Services Program, which \"accounts for slightly over half of all the estimated participants in consumer-directed programs nationwide,\"4 has been in existence for almost 30 years.5 As of 2002, \"One hundred thirty-nine (139) programs offering consumer-directed home and community-based (HCB) support services were identified nation-wide,\"6 and these programs served an estimated 468,000 individuals.7 However, three factors are likely to result in a dramatic increase in consumer-directed services in the next few years, an increase that warrants a closer look at the legal issues related to such services, including the subject of this report, liability issues related to consumer direction. These factors are:\n\nThe Cash and Counseling Demonstration, jointly sponsored and funded by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which represents the largest and most sophisticated research effort to date designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and economic feasibility of consumer-directed care. The program, which is described in greater detail in Section I.A, randomly assigned Medicaid recipients in three states, Arkansas, Florida, and New Jersey, who were eligible for home care and interested in managing their own supports and services, to two groups: an \"experimental\" group, which received consumer-directed personal assistance services; and a \"control\" group, which received traditional agency care. Although the analysis of the data collected in the Cash and Counseling Demonstration is ongoing, initial reports support the conclusion that consumer-directed personal assistance services significantly increase consumer satisfaction without compromising consumer health or safety.8\n\nThe Independence Plus initiative of DHHS' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\"), which is intended to expedite \"the ability of states to offer families with a member who requires long-term supports and services, or individuals who require long-term supports and services, greater opportunities to take charge of their own health and direct their own services.\"9 The key component of this initiative is the issuance of two Medicaid waiver \"templates,\" a Section 1115 waiver template for demonstration projects and a Section 1915(c) waiver template for home and community-based services, both of which are intended to encourage the states to develop additional consumer-directed personal assistance services (CDPAS) programs.10 In general, the waiver templates follow the model of the Cash and Counseling Demonstration in its specifications regarding the structure and components of CDPAS programs that will be approved under the waivers.\n\nIncreased consumer demand for such services among both younger and older persons with disabilities. Younger persons with disabilities were the original proponents of consumer-directed personal assistance services as part of the \"independent living\" movement.11 But older consumers have caught on too. As recently reported by the AARP, \"Persons 50 and older with disabilities, particularly those age 50-64, strongly prefer independent living in their own homes to other alternatives. They also want more direct control over what long-term supportive services they receive and when they receive them.\"12 In June of 2001, the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) joined other federal and private sponsors to host \"Independent Choices: A National Symposium on Consumer-Direction and Self-Determination for the Elderly and Persons with Disabilities\" in Washington, D.C. One of the key themes articulated in that conference was that consumer-directed services are desirable and appropriate not only for younger adults with physical disabilities but also for the elderly, for individuals with cognitive impairments such as mental retardation or dementia, or for people with severe and persistent mental illness.13\n\nAs CMS encourages additional experiments with CDPAS, a primary concern is the quality and safety of such programs and the related issue of their effect on liability for personal injuries.14 In Arkansas, the first of the Cash and Counseling states for which an analysis of the quality and safety of the program has been completed, research data demonstrated that CDPAS increased consumer satisfaction \"without discernibly compromising consumer health, functioning or self-care.\"15 A recent study of consumer-directed care in Washington state similarly concluded that \"[t]here was no evidence of problems of quality of care or consumer safety attributable to self-directed care.\"16\n\nAnother concern has been possible fraud and abuse. In a 1999 survey by the National Council on Aging, \"[t]he most pressing ethical and legal issues cited by the [state] administrators were abuse or exploitation of the consumer... and the potential for fraud or misuse of funds.\"17 Here, again, the experience in the Cash and Counseling Demonstration has been that the implementation of CDPAS has not resulted in an increase in fraud or abuse. In New Jersey, the Cash and Counseling evaluators noted that \"representatives of the personal care industry, consultants, fiscal agent staff, [and] state [program] staff\" all reported having seen no \"evidence of material abuse of the cash allowance.\"18 Similarly, in Arkansas:\n\nTo date... there has been no material abuse of the cash benefit.... Nor has substantial exploitation of consumers been detected under IndependentChoices. While traditional providers raised concerns about the safety and well-being of a few cash recipients, state investigations in every case concluded that these concerns were unfounded.19\n\nThe fact that in the aggregate, there has not been an adverse effect on the quality of care or an increase in fraud and abuse is certainly reassuring in terms of liability. However, this does not mean that there will not be individual cases in which workers, consumers, authorized representatives, consultants, fiscal agents, and state agencies are negligent or make mistakes, causing injury to others and the potential for liability. The purpose of this report is therefore twofold: first, focusing primarily on the Cash and Counseling model, to identify the circumstances in which such conduct could result in liability and what persons or entities are likely to be liable; and second, to identify steps that can be taken to reduce exposure to such liability.\n\nA. The Cash and Counseling Demonstration\n\nThe Cash and Counseling Demonstration, which is designed to evaluate scientifically the safety, efficacy and economic feasibility of consumer-directed care, also represents an effort to develop a model structure for the delivery of consumer-directed personal assistance services. The distinguishing feature of this structure is that key supportive services are provided to the consumer without compromising the consumer's ultimate decision-making authority:\n\nPerhaps the fundamental tenet of the Cash and Counseling model -- the tenet that distinguishes it from other models of consumer direction -- is the provision of counseling and fiscal services to help consumers manage their cash benefit. Some critics of the Cash and Counseling model argue that an unfettered cash allowance would be preferable, on the grounds that such an allowance is more consistent with the philosophy of consumer direction than a program that imposes restrictions on, and monitors, the uses of the cash benefit. States, however, must balance this argument with the concern that state Medicaid funds might be misused, which could jeopardize political support for the program.20\n\nWith some variation from state to state, the following elements are typical of the programs in Arkansas, Florida and New Jersey during implementation phases of approximately 18 months that began in December 1998 for Arkansas, November 1999 for New Jersey, and June 2000 for Florida:21\n\nAll participants are Medicaid recipients who have been determined to be eligible for specific numbers of hours of home care services based on their level of need or claims history. The consumer's eligibility level for traditional Medicaid long term care benefits is converted into a cash benefit amount or \"allowance\" using a formula which is designed to ensure that the ultimate cost of CDPAS is approximately equal to the cost of agency care (for example, the formula may take into account a state's experience that in traditional agency care, the amount of service hours approved are typically not fully utilized).\n\nIn the experimental phase of the Cash and Counseling demonstration, participants who expressed an interest in consumer-directed personal assistance services were randomly assigned to either the \"control\" group, which received traditional agency care, or the \"experimental\" group, which received CDPAS. Outside the experimental context, the goal would be to give Medicaid participants a choice of receiving traditional agency care or CDPAS.\n\nConsumers who elect CDPAS are assigned to consultants22 who help the consumer with several essential components of the program. Consultants are private agencies or individuals with whom the state has contracted to provide supportive services to consumers.\n\nThe consultant first helps the consumer convert the cash allowance into a spending plan. Most of the consumer's allowance typically is used to pay wages to CDPAS workers, but consumers have the discretion to spend part of their allowance on a variety of goods and services that enable them to function more independently, such as equipment (e.g., a micro-wave oven to heat pre-cooked meals) and home modifications (e.g., installation of grab bars in the bathroom).23 Within the constraints of their allowance, consumers also have discretion in setting the pay rate and scheduling the hours worked by personal assistants. An essential tenet of consumer-directed care is that the consumer is the expert on the consumer's needs, so the consultant's role in this aspect of the program is necessarily limited to advising the consumer regarding options for structuring the spending plan. Nevertheless, some approval process of the plan is in place in all three states, usually at the level of the state agency overseeing the program.\n\nThe consultant is also responsible for advising the consumer about hiring, training and supervising care workers. Here, too, the consultant's role is to provide training and advice, with the consumer retaining ultimate control and decision-making authority. The consultant also helps the consumer develop an emergency back-up plan to cover situations when a regular worker is not available or fails to show up for work.\n\nIf the consumer is unable to or does not wish to assume the responsibility of directing his or her own care, the consumer has the option of designating an authorized representative (typically a family member or close friend) to assume this role.\n\nIn addition to receiving these supportive services from consultants, the state also contracts with one or more fiscal intermediary agencies that are available to perform employer bookkeeping functions for the consumer. In this report, these agencies are referred to as the fiscal agent because this is the term used in the Cash and Counseling Demonstration.24 The consumer may elect to have the fiscal agent calculate all legally required payroll deductions, based on time sheets prepared and submitted by the consumer, and to forward these payments to the appropriate state and federal agencies. The fiscal agent can also prepare and issue paychecks to workers. Almost all consumers elect to use the service of the fiscal agent rather than assume bookkeeping responsibilities themselves.\n\nOnce the spending plan has been completed and the workers hired, consultants maintain regular contact with the consumer, and consultants and/or fiscal agents periodically review consumer records to check for errors or overspending. This ongoing monitoring is intended both as continuing support, helping to ensure that small problems do not become big problems, and as a form of quality management, that is, as a way to ensure that the consumer receives adequate care and that funds are appropriately spent.\n\nThe participants and their roles in the Cash and Counseling model are illustrated in Figure 1 below. The diagram structure shows a primary employer-employee relationship between the consumer (or the consumer's representative) and an independent worker who provides of personal assistance services. The consumer's responsibilities are listed to the right of the consumer figure. In addition to this primary employment relationship, there are other participants who fulfill designated employer and related functions: the counselor or consultant, the fiscal agent, and the state agency responsible for the Cash and Counseling program. They are listed in order of their level of direct involvement with the consumer. Their specific duties are summarized to the right of each figure. Because they also have some actual or potential interaction with the independent worker, albeit limited, their relationship to the independent provider is illustrated by a dotted line.\n\nFIGURE 1. Parties Involved in Cash and Counseling\n\nB. The Scope of this Report\n\nThis report focuses primarily on liability issues that are likely to arise in a CDPAS program modeled on the structure of the Cash and Counseling Demonstration. One section will consider how these issues might differ under other CDPAS models, such as the California In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) program and New York's Consumer Directed Personal Assistance Program (CDPAP).\n\nIn deciding which of a multitude of possible legal claims merited discussion, we used the following criteria. First, we do not discuss issues that are common to Medicaid programs in general (e.g., Medicaid fraud). We also do not discuss possible federal law claims that are not unique to CDPAS, such as claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act25 or the Supreme Court's Olmstead decision.26 Finally, we have assumed that the various actors in the Cash and Counseling structure (i.e., consumers, workers, authorized representatives, fiscal agents, consultants and state agencies) for the most part will act in good faith and will not intentionally do a poor job or engage in fraud.27 In cases of fraudulent conduct, it is obvious that some liability, perhaps including criminal liability, is likely to result.\n\nInstead, we have focused on claims that may arise when despite good faith -- and the state's considerable efforts at monitoring and quality management -- fallible people make mistakes that result in injury to others. These claims are primarily state law tort claims, particularly claims for negligence that may arise when a worker, consumer, authorized representative, fiscal agent, consultant or state agency fails to act with ordinary care and causes injury. We also touch on several situations in which intentional tort or contract law claims might be asserted and in which potential liability under state adult protective services statutes may arise.\n\nIt is important to note that the liability issues we discuss are governed virtually exclusively by state law, and, thus, the law applicable to the claim may vary considerably from state to state. It can be difficult to do more than generalize about the likelihood of liability in a particular situation because much may depend on the law in a particular state. Our ability to assess the likelihood of liability is also hindered by the dearth of reported decisions28 dealing with consumer-directed care.29 With respect to many liability issues, we have been able to obtain guidance from decisions involving home care agencies or privately-employed personal assistants, even though there are virtually no directly applicable decisions involving government funded CDPAS programs. With respect to other issues, and especially where we have not been able to identify an analogous situation, our analysis is necessarily more speculative.\n\nThe following four sections of this report discuss the liability risks associated with each aspect of consumer-directed care programs modeled on the Cash and Counseling Demonstration: Section II, Potential Liability Arising from the Relationship Between Consumers and Workers; Section III, Liability Risk of Fiscal Agents; Section IV, Liability Risk of Consultants; and Section V, Liability Risk for States and Other Governmental Entities. Section VI discusses how these issues are affected by other models of CDPAS, such as the California In-Home Supportive Services program and New York's Consumer-Directed Personal Assistance Program. The conclusions we reach in each of these sections are detailed in the final section, Section VII, which also sets forth a variety of steps that can be taken to reduce potential liability. As explained in Section VII, the overall effect on liability of CDPAS is mixed.\n\nC. Methodology\n\nThe methodology for this analysis involved review of all available program materials and operational procedures, relevant law and regulations, available literature and reports on the state programs, and telephone interviews with several key contacts from the three Cash and Counseling programs.\n\nD. Possible Legal Bases for Claims of Liability in Connection with CDPAS\n\nBefore discussing the specific liability issues that arise in the context of consumer directed personal assistance services, it is helpful to summarize the legal framework within which these issues may arise. The possible legal bases for claims of liability fall into three categories: (1) tort claims, which are claims that the defendant engaged in \"conduct that amounts to a legal wrong and that causes harm for which courts will impose civil liability;\"30 (2) contract claims, which are claims that the defendant breached an agreement between the parties; and (3) claims for violation of a right created by statute, such as failure to make a report of abuse as required by a state adult protective services law. The rights and liabilities governed by tort law and by contract law are private. They can be enforced only through the civil justice system and will result in liability only if the potential plaintiff decides to initiate and pursue legal remedies. In contrast, rights and liabilities created by statute may be subject to enforcement by the state or federal government, by private enforcement, or by both, and enforcement by the government may be through a civil action, a criminal action, or both.\n\nMost of the potential claims discussed in this article are tort claims. Torts range from intentional interference with one's person (such as assault, battery, and false imprisonment) to the more familiar types of torts involving negligence and malpractice, and injuries to intangible interests, such as those involving good reputation, privacy, or emotional distress. However, the claims that are most likely to be asserted in the context of CDPAS are negligence claims. The essential elements of a negligence claim are:\n\nThe defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of care (for instance, not to engage in unreasonably risky conduct);\n\nthe defendant breached that duty by his/her conduct;\n\nthe defendant's conduct is a \"proximate cause\" of the plaintiff's harm, meaning that the defendant's conduct not only caused the harm in fact, but it is perceived to have a significant causal relationship to the harm suffered by the defendant; and\n\nthe plaintiff must have sustained actual injury or harm as a result of the defendant's conduct.31\n\nHome care services can give rise to two kinds of negligence claims: claims for ordinary negligence, in which the legal standard is whether the defendant used \"ordinary care,\" defined as \"the care of a reasonable and prudent person;\"32 and medical malpractice, in which the legal standard is \"whether the defendant's conduct conformed to the medical standard or medical custom in the relevant community.\"33 As we discuss in Section II.A, cases involving home health care agencies and privately employed individuals make it clear that the first standard applies to both professionals and non-professionals, such as CDPAS workers, who assist with homemaking chores and activities of daily living, and that the second standard applies only to medical professionals providing medical services.\n\nAssuming the plaintiff can establish a prima facie case (i.e., initially establish each of the elements of negligence), the defendant may be able to defeat the claim by asserting one of a number of defenses. The defenses that are most likely to be asserted in the context of consumer-directed care are:\n\nContributory or comparative negligence, including assumption of risk. Under the traditional common law rule, any contributory negligence by the plaintiff constituted a complete bar to a claim of negligence.34 However, most states now apply comparative fault, \"reducing the plaintiff's recovery in proportion to the plaintiff's fault.\"35 Similarly, the defense of assumption of risk, which also barred recovery under traditional common law, has in most states now been either abolished or merged with the concept of contributory negligence.36 \"Assumption of risk\" is not easily defined (traditionally, \"assumed risk always seemed to be a way of talking about some other established legal doctrine\"37), but in the context of comparative negligence, it refers to risk-assuming conduct on the part of the plaintiff that falls short of consent to accept all risks generated by the defendant (in which case the defendant would not have a duty of care to the plaintiff, a situation which is now sometimes referred to as \"primary assumption of risk\").38\n\nWorkers' compensation.39 In all states, the traditional rules regarding employer liability for on the job injuries have, for the most part, been replaced by workers' compensation, a no fault system of insurance.40 This means that the worker receives compensation for work-related injuries, regardless of the employer's fault or the worker's own contributory negligence or assumption of risk.41 However, under workers' compensation, the employer's liability is limited and the worker may be paid less compensation than the worker might have received as damages in a tort action (for example, \"in the case of an employee's total disablement, two-thirds of her average wage for a limited period of years plus medical expenses, but notably not for pain and suffering\").42 It is important to note that the exclusive remedy provision of workers' compensation usually does not apply where injury is caused by a third party.43 Thus, if a worker has a car accident while doing an errand for the consumer, and the other driver is at fault, workers' compensation would not bar the worker's claim against the driver. Similarly, where a consumer is living in his or her daughter's home, and the worker is injured in a \"slip and fall\" incident, due to negligent maintenance of the home, the worker may be able to bring a claim against the daughter, even though the worker is covered by workers' compensation.\n\nSpousal and parental immunity. Spouses, parents or children of consumers often act as authorized representatives, and in some states, spouses, parents or children may be permitted to act as workers. As we discuss in the introduction to Section II, most of the common law rules regarding parental and spousal immunity have in large part been overruled. Yet, in some states and in some circumstances, these common law rules may still bar recovery in a dispute between consumers and workers, consumers and authorized representatives, or workers and authorized representatives.\n\nGovernmental immunity. In the introduction to Section V (Liability Risk for States and Other Government Entities), we describe the rules regarding governmental immunity that might under some circumstances bar a claim against a state agency, other governmental entity, or government official.\n\nConsent. In Section V.A (Failure to Obtain the Consumer's Clear Agreement to Participate in CDPAS), we discuss the importance of the consumer's choice in the decision of whether or not to participate in consumer-directed personal assistance services.\n\nThe concepts above are most easily applied in circumstances in which one person's negligence is alleged to have caused another person's injury. However, tort cases often involve more complicated actions and relationships, such as actions by an organization or corporate entity, and relationships in which an employee may be acting on behalf of an employer when an injury occurs. Because of this, different conceptual bases of negligence have evolved over time to define the duties and liabilities arising from different relationships:\n\nPersonal liability. This is the simplest form of liability, holding one person responsible for his or her negligent or intentional acts that result in harm to another.44\n\nDirect corporate liability. Under this theory, an institution may be held directly liable for acts, or failures to act in matters that are directly within its control. For example, a hospital may not be directly responsible for a doctor's performance in the operating room, but it may be directly responsible for its failure to exercise reasonable care in selecting its staff members and granting clinical privileges. Similarly, an agency doing background checks of individuals seeking to be personal assistance services workers in a consumer-directed program may not be directly responsible for injury caused by that worker, but it may be directly responsible for its failure to exercise reasonable care in performing the background check, which if done correctly would have revealed the worker to be dangerously irresponsible.45\n\nVicarious liability. This theory of liability holds a principal strictly responsible for the acts or omissions of his or her agent, based upon the common law doctrine of respondeat superior, this doctrine literally meaning \"let the master answer.\" It requires the existence of an employment relationship (or in legal parlance, a \"master-servant\" or \"agency\" relationship). If an injury is caused by the negligent or intentional wrongdoing of an employee who is acting within the scope of his or her employment, then the employer is liable for such conduct under this doctrine.46\n\nThe application of vicarious liability to CDPAS has been a persistent worry of states undertaking such programs, because it poses the dilemma of control.47 The greater the control exercised by the state or any other entity over the conduct of personal attendants, the more likely it will be deemed the de facto employer of the worker and thus strictly liable for the negligent conduct of that worker. The less control exercised by the state or other entity, the greater are its perceived worries over accountability and quality of care.\n\nLegally, the label of \"employer\" represents a conclusion that some entity exercises such power and control over the conduct of some person that it should bear the burden of responsibility for certain obligations established by law (e.g., social security, unemployment compensation, workers' compensation) or for injuries negligently caused by that person, whom we will label the \"employee.\"48 Whether the label can or must be applied varies under different statutes and different contexts. Thus, one must constantly ask: \"Employer for what purpose?\" Indeed, a key characteristic of the Cash and Counseling Demonstration and other CDPAS programs is that they, in effect, unbundle the notion of employer into specific responsibilities that are relevant to personal assistance services and then apportion and assign these responsibilities among the parties involved in the particular CDPAS program. Thus, for example, for purposes of employee withholding and benefits, one entity may be the employer of record, but for purposes of accountability for injury caused by the negligence of a worker, the same entity may not be deemed the employer. The \"employer\" for purposes of the latter circumstance may also be called the \"common law\" employer.\n\nAs a starting point, all the CDPAS programs view the consumer as having direct and primary control over the work of the personal assistant, and thus, the consumer deserves the label of THE employer, or common law employer, primary employer, or managing employer.49 But unlike simple employment situations involving two parties -- employer and employee -- publicly funded CDPAS programs typically involve three or four parties or more: the consumer, the individual worker, the payer or regulator of the program, an intermediary fiscal agent that handles payroll, and other entities such as consultants (in Cash and Counseling) or public authorities (in California) or consumer-directed provider agencies (in New York). Conventional tort law is not well adapted to such service configurations, so the apportioning of responsibility among the participants has presented a challenge to these novel programs to be as clear and cogent as possible about who is responsible for what.\n\nII. POTENTIAL LIABILITY ARISING FROM THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CONSUMERS AND WORKERS\n\nBoth the case law involving home health care agencies and common sense suggest that the relationship between consumers and CDPAS workers can give rise to a variety of legal claims. The most likely are personal injury claims based on the alleged negligence of either party. Workers may injure consumers both through negligence in the way they provide personal assistance services (for example, bathing the consumer in scalding water) and by negligently creating hazards in the consumer's home (for example, creating a fire hazard by leaving magazines piled near a heater).50 These are discussed in Section II.A.1 and Section II.A.2 below. Similarly, consumers may be negligent in creating or failing to correct dangerous conditions in their homes that cause injury to the worker. The most common such cases are \"slip and fall\" cases -- cases where a condition at the defendant's home causes the plaintiff to slip and fall and suffer injury. Section II.B.1 examines these scenarios.\n\nThird parties may also assert personal injury claims against consumers and workers (Section II.C). A third party who is injured by the worker while the worker is engaged in personal assistance services -- for example, a third party whose car is hit by the worker's car while the worker is on the way to the grocery store for the consumer -- may assert a claim both against the worker for direct liability and against the consumer for vicarious liability as an employer. In the same example, if the third party is at fault, and the worker is injured in the car accident, the worker may seek compensation from the third party, and where the worker has workers' compensation, it too would cover the injury. Finally, a third party who is injured by a physically or mentally disabled consumer may allege that the worker had a duty to supervise the consumer and that the worker's negligence in performing this duty caused the injury. Third-party permutations are discussed in Section II.C below.\n\nAlthough personal injury claims based on alleged negligence are the most likely, the relationship between consumer and worker can also give rise to several other kinds of claims. Section II.A.3.b touches upon the possibility that extreme neglect or clearly substandard care by workers could result in civil or criminal liability for abuse under state adult protective services (\"APS\") statutes. Independent workers may also be \"mandatory reporters\" under the APS law, thus exposing them to civil or criminal penalties if they fail to report suspected abuse they observe during the course of their work (Section II.A.3.a). Friction in the employment relationship itself may result in claims by workers against consumers -- described in Section II.B.3 for wrongful discharge and a variety of other employment related claims.\n\nFinally, in Section II.D, we discuss the potential liability of authorized representatives for negligence in performing their duties, including the likelihood that a court would find that the authorized representative owed a fiduciary duty to the consumer.\n\nThe use of family members as workers raises another issue in claims between consumers, workers and authorized representatives -- that of tort immunity rules that may apply in legal actions between family members. Spouses, parents and children frequently serve as representatives, and the Section 1115 demonstration program waiver for the Cash and Counseling program allows legally responsible relatives to serve as workers, which is normally prohibited under Medicaid rules.51 New Jersey elected to permit spouses to act as workers,52 and Florida permits all legally responsible relatives to act as workers.53 The common law rules regarding parental and spousal immunity have in large part been overruled by case law or by statute, but in some states and in some limited circumstances, these rules might bar recovery in a dispute related to consumer-directed personal assistance services.54\n\nAs in many endeavors, personal assistance services involve the possibility of inadequate performance, injury, or even abuse -- not only to the consumer, but also to workers or third parties. In this section we discuss in detail the nature and level of risk of liability to both consumers and workers under the consumer-directed model.\n\nA. Worker Liability Risk\n\n1. Negligent Caregiving\n\nAlthough there are no reported decisions in negligence suits between consumers and workers arising from consumer-directed personal assistance services, the substantial number of reported cases involving alleged negligence by employees of home health care agencies provides useful information regarding both the kinds of injuries that are likely to occur in the context of CDPAS and the legal theories of liability that are available to consumers who seek compensation.55\n\nMalpractice versus Ordinary Negligence\n\nA threshold question in these cases is whether claims against personal assistance workers must be based on a breach of professional standards (which requires testimony by expert witnesses) or merely ordinary negligence (which can be determined by a jury without such testimony). The case law consistently supports the latter view:\n\nCase 1: Ordinary negligence. In Headley v. Maxim Healthcare Services, Inc., the plaintiff claimed that she was injured when the legs of a Hoyer lift gave way while a nursing assistant was transporting her to the shower, and that the nursing assistant's improper and negligent placement of the legs of the lift caused the accident.56 The defendant home health care agency moved for summary judgment, arguing that the plaintiff's claim was one for medical malpractice, rather than ordinary negligence, and that it was therefore barred by the one year statute of limitations applicable to such claims.57 The trial court denied the motion because the nursing assistant was not in one of the designated professions for a medical claim and because the fall occurred while the plaintiff was being transported to the shower, not while she was receiving medical care.58\n\nCase 2: Ordinary negligence. Williams v. Metro Home Health Care Agency also illustrates the judicial acceptance of ordinary negligence as the proper analysis, even though the care provider in that case was a nurse.59 In Williams, the plaintiff alleged that, although an agency nurse was scheduled to see him three days a week to educate and assist him in caring for his decubitis ulcers, the nurse actually visited him only once a week. The plaintiff claimed that as a result of the nurse's negligent care, he developed an ulcer that required surgical treatment.60 The defendants moved for summary judgment based on the plaintiff's failure to name an expert witness to establish the standard of care, and the trial court denied the motion.61 On appeal, the appellate court upheld the trial court because expert testimony was not necessary to establish negligence: \"Expert testimony is not mandated where the physician or caretaker does an obviously careless act from which a lay person can infer negligence.\"62\n\nThus, the nature of the claim is determined, not by whether the actor is a health professional, but by the nature of the task in issue.63\n\nLeaving the Consumer Unattended\n\nThe most common negligent care-giving scenarios involve some variation on leaving the consumer unattended. This may involve anything from failing to show up at the scheduled time or leaving early, to momentary lapses of monitoring that resulted in injury to the consumer. The liability risk in failing to show up for work is illustrated by the following cases:\n\nWeekend no-show for fractured hip. In Rosenthal v. Bologna,64 the client had contracted with the defendant home health care agency to provide services seven days a week while he recovered from a fractured hip, but his home care attendant did not appear at work the first weekend because he mistakenly believed his services were required only five days a week. Over the weekend the client attempted to move on his own from his wheelchair to his walker and refractured his hip.65 The agency argued that the plaintiff's negligence claim was barred by a waiver provision in the contract between the agency and the client, but the appellate court refused to enforce the waiver, holding that the purported waiver violated public policy: \"This aspect of the contract warrants judicial rejection here because of the state's interest in the health and welfare of its citizens and also because of the highly dependent (and thus unequal) relationship between patient and health care provider.\"66\n\nEmergency arising while unattended. In Walker v. EHCCI, a multiple sclerosis patient did not receive timely emergency care because she had been left unattended by her home care worker.67 The defendants argued \"that their only obligations to plaintiff were 'cooking, cleaning and other household tasks.'\"68 However, in affirming the trial court's denial of the defendants' motion for summary judgment, the appellate court noted that the home care worker had been instructed regarding the patient's medical condition and the circumstances under which she might need emergency care.69 Based on this evidence, the court found that \"[c]learly, defendants owed a duty of care to plaintiff beyond contractual obligations to cook and clean.\"70\n\nThese two cases point to the same conclusion: the \"state's interest in the health and welfare of its citizens\"71 argues in favor of a duty of care which encompasses not just the duty of ordinary care in the performance of specified personal assistance services, but also the duty to exercise ordinary care to protect the consumer in any situation that threatens the consumer's health or safety. Rosenthal reflects a perspective on the duty of personal attendants that is very significant in assessing risk -- namely, that courts are likely to see the duty of attendants as much broader than merely performing a list of specified personal assistance services. Rather, it may also include a duty to exercise ordinary care to provide protective oversight in many situations that threaten the consumer's health or safety. Leaving the consumer alone risks violating that duty. The Walker case similarly suggests that an attendant's duty includes ordinary care in responding to medical emergencies -- that is, responding in a common sense fashion based on the worker's knowledge of the consumer's medical condition -- and, perhaps, ordinary care in dealing with a variety of unanticipated situations which are incidental to the provision of personal assistance services.\n\nTwo cases illustrate the dangers of leaving a consumer unattended by virtue of leaving work early. In both cases, home health care agencies were sued for injuries sustained when a fire broke out during a worker's scheduled work hours, but the worker was not present to protect or rescue the client because the worker had left work early.\n\nEarly departure fire 1. In Willis v. City of New York, the agency moved for summary judgment, arguing that it did not owe a duty to rescue, that the plaintiff's injuries were not foreseeable, and that the aide's early departure was not a proximate cause of the injury.72 The trial court's denial of the agency's motion was sustained by the appellate court, which held that \"[w]here a defendant is responsible for caring for an individual, the defendant's abandonment of that individual can result in liability.\"73\n\nEarly departure fire 2. In Villarin v. Onabango, both the client, who was severely disabled and bedridden, and his daughter, who was trying to rescue him, died in a house fire. Surviving family members filed suit to recover for personal injuries (apparently sustained by the surviving family members themselves) and for wrongful death, claiming that the agency's employee had breached his duty when he left the house an hour before the end of his scheduled shift.74 The trial court granted the agency's motion to dismiss, but the appellate court reversed, citing Willis.75\n\nFinally, Esposito v. Personal Touch Home Care demonstrates the risk of momentary lapses by an attendant in which a consumer is left unattended.76\n\nUnattended in the bathroom. In Esposito, the plaintiff sustained injuries when he fell in the entrance to his bathroom while under the care of his home health aide.77 The plaintiff, a multiple sclerosis patient who used a walker and a wheelchair, argued that the aide was negligent in leaving him in the bathroom unattended.78 As in Willis, the appellate court ruled that \"[w]here a defendant is responsible for caring for an individual, the defendant's abandonment of that individual can result in liability,\" and reversed the trial court's decision granting summary judgment to the defendant.79\n\nWhile this decision and others sometimes use the term \"abandonment\" to describe the defendant's conduct, the phrase is used in its common meaning suggesting negligence and is not equivalent to the tort of abandonment, which has been recognized by some courts as a separate cause of action.80\n\nNegligent Administration of Care\n\nAll the above examples involve failure to be there, that is, sins of omission. At the opposite end of the spectrum are cases that involve errors in administration of care. For example, several cases have been brought against home health care agencies by clients who were severely injured when their personal care workers bathed or showered them in scalding water, a type of injury that certainly could occur in the context of consumer-directed personal assistance services. In these cases, and in many other cases involving alleged negligence in the provision of home care services, both the existence of a duty to the plaintiff and causation were not seriously contested. Instead, pretrial motions and post-trial appeals typically focused on issues of whether the defendant was negligent or even reckless in caring for the plaintiff:\n\nShower scalding. In Lee v. Health Force, Inc., a mentally retarded and physically handicapped child who was severely burned while being given a shower by a personal care aide filed a negligence action against the aide and the agency which employed her.81 After filing suit, the plaintiff moved to amend the complaint to add a claim for punitive damages based, inter alia, on the aide's allegedly reckless care.82 The trial court's decision granting this motion was reversed by the appellate court, which noted that the aide had given prompt and appropriate first aid when the shower water unexpectedly became very hot.83\n\nHome care agencies have also been sued for alleged negligence in helping a patient perform other tasks:\n\nElevator slip. For example, in Calick v. Double A Property Associates, the client was injured when she slipped on a puddle in an elevator while being assisted by her home care attendant.84 The attendant argued that she was not negligent because she looked into the elevator, as was her practice, and saw no puddle.85 The trial court agreed and granted the defendant's motion to set aside the jury's verdict for the plaintiff, but the appellate court reversed, holding that \"the reasonableness of the attendant's actions and her failure to see what was on the floor of the elevator was a factual question for the jury\" to determine.86\n\nVirtually any task can be negligently performed, but the reported case law provides only occasional examples that reach appellate review. Again, the import of these cases is that they are judged by standards of ordinary negligence and not by a professional standard of care. This fact may be viewed as both a plus and a minus for personal care attendants -- a plus because attendants are held to a duty of only ordinary care, and not to a higher duty by virtue of their chosen work. Simultaneously, this is a minus, because allegations of negligence can be sustained by a jury of ordinary citizens. Expert testimony is not required.\n\n2. Negligence in Non-Caregiving Matters\n\nWorkers can also cause injuries to consumers in ways that are not directly related to the provision of personal assistance services. The worker will necessarily be in the consumer's home on a regular basis and may unwittingly -- and negligently -- create a hazardous condition that results in injury to the consumer. Two lawsuits against home care agencies illustrate the possibilities for such claims:\n\nFalling supply bag. In Rogers v. Crossroads Nursing Service, Inc., the plaintiff was receiving home health care services from the defendant agency while he recovered from back surgery.87 He sued the agency alleging that \"a Crossroads employee negligently placed a heavy supply bag on a table close to him that fell and re-injured his back.\"88 The agency argued that the case fell under the state's Medical Liability and Insurance Improvement Act and that the case should be dismissed because the plaintiff had failed to provide the expert report required under that Act, a defense similar to that in the Headley case.89 But also as in Headley, the defense was ultimately unsuccessful -- although the trial court dismissed the action, the appellate court reversed, reasoning that \"the question of how to place a heavy supply bag in a patient's home so as not to injure the patient is not governed by an accepted industry standard of safety within the health care industry, but rather is governed by the standard of ordinary care.\"90\n\nBurning magazines. The critical issue in Daniels v. Senior Care, Inc., was whether the negligence of a home care worker who acted as a live-in companion caused a house fire that killed both the worker and the elderly woman for whom she provided care.91 The children of the deceased woman filed a wrongful death action against the agency that had employed the worker, arguing that she was responsible for the fire either because she \"allowed the decedent to accumulate papers and magazines on the heater, when she was under a duty to prevent the decedent from doing so, or, alternatively, [because she] placed these combustibles on the heater herself.\"92 The trial court rejected these arguments and granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment, but the appellate court disagreed.93 Citing testimony from the fire marshal regarding the likely cause of the fire, the appellate court held that \"Plaintiffs submitted a probative factual scenario showing that Defendant's breach of its duties to decedent was a proximate cause of her death.\"94\n\nThese cases illustrate a critical point: an injury is unlikely to result in a lawsuit unless there is a potential defendant who has a \"deep pocket.\" In both these cases and in all the cases discussed in the preceding section, the plaintiff asserted a claim against the home health care agency which employed the negligent employee, and in most of the cases, the plaintiff did not name the individual employees involved in the plaintiff's care as additional defendants. The reason for this is obvious: the agency is likely to have significant assets and/or liability insurance, whereas home care agency employees who provide personal care services, rather than skilled medical care, are low-wage workers who are likely to have few assets. In the consumer-directed personal assistance services model, no such agency \"deep pocket\" is readily available to compensate a consumer for injuries caused by a personal assistant, making recovery of compensation for such injuries problematic unless the personal assistant has significant assets or liability insurance that covers torts committed in the course of the personal assistant's work. On the other hand, workers who do have significant assets, but who are not protected by insurance, risk serious financial consequences if they are sued for allegedly negligent care. However, most CDPAS workers do not have significant assets, and the familial relationship between many, if not most, consumers and workers further reduces the likelihood that a legal action will be brought against a worker who negligently, but unintentionally, causes an injury to the consumer.\n\n3. Abuse or Neglect\n\nUnder limited circumstances, personal assistance workers also face the risk of liability under state adult protective services (APS) laws. These laws, which are in effect in all fifty states and the District of Columbia, provide the framework for government intervention in cases of suspected abuse, neglect or financial exploitation of vulnerable adults. There are two ways CDPAS workers may become liable under such laws: (1) if they are mandatory reporters and they fail to report suspected abuse or neglect; and (2) if they provide substandard care which constitutes abuse or neglect. Note that these risks are no different for CDPAS workers than they are for employees of home care agencies. However, as a practical matter, a worker employed directly by the consumer or the consumer's representative, especially if the worker is a family member, may have greater social or emotional barriers to reporting, such as fear of retaliation, compared to agency-employed workers, who have less personal entanglement with the family.\n\na. Failure to Report Abuse or Neglect\n\nUnder many APS laws, personal assistance workers are \"mandatory reporters\" -- that is, they are legally required to report suspected abuse and can face significant criminal and civil penalties if they fail to do so. The coverage of APS statutes -- that is, the legal definition of the persons protected by the statutes -- varies greatly from state to state. Although the APS statutes in several states protect only the elderly,95 the APS laws in most states apply to both older and younger adults who are vulnerable due to physical and/or mental impairment.96 Typical of such states is Florida, which defines \"vulnerable adult\" as \"a person 18 years of age or older whose ability to perform the normal activities of daily living or to provide for his or her own care or protection is impaired due to a mental, emotional, physical, or developmental disability or dysfunctioning, or brain damage, or the infirmities of aging.\"97\n\nBecause they are in the consumer's home on a regular basis, CDPAS workers are in an excellent position to observe abuse. Most consumers of personal assistance services are elderly and/or have physical and/or mental impairments that place them within the protection of their state's APS statute, so the critical issue in determining whether a worker is required to report abuse is the scope of the mandatory reporting provision. Only six states do not mandate reporting of suspected abuse.98 The other forty-four states and the District of Columbia include mandatory reporting provisions in their statutes. Seventeen of these states require \"any person\" to report suspected abuse, and in these states CDPAS workers would, of course, be mandatory reporters.99\n\nThe other 27 states and the District of Columbia list categories of individuals, such as social workers and health care providers, who are mandated to report. Many of these states include categories that would cover CDPAS workers. For example, Alabama, Alaska, Nebraska and South Carolina identify \"caregivers,\" both paid and unpaid, as mandatory reporters.100 Three other states require reporting by persons who have assumed responsibility for the care of a vulnerable adult.101 Several other states mandate reporting by paid care providers only. For example, Pennsylvania requires reporting by \"any person who is employed or who enters into a contractual relationship to provide care to a care-dependent individual for monetary consideration in the individual's place of residence.\"102 Because mandatory reporting provisions are amended occasionally to add new categories of reporters, the scope of the reporting obligation in any particular state can be determined only by referring to the current statutory language.\n\nIt is important to note that even if a worker is a mandatory reporter, the worker may nonetheless be very reluctant to make a report, despite the possibility of a criminal penalty for failure to do so.103 Recent statistics on the prevalence of elder abuse indicate that abuse of vulnerable adults is perpetrated most often by family members.104 The majority of the CDPAS workers in the Cash and Counseling states are also family members and are therefore likely to confront conflicting loyalties if they observe abuse.105 A daughter/worker may not want to report her father's emotional abuse of her mother/consumer. A daughter-in-law/worker may be afraid to report abuse of her mother-in-law/consumer by a husband who is also abusive to her, or she may be benefiting from her husband's financial abuse of his mother.106 While there are no ready answers to these conflicts, workers who are mandatory reporters should be made aware of their reporting obligation and the risks they run for failure to report (in addition to criminal penalties, the APS laws in a few states provide for a civil cause of action for failure to report abuse of a vulnerable adult).107\n\nb. Abuse or Neglect by the Worker\n\nMany APS statutes provide for criminal and/or civil liability for engaging in abuse, neglect or financial exploitation of a vulnerable adult. Thus, a second, but less likely, basis for worker liability under an APS statute is substandard care that reaches the level of abuse or neglect (and although this standard may not be clearly defined in the statute or case law, it is clearly considerably higher than the ordinary care standard that creates the potential for tort liability). Two cases, one involving a paid caregiver who provided personal assistance services and one involving a home care agency, illustrate the extreme degree of neglect required to support a finding of criminal liability:\n\nProsecution of caretaker neglect. In Commonwealth v. Waskovich, the defendant, Charles Waskovich, had entered into a care arrangement with Kenneth Andrews, an elderly gentleman who had been living alone.108 Under the arrangement, Waskovich and his wife would live in Andrews' home and provide him with personal assistance services, and the value of those services (set at $7.00 an hour) was to be applied toward the purchase of Mr. Andrews' house.109 After Mr. Andrews died from \"pneumonia and severe infection associated with bedsores,\"110 Maskovich was convicted on charges of neglect of a care dependent person resulting in serious bodily injury.111 Under Pennsylvania law, a \"caretaker is guilty of neglect of a care-dependent person if he... [i]ntentionally, knowingly or recklessly causes bodily injury or serious bodily injury by failing to provide treatment, care, goods or services necessary to preserve the health, safety or welfare of a care-dependent person for whom he is responsible to provide care.\"112 \"Caretaker\" is defined as including a person \"who has an obligation to care for a care-dependent person for monetary consideration... in the care-dependent person's home.\"113 On appeal, Waskovich argued that the evidence did not support a finding that he was a \"caretaker,\" but the appellate court disagreed and upheld his conviction, citing the following key facts:\n\nAppellant performed health-related duties (such as taking Mr. Andrews to the doctor, giving him a bath, changing his dressing, and attending to him during the night). Nurse Reede testified that Appellant introduced himself as Mr. Andrews' sole caregiver. Appellant controlled Nurse Reede's visitation of Mr. Andrews, and Appellant refused additional [Medicare] services for Mr. Andrews' benefit.114\n\nProsecution of agency neglect. In Caretenders, Inc. v. Commonwealth of Kentucky, a client, who had been receiving home care from the defendant agency since September 1987, was observed on January 15, 1988, by her treating physician to have developed several decubitus ulcers.115 The client was admitted to the hospital on February 9, 1988 with \"'multiple, extensive' decubiti on her body. The area over her sacrum was larger and extended to her bone. [A doctor at the hospital] reported that she appeared unwashed and smelled of necrotic material.\"116 The agency and three of its nurses, but not the employees who were involved in the direct care of the client, were indicted under Section 209.090(2) of the Kentucky APS statute, which provides that \"[a]ny caretaker who knowingly abuses or neglects an adult is guilty of a Class C felony.\"117 Kentucky defines \"abuse or neglect\" in pertinent part as \"the infliction of physical pain, injury or mental injury, or the deprivation of services by a caretaker which are necessary to maintain the health and welfare of an adult.\"118 \"Caretaker\" is defined as \"an individual or institution who has the responsibility for the care of the adult as the result of a family relationship, or who has assumed the responsibility for the care of the adult voluntarily, or by contract, or agreement.\"119 The jury convicted the agency, but not the three nurses, and the jury's verdict was upheld on appeal.120\n\nB. Consumer Liability Risk\n\nAt first blush, claims by workers against consumers may appear to be a matter of little concern because Medicaid recipients are almost by definition judgment proof. All Medicaid recipients must meet certain income and asset limitations in other to qualify,121 and it should be emphasized that these income and asset limitations make it unlikely that a worker would consider it worthwhile to pursue a potential claim against a consumer. There are, however, at least three situations in which it might make economic sense to bring such a claim:\n\nFirst, the Medicaid asset tests permit recipients to retain their home as an asset,122 and particularly in the case of older Medicaid beneficiaries, these homes may have substantial value.123 At the same time, state debtors law may protect the homestead.\n\nSecond, claims against a consumer who is a homeowner or renter, or who resides with a homeowner or renter, may be covered by the liability provisions of an insurance policy on the house or rental unit or by a separate \"umbrella\" liability policy. This is important because the most likely claim by a worker is for an injury resulting from alleged negligence in providing a safe workplace, the workplace being the consumer's residence.124\n\nThe third, and perhaps most significant, way a worker could recover is by naming someone other than the consumer as a defendant. Some consumers live with family members who have substantial incomes and assets. Particularly in the case of injuries in the home, the worker is likely to sue such family members in addition to or instead of the consumer, as is illustrated in the premises liability cases discussed in Section II.B.1. Another possibility is that a worker will name the consumer's authorized representative as a defendant on the theory that the representative is the joint employer of the worker.125 In cases where the representative independently (that is, without consultation or direction from the consumer) performs most of the functions of an employer (hiring the worker, setting the worker's hours, assigning the tasks to be performed by the worker, etc.), as is likely to be the case if the consumer suffers from dementia, the representative may well be found to be a joint employer, or even the sole employer.126\n\nThus, from the standpoint of consumers and their family members and representatives who are not judgment proof, the possibility of liability to workers is a real concern.127 Conversely, in cases where the consumer and any other likely defendants are judgment proof or lack sufficient assets or insurance to provide compensation for injuries and other work-related claims, the worker has a very serious concern. This is especially true if the worker is not covered by workers' compensation.\n\nBecause in some cases, there will be an economic incentive for such a claim, there is good reason to explore the potential for personal injury claims by workers against consumers. The three most likely bases of liability are discussed below: (1) negligence in maintaining the worker's workplace, that is, the consumer's home; (2) negligent and intentional injuries caused by consumers with a mental impairment; and (3) wrongful discharge and other employment law claims.128\n\n1. Negligence in Maintaining the Workplace (i.e., the Home)\n\nThere are no reported lawsuits by workers against consumers of CDPAS. Nevertheless, numerous actions for negligence have been brought against consumers by other home care providers, and these cases provide a good picture of the claims that are likely to arise in the context of CDPAS. Significantly, most of these cases were brought by individual independent providers who were not employed by agencies. The reason for this is undoubtedly the fact that agency providers are covered by workers' compensation and therefore can receive compensation for workplace injuries without bringing a negligence action or proving negligence by the employer.129 Conversely, most privately employed individual providers are not covered by workers' compensation and, thus, their only recourse is to seek tort damages.130 In some of these cases, the actual recipient of the home care services either was not a defendant or was not the primary defendant. Instead, recovery was sought from a relative of the recipient (usually a son or daughter) who was the actual employer of the provider and/or owned the premises where the provider worked. These cases reinforce the concern that family members of judgment proof CDPAS consumers who have significant assets are at some risk of being identified as \"deep pockets\" and named as defendants in claims for on the job injuries.\n\nAbout half of the reported decisions alleging that a homeowner or renter was negligent are standard slip and fall cases -- that is, cases that allege that the consumer negligently created or allowed a condition to exist in the consumer's home that caused the worker to slip and fall and sustain injury. The rest of the reported cases involve a variety of alleged hazards -- defective furniture or appliances, pets that bite or otherwise endanger workers, and the like. The fact patterns are typical of those in premises liability claims, and the fact that the injury occurred in the context of the provision of home care services rarely is a factor in determining the consumer's liability.\n\nTo clarify the legal principles that operate in these lawsuits, a brief summary of the law of premises liability law is necessary. Under traditional common law, the duty of a landowner (or possessor of land) to an entrant on the property was determined by the status of the entrant, and the landowner's duty therefore varied according "
