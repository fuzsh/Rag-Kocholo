        "text": "CEDAR RAPIDS – Mount Mercy’s Calli Janik enjoys playing softball.\n\nShe said that has been the case since the very first time she stepped on the diamond. Her enthusiasm is evident, watching her interact with teammates or listening to her chatter, whether she’s catching or playing first base.\n\nConsider it a mix of competitive and cheerful attitude.\n\n“I always try to keep it light-hearted,” Janik said. “At the end of the day, it is just a game. I always have fun playing it. If I’m not having fun playing it, then I always reflect on how I can make the adjustment. I think it’s important to break the tension if there ever are nerves.”\n\nJanik has emerged as the emotional and offensive leader for the Mustangs. She made big gains from last season and currently leads the team in eight batting categories after the split against MidAmerica Nazarene in a Heart of American Athletic Conference doubleheader Friday night at Busse Field. Mount Mercy rebounded for a 10-2 victory in five innings after a 5-2 setback in the opener.\n\nJanik’s demeanor has made just as big of an impact on the Mustangs as her production.\n\n“She’s definitely a team leader, for sure,” Mount Mercy Coach Larry Yoder said. “She is always having fun. She’s kind of the team goofball. Everybody looks to her in that way. She keeps things light in the dugout. She just has a good sense of humor and is a good kid to be around.”\n\nAcademics and athletics seem to mesh perfectly for Janik. She is studying in Mount Mercy’s highly-regarded nursing program. Janik said she was influenced by her grandmothers – one was a nurse and the other a nurse’s aide. She enjoyed hearing about their experiences and the connections made with people from their bedside.\n\nThe same lively personality that endears her to teammates transfers to nursing.\n\n“I like to be out-going and I like to make people laugh,” Janik said. “I try my best. As coach points out, I’m kind of a goofball. I try to bring that same sort of attitude to my patient care. I feel like trying to make people laugh is always my goal. Just try to keep things light.”\n\nYoder’s flexibility helped attract Janik to the school. She praised the 15-year Mount Mercy head coach for the way he works with nursing students and understands the balance between school and softball.\n\n“I have to miss some practice time and I have to make that up,” Janik said. “All of our exams come during practice. I’ve had to come late to a game the other day.\n\n“It attracted me to Mount Mercy because they work so well with me here.”\n\nJanik hit her team-high eighth double and scored two runs, reaching base in all three at-bats in Game 2 of Friday night’s twinbill.\n\nThe sophomore from Wauconda, Ill., has already surpassed last season’s totals in hits, RBIs, runs, triples and total bases. She is also more than .100 points better in batting average, on-base and slugging percentages. Her four home runs matched last year’s total in 25 fewer at-bats.\n\nYoder said she showed signs of this output last year and has grown from a year of experience.\n\n“She worked real hard over the summer to try and keep improving herself,” Yoder said. “It didn’t just happen by accident. She’s out there working hard.”\n\nJanik said her biggest gains have been mental. She dedicated a lot of time to her craft in the offseason, while working as a bullpen catcher at a hitting facility near her home in Illinois. The extra effort is the source of her increased faith in her ability.\n\nJanik is batting .364 with 39 hits, 61 total bases, 13 extra-base hits and 26 RBIs – all team bests.\n\n“I think it always comes from what coach always says in practice,” Janik said. “Practice builds confidence. I think we’ve built a lot of confidence with all the reps we’ve put in during the season, in the fall and the winter.\n\n“I know what my good pitch looks like coming in. It’s just about visualizing and seeing the ball off my bat.”\n\nMount Mercy moved to 18-18 overall and 6-8 in the conference. MidAmerica Nazarene is 20-18 and 7-7. The Mustangs smacked eight hits in Game 2 that included a seven-run second inning. Natalie Tecklenburg had three RBIs and Annika Headington and Sam Lee added two apiece for Mount Mercy. Ashley Smith had two hits to lead the Mustangs in the opener.\n\n“We’ll be alright,” Yoder said. “We’re coming down the stretch. I think we’re playing better softball. We just need to be more consistent with it.”\n\nComments: kj.pilcher@thegazette.com"
