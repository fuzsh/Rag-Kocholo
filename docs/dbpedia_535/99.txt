Hidden in the background the illuminy named Sessuminy is hiding between Twisted/Original Illuminy. For FNaI 4: Soon He will start the development of his next masterpiece... which for now he will call "FNaI 4", he wanted this game to be the real grand finale of the illuminy saga, so he want something 100 times higher than the third installment came out.

Creation of the Five Nights at Illuminy's 4 page[]

Janik posted a April fools prank of the fourth installment on April 1, 2022. And he said: GUYS FNAI 4 IS REAL!. and it says on the description of the fourth installment's page on GameJolt: Yes. This is official, NO THIS IS NOT A APRIL FOOL. Not much as known better.

Cancellation of FNaI 4[]

On July 2, 2022. Janik decided to cancel Five Nights at Illuminy's 4. He realized that the project was too long to do. In fact in recent months he have practically done almost nothing. But now he has clear ideas, he knows how the fourth installment will come, he didn't think it will take too long this time. (Will the game be that different from how he just originally designed it?) What would happen if the fourth installment is different: The plot and all the illuminies and other animatronics will be the same, the only thing that will drastically change will be the gameplay and its focal point. The game led to one of the cancelation of FNAF fangames between 2015 - 2022. And then it is designed as: Five Nights at Illuminy's: MR (A Five Nights at Illuminy's version of Ultimate Custom Night.).

The beginning of Five Nights at Illuminy's: MR[]

On July 9, 2022: The minor teaser is shown: Janik said: Today is the day when something BIG is about to happen. and the teaser is being brightened it says above the text of "Today is the day where..." saying: "HE will pay for everything".

FNaI: MR[]

On August 29, 2022, Five Nights at Illuminy's: MR is designed as: a illuminy version of Ultimate Custom Night, The first installment is going very slowly due to several things. There may be demos. Is it just a common ucn?: Uh: no. The illuminy saga's finale must be worthy of the name, Janik just said that the UCN part of the gameplay is just the tip of the iceberg of something bigger and deeper. The fourth installment's released planned for Summer 2023. in a few weeks. Janik will currently draw the cameras. The fourth installment is said that the animatronics and characters are returning from the previous installments. Except Three Nights with Starminy.
