        "text": "Paessler is well-known for its PRTG monitoring product, which recently expanded with its first product extension that provided industrial customers with the same ease of monitoring operational technology (OT) as IT administrators are used to for typical information technology.\n\nIn fact, Paessler has a keen interest in industry and recently commissioned research into the sustainability practices of business and industrial sectors across diverse regions. You can find that research paper here, and Paessler regional manager APAC Felix Berndt writes about the findings here, also on iTWire. In essence, Paessler's research has analysed the factors that drive and hinder the adoption of sustainable IT practices, and Felix breaks it down into six clear factors.\n\nIt's an issue that's close to Paessler's heart because its very tool - PRTG - provides the raw data that can actively help organisations of all sizes pinpoint where they can improve energy efficiency and reduce their carbon footprint.\n\nIn short, businesses that embrace sustainability not only attain goodwill and serve the planet but they also reduce their energy (and hence, cost) wastage.\n\nIt's a fascinating report that clearly articulates the problem and why we all ought to take note.\n\niTWireTV spoke with Felix to learn more about the research findings, what is driving the company's initiatives today, and why sustainability may not always be on their radar, but why it should be.\n\nSee our conversation here:"
