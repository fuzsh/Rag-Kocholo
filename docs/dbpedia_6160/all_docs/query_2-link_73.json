        "text": "Just under six in 10 (59%) Australian IT administrators are frustrated by unexpected network issues in the workplace, according to a new study from network monitoring company Paessler.\n\nA survey conducted by the company found that just over a third of Australian IT administrators feel there is a lack of understanding and appreciation for what they do.\n\nMeanwhile, more than half (52%) of Australian respondents feel frustrated by end users reporting problems before IT is able to discover them.\n\nPaessler Director of Sales Operations for Asia-Pacific George Wilson said Australian IT administrators feeling overstressed and underappreciated is a common problem, with just 14% of Australian staff claiming to have no frustrations at work.\n\n“This survey suggests that Australian IT staff are feeling a sense of vulnerability with issues potentially originating from the users themselves, many no doubt due to human error. At the same time, there really does appear to be little appreciation for the work that IT staff do for their business,” he said.\n\n“The IT administrator’s role is only really made apparent when something goes wrong. Indeed, tasked with deploying and managing hardware and software, the traditional view still holds that the IT department is not a group that can provide strategic vision and advice.”\n\nWilson said IT sits at the heart of the modern business, and is essential for operations. Accordingly, if organisations want to thrive, the situation must change.\n\n“Rather than being predominantly labelled as a cost centre or reactive service provider, the IT department must be given the opportunity to become more innovative and, as a result, better positioned to take the lead role in digital transformation projects,” he said. “Maybe then we will see frustrations dissipate among IT administrators.”\n\nImage credit: ©stock.adobe.com/au/BillionPhotos.com"
