        "text": "LOS ANGELES and NUREMBERG, Germany, Feb. 2 /PRNewswire/ -- Despite a global economic crisis that has spawned massive job losses in many parts of the world, Paessler AG, a leading provider of network monitoring and performance optimization solutions, announced today that it has increased staff by 25 percent in order to meet rising demand for its award-winning networking monitoring solutions.\n\nWith revenue up by more than 30 percent, the company posted exceptional growth in 2009. Further expansion is expected this year, driven by growing demand among companies of all sizes for affordable, easy to use, efficient network monitoring tools. The rapid adoption of virtualization, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephony and hosted solutions have increased the need for both companies and managed service providers to ensure dependability and quality of service for their ever-growing data needs.\n\n\"Companies today have become critically dependent on the reliability of their IT resources,\" said Dirk Paessler, CEO of Paessler AG. \"They're paying more attention to the optimization of infrastructure. They want to get the best performance out of their existing resources and avoid overspending on upgrades, while at the same time preventing costly downtime and data transmission delays, which can directly affect their profitability.\"\n\nTo help meet growing demand on a global scale, Paessler has expanded its North American presence with the addition of a General Manager to further develop the company's strong position in the U.S. market and provide on-the-ground attention to customers in the U.S. and Canada.

Paessler provides, with their PRTG Network Monitor 7.2, a complete, highly scalable and user friendly product at a price one usually associates more with entry level software. However, our test showed that the price is deceptively cheap as, of all the products tested, PRTG Network Monitor 7.2 was in fact the most comprehensively equipped monitoring package and also the simplest to use.\"\n\nFor more information about Paessler's industry-leading network monitoring solutions, visit www.paessler.com.\n\nAbout Paessler AG\n\nPaessler AG leads the industry in providing the most powerful, affordable and easy-to-use network monitoring and testing solutions.
