        "text": "Depends on your definition of small…\n\nOur organization’s set up.\n\n8 pc’s, 1 laptop and 1 Mac Book pro.\n\n17 - IPads\n\n1 smart screen ( android)\n\n2 chrome books\n\nWe use Manageengine UEM ( free full license for less than 25 tablets and 25 computers. Fully managed endpoints with auto patching and auto app updates, RMM, and much more…. Have setup reports to send notices via email of what endpoints are patched/ updated and which ones are not ( every Tuesday). These reports are automated. We just switched over to ESET from Bitdefender GravityZone, Chromebooks, Pc’s and laptops are fully managed with the AV suite, cloud apps and Email. I have reports set up to email status 3x a week. If something is detected, ESET is configured to isolate the endpoint ( disconnect from network and internet) and send me an email alert.\n\nFirewall, all alerts and detections instant notifications to my phone and email. Rarely get anything, use SafeDNS for filtering; and GEO IP filtered out all countries except for the services we utilize.\n\niPads are locked down, MDM configuration; and Heavily restricted via DNS filtering with only white listed apps and content available, no email, so we do not run any AV on them, they are on a guest network with client isolation protocols. Have not really found any AV product that integrates in to IOS very well and those that do have limited functionality at best.\n\nKind regards,\n\nCC\n\n@randyaz ​, Migrated from ME desk top central to UEM, it is amazing. And once I am positioned to further expand my IT business the licensing is not terrible either. Tried MS Intune with Defender for endpoint, have one machine still on it, I do not find it a friendly platform but i am self taught also. Have locked myself out of more than one lab pc with changing the wrong settings in Azure…. Tried JamF, looked into Sentinel 1, crowd strike, and Heimdal, but those were too much for what i need and do. There are many products out there just need to find the one that fits your system.\n\nHow many endpoints are you monitoring? ME syncs nicely with AAD and Google workspace and with Apple School Manager……\n\nCheers,\n\nCC"
