With a catalogue of different requirements, it serves as a framework for organisations to assure high, consistent quality, customer satisfaction and well-functioning processes.\n\n“At Paessler, it has always been a key objective to provide customers with the best possible products and services. We are proud that our efforts are recognised with the ISO 9001 certification“, said Evren Erisen, Team Lead Quality at Paessler, who led the preparation process.\n\nDuring external certification audits at the Paessler headquarters in Nuremberg (Germany), the processes at the top management level as well as different departments, such as Product Development, Finance, Sales and Partner Management, were put to the acid test. After three days of audits conducted by DQS, Paessler was successfully certified."
