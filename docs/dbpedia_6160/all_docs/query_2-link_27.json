        "text": "Paessler is pleased to announce the appointment of Dinesh Senanayake as Chief Operations Officer (COO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO). Senanayake brings extensive experience in managing international operations and finances across diverse business environments. Having lived and worked in many countries, he is well-equipped to lead Paessler’s global teams into the future.\n\nSenanayake assumed his role at Paessler in May 2024. In the past, he has held various management positions in founder-led, publicly listed and private equity businesses. During his career as a leader, he focused specifically on evolving global sales and marketing strategies, customer experience management, and guiding global teams successfully through change. His unique combination of deep operational knowledge paired with profound financial and administrative insights provides an excellent basis for the tasks at hand.\n\nIn his last position as COO and CFO at Ventiv Technology, he successfully integrated financial and operational management, driving improvements in recurring revenue, sales, professional services, and product management. His authentic leadership style in guiding founder-led businesses through change will be invaluable to Paessler, following the recent strategic investment made into the business by Turn River Capital. Senanayake will leverage his dual expertise in operations and finance to drive innovation and operational excellence at Paessler.\n\n\"We are proud to have such a versatile talent join Paessler’s management team,\" said Helmut Binder, CEO of Paessler GmbH. \"Dinesh understands international markets and knows how to build business operations while maintaining financial efficiency. I am confident he will help us expand our business and tackle the challenges ahead.\"\n\nDriving innovation and elevating customer experience\n\nTo master increasingly complex global market conditions, Senanayake regards the enablement of the customer via robust product offerings for versatile use cases as a key element. He is poised to leverage the support of Paessler’s new investor, Turn/River Capital, to drive the company forward, utilising investments to foster innovation, ensure quality, and expand Paessler’s product and services portfolio.\n\n\"Paessler and its talented employees have a strong foundation, market reputation, and significant potential,\" said Senanayake. \"I see tremendous opportunities to drive growth in this exciting new phase for the company. I highly value the trust of our customers and employees. Driving innovation, harnessing the capabilities of our new investor, and navigating the challenges and opportunities ahead of us will be an inspiring chapter in my career. I am committed to ensuring operational excellence for our customers.\"\n\nLooking ahead, Senanayake aims to navigate new markets by driving innovation and enabling customers to save resources and conclusively identify possibilities for effective cost reduction via monitoring. Continuous optimisation of the robust product offering will further empower Paessler’s customers to gain a holistic overview of their IT, OT, and IoT infrastructure.\n\nAbout Paessler GmbH\n\nPaessler believes monitoring plays a vital part in reducing humankind's consumption of resources.
