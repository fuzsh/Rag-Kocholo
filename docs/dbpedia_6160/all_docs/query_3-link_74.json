        "text": "Discover the top network management software solutions with features like network mapping, visualization and automatic device discovery.\n\nLast updated on Jul 01, 2024\n\nWritten by Caitlin Harris\n\nTechnical review by Laura Iannini\n\nThe Top 10 Network Management Software Include:\n\n1. Paessler PRTG Network Monitor\n\n2. Atera\n\n3. Auvik Network Manager\n\n4. Catchpoint Network Experience\n\n5. Datadog Network Monitoring\n\n6. LogicMonitor Envision\n\n7. ManageEngine OpManager\n\n8. Progress WhatsUp Gold\n\n9. SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor\n\n10. Zabbix\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for IT teams isn’t just keeping the network running, it’s keeping it running effectively. In the face of cyber adversaries attempting to breach the network to steal or corrupt data, and accidental damage caused by misconfigurations, it can be very difficult to manage a network manually. That’s where network monitoring and management software comes in.\n\nNetwork monitoring is the process of monitoring the network for slow, failing, or damaged assets. These solutions make sure an admin is aware of each issue and has the capacity to remediate it. This may seem like a simple task, but it can quickly become overwhelming as a network grows – the more devices, applications, and services on a network, the more complex it is to monitor and manage. Network monitoring and management tools take care of this for you by automating some of the more time-consuming processes involved in network monitoring, such as device discovery and asset mapping. This leaves your IT team with more time to spend on responding to alerts and ensuring that the network is running as efficiently and securely as possible.\n\nThere are two main ways in which network monitoring tools can work: they’re either agent-based, or agentless. Agent-based tools usually deliver most of the software (i.e., the management features) as-a-Service, which can be accessed via a web-based interface. You then just need to install the monitoring agent on each device on your network, and the software will report back telemetry from that device to your web-based interface. Agentless tools are often installed on-premises. They don’t require you to install an agent on each device in order to monitor them; they just need the access credentials for those devices. While this saves time on implementation, it also generally requires more resource to run than an agent-based system.\n\nIn this article, we’ll explore the top network monitoring and management software. We’ll look at features such as network mapping and visualization, automatic device discovery, and reporting and analytics. We’ll give you some background information on the provider and the key features of each solution, as well as the type of customer that they are most suitable for.\n\n1\n\nHeadquartered in Nuremberg, Germany, Paessler is an IT software provider that specializes in IT and IoT monitoring. PRTG is their IT infrastructure monitoring platform, which offers cloud-based monitoring for SMBs and on-prem monitoring for organizations of all sizes operating a Windows network.\n\nPaessler PRTG Network Monitor Features:\n\nMonitors the entire network—including systems, devices, traffic, and applications—using simple network management protocol, Windows Management Instrumentation, packet sniffing, and SSH, with support for Ping, SNMP, WMI, HTTP requests and flow protocols\n\nSupport for distributed networks, with the ability to monitor an unlimited number of remote locations\n\nAutomatically discovers all network devices and creates sensors for them\n\nReal-time topography maps visualize the network and display live status information for network assets\n\nCustomizable report templates and dashboards ensure IT teams can access the information they need immediately\n\nAlerting on network issues and anomalous metrics via email, push notification, and HTTP request, with the option to set custom thresholds for alerting\n\nWeb interface, desktop app, and mobile apps for iOS and Android\n\nPricing And Plan: Paessler PRTG is available via three versions. PRTG Network Monitor starts at €1,649/license and supports small- to mid-sized companies. PRTG Enterprise Monitor starts at €15,249/year and supports larger enterprises. Paessler also offers a freeware version of PRTG that includes all features and up to 100 monitoring sensors (PRTG Network Monitor Offers up to 10,000 sensors).\n\nExpert Insights’ Comments: Paessler PRTG is a highly flexible platform, able to host on-prem or in the cloud and monitor a local network or a distributed network across multiple remote locations. Its flexible pricing plans and ease of management make this solution suitable for organizations of all sizes, and its range of management interfaces makes PRTG accessible to both on-prem and remote IT teams.\n\n2\n\nAtera\n\nAtera is an IT monitoring and management provider headquartered in Tel Aviv, Israel. Their lightweight, cloud-based platform combines remote network discovery, remote management, professional services automation (PSA), remote access, patch management, and help desk services. These tools enable IT teams to streamline their network management processes and reduce strain on resources, while proactively remediating issues.\n\nAtera Features:\n\nCompatible with Windows, MacOS, Linux, and SNMP devices\n\nContinuous network scanning maps all assets (including ports) across Workgroup and Domain controller networks, highlighting the presence of any unauthorized devices and making it easier to identify vulnerabilities, e.g., missing patches or security software\n\nAutomatic notifications alert IT teams to changes across the network for faster investigation\n\nActive Directory integration enables IT teams to monitor device and user information across specific domains or subdomains\n\nWorkgroup scanning provides data on all assets across a LAN\n\nAutomation of IT maintenance and administrative tasks such as system scans, reboots, update checks, and patching, free up IT resource to focus on more complex issues\n\nDynamic reporting and activity logging provide a real-time picture of the entire network for security and auditing\n\nPricing And Plans: Atera for IT teams is available via four packages. Professional ($149/month/technician) is suitable for individuals that need to manage a small network. This package doesn’t include automatic network discovery. Expert ($169) is suitable for small teams managing a network with multiple device types. Master ($199) is suitable for large teams looking for automatic troubleshooting and remediation. Enterprise pricing is available from Atera on request. These prices reflect an annual subscription – monthly subscriptions are more expensive.\n\nExpert Insights’ Comments: Atera is designed to be a “one stop shop” for IT teams and MSPs. It offers lots of functionality besides the network monitoring features listed above, such as multi-tenancy, an in-built helpdesk system, and PSA tools. This makes it a strong solution for an IT team looking to unify their network and asset management processes. However, because network discovery isn’t available in the Professional package, we recommend Atera as a strong network monitoring tool for IT teams managing mid-size to larger networks.\n\nHeadquartered in Ontario, Canada, Auvik is a provider of cloud-based network and application management software. Auvik’s Network Manager solution provides many of out-of-the-box features designed to help IT teams identify issues across their network before they develop into more complex security or performance problems.
