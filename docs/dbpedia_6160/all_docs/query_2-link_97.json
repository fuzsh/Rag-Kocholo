        "text": "If I say Germany, you likely think of luxury cars and dark beer; not a bad reputation to have.\n\nWell, you should add one more thing to that list — a rising and thriving tech scene. In fact, this country has the ingredients to one day rise to the top of Europe’s tech world.\n\nThe State of European Tech 2017 reported, “The UK and Germany are viewed as the two countries best positioned within Europe to build world-leading positions in key deep tech fields.” Germany dominates in fields such as cybersecurity, autonomous vehicles, robotics, virtual reality and augmented reality. This shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone, as Germany has been planting the seeds to become a tech powerhouse for years.\n\nThree of Europe’s top 10 computer science-focused universities are located in German cities — Munich, Karlsruhe and Aachen. Germany is also “the #2 destination behind the UK for migrants into the tech industry.” (Atomico) And as Atomico writes, talent is the most important piece of any tech ecosystem. Therefore, Germany is a breeding ground for talent waiting to burst onto the scene.\n\nThe heart of that talent lies in Berlin. As of March 2018, the city is home to more than 2,500 startups. In 2015, companies in Berlin raised €2.4 billion in venture capital funding, which is more than London or Stockholm — two leaders in Europe’s tech scene. As written in Wired, some believe that Brexit will ultimately have a positive impact on Berlin’s tech scene, as some of the talent is looking to leave the U.K. and, eventually, settle in Berlin.\n\nWith Germany quickly rising through the ranks of Europe’s tech scene, we have pulled together a list of all of the top-rated products on G2 which have parent companies headquartered or located in Germany. Our list is ranked by user satisfaction of a company’s top-rated product. To qualify, a product was required to have at least 10 verified real-user reviews.\n\nFor each qualifying product, we created a company profile to recognize what that company is and does, as well as give a little insight into its history. The data relies on G2 ’s nearly 750,000 B2B software and services reviews, or from publicly-made available data sources such as LinkedIn or each vendor’s website. The report features 25 B2B German software companies which are represented with more than 4,800 verified user reviews across categories from Live Chat Software to Social Media Management to Video Editing Software. Let’s take a look at the major players in Germany’s tech scene, shall we?\n\nNote: Only software vendors on G2 with headquarters currently in Germany are included in graph.\n\nThe Best German Tech Companies in 2019\n\n1. SAP\n\nProduct:Concur\n\nCategory:Expense Management\n\nCity: Walldorf\n\nFounded: 1972\n\nEmployees: 107,784\n\nConcur is the highest-rated product from SAP, which is by far Germany’s largest software vendor and one of the biggest tech companies in the world. Concur is a travel, expense and invoice product, acquired by SAP in 2014. While most vendors on this list have just one product on G2 , SAP has 66 with more than 3,400 total reviews. As an enterprise company, SAP has offices in more than 130 countries.\n\n2. MAXON\n\nProduct:Cinema 4D\n\nCategory:3D Modeling\n\nCity: Friedrichsdorf\n\nFounded: 1985\n\nEmployees: 99\n\nCinema 4D is a 3D modeling platform that can be used for feature films, commercials, music videos and more. With a 4.6 out of 5 star rating on G2 , this platform was named a High Performer in its category for Summer 2016. Companies such as The Walt Disney Company, BMW, Sony Pictures and NBC rely on Cinema 4D for their workflows.\n\n3. TeamViewer\n\nProduct:TeamViewer\n\nCategory:Remote Desktop\n\nCity: Goppingen\n\nFounded: 2005\n\nEmployees: 354\n\nIf you have ever had a member of your IT support team take control of your computer to solve an issue, they’ve done so through remote desktop software. TeamViewer allows you to do that quickly and securely. This German-based product was ranked a High Performer in its category for Summer 2018. It also boasts an impressive 300-plus reviews on G2 , which makes it the second-most-reviewed Germany-based business on G2 ."
