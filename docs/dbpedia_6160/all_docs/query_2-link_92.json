        "text": "How to quickly monitor the latency of your network with PRTG\n\nLatency is a very crucial key element that contributes to the speed of any network. The term refers to a measurement of the time it takes for a data packet to travel between two points. This is often called \"latency\" or a??round-trip time,a?? and a low latency network connection is one that generally experiences small delay times a?? a high latency connection generally suffers from long delays. Not keeping latency spikes to a minimum will endanger the reliability of a whole network. When latency is too high, problems with VoIP and video conferences are likely to arise; furthermore, transmission errors can prevent images from loading. So it's clear that latency issues might push the capacities of any IT department to the limit, present challenges for entire business strategies and can become a serious concern.\n\nMonitoring Stormshield Network Security (SNS) with PRTG\n\nNetwork communication is presented in millions or even billions of incoming and outgoing network packets that are continuously being transmitted in the network. Integrating a powerful firewall with advanced functionalities that can do deep packet inspection and control what traffic should be allowed or denied is very important. There are different ways to do it, and one of them is by using Next-Gen UTM firewalls. Thanks to Stormshield Network Security (SNS), we can anticipate attacks and protect digital infrastructure from potential cybersecurity attacks. Stormshield Network Security solutions are built on the concept of Multi-Layer Collaborative Security. This holistic approach, based on active collaboration between the security engines of Stormshield products and solutions, represents the future of in-depth IT systems protection.\n\n3 Ways you can use PRTG to monitor Industrial IT\n\nRecently, I wrote about monitoring industrial IT convergence, where the worlds of classic Information Technology (IT), Operational Technology (OT) and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) are merging together. The whole point of the article was the importance of having a complete overview of everything in one place. Now, I want to go into a few examples of just what bringing IT, OT and the IIoT together might look like with PRTG Network Monitor.&nbsp;\n\nSome news about PRTG Network Monitor version 20.3.60\n\nPRTG version 20.3.60 is available on the stable release channel since a few days ago! The new version contains 163 resolved issues, several security improvements, more options and improvements for SMS delivery and Amazon SNS notifications, a significantly revamped display of Paessler PRTG Enterprise Monitor license information, another significant update for the Japanese language file and many other neat enhancements for various sensors and the PRTG server.\n\nWhy CPU monitoring matters (and what PRTG can do for you)\n\nThe CPU is probably the most important component of any device in your network. And that is \"probably\" as in probably the earth is spherical. CPU obviously has the potential to affect network performance; not only somehow, but in some cases very seriously. CPU monitoring is the difference between network stability and performance deterioration. Having no powerful and dependable way to monitor the CPU makes the life of every sysadmin quite difficult.\n\nEnvironmental and city monitoring in Coburg\n\nCoburg is a small picturesque town in the Bavarian administrative district of Upper Franconia*, with just over 40,000 inhabitants and a population density of 854 inhabitants per kmA?. The town is situated between the southern foothills of the Thuringian Forest, the Lange Berge and the Main valley a?? and when you look over Coburg's old town you see almost as much green space as houses. In short, when you think of a futuristic urban project in the context of Environmental Monitoring or Smart Cities, you are inclined not to think of a small and local town like Coburg. And therein lies already the first mistake. As we at Paessler have learned, it is precisely the decision makers of smaller towns and communities who are happy to learn about technical possibilities and innovations, because they honestly care about the well-being of their inhabitants. And the second mistake is that the term \"Smart City\" has unfortunately become far too vague (in fact, it has almost become an empty filler word in the tech industry) to describe what we at Paessler have already implemented together with strong partners and will continue to implement in the future. i* Wait, what? ??µ Germany is a small country, but we want to have some states too, ok? So we divide everything into even smaller units. Let me break it down for you: Bavaria is a southern, rather rural state in Germany; a government district is the next lower level. Upper Franconia is in the northern part of Bavaria and this is not the part of Bavaria where you would expect to see many Lederhosen. You can put some on, but that makes you look like an embarrassing tourist.\n\nHow to deploy PRTG Network Monitor in AWS, Azure and GCP\n\nIn October 2017, Paessler launched the first hosted offering of PRTG built on the AWS platform. Since launching that first version of a??PRTG Hosted by Paesslera?? our cloud team has gained a tremendous amount of experience with managing and automating AWS services.Need proof? Check out our own Greg Campion in the video below, as he explains the back end functions for maintaining a hosted solution for our customers running PRTG in the cloud. Over that time, we now have customers across every industry using our hosted offering as it provides nearly all the benefits of an on-premise installation of PRTG without the concerns of updates, backups, redundancy or mobile app connectivity within a flexible SaaS subscription model.\n\nGet more visibility into Hyper-V Server with PRTG\n\nVirtualization is a comprehensive subject and it doesna??t only relate to hardware virtualization, but also application virtualization, network virtualization, storage virtualization, and more. The focus of todaya??s article is about hardware virtualization powered by Microsoft, known as Hyper-V. The first release of the Hyper-V Server took place in Windows Server 2008 and it still exists in Windows Server 2019. Besides that, Microsoft also provides a Hyper-V Core Server that is available since the release of Windows Server 2008 and Hyper-V that comes integrated into Windows 8, 8.1 and Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise and Education editions.\n\nDisplay live video on your PRTG map\n\nThose of you who are familiar with PRTG Network Monitor know that ita??s great for monitoring CCTV systems. Wea??ve published articles and a??How Toa?? guides on the subject, and wea??re technology partners with leading camera manufacturers such as Axis.\n\nMonitoring SQL server performance with PRTG\n\nSQL performance is measured by how efficiently and quickly SQL queries can perform the required function. It can be assessed by the time it takes to complete the operation and whether the output of the operation matches the expected requirements. Ongoing evaluation of SQL server performance helps to minimize response times and maximize throughput, which results in optimal performance. You need to analyze the application requirements, understand the physical structure of the data, and assess database usage. There are always various ways to improve SQL performance!\n\nMonitoring converged industrial IT infrastructure\n\nConvergence is something that almost all technological areas are facing, and industrial IT is no exception. And while factory floors and production lines are scrambling to meet the new challenges brought about by convergence, there is another aspect they must consider, too: how to monitor it all. But before we get to the monitoring aspect, we first should consider just what this convergence means for industrial IT.\n\nPRTG Network Monitor 20.2.59 enhances IoT monitoring capabilities\n\nA quick look at the calendar tells me that it's June 10, 2020. 90% of my colleagues (including myself) continue to work remotely from our homes. This is also reflected in the release 20.2.59 of PRTG Network Monitor, which was developed entirely at home - thanks to the advantages of agile, location-independent software development.\n\nNetwork management at Quaker Houghton runs smoothly thanks to PRTG\n\nQuaker Houghton is the global leader in industrial process fluids. With 4,400 employees, a robust presence around the world, including operations in over 25 countries, their customers include thousands of the worlda??s most advanced and specialized steel, aluminum, automotive, aerospace, offshore, can, mining, and metalworking companies. Quaker Houghton is headquartered in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, located near Philadelphia in the United States. The European headquarters is located in Uithoorn, North Holland. From this location, Erik Kemper, Senior Global Infrastructure Engineer, together with his two American IT colleagues, manages Quaker Houghton's global network infrastructure.\n\nSNMP traps in PRTG\n\nBefore we go into depth on the differences between Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) traps and informs, we must first have a solid understanding of what a trap is.\n\nGetting Modbus TCP data into PRTG\n\nModbus is a communications protocol that has been in use since the 70s, and has become standard for connecting electronic industrial devices. Modbus RTU and Modbus ASCII are used for serial communication, while Modbus TCP is used for devices connected to a TCP/IP network.&nbsp; For IT professionals in a factory setting, who are maintaining traditional network elements and industry-specific infrastructure, Modbus TCP devices often contain important information needed for monitoring the entire infrastructure. Because it would be good to get this information into PRTG, we are currently working on a Modbus TCP sensor. But wea??d love to get your feedback on your use cases and requirements, and what features you want from Modbus TCP sensor."
