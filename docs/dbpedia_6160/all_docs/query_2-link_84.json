        "text": "Alex Macpherson, chief executive officer and co-founder, Kudosity, said, “Aligning with industry leaders like Ortto and MoEngage positions Kudosity to offer unparalleled value to its customers, helping them achieve their business objectives through enhanced communication strategies. These collaborations represent a significant step forward in Kudosity’s growth strategy, demonstrating a continued commitment to innovation and excellence in the messaging technology space.\n\n“Partnering with Ortto and MoEngage lets Kudosity enhance its capabilities and support customers with the tools they need to succeed in a competitive market. These partnerships reflect Kudosity’s dedication to delivering the best possible solutions, empowering organisations to streamline their communication efforts, improve customer engagement, and drive growth.”\n\nKudosity customers can leverage Ortto's powerful automation and customer journey mapping tools, combined with Kudosity’s cutting-edge messaging technology. This partnership will offer businesses a comprehensive solution for managing customer interactions, enhancing engagement, and driving growth through personalised and automated messaging strategies.\n\nPeter Bartlett, director of product, Ortto, said, “More of our customers are using SMS in omnichannel lifecycle campaigns than ever before, and they’re doing so with increasingly clever and complex targeting and messaging. With this increase in demand, we wanted to partner with a messaging platform that is aligned with our values; one that is innovative, builds with the customer front of mind, and allows marketers to bring their best ideas to life. Kudosity checks all the boxes.\n\n“Our partnership will let marketers use their customer data in targeted and behaviour-based SMS campaigns, and track results in intuitive reports and dashboards. We can’t wait to see what our collective customer base will do with this integration.”\n\nSimilarly, the partnership with MoEngage will bring together Kudosity's advanced SMS platform with MoEngage's insight-led customer engagement solution. This integration will empower businesses to deliver consistent, relevant, and personalised messages across multiple channels, enhancing customer experiences and fostering deeper relationships.\n\nSanjay Kupae, head of alliances and partnerships, MoEngage , said \"We recognise the challenges that consumer brands face when navigating a market saturated with outdated technologies that hinder their ability to truly understand and engage their users effectively. Through our partnership with Kudosity, we aim to introduce a new level of agility and flexibility. Combining MoEngage's scalable, insight-led customer engagement platform with Kudosity's additional messaging channels will empower consumer brands to drive stronger retention and unlock new possibilities for growth. We're excited about the potential of this partnership and committed to delivering ongoing value to consumer brands, helping them to thrive in today's competitive environment.\"\n\nThe new partnerships build on Kudosity’s broader channel growth strategy, which will expand the company's reach and impact. Collaborating with industry leaders means Kudosity can offer a more comprehensive suite of solutions, helping businesses navigate the complexities of customer communication in today's digital landscape.\n\nKudosity has consistently achieved impressive year-over-year (YoY) revenue growth since its inception. This success is largely attributed to the company's unwavering commitment to delivering high-quality products and services that meet its customers’ evolving needs. The calibre of Kudosity’s team, expertise, creativity, and dedication continues to drive innovation and push the boundaries of what is possible in the messaging space.\n\nFollowing its proven success in the Australian and New Zealand (ANZ) markets, Kudosity is well-positioned to expand its footprint across Asia and the United States (US). It will bring its extensive experience and industry knowledge to help businesses thrive in an increasingly digital world as the company grows into these regions.\n\nThese partnerships will play a crucial role in driving the company's success as Kudosity continues to grow and evolve. Its focus on innovation, customer-centric solutions, and strategic collaborations equip Kudosity to lead the way in the messaging technology industry.\n\nAlex Macpherson said, “Kudosity’s goal is to provide businesses with the tools they need to connect with their customers in meaningful ways.
