        "text": "In a move aimed at accelerating digital transformation in operational technology (OT) for enterprises across Southeast Asia, Paessler, the renowned monitoring experts for IT infrastructures and networks, have announced a groundbreaking partnership with PATLITE, a global leader in innovative signal towers, alarms, and indicating devices for the factory automation and Industry 4.0 markets.\n\nThe strategic alliance between Paessler and PATLITE brings together their respective expertise to address the challenges faced by organizations operating in the convergence of IT and OT domains. By leveraging Paessler’s extensive experience in IT network monitoring and PATLITE’s capabilities in operational technology, the partnership aims to enable enterprises to achieve a comprehensive and coordinated approach in monitoring both IT and OT systems.\n\nJim Lee, Business Development Manager of Paessler for Asia Pacific, emphasized the significance of this collaboration, stating, “The convergence of IT and OT is proving to be a boon for enterprises, whether it is optimizing operations or gaining a competitive edge. However, siloed stacks of IT and OT can result in challenges that prevent organizations from reaping the full benefits of digital transformation at scale. Our partnership with PATLITE is designed to help customers take a comprehensive and coordinated approach to monitor both IT and OT systems, which will enable organizations to better understand their infrastructure, increase business agility, and ultimately drive business growth.”\n\nThrough this partnership, Paessler will combine its industry-leading PRTG network monitoring solution with its extensive OT experience, providing customers with comprehensive visibility into their entire infrastructure. PRTG is renowned for its ability to monitor IT infrastructure, including servers, switches, routers, and other devices. By integrating with PATLITE’s expertise in OT, organizations can gain valuable insights into their operational infrastructure, including signaling devices, industrial network devices, and other products.\n\nEdmund Gan, General Manager of PATLITE Singapore, expressed enthusiasm for the joint solutions developed through this collaboration, stating, “At PATLITE, our unwavering commitment lies in delivering exceptional business value (Safety, Security, and Comfort) to our customers through this alliance. We fully comprehend the significance of technology and expertise in driving successful transformation journeys for industrial businesses. The collaboration between PATLITE and Paessler will benefit all our customers with our simplified joint solutions, namely the PATLITE Network Tower Light and Paessler PRTG monitoring software. These solutions are easy to understand and facilitate improved productivity and comprehensive process understanding for our customers. With our state-of-the-art capabilities and extensive industry knowledge, we are devoted to working alongside Paessler in empowering our customers, enabling them to achieve their goals and thrive in the ever-evolving market landscape.”\n\nBy joining forces, Paessler and PATLITE are well-positioned to provide organizations across Southeast Asia with a holistic view of their entire infrastructure. This enhanced visibility will enable enterprises to make informed decisions, improve operational efficiency, and unlock new opportunities for growth.\n\nIt is worth noting that Paessler launched its first product extension for PRTG in April this year, catering specifically to customers in the industrial sector who seek valuable information from both IT and OT monitoring displayed in their supervisory and control systems. This product extension exemplifies Paessler’s commitment to bridging the worlds of OT and IT, further reinforcing the company’s dedication to meeting the evolving needs of its customers."
