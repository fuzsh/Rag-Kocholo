You can display the location of probes, groups, and devices in a graphical map on an object's details page, or on PRTG Maps. This feature is especially useful when you monitor networks which are spread over different locations, for example, in various cities of a country or all over the globe.\n\nFor each probe, group, or device, you can enter Location information. PRTG will use the first line of this information to query a geographical map which shows your objects. Your location specification will be resolved to global geographical coordinates by the PRTG core server with the help of an external map service provider.\n\nPRTG will connect to the specified maps provider to get map tiles. These are used to set up the graphical map. Then the defined locations will be marked with the corresponding object icons and their status on the map. You can select your favorite map tiles provider in System Administration—User Interface (setting Geo Maps).\n\nGeographical maps can be displayed on the device tree. PRTG will adjust the zoom of a map automatically such that all locations of a selected object can be displayed. You can also add geographical maps to PRTG Maps. For this concern, go to the PRTG Maps Designer (either in an existing map or creating a new one) and choose the entry Geo Maps from the properties menu on the right.\n\nUsing Geo Maps\n\nIn order to use geographical maps within the PRTG web interface or Enterprise Console, please make sure the following:\n\nIn the system administration (within the web interface), select the maps provider and type you want to view. There, you will also find an option to disable geo maps integration if you do not want to use it. See section System Administration—User Interface (setting Geo Maps) for detailed information.\n\nIn your objects' settings, add a city name, or address, or coordinates in the first line of the Location field. As soon as you view the details of such an object, a geographical map will be shown. The Location information will also be used when viewing objects in the Enterprise Console or when adding Geo Maps objects to PRTG Maps.\n\nMake sure your PRTG core server has access to the internet in order to obtain map tiles. If a proxy is mandatory in your network, please configure proxy settings accordingly. For details, please see System Administration—Core & Probes. For details about tile server domains, please see More section below.\n\nLabeling Locations\n\nYou can define your own labels for locations of objects. For this concern, enter the desired label in the first line of the Location settings and provide the geo coordinates of the location in the second line. In PRTG's geo map, this object will be displayed with the defined label.\n\nThe location New York City will appear with the label Big Apple then:\n\nIt is also possible to define the same label for different locations. For example, imagine your company's headquarter is spread over several different locations. For each object representing a dedicated headquarter in the PRTG device tree, enter its coordinates in the second line of the respective Location settings and the label \"Headquarter\" in the first line. All corresponding objects will be displayed as \"Headquarter\". This way, you can easily find your desired objects on the map.\n\nMap Icon Colors\n\nOn the geographical maps the different location icons will show the overall status at this location by using a color code. Following, all possible location states are listed ordered by their hierarchy:\n\nNote: For detailed information about sensor states, please see Sensor States section.\n\nGeo Tracking of Your Mobile Device\n\nIt is possible to show the location of an Android device and track its movements on PRTG Geo Maps. PRTG can draw the route a device has taken directly into geo maps. For this feature, you need the PRTG Mobile Probe for Android. See section More for details.\n\nMore\n\nKnowledge Base: Which provider should I use for PRTG's \"Geo Maps\" feature?\n\nhttp://kb.paessler.com/en/topic/34603\n\nKnowledge Base: Which domains and ports does the GeoMaps feature use?\n\nhttp://kb.paessler.com/en/topic/35823\n\nKnowledge Base: Why does my street not appear on the Geo Map shown in PRTG?\n\nhttp://kb.paessler.com/en/topic/35653\n\nKnowledge Base: How do I get a Google Maps API key for use in PRTG?\n\nhttp://kb.paessler.com/en/topic/32363\n\nKnowledge Base: Which limitations apply when using the Google Maps API in PRTG?\n\nhttp://kb.paessler.com/en/topic/7913\n\nKnowledge Base: How can I change the way markers look like in PRTG's geo maps?\n\nhttp://kb.paessler.com/en/topic/43153\n\nKnowledge Base: How can I track geo data of my Mobile Probe device?"
