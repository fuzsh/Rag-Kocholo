        "text": "April 19, 2021 - Chicago, IL – Paessler AG, the monitoring experts, is being acknowledged by CRN®, a brand of The Channel Company, in its 2021 Partner Program Guide. This annual guide provides a conclusive list of the most distinguished partner programs from leading technology companies that provide products and services through the IT Channel.\n\nGiven the importance of IT vendor channel programs, each year CRN develops its Partner Program Guide to provide the channel community with a detailed look at the partner programs offered by IT manufacturers, software developers, service companies, and distributors. Vendors are scored based on investments in program offerings, partner profitability, partner training, education and support, marketing programs and resources, sales support, and communication.\n\nPaessler’s partner program was selected because the company created vertical-specific sales training materials for partners to develop sales strategies in education, healthcare, and industrial IT markets, with customizable marketing campaigns for cohesive and integrated approach to reach potential customers in these high-growth markets.
