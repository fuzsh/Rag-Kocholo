        "text": "LogicMonitor is a well known and mature web and application management suite and network monitoring solution that's worked to make its product attractive to those with significant infrastructure assets in the cloud. To do this, it's designed unlike most other agentless systems, in that LogicMonitor is a hybrid Software as a Service (SaaS) system. The interface lives in the cloud, but a lightweight collector lives on your networks, hopefully giving you the best of both worlds. There's a free 14-day trial version is available off the website, but you'll have to jump through some hoops to get it started. That'll be a phone call or two and to understand your pricing will be at least another call as LogicMonitor only prices its product on a customer-by-customer basis. That and its need for a web connection keep it just slightly behind our Editors' Choice winners in this category, Progress WhatsUp Gold and Paessler PRTG Network Monitor. However, those who need to manage infrastructure in multiple places should definitely give LogicMonitor a try.\n\nInstallation and Setup\n\nLike Datadog, LogicMonitor delivers most of its platform as a cloud service, so you'll need to setup an account once you've paid for access. Once your account is set up, installing LogicMonitor is typically a guided process. However, I opted to take the controls to get a better feel of how the underlying engine worked. Once you first log into the account, you’ll need to install collectors on each network segment that you want to monitor. These serve as windows to the world behind your firewall and allow LogicMonitor to sniff out and track your systems. There are two variations of the collector. There's a Windows collector that can cover all types of devices and is what nearly everyone will want when administering a mixed or Microsoft only environment. For those that don’t have to live with Microsoft environments, then the Linux collector is your path.\n\nWhat was particularly interesting about the install process is that it asks you to execute a command line string that automates installing the collector. For Windows, this will be a Linux command. For Linux users, this will be a Bash command. Once you copy and paste it to the appropriate command line, it kicks off installation automatically. For most, this will run without troubles, though I did have a few minor glitches with the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) service after the collector launched. However, after restarting the service, everything worked well.\n\nOnce the collector is installed, LogicMonitor can \"see\" into your network, which means you can proceed to the next part of the online wizard. You can automatically scan, add devices from a list, or add devices individually, which for the most part the same process as the other tools in this roundup. For the initial test, I decided to automatically scan. To do this, LogicMonitor requires that you enter credentials. This could be an SNMP string, Windows credentials, VMware ESXi credentials, and a number of other authentication possibilities. Once you’ve done this, it goes to work finding devices and adding them to the list. Adding individual devices is basically the same process, except you’ll give it an IP address or Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN). If it finds the device, it will add it to the list, and you’ll be good to go.\n\nFor those with lots of virtual infrastructure, VMware ESXi and Microsoft Hyper-V systems are also well supported, though ManageEngine OpManager still has the overall best support for virtual infrastructure of all the tools in the roundup. If you add one of these two hypervisors to your discovery process, LogicMonitor will not only figure out what the virtual machines (VMs) are, but it will intelligently monitor the hypervisor as well. Knowing the current RAM and CPU usage is a hot item when dealing with a large scale VM farm. What’s even better is that no additional add-ons are required. This is significantly better than Nagios XI, which requires you to install a separate plugin for this information.\n\nOnce devices are added, the user interface (UI) is clean and polished. As a rule, dashboards tend to be a bear to set up on other platforms, but LogicMonitor has obviously worked hard on this aspect. The software makes it easy to build your own dashboards by providing well thought out templates that you can clone. Every section can be accessed via a toolbar along the left hand side of the screen. There are a number of ways to visualize your data as well, including not only a hierarchical view of your equipment, but also the ability to build graphical topology maps that help with visualizing your networks and speeding the trip to root cause analysis. While this isn’t automatic yet, a picture is always worth a thousand words, so this capability is something most IT pros would do well to investigate early.\n\nAlerts and Reporting\n\nAlerts are fairly powerful in LogicMonitor, but likely not quite as powerful as some other agentless systems we tested, including both our Editors' Choice winners and even slightly lower-scoring products, like NetCrunch. You have the typical ability to send an alerting email, SMS message, and such, and you can execute web based services, like IFTTT or use an HTTP request if your service is publicly available.\n\nHowever, there isn’t anything to let you execute a behind-the-firewall action directly. That could allow you to apply instant fixes and access systems in a round about way in case of trouble. Overall, we found the alerting abilities to be decent enough, but we'd like to see them expanded, since they're lagging slightly behind much of the field where most products let you execute a wider range of action types.\n\nGathering your alerting and monitoring data into a digestible format is fairly easy. LogicMonitor provides sixteen report types that can be customized to meet your particular business needs. You'll find all the most common output formats, including CSV, PDF, and HTML. Reports can, of course, be run on demand or scheduled and emailed. While not an overt feature, having a SaaS environment means that you won’t have to fool with your own SMTP server. For those averse to fussing with mail server settings, this can be a significant bonus.\n\nIf you're looking to customize LogicMonitor, then there are a few minor hiccups. For one, the LogicMonitor API is more geared toward automation than custom data collection. That said, it does have a fully functional REST API. If you're looking to collect custom data, you can always leverage the scripting portion of the application. It’s also worth mentioning that the supported device database in LogicMonitor is huge and grows on a weekly basis, so you may not even need a custom data scraping script. That said, if you need it, LogicMonitor can get you there, but I think that Nagios XI does this piece better. However, you really can’t get that level of functionality from the SaaS model that LogicMonitor uses, so it’s forgivable.\n\nOverall, LogicMonitor is an excellent tool even if it is slightly behind our Editors' Choice winners. Its SaaS delivery model means its very well positioned for those who have lots of geographically dispersed infrastructure they need to monitor, likely moreso than those tools that rely on the on-premises model. While you can probably find more features and device support in Progress WhatsUp Gold and Paessler PRTG, the SaaS environment that LogicMonitor offers wins the scale game every time."
