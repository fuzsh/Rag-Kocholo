        "text": "Chicago, IL – February 25, 2020 – Paessler AG, the monitoring specialist, announces the launch of PRTG Node-RED-Connector to be presented for the first time at Embedded World Exhibition & Conference 2020 in Nuremberg, Germany on February 25-27. The Node-RED Connector enables PRTG to offer its advanced monitoring capabilities for manufacturing, IIoT and IoT environments.\n\nStarting today, the PRTG Node-RED Connector will be available in BETA to enable all professionals in charge of manufacturing, IIoT or IoT environments to integrate their devices and processes into PRTG Network Monitor. The connector allows users to automatically feed information gathered by the Node-RED Connector into the PRTG Network Monitoring software – opening up the possibility to monitor their IoT and IIoT spaces and bring the results together with their IT infrastructure monitoring if required. Node-RED, developed by IBM’s Emerging Technology Services team, is a flow-based, visual programming tool with a web interface, for connecting IoT and IIoT hardware devices, APIs and online services. Since 2016, Node-RED has become an open-source project. Node-RED can pre-process collected data and gives users comprehensive data analysis while offering them the possibility to forward the data to PRTG using the new PRTG Node-RED Connector – without coding, just based on Node-RED’s user-friendly interface. PRTG, one of the most popular and established IT monitoring solutions, allows the user to define thresholds and escalation levels for alerting, create dashboards and maps by drag and drop, and publish monitoring data in reports. It stores data in the original monitoring interval enabling historic reports based on real, not aggregated, values. Node-RED software enables users to click and drag nodes, link them together and integrate them with the PRTG Network Monitoring software. It features a user-friendly interface allowing integrators without coding skills to easily create a working application within just a few clicks. Benefits of Node-RED:\n\nReduces the time it takes to create a fully functioning application and minimizes the costs\n\n​Is accessible to a wide range of users including those without coding skills, as well as developers who want to save time\n\nHelps users to easily see their application and understand the logic due to the visual nature of the software tool\n\nDirect and easily connect IoT and IIoT specific communication protocols in PRTG\n\nBenefits of PRTG:\n\nMature and established IT monitoring solution with >200,000 users worldwide\n\nOptimized for ease of use\n\nComprehensive monitoring feature set\n\nCustomizable and flexible\n\nSimple licensing and affordable pricing\n\nBrings together IIoT, IoT and IT in one single solution, even in one dashboard\n\nHelmut Binder, Paessler AG CEO said, “The decision to launch the PRTG Node-RED Connector is an important step in the evolution of our PRTG product as well as our business as a whole as we fulfill our ambition of becoming a major player in the development of IoT. By enabling PRTG for monitoring IoT, we bring a game changer into the IoT and IIoT world: a mature and established monitoring solution with more than 20 years of IT monitoring experience that opens a completely new level of monitoring IoT environments. In the upcoming months, we are excited to see what kind of monitoring scenarios new and existing PRTG customers are adding to their installations by utilizing the numerous possibilities of Node-RED.” More information about the PRTG Node-RED Connector is available at www.Paessler.com\n\nAbout Paessler AG\n\nIn 1997 Paessler revolutionized IT monitoring with the introduction of PRTG Network Monitor. Today over 200,000 IT administrators, in more than 170 countries, rely on PRTG to monitor their business-critical systems, devices and network infrastructures. PRTG monitors the entire IT infrastructure 24/7 and helps IT professionals to seamlessly solve problems before they impact users.\n\nOur mission is to empower technical teams to manage their infrastructure, ensuring maximum productivity. We build lasting partnerships and integrative, holistic solutions to achieve this. Thinking beyond IT networks, Paessler is actively developing solutions to support digital transformation strategies and the Internet of Things."
