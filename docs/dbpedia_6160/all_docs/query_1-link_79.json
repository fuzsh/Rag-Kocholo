You can display the location of probes, groups, and devices in a graphical map on the details page of an object, or on PRTG Maps. This feature is especially useful when you monitor networks which are spread over different locations, for example, in various cities of a country or all over the globe.\n\nFor each probe, group, or device, you can enter Location information. PRTG will use the first line of this information to query a geographical map which shows your objects. Your location specification will be resolved to global geographical coordinates by the PRTG core server with the help of an external map service provider.\n\nPRTG will connect to the specified maps provider to get map tiles. These are used to set up the graphical map. Then PRTG marks the defined locations with the corresponding object icons and their status on the map. You can select your favorite map tiles provider in System Administration—User Interface (setting Geo Maps).\n\nYou can display geographical maps on the device tree. PRTG adjusts the zoom of a map automatically so that it can show all locations of a selected object. You can also add geographical maps to PRTG Maps. To do so, open the PRTG Map Designer (either in an existing map or create a new one) and choose the entry Geo Maps from the properties menu on the right.\n\nUsing Geo Maps\n\nTo use geographical maps within the PRTG web interface or Enterprise Console, please ensure the following:\n\nIn the system administration in the PRTG web interface, select the maps provider and type you want to view. There, you will also find an option to disable geo maps integration if you do not want to use it. See section System Administration—User Interface (setting Geo Maps) for detailed information.\n\nIn the settings of a monitoring object (probe, group, device), add a city name, or address, or coordinates in the first line of the Location field. When you view the details of this object, PRTG will show a geographical map. PRTG uses the Location information also when you view objects in the Enterprise Console or add Geo Maps objects to PRTG Maps.\n\nMake sure your PRTG core server has access to the internet to obtain map tiles. If a proxy is mandatory in your network, configure proxy settings accordingly. For details, please see System Administration—Core & Probes. For details about tile server domains, please see the More section below.\n\nLabeling Locations\n\nYou can define your own labels for locations of objects. To do so, enter the desired label in the first line of the Location settings and provide the geo coordinates of the location in the second line. This object will appear with the defined label in PRTG geo maps.\n\nFor example, add the following to the location field:\n\nBig Apple\n\n40.712778,-74.005833\n\nThe location New York City appears the with the label Big Apple:\n\nIt is also possible to define the same label for different locations. For example, imagine your company's headquarter is spread over several different locations. For each object representing a dedicated headquarter in the PRTG device tree, enter its coordinates in the second line of the respective Location settings and the label \"Headquarter\" in the first line. All corresponding objects will be displayed as \"Headquarter\". This way, you can easily find your desired objects on the map.\n\nMap Icon Colors\n\nOn the geographical maps the different location icons show the overall status at this location by using a color code. Following, you can see all possible location states in order of their hierarchy:\n\nNote: For detailed information about sensor states, please see the section Sensor States.\n\nGeo Tracking of Your Mobile Device\n\nIt is possible to show the location of an Android device and track its movements on PRTG Geo Maps. PRTG can draw the route a device has taken directly into geo maps. For this feature, you need the PRTG Mobile Probe for Android. See section More for details.\n\nMore\n\nKnowledge Base: Which provider should I use for PRTG's \"Geo Maps\" feature?\n\nhttp://kb.paessler.com/en/topic/34603\n\nKnowledge Base: Which domains and ports does the GeoMaps feature use?\n\nhttp://kb.paessler.com/en/topic/35823\n\nKnowledge Base: Why does my street not appear on the Geo Map shown in PRTG?\n\nhttp://kb.paessler.com/en/topic/35653\n\nKnowledge Base: How do I get a Google Maps API key for use in PRTG?\n\nhttp://kb.paessler.com/en/topic/32363\n\nKnowledge Base: Which limitations apply when using the Google Maps API in PRTG?\n\nhttp://kb.paessler.com/en/topic/7913\n\nKnowledge Base: How can I change the way markers look like in PRTG's geo maps?\n\nhttp://kb.paessler.com/en/topic/43153\n\nKnowledge Base: How can I track geo data of my Mobile Probe device?\n\nhttp://kb.paessler.com/en/topic/59647\n\nKnowledge Base: My geo maps are displayed without background.
