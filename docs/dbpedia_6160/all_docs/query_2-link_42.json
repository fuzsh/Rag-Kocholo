        "text": "Agencies\n\nUpdated On Jun 27, 2023 at 08:16 AM IST\n\nRead by: 100 Industry Professionals\n\nRead by 100 Industry Professionals\n\nSingapore, 27 June 2023 –A clear disconnect exists between sustainability practices and Digital Transformation initiatives across organisations in Singapore, according to a latest report by Paessler, the monitoring experts for IT infrastructures and networks. Titled Keeping Watch: Monitoring Your Path to a Sustainable IT, the report aims to shed light on the current state of sustainability practices among businesses, and deep dives into drivers and barriers in deploying sustainable IT practices. The report revealed that balancing the ESG metrics with growth targets (65%), cost of deployment to business (43%), lack of clarity from government bodies (48%) and lack of measuring ROI (53%) as the top barriers to adopting sustainability practices in Singapore.\n\nAdvt\n\nWhile most businesses across ASEAN and ANZ region are optimistic about the business outlook over the next three years, businesses in Singapore are most conservative with 23% being unsure or pessimistic about their business outlook. The report revealed businesses in Singapore view sustainability and digital transformation in silos and not as intertwined. Organisations are working on developing sustainability frameworks and digital transformation strategies in a piecemeal manner. As a result, their resources, whether budgets, time or skills involved, are less effective. They also lack the capabilities and the expertise to develop a sustainability framework and work on it, clearly highlighting a disconnect between the engaged sustainability practices and their digital transformation journeys.\n\nAt the same time, organisations in Singapore are realising the benefits of IT infrastructure monitoring, a key cog in an organisation’s IT strategy to help optimise energy consumption (81%), reduce emissions (95%), analyse the need for IT equipment (95%) and to quantify the volume of resources saved (81%). Therefore, a sustainable IT strategy backed by a comprehensive monitoring framework must be a vital part of the business operations. This will ensure sourcing material; production processes and all other components of a sustainable business can be integrated by the overarching digital transformation strategy.\n\nAdvt\n\nWith Singapore’s GDP growth forecast for 2023 expected to rise by 0.5 to 2.5 %, businesses are focusing on digital transformation, sustainability and increasing productivity and efficiency as high priority areas to be better positioned as the global economy slows. “Many businesses see sustainability and profitability as a contradiction, but when the right values are measured, it results in cost efficiency and a competitive lead. It is imperative to build a robust IT strategy, a digital transformation strategy and develop a sustainability framework which are all integrated by a comprehensive IT monitoring framework. Bridging the gap between digital transformation and sustainability to make data-based decisions can result in resource optimisation and bring economic benefits for businesses,” said Felix Berndt, Regional Sales Manager of Asia Pacific, Paessler.\n\nSustainability practices (ESG) and Digital Transformation efforts not on the same page\n\nWhile sustainability is one of the top 3 business priorities for the next three years, it does not even feature as one of the top 5 challenges for businesses across markets and sectors. Instead, challenges such as increasing competition, digital transformation, driving growth (top line), improving profitability (bottom line), and talent management are seen as top five challenges by businesses. The top three drivers for adopting sustainable frameworks are reputation (45%), following industry operations standards (36%) and adhering to Regulatory framework and compliance (24%).\n\nThe technology, telecom, and datacenter vertical (82%) was seen as the top vertical which already has a sustainable IT strategy in place followed by manufacturing (79%) and essential services/ public sector (66%). While the public sector lags in this regard, 31% said that they will embark on their sustainable IT strategy journey in the next year.\n\nDigital transformation can enable sustainability by making businesses more efficient, reducing their environmental impact, and helping them meet sustainability goals. Engaging the right digital technologies can help monitor and optimize energy usage, reduce waste, and streamline supply chains. The knowledge and importance of a sustainable IT strategy can be improved if backed by an effective IT monitoring backbone.\n\nPaessler’s Keeping Watch: Monitoring Your Path to a Sustainable IT report was conducted by Intuit Research from Dec 2022 to March 2023, to understand the current state of sustainability practices among businesses, and deep dive into drivers and barriers in deploying sustainability IT practices. Key business decision makers of large businesses (with revenue of USD 50 million to over USD 1 billion) were interviewed in six countries, namely, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand. Opinion was gathered from senior business decision makers across three key sectors - Manufacturing, Essential Services, and Tech / Telecom / Data centers.\n\nJoin the largest community of IT industry professionals in Southeast Asia\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.\n\nGet updates on your preferred social platform\n\nFollow us for the latest news, insider access to events and more."
