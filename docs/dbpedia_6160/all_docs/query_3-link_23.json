        "text": "The digital transformation of business is generating a lot of value, through more automation, more intelligence, and ultimately more efficiency.\n\nThis same transformation, however, also brings with it new challenges, with exponentially more systems to maintain, services to ensure, and pressure to deliver increased productivity, profitability and competitive power.\n\nWithout question, there are more “moving parts” than ever as the physical and digital worlds intersect, and two companies recently joined forces to get out in front - improving workflows for the modern, millennial workforce.\n\nBriefery, a company based in Israel but working globally, provides an intuitive solution for building workflow automation applications, with minimal or no required coding. Their application is delivered as a service, is designed for easy customization and runs on mobile, desktop, in the cloud and on-premise.\n\n“Our app offers a structured way to manage departments’ workflows like checklists, problem tickets, and more,” said David Ackerman, founder of the company. “We designed our platform with our customers early on, and their input helped us ensure we were accommodating for not only the basics, but also for enforcing corporate policies, safety and regulation reviews, project management, and compliance, including identifying and acting on events that require special attention in real time.”\n\nMost recently, Briefery completed an integration with Paessler, a company founded in 1997, headquartered in the metropolitan region of Nuremberg, Germany, with more than 200,000 customers in more than 170 countries.\n\nBriefery integrated with Paessler’s flagship product PRTG Network Monitor, a monitoring solution that helps IT professionals observe and manage their IT infrastructures.\n\nPRTG monitors everything in enterprise and business infrastructure, including LANs, WANs, servers, websites and applications, with visibility into cloud services, packet behavior, network traffic patterns, and applications, with features including uptime measurement, ping status, active directory integration, and environmental conditions.\n\nBriefery’s integration is focused on setting up, automating and documenting routine workflows, to make life easier for IT and OT teams responsible for keeping infrastructure in top shape.\n\nThe Briefery solution is based on the mobile-first approach. Briefery can be fully configured and operated using just a mobile device. The mobile-first approach allows the building and the configurations to be made within the business user’s own environment and on their mobile device.\n\n“With our app, there is no need for a meeting at the office using a desktop PC or the need for a developer to make changes, as changes are visible immediately after they are made, on the fly and on the used mobile device,” Ackerman said. “This mobile approach forces a simple, intuitive, and easily configurable application. Typically, you can get your initial workflow up and running within 30 minutes.”\n\nBriefery Features included in the integration include:\n\nInstant mobile app builder\n\nDocument, checklist, and workflow builder\n\nUnlimited number of documents and workflows\n\nUnlimited permission profiles\n\nSpaces for group’ or department’s automation of workflows\n\nNotification according to progress in workflows\n\nFlag/Task every document line for further action\n\nIn-flow chat\n\nUser and flow labels\n\nEmail integration\n\nPDF and CSV/Excel reporting\n\nWeb version\n\nSoftware integration (CRM, ERP - option)\n\nAs enterprise IoT grows, more and more companies are implementing IoT, which Paessler is actively supporting. The Briefery solution is part of this.\n\nThe integration itself involved connecting Briefery with Paessler’s PRTG Network Monitor, allowing PRTG to automatically trigger new workflows in Briefery, send notifications, assign tickets to technicians, track tickets, and escalate if needed.\n\nPRTG detects faults when they occur or even before they occur, using its threshold settings. It sends an alert for any issue found. Then the issue needs to be assigned to a technician for repair. In many instances, this will just require going to the location of the problem to carry out the work. Alternatively the technician might need more information from the end user, or need to wait for parts.\n\nBriefery enables processes to be automated by providing a structured method of notifying the technician, getting their acknowledgment, recording their time of arrival at the site and the time to repair the fault, and recording any deviation from the process like asking for more information from the end user. It also allows the data to be exported to PDF or Excel, and BI on the data collected.\n\nMore detailed information is available on this blog on the Paessler website.\n\nEdited by Ken Briodagh"
