        "text": "PropertyGuru Malaysia released its biannual Consumer Sentiment Study for H2 2022, which found that potential homebuyers are facing affordability issues in their homeownership journey, with 51% of respondents understanding that they are not qualified for government affordable housing schemes, and are not able to purchase property without financial assistance.\n\nWith the overnight policy rate (OPR) increase by 25 basis points in July, on top of the consumer price index (CPI) rising to an ultimate high of 4.4% year-on-year, potential homebuyers may continue to face affordability issues amid concerns over the ongoing global recession and inflation rates.\n\nThis was evident in the Consumer Sentiment Study for H2 2022 (CSS H2 2022), as about half of the respondents surveyed stated that they do not qualify for government housing schemes and may not be able to afford to purchase a property without assistance.\n\nIn the study, 73% of the respondents have a clear understanding of eligibility terms for affordable housing, indicating that potential homebuyers will continue to be on the lookout for other government housing initiatives to aid their homeownership journeys.\n\nPropertyGuru Malaysia Country Manager Sheldon Fernandez said, “As seen in the Consumer Sentiment Study H2 2022, our consumers have a sound awareness of government initiatives and eligibility for affordable housing. With the ongoing recession, inflation, price hikes, and OPR increase, we expect potential homebuyers to continue the wait-and-see approach until the overall cost of living has stabilised.\n\nWith the Budget 2023 announcement coming up soon, we are hopeful that there will be allocations that can help spur the property market and aid those that are planning to embark on their homeownership journey. The CSS H2 2022 has also indicated that more than 69% of those surveyed plan to buy a house if the Home Ownership Campaign is revived.”\n\nEmerging Technology Will Continue to Change Large Purchasing Behaviours in Consumers\n\nThe previous Consumer Sentiment Study in H1 2022 recorded that 2 in 3 Malaysians would be comfortable with shortlisting and viewing properties online, while 1 in 4 would be comfortable signing agreements online. This signals that consumers have become more tech-savvy following the reliance on digital transactions during the pandemic.\n\nThis trend continues in the latest CSS H2 2022, as over half of the respondents in the study see that emerging technologies such as AI, property aggregation platforms, and digital housing societies would be helpful in their homeownership journey.\n\nThis indicates that technology will continue to play a major role in the property market, and a demand for digital accessibility to property-related decisions will likely continue in the coming years.\n\n“As a leading proptech company, these findings have proven that providing a platform which can help to guide consumers in making informed property decisions is a crucial part of a homebuyers’ journey. The way that consumers digest information and make transactions is evolving, which is why we strive to be an innovative platform that can help potential homebuyers achieve their goals as conveniently and with as much guidance as possible. In addition, through the survey, we found that potential homebuyers have also started to consider purchasing property in the metaverse.\n\n“This trend is likely to continue as consumers in Malaysia have adapted well to digital solutions and platforms more than ever over the past two years. We are interested to see how emerging technologies will change and evolve in the industry in the coming years,” said Sheldon.\n\nEnvironmental Impact Has Changed the Way Potential Homebuyers View Locations\n\nAs several areas across Malaysia have been struck with flash floods and landslides in the past year, the study also indicated that homebuyers are concerned with how this will impact properties in the long run. 92% of the respondents in the study had highlighted flooding as their main concern, while 83% were concerned about landslides.\n\nWith environmental consciousness recording an upward trend, consumers are now looking at sustainable homes and features as key considerations when purchasing a home.\n\nAdditionally, according to the CSS H2 2022, respondents noted that solar panels, rainwater harvesting, and food waste composting are important features to have in the future. On top of this, 1 in 3 of respondents in the higher income group is keen to pay more for a property with Electric Vehicle (EV)-charging ports.\n\n“While location has always been one of the key considerations for home seekers in Malaysia, we will now see more people increasingly prioritise this due to the flooding events in the past year. The higher awareness of eco-friendly facilities and features is likely linked to ongoing climate change issues as well. Consumers are now more conscious of current issues and are now making eco-friendly decisions in hopes of making a change.\n\nWith many losing and damaging their homes in the past year, it is evident that these natural disasters have made a lasting impact, as in the CSS H2 2022, 66% of the respondents said they are willing to pay a higher insurance premium on their property for climate change effects as nobody foresees their home being struck by a flood or any natural disaster”, concluded Sheldon.\n\nWith the continued uptick in the adoption of mobile banking in Asia Pacific (APAC), global cybersecurity company Kaspersky warns of more attacks against Android and iOS devices. Particularly, active monitoring shows the notorious Anubis Trojan now delivers a combination of mobile banking Trojan with ransomware functionalities to its target smartphones.\n\nKaspersky elite researcher – Suguru Ishimaru – zeroed in on the mobile threat landscape in APAC to answer: what if there are no smartphones? Sharing the reality that users cannot live without a mobile device, he unmasks the latest malware targeting iOS and Android users in APAC during the company’s 8th Cyber Security Weekend in Phuket, Thailand.\n\nMobile banking Trojans are one of the most dangerous species in the malware world. This type of threat steals money from mobile users’ bank accounts usually by disguising the Trojans as legitimate apps to lure people into installing the malware.\n\nAnubis is a mobile banking Trojan targeting Android users as early as 2017. Its worldwide campaigns targeted users from Russia, Turkey, India, China, Colombia, France, Germany, the US, Denmark, and Vietnam.\n\nThis malware family continues to be one of the most common mobile bankers, according to Kaspersky’s latest mobile statistics in the second quarter of 2022. In this period, one in 10 (10.48%) of unique Kaspersky users globally who encountered a banking threat has encountered Anubis mobile banking Trojan.\n\nInitial infections are done through multiple ways – legitimate-looking and high-ranking but malicious apps available on Google Play, smishing (phishing messages sent through SMS), and Bian malware, another mobile banking Trojan.\n\nOnce in, this infamous mobile banker can do a complete device takeover. It can steal personal information and identity, access private messages and login credentials, record sound, request GPS, disable play protect, lock the device’s screen, and more.\n\n“Anubis is known for compromising hundreds of bank customers per campaign, proving that it’s among the most active malware targeting Android users right now. Our recent findings show that the cybercriminals behind this threat have started implementing ransom functionalities. If this modification proves to be successful, chances are other malicious groups will copy the same technique of stealing data and holding devices hostage. As a result, I expect to see more of such attacks in APAC due to cybercriminals’ strong financial motivation,” says Suguru Ishimaru, Senior Malware Researcher for Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) at Kaspersky.\n\nThe threat against Android and iOS users: Roaming Mantis\n\nAnother prolific threat actor targeting mobile banking users, globally and in the APAC region, is Roaming Mantis. The group carries out malicious campaigns that target Android devices and spreads mobile malware initially via DNS hijacking and currently through smishing.\n\nKaspersky experts have been tracking its operations since 2018 and detected almost half a million attacks in APAC from 2021 to the first half of 2022. Most numbers of the malware were blocked from infecting Kaspersky users in Russia, Japan, South Korea, India, and China.\n\nIshimaru also underlined that while the cybercriminal group is known for targeting Android devices, Roaming Mantis’ recent campaign showed interest in iOS users.\n\nUsing the same techniques, the smishing messages targeting iOS users contain a very short description and a URL to a landing page. If a user clicks on the link and opens the landing page, there are two scenarios: iOS users are redirected to a phishing page imitating the official Apple website, while the Wroba malware is downloaded on Android devices.\n\nIf a victim inputs his credentials to the phishing website, it will then proceed to the 2FA (two-factor authentication) phishing website. This allows the attacker to know the user’s device, credentials, and 2FA codes.\n\n“There is a notion that iOS is a more secure operating system. However, we must take two things into account – the increasing sophistication of mobile bankers’ social engineering techniques and malware arsenal and the possibility for human errors. Remember that both Anubis and Roaming Mantis require user’s participation before they can take over a device. With more than half (63%) of digital payments in APAC doing their financial transactions online through mobile devices, awareness is no longer enough. Protecting our smartphones is a step that everyone should be doing by now,” adds Ishimaru.\n\nKaspersky expert suggests two layers of protection for smartphones\n\nBasic security\n\nKeep phones up-to-date and install the latest patches\n\nReboot daily\n\nDo NOT trust third-party apps and mobileconfig\n\nNEVER click on links sent through SMS\n\nInstall a security solution like Kaspersky Total Security\n\nAdvanced protection\n\nUse a VPN to mask your traffic\n\nCheck live network traffic using live Indicator of Compromise (IOCs)\n\nUse Lockdown Mode for iOS 16 users\n\nEconomic ministers from the United States and 13 Indo-Pacific countries launch negotiations on Thursday on Washington’s first major pan-Asian trade engagement effort in nearly a decade, but this time any deal won’t cut tariffs.\n\nThe Indo-Pacific Economic Framework talks in Los Angeles will seek to define a sweeping platform for market-driven economies to engage on trade and data flows, environmental and labour standards, supply chains and anti-corruption efforts.\n\nReuters cited the negotiations will be led by US Trade Representative Katherine Tai and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. President Joe Biden launched the Indo-Pacific initiative in May during a trip to Tokyo, but some critics questioned its value to participating countries.\n\nNot TPP 2.0\n\nWashington has lacked an economic pillar to its Indo-Pacific engagement since former president Donald Trump quit the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal (TPP) in 2017, leaving the field open to China to expand its regional influence.\n\nMore than two years of TPP negotiations led to an agreement in 2015, but the US Congress failed to ratify it as tariff-cutting free trade deals fell out of favour, blamed for draining jobs and investment to low-wage countries.\n\nBiden’s trade chief Tai also has shunned new trade deals, focusing a number of negotiations with the European Union instead on labour, regulation and other non-tariff issues.\n\nThe talks will include ministers from Australia, Brunei, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Together with the United States the participants represent some 40 per cent of global GDP.\n\nBut it was unclear whether all of the countries would participate in all four of the negotiation streams: trade, labour and digital standards; clean energy and decarbonization; supply chain resilience; and tax and anti-corruption efforts. To secure broad participation, the countries could choose among those “pillars.” The talks come as the China-led Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Free trade deal launched in January, cutting tariffs for many of the IPEF participants. The surviving TPP countries also have launched a limited trade pact.\n\nA senior Biden administration official told reporters on Wednesday that the IPEF platform was not meant as an alternative to trading with China.\n\n“This initiative is really about the US having an affirmative economic agenda in the region,” the official said. “It’s about engaging the economies in the Indo-Pacific in their own right, this isn’t not a choice between the United States and China.” Lori Wallach, head of Rethink Trade, a group advocating against corporate influence in trade policy, applauded the decision not to offer tariff cuts, but questioned whether it could deliver benefits for workers.\n\n“Three decades of ‘hyperglobalisation’ implemented by these deals already had made the old trade model politically toxic,” Wallach said in a statement. “Then the Covid-revealed supply chain crisis fuelled even broader demand for a new approach that reverses the concentration of production of goods and services on which we all rely in too firms in too few countries.”\n\nSelected for its well-defined corporate business strategy and its progressive culture of innovation within the work force\n\nThe LBS Bina Group Berhad (LBS) has been named as a recipient of the “Best Managed Companies 2022 (Malaysia)” by leading global consulting firm Deloitte.\n\nThe Award was conferred by the CEO of Deloitte SEA, Philip Yuen to the Group Managing Director and CEO of LBS Bina Group Berhad, Datuk Wira Joey Lim Hock Guan at an awards ceremony held at the Sunway Resort Hotel last night.\n\nJoey Lim said: “We are indeed honoured and grateful to receive this prestigious award from Deloitte. As a People’s Developer, our focus has always been about the people. Firstly, to house most Malaysians and to bring value to communities. We couldn’t have done it without the amazing people within LBS. This recognition is a timely inspiration for us to continue to be the best, and to keep progressing. That’s LBS!’\n\nDeloitte’s Best Managed Companies award is a leading business awards programme that has been hosted in more than 37 countries since 1993. It recognises top privately-owned local companies (including listed entities with majority shares held privately) for their organisational excellence and contributions to the economy.\n\nLBS Executive Director Dato’ Cynthia Lim, on the award, said: “Today, 70% of the workforce in LBS is aged 40 years and below. We recognise that our workforce is made up of multigeneration and each of them has its own ideology and mindset. Thus, it is crucial for us to understand the dynamics of a multigenerational workforce and work towards narrowing the gap by encouraging discussions and introducing a variety of platforms to speak their mind because no idea is a bad idea. Transparency is equally vital in bridging the gap, be it for the company or our employees” during the Building Culture and Commitment panel session as one of the panellists at the award night on.\n\nJudged by an independent panel of business and academia representatives, LBS was selected for its well-defined corporate business strategy and its progressive culture of innovation within the work force.\n\nTo add on, the judges were impressed by LBS’ steady performance despite the challenging environment and commitment towards board independence, CSR as well as sustainability reporting. There was an air of optimism as the judges look forward towards seeing LBS’ continued growth in the coming years.\n\nOn the award, Joey Lim said, “I am extremely humbled to have received this accolade on behalf of LBS. We wish to thank the esteemed judges and Deloitte for this award. We were up against an exceptional field of companies in Malaysia and to be selected is indeed testament of the Group’s efforts throughout the years. LBS’ commitment towards ESG, CSR and digitalisation is an indication of our willingness to adapt to the ever-changing environment.\n\n“We recognise the need to remain agile and relevant as we continue our growth story. The success of LBS is tied closely to the adoption of the right business strategies and hard work. Nevertheless, we are aware there is a lot more to be done and we are excited for LBS’ future in the coming years.”\n\nLBS Bina Group Berhad is an internationally recognised developer with a vision for building and inspiring delightful spaces, is a renowned township developer that has amassed numerous awards through their various developments.\n\nThe ebb and flow of markets are one of the great wonders of the universe.\n\nEncapsulating far more human emotion than actual economics, and that is the challenge, the fun of it all.\n\nEven as a bear on stocks, I am tempted to be a buyer on the day. A quick reversal plan, of course, is always at hand.\n\nMarkets have simply priced in about as much downside as they can for the moment.\n\nThere are still upside arguments, but they mostly rested around “well, things always go up, right?” Not a plan.\n\nFor the moment, it appears the recent downward swing of the pendulum may have reached its zenith. We will gain clues as to the extent of the next down-swing, by the nature, character and strength we see evolve, in this now just starting upswing.\n\nThe hidden pendulum is more of a timing thing than price, though the price is most certainly involved. Given, that I still see a bigger down-trend for an abundance of fundamental reasons, my expectation is for five to seven trading days of slightly higher, but mostly sideways price action around current levels.\n\nThe market certainly has the potential for a price upswing, given the Oil price is now falling away post that OPEC meeting.\n\nIt also helps stock prices in the USA, which the US Trade Deficit diminished markedly yesterday. The problem with the still concerning trade deficit nonetheless, is that it incorporates high natural gas exports in support of Europe. This means sustained higher gas prices in the US domestically.\n\nOf most concern in yesterday’s trade numbers though, is that imports dropped a rather scary 2.9%. This suggests domestic demand in general may be starting to drop away, and that this drop could become alarming. A sign of inflation beginning to crimp consumer and business behaviour alike.\n\nThe bulls will be keen to recognise yet another great bottom hope, as they have all year numerous times. Eventually, they will be right in a short-term sense. On this occasion, I expect the reaction pendulum bounce to be somewhat more muted than in the previous huge rally that we saw. Remember that was based on what we always said was total nonsense of hopes of a Fed pause, or even ‘pivot’.\n\nThe global economy is slowing. We have not seen the bottom of this powerful economic correction yet, and therefore we do not know how severe the general economic climate may become.\n\nOn a medium to long-term basis, stocks have plenty of downsides still to travel.\n\nMarket insights and analysis from Clifford Bennett, Chief Economist at ACY Securities\n\nThe building materials cost index (BCI) (without steel bars & with steel bars) for all building categories in Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak increased between 0.2 to 22.0 per cent in August 2022 as compared to a year ago.\n\nFor the same period, the increase in BCI for Peninsular Malaysia was between 5.5 and 18.0 per cent, Sabah between 0.2 and 15.3 per cent and Sarawak between 5.4 and 22.0 per cent.\n\nIn a release by the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM) today entitled ‘Special Release 2 (For Building and Structural Works) August 2022,’ figures show an annual comparison for the period of August 2022 as compared to a year ago showed an increase in BCI with steel bars for all areas in Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak.\n\nThe category of buildings that recorded the highest increase in Peninsular Malaysia was 5 Storey and Above (Reinforced Concrete) Building (For Office) in Selangor, W.P. Kuala Lumpur, Melaka & Negeri Sembilan.\n\nThe building category that recorded the highest increase in Sabah was Reinforced Concrete Piling in Sandakan and Single Storey Steel Frame in Miri Sarawak.\n\nBCI without steel bars increased between 5.5 and 12.4 per cent for all building categories in Peninsular Malaysia.\n\nThe building category that recorded the highest increase was 5 Storey and Above (Reinforced Concrete) Building (For Office) for Peninsular Malaysia. The building category that recorded the highest increase in Sabah was Single Storey Steel Frame (Towers only) in Sandakan. Meanwhile, the highest BCI without steel bars in Sarawak is Single Storey Steel Frame (Building) in Miri.\n\nThe unit price index of building materials increased between 5.0 per cent to 13.3 per cent for August 2022 as compared to a year ago. The price index per unit of steel and steel & metal sections increased by 12.9 per cent and 11.4 per cent respectively in August 2022 as compared to August 2021.\n\nA monthly comparison by construction materials and selected areas, showed decrease in the unit price index of iron of all areas in the Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak.\n\nThe decrease in unit price index for steel and metal sections ranged from 0.2 to 3.4 per cent for almost all areas in the Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak.\n\nHowever, other building materials in some areas remained unchanged such as aggregates for all areas in Peninsular Malaysia except in Johor; ready mix concrete for all areas in Sabah and sand in Kuching & Miri, Sarawak.\n\nMeanwhile, average unit price of steel bar consisting of mild steel round bars and Mycon 60 high tensile deformed bars increased 9.8 per cent to record an average price of steel bar RM3,778.71 per metric tonnes as compared to the previous year (August 2021: RM3,440.91 per metric tonnes). Meanwhile, cement recorded an increase of 11.2 per cent, RM20.95/50 kg (August 2022) as compared to RM18.85/50 kg (August 2021). However, the increase in prices for these two materials was slower than the previous month.\n\nThe 7th International Palm Oil Sustainability Conference 2022 (IPOSC 2022) will be an important platform for Malaysia to counter smear campaigns by Western vested groups against our golden commodity.\n\nThe bi-annual conference to be held on Sept 13 under the theme being “Shifting Sustainability Compliance into Sustainability Stewardship,” will see top experts share their views on the recent developments and possible solutions on the current sustainability concerns and challenges.\n\nConvened since 2008, the conference will be held in Kuala Lumpur this year, after the last one was held online in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The event is also part of MPIC’s aggressive efforts to counter misinformation and false information on Malaysia’s golden oil via “The Global Movement to Champion the Goodness of Palm Oil” campaign.\n\nIPOSC 2022 is intended as a targeted platform to update the stakeholders on pertinent and emerging sustainability developments in the industry. There is a crucial need to continue engaging and update the Malaysian palm oil industry, as well as global stakeholders on sustainability concerns.\n\nThis includes Net Carbon Zero and decarbonisation efforts, green financing and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) opportunities, as well as international deforestation-linked legislations, which will impact commodities like palm oil.\n\nThe Malaysian palm oil industry has been at the forefront of sustainability initiatives, which include sustainability certifications, sustainability reporting and ESG governance. Malaysia would like to continue positioning its palm oil industry as a leader in sustainability and ESG engagements.\n\nIn a statement released by the Ministry of Plantation Industries and Commodities today, it identified the topics to be discussed at the IPOSC 2022 include the Net Zero and Decarbonisation Opportunities in the Palm Oil Industry Opportunities and constraints in the palm oil industry to achieve Net Zero and decarbonisation efforts, in line with the global commitment to achieve carbon neutrality as early as 2050.\n\nMinister Datuk Zuraida Kamaruddin said: “Global Sustainability Trade Barriers and Accelerators Sustainability initiatives in the financial, consumer and biofuels sectors, which include the roles of Green Financing, ESG investments and low-ILUC (Indirect Land Use Change) risk biofuels certifications.\n\n“The Impacts of Deforestation-linked Legislations on the Palm Oil Industry Potential implication of new regulations in developed countries to curb the use and imports of deforestation-linked commodities, and the role of the revised the Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) in addressing these concerns.”\n\nStudies have consistently shown that palm oil is more ecologically friendly compared with other oil crops. For example, palm oil is a more efficient carbon sink and uses less fertilisers. It also produces more oil per hectare compared with rapeseed, soybean and sunflower.\n\nZuraida added the MPIC is hopeful that the conference will help Malaysia stamp its mark as a global leader in sustainable management of the palm oil industry. This will help refute baseless allegations from the West that our palm oil industry has caused untold damage to the ecology.\n\nYB DATUK HAJAH ZURAIDA KAMARUDDIN\n\nMINISTER OF PLANTATION INDUSTRIES AND COMMODITIES\n\nFind your specialty\n\nYou must first decide which specialised area of your industry you want to focus on, as this will help you find your place as an influencer in your field. To accomplish this, consider your passions and strengths, as choosing a niche that aligns with those areas allows you to showcase and hone your skills.\n\nChoose your social media platforms carefully\n\nIt is critical to select the social media platforms that best fit your niche and targeted audience in order to grow your following. Determine your target audience, research which platforms they prefer, and then use those platforms. You should also consider which platforms other influencers in your industry use the most frequently, as this can point you in the right direction for building a relevant audience.\n\nCreate a content strategy\n\nTo establish a presence as an influencer, you must provide high-quality, relevant content to your target audience that demonstrates your expertise and value. You must decide on the formats for your content and how you will distribute it across your social media platforms.\n\nBuild and maintain a website\n\nPeople will most likely search for you online as you gain popularity. Having your own website can serve as a central location that informs your audience about you and serves as a resource for other content.\n\nMaintain consistency\n\nAside from publishing high-quality content, make sure you’re doing so on a regular basis to keep your audience engaged. Your followers should be able to rely on you for regular updates and posts; if you are inactive, they may unfollow you or forget about you entirely.\n\nHave your say\n\nTo differentiate yourself from the thousands of other articles, posts, and other types of content available, you must share your own thoughts, even if they differ from what everyone else in your industry is sharing. People may be more drawn to and loyal to distinctive, authentic voices rather than those who simply repeat popular talking points.\n\nEngage your audience\n\nWhen expanding your audience, it’s critical to interact with them directly because doing so will make them feel valued and, as a result, more likely to continue supporting you. You can accomplish this by responding to or acknowledging comments, responding to direct messages, and, if possible, sharing content from or highlighting specific members of your audience.\n\nExpand your network\n\nForming relationships with other influencers in your industry can help you grow your audience as you establish yourself as an influencer. To build a rapport with influencers online, interact with their content on a regular basis by commenting and sharing. They may eventually share your content, leading their audience to your profiles and encouraging them to follow you.\n\nAssess and monitor your progress\n\nMost social media platforms provide insights and analytics on your performance, such as audience demographics, content reach, and engagement rates. You’ll want to keep an eye on this data as you start your influencer journey because it shows you how quickly you’re building an audience.\n\nKeep up with the latest trends\n\nAs an influencer, your audience expects you to keep them up to date on industry news, trends, and other pertinent information. You can accomplish this by following industry news sources, thought leaders, and other experts and sharing their perspectives with your audience.\n\nAs the Philippines is gearing to be the next hyperscaler hub in the Asia-Pacific region, many opportunities for investments and partnerships await the hyperscaler and data center firms who want to invest in the country, especially from the companies in Hong Kong and China.\n\nThe promising prospect and competitive advantage of the Philippines as the next investment destination for the hyperscaler and data center industry were highlighted during a webinar held by the Board of Investments (BOI), through its International Investments Promotions Service (IIPS), and the Philippine Trade and Investment Center in Hong Kong on August 24, 2022.\n\nIn the event, Trade Secretary Alfredo E. Pascual underscored that the Philippines is ready to be the next hyperscaler hub in the Asia Pacific. “We believe that the hyperscalers industry will be the next growth engine of the Philippines. We are keen on helping hyperscalers cloud services and start-up ecosystem in the Philippines,” he said.\n\n“We hope that you find these opportunities as promising as we do with your trust and passion. Let us make hyperscaler investments and partnerships happen in the Philippines,” Secretary Pascual emphasized.\n\nAlso, Mr. Victor Aliwalas, VP and Technology Management Advisor of the PLDT Enterprise, shared his thoughts about the Philippine data center market. According to him, the country\n\nis ripe for digital and bullish growth prospects. In 2022, the Philippines is expected to lead the technology spending growth in Asia, ahead of Vietnam and Malaysia. Mr. Aliwalas also highlighted the Jupiter Cable System, the newest trans-Pacific cable facility connecting the Philippines to the USA and Japan. With a network distance of 14,866 kilometers, it is the fastest cable system between the Philippines and the US with 126ms latency between Daet, Camarines Norte, and Los Angeles, California.\n\nOther officials who pitched for the country’s standing as the next hyperscaler hub was Consul General in Hong Kong Raly L. Tejada, who highlighted the growing data center capability of the Philippines. While Undersecretary Rafaelita M. Aldaba of the DTI – Competitiveness and Innovation Group presented the value proposition of the Philippines for the hyperscalers as well as the numerous government initiatives for the firms.\n\nAccording to Undersecretary Aldaba, the Philippines has a thriving digital economy landscape with strong macroeconomic fundamentals that will continue to attract positive investment prospects. Also, she mentioned that the Philippines is an early adapter of 5G technology in the Asia Pacific, according to Moody’s, along with Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia.\n\nUndersecretary Aldaba also pointed out that the Philippines has a “demographic sweet spot” because of its rich talent pool of 46.5 million workforces, and the country is producing an average of 750,000 graduates annually. With the amended PSA, the official said, the government is allowing 100 percent foreign ownership in the country’s telecommunications industry.\n\nThe event was supported by Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) Secretary Ivan John E. Uy, who delivered a presentation on the state and direction of the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) infrastructure in the Philippines, and by the Department of Energy (DOE) – Renewable Energy Management Bureau Director Mylene Capongcol who presented the government’s plans and commitment to developing the renewable energy sector, which would also support the growing data center industry in the country.\n\nMeanwhile, the Philippines as a high potential market was attested by two of the leading hyperscaler companies in Hong Kong and China.\n\nMr. Paul Lai, Senior Vice President, In-Country Project Investment of HGC Global Communications, Ltd., and Mr. Allen Guo, Country Manager of the Alibaba Cloud Intelligence – Philippines, both affirmed the country’s readiness as an ideal investment location, citing its resilient economy amid the pandemic, its “welcoming regulatory environment”, particularly with the passage of the amended Public Service Act (PSA) and the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises (CREATE) Act, coupled with the Philippine businesses increasingly relying on cloud-based IT solutions for growth.\n\nExecutive Director Evariste M. Cagatan of the BOI’s Investments Promotion Services (IPS) delivered the closing message at the end of the webinar and emphasized that the country “has a bullish economic growth trajectory” to host hyperscaler and data center operations, as the government has been aggressively promoting the Philippines with its competitive advantage.\n\n“We acknowledge the support of Alibaba Cloud Intelligence and HGC Global Communications Limited, both of whom already made it happen in the Philippines. They have generously shared their positive experience. With the likes of Alibaba and HGC Global that invested in the country and many others that have signified their interest in the field and further expand their footprint, the Philippines is now positioned to be the next hyperscaler hub in the Asia Pacific,” the BOI official concluded.\n\nAirAsia has been named Asia’s Leading Low-Cost Airline Cabin Crew for the sixth consecutive year and Asia’s Leading Low-Cost Airline for the seventh year in a row, at the 29th World Travel Awards 2022.\n\nThe Malaysian airline emerged as the winner in these categories after garnering the most votes from industry players, consumers, media, and travel professionals from all across the region.\n\nBo Lingam, Group CEO of AirAsia Aviation Group Limited said: “Winning ‘Asia’s Leading Low Cost Airline’ and ‘Asia’s Leading Low Cost Airline Cabin Crew’ yet again is incredibly monumental to AirAsia as our airlines resume operations in all of our key markets. These last few years have been incredibly challenging and we are honoured to receive these accolades which will serve to motivate us to strive even harder. Our people and our customers are at the core of everything we do and a huge thank you goes out to them for this win.\n\nEchoing Bo’s comments, Suhaila Hassan, AirAsia Group Head of Cabin Crew added, “As we slowly resume normalcy and pick up where we left off almost 3 years ago, this win is extremely humbling for the Cabin Crew team who tirelessly work to uphold our high standards and ensure that our guests enjoy a seamless flight experience each time.\n\nGraham E. Cooke, Founder, World Travel Awards, remarked “Our heartiest congratulations to AirAsia for bagging the ‘Asia’s Leading Low-Cost Airline Cabin Crew 2022’ awards and ‘Asia’s Leading Low-Cost Airline 2022’ for the sixth and seventh consecutive year. AirAsia takes home the win each year thanks to its unwavering spirits and diligent efforts to uphold its stance as a ‘guest-obsessed’ which makes this award a well-deserved one.”\n\nEstablished in 1993, the World Travel Awards, is hailed as one of the most prestigious, comprehensive, and sought-after awards programmes commemorating excellence across key sectors of travel, tourism, and hospitality.\n\nShopee and Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC) will contribute a total of RM109 million to connect local sellers in the Jualan Murah Keluarga Malaysia @DE DAGANG (JMKM@DE DAGANG) between now till December 2022.\n\nThrough this programme, Shopee and MDEC will match each other’s contributions of up to RM54.5 million each to provide sales and seller subsidies to local sellers.\n\nThese subsidies will enable about 100,000 local traders to drive sales online, particularly those specialising in export, tourism, and craft products. It also aims to boost Malaysians’ trust in buying from local businesses, ensuring that sellers remain viable and competitive. When buying local products, Malaysians can expect to save up to 20% or up to RM500 on each transaction through discounts, cashback, and shipping vouchers.\n\nShopee Malaysia Head of Brand Marketing Huiyan Pan said over the past year, Shop Malaysia Online (SMO) and the Go-eCommerce Onboarding campaigns saw strong support from both sellers and consumers, generating more than 10 million orders in total.\n\n“85% of micro-SMEs who participated in both campaigns were new sellers to Shopee. JMKM@DE DAGANG will help local traders lower operating costs, leverage new opportunities online, and strengthen the adaptability and resilience of local businesses.”\n\n“Together with MDEC, we can drive a globally competitive digital nation as this added contribution will connect local sellers to more digital-first customers. We will continue to step up our efforts in promoting locally manufactured products to make a greater impact on the Malaysian economy,” Pan added.\n\nMDEC Chief Executive Officer Mahadhir Aziz said: “MDEC will continue to catalyze the growth of e-commerce in Malaysia through close collaboration with the digital ecosystem partners. Through this programme, we look forward to aiding local businesses and economically vulnerable communities to reach a wider audience and market their products and services regardless of location. This will also help sustain the incomes of many and minimize job losses.”"
