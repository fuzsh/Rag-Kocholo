It has no reliance on a 3rd party service, which I value.\n\nRichard\n\n•••\n\nMore options\n\nShare\n\nUpvote 0\n\nSep 7, 2010\n\nOriginal Poster\n\n#14\n\nHi,\n\nDidn't want to resurrect this thread but... i'm having some terrible trouble with nagios and Nsclient++\n\nI set up nagios on a VPS and update it all add the rpmforge repository (i'm using centos 5) and install nagios, set it up and can get Active checks to work.\n\ni donwload NSCA and install it\n\nuse the nsclient++ in nsca mode and it sends the data but nagios never interprets it (i turned the firewall off to ensure it wasn't that!)\n\ni'm clearly doing something wrong, anyone any idea?\n\nthanks\n\njoe\n\n•••\n\nMore options\n\nShare\n\nUpvote 0\n\nKM-Tiger\n\nAug 10, 2003\n\n10,324\n\n1\n\n2,881\n\nBexley, Kent\n\nSep 7, 2010\n\n#15\n\nProbably a silly question but have you done all the config on nsclient++ and ncsa and nagios that is outlined here:\n\nhttp://nsclient.org/nscp/wiki/doc/usage/nagios/nsca\n\n•••\n\nMore options\n\nShare\n\nUpvote 0\n\nSep 7, 2010\n\n#16\n\nThis is not quite remote monitoring software, but if you dont know about it, I'm happy to spread the word.
