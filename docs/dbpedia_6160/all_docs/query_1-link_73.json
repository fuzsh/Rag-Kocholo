This issue started occurring towards the end of May and beginning of July. What started as an issue for a single site, is now affecting a handful of our customers. All of these networks are separate so we know it is not an isolated issue.\n\nAll sites experiencing these issues have been fully updated. Has anyone else been experiencing similar issues? I have not located any recent PRTG forums discussing this problem."
