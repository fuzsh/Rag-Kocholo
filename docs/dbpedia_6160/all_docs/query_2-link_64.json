Find Out More\n\nHome\n\nBlogs\n\nArticle\n\n18 Jun 2024\n\nWhat Is Packet Loss, What Causes It And How to Reduce It?\n\nSharon Duchin\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPacket loss occurs when data packets traveling across a network fail to reach their destination, leading to delays, glitches, and the dreaded endless buffering. Persistent packet loss is an IT manager’s nightmare, but new AI- and ML-based solutions to optimize network performance can help your business stay connected and competitive in the digital landscape.\n\nIn this article we’ll double click on what is packet loss, how to fix packet loss, and how to keep your network robust. We will also find out why next-level networking with automation is important for reducing packet loss.\n\nFrom physical network checks to software updates and security measures, we cover all the bases to help your organization maintain a seamless online experience.\n\nWhy Teridion?\n\nTeridion is a global cloud-based networking platform that offers a unique solution to improve network performance by reducing packet loss and latency.\n\nWhat Is Packet Loss?\n\nData packets are the lifeblood of the internet, small units of data that zip across networks from source to destination. They’re the messengers carrying our emails, our chats, and the endless streams of information we consume and produce every day.\n\nSometimes these packets don’t reach their destination, which is what we call packet loss. Imagine sending a letter through the mail, and it never arrives. It can lead to interruptions in collaboration applications, video conferencing, or even just browsing the web, making for a frustrating and unproductive work experience.\n\nUnderstanding what causes packet loss is the first step in fixing it:\n\nNetwork Congestion\n\nNetwork congestion is the most prevalent cause of packet loss. It occurs when too much data is sent through a network than it can handle, similar to traffic jams during peak hours on a highway. This can result in delayed or dropped packets, affecting the performance of business applications and communication.\n\nDistance\n\nDistance plays a crucial role in packet loss. It is a silent yet significant factor that can affect the integrity of data transmission, leading to packet loss. Distance inherently introduces latency—the time it takes for a packet to travel from source to destination. As distance increases, so does latency, which can lead to timeouts and packet loss.\n\nSoftware Issues\n\nSoftware issues can also contribute to packet loss. Bugs, outdated software, or misconfigured network settings can disrupt the normal flow of data, causing packets to be lost in the process. In the B2B realm, software that is not up to par can lead to significant setbacks. Just as businesses must stay ahead of market trends, network software requires regular updates to handle the latest types of data traffic. Outdated protocols and applications may not efficiently manage packet transmission, resulting in loss.\n\nHardware Problems\n\nThe reliability of hardware is a cornerstone of operational integrity. Faulty networking equipment such as routers, switches, and modems are at the heart of many hardware-related packet loss issues. These devices are the gatekeepers of data flow, and when they malfunction, packets can be lost or delayed. Common problems include overheating, outdated firmware, or physical damage.\n\nDevice Overload\n\nDevice overload occurs when networking devices are pushed beyond their processing capabilities. This can happen when too many devices are connected to a network, leading to a bottleneck and subsequent packet loss.\n\nSecurity Threats\n\nSecurity threats such as DDoS attacks can intentionally flood a network with excessive traffic, causing legitimate packets to be dropped. Implementing robust security measures is essential to protect against such threats.\n\nBandwidth Congestion\n\nBandwidth congestion is a leading cause of packet loss. Upgrade Quality of Service (QoS) settings to prioritize critical data, and consider upgrading your internet plan to accommodate higher traffic volumes.\n\nInadequate Infrastructure for Handling Packet Loss\n\nLastly, inadequate infrastructure can be a significant factor. A network needs to be designed with redundancy and the ability to handle high volumes of traffic so it will be more susceptible to packet loss.\n\nThe Impact of Packet Loss\n\nSo far, we talked about what is packet loss and what causes packet loss. Before we guide you on how to stop packet loss, here’s how packet loss can affect various aspects of network usage:\n\nSlow Loading Times\n\nWhen packets are lost, the necessary information takes longer to compile at the destination. This results in slow loading times for websites and applications, causing frustration and inefficiency for users. According to Kissmatics, 47% of consumers don’t want to visit a site if it takes more than 2 seconds to load and 40% stop visiting a site if the time increases to more than 3 seconds.\n\nMissing and Outdated Information\n\nPacket loss can lead to missing or outdated information. In scenarios where real-time data is crucial, such as stock trading or live monitoring systems, packet loss can result in significant discrepancies and decision-making based on incomplete data.\n\nStreaming Interruptions\n\nFor streaming services, packet loss can cause interruptions and a degraded viewing experience. Video and audio streams rely on continuous packet delivery, and when packets are lost, users experience buffering and drops in quality.\n\nUnclear VoIP Audio\n\nVoice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is particularly sensitive to packet loss. Users may experience unclear audio during calls, with parts of the conversation missing or sounding robotic, which can impede communication.\n\nReduced Business Productivity\n\nCollaborative work, cloud services, and other business operations depend on reliable network performance, and packet loss can disrupt these activities significantly. Research from Gartner reports that in order to expedite digital transformation with cloud computing, “by the end of 2025, 30% of enterprises will establish new roles focused on IT resilience and boost end-to-end reliability, tolerability and recoverability by at least 45%.”\n\nSecurity Implications\n\nFinally, packet loss has security implications. It can be a sign of malicious activity, such as Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, where attackers intentionally flood a network with traffic to induce packet loss and disrupt services.\n\nWhen Is Packet Loss Too High?\n\nPacket loss is an inevitable phenomenon, even under the most ideal conditions. It’s essential to understand that some degree of packet loss is normal and can be expected due to the complex nature of data transmission. However, not all packet loss is created equal, and its impact can vary significantly depending on its frequency and the applications in use. A packet loss rate exceeding 5% is considered relatively high and may indicate a network issue.\n\nOccasional vs. Persistent Packet Loss\n\nOccasional Packet Loss refers to irregular packet loss incidents that occur infrequently and do not significantly impact the overall performance of the network. Such isolated events are often resolved quickly without the need for intervention.\n\nOn the other hand, persistent packet loss occurs regularly and can indicate more serious network issues. High packet loss can severely degrade network performance, leading to noticeable disruptions in service and requiring immediate attention to identify and resolve the underlying causes.\n\nCriticality of Packet Loss Across Applications\n\nNon-Real-Time Data Transfers: Applications that do not require real-time communication, such as email or file downloads, can tolerate higher levels of packet loss. These applications often have mechanisms to retransmit lost packets without significantly affecting the user experience.\n\nReal-Time Applications: On the other hand, real-time applications like voice and video calls are highly sensitive to packet loss. Even minimal packet loss can lead to poor audio and video quality, making communication difficult or unintelligible.\n\nAcceptable Packet Loss Thresholds\n\nVideo Conferencing:\n\nPacket loss should be kept below 1% for high-quality video conferencing.A packet loss rate between 1% and 3% can still provide an acceptable experience, but with noticeable quality degradation.Packet loss above 3% is generally considered unacceptable, leading to significant video freezing, artifacts, and potential call drops.\n\nScreen Sharing and Remote Desktop:\n\nFor screen sharing and remote desktop applications, packet loss should be kept below 0.5% to maintain a smooth and responsive experience.Packet loss between 0.5% and 1.5% can still be tolerable, but users may experience occasional artifacts or delays in screen updates.Packet loss above 1.5% can result in frequent freezing, distortion, and an overall poor user experience.\n\nReal-time Document Collaboration:\n\nFor real-time document editing and collaboration tools, packet loss should ideally be kept below 0.3% to ensure seamless synchronization and low latency.Packet loss between 0.3% and 1% may still be acceptable, but users may experience occasional lags or delays in updates.Packet loss above 1% can lead to frequent conflicts, data corruption, and a frustrating collaborative experience.\n\nWhile some packet loss is to be expected, it’s crucial to monitor and manage it effectively, especially in scenarios where real-time data transfer is critical. If you understand the acceptable limits for different applications, it can help you take proactive measures to mitigate the impact of packet loss and maintain a high-quality network experience.\n\nHow to Detect and Monitor Packet Loss?\n\nDetecting and monitoring packet loss is crucial for maintaining a healthy network. Fortunately, there are readily available tools and software that can help diagnose packet loss issues. Ping, Traceroute, Iperf, and MTR are some of the most commonly used tools for diagnosing packet loss. Here’s how to use Ping and Traceroute:\n\nHow to Use Ping to Detect Packet Loss\n\nStep 1: Open Command Prompt or Terminal: On Windows, press Win + R, type cmd, and hit enter. On macOS or Linux, open the Terminal.\n\nStep 2: Run the Ping Command: Type ping [destination] and press enter. Replace [destination] with the IP address or domain you want to test.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the Results: Look for the packet loss percentage in the output. If it’s higher than 0%, some packets are not reaching their destination\n\nHow to Use Traceroute to Detect Packet Loss\n\nStep 1: Open Command Prompt or Terminal: As before, access your command line interface.\n\nStep 2: Run the Traceroute Command: On Windows, type tracert [destination]. On macOS or Linux, type traceroute [destination].\n\nStep 3: Examine the Output: Each line represents a hop in the network path. Look for asterisks (*) which indicate lost packets at that hop.\n\nRegular Maintenance and Monitoring\n\nSchedule Regular Checks: Use automated tools to run Ping and Traceroute at regular intervals.Monitor Continuously: Employ network monitoring software to keep an eye on packet loss over time.\n\nThe Best Tools to Fix Packet Loss\n\nNow, we understand what causes packet loss and the impact of packet loss. By understanding the causes and effects of packet loss, we can take steps to mitigate its effects. Several tools and software solutions are available to help reduce packet loss.
