Nuremberg, Germany – May 16, 2024 – Paessler, the monitoring experts, are now certified with ISO 9001, the globally recognized standard for quality management.

DIN EN ISO 9001 is the most common standard for quality management systems, issued by the International Organization for Standardization. With a catalogue of different requirements, it serves as a framework for organizations to assure high, consistent quality, customer satisfaction and well-functioning processes.

“At Paessler, it has always been a key objective to provide customers with the best possible products and services. We are proud that our efforts are recognized with the ISO 9001 certification”, said Evren Erisen, Team Lead Quality at Paessler, who led the preparation process.

During external certification audits at the Paessler headquarters in Nuremberg, the processes at the top management level as well as different departments, such as Product Development, Finance, Sales and Partner Management, were put to the acid test. After three days of audits conducted by DQS, Paessler was successfully certified.

“We are especially happy that the auditors found not even a minor deviation from the standard, which they stated is unusual for an initial certification”, Evren commented. “This marks a great step for Paessler, on which we will further build. Preparations towards other certifications have already started.”
