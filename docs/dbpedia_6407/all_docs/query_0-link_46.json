One woman, whose husband had escaped the farm and left her behind, had a child with another man. Upon the group's return to Nyae Nyae, an angry argument broke out over the matter. An Argument About a Marriage raises questions about the impact of European farms on the economic and the social life of the Ju 'hoansi; about the complexities of marriage rules and bride-service in their traditional kinship system; and about the nature of conflict and its mediation among the Ju/'hoansi.

It’s an astonishing breakthrough for primate researchers—the first time anyone has documented a chimpanzee wielding a carefully prepared, preplanned weapon. But it's only the latest in a slew of extraordinary new findings about ape behavior. The more researchers learn about the great apes—chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans—the more evidence they find of creative intelligence. What, then, is the essential difference between them and us? \"Ape Genius,\" a NOVA-National Geographic special, explores that provocative question and examines research that is illuminating the ape mind. Bit by bit, investigators are finding an explanation for why the non-human great apes never made the breakthrough into a human-style culture that builds on the achievements of previous generations.

It's also where the world's largest mass sacrifice reportedly took place. In a temple dedication in 1487, records tell of 20,000 people sacrificed over a 4-day period. But, could such a large-scale human sacrifice have been logistically possible? Through detailed examination of archaeological and forensic evidence, existing photographs, authentic artifacts, and carefully selected interviews from eyewitnesses and experts, events are reconstructed and historical questions are finally answered. First, a team of computer modelers rebuilds Templo Mayor in staggering detail. Using state of the art computer graphics, animators bring the glory of the Aztecs back to life brick-by-brick and provide the virtual setting for a modern-day recreation of the sacrifice. Then, Australia's Anatomical Surrogate Technologies builds a collection of artificial human torsos to exact specifications to simulate the sacrifice. Learn about the character and social position of the victims and discover what kind of person it took to man the sacrificial altars for hours on end.

For many families, the betelnut trade is the only source of cash income to pay for such basic necessities as food, school fees and medicine.\n\nLanguage: English\n\nSeries:\n\nDistributor: Filmakers Library\n\nURL:\n\nBEYOND ELECTIONS: REDEFINING DEMOCRACY IN THE AMERICAS (2008, 104 minutes)\n\nFilmmaker(s): Michael Fox, Silvia Leindecker\n\nWorld Area(s): North America, South America\n\nSubject Area(s): politics, democracy, ideology\n\nFormat: DVD\n\nHoldings: Anthropology Department\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nWhat is democracy?

In reality, this culture features a highly pragmatic and mutually satisfactory partnership between men and women in a pre-industrial mercantile economy. Since there is no concrete division between the hearth and the community, women participate as visibly in the marketplace and in civic affairs and as they would in the home. In the ongoing struggle with modernization this egalitarian habit, along with the indigenous culture and language, may vanish.\n\nLanguage: Spanish and Zapotec w/English subtitles\n\nSeries:\n\nDistributor: New Yorker Video\n\nURL:\n\nBODY DETECTIVES: FORENSIC ANTHROPOLOGY AT THE BODY FARM (2000, 52 minutes)\n\nFilmmaker(s):\n\nWorld Area(s): North America\n\nSubject Area(s): Forensic Anthropology, Body Farm\n\nFormat: DVD\n\nHoldings: Anthropology Department\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nAt the Body Farm, the dead speak.

Long revered as divinity, the eunuchs- or hijras, as they are known ­ are now little more than relics in a rapidly modernizing world. Relegated to the fringes of society, their lives often plagued by poverty and hardship, the hijras are at once a powerful evocation of tradition and an inspiring parable about the human will to adapt. Through the voice of Meena, a 37 year old hijra and surrogate mother to a eunuch family of her own, Bombay Eunuch explores the challenges facing many in the eunuch community today, and offers a rare and insightful glimpse of the rewards that come with choosing to be true to oneself.\n\nLanguage:\n\nSeries:\n\nDistributor: Gidalya Pictures\n\nURL: http://www.unaff.org/2001/f-bombay.html\n\nBRAZIL: AN INCONVENIENT HISTORY (2001, 47 minutes)\n\nFilmmaker(s): Phil Grabsky\n\nWorld Area(s): Latin America\n\nSubject Area(s): History, slavery, Brazil\n\nFormat: DVD\n\nHoldings: Anthropology Department\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nWhile everyone knows of the history of slavery in the USA, few people realize that Brazil was actually the largest participant in the slave trade. Forty percent of all slaves that survived the Atlantic crossing were destined for Brazil, while only 4 % were sent to the U.S. At one time half of the population of Brazil were slaves. It was the last country to officially abolish slavery (1888) and one of the ex-slaves is still alive today. This well- researched BBC production charts Brazil's history using original texts, letters, accounts and decrees. From these original sources, we learn firsthand about the brutality of the slave traders and slave owners, and the hardship of plantation life. With the Portuguese colony of Angola acting as a \"factory\" supplying Africans to Brazil, it was cheaper to replace any slave starved and worked to death than to extend his life by treating him humanely. Few plantation owners sent for their wives to live in this hot climate, so the softening effect of family life was absent among the rough white settlers.\n\nLanguage: English\n\nSeries: BBC Timewatch\n\nDistributor: Filmakers Library\n\nURL:\n\nBRAZIL IN BLACK AND WHITE (2008, 60 minutes)\n\nFilmmaker(s): PBS\n\nWorld Area(s): Latin America\n\nSubject Area(s): History, slavery, Brazil, race, ethnicity\n\nFormat: DVD\n\nHoldings: Anthropology Department\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nAs one of the most racially diverse nations in the world, Brazil has long considered itself a colorblind “racial democracy.” But deep disparities in income, education and employment between lighter and darker-skinned Brazilians have prompted a civil rights movement advocating equal treatment of Afro-Brazilians. In Brazil, the last country in the Western Hemisphere to abolish slavery, blacks today make up almost half of the total population — but nearly two-thirds of the nation’s poor. Institutions of higher education have typically been monopolized by Brazil’s wealthy and light-skinned elite, and illiteracy among black Brazilians is twice as high as among whites. Now, affirmative action programs are changing the rules of the game, with many colleges and universities reserving 20% of spots for Afro-Brazilians. But with national surveys identifying over 130 different categories of skin color, including “cinnamon,” “coffee with milk,” and “toasted,” who will be considered “black enough” to qualify for the new racial quotas? “Am I black or am I white?” Even before they ever set foot in a college classroom, many Brazilian university applicants must now confront a question with no easy answer. BRAZIL IN BLACK AND WHITE follows the lives of five young college hopefuls from diverse backgrounds as they compete to win a coveted spot at the elite University of Brasilia, where 20 percent of the incoming freshmen must qualify as Afro-Brazilian. Outside the university, WIDE ANGLE reports on the controversial racial debate roiling Brazil through profiles of civil right activists, opponents of affirmative action, and one of the country’s few black senators.\n\nLanguage: English\n\nSeries:\n\nDistributor: PBS\n\nURL:\n\nBYE, BYE BRAZIL (1980, 115 minutes)\n\nFilmmaker(s): Carlos Diegues\n\nWorld Area(s): Latin America\n\nSubject Area(s): Brazil, feature film\n\nFormat: DVD\n\nHoldings: Anthropology Department\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nA young man loses his heart to the Queen of the carnival, Salome, when Caravana Rolidei comes to town.\n\nLanguage: Portuguese w/English subtitles\n\nSeries:\n\nDistributor:\n\nURL:\n\nCANDOMBE (2002, 58 minutes)\n\nFilmmaker(s): Silvestre Jacobi\n\nWorld Area(s): Latin America\n\nSubject Area(s): Religion, Candomblé, Candomble\n\nFormat: DVD\n\nHoldings: Anthropology Department\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nA sumptuously filmed documentary about Candombe, the music created by African slaves brought to Uruguay.\n\nLanguage: Spanish w/English subtitles\n\nSeries:\n\nDistributor:\n\nURL:\n\nCANNIBAL TOURS (1988, 72 minutes)\n\nFilmmaker(s): Dennis O'Rourke\n\nWorld Area(s): Oceania\n\nSubject Area(s): Papua New Guinea, Cultural Anthropology, Tourism\n\nFormat: DVD\n\nHoldings: Anthropology Department\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nCANNIBAL TOURS is two journeys.

It affords a glimpse at the real (mostly unconsidered or misunderstood) reasons why 'civilized' people wish to encounter the 'primitive'. The situation is that shifting terminus of civilization, where modern mass-culture grates and pushes against those original, essential aspects of humanity; and where much of what passes for values in Western culture is exposed in stark relief as banal and fake.\n\nLanguage: English\n\nSeries:\n\nDistributor: Direct Cinema Limited\n\nURL:\n\nCANNIBALISM IN THE CANYON (2000, 60 minutes)\n\nFilmmaker(s): Larry Engel\n\nWorld Area(s): North America\n\nSubject Area(s): cannibalism, history, Anasazi, American Southwest\n\nFormat: DVD\n\nHoldings: Anthropology Department\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nWhat happened to the peaceful ancient Pueblo civilization of the American southwest? For 1000 years, the Anasazi--a democratic people with rich achievements in architecture, agriculture, astronomy and art--flourished in what is now New Mexico. Yet around 1200 AD something brought their utopia to a sudden and mysterious end. Paleoanthropologist Christy Turner has found what he believes are clear signs of cannibalism among the Anasazi ruins, but American Indian groups and other archaeologists are skeptical. And while the evidence is difficult to refute, the meaning of the findings is still open to debate. In the shadow of a debate both scientific and political questions remain: did the Anasazi culture become cannibalistic, or did cannibals from afar stumble across the perfect victims?\n\nLanguage: English\n\nSeries: Secrets of the Dead\n\nDistributor: PBS\n\nURL:\n\nCANNIBALS (1999, 50 minutes)\n\nFilmmaker(s):\n\nWorld Area(s): Global\n\nSubject Area(s): cannibalism, history, documentary, ritual, religion\n\nFormat: DVD\n\nHoldings: Anthropology Department\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nIt is considered the most abhorrent of all taboos. et it has been a part of human culture since the dawn of time--and exists to this day.

The emotional entanglements that result from Karinna's \"deal\" are stronger than the trio expected. Deco and Naldinho develop a desire to possess Karinna.

It has shaped the economies, history and social structure of a large part of Latin America. Composed of archival photographs, old newsreels and penetrating interviews, this documentary takes a broad view of the influence of coffee through the ages. First introduced in the eighteenth century, coffee is now the most popular drink in the world after water. South America supplies 66% of the world production, although most of the profits go to traders and speculators outside the region. The film explains the difference between the Brazilian and Costa Rican system of production, and why the Brazilian system has led to such poverty. Mechanization of farms has thrown many rural laborers out of work, an explosive situation in a country where one percent of the population owns 46% of the land. Nobel Peace Prize winner Oscar Arias and economist Celso Furtado analyze the market forces that affect coffee prices.

Yet they never utter a single word. They are the animals, plants, and insects that are being recruited by a special breed of forensic scientists to solve the most seemingly impenetrable of crimes. Within the United States and around the globe, biologists are joining the ranks of criminal investigative teams to interpret evidence offered by those with a “natural ability” to crack a case. How do ants nesting in a human skull help police to zero in on a suspect? Can microscopic pollen grains track the path of a killer and link him to the crime scene? Astonishing real-life cases illustrate the tactics employed by these super sleuthing scientists and their “wild” associates. We learn how maggots not only can clock the time of death but also are used to trace terrorist activities by revealing the explosives used in a bomb attack, and we meet a dog whose ultrasensitive nose effectively sniffs out a case of arson. For the investigators, reading the clues requires a strong stomach and a keen eye for the intricate workings of the natural world. A visit to The Body Farm, a forensic research facility in Knoxville, Tennessee, details the various factors in the decay of a human body and how to recognize the false evidence that wildlife may leave. In Vancouver, scientists dive in to explore the more complicated process of underwater decomposition. They are learning how the behavior of curious marine creatures such as enormous sun stars and octopi could taint the evidence.\n\nLanguage: English\n\nSeries: Nature\n\nDistributor: PBS\n\nURL:\n\nCROSSING THE AMERICAN CRISES (2011, 68 minutes)\n\nFilmmaker(s): Sílvia Leindecker, Michael Fox\n\nWorld Area(s): North America\n\nSubject Area(s): United States, U.S., politics, elections\n\nFormat: DVD\n\nHoldings: Anthropology Department\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nFrom the makers of Beyond Elections, this new feature-length documentary takes us across the country amidst the economic collapse, to the grassroots solutions in the hands of the people. On September 15, 2008, the United States fell into the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. The same day, we set out on a trip around the country to ask the “American” people what they had to say about it. In 2010, we went back to see how things had changed. The financial forecasters say the recession is over, but the reality is otherwise. Their stories reveal desperation, indignation, hope, dreams and a disastrous economic breakdown; chaos generated by a system of inequality. But the financial meltdown is just one of several human rights crises now shaking the United States—in housing, education, health care, etc. The solutions to “Crossing the American Crises” are in the hands of the people.

Most of the film consists of images of dancing and bodies in motion during rituals in Rada and Petro services. The film reflects Deren's increasing personal engagement with voodoo and its practitioners (Wilcken, 1986). While this ultimately resulted in Deren disregarding the guidelines of the fellowship, Deren was able to record scenes that probably would have been inaccessible to other filmmakers.

But an amazing transformation has taken place: unemployment has fallen, public transportation is now excellent, and poor neighborhoods have improved dramatically. These changes are thanks to a process of direct democracy known as the 'Participatory Budget' scheme that's giving all Porte Alegre's citizens a say in how their city is run. The scheme devotes the bulk of the city's financial resources to renewing the infrastructure of the town's slum areas and improving living standards for its neediest residents. As a result, exceptional neighborhood leaders have sprung up. This program from the City Life series traces the experiences of two such women, both born in poor slum areas, whom have risen to make a difference in the community.\n\nLanguage: English\n\nSeries: City Life\n\nDistributor: Bullfrog Films\n\nURL:\n\nDREAMWORLDS 3: DESIRE, SEX & POWER IN MUSIC VIDEO (2007, 54 minutes)\n\nFilmmaker(s): Sut Jhally\n\nWorld Area(s):\n\nSubject Area(s): Sexuality, gender, music\n\nFormat: DVD\n\nHoldings: Anthropology Department\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nDreamworlds 3, the highly anticipated update of Sut Jhally's groundbreaking Dreamworlds 2 (1995), examines the stories contemporary music videos tell about girls and women, and encourages viewers to consider how these narratives shape individual and cultural attitudes about sexuality. Illustrated with hundreds of up-to-date images, Dreamworlds 3 offers a unique and powerful tool for understanding both the continuing influence of music videos and how pop culture more generally filters the identities of young men and women through a dangerously narrow set of myths about sexuality and gender. In doing so, it inspires viewers to reflect critically on images that they might otherwise take for granted.

This rare glimpse into Iranian culture chronicles the performance of a ta’zieh, an ancient and uniquely Iranian passion play that celebrates the glory of martyrdom for the sake of justice. Based on the life stories and fables of Islam’s prophet Mohammad, but influenced by Iranian folklore, the ta’zieh became the sole dramatic form in the world of Islam after the rise of the Shiite sect. The overall subject of any ta’zieh is the martyrdom Imam Hussein, grandson of the prophet Muhammad, in the desert of Karbala. Among the Imam’s comrades, each of whom is the subject of a specific ta’zieh, the story of the Brave Hurr assumes a singular place. Originally the enemy of the Imam, Hurr does an about-face after he meets the holy leader, and then joins forces to fight with him. Generally performed on the streets or in open venues, the ta’zieh \"is the only original dramatic art of the Islamic world,\" proclaims director Taghvai.\n\nLanguage: Persian w/English subtitles\n\nSeries:\n\nDistributor: Facets Video\n\nURL:\n\nDYING TO BE THIN (2004, 60 minutes)\n\nFilmmaker(s): Larkin McPhee\n\nWorld Area(s): North America\n\nSubject Area(s): Eating disorders, Eating disorders Treatment, Eating disorders in children, Eating disorders in adolescence, Documentary television programs, Television programs for the hearing impaired.\n\nFormat: DVD, streaming\n\nHoldings: STL\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nGirls wage a deadly battle as they strive for impossible beauty.

The Drug Abuse Council of the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare sponsored it. Eduardo is extremely well read and is educated as a healer in his small coastal Peruvian community near the city of Trujillo. The documentary is very interesting. It shows Eduardo diagnosing patients via a guinea pig. Guinea pigs are very plentiful in this region and are used frequently. Aside from interesting diagnostic practices, Eduardo is seen with his family, at the market buying materials for ritual healings, and treating patients in a unique ritual that is both supernatural and inspiring. Eduardo uses the San Pedro cactus, which has hallucinogenic properties. Both the patient and Eduardo ingest the cactus during the ritual healing. The film can appear quite dramatic to those unfamiliar with the understanding that illness and disease are culturally defined concepts. With that understanding, Eduardo the Healer is one of the most powerful documentaries from the field of Medical Anthropology to date.

Uses the struggles of the !Kung in Africa to illustrate the idea of culture loss. Here, conservation and modernization have had a serious impact on the native populations of people and wildlife. In the northern regions of the Brazilian Amazon, the program shows that mining has had a tremendous influence on the native Yanomami Indians.

The !Kung, the Mendi, and the Kpelle provide examples of the band, the tribe, and the chiefdom, respectively, while an examination of the theocratic government of Tibet uncovers some of the complications inherent in the survival of the modern state, characterized by centralized power, a code of law, and the authority to use coercion to impose that law.

(2001, 60 minutes)\n\nFilmmaker(s): Madison Davis Lacy\n\nWorld Area(s): North America\n\nSubject Area(s): Aesthetic culture\n\nFormat: DVD\n\nHoldings: Anthropology Department\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nWhat Do You Dance? begins the story of the evolution of a uniquely American form of movement with African slaves on a southern plantation hunched low to the ground, feet pounding the earth with rhythmic intensity as they hum, clap, sing, and dance the \"Ring Shout\" -- one of the dances writer Ralph Ellison called America's first choreography. As the dominant strain in a cultural synthesis of Irish clogs, Scottish jigs, English reels, Spanish fandangos, Caribbean rhythms, and more, African dances left an indelible imprint on American dance. The story of their influence unfolds against the backdrop of American history, tracing Africans through slavery, the Great Migration north, the culturally rich Harlem Renaissance, racial segregation, and the Great Depression. For many Americans, African dance, from the plantation \"Ring Shout \"and \"Cakewalk\" to the Jazz Age \"Charleston,\" \"Black Bottom,\" and tap, was a liberating force from the rigid restrictions of European dance and culture. And in the early 1900s, when American choreographers Isadora Duncan, Loie Fuller, and Ruth St. Denis created a revolutionary alternative to Europe's classical ballet, African-American dancers played a role in this \"aesthetic dance\" movement.\n\nLanguage: English\n\nSeries:\n\nDistributor: PBS\n\nURL:\n\nFREE TO DANCE VOL. 2: STEPS OF THE GODS (2001, 60 minutes)\n\nFilmmaker(s): Madison Davis Lacy\n\nWorld Area(s): North America\n\nSubject Area(s): Aesthetic culture\n\nFormat: DVD\n\nHoldings: Anthropology Department\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nKatherine Dunham's year in the Caribbean, during the 1930s was both an anthropological field trip and a journey in search of her own roots. She experienced dance that was a powerful echo of African culture and an integral part of spiritual and secular life. After completing her master's thesis, \"The Dances of Haiti,\" Dunham turned to the concert stage -- a bold move at a time when black dancers were confined to roles as sensual exotica in cabaret chorus lines or comic relief in minstrel shows and vaudeville. To accomplish her mission, Dunham had to mold dancers who could perform what she called \"the steps of the Gods.\" She crafted a movement system that fused the isolations and polyrhythmic syncopations of African-derived dance from the Caribbean with European ballet. The Dunham Technique, along with those created by Martha Graham, Merce Cunningham, Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman, and Jose Limon, was one of modern dance's seminal movement systems. Showcased in \"L'Ag'Ya,\" a piece based on dances she studied in Martinique, and in a class taught by former Dunham dancer Walter Nicks, it is also visible in Dunham's performance in the motion picture version of the Broadway musical on which she collaborated with New York City Ballet's George Balanchine, \"Cabin in the Sky.\"\n\nLanguage: English\n\nSeries:\n\nDistributor: PBS\n\nURL:\n\nFROM HONEY TO ASHES (2006, 47 minutes)\n\nFilmmaker(s): Lucas Bessire\n\nWorld Area(s): Latin America\n\nSubject Area(s): Foragers, religion, NGOs, South America, Amazon, native populations\n\nFormat: DVD\n\nHoldings: STL\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nIn March 2004, one of the world's last voluntarily isolated groups of hunter-gatherers walked out of the forest in northern Paraguay, fleeing ranchers' bulldozers. They formed a new village with their more settled relatives, where they confronted the complexities of learning how to become \"Ayoreo Indians\" and more critically, how to survive in a rapidly changing world. This documentary provides an intimate portrait of a divided community four months after this historical event, and their efforts to chart a collective future in a context shaped by deforestation, NGO activity, anthropologists and evangelical Christianity. Self-consciously engaging a history of ethnographic representations and tropes of \"first contact,\" the reflexive video uses the filmmaker's narration to reflect on the experiences and confusions of a process that remains ultimately opaque for the \"new people,\" for their relatives, and for the anthropologist. This film contributes to the visual anthropology of lowland South America by putting a human face to critical questions about \"contact,\" \"indigeneity\" and the ways certain narrow ideas of \"modernity\" continue to be presented as the only options for Native peoples in the Gran Chaco and beyond.\n\nLanguage: English\n\nSeries:\n\nDistributor: Documentary Educational Resources\n\nURL:\n\nFUNERAL CHANTS FROM THE GEORGIAN CAUCASUS (2009, 21 minutes)\n\nFilmmaker(s): Hugo Zemp\n\nWorld Area(s): Asia\n\nSubject Area(s): Dirges Georgia (Republic) Svanetia, Funeral music Georgia (Republic) Svanetia, Chants Georgia (Republic) Svanetia, Svanetians Music, Folk music Georgia (Republic) Svanetia, Funeral rites and ceremonies Georgia (Republic) Svanetia, Documentary films.\n\nFormat: DVD\n\nHoldings: STL\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nThe villages of the Svaneti province are located in north-western Georgia, in the valleys that lie between the mountains of the Caucasus. The Svans represent about 1% of the Georgian population. Their language differs from the Georgian language, and their religion is a syncretism of Orthodox Christian faith and pre-Christian beliefs. The polyphony of the Svans appears as one of the major styles of the Georgian vocal art. It consists of two soloist voices and the bass of the choir. In their funeral rituals, the Svans combine three vocal expressions which are rarely found nowadays in other parts of the world: women's individual laments punctuated by collective wails like in Ancient Greece, men's individual laments, and polyphonic chants by male choirs. While the individual laments are aimed at the deceased and the souls of departed people, the men's polyphonic chants use no words but a series of syllables which follow a set pattern. With chords partly dissonant to a Western European ear, and without any cries other than musically stylized ones, these collective chants of great intensity manage to convey the helplessness and inexpressible grief of Man faced with death. Funeral chants of the Svans of northwestern Georgia. Most of the chants are polyphonic chants by male choirs with no words. Chiefly polyphonic chants with no words.
