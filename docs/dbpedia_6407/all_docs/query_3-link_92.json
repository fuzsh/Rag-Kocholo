        "text": "Source: Amonarmah Consults\n\nWhen tracking your coffee, implement quality control measures to ensure that the coffee meets international standards for quality and safety. Also conduct regular audits to ensure compliance with traceability standards and so you can identify areas for improvement. Lastly, use labelling and certification schemes to provide consumers with information on the origin and quality of the coffee. This can include third-party certification schemes like Fairtrade, Rainforest Alliance and Organic certification. This will help you to be accountable for your coffee and will increase your buyers’ trust.\n\n5. Build relationships with farmers to ensure you pay a fair price\n\nMany coffee farmers struggle to earn a living income. This is because large coffee buyers and intermediaries pay low prices. Farmers spend a lot of their money to hire labour to help them with their farm activities. Labour alone is responsible for 60% of the total cost of coffee production. When coffee prices are low, it becomes difficult to hire extra labour to help with farm work. The low prices can lead to low incomes, poverty, malnutrition and child labour among farming households.\n\nWhile smallholder farmers are responsible for most of the world’s coffee production, a small but significant proportion is produced by large coffee plantations that employ farm workers. Many coffee farm workers receive wages lower than the average wage in the agricultural sector, and they work long hours. Many are hired as casual labourers, on a per-day or per-task basis. This means their work time does not cover a full month of labour. Many are also hired for harvesting and paid based on the number of kilograms they harvest per day.\n\nThis problem persists because many exporters do not build relationships with coffee farmers beyond the business of buying their coffee. This hinders their ability to fully understand farmers’ daily struggles. And while cooperatives often do build some form of relationship with farmers, they can be more intentional in making it part of their agenda.\n\nExporters can build this relationship by working together with cooperatives. Long-term partnerships based on trust and respect help when agreeing on fair prices and promoting fair labour practices. To keep long-term relationships, it is important to create communication channels. This can involve talking to each other regularly on the phone.\n\nAnother step to enhance your relationship is to visit the farms to understand the local context in which they produce coffee. This will help you to identify areas where farmers need help. While coffee companies make a lot of money, coffee farmers do not get a fair share. Coffee farmers receive only 2% of the revenue from every cup of coffee sold (see Figure 2). A strong relationship with farmers will facilitate agreeing on fair prices. This price will account for the true cost of sustainable production. It will also encourage them to invest in sustainable practices by ensuring fair labour practices while earning a decent living income. This will contribute to the long-term viability of their farms.\n\nEnsure that farmers are represented in decision-making processes in the cooperative. Make sure the farmers feel free to talk about production and social problems. By including farmers in leadership positions and committees, their voices can be heard, and social issues can be addressed together. This will also help you to discuss adopting sustainable practices. They will also understand the cost that comes with this and the reason for the prices they receive.\n\nFigure 2: Coffee value chain actors and their share of coffee revenue\n\nSource: Modified from The Value of Coffee: Sustainability, Inclusiveness, and Resilience of the Coffee Global Value Chain\n\n6. Promote sustainable sourcing practices\n\nSustainable sourcing is the practice of buying goods from suppliers who use best practices. By sourcing responsibly, you help ensure that coffee is produced in a way that supports the livelihoods of everyone in the supply chain. This helps to maintain the quality of the coffee and the long-term existence of the coffee industry.\n\nYou can do this by developing and using a code of conduct that states what you expect of ethical labour practices. It should cover issues like wages, working hours, health and safety. Communicate about it with all your suppliers. You can ensure it is enforced with regular audits and inspections. Next, provide training and education to suppliers and cooperatives. This training should help them understand and follow ethical labour standards. This can include training on topics like health and safety, and the importance of fair treatment.\n\nEnsure there is no forced or child labour in your supply chain\n\nThe International Labour Organization (ILO) defines child labour as work that deprives children of their childhood, potential and dignity. This is harmful to their physical and mental development. Coffee is included in the US Department of Labour list of goods produced by child or forced labour for over 15 countries. Children are often used to replace labourers when coffee prices are low and farmers can no longer pay for help on their farms. They work with their parents to supplement their family’s income. In areas where there are coffee plantations, they help parents meet their production quotas.\n\nIt is important to identify areas of vulnerability related to forced and child labour in your supply chain. Assess the communities where your suppliers are located, the type of work they do and the working conditions. This will help you understand where the risks are highest.\n\nOnce you have identified the high-risk areas, you should create a supplier code of conduct. This code of conduct should state what you expect from your suppliers about forced and child labour. It should require your suppliers to follow all relevant laws and regulations. The code should also set specific requirements for working conditions, fair wages and other labour-related issues.\n\nMake sure that no one is forced to work and that no children are being made to work in your supply chain. You need to teach your suppliers and cooperatives how to identify and prevent these problems. You can train them on labour laws, human rights and ethical business practices.\n\nAfter implementing the code of conduct, you should also set up a grievance mechanism. This is a way for people to report any problems they come across. It could be a private way for workers to report problems so they do not have to worry about being punished. By doing all of these things, you can make sure that your supply chain is safe and that everyone is treated fairly.\n\nFinally, your supplier code of conduct should also include a system for monitoring. Check that your suppliers are complying with the code. This could involve regular audits or inspections. You should also set clear consequences for suppliers who do not follow the code. You can end your business relationship with them.\n\nFigure 3: Steps to ensure no forced or child labour\n\nSource: Amonarmah Consults\n\nEngage in community development projects\n\nIt is important to support the communities where you work. Support projects like building schools or health clinics and local businesses to build good relationships with the community.\n\nA cooperative in Rwanda called ‘Kopakama’ set up washing stations in a farming community without electricity. Because of the washing stations, the community now has access to electricity. By doing things like this, you can ensure that your coffee business is fairer and more sustainable. You grow a good relationship with the people who produce your coffee and customers in Europe who buy them.\n\nFigure 4: Electrical line provided by Kopakama for the coffee farming community\n\nPhoto provided by Grace Izerwe (Kopakama cooperative Rwanda)\n\n7. Adhere to workers’ health and safety standards\n\nThere are lots of health risks associated with working in coffee production, harvesting and processing. Workers can get hurt by sharp tools or by doing the same movements repeatedly. They may also have to carry heavy things, breathe in dust from the coffee or work in hot conditions. Coffee processing involves a lot of physical work, including removing the outer layer of the coffee, fermenting it, washing, drying, milling and sorting it.\n\nFigure 5: Work-related health risks of coffee farmers\n\nILO’s List of Work-Related Health Risks for Coffee Production and Primary Processing\n\nInjuries from sharp cutting tools – these can range from bruises to deep cuts.\n\nInjuries from contact with or entanglement in unguarded machinery or from being hit by motorised vehicles.\n\nHearing loss or impairment due to noisy machinery.\n\nInjuries from repetitive and forceful movements and lifting and carrying heavy or awkward loads.\n\nPoisoning and long-term health problems from pesticide use or exposure.\n\nRespiratory problems due to exposure to coffee dust.\n\nHigh levels of sun exposure, which can result in skin cancer and heat exhaustion.\n\nSnake and insect bites.\n\nLong working hours or stress.\n\nSource: International Labour Organisation\n\n2 tasks stand out as being more dangerous. The first is applying pesticide. This is often done without enough personal protective equipment. The second is shade management. This requires workers to climb trees with saws to remove branches.\n\nWorkers are not provided with personal protective equipment (PPE) in many coffee plantations. They experience changing temperatures, chemicals and ergonomic risk-related factors. They are also not usually given boots, gloves, hats, aprons, raincoats, spraying or lifting equipment, amongst many other things.\n\nThere is a lack of sanitation services and access to clean water, restrooms and public showers. Workers are not able to clean themselves after applying agrochemicals. This situation is worse when there are no medical services or access to healthcare facilities close by.\n\nHowever, there are many benefits to protecting workers and ensuring their safety. When workers are safe, it protects the business in the long term. Ensuring workers’ health and safety is required by international labour laws. Not doing it can cause problems and damage your company’s reputation.\n\nThere are many things you can do to ensure workers’ safety. At the farmer and farm worker level, you can partner with your customers to buy PPE for farmers and workers at processing stations. Some buyers are willing to help farmers to access health care. For example, some buyers of the coffee supplied by the Kopakama cooperative pay monthly health insurance for its farmers.\n\nAt the office level, to keep workers safe and healthy, coffee cooperatives, plantation managers and exporters must follow safety rules. As well as providing PPE, you can do the following:\n\nTrain workers in the proper handling and storage of hazardous materials to minimise the risk of exposure;\n\nTrain workers to safely operate machinery and equipment to prevent accidents and injuries;\n\nTrain workers on proper body mechanics and ergonomics to prevent injuries related to repetitive motions and lifting;\n\nTrain workers on electrical safety and the proper use of electrical equipment;\n\nFire safety procedures should be in place, including fire extinguishers and evacuation plans; and\n\nFirst aid kits and trained personnel should be available to assist in case of an injury or illness.\n\nProvide safe working space for workers\n\nProviding a safe office space and environment for workers is a crucial duty of your coffee export company or cooperative. Here are some tips to help you provide a good office space and environment for your workers.\n\nFirst, make sure the office space and environment is safe and clean. This means that the building is sturdy and has enough light and air. It should also be free of things like mould, pests and other hazards. The building should have basic facilities, like bathrooms and kitchens, that meet hygiene standards. Keep the office space and environment clean by making a cleaning schedule and sticking to it.\n\nProvide basic amenities, such as clean water. Make sure that workers know their rights and responsibilities, including information about safety and hygiene. Inspect the office space and environment regularly to ensure that it is up to standard.\n\nProvide security measures to keep workers, official documents and their belongings safe. This may include locks, security cameras or guards. Ensure workers have access to emergency services in case of accidents or illnesses. Provide information about hospitals, clinics and ambulance services.\n\nBy following these tips, you can make sure that workers have a safe and comfortable place to work. This can help them feel more satisfied with their job and be more productive.\n\nEnsure awareness of labour law and employment contracts within your organisation\n\nMake a clear policy that explains the labour laws and provides employment contracts for workers in your company. Tell all your employees about the policy and make it easy to understand. The contract should be clear about what the worker has to do, how much they will be paid and what benefits they will get. You should give the contract to the worker before they start working and let them know if there are any changes.\n\nTeach your employees about labour laws and employment contracts. This will help them learn about their rights and what they need to do. You can teach them in a group, online or 1-on-1. Make sure your employees have a way to report problems or concerns if they have any. You can do this by having an HR department or a hotline.\n\nCheck your policies and procedures often to make sure you are following the law and treating your employees fairly. If you have any questions, you can ask a lawyer or a labour organisation. Listen to your employees and ask them for feedback on how things are going.\n\nBy doing these things, you can help your employees understand their rights and make sure you are following the rules.\n\nProtect workers’ rights and freedom of association\n\nWorkers in cooperatives, exporting companies and coffee plantations should know their rights and have the ability to join unions or workers’ organisations if they want.\n\nTo make sure workers have these rights, here are some things you can do:\n\nAllow workers to join a union or workers’ organisation. Do not treat them differently if they do. Set up ways for workers and management to talk, like meetings or a suggestion box, so everyone can share concerns and ideas. This can help build trust and respect.\n\nMake sure you follow the laws that protect workers’ rights to join unions or workers’ organisations. Do not interfere with them.\n\nWhen workers join unions or workers’ organisations, your company can get some benefits like:\n\nFewer problems at work, like complaints or strikes;\n\nA happier, healthier and more skilled workforce;\n\nMore workers who care about the business and work hard;\n\nA safer workplace; and\n\nWorkers who want to stay.\n\n8. Strive to ensure gender equality at the farm or cooperative level\n\nGender inequality is common in the coffee sector, with women often being underrepresented in the coffee industry and having fewer opportunities to own land, access credit or participate in decision-making processes. Meanwhile, they provide up to 70% of labour in coffee production. Women coffee farmers produce fewer crops than male farmers because they lack input. If we reduce the gender gap, we could create up to 30 billion more cups of coffee a year.\n\nGender issues can be addressed at 2 levels. At the farm level and at the cooperative or company level.\n\nAt the farm level, you should promote gender equity in 2 ways. First, it is important to educate male farmers about the importance of gender equality. Second, empower female farmers and the wives of male farmers who do most of the work on the farm.\n\nAn example to follow for empowering women is that of the Kopakama cooperative in western Rwanda. They established a sub-cooperative called ‘Ejo Heza’ for its female members. The cooperative provided a plot of land for the women to manage and grow their own coffee trees. The women come together twice a week to work on the communal plot. They spend the rest of the week working on their own family coffee farms. This has helped to empower women and give them a greater sense of ownership of their work. It has also led to the development of a speciality Arabica brand. This has attracted a new segment of the coffee market interested in supporting women in agriculture.\n\nAnother example is the Ketiara cooperative in Indonesia. About 40% of its members are women and the cooperative is also led by a woman. Under her leadership, the cooperative has successfully introduced a unique coffee range named ‘Queen Ketiara’, which is exclusively produced by women. This specific coffee line has emerged as one of the cooperative’s most valuable assets. The woman’s leadership has not only improved the livelihoods of nearly 2,000 Gayonese farmers, it has also conveyed an important message to the community: empowering women leads to good outcomes.\n\nCreating a sub-cooperative for female members and empowering them to work on their own plots promotes economic empowerment for women farmers. This, in turn, improves social welfare in rural communities.\n\nFigure 6: Women coffee farmers in Rwanda\n\nPhoto provided by Grace Izerwe (Kopakama cooperative Rwanda)\n\nCreate a platform to bring women into the coffee farming community. The platform can act as a forum for women. In it, they can discuss their challenges in coffee farming and share solutions. It can also provide a space for women to network, access training and extension services, and receive support from eachother.\n\nTo create the platform, you can start by identifying women leaders in the coffee farming community who can help mobilise and organise other women. These leaders can help organise meetings and discussions. They can also serve as mentors.\n\nThe platform can take many forms, such as a women’s group, a WhatsApp or Facebook group, or a community-based organisation. The key is ensuring the platform is accessible to all women in the community. It should be a safe and supportive space for women to engage with eachother.\n\nIt is important to ensure that your workplace is gender-sensitive. This means taking steps to ensure that women and men are treated equally. A gender-balanced workplace can lead to increased productivity and profitability, and an increase in employee attraction and retention. It can also enhance creativity, innovation and openness.\n\nSource: ILO\n\nTo promote gender balance in the workplace, you can look at your policies and practices to see if they are fair and attractive to women. For example, you can review your recruitment and promotion practices. Ensure they are fair and transparent and that they do not disadvantage women. When you offer training and development programmes, make sure they are equally accessible to all employees, regardless of gender. Check whether men are more likely to take up training than women. If this is the case, try to find out what is keeping women from participating in the training.\n\nFinally, it is important to measure progress and hold yourself accountable for promoting gender equality in your workplace and in the coffee farming community. This can involve tracking key performance indicators like the number of women in leadership positions or the share of female employees participating in training programmes.\n\nFigure 8: Gender-balanced workplace\n\nSource: ILO\n\nMolgo Research, Amonarmah Consults, and Ethos Agriculture carried out this study on behalf of CBI."
