        "text": "When you’re stuck in traffic in the early morning hours or exhausted after a long day’s work, there’s little that can make you feel awake quite like a nice, hot cup of coffee. In fact, that’s why many people incorporate stopping for coffee (or going through the drive-thru) into their daily routine. And there’s nothing more important than being awake while driving, right? Well, that’s not exactly the whole picture.\n\nWhile coffee is the most commonly consumed beverage in vehicles, it has also been shown to be one of the worst drinks to have while on the road. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), 80% of all car accidents are caused by distracted driving as a result of eating or drinking.\n\nA Form of Distracted Driving\n\nAlthough drinking a cup of coffee may seem harmless, sometimes the police will classify drinking coffee in the car as a form a distracted driving. This is no better than texting while driving. This is because it causes you to take your attention off of the road. It’s made even worse by the fact that the concern of spilling hot liquid takes even more attention in preventing oneself from doing so. Plus, holding a cup of coffee with one hand means that only one hand is on the wheel.\n\nDistracted Driving vs. Drowsy Driving\n\nSure, drowsy driving is also extremely dangerous, and no one should drive if they are not fully awake and alert. This can also cause delayed reaction times and inattentiveness. But one risk doesn’t validate the other. So what can you do instead? Avoid drinking your coffee while driving and only drive after you have had your coffee or once you are fully awake.\n\nUnfortunately, a lot of drivers do – and will continue to – drink coffee while they drive. And therefore, a lot of accidents will continue to be caused by these distracted drivers. Therefore, if you have been involved in an accident with someone who was distracted due to drinking coffee while driving (or another form of distracted driving), and you suffer an injury, it’s imperative that you understand your rights and your options.\n\nMPJ Law Firm Can Help Those in NM Who Have Been Injured in a Slip and Fall Accident\n\nIf you or a loved one has been injured in a car accident, it can greatly impact your life.
