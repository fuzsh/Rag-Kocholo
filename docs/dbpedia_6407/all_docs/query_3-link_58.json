        "text": "Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are just like anyone else. We have ups and downs and everything in between. Latter-day Saints have a reputation for being a happy, peaceful people. But that doesn’t mean we don’t have challenges. Everyone in life is fighting a hard battle—but when we try our best to live the gospel of Jesus Christ, we have additional strength and peace to make it through.\n\nAs far as lifestyle is concerned, Latter-day Saints try to keep Jesus front and center. Our beliefs about the Savior and His teachings affect our day-to-day decisions about how we speak, dress, and act. For example, we try to avoid working on Sundays so we can attend church, serve others, and spend time with family. Faithful members of the Church do not smoke, drink alcohol, or gamble.\n\nLearn more about our community or find a church near you.\n\nMembers of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints choose not to drink beer because we believe in an inspired health code called the Word of Wisdom that encourages us to take care of our bodies. Most of it is common sense stuff. No illegal drugs. No alcohol. No tobacco. Reasoning for avoiding other substances, like coffee or tea, is perhaps less obvious. However, we believe these instructions came from God, so we abstain from those substances.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has many cultural traditions and customs that focus on the family. For example, we try to reserve one night a week for a home evening, or family night. Other activities throughout the week include Church gatherings like potlucks, small parties, or youth groups for teenagers. Many of our traditions are standard—like celebrating holidays with our families—and others are more unique—like offering a blessing for a new baby during church. As families, we pray together, read scriptures together, and on the first Sunday of every month, we even fast together.\n\nLearn more about our community or find a church near you."
