        "text": "BY now, the case of the $3 million cup of coffee is securely lodged as Exhibit A in the minds of those who believe the American legal system has run amok.\n\nMany people remember the woman from Albuquerque, who was scalded by McDonald's coffee in 1992 and awarded nearly $3 million in punitive damages by a jury. Fewer remember that an out-of-court settlement reduced the award to a far smaller, still secret, sum. And almost nobody recalls that the jury also found that the woman was 20 percent at fault.\n\nLast month, it was Britain's turn to render hot coffee justice. A High Court judge reached a different conclusion in a similar case, dismissing lawsuits by people suing McDonald's for burns they said were caused by hot drinks, mostly coffee. ''I am quite satisfied,'' Justice Richard Field wrote, ''that McDonald's was entitled to assume the consumer would know that the drink was hot, and there are numerous commonplace ways of speeding up cooling, such as stirring and blowing.''\n\nThere were some important differences between the American and British cases. In the Albuquerque incident, a 79-year-old woman was scalded when she opened a coffee cup she placed between her legs while sitting in a parked car. She was hospitalized for eight days, with major burns to her buttocks, thighs and labia. In Britain, those who suffered burns were mostly children, who were injured by spilled beverages on trays carried by adults. And although some of the British claimants were seriously burned, none was hospitalized for long."
