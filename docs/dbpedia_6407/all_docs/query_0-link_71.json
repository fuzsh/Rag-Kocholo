        "text": "CAMPFIRE STUDIOS, an Emmy-winning production company founded by its CEO Ross Dinerstein, is known for its broad bench of content across scripted and non-fiction, for both feature film and TV/streaming platforms. Over the last 20 years, Dinerstein has produced or executive produced 70+ series and films, including debuts at Sundance, SXSW, Tribeca Hot Docs, and TIFF.\n\nNotable projects produced by Campfire/Dinerstein include Netflix’s Muscles and Mayhem: An Unauthorized Story of the American Gladiators and Poisoned: The Dirty Truth About Your Food, Max’s Smartless: On the Road, Hulu’s WeWork: Or the Making and Breaking of a $47 Billion Unicorn (Emmy winner, 2022), HBO Max’s Low Country: The Murdaugh Dynasty, The Way Down Part 1 and 2, and Heaven’s Gate: The Cult of Cults, FX’s Hysterical and The Most Dangerous Animal of All, Netflix’s Neymar: Perfect Chaos (seen by over 50 million subscribers in its first week), David Fincher’s Voir, and John Grisham’s The Innocent Man (which contributed to a federal judge overturning the wrongful conviction of subject Karl Fontenot and Tommy Ward after 36 years behind bars). Additional independent documentary features include Jiro Dreams of Sushi, Silicon Cowboys, A Glitch in the Matrix (Official Selection 2021 Sundance Film Festival), and TikTok Boom (2023 Emmy Nominee, Official Selection 2022 Sundance Film Festival).

Campfire’s first foray into podcasting, Abuse of Power with David Rudolf and Sonya Pfeiffer, won the 2021 Webby for Best Limited True Crime Series and was picked up by Audible for two more seasons. Currently, Campfire has ten projects in production and fifteen projects in both scripted and non-fiction development.\n\nCampfire is part of media, marketing and investment company Wheelhouse.\n\nABOUT The Team:\n\nRoss M. Dinerstein\n\nFounder and CEO\n\nRoss Dinerstein is the founder and CEO of Campfire, a premium production company known for its broad bench of content across scripted and unscripted, for both feature film and TV/streaming platforms. Over the past 15 years, Dinerstein has produced or executive produced 40+ series and feature films, premiering projects at the most prestigious festivals in the world, including Sundance, SXSW, Tribeca and Toronto. Dinerstein and Campfire's current and most recent projects include HBO Max’s upcoming Heaven's Gate docuseries; FX’s The Most Dangerous Animal of All; Netflix's true-crime documentary series John Grisham’s The Innocent Man (which contributed to a federal judge overturning in 2019 the wrongful conviction of subject Karl Fontentot, after 35 years behind bars); and Netflix’s Emmy-nominated, scripted series Special (currently in production on Season 2), among others.\n\nDinerstein has also produced eight Netflix Original features, including Rattlesnake; thriller 1922, based on the Steven King novella; and comedy The Package. His credits also include IFC's cult horror movie The Pact and feature documentaries Jiro Dreams of Sushi and Silicon Cowboys.\n\nIn 2020, Dinerstein and Campfire launched the company’s first podcast, Abuse of Power, hosted by husband and wife criminal defense duo David Rudolf and Sonya Pfeiffer and spotlighting injustices in America.\n\nBrendon Schaufert\n\nDirector, Production\n\nBrendon tackles logistics like a Jaguar tackles a Capybara. First picking up a VHS camcorder at a young age, he fell in love with moving pictures and graduated from Temple University with a BA in Film and Media Arts. From there, he worked a bunch of odd-jobs until finally moving to Los Angeles to pursue his dream. That dream started as a PA and progressed from there - with many days spent scrubbing fake blood from the floor on the sets of true crime recreation shows, shuttling actors to and from set for music videos, and coordinating productions small and large in the commercial video-production landscape. After 4 years in the industry, Brendon landed at Campfire to work on documentary, scripted and non-scripted projects and is continuing to learn and advance his skill set with the help of a tremendously talented team. To say he has enjoyed every moment is an understatement. Here's to many more years to come."
