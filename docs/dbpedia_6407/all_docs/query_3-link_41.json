        "text": "Initiation and Roles\n\nCriminal and civil cases are initiated differently, and the titles of the individuals involved differ slightly. Criminal cases are only initiated by the federal or state government in response to a law being broken. The federal or state governments are known as the prosecution. The prosecution is an attorney, or group of attorneys, hired by the government to present a case against the accused. Criminal cases are usually titled something like âState v. [last name of the defendant accused of a crime].â In criminal prosecutions, the victim is not a party to the lawsuit, but might be a witness for the state at the trial.\n\nIn contrast, private parties initiate civil cases when they feel that someone has injured them. Again, civil cases stem from breach of contract, custody cases, and attacks on oneâs character. Private parties can include an individual, a group, or a business. The person, group, or business who initiates the case is referred to as the plaintiff or complainant. The accused is referred to as the defendant, in both criminal and civil proceedings.\n\nTypically, there is a difference in the burden of proof for the two types of cases. In a criminal case, the defendant must be proven guilty âbeyond a reasonable doubt.â In a civil case, the defendant must be proven liable through a âpreponderance of the evidence.â In other words, the prosecution in a civil case must prove that it is more probable than not that the defendant is liable.\n\nIn criminal cases, the defendant is entitled to an attorney and may be appointed an attorney if he or she is not able to afford one. The state appoints the attorney. In contrast, all parties involved in a civil case are required to secure their own legal representation.\n\nTypically, civil and criminal laws use different terminology, and being found guilty or accountable in each type of case results in different consequences.\n\nIn a civil action (lawsuit), the plaintiff is the person who is alleging that he or she has actually been harmed (physically, financially, or in another manner), and the defendant is the one who is asked to pay damages or otherwise compensate the plaintiff. Outside of financial compensation, the plaintiff may be ordered to do something or refrain from doing something, which is referred to as injunctive relief.\n\nIn the Liebeck v. McDonaldâs case, a woman sued McDonaldâs for serving hot coffee. The woman spilled hot coffee on her lap while trying to add cream and sugar. The woman sued McDonaldâs for negligence in a civil suit. The issue centered on whether or not the coffeeâs specific temperature was unreasonably hot. McDonaldâs lost the lawsuit. The compensatory verdict was $160,000. McDonaldâs was found liable.\n\nConversely, if a defendant is convicted of committing a crime, the consequences are usually incarceration (jail/prison) and/or a fine (payment of money to the state).\n\nThe word used to describe the legal responsibility for harm in a civil case is liability, not guilt. Guilty is the word used to describe a person found guilty of committing a crime in a criminal case.\n\nBusinesses can be charged with criminal acts as well. In 2017, Oliver Schmidt, former manager of a Volkswagen engineering office near Detroit, was arrested. He faced years in prison for attempts to defraud the United States, wire fraud, violation of the Clean Air Act, and a charge of giving an untrue statement under the Clean Air Act. Schmidtâs actions directly violated a business law and, since his actions violated an established law, he was held criminally liable. In December of 2017, Schmidt was sentenced to seven years in prison."
