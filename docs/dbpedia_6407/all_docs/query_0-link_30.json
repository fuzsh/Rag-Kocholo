        "text": "Documentaries are by far my favorite genre to watch. It’s like watching a book. Most people that know me know that I am a great source for book and film recommendations and my colleagues are no different.\n\nBecause I am always getting asked for recommendations, I decided to compile this list of The 10 Best Legal Documentaries That Every Lawyer Needs to Watch because honestly,\n\n“What do you guys mean you haven’t seen these yet?!”\n\nIf you’re not a lawyer you should still watch these because they are just packed with good stuff.\n\nThese documentaries are so mind-blowing they should count as CLE credit\n\n1. Dinosaur 13 (2014)\n\nArea of Law: Property, Eminent Domain, Native American Land Trusts\n\nSue the Dinosaur is a Chicagoan like me. Of course she isn’t from there but that’s where she lives and I remember the first time I saw her. She is breath taking.\n\nThis documentary takes a deep dive into how archeologists found Sue and the horrible fight for her that ensued afterwards.\n\nThis one was a tear jerker for me. So I gave it five stars for making a thug cry.\n\n2. Hot Coffee (2011)\n\nArea of law: Torts, Policy\n\nHot Coffee goes behind the headlines of the infamous McDonald’s Coffee case and it’s the life hack documentary that Americans need to watch.\n\nIf they only knew what lengths their insurance companies went to not to pay claims, I have a feeling Jake from State Farm wouldn’t be so popular.\n\nI gave it 4 stars because it could have been longer.\n\n3. The Devil We Know (2018)\n\nArea of law: Environmental law, Torts, What plaintiff lawyers go through\n\nThis documentary takes a look into the litigation behind Teflon showing how big corporations don’t care about anything but the bottom line.\n\nCall up your big law friend and say “OMG, how could you defend those people?!”\n\nI gave it 4 stars because you do have to push through some dull parts.\n\n4. Gideon’s Army (2013)\n\nArea of law: The life of Public Defenders\n\nPublic Defenders are often the butt of a lot of jokes and disrespect.\n\nTo me, it is one of the most noble positions you can hold as an attorney. I just wish society looked at it that way. This documentary goes behind the scenes of what it is like to be a Public Defender.\n\nI feel like it was missing something.\n\n5. Saving Capitalism (2017)\n\nArea of law: Policy and Elections\n\nThis documentary probably wouldn’t be classified as a legal documentary but it is still one lawyers should watch. As the name implies, Saving Capitalism is about economic policy in the U.S.\n\nThe juicy part is about how our country’s policies are framed and influenced in today’s world. Before you vote again, watch this documentary.\n\nThis one just did it for me. Who doesn’t love an objective view of politics?\n\n6. Who Let The Dogs Out? (2019)\n\nArea of law: Intellectual Property\n\nThis was fun to watch. It starts off with the legal battle surrounding the hit song “Who Let the Dogs Out?” and goes back to the origins of the song and who really owns the rights. The ending will surprise you.\n\nIt made the list because it was different yet enjoyable.\n\nBest Legal Documentaries About Criminal Law\n\n7. 13th (2016)\n\nArea of law: Policy, Criminal law\n\nThis one is about the 13th Amendment to the Constitution.\n\nThis is probably one of the best legal documentaries I have ever seen. When I first watched it, I had to stop because it hit too close to home and it was tear jerking. I finally found the courage to watch it again and I was very pleased with how it took our experiences and broke it down into math and economics for the world to understand.\n\nYou have probably seen it already but if you haven’t, what are you waiting for?\n\n8. Making a Murderer (2015)\n\nArea of law: Criminal Procedure, Criminal Law\n\nThis is probably one of the best legal documentaries I have ever seen. It takes a step by step dive into the meaning of being railroaded by the criminal justice system.\n\n9. The Seven Five (2015)\n\nArea of law: Criminal Law, Police\n\nI can’t speak too much about this one. Just know it is a MUST SEE!\n\n10. How to Fix a Drug Scandal (2020)\n\nArea of law: Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\nThis one will blow your mind. The psychology of some people who for for “the State” amazes me. But what amazes me even more is society’s blatant disregard for prosecutorial misconduct.\n\nI will be updating this list periodically."
