Hot Coffee Assignment As I watched the movie "Hot Coffee", I was struck by the thought-provoking insights it provided into the legal system and the various challenges and issues that it faces. This film is about Stella Liebeck, a woman of 79 years, who was severely burned when she spilt hot coffee on herself while driving. Liebeck filed a lawsuit against the fast-food chain McDonald's, claiming that the coffee was served at a dangerously high temperature. Watching the film, I found myself feeling a range of emotions. At times, I felt outraged at the way in which McDonald's disregarded the safety of its customers and continued to serve coffee at a dangerously high temperature despite receiving hundreds of complaints. I also felt a sense of sadness for Stella Liebeck and the suffering that she had endured as a result of her injury. However, the film also made me think more deeply about the legal system and the challenges and issues that it faces. The story of Stella Liebeck showed me that the legal system is not always fair and just and that there are instances where the system can be biased or flawed. This has challenged my previously held belief that the legal system is always fair and has led me to see the importance of continuing to work to reform and improve the legal system in order to ensure that it serves the needs of all individuals. One of the most significant things I have learned about the legal system as a result of watching "Hot Coffee" is the role that lawyers play in the system. I learned that lawyers are responsible for representing individuals or organizations in legal proceedings and for providing advice and counsel on legal matters. They are a vital part of the legal system and play a key role in ensuring that the rule of law is upheld, and that justice is served. However, I have also learned about the challenges that lawyers can face in the legal

system, particularly when it comes to issues of access to justice. One of the main themes that emerged for me while watching "Hot Coffee" was the importance of access to justice. The movie highlighted the challenges that individuals can face when trying to navigate the legal system, particularly if they do not have the financial resources to hire a lawyer. This has led me to see the importance of programs and initiatives that seek to increase access to justice and ensure that everyone has the opportunity to have their legal needs met. In addition to the challenges of access to justice, "Hot Coffee" also highlighted other issues with the legal system, such as role that powerful interests play in shaping the result of lawsuits. Another theme that emerged for me was role that powerful interests play in affecting the result of legal proceedings. The movie showed how the fast-food chain McDonald's was able to use its resources and influence to fight against Stella Liebeck's lawsuit, even though it was clear that the company was at fault. This has led me to see the importance of ensuring that the legal system is fair and impartial, and that justice is served for all individuals, regardless of their social or economic status. In addition to the story of Stella Liebeck, "Hot Coffee" also featured interviews with legal experts and other individuals who have been affected by the legal system. These interviews provided further insight into the challenges and issues that the legal system faces and helped to paint a more complete picture of the legal system and its impacts on society. In addition to these themes, the movie also helped me to gain a deeper understanding of the legal system and the various components that make it up, such as courts, lawyers, judges, and law enforcement agencies. It also provided insight into the processes and procedures that are involved in resolving legal disputes, such as mediation, arbitration, and litigation. Overall, watching "Hot Coffee" has been a valuable learning experience that has helped me to gain a deeper understanding of the legal system and the challenges and issues that it faces.
