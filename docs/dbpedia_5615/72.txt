Actress Julia Roberts and singer Lyle Lovett were married Sunday during a hastily arranged ceremony, her publicist said.

Lovett’s band performed “Angel Eyes” in honor of Roberts during the small church wedding in Marion, Ind., spokeswoman Nancy Seltzer said.

Roberts, 25, met Lovett, 35, when they filmed 1992’s “The Player,” Seltzer said.

It was the first marriage for both. The wedding was planned in two days, Seltzer said.

Roberts married Lovett during her three-day break from filming John Grisham’s “The Pelican Brief” in Washington, D.C., Seltzer said.

Lovett is on a national tour and was to perform with his Large Band Sunday night in Noblesville, Ind., an Indianapolis suburb.

A reception for the 75 wedding guests was scheduled before the concert, Seltzer said.

Actress Susan Sarandon and actor Tim Robbins were among the guests at St. James Lutheran Church, she said. Their 4-year-old son, Jack Henry, was the ring bearer, and actor Barry Tubb accompanied Roberts down the aisle.

Many of the guests did not learn of the wedding plans until late Thursday night.

“We were all coming in from everywhere, like Noah’s Ark,” Sarandon said in a telephone interview from the church. She had been filming Grisham’s “The Client” in Memphis, Tenn.
