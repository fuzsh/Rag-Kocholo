Julia Roberts and Lyle Lovett were married Sunday at a hastily arranged ceremony, her publicist said.

Roberts, 25, met Lovett, 35, when they filmed 1992's The Player, said her spokeswoman, Nancy Seltzer.

It was the first marriage for both. The wedding was planned in two days, Seltzer said.

Pastor Dweyth Beltz of Trinity Lutheran Church in Klein, Texas, Lyle's childhood minister, performed the ceremony.

Roberts married Lovett during her three-day break from filming John Grisham's The Pelican Brief in Washington, D.C., Seltzer said.

Lovett is on a national tour and was to perform with his Large Band on Sunday night at the Deer Creek Venue, an outdoor amphitheater in Noblesville, Ind., an Indianapolis suburb.
