        "text": "Forget her string of ever-popular romantic movies, Julia Roberts is living the real thing.\n\nThe notoriously private \"Pretty Woman\" actress, 55, took to Instagram Tuesday to mark her 21st wedding anniversary with what has seemingly become an annual post. She shared an image of herself and her husband, cinematographer Daniel Moder, 54, smooching in celebration of the date.\n\n\"21,\" she wrote with explosion emojis, adding hashtags \"#truelove #heckyeah #fromhereonout.\"\n\nRoberts shared an anniversary post last year for their 20-year anniversary. And posted again in 2021, celebrating 19 years of their legal union. \"19 years,\" the Academy Award winner captioned a selfie of the two beachside, adding red, white and blue heart emojis. \"Just getting started!\"\n\nShe also posted for their anniversary in 2020.\n\nRoberts and Moder met on the set of her film \"The Mexican\" in 2000. The two tied the knot on July 4, 2002 in Taos, New Mexico.\n\nRoberts took to Instagram last year also to celebrate Moder's birthday with an image of her husband holding a surf board. \"Happy Everything,\" she wrote, adding: \"you make my world go round.\"\n\nThe \"Eat Pray Love\" star, who's known to keep her family life private, raved to People about her marriage to Moder in 2017.\n\n\"I mean every day my husband walks in the door it's like a recurring dream,\" she told the outlet at the time. \"I'm like, 'Ah, he's back!'\"\n\n'A lot has changed': Julia Roberts doesn't think 'Pretty Woman' would be made today\n\nIn May 2019, Moder shared a sweet family photo with Roberts and their kids. He wrote: \"That pretty mama in the middle. We love you so much.\"\n\nRoberts and Moder share 18-year-old twins, daughter Hazel Patricia Moder and son Phinnaeus Walter Moder, and son Henry Daniel Moder, 16.\n\nBoth Moder and Roberts were previously married. Roberts was married to to Lyle Lovett from 1993 to 1995 and Moder was married to Vera Steimberg Moder from 1997 to 2002.\n\nContributing: Pamela Avila, Cydney Henderson"
