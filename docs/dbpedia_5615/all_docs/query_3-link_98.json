        "text": "Academy Award-winning actor Julia Roberts married her cameraman boyfriend Daniel Moder early Thursday at her 40-acre estate outside Taos, N.M.\n\nThe wedding marks Roberts' second trip down the aisle. The star of Runaway Bride and My Best Friend's Wedding was married for 21 months to country and western singer Lyle Lovett.\n\n\"Julia Roberts and Daniel Moder married during a midnight ceremony before family and friends at their home in New Mexico,\" Roberts' publicist, Marcy Engelman, told the Associated Press.\n\nA big white tent was seen on Roberts' estate Wednesday, and the Daily Mail of London reported this week that 50 guests were being flown from Los Angeles to New Mexico for a celebration at Roberts' estate. The paper said George Clooney, Roberts' co-star in Ocean's 11, was to be among them and that invitees were to wear white linen.\n\nMan who stabbed\n\nHarrison set free\n\nA paranoid schizophrenic who stabbed George Harrison on what he thought was a \"mission from God\" was conditionally released from a secure hospital Thursday. The former Beatle's family called the decision \"upsetting and insulting.\"\n\nAn independent panel including a judge, a psychiatrist and a member of the public said Michael Abram, 35, was fit to be released from the Scott Clinic, a psychiatric facility in Liverpool, northwestern England.\n\nAbram, who has a history of mental illness, told psychiatrists he stabbed Harrison on Dec. 30 1999, because he believed he was possessed by the former Beatle and was on a \"mission from God.\"\n\nAbram was accused of breaking into Harrison's home in Henley-on-Thames, west of London, and stabbing him repeatedly. He also was charged with attacking Olivia Harrison when she came to her husband's defense.\n\nHe was tried for attempted murder but acquitted in November 2000, on the grounds of insanity. A judge ordered him to be detained at a secure hospital \"without time restriction.\"\n\nHarrison died of cancer Nov. 29, at the age of 58."
