        "text": "Film icon Julia Roberts married Danny Moder in 2002, years after her first marriage to Lyle Lovett came to an end. The Steel Magnolias actress and the cinematographer decided to start a family together after tying the knot.\n\nHow Did Julia Roberts and Danny Moder Meet?\n\nJulia and Danny met in true Hollywood fashion on a film set. He was working as a cameraman on The Mexican, the 2001 movie in which she starred alongside Brad Pitt. They were both in other relationships at the time. The Oscar winner was dating Benjamin Bratt, and the entertainment mogul was married to his first wife, Vera Steimberg.\n\nSoon after they met, Julia called it quits on her relationship with Benjamin in 2001 after four years of dating. Danny was officially divorced from the makeup artist in 2002. That same year, he wed the Pretty Woman actress in a private ceremony at her ranch in Taos, New Mexico. Julia described the bliss after meeting and marrying Danny in a November 2018 interview on Gwyneth Paltrow‘s Goop podcast.\n\n“I think that first kind of real … ‘seismic shift’ was meeting Danny,” Julia said about her marriage at the time. “Getting married to Danny. That was the first, like, my life will never be the same in the most incredible, indescribable way … He truly, to this day, to this minute, is just my favorite human.”\n\nAre Julia Roberts and Danny Moder Still Together?\n\nThere is no shortage of love between Julia and Danny. They are still together and have cemented their status as one of Hollywood’s longest-running couples. In July 2022, they celebrated their 20th wedding anniversary. Julia posted a throwback photo from their wedding to show love to her hubby and mark their marriage milestone. The following year, Julia posted a rare PDA photo on Instagram to ring in their 21st anniversary.\n\nThe longtime couple has also collaborated together on multiple projects over the years. He earned an Emmy nomination for his cinematography work on The Normal Heart. Julia starred in the 2014 HBO film in a performance that blew her spouse away.\n\n“It was a challenging role,” he told The Hollywood Reporter in August 2014. “It wasn’t a sexy role, but, wow, what she brought to it, I was really impressed.”\n\nWhy Did Julia Roberts Sell Her Home?\n\nWhile the pair are still together, Julia and Danny shockingly decided to sell their San Francisco home for $11.3 million in October 2023. The sale came just three years after they initially purchased the house, causing a slew of speculation about their marriage.\n\n“He felt living in San Francisco was hurting his career because they were living so far from the action,” an insider told Closer of the surprising decision. “He was always of the belief that Julia put her career ahead of his, and he resented it but made the move just to appease Julia.”\n\nIn July 2024, sources told Closer that the longtime couple were facing some challenges in their marriage.\n\n“They’ve been through a lot of ups and downs over the years,” the insider said. “The hope is that they can find some kind of balance again between her professional and personal life. When it comes down to it, she doesn’t want her marriage to fail — nor does he.”\n\nThe source maintained that most of the frustration about moving came after Danny “missed his surfing and industry connections.”\n\n“But things don’t look so great now that they’ve settled back into the L.A. way of life,” the insider added. “She’s doing her thing, he’s doing his. They’re living separate lives. They even have multiple houses and often live apart.”\n\nHow Many Children Do They Have?\n\nIn May 2004, the duo announced that Julia was pregnant with twins. They welcomed their first two children, son Phinnaeus and daughter Hazel, on November 28, 2004. In December 2006, the doting parents shared the news that they were expecting their third child together. Their youngest son, Henry, arrived on June 18, 2007.\n\nThe Ocean’s Eleven star and the California native love spending time with their little ones and watching them grow up. Julia opened up about how she was really feeling about sending her twins off to college."
