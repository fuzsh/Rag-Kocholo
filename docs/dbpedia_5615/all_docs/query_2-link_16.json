        "text": "Four months? Three months? Forty-four days? Actually, it's four days — the shortest country music marriage didn't even last long enough to bring home a paycheck!\n\nFind out which country-friendly classic rocker was married just nine days before his wife asked for a divorce.\n\nWe also did some investigating to find a contemporary country singer whose marriage split up after just 12 days in 2010, and another union that lasted only four days in 1977. At 282 days, Carly Pearce and Michael Ray were practically married a lifetime when stacked up against Tammy Wynette and her fourth husband.\n\nGeorge Jones, Kenny Chesney, Gary Allan and Kid Rock all make this list of the shortest marriages in country music history. Many times, the abrupt end to a marriage comes after a whirlwind romance that left no time for truly getting to know one another. It's most sad when children are involved, as is the case in a handful of these short-lived marriages.\n\nIt wasn't the case for our newest two entries to the list, however. Zac Brown (about 120 days) and Billy Ray Cyrus (about 230 days) didn't make babies with their newest wives and ex-wives. Hopefully that makes for a clean split and plenty of happiness in the future for both men and their former partners.\n\nWe capped our list at two years, meaning stars who made it at least that long won't be found here. This excused several country singers, including Wynonna Judd, Willie Nelson and Lorrie Morgan, who've had several spouses, with each lasting several years. First up is the quickie wedding of the '90s — one that left Nashville and Hollywood in shock when they split."
