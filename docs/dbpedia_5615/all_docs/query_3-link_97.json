        "text": "Julia Roberts is one of the most iconic actresses of this generation, appearing in classics such as Pretty Woman, Steel Magnolias, Notting Hill and more.\n\nDuring her amazing career, she's also had her fair share of romances - and they haven't all been smooth.\n\nThe American actress has been linked to Liam Neeson, Dylan McDermott and Kiefer Sutherland.\n\nRead more:Loose Women’s Nadia Sawalha and Kaye Adams ‘couldn’t stand each other’ before their major feud\n\nHowever, she has been happily married for the last 20 years. But the path to love was a rollercoaster!\n\nHere's everything you need to know about her dramatic dating history.\n\nLiam Neeson\n\nAfter meeting on the set of the movie Satisfaction in 1987, Julia and the Irish actor struck up quite a romance, despite the fact she was 19 and he was 35. However, it didn't last and Julia was linked with another man soon after.\n\nDylan McDermott\n\nIn 1988, Julia scored herself a life changing role as Shelby Eatenton Latcherie in Steel Magnolias. While filming the movie, she worked closely with her on-screen husband, Dylan McDermott, and the pair began dating by May 1988.\n\nThe couple kept things private, but there are rumours that they got engaged during their two-year romance.\n\nKiefer Sutherland\n\nJulia met Kiefer on the set of Flatliners in 1990 and struck up a whirlwind romance. The pair were set to marry only one year after meeting in what was then seen as the wedding of millennium. The ceremony itself was set to take place on 20th Century Fox's Soundstage 14.\n\nHowever, just days before the wedding both Julia and Kiefer's publicists issued statements that their nuptials would not be going ahead. Rumours sparked that Julia had been the one to call it off, with tabloids at the time dubbing her a 'runaway bride'.\n\nHowever, that wasn't the end of the drama as Julia was pictured with Kiefer's best friend at the time, Jason Patric, on the day the wedding was due to go ahead.\n\nLyle Lovett\n\nIn 1992, Julia was swept up in a whirlwind romance once more as she tied the knot with country music star Lyle Lovett after only three weeks of dating.\n\nSadly, after nearly two years together, the couple announced their separation in 1995 by sharing a joint statement that read, “We remain close and in great support of one another.”\n\nBenjamin Bratt\n\nJulia then went on to date actor Benjamin Bratt for almost four years.\n\nHowever, they parted ways in 2001.\n\nDanny Moder\n\nJulia finally found the love of her life in Danny Moder - but it wasn't without its drama in the beginning.\n\nIn 2000, she met cinematographer Danny on the set of the film The Mexican and the two hit it off immediately. However, at the time of their meeting, he was married to makeup artist Vera Steimberg.\n\nDanny finalised his split from Vera in early 2002, and by July of the same year, married Julia.\n\nNot long after, the couple welcomed twins, Phinnaeus and Hazel, by November 2004 and had their third child, a son named Henry, in June 2007.\n\nGet the latest RSVP headlines straight to your inbox for free by signing up to our newsletter\n\nRead more:"
