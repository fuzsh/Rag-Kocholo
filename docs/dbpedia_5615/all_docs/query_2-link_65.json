        "text": "Billy Ray Cyrus and Firerose settled their divorce last week, with the Australian singer agreeing to receive as much as you and your neighbors: $0.\n\nThe tense three-month path to settlement featured wild accusations from both parties, several of which were seemingly confirmed with supporting evidence. Cyrus argued that his wife of seven months was trying to benefit from his last name, and in a social media post shared on Monday, he doubled down.\n\nFirerose (real name Johanna Hodges) legally changed her last name from Hodges to Cyrus just a couple weeks ago, the statement from his lawyers reads. On Instagram, she does go by Firerose Hodges.\n\nCyrus cited irreconcilable differences and inappropriate marital conduct as reasons for his filing in May.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, he filed for a restraining order to get her to stop using his credit card, and she accused him of abuse.\n\nThey married on Oct. 10, 2023, during a ceremony described as \"the most perfect ethereal celebration of love.\"\n\n“Mr. Cyrus feels that this validates his assertion that his ex-wife’s sole impetus for marrying him was to obtain his last name.”\n\nFirerose also accused Cyrus of manipulation and isolation, while he claimed to not know her real identity and brought up old criminal charges. Correspondence between the two parties were filed as part of divorce proceedings and audio emerged of him berating her.\n\n\"I saw before my very own eyes, everything I thought I knew about her, was a lie,\" Cyrus said on Instagram Story, explaining the audio. \"She was trying to take over my career, my life and usurp the Cyrus name for her own gain.\"\n\nRelated: 14 Shortest Marriages In Country Music History\n\nWhile Firerose will get no money, she does his credits and royalties to any songs they wrote together."
