        "text": "Carly Pearce responds to kicking fan out of her show. She called into talk with Tampa Bays Hometown Morning Krewe with J.R., Launa and Kevin about her new tour coming up. Carly just announced her Hummingbird World Tour and she has a date set for Tampa. October 24th at the Seminole Hard Rock. Tickets for the show will go on sale starting this Friday am HERE.\n\nCarly has been out with Tim McGraw opening his show, but now she is headlining shows of her own. She was recently in Detroit Lakes, MN at WE Fest when a fan was heckling her on stage. Carly stopped her show and addressed the fan in front of everyone. She had some not so nice words for the fan.\n\nCarly Pearce on kicking fan out of her show. It was just one moment she told us and she usually tolerates fans, but this one hit a nerve with her and she lost it. She agrees she should have chosen better words, but she said it just came out. She also said, if you don’t want to be at my show, then go get a beer and come back for the next act. Her exact words:\n\n“Somebody get him out of here. I do not want him at my show. Get out of my show” Pearce was filmed saying. “If you’re gonna be an a—hole, then you’re going to have to say it to me and get the f—k out of my show. I do not have time for d—ks.”\n\nOf course we had to ask Carly about this and she said the Kentucky girl came out in her and she is tired of not standing up for herself during our interview. We are obviously seeing a new side of Carly. She has released songs obviously about her divorce with Michael Ray. She has dealt with her emotions through her music, but never on stage. This was a boiling point for her, and we don’t blame her.\n\nI’ve been to Detroit Lakes, MN for WE fest, and it’s a weekend festival. People have been drinking for days. It’s also one of those show where you have a bunch of artists all day on stage.\n\nCarly’s new song is called “Truck On Fire” from her new album Hummingbird. Check out the song “My Place”, Carly told us it’s one of her favorites songs she has ever written. The other sleeper on the album is “Oklahoma”.\n\nWe can’t wait to see her at The Hard Rock. Show is on October 24th. Tickets are on sale Friday August 9th. Keep listening to win free tickets from QYK.\n\nLauna is part of Tampa Bay's Hometown Morning Krewe on 99.5 WQYK. She has been with the station for 7 years and joined J.R. and Kevin on the morning show 4 years ago. Since then, they have been nominated for not only a CMA but also an ACM. Launa has been in radio for the past 28 years and in the Tampa Bay market for 22 of those years. While working in radio, Launa has also served as an entertainment reporter on a local TV show and has hosted many charity events in the community. Using her popularity from QYK, Launa loves to help raise money for shelter animals and has been a volunteer at local shelters for years. Launa loves the community and writes articles on local news, entertainment, and events and highlights people who are shining in Tampa Bay that she knows others like her would also be interested in reading."
