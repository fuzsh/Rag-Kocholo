        "text": "In an alley in lower Manhattan, Lyle Lovett is checking out a motorcycle. He's wearing a black suit, buttoned high; his hair, formerly an \"Eraserhead\" pompadour, has now recognized the law of gravity. The motorcycle is a limited-edition Ducati, a sleek red-and-white machine with a larger engine than the standard model; there are only 50 of them in the United States. \"It has its own sound, very smooth, kind of throaty,\" Mr. Lovett says. \"Once you hear it, you'd recognize it.\"\n\nMr. Lovett has ordered his own Ducati, but he won't be picking it up until the end of his summer tour, after he performs at the Theater at Madison Square Garden on September 7. This one belongs to David Bouley, the chef-owner of the celebrated Bouley restaurant in TriBeCa, with whom Mr. Lovett regularly goes off-road riding in Texas and Mexico. One of their destinations gave its name to Mr. Lovett's sixth album, \"The Road to Ensenada,\" which has just been released. On another trip, around Mr. Lovett's hometown, Houston, the songwriter introduced the chef to Dairy Queen and barbecue.\n\nWe had every different kind of barbecue,\" Mr. Lovett says. \"Brisket, pork, beef rib, sausage, chicken. My dad's a good barbecuer, and David asked my dad if he would come up and barbecue when he opens his new place next year. He also asked him about his sauce. But no barbecue chef in the world will tell you what's in the sauce.\"\n\nOn \"The Road to Ensenada,\" there are wryly chauvinistic songs about Texas (\"Don't Touch My Hat\"), cheerful songs about meeting women (\"Her First Mistake\") and bleak ones about breakups. It's the first album of new songs to be released by Mr. Lovett since his 21-month marriage to Julia Roberts, which generated a tabloid frenzy and has left him a little like his archetypal barbecue chef: hospitable but circumspect about a few secret ingredients.\n\nDuring his marriage, in 1993, he recorded \"I Love Everybody,\" a collection of songs from the early 1980's, when he was playing clubs around Texas. \"Because of the timing in my personal life, I thought it would be more interesting to do things that were declared to be old,\" he says. He doesn't have to point out that no one could infer anything from decade-old songs.\n\nNot that Mr. Lovett was ever exactly straightforward. On the six albums he has made in the last 10 years, Mr. Lovett has concocted an ingeniously ambiguous persona matched to polymorphous music. He made his first albums through MCA Records' country division in Nashville, but he never settled into one genre. True to his Texas roots, he dips into Americana from gospel to big-band jazz. Through the years, his band has grown into the Large Band, which includes everything from pedal steel guitar to cello to rhythm-and-blues horns. He treats the band as two or three interlocking groups, playing one song as a country ballad, another as a blues, another as earnest singer-songwriter pop or western swing.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
