However, when I saw him many moons ago on a PBS special (I think it was PBS) with Rodney Crowell, Willie Nelson (I believe!) and a few other singer songwriters, my respect of his craft went up ten fold. He sang the song \"I like eggs over easy, with corn tortillas\" solo with just his guitar. Man oh man, hit me right in the heart....amazing.\n\nStraydogger\n\nTele-Holic\n\nJoined\n\nMar 26, 2017\n\nPosts\n\n921\n\nAge\n\n72\n\nLocation\n\nWestern Pa.\n\nJulia Roberts was a big fan...........for a while.\n\nCountry singer-songwriter Lyle Lovett married actress Julia Roberts after three weeks of dating. The two met while on the set of Robert Altman’s 1992 film “The Player.” At the time, Roberts was 25 years old and had a history of short-lived romances. Lovett was 35 years old and had never been married.
