        "text": "Julia Roberts is one of the biggest names in Hollywood and easily one of the most popular actresses of her generation. With hits like Notting Hill and Pretty Woman and an Academy Award under her belt, she's pretty much cemented herself as a celeb icon.\n\nThough she's currently enjoying her role as a wife and mother, she had a few notable star-studded relationships over the years. Did you know that included a marriage to Grammy-winning country singer Lyle Lovett?\n\nIn early June of 1993, Roberts and the country star were introduced for the first time by mutual friends. This was just two years after the actress called off her wedding with on-again-off-again love Kiefer Sutherland. She apparently had already been a fan of Lovett's music, so it was an instantaneous connection. The new couple shocked the world when they tied the knot on June 27 after just a few weeks of dating. Roberts was in the middle of filming The Pelican Brief, but she took the weekend off for the occasion.\n\nAll kinds of celebrities gathered for their nuptials at St. James Lutheran Church in the small town of Marion, Indiana. Between Lovett's touring and Roberts' filming, they pulled off planning the whole thing within 72 hours. Though everyone was certainly confused by how fast the union happened, there were some theories.\n\n\"I think Julia's tired of the Hollywood pretense,\" Tanya Tucker told People at the time. \"Maybe she's ready to be treated like a goddess, the way Lyle will.\"\n\nThat's one point of view. Regardless of how unconventional their marriage was, they did their best to make it work. Lovett kept his place in Texas and Roberts kept hers in New York City. They also shared a home in Los Angeles together. Roberts raved about her new hubby in interviews.\n\n\"He's really a tremendous man, and he's shown a great deal of courage in marrying me,\" Roberts told the New York Times in 1993. \"We're pretending to be a normal couple. We get up in the morning and go to our jobs. He goes to the studio to cut a record, I go to the studio to make a movie.\"\n\nUnfortunately, after less than two years of marriage, the couple announced their separation in 1995. But Roberts doesn't regret their brief time together. They have reportedly even remained friends over the years, claiming that career demands were what tore them apart.\n\n\"Mistake, no. Miscalculation, yes,\" Roberts told New York's Daily News according to People. \"Never a mistake. Too many great things came out of it. We have this great shared experience that never had any nasty moments. What we had doesn't come close to the mistake category.\"\n\nFollowing their breakup, Roberts dated fellow actor Benjamin Bratt. During their relationship, she met a cameraman, Daniel Moder, on the set of her film The Mexican. At the time, Moder was also in a relationship with his current wife, Vera Steimberg. While Roberts and Bratt had been in a serious relationship for four years, she felt like she had found the one with future husband Danny Moder.\n\nRead More: Mandy Moore + Taylor Goldsmith: Inside the 'This is Us' Star's Real Life Love Story\n\nModer divorced his wife and he and Roberts said \"I do\" on July 4, 2002 at her Taos, New Mexico ranch. At the time, tabloids tried to tarnish the image of America's sweetheart. But the couple proved everyone wrong and remains committed to each other to this day. They recently celebrated their 18th wedding anniversary.\n\nOver the years, they have welcomed multiple children together â€” twins Hazel and Phinnaeus and their youngest son Henry Daniel. While they are quiet about their home life with their children, you will regularly see the cinematographer hit the red carpet with his wife. In a recent interview on the Goop Podcast with Gwyneth Paltrow, Roberts said that her husband is still her favorite person.\n\nAs for Lovett, he met April Kimble in 1997 and it seemed like the stars were aligned for him as well. He proposed in 2003, and after an incredibly long engagement, they were married on February 4, 2017 in his beloved home state of Texas."
