        "text": "The Road to Ensenada is in my Top Ten best songs. Was listening to it a few days back. Apparently this was during his time with her. Don’t know if it’s true and the song is open to interpretation. Nevertheless it’s a gorgeous song.\n\nHe likes em YOUNG. She was in her prime and settled for a tall ugly weirdo and then proceeded to spend as much time away from him as possible lol.\n\n[quote] I recall seeing a picture and she was barefoot. Hick!\n\nTrue Georgia trash. You can’t bleach it out.\n\nI remember when they got divorced, My single survival teacher took our class to the grocery store, and as we got to the checkout she was explaining Impulse buys and saw me glancing at a people magazine with the \"shocking details\" She said to me, I always thought you were the National inquirer kind, which seemed to me a thinly veiled way to say, Little homosexual boy.\n\nAh man r28 i just want say I've had multiple occasions like that where completely unnecessary I feel like people have taken an opportunity to tell me the they knew. Like that. It was terrible for how it was handled but I also understood the type that would do it. I'm sorry for the discomfort because I've totally gotten it. Even as an adult where I don't care and some people just need to go there.\n\nThank you r28, I am sorry you got those jabs too, I was getting shit like that from the time I was seven years old.\n\nHis second marriage came after a 14-year engagement, so I guess he wanted to be damn sure it was going to work out better than the first one did. They have boy/girl twins, like Julia does.\n\nThere's no way she was still a virgin at age 19.\n\nShe probably lost it at 10\n\nAt her best she was cute, but she never has been stunning. Someone was getting paid a pretty penny to put her on the Sexiest Female lists.\n\nShe's never been in the league of an Audrey Hepburn, Faye Dunaway or Ali MacGraw to name a few. And she's aged badly."
