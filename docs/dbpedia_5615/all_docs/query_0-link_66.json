        "text": ">OK, so I open the paper this morning and on page 2 in the shorts is a picture\n\n>of our man Lyle Lovett and Julia Roberts and the story reads\n\n>\n\n>Julia Roberts and singer Lyle Lovett were married Sunday at a hastily\n\n>arranged ceremony in New York, her publicist said.\n\nActually, the ceremony was in Indiana, where his tour happened to be at the\n\ntime. She flew in from Washington DC, where she's filming a movie.\n\n>Lovett's band performed \"Angel Eyes\" in honor of the actress during the\n\nIn a \"Texas Monthly\" article on Lovett, he said that one night, at dinner,\n\nhis girlfriend asked him why he never wrote a song about her. He grabbed\n\na napkin and wrote, \"She's got big red lips, she's got big brown eyes./When\n\nshe treats me right, it's a big surprise.\" Julia's got the big red lips,\n\nalright; what color are her eyes?\n\n>Get down with yo bad self, Lyle. I don't know about you guys, but I'm\n\n>going to start combing my hair straight up too.\n\nI dunno. I was kinda disappointed, myself. She has a tendency to fall\n\nfor her leading men, from what I hear. I just hope it works out.\n\nOn a related note, when Lyle was on Late Night a couple of weeks ago,\n\nhe sang \"I've been to Kansas.\" He changed the line \"Allison's got\n\nlittle ones/what hate to go to school\" to \"Fiona's got little...\" He\n\nalso did this in concert here the following week (don't miss it, BTW,\n\nthe boy and his band played 2.5 hours, following 1 hour of Roseanne\n\nCash), and mentioned that Fiona had asked him to do some other particular\n\nsong. I figured it was his girlfriend's name. Could it be some sort\n\nof nickname for Julia?\n\n--\n\n==============================================================================\n\nFrank Irwin | Poker addiction sign #29:\n\nVmark Software, Inc. | You offer to help a friend finish shingling his\n\nirwin%uvm...@merk.com | roof so that he'll go to Foxwoods the next day.\n\nAn interesting note here: at the LL concert in New York this past\n\nTuesday, he replaced the name \"Allison\" in \"I've Been to Memphis\" with\n\n\"Fiona.\" Later, in an intro to a song, he talked about (sorry, I\n\ndon't remember the precise wording) a very special person named\n\n\"Fiona.\"\n\nSounds like he was changing a name that wasn't Julia to another name\n\nthat wasn't Julia so that he could talk about Julia without people\n\nknowing. Either that, or there's someone else (mother, niece, etc.)\n\nnamed Fiona to whom he's referring.\n\nBut I digress. The really important question is: does _anyone_ know\n\nthe name of the cellist touring in the Large Band currently? The guy\n\nis amazing, and I'd love to find out if he's recorded elsewhere.\n\nThanks for any tips you can provide.\n\nStephen Springer (s...@nynexst.com)\n\nIn article <1993Jun28.2...@nynexst.com> s...@nynexst.com (Steve Springer) writes:\n\n>\n\n>But I digress.

I don't have anywhere near the Austin collection I'd\n\nlike to have, but here's what my HyperCard stack tells me Hagen's done\n\nin the last decade or so that I've found:\n\nTommy Elskes King of Dixie Amazing\n\nAlejandro Escovedo Gravity Watermelon\n\nEmily Kaitz What You See Is What You Get self-released\n\nShoulders Hungry Man's Dance self-released\n\nShoulders Love Is My Crime self-released\n\nTwo Nice Girls Chloe Liked Olivia Rough Trade\n\nSusan Voelz 13 Ribs self-released\n\nOn this list, I'd particularly recommend Susan Voelz' 13 Ribs (which\n\nan indie just rereleased; afraid I can't remember which), Escovedo's\n\nGravity, and the two Shoulders releases. If I remember correctly, Hagen\n\nplays with Shoulders when he isn't touring with Lovett (I know I've\n\nseen him with Shoulders, though on New Year's Eve '89-'90). Voelz and\n\nEscovedo's releases are much in the style in which Hagen soloed during\n\nLyle's show, while Shoulders is Austin's top alternative band (almost\n\nalways voted #1 in any category they qualify for) and a real treat.\n\nEscovedo's release should be available pretty readily; Watermelon gets\n\ngood distribution. The others, if they're available at all (the two\n\nShoulders tapes go back a few years), are probably best found at Austin's\n\nWaterloo Records, (512) 474-2500.\n\nBob\n\nbobs...@world.std.com\n\n\"It's getting harder and harder to act weird\" -- Bill Griffith via Zippy"
