I can kind of see how he could be super charming, but when you're courting america's sweetheart and so incredibly famous, it's just not enough to make it last imo.\n\nplus, he's tall, so we know that has an effect.\n\nEdited at 2020-12-30 06:13 pm (UTC)\n\nHe looks better as an older man.\n\nI saw him play live a few times, he's incredible. Very dry sense of humour too. One-Eyed Fiona (JR's middle name) gives a bit of insight into their relationship btw (including the line 'her brother won't like you, he just might bite you').\n\nJulia was like a serial Casanova-type when her career first blew up.

I remember when they were the it couple of British film and theatre and how shocking it was when they broke up. She traded way up, though.\n\nI think because they were in Much Ado About Nothing, fans of that movie remember the marriage. Myself included, I love that movie.\n\n(no subject) - crimps4 Expand\n\nthey make so much sense as a couple lol shame that he’s an ass\n\nThey worked on lots of things together when they were married. The cheating/break up was a huge deal.\n\nEmma upgraded to Greg Wise though, she's the real winner here.\n\nOmg i was a huge fan of both (and their general circle of actor friends, i.e. the cast of “Peter’s Friends”) and haven’t been able to stand seeing any of his movies since. My high school even had a Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson fan club (back in the early 90s) and we were all devastated when they broke up.\n\n(no subject) - sisterruth Expand\n\nI read the Daily Express all through my late 80s early 90s childhood and they will always be Ken & Em to me. The Express had a FIELD DAY when Ken hooked up with Helena Bonham Carter - it was referenced on every page of that day's issue including the cartoon and probably Beachcomber.\n\nDisclaimer: The Daily Express was and is trash\n\nI just watched Much Ado About Nothing for the first time recently and their chemistry was off the charts.. they were married at the time. It was a fun movie.. really enjoyed it.\n\nAlso, it blows my mind that he's the same guy in Wild Wild West who plays the evil Loveless. I knew he looked familiar!!\n\nEdited at 2020-12-30 08:56 pm (UTC)\n\nI don't watch Dead Again too often, but when I do I spend several moments hating him for their divorce.\n\n(no subject) - dude_isotopes Expand\n\ni only know about this because as a child anytime i watched harry potter my mom would always say \"lockhart and trelawney were married in real life\"\n\nEmma seems so lovely, the story about how she threatened to leave a movie after hearing that an executive told Hayley Atwell she needed to lose weight was such a power move. Kenneth comes off as such a narcissist by always casting himself as leads in all of his movies lmao.\n\nEmma. What on god's green earth is on your head?!\n\ni remember this only because of her saying that scene in love actually where she breaks down was easy to film\n\nMy mom always tells a story about how I found a magazine cover with Julia Roberts and that guy on it and asked her a bunch of questions about it. I finally got frustrated and shouted \"but how can pretty girls marry ugly boys?!\"\n\nAsking the important questions, tbh!!\n\nI remember Lyle Lovett and Julia Roberts as a kid because my mom was always like,\n\nwhen she saw them together lol\n\nmost energy she ever spent on Julia Roberts until her scandal~\n\nEdited at 2020-12-30 05:34 pm (UTC)\n\nUnrelated, but wow he's had a lot of work done.\n\nI was living at home when they got married. My mom loved to drop news on me to wake me up. This bit went:\n\n*knock, knock*\n\n“Sweetie, wake up. Oh, and Julia Roberts got married.”\n\n**mumble, mumble**\n\n“That’s nice.” (Almost back to sleep)\n\n“To Lyle Lovett.”\n\nI sat up straight in bed and said, “What the fuck!”\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous) Expand\n\n(no subject) - katya2032 Expand\n\nScarlett Johansson and Ryan Reynolds still seems super random to me\n\nRyan Reynolds and Alanis Morissette made less sense to me.\n\nCanadians be candianaizing\n\nI've noticed there's a whole generation of Marvel fans - that came up with the MCU - that have no idea Deadpool and Black Widow were married. Wild to me, since they were also tied into that hacking scandal that was a huge deal.\n\nshe looks so stunning and chic here i have tears in my eyes... those earrings are amazing and i don’t usually like big earrings\n\nCicely looks amazing.\n\nmy brain instantly went, \"bitch you don't deserve her\" looking at this\n\nDoes anyone deserve the goddess that is Cicely Tyson though?\n\ngoddamn this photo is gorgeous\n\nJohnny Lee Miller was hot\n\nVirginia Madsen and Antonio Sabato jr\n\nDrew Barrymore and Balthazar Getty\n\nJason Priestley and Robyn Lively\n\nColin Hanks and Busy Philipps\n\nPenelope Ann Miller and Seal\n\nDon't forget Penelope and the man in my icon 😄\n\nI forgot about Colin and Busy but honestly I think they make sense together\n\nLMFAO AND TODAY is the day I learned that Balthazar Getty had a nose job!!!!!! DAYUM!!!! he had half of it cut off!!!!\n\nThat’s so funny because I was looking at that pic and was like “hmm this guy on Tik Tok looks like him but with a nose job” lol\n\ndrew looks really lovely in that pic\n\nI thought Antonio was Mark Harmon for a second lol\n\ni miss women having their natural curls like virginia. now it's all the same boring gentle wave.\n\ncolin and busy's HEADS\n\nI had no idea George Clooney was married back in the 90s\n\nyeah when i found out, i was like huh?! hollywood always made it seem like that man had never been married before lol\n\nIn articles for like most of the '90s they cite that marriage as the reason he was anti-marriage for years. Supposedly he supported (encouraged?) his male friends divorces & had a collection of their wedding rings.\n\n(no subject) - ghostsaddle Expand"
