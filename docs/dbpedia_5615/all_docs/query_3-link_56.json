        "text": "In July 2002 Julia Roberts wed Danny Moder at a ceremony in New Mexico. Two decades later and the loved-up duo remain one of Hollywood’s longest standing couples. The secret? Lots and lots of kissing according to the Pretty Woman actress.\n\nIn a conversation with E! News this week, Robert admitted that the secret to marriage success was, “Making out. Lots of making out.” Sign us up, not with Julia… our own partners I mean. The actress was promoting her new rom-com Ticket to Paradise. In an earlier interview it seemed that all this supposed practice didn’t make a kissing scene with co-star George Clooney any easier.\n\nSpeaking to the New York Times, Clooney admitted that it took “like six months” to get right.” “Yeah. I told my wife, ‘It took 80 takes,’” Clooney told the publication. “She was like, ‘What the hell?’. It took 79 takes of us laughing and then the one take of us kissing,” Roberts added. Clooney responded, “Well, we had to get it right.”\n\nRoberts has been married once before, to country singer Lyle Lovett in 1993 with whom she met just three weeks before the wedding. They split in 1995. The actress has also been linked to the likes of Liam Neeson and Matthew Perry.\n\nSpeaking to Gwyneth Paltrow in 2018, Roberts admitted that she had never met someone like Moder. “I think that first kind of real … ‘seismic shift’ was meeting Danny,” she said. “Getting married to Danny. That was the first, like, my life will never be the same in the most incredible, indescribable way.”\n\nThe couple welcomed twins, Phinneas and Hazel, in 2004. They also share a 15-year-old son, Henry.\n\nWe love, love!"
