        "text": "Julia Roberts thinks she was lucky to find fame before starting a family.\n\nThe 56-year-old actress shot to global stardom thanks to her role in Pretty Woman in 1990, three years before she married her country musician first husband Lyle Lovett, 66, who she divorced in 1995.\n\nShe is now settled with her second spouse, cinematographer Daniel Moder, 54, after they got hitched in 2002, and with whom she has three children â€” twins Hazel and Phinneas, 19, and 16-year-old son Henry.\n\nJulia told British Vogue about how she is thankful she was already an established actress by the time she met Danny: \"Well, I think that the luckiest aspect of my work life/family life is that the success of my work life came earlier.\n\n\"So by the time I had the success of my family life and had a husband and children who wanted to stay home, I had been working for 18 years.\n\n\"And so I felt that I had the luxury. I didn't have to pick one or the other. You didn't have to make the choice. Of either/or. So it was easy to pause work life to nurture my home life.\n\n\"And so, because I have girlfriends who were having to juggle being at work and having to go into the bathroom, and you know, get out that breast pump, I sort of went through that with them by proxy. To be allowed the luxury of staying home and being with my family, I had a deep gratitude for that time.\"\n\nDespite saying she loved staying at home when she was raising her kids, Julia stressed she thinks it's important her children saw her going back to work.\n\nShe added when asked if family always comes before her career: \"Yes, of course. But then there's also something to my kids seeing that my creative life is meaningful to me.\n\n\"I want them to understand that. Going outside of the house and being creative is really important and vital. And it doesn't take away from my love of home. It's another level of my life.\""
