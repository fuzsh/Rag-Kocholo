See this page for the connection between them.\n\nWe use the connection to AJ by blood, marriage, or adoption to indicate that a person is connected to the six million ancestor profiles on WikiTree that are linked to each other. There are over nine million profiles in total, so we love to see everyone linked to the global tree in some way.\n\nI don't see ancestor profiles here for the Aaron and John H. Roberts you mentioned. I hope you'll add them to WikiTree. You might like to start a new G2G question about them to collaborate with the many generous and knowledgeable genealogists here on WikiTree!"
