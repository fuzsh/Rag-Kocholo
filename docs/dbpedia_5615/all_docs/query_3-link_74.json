She’s not just a Pretty Woman; she’s a pretty wealthy woman\n\nJulia Roberts Husbands\n\nJulia Roberts has experienced the highs and lows of love with her two spouses:\n\n1. Lyle Lovett (m. 1993; div. 1995): Julia walked down the aisle with country singer Lyle Lovett on June 25, 1993, in a ceremony held at St. James Lutheran Church in Marion, Indiana. However, their marriage hit a few sour notes, and they separated in March 1995, concluding with a divorce.\n\n2. Daniel Moder (m. 2002): Love found its way back to Julia when she met cameraman Daniel Moder on the set of “The Mexican” in 2000. Their romance blossomed, although there were whispers of husband-stealing since Daniel was previously married to Vera Steimberg.

Together, they have three children—a daughter and a son born in November 2004, and another son born in June 2007. It seems like the third time’s the charm for Julia and Daniel!\n\nJulia Roberts Height\n\nRoberts is approximately 5 feet 9 inches (175 cm) tall. She stands tall both in the world of Hollywood and in stature\n\nJulia Roberts Movies\n\nNow, despite Julia’s parents briefly running an actors’ workshop in her childhood, she didn’t exactly start her acting journey with a manual. In fact, she packed her bags and headed to the Big Apple after high school, armed with ambition but zero formal training. She even tried her hand at modeling but ended up being more runway roadkill than catwalk queen.\n\nJulia’s debut film role came as a family favor, courtesy of her older brother, actor Eric Roberts, who recommended her for a bit part as his on-screen sister in the delayed-release drama “Blood Red” (1989). Talk about family connections!\n\nThings picked up when Julia starred in “Steel Magnolias” (1989), rubbing shoulders with seasoned actresses like Shirley MacLaine and Sally Field. Her performance as the diabetic daughter even snagged her an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nThen came the mega-hit “Pretty Woman” in 1990, where Julia played a spirited prostitute in a fairy-tale romance with Richard Gere’s business tycoon. The movie not only made her a household name but also earned her a second Academy Award nomination.\n\nThroughout the ’90s, Julia kept the hits coming with films like “Flatliners” (1990), “Sleeping with the Enemy” (1991), “The Pelican Brief” (1993), “My Best Friend’s Wedding” (1997), and more. Her personal life occasionally stole the limelight, especially when her marriage to singer Lyle Lovett crashed and burned in 1995.\n\nIn 1999, Julia dazzled us with not one but two romantic comedies – “Notting Hill” and “Runaway Bride,” the latter reuniting her with Richard Gere.\n\nEnter the new millennium, and Julia’s not just acting; she’s producing too! Her production company, Shoelace Productions, kicked off in 2000. Oh, and she commanded a cool $20 million for her lead role in “Erin Brockovich,” a real-life tale of a clerk fighting for justice against a polluting utility company.\n\nAdding a dash of versatility, Julia voiced Charlotte the spider in the animated “Charlotte’s Web” (2006) and made her Broadway debut in “Three Days of Rain” in 2006, sharing the stage with Paul Rudd and Bradley Cooper.\n\nThe 2010s saw Julia in “Eat Pray Love” (2010) and teaming up with Tom Hanks again for “Larry Crowne” (2011).

She also graced the silver screen in “Secret in Their Eyes” (2015), “Mother’s Day” (2016), and “Money Monster” (2016), showing us she’s not just a rom-com queen.\n\nJulia’s charity game is strong, supporting UNICEF, the American Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund, and even narrating wildlife documentaries to raise awareness.\n\nIn 2022, she brought her star power to TV in “Gaslit” and reunited with George Clooney for “Ticket to Paradise.” Julia Roberts, proving she’s not just a pretty woman but a powerhouse of talent and heart.\n\nJulia Roberts’s Romance, Husband, and Children\n\nJulia Roberts, the queen of on-screen romances, had her fair share of off-screen love stories. In the game of romantic roulette, she danced with actors like Jason Patric, Liam Neeson, Kiefer Sutherland, Dylan McDermott, and even had a fling with the witty Matthew Perry. Things got so serious with Sutherland that they almost pulled off the ultimate magic trick—making a wedding disappear. Alas, three days before the grand “I do,” the disappearing act happened, leaving the wedding cake wondering where everyone went on June 11, 1991.\n\nThen, in a plot twist fit for a country song, Julia said “I do” to country singer Lyle Lovett on June 25, 1993, at St. James Lutheran Church in Marion, Indiana. However, their love song hit a sour note, and they parted ways in March 1995, closing the chapter on their musical matrimony.\n\nJulia took a breather before diving back into the dating pool, where she swam with actor Benjamin Bratt from 1998 to 2001. But wait, there’s more drama on this reel! While filming “The Mexican” in 2000, she met cameraman Daniel Moder. Sparks flew, but there was a hitch—Daniel was still hitched to Vera Steimberg. Accusations of husband-stealing echoed through the Hollywood hills. The plot thickened when Moder filed for divorce, and after the legal dust settled, he and Julia exchanged vows on July 4, 2002, at her ranch in Taos, New Mexico. Together, they created a blockbuster family with twins, a daughter and a son born in November 2004, and another little star born in June 2007; Hazel, Phinnaeus, and Henry\n\nJulia Roberts Daughter\n\nJulia Roberts and her partner in crime, Danny Moder, have a pint-sized partner in mischief —18-year-old daughter, Hazel Moder. Yep, she’s the captain of the teenage eye-rolls and a connoisseur of Snapchat filters.\n\nBut wait, there’s more! The Roberts-Moder clan isn’t a solo act. Alongside Hazel, they’ve got Phinnaeus, the witty wordsmith, and Henry, the mischief manager. It’s a three-ring circus of family fun where bedtime stories turn into epic adventures, and snack time is a serious business negotiation.\n\nTogether, they form the Roberts-Moder trio, the unstoppable force of laughter and chaos. Who needs a reality show when you’ve got this comedy gold at home?"
