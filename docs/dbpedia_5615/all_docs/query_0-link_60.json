        "text": "Julia Roberts Marries Cameraman in New Mexico\n\nThu Jul 4,11:27 AM ET\n\nBy David Bennett\n\nTAOS, New Mexico (Reuters) - Oscar-winning actress Julia Roberts began her Fourth of July celebration with fireworks, marrying movie cameraman Daniel Moder on Thursday in a star-studded midnight ceremony at her sprawling ranch in New Mexico.\n\n\"I'm confirming that Julia Roberts has married Daniel Molder, but that's all we're saying for now,\" Roberts' publicist, Marcy Engleman, told Reuters.\n\nThe 34-year-old Roberts, who has been married once before to offbeat country singer Lyle Lovett, fell for the married Moder after meeting him two years ago on the set of \"The Mexican, released last year and co-starring Brad Pitt.\n\nLast month Moder, 33, left his wife of five years -- make-up artist Vera Steinberg -- to be with Roberts.\n\nAn invitation was intercepted by reporters on Wednesday stating that an annual barbecue at Roberts' ranch was planned. All invited guests, including actors George Clooney and Brad Pitt, were asked to wear white linen.\n\nEngleman said the wedding was attended by \"close friends and family.\"\n\nThe wedding took place shortly after midnight, possibly to avoid the prying eyes of news media camping outside the $2 million, 40-acre estate in the tiny community of Arroyo Seco just outside the trendy mountain town of Taos in northern New Mexico.\n\nA large white tent could be seen on the property, but bride, groom, and guests remained out of sight.\n\n----------------\n\nI believe the guy just got a divorce-I read that it was very messy..obviously his wife was very upset, and refused to grant him a divorce for quite a while.\n\nuh-huh, yeah sure....\n\nI think her marriage will last about as long as J-Lo's last one did...less than a year. What is this, her third marriage?\n\ndoes anyone else find it really weird that when well known (or not so well known) couples who have been dating like, forever, break up and then very shortly thereafter, get married to different people??? WTF is up with that? Desperation? Rebounding? Spite? I mean, Ben Bratt got married to some other chick a mere 3 months after he and Julia broke up....\n\nthen everyone wonders why these things don't \"work out\"...sheesh....\n\nRe: uh-huh, yeah sure....\n\nDiscoteque said:\n\ndoes anyone else find it really weird that when well known (or not so well known) couples who have been dating like, forever, break up and then very shortly thereafter, get married to different people???

And didn't Tom Cruise hook up with Penelope Cruz just a tiny bit after his divorce? I really don't understand celebrities and their relationships/marriages. Maybe they just don't take them as seriously because they don't have to worry about money and stuff like that."
