The wedding was planned in two days, Seltzer said.\n\nPastor Dweyth Beltz of Trinity Lutheran Church in Klein, Texas, Lyle's childhood minister, performed the ceremony.\n\nRoberts married Lovett during her three-day break from filming John Grisham's The Pelican Brief in Washington, D.C., Seltzer said.\n\nLovett is on a national tour and was to perform with his Large Band on Sunday night at the Deer Creek Venue, an outdoor amphitheater in Noblesville, Ind., an Indianapolis suburb.\n\n_ Staff writer Terry Tomalin contributed to this report."
