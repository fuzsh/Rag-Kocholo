Their statement emphasized that they would remain close and support one another.\n\nRoberts later stated in 1999 that her marriage with Lovett was not a mistake but rather a \"miscalculation,\" considering the numerous positive occurrences that followed. Additionally, she emphasized that their split was \"ridiculously amicable.\"\n\nLyle Lovett and Julia Roberts attend \"The Pelican Brief\" Westwood Premiere on December 13, 1993, at the Mann Bruin Theatre in Westwood, California. | Source: Getty Images\n\nShe went on to date several Hollywood A-listers, including Liam Neeson and Dylan McDermott.
