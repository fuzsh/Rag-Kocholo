        "text": "Julia Roberts and Lyle Lovett are separating 21 months after their surprise wedding.\n\n``We remain close and in great support of one another,'' the 27-year-old Roberts and Lovett, 37, said in a statement released Tuesday.\n\nRoberts and Lovett were married June 27, 1993, at a church ceremony in Marion, Ind. The ``Pretty Woman'' actress met the bristle-haired Lovett when they filmed 1992's ``The Player.''\n\nIt was the first marriage for both, and the couple didn't have any children.\n\nBrigitte Nielsen, Stallone's last certified wife, is expecting. You'll recall she had a kid awhile back with Mark Gastineau, football star turned wrestler turned ghost. Nielsen's husband is Raoul Meyer, a race-car driver.\n\nby CNB"
