        "text": "Lyle Pearce Lovett is an American country singer, songwriter, and actor.\n\nLyle Lovett married April Kimble in 2017.\n\nThe couple has been together since 1997.\n\nLyle Lovett married April Kimble in 2017, the same year they welcomed their twins. The couple, who have been together since 1997, value their privacy and have shared little about their family life. Lovett’s 2022 album, 12th of June, named after their children’s birth date, offers glimpses into their life. The song “Her Loving Man” is a tribute to Kimble, highlighting her wisdom and their enduring love.\n\nLovett and Kimble met in 1997 and got engaged in 2003. Lovett was previously married to Julia Roberts from 1993 to 1995. The couple’s relationship remained private, but in 2022, actress Holland Taylor shared a photo of them attending her play in Austin, Texas.\n\nThe twins’ birth in 2017 significantly influenced Lovett’s album, 12th of June. In interviews, Lovett expressed gratitude for experiencing fatherhood later in life, emphasizing the joy and fulfillment it brings. He shared with Billboard and The Washington Post how being a father has enriched his life, despite nearing 60 when his children were born.\n\nLovett’s home in east Texas, where his great-great-grandfather settled in the 1850s, holds deep meaning for him. He aims to keep it intact and teach his children about their heritage. His song “Pants Is Overrated,” inspired by his then-2-year-olds, reflects his playful take on parenting.\n\nOverall, Lovett’s latest work is a heartfelt homage to his family, particularly Kimble and their twins, encapsulating his love and dedication."
