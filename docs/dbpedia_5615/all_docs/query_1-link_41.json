        "text": "Actress Julia Roberts is known for her long-term marriage to Daniel Moder. But did you know she was actually married once before in the 1990s?\n\nIn 1993, Roberts tied the knot with musician Lyle Lovett. However, the couple quickly ended their union less than two years later in 1995. What went wrong?\n\nClick through the gallery here for a look at Roberts and Lovett's marriage and why they divorced in 1995.\n\nJulia Roberts was the star of the '90s after her breakout role in Pretty Woman. And, just after the film, Roberts met a new love while shooting The Player in 1992. It was Lyle Lovett, the popular country musician.\n\nThey started dating the next year and got married in June 1993 after just three weeks of dating. But the sudden marriage would last just 21 months...\n\nDespite raving about each other in public, Roberts and Lovett divorced in March 1995. They released only a brief statement that read: \"We remain close and in great support of each other.\"\n\nSoon after, a revealing article in People magazine broke down what went wrong. It noted they were both \"on the rebound from failed romances\" when they met. They also married after a very brief three weeks together, which was followed by virtually no time together.\n\nHere's what happened: After the wedding, Roberts resumed her film shoots while Lovett returned to touring. They were said to never spend more than a week at a time together, and Roberts lived in New York separately from Lovett in Texas.\n\nThere were even scandalous moments that foreshadowed the split, too. Once in 1994, they were caught staying at separate residences while in New York at the same time. Soon after, both Roberts and Lovett were seen spending time with different people, though they denied that anything was awry.\n\nRoberts and Lovett publicly insisted nothing was wrong, but they finally divorced in March 1995. The consensus is that the distance caused by their separate careers broke down the marriage â€” perhaps made worse by the rushed wedding.\n\nStill, the couple never expressed ill will toward one another afterward. The year of the divorce, Roberts even said: \"It's actually ridiculously amicable. You'd think people who could be that nice to each other would probably be a couple, but it just sort of wasn't the way it was intended to be.\"\n\nBoth Roberts and Lovett have been in long-term relationships since the split, as well. Julia has been happily married to Daniel Moder since 2002, while Lyle married wife April Kimble in 2017 after 20 years together. So, everything seems to have worked out for the best, even if Julia and Lyle wasn't meant to be.\n\nREAD MORE: Through the Years with Julia Roberts"
