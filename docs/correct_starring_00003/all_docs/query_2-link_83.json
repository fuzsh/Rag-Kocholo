        "text": "Fans have been itching for a revenge-soaked follow up to Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill two-parter for years, really ever since the opening scene of Vol. 1 where Uma Thurman's Bride character talks to the young daughter of the freshly-murdered Vivica A. Fox's Vernita Green and tells her \"When you grow up, if you still feel raw about it, I'll be waiting.\"\n\nNaturally, this leaves room for a Kill Bride or Kill Beatrix movie where Vernita's daughter hunts down her mother's killer. It's a project that that Tarantino and Thurman still discuss possibly doing to this day.\n\nEven back in 2004, Tarantino was raring to go for the sequel, saying \"The star will be Vernita Green’s daughter, Nikki. I’ve already got the whole mythology: Sofie Fatale [Julie Dreyfus] will get all of Bill’s money. She’ll raise Nikki, who’ll take on the Bride. Nikki deserves her revenge every bit as much as the Bride deserved hers.”\n\nRecently though, while talking about Kill Bill sequels and/or reboot possibilities with NME, Vivica A. Fox mentioned how'd she'd love to see Zendaya play Nikki. \"Zendaya! How hot would that be?\" she said. \"And that would probably green light this project. Because her and Uma are both very tall, and it would just be kick-butt, and I love her.”\n\n“Hopefully now we can put that out, like ‘Tarantino, cast Zendaya!’ And spark his interest to put it on the fast track.\"\n\nSo what do you think about this casting? Would you like to watch Zendaya v. Uma Thurman? In a bloody, stabby battle for Kill Bill supremacy? Also, would you like this to be Tarantino's tenth and final film as the director has said many times that he plans on only making ten movies and then retiring. Let us know below."
