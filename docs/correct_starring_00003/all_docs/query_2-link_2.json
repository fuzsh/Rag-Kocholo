When I saw her name on the credits I thought, \"Elaine from Seinfeld is on this movie?\"\n\nShe plays the character Sophia Fatale who is supposed to be half French/half Japanese and when I saw her, I thought, \"Damn, another half asian/half white hottie!\". But I just read the above article and found out she is all French (even though she speaks Japanese really well).\n\nWell, anyways, I just thought she was really beautiful in the movie -- I really love her face."
