        "text": "When I decided to write this article about KILL BILL, I didn’t realize I had never seen the movies. Watching the first volume through the first time, I was stoked to see that, while there are loads of problematic themes, The Bride herself was a complex and slightly flawed character played flawlessly and with complexity by Uma Thurman that I didn’t mind any outdated sexist tropes that surrounded her or into which she found herself implanted.\n\nFrom the beginning of the movie, The Bride is powerful and defiant. She lays on the floor in a pool of her own blood as man named Bill (an unseen David Carradine) walks up and chats about how he isn’t sadistic and proceeds to shoot her. This view of The Bride is one of the few times we see her as horrified and we soon learn that she was one of many victims of a massacre at her El Paso wedding including her groom, the wedding party, the reverend, the reverend’s wife, and an organ player. The film that unfolds after is an epic revenge story that’s not told in proper sequential order, because “revenge is not a straight line” according to Hattori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba).\n\nThe whiplash of seeing The Bride ruthlessly fighting Vernita across her house to seeing her sensitivity towards this little girl shows us early on the complexity of this character.\n\nWhile we see that our protagonist is determined to kill Vernita for the trespasses against her—we find out that The Bride was pregnant when she was beaten and shot at her wedding—this resurrected revenger does not want to traumatize Nikki and allows Vernita a pause to fight to the death at a later time or date. Unfortunately, Vernita attempts to shoot The Bride who’s forced to kill…which Nikki sees and stands emotionless. The Bride tells her she can come after her for revenge should she wish to in the future, stating that “it was not my intention to do this in front of you. For that, I’m sorry.”\n\nWith all the superhuman feats The Bride completes in this part of her quest, it’s moments like the opening scene showing her vulnerability at her own doomed wedding, her mercy and future promise to Nikki after killing her mother, her memory of the horrors inflicted upon her at the hands of her nurse while she was in a coma, and even the comical spanking she gave a young goon from the Crazy 88 that are the highlights of the movie for me.\n\nFor such a steady character with understandable amounts of vengeful rage, she displays moments of emotion so lightly that you wouldn’t be alone if you wrote them off as exhaustion or happenstance due to situations around her. These flaws make The Bride stronger and without seeing her fair rationality, her mental fortitude, and her ability to engage in lighthearted conversations and seemingly have a good time while sending a warning message of what is to come to Bill, this character’s development would be shallow.\n\nAn article like this can’t do The Bride’s character development justice, but it’s only one part of a two-part film. The next article will see The Bride complete her epic revenge tale while giving us more context to her story, her actual name, and adds more complexity into the character that Vagabond once called “the Most Badass Assassin Ever.”"
