        "text": "The question of a third ‘Kill Bill’ movie has again been raised with Quentin Tarantino - and, while the filmmaker will still not confirm that the film will be made, he will not rule out the possibility.\n\nSpeaking to Variety in promotion of his new release ‘The Hateful Eight,’ the writer-director says, “I’ve been very non-committal about it, and I’m not committing to it, but I wouldn’t be surprised if The Bride made one more appearance before the whole thing is said and done.”\n\nThe question of it all being “said and done” is a pertinent one, as Tarantino has long since declared he intends to retire from filmmaking once he reaches his tenth film - and ‘The Hateful Eight’ is his eighth.\n\nTarantino continues, “I am talking to Uma (Thurman) about it just a little bit. Some of the stuff that I’d written that never made it into the movie that maybe I could use. I’m thinking now, 13 years later, what would be going on with Sofie Fatale (Julie Dreyfus), what would be going on with Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah).”\n\nThese, of course, are among the very few characters who might conceivably return, given the bulk of the cast of ‘Kill Bill’ Vol 1 and 2 - including Bill himself (the late David Carradine) - didn’t make it out alive.\n\nTarantino explains he hadn’t been too interested before in making another ‘Kill Bill’ as “I felt I’d said what I had to say, and I kind of liked the idea of Beatrix Kiddo living out the rest of her life in peace.”\n\nHowever, the filmmaker now feels a return to the colourful universe of Beatrix Kiddo might make a refreshing change:\n\n’Kill Bill,’ Tarantino says, is “a very vision-oriented movie; I created this world that doesn’t exist, where people on planes have holders for their samurai swords!\n\n“Since ‘Kill Bill,’ my work has veered more towards the literary, with much more emphasis on the literary and less on the visual… and so, I think maybe a good helping of viscera would be a nice thing to happen, at least in some point in my future.”\n\nOriginally conceived as a single movie but ultimately released in two volumes in autumn 2003 and spring 2004 (hence it’s counted collectively as his fourth film), ‘Kill Bill’ Vol 1 and 2 earned over $333 million worldwide, and earned Best Actress Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations for Uma Thurman.\n\nIn years gone by Tarantino has said a third film would centre on Nikki, daughter of Vivica Fox’s Vernita Green, as an adult seeking revenge for her mother’s murder.\n\nOnce his ten movies are up, Tarantino says he plans to switch to writing plays and novels.\n\nPicture Credit: Miramax/Disney"
