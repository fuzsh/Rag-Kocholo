        "text": "Quentin Tarantino has the perfect actor in mind to play the Bride’s daughter if Kill Bill: Vol. 3 happens.\n\nDuring his appearance this week on The Joe Rogan Experience, the director discussed a potential sequel to his blockbuster two-part action film.\n\n“I think it’s just revisiting the characters 20 years later,” the Oscar winner said of the hypothetical film. “Just imagining the Bride and her daughter B.B. having 20 years of peace, and then that peace is shattered and then the Bride and B.B. are on the run. The idea of casting Uma [Thurman] and casting her daughter, Maya [Hawke], and the thing would be fucking exciting. I mean, Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) is still out there, Sophie Fatale (Julie Dreyfus) got her arms cut off, she’s still out there. They all got Bill’s money. Gogo (Chiaki Kuriyama) had a twin sister, her twin sister could show up.”\n\nTarantino has worked with Thurman’s real-life daughter Hawke before. The 22-year-old had a role in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood as one of the Manson Family followers.\n\nThe director also confirmed, as he has previously, that Hannah’s character “is still out there.”\n\nIn Tarantino’s original Kill Bill script, Driver was explicitly killed off and the Bride watched her die. But in the film, Driver was left blinded and flailing about in a trailer as the deadly black mamba snake closes in. The scene strongly suggested the character perished and many fans have long assumed she did. But the scene did not explicitly show her death, thus leaving an opening for a sequel.\n\nSpeaking of which, Tarantino has made it clear he’s going to retire after making his 10th film, which is widely assumed to mean he’s going to make just one more. But a potential Kill Bill sequel could provide a loophole, if he should want one, that could give fans two more movies. As he made clear yet again during the Rogan interview, the director counts Kill Bill 1 and 2 as one film. It would then follow that Vol. 3 could also be considered part of that same saga … which means it wouldn’t count as his separate final film.\n\nThat said, Tarantino made it clear he doesn’t have another project coming anytime soon, and his next film would likely be a quieter drama.\n\n“You all know actors, bands, singers, sports dudes that you loved and when they were doing something new, it was exciting and special,” Tarantino said. “And then at a certain point, it’s not exciting or special anymore. It doesn’t mean they’re without worth, but it’s just not the excitement of when blah-blah-blah had a new movie or album coming out. I want to retire before I lose to Leon Spinks and leave you wanting more. I don’t want it to be like, ‘Forget about the shit he’s doing now, back in the day….’” Rogan countered: “But you’re at the top of your game,” to which Tarantino shot back, “That’s the perfect time!” Rogan noted some directors get too complacent, but, “You’re not that guy.” Tarantino: “I don’t think I’m that guy, either. But it’s almost like…you’re not saying this, but way back, back, back behind what you’re saying, [the subtext is], ‘No motherfucker, we [the public get to] reject you. You don’t get to reject us! We’ll tell you when you’re done, you don’t tell us when you’re done!’ I don’t know what the next story is going to be. I imagine it will be more epilogue-y. [Once Upon] was the big one.”\n\nTarantino added that he plans to continue writing for various projects during his retirement. “I hope to do two more books and a play, and then we’ll see what we are. I want to do Hateful Eight onstage and I want to do Reservoir Dogs onstage.… I could see myself writing a novelization of Reservoir Dogs.”"
