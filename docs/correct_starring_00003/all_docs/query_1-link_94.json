She was the first actress to win Emmy Awards for three different series: Seinfeld (1990–98), The New Adventures of Old Christine (2006–10), and Veep (2012–19). For the latter series, she also set a record for most Emmy wins for the same role.\n\nEarly life and SNL\n\nLouis-Dreyfus spent her youth dividing her time between the homes of her parents, who divorced when she was one year of age. Her mother was a tutor and a writer who moved to Washington, D.C., when Julia was eight, and her father was a French-born businessman in New York City. Louis-Dreyfus was educated at a private girls’ school, the Holton-Arms School, in Bethesda, Maryland.\n\nEmmy wins\n\nSeinfeld: 1 (1996)\n\nThe New Adventures of Old Christine: 1 (2006)\n\nVeep: 6 (2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017)\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nCan You Spare A Seinfeld Quiz?\n\nAfter her graduation (1979) from high school, Louis-Dreyfus entered Northwestern University (Evanston, Illinois), where she studied drama and became involved in the Practical Theatre Co., led by actor Brad Hall, whom she married in 1987. In 1982, with help from leaders of the legendary Second City comedy troupe, the Practical Theatre opened a performance space in Chicago where Louis-Dreyfus, Hall, and two others, Gary Kroeger and Paul Barrosse, began performing improvisational comedy. Their first show opened in July 1982 and received rave reviews. They were soon scouted by Dick Ebersol, the producer of NBC’s Saturday Night Live (SNL), and all four cast members were hired. Louis-Dreyfus, at age 21, left Northwestern and moved to New York City.\n\nShe remained a regular SNL cast member until 1985, although she disliked the “dog-eat-dog” atmosphere backstage. After leaving the show, she guest starred on various sitcoms and began a film career in 1986 with small roles in the fantasy-horror film Troll and, more notably, in Woody Allen’s Hannah and Her Sisters.\n\nTV stardom: Seinfeld, The New Adventures of Old Christine, and Veep\n\nIn 1989 a former SNL colleague, Larry David, invited Louis-Dreyfus to audition for a new sitcom that he was developing with comedian Jerry Seinfeld. She won the role of Jerry’s former girlfriend Elaine Benes in Seinfeld (1990–98) and, as part of the classic show, earned a place in TV history. In 1996 she won her first Emmy for outstanding supporting actress in a comedy series for that role. She also made several films during that period, including Jack the Bear (1993) and Deconstructing Harry (1997).\n\nAfter Seinfeld ended, Louis-Dreyfus starred in the short-lived sitcom Watching Ellie (2002–03). Her fortunes rose when she claimed the title role in The New Adventures of Old Christine (2006–10) as a single mother who manages to maintain a friendly relationship with her former husband; she won the 2006 Emmy for outstanding lead actress in a comedy series. In 2010 Louis-Dreyfus earned a star on Hollywood’s Walk of Fame. In 2012 she began a successful run as U.S. Vice President (later President) Selina Meyer on the comedy series Veep. Her work on that show cemented her status as one of the leading comic actors in the United States and won her six consecutive Emmy Awards for outstanding lead actress in a comedy series. In 2017 she tied a record for most Emmy wins (eight) by a performer. Louis-Dreyfus also won several Emmy Awards for producing Veep. Later in 2017 she announced that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer, and the show went on hiatus. It returned two years later for its seventh and final season.\n\nFilms: Enough Said and You Hurt My Feelings\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nDuring this time Louis-Dreyfus starred in Nicole Holofcener’s Enough Said (2013), portraying a divorced woman who begins dating her friend’s ex-husband (played by James Gandolfini). She later appeared with Will Ferrell in Downhill (2020), a dramedy about a struggling couple on a family vacation. In 2021 Louis-Dreyfus joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe, playing Valentina Allegra de Fontaine in the TV miniseries The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. She also appeared as the character in several films, including Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022).\n\nIn 2023 Louis-Dreyfus reunited with Holofcener on You Hurt My Feelings. The film centers on a novelist who rethinks her marriage after overhearing her husband talking negatively about her upcoming book. That year she also starred in Tuesday, playing the mother of a terminally ill teenager.\n\nIn 2014 Louis-Dreyfus was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame. Four years later she received the Kennedy Center’s Mark Twain Prize for American Humor.\n\nLorraine Murray The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica"
