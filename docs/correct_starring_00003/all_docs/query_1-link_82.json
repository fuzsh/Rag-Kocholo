        "text": "“The Bride” was the deadliest assassin of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, until the day she decided to leave the business, assume a new identity, and get married. But it was on the day of her marriage that her old “friends”, not to mention her boss, Bill, find her and assassinate the entire ceremony while Bill shoots her in the head. Well, Bill and his people should have tried harder because, after four years, the Bride has awakened from her coma. And Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.\n\n“How much you like KILL BILL, a two-part revenge epic, will probably depend on how much of a taste you have for the synthetic fusion cuisine that the director has cooked up. But old movies are not the sole focus of Tarantino’s obsession. The most vivid emotional connection in KILL BILL does not take place between any of the characters, but between the director and his star, Uma Thurman. Much of the perverse energy of KILL BILL arises from his near-maniacal fascination with her. She is at once his idol, his alter-ego, his dream lover and his muse.” (A.O. Scott)"
