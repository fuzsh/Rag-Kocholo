        "text": "KILL BILL: Quentin Tarantino prefers a sloooow death for Bill\n\nFebruary 2003\n\nIf you had $39 million, do you think you could complete a movie on schedule and under-budget? And if you didnÂ’t, would you be worried? Not so, if you're Quentin Tarantino, the man who has brought us cult classics like Reservoir Dogs (1992) and Pulp Fiction (winner of the top prize at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival).\n\nAccording to \"Entertainment Weekly,\" the QT homage flick to the martial arts films of yore, Kill Bill, is slightly behind schedule and \"ever-so\" slightly over budget.\n\nWith a targeted wrap scheduled for October 2002, principal photography halted on Christmas Day after Miramax gave the director a drop-dead completion date. And while shooting costs are not necessarily written in stone until the dust settles, the film's budget appears to have ballooned to the $50 million level. That doesn't seem to have bothered QT though who states, \"...budget overruns are just bureaucratic curlicue.\"\n\nWhat's unique about this film is the way QT is going about it. In today's cinema, we have been inundated by CG special effects and the \"wire-fu\" techniques many have become aware of due to films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Instead, QT has made it clear that Kill Bill was to be made... \"the Chinese Way.\"\n\nHe comments, \"...Chinese way of doing action is there's not really a schedule ... no shot list. I have certain shots in my mind that I know I want to do but now, me and the master (Yuen), come up with new things as we're doing it.\"\n\nShooting almost exclusively in China, QT has immersed cast and crew into making this film evoke the style of the old school Asian \"chop-socky\" films; even replicating the comical violence such films were [in]famous for. While new technology offers many advantages to today's filmmaker, QT has opted for the same low-budget effects his idols (such as legendary Shaw director Chang Cheh) used when making their films three decades ago.\n\nIn order to capture the style of these now cult classics, QT had his Academy Award winning cinematographer (Bob Richardson) watch such Shaw Bros. staples like Five Fingers of Death and One Armed Swordsman, prior to the production, to fully grasp the look he's envisioned.\n\nQT has also enlisted two of Asia's most talented. Yuen Wo-ping (known best to western audiences for his work on Crouching Tiger and The Matrix) was hired as fight choreographer while Japanese screen idol Sonny Chiba is on board as combat coach (and cast member as well)."
