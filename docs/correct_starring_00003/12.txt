Personal Quotes

(on filming Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003) "I mean, on that last day, you would get to your spot, you'd get a break and go to the bathroom or whatever, and then you'd have to just pick your way through the bodies and not slip in the blood. I mean, it was exactly like that. It was very surreal. It was bizarre."
