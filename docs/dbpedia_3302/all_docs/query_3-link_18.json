        "text": "Advertisements\n\nNo one *really, but the town I was originally from is now part of the Fort Smith metropolitan area. So...\n\nRudy Ray Moore who played Dolemite.\n\nLaurence Luckinbill who played Spock's half-brother in the dreadful Star Trek V.\n\nAnd some politicians or football players. Hm kind of disappointing.\n\nOther people from or based in Crawford County, Arkansas include actor Bob Burns and Anti-Catholic cult-leader/sex-offender Tony Alamo. Good times.\n\n*On looking it up I've discovered a Depression-era bank robber is from my hometown.\n\n\"The Misfits\" (the punk band) is the only \"well known\" famous people from Lodi, NJ unfortunately (my hometown)\n\nCan't expect much from a suburb.\n\nSome famous people who came from around the area would be James Gandolfini of Westwood (the main guy on The Sopranos), Most of the \"Sugar Hill Gang\" of Englewood, The Jonas Brothers of Wycoff, Debby Boone of Hackensack...\n\nThere's a few from Newark as well such as Queen Latifah, Joe Pesci, Whitney Houston, Redman, Jason Alexander, Ice T, Kat Deluna, Gloria Gaynor, Faith Evans...\n\nThere's many others, but I don't want to go too far out of my own area.\n\nThought I would add to this list for the Santa Rosa, CA area:\n\nRobert Ripley (of Ripley's Believe it or Not) born and raised here.\n\nCharles Schuls (of Peanuts fame) ok not born here but spent the last 40 years of his life here and called it home.\n\nMark Felt (aka Deep Throat) ok, ok, so not born here he lived here when he died and people found out who he was.\n\nNatalie Wood (ok, only moved here when she was about 2 years old before her acting debut at 4)\n\nJulie London (married to Jack Webb and later to Bobby Troup - known as a pin up girl)\n\nClose by in San Francisco:\n\nAnsel Adams\n\nBill Bixby\n\nMel Blanc\n\nClint Eastwood\n\nJerry Garcia\n\nPatty Hearst\n\nSteve Jobs\n\nJack LaLane\n\nJack London\n\nThere's more but I'll let someone else fill in the blanks...\n\nThe list is too long, so I'll just post about some people who we personally know or went to school with. Jai Rodriguez from ***** eye for the straight guy went to HS with my sister, and an American Idol finalist from like 4 years ago who came in 5th place is friends with my sister (from our town too). Joe something, forgot his name. Murena I think, something like that.\n\nMy sister's landlord was the drummer in the band Alice Cooper. He owns a super huge mansion with an ocean view on Long island. He invited her and her roommates over for the 4th of July. They got to party with the rock stars, pretty cool. Lots of famous people where we are.\n\nLast edited by Rachael84; 02-01-2010 at 08:57 PM.."
