Sometime in his late teens he entered the hardware business with his father.\n\nMore\n\nAyers, William N.\n\nAlthough we generally think of 19th century Americans as generally being a more settled people, many individuals from that time were just as peripatetic as anyone in the 21st century. Ayers is an excellent example of this wanderlust. Born in 1825 and settled for the first 20 years of his life in the village of Bristol near his birthplace, Warren, Ohio, his schooling was scant but he was an eager autodidact.\n\nMore\n\nBaer, Bernard\n\nA German Jew who was born in Baden, Germany on April 12, 1837, Baer immigrated to this country and settled in Fort Smith in June 1867.

At the time of Charles Jr.'s birth, they were en route to Fort Smith from Pittsburg, Penn.\n\nMore\n\nBlair, William\n\nAlthough not a native of Fort Smith and a resident for not more than 16 years, William Blair was so well-respected and loved that the mayor of Fort Smith at the time of his death in 1903 asked that all businesses shut during the hour of his funeral.

Darby and is available at numerous Web sites, but omitting him for that reason from Fort Smith's Who Who would be negligent. Some basic facts: Bill Darby was born in Fort Smith in February 1911 to Percy and Nellie Darby.\n\nMore\n\nDean, Bertha\n\nBorn in Kansas in 1882, Bertha Lanthrop began her career as a prostitute around 1900 when she was in her late teens or early twenties. For Bertha, unlike Laura Zeigler (Miss Laura, the first madam at 123 Firs Street), the business of commercial sex was less of a career and more of a way of life.\n\nMore\n\nDell, Valentine\n\nBorn in Baden, Germany, and educated at Mannheim College in that same country, Dell emigrated to the United States in 1846.
