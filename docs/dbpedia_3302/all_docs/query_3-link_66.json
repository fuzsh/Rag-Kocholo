        "text": "As a very small country that relatively few have heard of, the Turks and Caicos has seen quite an impressive number of famous visitors, from both present and past eras.\n\nToday, the unparalleled beaches in the Turks and Caicos Islands attract people from across the globe, and there’s a wide range of luxury accommodation choices to stay at.\n\nThe exclusive all-inclusive resorts on Providenciales, Parrot Cay, and Pine Cay are favorites with the rich and famous, yet the expansive private rental mansions have also become popular as well.\n\nAs every beach in the Turks and Caicos is public and free-to-access up to the high tide point, regardless of whether the coast is on a private island or not, it’s possible to visit almost any location mentioned on this page.\n\nHistoric Arrivals\n\nAlong with being a possible site of Christopher Columbus’s first point of landfall in the Americas and New World, quite a few other interesting (albeit perhaps not globally significant!) historical events involving important people took place in and around the Turks and Caicos Islands.\n\nChristopher Columbus\n\nDate: 1492\n\nGrand Turk is one of the three likely possible points of first landfall of Christopher Columbus’s historic voyage to the New World.\n\nPonce De Leon\n\nDate: 1512\n\nSpanish conquistador Ponce De Leon, then governor of Puerto Rico, received a royal charter from the Spanish Court which encouraged him to search for Bimini and the Fountain of Youth. Presumably on his way to discover what eventually became Florida, he anchored at an unknown location in our archipelago.\n\nCaptain John White\n\nDate: 1587\n\nEnglish artist and explorer Captain John White stopped on West Caicos during the journey to Roanoke Island in Virginia. According to his accounts, he was expecting to gather the salt that would naturally occur in the shallow ponds, yet did not. Instead, his crew hunted “swanees” (probably flamingos!)\n\nFrançois l'Olonnais\n\nDate: Later 1600s\n\nFrench pirate François l'Olonnais was known to have operated off of French Cay and West Caicos. The origins of the Turks and Caicos name is derived from the islands being a pirate base.\n\nAnne Bonney and Mary Reed\n\nDate: Early 1700s\n\nDuring a wilder time of Turks and Caicos history, the islands between Providenciales and North Caicos supported pirate bases due to their freshwater sources. In fact, what is now Parrot Cay used to be known as Pirate Cay because of the buccaneers. Famous female pirates Anne Bonney and Mary Reed were known to have operated from the island.\n\nHoratio Nelson\n\nDate: 1783\n\nHoratio Nelson, the famed British naval commander, suffered one of his few defeats when he attempted to retake Fire Hill (near the current cruise center) from the French during the Battle of Grand Turk.\n\nTheodoor Hendrik Nikolaas de Booy\n\nDate: 1911\n\nDutch-American anthropologist and noted authority on the Caribbean peoples Theodoor de Booy spent a bit of time in the Caicos Islands searching the land and caves for evidence and artifacts from the Taino people. The result from these efforts was a book: Lucayan Remains on the Caicos Islands, possibly the first published book centered on the country.\n\nPrince George\n\nDate: 1928\n\nPrince George, Duke of Kent, visited Grand Turk aboard the Royal Navy D-Class Light Cruiser HMS Durban during a relief mission after the major 1928 Hurricane (referred to as the Hurricane of the Century). He went ashore incognito.\n\nPrincess Margaret\n\nDate: 1960\n\nPrincess Margaret Rose of the United Kingdom, Countess of Snowdon, paid an official visit to Grand Turk on the HMS Britannia. On the visit, she stopped at the two U.S. bases on the island: NAVFAC and South Base.\n\n© NASA\n\nJohn Glenn\n\nDate: 1962\n\nThe first landfall of American astronaut John Glenn after the historic Mercury space mission was the island of Grand Turk. Today, a monument commemorating the incredible event can be seen at the Grand Turk Cruise Center.\n\nLyndon B Johnson\n\nDate: 1962\n\nIn 1962, then U.S. vice president Lyndon B Johnson greeted John Glenn on Grand Turk after the astronaut’s historic mission.\n\n© Joel Rouse / Ministry of Defense\n\nH.M. Queen Elizabeth II\n\nDate: 1966\n\nQueen Elizabeth II visited South Caicos in 1966 aboard the HMS Royal Britannia. To commemorate the visit, the South Caicos Regatta has been held ever since.\n\n© Allan Warren / CC BY-SA 3.0\n\nDuke of Edinburgh\n\nDate: 1966\n\nPrince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, accompanied Queen Elizabeth II on her visit to South Caicos.\n\n© Arnaud Bouissou\n\nKing Charles III\n\nDate: 1973\n\nKing Charles III (then Prince Charles) of the United Kingdom stopped over at Grand Turk on the HMS Minerva. During his stay, he took part in local cricket matches as a member of the ship’s team. The ship’s crew also conducted community service and took the island’s Series Land Rover ambulance to the local hospital to repair and paint!\n\n© Northern Ireland Office / CC BY 2.0\n\nPrince Andrew\n\nDate: 2000\n\nPrince Andrew, Duke of York, made an official visit to the Turks and Caicos and stopped on both Grand Turk and Providenciales.\n\nGrace Bay and Providenciales\n\nGrace Bay Beach, the hallmark of the Turks and Caicos, is world renowned for its pristine sand and turquoise water.
