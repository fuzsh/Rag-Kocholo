        "text": "Attorney General Griffin praises Arkansas Supreme Court's rejection of motion brought by convicted felon of Little Rock\n\nGriffin offered the following statement:\n\n“Convicted felon Oscar Stilley’s emergency motion sought to resurrect the abortion amendment ballot petition by compelling the Secretary of State to provisionally certify it for the November general election. I applaud the Arkansas Supreme Court’s decision to deny Stilley’s motion as moot after the court had correctly denied the attempt by the sponsor of the abortion amendment to get on the ballot.\n\n“Stilley has no legal standing to bring this lawsuit in the first place. In fact, his filings have made it clear that he cares more about re-litigating his federal felony conviction. This attempt to retry his conviction has done nothing but waste the court’s time and taxpayers’ money.”\n\nTo read a copy of the court’s rejection of the motion, click here.\n\nTo download a PDF version of this release, click here.\n\nSanders, DHS Announce $15 Million to Support Arkansans with Substance Use Disorder, Mental Illness, and Intellectual Disabilities\n\nLITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Today, Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders and the Arkansas Department of Human Services (DHS) announced $15 million in grants to fund infrastructure improvements that support individuals with substance use disorders, mental illnesses, or intellectual disabilities. Recipient organizations offer Medicaid treatment in community-based settings for specialty populations around the state.\n\n“Vulnerable Arkansans need help – and they deserve to receive that help in modern, well-functioning facilities,” said Governor Sanders.“As my administration supports our most at-risk citizens, these grants will build a continuity of care that helps Arkansans through every step of their lives.”\n\n“The funding awards announced today will create an array of additional services that support an improved continuum of care for both young people and adults who are struggling with substance use disorders, mental illness, or intellectual disabilities,” said DHS Secretary Kristi Putnam. “We are excited to see these investments turn into services that fill gaps in coverage and ultimately make a positive difference in the lives of Arkansans who need this support.”\n\nThis program will award grants to support Youth Substance Abuse Residential Treatment and Supported Housing Units for Young Adults later this summer.\n\nThe different grant types and recipient groups are below:\n\nThe Community Reintegration for Children grant funds new buildings that will function as family home environments for children to provide step-down support from high-cost, restrictive settings. Recipients are:\n\nWestern Arkansas Counseling and Guidance Center, Fort Smith – $4 million\n\nUnited Methodist Children’s Home, Little Rock – $1 million\n\nThe Adult Substance Abuse Residential Treatment Facilities grant funds improvements to existing facilities that offer 30- to 60-day treatment programs for adults struggling with substance abuse disorders. Recipients are:\n\nHarbor House, Fort Smith – $1,842,004\n\nARVAC Lake Point Recovery and Wellness, Russellville – $2,157,996\n\nThe Supported Housing Units for Young Adults grant funds the construction of an apartment complex that will house youth struggling with behavioral health who have aged out of group homes or other services provided by the Division of Children and Family Services or the Division of Youth Services. The recipient is:\n\nRainbow of Challenges, Inc., Hope – $3 million\n\nThe Therapeutic Communities for Adults with IDD grant funds the creation of a 16-bed therapeutic community that will provide step-down support from high-cost, in-patient psychiatric care for adults with intellectual or developmental disabilities and a co-occurring behavioral health diagnosis. The recipient is:\n\nARISA Health, Jonesboro – $3 million\n\nNew UA philanthropic giving was $92.3 million in recent fiscal year\n\nby Talk Business & Politics staff (staff2@talkbusiness.net)\n\nThe University of Arkansas said Friday (Aug. 23) that philanthropic giving in the fiscal year ended June 30 totaled $211.1 million. Of that, $92.3 million was from new giving and $118.8 million was payments on previous commitments.\n\nThe $92.3 million includes cash, in-kind giving, planned gifts and new pledges. According to the UA, the giving will support scholarships for students, campus and study-abroad programs, faculty and staff, research and economic development, entrepreneurship and capital projects. Of the giving, $14.8 million was directed to the university’s endowment.\n\n“The university is fortunate to have the commitment of alumni and friends who understand how their gifts directly impact the student experience through scholarships and quality teaching, research and service,” said Sandy Edwards, senior advisor for advancement. “We are building on this commitment as we launch into an even more robust new school year.”\n\nNew UA philanthropic giving was $92.3 million in recent fiscal year\n\nState of the State Mid-Year 2024: Arkansas tourism continues to be a strong industry\n\nby Tina Alvey Dale (tdale@talkbusiness.net)\n\nArkansas Tourism Director Dalaney Thomas said the state’s 2% tourism tax collections continue to rise with fiscal year 2024 (June 2023-July 2024) closing out at a record $26.363 million, up 5.13% compared with the recent fiscal year.\n\n“Arkansas’ travel industry continues to see growth in large part thanks to the expansion of the state’s marketing footprint and the return of strong business and corporate travel,” Thomas said.\n\nThe tax collections are directly allocated toward promotion of the state, and Thomas said those efforts are working.\n\nState of the State Mid-Year 2024: Arkansas tourism continues to be a strong industry\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson attends DNC\n\nKUAR | By Ronak Patel\n\nDuring the Democratic National Convention (DNC) last week, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, was one of the handful of Republicans, at the event.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News, Hutchinson said he was not at the event to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris. However, he said he still believes Donald Trump should not be the next president and the Republicans need to move on from the former president.\n\n“We need to define it [the Republican Party] differently than Donald Trump and the rule of law is important to me. I said on the debate stage I’m not going to vote for a convicted felon. That still holds true,” Hutchinson said.\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson attends DNC\n\nArkansas medical marijuana sales down almost 4% through July\n\nby Talk Business & Politics staff (staff2@talkbusiness.net)\n\nMedical marijuana sales in Arkansas between January and July total $158.5 million, down 3.7% compared with the $164.6 million in the same period of 2023. Sales since medical marijuana was legalized in 2019 total more than $1 billion.\n\nThe Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration reported $22.956 million in July sales, with 6,467 pounds sold. There are 37 dispensaries in Arkansas. The voter-approved amendment allowing medical marijuana sales provides for up to 40 dispensaries.\n\nFollowing are the top five dispensaries for pounds sold in July.\n\nSuite 443 (Hot Springs): 731.95 pounds\n\nNatural Relief Dispensary (Sherwood): 540.18 pounds\n\nCROP (Jonesboro): 366.7 pounds\n\nHarvest (Conway): 323.47 pounds\n\nHigh Bank (Pine Bluff): 315.47 pounds\n\nArkansas medical marijuana sales down almost 4% through July\n\nLegislative committee approves rules on electronic signatures, gender-neutral IDs\n\nKUAR | By Josie Lenora\n\nMembers of the Arkansas Legislative Council approved two controversial rule changes in a meeting Friday: the first had to do with elections, while the second had to do with gender-neutral driver's licenses.\n\nDriver's licenses\n\nThe Department of Finance and Administration recently implemented a rule requiring the letter “M” or “F” to be listed under “sex” on all driver’s licenses or state-issued IDs. Right now, a few hundred Arkansans have “X” listed instead of \"M\" or \"F\".\n\nDemocratic lawmakers protested the rule change, saying it was harmful to transgender and nonbinary Arkansans. Rep. Andrew Collins, D- Little Rock, said the rule change goes beyond the purview of what the Department of Finance and Administration is allowed to do.\n\nLegislative committee approves rules on electronic signatures, gender-neutral IDs\n\nDove delay preserves full weekend of fun\n\nBY Randy Zellers\n\nLITTLE ROCK — Arkansans gearing up for the state’s kickoff to hunting seasons might have noticed that the Sept. 7 opening day doesn’t fall on Labor Day Weekend, which is typically associated with the event. The break from the federal holiday is a matter of unfortunate timing, so to speak.\n\nEach year, federal migratory bird frameworks dictate that dove seasons in the Central Management Unit (migration corridors similar to flyways) may not begin before Sept. 1 and must conclude by Jan. 15. Labor Day, which began in 1882 and became a federal holiday in 1894 is annually scheduled for the first Monday in September, regardless of the calendar date.\n\nHere’s where the phenomenon known as “calendar creep” comes into effect. This year (and next year), Labor Day Weekend will actually begin at the end of August, preceding the first available date for dove season.\n\nDuring these years the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission has to decide whether to open the season on Sunday, cutting the weekend short, or to postpone the opening day to the following weekend.\n\nIn 2019, the AGFC was faced with this decision and decided on the Sunday opening day. Staff and commissioners fielded many calls from the public that many people were not able to take advantage of the Labor Day holiday from work, which resulted in their traditional opening weekend of dove season becoming a single-day hunt.\n\nWith this in mind, Commissioners and staff agreed that postponing the season until Sept. 7 allowed more opportunities for all Arkansans to enjoy a full weekend of dove hunting unpressured birds during the season opener.\n\nLuckily this issue only presents itself two out of every seven years, notwithstanding shifts caused by leap year. Unfortunately, next year will see the same delay because Sept. 1 falls on Labor Day itself, leaving no room for a full weekend of fast flights and delicious doves.\n\nKamala Harris tells Democrats: ‘I see a nation that is ready to move forward’\n\nby Roby Brock (roby@talkbusiness.net)\n\nVice President Kamala Harris accepted her party’s nomination for President Thursday night (Aug. 22), while laying out a stark contrast between herself and her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump.\n\nIn accepting the nomination at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Harris made history as the first woman of color to lead her party for President.\n\n“On behalf of everyone whose story could only be written in the greatest nation on Earth, I accept your nomination to be the President of the United States of America,” Harris said.\n\nKamala Harris tells Democrats: ‘I see a nation that is ready to move forward’\n\nCollege of Pharmacy Recognized by AACP with Designation, Individual Awards\n\nBy Benjamin Waldrum\n\nThe American Association of College of Pharmacy (AACP) recently recognized the UAMS College of Pharmacy with a prestigious designation and handed out national awards to two faculty members, one preceptor and a student.\n\nThe College of Pharmacy was one of only 17 schools of pharmacy nationwide selected as an inaugural Academia-Community Transformation (ACT) Community Pharmacy Center of Excellence.

The program aims to facilitate a deeper understanding of career paths in academic pharmacy.\n\nCollege of Pharmacy Recognized by AACP with Designation, Individual Awards\n\nWalmart sells $3.7 billion stake in JD.com\n\nby Kim Souza (ksouza@talkbusiness.net)\n\nWalmart sent a signal that it’s reducing investments in China by selling 144.5 million shares of JD.com, which totaled about $3.7 billion. The trade happened Wednesday, ending the retail giant’s eight-year partnership.\n\nThe world has changed since Walmart first took a stake in China’s e-commerce platform JD.com in 2016. Walmart ramped up its ownership to 10% as it sought to grow its retail business inside China. Since that time, China has experienced a volatile economy, slower consumption patterns, and a prolonged shutdown from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWalmart said divesting the JD shares indicates the company plans to focus on Walmart China, Sam’s Club, and allocate funds to other priorities. Walmart execs have said the Sam’s Club format is performing well in China for online and physical sales. Market analysts estimate Sam’s Club achieved a compounded annual growth rate of around 30% in the past three years. Sam’s Club China posted annual sales of $11.1 billion (US) in 2023. More than 50% of Sam’s Club orders in China came from online.\n\nWalmart sells $3.7 billion stake in JD.com\n\nCotton Reiterates the Demand for Answers Regarding Harris’ National Security Advisor’s Communications with Iranian Influence Operation\n\nWashington, D.C. — Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) today sent a second letter to Vice President Kamala Harris to express his concern about her National Security Advisor, Philip Gordon, and his connections to senior Department of Defense official Ariane Tabatabai. Ms. Tabatabai was reportedly involved in an Iranian government operation to expand Iran’s influence in the United States.\n\nIn part, Senator Cotton wrote:\n\n“In social media posts since my last letter, Mr. Gordon continues to demonstrate a pattern of anti-Israel bias, which furthers Iranian interests. If he’s willing to ridicule Israel so unfairly in public, I can only imagine what he is telling you in private. I understand that it may be difficult to discern Iranian agents from the left-wing ideologies on your staff. But you have the responsibility to make these difficult distinctions and appropriately vet the people you elevate to positions of distinction and trust.”\n\nFull text of the letter may be found here and below.\n\nAugust 15, 2024\n\nVice President Kamala D. Harris\n\nThe White House\n\n1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW\n\nWashington, DC 20500\n\nDear Vice President Harris,\n\nOn July 31, I sent you a letter regarding your National Security Advisor Philip Gordon’s connections to alleged Iranian spy, Ariane Tabatabai. Yet, you failed to respond by my deadline or to appropriately address this threat to national security emanating from your staff.\n\nThe presence of such an obvious security risk in your inner circle should have elicited your utmost attention. It raises the question of whether you’ve been aware of Mr. Gordon’s possible links to the Iranian regime and simply find your policies aligned enough with Tehran’s interests that ties to that regime don’t concern you.\n\nIn social media posts since our last letter, Mr. Gordon continues to demonstrate a pattern of anti- Israel bias, which furthers Iranian interests. If he’s willing to ridicule Israel so unfairly in public, we can only imagine what he is telling you in private.\n\nI understand that it may be difficult to discern Iranian agents from the left-wing ideologues on your staff. But you have the responsibility to make these difficult distinctions and appropriately vet the people you elevate to positions of distinction and trust.\n\nI expect you to immediately investigate Mr. Gordon’s ties to the Iranian regime and provide responses to my initial July 31 letter.\n\nThank you for your belated attention to this important matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\nTom Cotton\n\nUnited States Senator\n\nArkansas initiative advances organic farming, diversity\n\nBy Jenifer Fouch\n\nUniversity of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture\n\nArkansas Agricultural Experiment Station\n\nFAYETTEVILLE, Ark. — With U.S. organic food sales topping $63 billion last year, the Center for Arkansas Farms and Food wants to help Arkansas farmers grab a larger share of that market.\n\nArkansas has 107 certified organic farms, most of which are poultry or egg operations, with 19 fruit or vegetable farms, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That’s an increase from 82 organic farms in 2021, as reported in the latest USDA Certified Organic Survey. However, Luke Freeman, program associate for CAFF, says there’s still room for growth to meet consumer demand, especially in specialty crops.\n\nCAFF is leading the Arkansas Organic Agriculture Project, a statewide effort to help producers transition to organic production and promote diversity within the agricultural industry.\n\n“We’re importing a significant amount of organic products that Americans consume, whereas we could be producing those products right here in the U.S. and Arkansas especially,” Freeman said.\n\nAccording to the Organic Trade Association, U.S. organic food sales have grown yearly since 2013, reaching $63.8 billion in 2023.\n\nSince the Arkansas Organic Agriculture Project started in 2022, CAFF surveyed farmers in Arkansas about barriers to pursuing organic certification. They learned that weed and insect control was a key issue, as was the need to seek out-of-state organic certifiers since Arkansas doesn’t have an in-state option. CAFF is working on addressing these issues with the new project and helping farmers connect with certifiers.\n\nThe Arkansas Organic Agriculture Project is part of the Transition to Organic Partnership Program, also known as TOPP, a nationwide effort funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. TOPP’s primary goals are to increase certified organic acreage to meet growing consumer demand and to expand the participation of people from various racial, ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds in organic farming.\n\nDiverse partners\n\nThe University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff plays a key role in this initiative, focusing on engaging these underserved producers.\n\n“UAPB’s long-standing commitment and successful track record in serving small-scale and limited-resource clientele makes the institution uniquely positioned to engage these groups in the area of organic production practices,” said Shaun Francis, extension horticulture specialist at the School of Agriculture, Fisheries and Human Sciences at UAPB. “This type of initiative is very timely as it provides producers another avenue to remain competitive in the agriculture industry.”\n\nAnother partner in the project is Black Women in Agriculture, an advocacy group dedicated to increasing the representation of Black women in the industry. Founder and director Kesha Cobb says these efforts are essential because organic growth is a part of the foundation of conservation.\n\n“We want to usher in a better, more sustainable way of crop production for socially disadvantaged growers and make it plain and attainable so that we can look forward to a new day in agricultural production,” she said.\n\nThe Arkansas Organic Agriculture Project offers resources, events, and opportunities in four key priority areas: organic farmer mentorship, technical assistance, community building, and workforce development.\n\nThrough mentorship, farmers transitioning to organic practices are paired with experienced organic producers who provide one-on-one guidance on production methods, marketing strategies and the certification process. Experienced organic farmers who sign up to be mentors can receive a stipend.\n\nThe project offers technical support through resources such as the Beginning Farmer classes, an online video library at CAFF, and the Arkansas Organic Network, a platform for farmers, agricultural support organizations, advisors, suppliers, and buyers to share resources and collaborate on solutions to common challenges. It includes a discussion board called the AR Farmer Exchange, where members can find work opportunities, buy and sell farm equipment and livestock, and coordinate bulk purchasing.\n\nThe workforce development component of the project includes training organic inspectors, developing practices among agriculture advisors, and providing additional training to increase the knowledge and resources available to current Arkansas organic farmers.\n\n“Technical assistance and training in the area of organic production offers smaller producers the opportunity to utilize their existing small acreage and receive a premium price for their organic produce,” said Francis. “This initiative complements other diversification efforts such as high tunnel production, micro irrigation, and use of cover crops.”\n\nUpcoming Event: Organic Farm Tour at PrairieWoods Farm\n\nThe Arkansas Organic Agriculture Project is holding an organic farm tour at PrairieWoods Farms on Aug. 25 in Sulphur Springs, Arkansas.\n\nThis free event will offer participants a firsthand look at practices and techniques used on a certified organic farm with a guided tour and discussions on managing mixed vegetables, using high tunnels and the organic certification process.\n\n“The event provides an excellent opportunity for both current and aspiring organic farmers to learn more about organic farming practices and network with others in the field,” said Freeman.\n\nA training workshop for agriculture professionals and extension agents will also be held on Oct. 2, focusing on techniques and practices for organic weed management in specialty crops.\n\nCAFF director Heather Friedrich leads the Arkansas Organic Agriculture project. Other key leaders in the initiative include TOPP program manager Luke Freeman and CAFF instructor Joe Hannan. Other partners include Winrock International, the Arkansas Natural Soybean and Grain Alliance and the National Center for Appropriate Technology Southeast Office.\n\nStay up-to-date on the Arkansas Organic Agriculture Project by signing up for the newsletter and checking out the podcast Arkansas Organic Chronicles and other resources.\n\nAbout the Center for Arkansas Farms and Food\n\nThe Center for Arkansas Farms and Food trains farmers and food entrepreneurs with production, business skills and resources to help them develop businesses that sustain ecosystems, land and communities.

One area of focus has been teacher recruitment and retention—an essential component in providing a stable and effective learning environment for our students.\n\nHistorically, Arkansas has taken significant steps in educational funding following landmark legal cases such as the 2002 Lake View case. At the heart of our funding strategy is the foundation funding model established in 2003, which outlines the essential resources needed for an adequate education. This funding matrix, while largely unchanged in its composition, has seen adjustments in funding amounts over the years. For 2023, the per-pupil foundation funding stood at $7,413, reflecting our ongoing commitment to supporting our schools.\n\nIn recent years, we have seen positive trends in teacher qualifications and experience. The percentage of teachers holding bachelor's, master's, and advanced degrees has risen, along with an increase in fully certified teachers. From 2021 to 2023, the average years of teacher experience grew from 10.5 to 11.8 years, showcasing a more experienced workforce in our classrooms. Currently, 92% of teachers have at least one year of experience, and 3% are nationally board-certified, indicating a dedicated and skilled teaching staff.\n\nWhile our average teacher retention rate stands at 74%, we will always strive for improvement.\n\nUnder the LEARNS Act, we raised starting teacher salaries to $50,000/year. It is clear that investing in our teachers is paramount. We must continue to explore ways to ensure they feel valued and supported in their vital roles.\n\nThe final Educational Adequacy Report must be completed by November 1.

It topped the previous record of minus 10.81 feet set in 2022. Despite consistent rain throughout much of the region, the river is projected to be at minus 3.2 feet by Aug. 27, according to NOAA’s National Water Prediction Service.\n\nThe mid-south hasn’t had drought-like conditions, but a lack of snow last winter in the upper Midwest and lower rain levels throughout the spring and summer have led to lower water levels with many tributaries in the river’s upper system.\n\nMississippi River projected to be at minus levels during harvest for third straight year\n\nMulti-million dollar jail death settlement may be heard by Sebastian County Quorum Court\n\nby Michael Tilley (mtilley@talkbusiness.net)\n\nSebastian County Quorum Court members are expected on Tuesday (Aug. 20) to hear about a proposed settlement in the August 2021 death of Larry Price Jr. resulting from “cruel and inhumane” treatment while an inmate in the Sebastian County Detention Center.\n\nA lawsuit was filed Jan. 13, 2023, in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas seeking a jury trial.

They deserve the opportunity to shine on a level playing field. Biological males should not be robbing females of their opportunity to compete for athletic accolades or scholarships, nor should they be threatening the safety of women in competition. I will continue fighting to protect girls’ sports teams and the opportunities of female athletes.”\n\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit blocked West Virginia’s “Save Women’s Sports Act,” which bans male athletes from playing on girls’ sports teams, saying the law violated Title IX. West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey filed a petition with the United States Supreme Court to hear his appeal.\n\nGriffin is leading the amicus brief with Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall supporting the West Virginia appeal. They are joined by the state attorneys general of Alaska, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Wyoming.\n\nTo read the brief, click here.\n\nFor a printer-friendly version of this release, click here."
