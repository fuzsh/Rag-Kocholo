        "text": "Fire Destroys Historic Home\n\nFort Smith lost another of its jewels in the early morning of July 7, 2010, when the historic Angus McLeod home was destroyed by fire. Early in the 20th century, Angus McLeod, owner of the Fort Smith Contracting Company, supplied railroad ties for the Fort Smith and Western Railroad and the Midland Valley Company. He and his wife, Elizabeth McLeod, purchased lots for construction of their new home in 1904. McCloud used many imported materials in the construction of the Neo-Classical dwelling, which was completed in 1905 and was featured in the 1982 movie \"The Blue and the Gray,\"\n\nThe cost of the homes construction and imported materials is thought to have exceeded the 1914 sale price of $102,500. Shortly after completion the home was sold to Ben Wolf, and the Wolf-Pollack family owned the home until 1958, when it was sold to Mrs. Virginia Rush. It has since had several more owners, with the last being Mr. and Mrs. Daniel Hearne. The Angus McLeod house was listed on the Register of Historic Places in 1978.\n\nGirls, Inc. Wins First Bloom Youth Garden Design Contest\n\nLocal Group Wins National Recognition and Trip to Washington, D.C.\n\nIn June, 2010,a garden created and maintained by members of Girls, Inc., was named a national winner in the 2010 First Bloom Youth Garden Design Contest. Located near the old commissary building at the Fort Smith National Historic Site, the period garden was the only entry from Arkansas and was one of twenty-six semifinalists. The top prize was an all-expense-paid trip to Washington, D.C. in July for six of the girls and the First Bloom coordinator, Park Ranger Keri Powers.\n\nAbove: (L) Alice Schwin, and (R) Park Ranger Keri Powers at work. Above: Girls, Inc., girls in Heritage Garden at Fort Smith National Historic Site\n\nIn 2009, the Fort Smith National Historic Site received a National Park Foundation grant of $13,000, which provided funding for the establishment of the Officers Wifes Garden or the Officers Family Garden. The Fort Smith Historic Sites Heritage Garden was one of twenty-six National Park gardens to receive the grant the first year it was open to proposals. Keri Powers, First Bloom coordinator, along with Tena Coker, of Girls Inc., decided to make it a summer program starting in May 2009. The Heritage Garden is a representation of an 1860s Officer's Wife's Garden during the second Fort era. The garden is behind the officers quarters where many of the officers wives would have had their gardens growing vegetables, flowers and herbs. Everything in the garden served a purpose during the Victorian age; a garden was an outdoor parlor, a place to educate and to gossip.\n\nGirls Inc. participants ranged from five to fourteen years of age, with an average of twenty to thirty girls participating in the program. No power tools were used, only period tools. Seeds planted were from the 1860s or earlier. The only modern tool used was the water hose used by Powers when the girls were not present; the girls used watering cans. They learned how to play with tops, make cats cradles and buzz saws, and also to make church dolls. History lessons provided the girls the story of Judge Parker and the history of Fort Smith. The girls were taught gardening, sewing, quilting, and how to act like young ladies. Plans for the future include cooking in Dutch ovens and canning, giving the girls skills which will be useful to them throughout their lives.\n\nWhile in Washington, during the first week in July, the girls met with Senator Mark Pryor, Senator Blanche Lincoln, Congressman John Boozman, and National Park Service Deputy Director Mickey Fearn. They were invited to the White House where they watched the President of the United States walk across the White House Lawn and board Marine One. Pryor, Lincoln and Boozman promised to visit the girls and their Heritage Garden.\n\nFirst Bloom promotes urban underserved youth by having native or heirloom gardens planted in the National Parks. The guidelines are to teach urban, underserved youth about our National Parks through gardening. This helps promote stewardship, teaches youth about their heritage, and gives them an understanding of where their food comes from. First Bloom is about building the future stewards of our National Parks.\n\nSee www.FirstBloom.org for more information on the program.\n\nConfederate Rest Memorial Service\n\nHeld at Historic Oak Cemetery\n\nSunday, May 16, 2010, members of the Varina Jefferson Davis Chapter #252, United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) and members of the General R. M. Gano Camp #561, Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV) presented a memorial service in remembrance of those Confederate veterans buried in Confederate Rest at Oak Cemetery in Fort Smith, Arkansas. Guest speaker Judge Jim Spears gave a short memorial presentation.\n\nBarbara Coleman, registrar for the United Daughters of the Confederacy, became interested in the Confederate Rest lot at Oak Cemetery when she found the original deed for the property among old UDC records. The plot was in disarray and only one of the graves of Southern veterans in the plot was marked. Coleman researched the veterans records, and completed the applications for the official markers, a two-year process. Mrs. Sue Clark, author of Oak Cemetery, Fort Smith, Arkansas, Fort Smiths City Cemetery, assisted with the research. Coleman coordinated the work of members of the UDC and SCV, as well as the Oak Cemetery staff, in setting the grave markers and getting Confederate Rest ready for the ceremony. Richard Lewis, Sexton of Oak Cemetery was instrumental in seeing that the markers were received, stored, and placed correctly. Friends of Oak Cemetery donated funds to pay for restoring the coping at the side of Confederate Rest and two non - military markers, those of Mrs. Josephine Foster and Noah Belote. Members of the SCV and their families, along with UDC members and families helped set the stones.\n\nThose buried in Confederate Rest receiving markers\n\nGeorge W.
