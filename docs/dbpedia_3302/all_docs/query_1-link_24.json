        "text": "Sen. John Boozman serves as the senior senator from the state of Arkansas.\n\nOn Jan. 5, Sen. Boozman released a statement opposing efforts to object to certifying the Electoral College results, stating “not one of the lawsuits filed found evidence of widespread fraud or irregularities that would have changed the outcome of the election. Similarly, not a single state’s outcome changed as a result of requested recounts.” He went on to say that we “cannot erode the ideals that generations of Americans have fought to protect simply because we do not like the outcome of the election.”"
