There is no admission fee.\n\nThrough the exhibit meet prominent families and everyday people who were born, raised and lived in Fort Smith and had an impact on the history of the area.\n\nThe exhibit traces the city’s rich African American history from the first free black soldiers who arrived with Major William Bradford’s elite rifle regiment in 1817 to settle the first Fort Smith to the Civil War and the 11th United States Colored Infantry, which was established at Fort Smith in 1863 and through the years of Judge Isaac C. Parker and the famous African American U. S. Deputy Marshal Bass Reeves.\n\nInto the twentieth century, follow the career of the celebrated jazz musician Alphonso Trent. Learn of the famous entertainers who frequented North 9th Street such as Ike and Tina Turner and James Brown. Meet Rudy Ray Moore, a Fort Smith native known for his stand-up comedy and the well-known 1975 cult film Dolemite.\n\nFort Smith police officers, businesses, schools and families are revealed through the fascinating history of Fort Smith’s thriving African American community.\n\nFort Smith Museum of History is located at 320 Rogers Avenue.
