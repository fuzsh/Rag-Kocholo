        "text": "Following the King‚Äôs Speech and the state opening of Parliament, the next few weeks will see a wave of policy details fleshing out the Government‚Äôs ambitious commitments to drive forward new housebuilding and infrastructure projects. Alexander Sabin explores the key early priorities for the Government, and investigates how these policy areas are expected to adapt in the near future, as well as the wider impact to the built environment sector. To read this analysis in further detail, click here: https://lnkd.in/eEvjgywv Tomorrow, we‚Äôll take a deep dive into the King‚Äôs Speech, examining the key announcements made by the Prime Minister with further in-depth analysis on the effect on the built environment. To keep up to date with the latest policy announcements, sign up to our Political Insights newsletter by contacting us here: politicalinsights@kandaconsulting.co.uk To find out more about our political insights offer, click here: https://lnkd.in/ecrt_uiF\n\nWould you like to participate on an IAC steering committee? IAC's committee members play a crucial role in developing policy for county government and legislation necessary to counties and their citizens. It is up to you to be a part of the decision-making process. Get involved, be heard, and make a difference! Idaho's county elected officials are allowed and encouraged to sign up for up to two IAC committees, and the term lasts for one year. The deadline to sign up is December 31, 2023. Those who participated last year and wish to do so again will need to sign up again by the deadline. IAC steering committees include: - Public Lands - Transportation & Infrastructure - Intergovernmental Affairs - Justice and Public Safety Learn more and sign up here: https://lnkd.in/gJ6PGcNd\n\nüò≤ Just listened to this short interview of Paul Dans from the Heritage Foundation with Steve Bannon, explaining their \"Project 2025\" transition plan, preparing for a \"conservative\" (read: far-right) victory in the US elections in November 2024, so in a bit more than a year. üí• It's a chilling account of how to achieve authoritarian state capture. It reminds me of Orb√°n's methods in Hungary: Changing the Constitution, dismantling the judiciary, restricting media freedom, destroying independent government bodies, and most importantly, replacing all civil servants with your \"own\". They are very much preparing for a brutal \"takeover\". And we cannot say that we didn't know: It's out there, for all of us to read: https://lnkd.in/ecWqbnFh Two more things that strike me: ‚úä The American far-right is organised and united. Over 80 conservative groups joined this \"Project 2025\", setting aside their differences. Progressives should learn from that: You will never win an election if you keep bickering among yourselves. ‚úè They have understood the value of staff and training. They offer courses, capacity-building and focus on recruitment over a year before the election. Investing in the people is smart - progressives should learn from that. üìù Here is their policy programme in full length for those who want to see what to expect should Trump or any other far-right candidate win (which, unfortunately, is a rather likely scenario): https://lnkd.in/ePT2V4D9) üì∫ And the interview: https://lnkd.in/etJpFUGD"
