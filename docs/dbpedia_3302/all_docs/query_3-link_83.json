From politicians to actors, athletes to musicians, they made their mark on history, and their paths were as diverse as the reasons for their fame. Most have passed away, though a rare few could still hit the century mark.\n\nSo let’s delve into the lives of some of the most celebrated figures of that remarkable cohort, including Shirley Chisholm, Daniel Inouye, and George H. W. Bush. We’ll take a look at the most common occupations of famous Americans born in 1924, where they were born, and the exciting centennial celebrations that lie ahead.\n\nAnd it all starts with this map built from a list of names, birthdates, and birthplaces:\n\nView American Celebrities Born 100 Years Ago in a full screen map\n\nMost Common Occupations of Famous Americans Born in 1924\n\nThe American celebrities born 100 years ago all shared the same birth year. But the reasons for their celebrity varied significantly, though some were more common than others.\n\nAmerican politician – 22 American celebrities born in 1924\n\nAmerican actress – 17\n\nAmerican actor – 17\n\nAmerican musician – 5\n\nAmerican basketball player – 5\n\nAmerican singer – 4\n\nAmerican female baseball player – 4\n\nActress – 4\n\nAmerican judge – 3\n\nAmerican female professional baseball player – 3\n\nAmerican baseball player – 3\n\nThe majority of 280+ celebrities born in 1924 were famous for their jobs as politicians, actors, or athletes. Famous politicians born in the year included Shirley Chisholm, the first African American woman elected to the U.S. Congress and the first woman to seek the Democratic Party’s nomination for President. Also among this group are Daniel Inouye, Frank Church, and Ed Koch.\n\nHowever, politicians with more than one occupation are not included among these, such as George H. W. Bush, the 41st President of the U.S.\n\nAs for athletes, among the five American basketball players is Bob Kurland. Kurland played for the Phillips 66ers and was a two-time Olympic gold medalist.\n\nAmerican’s pastime is also well-represented by the likes of Gil Hodges, Al Rosen, and Pepper Paire, a member of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League (AAGPBL), which was featured in the movie “A League of Their Own.” Check out the rest of the occupations on the map before moving on to birthplaces.\n\nWhere Were They Born?\n\nThe map highlights the 281 famous Americans born in 1924, which is certainly the case for the majority (97.5%). Yet several people were born in countries other than the U.S. before moving and making a name for themselves.\n\nThe two German-born celebs were German-American physicist and astrophysicist Gerson Goldhaber, born in February and actress Maria Riva, born in December. There are also two Canadians (artist Buddy MacMaster and politician Weston E. Vivian). Additionally, there is one person from Austria, China, and Italy each.\n\nMeanwhile, in the U.S., New York (51), Texas (21), and Illinois (18) are the top three homestates, with N.Y.C. (20), Chicago (11), and Brooklyn (10) being the most popular cities.\n\nCelebs Celebrating Their 100th Birthdays in 2024\n\nEnough about occupations and birthplaces… it’s time for even more personal details about these famous folks born 100 years ago: their ages. Here are the 19 people who may celebrate their 100th birthday in 2024.\n\nBirth Month Name January Charlie Munger March William H.
