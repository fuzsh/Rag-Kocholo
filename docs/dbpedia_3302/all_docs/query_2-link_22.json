        "text": "Sacramento, CA: Tea Party Express, the nation's largest grassroots Tea Party political action committee, is pleased to announce its endorsement of John Boozman for re-election to the United States Senate from the State of Arkansas.\n\nTea Party Express Co-Founder and Chief Strategist Sal Russo said, âSenator Boozman understands one of the greatest threats to our nation is the out-of-control spending policies crafted by liberal bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. Throughout his time as a U.S. Senator, he has proven to be a principled fighter with a steadfast commitment to promoting individual responsibility through a limited government. His unwavering dedication to reining in out-of-control spending has earned him endorsements from conservative heroes like President Donald Trump and Sarah Huckabee Sanders.\n\nâAs a life-long accomplished businessman, Senator Boozman knows small businesses are the backbone of our economy and has used his business experience and commonsense knowledge in the Senate to craft legislation that actually helps the people of Arkansas. He understands our economy thrives best without overreaching and burdensome regulations choking the life out of thriving small businesses and farmers, and his commitment to promote a pro-growth agenda has helped Arkansans keep more of their hard-earned dollars in their own pockets.\n\nâBorn and raised in Arkansas, Senator Boozman has never forgotten his roots and has remained a fierce champion for the people of Arkansas. A friend of farmers, he has worked tirelessly to advocate for the needs of the agriculture community by reducing and streamlining government programs.\n\nâTea Party Express applauds his strong record of fiscal conservatism and conviction to fight back against the out-of-touch liberal elites in Washington, D.C. and for the people of Arkansas. We are honored to offer our endorsement to Senator Boozman for re-election to the United States Senate,â Russo concluded.\n\nThe following are statements from local leaders:\n\nâI want my senator to stand for commonsense, conservative values. Lower my taxes. Keep the government off my back. Donât waste my tax dollars. John Boozman gets it. Time and time again, he has fought for those principlesâand won.â - State Senator Bart Hester\n\nâWhether it be lower taxes, a less intrusive federal government or an end to wasteful spending, John Boozman fights for the conservative values we hold dear. Weâd all be a lot better off if Washington had more John Boozmans.â - State Representative Howard Beaty\n\n\"Joe Biden was once part of a party which cared about this country and was willing to work across the isle for the betterment of same. NO LONGER! His policies, which enable a far left, socialist, radical agenda are crippling our nation. Biden has always done what the majority wanted him to do, regardless of the consequences and effect it had on the American people. Senator Boozman is the exact opposite. His conservative values and policies are and always have been in the best interest of the people of Arkansas and the nation as a whole. In this changing political climate, Senator Boozman is a steadfast beacon to guide us and give comfort for the turbulent times ahead. We need him now more than ever and Iâm proud to endorse his continued senatorial run with his next victory.\" - Lee Andreadis, Law Enforcement Officer, Springdale, Arkansas\n\nâWashington is a mess. We need John Boozmanâs voice in the Senate to get us back on track. John Boozman listens to us and speaks for us, countering Bidenâs bad ideas with a commonsense, conservative approach that seeks to shrink government, not grow it.â - State Senator Ben Gilmore"
