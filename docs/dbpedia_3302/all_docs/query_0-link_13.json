        "text": "American ophthalmologist\n\nFay Winford Boozman III (November 10, 1946 â€“ March 19, 2005) was an American ophthalmologist and politician who served as a member of the Arkansas Senate from 1995 to 1999.\n\nBoozman was born in 1946, the son of Marie Nicholas and U.S. Air Force master sergeant Fay Winford Boozman Jr. He attended Tulane University, Hendrix College and the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, receiving a degree in ophthalmology. Boozman and his brother John founded an eye clinic. He was married to Vickey and had three children.[1]\n\nHe served in the Arkansas Air National Guard from 1971 to 1977, becoming a major in February 1977 and serving in the Vietnam War.[1][2][3]\n\nHe was elected to the Arkansas Senate in 1994 from the 33rd district.[1]\n\nBoozman was Arkansas' Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in 1998. During the campaign, Boozman caused controversy with his comments about rape, claiming that women rarely became pregnant after being raped due to a hormone he described as \"God's little protective shield\".[1] He ultimately lost to Representative Blanche Lincoln by 13 points. His younger brother, John, would go on to defeat Lincoln to win the Senate seat in 2010. In 1999, Boozman was named director of the Arkansas Department of Health by Mike Huckabee, a post he held until his death in 2005.[4]\n\nBoozman died on March 19, 2005, following an accident at his farm in Rogers. Local officials say he was working alone in his barn when part of the structure collapsed, causing his death. [4] After this, the College of Public Health at the University of Arkansas for Medical Science, from which he graduated, was renamed after him.[1]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFay Boozman at the Encyclopedia of Arkansas\n\nFay Boozman at Find a Grave"
