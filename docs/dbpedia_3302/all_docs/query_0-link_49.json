        "text": "FORT SMITH -- The city honored late community leader Euba Mae Harris-Winton on Wednesday by putting up an honorary street sign across from the former location of the Mallalieu Community Center where she volunteered, declaring the area as Euba Harris-Winton Street.\n\n\"I've spent many a time hanging on this corner,\" Mayor George McGill said. \"This is where Miss Winton shared her wisdom, knowledge and passion for this community.\"\n\nCity officials hosted a ceremony Wednesday to unveil the new sign at the corner of North Ninth and North H streets. The new sign incorrectly read \"Winton Harris\" instead of \"Harris-Winton,\" but McGill said the city will fix the mistake.\n\nEuba Harris-Winton Street is not the official street name. Rather, the name and the street indicator are meant to mark the area in which Harris-Winton did much of her work for the community.\n\nHarris-Winton's family gathered for the ceremony, and many people were dressed in yellow, her favorite color. Family members spoke about her impact on the community and recalled stories about her life, such as how she treated everyone she met like family and her affinity for green Jello.\n\nHer grandson, Matthew Conley, laughed as he recalled a time when Harris-Winton took in a refugee mother and son, and he had to give up his bed for them to sleep in it. It was inconvenient for him at the time, but it spoke to his grandmother's generous nature and now is a fond memory, he said.\n\nConley sparked the project in 2019 after his grandmother passed away at 95 years old.\n\n\"I knew a statue would be hard to get made, so I said, 'I bet they can change a street name,'\" Conley said in an interview after the ceremony.\n\nHe approached Andre Good, a member of the city's Board of Directors, and the two began work on a project to honor Harris-Winton for her work in the community.\n\n\"Street naming is a tradition that dates back centuries,\" Good said during the ceremony. \"It is a way to honor individuals who have made significant contributions to society and have made a profound impact on their communities. This form of tribute is particularly meaningful because it becomes part of the city's identity and history.\"\n\nHarris-Winton, who was born in Cotton Plant in 1923, moved to Fort Smith and opened Mallalieu Community Center in 1970. Through the center, she helped the United Methodist Church of Arkansas to strengthen its community outreach, according to the church's website.\n\nHarris-Winton primarily volunteered with low-income families, helping people get their college degrees and find work. She was the first Black delegate from the North Arkansas conference to attend the United Methodist General Conference. Delegates from different divisions of the church around the world meet to discuss the church's policies and future during the conference, according to the United Methodist Conference website.\n\n\"I wear this collar because Miss Winton told me that when I show up -- and when you show up as a pastor and as a woman and as a woman of color -- you show up and you represent the church and you represent God,\" said LaToya Shepherd, a pastor with the Mission United Methodist Church, in reference to how Harris-Winton helped her find the vocation.\n\nSen. John Boozman, R-Ark., told Harris-Winton's story on the floor of the U.S. Capitol after she died in March 2019. Boozman recalled during that congressional session her work to improve substandard housing, fight poverty, increase educational opportunities and personally assist anyone in need.\n\nConley, during his post-ceremony interview, also brought attention to Harris-Winton's work helping refugees from Cuba and her emphasis on the importance of literacy and strengthening a person's mind.\n\nConley's mother is Harris-Winton's youngest daughter, Erica Walker. Walker spoke during an interview about how her mother's work affected her childhood.\n\nWalker said Harris-Winton's dedication meant her mother spent the majority of her time volunteering.\n\n\"It was like I had to share her with everyone, and when I was little I didn't really want to do it,\" Walker said. \"But as I got older and I saw people continually say my mom did this and that for them, it's like your heart just starts getting bigger and bigger, and you don't mind sharing her anymore.\""
