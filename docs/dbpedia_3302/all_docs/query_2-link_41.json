        "text": "U.S. Congress statements on Hammerschmidt's death (April 28, 2015)\n\nU.S. Sen. John Boozman\n\nMr. President, I’m here today to honor a longtime champion of Arkansas, Congressman John Paul Hammerschmidt who passed away earlier this month at the age of 92, after a long life as a dedicated public servant.\n\nAs a member of the Greatest Generation, John Paul served as a combat pilot during WWII and was a decorated war hero.\n\nAs Congressman for the 3rd District of Arkansas for 26 years, and the only Republican member of the delegation at the time, he worked across the aisle to provide infrastructure improvements to Arkansas, paving the way for the growth in the northwest corner of the state.\n\nEven following his retirement more than 20 years ago, John Paul continued to serve the people who fondly referred to him as JPH. He always put Arkansas first. His vision for a two-party system in Arkansas led him to seek elected office. He paved the way for the Republican Party in the state and his vision continues to be realized as the party continues its growth in the state.\n\nJohn Paul is a name that is just as familiar in Arkansas as it is to my colleagues in the Senate who served with him before serving in this chamber as well as the many members in the House who worked alongside him during his years of elected service and decades more of providing assistance to his beloved Arkansas.\n\nYou would have been hard-pressed to find a kinder, gentler man than John Paul Hammerschmidt.\n\nAs a mentor and friend, John Paul’s wisdom and counsel has shaped my time in Washington more than anyone else. When I ran for Congress in 2001, I sought John Paul out for advice.\n\nI quickly learned, as a newly elected member of Congress for the 3rd District of Arkansas, how fond his former colleagues were of him.\n\nSenior members of the House of Representatives had so much respect for him that they welcomed me into their circle because he had given his approval.\n\nIt was John Paul who taught me that after the election is over, there are no more Republicans, no more Democrats, only the people of Arkansas. His dedication to his constituents during his career in public service was unmatched and is a marker we should all strive to meet.\n\nDuring his time in Congress, he served in the minority, but he would disagree without being disagreeable.\n\nI always valued John Paul’s friendship and his continued advice.\n\nJohn Paul set the standard for helping Arkansans. That bar is something members of the Arkansas Congressional Delegation continue to strive toward today.\n\nHis vision to improve life for Arkansans led him to serve on the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee as well as the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. By the time he retired, he served as the latter’s Ranking Member. Using his position on the T&I Committee, he helped secure funds for roads and infrastructure projects including Interstate-540 which now bears his name, the Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport, as well as protecting the Buffalo River under the designation as a National River.\n\nJohn Paul left big shoes to fill.\n\nHe believed he could make a difference in the lives of Arkansans because he believed in loving his fellow man.\n\nWe are capitalizing on the benefits he helped provide, a testament to his time in Washington.\n\nFrom all Arkansans, I thank John Paul for his devotion to public service, his leadership and his dedication to Arkansas. His example is something we should continue to strive for in Washington.\n\nU.S. Rep. Steve Womack\n\nMr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a dedicated public servant, a respected businessman, a decorated combat veteran, and a trusted mentor - former Third District of Arkansas Representative John Paul Hammerschmidt- who passed away on April 1, at the age of 92.\n\nJohn Paul believed that we are all put on earth to serve others; this principle guided him even from an early age. After graduating from Harrison High School at 15 and spending a year at the Citadel, he forwent West Point and instead joined the Army Air Corps. As a Second Lieutenant during World War II, he piloted an incredible 217 combat missions and earned multiple medals and decorations.\n\nAfter the war, he returned to Harrison to run his family's lumber business, and he continued his service as a member of the U.S. Air Force Reserve until 1960. It was during this time that he also became engaged with local politics, and in 1966, he became the first Republican in 93 years to have been elected to serve Arkansas in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nDuring his 26-year tenure in Congress, John Paul never spent a single day in the majority. But he didn't let that stand the way of serving his constituents to the best of his ability. He worked with all colleagues - Democrat and Republican alike - to our state's benefit and is responsible for bringing the critical transportation infrastructure to northwest Arkansas that enabled its explosive growth. However, he will truly be remembered for defining the gold standard of constituent service. Simply put, no one did it better. Every day, John Paul prayed to our Lord for the strength to overcome pride and self-concern to always be mindful of the needs of others. Looking back on his life, I would say he was blessed with just that and for it, our state and our nation will be forever grateful for him and his service.\n\nMr. Speaker, on Saturday, John Paul will be laid to rest, and as we prepare to say our final goodbyes, I ask for a moment of silence to honor of one of the finest examples of a statesman this Chamber has ever seen. Rest in peace, John Paul. I yield back the balance of my time.\n\nU.S. Rep. Bruce Westerman\n\nCongressman John Paul Hammerschmidt began serving as a member of this body from my lifelong home state of Arkansas in 1967, the year I was born, and he did so for 12 terms...long enough for me to grow up, graduate from college, get a job, and get married.\n\nHe was a fixture in Arkansas politics and even though I grew up in a different district than he represented, John Paul Hammerschmidt was a household name in my family. His love for Arkansas and America was evident in his service. He was a champion for his district and our state and helped to transform the hills of Northwest Arkansas through his work to secure funding for the construction of what is now known as Interstate 49.\n\nBut Congressman Hammerschmidt was known for much more than securing infrastructure funding. He was a tireless advocate for all constituents from the Third District and across Arkansas. He was friends with men and women on both sides of the aisle and worked hardest to do what was right for the citizens of Arkansas, regardless of political identification. He served his country and fellow man with honor both in the military and in congress leaving a lasting legacy and setting the bar high for those of us who follow him. Congressman Hammerschmidt is terribly missed by his family, friends, and those of us who follow him in service. He was from the beautiful Ozark hills of Arkansas and many times the people of Arkansas and America were blessed by the leadership of a gentleman from the hills who served his Creator by serving others.\n\nAs we remember his service may we all continue to look to the hills and be comforted by the words of the Psalmist who wrote: \"I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help. “My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth. “He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber. “Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber or sleep. “The Lord is thy keeper: the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand. “The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night. “The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul. “The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, end even for evermore.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Rick Crawford\n\nJohn Paul Hammerschmidt was truly a visionary champion for Arkansas’ conservative values in Congress, but we will all remember him for his humble dedication to our country and to our state. His leadership inspired new generations of Arkansans, including all of us rising today to honor his memory. A supremely successful ambassador for his district and in fact the entire state, John Paul helped build the airport and interstates that allowed northwest Arkansas to blossom into the success story it is today. 10 years ago, John Paul said, “we are all put on earth to serve others, and being a congressman gives you a lot of leverage to really serve a lot of people.” Congressman Hammerschmidt truly embodied the spirit of public service, and his legacy is a powerful reminder for all public servants of why we are here and who we represent.\n\nU.S. Rep. French Hill\n\nI rise to honor the life and legacy of one of Arkansas's great leaders and my friend, former Congressman John Paul Hammerschmidt. Congressman Hammerschmidt passed away earlier this month at the age of 92, leaving a rich history of leadership and service to his fellow Arkansans and Americans. For the past three decades I have known and admired Congressman Hammerschmidt, and I have long respected his commitment to public service.\n\nAs a young man, John Paul Hammerschmidt answered the call of his country, serving in the U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II, earning the Distinguished Flying Cross for his service. Congressman Hammerschmidt continued his service as a member of the U.S. Air Force Reserves until 1960 and in the District of Columbia Army Reserves from 1977 to 1981. Congressman Hammerschmidt served in the U.S. Congress from 1967 until 1993. As often the lone Republican representing Arkansas during his 26 years in Congress, Congressman Hammerschmidt was an important voice for Arkansans' conservative principles and helped pave the way for future Republican candidates in our great State.\n\nCongressman Hammerschmidt's lengthy career in Congress was marked by his efforts to improve the highways and interstates across Arkansas and the country. Further, his sponsorship of legislation that made the Buffalo River the country's first National River ensured the preservation and protection of this extraordinary treasure designed by God's Hand. Before John Paul's engagement, the Buffalo had been slated for a Corps of Engineers dam project, which would have destroyed the natural majesty that generations of Arkansas have enjoyed and will continue to enjoy. Arkansas's Wilderness advocate and poet, Bill Coleman, captures the region's mystic: \"Giant bluffs rise like medieval castles above this ancient river, sending us back to a time when all our land was wild.\" The Buffalo River continues to provide lasting benefits for Arkansans and is an essential tourist attraction for the State.\n\nCongressman Hammerschmidt also served as a freshman congressman with my former boss, President George Herbert Walker Bush, and these two great men and fellow pilots quickly became friends. Congressman Hammerschmidt would look back fondly on the experiences they had together, including times spent in Congress and on the campaign trail; times spent with their families, and times spent relaxing on the President's boat on the Potomac over a beer and some crackers. They were close political allies, and Congressman Hammerschmidt was quick to support President Bush in all of his Presidential runs. The two men shared victories, defeats, joys, and sorrows throughout their decades of friendship. President Bush once said of John Paul, \"He did something I could never do, he beat Bill Clinton.\"\n\nI am humbled to have had the opportunity to know and learn so much from Congressman Hammerschmidt. His devotion to his constituents and dedication to working on behalf of his district, his state and his nation is unparalleled, and I strive to follow his example as I continue to serve the great citizens of Arkansas and the Second Congressional District. I join all Arkansans in saluting his service and extend my warmest regards and prayers to his family, long-time friends and former staff members, and loved ones. He will be missed greatly.\n\nPryor Center interview • 2009\n\nCredit: Pryor Center for Arkansas Oral and Visual History.

John Boozman, R-Ark.\n\n“You would have been hard-pressed to find a kinder, gentler man than John Paul Hammerschmidt. As a mentor and friend, John Paul’s wisdom and counsel has shaped my time in Washington more than anyone else.\n\nIt was John Paul who taught me that after the election is over, there are no more Republicans, no more Democrats, only the people of Arkansas. His dedication to his constituents during his career in public service was unmatched and is a marker we should all strive to meet.\n\nJohn Paul was the embodiment of a true public servant. His legacy will live on as a testament to the way those serving in Washington should operate.”\n\nGov. Asa Hutchinson\n\n“John Paul Hammerschmidt was an icon of Arkansas and Washington politics. For years, he was the lone Republican member of Arkansas’s congressional delegation, representing the Third Congressional District for 13 terms. As such, he balanced his conservative convictions with a unique ability to work across party lines and accomplish great things for the people of Arkansas. His was the voice heard most clearly and often in the bipartisan effort to preserve the Buffalo as the first National River in the United States.\n\n“Congressman Hammerschmidt was also a leader on transportation issues, helping to build Arkansas’s roads and highways and making the state more competitive nationally. On a personal note, John Paul was a mentor of mine. I was privileged to hold his seat in Congress, and I called on his wise counsel and advice countless times. I will miss him greatly. The state has lost a true statesman and a good man.”\n\nU.S. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark.\n\n“Today, I join all Arkansans in mourning the death former Congressman John Paul Hammerschmidt. A proud son of Harrison, John Paul was a decorated World War II pilot who represented Arkansas in Congress for 26 years. His contributions to Arkansas’s infrastructure system were invaluable and his legacy lives on in highways, waterways, and bridges across our state.\n\n“John Paul Hammerschmidt was also a Republican leader for Arkansas in an era when not too many others were. His leadership and commitment to the Republican Party of Arkansas paved the way for every Republican elected official in Arkansas today. Arkansas is a better place because of his service to our state. We extend our deepest condolences to his son, John Arthur, and continue to lift the entire Hammerschmidt family up in prayer. “\n\nArkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge\n\n“I am heartbroken by the news that my dear friend and campaign chairman in my race for Attorney General, Congressman John Paul Hammerschmidt, has passed away. The Congressman has served as a mentor and friend to not only me, but countless Arkansans. His challenge to public officials that they should ‘represent all Arkansans, not just the ones who voted for you’ is a testament to his character and words that help guide me daily. For 26 years, Congressman Hammerschmidt represented Arkansas’s Third Congressional District, and even upon his retirement remained active and involved in major issues to help grow the State for future generations.\n\n“Congressman Hammerschmidt was a true public servant and constant ambassador for the State of Arkansas. My thoughts and prayers are with the Congressman’s numerous family members and friends, and the people of the Third District who he represented with consummate humility and integrity.”\n\nLt. Gov. Tim Griffin\n\n“I am saddened by the passing of my longtime friend and Arkansas legend, Congressman Hammerschmidt. He will always be remembered for his remarkable and strong leadership. Even though he was elected by only a portion of Arkansas as a Member of Congress, he was a leader for all of Arkansas and recognized nationally as such. He was a trailblazer and will be missed greatly. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends.”\n\nU.S. Rep. French Hill, R-Ark.\n\n“For the past three decades I have known and respected John Paul Hammerschmidt, and I have long admired his dedication to the public good of our state and nation. He was first and foremost a gentleman, and he earned the affection and support of his constituents by way of his unfailing gold standard of service. I join all Arkansans in saluting him for his lifetime of service, first as an airman, and then as the dean of our congressional delegation. Martha and I extend our sympathy and prayers for comfort to his fine family.”"
