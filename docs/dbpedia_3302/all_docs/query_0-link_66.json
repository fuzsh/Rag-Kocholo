        "text": "Spaniard Hernando de Soto was among the early European explorers to visit the territory in the mid-16th century, but it was a Frenchman, Henri de Tonti, who in 1686 founded the first permanent white settlement—the Arkansas Post. In 1803 the area was acquired by the U.S. as part of the Louisiana Purchase.\n\nPart of the Territory of Missouri from 1812, the area became a separate entity in 1819 after the first large wave of settlers arrived. The next several decades were marked by the development of the cotton industry and the spread of the Southern plantation system west into Arkansas. Arkansas joined the Confederacy in 1861, but from 1863 the northern part of the state was occupied by Union troops.\n\nFood products are the state's largest employing sector, with lumber and wood products a close second. Arkansas is also a leader in the production of cotton, rice, and soybeans. It also has the country's only active diamond mine; located near Murfreesboro, it is operated as a tourist attraction.\n\nHot Springs National Park and Buffalo National River in the Ozarks are major state attractions. Blanchard Springs Caverns, the Historic Arkansas Museum at Little Rock, the William J. Clinton Birthplace in Hope, and the Arkansas Folk Center in Mountain View are also of interest. New in 2011 is the Crystal Bridges Museum for American Art, designed by Moshe Safdie, which houses the collection of Walmart heiress Alice Walton.\n\nIn 2008, Arkansas joined the unfortunate list of states that have suffered school shootings: four men were charged with capital murder and other felonies for the fatal shootings of two students and wounding of a third near a University of Central Arkansas dormitory.\n\nFlash floods swept through Albert Pike Recreation Area, killing 19 in 2010. One year later, the Mississippi River flooded more than 1 million acres and 63 counties were declared disaster areas.\n\nSee more on Arkansas:\n\nEncyclopedia: Arkansas\n\nEncyclopedia: Geography\n\nEncyclopedia: Economy\n\nEncyclopedia: Government\n\nEncyclopedia: History\n\nMonthly Temperature Extremes\n\nAll U.S. States: Geography & Climate\n\nPrintable Outline Maps\n\nRecord Highest Temperatures\n\nRecord Lowest Temperatures\n\nHighest, Lowest, and Mean Elevations\n\nLand and Water Area\n\nAll U.S. States: Population & Economy\n\nHistorical Population Statistics, 1790–Present\n\nPer Capita Personal Income\n\nMinimum Wage Rates\n\nState Taxes\n\nFederal Government Expenditure\n\nPercent of People in Poverty\n\nBirths and Birth Rates\n\nHomeownership\n\nPercentage of Uninsured by State\n\nAll U.S. States: Society & Culture:\n\nMost Livable States\n\nHealthiest States\n\nMost Dangerous States\n\nSmartest States\n\nCrime Index\n\nResidency Requirements for Voting\n\nCompulsory School Attendance Laws\n\nDriving Laws\n\nNational Public Radio Stations\n\nSelected famous natives and residents:"
