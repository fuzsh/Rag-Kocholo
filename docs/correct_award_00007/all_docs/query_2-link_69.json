        "text": "Marie (Maria Pl.) Sklodowska-Curie was born November 7, 1867 in Warsaw, Poland. She died on July 4, 1934, as the best-known woman in the history of science. She held degrees in mathematics and physics, and with her discoveries of the radioactive elements radium and polonium, Marie opened the new discipline of radioactivity.\n\nShe was recognized in 1903 with the Nobel Prize in Physics, together with her husband Pierre Curie and Antoine Henri Becquerel. In 1911, she received the second Nobel Prize, this time in Chemistry.\n\nMarie Curie was not only an accomplished scientist, but also a mother. After the sudden accidental death of Pierre Curie, Marie Curie managed to raise her two small daughters Irene and Eve, and to continue an active career in experimental radioactivity opening a new era in medical research and treatment. Her two daughters marked the history as well. Irene became a scientist and was awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935 along with her husband in recognition of their synthesis of new radioactive elements. Eve became a known writer, and authored a book \"Madame Curie\" in 1937, which details on the life of her extraordinary mother and scientist.\n\nMaria Sklodowska-Curie is notable for her many firsts\n\n(reference from the Polish web site dedicated to Madame Curie by Zwolinski, Z. \"Maria Sklodowska-Curie, 1867-1934.\" http://www.staff.amu.edu.pl/~zbzw/ph/sci/msc.htm).\n\nShe was the first to use the term radioactivity for this phenomenon.\n\nShe was the first woman in Europe to receive her doctorate of science.\n\nIn 1903, she became the first woman to win a Nobel Prize for Physics. The award, jointly awarded to Curie, her husband Pierre, and Henri Becquerel, was for the discovery of radioactivity.\n\nShe was also the first female lecturer, professor and head of Laboratory at the Sorbonne University in Paris (1906).\n\nIn 1911, she won an unprecedented second Nobel Prize (this time in chemistry) for her discovery and isolation of pure radium and radium components. She was the first person ever to receive two Nobel Prizes.\n\nMadame Curie was the first woman to receive a Gold Medal from the Radiological Society of North America in 1922, and the American College of Radiology in 1931.\n\nShe was the first mother-Nobel Prize Laureate of daughter-Nobel Prize Laureate. Her oldest daughter Irene Joliot-Curie also won a Nobel Prize for Chemistry (1935).\n\nShe is the first woman who has been laid to rest under the famous dome of the Pantheon in Paris for her own merits. \"\n\nOn-line exhibits dedicated to Marie Sklodowska-Curie:\n\nMarie Curie receives ACR Gold Medal\n\nNational Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST)\n\nPhysics Laboratory Virtual Museum\n\n\"Marie Curie and the NBS Radium Standards\" - This exhibit focuses on Marie's connections to the national radium standards of the United States.\n\nMuseum of Maria Sklodowska-Curie organized by the Polish Chemical Society - This is an overview of the collection of memorabilia related to Madame Curie, exhibited in the museum situated in a historic XVIII century house in Warsaw, where Maria was born in 1867.\n\nMarie (Maria Pl.)
