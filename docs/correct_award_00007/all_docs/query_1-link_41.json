        "text": "8 October 2021\n\nJournalists Maria Ressa, from the Philippines, and Dmitry Muratov, from Russia, have won the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize for their \"efforts to safeguard freedom of expression\".\n\nWhy are the organisation's prizes so prestigious, and who are some of the previous winners?\n\nFamous past winners\n\nFormer US President Barack Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, for \"his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and co-operation between peoples\".\n\nPresident Obama said he was \"surprised and deeply humbled\" and would use it as a \"call to action\". However, there was criticism of his award, especially as he had only been in office for 12 days before the nomination deadline.\n\nOther notable winners include former US President Jimmy Carter (2002); child education activist Malala Yousafzai (shared 2014); the European Union (2012); the United Nations and its then-general-secretary, Kofi Annan, (shared 2001); and Saint Teresa of Calcutta (1979).\n\nAlbert Einstein (physics 1921),Marie Curie (physics 1903 and chemistry 1911), and Harold Pinter (literature 2005) have also received Nobel prizes.\n\nTwo people - author and philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre in 1964 and Vietnamese politician Le Duc Tho in 1973 - rejected the prize, and four others were forced to decline by their countries.\n\nIn 2016, there was uncertainty over whether singer Bob Dylan would accept the literature award before he finally delivered his lecture for the prize in June 2017.\n\nWhat are the prizes awarded?\n\nThe Nobel prizes are a series of annual awards given in the fields of physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, and peace.\n\nThey are awarded to people \"who have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind\" in the previous 12 months.\n\nThe quote is from the will of Swedish businessman - and inventor of dynamite - Alfred Nobel. He left most of his fortune in a fund to launch the awards, which were first presented in 1901.\n\nIn 1968, an economic sciences prize was added by Sweden's central bank, although it does not count as a Nobel prize.\n\nHow do they work?\n\nDifferent organisations award the prize in each category every year. Five of the six are chosen in Sweden, while the Nobel Peace Prize is selected in Norway.\n\nAcademics, university professors, scientists, previous winners and others all submit nominations. Under the Nobel Foundation's rules, the shortlists are not allowed to be published for 50 years.\n\nPrize winners are called laureates, to signify the laurel wreath given to victors of contests in ancient Greece.\n\nMore than one, but no more than three, people can win each prize.\n\nThere have been some years when the prize has not been awarded - mostly during the two world wars.\n\nAnd Nobel Foundation rules state if nobody deserves the prize in a particular category, it is not awarded and its prize money is kept for the following year.\n\nWhat do the winners receive?\n\nThe recipient of each prize receives three things:\n\na Nobel diploma, each of which is a unique work of art\n\na Nobel medal, which have some differing designs\n\na cash prize of 10m Swedish krona (£836,000; $1.1m) - which is split between winners when there is more than one. They have to deliver a lecture to receive the money\n\nThe prizes are presented at ceremonies on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death, in Stockholm and Oslo.\n\nWhat have some prize winners bought with their winnings?\n\nMarie and Pierre Curie used their physics prize money in 1903 for further scientific research, and 2006 physics winner John Mather donated his cash to his foundation.\n\nWho are the 2021 winners?"
