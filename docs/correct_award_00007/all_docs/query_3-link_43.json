She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and remains the only person to have received Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields!\nIn 1903, she, along with her husband Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel, received the Nobel Prize in Physics for their work on radioactivity. In 1911, she earned her second Nobel Prize, this time in Chemistry, for her discovery of the elements #polonium and #radium.\nHer groundbreaking research laid the foundation for advancements in medical and industrial applications of radioactivity. Despite facing challenges as a woman in the male-dominated scientific community of her time, she made significant contributions to science and left a legacy!\n#DidYouKnow Marieâ€™s notebooks are still stored in lead-lined boxes in France? They were so contaminated with radium that they were radioactive upon her passing in 1934 and will be for many years to come!\n#WomensHistoryMonth #WomenInSTEM #photonics\".",
