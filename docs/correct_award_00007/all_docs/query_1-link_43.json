        "text": "Electrons move so incredibly fast that they were long thought to be unobservable. Despite the difficulties, many researchers were determined to try in different ways. What motivated these efforts, you might ask? Curiosity, of course.\n\nBut also because knowledge can be translated into practical benefits. If we learn more about nature's smallest building blocks, we can eventually control them. Since electrons control the properties of all materials – electrons are the contact surface of the atom with the outside world – there is potential for their application in virtually all areas where the aim is to influence materials at the molecular and atomic levels.\n\nPerhaps in the future, the laser method that creates these attosecond pulses will allow us to better understand photosynthesis, develop more efficient solar cell technologies or build electronics at the molecular level. Several medical applications have also been mentioned. Some of these tracks are already being explored, while others are still at the idea – or dream – stage.\n\nBack to basic research. In all honesty, we cannot \"see\" an electron cloud in real-time. However, thanks to attosecond pulses, the extremely fast-moving electrons can now be studied after all.\n\nFacts | Anne L'Huillier\n\nAnne L'Huillier has been a professor of physics at the Department of Physics, LTH, Lund University since 1997. The journey towards the Nobel Prize begins in France with a double master's degree in 1979 – in physics and mathematics, respectively – and a Ph.D. in physics in 1986.\n\nIn 1987, Anne L'Huillier conducts one of the first groundbreaking experiments demonstrating how overtones of light are generated when intense laser light is passed through noble gases. Research in attosecond physics continues for Anne L'Huillier in Sweden, the USA, and France, and in 1995, she becomes affiliated with Lund University and LTH.\n\nAnne L'Huillier has supervised around thirty doctoral students and taught courses on laser physics, photonics, and atomic physics. She has held several scientific appointments, including serving as a member of the Nobel Committee for Physics from 2007 to 2015, with the final year as the chairperson.\n\nShe has also been awarded numerous honors, with some of the recent ones being:\n\n2022\n\nWolf Prize in Physics (shared with F. Krausz and P. Corkum)\n\nBBVA Frontiers of Knowledge Award (shared with F. Krausz and P. Corkum)\n\n2023\n\nLund University Gold Medal\n\nBerthold Leibinger Zukunftspreis\n\nNobel Prize in Physics (shared with P. Agostini and F. Krausz)\n\nDown in the basement of the Department of Physics, the now world-famous short laser pulses are fired almost daily. This is home to Sweden’s cutting-edge research in attosecond physics. According to Per Eng-Johnsson, professor in atomic, molecular and optical physics at the Faculty of Engineering (LTH), the research field is currently in the midst of a paradigm shift.\n\nThe term “DIY” may appear to be an unlikely description of a high-tech laser laboratory used by a Nobel Prize-winning scientist. Yet this is the word Per Eng-Johnsson chooses to describe some aspects of the laser systems used by the 25 researchers and doctoral students at Lund University when investigating the world with attosecond pulses.\n\nRead the article"
