Born on May 15, 1859, French scientist Pierre Curie had initially rejected the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics. Pierre, who discovered radium and polonium with wife Marie Curie, accepted the award on the condition that her contribution was also recognised, making Marie the first-ever female Nobel Laureate. Marie later won a solo Chemistry Nobel in 1911 following Pierre's death.
