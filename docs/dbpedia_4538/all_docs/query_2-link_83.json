        "text": "A few weeks ago Sir Tom Jones was flying back to London from Dean Martin's old Bel Air home where he's lived for the last three decades, when he got chatting to the steward. Jones loves chatting almost as much as he loves singing. And Tom Jones's favourite subject is Tom Jones, and so it proved on this occasion. \"Look, your album's in the paper,\" commented the steward.\n\nJones was impressed: a spread dedicated to his 39th studio record, Praise & Blame, an upcoming collection of bare-bones spiritual and gospel covers. Then he read the story. Praise & Blame had been afforded so much space because the vice-president of Island Records, one David Sharpe, had found his opinion on the album leaked to the press. \"Imagine my surprise when I walked into the office this morning to hear hymns – it could have been Sunday morning,\" Sharpe had emailed a colleague. \"My initial pleasure came to an abrupt halt when I realised that Tom Jones was singing the hymns! I have just listened to the album in its entirety and want to know if this is some sick joke????\" Apparently this wasn't the record Sharpe had in mind. \"We did not invest a fortune in an established artist for him to deliver 12 tracks from the common book of prayer [sic].\"\n\nSpeculation at a huge own goal soon gave way to a conspiracy theory: Sharpe's email happened to be leaked during Praise & Blame's promotional campaign, some 17 days after it was written. But if it was a PR stunt, two things are certain. One: that Jones wasn't in on it – \"No, no, no,\" he told Radio 4's Front Row last week, when asked if he'd ever met Sharpe. Adding, darkly: \"I think it's better that I don't, really.\" And two: that Sharpe was happy to keep the ruse rolling. \"Parts of this record company wanted to deliver an album for the typical Tom Jones fan,\" he's since clarified. \"Shall we say we've paid for a Mercedes – we've got the hearse that's arrived.\"\n\nLet's hope Sharpe is better at accounting than he is at spotting hit records or, indeed, motor vehicle metaphors – because today Praise & Blame is expected to knock Eminem off the top of the charts to become Jones's third No 1 album of new material in his six-decade career. Furthermore, it will put Jones in the Guinness World Records – at 70, he will be the oldest male musician to reach No 1. More accurately it will put him back in the Guinness World Records: Jones won the same title 11 years ago with Reload, but lost his crown to Bob Dylan in 2009.\n\nReload offered a musical volte-face characteristic of Jones' singular career: on that occasion the Welsh entertainer most famous for showboating MOR tunes like What's New Pussycat? and Delilah duetted with musicians both contemporary (Robbie Williams, Stereophonics) and surprisingly credible (Portishead, Van Morrison). In 1988 he'd pulled off a similar trick, covering Prince's Kiss with avant-garde synthesiser act The Art Of Noise, for which they won an MTV Award.\n\nJones is surely the only artist to find success performing pop, rock, country, showtunes, disco, drum and bass, film scores, a Bond theme; even hip-hop.\n\nIn that sense Sharpe's expectations were on shaky ground: there hasn't been such a thing as a \"typical\" Tom Jones record for years. Made with Kings of Leon's producer Ethan Johns, Jones intended with Praise & Blame to record \"some carols, or something for Christmas\". Instead the pair conspired to \"look for some spiritual things, uplifting things, things that mean something\" and found themselves tackling material by pioneering gospel artists Sister Rosetta Tharpe and Roebuck \"Pops\" Staples, and John Lee Hooker. Their methods were stripped-down, bluesy, live. On the latter's Burning Hell a bass drum is banged like an old shoebox, while a lone guitar is viciously over-cranked: The White Stripes, effectively. Mojo magazine, who know about these things, declared the album \"remarkable\".\n\nJones's popularity has always been built on his versatility and an x-factor personality, in the original sense of the term. Like Kylie, he endures as a musician because you can hang new things on him. What remains is Jones the Voice. He was also raised, he points out, singing spiritual music, so the album is perhaps a less radical departure than it may appear.\n\nJones grew up a miner's son in Pontypridd, and would have followed his father down the pit had he not been struck down by tuberculosis at 12 and told to stay in bed for two years. By that point he'd already been singing at weddings and funerals – and was encouraged to do so. Demonstrating a tenacity that would serve him throughout his career – not to say a capacity for enjoying the limelight – Jones disliked singing with others. He hated the school choir. At Christmas he'd go carol singing alone.\n\nHe wasn't much good at school – he says he might have been a bit dyslexic, or just a bit thick – and left at 15 to carry hods on a building site. At 16 he was married to his girlfriend Linda, living at her mother's house with their baby, Mark. (They wanted more children, but a miscarriage left her infertile.) \"I think it's good that I had some experience of the real world before I became successful. When I realised I could do what I loved and be paid for it – I thought, 'This is unbelievable.' And that feeling has never left me.\"\n\nIndeed, this down-to-earthness, this good-blokiness, is surely part of Jones's appeal. Asked recently about cosmetic surgery by one journalist, he gleefully rattled through the work: teeth capped, nose straightened, eyes fixed; the goatee grown to disguise the scars where he had the fat cut from his chin.\n\nAt 23 he was fronting local act Tommy Scott and the Senators, dressed in black leathers and a frilly shirt. He travelled to London to record for famously loopy producer Joe Meek, but nothing came of it. In 1964 he was spotted at Cwmtillery's Top Hat Club by Gordon Mills; a songwriter who would become his manager. Mills wrote It's Not Unusual, intending it for Sandie Shaw. She passed, saying she'd never be able to sing it like Jones – and he was off.\n\nWhen it went top ten in America, he was advised not to put his photo on the album cover – everyone assumed he was black. \"I remember Elvis saying the same thing, 'How the hell do you sing like this?'\" Jones told him he grew up listening to black singers.\n\nIn the 1970s his income tax hit 98%, so he and Linda cleared off to LA. He had his TV variety show and his Vegas residency, though his career nosedived at the end of the decade . Worse, he'd become a parody of himself. The onstage knicker-chucking – not to say the backstage groupie area known as \"the workbench\", for which he would apparently prepare himself by dipping his genitals in Listerine – had taken over. Once, doing Howard Stern's radio show in New York, Roger Daltrey came on after him and said he thought Jones must be in the building: he'd had to walk through a room full of knickers.\n\nSo passed a 15-year period without Jones having another British hit. The 1986 death of Mills would be the spur to get him back on track. His son Mark became his manager, steering him away from the alarming outfits, tight trousers, hair dye and Listerine, towards more contemporary material.\n\nLinda has stuck by him for more than 50 years, despite all the philandering – on-record affairs include one with a reigning Miss World, a two-year fling with The Supremes' Mary Wilson and one with 24-year-old model Katherine Berkery in 1989 that resulted in a son Jonathan, whom he's never met. Shy, agoraphobic to the point of having to rely on tranquillisers and terrified of flying, Linda stays in LA with \"the cook, the maid and the man who looks after the place\". Not that's she's a pushover. Jones has confessed to a thumping after she read of one affair. (They no longer take a newspaper.)\n\nWhile his enthusiasm for the job has never been in doubt, the same cannot always have been said for his credibility. If he becomes the oldest man ever to reach No 1, Jones' greater achievement may be in discovering a musical style that helps him find credibility again. To put the knickers behind him. He's already talking about a follow-up with Ethan Johns, and has joked he'd like to duet with Eminem. \"It's great to be top of the charts with Eminem, maybe next time we could be top together.\"\n\nGiven what's come before, it actually doesn't sound that ridiculous. You wonder what David Sharpe would make of that."
