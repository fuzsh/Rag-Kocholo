        "text": "Donât Rock The Jukebox\n\nYou probably know it best from the Alvin and The Chipmunks album Chipmunks In Low Places, but it had actually already been a huge country no. 1 for Jackson on his own.\n\nSung from the perspective of a âheartbroken hillbillyâ who waits by the jukebox in a bar, telling the other customers not to interrupt the queue of country break-up songs heâs got lined up, the video features a cameo from the one and only George Jones.\n\nSadly the original doesnât include the bit where he argues with a chipmunk at the end though.\n\nLittle Bitty\n\nWritten by legendary songwriter Tom T Hall, itâs a perky paean to the smaller things in life.\n\nWhile Alan Jackson isnât actually the tallest singer in country music - Charles Kelley from Lady A and Trace Adkins are both 6â6â â heâs still pretty damn tall at 6â4â.\n\nSo, to be fair, most things are going to look fairly Lilliputian to him.\n\nTall, Tall Trees\n\nJackson inhabits a world more suited to a man of his size with this breezy cajun cut from 1995, promising his romantic interest whatever outsized object of her desire she wishes for.\n\nWhether it be a \"big limousine\", a \"great big mansion\", or rather less logistically possible, \"tall, tall trees and all the water in the seas\", you canât fault him for trying.\n\nWritten by Roger Miller and George Jones in the late 50s, Jones actually forgot heâd co-written it, until Jackson covered it nearly 40 years later for one of his many Greatest Hits collections.\n\nLivin' On Love\n\nMaybe itâs the moustache, or his gentle, fatherly smile.\n\nNo other male singer in country is capable of taking an overly sentimental love song and making it sound like the most matter of fact and unabashedly down to earth song youâve ever heard.\n\nSomehow pressing all our emotional buttons at the same time, this single from Who I Am tells the story of \"two young people without a thingâ, who finish the song as âtwo old people without a thingâ.\n\nSwinging on a porch swing after their children have moved out of home, their still âlivinâ on loveâ.\n\nIs anyone elseâs hay fever really playing up? Pass me a tissue.\n\nPop a Top\n\nAlan Jackson just loves a bar.\n\nSo much so, that he opened one of his own last year on Nashvilleâs Broadway, suitably calling it A.J.âs Good Time Bar.\n\nâPop A Topâ was written by Nat Stuckey. It had previously been a hit in the 60s for Jim Ed Brown, but Jackson revived this honky-tonk classic - complete with novelty bottle opener sound effects - for Under The Influence, his covers album of songs that had inspired him.\n\nMidnight in Montgomery\n\nHank Williams is often manifesting as a ghost in country songs, and Alan Jackson had his own encounter with him in the fourth single from Donât Rock The Jukebox.\n\nIt tells the story of how Jackson stopped off in Montgomery one New Years Eve, on the way to play a gig, to visit Hank Williamsâ grave, only for the country legend himself to pop up and thank him for visiting.\n\nRather spookily, the music video had to be rerecorded after they noticed a shadow that wasn't supposed to be there when they watched the first take back.\n\nRemember When\n\nIn this achingly poignant tribute to married life, Jackson looks back on his life with his wife, Denise.\n\nTracing the narrative arc of their love from their first time together, through to raising a family and watching their children grow up â Jackson has three daughters â he ponders on how he and his wife will reminisce about it all when theyâre old.\n\nWeâre going to need those tissues again. How does he do it?!\n\nI'll Try\n\nJackson stopped promising the moon and the stars - as well as all the âtall, tall trees and all the water in the seas\" - for a moment with this simple, honest and refreshingly realistic love song.\n\n\"I'm not perfect, just another man / but I will give you all that I am / and I'll try to love only you / and I'll try my best to be trueâ, he sings andâ¦ oh for goodness sake, just hand us the whole box of tissues, please.\n\nDrive ( For Daddy Gene)\n\nWith tissues at the ready for this one, Jackson turns a simple car song into a nostalgic through-the-ages emotional blockbuster.\n\nDedicated to his own father, the song begins by looking back at the cars and boats that he remembers growing up with, and how those vehicles related to his own memories and his relationship with his father.\n\nFrom there, he travels forward to his own daughtersâ reminiscing about the cars theyâll remember Alan letting them drive.\n\nHis three daughters, Matti, Alexandra and Dani, all starred in the video.\n\nWhere Were You (When The World Stopped Turning)\n\nTwo months after the September 11 attacks, Alan Jackson debuted his honest and thoughtful tribute at the CMA Awards in Nashville.\n\nâI'm just a singer of simple songs / I'm not a real political man / I watch CNN, but I'm not sure I can tell you the difference in Iraq and Iranâ, he sang, opening up questions rather than pushing for answers.\n\nThought-provoking without ever feeling judgemental, it was a rare foray into political commentary, which he approached with the same straightforward everydayness that he would any other subject, only adding to its poignancy.\n\nGone Country\n\nAs a genre, country music has always been joyfully self-referential, and Alan Jackson has sung about the ins and outs of country music more than most.\n\nThis no. 1 single from 1994 takes an affectionate sideswipe at all the artists from other genres.\n\nIn this case, itâs a lounge singer, a folk-rocker, and a serious composer that end up carpetbagging over to country, when they fail to find commercial success in their own native genres.\n\nChasin' That Neon Rainbow\n\nAlan Jackson looks back on growing up, listening to country shows on the radio and hearing the songs his mother used to sing to him, as his parents tried in vain to steer him away from the possible disappointments of a career as a musician.\n\nFortunately, for the rest of us, the lure of the bright lights was too much for little Alan, and he chased that neon rainbow all the way to Nashville; becoming one of country musicâs greatest living legends."
