        "text": "This 2016 track, from Thomas Rhett’s deluxe edition of his Tangled Up album, focuses on array of traditions and signifiers of small-town life, from red dirt roads to white pickup trucks and flags waving in the wind.\n\nKey lyric: “It’s 13 stripes and 50 stars in the wind”\n\nThis 2021 song from Guyton’s Remember Her Name project acts as a unifying rally call, one that Guyton wrote with Karen Kosowski, Victoria Banks and Emma Lee.\n\nKey lyric: “We got the same stars, the same stripes/ Just wanna live that good life/ Ain’t we all, ain’t we all American?”\n\nIn this song from his 2004 album Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus, Conlee honors the families of those who are deployed, recognizing the sacrifices that mothers, fathers, children, grandparents and more make when a loved one is on military duty.\n\nKey lyric: “They don’t wear a uniform or carry a gun/ But they’re still in the war”\n\nSinger-songwriter and Texas native Anderson is known for having a few patriotic songs in his catalog, including “Mr. Red, White and Blue.” He recently released this new track just in time for 2024’s July 4th holiday. “This song is an ode to our country,” he said of “Fourth of July Song” on Instagram.\n\nKey lyric: “Let freedom ring, Old Glory will fly/ Happy Birthday, U.S.A., on the Fourth of July”\n\nDuring the course of his career, Keith earned hits with many military- and patriotic-themed hits, perhaps most notably the post-9/11 song “Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American).” But it is perhaps this song that tops Keith’s patriotic song canon, with a clear-eyed look at the daily sacrifices military members make.\n\nKey lyric: “I don’t do it for the money, there’s bills that I can’t pay/ I don’t do it for the glory, I just do it anyway”\n\nThis Brooks & Dunn release from 2001 paints a lyrical picture of a New York City school bus driver looking in the mirror at the students on board, and pondering the myriad of possibilities the future could hold for those youngsters.\n\nKey lyric: “One kid dreams of fame and fortune, one kid helps pay the rent/ One could end up going to prison, one just might be president”\n\nSung from the point of view of a fallen soldier laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery. The song was inspired by U.S. Marine Cpl. Patrick Nixon, a Tennessee soldier who died in Iraq.\n\n“I knew that was the song I had been waiting a long time to record,” Adkins told CMT in 2005. “I almost recorded ‘Letters From Home,’ and then for some reason, I was thinking, ‘It just doesn’t feel quite right.’ Of course, John Michael Montgomery had a bit hit with it — which was great. But then this song came along, and I said, ‘Oh, there it is. That’s what I’ve been waiting for.’ It’s just a nonpolitical song. It doesn’t glorify war at all or anything like that. It’s just simply playing tribute and homage and respect to the people who gave that last full measure.”\n\nKey lyric: “And I’m proud to be on this peaceful piece of property/ I’m on sacred ground and I’m in the best of company”\n\nThis 2007 release marks one of McGraw’s most impactful songs, crafted as a letter from a soldier of war to his lover in the event that he was killed in battle. McGraw co-wrote the song with The Warren Brothers’ Brad and Brett Warren.\n\nKey lyric: “So lay me down in that open field out on the edge of town and know my soul is where my momma always prayed that it would go”\n\nThe Warren Brothers’ Brad and Brett Warren are top-notch songwriters in their own right (see the McGraw track above). However, in their own 2005-released song, penned by illustrious songwriter Tom Douglas, the composition forgoes the chest-thumping, flag-waving imagery so prevalent in perhaps the majority of centering on the concerns of Americans on both sides of the political aisle, in a still-timely message of people who hope for peace and to simply see their children grow up.\n\nKey lyric: “And we pray that we dance at our daughters’ weddings/and our sons grow to fine men, and for peace on our land”\n\nIn this Cash classic, the American flag bears several of its own triumphant “medals” of survival, from a hole where Washington flew it while crossing the Delaware, or a powder burn during the night Francis Scott Key watched it while writing the lyrics to “The Star-Spangled Banner.”\n\nKey lyric: “And she’s getting threadbare and wearing thin, but she’s in good shape for the shape she’s in/’Cause she’s been through the fire before, and I believe she can take a whole lot more”\n\nThis Toby Keith song garnered both praise and controversy following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The song, which Keith also wrote as a tribute to his deceased father, was the lead single from Keith’s 2002 album Unleashed and encapsulated the anger many Americans felt in the wake of attacks.\n\nKey lyric: “When we see Old Glory flying/ There’s a lot of men dead so we can sleep in peace at night when we lay down our head”\n\nLove it or hate it, this is still the song that blasts out of radios across the nation every July 4th. Written and recorded by Greenwood, this 1984 release is filled with national pride.\n\n“I guess the inner feeling of wanting to be a patriot,” Greenwood told Billboard in 2013. “My father served in the Navy in World War II, and I had a step-father who was in the Air Force. My very first bass player in my band was a member of the Air National Guard, and we started doing USO Tours when I was about fourteen or fifteen in my home town of Sacramento at McClellan Air Force Base. We did a tour to Alaska right before I got out of high school before it was a state. I have always recognized the sacrifice of the military.” He added, “As I said on the first line of the chorus, ‘I’m proud to be an American,’ because I hadn’t heard anyone say that in a long time.”\n\nKey lyric: “I gladly stand up, next to you and defend her still today/ ‘Cause there ain’t no doubt I love this land, God bless the USA.”"
