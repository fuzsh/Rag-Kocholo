        "text": "Today Bluesfest releases the second instalment of outstanding artists to perform at the 5 Day Festival, held annually over Easter, just north of Byron Bay (EVENT DATES: Thu 24th March to Mon 28th March 2016).\n\nCo-headlining the second announcement is the incomparable Tom Jones, a living legend who will be appearing at Bluesfest for the first time in 2016.

Their career spans over more than a decade and with their songs ranging from upbeat Pop to instrumental ballads, The Decemberists have charmed audiences all over the world with their eclectic live shows.\n\nThe second announcement also includes some of the brightest stars of the next generation, with American Alternative / Classic Country & Southern Rock singer-songwriter Jason Isbell returning to Bluesfest. Jason’s album Something More Than Free went No. 1 on three (yes, that’s three!) different Billboard charts – Rock, Folk and Country. In 2014 Jason Isbell achieved a clean sweep at the Americana Awards, winning all three awards he was nominated for: Artist of the Year, Album of the Year and Song of the Year!\n\nAlso added to the Bluesfest line up is the hugely talented and rising star, Alternative Country artist Sturgill Simpson, who has been heralded as the next Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson and Johnny Cash all rolled into one.

Father and son have been performing together since 2014 and have recently released Sukierae, an album full of great depth and richness. Bluesfest, being hailed the perfect father & son event on many occasions will be the perfect fit for this father & son duo!\n\nSteve Earle, American Rock, Country and Folk singer (as well as one of America's most celebrated storytellers and activists) and his long-time backup band The Dukes will be returning to Bluesfest for two unforgettable performances. His latest release Terraplane (2015) charted higher than his trademark Copperhead Road. Terraplane peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Blues charts, No 2. on the Billboard Folk albums chart, No 3. on the Billboard Country albums chart, debuted at No 39. on the Billboard 200. Steve Earle has had a massive career spanning over many decades with multiple awards under his belt. This will be his sixth visit to Bluesfest!\n\nJamaican Reggae icons The Wailers, led by legendary bassist Aston ‘Family Man’ who has always been the The Wailers band leader, will be coming to Bluesfest for four consecutive shows and each set will be completely different from the other! Over four massive nights at Bluesfest The Wailers will be performing one of their classic albums in entirety each night including; Exodus, Survival, Uprising and Legend(the best-selling Reggae album of all time) plus the big hits like ‘No Woman, No Cry’, ‘Redemption Song’, ‘Is this Love’, and more.\n\nGrace Potter is returning to Bluesfest with her sultry vocals, commanding stage presence and this time around, along with crowd favourites including ‘Paris (Oh La La)’, ‘Stars’, & ‘The Lion, The Beast, The Beat’, will be bringing the latest from her first solo album Midnight.\n\nIn another Bluesfest debut, Lord Huron, the rising Indie Folk band from the US, is joining Bluesfest’s 2nd artist announcement. Lord Huron,which begun as a solo project by Ben Schneider, has grown into a band with a big following all over the world; their latest album Strange Tailswent to No. 10 in the Billboard top album charts and No. 1 in the Billboard Folk charts.\n\nWorld/Folk/Hip-Hop/Roots music collectiveNahko and Medicine For The People, known for their unrelentingly positive and energetic shows absolutely blew the Bluesfest crowd away in 2014 and will be sharing their spiritual, socially conscious message at Bluesfest once again next Easter.\n\nAmerican Rhythm and Blues band Vintage Trouble just finished their special guest spot for the legendary AC/DC on their Rock Or Bust World Tour. Their new album 1 Hopeful Rd. is currently No. 14 on the BBC UK Album Charts. Vintage Trouble is set to rock the socks off Bluesfest goers with their very own ‘live-wired, straight-shootin’, dirty brand of Blues Rock that has audiences all over the world wanting more.\n\nBlues man Lucky Peterson, who released his first record at five years old in 1969, discovered by Blues legend Willie Dixon, will also be making his Bluesfest debut in 2016.\n\neMDee, hailing from Australia’s top end, will be taking a short break from his season at the Sydney Royal Easter show to deliver a mind blowing performance on the didgeridoo that has to be seen to be believed.\n\nExpanding the definition of Southern Rock, Blackberry Smoke is one of America's hottest live Rock 'n' Roll outfits & a grass-roots phenomenon.

Their most recent album Holding All the Rosespeaked at No. 1 in the US Billboard Country charts.\n\nStay tuned as Bluesfest will be releasing a series of announcements in the coming weeks.\n\nTHE SECOND 2016 BLUESFEST ARTIST ANNOUNCEMENT INCLUDES:\n\nTOM JONES\n\nNOEL GALLAGHER’SHIGH FLYING BIRDS\n\nTHE DECEMBERISTS\n\nJASON ISBELL • STURGILL SIMPSON\n\nTWEEDY • STEVE EARLE & THE DUKES\n\nTHE WAILERS – Perform 4 albums in entirety; Exodus, Survival, Uprising and Legend over 4 nights!\n\nGRACE POTTER • LORD HURON\n\nNAHKO AND MEDICINE FOR THE PEOPLE\n\nVINTAGE TROUBLE • LUCKY PETERSON • EMDEE\n\nBLACKBERRY SMOKE\n\nand many more to come!\n\nBluesfest Festival Director, Peter Noble shares his excitement about the second announcement:\n\nHere it is - the second Bluesfest announcement and it's like a Royal Easter Show bag of the best music on the planet occurring today - so many goodies - chock full of surprises and with a couple of legendary favourites to top it off.\n\nFirstly we have the one and only Tom Jones, who will be Burning Down the House at the Green, Green Grass of Bluesfest. Over 100 million records sold - he truly is incomparable.\n\nWe have been speaking to Tom and his management about playing Bluesfest for many years and we are absolutely thrilled to lock him down for 2016. We present the legends at Bluesfest, Tom Jones shares the top rung of the ladder with the best we have ever presented. We are - well chuffed.\n\nNoel Gallagher, formerly of Oasis - the finest songwriter of his generation - and with Blur the most successful bands of the Brit Pop/ Indie Rock movement of the 90's, (which was even called \"Noel Rock” - Noel Gallagher being such a prevalent influence) is coming to Bluesfest. Oasis won 6 Brit Awards, and were nominated for 92 awards - winning 37 of them including Top of the Pops, NME Awards and MTV Awards to name a few.\n\nAfter tens of millions of record sales, Noel Gallagher left Oasis in 2009, and debuted the High Flying Birds in 2011. We are proud to present Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds for the first time at Bluesfest. They have headlined on festivals including Fuji Rock (Japan - twice), T in the Park (Scotland), Latitude (UK), Roskilde (Netherlands), Coachella (USA), Isle of Wight (UK), and Big Day Out on their last tour in January 2012 - plus squillions of others.\n\nI don't just love The Decemberists - I am madly in love with their music. They are amongst the best, if not THE best band to EVER come from Portland, Oregon, my former home when I lived in the US. I have been attempting to get them to play Bluesfest for many years - and finally they are coming for the first time. Their music is creative, it's quirky - maybe a little weird, like Portland itself. They may be described as Indie Folk, however I prefer to describe them as one of the most interesting bands today. If you mixed REM, The Pogues, Neko Case, The Avett Brothers and maybe Morissey and a strong British Folk Music influence, you would kinda get the idea. But, truly, this Grammy winning band is unique, fiercely independent and knows no musical boundaries. We welcome one of America's great bands to Bluesfest 2016.\n\nSturgill Simpson - the name on everyone's lips in the Alt Country/Country music movement - the winner of Best Albums, Best Songwriter, Best Performer, Best just about everything in 2015!\n\nHe just walked away with the Award for Artist of the year + Song of the year at the Americana Awards 2015.\n\nNashville is saying this guy is going to be huge - and likening him to Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson AND Johnny Cash - for his potential to re-energise Country in the classic outlaw manner. Hell, don't believe me - Google him up and you will see. Sturgill's performances at Bluesfest 2016 are a coup - you can say you saw him when.\n\nJason Isbell – since his last Bluesfest performance he has taken off! He won the Best Artist, Best Song AND Best Album at the Americana Awards 2014 and then released his career defining album so far - Something More Than Free in July 2015 - which topped the Billboard Charts at No 1 - In Country, Folk AND Rock - and No. 2 in Indie Rock - Jason Isbell's time has come.\n\nYes - there are more announcements to come and Bluesfest will continue to present THE best artists across a slew of genres - so- hold on to your hats - and get out your cheque books - we have an ABSOLUTE Bluesfest classic coming your way!\n\nARTISTS ALREADY ANNOUNCED:\n\nThe National – exclusive\n\nCity and Colour\n\nUB40 featuringAli Campbell, Astro and Mickey Virtue – exclusive\n\nJoe Bonamassa – exclusive\n\nTedeschi Trucks Band\n\nThe Cat Empire\n\nLukas Nelson & Promise of The Real\n\nThe Word • Rhiannon Giddens\n\nJaniva Magness • St. Paul & The Broken Bones\n\nAllen Stone •The Selecter\n\nShakey Graves • Songhoy Blues\n\nARTIST BIOS\n\nTom Jones\n\n‘It's Not Unusual’, ‘Delilah’ , ‘Green, Green Grass of Home’, ‘What’s New Pussycat’, ‘She's a Lady’, ‘Kiss’, ‘Mama Told Me’, ‘Thunderball’, ‘I’ll Never Fall In Love Again’, ‘If I Only Knew’, ‘Burning Down The House’ and ‘Sex Bomb’; the list goes on and on and it is an absolute honour to be presenting the man behind all those hits, Tom Jones performing at Bluesfest for the very first time in 2016.\n\nTom Jones’ 50-year career has remarkably gone from strength to strength. Along with sustaining his popularity as a live performer and recording artist for five decades, he has garnered—at the age of 75—the best reviews of his career for his two most recent albums Spirit In The Room and Praise & Blame.\n\nJones has a fundamental interest in a wide range of music. Although he is well known for hits, he is first and foremost an artist with a true Rhythm and Blues soul. He has remained a vital recording artist, with his 1999 album Reload the biggest selling (5m) of his then 35-year career and he has sold over 100 million records, an impressive feat.\n\nTom was knighted by Her Majesty the Queen in 2006, an honour he was able to celebrate once again in 2012 when he performed at the Queens Diamond Jubilee concert at Buckingham Palace. Other highlights of his long career include receiving a BRIT Award for Best Male and Outstanding Contribution to Music, a Silver Clef Award for Lifetime Achievement, the Hitmaker Award from the [US] Songwriters Hall of Fame, GQ Man Of The Year, and the prestigious [UK] Music Industry Trust Award. He has been animated as himself in The Simpsons, Duck Dodgers, The Emperors New Groove; other film roles include Tim Burton’s Mars Attacks. In 2012 he landed his first acting role not playing himself, alongside Brenda Blethyn and Alison Steadman, in “Playhouse Presents: King of The Teds” for Sky Arts.\n\nJones has been busy in 2015 including performing at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards alongside Jessie J, touring and releasing his first ever autobiography entitled Over The Top And Back and the book’s companion soundtrack entitled Long Lost Suitcase. He is also engaged in a major fund-raising effort for the BBC’s charity Children In Need.\n\nSir Tom is indeed a living legend, one of the few musical artists whose profession began at the dawn of modern popular music who continues to have a vital recording and performing career to this day. His irresistible show traverses musical eras and genres, cuts across class divides and appeals to young and old, male and female, mainstream and cutting edge. Sir Tom has always been about the power of the song, the power of the voice.\n\nWe welcome the iconic Sir Tom Jones to Bluesfest.\n\n<image008.jpg>\n\n“The finest songwriter of his generation” – George Martin\n\nIn another first for Bluesfest, we excitedly welcome one of the most talented songwriters in modern Rock, Noel Gallagher & his High Flying Birds, for the first time!\n\nThe principle songwriter, lead guitarist & vocalist for megaband Oasis, Noel Gallagher is responsible for one of the biggest selling albums of all time with Wonderwall. Regarded as the spearhead of the Britpop movement, Oasis, known for hit making genius that nods to The Beatles, sold over 85 million albums, all 7 studio albums reached No. 1 in the UK, are multi-platinum & produced 23 Top 10 singles. The ubiquitous‘Wonderwall’ was named the No. 1 song in Triple J’s recent birthday Top 100 countdown.\n\nNoels’ personal influence on the Brit/Indie Rock world is so great, the term ‘Noel Rock’ was even coined to describe the music of artists who were influenced by him such as Kula Shaker & Cast.\n\nNow with his own band he released two smash albums in the 2011 multi-platinum self-titled album featuring opus’ like ‘Everybody’s on the Run’, ‘If I Had a Gun’, ‘Dream On’ & ‘AKA…What a Life!’, and Chasing Yesterday, with follow up hits ‘Riverman’ & ‘The Heat of Moment’ has reached Gold inside of 6 months of release. Both albums went No. 1 in the UK & Ireland, & reached the Top 10 in at least 5 other countries.\n\nHis solo sound, and the new album extends far beyond what people expect from Noel & his eponymous Oasis sound; it experiments with horns, Psychedelia and even Space Jazz. Yes, Space Jazz.\n\nIn four short years together the project has racked up an impressive 12 award nominations including a Brit award, and won an NME award and two Q Awards, and catapulted a 15-month tour in arena-sized shows quicker than both Noel and his audiences expected.\n\nBluesfest is in for a treat and a great time, experience this history-making musician live for the first time ever at Bluesfest.\n\nThe Decemberists\n\nPortland’s finest, The Decemberists, will be making their very first Bluesfest appearance next Easter.\n\nSince their earliest recordings more than a decade ago, The Decemberists have been known for their sense of scope and daring. Drawing on influences such as REM, The Shins and Death Cab for Cutie, they sway through upbeat Pop to lush ballads to sea shanties, and employ a plethora of instruments including accordion, organ, and upright bass to orchestrate exciting, theatrical performances that have charmed audiences the world over.\n\nAfter the success of the 2011 Number 1 album The King is Dead, which included the Grammy nominated song ‘Down By the Water’, they took a break to spend time with families, and now much to fans’ delight, The Decemberists are back with their seventh album What a Terrible World, What a Beautiful World (2015) and a collection of B-sides from the recording sessions– a 5-song EP titled Florasongs to be released on October 9.\n\nWhat a Terrible World, What a Beautiful World has been heralded as the band’s most varied and dynamic work, both musically and emotionally, they took their time to make it & experimented with texture, vocals, strings and more to shape the tenor, whilst drawing from profound pieces of inspiration including President Obama’s national address following the Newtown School shootings, from which the album title came.\n\nAs well as selling out tours across the globe, the Grammy-nominated collective from Portland have featured on the Hunger Gamessoundtrack, appeared on Conan, & Jimmy Kimmel Live, and they even had the honour of legendary TV show creator Matt Groening selecting them to feature in animated form on The Simpsons, and performed on the season six finale of Parks and Recreation.\n\nJason Isbell\n\nJason Isbell made his Bluesfest debut in 2014 and was such a crowd favourite, it was only a matter of time until he would return. Hailing from Alabama, Jason Isbell has changed the face of Country music with his beautifully crafted and emotive music.\n\nThe former member of the Drive-By Truckers released his fifth studio album Something More Than Free in July 2015 which went to #1 on three Billboard charts including, Country Albums, Folk Albums and Rock Albums, and debuted at #6 on the Billboard 200.\n\nAfter the success of his previous and breakthrough album Southeastern, Jason Isbell has stretched himself even further with Something More Than Free, greatly expanding the boundaries of Isbell country, that territory of the heart and mind where people strive against their imperfections, and simultaneously against their circumstances.\n\nSturgill Simpson Bluesfest is honoured to present one of the biggest names in Country music right now: Sturgill Simpson.\n\nFrom winning Emerging Artist of the Year at the 2014 Americana Music Awards to conquering the same awards ceremony this year, winningSong of the Year for ‘Turtles All the Way Down’ and Artist of the Year, Sturgill Simpson is fast becoming the most exciting, talked about artist in Country music in years.\n\nFrom working in the armed forces to the railroads, to the South Carolina shrimp boats to now performing every major event from Bonnaroo to Willie Nelson’s Fourth of July Picnic, international TV appearances & sold out headlining performances, Simpson’s music career is exploding. His current tour of the US has been so popular he was compelled to increase the original schedule by double to meet the demand from fervent audiences all over the country.\n\nNot to mention a list of accolades that never seem to end – His highly acclaimed second album Metamodern Sounds in Country Music (2014) was nominated for a Grammy in 2015 for Americana Album of the year. Topping just about every major music outlet’s hit list of 2014, the ground-breaking album came #18 in Rolling Stone Magazine’s 50 Best Albums of 2014, #1 in American Songwriters Top 50 Albums of 2014, # 2 in Best Country Albums of 2014 & ‘Turtles All the Way Down’ #4 in the Best Country Songs of 2014. He also claimed #1 Album, #1 Male Vocalist, #1 Songwriter, #2 Artist & #6 single in the 2014 Nashville Scene Country Music Critics Poll.\n\nHailing from Eastern Kentucky, Sturgill is consistently referred to as the 'real deal' - the second coming of the true outlaws of Country music Johnny Cash & Waylon Jennings. His music pushes the boundaries of classic Country to various genres, containing elements of Roots, Psychedelia and Soul and has even been described as “Country music for people who don’t like Country”.\n\nHis ability to sound concurrently both nostalgic and contemporary Country, largely owing to his song writing brilliance, has earned him respect from heavyweights of Country including legend Merle Haggard, who was quoted saying Simpson is “the only player in modern Country music who makes the cut”.\n\nLovers of music rejoice! Making his Bluesfest debut in 2016, Sturgill Simpson’s star is on the rise and fast becoming renowned as one of the most important Country musicians today – make sure you get in and be one to say ‘I saw him when’!\n\nTweedy\n\nWilco’s incomparable front-man, Jeff Tweedy is coming to Byron Bay for another special performance – different to how Bluesfest audiences have seen him before.\n\nTweedy is a musical collaboration with his 18-year-old son, drummer Spencer Tweedy. The father/son duo’s 2014 debut album is calledSukierae and features 20 songs written by Jeff Tweedy, with Spencer on drums, and Jeff on guitars, vocals, bass & keyboards.\n\nAs the founding member and leader of the American alternative Country Rock band Wilco and before that the co-founder of the Alt-Country band Uncle Tupelo, Jeff Tweedy is one of contemporary American music’s most accomplished songwriters, musicians and performers.\n\nSince starting Wilco in 1994 Tweedy has written original songs for nine Wilco albums, played more than 1,500 concerts world-wide, become a highly sought-after producer, collaborated with legends including Mavis Staples & Billy Bragg to critical acclaim, & won two Grammy Awards for his work with Wilco. The Tweedy-produced Mavis Staples album You Are Not Alone won Best Americana Album at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards.\n\nWilco has influenced artists including The National, Grace Potter, Norah Jones & Counting Crows to name but a few. Despite covering the big questions in life in his song-writing, the Tweedy live show is determinedly upbeat. Covering a catalogue of over 20 years of stand-out material as well as brand new material from the Tweedy project, this will be one sweet show to see at Bluesfest 2016!\n\nSteve Earle & The Dukes\n\nSinger-songwriter, actor, author, political activist, producer – Steve Earle is one of America's greatest living storytellers. His stories, captured in songs such as ‘The Galway Girl’, ‘Hard-Core Troubadour’, ‘Jerusalem’, ‘Goodbye’s All We Got Left’ , ‘Guitar Town’, and his anthemic‘Copperhead Road’, have filled 16 studio albums and earned him three Grammy awards.\n\nA protégé of legendary songwriters Townes Van Zandt and Guy Clark, Earle quickly became a master storyteller in his own right, with his songs being recorded by Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Emmylou Harris, Waylon Jennings, Travis Tritt, The Pretenders, Joan Baez and countless others. 1986 saw the release of his debut record, Guitar Town, which shot to number one on the country charts and immediately established the term “New Country”.\n\nWhat followed was an extremely exciting and varied array of releases including the biting hard Rock of Copperhead Road (1988), the minimalist beauty of Train A Comin’ (1995), the politically charged masterpiece, Jerusalem (2002) and the Grammy Award Winning albums The Revolution Starts…Now (2004), Washington Square Serenade (2007) and Townes (2009).\n\nMost recently Steve Earle has released I’ll Never Get Out Of This World Alive (2011) which shares the same name with his 2011 debut novel ,The Low Highway (2013) and his latest release Terraplane (2015) peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Blues charts , No 2. on the Billboard Folk albums chart, No 3. on the Billboard Country albums chart, debuted at No 39. on the Billboard 200, and named “Americana Album of the Month” by Uncut Magazine, along with glowing reviews from Rolling Stone & Vintage Guitar Magazines.\n\nSteve Earle has a close affinity with Bluesfest, and has even called it ‘The Best Festival in the World’ it is a pleasure to see him return to the stage with his long time back-up band The Dukes.\n\nThe Wailers - Perform 4 albums in entirety; Exodus, Survival, Uprising and Legend over 4 nights!\n\nBluesfest is thrilled to present one of the most significant bands touring the world today: The Wailers. Their prodigious mission, led by legendary Aston “Family Man” Barrett, is to uphold the legacy of Reggae prophet Bob Marley.\n\nOver four massive consecutive nights at Bluesfest The Wailers will be performing one of their classic albums including Exodus, Survival, Uprising and Legend (the best-selling Reggae album of all time) in entirety plus the big hits like ‘No Woman, No Cry’, ‘Redemption Song’, ‘Is this Love’, and more.\n\nJust some of the hits from each album include, Exodus: ‘Jammin’, ‘One Love’, ‘Three Little Birds’ , Survival: ’Zimbabwe’, ‘So Much Trouble in the World’ , Uprising: ‘Coming in from the Cold’, ‘Could you be Loved’ , Legend ‘Buffalo Soldier’, ‘Get Up, Stand Up’, ‘I Shot the Sheriff’.\n\nTogether with Bob Marley, the Wailers sold in excess of 250 million albums worldwide, notching up over 20 chart hits, including 7 Top 10 entries. As the greatest living exponents of Jamaica’s reggae tradition, the Wailers have performed for an estimated 24 million people worldwide & performed with other greats such as Sting, Stevie Wonder, Carlos Santana, Peter Tosh & Jason Mraz.\n\nThis is the line-up that pioneered Roots Rock Reggae. Under Family Man’s musical leadership, they partnered with Bob Marley on the succession of hit singles and albums that made him a global icon, winner of several Lifetime Achievement awards, and Jamaica’s best-loved musical superstar. Family Man Barrett was Bob Marley’s right-hand man, co-writer, band leader, and responsible for finishing and releasing Marley’s posthumous release ‘Confrontation’.\n\nFor millions of people the heartbeat of Reggae remains the songs of Bob Marley and the Wailers. The anchor of the band is Aston “Family Man” Barrett, who in addition to being Marley’s most trusted lieutenant, played on countless other classic Reggae hits throughout the seventies.
