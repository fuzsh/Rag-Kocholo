        "text": "Actor | Singer Born Thomas Jones Woodward on June 7, 1940 in Pontypridd, Wales, United Kingdom\n\nThe hit 1965 single âItâs Not Unusualâ put Welsh singer Tom Jones on the musical map, turning him into an international sensation known as much for his sexual charisma as for his vocalizing.\n\nFrom the mid-1960s through the early-â70s, Jones enjoyed such other memorable chart busters as âWhatâs New Pussycat?,â âDelilah,â âDaughter of Darknessâ and âSheâs a Lady.â He also sang the title theme for the James Bond movie âThunderball.â\n\nDuring this era, Jones performed live in Las Vegas and in New York, where screaming women would routinely hurl their underwear and hotel room keys at the curly-haired sex symbol while he sang. He starred in several popular TV variety series and appeared on many TV specials around this time as well.\n\nThe singer has reinvented himself over the years, finding major success on the country music charts, all while continuing to tour, record and appear on TV and in the occasional acting gig.\n\nIn 1999, Jones released âReload,â his biggest-selling album ever, mainly composed of cover duets sung with such eclectic talents as the Pretenders, Barenaked Ladies and Van Morrison.\n\nThe singer, who was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2006, has been married to his wife, Melinda, since 1957 (they were both 16 at the time). They have one son, Mark."
