        "text": "Two years ago, Tom Jones was a spectator at the Stagecoach Country Music Festival, watching Jerry Lee Lewis play a blistering set in the Palomino Tent. On Sunday night, the 78-year-old Welsh singer reminisced about that night as he performed the set of the festival in the same spot, putting on an hour-plus show that was perfectly tailored to the Stagecoach audience, full of deep blues, gospel nods and his biggest hits.\n\nJones’ set will go down in the annals of Stagecoach history as even better than Lewis’.\n\nDuring the evening performance, which was steamy in the humid air that clung to the Empire Polo Club in Indio for the final day of the festival, Jones noted that some people questioned his country cred.\n\n“I’m not from the city, I can tell you that,” he said.\n\nJones’ set was the best music history lesson Stagecoach could offer, with some Delta blues, cajun zydeco, modern funk, and plenty of showmanship. It was also a master class in vocals as Jones sounded better than any other person behind a microphone at the festival this weekend.\n\nWhile Jones is known for his Las Vegas residencies over the decades, a lounge act this was not. With a crunchy bluesy guitar riff and drums, the latter played by Jones’ musical director Gary Wallis, the icon opened his set with “Burning Hell,” a John Lee Hooker tune that Jones recorded for his 2010 album “Praise & Blame.”\n\nThroughout the night, Jones dropped tidbits of stories about famous friends, like how he and Elvis Presley would get together in Las Vegas and sing gospel numbers for fun before going into “God’s Gonna Cut You Down,” or throw it back with some R&B and rock ‘n’ roll history when he did Little Willie John’s “Take My Love.” Little Willie John is from “Detroit City,” Jones told us.\n\nAmong the other standouts in his excellently curated set were his own huge hits, starting with “Delilah,” which got some zydeco flavor with a cajun rhythm and the addition of an accordion. It was a great twist on the Cole Porter classic about about murdering a cheating lover.\n\nThe accordion stuck around for “It’s Not Unusual,” too, on which Jones nailed the vocals.\n\nOther highlights included “Soul of a Man,” “Sex Bomb” and “You Can Leave Your Hat On.”\n\nPart of the secret of Jones’ success was his incredibly tight band, which included a horn section complete with a sousaphone player. It gave a depth and life to the performance that so many others lack in the age of backing tracks. By the time he got to “I Wish You Would” to wrap the main set, the band was rambling on a groove reminiscent of the Allman Brothers.\n\nJones came back with his funky version of Prince’s already funky “Kiss,” before leaving us with one final story. Apparently, Jones and Little Richard are friends and talk on the phone sometimes. Jones told the “Tutti Frutti” singer about his son and grown grandkids and Little Richard suggested they form the Tom Jones Gospel Quartet, but they had to do one song. It was “Strange Things” and that’s how Jones ended the night before having his whole band come out for a bow and thanking the audience.\n\nNext year, how about we see Jones at Coachella?"
