However, it was not until twelve years later in the same month that country music track \"Say You'll Stay Until Tomorrow\" secured the singer his first U.S. number 1, according to Billboard.\n\nWith his iconic rhythm and blues sound, Jones won best new artist Grammy in 1966.\n\nThe singer had his biggest-selling album of his 35-year career in 1999 with \"Reload\", according to his official site, a collection of fifteen duets with various music artists from different musical genres.\n\nIt included \"Mama Told Me Not To Come\" with Welsh rock band Stereophonics, \"Are You Going My Way\" with former Take That's Robbie Williams, as well as dance track \"Sex Bomb\" featuring German DJ Mousse T. that was a number one hit in Europe.\n\nAs an actor, Jones was nominated in 1970 for best TV actor in a comedy or musical at the Golden Globe awards for music documentary \"This Is Tom Jones\", but missed out to the late Peter O'Toole.\n\nThe actor has also played himself, including in U.S. television cartoon series \"The Simpsons\" in 1992, as well as in Tim Burton's 1996 sci-fi comedy \"Mars Attacks!\" opposite Annette Bening.\n\nAside from 2016, since 2012 Jones has been a coach and mentor on British TV talent show \"The Voice\", along with \"Black Eyed Peas\" founding member, American singer-songwriter and producer will.i.am.\n\nThe Welsh singer has performed for British royalty numerous times over the years. However, in 1969 the then 29 year-old's performance at the annual Royal Variety Performance show was met with criticism by the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Philip who described his singing as \"hideous\" at a lunch held by the Small Businessmen's Association, according to Reuters Archive, and questioned what Jones earned a year. Jones' response was that was not \"very nice\", and added that he contributed a lot to charity at a press conference.\n\nIn 2006, Sir Tom Jones was knighted by Britain's Queen Elizabeth II for his services to music. In 2012 he performed at the Queen's Diamond Jubilee concert at Buckingham Palace in London.\n\nOther accolades the octogenarian has scooped over the years include the 1970 Ivor Novello award for international artist of the year, the 1989 MTV Video Music award for breakthrough video for \"Kiss\", BRIT awards for best British male (2000) and outstanding contribution to music (2003), a Silver Clef award in 2001 and the Silver Clef award for lifetime achievement in 2014, the Hitmaker award from the U.S. Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2009, the UK's prestigious Music Industry Trust award for his musical career in 2010, the 2017 Bambi award for 'legend' status, and GQ magazine's man of the year in 2019.\n\n(Production: Lisa Giles-Keddie)\n\nCopyright Holder: FILE REUTERS (CAN SELL)\n\nCopyright Notice: (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2020.
