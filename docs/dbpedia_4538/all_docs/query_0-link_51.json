        "text": "Virgin Radio\n\n17 Nov 2023, 12:14\n\nCredit: Rex/Getty\n\nDolly Parton, in a recent interview, shared some of her 'rock and roll' moments, including a particularly daring episode involving Welsh singer Tom Jones.\n\nThe iconic country singer, set to release her latest album, Rockstar, recounted a spirited night out with friends in Los Angeles.\n\nIn the interview with Metro, Dolly Parton reflected on the concept of 'rock and roll,' clarifying that while she hadn't engaged in the stereotypical rockstar antics like trashing hotel rooms, she did have her share of fun. One standout moment was when Tom Jones was at the height of his popularity, and Parton and her friends, after a few margaritas at a Mexican restaurant, decided to add some spontaneity to their night.\n\nThe group, having been rained out of a movie shoot, decided to have some fun. With Tom Jones' house on the pathway to their hotel, they dared Parton to streak through his yard.\n\nIn her own words, she revealed: \"Well, I don’t know what you really call ‘rock and roll’. I’ve done a few fun things. I’ve never really trashed my hotel room or thrown TVs out of the window or anything. Probably the most radical thing I ever did was when Tom Jones was really hot. Me and a bunch of girls had gone out to have a few margaritas at a Mexican restaurant. We got rained out of a shoot we were doing for a movie, so we spent the afternoon having fun. We all liked him. Tom Jones and his house in Los Angeles was on the pathway to the hotel where we were staying, so they dared me to streak through his yard. So I streaked through Tom’s yard. He didn’t see me but I did it. That was kind of rock and roll.\"\n\nThis anecdote adds a playful and adventurous touch to Parton's image, showcasing her willingness to embrace fun and spontaneous moments. It also sheds light on the camaraderie and carefree spirit she shares with her friends.\n\nIn the interview, Parton also reminisced about discovering the Beatles and her admiration for their music. She recalled the moment she first heard I Want To Hold Your Hand, describing it as 'the greatest thing' she'd ever heard. Expressing her lifelong admiration for the Beatles, she highlighted the incredible experience of singing on a record with Paul McCartney, with both Paul and Ringo Starr playing on it.\n\nParton's upcoming album, Rockstar, promises a star-studded lineup, featuring renowned names such as Stevie Nicks, Joan Jett, Debbie Harry, Linda Perry, Sheryl Crow, and Emmylou Harris. The album's diverse collaborations reflect the enduring influence and cross-genre appeal of Dolly Parton in the music industry."
