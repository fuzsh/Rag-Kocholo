        "text": "cloudguitar said:\n\nKind of interesting - Tom Jones talks about meeting Prince in his autobiography:\n\n</p>\n\nSoon after ‘Kiss’ was a hit, I went to a party at Tramp, the club in Jermyn Street in London, and at the bottom of the stairs I ran into Prince. He was dressed like some kind of eighteenth-century fop – braided coat, teetering heels, huge frilled sleeves, silk handkerchief waving. I may have imagined the handkerchief.</br>\n\nHe replied, ‘Thanks for recording it’ – surprising me with his voice, which was by no means falsetto. It turns out the guy has a fathoms-deep speaking voice.\n\n</p>\n\nAnd then I excused myself and walked on into the party as rapidly as I possibly could – not having anything at all against the thought of hanging out with Prince, but having in my mind a scene which has always haunted me from that Bette Midler movie, The Rose. It’s the bit where Midler, playing Mary Rose Foster, a big rock star, takes a helicopter out to Long Island to see Billy Ray, played by Harry Dean Stanton, a humble country singer and songwriter, one of whose songs Mary Rose Foster has recorded. And Mary Rose Foster is clearly desperate to know what Billy Ray thought of her version of the song and yearning to discover that he liked it because to find out that he didn’t approve of it would be crushing to her. But Billy Ray isn’t saying anything until Mary Rose is on her way out the door, when he finally says: ‘Before you go: don’t you ever record one of my songs again.’ Utter humiliation for Mary Rose.\n\n</p>\n\nAnd that’s why I moved quickly past Prince at the bottom of the stairs in Tramp that night. It would have devastated me to hear that he didn’t like my version of ‘Kiss’. The best approach in the circumstances seemed to be: right-turn and into the room. Don’t give him the option.\n\n</p>\n\nthere's more on the link below - he talks a bit about covering Kiss - I found it interesting, he says that he thinks Kiss is basically an old school blues song (which I agree with) - not always sure how I feel about Tom Jones, but he seems quite humble here...\n\n</p>\n\nhttp://blog.whsmith.co.uk/read-extract-top-back-tom-jones/"
