        "text": "At 83 years of age, Tom Jones is a force to behold. He’s still recording new music and touring regularly and doesn’t look like slowing down anytime soon. With a career spanning seven decades, there isn’t much the Welsh legend hasn’t achieved, with countless chart hits, two BRIT Awards to his name and a list of collaborations with the likes of Stevie Wonder, Joni Mitchell and Van Morrison that would make any musician jealous.\n\nHaving recently toured Australia in 2024, playing Bluesfest and several solo shows, Jones wowed audiences across the country with his incredible voice. In celebration of the great man’s career, here’s a look at some of the best Tom Jones songs that define the singer’s illustrious career.\n\n‘It’s Not Unusual’ (1965)\n\nNobody knew who the hell Tom Jones was when he released the single 'It's Not Unusual' in 1965. Just Jones' second single, the song was a monster hit, hitting the top of the UK Singles Charts.\n\nOriginally intended for Sandie Shaw, after she heard Jones’ rendition of the song, she was suitably impressed and told him to release the song himself.\n\nThe song changed Jones’ life, turning him from a nobody to a somebody overnight and kick-starting his music career. Jones is indebted to Shaw, as he told Smooth Radio in an interview:\n\n“I did the demo on this song when it was being offered to Sandie Shaw. I was just starting out and, God bless her, she said: 'Whoever's singing this, it's his song...’ I'm indebted to Sandie for being so generous.\"\n\nThe song remains a favourite among Jones fans today and is a karaoke mainstay.\n\n‘What’s News Pussycat’ (1965)\n\nWritten by Burt Bacharach and Hal David for the film of the same name, ‘What’s New Pussycat?’ was another charting hit for Jones, although it took some convincing for the Welsh legend to record the tune.\n\n\"When I first heard it I thought, 'Christ! What the bloody hell do they want me to sing this for?'“ Jones said when interviewed for the program What It Was Like To Work with Burt Bacharach, in the Words of his Collaborators. “But Burt Bacharach explained, 'I want the big voice to sing this bloody crazy song.' And you put it on, it’s a classic.”\n\nReleasing the song was a smart move, with ‘What’s New Pussycat?’ becoming Jones’ third UK top 30 record, peaking at #11, while reaching #3 on the American charts.\n\n‘Thunderball’ (1965)\n\n‘Thunderball’ doesn’t get the credit it deserves. It’s arguably one of the most underrated Bond themes and is an incredible showcase of Tom Jones’ vocal talents.\n\nJohnny Cash originally wrote a song for the Bond flick Thunderball, but that was rejected and Jones was brought in to sing a new track written by composer John Barry and lyricist Don Black.\n\nThe result is a powerful theme tune that has all the grandiose appeal of a Bond song. Jones put so much into the song that he almost passed out while hitting the final note.\n\n“I closed my eyes and I held the note for so long when I opened my eyes the room was spinning,” he recalled, as reported by Far Out Magazine.\n\n‘Green Green Grass of Home’ (1966)\n\nFirst recorded by singer Johnny Darrell before country singer Porter Wagoner made in famous in 1965, 'Green, Green Grass of Home' really hit with audiences when Tom Jones recorded a version of it the following year.\n\nDespite the depressing subject matter – a man on death row dreaming about returning home – the song was another #1 hit for Jones, hitting the top of the charts on December 1 and staying there for seven weeks.\n\n‘Delilah’ (1968)\n\nThe second song about death that proved succsful for Tom Jones, 'Delilah' features a brass arrangemnet and lyrics about Jones killing his partner after catching her in bed with another man.\n\nIt’s a bombastic tune that’s slightly over the top, with Jones’ voice soaring over the instrumentation. The chorus is catchy as hell and one you can’t help but sing along with.\n\n‘Delilah’ wasn’t without controversy, with the producers of The Ed Sullivan Show trying to make Jones change a certain lyric when performing live on the show. He refused and sang the original lyrics, calling it “such bullshit” in his autobiography Over the Top and Out.\n\n‘She’s a Lady’ (1971)\n\nTom Jones experienced a bit of a chart drought during the '80s until the single 'A Boy from Nowhere' saw him reaach #2 on the UK Single Charts, his first top five hit since 1971.\n\nWhile a tremendous song, it was Jones’ collaboration with Art of Noise that saw him become relevant in the world of pop music again.\n\nThe electronic act and Jones covered Prince’s ‘Kiss’ after Art of Noise saw him perform the song in Vegas on television. It became a top ten hit in several countries and peaked at #18 on the US Dance Charts.\n\nThe song not only helped Art of Noise grow their profile, but it re-energised Jones’ career.\n\n‘If I Only Knew’ (1994)\n\nA personal favourite from Jones’ underrated The Lead and How to Swing It album, ‘If I Only Knew is a boisterous ‘90s pop tune from Jones’ dyed black hair ear.\n\nA funky number that peaked at #4 on the US Dance Club Songs Chart, the song includes a mid-song rap. It sounds like a disaster but it somehow works, with Jones groovily spitting “Up north where the snow grows colder / I travel onward 'cross the border / Looked up a girl that I once knew frozen / I found that I was chosen to be the follower of the deity”.\n\nThe song also includes a classic Jones scream, with the singer sounding like he’s having an absolute blast.\n\n‘Burning Down the House’ (1999)\n\nTom Jones reinvented himself with Reload, an album featuring the Welsh god dueting with a range of new and old artists, including Van Morrison, Robbie Williams, Portishead and more.\n\nOne of the first tracks taken from the album was ‘Burning Down the House’, a cover of the Talking Heads hit with Swedish act the Cardigans.\n\nThe cover was a big hit in Europe and Australia and opened Jones up to a brand new era of fans who had never heard of him.\n\n‘Sexbomb’ (2000)\n\nRiding high from the success of Reload, Jones teamed up with dance music producer Chicane for the anthemic ‘Stoned In Love’. The song finds Jones singing in a lighter register when he first appears during the first chorus before he unleashes during the backend of the track.\n\nAnother UK Singles Chart top ten hit (the song made it to #7), ‘Stoned In Love’ was the last big crossover hit Jones had before entering his blues and gospel era."
