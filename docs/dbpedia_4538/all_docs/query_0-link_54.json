        "text": "Sexbomb (with Mousse T)\n\nTom Jones, Mousse T. - Sexbomb (Official Video)\n\nFor Tom's hugely successful comeback album Reload, he teamed up with dance act Mousse T for this party anthem.\n\nContaining a sample from 'All American Girls' by Sister Sledge, it gave him a number three hit in 1999.\n\nRead more: Photos of Tom Jones through the years at 80: “The women, the sex… I don’t regret anything”\n\nThunderball\n\nThunderball Theme Song - James Bond\n\nRead more: All the James Bond themes, ranked from worst to best\n\n'Thunderball' became the lead song for the 1965 Bond film of the same name.\n\nTom Jones apparently fainted in the recording booth after singing the song's final, high note. He once said: \"I closed my eyes and I held the note for so long when I opened my eyes the room was spinning.\"\n\nBurning Down the House (with The Cardigans)\n\nTom Jones, The Cardigans - Burning Down The House (Official Video)\n\nFor his Reload collaborations album, Sir Tom Jones scored a big top 10 hit with this Talking Heads cover.\n\nSir Tom teamed up with Swedish band the Cardigans on the track, giving them both one of their biggest ever hits in 1999.\n\nWhat's New Pussycat?\n\nTom Jones - What's new pussycat\n\nReleased in 1965, 'What’s New Pussycat' was written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David for the movie of the same name.\n\nIt has since been performed by everyone from The Four Seasons to Tony Bennett.\n\nMama Told Me Not To Come (with Stereophonics)\n\nTom Jones, Stereophonics - Mama Told Me Not To Come\n\nWritten by Randy Newman for Eric Burdon's solo album and later a hit for Three Dog Night, Sir Tom Jones covered this rock anthem with Stereophonics, who at the time were one of the biggest bands in 1999.\n\nSee more: What is Sir Tom Jones’ real name? The Voice UK judge makes surprising revelation\n\nSharing vocals with fellow Welsh star Kelly Jones, this gave Sir Tom yet another top 10 hit from his Reload album.\n\nI (Who Have Nothing)\n\nTom Jones - I Who Have Nothing - This is Tom Jones TV Show 1970\n\nThis is an English language cover of the Italian song 'Uno dei Tanti', first recorded in English by Ben E King in 1963 with new lyrics by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller.\n\nAlso a big hit for Tom's fellow Welsh icon Shirley Bassey, Sir Tom scored a big hit in both the UK and US in 1970.\n\nIf He Should Ever Leave You\n\nIf He Should Ever Leave You\n\nSir Tom recorded this underrated pop gem for his 2008 album 24 Hours, his first album of mainly original material in years.\n\nYou Can Leave Your Hat On\n\nTom Jones performs 'You Can Leave Your Hat On' | The Voice UK 2017\n\nOriginally by Randy Newman in 1972 and later made famous by Joe Cocker, Sir Tom covered this naughty stripping anthem for the Full Monty soundtrack in 1997.\n\nIt famously played during the film's climax, and helped cement Sir Tom's impressive comeback of the late '90s.\n\nHelp Yourself\n\nTom Jones - Help Yourself\n\nThis catchy classic was a reworked English-language version of the Italian song 'Gli Occhi Miei' ('My Eyes').\n\nSir Tom's version gave him another top 10 hit in the UK, and it became one of his signature songs.\n\nKiss (with the Art of Noise)\n\nTom Jones and Art Of Noise - Kiss (Official Video)\n\nIn 1988, English group The Art of Noise released a cover of Prince’s ‘Kiss’, featuring Tom Jones on vocals.\n\nThe song reached number five on the UK Singles Chart – higher than the original, and gave Tom a deserved comeback. He also recorded a version of the song for his 2003 Reloaded: Greatest Hits album.\n\nShe's a Lady\n\nTom Jones - She's a Lady\n\nPaul Anka wrote this song for Tom in 1971, and it became his biggest hit in the States, reaching number two.\n\nAnka rewrote the first verse of the song (recorded with Tom) for his 2013 Duets album, because he disliked its chauvinistic lines.\n\nI'll Never Fall in Love Again\n\nTOM JONES - I'll Never Fall In Love Again (1967)\n\nOn first release in 1967, Tom's recording reached number two in the UK Chart but was less successful in the States, where it only peaked at number 49.\n\nNot to be confused with the Burt Bacharach/Hal David song of the same name, this was originally by Lonnie Donegan in 1962.\n\nThe Green Green Grass of Home\n\nGreen Green Grass Of Home - Tom Jones\n\nOriginally made popular by Dolly Parton's longtime musical partner Porter Wagoner in 1965, it was recorded by Sir Tom in 1966, when it became a worldwide number one hit.\n\nThe death-row ballad was also the rather un-festive Christmas number one that year.\n\nIt's Not Unusual\n\nTom Jones \"It's Not Unusual\" on The Ed Sullivan Show\n\nIt’s Not Unusual was first recorded by a then-unknown Tom Jones, after having first been offered to Sandie Shaw.\n\nTom recorded what was intended to be a demo for Sandie, but when she heard it she was so impressed with Jones' delivery that she declined the song and recommended that Jones release it himself.\n\nSee more: The Voice UK: Tom Jones gives standing ovation after duo's jaw-dropping cover of Celine Dion's 'Think Twice'\n\nWhen we spoke to Tom about it, he said: “I did the demo on this song when it was being offered to Sandie Shaw. I was just starting out and, God bless her, she said: 'Whoever's singing this, it's his song... I'm indebted to Sandie for being so generous.\"\n\nIt reached number one in the UK chart in 1965 and has since become one of Tom's signature songs. And we can't help but dance the 'Carlton' from The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air every single time."
