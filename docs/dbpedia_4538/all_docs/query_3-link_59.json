        "text": "What a gig!! Tom Jones is an icon. A legend. Whether you like his music or not. When Sir Tom sang, I'm sure our hair went backwards!,like in a wind tunnel!.. Some classics sung and some covers thrown in.\n\nThe worst part for me was some drunk women in the crowd nearby who fell about blind drunk, crashing into other people and tried to be louder than Tom even though the PA!\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nAt 79 Jones voice has not aged! Sounding young and strong! His prescence still sensual and provacative! I was a little dissappointed he didnt sing all his classics! But he loves blues and I understand his preference Regardless he was amazing! His band was an excellent accompaniment to his style and choice! Brilliant!\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nThe show in Atlanta was fantastic! Tom Jones was incredible!! His voice is golden...legendary!!! He can sing any genre and it magically works. My mother introduced me to his blusey Welsh voice at about the age of 5 and for 50 wonderful years I have loved and will always love him!! Thanks mom and thank you Sir Tom for sharing you beautiful Gift of Song with me!\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate"
