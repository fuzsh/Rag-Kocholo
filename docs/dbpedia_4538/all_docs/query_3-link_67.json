        "text": "Tyler Childers's Appalachian roots are at the forefront of his twangy, traditionalist sound, exemplified on records like \"All Your'n\" and \"Bottles and Bibles.\" The Kentucky native is a perfect fit for folks who love sad old country songs, especially fan favorites like \"Follow You To Virgie\" and \"Shake The Frost.\"\n\nThis deep-voiced Texan keeps the tradition of outlaw country alive, with stellar songwriting and compelling lyricism. Jinks got his start playing in metal bands as a teenager, and that heavier influence is occasionally apparent in tunes like \"Cast No Stones.\"\n\nA Kentucky native, Carly Pearce got her start as a performer at Dollywood before moving to Nashville to pursue a career as a country artist. With strong powerhouse vocals and a background in bluegrass, she's a solid pick for anyone who loves a good ballad. Consider downloading \"29,\" her most recent album, for a glimpse into what makes her music so compelling.\n\nEven though he's not exactly a traditionalist — and has a penchant for infusing his songs with strange lyrical and sonic elements — Sturgill Simpson is a must-listen for anyone who likes classic country music. His 2014 breakout album \"Metamodern Sounds in Country Music\" is experimental, while \"The Ballad of Dood and Juanita\" is a compelling song cycle set in the 1800s.\n\nWith her distinct vocals and honky-tonk sensibilities, Margo Price has earned the stamp of approval from country legends like Willie Nelson. Download her 2020 album \"That's How Rumors Get Started\" for tracks that blend rock and country and soul or stick with \"Midwest Farmer's Daughter\" for something more explicitly country.\n\nOne hell of a singer — and a storyteller — Ashley McBryde brings a powerful stage presence and belt-worthy ballads to country music. Stream \"One Night Standards\" for a perfect love song, or \"A Little Dive Bar in Dahlonega\" for one of those story songs that makes country music so special.\n\nAn independent artist through and through, Aaron Watson has blazed his own trail from Texas to Nashville. Counting George Jones, Merle Haggard, and Willie Nelson as influences, Watson's sound is influenced with a heavy pinch of Texas twang.\n\nFans of Waylon Jennings and Johnny Cash will appreciate the thundering baritone of Colter Wall, a Canadian singer-songwriter with a seriously powerful talent. Download his 2020 album \"Western Swing & Waltzes and Other Punchy Songs\" for a seriously enjoyable hat-tip to country music's past.\n\nStarting in the vibrant independent country scene in Texas, Cody Johnson is now a household name for country fans who appreciate a more classic sound. Johnson is fiercely protective of country music and writes a seriously compelling love song. Stream \"Nothing On You\" when you're looking to get romantic, or \"Dear Rodeo,\" which features an appearance from Reba McEntire, for a glimpse into Johnson's past as a rodeo cowboy.\n\nHe's had a lot of mainstream success, but Jon Pardi's music is still rooted in classic country sensibilities. \"Dirt on My Boots\" is a perfect party anthem, while \"Heartache Medication\" continues the genre's time-honored drinking song tradition.\n\nBoth an accomplished songwriter who's penned hits for Miranda Lambert and Kacey Musgraves and a talented artist in her own right, Brandy Clark is a country music powerhouse. Stream \"Stripes,\" a cheeky track about staving off the desire for revenge, or \"Big Day in a Small Town\" for a dose of small-town nostalgia.\n\nEven though his sound can definitely be better classified as Americana or folk than country, Jason Isbell still brings plenty to the table for fans who appreciate well-written songs and beautiful guitar melodies. His breakout album \"Southeastern\" is a great place to start, but be warned: it's packed with tear-jerkers.\n\nMore of an American music traditionalist than explicitly a country singer, Rhiannon Giddens is a remarkably talented musician whose sound is rooted in classic Americana influences, and counts artists like Eric Church among her fans.\n\nA powerhouse vocalist known for churning out hits as a songwriter, Chris Stapleton has had a remarkably successful solo career. What really put him on the map for many fans is his cover of David Allan Coe's \"Tennessee Whiskey,\" a soulful spin on an old classic with a seriously timeless sound.\n\nGeorgia native Brent Cobb has written hits for artists like Miranda Lambert and the Oak Ridge Boys, and his solo work is equally solid. His work blends classic country influences with bluegrass instrumentation, producing a distinct sound that's eminently listenable.\n\nIn the world of mainstream country, Luke Combs is about as neo-traditional as it gets. Sure, his tunes mostly focus on drinking beer and having a good time, but there's no denying his talent as a vocalist or his charismatic appeal as a performer.\n\nA relative newcomer as a solo star, Hailey Whitters has written songs for Nashville heavy-hitters like Alan Jackson and Lori McKenna. Her own songs are soulful and stunningly performed, evidenced by her 2020 album \"The Dream.\"\n\nBrandi Carlile's work spans genres, but it's firmly rooted in traditional country. A frequent collaborator with legends like Tanya Tucker, her 2018 album \"By The Way, I Forgive You\" is a remarkable modern country album.\n\nA former busker and hitchhiker, Charley Crockett is the definition of a troubadour. His music weaves together country, blues, Americana, and rock into a smooth, distinct sound. His 2021 album \"10 For Slim: Charley Crockett Sings James Hand\" is a beautiful tribute to his friend and a Texas music legend."
