        "text": "Post by shaq91 on\n\nTom Jones to release 1st album in US in 15 years\n\nNEW YORK, Tue Sep 16, 06:14 PM\n\nAfter 15 years without a new album in the U.S., Tom Jones will release a disc of almost entirely original material this fall.\n\nThe 68-year-old singer will release \"24 Hours\" on Nov. 25 on S-Curve Records. It's a retro-tinged album much in the style of Amy Winehouse's \"Back to Black\" that finds the Welshman's voice as strong as ever.\n\n\"The fire is still in me,\" Jones told The Associated Press in a recent interview, speaking by phone from his home in Los Angeles. \"Not to be an oldie, but a goodie. I want to be a contender.\"\n\nThe disc was produced by British production duo Future Cat, who have cut tracks for Lily Allen, Kate Nash and others. With backing horns and an almost Stax Records kind of soul, the sound is distinctly retro.\n\n\"We've been thinking about this for a while, doing a retro sound but new,\" said Jones. \"And Amy Winehouse, she cracked it. When that album came out, my son called me right away and said, `You know what we've been talking about? Listen to this.'\"\n\nSince he released the hit \"It's Not Unusual\" in 1965, Jones has sold more than 100 million records worldwide. While his 2000 album \"Reload\" was a hit in Europe and elsewhere (buoyed by the club hit \"Sex Bomb\"), it was never released in the U.S. — which Jones calls \"a shame.\"\n\n\"The hits that I've had recently have all been European,\" he said. \"I've had a lot of success worldwide, which is a pain because I live here and I do most of my shows in America. ... Hopefully this will straighten that out.\"\n\nJones, who regularly performs in Las Vegas, believes his voice hasn't aged — thanks partly to his careful treatment of it; he takes a humidifier with him traveling to keep his throat from drying. Jones even believes his lower registers have gotten richer.\n\n\"I wanted my voice to sound as natural as possible,\" Jones said of the album. \"The arrangements and the production needs to be modern, but the vocal needs to sound like me.\"\n\nThere are two covers on the album — Bruce Springsteen's \"The Hitter\" and \"I'm Alive\" by Tommy James and the Shondells — but the rest Jones either co-wrote or collaborated with the songwriters. Bono and the Edge of U2 guest on the song \"Sugar Daddy.\"\n\n\"I love doing the songs that I've had success with and the audience keeps those alive,\" Jones said. \"But I love moving on.\"\n\nSource: www.optimum.net/News/AP/Article?articleId=465570\n\nPost by busyboy on\n\n01.

Nobody's Fault But Mine\n\n09. Didn't It Rain\n\n10. Ain't No Grave\n\n11. Run On\n\n12. Praise & Blame\n\nAmazonProduct Description\n\n\"We wanted to go back to basics, go back to the source, it was just me singing live with a rhythm section - no overdubbing, no gimmicks, no complicated horn and string arrangements, just get the song down in an entire take, capture the meaning of the song, its spirituality, its life, and capture that moment, right there. And I think that's what we've done,\" says Tom Jones, the veteran singer from Wales, who turns 70 this year and who has just completed `Praise and Blame', his follow up to 2008's acclaimed `24 Hours' and quite simply his finest work to date.\n\nIt is a truly remarkable record, one that captures the Tom Jones who listened to Mahalia Jackson and Sister Rosetta Tharpe on the radio as a child growing up, who thought gospel music was \"just like rock'n'roll, every bit as exciting but with deeper lyrics\", the Tom Jones who belted out The Lord's Prayer as a jubilatory spiritual in school assembly, \"because that was the only way I knew how to sing it, it was natural for me.\"\n\nThis is Tom Jones going back to his roots on an album of gospel, blues, traditional and country songs, wearing his heart on his sleeve, emotionally raw and true.\n\nRecording with producer Ethan Johns (Kings Of Leon, Ray LaMontagne, Paolo Nutini, Laura Marling) at Peter Gabriel's Real World Studios in the little village of Box in Wiltshire, coaxed the most exhilarating performances out of the singer.\n\nWith musicians including steel guitarist BJ Cole, keyboardist Booker T Jones (of Memphis soul legends Booker T and the MGs), Hammond organist Chris Holland and background vocalists Gillian Welch, Alison Pierce, Dave Rawlings and Orin Waters at hand, Tom has quite simply delivered his tour de force. It's him bearing his soul, singing from the heart, telling it like it is.\n\nPraise & Blame was released yesterday in the US. I really like it, but then again, I'm a sucker for this sort of projects - Johnny Cash and Neil Diamond also come to mind - for whatever reason."
