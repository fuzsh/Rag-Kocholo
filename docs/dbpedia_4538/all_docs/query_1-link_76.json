        "text": "He might be 75 years old, but Tom Jones has still got it.\n\nIn his new album, \"Long Lost Suitcase,\" Jones bears a side of himself seldom heard. It's blues, it's country, it's rock, but above all, perhaps, it's a crooner telling the tale of his six-decade career in song. Jones recently sat down with Take Two's Alex Cohen to talk about the album that he's \"always wanted to make.\"\n\nIt all started with radio\n\nTom Jones contracted tuberculosis at a young age, which left him bedridden for two years. The singer passed much of this time listening to the radio.\n\n\"That's where I got my influences from, I think,\" Jones says. \"The BBC — in those days — they had to play everything because they had two stations. Then there was Radio Luxembourg as well, which was coming out of Luxembourg, Germany, and they would play a lot of American roots music, which I was very much interested in. So much so that I was in school and I sang the Lord's Prayer and the music teacher said to me, 'why are you singing this like a negro spiritual?'\"\n\nGetting his 'rock and roll rocks off'\n\nAfter nearly five decades of being widely known as Tom Jones of \"It's Not Unusual\" fame, Jones says that his new album has been a long time coming. With the help of longtime producer and multi-instrumentalist Ethan Johns, Jones selected some of his favorite songs to remake in his own style. When asked if he saw this album as a chance to get his rock and roll \"ya-yas\" out. Jones quickly replied, \"yes.\"\n\n\"The songs, especially on this album now, are songs that I've always wanted to do,\" Jones says. \"'The Green Grass of Home' and 'It's Not Unusual,' they were all great records … but I never got a chance in those days to record some of the roots music that I listen to, that I grew up listening to. I still do 'It's Not Unusual,' but we do it more in keeping with the stuff I'm doing now ... But you're right, I'm getting my rock and roll rocks off if you'd like.\" Jones says.\n\nPress the blue play button above to hear Take Two's interview with Tom Jones."
