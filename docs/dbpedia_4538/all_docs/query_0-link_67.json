        "text": "On a date to tour the city, George tells Cocoa that “Most people are confined to ghettos by economic circumstances…. the young and talented confine themselves by choice” (Naylor 65). The city is an often cruel, unfair place where “there was little enough of [kindness]…to kill off in one shot” (Naylor 59). It is also sometimes an unfriendly place; the city has a kind of cold, informal aura about it. Take for example, the description Cocoa uses to describe the waitress service at the restaurant: “especially when the check came glued to the bottom of your dessert plate…watching a big greasy thumbprint spread slowly over the Thank You printed on the back” (Naylor 13). The unfriendliness is enough for a Southern girl like Cocoa to turn her back on the city and not give it a chance, as so many others had.\n\nA place where everyone says “hi” to each other, regardless of whether or not they know each other. Thus, she was immediately struck by the strange behavior of her new fellow city-dwellers, from whom you should not expect even a grumbled “hi”. In the country, this seemingly mundane action is necessary, both for the individual and society as a whole. For the individual it is required to not make the person stand out for snobbery, and for society it is necessary to maintain the feeling of community. In the country, people have been and are dependent on each other. Historically, it was necessary for safety reasons. How can you trust someone you’ve never even greeted? In current times, it is for more conventional reasons, such as the mere fact that everyone knows everyone, and your behavior towards one could influence how you are perceived by everyone else. In the city, none of this is necessary, as you will likely never meet the people you run into on the streets again. Nobody knows everyone, and everyone is dependent only on themselves. As a result, the little polite acts slowly wither\n\nIntroduction Experiences are important in human lives to be able to look at different cultures, art and humanity. It helps one get a sense of how others live their lives. Country music has been a staple in the south for being a feel-good kind of music. Thomas Rhett’s concert helped me to get a better sense of the environment of a country concert and the people. He showcased many aspects that come with the genre of country music.\n\nThe novel has two young adolescence boys that go out to a town village to meet with each other and switch lives. The examples of the literary era of Realism are the concept of Prince Edward and Tom Canty switching lives. The two boys are Prince Edward and Tom Canty. Tom Canty is a pauper is a small village. His father an abusive drunk and abuses him. Tom works in order to give the money to his father. His father abuses the money by buying alcohol. Prince Edward gets appointed as king of Wales. Wales is a town where the two boys meet up to switch lives with each other. Tom goes and switches lives and goes to the palace. He has a hard time trying to do what a proper prince is supposed to do. He does not know how to have manners while eating or talk properly. Edward goes to Tom’s house and is very dissatisfied by the way that Tom lives in. Edward must deal with the fact that tom has to work here for years. Edward stays with Hendon for a few days and he looks after him with sustenance, garments, and sits tight for the day the kid improves from his dysfunctional\n\nPicture living in a community where every minute of every day you were hungry, under-clothed, and afraid death because you are poor. A world in which child dies of hunger every 5 seconds. Now imagine waking up and your biggest problem was which sweater to wear with which jeans. Even though this seems hard to imagine, this life of poverty has been a reality for most people for ages. Before the1900s, few wealthy people would ever think about poverty. Two prominent authors were Garrett Hardin and Peter Singer, who wrote essays about human poverty. They questioned whether to confront the issue of poverty or to ignore it. The first essay is \"Life Ethics: the Case Against Helping the Poor\" from the\n\nAs for New York City, in the novel it is defined as the perfect place to live life to the fullest and not have a care of the world. As a reader, it is expected to envision this city full of lights as a bright, restless, and colorful place. Nick Carraway depicts New York City as a “...city rising up across the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of non-olfactory money. The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of\n\nAmateur City, a city filled with confusion and intolerable human behavior. In this detective fiction novel, Katherine Forrest demonstrates the social, sexual and power dynamic of each character which all leads to the curious homicide of Fergus Parker. In Forrest’s Amateur City there are multiple analysis regarding the characters of the “Modern Office” also including the detective Kate Delafield. Amateur City portrays a huge hierarchy of the predominant human society in which the class of race, ethnicity and gender are all divided in the image of Forrest’s characters. The social, sexual and power dynamic of the “Modern Office” provides a powerful message in Forrest’s Amateur City, which clearly magnifies the realistic and true nature of\n\nThe purpose of films is to entertain an audience through the appeal of its characters and the plot. In many cases, most people overlook the setting which plays a major role in the experience. The choice of location/city by the writer is also a protagonist which can mold the events within the story. More often than not, creators romanticize the cities by masking the location with their twisted plots---subsiding the presence of the setting. The reader will view an in depth comparison of the films, Spring Fever and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, and how the location assists in the development of the plot and the characterization of the city.\n\nThere is a big difference in older country music and today’s country music. Older country music tells stories, and today’s just talks about women and getting drunk. If these people did as much drinking as they say they do then we wouldn’t have any new country singers. The newer stuff sounds a lot like hip hop or rap. What does everyone think of when they hear the words country music; that’s what I thought a cowboy. How does everyone picture a cowboy? Is he in skinny jeans and a flat bill hat? No, everyone pictures that fairy tale story about a cowboy and a cowgirl falling for one another. The reason that 90’s country music is better is because, it does not sound like hip hop, it actually tells stories, and it does not just talk about drinking.\n\nA Tale of Two Cities, written by Charles Dickens, takes place during the French Revolution. The book centers on the heroic attempts of Sydney Carton and Charles Darnay. Sydney Carton puts on the façade of being insolent and indifferent, but his true nature is expressed in the book when he puts others first, defends Charles, and dies for the ones he loves. Charles Darnay is a once wealthy aristocrat whose attempts at heroism include going back to France, his financial sacrifice, and the noble way in which he was willing to face his death.\n\nA Tale of Two Cities is a classic piece that explores many motifs through the lives of the characters it involves. The consequences of the desire for revenge and how it introduces ambiguity to the lives of Dr. Manette, Madam Defarge, and Mr. Defarge are masterfully played out in this literary work, in such a way that gives warning and hope at the same time. The message is clear: we are all human, and we are all in control. To what extent we allow the desire for revenge to control us is entirely in our\n\nWhile the Victorian people called for romantic intrigue and petty drama in the literature of their time, Dickens’ added complexity to his novels not to satisfy the frivolous needs of Victorians but to further the theme of irony in his novel. In A Tale of Two Cities, irony is an ever-present theme and is woven into the plot seamlessly by author Charles Dickens. Coincidence is a complementary theme to irony in this novel. Dickens’ constant implementation of situations of coincidence and chance leads to a greater sense of irony throughout this book. Dickens adds complexity to the plot and further enforces the theme of irony in the novel through circumstances of coincidence, including the indictments of Charles Darnay, the life and associates of Dr. Manette, and Madame Defarge’s need for and path to revenge.\n\nCharles Dickens wrote A Tale of Two Cities in order to enlighten the average Briton about the events of the French Revolution. The novel compares and contrasts cities of London and Paris, which represent French and British society, through the eyes of Dickens’ human characters. The two cities play such a large part in the novel that they become characters themselves, and the contrasting societies of the two cities become a conflict. In Charles Dickens’ classic, A Tale of Two Cities, the individualistic society of London champions the first feudalistic and later socialistic society of Paris."
