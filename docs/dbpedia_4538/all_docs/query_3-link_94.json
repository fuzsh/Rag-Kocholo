        "text": "We asked fans who attended Tuesday’s concert by Tom Jones to share their impressions of the show. Here is a sample of the responses.\n\nWhat is it about a 68 year old man who can make women want to throw their bras and panties at him and scream like pre-teens? This 47-year-old lost it when the tanned, sexy, and charismatic Tom Jones stepped on stage.\n\nJumping up and down, pulling my hair, screaming, I am not even ashamed to have had my 19-year-old daughter witness my lack of control. His voice never sounded better and he satisfied with every great timeless song that seemed to cover every genre. I don’t know when I have had more fun at a concert. I am spent!\n\nSande Hart\n\nRancho Santa Margarita\n\n***\n\nWOW! Once again, Tom has done it – exceeded my expectations! He just gets better! He is timeless! He is versatile! He is phenomenal!\n\nTom and his very talented band were amazing as they seamlessly went from each genre covered during their performance. His voice and presence were captivating. I particularly loved the blues tune he and his acoustic guitarist played about “gettin’ some”!\n\nWhat a man! I can’t wait to see him again!\n\nTracey Leyvas\n\nLake Forest\n\n***\n\nThe panties were flying, women were screaming and couples dancing. At 68, the man still has it. The Tom Jones show at the Pacific Amphitheatre was an event to be experienced. Jones’ band, especially the horn section, rocked out and Mr. Jones looked he was having as much fun as the crowd he was entertaining. My song highlights were “I’m Never Going To Fall In Love” and a bluesy number called “Grandma’s Hands.” Of course “What’s New Pussycat” and “It’s Not Unusual” had the masses on their feet. Great show, great time had by all.\n\nMark Mahoney\n\nSeal Beach\n\n***\n\nI attended the concert last night. I may not be the ideal person to give a review because I’ve never been a big fan (I went as a favor to a friend whose would-be escort canceled on her at the last moment), but for that same reason, I may be more unbiased.\n\nMy first impression when Jones came on stage was that he was old, fat, and sweaty. Not at all what I had imagined given his sexy, hearthrob reputation. A sentiment shared by numerous women I spoke to. Now, we all age, so the fact that he was older now is nothing I would hold against him. However, the fact that he apparently is in denial about his age and physical condition and continues to prance, gyrate, growl and use hand gestures towards his genital region in an effort to still be “sexy” was bothersome.\n\nHis managers should have a frank talk with him to advise Jones that his sex idol days are long over. They’d be doing him a favor in encouraging him to focus on his singing, dancing (although dropping some weight and getting into better shape would certainly help in this area), and other aspects of showmanship rather than doing all of that ridiculous “I’m so sexy and I know ya want me!” posturing. Honestly, at one point when he sang “take off your dress” and lifted his shirt up to reveal a large paunchy stomach, I thought, “Oh, please! You’ve got to be kidding me!”\n\nIn his defense, the audience, surprisingly age diversified, seemed to still respond to his silly-sexy antics. Which is perhaps why he continues to do it, having fallen into the trap of having to continue to play the part that longtime fans have kept him locked into.\n\nAll in all, I believe he tried to entertain the crowd, and for the most part the audience certainly responded to him, I think stemming largely from idolized nostalgia. For myself, it wasn’t a show I would’ve chosen to see, and I was glad I hadn’t paid for the tickets. Although I did enjoy the opening set from Sheila E. and her group.\n\nCynthia Roberts\n\nSanta Ana\n\n***\n\nIn a word, Tom Jones was AMAZING! Wait, more words. He was also FUN, FUNNY, ENERGETIC and ENTERTAINING. He comes across at least 20 years younger than he is, and a zillion times more charming than I expected. What I thought was really great is that the man is no diva. He made sure his band and background singers were acknowledged and he made the crowd feel appreciated for being there. His voice is strong and so is his sex appeal! All you have to do is count the underwear thrown on stage to confirm that! He’s awesome because he takes it all so well and really plays off the crowd.\n\nI love the fair, I really love the concerts and I’m really happy they had Tom Jones here this year!\n\nStephanie Barker\n\nAliso Viejo\n\n***\n\nI would say the concert was just OK. He’s not the same man he was 30 years ago – course, I’m not either. Liked the old stuff he sang. Can’t say I would rush out to buy seats for his next concert. Would be interested to hear what others have to say.\n\nHad fun watching the gal throw the granny panties complete with ruffles on the rear!\n\nBob Saunders\n\nAnaheim\n\n***\n\nLast night i took my 16-year-old daughter Alyssa to see Tom Jones. This was her first ever concert experience and we had great down-front seats. It turned out to be the best choice either of us could have made. I don’t know what the rest of the amphitheater was doing, but Mr. Jones turned our section into his own private party. It’s been a long time since I have seen so many people (especially women) dancing and singing along with an entertainer. The attractive lady next to me literally pummeled me half to death with numerous portions of her anatomy.\n\nNo other man Tom Jones’ age could move so suggestively with such ease and not look like a fool, but he pulled it off in spades while simultaneously burning the women to the ground. The man is nothing short of a national treasure.\n\nOh, and did I mention women’s undergarments? Yes, there were various unmentionables flung with abandon at the Welsh crooner much to everyone’s delight. What unbridled fun we both had!\n\nDan Johancsik\n\nHuntington Beach\n\n***\n\nMy husband and I attended the concert to celebrate his 50th birthday. We remember “This is Tom Jones” from our younger days (who can forget the tie tossed into the audience or the sexy little dance moves he had?) but we’ve grown into true fans and appreciate the diversity of his talent. On Tuesday, he not only did the well-recognized favorites, but did some ’60s standards, some blues, and country-western, to name a few. Sure, he’s older and not as agile. Sure, his voice isn’t what it used to be. But despite the six drunk women behind us who wouldn’t shut up, I enjoyed every moment of the show. Tom is a gentleman and a performer … and still hot!\n\nAimee Smolik\n\nFullerton\n\n***\n\nMy wife and I purchased tickets for Tom Jones,because as a kid growing up I remember how into him she was. We took my mom, dad, sister and the two of us. Before the concert started we ran into several people who were at the concert for the same reason – good old mom! Some were with mom and some were there in memory of mom but the common thread was mom.\n\nAs for the concert itself, he still has got it! I hope when I get to that age I can look and move as well. He was able to hit all his notes and I must say I would go see him again! P.S. the panties were still flying.\n\nTroy Gianerakis\n\nWestminster\n\n***\n\nTom Jones, this vibrant “young man” of 68, can still entertain and make you feel good! He made me feel so energized especially since I am his age. I grew up playing his records and just couldn’t get enough of his music. I would crank the sound up on my record player so my neighbor could enjoy his marvelous voice along with me, as she loved him too, so we had a ball singing along with Tom in my backyard. There really is no one quite like Tom Jones so Tom, please keep on entertaining as long as you can because so many of us still love you, your voice and your music!!! Thank you for the opportunity to know you Mr. Jones.\n\nKaren Goettsch\n\nCosta Mesa\n\n***\n\nSir Tom was amazing at the Pacific Amphitheatre last night. His voice was flawless. He was movin’ and groovin’ to “I Like the Way You Move” and I sure LOVED the way he moved. He sang “She’s A Lady” which was the biggest thrill for me. It is my favorite song. He lit up the stage and it was a non-stop, fantastic evening!!!\n\nNaomi Glass\n\nIrvine\n\n***\n\nHe’s still got it – albeit it a little sunbaked and saggy! Now if someone could just tell him about Dri-Fit! He was like a thundershower on stage! Nonetheless, it seemed that everyone, from my 16-year-old daughter and her boyfriend, to the 80-something-year-olds behind us, had a good time as there were all sizes and shapes of panties (and maybe even a few briefs) flying through the air. He’s quite the entertainer!\n\nJoVonna Kingkade\n\nCorona del Mar\n\n***\n\nWhat a wonderful evening. It could not have been better – almost a full moon, beautiful weather, a great opening with Shelia E and then there is Tom Jones, so ageless, so awesome!\n\nAs many of his fans last night I grew up watching him on his weekly show. I was only around 9 years old at the time and now I am going on 47 – seems like yesterday 🙂\n\nI wanted to thank my friend Robin Combs for my wonderful birthday present – a Tom Jones concert!\n\nJacqualine Turner"
