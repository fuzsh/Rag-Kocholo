        "text": "Tom Jones is currently singing his heart out on a UK and EU tour and gearing up to head to North America. The crooner recently announced that he will continue on tour in the United States and Canada this fall. Despite being 84 years old, he isn’t taking much of a break between tours. Jones is heading to cities around the country including New York City, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Atlantic City and more.\n\nJones proved that retirement is not an option for him right now between releasing music and touring. His most recent studio album was released in 2021, titled Surrounded by Time. After he released the album, he became the oldest male artist to top the UK album chart. Several of the songs were set aside for decades before he felt he could perform them well enough.\n\nJones explained at the time of the album’s release, “So I had two songs. I had ‘I’m Growing Old,’ which Bobby Cole gave me in the 70s in Vegas. I told him, ‘I don’t think I’m old enough to record that yet.’ I said, ‘If I ever get there…’ ‘Maybe 70,’ I thought. But it turns out I’m 80. So I thought, ‘Well, now’s the time to do it.’ And the same thing with ‘Ol’ Mother Earth,’ which was a Tony Joe White song. I got to know Tony Joe White and I love his stuff. I thought, ‘What a great song that is!'”\n\nCheck out the full list of tour dates below and get tickets here.
