        "text": "How do you make a sprawling list of 100 tunes seem criminally short? Try to squeeze the greatest country songs of all time into that space.\n\nAs we considered a century's worth of story-driven songcraft, we did our darndest to make sure all of the greats were recognized. And when we say \"of all time,\" we mean all time.\n\nEvery era is reflected here, from the Carter Family and Jimmie Rodgers' historic recordings to the reign of the \"Nashville Sound,\" outlaws, singing cowboys and pop crossovers.\n\nAnd before you shake your fists and grumble furiously about how the list forgot \"Friends in Low Places\" or gave \"9 to 5\" the short stick, let's establish one basic rule: One song per artist, with the exception being duets.\n\nOne song from Cash. One song from Garth. And, yes, as tough as it can be, only one song from Dolly.\n\nNow, dust off your turntable (or boot up Spotify) and travel through 100 of the greatest tracks to come from Music City, Bakersfield and beyond.\n\nAgree or disagree? We want to hear from you: Join us on Reddit at 12 p.m. CDT Tuesday, Aug. 27 for an AMA with the writers who compiled this list\n\nCOUNTRY MILE: Artists, songs and lyrics take us through the rich history of country music\n\nDolly Parton — \"Jolene\"\n\nEvocative and woeful, Parton's marquee recording crosses genre and generations — a once-in-a-world song without boundaries.\n\nTim McGraw — “Live Like You Were Dying”\n\nMcGraw's 2004 ballad reminds listeners to love deeper, speak sweeter and give forgiveness that you've been denying.\n\nTammy Wynette — “Stand By Your Man”\n\nFive decades removed from hitting airwaves, and country music faithful still stand tall for Wynette and her booming chorus.\n\nBrad Paisley and Alison Krauss — “Whiskey Lullaby”\n\nIt's known for its layered, mournful instrumentation, but it's the ballad's devastating storytelling and Paisley's ability to softly serenade that makes \"Whiskey Lullaby\" one of country's best modern cuts.\n\nAlan Jackson — “Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning)”\n\nThe country music Class of 1989 returns to the all-time list, this time asking a question in the shadow of a generation-defining event.\n\nPatsy Montana — \"I Want to be a Cowboy’s Sweetheart\"\n\nIn 1935, this jaunty tune became the first country song by a female artist to sell more than 1 million copies. It's since been covered by everyone from Patti Page to Cyndi Lauper and Phish.\n\nClint Black — \"Killin’ Time\"\n\nOn his 1989 chart-topper, Black tried — and failed — to drink a woman off of his mind.\n\nEric Church — “Springsteen”\n\nChurch expertly captures a fleeting feeling chased by all musicians — like the chorus says, “Sometimes a melody sounds like a memory.”\n\nChris Stapleton — \"Tennessee Whiskey\"\n\nWith a rough but welcoming warmth, Stapleton croons a rendition of this country classic that’s worth toasting for years to come.\n\nGeorge Jones — “He Stopped Loving Her Today”\n\nThe years go slowly by, but Jones still preys upon our minds.\n\nDeanna Carter — \"Strawberry Wine\"\n\nA commercial and critical success still filling Lower Broadway taverns with a chorus that offers \"My first taste of love, oh bittersweet.\"\n\nKenny Rogers and Dolly Parton — “Islands in the Stream”\n\nOne of the biggest pop-country crossovers in history, the beloved duet has lived on through remixes and constant karaoke rotation.\n\nThe Judds — “Why Not Me”\n\nWith the title track of their debut album, mother and daughter Naomi and Wynonna Judd made their case for being the biggest country duo of the ‘80s.\n\nConway Twitty — \"Hello Darlin' \"\n\nThis self-penned tune became Twitty’s signature song, about a guy who can’t get over the woman he wronged and lost.\n\nLoretta Lynn — “Coal Miner's Daughter\"\n\nA song, a film and a way of life for a generation raised on Lynn's working-class honesty.\n\nKris Kristofferson — “Sunday Morning Coming Down”\n\nCash made it famous, but no song may better exemplify the power and impact of Kristofferson's pen.\n\nDon Williams — “Good Ole Boys Like Me”\n\nDuring the song's 1980 release and beyond, Williams explains why \"we're all gonna be what we're gonna be.\"\n\nJimmie Rodgers — “Blue Yodel (T for Texas)”\n\nRecorded more than 90 years ago, \"T for Texas\" is considered by many to be the premier song from a blue yodelin' father to the genre.\n\nCarter Family — “Can the Circle Be Unbroken (By and By)”\n\nA torch-bearing call for country music that’s still celebrated on stages today.\n\nRay Price — “Heartaches by the Number”\n\nIt spent 40 weeks on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart and 60 years at the top of mind for 1950s country classics.\n\nRosanne Cash — “Seven Year Ache”\n\nCovered in drum loops and 1980s synthesized production, it's Rosanne Cash's sorrow that stands the test of time.\n\nSteve Earle — “Guitar Town”\n\nA foot-stomping country-rock tribute to wanderlust down a lost highway.\n\nOld Crow Medicine Show — “Wagon Wheel”\n\nSure, Darius Rucker made it a hit, but little comes close to experiencing Old Crow howling this singalong for thousands of invested onlookers.\n\nJeannie C. Riley — “Harper Valley PTA”\n\nA fictional Tennessee scandal that took Riley to the top of Billboard's Hot 100 chart.\n\nMiranda Lambert — “The House That Built Me”\n\nThe fastest-rising single of Lambert’s career remains a haunting exploration of her music's ability to resonate for repeated listens.\n\nKitty Wells — “It Wasn’t God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels”\n\nTwo-and-a-half minutes of truth that launched a career for this Tennessee legend.\n\nJerry Reed — “Eastbound and Down”\n\nCountry music's best addition to soundtrack canon? Maybe — it's the most lively, at least.\n\nRoger Miller — “King of the Road”\n\nA soft tap on the bass, a snap of the finger and Miller's off to croon listeners with his 1964 vagabond tale.\n\nWaylon Jennings and Willie Nelson — “Mammas Don’t Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys”\n\nTwo of the genre’s finest unite for a heartfelt warning that cowboys “never stay home and they’re always alone, even with someone they love.”\n\nGeorge Strait and Alan Jackson — “Murder on Music Row”\n\n\"Someone killed country music/ Cut out its heart and soul,” Strait laments on the seething duet. It was released in 2000, but the sentiment still strikes a chord today.\n\nBobbie Gentry — “Ode to Billie Joe”\n\nWhat did Billie Joe throw off the bridge? Regardless of the answer, Gentry captivates with every word.\n\nVince Gill — “Go Rest High on That Mountain”\n\nAn awe-inspiring musical eulogy from Gill, delivered best during times when something moving needs to be heard.\n\nJohnny Cash — “I Walk the Line”\n\nCash released his ode to temptation in 1956, cementing words in musical history that hold true in 2019.\n\nMarty Robbins — “El Paso”\n\nComplemented by Spanish picking, \"El Paso\" offers a bloody romance worthy of western songwriting.\n\nKeith Whitley — “I’m No Stranger to the Rain”\n\nThe last single released during Whitley's lifetime shows the singer peacefully reminding listeners that \"I've fought with the devil, got down on his level/ But I never gave in, so he gave up on me.\"\n\nEddy Arnold — \"The Cattle Call\"\n\nThe Tennessee Plowboy yodels his lonesome call, a sound that would shape country to come.\n\nReba McEntire — “Fancy”\n\nWritten by Bobbie Gentry in 1969, the almighty Reba unleashed fire with her show-closing 1990 version of this song.\n\nBuck Owens — “Act Naturally”\n\nA love song for the starry-eyed dreamers wishing about one day being put in the movies.\n\nTrisha Yearwood — “Walkaway Joe”\n\nZeal turns awry in the beloved 1990s ballad from Yearwood.\n\nLady Antebellum — \"Need You Now\"\n\nBehind the band's gorgeous harmony, Lady A sings of a longing some may know too well.\n\nShania Twain — \"Man! I Feel Like a Woman\"\n\nThe 1990s country anthem passed from Generation X mothers for millennial daughters to make their own.\n\nTaylor Swift — “Mean”\n\nIn a characteristically triumphant move, Swift turns a tune about scathing critics into the brightest addition of her country music catalog.\n\nVern Gosdin — “Chiseled in Stone”\n\nA tear-jerking ballad worthy of the Country Music Association's Song of the Year award in 1989.\n\nBlake Shelton — \"Ol' Red\"\n\nBefore it was a chain of bars, Ol’ Red was the prison dog that helped Shelton’s character bust out (thanks to his cousin’s bluetick hound.)\n\nRonnie Milsap — \"Smoky Mountain Rain\"\n\nHomecoming leads to heartbreak on Milsap's 1980 chart-topper, wherein the singer \"thumbed my way from L.A. back to Knoxville,\" only to find his love has moved on.\n\nTom T. Hall — \"Old Dogs, Children and Watermelon Wine\"\n\n\"The Storyteller\" drew from a real-life encounter for one of his greatest tales. During a trip to Miami, he met a janitor at his hotel, who told him there were \"three things in this world that's worth a solitary dime.\"\n\nGeorge Strait — “Amarillo By Morning”\n\nThe King of Country Music subtly parades his royal status with a crisp story from the road.\n\nBob Wills and His Texas Playboys — “Stay a Little Longer”\n\nA taste of traditional western swing that simply asks listeners to dance all night and stay a little longer.\n\nAlabama — “My Home's in Alabama\"\n\nCountry music's 6½-minute calling card to the South.\n\nEmmylou Harris and Gram Parsons — “Love Hurts”\n\nNearly 60 years since being initially released — and 45 years since Harris and Parsons' duet — yes, love can still hurt.\n\nRicky Skaggs — “Country Boy”\n\nA slick-picking piece of country music (and No. 1 hit) from one of the finest to pick up an instrument.\n\nErnest Tubb — “Walking the Floor Over You”\n\nA 1941 entry in which Tubbs shares a restlessness in a simple chorus: \"I'm walking the floor over you/ I can't sleep a wink, that is true. I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two/ Walking the floor over you.\"\n\nGlen Campbell — “Rhinestone Cowboy”\n\n\"Rhinestone Cowboy\" defined Campbell's career. It was a country-pop hit that kept the singer balanced between each world.\n\nCarrie Underwood — “Before He Cheats”\n\nCountry music has its share of anthems for scorned women, but Underwood’s signature song is the gold standard. An instant classic upon its release in 2006.\n\nCharley Pride — “Kiss an Angel Good Morning”\n\nWith the biggest of his dozens of hits, the Country Music Hall of Famer shared the key to marital bliss: “Kiss an angel good morning/ And love her like the devil when you get back home.”\n\nDavid Allan Coe — “You Never Even Called Me By My Name”\n\nJohn Prine didn’t want credit when he co-wrote this kiss-off to Music Row. But it was the perfect message to be delivered by Coe, perhaps country music’s most infamous outsider.\n\nWillie Nelson — “Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain”\n\nThe Red Headed Stranger narrates a story of emotional messiness with soothing clarity.\n\nJohnny Paycheck — “Take This Job and Shove It”\n\nIt spawned an eternal catchphrase, but don’t forget there’s another layer to Paycheck’s lone chart-topper: “My woman done left and took all the reasons I was working for.”\n\nTanya Tucker — “Delta Dawn”\n\nRecorded when she was just 13, Tanya Tucker’s first haunting hit is ironically about an aging Southern belle, one who's under the delusion that a long-gone suitor is still coming for her.\n\nPatsy Cline — “Crazy”\n\nIt’s been covered by the likes of Neil Young, LeAnn Rimes and Linda Ronstadt, but no artist captured Willie Nelson’s lyrical poignancy the way Cline did with her 1961 version.\n\nKeith Urban — “Somebody Like You\"\n\nUrban sounds unstoppable on his 2002 chart-topper, a love song that's also wrapped up in his personal redemption.\n\nGarth Brooks — “The Dance”\n\nWhat one song could possibly capture the career of this country music giant? How about the 1990 entry showcasing Brooks’ unparalleled ability to embody a story worth singing for decades to come?\n\nCharlie Rich — “Behind Closed Doors”\n\nCountry love songs didn't get much more suggestive than Rich's 1973 hit.\n\nTennessee Ernie Ford — \"Sixteen Tons\"\n\nIt may be one of country’s most depressing songs, and in this genre, that’s saying something. Ford’s beyond saving in his 1955 recording, as he’s “sold my soul to the company store.”\n\nDwight Yoakam — “Guitars, Cadillacs”\n\nWhen he found himself in Hollywood with a broken heart and shattered dreams, Yoakam clung to hope with his \"guitars, Cadillacs (and) hillbilly music.\" Soon enough, it made him one of country's biggest stars.\n\nHank Williams Jr. — “Family Tradition”\n\nWhile he explained that he was only following in his dad’s rowdy footsteps, “Bocephus” also truly stepped out of Hank Sr.’s shadow with this 1979 smash.\n\nOak Ridge Boys — \"Elvira\"\n\nGiddy-up! We dare you to name a song that’s more fun to sing than this Oaks “oom-poppa” classic (named after an East Nashville street).\n\nRay Charles — \"You Don't Know Me\"\n\nCharles’ heartbreaking spin on the Eddy Arnold/Cindy Walker song is the pinnacle of his landmark album “Modern Sounds in Country & Western Music.”\n\nKenny Rogers — “The Gambler”\n\nRaise a glass to timeless advice.\n\nLittle Big Town — “Girl Crush”\n\nSome radio programmers were terrified of this 2014 song — in which Karen Fairchild sings of wanting to “taste (the) lips” of the woman who has her love interest’s attention — but listeners, critics and Music Row gave it a full embrace.\n\nLee Brice — “I Drive Your Truck”\n\nBrice’s powerful 2012 hit was inspired by a true story of a father who found comfort in driving the truck once owned by his son, who’d been killed while serving in Afghanistan.\n\nLacy J. Dalton — \"16th Avenue\"\n\nSeveral years after she found country stardom, Dalton made sure to tip her hat to those still chasing their dream on Nashville’s Music Row — aka 16th Avenue South.\n\nPorter Wagoner — “The Green, Green Grass of Home”\n\nBefore Tom Jones, Elvis and dozens of others put their spin on Curly Putman's classic, Wagoner first made it a hit. In a devastating twist, it turns out he's dreaming of his hometown while on death row.\n\nMerle Haggard — “Mama Tried”\n\nA slippy lead guitar, Haggard's sketched storytelling ... California country with \"Mama Tried.\"\n\nRandy Travis — “Forever and Ever, Amen”\n\nTravis lays out his devotion in his signature song, and listeners haven't stopped loving it since its release in 1987.\n\nRoy Acuff — “Wabash Cannonball”\n\nThis folk song about a mighty train had already been passed down for generations when Acuff cut it in 1936, and his version helped the \"Wabash\" legend spread around the world.\n\nGuy Clark — \"Desperados Waiting for a Train\"\n\nClark penned a beautiful tribute to his grandmother's boyfriend, Jack Prigg, \"an old school man of the world\" who would sing \"Red River Valley\" with the budding songwriter.\n\nBrooks & Dunn — \"Believe\"\n\nThe country duo won multiple awards for this soulful ballad of unwavering faith.\n\nThe Highwaymen — \"Highwayman\"\n\nOnly songwriting great Jimmy Webb could conjure up an epic theme worthy of country's greatest supergroup, composed of Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Kris Kristofferson and Willie Nelson.\n\nLarry Gatlin and the Gatlin Brothers — \"All the Gold in California\"\n\nIn soaring three-part harmony, the Gatlins issued a warning to all who head west with stars in their eyes: \"It don't matter at all where you've played before/\n\nCalifornia's a brand-new game.\"\n\nCharlie Daniels Band — \"The Devil Went Down to Georgia\"\n\nIn 1979, Daniels found the perfect showcase for his fiery fiddle technique — a familiar tale about a boy named Johnny who makes a bet with the devil (and wins).\n\nJoe Diffie — “John Deere Green”\n\nAgainst all odds, tractors have nothing to do with Diffie's 1993 song. Instead, \"John Deere Green\" is the color used to paint \"Billy Bob loves Charlene\" on the town's water tower.\n\nEarl Thomas Conley — \"Holding Her and Loving You\"\n\nIt doesn’t have a chorus, but “Holding Her and Loving You” has quite a hook. Conley counts down the hardest things he'll ever do, and the song's title tops the list.\n\nDixie Chicks — \"Wide Open Spaces\"\n\nWith the title track of their breakthrough album — about a young woman who's ready to spread her wings — the Dixie Chicks truly took flight.\n\nKacey Musgraves — \"Follow Your Arrow\"\n\nOn top of taking mainstream country into new territory with its \"Kiss lots of boys/ Or kiss lots of girls\" line, \"Follow Your Arrow\" was a powerful mission statement from Musgraves, as she's proven to have great artistic instincts.\n\nPatty Loveless — \"How Can I Help You Say Goodbye\"\n\n\"Time will ease your pain,\" Loveless sang. That may be true, but this tearjerker about carrying on after a move, a divorce and the death of a parent still stings 25 years later.\n\nSugarland — “Stay”\n\nWhat if \"Jolene\" could have given her side of the story? On Sugarland's massive 2007 hit, Jennifer Nettles sings from the perspective of a mistress, who begs her lover to stay before deciding she's tired of waiting.\n\nMartina McBride — \"Independence Day\"\n\nIt's often falsely assumed to be a patriotic song, but McBride's triumphant anthem is actually about a woman breaking free of an abusive relationship.\n\nLee Ann Womack — \"I Hope You Dance\"\n\nWhether you're singing it to your kids, a loved one or yourself, Womack's plea to live life to the fullest and take chances truly resonates.\n\nK.T. Oslin — \"80's Ladies\"\n\nOslin rocketed through the decades on her 1987 hit, which fittingly sounds very much like a product of its time. \"Now we're 80's ladies/ There ain't been much these ladies ain't tried.\"\n\nJohn Anderson — \"Swingin’ \"\n\nSure, it's about swinging on the porch (is it really, though?), but few country hits have strutted the way Anderson's feisty, horn-spiked 1983 hit does.\n\nNitty Gritty Dirt Band — \"Fishin’ in the Dark\"\n\n\"You and me going fishing in the dark/ Lying on our backs and counting the stars.\" NGDB's classic is all about simple pleasures, and listening to it is one, too.\n\nKenny Chesney — “The Good Stuff”\n\nKenny's bartender teaches him a valuable lesson: \"The good stuff\" isn't booze; it's the memories you make with your loved ones.\n\nGeorge Jones and Tammy Wynette — \"Golden Ring\"\n\nGeorge and Tammy's greatest duet explains that \"only love\" can transform a \"cold metallic thing\" into something more.\n\nLuke Bryan — “Drink a Beer”\n\nBryan didn't write this song, but he made a powerful connection to it, relating it to the deaths of his brother and sister. He sings about learning of the death of a friend and going to the pier they would sit at to \"watch the sunset disappear and drink a beer.\"\n\nLefty Frizzell — \"If You’ve Got the Money, I’ve Got the Time\"\n\nSome things never change. In 1950, Frizzell kicked off his celebrated career with this No. 1 tune about painting the town red and going \"honky tonkin.'\"\n\nToby Keith — \"How Do You Like Me Now\"\n\nKeith was already an established star, but he didn't really crank up the attitude until this 1999 hit, in which he rubs his success in the face of an unrequited love.\n\nWaylon Jennings — \"Only Daddy That’ll Walk the Line\"\n\n\"Everybody knows you've been stepping on my toes/ And I'm getting pretty tired of it.\" The outlaw legend is barely holding it together on his seething 1968 hit.\n\nEmmylou Harris, Dolly Parton and Linda Ronstadt — \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\"\n\nThe iconic trio finds exquisite harmony on a Rodney Crowell composition.\n\nHank Williams — “Your Cheatin’ Heart”\n\nSome consider this Williams entry, a can't-miss in country music history, to define the genre."
