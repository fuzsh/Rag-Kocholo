        "text": "In Curly Putman’s classic country song “Green, Green Grass of Home,” the narrator steps off a train and back into his hometown. He’s greeted by his family and comforted by the hallmarks of his childhood — his old house, and “the old oak tree that I used to play on.”\n\nIt’s a sweetly nostalgic song — until halfway through, the song abruptly switches from speaking to spoken word. It was all a dream, the narrator realizes. He’s in a prison cell; it’s the day of his execution. “For there’s a guard and there’s a sad old padre,” the narrator says. “On in we’ll walk at daybreak / Then again I’ll touch the green, green grass of home.”\n\nIt’s a bleak, melancholy turn — but one that’s cemented the song as a classic staple of the country music genre.\n\n“Green, Green Grass of Home” was written by Jackson County native Curly Putman, a country songwriter also known for co-writing the Tammy Wynette hit “D-I-V-O-R-C-E” and the George Jones track “He Stopped Loving Her Today.” Putnam left his hometown of Princeton, Alabama, after high school — there’s still a community park there named after him — and ended up in Nashville, where he took up songwriting.\n\nWhen he wrote “Green, Green Grass of Home,” which was partially inspired by John Huston’s 1950 film The Asphalt Jungle, he had never received any formal music training. “I wrote the best song I ever wrote and didn’t know what I was doing,” Putman told Wilson Living in 2009. “I do know I was touched deeply when I was singing it. I almost cried. I was struggling, trying to come up with something different.”\n\nIt’s hard to argue that he didn’t succeed. The song’s raw sentimentality and tragic twist ending drew a number of singers to record versions of it. It was first popularized by Porter Wagoner in 1965, and others — including Elvis Presley, Joan Baez, Merle Haggard, and Jerry Lee Lewis — soon followed with their own versions. Johnny Cash famously performed it for an audience of inmates on his 1968 album Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison, and the Grateful Dead worked it into a handful of live performances.\n\nBut arguably, the song’s best-known performance came from Welsh singer Tom Jones, who turned it into worldwide hit, topping the charts in Australia, Belgium, Ireland, Norway and England. Part of that success, Jones told The Mail on Sunday in 2011, came from the song’s universality.\n\n“This is about a man who is going to be hanged and he’s just reminiscing on the precious parts of his life,” he said. “It made me think of Wales when I recorded it — ‘the old home town looks the same.’ When I went back to [my hometown] Pontypridd in those days, getting off the train from London, those words would ring true. It seems like a lot of people relate the sentiment to their home, too.”\n\nPutman died in 2016 at the age of 85, but not before releasing one final version of the track on his 2010 album Write ‘em Sad – Sing ‘em Lonesome. In some ways, it’s the truest incarnation of the song — a man, facing the end of his life, mournfully reflecting on the previous parts of his life.\n\nOf course, Putman had plenty of time to reflect on his life outside of the song’s jail cell, too — and, writing in Chicken Soup for the Soul: Country Music, he made it clear that he hadn’t forgotten the green, green grass of Jackson County: “It’s pretty amazing that a simple country kid from the hills in Alabama could have done something that’s had such an impact on so many people’s lives.”"
