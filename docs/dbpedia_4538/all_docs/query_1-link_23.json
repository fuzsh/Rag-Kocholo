        "text": "Case44 makes a good point regarding the year 1972. I would have to look it up in some of my Billboard info books but if memory serves he did not have many, or even any, charts hits after that year.\n\nBut from 1964 to 1972 he generally had a song on the charts and usually top 20, his first one being his March of 1965 hit \"It's Not Unusual.\" And the hits rolled from there- \"Love Me Tonight,\" \"Delilah\", \"Daughter Of Darkness\",\"Love Me Tonight\", \"Thunderball\" (classic song) and lots of others.\n\nEven at the ripe old age of 70 whatever, he's still at it. I'm a Procol Harum fan and on their \"The Long Goodbye\" CD, released several years ago, he does the vocals on their hit \"Simple Sister\", which originally appears on Procol's Broken Barricades release, released in 1971. And he does a damn fine job on those vocals!\n\nLast edited by DOUBLE H; 11-13-2012 at 03:24 PM..\n\nTHE CARDIGANS AND TOM JONES : BURNING DOWN THE HOUSE (reversed video) - YouTube\n\nAs referenced before...in a very witty way...but way too short.\n\nThis should have been a 6 minute song!\n\nI, personally, like his later...actually modern work.\n\nHis way of 'interpreting different styles' works very well with modern songs."
