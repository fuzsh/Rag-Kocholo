Join your fellow alumni for a picnic at PW!

Foundation Day and the All Alumni Picnic will take place 11 a.m.-3 p.m. on Sunday, October 13 in the Plymouth Whitemarsh High School parking lot by the new gym. Visit the alumni seating area to meet up with friends from your class and the years surrounding it! Lunch can be purchased from food trucks.

Enjoy performances by the PWHS Cheerleaders and Marching Colonials, in addition to community groups. Plus, there will be activities for kids: bouncy houses, sports area, face painting, sand art, etc., available with the cost of a wristband.

Help us get an idea of how many people are coming, so we can have enough chairs and tables!
