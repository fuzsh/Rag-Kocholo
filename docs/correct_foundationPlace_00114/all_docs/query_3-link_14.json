        "text": "Google has announced that it has bought Picnik, one of the early online photo-editing sites, for an undisclosed sum. Picnik was started in Seattle in 2005, and now has a staff of 20. Part of its appeal is that it lets users edit their photos online then post them to social networking sites such as Facebook and MySpace. It uses a \"freemium\" model where the basic service is free and users are asked to subscribe for access to more advanced features.\n\nPicnik is the third company that Google has bought this year -- the others were search companies Aardvark and reMail -- and brings the total to more than 60, according to a list on Wikipedia. Its best acquisitions include Pyra Labs (Blogger), Picasa (photo album), Keyhole (Google Maps, Google Earth), Android (phone software), YouTube (video), JotSpot (web apps), DoubleClick (advertising) and FeedBurner. Somehow it missed Flickr.\n\nThe Official Google Blog says: \"We're not announcing any significant changes to Picnik today, though we'll be working hard on integration and new features. As well, we'd like to continue supporting all existing Picnik partners so that users will continue to be able to add their photos from other photo sharing sites, make edits in the cloud and then save and share to all relevant networks.\"\n\nPicnik's blog says: \"What does this mean for Picnik? It means we can think BIG. Google processes petabytes of data every day, and with their worldwide infrastructure and world-class team, it is truly the best home we could have found. Under the Google roof we'll reach more people than ever before, impacting more lives and making more photos more awesome.\"\n\nThe New York Times's Bits blog notes: \"This is not the first company that Picnik's chief executive, Jonathan Sposato, has sold to Google. His first sale was a product called Phatbits that became part of the Google Gadgets platform.\"\n\nI wrote about Picnik in the Netbytes column in January 2008, when it was both reasonably powerful and very easy to use. It's also in our list of 100 essential websites for 2010."
