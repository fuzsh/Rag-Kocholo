        "text": "South Coast Botanic Garden has always been an incredible spot to picnic. With 10 meadows and 87 acres of beautiful lush landscape, you can have an intimate picnic immersed in the Garden. But now we’re upping the ante. Our Special Events team helps design incredible weddings and events throughout the year, and now you can have them set up your next picnic with our new Bespoke Picnic program.\n\nPick from five picnic themes and let our team design a magical day for you and your guest(s). You can choose from Farmhouse near the Lavender Garden, Glamper on the Banyan Lawn, Parisian on the Amphitheater Lawn, Bohemian near Palm Garden, or eat on a literal work of art with our Artschwager theme located on our Hide and Seek sculpture One-on-One.\n\nOnce you arrive at the Garden, you’ll be greeted by a team member and provided a map for a scavenger hunt that leads you to your picnic location. There are some add-on options available that allow you to customize the picnic for your occasion, be it a date night, birthday, baby shower, bridal shower or simply a fun gathering of friends (your Bespoke Picnic can have up to 10 guests). This customizable picnic option helps you elevate your picnicking style while also allowing our team to take the stress off the planning.\n\nReady to reserve your picnic or want to learn more about the themes and add-ons? You’ll find everything you need here."
