From there, the trail continues along the coast with stunning views of coastal cliffs. About 1.25 miles from the picnic area, arrive at Kiʻilae Village. The Coastal Trail is sandy, but rapidly changes to lava rock as you approach the 1871 Trail Junction. Maps of this trail and the sites along it are available at the Visitor Center. Drinking water, sturdy footwear, and sun protection is recommened.\n\nTide Pools\n\nHidden within the lava rock beyond the Picnic Area are numerous tide pools, cracks and crevices for exploring.

Use caution when exploring as the lava rock can be slippery.\n\nRules & Regulations\n\nPlease help protect this area.
