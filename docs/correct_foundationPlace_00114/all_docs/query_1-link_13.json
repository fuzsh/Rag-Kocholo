        "text": "The Nashville Public Library Foundation’s Picnic with the Library took place Sunday, April 30 at the Downtown Nashville Public Library on Church Street.\n\nThe annual family-friendly fundraiser event featured face painting, a balloon artist, dinner, crafts, and a scavenger hunt. Funds raised go toward Nashville Public Library’s mentorship programs and early literacy initiatives.\n\nNashville Lifestyles sat down with the three couples chairing this year’s event: Julian and Amy Bryant, Robert and Kelsey Finger, and Jeremey and Sara Garner. (nplf.org)\n\nNashville Lifestyles: What made you want to chair this fundraising event for the Nashville Public Library Foundation?\n\nJulian and Amy Bryant: We enjoyed participating last year as a host family and were very interested in taking on a larger role to shape the event. We took particular interest in the Library Foundation’s desire to make the event more diverse.\n\nRobert and Kelsey Finger: We were also a host family last year and our kids thoroughly enjoyed the event. We wanted to be more involved in the planning process and had zero hesitation in saying yes to chairing.\n\nJeremy and Sara Garner: This event is a unique fundraiser because it is child-centric. Most often with nonprofit development the event and the cause can feel somewhat disconnected, but this event takes place within the walls of the institution for an age group its efforts target. It makes for a great day of family fun!\n\nNL: How are the funds raised from the event utilized?\n\nThe chairs: In its eighth year, the Picnic with the Library continues to support Nashville Public Library’s Wishing Chair Productions, story times, Puppet Trucks, mentorship programs, and early literacy initiatives reaching more than 100,000 children and their families.\n\nNL: Why do you think supporting the Nashville Public Library is important and why do you think it is vital to our community?\n\nThe Bryants: Reading and literacy are among the leading indicators for educational success. Anything we can do to promote positive learning is important to us.\n\nThe Fingers: There are very few things that are more important for a child’s future than literacy. The NPLF is working to close the gap in literacy within the Nashville community and shaping children’s futures and in turn, shaping the future of our community.\n\nNL: What in your background do you think most prepared you to chair an event of this magnitude?\n\nThe Fingers: We don’t have any formal training, but we love Nashville, we love our community, and we love our library. We feel truly honored to be involved in the library’s mission in this very small way.\n\nSara Garner: During my twenties, I co-chaired the late parties of several non-profit events. This event has a more casual and relaxed objective, but I wouldn’t necessarily call it easier—the number of attendees as well as the age demographic is a record and a first for me.\n\nNL: Regarding philanthropy, who in your life has influenced you the most? Julian Bryant: My grandfather was a faithful tither and gave an equal amount to other charitable organizations.\n\nAmy Bryant: My parents taught me to give my time and talent to the church and throughout the community. Both of our families taught us that to whom much is given, much is required.\n\nSara Garner: My dad has had the most influence on my perception of philanthropy. He has a very disciplined and algorithmic approach towards evaluating the potential impact of a gift.\n\nNL: What inspires you to use your time, talents, and treasure as a volunteer?\n\nThe Bryants: We enjoy serving the community. It is fun to give back, particularly to the youth. Additionally, we are helping to shape the Nashville community our children are living within."
