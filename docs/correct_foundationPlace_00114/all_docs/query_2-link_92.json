Dia Beacon's entrance is on the right, marked by a gray sign\n\nOccupying a former Nabisco box-printing factory on the banks of the Hudson River, Dia Beacon presents the majority of Dia’s collection of art from the 1960s to the present as well as special exhibitions, new commissions, and public and education programs. Since its opening in May 2003, Dia Beacon has helped transform the city of Beacon into a vibrant arts destination for visitors from the region, New York City, and beyond.\n\nArchitecture\n\nBuilt in 1929 by Nabisco, the nearly 300,000-square-foot factory building is composed of brick, steel, concrete, and glass and is considered a landmark of early-twentieth-century industrial architecture. It stands as a symbol of Beacon’s past as a major industrial and manufacturing city.\n\nThe original building had many key design elements that made it an appealing site for contemporary art, including broad spans between supporting columns and more than 34,000-square-feet of skylights. Today these skylights provide natural light in the galleries and have uniquely established Dia Beacon as a “daylight museum.”\n\nDia invited artist Robert Irwin to conceive the master plan for a twenty-first-century museum that retained the original character of the factory’s interior spaces. Irwin also designed seasonally changing gardens throughout the surrounding landscape. Following the renovation, Dia Beacon was added to the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nArt and Programs\n\nIn keeping with Dia’s history of single-artist, site-related presentations, each gallery was designed specifically for the installation of one artist’s work. This attentiveness to the work becomes tangible when traversing the spaces at Dia Beacon, which were renovated to display, for example, Dan Flavin’s “monuments” for V. Tatlin(1964–90), Richard Serra’s Torqued Ellipses (1996–2000), and Michael Heizer’s North, East, South, West (1967/2002).\n\nDia’s collections and special presentations are supplemented by public programs, tours, and an arts education partnership with the City of Beacon, underway since 2001."
