The luster of twilight provides the backdrop for al fresco style cocktails and a dinner of picnic fare using the finest local ingredients. The setting blends summer chic with rustic sophistication to create a truly memorable experience in the park for guests. This year's event will take place overlooking the Caren Glotfelty Meadow, celebrating its own special magic. The nights entertainment will be provided by Buffalo Rose, a wildly charismatic six-piece modern folk/Americana band from Pittsburgh, PA that take the singer-songwriter tradition to a new level by crafting original songs which are emotive, meticulously arranged, and inspired by a world of idiosyncratic influences that never let a dull or predictable moment creep in."
