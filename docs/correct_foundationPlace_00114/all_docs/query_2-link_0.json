These two signature events bring tens of thousands of people to Gateway Arch National Park and Kiener Plaza each year. They also support dozens of local businesses, artists and entrepreneurs and bring ample economic activity to Downtown.\n\nGateway Arch Park Foundation is also proud to host Sunrise Yoga, our weekly yoga series held in the heart of St. Louis - Kiener Plaza. This series is free and open to the public thanks to supporters like you."
