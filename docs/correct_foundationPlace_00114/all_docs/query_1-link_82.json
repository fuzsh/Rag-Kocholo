        "text": "The spacious parks of the Elmhurst Park District offer individuals and groups ideal sites for picnicking. Picnickers will enjoy the natural beauty of the parks as well as the conveniences and facilities provided in various picnic areas by the Park District.\n\nIndividual Sites\n\nMany parks in the Elmhurst Park District have areas designated for small group picnics. These individual picnic areas can accommodate a family or group of up to eight people. Usually, these picnic areas feature one permanent picnic table on a concrete pad and a nearby grill. Reservations are not taken for these picnic areas - they are available on a first-come, first served basis.\n\nSpecial Use Permits\n\nSpecial use permits are required for requesting use of a special activity or large-scale events (i.e. craft fair, parade, run/walk, concerts, events with tents/structures, etc.) Applications must be approved by the executive director. A non-refundable usage fee will be charged per priority use as well as a refundable security deposit. A certificate of insurance naming the Park District as additional insured must be on file before a permit is issued. Call (630) 993-8900 for detailed information. Download the Special Use Permit form. Email application to registrationepd.org (registration[at]epd[dot]org).\n\nLarge Group Picnics\n\nLarge group picnic areas are available at Berens Park, Salt Creek Park and Wilder Park. Large groups can be guaranteed exclusive use of designated picnic areas by making a request online or you can download and fill out the Picnic Permit Application. Email application to registrationepd.org (registration[at]epd[dot]org).\n\nIt may not be possible to place every group in the area of their choice because of scheduling conflicts between picnickers, park users and neighboring residents. District staff will work with your group to find a suitable area.\n\nSchool Picnics/Field Days\n\nElmhurst parks provide an excellent locale for school picnics, field days and special events. School Permits are available at no charge for those school groups residing within Elmhurst. The fee for non-resident schools is $50. Authorized name, signature and designation of both the applicant and a school official are necessary when completing the application. Applicable site plans and/or details should be included. A certificate of insurance naming the Elmhurst Park District as a “Certificate Holder” and “Additional Insured” must be attached. Completed forms may be emailed to registrationepd.org (registration[at]epd[dot]org).\n\nPicnic Permits and Fees\n\nEach year, requests for large group picnic permits for resident groups are accepted beginning the first business day in January. Applications will be accepted until 8 am on the third Monday in January and processed by random draw. Once this procedure is completed, resident requests will be processed daily in the order received. Requests can be made online or you can download and fill out the Picnic Permit Application. Email application to registrationepd.org (registration[at]epd[dot]org).\n\nRequests from non-resident groups will be accepted and processed beginning the first business day in February. Reservations are only available for large group picnics scheduled from mid-May until the end of October.\n\nPicnic Area Fees Resident Non-Resident Weekend/Holiday Shelters $111 $170 Weekday Shelters $45 $160 Weekend/Holiday Picnic Areas $89 $150 Weekday Picnic Area Free $140 Elmhurst Schools - Weekday Free N/A Non-Resident School Groups - Weekday N/A $50\n\nAll permits will require a $100 refundable deposit regardless of residence status. Refunds will be issued 5-7 business days after rental. Permit fees are charged for reserved picnics on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. Non-resident groups are charged the regular fee throughout the week and non-resident school groups will be charged $50 for each picnic site.\n\nTo receive the resident rate for the permit, the person applying for the permit must be an EPD resident and must be present at the picnic site. Non-resident groups are charged a slightly higher fee. A separate fee will be charged for the picnic shelter at Butterfield and Salt Creek Parks. Refunds will not be issued for cancellation, inclement weather, etc.\n\nPicnic Area Capacity\n\nThe Park District has established a picnic area carrying capacity for each group picnic area. This carrying capacity (see charts) is the approximate maximum number of picnickers which an area is able to accommodate and the appropriate number of tables, grills, and barrels that are placed in each picnic area. Each large group picnic site is located within walking distance to water and restrooms.\n\nLocation Area Capacity Tables Grills Barrels Restrooms Play Area Wilder Park Area #5 - Yellow 50 17 1 2 Yes Yes Wilder Park Area #6 - Blue 50 18 1 2 Yes Yes Wilder Park Area #7 - Green 50 24 1 2 Yes Yes Berens Park Area #4 - Red 35 19 0 2 Yes Yes Salt Creek Park Area #1 - Red 50 20 2 2 Yes Yes Salt Creek Park Shelter #3 - Green 150 39 2 5 Yes Yes Butterfield Park Shelter #9 - Red 40 10 1 3 Yes Yes\n\nPicnic Area Regulations\n\nApplications for resident large picnic group permits will be accepted the first business day in January.
