With the profits from their small businesses, women can invest in their families and communities.\n\nAspiring Artists of the Earth\n\nAspiring Artists of the Earth is a long-time supporter of our work to alleviate global poverty. This year, Masked Together, TZ Glass and Live to Uplift, join Aspiring Artists of the Earth to help fund microloans for women microentrepreneurs.\n\n“Working to alleviate global poverty aligns with our root mission of working to live to uplift and is a natural, inspired cause for us to support.

Whether it be through speaking engagements, fundraisers, or strategic partnerships with similarly aligned companies, [Coolhaus strives] to empower women, make confident leaders out of girls, and encourage community-building.”\n\n“As a woman-founded and led company we strive to support and elevate other women and minority entrepreneurs.

This December, MAGICdATES will support more women-owned businesses through the work of Whole Planet Foundation’s microlending programs.\n\n“Growing up, my mom brought us around the dinner table every night.

Sadly, the reality is that only 4% of venture capital and 2% of private equity goes towards women-founded businesses, despite ample field studies that women-led companies yield superior results to their male-led counterparts. We are thrilled to partner with Whole Planet Foundation to empower women throughout this country with microloans to help them with their endeavors. We are proud to champion women in business and look forward to seeing their success in the near future!” says Founder and CEO of nutpods, Madeline Haydon, pictured below.\n\n“Since the inception of our company in 2013, we have had a commitment to paying it forward by donating our time, product, and funds to worthy causes and continually looking for new ways to reduce our environmental footprint.

Each trip included a visit to groups of women, in rural villages, who are receiving microloans from Whole Planet Foundation’s India partner CASHPOR Micro Credit. These microloans are used to purchase various items to start their own businesses, such as goats, or weaving materials, and enable each woman to create an opportunity that would otherwise not be available to her,” says Amy K Wright, creator and CEO of Tell it Well Greeting Cards.\n\n“On average, most of these women are living on less than $2 a day, and this level of poverty prohibits them from gaining access to a loan from a traditional bank. To put it very simply… a microloan = hope and this hope offers a practical way to become an equal business partner with her husband; to feed and clothe her children and gain access to education – many of the basics in my life that I take for granted. I am profoundly changed by my experience of meeting these vibrant and beautiful women in India, who are being empowered to change their own lives, and that is why I am committed to supporting the Whole Planet Foundation.”\n\nVital Farms\n\n“For over 15 years, Whole Planet Foundation has done incredible work around the world aimed at alleviating global poverty. Vital Farms first connected with WPF 10 years ago through our relationship with Whole Foods Market. We have since built a longstanding relationship with the WPF team, inspired by our shared commitment to community and support the budding entrepreneurial spirit, and we are honored to support the Holiday Scanback Program and contribute to the Foundation’s incredible work to create opportunities for women entrepreneurs around the world,” says the team from Vital Farms."
