        "text": "Welcome to This is the Place Heritage Park\n\nThis Is The Place Heritage Park is comprised of 450-acres and preserves the story of those who settled the western territory. For nearly a century, great efforts have been made to honor the memory of the intrepid settlers and those who came before them. There are over 60 original or replica structures in the Village today and together with costumed interpreters, the epic story of the west is told.\n\nA visit to The Park opens the door for guests to disconnect from the modern world. They can ride one of four trains around the Park, see farm animals, ride ponies and pan for gold. The Native American Village celebrates Utah’s first people and shares Native Culture through storytelling, dance and traditional activities. Pioneer trades keep centuries-old skills alive throughout the historic Village with interactive demonstrations. The Pioneer Children’s Memorial pays tribute to the hundreds of young pioneers who never made it to the Salt Lake Valley and were buried along the way. Seventeen large stones are engraved with over six hundred names of each known child.\n\nThe future of This Is The Place is anchored securely in the preservation of the past. The Park is open year-round and is one of Utah’s treasured historical places paying tribute to the Pioneer Spirit that is Utah and its people!\n\nThis Is The Place Foundation, a nonprofit organization, manages the park.
