        "text": "As Luck would have it... we’re bringing Willie Nelson’s annual 4th of July Picnic to the people this year; part Picnics past, part what’s to come, and all in the spirit of the Picnic’s storied history. On July 4th, starting at 3:30 pm Central, fans will be able to enjoy interviews with characters from the Picnic’s past, and see new, live performances from their favorite Luck Family artists.\n\nThis year, Luck Productions was set to host the 47th annual event, welcoming the Picnic back to its hill country home. While the droves of sweaty Texas hippies and extended family members—blood kin and musicians alike—won’t be crowding into Willie’s Luck, TX, ranch this summer, the man himself will be performing alongside his band from his nearby recording facility, Pedernales Studios. In addition to Willie, performers will include the likes of Sheryl Crow, Ziggy Marley, Margo Price, Steve Earle, and Kurt Vile. A full list of confirmed performers can be found below. Tickets for digital admission are $35 ahead of the event and $45 day-of-show and can be purchased www.williepicnic.com.\n\nThis July 4th, the Picnic will kick off with a Prime Cuts episode with Chef Scott Roberts of Salt Lick BBQ and special guest Ray Benson, followed by live-streamed performances from Luck’s Saloon and Chapel stages before leading into a 90-minute concert film segment. The film will feature remote performances from Picnic artists, an all-star house band curated by The Texas Gentlemen’s Beau Bedford (featuring Charlie Sexton, John Michael Schoepf, and Josh Blue), and interviews and Picnic memories stitched in throughout. Additionally, SiriusXM’s Willie’s Roadhouse will broadcast the 90-minute stream to subscribers.\n\nTickets to the event grant access to highly curated food and beverage delivery packages from Assembly Kitchen, Austin Food and Wine Alliance grant recipients, and Sourced Craft Cocktails.\n\nOne dollar from each ticket sold will support The Luck Reunion Fund, managed by the Austin Community Foundation, directly benefiting five designated organizations. Budweiser, Michelob Ultra, and Karbach Love Street will also be matching donations. Beneficiaries for this event include All Together ATX, Six Square, Health Alliance for Austin Musicians, SIMS Foundation, and Central Texas Foodbank.\n\n“Our goal with the 2020 Picnic is to bring it back to what it was—in the only way we can during these times. We were set to host this year's event at Luck, to welcome the Picnic back to its hill country home,” says Ellee Fletcher Durniak, co-founder of Luck Productions. “The Picnic is really one of a kind, it has always been scrappy. Cars on fire. Mass arrests. You name it...it happened at the Picnic.”\n\nWhat: Willie Nelson’s 4th of July Picnic concert film experience and live stream\n\nWhen: July 4th, 2020 at 3:30 pm Central\n\nWhere: www.luck.stream and www.williepicnic.com\n\nHow: Tickets can be purchased here; $35 pre-event, $45 day of show\n\nWho: Willie Nelson & Family\n\nAsleep At The Wheel\n\nCharley Crockett\n\nDevon Gilfillian\n\nJohn Doe\n\nJohnny Bush\n\nKinky Friedman\n\nKurt Vile\n\nLukas Nelson & Promise of the Real\n\nLyle Lovett\n\nMargo Price\n\nMatthew Houck (Phosphorescent)\n\nThe McCrary Sisters\n\nParticle Kid\n\nRandy Rogers & Wade Bowen\n\nRay Wylie Hubbard\n\nRobert Earl Keen\n\nShakey Graves\n\nSheryl Crow\n\nSteve Earle\n\nThe Peterson Brothers\n\nVincent Neil Emerson\n\nZiggy Marley"
