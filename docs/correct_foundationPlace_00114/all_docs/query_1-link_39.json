        "text": "Join our recent campaign and contribute towards picnic tables for the four elementary schools and the Middle School!\n\nThe NHEF has placed three picnic tables at each of the elementary schools and two at the Middle School. Each set of tables includes an ADA-compliant one. Outdoor learning can take place more readily with these tables and classes may have opportunities to eat their snacks and/or lunches outdoors as well. Staff will also reap the benefits of being able to take a break outdoors for lunch or possibly even have meetings at these tables.\n\nPlease reach out to us if you would like to sponsor a table or contribute towards one. We will be announcing a dedication event in the spring to thank our sponsors.\n\nCommunity-sponsored tables will be labeled with steel, donor recognition plaques to perpetually recognize your contribution.\n\nThe Foundation encourages our community businesses to consider sponsoring a table as a gift to our students and schools.\n\nTotal cost per table, including shipping and tax is $1,000\n\nDonations of $500 or more will be recognized on a plaque\n\nWe will contact you for your recognition plate proof.\n\nPurchase a table now using the DONATE button below! Be sure to note your business name in the comments section."
