Each trip included a visit to groups of women, in rural villages, who are receiving microloans from Whole Planet Foundation’s India partner CASHPOR Micro Credit,” says Amy K Wright, creator and CEO of Tell it Well Greeting Cards.\n\n“These microloans are used to purchase assorted items to start their own businesses, such as goats, or weaving materials, and enable each woman to create an opportunity that would otherwise not be available to her. On average, most of these women are living on less than $2 a day, and this level of poverty prohibits them from gaining access to a loan from a traditional bank. To put it very simply… a microloan = hope and this hope offers a practical way to become an equal business partner with her husband; to feed and clothe her children and gain access to education – many of the basics in my life that I take for granted. I am profoundly changed by my experience of meeting these vibrant and beautiful women in India, who are being empowered to change their own lives, and that is why I am committed to supporting Whole Planet Foundation.”\n\nFrom December 1 – 31, 2021, $0.10 from the sale of Tell It Well greeting cards in select Whole Foods Market stores will be donated to fund microloans to empower the world’s poorest entrepreneurs in communities where Whole Foods Market sources products.\n\nThe Republic of Tea\n\nSince 2012, The Republic of Tea has helped create opportunities for microentrepreneurs around the globe living in poverty through their meaningful support of Whole Planet Foundation.\n\nVisit The Republic of Tea’s website for festive tea gift sets for the tea lover in your life this holiday season!\n\nFrom December 1-31, 2021, $0.50 from the sale of The Republic of Tea’s Organic Holiday Chai in select Whole Foods Market stores will be donated to fund microloans to empower the world’s poorest entrepreneurs in communities where Whole Foods Market sources products.\n\nVital Farms\n\nA longtime annual $10,000 Fund donor, Vital Farms has worked with Whole Planet Foundation for several years, supporting microlending programs in the U.S. and around the world.
