The foundation says they will still be hosting their 50/50 raffle, but doing so online this year.\n\n\"There will also be the Good Day Show, which is actually a CHTV hospital closed-circuit hospital show that runs every day in the hospital. We are going to do a special episode of that so kids outside the hospital can see what kids inside the hospital can see.\"\n\nThe virtual event will also be sharing with families ways they can create a healthy picnic at home."
