I hand-delivered it myself, wrapped in paper packages tied up with strings. Some of the very first items I made were the quirky-sleeved tees my label is best known for today.\n\nWhile I can’t say I’m a startup anymore, each stage of growth is a new experience. National Picnic attracts fans who appreciate its USA-sewn, slow fashion philosophy as much as I enjoy delivering it.\n\nNational Picnic is a locally made brand at heart—we can ship anywhere, but customers still love to know where their clothing comes from. It feels good to say “we” more and more, as I now share the workload with more staff and vendors local to the Philadelphia region.\n\nNational Picnic balances function and fun. Everyone needs \"core\" casual pieces. We love sewing those as the foundation of our collection. But we are playful, too, choosing conversation-worthy prints for small batches of clothing that are so limited, you can consider them rare and collectible. They’re all designed for longevity—classic styles made from quality materials, things you’ll want to keep wearing again and again.\n\nThanks for browsing National Picnic. I hope to dress you soon!\n\n——————\n\nTopics: Slow Fashion, Ethical Production, Manufacturing, Small Business, Women Owned Businesses, Fashion Design, Indie Brands"
