        "text": "The Foundation is assisting with the school’s most recent campus improvement initiative to place picnic tables across campus, including within building courtyards and in front of the cafeteria and gym. “The students need places to sit, hang out, do homework,” Principal Yap expressed at a Foundation meeting in April. “Whether it’s during school, or after school when they’re waiting for practice. We want to get more tables and benches on our campus.”\n\nA handful of blue, heavy-duty, steel with a thermo-plastic finish picnic tables have already been placed on campus. With support from the Maui High community, the Maui High School Foundation would like to help the school bring in more to accommodate Maui High’s vast campus and large student body.\n\nCommunity-funded tables will be labeled with donor recognition plates to perpetually recognize contributions of $300 or more that are made toward this collaborative project. The Foundation encourages Maui High alumni classes to consider sponsoring a table as a class gift. Total cost per table, including shipping, handling, and tax is $1400.\n\nTo further establish this project as a shared effort, the school has committed to match the number of tables the Foundation is able to sponsor.\n\nInterested in supporting this project?
