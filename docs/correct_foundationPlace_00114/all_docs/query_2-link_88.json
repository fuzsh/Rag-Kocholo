        "text": "Discover the Benefits of Nature While Picnicking\n\nGet an extra dose of vitamin N (nature) and relax with family and friends as you picnic at one of our parks. Whether you’re visiting with your family or want to host a larger corporate function, our conservation areas have a place for you.\n\nChoose from open space, a shady nook or waterfront view to enjoy an impromptu picnic. Groups of 20 or more should plan ahead and make a reservation.\n\n2024 Picnic Bookings\n\nPicnic reservations are now open for the 2024 summer season. Reservations can be made for dates between May 4 and October 27, 2024.\n\nOur Picnicking Locations\n\nIsland Lake has six reservable picnic areas or pavilions. Sites vary in size and we can accommodate up to 500 guests, making Island Lake a great option for family get-togethers, company picnics or birthday celebrations. Individual tables are scattered throughout the park for small groups and spontaneous meals.\n\nBook a picnic\n\nLearn more about Island Lake Conservation Area.\n\nTerra Cotta has six reservable picnic sites and pavilions available. Sites can accommodate up to 400 guests and let you take in the sounds of nature in the heart of the Niagara Escarpment. Individual tables are located near the Park Store and washrooms for small groups and unexpected visits.\n\nBook a picnic\n\nLearn more about Terra Cotta Conservation Area.\n\nKen Whillans offers individual picnic tables located around the ponds for small picnics. Take in the water view or cast a fishing line while you enjoy your packed lunch.\n\nPicnic tables are available first-come first served.\n\nLearn more about Ken Whillans Conservation Area.\n\nPhoto Gallery\n\nPicnicking Etiquette\n\nReduce Your Waste\n\nUse reusable, compostable, biodegradable or recyclable containers. Hot/cold drink bottles are for sale at Terra Cotta and Island Lake Conservation Areas.\n\nDon’t package fresh fruit –it “wraps” itself.\n\nChoose washable, reusable cloth napkins and tablecloths.\n\nSkip the individually packaged drinks. Choose drinks in jugs or coolers to share.\n\nUse a canvas bag or other reusable totes for your food and picnic supplies.\n\nThrow any unwanted items in the proper bins.\n\nTake leftovers home to enjoy later.\n\nAppreciate Nature\n\nProtect habitat. Our parks are home to nesting birds, native plants, and other species that are easily trampled.\n\nMake sure your children and pets stay on trails and in open spaces.\n\nObserve and learn. Take field guides, binoculars, even a nature journal to learn about wildlife and habitat. Start a fun “life list” of species you see.\n\nUse natural bug repellant and sunscreen. They’re less toxic for your family and safer for nature.\n\nCarpool. You’ll reduce emissions and save on park admission!\n\nManage Your Impact\n\nOnsite recycling includes plastic and glass bottles and aluminum cans.\n\nDon’t contaminate recycling bins. All contaminated recycling ends up in the landfill.\n\nBreak down large cardboard, and leave it stacked beside recycling bins.\n\nAll types of coffee cups and lids, as well as Styrofoam containers are not recyclable and belong in the garbage can. Use reusable container instead.\n\nReduce your noise footprint, be courteous to those picnicking around you and limit your use of amplified sound. Restrictions apply.\n\nPicnics with a reservation at Island Lake Conservation Area will also have access to compost bins. We provide signage on what is acceptable onsite.\n\nRead the full Visitor Rules for our parks.\n\nSee Also\n\nVisitor Rules\n\nParks FAQ"
