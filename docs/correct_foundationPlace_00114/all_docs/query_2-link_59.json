Dogs must be 4 months or older. Dogs must be on a leash in all other areas of Lake Elmo State Park.\n\nThe park is 123 acres in size and at an elevation of 3,199 feet.\n\nAction Trackchair all-terrain wheelchair available for reservation\n\nFWP is enhancing the inclusive and welcoming environment for all at Lake Elmo with the new Action Trackchair, an all-terrain wheelchair designed to empower individuals of all abilities to explore the state park.
