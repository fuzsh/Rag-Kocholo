It was built in 1945 to commemorate the 80th birthday of Jean Sibelius, the father of Finnish music. Sibelius Park is also a good place for leisure and relaxation. The park is lined with green trees, and it is even more refreshing under the blue sky and white clouds. The park is adjacent to the Gulf of Finland. At sunset, you can go to the port to sit for a while, watch the ships docked at the port, the golden sunset, listen to the melodious music of street performers, and feel the leisure time.\n\nÔïê\n\nFeatured Accommodation Near Sibelius Park\n\n1 .

Located in the middle of a small but beautiful park, recommended to stop here for a while and enjoy the relaxing atmosphere. It‚Äôs a nice, short walk though. It's a beautiful metal sculpture that would have you awestrucked. #helsinki #finland #couplestrip\n\nMel22\n\nÔñ™11\n\nÔïë\n\nNordic Three Countries||Finland-Sweden-Norway Ten Day Laser Travel\n\n||Finland-Sweden-Norway Ten Day Laser Travel.

With the increase of age, there are new ideas about travel. Unlike before, the itinerary is full of activities every day. Now, although there is a plan, there is more freedom to appreciate the unexpected beauty. In winter Helsinki, the day doesn't brighten until after 9:30 am, so you can enjoy a leisurely breakfast in the hotel before going out to play. It's very pleasant to dine by the window and enjoy the scenery outside. üöâTransportation guide: All preparations are ready to go to Sibelius Park. It only takes a 100-meter walk from the hotel to the bus stop. Considering that other attractions are within walking distance, we only bought a 90-minute ticket for the AB zone. After taking bus 43 for 3 stops and getting off, walk straight ahead at the traffic lights, turn left, and go straight to the end to reach Sibelius Park. üåüHighlight features: This park was built in memory of Finland's great musician Sibelius. There are two sculptures in the park, one is a portrait of the master Sibelius, and the other is a sculpture similar to an organ made up of 600 steel pipes. It is estimated that this is a must-visit place in Helsinki. Several waves of tour groups came one after another, and too many tourists rushed to the lakeside. After walking along the lakeside for a while, you can sit on a leisure chair and enjoy the swans. Rest for a while and take advantage of the fact that the ticket is still valid for 90 minutes to visit the Rock Church (Temppeliaukio Church). ‚úÖMust experience: The Rock Church requires a ticket, which costs 3 euros for an adult. The entire church was built by excavating and constructing inside the rock, giving it a rustic and primitive appearance. The top of the church is designed very cleverly, using glass to allow better light transmission, and the sound of the organ playing inside the church becomes surround sound when combined with the glass roof. üóìItinerary arrangement: Coming out of the Rock Church and continuing to walk for a while, you will soon arrive at the Kamppi Chapel of Silence, which looks like a big wooden barrel. This is a completely wooden structure and very novel. There is an inconspicuous small door on the left side of the big wooden barrel, which does not require a ticket but photography is strictly prohibited throughout the visit. As expected, it is a Chapel of Silence. As soon as you enter, you will be infected by the entire space and can't help but walk lightly. The quiet space forms a sharp contrast with the noisy city center outside. Walking out of the silent church, the building on the left side caught my curiosity üòª After looking at it for a while, I still don't know what it's for, but the children jumping up and down around it seem to be having a lot of fun.\n\n@byss@l_R3m1x3r\n\nÔñ™\n\nÔï£\n\nAlso Popular With Visitors to Sibelius Park\n\n1 .
