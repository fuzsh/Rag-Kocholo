Developed by Chef’n, a Seattle-based company with more than 30 years of product design experience, each highly functional bottle has curated combination of colors, materials, and finishes. With d.still, you can look good, feel good, and give back with every sip (to Water.org).\n\nPicnik\n\nVibrant food is what keeps us nourished, satiated, and alive. Sadly, our world has slowly transitioned to a time where the people are hard-pressed for the time to properly prepare vibrant foods, and the food and drink we consume daily on the go is making us sick. Our food system has failed us, and we believe it’s time for us to shift the paradigm of ‘fast food’ everywhere. At Picnik, we offer the practical, convenient setting of a restaurant and coffee shop with a focus on better ingredients that make you feel and perform your best. Our menu items and the bottled coffees we sell are convenient and made with the highest quality ingredients. We accommodate a wide spectrum of food allergies, sensitivities, and dietary requirements, so that everyone is included.\n\nVeggie Noodle Co.\n\nFounded by Mason Arnold in an effort to bring healthy food to his gluten-free family, Veggie Noodle Co. isn’t just a fun start-up business. It’s the next step in Mason’s journey to innovate with sustainability. Mason also founded Greenling, an award-winning local and organic food delivery service all over Texas. From his chemical engineering background to the organic practices legislation he’s helped pass, Mason has been a Veggie Nerd for a long time. For Mason, it’s all about inspiring others to get their nutrients in and to be creative with a healthy pasta alternative. And he knows the value in keeping it simple. Simple but twisted.®\n\nTWRC Wildlife Center\n\nSince our founding in 1979, we have had over 145,000 injured, orphaned, or ill wild animals pass through the hands of our caring volunteers. Species we frequently accept are squirrels, opossums, rabbits, raccoons, birds of prey, waterfowl, migratory birds, turtles, and snakes. With fixed accommodations for wildlife, we must also regulate the number of non-native, invasive species we receive for care, giving priority placement to our native species. We are not able to care for the large amounts of these species we receive each year without tremendous impact to the care of our native species.\n\nClementine and Co.\n\nThe basis of everything we make here at Clementine & Co. is great design. The materials have to stand the tests of time, sweat, water, kids, yoga practice, backpacking, in short, LIFE. Our pieces are physical medicine, modern-day talismans and a connection with the earth that nurtures and supports us. We honor that connection by sourcing recycled metals, ethical stones, and employing practices which limit or eliminate our environmental impact. We honor and value the work of human hands; after all, the hand of the maker can never be replicated and it is the handmade nature of our jewelry that truly sets it apart from all others. Every piece of jewelry we sell is made in-house in our Austin, TX studio by a highly-skilled and well-paid maven of the metal arts.\n\nStinky Yogi\n\nAt the helm of our essential oil activation, Stinky Yogi was founded in 2012 by Yoga Teacher Stacey Orr, a west coast native now based in Ithaca, NY.

Stinky’s mission is simple and genuine: to help people feel elevated through the magic of essential oils. We are a small, woman/yogi owned and operated company. Our products are made by hand in small batches by our team of yogis in PA and NY. We love our tribe and believe deeply in the power of community, connection, and being part of the mindful movement.\n\nWolven Threads\n\nWolven Threads fabric patterns are inspired by sacred geometry found all around us in nature.The vibrant colors of our garments are inspired by the colors of Indian art, celebration and the roots of yoga. We believe that mother nature is our home and that we should do whatever we can in our power to protect her. We believe that beautiful fashion should not come at the expense of our planet. Our garments are made with OEKO-TEX certified Recycled P.E.T fabric (RPET), a fabric made from recycled plastic water bottles. This certification ensures that our material is free of harmful and toxic chemicals.\n\nCitizens’ Environmental Coalition\n\nOur vision is an environmental community recognized as a vital part of the fabric of our society. We connect concerned citizens and community leaders with over 100 diverse environmental organizations. We share, support, and enhance their efforts and environmental advocates. We do this through our programs, which include forums that enhance understanding and publications that give a balanced perspective on environmental issues.\n\nDirty Blondes\n\nDirty Blondes is a clothing line that was designed for the free-spirited, fashion-forward girl that is confident in her own skin.The brand is based on the mantra of embracing a woman’s individual style.
