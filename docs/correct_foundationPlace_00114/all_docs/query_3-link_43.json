        "text": "A big thank you to everyone who has supported me on the ALS City Swim this Sunday. Like always, an incredibly well organised event with ALS patients in the center of attention. Our team has raised 33k, 1.8M has been raised by the event so far! My cousin Olivier Voûte welcomed all of us directly after the finish and invited 100+ friends, family and colleagues afterwards for a fantastic dinner & party, truly amazing! Equally inspiring to see Floor Elshout particpate for her father Robbert Elshout. Long term funding like this enable researchers to develop more and more therapies/trials that can help change the lives of ALS patients, so THANK YOU!\n\nNext weekend I will participate in the Amsterdam City Swim to raise funding for ALS research. To eradicate chronic deases like ALS and MS, we need the best academic talents, strong research programs and significant funding. Have participated multiple times, I am extra motivated for this year's event as both my cousin Olivier Voûte and our dear friend Robbert Elshout suffer from ALS. So please support them and donate to our team! https://lnkd.in/eJPhHq3u"
