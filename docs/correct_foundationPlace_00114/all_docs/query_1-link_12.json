        "text": "Throughout Grandfather Mountain’s history, picnicking has long been a favorite past time for visitors looking to create lasting memories with their friends and loved ones over a meal in the outdoors.\n\nGrandfather Mountain has around a dozen picnic areas in the park. These sites are located in some of the mountain’s most picturesque settings, including within the forested Woods Walk area and by overlooks that provide dramatic views of the surrounding mountains. Some even offer glimpses of our resident animals in their natural habitat.\n\nGuests are welcome to bring their meals and utilize the numerous charcoal grills that accompany our most popular picnic sites. Food is also available at Mildred’s Grill, which guests can order to-go and enjoy at one of our many scenic picnic settings.\n\nAdditionally, be sure to check the park’s weather for the day and dress appropriately. Even guests who visit on warm July days may need a jacket when venturing toward the mountain’s lofty heights.\n\nLeave No Trace\n\nAs a UNESCO International Biosphere Preserve, Grandfather Mountain is one of the most biologically significant nature parks in the world and home to more than 70 threatened or endangered species. We ask our guests to be mindful of this unique ecosystem when dining in the outdoors and to throw away or pack-out all of their trash when finished utilizing the park’s picnic areas.\n\nBear-proof trash containers are located at our most popular picnicking destinations. However, these containers are not at every single picnic table in the park. We ask guests to kindly pack out all of their trash if they use one of these picnic sites and to utilize the nearest trash container. Moreover, if guests utilize one of the park’s on-site grills, they must completely extinguish their coals and fire before leaving the picnic site.\n\nGrandfather Mountain is one of the windiest locations on the east coast. Help ensure the park stays litter-free by securing your belongings and items when utilizing one of the parks’ picnic sites.\n\nPopular Picnic Spots as You Drive Up Grandfather Mountain\n\nMacRae Meadows: A few picnic tables sit upon a small hillside overlooking MacRae Meadows, the site of the annual Grandfather Mountain Highland Games.
