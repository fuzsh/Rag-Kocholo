        "text": "With generous support from the Koret Foundation, the playground underwent a major renovation and reopened in 2007 as the Koret Children’s Quarter. New features include a climbing wall shaped like waves and a rope climbing structure; the historic concrete slide was retained.\n\nHERSCHEL-SPILLMAN CAROUSEL\n\nThree carousels have been housed in Golden Gate Park near the Koret Children’s Quarter since the playground opened. The current carousel was built in 1914 by the Herschell-Spillman Company and operated at amusement parks in Los Angeles and Portland, Oregon, before it was installed in Golden Gate Park in 1940 after a stint at the World’s Fair on Treasure Island. It was shut down in 1977 and restored, reopening in 1984. The carousel’s 62 colorfully painted menagerie animals include a dragon, camel, and goat as well as horses, frogs, dogs, roosters, and pigs. Painted panels inside the carousel depict Bay Area landscapes.\n\nTo reserve the picnic area adjacent to the carousel and playground, visit our Permits and Reservations page.\n\nHours of Operation\n\nCarousel hours vary, depending on weather, school schedules and season. Please call (415) 231-0077 to hear an updated message regarding the current status and schedule of the Carousel.\n\nCost\n\nAdults, $2; children ages 6 to 12 years, $1 per ride; children 5 and under free if accompanied by a paying adult. Children under 40? in height must be accompanied by a paying adult.\n\nLocation\n\n320 Bowling Green Drive, between John F. Kennedy Drive and Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, adjacent to the Koret Children’s Quarter (playground) by the Sharon Building.\n\nParking"
