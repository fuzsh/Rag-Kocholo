This was shot a couple days after the actual sand castle/sculpture competition. They leave them up for viewing for about a week or so, depending on the weather. If you look at the original size you will see the castles from the back. The sculptors do all sides. The high rises are fairly new, and I have always loved the architecture. It is a massive collection of housing units, but done with aesthetics in mind. The stepping also allows for more units to have the spectacular view that is out those windows.\n\nIt also reminds me of the way a Pueblo communities are done. I am sure the architects had that in mind when they were designing it. It is a needed structure that looks very nice in its surroundings.\n\n______________________\n\nqwikLoadr™ Videos....\n\nDeteriorata | Fluke of the Universe • YouTube™\n\nIron Butterfly | In a Gada Da Vida Live! • YouTube™\n\n@ 2:04 of the first video... \"remember the Pueblo\"… sometimes referred to as an Adobe structure.\n\n.\n\nqwikLoadr™ Videos...\n\nEmerson, Lake & Palmer | Lucky Man Montreux Live! • YouTube™\n\nThis may be it for awhile. flickr messed up the sizes in over 15,000 of my images over last weekend. I have no way of fixing this mistake, and I don't know if flickr can. If they do and mess up the static links I will lose work of over 5 years. That is something I wish not to think of. They completely broke my GrfxDziner account too.\n\nI posted in the help forum:\n\nwww.flickr.com/help/forum/en-us/72157625263928740/#reply7...\n\nThe first time they broke 12,000 links which took me 5 weeks to fix them all. Two weeks after that they broke almost 10,000 more, which took the entire month of September for me to fix. Once I fixed them, they said they rewrote code to fix them, which they did not, because there are two I left in the comments below. Still broken.\n\nI use facebook, and you can find me there:\n\nwww.facebook.com/GrfxDziner\n\nThank you to all my friends here for the many years, It has been wonderful interacting with you. I hope to find a better site to share my things with others. I wish this site here worked better as all my time has been invested here.

My friend's sister had her boyfriend make them for Katherine....they sold them to raise money for the reward. Note: it never got larger....and in 2012 I was told the money was all gone from the bank....and the person made new account on flickr and commented in the cover shot in comment.

There are all kinds of interesting photos and videos included. It is something John F. Kennedy had always dreamed was possible.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\ncheck out this blog too from the\n\nDeanna Cremin Memorial Foundation:\n\nBlogger gwennie2006 | the Butterfly & Pueblo....\n\ngwennie2006.blogspot.com/2010/10/butterfly-pueblo.html\n\nThe above image was edited using Picnik™...\n\nsee my first comment for a description of the editing.\n\n.\n\nqwikLoadr™ Videos...\n\nChili Peppers | Can't Stop Official • Vimeo™\n\nGreen Day | Time of Your Life Live! • YouTube™\n\nThis is one of the sandcastles I am working on. I wanted to add this as available to anyone that wished to work on it. I do have many more as well, and I will have them available when I get some of my edits done. This one second place at the Festival.\n\nI know the horizon is way off, as I was going for only the sculpture. I only have the sand bleed off on the left side, but I think I will add to it on the right. It is a little underexposed too, which I like for the castle shots. I seem to get the textures better that way. I shot these with a point and shoot camera too.\n\nHere are some others too if you want to play around with them...\n\nwww.flickriver.com/photos/tags/castleSun2"
