        "text": "While even the most fervent of foodies typically makes do with a purely utilitarian morning meal of cold cereal or toast, we’re here to argue for the expansive sit-down breakfast, a festival of fluffy pancakes, towering waffles, savory eggs and perennially flowing coffee. Whether you’re tucking into a plate at the best diners in America, the best coffee shops in America or the best donut shops in America, treat yourself to a proper start-of-day meal at these spots serving the best breakfast in America.

Sqirl in Los Angeles\n\nWhat started as a preserves company is now one of LA’s most coveted eateries: Sqirl, a small nook of a restaurant that serves breakfast and lunch made with farm-fresh ingredients. Chef Jessica Koslow is still churning out jams, but this time you can spread it on thick cuts of brioche toast with Sqirl’s house ricotta. If you’re not ordering toast here, you’re probably opting for one of the rice bowls, filled to the brim with seasonal flourishes such as sorrel pesto and radishes, sheep’s-milk and feta cheeses, plus a poached egg and juicy house sausage. There will be a line, but it’s well worth the wait (as will be Sqirl Away, no doubt — Koslow’s upcoming second venue, set to open next door).\n\n2. Russ & Daughters Cafe in New York\n\nThe heralded lox emporium — a Lower East Side staple since 1914 — serves old-world standbys like borscht, smoked-fish platters and egg creams at its nearby full-service restaurant. At breakfast, chow down on appetizing classics such as smoked fish-loaded bagels, plus potato latkes nestled with soft poached eggs.\n\n3. Tartine Manufactory in San Francisco\n\nChad Robertson and Elisabeth Prueitt of Tartine Bakery launched this roomy, 5,000-square-foot eatery in the Heath Ceramics complex in fall 2016. True to the Tartine brand, the pastry case is packed with over a dozen sweet and savory choices, including a fontina, herb and pepperoni biscuit and a preserved lemon pie with kale and Moroccan spices. The bready breakfast fare includes two egg sandwiches (on a griddled English muffin with Cabot cheddar, or a toasted bun with porchetta and salsa verde) as well as a range of fancy toasts, with toppings like coddled egg, trout roe, nduja and stracciatella.\n\n4. High Street on Market in Philadelphia\n\nArtisanal breads, like anadama miche, not to mention perfectly flaky croissants, are the foundation upon which chef Eli Kulp builds edgy, award-winning menus for this Old City favorite. Think beet-cured salmon with cream cheese and fried capers on perfectly crisp-chewy toast, or go for broke with the Hickory Town breakfast sammie, which stacks Lancaster bologna, horseradish-spiked Amish cheddar and a runny farm egg on a homemade kaiser roll.\n\n5. Paperboy in Austin\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BW78sdnlGM8/\n\nAustinites’ patience for standing in line is legendary, but the wait at most brunch spots is still nothing compared to other hip avocado-toast outposts of Portland and Brooklyn. Paperboy’s giving them a run for their money, with a long but totally-worth-it wait that holds rewards like a pimento cheese B.E.C. on brioche and potato hash shot through with unctuous pulled pork. The half-step away from traditional brunch fare manages to be both casual (you are in a dirt lot, after all) and elevated\n\n— there are few other places in town where pickled carrots and shaved radishes sneak their way into breakfast. Check out the second location on the patio of Radio Coffee & Beer.\n\n6. The Publican in Chicago\n\nNow under the talented Cosmo Goss, Paul Kahan’s Publican is still as relevant as it was when it opened in 2008. It boasts a fantastic beer list, packed with Belgian and local brews; a menu that equally celebrates meat, seafood and veggies; and the best brunch in town, served Saturdays and Sundays. Stylish, wide-ranging options span a raw bar packed with pristine oysters; indulgent French toast piled high with snowy whipped cream; and chickpea and chorizo stew crowned with a slow-cooked egg.\n\n7. Brennan’s in New Orleans\n\n“If you haven’t had breakfast at Brennan’s, you haven’t really been to New Orleans at all,” wrote novelist Peter S. Feibleman in 1971. Since 1946, like-minded breakfasters have arrived at the pink-painted French Quarter institution starting 8am for ageless indulgences like bourbon milk punch, crab omelets and Creole crepes. The restaurant relaunched with chef Slade Rushing in November 2014, after which he was promptly nominated for a James Beard Award. In addition to its timeless a la carte, Brennan’s now serves a two-course prix-fixe breakfast starring savory eggs Hussarde.\n\n8. Pine State Biscuits in Portland, OR\n\nIn 2006, three North Carolina ex-pats started selling homemade biscuits from a Portland State University farmstand. Several accolades and countless butter-stained napkins later, Pine State Biscuits is an institution with two cafés, a takeaway window and a perpetually mobbed stand at Portland’s seasonal farmers’ market. Locals revere the Reggie Deluxe sandwich, which combines fried chicken, bacon and cheese with sausage or mushroom gravy and a fried egg on a surprisingly buoyant biscuit. Like a soggy Portland winter, it’s not for the faint of heart.\n\n9. Green Street Cafe in Miami\n\nThis is the Grove’s command central for the socio-anthropological sport of people-watching, thanks to the Green Street’s strategic placement on a bustling corner. To accompany this activity, management thoughtfully provides excellent salads, flatbreads, pastas and burgers.\n\n10. Clary’s Cafe in Savannah\n\nNeighboring grand dame Mrs. Wilkes might get all the guidebook ink, but Clary’s Cafe is the down-home real deal. Part diner, part greasy spoon and all Southern charm, Clary’s is staffed by a multigenerational cast of affectionately surly servers wont to call guests “hon,” serving gargantuan pecan sticky buns, country-fried steaks and cheesy grits to ravenous crowds of families, students and John Berendt–reading vacationers.\n\n11. Destroyer in Los Angeles\n\nNo detail is unaccounted for at Jordan Kahn’s Destroyer, where the presentation, architecture and ingredients all come together to create this minimalist breakfast and lunch spot in Culver City. The menu of tiny dishes changes daily and is no stranger to items like raw oatmeal and Icelandic yogurt. Breakfast bowls veer into seriously savory territory: think roasted yams with avocado and crispy cauliflower heaped with black garlic and a poached egg.\n\n12. Picnik in Austin\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BXxwtALnda9/\n\nYes! Picnik’s Paleo-friendly cuisine, previously only found on a trailer, is now also available at the eatery’s stylish new digs. Whether you visit the trailer or the restaurant, butter coffee, designed to send your energy through the roof, is an absolute must. We’re obsessed with the golden milk matcha (coffee, butter, MCT oil, turmeric, coconut milk, matcha chai, maple) and certainly recommend the harvest hash (roasted sweet potato, Brussels sprouts, grass-fed beef breakfast sausage, apple, toasted pecans and a sunny poached egg). Breakfast is available starting at 7am daily.\n\n13. m. henry in Chicago\n\nAt this adorable, sunny, daytime-only café, health food is tasty enough to eat. The owners are committed to organics and offer meat-free options, but they’re okay with a little cheese, butter and sugar every now and then. Case in point: thick, dense blueberry pancakes and a heaping breakfast sandwich of fried egg, Gorgonzola, applewood-smoked bacon and fresh thyme. If that’s too good and gooey for you health nuts, there’s always the Vegan Epiphany, an organic tofu scramble that just may live up to its name.\n\n14. Plow in San Francisco\n\nSimply outfitted with gleaming reclaimed wood tables and floor-to-ceiling windows, Plow is a beautiful space to spend a morning. You’ll find standout dishes on both the sweet and savory ends of the spectrum, from the legendary lemon ricotta pancakes to the house-made biscuits topped with honey butter, scallions and ham or sausage. (Nab a biscuit while you can — they’ve been known to run out on busy mornings.) Even lighter fare is memorable here, like the chia seed pudding served with almond milk, bananas, coconut, almonds, plus local honey and bee pollen.\n\n15. Puckett’s Grocery and Restaurant in Nashville\n\nWith locations in downtown Nashville, Franklin and Columbia, not to mention a roving food truck, Puckett’s is a Southern(-fried) institution. Grab a booth or wooden table, like one-time regular Willie Nelson, and start your morning right with pulled pork atop sweet potato pancakes or Bubba’s Benedict, a misleadingly named, gut-busting take on biscuits and gravy beneath fried eggs and bacon.\n\n16. The Laundry in Fenton, MI\n\nAdjectives like “fun” and “funky” are not frequently applied to Fenton, a sleepy city an hour north of Detroit, but this retro, diner-chic New American haunt defies expectations. In addition to pastries from nearby Zingerman’s and Crust bakeries (the latter’s cinnamon bun is a local favorite), the Laundry’s bombastic breakfasts include the Spanish Conquistador — a cast-iron skillet filled with Tater-Tots, chorizo, baked eggs, smoked mozzarella and house-made romesco — as well as bacon and brie pancakes studded with Nueske’s pork and covered with apple compote.\n\n17. Threefold Cafe in Miami\n\nNot all brunch needs to feel like you’re competing in the Binge-Drinking Olympics. Sometimes, a poached, farm-fresh egg served over crusty Zak the Baker bread smothered in smashed avocado (the Smashed Avo) and a cold-brewed Panther coffee is all you need to feel like you’re winning at brunch. Going for gold? Order a side of bacon and monkey bread for the table (or yourself). As any good athlete should know, a pre-game snack is important. Waiting times typically exceed 30 minutes on weekends, so plan accordingly. Come starving and you might be disqualified.\n\n18. Sabrina’s Cafe in Philadelphia\n\nFor over-the-top breakfast and brunch creations like massive omelets and challah French toast stuffed with cream cheese, bananas and honey, the locals head to Sabrina’s. Even with four additional locations in the Philadelphia area, the Italian Market original still draws crowds willing to wait an hour or more for a table. Pick up some champagne on the way and add some orange juice at this BYOB for a tasty mimosa to accompany your meal.\n\n19. Sleepy Bee in Cincinnati\n\nPopular with Cincinnati scenesters and the people who share free-range omelets with them, this breezy cafe has a chef’s garden, exposed brick and industrial chic steel beams. Lest the scene sound more Brooklyn than Buckeye State, consider the wildly popular Queen City Bee breakfast sandwich, which piles a soft egg, non-GMO apples, arugula and goetta, Cincinnati’s signature pork-and-grain banger, on Shadeau ciabatta. The original Sleepy Bee in Oakley spawned the second outpost in Blue Ash in summer 2015.\n\n20. Bubby’s in New York\n\nThe name means “grandma” in Yiddish, but to celebs, punksters and stroller-pushers who wait all morning for a table, it means brunch. Both the original Tribeca location as well as the newer Chelsea location near the High Line will indulge an early-morning craving for the spot’s signature mile-high pies; or go more traditional with sourdough pancakes, cheesy grits with sausage or eggs Benedict with house-smoked salmon.\n\n21. Coastal Kitchen in Seattle, WA\n\nThis open-air bar and café has killer oyster happy hours for the sundowner set, but fervent locals brave Capitol Hill’s steep, titular mounds for $6 breakfast cocktails from 8-10am on weekdays. Coastal Kitchen’s swinging scene also includes crowd-pleasing New American fare like the Dungeness crab cake Benedict, gingerbread waffles and scrambled eggs with smoked Wild King salmon. Anchors aweigh.\n\n22. Cafe Kaila in Honolulu\n\nWhat began as an experimental off-hours breakfast pop-up in Waikiki’s Pane e Vino wine bar — without permits or even a grease trap! — is now a (totally legit) Market City phenomenon. Owner Chrissie Kaila Castillo serves fluffy, flawless buttermilk pancakes and malted Belgian waffles topped with local berries or bananas in an airy café with blond wood tables and a perennially packed counter. Breakfast lines at Café Kaila can stretch around the block, especially on weekends, so those with flexible appetites should consider a weekday pancake run."
