To create a seasonal menu that reflects the area, he leverages his strong relationships with regional farmers and food producers, as well as his love of gardening and foraging.\n\nIt was here in the Berkshires that Chef Stephen learned the importance of spending time in the soil where the foods he works with grow and flourish. This concept is paramount to his style and approach to cooking. He believes that good soil is crucial for the roots of plants to thrive, which translates to a deep respect and love for food and a healthy lifestyle. This belief is still true to this day.\n\nWith years of experience working in various local restaurants and prestigious private schools, as well as serving as an Executive Chef at Bousquet Ski Mountain and Lake Placid Convention Center, Chef Stephen brings a wealth of knowledge and expertise to Jacob’s Pillow. His passion for cooking and exploring new cuisines was ignited at an early age, and over the years, he has developed a healthy and adventurous food aesthetic that is reflected in his bold and colorful palette. Entering his second season at Jacob’s Pillow, Chef Stephen is excited to bring back his expertise, knowledge and unique flavors to your dining experience at the premiere, world-famous dance festival."
