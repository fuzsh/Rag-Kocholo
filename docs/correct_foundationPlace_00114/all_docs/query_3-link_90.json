Our affordable and sustainable service is made possible by our passionate people, cutting-edge technology, efficient planning, and, of course, our fleet of iconic electric vehicles! Itâs why our customer base is growing rapidly across the Netherlands, Germany, and France. One of the things that makes Picnic different is that we handle almost everything in-house: forecasting, developing our first automated warehouse and new electric Picnic vehicles, internal and customer-facing applicationsâthe list goes on. It gives us more freedom when it comes to trying out new and innovative ideas, which is something we do a lot! We love to challenge ourselves and learn new things. Our teams have access to various meetups, language classes, âLunch & Learnâ sessions, our very own Tech Academy, and tailored soft-skills training. Professional development is as important to us as the service we provide to our customers. As a diverse team made up of over 80 nationalities, there are always plenty of activities to get involved with, whether youâre into sports, board games, charitable causes, dancing (at our legendary Picnic festival), or licorice tastingâyes, even that! Our scale-up culture means you get to own your role and bring fresh ideas to the table. So, if youâre looking for an opportunity to make a real difference, get in touchâweâd love to hear from you."
