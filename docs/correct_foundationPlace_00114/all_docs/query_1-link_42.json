        "text": "Spring is in the air and what better way to enjoy the valley's picturesque parks and playgrounds than to pack a picnic basket filled with your favorite goodies and a comfortable blanket, and leave your electronics behind.\n\nKatie Randall loves to picnic in the local parks with her husband Juan Angel and their 7-year-old daughter Stella.\n\n“We picnicked at Peach Hill Park in Poughkeepsie and loved that (we) were in the trees, with almost no one else around and lots of space for kids to run and play,” said the Hopewell Junction resident and founder of Katie’s Hudson Valley Travel Blog. “Plus, you can pick apples if it's apple season.”\n\nShe’s also taken her family for a picnic at Trevor Zoo in Millbrook.\n\n“It’s one of my most favorite places to picnic,” she said. “We sit right by the emus in the shade or down by the otters and listen to the waterfalls.”\n\nThere are plenty of wonderful places to picnic in Dutchess County. Here are some to sample:\n\nUpper Landing Park\n\nLocated in the City of Poughkeepsie, right on the banks of the Hudson River, Upper Landing Park not only offers splendid views for a picnic, but the area is steeped in history. It was once used as a hunting and fishing ground for Native Americans and has served as a homestead, mill site, commercial dock, Revolutionary War depot, industrial hub and electrical power generation source.\n\n“The property has a rich history going back to the late 1600s and there is interpretive signage throughout the park that tells this story,” said Theresa Gill, director of administration at the Dyson Foundation, which owns the park. “It’s beautiful and quaint. Some have even referred to it as serene.”\n\nThe park, which is open from 7 a.m. to sunset, offers limited amenities — a water fountain and portable toilets — and there are a handful of picnic tables and benches available, or you can bring a blanket. Barbecuing and alcoholic beverages are prohibited.\n\n“The experience of resting beside the river in an unhurried and peaceful environment is totally worth the visit,” Gill said.\n\nGo: 83 North Water St., Poughkeepsie; 845-834-2867; http://upperlanding.org\n\nWhile you’re there: The Mid-Hudson Children’s Museum and the Walkway Over the Hudson are literally steps away. The Mid-Hudson Children’s Museum at 75 North Water St. has exhibits for young children that focus on literacy, art, health and community (http://mhcm.org/). If you want to walk off the picnic you just ate, stroll onto the Walkway Over the Hudson (or take the elevator from Upper Landing Park), which is 1.28 miles long and is free year-round, except for the Fourth of July. 61 Parker Ave., Poughkeepsie (http://walkway.org/).\n\nInnisfree Garden\n\nThis scenic150-acre garden in Millbrook was originally created for Walter Beck and his wife, avid gardener and heiress Marion Burt Beck, and features a beautiful combination of wildflowers, streams, waterfalls, terraces and plants based on principles of Chinese landscape design.\n\n“Innisfree is an extraordinary picnic destination,” said Kate Kerin, landscape curator at Innisfree Garden. “It is full of enough excitement and wonder to entertain families all day. The history and design speak to the most discerning connoisseurs and is one of the most romantic places ever. As a special treat, Innisfree opens an hour before sunrise three times each year. Come then for an unforgettable sunrise picnic.”\n\nInnisfree Garden has public restrooms in the parking area and a designated picnic area. Hours are 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. from April 15-30 only on weekends and holidays. After April 30, the site is open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., Wednesday-Friday; and 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday-Sunday, and holidays.

Who knows if you’ll be inspired to write the next greatest literary work here, but this park in Red Hook does inspire the romance of a picnic.\n\n“Research shows that being in nature eases stress, inspires us and provides overall positive feelings,” said Jay Burgess, Scenic Hudson director of Communications for Poets’ Walk. “When you’re in this 120-acre Scenic Hudson park, you’ll feel fully immersed in the beauty and calm of the outdoors.”\n\nWhen you’re done with your picnic, even the kids will love the two miles of trails to explore, including a universally accessible trail.\n\n“It’s through woods and rolling meadows with rustic cedar pavilions, footbridges and benches, and Hudson River views,” Burgess said.\n\nGo: 776 River Road, Red Hook; 845-473-4440; https://www.scenichudson.org/parks/poetswalk\n\nWhile you’re there: There is plenty to do in the Red Hook area, but take in a little history at Montgomery Place, a 380-acre estate that is a designated National Historic Landmark.

Snodgrass, executive director of The Locust Grove Estate & Locust Lawn Farm. “If you want to enjoy a peaceful picnic, but don’t have time to drive to the mountains, you can pull off the road, enjoy a comfortable picnic table in the shade, and still have time to finish your errands.”\n\nThe grounds are open 8 a.m. to dusk, year-round and no alcoholic beverages are permitted.\n\nGo: 2683 Route 9, Poughkeepsie; 845-454-4500; http://www.lgny.org\n\nWhile you’re there: The Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center at Vassar College, 124 Raymond Ave, Poughkeepsie, is a great way to enjoy some culture when you’re done with your picnic.
