        "text": "Tuesday, August 23, 2011\n\nWe found a sweet new picnic and swimming spot this weekend... a little creek that led to a river in the mountains. We moved some big rocks around and made a little lagoon. The kids floated down the creek all day. When it was time to leave, I had a hard time telling them to get out of the water. They were all just so so happy splashing and floating around.\n\nN's favorite word is \"mum,\" (water.) He just kept squeeling mum, mum, mum everywhere he looked! He was in paradise.\n\nDefinitely the highlight of our weekend over here!\n\nLots of love from all of us,\n\nMaggie"
