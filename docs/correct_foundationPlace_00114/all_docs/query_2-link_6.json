        "text": "Point Reyes National Seashore contains three picnic areas, plus a number of sites at various locations in the park at which there are one or two picnic tables. Use of the picnic areas is free of charge and first-come, first-served, except for a reservable group section at the Bear Valley picnic area. Descriptions and photos of the various locations where picnic tables may be found below. The descriptions of the picnic areas/tables are accurate as of March 2022.\n\nPicnickers are responsible for knowing and adhering to the rules and regulations.\n\nLocations of Picnic Tables in Point Reyes\n\nShow per page\n\nLoading results...\n\nRules for Picnicking:\n\nLeaving food unattended is prohibited.\n\nDon't feed the wildlife.\n\nDon't litter. Take all waste home or dispose of all waste in garbage and/or recycling receptacles provided. Please don't put any non-recyclable materials in recycling receptacles.\n\nLeave No Trace. Do not carve into the picnic tables.\n\nCharcoal Grills:\n\nWood fires are prohibited. Visit our Beach Fires page for information about building wood fires in the national seashore.\n\nOnly charcoal briquettes are permitted in the charcoal grills provided.\n\nCharcoal fires must be attended anytime they are generating heat. Do not depart until the coals and ashes are cold to the touch.\n\nVisitors are welcome to use their own small portable barbecues. All ash and used and unused briquettes must be packed out of the park.\n\nCharcoal fires are prohibited under Very High or Extreme Fire Danger conditions or if the Bay Area Air Quality Management District has issued a Spare the Air Alert.\n\nIf you move picnic tables, before you leave, move them back to where you found them when you arrived.\n\nPicnicking is permitted within all designated campgrounds; however, picnickers must yield campsites to persons with camping permits.\n\nA designated section of Bear Valley picnic area is available by reservation to groups of up to 100 people. Contact the Special Park Uses office by email to reserve this section.\n\nGroups of over 25 people who wish to picnic in the park must first obtain a permit. Because there are limited places in the park which can accommodate a picnic group of this size, and to minimize the impact of such a group on other visitors, a permit system is necessary for groups of 25 or more. Contact the Special Park Uses office by email for more information.\n\nShow per page\n\nLoading results..."
