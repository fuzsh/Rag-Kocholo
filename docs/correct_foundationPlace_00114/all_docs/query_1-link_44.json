        "text": "Almost every year, for over 50 years, thousands of North Dakotans have gathered in Mesa, AZ, for the North Dakota Picnic in early March. It’s a fun event for friends and former neighbors who enjoy Arizona sunshine but still call North Dakota “home”.\n\nAn estimated 3,000 people attended the 2024 ND Picnic, held on March 3rd. Hosted by the North Dakota Community Foundation, the event included entertainment (music by Vic Schwahn, Rick Senger, Gordy \"Crazyfingers\" Lindquist, Colleen Reinhardt, and Sam & the Band), 40 classic cars on display, and numerous vendor booths. The real draw, however, is finding old friends and former neighbors in the crowd.\n\nCheck out the photos below from previous ND Picnics. And join us in 2025 for another great gathering!\n\n2025 ND Picnic in AZ\n\nSunday, March 2, 2025\n\n10 am - 2:30 pm\n\nRed Mountain Park in Mesa, AZ\n\nCost: A $5 per person registration fee is requested, to help defray the costs of hosting the picnic.\n\nFollow the ND Picnic in AZ on Facebook for updates and to connect with friends before the event!\n\nIf you have any questions or would like more information about being a sponsor or vendor at this event, contact Deb at 701-222-8349 or at Deb@NDCF.net.\n\nThank You to our 2024 Picnic Sponsors!\n\nPrairie Rose Sponsors:\n\n2023 ND Picnic Prairie Rose Sponsors\n\nRoughrider Sponsors:\n\nPioneer Sponsors:\n\nLegacy Financial Partners - Ameriprise\n\nEpic Companies\n\nPifer's Auction & Realty\n\nCloverdale Foods\n\nStine Seed Company\n\nState Historical Society of North Dakota Foundation\n\nHospice of the Red River Valley\n\nThe Gaia Home\n\nPremiere Wealth Advisors\n\nYMCA of Clay and Cass Counties\n\nDragonfly Homes by Mindy\n\nHigh Place Mortgage\n\nPremier Wealth Management\n\nOak Grove Lutheran School\n\nLaMesa RV\n\nNDSCS Foundation\n\nProject Bee\n\nFood Vendors:"
