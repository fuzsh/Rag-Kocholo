In a move that could just about finalize their training camp roster, the Boston Celtics have waived Malcolm Thomas and John Lucas III, according to ESPN's Marc Stein.

Acquired in the Keith Bogans trade last week, both players had nonguaranteed contracts. Two other pieces from that deal, Dwight Powell (fully guaranteed) and Erik Murphy ($100,000 guaranteed), are both expected in training camp.

The Celtics now (finally) have a free roster spot to make the Evan Turner signing official. Once that happens, the training camp roster could be set at 20 players, 16 of whom carry fully-guaranteed contracts:

Joel Anthony

Brandon Bass

Avery Bradley

Vitor Faverani

Tim Frazier (training camp invitation)

Jeff Green

Rodney McGruder (training camp invitation)

Erik Murphy (partial guarantee)

Kelly Olynyk

Dwight Powell

Phil Pressey

Rajon Rondo (injured)

Marcus Smart

Jared Sullinger

Marcus Thornton

Evan Turner

Gerald Wallace

Christian Watford (training camp invitation)

James Young

Tyler Zeller

In other news, Chris Johnson -- bless his omnipresent hustle -- was reportedly claimed on waivers by the Philadelphia 76ers. The lefty showed some legitimate 3-and-D potential during his half-season with the Celtics, but, with a nonguaranteed contract, became a victim of the crowded roster.
