Two other pieces from that deal, Dwight Powell (fully guaranteed) and Erik Murphy ($100,000 guaranteed), are both expected in training camp.\n\nThe Celtics now (finally) have a free roster spot to make the Evan Turner signing official. Once that happens, the training camp roster could be set at 20 players, 16 of whom carry fully-guaranteed contracts:\n\nJoel Anthony\n\nBrandon Bass\n\nAvery Bradley\n\nVitor Faverani\n\nTim Frazier (training camp invitation)\n\nJeff Green\n\nRodney McGruder (training camp invitation)\n\nErik Murphy (partial guarantee)\n\nKelly Olynyk\n\nDwight Powell\n\nPhil Pressey\n\nRajon Rondo (injured)\n\nMarcus Smart\n\nJared Sullinger\n\nMarcus Thornton\n\nEvan Turner\n\nGerald Wallace\n\nChristian Watford (training camp invitation)\n\nJames Young\n\nTyler Zeller\n\nIn other news, Chris Johnson -- bless his omnipresent hustle -- was reportedly claimed on waivers by the Philadelphia 76ers.
