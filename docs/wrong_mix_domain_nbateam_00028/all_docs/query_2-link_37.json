        "text": "There is no passion to be found playing small – in settling for a life that is less than the one you are capable of living. #PGTalk #JL3Basketball #MTDS\n\nThe power of youth is the common wealth for the entire world. The faces of young people are the faces of our past, our present and our future. No segment in the society can match with the power, idealism, enthusiasm and courage of the young people.\n\nNYTIMES did a story on NBPA Coaching Program that I am currently the director of. https://lnkd.in/gnmvMRur\n\nThe hottest new saying of the year if your a hooper ‘make that dog sneeze’ if your a hooper you should know what that means if not ask somebody. #MTDS www.jl3basketball.com\n\nDon't underestimate the power of your vision to change the world. Whether that world is your office, your community, an industry or a global movement, you need to have a core belief that what you contribute can fundamentally change the paradigm or way of thinking about problems.\n\nUltimately, leadership is not about glorious crowning acts. It's about keeping your team focused on a goal and motivated to do their best to achieve it, especially when the stakes are high and the consequences really matter. It is about laying the groundwork for others' success, and then standing back and letting them shine. #JL3Basketball\n\nSo happy to announce JL3 BASKETBALL Player Development. I Love this game and I respect the game so it’s only right I give back to the game and pass on my knowledge and teach the game the right way. We just getting started. #JL3basketball follow on IG @JL3Basketball"
