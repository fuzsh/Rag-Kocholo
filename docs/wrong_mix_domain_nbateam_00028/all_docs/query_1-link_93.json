        "text": "BOSTON (AP) — The Boston Celtics have signed swingman Evan Turner.\n\nThe second pick in the 2010 draft averaged 17.4 points for Philadelphia in 54 games last season before being traded to Indiana on Feb. 20. He started two of his 27 games with the Pacers, averaging 7.1 points.\n\nTurner has averaged 11.1 points per game since winning the Naismith Trophy and John R. Wooden Award as national college player of the year in 2009-10 with Ohio State. With Rajon Rondo out six to eight weeks after breaking a bone in his right hand, Turner could get a shot at point guard, a position he played in his last college season.\n\nThe Celtics also announced Monday they had waived guard John Lucas III and forward Malcolm Thomas."
