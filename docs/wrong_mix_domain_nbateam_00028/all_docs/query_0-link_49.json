        "text": "The Celtics might catch a break if Derrick Rose (above) has to sit out tonight’s game with a sprained left big toe. Rose is a game-time decision for the game, and his absence would be welcome as the Celtics play their second game in a four-game gauntlet spanning the weekend. Of the team’s next three games, tonight’s is likely the most difficult, though it’s not like things get much easier at Indiana tomorrow or home against OKC on Monday.\n\nThe Bulls scored just 78 points without Rose in a win over the Wizards Wednesday. So you’re saying there’s a chance.\n\nTip-off: 8 p.m.\n\nRecords: Celtics (4-5), Bulls (10-2)\n\nBroadcast info:ESPN, CSNNE (Mike Gorman and Tom Heinsohn), WEEI 93.7 FM/850 AM (Sean Grande and Cedric Maxwell)\n\nProbable starters:\n\nCeltics:\n\nPG: Rajon Rondo\n\nSG: Ray Allen\n\nSF: Paul Pierce\n\nPF: Kevin Garnett\n\nC: Jermaine O’Neal\n\nBulls:\n\nPG: Derrick Rose/John Lucas III\n\nSG: Ronnie Brewer\n\nSF: Luol Deng\n\nPF: Carlos Boozer\n\nC: Joakim Noah\n\nInjuries: Rose (toe) is questionable, as is Celtics guard Keyon Dooling (knee). Jermaine O’Neal sat out of Celtics practice Thursday but is expected to play.\n\nStorylines:\n\nMinutes: Doc Rivers might be preemptively setting his lineup for the weekend by giving a status update on Dooling Thursday. The Celtics play at Indiana tomorrow night, so don’t be surprised if Rivers holds back certain players tonight or tomorrow. ONeal could play heavy minutes in one of the two games, while Greg Stiemsma could see some time in the other. Don’t expect Garnett, Pierce, or Allen to play big minutes in both.\n\nWhere’s Paul?: Pierce took just five shots from the field Wednesday against the Mavericks. The disappearing act was concerning for the Celtics, who looked to be back to their old selves when Pierce returned. If Pierce is still slowed by injury, the Celtics are going to struggle to score. They started Wednesday’s game 1 of 10."
