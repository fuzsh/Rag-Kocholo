        "text": "As expected, two players acquired in the Keith Bogans trade will not enter training camp with the Boston Celtics.\n\nThe Celtics waived John Lucas III and Malcolm Thomas on Sunday after acquiring them from the Cleveland Cavaliers on Thursday, sources told ESPN’s Marc Stein.\n\nBoston traded Bogans, who was on the Celtics’ books for $5.3 million this season after playing in just six games in 2013-14, to Cleveland in exchange for Lucas, Thomas, Dwight Powell and Erik Murphy. Both Powell and Murphy are expected to fight for roster spots in camp.\n\nThe reported departures of Lucas and Thomas will give the Celtics the roster maneuverability to officially sign former Philadelphia 76ers and Indiana Pacers swingman Evan Turner after scooping him up in free agency more than two months ago.\n\nStein also reported Sunday that Chris Johnson, whom the Celtics waived earlier in the week, has been claimed off waivers by the 76ers.\n\nPhiladelphia also acquired Bogans on Saturday in a trade with the Cavs. The Sixers will be the 34-year-old guard’s ninth team in 12 NBA seasons."
