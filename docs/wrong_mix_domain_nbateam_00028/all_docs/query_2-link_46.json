        "text": "The Los Angeles Lakers recently announced the hiring of John Lucas III as an assistant coach on Frank Vogel’s staff, and he has familiarity with some members of the team.\n\nLucas III played eight seasons in the NBA for six teams, but he had the most success with the Chicago Bulls in 2011-12. In that season, Lucas averaged 7.5 points per game off the bench.\n\nHowever, he had an encounter in one game against LeBron James and the Miami Heat that has been brought up since the Lakers hired him.\n\nIn a game between the Bulls and Heat on Jan. 28, 2012, James climbed the ladder and threw down a seamless dunk on Lucas’ head.\n\nNow that Lucas will be coaching James, Lucas joked on Instagram about that moment:\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CT-5O5pJsqL/\n\nLucas III is expected to help with player development and guide the locker room with his experience, but this will definitely be a moment the team also jokes about in the locker room.\n\n[vertical-gallery id=42000]\n\n[mm-video type=video id=01fd0mwhdbq436p741vc playlist_id=01f09kz5ecxq9bp57b player_id=01eqbvq570kgj8vfs7 image=https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/video/thumbnail/mmplus/01fd0mwhdbq436p741vc/01fd0mwhdbq436p741vc-557403ec5f24ee73622f749b0ec6e00e.jpg]"
