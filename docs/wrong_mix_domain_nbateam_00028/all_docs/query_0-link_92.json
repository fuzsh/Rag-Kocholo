        "text": "Pistons president says to add money just to buyout Prince would be 'dumbest personnel move ever'\n\nIt's understandable if Tayshaun Prince would prefer to play for a team with NBA title aspirations – not a team fighting just to make the postseason for the first time since the 2008-09 season.\n\nDetroit Pistons czar Stan Van Gundy empathizes with that sentiment.\n\nBut he said today that if Prince has a problem with the trade that returned him to the franchise that selected him in 2002 draft, it should be with the team that traded him, the Boston Celtics – not the Pistons.\n\nVan Gundy was asked why not buy out Prince to allow him to go earn a title.\n\n\"That's not my decision,\" Van Gundy said. \"In other words the reason Boston made the trade was to save money. We're paying Tayshaun more money. If he was going to get bought out, he should have done it in Boston. They should have let him be bought out. That's not on me to buy him out. That was not part of the deal.\n\n\"We weren't told of this until after we made the trade by Tayshaun's agent and the whole thing.\"\n\nThe Pistons acquired Prince just before Thursday's trade deadline for Jonas Jerebko and Luigi Datome.\n\nPrince will make $7.7 million this season – Datome and Jerebko will make $6.25 million. The Pistons are adding just under $1.5 million in salary.\n\n\"Why would we trade guys who were making less money to take on more money to waive the guy?\" Van Gundy said. \"That would have been the dumbest personnel move ever. It's not on us. I understand he didn't get what he wanted.\n\n\"But the question you're asking should be asked of (Celtics general manager) Danny Ainge. Not of us.\"\n\nLast month, Prince was traded from the Grizzlies to the Celtics in the deal that sent Jeff Green to Memphis. The enticement in the deal for the Celtics was a protected first-round pick. Prince was never part of Boston's long-term thinking. That's why Van Gundy thinks buyout possibilities should have been discussed at that point – not after being traded to the Pistons.\n\nVan Gundy said that Prince will arrive tonight, take his physical Sunday morning and will be available for the game against the Washington Wizards. Without a practice, Van Gundy said he will be hesitant to use Prince for more than just spot duty.\n\nNotable: Based on his 12-point, nine-assist performance in Friday night's victory over the Chicago Bulls, Van Gundy said rookie point guard Spencer Dinwiddie will get looks when the team is facing bigger point guards. Against smaller floor leaders, John Lucas III will get the nod. … The Pistons officially signed D-Leaguer Quincy Miller to a 10-day contract."
