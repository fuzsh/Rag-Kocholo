        "text": "WALTHAM – He has made the rounds since being selected No. 49 in the NBA draft 15 months ago.\n\nForward Erik Murphy was chosen out of Florida by the Chicago Bulls in June 2013, was waived in April 2014 and signed two days later with the Utah Jazz.\n\nHe was then sent to the Cleveland Cavaliers this past July, but just days before the start of training camp last week, Murphy was dealt again, this time to the Celtics.\n\nThe latest stop on the NBA tour is a homecoming for Murphy, who attended St. Mark’s School in Southboro and is from Rhode Island.\n\nMurphy’s father, Jay, was a standout at Boston College from 1980-84 and was a second-round pick who had a brief NBA career.\n\n“I’m pretty excited,’’ Erik Murphy said of being in training camp with the Celtics. “I grew up down the road in Rhode Island and it’s a special feeling to come back to New England.’’\n\nMurphy, who played only 62 minutes in 24 games with the Bulls last season, was dealt to the Celtics last Thursday night. The Cavaliers traded Murphy, John Lucas III, Dwight Powell, Malcolm Thomas and two second-round picks for Keith Bogans and two second-rounders.\n\n“It was unexpected and kind of came out of nowhere,’’ said Murphy. “but it was definitely a cool feeling to come back home.\n\n“It’s been hectic, but it’s been a lot of fun, too. I’ve learned a lot about he business side of things.’’\n\nMurphy was an All-SEC selection during his career at Florida, where he averaged 7.7 points and 3.7 rebounds in 136 games over four seasons.\n\nNow he is in camp with the Celtics, who have 20 players and a crowded frontcourt situation, making Murphy a longshot to stay with the team.\n\n“All you can do is work hard and do whatever you can to help the team,’’ said Murphy, who was born in France. “I’m going to try to focus on the things that I can control.’’\n\nInjury report: Reserve center Vitor Faverani, who underwent left knee surgery last winter, was held out of the second practice Wednesday afternoon.\n\n“Vitor had a little bit of swelling, so we sent him up to (Dr. Brian McKeon, the team physician) and took an MRI,’’ said coach Brad Stevens. “(Faverani) doesn’t feel like it’s an insurmountable amount of pain, it’s just he’s got a lot more swelling than he had hoped.’’\n\nRookies impress: Stevens has liked what he’s seen the first two days from rookie James Young.\n\n“With James, I went through all our scrimmage segments (from the first day) on film and anything that was live in pretty good detail,’’ said Stevens, “and the most impressive thing about James was that he never really crossed my radar as making mistakes defensively, which is pretty impressive for a young guy.’’\n\nStevens also said rookie Marcus Smart could be a “game changer’’ at the defensive end.\n\nJim Fenton may be reached at jfenton@enterprisenews.com.
