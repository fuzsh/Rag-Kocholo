        "text": "Career stats: George Karl: 6.5 ppg, 3.0 apg, 1.4 rpg / Coby Karl: 2.4 ppg, 1.0 apg, 1.3 rpg\n\nCareer years: George Karl (1973 - 1978), Coby Karl (2007 - 2010)\n\nGeorge and Coby Karl had very under the radar careers professionally in the NBA, but at least they managed to make it to the show. George has obviously achieved more notoriety as a coach than as a player, although he's currently seeking employment with a new franchise, and Coby has been building his skill set by bouncing back and forth between the D-League and Europe since 2008. Young Karl even played with a team in Italy back in 2011 called Armani Jeans Milano, we kid you not.\n\nCareer stats: Leroy Ellis: 9.7 ppg, 1.3 apg, 8.3 rpg / LeRon Ellis: 3.0 ppg, 0.3 apg, 2.4 rpg\n\nCareer years: Leroy Ellis (1962 - 1976), LeRon Ellis (1991 - 1996)\n\nAccolades: Leroy Ellis: NBA champion (1972)\n\nA former first-rounder who never quite panned out in the NBA, LeRon Ellis played a few non-consecutive seasons in the league but mainly spent his time playing overseas. The younger Ellis has also had some run-ins with the law. LeRoy Ellis on the other hand was a career NBA man, drafted sixth overall out of St. John's, Ellis went on to have a lengthy stint in the league that saw him capture an NBA championship with the Lakers in '72.\n\nCareer stats: Milt Wagner: 4.1 ppg, 1.4 apg, 0.7 rpg / Dajuan Wagner: 9.4 ppg, 1.9 apg, 1.4 rpg\n\nCareer years: Milt Wagner (1987 - 1991), Dajuan Wagner (2002 - 2007)\n\nAccolades: Milt Wagner: NBA champion (1988)\n\nMilt Wagner collected an NBA ring when he won the 1988 NBA Finals with the Los Angeles Lakers. Milt also won an NCAA title in 1986 in his last year at Louisville, and finished with 144 career games under his belt while playing for the Cardinals, good enough for second all-time in school history. Dajuan Wagner was the sixth overall pick in the 2002 Draft, but he was immediately hobbled by health issues to start his career. After having an operation to remove his colon he would never return to the promising young player he looked to be before entering the Association. Tough luck for the kid from Camden.\n\nCareer stats: Bob Ferry: 9.1 ppg, 1.4 apg, 5.3 rpg / Danny Ferry: 7.0 ppg, 1.3 apg, 2.8 rpg\n\nCareer years: Bob Ferry (1959 - 1969), Danny Ferry (1990 - 2003)\n\nAccolades: Danny Ferry: NBA champion (2003)\n\nBob and Danny Ferry were both selected with the second picks overall, and both went on to be NBA GMs once their playing days were done. Talk about like father, like son. Danny played over a decade in the Association, and he took home a ring for his troubles when he won the title with the Spurs in 2003.\n\nCareer stats: Scott May: 10.4 ppg, 1.7 apg, 4.1 rpg / Sean May: 6.9 ppg, 1.0 apg, 4.0 rpg\n\nCareer years: Scott May (1976 - 1983), Sean May (2005 - 2010)\n\nAccolades: Scott May: NBA All-Rookie First Team (1977), Olympic Gold Medalist\n\nTo say Sean May fizzled out in his NBA career is like saying Craig Sager has an interesting taste in style, they're both extreme understatements. May, a former first-round pick who hasn't played in the NBA since 2010, has bounced around Europe playing for various club squads, we believe he was last seen in Paris working on his jumper while eating crusty bread. Papa May made All-Rookie First Team in '77, and he boasts an Olympic gold medal.\n\nCareer stats: George Mikan: 23.1 ppg, 2.8 apg, 13.4 rpg / Larry Mikan: 3.0 ppg, 0.8 apg, 2.7 rpg\n\nCareer years: George Mikan (1948 - 1956), Larry Mikan (1970-1971)\n\nAccolades: George Mikan: 5x BAA/NBA champion (1949–1950, 1952–1954), 2x NBL champion (1947–1948), NBL ROTY (1946), NBL MVP (1948), 2x NBL season scoring leader (1947–48), 3x NBA season scoring leader (1949–51), 4x NBA All-Star (1951–1954), 6x All-BAA/NBA First Team (1949–1954), NBA 50 Greatest Players (1996), NBA Hall of Fame (1959)\n\nOne of the greatest players of all time and a true pioneer of the game, George Mikan revolutionized the role of the big man in basketball. He won seven NBL, BAA and NBA championships, three NBA scoring titles, and was a member of the first four NBA All-Star squads. He was officially named as one of the NBA's 50 Greatest Players ever, and he was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1959. Those signature specs and that No. 99 jersey will forever be etched in basketball lore. George's son Larry made a brief NBA appearance with the Cavs during the 1970-71 season, but that would be the extent of his playing days.\n\nCareer stats: John Lucas II: 10.7 ppg, 7.0 apg, 2.3 rpg, 1.4 spg / John Lucas III: 5.1 ppg, 1.5 apg, 1.0 rpg\n\nCareer years: John Lucas II (1977 - 1990), John Lucas III (2006 - Present)\n\nAccolades: John Lucas II: 1977 All-Rookie\n\nJohn Lucas II was a serviceable point guard that could've been better had it not been for his substance abuse problems. He still managed to play 14 years and since getting his life together has been a mentor for many NBA players. Lucas II also had various stints as a head and assistant coach and now works as a life coach for players having difficulty with NBA life. His son, John Lucas III, has some of his father's resolve. After going undrafted in 2005 out of Oklahoma St., the younger Lucas has worked his way into the league and is proving to be hard working role player.\n\nCareer stats: Doc Rivers: 10.9 ppg, 5.7 apg, 3.0 rpg, 1.8 spg / Austin Rivers: 6.2 ppg, 2.1 apg, 1.8 rpg\n\nCareer years: Doc Rivers (1984 - 1996), Austin Rivers (2013 - Present)\n\nAccolades: Doc Rivers: 1x All-Star\n\nDoc Rivers had a solid NBA career and an even better one as a head coach. He served as a viable role player on playoff teams with Dominique Wilkins and Patrick Ewing. And these days he's the head coach of the Boston Celtics and has a ring and a couple trips to the Finals to show for it. His son Austin, on the other hand, came out of Duke with a lot of hype and is struggling to live up to it. Austin has only played one season, so there's still hope for him.\n\nCareer stats: Gerald Henderson: 8.9 ppg, 3.6 apg, 1.7 rpg / Gerald Henderson: 11.3 ppg, 1.8 apg, 3.1 rpg\n\nCareer years: Gerald Henderson (1979 - 1992), Gerald Henderson (2009 - present)\n\nAccolades: Gerald Henderson: 3x NBA champion (1981, 1984, 1990)\n\nDaddy Henderson played 13 years in the NBA, and was crowned a champion for three of them as solid role player for the Celtics and Pistons. His son Gerald is a former first-round pick of the Bobcats and he had his best year to date this past season, averaging 15.5 ppg. Look out, world.\n\nCareer stats: Ed Manning: 5.9 ppg, 0.8 apg, 4.5 rpg / Danny Manning: 14.0 ppg, 2.3 apg, 5.2 rpg\n\nCareer years: Ed Manning (1967 - 1976), Danny Manning (1988 - 2003)\n\nAccolades: Danny Manning: 2x NBA All-Star (1993-1994), NBA Sixth Man of the Year (1998)\n\nEd Manning had a career that spanned 11 seasons with seven different teams, and two different leagues. Danny Manning was an NCAA champion with KU back in 1988, and later that year he was selected first overall by the Los Angeles Clippers. He went on to grab two All-Star nods, an NBA Sixth Man of the Year award, and averaged 14 ppg in a career that lasted more than a decade.\n\nCareer stats: Stan Love: 6.6 ppg, 0.8 apg, 3.9 rpg / Kevin Love: 17.3 ppg, 1.9 apg, 12.2 rpg\n\nCareer years: Stan Love (1971 - 1975), Kevin Love (2008 - present)\n\nAccolades: Kevin Love: 2x NBA All-Star (2011-2012), NBA Most Improved Player (2011), All-NBA Second Team (2012), NBA rebounding champion (2011), Olympic Gold Medalist\n\nWhile he's only played five seasons in the league, there's little doubt that Kevin Love is on the verge of being a superstar. Already a two-time All-Star, rebounding champion, and Olympic gold medalist, Kevin has started his career off with a bang. There's little the versatile big man can't do, including winning the 2012 Three-Point Shootout. The former fifth overall pick is certainly on his way to stardom, we just hope injuries play no further role in his career. We know Stan Love feels the exact same way.\n\nCareer stats: Ernie Vandeweghe: 9.5 ppg, 2.4 apg, 4.6 rpg / Kiki Vandeweghe: 19.7 ppg, 2.1 apg, 3.4 rpg\n\nCareer years: Ernie Vandeweghe (1949 - 1956), Kiki Vandeweghe (1980 - 1993)\n\nAccolades: Kiki Vandeweghe: 2x NBA All-Star (1983-1984), NBA three-point field goal percentage leader (1987)\n\nAlthough he never won an NBA title, Kiki Vandeweghe made the playoffs 13 out of the 14 seasons he played in the NBA. He was also a two-time All-Star and was the NBA three-point field goal percentage leader in 1987. His dad Ernie played six seasons in the league himself, is a Unites States Air Force veteran, and a licensed physician. Those were the days.\n\nCareer stats: Mike Dunleavy, Sr.: 8.0 ppg, 3.9 apg, 1.6 rpg / Mike Dunleavy, Jr.: 11.9 ppg, 2.4 apg, 4.5 rpg\n\nCareer years: Mike Dunleavy Sr. (1976 - 1990), Mike Dunleavy Jr. (2002 - present)\n\nIn this family it's the elder Dunleavy that has come closest to lifting an NBA title, he averaged 10.5 ppg as a starter for the Rockets during the 1980-81 Finals. Dunleavy Jr. is no slouch either, he's established himself as a solid role player in the league, and the former Blue Devil was also this third overall pick in the 2002 Draft.\n\nCareer stats: Dolph Schayes: 18.5 ppg, 3.1 apg, 12.1 rpg / Danny Schayes: 7.7 ppg, 1.1 apg, 5.0 rpg\n\nCareer years: Dolph Schayes (1949 - 1964), Danny Schayes (1981 - 1999)\n\nAccolades: Dolph Schayes: NBA champion (1955), 12x NBA All-Star (1951-1962), 6x All-NBA First Team (1952-1955, 1957-1958), NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team\n\nDolph Schayes truly is one of the cornerstones of the NBA. He's a member of the Association's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team, a 12-time All-Star, and an NBA champion with the Syracuse Nationals in 1955. Dolph would also go on to be NBA Coach of the Year in 1966. His son Danny never lived up to the legacy his dad amassed during his playing days, but he did play 18 years in the league, and was a former first round draft pick. Not too shabby.\n\nCareer stats: Ronald Brewer: 11.9 ppg, 1.8 apg, 1.9 rpg / Ronnie Brewer: 8.2 ppg, 1.7 apg, 3.0 rpg\n\nCareer years: Ronald Brewer (1978 - 1986), Ronnie Brewer (2006 - present)\n\nAccolades: Ronald Brewer: NBA All-Rookie First Team (1979)\n\nBoth Razorback alums, and former first-round draft picks, Ronald and Ronnie Brewer have had eerily similar paths in their basketball careers. Perhaps Ronnie will have a few more accolades to add to his resume once he hangs up his kicks. Baby Brewer is a former Arkansas Mr. Basketball (2003), and he now plies his scrappy style of play with the Thunder, a perennial powerhouse in the Western Conference.\n\nCareer stats: Gerald Wilkins: 13.0 ppg, 3.0 apg, 2.9 rpg / Damien Wilkins: 6.3 ppg, 1.4 apg, 2.4 rpg\n\nCareer years: Gerald Wilkins (1985 - 1999), Damien Wilkins (2004 - present)\n\nGerald Wilkins can look back on more than a decade of service in the league and be proud, he can also take homage in the fact that he has a son who is following in his footsteps. Younger Wilkins has made a name for himself in the NBA, and remains a versatile role-player. Both Wilkins can also say that they are related to nine-time All-Star Dominique Wilkins, now that's cool.\n\nCareer stats: Wes Matthews: 7.9 ppg, 4.2 apg, 1.3 rpg / Wesley Matthews: 13.4 ppg, 1.9 apg, 2.9 rpg\n\nCareer years: Wes Matthews (1980 - 1990), Wesley Matthews (2009 - present)\n\nAccolades: Wes Matthews: 2x NBA champion (1987-1988) / Wesley Matthews: NBA Rising Star (2011)\n\nWhile Wesley Matthews, Jr. is just starting to carve out his legacy in the NBA, his dad Wes, Sr. has set the bar pretty high for his son. Senior played nine seasons in the NBA, and he won back-to-back rings with the Los Angeles Lakers from 1987-1988. He has also played in the USBL, CBA, and spent some time overseas. Since going undrafted in 2009, Wesley, Jr. is has made some noise of his own with his current squad the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nCareer stats: Mychal Thompson: 13.7 ppg, 2.3 apg, 7.4 rpg, 1.0 bpg/ Klay Thompson: 14.8 ppg, 2.1 apg, 3.2 rpg, 0.9 spg\n\nCareer years: Mychal Thompson (1979 - 1991), Klay Thompson (2012 - Present)\n\nAccolades: Mychal Thompson: 1979 All-Rookie, 2x Champion, Klay Thompson: 2012 All-Rookie\n\nA former No. 1 pick overall (1978), Mychal Thompson was able to carve out a nice NBA career. He averaged a double-double (20 and 11) in his third year with the Blazers as their starting center but he was never able to reach that plateau again. However, as a member of the Lakers as Kareem's backup, Thompson helped win two titles as a much needed vet off of the bench. His son Klay has been making a name for himself as one of the game's deadliest shooters in just two seasons. The younger Thompson and his runningmate Stephen Curry are the game's greatest shooting backcourt (according to their coach Mark Jackson—not us).\n\nCareer stats: Jim E. Paxson: 8.0 ppg, 1.6 apg, 4.5 rpg / Jim J. Paxson: 14.3 ppg. 2.9 apg, 2.0 rpg, 1.2 spg / John Paxson: 7.2 ppg, 3.6 apg, 1.2 rpg\n\nCareer years: Jim E. Paxson (1956 - 1958), Jim J. Paxson (1980-1990), John Paxson (1983 - 1994)\n\nAccolades: Jim J. Paxson: 2x All-Star, 1x All-NBA, John Paxson: 3x NBA champion (1991-1993)\n\nJohn Paxson is best known for hitting one of the most clutch shots in NBA history. You know it well, the famed three-pointer that won game six of the 1993 NBA Finals between Michael's Bulls and Barkley's Suns. But people seem to always forget his older brother Jim. The elder sibling was much better than his little brother, making a couple All-Star games and a All-NBA Second Team nod. Injuries cut his career short but he still managed to finish it with a 14 ppg scoring average. Their dad, Jim Paxson Sr., only played two seasons in the Association, but must feel like his legacy was fulfilled by the success of his two sons' NBA careers.\n\nCareer stats: Dell Curry: 11.7 ppg, 1.8 apg, 2.4 rpg / Steph Curry: 19.2 ppg, 6.1 apg, 4.0 rpg\n\nCareer years: Dell Curry (1986 - 2002), Steph Curry (2009 - present)\n\nAccolades: Dell Curry: NBA three-point shooting leader (1999), NBA Sixth Man of the Year (1994) / Steph Curry: NBA All-Rookie First Team (2010), NBA Sportsmanship Award (2011)\n\nOne of, if not the greatest father-son sharpshooting tandem the league has ever seen, the Curry men were, and are, absolutely lights out. Dell Curry was the NBA three-point shooting leader in 1999, and he remains the Hornets all-time leading scorer just shy of 10,000 points. Son, Steph, is already making a name for himself with his pinpoint accuracy. The Warriors guard was the former seventh overall pick in the 2009 Draft and he averaged a career high 19.2 ppg this past season. The sky really is the limit for this kid.\n\nCareer stats: Henry Bibby: 8.6 ppg, 3.3 apg, 2.3 rpg / Mike Bibby: 14.7 ppg, 5.5 apg, 3.1 rpg\n\nCareer years: Henry Bibby (1972 - 1981), Mike Bibby (1998 - 2012)\n\nAccolades: Henry Bibby: NBA champion (1973) / Mike Bibby: NBA All-Rookie First Team (1999)\n\nBoth true point guards in every sense of the position, Mike Bibby may have had better numbers throughout his career, but it was Henry Bibby who's the one sporting the ring at the family cookouts. Hey, maybe he lets Mike try it on from time to time, you never know.\n\nCareer stats: Jimmy Walker: 16.7 ppg, 3.5 apg, 2.7 rpg / Jalen Rose: 14.3 ppg, 3.8 apg, 3.5 rpg\n\nCareer years: Jimmy Walker (1967 - 1976), Jalen Rose (1994 - 2007)\n\nAccolades: Jimmy Walker: 2x NBA All-Star (1970, 1972) / Jalen Rose: NBA Most Improved Player (2000)\n\nIt's no secret that two-time All-Star Jimmy Walker had virtually nothing to do with Jalen Rose's upbringing, although you could make the case that he gave him the greatest gift ever, the inherent skill to dominate on the basketball court. Rose dominated at the University of Michigan with the Fab Five in the early '90s, and he would go on to have a lengthy career around the league. You can now find Jalen on ESPN, looks like things didn't turn out so bad in the end. Here's to silver linings.\n\nCareer stats: Bill Walton: 13.3 ppg, 3.4 apg, 10.5 rpg / Luke Walton: 4.7 ppg, 2.3 apg, 2.8 rpg\n\nCareer years: Bill Walton (1974 - 1987), Luke Walton (2003 - present)\n\nAccolades: Bill Walton: 2x NBA champion (1977, 1986), NBA Finals MVP (1977), NBA MVP (1978), NBA Sixth Man of the Year (1986), 2x NBA All-Star (1977-1978), All-NBA First Team (1978), NBA Hall of Fame (1993) / Luke Walton: 2x NBA champion (2009, 2010)\n\nMany wonder how exactly Luke Walton even got to the NBA, but this list is about love on Father's Day, not hate. Papa Walton had a more illustrious NBA career, averaging a double-double, taking home two rings, and being crowned a Finals MVP. And for all the haters out there, Luke has two rings of his own, although he should probably be sending Kobe Bryant a fruit basket or two at least once a week to show his appreciation.\n\nCareer stats: Joe Bryant: 8.7 ppg, 1.7 apg, 4.0 rpg / Kobe Bryant: 25.5 ppg, 4.8 apg, 5.3 rpg\n\nCareer years: Kobe Bryant (1996 - present), Joe Bryant (1975 - 1983)\n\nAccolades: Kobe Bryant: 5x NBA champion (2000-2002), (2009-2010), 2x Finals MVP (2009-2010), NBA MVP (2008), 15x NBA All-Star (1998, 2000-2013), 2x NBA Scoring Champion (2006-2007), 11x All-NBA First Team (2002-2004, 2006-2013), 2x Olympic Gold Medalist\n\nJoe Bryant may have achieved more fame as coach than as a player, but it's undeniable that his greatest gift to the basketball universe was bringing his son, Kobe, into this world. The Black Mamba is a five-time NBA champion, among numerous other accolades, and he's often mentioned in the same conversation with the likes of Michael Jordan. He may not have many years left, so we'll do well to enjoy him while he's still around.\n\nCareer stats: Rick Barry: 24.8 ppg, 4.9 apg, 6.7 rpg / Jon Barry: 5.7 ppg, 2.2 apg, 1.8 rpg / Brent Barry: 9.3 ppg, 3.2 apg, 3.0 rpg / Drew Barry: 2.2 ppg, 1.9 apg, 1.1 rpg\n\nCareer years: Rick Barry (1965 - 1980), Jon Barry (1992 - 2006), Brent Barry (1995 - 2009), Drew Barry (1997 - 2000)\n\nAccolades: Rick Barry: NBA champion (1975), NBA Finals MVP (1975), 8x NBA All-Star (1966-1967, 1973-1978), 5x All-NBA First Team (1966-1968, 1974-1976), NBA Rookie of the Year (1966), NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team, NBA Hall of Fame (1987) / Brent Barry: 2x NBA champion (2005, 2007)\n\nIf the family that plays together stays together, then the Barry's are going to be chilling for quite a while. Rick Barry doesn't have just one son who has graced the NBA hardwood, he has three, and while not all of them have had prolific careers, making the NBA is certainly a great enough accomplishment on its own. Let's just say that they can share the three rings they have won collectively as a family, Drew is definitely making out like a bandit on that one. Rick and Brent are also one of only two father-son tandems to have both won NBA rings."
