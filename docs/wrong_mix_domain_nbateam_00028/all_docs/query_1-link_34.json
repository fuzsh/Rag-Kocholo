        "text": "John Havlicek (born April 8, 1940, Martins Ferry, Ohio, U.S.—died April 25, 2019, Jupiter, Florida) was an American collegiate and professional basketball player who came to be regarded as the best “sixth man” (bench player) in the history of the National Basketball Association (NBA) while a member of the Boston Celtics. He was the first player to compile 16 consecutive 1,000-point seasons (1963–78).\n\nAt the Ohio State University Havlicek teamed with Jerry Lucas and Bob Knight and won the National Collegiate Athletic Association championship in 1960. After graduation he was drafted by both the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League and the Celtics. After getting cut by the Browns, he joined the Celtics in 1962.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nGreat Moments in Sports Quiz\n\nAt 6 feet 5 inches (1.96 metres), Havlicek played both forward and guard on the Celtics teams that won eight NBA championships (1963–66, 1968–69, 1974, 1976). Widely regarded as one of the most complete players in the history of the NBA, he was noted for his boundless energy at both ends of the court and for his clutch scoring in crucial games. Havlicek was at the centre of one of the most famous plays in NBA history when—in the closing seconds of game seven of the 1965 Eastern Division finals—he deflected a Philadelphia 76ers inbounds pass to seal a one-point Boston victory, a moment that was immortalized by Celtics announcer Johnny Most’s impassioned call of “Havlicek steals it.…Havlicek stole the ball!”\n\nHavlicek was named an All-Star in 13 consecutive seasons (1965–66 to 1977–78) and was a five-time All-Defensive first team selection. Despite coming off the bench for the majority of his career, he held the NBA record for most games played (1,270) and was third on the league’s all-time points-scored list upon his retirement in 1978. In 1996 he was named one of the top 50 players in NBA history, and he was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1984."
