        "text": "It took awhile but John Lucas III is finally a member of the Toronto Raptors.\n\nIt feels like the move was announced two months ago but earlier today the transaction was made final as free agent point guard John Lucas III is a member of the team.\n\nFrom the presser sent to us by the Raptors:\n\nLucas averaged career bests of 7.5 points, 2.2 assists, 1.6 rebounds and 14.8 minutes in a career-high 49 games with Chicago last season. He shot .393 from three-point range (27th in the NBA) and .875 at the charity stripe. He paced the Bulls in scoring six times and in assists on five occasions. Lucas has averaged 5.0 points, 1.4 assists and 11.1 minutes in 111 career regular season games. In seven career playoff outings, he has contributed 6.1 points, 1.3 assists and 14.6 minutes.\n\nHUGE numbers!\n\nWell, not really, but as I discussed on the site before, I like this move provided Lucas isn't option 1A or even B at the PG spot for the Dinos. The 5-foot-11, 165 pound guard is an upgrade in my books over Anthony Carter and various other potential choices, and his long-range shooting provides a nice boost to an area of off-season concern.\n\nAnd you want experience? You got it.\n\nLucas III played overseas from 2007-10, appearing in games for the Shanghai Dongfang Sharks, Tau Ceramica, Bennetton Treviso and even jumped into the D-League pool with Colorado for a stint!\n\nBut...he's 5-11, can be a tad bit of a chucker, and again, if he's pressed into 20 minutes of action or more on a regular basis...\n\nCricket cricket."
