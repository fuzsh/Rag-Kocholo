        "text": "Technically, all NBA contracts don’t become guaranteed until January 10th, butÂ teams that planned to release players without fully guaranteed deals had to do so by 5 pm Eastern today to give them time to clear waivers before the deadline.\n\nMinnesota’s John Lucas III and Orlando’s Arinze Onuaku were the last two players to be waived, but the vast majority of players who were waiting out the deadline received good news. Notable players with newly guaranteed contracts include DeAndre Liggins, who has become a starter in Cleveland, Dorian Finney-Smith, one of the few pleasant surprises of a down season in Dallas, 37-year-old Metta World Peace, who many observers thought might be done with the Lakers, and Ron Baker, who closed out Friday’s win for the Knicks in place of Derrick Rose and Brandon Jennings.\n\nHere’s the complete list by team:\n\nAtlanta Hawks\n\nMike Muscala\n\nBoston Celtics\n\nNone\n\nBrooklyn Nets\n\nSpencer Dinwiddie\n\nCharlotte Hornets\n\nTreveon Graham\n\nChicago Bulls\n\nCristiano Felicio\n\nCleveland Cavaliers\n\nDeAndre Liggins\n\nJordan McRae\n\nDallas Mavericks\n\nDorian Finney-Smith\n\nDenver Nuggets\n\nNone\n\nDetroit Pistons\n\nNone\n\nGolden State Warriors\n\nJaVale McGee\n\nHouston Rockets\n\nKyle Wiltjer\n\nBobby Brown\n\nIndiana Pacers\n\nNone\n\nLos Angeles Clippers\n\nNone\n\nLos Angeles Lakers\n\nThomas Robinson\n\nMetta World Peace\n\nMemphis Grizzlies\n\nTroy Williams\n\nMiami Heat\n\nRodney McGruder\n\nMilwaukee Bucks\n\nNone\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves\n\nNone\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans\n\nNone\n\nNew York Knicks\n\nRon Baker\n\nOklahoma City Thunder\n\nSemaj Christon\n\nJerami Grant\n\nOrlando Magic\n\nDamjan Rudez\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers\n\nRobert Covington\n\nT.J.
