        "text": "Brad Stevens’ emotional blank slate can be a thing to behold at times like this.\n\nHe didn’t sweat during the Celtics’ four-game losing streak to start the season, and save for a hug with Jeff Green last night, he didn’t stray far from that middle range following his first NBA win.\n\nThe Celtics’ 97-87 victory against winless Utah displayed more of the young team’s queasy ways. This time, the opponent cut a 25-point deficit to six with 4:29 remaining.\n\nBut the Celts, now 1-4, avoided matching a particularly grim bit of Green history. The 1946-47 team — more succinctly the original Celtics — still hold the franchise record for the worst start at 0-5.\n\nThe C’s had a lot of players to thank for the offensive punch required to finish this one off, but none more than Brandon Bass, who scored nine of his 20 points in the fourth.\n\n“It gets to me, but one of the things that I hopefully have and it shows is resolve,” Stevens said before the game of the losing.\n\nLater, co-owner Wyc Grousbeck hurried off the floor with the game ball, which he gave to Stevens.\n\nTrue to form, Stevens appreciated the gesture more than the actual trophy.\n\n“That was really nice. You know, I’m going to celebrate for a whole 12 minutes and then I’m going to start watching Orlando and trying to figure them out,” he said of tomorrow night’s opponent. “Obviously they’ve had a great start to their season, and they’ve got good, young talent. And we’ve got a couple more road games. I feel like we’ve already toured half the NBA this week, so just a couple of more road games this week.”\n\nUnidentified in that comment was the second half of that back-to-back road swing, in Miami. But that would count as looking ahead. And as Stevens already knows with this team, looking five possessions ahead can be fatal.\n\nCase in point, Utah’s run after the C’s built their 25-point lead in the third quarter. Gordon Hayward (28 points, nine rebounds, five assists), one of Stevens’ star players at Butler, was one of the featured players in a 21-3 Jazz run during the first 7:30 of the fourth quarter.\n\nBass finally got in the way with a 20-footer with 3:56 left, and the Celtics’ lead was 89-83.\n\nThe forward scored six of the Celtics’ last eight points, including a sneakaway dunk with 42 seconds left after the Jazz, finally broken, didn’t bother to chase Avery Bradley’s home run pass.\n\nThe result was one of Bass’ best offensive games with the Celtics. He had 20 points and, remarkably for the player who is proud of his nickname “No Pass” Bass, two assists.\n\n“Tonight the ball was going our way, the basketball gods were with us, and it was good to get the win,” he said. “Over the years I’ve played different roles, and tonight I was able to put it all together. Defensively, offensively. I could have done better on the boards, but that’s why there is always tomorrow’s practice.”\n\nThere’s a good chance that practice will carry a little less weight.\n\n“We wanted this win very badly,” Bass said. “We needed it. I definitely thought about taking it on my shoulders. (Of course), I did that in our last home game and it didn’t go our way.”\n\nBass was referring to the Celtics’ home-opening loss to Milwaukee in which they blew a 22-point lead. Some of those desperate twinges reappeared last night.\n\n“This game, in the NBA, just fluctuates. It goes back and forth. That happens a lot,” said Stevens, who still is attempting to get a feel for the league’s tumultuous ebb and flow. “My biggest thing was get back on ‘D’ and play the next play. I thought both times it started — Milwaukee and tonight — with baskets at the rim fairly uncontested by them.\n\n“So whatever’s going on on one end, or you miss a shot, or whatever the case may be, we’ve got to get the rim protected in those moments. And sometimes, when you’re up, you tend not to do those little things. And I did think we extended a little bit, and it probably hurt us. You know, we got a little antsy in trying to extend it.”\n\nThen again, it’s going to be that kind of season.\n\nAntsy."
