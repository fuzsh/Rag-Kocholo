The Cleveland Cavaliers and Boston Celtics pulled off a small trade Thursday night on the eve of the Cavaliers' training camp. The Cavaliers acquired the two-year, $10 million, non-guaranteed contract of Keith Bogans, and two second-round picks the Celtics had acquired from Sacramento, both of which are top-55 protected. So, yeah, that's a salary dump.

Meanwhile, Boston pulled in a slew of non-guaranteed contracts. They acquire veteran point guard John Lucas III, Malcolm Thomas, former Chicago Bull Erik Murphy, and rookie Dwight Powell, along with two Cavaliers second-round picks.

So ... what does this mean?

Well, Bogans, along with Brendan Haywood who the Cavs snagged early in the offseason, combine for over $16 million in non-guaranteed money. The idea is that they can use that dead money to send somewhere to target a big upgrade. I'm not sure where they'd find an upgrade over LeBron James, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love, Dion Waiters, or Anderson Varejao, but the team has been looking for a rim protector over the last few months, so they might target a player of that ilk with the package.

Boston adds some second-rounders. Lucas III enters a team that has a plethora of guards, but he's stuck around before. Meanwhile, Powell, Thomas, and Murphy do hold some promise. Unfortunately, the Celtics have 14 other players on roster at the moment. So most of these guys are probably getting waived.
