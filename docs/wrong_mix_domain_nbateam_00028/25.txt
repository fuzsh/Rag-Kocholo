Boston and Philadelphia were making a few last minute roster moves Sunday before training camp opens.

The Celtics officially waived Malcolm Thomas, John Lucas III, something reported by Marc Stein of ESPN.

Why? Because they needed some space to finally, officially sign Evan Turner for camp. They also may bring in someone like camp invitee Christian Waterford, according Chris Forsburg of ESPNBoston.com.

Last Thursday the Celtics waived swingman Chris Johnson and on Sunday the Sixers picked him up, again reported by Stein.

However, this is a fully guaranteed contract, Johnson will have to make the Philadelphia roster.

The Sixers are bringing a full 20 guys into training camp and more than half of them are on guaranteed contracts â€” there is some real drama in that camp for who might make the final roster.
