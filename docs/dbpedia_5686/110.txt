History

Shaw University was founded in 1865 by the American Baptist Home Mission Society of the Baptist Church to provide theological education to freedmen after the Civil War. It is a private, coeducational, liberal arts institution of higher learning with the main campus located in Raleigh, North Carolina, and eight satellite campuses dispersed throughout the state.

Shaw University is committed to providing educational opportunities to all segments of society without regard to race, creed, or ethnic origin. However, as the oldest HBCU in the south, it has maintained a special interest in the education of minorities from diverse backgrounds, with academic potential for success.

Shaw University seeks to empower students with a sense of moral purpose based on Christian principles that provide guidance for intellectual and personal growth. Courses in ethics and values are central to the general education of Shaw students, a charge ascribed to the University in 1993.

Academic Merit

Shaw’s student body of 2,500-plus come from the United States, the Caribbean, Africa, and the Middle East.

Offering Associate and Bachelor’s degrees, Shaw also offers one Master’s degree in divinity, and its Divinity School is one of only a handful of divinity schools in the state of North Carolina to earn full accreditation from the Association of Theological Schools (ATS).

Campus Life

There are several campus clubs and organizations in which Shaw students may participate, including the Pre-Alumni Council, Baptist Students Union, Philosophy Club, Criminal Justice Society, and Future Black Scientists of America, among others.

Off-campus student recreation is easy in Raleigh, as there are approximately 300 public parks, trails, gardens, and squares dotted around town. Additionally, Raleigh is brimming with its own history, culture, and natural beauty.
