        "text": "CHARLOTTE, NC (January 20, 2023) — In continued celebration and acknowledgment of the 50th Anniversary of Title IX, the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association (CIAA), the nation's oldest historically Black athletic conference, will now recognize five women who are currently leading CIAA institutions as president/chancellor. These women are just five of a total of 50 CIAA Title IX Trailblazers, who will be recognized during the 2023 CIAA Men's and Women's Basketball Tournament, which will be held from February 21-25 at the CFG Bank Arena in Baltimore, MD.\n\nIt is not an understatement to say that the CIAA would not be where it is today without the past, present, and future efforts and leadership of these five women– Dr. Brenda A. Allen, Dr. Aminta H. Breaux, Dr. Paulette Dillard, Dr. Karrie G. Dixon, and Dr. Christine Johnson McPhail.\n\nDr. Brenda A. Allen, Lincoln (PA)\n\nPresident\n\nIn 2017, Dr. Brenda A.
