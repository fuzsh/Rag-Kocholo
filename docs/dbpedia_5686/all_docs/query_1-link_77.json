On Niche’s 2023 Best Colleges in North Carolina list, UNC Chapel Hill ranks as #3. Forbes places the UNC ranking as #28 on their 2022 Best College list. Additionally, Wall Street Journal places the UNC ranking at #1 among public universities in the south.\n\nUNC is a much larger university than Duke—the school has an undergraduate population of almost 20,000. However, both are considered among the best colleges in NC.\n\nWake Forest University\n\nLarger than Duke, but smaller than UNC Chapel Hill, Wake Forest University has an undergraduate population of almost 9,000 students. Located in Winston-Salem, Wake Forest is one of the best private schools in North Carolina. It has a motto of “pro humanitate,” meaning “for humanity.”\n\nWake Forest emphasizes service and community as some of its key values. The school is also ranked as #23 in U.S. News’ Best Value list. This means that students can get a quality education at an “affordable” price with many financial aid and scholarship options.\n\nUNC Charlotte\n\nUNC Charlotte is another one of the best colleges in North Carolina. The school has an undergraduate enrollment of just under 25,000 students. While it may not rank as highly as Duke or UNC Chapel Hill, UNC Charlotte is still one of the best universities in North Carolina and offers boundless opportunities for students.\n\nSome of the best colleges in North Carolina fall within the 17-school University of North Carolina system (including UNC Chapel Hill and UNC Charlotte).

So, keep in mind the many community colleges in North Carolina when conducting your college search. Community colleges in North Carolina are a great option for many students. Any of the community colleges in North Carolina can serve as a stepping stone in your education. For example, attending one of the many community colleges in North Carolina can help you later transfer to another one of the best colleges in NC. Attending one of the community colleges in North Carolina can also help limit costs for the first year or two of your education.\n\nHow many colleges are in North Carolina?\n\nSo, just how many colleges are in North Carolina? Well, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, there are 69 four-year institutions in North Carolina. These include both public and private colleges in North Carolina.

Now, let’s look at some other schools in the UNC system.\n\nFirst on our list of these best colleges in NC is UNC Charlotte. The UNC Charlotte campus is located in a metropolitan area and offers 75 Bachelor’s degree programs. It’s a large university with a student body of 30,000.\n\nIn fact, there are actually two UNC campuses within Charlotte. One is a 1000-acre campus in University City, while the other is uptown and aims to serve the local community and urban center. With that in mind, UNC Charlotte upholds a mission of public service and community involvement.\n\nWe understand that the UNC Charlotte ranking may not seem as impressive when compared to those of Duke or UNC Chapel Hill. However, the UNC Charlotte ranking for undergraduate teaching is quite high—#66 according to U.S. News.\n\nColleges in Coastal North Carolina\n\nAlternatively, students looking for a respite from city life would do well at the UNC Wilmington location. Located on the coast, this campus has earned recognition as one of the most beautiful campuses in the South. Almost 18,000 students attend UNC Wilmington. The university emphasizes the integration of teaching, mentoring, research, and service throughout all of their degree programs.\n\nNow that we’ve covered a couple of the public universities in North Carolina, let’s move onto some of the private universities in North Carolina. Davidson College ranks as #1 on Niche’s Best Liberal Arts Colleges in North Carolina. There are just under 2,000 students enrolled at Davidson. The campus is located in a smaller setting, but it’s just a short drive from Charlotte. So, students opting for a small school will likely prefer this school as compared to those within the UNC system.\n\nResearch Universities\n\nWake Forest College and Duke University are both high-ranking private research institutions in North Carolina. However, another high-ranking private research university that we haven’t yet mentioned is Elon University. Elon is lauded for its academic excellence, ranked #1 for undergraduate teaching by U.S. News. And with a reputation for excellent teaching, it’s no surprise that students here will enjoy personalized attention in the classroom with an 11:1 student-to-faculty ratio.\n\nSmall Liberal Arts Colleges\n\nDavidson is one of the top-ranked liberal arts colleges in North Carolina. The Davidson College ranking is high—#15 among liberal arts colleges nationwide.\n\nGiven the high Davidson College ranking both in North Carolina and in the nation, it’s no secret that this school has a sparkling reputation. Students at Davidson can expect a lot of attention from professors in a quaint, small-town setting.\n\nWhile rankings aren’t everything, the Davidson College ranking on various lists highlights its prestige. We’ll also share more details about the Davidson ranking when we dive into private schools in North Carolina later in this article.\n\nOverall, whether you’re interested in private, public, or even community colleges in North Carolina, you’ll have no shortage of choices. Additionally, you’d get an excellent education at any one of these top institutions. Beyond the best colleges in North Carolina, many of the schools in this state are among the best in the nation.\n\nColleges in North Carolina Map\n\nAs you consider the best colleges in North Carolina for you, think about college location. Do you want to be in a big city or small town? Would you prefer a school near the mountains or on the coast?\n\nConsidering the college setting will help you visualize the type of college experience that you could have on campus. So, check out our colleges in North Carolina map above to understand where different schools within the state are located.\n\nInterestingly, many of the best universities in North Carolina are located close to one another. However, you’ll still find colleges spread across the state. For example, Duke is located in Durham, which is quite close to UNC Chapel Hill. Additionally, Wake Forest is in Winston-Salem, which is just over an hour from Charlotte.\n\nLogically, some of the most prominent cities in the state are home to the best colleges in North Carolina. Raleigh, Chapel Hill, and Durham are all homes to top universities. This means that there will be a vibrant university culture in certain sections of the city. And if you’re interested in the best college towns, Durham made our list!\n\nPublic Universities in North Carolina\n\nLocation is certainly an important factor when creating your own best colleges in NC list. However, it’s also crucial to understand the types of universities and how they differ.\n\nPublic universities differ from private universities in that their funding comes from the government. By contrast, private universities in North Carolina (or anywhere in the U.S.) depend on tuition and private contributions in order to fund their institutions.\n\nPublic universities often have a more affordable tuition cost upon first glance, especially to those attending within their home state. For example, the cost of in-state tuition at UNC Chapel Hill is $7,020, whereas the out-of-state tuition cost is $37,360. When considering how to pay for college, that number could be a deciding factor in where you attend school. Additionally, public universities usually, but not necessarily always, offer more scholarships and benefits to in-state applicants.\n\nFor that reason, you’ll notice that many (not all) of the best universities in North Carolina have a larger in-state student body. For example, East Carolina University only has 10% of their student body from out-of-state.\n\nMost Well-Known Public Universities in North Carolina\n\nOne of the best colleges in NC is North Carolina State University, a public university that’s invested in providing students with an affordable education. NCSU also happens to be among the top research institutions in the nation. In fact, Money ranked NCSU as #73 on their 2022 Best Colleges list.\n\nThe most well-known public universities in North Carolina are the 17 members of the UNC system. In fact, it was North Carolina that first introduced the nation to the idea of a public university. This prompted the creation of the University of North Carolina system, home to some of the best public universities in the nation. The goal of this public university system is to provide affordable, quality education that benefits the state of North Carolina and its residents.\n\nWhat’s the top-ranking choice within the UNC system? UNC Chapel Hill is probably the most well-known and renowned pick. Interested in applying?

Still, that may make you wonder: which of these “best colleges in NC” is actually the best?\n\nAccording to U.S. News, Duke University is at the top of the best colleges in North Carolina list.\n\nThe Duke ranking from U.S. News on its Best Colleges list is #10. However, when it comes to North Carolina, it’s the #1 college in the state.\n\nAs you may recall from the colleges in North Carolina map, Duke University is located in Durham, which is considered a trendy city with a large student population. There are many cultural events as well as plenty of nature. Additionally, Durham is affordable compared to other larger cities in the nation. Students attending Duke will have ample opportunities for fun or work within the city.\n\nDigging Deeper into Duke University\n\nDuke is an elite private research institution renowned not only within the state, but all over the nation. The acceptance rate is competitive at just 6%. This low acceptance rate stems partly from the national college rankings, which consistently place Duke among the top universities.\n\nAdditionally, Duke’s campus life attracts many students who want a “traditional” college experience with a vibrant campus life. The campus is 8,600 acres, which makes it feel like its own mini city, with many restaurants, stores, and transit. Athletics at Duke are also a large point of interest; they have 27 Varsity Division I teams. So, no matter your interests, you’re certain to find something to get involved in at Duke.\n\nFinding Your North Carolina Fit\n\nThat being said, there are many other good schools all over North Carolina. With such a competitive acceptance rate, Duke will likely be a reach school for most students. If you’re hoping to impress Duke admissions, you’ll need to carefully plan your application strategy. It will take much more than a good SAT score and an above average GPA in order to get an acceptance letter from Duke. Check out our Duke essay guide and this webinar to learn more about the admissions process. Intimidated by the cost of tuition at Duke? Well, you may not have to be. Learn more about how one student paid for Duke.\n\nAdditionally, remember that Duke may not be the best fit for you. Consider also looking into schools such as Wake Forest or North Carolina State University. In fact, the North Carolina State ranking may impress you. Coming in at #72 on U.S. News nationwide best colleges list, the North Carolina State ranking makes it one of the best colleges in North Carolina.\n\nStart Your Search Early\n\nWhatever you’re looking for in your college experience, the best colleges in North Carolina will not disappoint. When starting your college search, you should first consider your personal preferences and goals in order to create your best universities in North Carolina list.\n\nFor example, if you’re set on attending a top-ranking business school, then you may want to expand your search outside of the state. However, many schools within NC will provide an exceptional business education, even if they don’t appear on the “best universities for business” lists.\n\nBest Private Colleges in North Carolina\n\nWe’ve talked about public universities in North Carolina above, but what about the private universities in North Carolina? While the private universities in North Carolina may seem more expensive than public options, especially for in-state residents, they often provide financial aid and scholarship opportunities for qualifying students. So, don’t rule out private universities in North Carolina based on cost alone!\n\nUnsurprisingly, Duke University is one of the best private universities in North Carolina. Duke has an undergraduate enrollment of about 6,800. With 10 different schools housing a myriad of majors from different disciplines, students will be able to study whatever they desire at Duke.\n\nAlternatives to Duke University\n\nDavidson College is another one of the best private universities in North Carolina. The Davidson College ranking from U.S. News’ Best Liberal Arts Schools is #15. Niche has Davidson College ranking #1 on their 2023 Best Small Colleges in NC list. Additionally, Forbes has Davidson College ranking at #69 on their 2022 Top Colleges list.\n\nEven more impressively, the Davidson College ranking on Forbes’ Private Colleges list is #44. Additionally, the Davidson College ranking on Forbes’ Best Liberal Arts Universities is #13. What’s the Davidson College ranking among southern schools? Well, Forbes has the Davidson College ranking at #16 among schools in the south.\n\nWith Davidson ranking so high on various lists, it will come as no surprise that it’s a very selective school with an acceptance rate of 18%. The undergraduate enrollment is just under 2,000. With a small campus, students looking for a small school with a tight-knit community will be happy at Davidson. Although it is small in size, Davidson provides its students with over 70 majors and minors to choose from.\n\nConcerned that the impressive Davidson College ranking has made it more expensive? Well, you’ll be happy to know that U.S. News actually has Davidson ranking #10 on their Best Value Schools list.\n\nWake Forest University\n\nAnother one of the best private universities in North Carolina, Wake Forest University is located in Winston-Salem. Wake Forest has an undergraduate enrollment of about 5,000 students. The Wake Forest ranking according to U.S. News is #29 on its Best Colleges list. The Wake Forest ranking on their Best Value School list is #23, quite a bit higher than the Davidson College ranking. The acceptance rate is 25%.\n\nWant to learn more about this top school?

Check out our “how to get into Wake Forest” guide in order to craft your most competitive application.\n\nSalem College\n\nNext, let’s look at another small college in North Carolina—Salem College. Probably one of the smallest best private universities in North Carolina, Salem College has an undergraduate enrollment of 367 students. Logically, it has a small campus located in the city of Salem.\n\nThis small private college ranks as #1 in Social Mobility amongst liberal arts schools in the nation. Although the Davidson College ranking is #1 on Niche’s Best Liberal Arts Colleges in NC, Salem is still one of the best liberal arts schools in the state.\n\nElon University\n\nKnown as a leader in providing quality education, Elon University is among the best private universities in North Carolina. The undergraduate enrollment is 6,000 with a higher acceptance rate at 78%. According to U.S. News, the Elon University ranking is #89 in National Universities. The campus is in a suburban setting in Elon, NC.\n\nDiffering from most private liberal arts universities, Elon offers degree programs in business, communications, law, education, and health sciences. Forget about the Elon University ranking when taking it into consideration, as it may not be impressive as the Davidson College ranking. Instead, check out what life would be like on campus.\n\nArt Schools in North Carolina\n\nInterested in seriously studying the arts? Well, then the public universities in North Carolina, private universities in North Carolina, and community colleges in North Carolina may not have exactly caught your attention.\n\nHowever, one of the best schools in North Carolina is actually an arts conservatory. At UNCSA, you can get an excellent education in artistic fields. As a conservatory, USNCA does not offer liberal arts or STEM majors, instead focusing wholly on artistic programs. Check out all that UNCSA has to offer on their website.\n\nCurating Your College List\n\nAnd, don’t forget that your best colleges list will vary greatly from other students and even the national rankings. Additionally, it’s important to keep in mind that college rankings can’t tell us everything about a school. For example, the Campbell University ranking may not catch your attention, but it could certainly be one of the best private schools in North Carolina for you. In fact, the Campbell University ranking tells us nothing about how you’d feel as a student on campus at Campbell.\n\nLikewise, you may have been impressed by the Davidson College ranking on various lists. However, the Davidson College ranking won’t matter much if you want to attend a large public school. The Davidson College ranking, and other college rankings, only go so far in your personal college search. While the Davidson College ranking may have been high according to “official” lists, your preferences may make Elon the best school for you.\n\nSo, keep an open mind during your college search. Additionally, take time to consider things like college size, campus life, and academic programs. Don’t rely solely on statistics, or you could miss out on some of the best schools in North Carolina.\n\nWhat Ivy League school is in North Carolina?\n\nWhen considering all of the best universities in North Carolina, you may wonder if the state is home to an Ivy League school. There are actually only eight Ivy League universities in the nation. These prestigious institutions are all located in the Northeast (NY, CT, NJ, PA, MA).\n\nHowever, a school doesn’t need to technically be an Ivy League school to provide students with an elite and prestigious education. For example, Duke University often gets confused with an Ivy due to its esteemed reputation. UNC-Chapel Hill is considered to be one of the “public Ivies,” meaning that it’s one of the best public universities in the nation.\n\nSo, while there are no Ivy League universities in North Carolina, many of the best colleges in NC are quite elite and prestigious. If you’re interested in applying to an Ivy League or one of the best colleges in North Carolina but don’t know where to start, consider seeking out help from an experienced advisor or counselor.\n\nBest HBCU in North Carolina\n\nAmong the best colleges in NC are some of the best HBCU schools.

As a Black student, or even a first-generation student, you’ll want to be able to meet others with shared lived experiences. Many Black students may decide to attend HBCU schools because of the institutions’ communities, values, and histories.\n\nAs you choose a college, pay attention to college size. The majority of these HBCUs are small institutions that allow students to be a part of a small, close community with shared values. Additionally, many HBCUs in North Carolina are affordable, particularly for in-state students. This makes these HBCUs some of the best colleges in North Carolina.\n\nBelow, you’ll find our ranking of the top HBCUs in North Carolina. Keep in mind that this ranking is not definitive—some HBCUs in North Carolina are larger research universities, while others are small liberal arts colleges. So, you should focus on finding the best HBCU in North Carolina for you, regardless of college rankings.\n\nWhat is the best college in North Carolina?\n\nBased on college rankings alone, Duke University is #1 out of all the colleges in North Carolina.\n\nHowever, college rankings aren’t everything – what matters most is that you find the right college in North Carolina (or elsewhere) for you.\n\nColleges in Charlotte, North Carolina\n\nAre you interested in attending college in a major city with a modern city center and plenty of notable art, theater, professional sports, dining, and nightlife attractions?

Some of the larger colleges in North Carolina will have both undergraduate and graduate students on campus, while other smaller colleges in North Carolina might only have undergraduate students.
