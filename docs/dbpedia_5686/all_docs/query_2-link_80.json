        "text": "By: Shaw University\n\nRALEIGH, N.C. – Beginning in October 2023, Shaw University will expand its campus and Triangle presence to Research Triangle Park, resulting from a new collaboration between ShawU and the Research Triangle Foundation of North Carolina. This strategic move will provide Shaw University with a tangible presence in the heart of RTP, opening up new avenues for growth and development.\n\nThe collaboration will secure Shaw University a dedicated office space within Frontier RTP innovation campus, located in the heart of the Hub RTP development, RTP’s new vibrant downtown area. The space within the Frontier RTP 800 Building will include private offices, an administrative area dedicated to ShawU, and classroom space shared within the premises. Additionally, Shaw University will have access to the common areas of the associated buildings, which include state-of-the-art conference rooms, a collaborative co-working space, and additional event spaces to advance several initiatives:\n\nInstitutional Advancement – The RTP facility offers a dedicated space to meet with donors and forge new corporate partnerships;\n\nStudent Affairs – Career Services will leverage the space to engage potential corporate partners for internships, job fairs, and job opportunities, thereby enhancing students’ career prospects;\n\nAcademics – The classroom areas within Frontier 800 offer versatile spaces for conducting certificate and adult education classes on a regular or as-needed basis, further enhancing Shaw University’s academic capacity.\n\nDr. Paulette Dillard, President of Shaw University, said: “The partnership with RTP provides Shaw with proximity; proximity to cutting-edge companies, proximity to business leaders, and proximity to success. With Shaw now having a dedicated space in RTP, the university can host educational seminars for Park tenants and job fairs for our students. Shaw will be at the front door for opportunities with RTP companies looking for students for internships and jobs, thus building another pipeline for diverse talent in the region.”\n\nAbout the Research Triangle Foundation of North Carolina:\n\nSince 1959, the Research Triangle Foundation of North Carolina (RTF) has served Research Triangle Park in its mission to facilitate collaboration among our region’s industries, universities, and workforce and create economic impact for the residents of North Carolina by attracting the world’s most innovative companies and top-tier talent to North Carolina. Situated centrally among Duke University, North Carolina State University, North Carolina Central University, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, RTP contains 7,000 acres, 60,000 employees, and over 375 companies and national labs, including Biogen, EPA, Cisco Systems, Credit Suisse, NIEHS, Fidelity Investments, IBM, BASF, United Therapeutics, and RTI International.
