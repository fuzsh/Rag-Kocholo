        "text": "The prospect of choosing a college is exciting, but the closer it gets to decision time, the more anxiety it can cause. Use these tips for a stress-free decision.\n\nPARENT:\n\n1. Get organized: Put all the information in one place.Use spreadsheets, which helped to take some of the emotion out of the decision. We could see all the variables for each school right next to each other.\n\nWe included sticker price, financial awards, school size, distance from home, and more. You should include whatever factors will be influencing your decision.\n\n2. Focus on finances: Get real about the role that finances will play in a college choice. For most, financial considerations will at least be part of the equation. Encourage your student to start applying for scholarships early (www.fastweb.com,www.nerdwallet.com,www.scholarships.com) and remind them that a strong GPA can mean thousands of dollars in financial aid.Scholarship tracker\n\nBut as the list narrows and the financial aid letters start to arrive, you need to have an honest conversation with your student about whether finances will be the overriding factor or somewhere farther down the list of priorities. If some schools have become financially unfeasible without taking out a Parent PLUS loan, be honest and take those off the table to simplify the decision.\n\n3: Keep an open mind: Reassure your student that there isn't a \"right\" choice. Many will argue that there is one perfect school for each student, but we found that many schools could be the right one, although each would have come with its own experiences. Realizing that there isnâ€™t a right choice can take some of the pressure off your child.\n\nSTUDENT:\n\n1. Be honest: Is there a school still on your list only because your parents or guidance counselors are pushing it?\n\nIf you have no intention of attending a certain school, don't keep it under consideration just to save face. This can save you a lot of stress as the decision gets down to the wire.\n\n2. Picture the day-to-day: Many students think about where they can picture themselves, which is a good place to start.\n\nIf you can't see yourself living, going to class, and attending social events on a certain campus, take it out of consideration.\n\n3. Be realistic: Beware of blindly following the concept of \"where you feel you belong.\" There is probably more than one school at which you can thrive. Don't commit yourself to a dream school without considering things like cost, travel, and majors.\n\n4. Make a decision: Consider everything, but realize when it's time to decide. When faced with a difficult decision, it's tempting to want to make one more visit or speak with one more admissions counselor. At some point, however, you have all the information you need to make the right decision.\n\nWhen you've narrowed a list down to two or three schools, take a day or two to do some soul-searching. Then, make the final decision and try to relax about it.\n\nOnce you know where you'll be attending, you can move on to other, equally exciting aspects of the college planning process, such as housing and potential campus organizations."
