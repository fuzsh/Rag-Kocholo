        "text": "Making History\n\nAmong the students in the fall term of 1901 at the State Female Normal School in Farmville, VA, were five women who had become very good friends. Attractive, vivacious and intelligent, each woman had been extended invitations to membership from the school’s existing sororities. However, if they each had accepted those invitations, it would mean that our Founders would not be sorority sisters. If the school could have three sororities, then why not four?\n\nEstablishing an identity\n\nThe first membership badge of the Sorority was a shield, upon which the Greek letters Alpha Sigma Alpha were inscribed in gold on a black background. The top of the badge displayed a crown set with jewels. The Founders announced the Sorority’s first hymn, “Blest Be the Tie that Binds,” and first open motto, “To one another ever faithful.” The colors were crimson and silver, and the flower was the white carnation.\n\nAlpha Sigma Alpha Sorority founded\n\nOn Nov. 15, 1901, a new sorority was organized and named Alpha Sigma Alpha. As stated in the charter, “The purpose of the association shall be to cultivate friendship among its members, and in every way to create pure and elevating sentiments, to perform such deeds and to mold such opinions as will tend to elevate and ennoble womanhood in the world.” Signatures to this document include those of Alpha Sigma Alpha’s five Founders: Virginia Lee Boyd (Noell), Juliette Jefferson Hundley (Gilliam), Calva Hamlet Watson (Wootton), Louise Burks Cox (Carper) and Mary Williamson Hundley.\n\nFirst step to expansion\n\nOn Feb. 13, 1903, Alpha Sigma Alpha was chartered in the Circuit Court of Prince Edward County, VA, by Juliette Jefferson Hundley (Gilliam)’s father Judge George Jefferson Hundley. The Sorority was chartered to legalize its existence and to begin the first of many steps toward expanding the sisterhood and making Alpha Sigma Alpha a national sorority.\n\nAlpha Sigma Alpha meets Ida Shaw Martin\n\nAlpha Sigma Alpha began communicating with Ida Shaw Martin, founder of Delta Delta Delta, who at the time was editing The Sorority Handbook. Ida would later become a shining star in the Sorority, becoming an honorary member, national president and leading the reorganization of Alpha Sigma Alpha.\n\nDelta, Epsilon, Zeta and Eta installed\n\nIn 1905, four chapters were added to the roll of Alpha Sigma Alpha. In February, Delta Chapter was installed at Mary Baldwin Seminary, Staunton, VA; in March, Epsilon Chapter was installed at Fauquier Institute, Warrenton, VA; Zeta Chapter was installed at Fairmount Seminary, Washington, DC, on Oct. 27; and in December, Eta Chapter at Ward Seminary, Nashville, TN, on Dec. 15.\n\nAnti-Sorority sentiment\n\nWith its first national council, Alpha Sigma Alpha set out to continue its course of national expansion. However, efforts for expansion were not without difficulties. Anti-sorority sentiment and legislation were beginning to flourish in the South. Shortly after installing Eta Chapter at Ward Seminary in Nashville, TN, the Zeta Chapter was disbanded because of laws banning sororities enacted by the school. Anti-sorority legislation continued to hamper the expansion of Alpha Sigma Alpha for the next several years.\n\nFirst national convention\n\nWith six chapters on its roll, Alpha Sigma Alpha called its first national convention at the Hotel Richmond in Richmond, VA, on Thanksgiving weekend 1905. Highlights: “After the business meetings the young ladies attended the football game between Virginia Polytechnic Institute and Virginia Military Institute and later on they entertained the academy, after which Alpha Chapter gave a magnificent banquet to their visiting sisters and guests. The dining room was tastefully decorated in Alpha Sigma Alpha pennants, the table in American Beauty roses and white carnations. The souvenirs were Alpha Sigma Alpha stick pins made in fraternity colors.” – from local newspaper Topics of the first convention included the publication of a Sorority magazine and the election of the first national council. It was decided The Alpha Sigma Alpha Magazine would be published three times yearly.\n\nConvention recapped in the magazine\n\n“To those who have had a good fortune to see a Southern sunset from the western end of the Charleston Batter there is no need to bring again the picture. It cannot be forgotten or dimmed. Then just as we turned, the moon came up over the harbor water, harmonizing with the quietness which was in that part of the city.” – From the March issue of the Alpha Sigma Alpha Magazine, recounting the 1906 national convention in Charleston, SC."
