        "text": "Editor's note:\n\nBecause Donald Trump’s tenure in the White House has ended, this page will no longer be updated. It will remain in its current state as a resource for historical data.\n\nThe rate of turnover among senior-level advisers to President Trump has generated a great deal of attention. Below, we offer two sets of resources to help measure and contextualize this turnover. The first set of resources tracks turnover among senior-ranking advisers in the executive office of the president (which does not include Cabinet secretaries); the second set of resources tracks turnover in the Cabinet.\n\nA Team Turnover\n\nTurnover on President Trump's “A Team”\n\nPresident Trump’s “A Team” turnover is 92% as of January 20, 2021\n\nThe following chart and table reflect turnover among the most influential positions within the executive office of the president. This data is compiled and tracked by Brookings Nonresident Senior Fellow Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, who refers to this group of advisers as the president’s “A Team.” The list of positions that make up the “A Team” is based on National Journal “Decision Makers” editions, and Dunn Tenpas’s methodology is described in detail in a report she published in January 2018. The chart and table below will be updated as additional members of the “A Team” depart their positions. It is important to note the following:\n\nBecause the “A Team” is made up of members of the executive office of the president, it does not include Cabinet secretaries.\n\nEach position on the “A Team” is only counted once. If multiple people hold and depart from the same position (e.g., communications director), only the initial departure is tracked/affects the turnover rate. For more information on these instances, see the “serial turnover” section below.\n\nSummary and analysis of “A Team” turnover in the Trump administration\n\nSet out below is a list of the senior level departures from the executive office of the president since the beginning of the Trump administration (each of the 65 “A Team” positions is only counted once toward the turnover rate, thus, this chart only includes the first person to hold/depart a given position). “ST” indicates a position that went through multiple instances of turnover; see below for more details.\n\nSerial turnover within the Trump “A Team”\n\nThe turnover data above include only the president’s initial team of advisers and when one departs, the position falls out of the sample. One of the limitations of this approach is that it does not consider multiple departures within a single position, a common phenomenon within the Trump team. Set out below are the “A Team” positions that have had more than two occupants.\n\n45% of President Trump’s “A Team” departures have undergone serial turnover as of January 20, 2021\n\nCabinet Turnover\n\nTurnover in President Trump's Cabinet\n\nThe chart and table below are dedicated to tracking turnover in the Cabinet. They will also be updated as additional turnover occurs. Unlike the trackers above dedicated to the president’s “A Team,” these resources look at every departure from the president’s Cabinet, even if multiple people have occupied that position.\n\nNotice of updated methodology\n\nThe current table of Cabinet-level turnover has been updated from a previous version, accessible here for reference, that was based on a different methodology; this change was made on May 21, 2019. This newer table provides data going back to President Reagan (1981) and adheres to a strict definition of Cabinet by only including the heads of the executive departments. While presidents often promote a position like EPA administrator to Cabinet-level status, these appointments are ad hoc, can be short-lived, and make it difficult to compare over time. Given the variability, we only include Senate-confirmed Cabinet members who are in the presidential line of succession, since this allows for greater consistency and standardization. More information on this update is available in a piece on Brookings’s FixGov blog. Additionally, since Reagan’s presidency, the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Homeland Security have been added to the list (increasing from 13 to 15 positions). Year of departure is determined by the date a Cabinet member announced they were resigning, regardless of their final end date.\n\nSummary and analysis of Cabinet departures in the Trump administration\n\nSet out below is a list of departures from the president’s Cabinet since the beginning of the Trump administration.\n\nAuthor"
