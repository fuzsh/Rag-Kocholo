        "text": "A Young Girl’s Dream…\n\n“Founded on May 15, 1851, Alpha Delta Pi is the oldest secret society for college women in the world. Established at Wesleyan College in Macon, Georgia, the first college chartered to grant degrees to women in the world, the story of Alpha Delta Pi is a remarkable one and it all began with a young girl’s dream.\n\nEugenia Tucker was just sixteen years old when she left her family home in Laurens County, Georgia, to enter Wesleyan College. Before the end of her first year she would establish the first sorority in the world.”\n\nWhen Eugenia Tucker decided to form a society, her dearest and most admired friends were asked to join her. She listed them in her journal as: Ella Pierce, daughter of a bishop; Octavia Andrew, daughter of a bishop; Bettie Williams of South Carolina; Sophronia Woodruff; and Mary A. Evans, daughter of a useful and beloved pastor of Macon Mulberry Street Methodist Church for several years.\n\nAlpha Delta Pi awards motivate and recognize individuals and groups in their quest for achievement. The Alpha Delta Pi award process provides individuals, chapters, house corporations, and alumnae associations clear guidelines and criteria for baseline performance, improvement, and excellence. Results producing excellent output are recognized through the award process. The goal of the awards program is to create positive momentum, celebrate successes, and reward the highest level of excellence in our sisterhood.\n\nCollegiate Chapter Awards\n\nCollegiate awards serve to motivate and inspire all areas of chapter life: rewarding valued chapter characteristics and achievements. Chapter awards are earned by collegiate sisterhoods as a whole, not only officers, individual members, or advisors. Results are outcome-based, thereby making the awards process meaningful and transparent to all members of recipient chapters. Overall chapter performance is recognized each summer with Diamond Four Point and, in convention years, Golden Lion.\n\nDiamond Four Point Chapters\n\nIn early 2024, Grand Council unveiled the refreshed Four Points of our diamond badge: Sisterhood, Service, Character, and Knowledge. When leading with these core values, our chapters provide an outstanding membership experience to all members. Alpha Delta Pi is honored to recognize chapters that demonstrated their commitment to their sisters through achievement in academics, operations, facility management, finance, history reporting, marketing, membership experience, Panhellenic, philanthropy, and recruitment.\n\nDelta—Texas\n\nKappa—Samford\n\nPi—Iowa State\n\nChi—Wittenberg\n\nAlpha Iota—Pittsburg\n\nBeta Alpha—Indiana\n\nBeta Beta—Tennessee, Chattanooga\n\nBeta Eta—Michigan\n\nBeta Nu—Georgia\n\nBeta Phi—Maryland\n\nBeta Omega—Auburn\n\nGamma Theta—Mount Union\n\nGamma Phi—East Tennessee State\n\nDelta Gamma—Arizona\n\nDelta Kappa—Penn State\n\nDelta Omicron—East Carolina\n\nEpsilon Eta—Mississippi State\n\nEpsilon Mu—Northern Iowa\n\nEpsilon Nu—Ashland\n\nEpsilon Omicron—Murray\n\nEpsilon Pi—Georgia Southern\n\nEpsilon Chi—Longwood\n\nEpsilon Omega—Jacksonville\n\nZeta Beta—North Carolina State\n\nZeta Gamma—North Carolina, Charlotte\n\nZeta Epsilon—West Florida\n\nZeta Nu—Clemson\n\nZeta Xi—Virginia\n\nZeta Omicron—Georgia Tech\n\nZeta Tau—Winthrop\n\nZeta Phi—Francis Marion\n\nEta Pi—Virginia Tech\n\nEta Phi—Furman\n\nEta Omega—Centre College\n\nTheta Delta—Delaware\n\nTheta Kappa—Florida Atlantic\n\nTheta Mu—Loyola\n\nTheta Chi—Charleston Southern\n\nIota Beta—Campbell\n\nGolden Lion Hall of Fame Chapters\n\nIn 1973, at the 123rd Anniversary Convention in Atlanta, Georgia, a new tradition began when the Golden Lion Hall of Fame Award was established. This award is the highest honor a chapter can receive. As was typical of Grand President Maxine Blake’s leadership, the award was introduced with grace, dignity, and a certain amount of fanfare when costumed trumpeters processed into the banquet hall to the delight of the Convention body. The Golden Lion Hall of Fame award is achieved by meeting exceptionally high standards in whole-chapter operations across all functional areas, including recruitment and member retention, membership engagement, marketing, service to others, chapter GPA, and business operations including accounts receivable and net income.\n\nAll chapters who earned at least seven Programming Excellence Awards at ADPi Academy were nominated for Golden Lion. Nominees completed a qualitative application of five questions where they shared their chapters’ successes in Chapter Operations, Member Experience, Alumnae Engagement, Chapter Marketing, and Support of the Alpha Delta Pi Brand. A committee of experienced alumnae volunteers very carefully reviewed each application and narrowed the list to the final winners—the very best of the best.\n\nGolden Lion Nominated Chapters\n\nEta—University of Alabama\n\nIota—Florida State University\n\nKappa—Samford University\n\nXi—Ohio University\n\nPi—Iowa State University\n\nChi—Wittenberg University\n\nBeta Alpha—Indiana University\n\nBeta Beta—University of Tennessee, Chattanooga\n\nBeta Epsilon—University of South Carolina\n\nBeta Sigma—Mercer University\n\nBeta Omega—Auburn University\n\nGamma Iota—University of Florida\n\nGamma Phi—East Tennessee State University\n\nDelta Nu—Southeast Missouri State University\n\nDelta Omicron—East Carolina University\n\nEpsilon Eta—Mississippi State University\n\nEpsilon Mu—University of Northern Iowa\n\nEpsilon Nu—Ashland University\n\nEpsilon Pi—Georgia Southern University\n\nEpsilon Tau—Middle Tennessee State University\n\nEpsilon Chi—Longwood University\n\nEpsilon Psi—Tennessee Technological University\n\nZeta Beta—North Carolina State University\n\nZeta Gamma—University of North Carolina, Greensboro\n\nZeta Mu—Appalachian State University\n\nZeta Nu—Clemson University\n\nZeta Omicron—Georgia Institute of Technology\n\nZeta Phi—Francis Marion University\n\nEta Xi—Presbyterian College\n\nEta Omega—Centre College\n\nTheta Theta—Quinnipiac University\n\nTheta Iota—Bucknell University\n\nTheta Kappa—Florida Atlantic University\n\nGolden Lion Winning Chapters\n\nKappa—Samford University\n\nBeta Beta—University of Tennessee, Chattanooga\n\nDelta Omicron—Eastern Carolina University\n\nEpsilon Eta—Mississippi State University\n\nEpsilon Pi—Georgia Southern University\n\nGamma Phi—East Tennessee State University\n\nZeta Nu—Clemson University\n\nZeta Omicron—Georgia Institute of Technology\n\nZeta Phi—Francis Marion University\n\nPublished: June 28, 2024\n\nAlpha Delta Pi is proud to recognize our outstanding collegiate chapter leaders. In June 2024, at Grand Convention in Baltimore, Maryland, the Sorority celebrated these amazing women and their accomplishments.\n\nDorothy Shaw Leadership Award\n\nIn our collegiate chapters, there are always women who parallel the kindred spirit and unselfish service of Dorothy Pierpont Shaw, Psi—California, Berkeley, remembered her for her ready laughter and smile, her unfailing kindness and thoughtfulness of others, and her intense loyalty in service to Alpha Delta Pi. Her life was generously and unselfishly entwined with Alpha Delta Pi. Dorothy Shaw winners strive to live out the tenets of our Creed—committing themselves not only to scholastics, but also to campus activities, service to the community, and often, internships and work. They are leaders in our Alpha Delta Pi chapters, contributing outstanding direction and guidance to fellow sisters. The Dorothy Shaw Leadership Award is the highest award bestowed upon a collegiate member.\n\nAmanda Bailey, Eta Xi—Presbyterian\n\nWhitney Bean, Kappa—Samford\n\nRylee Beardsworth, Theta Eta—Drake\n\nKatie Bianchini, Beta Psi—Kentucky\n\nMia Bonfiglio, Beta Nu—Georgia\n\nAbby Brey, Delta Nu—Southeast Missouri State\n\nElizabeth Crosland, Beta Nu—Georgia\n\nAshley Darling, Zeta Omicron—Georgia Tech\n\nCaroline DeLong, Theta Lambda—Franklin and Marshall\n\nElla Dunlop, Zeta Omicron—Georgia Tech\n\nGabby Finelli, Gamma Theta—University of Mount Union\n\nAvery Flowers, Delta Nu—Southeast Missouri State\n\nRachel Frick, Eta—Alabama\n\nAleana Goetz, Gamma Omicron—Susquehanna\n\nEmily Harrison, Beta Nu—Georgia\n\nAnna Holland, Beta Epsilon—South Carolina\n\nMadisyn Killough, Eta Zeta—Southern Mississippi\n\nSarah Kirtland, Eta Omega—Centre College\n\nMorgan Lank, Gamma Mu—Missouri State\n\nMaria Leonino, Gamma Theta—Mount Union\n\nEmily Martens, Eta Phi—Furman\n\nAddison Miles, Epsilon Eta—Mississippi State\n\nMia Moran, Epsilon Zeta—Texas State\n\nGracie Patterson, Kappa—Samford\n\nEmily Podolski, Eta Epsilon—Miami of Ohio\n\nEmily Powers, Phi—Hanover\n\nGrace Ramos, Iota—Florida State\n\nMazie Reece, Chi—Wittenberg\n\nAlexys Rippe, Phi—Hanover\n\nCarson Sarver, Xi—Ohio\n\nBella Shafer, Eta Phi—Furman\n\nAnna Grace Smith, Eta—Alabama\n\nGeorgia Smith, Delta Delta—Arkansas\n\nAnna Staup, Epsilon Eta—Mississippi State\n\nAudrey Stowe, Alpha Gamma—Missouri\n\nJessica Zajac, Epsilon Eta—Mississippi State\n\nCaitlin Zimmerman, Epsilon Zeta—Texas State\n\nLindsay Zolga, Theta Theta—Quinnipiac\n\nEmerging Leader Award\n\nThis award is presented annually to collegiate members who demonstrate a commitment to leadership in Alpha Delta Pi, on their campuses, and in their communities.

She is known for her compassion, selflessness, and hardworking attitude. Since her first day as an Alpha Member, she regularly volunteered for the local RMHC and deepened her chapter's connection to their philanthropy efforts through numerous activities beyond the academic calendar. In fact, more than 450 participants from the campus Greek community and the local community rallied around her efforts to support a RMHC family. It is because of her efforts that her chapter raised nearly $6,500 for RMHC and accumulated 3,764 of service hours.\n\nMeg Murphy, Eta Nu—Saint Louis University\n\nPublished: June 26, 2024"
