        "text": "Fayetteville State University Chancellor-elect Darrell Allison has pushed back against rumors the school would change its name to the University of North Carolina at Fayetteville.\n\nIn a Wednesday interview, he said it would not be something he would support unless it came from “internal” stakeholders — the Bronco alumni, students and faculty.\n\n“I am an HBCU graduate,” said Allison, who completed his undergraduate work at N.C. Central University in Durham.\n\nHe added, “A proud graduate of an HBCU,” placing emphasis on the word “proud.”\n\nAllison said if a name change were to be pushed on FSU by external forces, “I will quickly go put on my jogging pants, my boots and I will be on the front lines to actively resist that effort.”\n\nMyron B. Pitts:Fayetteville State chancellor addresses vision, faculty revolt, ‘UNC-F’, Silent Sam\n\nHe says that “Fayetteville State University” is the name of the school as he prepares to start his official tenure on March 15, and “unless the stakeholders say otherwise, when I depart, it will still be Fayetteville State University.”\n\nIt seems extremely unlikely that FSU stakeholders will support a name change. For decades, many Bronco alumni and students have worried that statewide powers-that-be would force such a change on the historically Black institution.\n\nThe school was founded during Reconstruction in 1867 and is the second-oldest state-supported university in North Carolina, after UNC-Chapel Hill. FSU is also the second oldest Historically Black College and University in the state, after Shaw University, a private school in Raleigh.\n\nFayetteville State was an early teachers’ college, and this aspect remains in the school’s DNA — it boasts a strong education department that trains new teachers as well as postgraduate students looking to move into administrative roles at their schools.\n\nBronco alumni fear changing the name to UNC-Fayetteville would lose some of that history and heritage.\n\nNero B. Coleman, a 1984 graduate, notes that FSU had different names in its history, including when it was called the State Colored Normal School in its early history and later, Fayetteville State Teachers College. But “Fayetteville State University” is a designation Coleman says the Bronco community achieved through hard work and a history of accomplishment.\n\n“We had to earn the university title,” says Coleman, who served as student body president his senior year. “We were still churning out professionals and degrees when we were a state teachers college. Now that we’ve earned the ‘Fayetteville State University’ I think it’s a mockery to turn around and, because we have become part of the UNC constituency, that we should be UNC-Fayetteville.”\n\nFayetteville State College became Fayetteville State University in 1969 and was also designated a regional university, according to a school history at FSU’s website. Nine years later, FSU became a constituent institution in the UNC system.\n\n‘The process is very political':Fayetteville State students protest policies that got new chancellor selected\n\nColeman considers himself blue-and-white through and through. He tells a story told by many Broncos: The school played a critical role in the person he would become.\n\nColeman is a veteran who served as a paratrooper in Panama in 1973, where he earned his nickname, “Crazy Horse.” He attended FSU on the G.I. bill. He had also had trouble with the law by then and says he is the only former felon to serve as student body president, when he was 28.\n\nThese days, he is an entrepreneur and voting rights advocate; he has scheduled his annual Juneteenth (June 19) get-out-the-vote effort at Seabrook Park, across from FSU’s campus.\n\nColeman expressed skepticism about Allison’s appointment on a recent radio program airing on WIDU. He had supported Dr. Peggy Valentine, the interim president, for the permanent post.\n\nAmong his concerns was a possible name change for FSU.\n\nBut he said of Allison: “I heard that he said he was going to be just as vehement as any Bronco would be in fighting that name change. Prior to that, I was somewhat leery.”\n\nName-change study fails\n\nA name change for any school in the UNC System of 16 institutions is not a quick or easy process. Attention often focuses on the UNC Board of Governors, which governs the system. The board has a say but a change would have to be approved by the N.C. General Assembly.\n\nIn 1996, the board of governors endorsed a resolution changing the name of Pembroke State University, an historically American Indian institution in Robeson County, to the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. Two state representatives, Ronnie Sutton and the late David Parnell, introduced bills in the state legislature that facilitated the change. The two representatives’ districts included Robeson County, and the change had solid local support, including from late Lumbee educator and businessman Adolph Dial.\n\nIt was a different story in 2002 when late State Rep. Bill Hurley, whose district included Fayetteville, filed a bill with the General Assembly to fund a $5,000 study on whether changing FSU’s name would be a good idea. Advocates for changing the name thought it could broaden the university’s appeal and tie it more closely to the UNC system.\n\nHurley, who was in his last term, called it a “simple study,” the findings of which the university could accept or reject.\n\nMore: Fayetteville State trustees won't say if search committee recommended chancellor-elect\n\nBut the Bronco community quickly stormed the battlements. There were student protests on campus and the alumni were vocal, too.\n\nHelen Pierce said in a Fayetteville Observer story in 2002 that the alumni wanted to stick with the FSU name.\n\n“We’ve worked hard as alumni to keep it that way,” said Pierce, a 1967 graduate. “I was unaware that this was being implemented. But the alumni has known for years that this was something in the making.”\n\nAt the time, Dr. Willis McLeod, who was FSU chancellor, was heading up a major marketing campaign to burnish the school’s image. But the chancellor, the first alumnus to lead FSU, made clear a name change would not be part of that effort.\n\n“The alumni and this community is proud of Fayetteville State the way it is,” he said in an interview.\n\nHurley’s bill died.\n\nElevating the FSU brand\n\nDespite the victory, the persistent worry over a name change among some alumni remains and often bubbles to the surface when a new chancellor is chosen or sometimes even when new initiatives are proposed.\n\nFSU balked at being included in the N.C. Promise initiative, a UNC system plan that offers $500 tuition costs for students at some institutions. UNC Pembroke, Western Carolina University and Elizabeth City State University, an HBCU, are part of the program.\n\nMore: Open letter to Fayetteville State chancellor-elect: No 'UNC-F' for FSU\n\nAt an event in 2018, then-Chancellor James Anderson said the program had gotten connected to the idea FSU would have to change its name.\n\n“I think that shed a negative light on ‘N.C. Promise’ unfairly,” he said.\n\nThe controversial nature of Darrell Allison’s appointment has helped spur the current concerns among alumni about where Allison stands on the issue. He had been a member of the board of governors until he resigned his post to pursue the job at FSU.\n\nThe same board appointed him. He beat out more than 60 other applicants, despite his relatively thin resume at the university level and his not holding a Ph.D. He holds a law degree from UNC-Chapel Hill.\n\nOne alumnus said that, even if Allison fights alongside the Bronco community to keep the name, he has less power to stop it now than when he sat on the board of governors.\n\nAllison has said he wants to “elevate the impact” of FSU and help the school sell its story, which he says includes its history.\n\n“A strong advocate is what Fayetteville State University said they wanted in their next leader,” Allison said on Friday at a video conference meeting of the FSU Faculty Senate. “They wanted a leader who would help elevate the brand and reputation of Fayetteville State University.”\n\nThe chancellor-elect is indicating that he does not tie those concepts to a name-change for FSU.\n\nOpinion Editor Myron B.
