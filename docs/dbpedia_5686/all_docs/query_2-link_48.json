Despite facing vicious prejudice from in the aftermath of the Civil War, Shaw rose to become a co-educational college, a medical school, law school and divinity school. During the Civil Rights Movement, Shaw University served as the birthplace of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and continues to rise to the challenges faced by its mission today."
