        "text": "Historically Black Universities and Colleges (HBCUs) across the U.S. are a great source of pride for the Black community. With a rich legacy that dates back to the 19th century, HBCUs have played a critical role in providing Black Americans with educational opportunities. Over time, these institutions have established themselves as beacons of academic excellence and empowerment.\n\nBecause these institutions have significantly impacted the Black community and society, they hold a special place in the history of U.S. higher education. Ahead, we discuss the complete number and location of HBCUs, interesting facts about each one and the importance of supporting them.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education identifies 102 HBCUs in the U.S., primarily located in the Southeast and mid-Atlantic states. Some are in Midwestern states like Ohio, and some are as far west as Texas.\n\nHBCUs are more concentrated in some regions because of the circumstances surrounding their creation. The first Morrill-Land Grant Act of 1862 set the foundation for creating state colleges in the U.S. In 1890, the second Morrill Land-Grant Act carried through on the promise of the first act by requiring states to provide land grants to create schools expressly for Black students. Most of the states required to establish HBCUs were formerly Confederate states.\n\nHBCUs offer unique and valuable educational experiences and benefits to Black Americans and others from underrepresented communities. Students are surrounded by a community of people with similar backgrounds and experiences, and the institutions provide a more affordable and diverse education. A post-graduation benefit is that the schools also have strong alumni networks that continue to support students after they graduate.\n\nHBCUs across the U.S. provide students with exceptional educational experiences that prepare them for fruitful careers. HBCUs can be four-year or two-year schools, and some feature graduate programs, such as law or medical schools.\n\nEach year, U.S. News ranks undergraduate HBCUs based on their achievements. In 2023, U.S. News ranked Spelman College the number one school, followed by Howard University and Tuskegee University. To learn more about HBCUs across the U.S., check out the complete HBCU university list below. The institutions are listed alphabetically within each state."
