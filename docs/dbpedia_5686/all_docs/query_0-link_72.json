        "text": "Brigadier General Clara Leach Adams-Ender, RN\n\nThe first Army nurse and first African American woman to command a major Army base.\n\nBrigadier General Clara Leach Adams-Ender, RN was a pioneering nurse and retired Army officer who accomplished many first in the United States Army. Raised in Willow Springs, North Carolina, Adams-Ender entered NC A&T University in 1956. She participated in the Greensboro sit-ins as a student. In need of financial support, she joined the Army Student Nurse Program to pay for her final two years of school. She graduated in 1961 with a BSN and joined the United States Army at the rank of Second Lieutenant.\n\nAdams-Ender served in the U.S. Army Corps from 1961-1993. She continued her education as she traveled around the globe, earning an MS in Medical-Surgical Nursing from the University of Minnesota, a Master of Military Arts and Sciences from the Army Company and General Staff College in 1976 (the first woman to do so), and became the first African-American Nurse Corps officer to graduate from the United States Army War College in 1982.\n\nAdams-Ender was promoted to the rank of Brigadier General in 1987. In 1991, she was named commanding officer of Fort Belvoir, Virginia, becoming the first Army nurse and first African American woman to command a major Army base. Her military service awards include the Distinguished Service Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster, Legion of Merit, Meritorious Service Medal with three Oak Leaf Clusters, and the Army Commendation Medal.\n\nAdams-Ender retired at Fort Belvoir in 1993. Today, she runs her own management consulting firm, Caring for People with Enthusiasm (CAPE). NC A&T University has honored her with a named professorship in nursing. Adams-Ender is a member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.\n\nImage courtesy of the US Army.\n\nCaptain Alvin Vincent Blount, Jr, MD\n\nThe first African American surgeon to serve in and become chief surgeon of an Army MASH unit and litigant in Moses v. Cone, which desegregated hospitals in the South.\n\nCaptain Alvin Vincent Blount Jr, MD, was a surgeon, civic leader, and civil rights activist. Born in Wake County in 1922, Blount earned a BA in Chemistry from NC A&T University in 1943 and an MD from Howard University in 1947, where he studied under Dr. Charles Drew.\n\nFive years after completing medical school, Blount became the first Black physician to serve in a MASH (Mobile Army Surgical Hospital) unit. Blount was deployed to Korea with the 8225th MASH from Fort Bragg in 1952. While in Korea, Blount also became the first Black physician to act as chief of surgery in a MASH unit. He earned the Korean Service Medal for his service as a surgeon during the Korean War.\n\nBlount is best known for his work as a surgeon and civil rights activist in Greensboro. The first African American to be certified by the American College of Abdominal Surgeons, Blount served as chief of surgery at L. Richardson hospital. Unfortunately, the hospital was under-resourced, and Black physicians in Greensboro began to advocate for changes that would allow them to admit patients to Moses H. Cone Hospital, which had more resources and newer equipment. Blount and other physicians sued the hospital for admitting privileges and, in 1963, won. The Supreme Court’s decision in Simkins v. Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital effectively desegregated all hospitals in the southern United States. Blount became the first Black physician to perform surgery at Cone in 1964.\n\nIn addition to running his private practice and serving as Medical Direct for the Guilford Health Care Center, Blount was a respected civic leader and philanthropist. He was also a mentor to many Black professionals, including NC Supreme Court Justice Henry Frye, and to countless NC A&T students. Dr. Blount passed away in 2017.\n\nImage courtesy of the US Army.\n\nCarrie Early Broadfoot, RN\n\nFounder and first President of the North Carolina Association of Colored Graduate Nurses.\n\nCarrie Early Broadfoot, RN was born in Lynchburg, Virginia in 1870. She graduated from Frederick Douglass Memorial Hospital in Philadelphia in 1899, then served as the hospital’s superintendent from 1900-1904.\n\nBroadfoot relocated to Raleigh to accept the position of superintendent at St. Agnes Hospital School of Nursing around 1905. She married in 1908, moved to Fayetteville, and took a ten year sabbatical from nursing.\n\nBroadfoot hoped to offer her nursing expertise to support the war effort during World War I, but instead led efforts to address the 1918 influenza pandemic. She returned to Fayetteville to practice as a private nurse following the pandemic.\n\nIn 1921, Broadfoot and four other nurses attended the annual meeting of the National Association of Colored Graduate Nurses and decided to form a state chapter in North Carolina. The first meeting of the North Carolina Association of Colored Graduate Nurses was held in Winston-Salem in 1923. Broadfoot, who had also served as recording secretary for the national association, served as the state association’s president from 1923-1931.\n\nIn 1923, Broadfoot was recruited to serve as Superintendent of the Negro Division of the State Sanatorium in Hoke County and as Director of the sanatorium’s nursing school, the North Carolina Sanatorium Training School for Negro Nurses. She remained at the sanatorium until 1944, when the effects of a stroke forced her to move in with relatives in Roxbury, Massachusetts. Broadfoot passed away in 1945. She was inducted into the North Carolina Nursing Association’s Hall of Fame in 2016.\n\nImage courtesy of NC Nursing History, Appalachian State University.\n\nMaude Lee Bryant\n\nMidwife and traditional birthwork advocate.\n\nMaude Lee Bryant was a midwife from Moncure, North Carolina. She was introduced to midwifery by her mother, who was also a midwife, and began delivering babies at the age of 21. Bryant primarily delivered the children of African American women but also delivered a number of white children. She helped to bring nearly 100 local children into the world and was respected statewide as a traditional birth worker. The University of North Carolina School of Medicine released a short film about her in 1984, “Traditional Birthing: Maude Bryant,” which was distributed nationally. She occasionally spoke about midwifery at medical conferences and provided some instruction on traditional birthing to students at UNC Medical School.\n\nBryant raised eleven children of her own and worked alongside her husband, Gade Bryant, on their family farm in Chatham County. She stopped practicing midwifery at the age of 47, following the birth of her grandson. Maude Lee Bryant passed away in 1983.\n\nImage courtesy of the Bryant Family.\n\nMichelle Bucknor, MD, MBA, FAAP\n\nCMO at UnitedHealth Community & State and a leader in addressing social determinants of health.\n\nDr. Michelle Bucknor is Chief Medical Officer at UnitedHealth Community & State, a position she has held since 2019, and a board-certified primary care pediatrician with over 20 years of clinical experience. She is a leading advocate for addressing social determinants of health through collaborative community engagement.\n\nBucknor previously served as the Chief Medical Officer for Community Care of North Carolina and for Advance Community Health in Raleigh. She has also served on the NCPeds Public Policy Committee and currently sits on the Board of Directors of the Alice Aycock Poe Center for Health Education in Raleigh. Prior to living in North Carolina, Bucknor served as the Associate Medical Director at Children’s Mercy Pediatric Care Network and as General Pediatrician at Children’s Mercy Hospital, both in Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nBucknor earned a BS from Dillard University, an MBA In Healthcare Administration from Avila University, and an MD from the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\n\nImage courtesy of Advance Community Health.\n\nDr. Frederick Burroughs\n\nThe first African American physician at Rex Hospital in Raleigh.\n\nDr. Frederick Burroughs was a highly respected physician and the first Black physician to join the staff at Raleigh’s Rex Hospital. Burroughs was born in New Jersey in 1930. He earned an undergraduate degree in Chemistry with a minor in Biology from Hampton University and hoped to attend medical school, but was drafted into the Army. He remained in the Army for six years, then entered Meharry Medical College.\n\nBurroughs moved to Raleigh in 1969 to open a private medical practice. His practice, integrated but still operating in the shadow of segregation, served patients from Raleigh and from rural areas of eastern North Carolina. In the early days of his practice some patients settled their bills with venison or produce from their farms. He still, when needed, made house calls in those years.\n\nHe later founded the Sunnybrook Medical Center, home to the offices of several African American doctors of various specialties, and operated the center for 27 years. He joined the staff at Rex Hospital in 1977, becoming the hospitals’ first African American physician. He retired in 2011.\n\nBurroughs served as an adjunct professor at UNC School of Medicine for 15 years and was a mentor to many. He successfully lobbied for changes to the Murphy Act, which awarded loans to African Americans studying in out-of-state graduate programs not offered at North Carolina’s HBCUs. These loans could be forgiven in exchange for work in “high need” rural areas, which kept young African American physicians from serving in urban centers. Burrough’s efforts led to a relaxing of this requirement and allowed him to recruit more Black physicians to the Raleigh area.\n\nBurroughs was honored by the North Carolina Pediatric Society with the Tayloe Award for Outstanding Community Service in 2003 and was named a Living Legend by the UNC School of Medicine in 2015. He passed away in 2019.\n\nGoldie S. Byrd, PhD\n\nRenowned scientist who studies the genetics of Alzheimer’s disease in African Americans.\n\nDr. Goldie S. Byrd is the Director of the Maya Angelou Center for Health Equity (MACHE) and Professor of Social Sciences and Health Policy at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center. She is a professor and nationally renowned researcher with focuses on health equity, the genetics of Alzheimer’s disease in African Americans, and the inclusion of minorities in research and clinical trials. She began exploring these research areas in 2002, while on faculty at Duke University Medical Center.\n\nIn 2003, Byrd joined the faculty of NC A&T University. She served as the first female chair of the Department of Biology and as the first permanent female Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. She also served as the Interim Executive Director of NC A&T University's Center for Outreach in Alzheimer’s Aging and Community Health, which she founded in 2012 using grant funds from Merck. The organization focuses on assisting those caring for people with Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia as well as training and research.\n\nByrd has also served as a faculty member at Tennessee State University and North Carolina Central University (NCCU). She won the UNC Board of Governors Award of Excellence in Teaching in 2001 for her work at NCCU and was named to the National Black College Alumni Hall of Fame in 2010 for her achievements in the field of science.\n\nByrd serves on the executive board of the NC Institute of Medicine and co-led the task force that created North Carolina’s strategic plan for addressing Alzheimer’s and dementia, leading to a North Carolina Registry for Brain Health. She also serves as co-chair of North Carolina’s COVID-19 Vaccine Advisory Committee.\n\nDr. Byrd earned a BA in Biology and a BA in Biology Education from NC A&T University and a PhD in Microbiology from Meharry Medical College in Nashville.\n\nImage courtesy of Wake Forest Baptist Health.\n\nDr. Dewey Monroe Clayton III\n\nAfrican American physician in Person County and civil rights leader.\n\nDr. Dewey Monroe Clayton III was born in Person County in 1923. He attended Person County Schools and Mary Potter High School in Oxford. He then entered the Army and served in the Quartermaster Corps during World War II. Following the war, he completed pre-medical training at Johnson C. Smith University in Charlotte, earning a BS in 1948, and graduated from Meharry Medical College in 1956. Prior to entering medical school, Clayton taught school for four years, serving as a teacher at Person County High School’s Veterans Program and at Henderson Institute in Henderson, NC.\n\nClayton was the only African American physician in Person County when he began practicing medicine in Roxboro. A civil rights leader, Clayton fought for admission to the UNC School of Medicine in 1948 and won a suit to integrate Person Memorial Hospital in 1964. The lawsuit was the first to be filed with the U.S. District Court in Greensboro following the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He also, along with Julius Chambers, filed a lawsuit to integrate the schools of Person County. Clayton passed away in 1977.\n\nDr. William Alexander Cleland\n\nThe first African American pediatrician in the city of Raleigh.\n\nDr. William Alexander Cleland was born in Hickory, North Carolina and raised in Durham. He moved to New Jersey after high school, where he worked while attending Kittrell College. He completed his undergraduate studies and completed medical school at Howard University. He interned at Freedmen’s Hospital in Washington, DC and was awarded Julius Rosenwald Fund fellowship to study pediatrics at New York University in 1936.\n\nCleland served in the Medical Corps of the United States Army during World War II, serving in the Mediterranean theater. He moved back home to Durham after the war to establish a pediatric practice, becoming the first African American pediatrician to practice medicine in the city. In addition to working in private practice, Cleland served as the President of the Staff and as a pediatrician at Lincoln Hospital, operated four well-baby clinics for the Durham County Health Department, and served as President of the Old North State Medical Society.\n\nCleland was honored with the City of Medicine Community Service Award in 2000 and Duke University School of Medicine has honored him with a named professorship in pediatrics. He passed away in 2001.\n\nImage courtesy of UNC Chapel Hill.\n\nKizzmekia Shanta Corbett, PhD\n\nPioneering viral immunologist whose research led to a vaccine for COVID-19.\n\nHurdle Mills native Kizzmekia Shanta Corbett, PhD is a research fellow and the scientific lead for the Coronavirus Vaccines and Immunopathogenesis Team at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Vaccine Research Center (VRC). She and her team worked with Moderna to develop the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nCorbett began working in the lab at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill while a high school student in Hillsborough, through Project SEED. She earned a BS in Biological Sciences and Sociology from the University of Maryland-Baltimore County in 2008 and a PhD in Microbiology and Immunology from UNC-Chapel Hill in 2014.\n\nA viral immunologist, Corbett has studied dengue virus, respiratory syncytial virus, the influenza virus, and novel coronaviruses. In addition to contributing to the development of novel coronavirus vaccines, a universal influenza vaccine that Corbett worked to develop is scheduled to enter phase 1 clinical trials. In an interview with Sanjay Gupta, Corbett noted that vaccine development allows her to combine her scientific training with her “empathetic nature for people.”\n\nCorbett has worked at the NIH as a biological sciences trainer (2006-2009), studied dengue virus in Sri Lanka as part of her dissertation research at UNC-Chapel Hill (2009-2014), and became a research fellow at NIH in 2014, where her specific focus is the development of vaccines for novel coronaviruses.\n\nThe city of Hillsborough, North Carolina named January 12, 2021 “Dr. Kizzmekia Corbett Day.” She has acted as a public voice for science advocacy, COVID-19 prevention, and vaccine promotion during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nImage courtesy of National Institutes of Health.\n\nRepresentative Carla D.

Her interest in folk medicine began when she was a young child; her curiosity about the natural world and its healing properties stayed with her for the rest of her life. Dupree cultivated a medicinal herb garden and gathered wild plants and herbs from the banks of the Tar River for use in the tonics, teas, and other preparations she developed. She was best known locally for her “nine-herb tonic,” a cure-all that she packaged in repurposed vinegar, mayonnaise, and pickle jars. She did not accept payment for the traditional medicines she offered to her community. She did, however, accept molasses, honey, and other items for use in her medicinal preparations.\n\nDupree was the subject of a 1979 film produced by East Carolina University School of Medicine entitled Little Medicine Thing, a nickname given to her when she was a child. The film was used as part of the University’s medical curriculum.\n\nEmma Dupree was a recipient of the North Carolina Folklore Society’s Brown-Hudson Award and of the North Carolina Heritage Award, a lifetime achievement award recognizing outstanding traditional artists in North Carolina.

The school trained more than 400 Black physicians over the course of its nearly 40-year history. Leonard was the only medical school for African Americans located between Washington, D.C. and New Orleans at the time of its establishment.\n\nIn 1914, Leonard Medical School transitioned to a two-year curriculum. Graduates went on to larger medical schools to complete their training, including Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee and Howard University College of Medicine in Washington, D.C. Leonard Medical School closed in 1918.\n\nProminent alumni of Leonard Medical School profiled in this booklet include Dr. Lawson A. Scruggs, Dr. John T. Williams, Dr. Manassa T. Pope, Dr. Aaron McDuffie Moore, and Dr. William Green Torrence.\n\nTwo of the school’s buildings are still standing today, each of them built in 1910.

The majority of students in the program today are women.\n\nUpon graduating, Nichols established one of the first rural, satellite health clinics in the United States in northern Durham County, North Carolina. She worked here until 1972, when Lincoln Health Center in Durham took over the clinic. She then accepted a position with Lincoln and retired in 1995.\n\nNichols helped to establish and served on the boards of the American Academy of Physician Assistants (AAPA) and the North Carolina Academy of Physician Assistants.
