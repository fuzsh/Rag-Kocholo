These institutions were open to white students. 1821\n\nThe Raleigh Female Benevolent Society is officially incorporated. In 1823, the group released a revised constitution and by-laws that included society reports from the preceding two years. In Ante-Bellum North Carolina: A Social History, Guion Johnson praises the society and its first director, Sarah Hawkins Polk. She writes, \"She was the life of the organization until her death, and under her influence a thriving charity school for the instruction of orphan girls was maintained.

Bryan's memoir, A Grandmother's Recollections of Dixie (1912?), offers a wide-ranging, sometimes sentimental description of an antebellum southerner's perspective on her land, history, and culture. The work is presented as a collection of letters to her grandchildren. In these letters, Bryan remembers being a refugee during the Civil War, and paints a grim picture of Reconstruction, which she believed was worse than the war itself. Her letters also include anecdotes from North Carolina history. 1842\n\nHarriet Jacobs, an Edenton slave, is smuggled aboard a ship to escape slavery after spending seven years hiding in a tiny attic room in her grandmother’s house.

In the final section of the narrative, Battle describes her family's struggle to survive after the war.\n\n1859 Abigail Carter, of Clinton, North Carolina, invents a pair of overalls designed for her husband, who was a railroad engineer. These sturdy overalls wore so well that other railroad men began asking for them. Carter opened a business and became the first manufacturer of overalls in the United States. 1860 Of 2,225,086 black women in America, 1,971,135 are held in slavery. 1861-1865 North Carolina women found war on their doorsteps.

Merging with Barber Memorial College in 1930, and becoming coeducational in 1954, today Barber-Scotia College is a four-year accredited liberal arts school.\n\nOn land donated by former Confederate colonel William R. Myers and with a donation from Mary Duke Biddle, widow of Union major Henry J. Biddle, and under the direction of the Catawba Presbytery, a freedmen’s school opens in Charlotte.
