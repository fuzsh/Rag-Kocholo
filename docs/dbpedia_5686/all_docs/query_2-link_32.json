        "text": "Shaw University, located in Raleigh, North Carolina, is one of the oldest historically black universities in the Southern United States, having been founded in 1865. Its establishment, just after the Civil War, marked a significant step in African Americans' education, providing previously unavailable opportunities. The university was named after Elijah Shaw, a benefactor whose contributions were instrumental in its founding. Shaw University has played a pivotal role in African-American education, including being the birthplace of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), a key organization in the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nToday, Shaw University continues its legacy as a four-year private institution, offering a range of Bachelor's and Master's degrees to a diverse student body of over 1,000. The university's academic programs include popular majors such as Business Administration, Social Work, Criminal Justice, and Biology, reflecting its commitment to providing a comprehensive education that meets the needs of a changing world. Shaw's motto, \"Pro Christo et Humanitate\" (For Christ and Humanity), underscores its dedication to fostering a sense of social responsibility and ethical leadership among its students.\n\nAthletically, Shaw University is a member of the NCAA Division II, competing in the Central Collegiate Athletic Association (CIAA). The university's teams, known as the Bears and Lady Bears, participate in a variety of sports, showcasing the talent and sportsmanship of its student-athletes. The campus's urban setting in the heart of Raleigh offers students a vibrant environment for learning and personal growth, with access to a wide range of cultural and professional opportunities. Shaw University's commitment to academic excellence, combined with its rich history and dynamic campus life, makes it a vital and enduring institution in the landscape of American higher education."
