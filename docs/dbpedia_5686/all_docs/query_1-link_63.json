Interns will work at companies such as Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina, Cisco, CliftonLarsonAllen, Coca-Cola Consolidated, Hooker Furnishings, Lenovo, RTI International, SAS, Syngenta and Wells Fargo.\n\nThroughout their internships, these rising juniors and seniors will gain real-world experience that helps propel them toward successful careers. An annual survey of internship employers from the National Association of Colleges and Employers has consistently found that 50% to 60% of eligible interns convert to full-time employees.\n\nNorth Carolina is home to 13% of the nation’s HBCUs. All five public HBCUs of the University of North Carolina System – Elizabeth City State University, Fayetteville State University, North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, North Carolina Central University, and Winston-Salem State University – actively participate in the program. Additionally, private HBCUs, including Bennett College, Johnson C. Smith University, Livingstone College, Saint Augustine’s University and Shaw University, contribute to the program’s richness.\n\nThe 2024 participants in the North Carolina Governor’s HBCU Internship Program are:\n\nQuintaya Lockhart, Bennett College, Cisco\n\nRashe’Aria Rogers-Hammond, Bennett College, RTI International\n\nTaylor Coleman, Bennett College, RTI International\n\nDayana Garza, Elizabeth City State University, Wells Fargo\n\nChey-anne Wood, Fayetteville State University, Blue Cross Blue Shield of NC\n\nEgypt Henry, Fayetteville State University, Coca-Cola Consolidated\n\nJester Williams, Fayetteville State University, Cisco\n\nThalya Council, Fayetteville State University, Blue Cross Blue Shield of NC\n\nAmeenah Clark, Johnson C.
