        "text": "Shaw University\n\nBy John Akbar and Alan Flores, 9th graders at Brian McMahon High School\n\nAfter visiting eight colleges to date, we are on the final day of our tour. We now hold a different perspective.\n\nShaw University is a private, small, Historically Black College and University (HBCU) in Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\nJa'Quze Booker enthusiastically provided the relevant information, even on a rainy day. We learned that Shaw University was founded in 1865 by Henry Martian Tupper, a Baptist Missionary. The land where Shaw is located used to be a slave plantation, and after the civil war, the land was sold to Elijah Shaw. The university has a rich history of providing high-quality education to students from diverse backgrounds.\n\nShaw University offers undergraduate and graduate programs in various fields, including liberal arts, business, education, and social sciences. Shaw University only requires a 2.0 GPA to gain admission, and they have resources to support the average student. Like with many schools visited before, standardized test scores are optional, but you are encouraged to submit SAT or ACT to compete for scholarships. Tuition amounts to $25,000 annually.\n\nOne of the strengths of Shaw University is its commitment to student success. The university provides a supportive and inclusive learning environment encourages students to achieve their full potential. Shaw offers twenty-four academic programs. Fun Fact, Shaw University was the first 4-year medical school institution in North Carolina. Small class sizes (16:1 student-to-staff ratio) and personalized attention from faculty members contribute to a strong academic experience. Additionally, the university offers various academic support services, including tutoring, academic counseling, and career services.\n\nAnother key feature of Shaw University is its robust campus life. The university hosts nearly thirty clubs and organizations, as well as intramural sports and other activities. This creates a vibrant, engaging campus community fostering personal growth and social connection. Shaw University is also notable for its commitment to social justice and community engagement. The university's commitment to providing a well-rounded education extends beyond the classroom. Students are encouraged to participate in various extracurricular activities, including sports, clubs, and community service initiatives. This allows students to develop their leadership skills, make meaningful connections with their peers, and gain experience that will serve them well professionally. The university also has a strong tradition of promoting civil rights and social justice; its programs and initiatives reflect this commitment. For example, Shaw University has partnerships with local organizations, such as the Baptist Church, that address social issues such as poverty and homelessness.\n\nOverall, Shaw University is a highly respected institution that offers quality education in a supportive and inclusive environment. With its commitment to student success, campus life, and community engagement, Shaw University is an excellent choice for students seeking a well-rounded college experience, a higher acceptance rate, and an affordable option."
