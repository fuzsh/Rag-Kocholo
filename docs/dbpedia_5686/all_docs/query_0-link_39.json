        "text": "College Transfer Programs\n\nAA or AS – Which one should I choose?\n\nAssociate in Art\n\nThis degree program provides a general education for students who wish to continue their studies at a four-year institution. It promotes a comprehensive view of the liberal arts with an appropriate balance of knowledge in the humanities, fine arts, mathematics, natural sciences, and social and behavioral sciences. Graduates may major in a variety of fields, may choose to begin a career in business or industry, or may undertake further specialized training.\n\nAssociate in Science\n\nThis degree program provides a concentration in mathematics and physical and life sciences for university curricula requiring such a background. While this program emphasizes critical analysis and the judgmental skills inherent in the disciplines of science and mathematics, the curriculum also promotes an understanding and appreciation of the arts and humanities.\n\nTransfer of Courses on a Course-by-Course Basis\n\nUpon admission to another public two-year institution or to a public university, a community college student who was enrolled in a community college course and who satisfactorily completed the course with a grade of “C-“ or better in the courses that are designated for college transfer will receive credit for those courses. The receiving institution will determine whether the course will count as general education, major, or elective credit.\n\nHow to Transfer\n\nMake a transfer plan\n\nA successful transfer involves careful planning and takes time to develop. Any student wishing to transfer college credits to other institutions should begin appropriate planning during the first semester at Roanoke-Chowan Community College.\n\nResearch colleges\n\ntransfer of credits\n\ndegree programs and majors offered\n\nlocation\n\ntuition costs\n\nfinancial aid\n\napplication deadlines\n\ncampus culture\n\nstudent population\n\nextracurricular activities\n\nhousing options\n\ncampus jobs\n\nNarrow down your search\n\nArrange for campus visits to your top choices. Take a campus tour, meet with representatives from admissions and financial aid, schedule an appointment with an academic adviser in your major and learn about student life. Explore the town.\n\nCheck out housing opportunities both on and off campus. Contact the housing department or check the college’s housing department Web page for information. Rental apartments and houses are off-campus options.\n\nMany schools offer orientation specifically for transfer students. Orientation includes an opportunity to visit with advisors, enroll in classes and learn about campus life.\n\nApply for Admissions\n\nBegin the admission process as early as a year in advance of transfer by submitting an application along with the application fee to your transfer school. Several schools have online admissions applications.\n\nBe aware of admission application deadlines as they may vary by institution. Some majors or professional schools may require an additional application process. Become familiar with those processes and deadlines.\n\nRequest official R-CCC transcripts to be sent to the transfer school(s) at the time of application. During your final semester at R-CCC, request an additional transcript be sent after grades are posted. Contact all colleges you have attended to request transcripts be sent directly to the transfer school.\n\nSeek financial aid and scholarships\n\nBegin the application process for financial aid and scholarships early. Electronically submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) by the appropriate deadline. Be aware the financial aid process takes considerable time from filing the FAFSA to receiving your award letter. Start the process early.\n\nResearch scholarship opportunities and the application process. Some scholarships may be automatically awarded based on information from the application for admission. Others require a separate application and need documentation of service or activities and letters of recommendation.\n\nRead your mail\n\nCorrespondence sent to you from your transfer school will include important information in making a successful transition.\n\nTHE UNC COMMON NUMBERING SYSTEM (CNS)\n\nThe UNC Common Numbering System (CNS) allows for students to search transfer courses at any of the public institutions in North Carolina. The North Carolina Community College System courses are also included.\n\nThis database will allow students, advisors, faculty and staff to search courses that transfer between public institutions for North Carolina Schools. This will minimize the amount of students that loose academic credit when transferring.\n\nThere is a listing of over 1600 undergraduate, lower-level cross-walked courses that transfer between UNC System institutions as determined by a collaborative effort amount UNC System faculty and staff. The CNS is a searchable database through which a students, advisors, registrars and others can identify courses that easily transfer between UNC System institutions.\n\nCOMPREHENSIVE ARTICULATION AGREEMENT\n\nThe Comprehensive Articulation Agreement (CAA) is a statewide agreement between the North Carolina Community College System and the University of North Carolina System. There are also 24 private colleges and universities that endorse the CAA. The CAA ensures that up to 64 community college credits transfer to the participating colleges and universities.\n\nStudents may view the courses approved for transfer in the R-CCC Catalog.\n\nThe CAA includes two college transfer programs: the Associate in Arts (AA) degree and the Associate in Science (AS) degree.\n\nIf a student from a North Carolina Community College System (NCCCS) college believes the terms of the Comprehensive Articulation Agreement (CAA) have not been honored by a University of North Carolina System (UNC) institution to which the student has been admitted, the student may invoke the CAA Transfer Credit Appeal Procedure.\n\nFor more detailed information about the appeal process and the complete CAA, visit the following site\n\nhttps://www.northcarolina.edu/college-transfer-articulation-agreements/\n\nThe following is a list of the 16 UNC schools that participate in the Comprehensive Articulation Agreement.\n\nUniversity Appalachian State University Elizabeth City State University Fayetteville State University North Carolina A&T University North Carolina Central University North Carolina State University University of North Carolina at Asheville University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill University of North Carolina at Charlotte University of North Carolina at Greensboro University of North Carolina at Pembroke University of North Carolina School of the Arts University of North Carolina at Wilmington Western Carolina University Winston-Salem State University\n\nTransfer Guides\n\nThe links below lead to each institution's baccalaureate degree plans. These plans were developed to help students identify pathways that will lead them from associate degree completion, to admission into a major at a UNC System university, and finally to baccalaureate completion.\n\nBaccalaureate degree plans aren't in place for all majors at every institution. For institutions that do not have established degree plans, the links below will lead to the registrar's office, where students can find more information about how to transfer credit and how to contact the transfer advisor.\n\nAppalachian State University Transfer Degree Plans\n\nEast Carolina University Transfer Degree Plans\n\nElizabeth City State University Transfer Degree Plans\n\nFayetteville State University Transfer Degree Plans\n\nNorth Carolina A&T State University Transfer Degree Plans\n\nNorth Carolina Central University Transfer Degree Plans\n\nNorth Carolina State University Transfer Degree Plans\n\nUNC Asheville Transfer Degree Plans\n\nUNC-Chapel Hill Transfer Degree Plans\n\nUNC Charlotte Transfer Degree Plans\n\nUNC Greensboro Transfer Degree Plans\n\nUNC Pembroke Transfer Degree Plans\n\nUNC Wilmington Transfer Degree Plans\n\nWestern Carolina University Transfer Degree Plans\n\nWinston-Salem State University Transfer Degree Plan\n\nN.C.
