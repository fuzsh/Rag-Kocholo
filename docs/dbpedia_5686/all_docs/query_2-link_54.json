        "text": "Shaw University exists to advance knowledge, facilitate student learning and achievement, to enhance the spiritual and ethical values of its students, and to transform a diverse community of learners into future global leaders.\n\nShaw University, located in Raleigh, North Carolina, is the first historically black institution of higher education in the South and among the oldest in the nation. Founded in 1865 by Henry Martin Tupper, our mission is to advance knowledge, facilitate student learning and achievement, to enhance the spiritual and ethical values of its students, and to transform a diverse community of learners into future global leaders.\n\nWe offer numerous undergraduate degree programs leading to the Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, or Bachelor of Social Work. In addition, graduate level degrees are also offered leading to the Master of Divinity, the Master of Arts in Christian Education and the Master of Science in Curriculum and Instruction - Early Childhood Education. Our accredited programs include kinesiotherapy, athletic training, social work, divinity, religious education, and teacher education.\n\nOur more than 2,100 students represent over 30 states and numerous foreign countries. The small 15 to 1 student to teacher ratio provides an environment conducive to learning that helps promote student development and achievement.\n\nFor almost 150 years, we have produced outstanding professionals who have contributed to the advancement of society. Our graduates include college presidents, academic vice presidents, judges, lawyers, recording artists, school principals, pastors, and other notable persons. In addition, the founder of North Carolina Central University and the first presidents of Elizabeth City State and North Carolina A&T Universities were all Shaw graduates. The third president of Fayetteville State University was also a Shaw graduate."
