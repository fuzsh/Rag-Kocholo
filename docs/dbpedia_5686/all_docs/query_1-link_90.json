        "text": "HBCUs offer all students, regardless of race, an opportunity to develop their talents\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Education’s White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities, HBCUs are a source of accomplishment and great pride for the African American community as well as the entire nation.\n\nThe Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, defines an HBCU as: “… any historically Black college or university that was established prior to 1964, whose principal mission was, and is, the education of Black Americans, and that is accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency or association determined by the U.S. Secretary of Education to be a reliable authority as to the quality of training offered or is, according to such an agency or association, making reasonable progress toward accreditation.”\n\nHBCUs offer all students, regardless of race, an opportunity to develop their skills and talents. These institutions train young people who go on to serve domestically and internationally in the professions as entrepreneurs and in the public and private sectors.\n\nAccredited HBCU listing\n\nAlabama A & M University, Normal, Alabama\n\nAlabama State University, Montgomery, Alabama\n\nAlbany State University, Albany, Georgia\n\nAlcorn State University, Alcorn State, Mississippi\n\nAllen University, Columbia, South Carolina\n\nAmerican Baptist College, Nashville, Tennessee\n\nArkansas Baptist College, Little Rock, Arkansas\n\nBenedict College, Columbia, South Carolina\n\nBennett College, Greensboro, North Carolina\n\nBethune-Cookman University, Daytona Beach, Florida\n\nBishop State Community College, Mobile, Alabama\n\nBluefield State College, Bluefield, West Virginia\n\nBowie State University, Bowie, Maryland\n\nCentral State University, Wilberforce, Ohio\n\nCheyney University of Pennsylvania, Cheyney, Pennsylvania\n\nClaflin University, Orangeburg, South Carolina\n\nClark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia\n\nClinton College, Rock Hill, South Carolina\n\nCoahoma Community College, Clarksdale, Mississippi\n\nCoppin State University, Baltimore, Maryland\n\nDelaware State University, Dover, Delaware\n\nDenmark Technical College, Denmark, South Carolina\n\nDillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana\n\nEdward Waters College, Jacksonville, Florida\n\nElizabeth City State University, Elizabeth City, North Carolina\n\nFayetteville State University, Fayetteville, North Carolina\n\nFisk University, Nashville, Tennessee\n\nFlorida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida\n\nFlorida Memorial University, Miami Gardens, Florida\n\nFort Valley State University, Fort Valley, Georgia\n\nGadsden State Community College, Gadsden, Alabama\n\nGrambling State University, Grambling, Louisiana\n\nH.
