Hill Jr. began his career at North Carolina College of Agricultural and Mechanic Arts upon its opening in 1889. He engaged in the common nineteenth-century practice of serving as both a professor of English and the first college librarian. This responsibility was not a major burden, as the early library occupied only a reading room in the Main Building, and later Holladay Hall. For the first ten years of the college, Hill ordered all books and supervised student assistants. Due to his scholarly interests, the early collection was dominated by the humanities and history, despite the agricultural and mechanical focus of the school. In 1908, Hill became president of the college.\n\nLess\n\nKatharine Stinson was the first woman to graduate from NC State's School of Engineering.

Stinson was taking flying lessons at the old Raleigh Airport on US-401 when Amelia Earhart flew in for a visit in the early 1930s. When Stinson told Earhart that she wanted to become a pilot, Earhart advised her to become an engineer, which was a career Stinson pursued in spite of obstacles that prevented most young women from striving for such a degree. Stinson was told she must enter State College as a junior, so she completed forty-eight semester hours in one year at Meredith, including two summer sessions, to attain her goal. Besides being the first woman engineer to graduate from NC State, Stinson was the first woman engineer hired by the Civil Aeronautics Administration, now the Federal Aviation Administration, in February 1942. By the time she retired from the FAA, as Technical Assistant Chief of the Engineering and Manufacturing Division, she had served as the third president of the Society of Woman Engineers and on a presidential advisory committee for aviation safety under Lyndon Johnson. \"I just wanted to be a good engineer...I just did my job and most of the men accepted me,\" Stinson once said.\n\nLess\n\nDean of Engineering Harold Lampe merged the departments of ceramic engineering, geological engineering, and the metallurgy program in mechanical engineering to become the new Department of Mineral Industries. William W. Austin was head of department. Separate degree programs were retained in ceramics, geology, and metallurgy. A departmental memo from 1954 states, \"the merger has been made because it is felt that an integration of talents and physical facilities of the three areas will result in the most effective and efficient operation.\"\n\nLess\n\nIn 1950, the Tennessee Valley Authority announced that due to budget restrictions, it would discontinue support of the Minerals Research Laboratory.
