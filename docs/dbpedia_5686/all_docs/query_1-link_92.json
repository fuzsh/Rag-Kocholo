Chartered as Elizabeth City State Colored Normal School in the late nineteenth century in Pasquotank County, Elizabeth City State University is now a constituent institution of the University of North Carolina system, offering twenty-eight baccalaureate and four master’s programs, including signature programs in aviation science and unmanned aircraft systems (drones), with a strong reputation for economic mobility and a proud history of student activism.1 From its beginnings, this institution has had to overcome white supremacy, which can be defined as “a political, economic and cultural system in which whites overwhelmingly control power and material resources, conscious and unconscious ideas of white superiority and entitlement are widespread, and relations of white dominance and non-white subordination are daily reenacted across a broad array of institutions and social settings.”2 Examples of the pernicious effects of the resulting systemic racism are replete. Not a single person of color was appointed on the institution’s board of trustees until 1949. Although the institution was founded over a decade before the traditionally white institution East Carolina University, Elizabeth City State did not confer its own graduate degrees until nearly eighty years after East Carolina already had. Black Elizabeth City State faculty who wanted to earn advanced degrees could not attend the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill until 1951. It was not until March 1965 that the North Carolina governor’s office acknowledged that the state needed to provide compensatory funds for its minority institutions for at least the next fifteen years to make up for the intentional neglect the school had 112 Activism Across the South and Beyond endured from its inception.3 The worst such crisis that directly involved white supremacy, however, took place between 1898 and 1905, when the institution’s very existence was threatened. To survive would require not only planning and persistence, along with some cunning and luck, but also a public espousal of “industrial education,” which reflected a significant shift in institutional mission and pedagogy and reflected a particularly destructive political landscape for Blacks in turn-of-the-century North Carolina. Early Optimism and Success Elizabeth City State Colored Normal School was founded on March 3, 1891, with the passage of a bill written by Hugh Cale, a Black man who represented Pasquotank County in the North Carolina General Assembly. Although normal schools were established primarily so prospective teachers could teach the “norms” of education, these institutions also offered a variety of advanced academic subjects constituting something akin to a liberal arts education. For example, Fayetteville State Colored Normal School, founded in 1877 as the first public normal school for Blacks in North Carolina, offered ancient history, moral and natural philosophy, and Latin.4 Elizabeth City State Colored Normal School opened on January 4, 1892, in a rented building, with thirty-six students and two teachers, one of whom also served as the principal, Peter W. Moore. Born into slavery in 1858 in Sampson County, North Carolina, and raised by his mother after his father’s apparent murder by the Ku Klux Klan, Moore earned an AB degree from Shaw University in 1887. A “modest, patient, scholarly man,” he would become “remarkably courageous and bold” when needed, qualities that would serve the institution well in the coming crisis.5 The school’s objective was, as one state superintendent literally underscored it, to produce “well qualified and thoroughly equipped teachers for the public schools [underlines in original].”6 During the first year, Moore was expected to do all this on barebones appropriations of nine hundred dollars.7 Despite such underfunding, the early years were filled with great success. By September 1893, ninety-five were enrolled, and by 1894, one hundred thirty-six were enrolled, convincing Moore that “the normal has never been so successful in every way. . . .”8 Required reading for the preparatory class was A School History of the Negro Race in America, a textbook written by Edward Austin Johnson..."
