        "text": "Leroy Allen received his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1952. He was the recipient of one of the eleven distinguished alumni citations from the University of Chicago. At the university he was a member of Alpha. Six years later he became the President of Bluefield State College, a historically all black school. He remained in that position for seven years. While in this position, Bluefield held its Sixty-Eighth Commencement exercise for the largest graduating class in the history of the institution; Bluefield received a special assistance grant of $2,000 from the 3M Company to be used to improve the teacher education program at the college. While president, Brother Allen was one of the founders of the Bluefield Area Council on Human Relations. In 1965, after leaving Bluefield, Brother Allen then became the third president of Cheyney State College. He resigned just three years later due to a militant student takeover, which included a three-day takeover of the administration building. Students locked themselves in the administration building in order to call attention to a variety of grievances. State officials promised they would investigate the charges made by the students about the quality of the teaching staff and the insufficient financial resources of the college. Brother Allen resigned due to students’ displeasure with his slow progress in change at the college. Throughout his life, he wrote papers on religious attitudes and the possibilities of integration for public colleges founded for Negroes in a time of desegregation.\n\nRufus Ballard Atwood was born on 15 March 1897 near Hickman, Kentucky. The child of former slaves, Brother Atwood grew up in a racially segregated environment. While his parents had very little education, they encouraged and supported their son’s higher learning. After receiving the top score on an entrance exam, Brother Atwood left Kentucky for Nashville, Tennessee and enrolled in Fisk University in 1915. His studies were interrupted, however, by World War I. On 3 February 1918, Brother Atwood enlisted in the United States Army. Assigned to the signal corps of the all-black 92nd Division, Brother Atwood fought in France with distinction and courage. In 1919, he was awarded a Bronze Star for bravery when he continued to operate a switchboard despite being under heavy artillery fire. After he was discharged, Brother Atwood returned to Fisk University to finish his degree. He graduated in 1920 with a bachelor’s degree in biology.Leaving the South, Brother Atwood decided to pursue another undergraduate degree at Iowa State Agriculture and Mechanical College– now Iowa State University. There he met his future wife, Mabel Campbell, whom he married in 1921. He was a member of the Alpha Nu Chapter of the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity and Mabel was a member of a sorority on campus as well. After graduation from Iowa A&M in 1923, he accepted a position of professor of agriculture at Prairie View State Normal and Industrial College in Texas- now Prairie View A&M University. Shortly thereafter, at the young age of thirty-two, Brother Atwood accepted the position of presidency of Kentucky State College for Colored Persons. When Brother Atwood assumed the presidency, Kentucky State was in serious neglect. The school was in debt with poor facilities, no library access for students, and none of the twenty-seven teachers had earned a Ph.D. He quickly gained the trust and confidence of faculty and students, who were depressed by the leadership of the former president. Despite inheriting the school in the midst of a depression, his youthfulness and determinism in the improvement of the overall conditions proved to both blacks and whites alike that he was determined to establish a positive educational environment at Kentucky State. He quickly set high standards and attracted support for campus improvements through the New Deal’s Public Works Administration and the Julius Rosenwald Fund. Just two years after his arrival, Kentucky State College for Colored Persons became an officially accredited institution and was the state’s only publicly funded black college campus. His tenure there followed the enhancement of both the intellectual and physical environment of the campus throughout his thirty-three-year career. He led the battle for desegregated education in Kentucky beginning in the 1940s, and was the first black awarded the University of Kentucky’s Sullivan Medallion for devoting a “lifetime to the education of young people and… for the advancement of interracial relations.” During the course of his career, he was not blind to the barriers Black students would face; their skills would need to be exceptionally polished in order for them to make a contribution to the society at large. Brother Atwood was disturbed by the preferential treatment given to white schools and this began his long battle for equal educational opportunities for Negroes. He wrote more than a dozen articles relating to issues of black education and equal treatment. One- third of his publications dealt with the black land-grant college, which he believed had been a major force when it came to education. His promotion of black land-grant colleges should come as no surprise since he specialized in agricultural education and was the president of a black land-grant institution. Brother Atwood believed black land-grant colleges needed to develop programs to meet the changing needs of American society, especially following World War II. Additionally, schools like the one he headed also needed to broaden the curriculum and started to include business courses for his students so as not to only teach them vocational skills. During his presidency, Brother Atwood promoted black education by providing distinguished service to several educational committees and organizations. He was president of the Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools for Negroes in 1940 and 1941. Also, was one of the founders of the all-black Mid-Western Athletic Association for which he presided over for nine years. He also belonged to the Association of Negro Land-Grant Colleges.\n\nWaldo William Emerson Blanchet graduated from Talladega College in Alabama with a bachelor’s degree in Science in the 1920s. He then received a master’s and a doctorate’s degree from the University of Michigan. He became a professor at Fort Valley State College (FVSC) in Fort Valley, Georgia in 1932, and pledged his commitment to the school, allegedly saying that he “never wanted to leave.” He served the college for forty-one years as administrative dean, academic dean, head of the science department, and finally, president. He was named president of the college in 1966, serving as president there until 1973. FVSC experienced significant growth under his leadership. Under his presidency, FVSC became one of the first black colleges to join the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. During his time as president, the student body of FVSC doubled to an enrollment of 2500, and several new buildings were built. He presided over intense curriculum development, urging specifically for education in the physical sciences. Brother Blanchet himself taught mandatory physical science courses to all students. He authored an article called “A Study of Natural Science Survey Courses in Negro Colleges,” which he wrote with the intention of improving the function of a college curriculum to be more directive in a student’s life. Brother Blanchet also presided over the college during a turbulent political time. His leadership remained stable over a period of challenges and turbulence. He encouraged FVSC students and faculty to be politically engaged and active, urging them to “make what we have available to the community.” He specifically encouraged students to vote in local elections, which was a challenging decision for many of them. His belief in political activism was closely tied to his admiration of the physical sciences. He argued that both instilled in young people the values of individual growth and self-direction. Brother Blanchet was highly-esteemed in his field, and he received many accolades. In 1957, he became the president of the National Association for Research in Science Teaching and was awarded the fourth science education recognition award given by the National Professional Journal of Science Education. He was also appointed by President Richard Nixon to the National Advisory Council on Education of Disadvantaged Children during the term of 1970 to 1972. Brother Blanchet was a member of the Gamma Zeta chapter of the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. He was one of the founding brothers of the fraternity’s alumni chapters in Georgia, established in 1947. The chapter was composed of brothers from Fort Valley, Montezuma, Macon, and other surrounding middle Georgia counties. Along with the other founding brothers, Brother Blanchet committed to a pledge to keep the House of Alpha strong and to serve as a role model and mentor for the youth and his surrounding community. Brother Blanchet died at age eight-seven in July of 1998 due to cancer and heart failure. He was survived by his wife, Josephine L. Blanchet, his children, Geri and Waldo Jr., and his grandchildren, Natalia and Jeniece. His son, Waldo ,is a dentist who practices in Fort Valley, and his daughter Geri lives in Atlanta. At his memorial, his family asked in lieu of flowers that attendees pledge contributions in his memory to the Fort Valley State University Foundation.\n\nHerman Branson – [See biography under Science and Medicine]\n\nJames P.
