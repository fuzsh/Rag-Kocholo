Looking forward to a year of growth, learning, and achievement together! #Shaw2028 #OrientationDay #HigherEducation\"\n\n#ShawUCommunity | Whether itâ€™s business, housing, education, sports â€” you name it â€” when Black people are provided with the rules of engagement and a legitimate shot, they excel, Operation HOPE Chairman John Hope Bryant insisted during the Freedmanâ€™s Bank Forum Friday in Shaw Universityâ€™s Estey Hall. The forum, an annual event of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, highlighted what the administration of President Joe Biden is doing to increase economic opportunity for communities of color and spotlighted local success stories in and around Raleigh, which was home to one of 19 original Freedmanâ€™s Bank branches.
