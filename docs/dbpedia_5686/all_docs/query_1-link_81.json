Let's start with the basics and explain what Historically Black Colleges and Universities are and what that acronym means before we move on.\n\nWhat is an HBCU?\n\nThe letters “HBCU” are an acronym for Historically Black Colleges and Universities. They are schools that were founded on the belief that every student deserves access to a college or higher education, dating back to the early 1800s.\n\nWhen segregation was legal, these establishments began to take shape and grow. Providing black Americans with opportunities to pursue higher education was a game-changer in their fight to advance economically and socially. Today, students of all races are welcome at historically black colleges.\n\nHow many HBCU schools are there?\n\nA lot of our readers have asked the question, How many HBCUs are there? The US Department of Education has given the HBCU label to 107 schools, both public and private. In 2020, there were 101 accredited black colleges in 19 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Out of the 101 HBCUs, 52 were public schools and 49 were private schools that gave back to the community, according to the National Center for Educational Statistics.\n\nThe Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended defines an HBCU as:\n\n“Any historically black college or university that was established prior to 1964, whose principal mission was, and is, the education of Black Americans, and that is accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency or association determined by the Secretary of Education.”\n\nWhat are the best HBCU colleges in the country?\n\nThe US News HBCU Rankings 2023 list is now available. Visit our HBCU Rankings page to see which HBCUs made the top 25 list and which did not.\n\nWhere are Historically Black Colleges and Universities located?\n\nThere are more HBCUs in the southeastern United States than in any other region on the HBCU colleges list.
