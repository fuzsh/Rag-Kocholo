All approved student and employee ID cards are acceptable statewide for voting.\n\nOnce the State Board approves an institution’s photo ID card, older photo IDs for that institution that are still in circulation are valid for voting, so long as the voter’s ID is valid and unexpired. A photo ID card that has no expiration date is not expired."
