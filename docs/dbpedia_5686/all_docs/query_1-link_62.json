        "text": "My experience has been well I came in as a transfer student. I was offered a full scholarship. The school is on the smaller side, so I felt as if it may be a bit boring or underpopulated, but that wasn’t the case at all always an event or party you can be involved with there is Greek life on campus that often throw events as well as being three minutes from downtown Raleigh, my experience has been well one semester. I’ve been here and I plan to make it even better in the next two years that I have.\n\nMy experience with Shaw has been very good and positive. I can honestly say I enjoy my teachers and the classes. I think overall I enjoy the feeling I get whenever in Shaw's environment. There is a feeling of achievement, success, and goodness that you feel when you walk through the buildings. I love the people and the faculty. They give you a sense of pride. They may you feel like you can achieve anything if you believe. Shaw has so many different people in different races, even though they are a HBCU. There is a rich history there and it is motivating and encouraging. I cannot wait until to see what the future holds."
