        "text": "Shaw University, is the first historically black university in the Southern United States. Shaw is a private liberal arts institution affiliated with the Baptist Church and among the oldest HBCUs in the nation. Founded in 1865, our University has a rich history steeped in tradition, activism and service. We were the first college in North Carolina to offer a four-year medical school; the first institution of higher learning established for freedmen after the Civil War and the first historically Black College in the nation to open its doors to women.\n\nShaw University exists to advance knowledge, facilitate student learning and achievement, to enhance the spiritual and ethical values of its students, and to transform a diverse community of learners into future global leaders.\n\nShaw University is a accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC). With more than 30 academic programs and a 15 to 1 student to faculty ratio, students are sure to find a major that is a perfect fit and a professor that knows them by name. The learning experience at Shaw is based on relationships where the student's voice will be heard and learning becomes personal.\n\nShaw University was founded in 1865 by the American Baptist Home Mission Society of the Baptist Church to provide theological education to freedmen after the Civil War. It is a private, coeducational, liberal arts institution of higher learning with the main campus located in Raleigh, North Carolina, and eight satellite campuses dispersed throughout the state. Shaw University is committed to providing educational opportunities to all segments of society without regard to race, creed, or ethnic origin. However, as the oldest historically African-American university in the south, it has maintained a special interest in the education of minorities from diverse backgrounds, with academic potential for success. Consistent with its motto, Pro Christo et Humanitate (For Christ and Humanity--that religion and learning may go hand in hand, and character grow with knowledge), Shaw University seeks to empower students with a sense of moral purpose based on Christian principles that provide guidance for intellectual and personal growth.\n\nShaw University is committed to the transformative educational process of preparing graduates for citizenship in the twenty-first century workplace and for graduate or professional school, and seeks to instill in its students a philosophy that values lifelong learning, leadership, and service. In order to meet the challenges of a global society, Shaw University endeavors to develop graduates who are broadly educated in the liberal arts and sciences, possessing the knowledge and skills required of all disciplines, and the competencies associated with their chosen fields of study.\n\nStudents who successfully complete undergraduate degree programs at Shaw University will demonstrate proficiency in critical and creative thinking, an ability to communicate effectively, both orally and in writing; proficiency in mathematical reasoning skills, scientific inquiry, technological and information literacy, an awareness of and commitment to ethical judgment, awareness of global issues, knowledge of diverse human cultures, and a commitment to personal and social responsibility. Students enrolled in graduate degree programs will, upon graduation, be able to demonstrate advanced knowledge in their chosen discipline.\n\nThe mission of Shaw University is to advance knowledge, facilitate student learning and achievement, to enhance the spiritual and ethical values of its students, and to transform a diverse community of learners into future global leaders, by providing quality educational programs and services to students that prepare graduates to lead productive lives and successful professional careers as citizens in a globally competitive society.\n\nCentral to the accomplishment of this mission is the recruitment and retention of qualified faculty and staff, who possess the qualifications and expertise to actively support students in the learning process. The University demonstrates its commitment to teaching and learning by providing quality educational programs and services in a safe and supportive learning environment, which meet the needs of students, promotes personal growth and development, and fosters academic achievement and student success. In addition to teaching and learning, Shaw University strives to create and maintain an academic climate that promotes the scholarship of research and the pursuit of new knowledge through active research programs. The University also recognizes its responsibility to instill in students, the importance of making a difference, not only in their own lives, but in the lives of others, by partnering with local communities to provide services that improve the human condition and contribute to the betterment of society.\n\nThe primary purpose of the Student Financial Aid Office is to provide financial assistance to students and parents who family resources are insufficient to meet educational expenses. Financial aid at Shaw University consist of scholarships, grants, loans and jobs awarded singly or in the form of a \"package\" to meet a student's financial need. The factor of need is considered for all forms of financial assistance unless otherwise stipulated. Financial aid is awarded for one year only, upon re-application and demonstrated continued eligibility. The priority deadline for applying for Shaw University administered financial aid is March 1st for the ensuing academic year."
