        "text": "DYK: In 1980, President Jimmy Carter declared the second week of September National HBCU Week.\n\nLet’s take a deep dive into the history of Shaw University, the first historically Black institution of higher education in the South, located right here in Raleigh.\n\nWhat is an HBCU?\n\nHBCU stands for historically Black colleges + universities. The term and acronym first came from the Higher Education Act of 1965, when federal funding was expanded to all universities and colleges. However, the first HBCU was established long before this act was passed.\n\nThe creation of these academic institutions was important since many Black students were denied admission to traditionally white colleges + universities.\n\nShaw is one of the oldest HBCUs in the nation + was founded by Baptist missionary Henry Martin Tupper in 1865. After founding Shaw, Tupper became an instructor and an administrator, and was even the pastor of a church next door.\n\nA few firsts:\n\nShaw is not only the first HBCU in the South, it has collected quite a few other firsts as well.\n\n🥇 The first HBCU in NC to get an A rating from the NC Department of Public Instruction.\n\n🥇 The first college in the nation to offer a four-year medical program.\n\n🥇 The first HBCU to allow women to attend.\n\nFast facts + major milestones\n\nIn 1960, the university established The Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), a student-led grassroots organization dedicated to helping people of color exercise their full rights as citizens.\n\nIn 1997, Shaw conducted a research study to determine why Black World War II veterans were excluded from receiving Medals of Honor, the top military award. As a result of this study, Shaw recommended ten Black soldiers to the Pentagon to receive the award, resulting in seven of the candidates being awarded the Medal of Honor.\n\nIn 2012, Shaw’s women’s basketball team — the Lady Bears — won its first NCAA Division II national championship. This title is the first national championship in the school’s history.\n\nIn 2013, Shaw’s students, staff, faculty, and alumni contributed $133 million to Wake County’s economy.\n\nFast forward to today:\n\nShaw University offers 30+ degree programs, including accredited programs in athletic training, kinesiotherapy, divinity, religious + teacher education, and social work.\n\nSome notable alumni include Gladys Knight, Leonard Moore, and Ella Baker + Dr. Paulette Dillard, who is the university’s 18th President.\n\nQuiz\n\nSorry, you are using an unsupported browser.
