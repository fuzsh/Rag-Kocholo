        "text": "Our Historical Black College and University is among the first in the South devoted to ministerial training and theological education. From the founding of Shaw University in 1865, the idea of Reverend Henry Martin Tupper, an American Baptist minister, was to provide freed slaves training in the areas of teaching, social work, and religious education. As early as 1880, with the assistance of the American Baptist Home Mission Society, Shaw advanced to producing graduates of its theological education courses. By 1900, Shaw was known for awarding ministerial certificates from its institutes for missionary and clergy training, and a Bachelor of Theology degree. During the first half of the 20th Century, Shaw expanded to include a School of Religion that inaugurated and established curricula in religious education, the Shaw University Ministers’ Conference, leadership institutes, Shaw University Theological Fraternity, and a University Chapel. Notable traditions spawned in that era include the Annual Ministers’ Conference and Black Church Leadership Academy. In 1961, the School of Religion became Shaw Divinity School, offering the Master of Divinity degree, preparing students to serve, especially within the African American church, community, and non-profit sector as a state-chartered school. In 1974, Shaw University Divinity School launched the Alexander-Peques Pastors’ Conference. By 2002, the Shaw Divinity School remerged with Shaw University as Shaw University Divinity School, accredited by the Association of Theological Schools, and relocated back to the campus in the historic Leonard Building, which is the site of the nation’s first four-year graduate medical school, training primarily African Americans.\n\nShaw University Divinity School promotes quality theological education and leadership training through conferences and the Black Church Leadership Academy. For over 90 years, Shaw University Divinity School has grounded its missional call with Pro Christo et Humanitate (For Christ and Humanity) as religious learning and social activism. Shaw University Divinity School, partnering with the General Baptist State Convention of North Carolina, American Baptist Churches of the South, and others, prepares those with a calling to serve in church, academia, non-profit, and the marketplace by equipping them with high-quality theological and educational learning opportunities. While one can still earn a Master of Divinity degree for pastoral ministry, we offer an accredited Master of Arts degree designed to assist adult learners with a customized approach to ministerial applications in ministry so that they can make a difference in their respective communities. Shaw University Divinity School has strategically positioned itself with partners in multiple sectors of society to provide an optimal learning experience with lasting relationships through a network of alumni and constituencies."
