        "text": "Shaw University, Raleigh, is a private, historically black liberal arts university affiliated with the United Methodist Church. It’s among the oldest institutions of higher learning in Raleigh, North Carolina, and was founded in 1865 by Henry Martin Tupper.\n\nThough it is not situated in downtown Raleigh, Shaw is a values-based learning community of outstanding students, ambitious professors, and caring staff. The University educates its students to become valuable contributors to the world.\n\nHistory\n\nDr. Henry Tupper founded Shaw University in 1865 in Raleigh, North Carolina, after the end of the world Civil War. The school was initially called ‘Raleigh Institute’ but changed its name to Shaw University in 1871 in honor of Elija Shaw, a philanthropist who funded the institution’s construction.\n\nShaw University was founded as a theological class for freedmen. Dr. Tupper realized that newly-freed people needed more than just theology classes, so he expanded the school into a full university with departments in law and medicine.\n\nSince its inception, Shaw has been at the forefront of racial equality in higher education. The university continues to play a significant role in educating students worldwide.\n\nIt’s currently an HBCU (Historically Black College/University) with around 1152 undergraduate students across different schools and programs, including:\n\nBusiness Administration\n\nHealth Sciences & Social Work\n\nLiberal Arts & Sciences\n\nMusic & Performing Arts\n\nParks & Recreation Management\n\nPublic Safety Administration\n\nEngineering Technology\n\nCriminal Justice\n\nNursing\n\nPharmacy\n\nEducation\n\nSocial Work\n\nThe Southern Association of Colleges and Schools accredited the University. It was also the first to enroll women and offer 4 years of medical education in North Carolina.\n\nShaw University Achievements\n\nThe institution offers undergraduate and graduate degrees in various subjects. It also offers multiple certificate programs for students interested in specific career paths. Shaw University has a long history of achievements and accomplishments.\n\nIn 1870, Shaw University became the first US college to offer a bachelor’s degree to an African American.\n\nShaw is best known for being the first accredited black land-grant college in the South. But it has also been a pioneer in the women’s movement and interracial cooperation. Shaw University is the oldest HBCU in the South and one of the oldest institutions of higher learning in North Carolina.\n\nThe educational institution has been ranked among the top HBCUs in the nation by US News & World Report. Its academic tradition dates back to its founding as a Freedmen’s School by the American Baptist Home Mission Society.\n\nIn the fall of 2011, Shaw University won a 5-year grant from the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. The partnership involves students from both schools and provides them with opportunities to gain experience through community service projects.\n\nShaw University has also received grants to support its Nanoscience and Nanotechnology program’s recent studies and research. The grant is part of Shaw’s commitment to providing students with high-quality science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education.\n\nThe institution is known for being an academic leader and a player in other activities. If you are considering university enrollment in Raleigh, NC, Shaw university is a good option.\n\nGIV Mobile IV Therapy – Raleigh"
