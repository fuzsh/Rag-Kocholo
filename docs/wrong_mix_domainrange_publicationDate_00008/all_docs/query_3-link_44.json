        "text": "Dan Brown has made his mark in literature as arguably one of the greatest writers and best-selling authors the world has seen in recent times. Brown has mastered the art of suspense, with each of his thrillers revealing shocking ends entwined in webs of conspiracy and cryptic mystery.\n\nHe rose to the spotlight after he published ‘The Da Vinci Code,’ a novel that shook the Christian world, triggered a lot of questions about faith, and led to his feature in the 100 Most Influential People in the World by TIME Magazine in 2005.\n\nFamous Books by Dan Brown\n\n‘Digital Fortress’ is officially the first book by Dan Brown. It was published in 1998 and although it had an interesting plot, it did not do well in the markets since Brown was still transitioning into being a novelist and had not fully understood what sold in the industry yet. It is one of the only two books by Brown that are not part of the Langdon series.\n\n‘Angels and Demons’ published in 2000 is the first book in the Robert Langdon book series. This is where we first meet Harvard professor and Symbology expert Robert Langdon who together with physicist Leonardo Vetra must fight to stop the Illuminati from destroying the Vatican City.\n\n‘Deception Point’ was published in 2001 and even though is frequently overlooked because it falls outside of the Robert Langdon books series; it is still one of the most popular books by Dan Brown. The story follows White House intelligence analyst Rachel Sexton as she finds herself in a conflicted position after discovering that NASA’s discovery of extraterrestrial life carries with it a series of conspiracies and murders.\n\n‘The Da Vinci Code’ published in 2003 takes the top spot as the most famous book published by Dan Brown. The Da Vinci Code was extremely popular and was a worldwide bestseller. As of 2009, it had sold over 80 million copies and has been translated into over 44 languages. This feat has undoubtedly set Brown apart from other novelists. The book also went on to cast its spotlight on its predecessors, also putting them on the bestseller list.\n\n‘The Lost Symbol’ published in 2009 follows Langdon as he uncovers a trail of clues that will lead him to his kidnapped mentor and a member of the Free Mason.\n\nBrown released the book after taking a six-year hiatus from writing. The suspenseful wait definitely contributed to the sales as it broke sales records by selling over one million hardcover versions on its first day of release.\n\n‘Inferno’ published in 2013 is one of the least favourites in the Langdon series. It begins with Harvard professor of symbology Robert Langdon finding himself in an Italian hospital and spirals into a chaos of events that must lead Langdon to stop a mad scientist and his followers who want to end the world with a deadly virus.\n\n‘Origin’ is the most recent novel by Dan Brown and his latest addition to the Langdon series. The book published in 2017 was top-rated as it spent some time on the number one spot of The New York Times bestseller list.\n\nThis book is set in Spain, and it follows Robert Langdon when he is invited to the Guggenheim Museum to see an amazing discovery that will change the face of science.\n\nEarly Life and Education\n\nDan Brown, a native New Englander, was born in Exeter, New Hampshire, on June 22, 1964. He attended the prestigious Phillips Exeter Academy preparatory school, where his father taught mathematics. His mother was a musician, specializing in sacred Christian religious music.\n\nDue to the contrasting backgrounds of his parents, Brown developed an interest in both mathematics—including number puzzles and codes—and religion, and also understood the differences and tension between religion and science which would be one of the motivations that lead him to write the Da Vinci Code.\n\nAfter graduating from high school in 1982, Brown attended Amherst College in Massachusetts, from which he graduated with a major in English and Spanish in 1986. Following his experience as a singer in university, Brown attempted to enter the music business by creating a children’s cassette and later released a CD.\n\nSoon after moving to Los Angeles, where he joined the National Academy of Songwriters, he met his future wife, Blythe Newlon. The two soon moved back to New Hampshire where they would marry four years later.\n\nLiterary Career\n\nLegacy\n\nDan Brown has gained immense popularity and appreciation worldwide for his thriller novels. His books have themes that mainly encompass conspiracy theories, treasure, and secret organizations.\n\nOne of the greatest aspects of Dan Brown’s books is the historical elements. He has also redefined the use of the setting while writing. He is able to transport his reader to whatever location he is writing about through very detailed descriptions.\n\nDespite the backlash he received for ‘The Da Vinci Code,’ the book undeniably achieved his aim which was to bring about more conversations regarding faith, and he will forever be remembered as the man whose book shook the modern Christian world.\n\nLiterature by Dan Brown\n\nExplore literature by Dan Brown below, created by the team at Book Analysis."
