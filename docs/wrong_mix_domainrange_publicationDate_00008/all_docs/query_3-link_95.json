        "text": "Courtesy of Boniface B. Omina, I, at last, got the opportunity to dive into Brown's 'blockbuster perfection'. The Da Vinci Code is a piece I've heard people swear by a suspicious number of times (wink to a day in Yetunde's class, sharing our favourite books instead of Projects-ing). When my dear friend and creative inspiration offered me this copy, I was thrilled (pun unintended).\n\nThe first thing that struck me about this story - and what roused me to write this article - was how, just, likeable Brown's main character is. I frankly expected some grumpy, Sherlock-style genius breezing through the mystery without so much as one sentiment for us rattled readers.\n\nInstead, Robert Langdon turned out to be a vulnerable and empathetic gentleman, who never flinched before admitting he hadn't a clue what was happening.\n\nFollowing his grapples with the twisted turns of History (capital H for reasons you'd understand reading the book), I saw my emotions reel from terror and confusion to bundles of love for all the choices I witnessed. Trust a Coursera-certified creative writer, I would 100% recommend this read.\n\nBeyond its author's mastery of his craft (no but really, I've rarely encountered such well-written fiction), the piece stands apart through all the #humanity it serves. I've talked about Langdon, but every damn last character in this novel proved a nuanced, 3-dimensional person who rendered Brown's work not only great but also believable. I spent days burying my face in the man's tome, furiously scanning the pages to hang out with his clique of nerds and fanatics.\n\nOf course, I was also losing too much sleep on the curiosity he skillfully fed.\n\nDo inbox me if you decide to hop on Langdon and Sophie's topsy-turvy adventure! I laughed, gasped, and watched as questions I'd never even thought of contemplating bloomed in my mind.\n\nHopefully, you do too."
