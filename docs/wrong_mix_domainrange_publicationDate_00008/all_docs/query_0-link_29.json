Brown’s novels have been published worldwide in 56 languages with over 200 Million copies in print.\n\nIn 2005, Brown was named one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World by TIME Magazine, whose editors credited him with “keeping the publishing industry afloat; renewed interest in Leonardo da Vinci and early Christian history; spiking tourism to Paris and Rome; a growing membership in secret societies; the ire of Cardinals in Rome; eight books denying the claims of the novel and seven guides to read along with it; a flood of historical thrillers; and a major motion picture franchise.”\n\nThe son of a mathematics teacher and a church organist, Brown was raised on a prep school campus where he developed a fascination with the paradoxical interplay between science and religion. These themes eventually formed the backdrop for his books. Brown is a graduate of Amherst College and Phillips Exeter Academy, where he later returned to teach English before focusing his attention full time to writing. He lives in New England with his yellow lab, Winston.\n\nSimon Friend is an independent theatre and film production company developing, producing, and managing all of their own productions, winning Academy Awards, BAFTAs, Olivier Awards, Tony Awards, UK Theatre, and Critics’ Circle Awards.
