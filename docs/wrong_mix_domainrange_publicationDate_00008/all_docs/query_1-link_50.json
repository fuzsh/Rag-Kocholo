        "text": "On a recommendation from Quicktidal and after spotting them on various bestseller lists for a while, i picked up a couple of James Rollins' Sigma Force books a while back and finally got on with reading them recently.\n\nFirst up was SANDSTORM. I liked this, i didn't love it.\n\nA ball of lightning detonates an old mummy's coffin which leads to america's commando scientists Sigma Force and a few involved bystanders chasing around the world to solve the mystery. Naturally there's an evil force competing with them in a race to find the widgit stuff. Yes, it's as trite as that but Rollins writes a REALLY great action scene and does the exotic locale very well and that carried me along even when I felt like I had read this before. It's kind of a mash up of Dan Brown and Clive Cussler at their respective bests (as opposed to at their latter day 'you idiots will buy any crap i write stages, but i digress...).\n\nThe characters were fairly archetypical but well done enough.\n\nMy only real complaint SPOILER SPOILER\n\nSPOILER MAJOR BIG EVIL\n\nWILL RUIN THE BOOK SPOILER\n\nSPOILER\n\nSpoiler\n\nwas that Rollins basically retreated to 'magic' to explain everything the Sisterhood did, and in a series that purports to be based in science this was just lame. There was some vague attempt to sciencify the 'sperm-free reporduction', the teleporting and whatever else but really it read thin. Not enough to put me off the book, but weak.\n\nWhich brings us to MAP OF BONES. The second Sigma novel and the one i just finished...\n\nDamn fun book. Better characters, crazy action scenes (seriously - there's a gunfight/chase through a cathedral involving a flamethrower that's just nuts and I grinned every time a certain character sat down to drive something), overall better widget search with a lot of very very neat history and conspiracy theory thrown in.\n\nGray Pierce succeeds Painter Crow as team leader here and Rollins does a nice job of showing him learning the ropes of leadership without beating the reader senseless with faux emo conflict. the rest of the characters are good fun. Kat in particular steals scene after scene.\n\nSPOILERS SPOILERS WE THREE KINGS WILL BEAT YOU SENSELESS WITH FRANKINSENSE AND MYRRH IF YOU READ THESE SPOILERS HEY WTF IS MYRHH ANYWAYS SPOILERS\n\nSPOILERS\n\nSpoiler\n\nI enjoyed how the Guild, opposition in SANDSTORM, were more ambiguous in this book, working both sides and even helping the good guys at times.\n\nThe speculative sciene was in full swing and it never drifted into pure fiction the way it did in the last book.\n\nAnd seriously, you could almost feel Rollins setting up yet another scene where Kat stabs someone in the face and it was a total kick every time it happened.\n\nGood series in a thinking Hollywood Blockbuster in book form way. people who loved Brown's Angels and Demons but disliked The Lost Symbol, anyone whose enjoyed Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels and anyone who kind of wishes Indiana Jones was a spy should enjoy these.\n\n- Abyss, fan of the killer commando spy scientists.\n\nCommando scientists\n\ni haven't read his rollins pseudonym books.\n\ni read his james clemens books : shadowfall and hinterland.\n\nboth great books, very original, great reads for fantasy lovers.\n\nsounds similar to matthew reilly then - i'm thinking Temple rather than the scarecrow books - would that be right?\n\nMatt Reilly is AWFUL compared to Rollins. I avoid him like the plague.\n\nAs far as I am concerned, Rollins' Sigma thrillers have become a \"buy them in Hardcover the day they come out\" now for me. I have them in first editions since The Judas Strain first came out.\n\nLike Abyss said, the characters are super fun....Gray really is a better leader than Painter was (though I find that Painter works well in his *ahem* latter role) and Monk and Kat are great fleshed out characters. The action is well paced and assembled, and Rollins is quite deft at keeping things VERY interesting throughout.\n\nI think part of what lends Rollins his excellent scientific background and credibility is his veterinary practice and medical background. Besides which, he is a spellunker and an avid traveler off the beaten path, which I think lends him far more of an edge in the genre than, let's say Dan Brown (whose last book The Lost symbol made my eyes friggin bleed like Goodkind).\n\nAnyways. Want a good historical/adventure thriller? Read Rollins. The man writes one rollicking adventure after another.\n\nOh, and Abyss...two words for you for THE JUDAS STRAIN..... Joe Kowalski. Trust me. That is all.\n\nThis post has been edited by QuickTidal: 09 September 2010 - 01:41 AM\n\nI was going to ask how this guy compares to Matthew Reilly as well. Cos Reilly's stuff is pretty bad. I've read several of them against my better judgement, when i didn't have access to anything else, cos at least they were a very quick read.\n\nI may have to check out Rollins as another quick read alternative.\n\nMatthew Reilly's stuff is good for what it is: a quick, easy fun read that hits the spot. Great airport novels. Not in any way literature, but frankly who cares?\n\nMight keep an eye out for the Rollins titles. Looked at the Clemens stuff but it didn't grab me.\n\nThis post has been edited by Sombra: 09 September 2010 - 11:21 AM\n\nSombra, on 09 September 2010 - 11:20 AM, said:\n\nMatthew Reilly's stuff is good for what it is: a quick, easy fun read that hits the spot. Great airport novels. Not in any way literature, but frankly who cares?\n\nMight keep an eye out for the Rollins titles. Looked at the Clemens stuff but it didn't grab me.\n\nDefinitely check out Rollins Sigma books. Well worth it.\n\nYeah, I think my problem with Matt Reilly is about like this: (below is my review of Reilly's book The Seven Deadly Wonders)\n\nSigh.\n\n150 pages. That's all I could manage. I gave this book every effort. Alas, I could not finish it. This book has an interesting idea for it's plot. Take the Seven Wonders Of The Ancient World, connect them (Giza Pyramid Capstone pieces), and then have teams hunt for these lost wonders one by one. Good idea right? Of course. Sounds amazing. The Seven Wonders themselves are so completely fascinating, how on earth could this book go astray right?\n\nWell, easily. It's unfortunately VERY poorly written. Reilly really DOES make someone like Clive Cussler (who writes middle-of-the-road historical adventure that is SOMETIMES entertaining) look like freakin' Dickens.\n\nBefore I go on, let me say that I LOVE historical/adventure books. Love them. James Rollins, Dan Brown, Michael Crichton and Steve Berry even to a certain extent.\n\nLet's be clear, this book is written as if from the perspective of a kid describing his buddy playing a video game. Perhaps an 11 year old kid. I mean, the unnecessary punctuation (!!!!!), the EXCESSIVE diagrams, okay I get that you are trying to show me what you just spent a paragraph describing...but then why did you explain it to me. Why then didn't it just say: Jack West enters the long stone walled room and then (See Diagram 1a). Seriously. Half the book is diagrams. There is zero character development. I don't care even a little bit about anyone in this book. Oh, and as another reviewer said, there is WAY too much implausibility in this book even insofar as the plot. Too many things fit neatly into place. Oh, and don't get me started on apparently immortal crocodiles.\n\nWhereas in contrast someone who is GOOD at this type of genre fiction like James Rollins makes me care even about a girl who dies in the prologue.\n\nMatthew Reilly is NOT an author that I will ever choose to subject myself to again I think. Thankfully his other books don't sound like my cup of tea anyways.\n\nI haven't read Reilly so i can't speak to his work. Dan Brown is all over the place from the brilliant (Angels and Demons) to the bad (Digital Fortress) to the semi-decent (Da Vinci Code, Deception Point) to the eye bleeding (The Lost Marketing Opportunity).\n\nCussler... Cussler's books, if you read them in the order they were written, they steadily improve until he hits a high point with Sahara and then his later work should really just be ignored.\n\nAt this point, i'm enjoying Rollins way more than I did anything by Brown except Angels & Demons) and most of Cussler.\n\nOh, and Raymond Khoury is another alt-hist-fic-action writer to avoid like the plague. The Last Templar was so bad my brain started to bleed out through my ears.\n\nOkay, this is a heads up for those who read Rollins...so for me and Abyss I guess...LOL\n\nWith the release of THE DEVIL COLONY (the latest Sigma Force book) this July on the horizon....Today Rollins has released an eBook short story starring Seichan (THE SKELETON KEY) that includes clues to things that happen in the new book and even an excerpt.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.co...05310667&sr=8-1\n\nTHE DEVIL COLONY is one of the books I am looking fwd to most this summer (since it was delayed by the publisher for optimum release date money-making), and I totally forgot he was writing a short piece starring Seichan, so colour me excited.\n\nAlso. The eBook is 99 cents! SOLD!\n\nJust finished BLACK ORDER...\n\nIt was fine. At times briefly great, but overall just good. MAP OF BONES was way better.\n\nMy problems with this book lie in its predictability (failed to surprise me even once), its falling back on 'isn't that conveeeeeenient' too many times (\"We're all dead! wait, who's that suddenly here in time to save us!\")and that fact that major point in the climax is resolved, more or less\n\nSpoiler\n\nby the power of love\n\n. As well, a major sideplot that appeared more interesting than the main one -\n\nSpoiler\n\nKat and Logan at the S/African embassy - after MAP i really really WANT to see more of Kat stabbing people in the faceparts\n\n- takes place entirely offscreen.\n\nI don't mean to be overly negative, because it was good enough to carry me through to the end and the characters were still solid, with one new addition stealing every scene she's in, but compared to the previous two, this book didn't pack the same punch.\n\nQuicktidal assures me that the next one JUDAS STRAIN is vastly superior so no fear, Rollins' next two commando scientist books stay in my TRP to be picked up in the near future.\n\nAbyss, on 21 June 2011 - 02:51 PM, said:\n\nJust finished BLACK ORDER...\n\nIt was fine.

You just wait.\n\nThree: Did you know that sporadic Sigma characters have shown up in his other non-sigma work here and there (Susan is in DEEP FATHOM and a character you meet in JUDAS is in ICE HUNT).\n\nAlso, today THE DEVIL COLONY is released, and I am so excited that I am starting to wonder if I'll put my current read (LEVIATHAN WAKES) on hold to start it right away or not....\n\nThis post has been edited by QuickTidal: 21 June 2011 - 03:24 PM\n\nQuickTidal, on 21 June 2011 - 03:23 PM, said:\n\n...Two: Re: Kat...oh just you wait sir. You just wait.\n\nOh thank god. i would read an entire book by Rollins that amounted to a thinly veiled plot to give Kat excuses to stab people in the face in new and interesting ways. ORDER was poorer for the lack of her.\n\nQuote\n\nThree: Did you know that sporadic Sigma characters have shown up in his other non-sigma work here and there (Susan is in DEEP FATHOM and a character you meet in JUDAS is in ICE HUNT).\n\nYah, there was a passing ref to DEEP early in ORDER that i caught, tho i think it was Lisa, not Susan. As it happens, under the Sigma books the TRP also has DEEP, SUBTERRANEAN and the ICE book all standing by.\n\nQuote\n\nAlso, today THE DEVIL COLONY is released, and I am so excited that I am starting to wonder if I'll put my current read (LEVIATHAN WAKES) on hold to start it right away or not....\n\nRollins' books appear in rediculous numbers in second hand stores with great frequency, hence why i had about 7 in the TRP by the time i was halfway through SANDSTORM. I still have at least six to get through but no doubt i'll get to COLONY eventually, altho based on your raves he may move up the priority list as i advance through his books if he keeps getting better.\n\nOkay, so I finished the latest one THE DEVIL COLONY last night. I'll be putting a full review up at the site later today, but a few thoughts in the meantime.\n\nIt's good. It's thicker than I think all of his other books (clocks in at nearly 480 pages). It's not GREAT, merely good. It's a bit better than BLACK ORDER, but it sadly can't touch stuff like THE JUDAS STRAIN or MAP OF BONES. I think the biggest issue is that he adds a bunch of side-character plots that, while they have do with the Sigma stuff in various ways, kind of take you away from Sigma goodness. So what should be a tight little Sigma book is kind of like a Sigma book with too many characters in disparate places and it all feels more loose and spread out. So whereas one of the best scenes in MAP OF BONES\n\nSpoiler\n\nwhen the team is going from that speedboat under the water into that tight cramped tomb ect together....\n\nwe have nothing like that here sadly, at least not at that level of tension. I never feared for Gray and Co. That's a bad thing. I should FEAR for the commando scientists.\n\nThe only other ting I'd like to mention as a failing here is the same non-author complaint I had with THE LOST SYMBOL....America's heritage and founding is just not interesting enough, nor is it ancient enough to really go as deep into the unkown as I'd like. That's a personal complaint though and likely won't bother others like it does me.\n\nMake no mistake though as there is some heavy cool stuff going on in this book, and the pace is as relentless as it is always. The writing is fantastic as per usual and it's still thrilling. I think I just feel a little let down after the last outing THE DOOMSDAY KEY was such a tight little nail biter!\n\nRanking:\n\nMAP OF BONES\n\nTHE JUDAS STRAIN\n\nTHE DOOMSDAY KEY\n\nSANDSTORM\n\nTHE LAST ORACLE\n\nTHE DEVIL COLONY\n\nBLACK ORDER\n\nNoted. On the bright side that leaves me really psyched for JUDAS and DOOSMDAY.\n\nSome of your comments echo some of the things i didn't love about SANDSTORM. The non-Sigma characters were generally less interesting and detracted from what i really wanted to read about.\n\nCuriously, the non-Sigma pov characters in BLACK ORDER were some of the better parts of the book, Fiona in particular.\n\nAbyss, on 24 June 2011 - 02:16 PM, said:\n\nNoted.

Like there is a professor in THE DOOMSDAY KEY who is one of the best parts of the book...but I think those characters only really rock if Rollins really wants them to rock. In DEVIL they are there because they need to be there in one capacity or another and not because they should be...if that makes any sense.\n\nI don't want to put you off it though, as it' still a fun ride. He seems to hit more often than he misses, but he still misses the middle of the target on occasion.\n\nThis post has been edited by QuickTidal: 24 June 2011 - 02:22 PM\n\nLatest Sigma Force title (and synopsis) are out!\n\nBLOODLINE\n\nSynopsis (non-spoiler, don't worry)\n\nScreen shot 2011-12-20 at 11.53.20 AM.png (78.14K)\n\nNumber of downloads: 0\n\nJust finished THE JUDAS STRAIN.\n\nWARNING SPOILERS BELOW HERE SPOILERS SPOILERS FOR\n\nTHE JUDAS STRAIN SPOILERS CANNIBALLISTIC ZOMBIE RAGE SPOILERS\n\nTHAT WILL SPOIL YOU EAT YOU SPIT YOU OUT AND\n\nINFECT YOU WITH THEIR SPOILERY VIRUS\n\nSPOILERS\n\nSPOILERS\n\nJUDAS STRAIN\n\nSPOILERS\n\nI hate to send you into paroxysm QT, but i didn't love this book.

I'll probably read DEEP FATHOM next to get Lisa's backstory before moving on to whatever's next for Sigma.\n\nPerhaps it's that I'd never read any of those plot points before that I liked it as much as I do? I liked all that be3cause I'd never read any of that kind of stuff before. I've only read one Dirk Pitt book and it was only so-so.\n\nI also am utterly, endlessly fascinated by Angkor Wat AND the bhagavad gita (the 700-verse Hindu Holy book) and how it ties into ancient Asian societies as well as Indian ones... so that helps with the love.\n\nSorry you didn't think too much of it man.\n\nAbove and beyond that, you should probably know that Kat doesn't do a lot of action anymore as the series progresses. Seichan basically takes that distinction away from her (ass kicking chick in tight pants)...but I like that change personally.\n\nAnd if you tell me that you didn't think Monk VS island of giant monster crabs wasn't awesome, you are cold and dead inside sir!\n\nAlso, giant glowing squids!\n\nQuickTidal, on 24 January 2012 - 05:51 PM, said:\n\n...And if you tell me that you didn't think Monk VS island of giant monster crabs wasn't awesome, you are cold and dead inside sir!\n\nAlso, giant glowing squids!\n\nThe crabs were hardly giant, altho i grant that was totally one of Monk's moments of awesome.\n\nAnd the squid were merely 'big'. And glowing.\n\nCussler's Dirk Pitt stuff is somewhat similar to Rollins' Signma Force. Special semi-secret gov scientist commandos chase ancient clues to save world from evil and sometimes eco-disaster. The first ten or so, from RAISE THE TITANIC up to SAHARA, are brilliant once you gte past Pitt as a thinly veiled author-analogue. After that the series becomes repetitious and then self-satirical. But it does explain to an extent my lack of engagement and I still thought the pacing was slower than previous books. the action was good but there wasn't quite enough of it, perhaps. And Grey's ancient parents running around didn't consitute action, nor did most of Lisa's storyline up until Monk shows up to the rescue.\n\nIt wasn't crap, far from it parts were still fun, but not my fave of the series."
