        "text": "My Views on Inferno\n\nIt kept me actually at the edge of my seat, wide-eyed, reading through and between the lines with a growing anxiety and my head is still spinning after reading it.\n\nIf I could, I would give it 10 stars right away because nothing made me frighten and think hard like this!! A must read to dwell in Dante’s hell with an unexpected turn of events and yes, the most important part – to learn about the imminent danger of population explosion looming large over our extinction. Dan Brown is stupendous!\n\nMy Favorite Nuggets of Wisdom\n\nI am the shade. Through the dolent city, I flee. Through the eternal woe, I take flight.\n\nThe decision of our past are the architects of our present.\n\nKnow only your own mission. Share nothing.\n\nThe truth can be glimpsed only through the eyes of death.\n\nKeep swimming through the tunnel… pray for light.\n\nNothing is more creative nor destructive than a brilliant mind with a purpose.\n\nThe darkest places in hell are reserved for those who maintain their neutrality in times of moral crisis.\n\nUntil a man is nothing, God can make nothing out of him!\n\nFind me on Quora:\n\nhttps://www.quora.com/profile/Khyati-Gautam\n\nFind me on Twitter:"
