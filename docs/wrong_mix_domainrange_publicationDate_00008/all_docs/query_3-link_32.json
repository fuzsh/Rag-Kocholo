        "text": "I haven't read the book myself but I learned that Dan Brown mentioned Manila here in a very negative light.\n\nIn \"Inferno,\" the fourth part in Harvard art professor Robert Langdon&#8217;s adventures, one of the characters goes through \"the gates of hell\" in Manila.\n\nThe description of the city is from the first-hand account of one of the fictional characters, the messianic Dr. Sienna Brooks.\n\nBrooks, who has been working with humanitarian groups, went to the Philippines for a mission to supposedly feed poor fishermen and farmers on the countryside.\n\nShe expected the Philippines to be a &#8220;wonderland of geological beauty, with vibrant seabeds and dazzling plains.&#8221;\n\nUpon setting foot in Manila, however, Brooks could only \"gape in horror\" as \"she had never seen poverty on this scale.\"\n\nShe said her &#8220;dark depression&#8221; flooded back, with pictures of poverty and crime flashing through her eyes.\n\n&#8220;For every one person Sienna fed, there were hundreds more who gazed at her with desolate eyes,&#8221; the book read.\n\nOne after the other, the book described chaotic Manila: \"six-hour traffic jams, suffocating pollution, horrifying sex trade.\"\n\nThe book described the sex industry as consisting mostly of young children &#8220;many of whom had been sold to pimps by parents who took solace in knowing that at least their children would be fed.&#8221;\n\n&#8220;All around her, she could see humanity overrun by its primal instinct for survival&#8230;When they face desperation&#8230;human beings become animals,&#8221; the book read.\n\nThe book went on to detail a turning point in Brooks&#8217; life. &#8220;I&#8217;ve run through the gates of hell,&#8221; she said.\n\nTraumatized, Brooks &#8220;left the Philippines at once, without even saying goodbye to the other members of the group.&#8221;\n\nsource: http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/lifestyle/05/21/13/dan-brown-calls-manila-gates-hell-novel\n\nNow this REALLY OFFENDS ME. Again, I need to read the actual text but here are my impressions so far.\n\n1. I would agree that Manila is one of the worst cities and I hate going in that city. But the six-hour traffic jam is NOT true. THAT'S EXAGGERATED.\n\n2. Manila is a big city, there are poor areas, and there are business districts. I have the list of all depressed areas and the make less than a fifth of Manila.\n\n3. I would agree that there are rapists, pickpockets, child prostitution in the Philippines, but it's not the type that will slam to your face as soon as you set foot in the country.\n\n4. MANILA DOESN'T REPRESENT THE PHILIPPINES- it's a beautiful place with beaches and islands and culturally diverse people. ONE OF THE WORST PLACES IS MANILA GET THE F- OUT OF MANILA IF YOU HATE IT\n\n5. Yes, Philippines is a very poor nation, but it's mostly income poverty and extreme poverty is minimal. There are cases of malnutrition here but none ever died here of starvation. If Dan Brown wants to see extreme poverty where people die of starvation GET OUT OF MY COUNTRY\n\n6. Ever heard of volunteers being gang-raped and slaughtered here? Well I'm sure they exist but how many traumatized charity workers exit this country because it's so terrible?\n\n*RAGE*\n\nI've yet to read the book to form an opinion, but from the looks of it this just seems like the usual 'Westerner goes to an exotic part of the world for a mission and thinks it's a shithole' case, as I've seen/read so many times before. There might be a hint of truth in it, as the author might be projecting personal experience/ has done good research but I understand how people might find it offensive.\n\nAnyway, Manila may not be the prettiest place to some. It is what it is. Traffic jams, pollution and crime everywhere. Even as a local I was scared to set foot in that place, though overtime I was able to go there alone and trek the crowded streets of Quiapo* alone (the place for pirated films ). I just kept in mind to walk fast and keep away from people, as it's a known modus of thieves to slash your bag (or you) for valuables.\n\nAnd yes some parts of Manila are very different from what I described. Generally Philippines is a poverty-stricken place with third world problems but I don't believe it's a total shithole, no.\n\n*Danseru, is the place still running or has Lim successfully wiped it out?"
