        "text": "REALM OF LIGHT\n\nFIRST EDITION PUBLISHER’S NOTE (1931)\n\nThe “Realm of Light” is the Sixth Volume of the American Edition of Nicholas Roerich’s Works. The first volume was “Adamant”; the second, “Altai-Himalaya”; the third, “Flame in Chalice”; the fourth, “Heart of Asia”; the fifth, “Shambhala.”\n\nThe general device of these Books, multifarious in their contents yet united in their inner striving, is The Call to Culture. And by his term “Realm of Light” the author signifies the human heart.\n\nTruly, it is a privilege to publish Roerich’s evocation to Beauty, to Knowledge and Culture. The countries where Nicholas Roerich pursues his endless activities may verily pride themselves on his great creative contributions to Beauty and Culture.\n\nIt is of exceptional significance that, through the Societies dedicated to him in all continents, the name of Nicholas Roerich is so universally proclaimed and impressed upon human hearts, not only as Master of the brush but also as a thinker and a builder of life. In studying the Biography of Roerich one is confronted by a great chain of real, indisputable facts. Through his indefatigable creativeness, his daily labor and achievements, Roerich acquires in universal measure that synthesis which reconciles and solves the most difficult problems. Mark what subtle psychology and benevolent compassion is suffused through his addresses to the Societies bearing his name. He never disparages—on the contrary, his emphasis everywhere is on the most positive, creative foundations.\n\nThese volumes, covering the complete editions of Roerich’s works in English, may be justly called missals of the rites of Culture. In one of his addresses, the author asks: “In what country do you desire to live?” His answer is: “Certainly in the country of Culture.” And for Roerich himself, such a country is not an abstraction but an immutable possibility and a beautiful necessity for humanity.\n\nIt is but natural that this vital call to Culture has attracted multitudes of followers to Roerich. His Banner of Peace is truly an Oriflamme of invincible Culture around which the all-constructive and positive elements may gather without differences. If Roerich has his enemies, let us recall how in his evocations, he names the insatiate enemy of all light-imparting aspiration—the homunculus of ignorance. He regards ignorance as the most heinous crime; but he welcomes with an all-containing benevolent cordiality everything which indicates the striving towards Knowledge.\n\nThe author says: “Let us abandon the past for the future. Let us impel our entire consciousness into the future and let us suffuse it with radiance, for this is within the access of humanity.”\n\nRoerich presents his book for the Fund of the Biochemical Laboratory of the Himalayan Research Institute, founded by Roerich in 1928. To the same Common Welfare of humanity is dedicated also his all-embracing thought for the remedial and salutary foundations of man’s evolution.\n\nCONTENTS\n\nFirst Edition Publisher’s Note\n\nRealm Of Light\n\nCulture\n\nThe Beautiful\n\nSpiritual Treasures\n\nTransfiguration Of Life\n\nTo Womanhood\n\nRoots Of Culture\n\nCollecting\n\nWisdom Of Joy\n\nThe Careful Keeper\n\nHealth\n\nMaster Virgo Inter Virgines\n\nLegends\n\nBurning Of Darkness\n\nBanner Of Peace\n\nPeace Pact Conference In Bruges\n\nBanner Of Peace\n\nGreetings To The Bruges Conference\n\nInauguration Of The French Roerich Society In Paris, 1929\n\nSalutation To France\n\nConstructive Work\n\nCooperation\n\nIn Spite Of Difficulties\n\nMilestones Of Culture\n\nSpells Of Finland\n\nTreasures Of The Mayas\n\nHimalayas\n\nThe Straight Path\n\nSaint Sergius, The Builder\n\nCall For Culture\n\nPeace To All Beings\n\nLatvia Reborn\n\nTerra Slavonica\n\nHolies Of The Home\n\nSacre\n\nCreative Thought\n\nSeven Saints\n\nHail —Artists!\n\nLove Unconquerable\n\nVital Wisdom\n\nAdamantius\n\nGlory Of Samurai\n\nFirm Paths\n\nOn The Threshold Of The Tenth Anniversary\n\nPeace And Culture\n\nHealth Of Spirit\n\nBlessed Hierarchy\n\nSacred Principles\n\nVijaya Tagore!\n\nThe Guard Of The Mother Of The World\n\nThe Realm Of Culture\n\nTerem Of Icons\n\nAncient Temples Of Finland\n\nTalashkino\n\nPrincess Tenisheff\n\nA Wreath To Diaghileff\n\nGrandfather’s Working Room\n\nAn Ancient Advice\n\nQueen Of Heaven\n\nREALM OF LIGHT\n\n1930\n\n“Angel—the Blessed Silence!” Who has not been exalted by this flaming mystery in the image of a fiery Angel? Who has not been imbued by the all-penetrating message of this ever-awaited, yet never-expected guest? His is the silence of the heart which has attained. He is the keeper of the eternal beauty of spirit. The beauty of the eternally silent and merciful spirit. He guards and blesses.\n\nThe old Christian book, “Mirror” says: “The Angel is the impalpable, the fiery and the flame-bearing” … “That which is not in need of word for his expression, nor ear for his hearing. Without word, or hearing, the Angels communicate to one another their wise understanding” … “In a dream-like body the Angel clothes Itself for manifestation to the people.”\n\nIn silence that vision was manifested: Translucent became all objects. And the Image of the Great Guest appeared effulgent. And his lips remained silent and he crossed his hands, and from each hair streamed light. And unfathomably, piercingly, glowed his eyes.\n\nZealously the Flaming One brought the message of the renewed and blessed world. Mysteriously he ordained the sign of Bliss. Daringly he recalled the Never-expressible. Untiringly in the hours of day and night he awakens the heart of humanity. He ordains the victory of spirit. And all will cognize and accept it with the language of their hearts.\n\nWho then embodied the Image of the Angel—the Blessed Silence? This Image came from the Northern Sea. But this mystery is known not only in the midnight sea. In it is evident the veiled image of the Messenger of the East. Within it is also the mystery of the Cross. The very Hand and Thought which created the Image of Sophia, the Almighty’s Wisdom, made manifest the Angel of Silence. Flaming are the wings of the ever-striving Sophia—the Wisdom; of the same flame are the wings of the Angel, the Blessed Silence. Fiery are the steeds of the chariot of Elias. So is the fiery baptism preordained by the Apostles. In all is the very same fire; Agni Omniscient and all-ascending, all-penetrating, and before which human word is superfluous.\n\nSparks of the dynamo imbue space. In tension they flower into spirals of ascension and glow like a tree with its branches and fiery leaves. The Logos of thought intensifies the prana and man stands humble, trembling before the radiance of the command of lightning. The fire of Kundalini kindles. The wheels of Ezekiel revolve. The Chakras of India rotate. Austere is the eye of Kapila. The Egyptian High Priest proclaimed “Sekhem Ur am Sekhemmu.” Where is the limit of Radiance? Where is the measure of Might? Light itself reaches the invisible and sound immerses…\n\nNo glimmer stirs; not even the fragrance of prana. This is the highest tension. Inaccessible to the eye, and inaudible to the ear. Only the heart knows that silence is calling and that the Chalice is brimming. First lightning and thunder and whirlwind and tremor; and only afterward, in silence, the Voice ineffable. Agni Yoga says: “The first call is as thunder, but the last is accomplished in silence.” At first, a flaming Messenger; and after, the purest Sophia, the Wisdom. ...\n\nIt is said: “Bliss is a timid bird”; impetuous are the wings of Sophia. Woe to him who did not perceive; woe to him who did not comprehend; woe to him who rejected. Why shall the flaming wing, which became. manifest through Bliss, appear again to the timid or cruel eye?\n\nBut how many fires are already apparent even to the inexperienced eye? Humanity dreams about the Abodes of Light. It dreams in silence. In the darkness, it daringly confesses to itself. Even by night humanity believes; but by day it does not profess. Although it is aware of the law: “I have faith and profess.” Oh, they themselves know that faith without deeds is but a phantom. Only abstraction! But bliss is attraction and affirmation. Otherwise for what are all misty sighs? Otherwise for what is Science itself, if the spirit does not dare its application? Nicodemus in the night is but the symbol of faith without deeds; a spark without flame or warmth.\n\nGhastly is decay. Unbearable is the frigidity of ignorance. It is inadmissible because of its harm, its contagion of accumulations, its destruction of the very foundation. Many a time the frightened Bird of Bliss fluttered with its white wings against closed windows. But we fear everything that assaults our ignorance and we depend upon door-bolts. Even when the eye perceives, we call it an “accident.” Even when the ear hears, we say “coincidence.” For us even the X-ray and the qualities of radium are ordinary, and electricity is only a lantern for our comfort. If one is told that thought alters the weight of a body, even this does not amaze the mechanistic ones of civilization. Irregularity of the blood circulation and harmful blood pressure are increasing amazingly. The latest form of influenza burns the lungs like a plague. The throat seems aflame. Asthma ravages. Meningitis is on the increase and incomprehensible heart symptoms are multiplying. But to us these signs are only fashionable diseases, not deserving of any special attention. We already hear of the hyper-saturation of Space by radio waves; of poisoning through gasoline; of signs of over-electrification ... it is discomforting to think of the future. Hence the fate of a golf ball is regarded as equal in importance with the destiny of that small ball—our planet. Unlike the wise Queen Hatshepsut, we fear to address those “Who will live in the years to come, who will develop their hearts and will look into the future”—even if the terrifying concept “the future” is pronounced through ideas so fossilized that the way to it is at once transformed into a subterranean dungeon.\n\nHowever, the first condition for the attainment of knowledge is freedom from methods of study. One should not insist upon standardized methods. The true knowledge is attained by inner accumulations, by daring; for the approaches to the One Knowledge are manifold. The description of such calls and milestones of life would make a most needed and uplifting book. One must not insist, not deprive, not subdue by conventionalities, but should constantly recall the light, the fires of space, the high energies, the predestined victories. All facts not within the elementary school books should be collected. Such facts should be threaded with full honesty, without conceit and disdain, or hypocrisy, behind which lurks fear—truly speaking, ignorance. One may never know whence the useful seed will come: the physicist, bio-chemist, botanist, physician, priest or historian or philosopher or a Tibetan lama, or Brahmin-pandit, or Rabbi-kabbalist, or Confucian or an old medicine woman, or, finally, the fellow traveler whose name we failed to ask without reason—who will make the most important contribution? In each life there is so much that is remarkably inspiring, unusual. Only to remember it! In these reminders sparkle so many of the best stars only temporarily obscured. Thus, once more without renouncing our daily labor, we approach not the things forbidden but the possibilities which illumine life. Only it is not our task to insist, lest we coerce. For nothing is achieved by forcing. But, I repeat, it is necessary to recall the possible joys. The names of these spiritual joys are inexpressible in the language of the material world.\n\nSaint Isaak Siryn ordains: “The hope of ease, in all times, forced the people to forget the higher.” He also says: “Who is unaware that even birds approach traps in the hope of rest?” Happy are those who, realizing Infinity, love daily labor. After the Holy Scriptures let us also remember the last book of Prof. A. S. Eddington, “Stars and Atoms.” Speaking of the condition of other constellations beyond earthly conditions, the Professor points out that it would be more accurate to say, the reason of a given manifestation lies in that it is earthly, and does not pertain to the stars. Even recently, people tried to ascribe earthly conditions to all far-off worlds. Freedom from prejudice is needed. The creative flame is needed. The bonfire summons the travelers in the desert. Likewise, the reminding call resounds and, through all encasements, reaches the heart which is ready. The milestones are manifold. The calls are unexpected. Untiring vigilance and thoughtful attention are the keys to the sealed gates. Where universality and sincerity of study, and veneration of the blessed Hierarchy are ordained there is no place for negation.\n\nNonetheless into the life of science must enter the unprejudiced. With difficulties, under scorn, in various countries, those fearless souls already strive to the predestined synthesis. Soon perhaps congresses of these creative workers will be possible. Already centers are being erected where without fear of the condemnation of ignorance or jealousy, one may interchange these viewpoints in full confidence. Let us then gather with all care these multicolored flowers of the great garden of culture, remembering that “I shall not reveal the mystery to the enemies, nor shall I give the kiss of Judas.” Without the coldness of condemnation, without repelling ignorance, shall we welcome each seed of Truth.\n\nWe interpret the flaming ecstasy of lofty spirits as “Hysteria Magna with high temperature.” Vishudha, the center of the throat, is for many only “a hysterical globe.” The fires of Saint Teresa, Clara, Radegunda; the ardent warmth of the Fathers of merciful love; of Tummo of the high Tibetan lamas; or the custom existing even today in India of walking upon fire (the Agni-Diku—the throne of fire was likewise in India, where rise the thousand summits of Maha-Meru). For many these all mean either an abnormal rise of temperature or the loss of sensitiveness. Even the difference in weight of a potato before its dissolution and the loss in weight at the summarizing of its particles does not impel us to ponder upon certain energies which have been overlooked. However, each sincere chemist will admit that at each reaction some unaccountable condition is present—perhaps the peculiar qualities of the experimenter himself. For instance the presence of a certain personality in the laboratory of Sir Jagadis Bose prevented the death of plants. As Sir Jagadis is a great scholar, he at once noted this fact. But few are those who pay attention to the influence of human nature upon plants. Few are far enough advanced to accept a fact as it stands, unprompted by prejudice, superstition, selfishness and self-conceit. Verily, rare are such great self-sacrificing scientists as Millikan, Michelson, Einstein, Raman, Marconi, who untiringly carry the torch of enlightenment and betterment of life.\n\nThe light-bearing quality (Tejas) of the manas is as real as the radiant emanation created by the tension of a thought of high quality. The masters of Christian iconography, as well as the Buddhist artists, expressed these radiant emanations with great skill. Studying these images you will find an evident exposition of the crystallization of light. It is time to study and apply this reality of the value of thought—the value of light. It is time to realize that when we pronounce the great conception of Bliss, we are not falling into abstraction, but affirming a high reality. The time has come for the establishment of the evaluation of the rays and energies now being discovered. Ahead of us, for decades, lie carefully-planned experiments into the influences and consequences of radium, X-rays, and all that power which invisibly permeates and magnifies the atmosphere of the planet. Without question, one must found laboratories for untiring, decade-long experiments. There psychic energy will also be studied as will physiology of the spirit and thought, and the quality of light-bearing agents, life-givers and life-preservers. It is a vast creative field, and during these researches, fearlessness before Infinity will be manifested.\n\nFire and Light. The entire progress of humanity is concentrated upon this all-penetrating and omnipresent element. If properly evoked it will be realized and lawfully applied; otherwise it will burn the consequences of ignorance. In this search for the synthesis of knowledge once more the excrescences of the East and West, North and South will be erased. Everywhere we shall find the very same “subtle pain of the cognizing heart,” “the very same attainment by the innermost heart exertion,” the “same exaltation of spirit.” And together with the Apostle we shall say, “it is better to say five words from the depths of the heart, than a torrent of words with the tongue.” Let us not leave the real values in abstraction, but let us unhesitatingly apply them without prejudice. The transferring of reality into abstraction is one of the most deplorable crimes against culture. There are many who still do not distinguish between civilization and culture, and thus they are committing the values of culture into misty un-attainability. How much of that which is predestined has already been rejected by fear and hypocrisy? But sooner or later one must be cured of fear; it is necessary to liberate the enormous amount of energy usually dissipated in fear, irritation, lying and treason. Let us hasten to affix our radiant emanations on a film—thus we shall obtain the true passport of spirit. Agni Yoga says: “The darkness shrieks, deafening in its regularity. Darkness cannot withstand the daring of light.”\n\nSaint Teresa, Saint Francis of Assisi, Saint Jean de la Croix, were levitated in ecstasy to the ceiling of their cells. Some may say that this is absolutely impossible. And suppose even today there should be witnesses of levitation and changing of weight? The Flaming One took part in the Service with Saint Sergius, according to tradition. From the flaming Chalice, Saint Sergius took his Communion. In the great Fire, he realized the invisible Truth: The uplifted consciousness was illumined by tongues of flame. During the prayers of Saint Francis of Assisi the monastery was so aglow that the travelers rose, thinking: “Is it not the dawn?” The radiance glowed above the monastery when Saint Clara prayed. Once the light became so luminous that the peasants came running, thinking: “Is there not a fire?”\n\nMany traditions exist. But here is a simple story told about the Pecherski Monastery in Pskov:\n\n“Our monastery is an unusual one. Walking out from the monastery, and regarding it from a distance, impenetrable darkness surrounds one. But above the monastery light gloweth. Many a time I myself have seen it.\n\n“Some one inquires, ‘Perhaps this is from the monastery fire?’\n\n“So also do others who do not know:\n\n“ ‘What fires are in the monastery?’\n\n“ ‘Two kerosene lanterns and two oil lamps burn before the icons. This is all the lighting.’\n\n“ ‘In our city, electricity is used, but nevertheless in the darkness, one cannot discern on which side it lies.’\n\n“ ‘No, this is a special light above the monastery.’ “\n\nLikewise, in the Himalayas, the people came running to what they believed to be a fire, and in the same way, instead of destructive flames they found the radiance of the spirit. Likewise the mountain stood crowned by the blue petals of the fiery Lotus. Thus in the Bible the unconsuming fire was kindled. Many fiery signs have appeared, such as the special manifestations of electricity. And what is electricity? This also has not been explained.\n\nDuring the last earthquake in Italy many people saw the entire sky ablaze in tongues of flame. Over England a fiery cross was seen. Was it superstition? Or did somebody see that which in other cases passed unnoticed?\n\nTry to test the attentiveness of people and you will be shocked at the rarity of those who know how to apply their vigilance and power of movement. Even the power of thought, the mighty magnet, is shamefully neglected. Smile, smile, but just the same you do not try to think precisely.\n\nBoxing, golf, cricket and baseball truly do not require the power of thought. Racing also is not precisely thinking. One may invent still other occupations which will justify the neglect of thought, but yet one will sometimes have to turn back to the creativeness of thought. Therefore even small experiments in attentiveness are not useless. Verily, in schools one ought to establish special courses for developing concentration and thought. Rare is the person who is able to dictate two letters at once, or write with both hands, or to master two conversations simultaneously. Often a clear image of an object cannot be retained and even a simple interior cannot be described. For some people even all foreigners look alike. But even a slight attentiveness could be of great assistance in life. In the study of the hygiene of thought we notice some things which are called phenomena by the average person, whereas, they are simple manifestations of the law. Thus honest study will once more replace the despair of unbelief by a glorious possibility.\n\nIn any case we cannot avoid the era of Fire. Hence it is better to value and to master this treasure. It is advisable to question any statement when it assaults our reason, but doubt springing from ignorance will be destructive. However, the entire world is now strikingly divided into builders and destroyers. With whom shall we side? We have heard repeatedly of many luminous radiations; nevertheless we deride anything concerning human and animal auras. Even if a photographic film catches them we prefer to hint about a defect in the film, rather than to admit the well-known ancient law.\n\nWhen remembering the strange experiments of Keely, we rather prefer to class him as a charlatan, than to consider the specific quality of his nature. The apparatus invented by him worked in his presence but refused to act in the hands of others. Why then does a machine become more “fatigued” in some hands than in others? Every experienced engineer notices this. Why does the fatigue of a horse depend upon the rider? Why does the quality of a hand shorten the life of flowers? We talk about psychic energy. We are aware that, as the ancient Militia Crucifera Evangelica gathered about the symbol of the Cross, we must gather around the sacred conception of Culture.\n\nComplicated but beautiful is our Era when, in new combinations, shine new multi-colored stars. The experienced Fathers advise us of “the wondrous exertion in the innermost heart.” “We have ceaselessly to revolve the name of the Lord in our hearts, as lightning whirls in space before rain. This is well known to him who is experienced in spiritual fights. This inner battle has to be carried out like actual war.”\n\n“But when by the Sun of Truth, sensual desires will be dispersed, then usually are born in the heart luminous and celestial aspirations.”\n\nIn another part of the ancient Teachings, it is said: “The pure heart of him who has affirmed himself in full consciousness, is transformed into a mental sky with its own sun, moon and stars. Such a pure heart becomes a receptacle of the inconceivable God through the mysterious vision and exaltation of mind.”\n\nFurther the Fathers of Mercy teach: “Be seated or, better still, stand in a half-lighted corner in silence, in a prayerful posture. Do not relax, transfer the mind into the heart. Guard thy attention and do not permit either good or bad thought into thy mind; keep calm patience. Keep reasonable moderation.” …\n\n“In order to assist in this task, the Holy Fathers pointed out certain means qualifying them as practitioners of art and even the art of the arts. This natural art, that of entering into the heart by means of breathing helps greatly the exaltation of thoughts.” Continuing the advice for this special pranayama, the Holy Father counsels: “Breathing through the lungs conducts the air to the heart. Thus, be seated and, concentrating the mind, lead it in this direction; force it by breathing inward, to penetrate into the very heart together with the air inhaled: and keep it there, not permitting it to leave, much as it would want to. Keeping it there, do not leave it idle, but give it sacred words. Try to become accustomed to this inner concentration and watch lest thy mind leave there too soon, for at first it will be under depression, then it will be joyous and happy to dwell there and it will itself want to remain there. Shalt thou succeed in penetrating into the heart by the means I have pointed out to thee, abide by this exertion forever. It shall teach thee that which thou never hast conceived.”\n\n“Thus it is necessary to find an experienced preceptor (Guru). Saint Gregory Sinaite says: ‘An active and heartily intelligent prayer is achieved thus: Be seated on a low chair, half a foot high; transfer the mind from the head to the heart and keep it there and from there invoke with hearty intelligence: Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy!’\n\n“Know that all such special postures of the body are prescribed and are needed until pure and concentrated prayer is enrooted in the heart. And when, through the Bliss of the Lord thou shalt attain this, then, laying aside much special exertion, thou wilt be united without words with the Lord, in pure and concentrated heart-felt prayer, no longer necessitating special preparations. Besides, do not forget that when at times thou art inspired for a pure voluntary prayer, do not by any means destroy it by the usual prayer precepts. Cast aside these precepts and as far as thy inner forces reach, try to adhere to the Lord and He will enlighten thy heart in the spiritual attainment.\n\n“Even in deep sleep the fragrance of prayer will ascend from the heart without effort. Though the inner voice be silent during sleep, yet within, the sacred service shall ceaselessly act. For only this sacred dagger ceaselessly rotated in the heart, liberated from any other image, can force the enemies to retreat and destroy them and consume them as does fire applied to straw.”\n\nOne may quote endlessly from the Holy Fathers of the Church and the rules of the covenants of the hermits; and one feels that these rules are created for life and applied in reality. Again speaks an experienced voice: “When the spiritual gifts are realized, then, under a constant bliss, one becomes radiant and becomes unwavering in the contemplation of the spiritual treasures. Such an one is freed from all earthly things and forever is liberated from death into the eternal life. Inexpressible in words is the radiance of the Divine Beauty. Neither can word express it, nor ear contain it. Even if thou shalt compare it with the glory of dawn, the luminosity of the moon, the light of the sun—all these do not equal its divine glory. Poor are all these before the true Light, deepest night or densest darkness before the purest light.”\n\nThus can he alone speak who has experienced what is the “spiritual man of the heart”—“a light which even in the darkness shineth and is inextinguishable by darkness.”\n\nWhen Makary, the Egyptian, wrote the following, he depicted, not abstract symbols, but vital realization: “Those who are the sons of Light and the sons of Service in the Holy Spirit, they shall learn nothing from men for they are inspired by Divine Wisdom. For Bliss itself inscribes in their hearts the laws of spirit. They need not be induced by writings inscribed with ink; but upon the tablets of the heart the divine Bliss inscribes the laws of spirit and the heavenly mysteries. It is the heart that rules all the organs of the body. And if Bliss reached the valleys of the heart, then it rules all the organs of the body and dominates all thoughts.”\n\nAn ancient Egyptian papyrus says: “The beginning of the physician’s wisdom is the knowledge of the heart’s action.”\n\nHe who knows the spiritual heart, knows also “the subtle pain of the physical heart,” about which the Holy Fathers speak so inspiringly. He who knows this “subtle pain” has cognized also the fire of love—not the love of sighs but the real love of action and attainment. That love which, since antiquity has been called the Love of God-man, which purifies and uplifts the human sensations. Agni Yoga says: “What sage of knowledge would not be a Lord of Love?”\n\n“The subtle pain,” the heat of the flame of the heart, is known to the experienced one in the highest tests of life. It is known to those to whom enlightened labor has become the daily prayer; and prayer transformed into the ceaseless rhythm of heart, into the rhythm of light. Some will ask what is rhythm and why is its realization so important? It means that he who inquires does not know what is the “subtle pain” of the heart and is unaware of the music of the spheres, and has not hearkened to the hymn of nature. Without his own striving, he shall not cognize the sparks of attainment, which will bring his heart closer to the Cosmos and Love. The center of spirit is linked with the center of the organism. … “This unity, known for ages, is not deciphered scientifically, nor philosophically, but is nonetheless quite evident.”\n\nThe Chalice of experience! In this way we again approach the creation by thought—the mysterious but immutable, “the Word become matter.” This way the Logos is embodied into the physical. This mystery is manifested in each man, in each incarnated spirit. “God breathed eternity into the heart of each man”—the Realm of Light is immortal, eternal through all incarnations. And it shall cognize the Light; for it is the very source of Light itself. The “subtle pain” is the manifestation of subtle energy and the luminosity is one of the prime qualities of the action of such energies. When this light is intensified, it becomes visible even to our eye. This moment remains forever the long awaited and unexpected. It is ordained to keep the torches aflame, but the moment of the great Messenger is inexpressible. Likewise inexpressible is the “subtle pain” of the heart and the covenant that “Joy is a special Wisdom.” Alongside with this one can remember the covenants of the Bhagavad Gita, and Agni Yoga and the Kabbala and the prophecies of the Bible and the Fire of Zoroaster.\n\nThe “Sun-likeness” of Plato belongs to the same untold but luminous conceptions. When the experienced ones meet, they are not in need of a vocabulary, for, even in silence, they will understand the language of the heart.\n\nHence, gain experience and proclaim it—because you are not aware of your best hour, nor do you know when the flame will flash over the Chalice of accumulations. Only the high quality of thought will guide you and insatiable impetuosity will be the wings of Light of Sophia —Wisdom. It is ordained to radiate, but not to be consumed.\n\nThe resounding of the Center of the heart, heard by Socrates, harmonizes with the rhythm of Good. The high matter of Spinoza is ozonized by the same waves of light. The luminous center of the heart can radiate with the all-illumining flame—the fabulous stone of the legends of the Grail.\n\nAgni Yoga says: “At the basis of the Universe, search for the heart.” … “The creativeness of heart is strained by the Chakra of the Chalice.” … “The greatest Might is in the Magnet of the Heart.” … “The word not containing the affirmation of the heart is empty.” … “The pearl of the heart is the subtle tensity.” “An Arhat as a flame carries in his heart all fires of life.”\n\nOrigen affirms: “With the eyes of the heart we can see Be-ness.”\n\n“All is pure to the pure,” fearlessly ordains the Apostle Paul. He knew the purity and activity of the heart, when it knows only the good and as a magnet attracts around itself only the good. The similarity between heart and magnet is often mentioned, although scientifically it is not yd acknowledged. However “the treasures of Wisdom and knowledge” are attained only by the wisdom of the heart, by the chalice of love and self-sacrificing action. “There, where is your treasure, there is your heart,” says the Apostle. The luminosity of the heart is similar to fluorescence of the sea, which in motion produces numberless visible luminous formations. Likewise the action of creative love kindles the flames of heart. “There shall be Light,” says the Thought of the Great.\n\nThe “inner man” wishes only good and at the moment of hearty radiation he knows without doubt where is the good. And from the hearty radiation springs forth only good. And this emanating light smites all excrescences of ignorance; because sin and ignorance are the brothers of darkness. To live in spirit means to radiate, to do good and ceaselessly to attain. To live only in the body means to obscure, to condemn, to be ignorant and to prolong one’s path. But it must not be overlooked that in retarding our own progress we obstruct the progress of those nearest us —hence every display of egotism, selfishness, self-pity, false pride, ignorance—is the stronghold of darkness. In the name of those near us, we must not disturb the rhythm of the waves of Light and Good.\n\nUseful are observations upon flowers. The garden of light is likewise in need of constant care. The streams of pure thoughts are its best nurture. The more intense is light, the weaker the darkness. Even the radiant heart of the Angel could choose the freedom of gloom instead of the freedom of service and glory. Therefore without delay is needed the nurture of the garden of Light, otherwise the spotted tongues of tiger-lilies will devour the Lilies of Annunciation and the treacherous Belladonna will overpower the Fresias of the shiny summits. One must radiate. One must generate and strengthen the light of the heart. One must remember that co-radiance and co-resounding of light are mutually strengthened. Immeasurable is the might of the thoughts united by Benevolence. For every one, is the Light prepared, but we may extinguish it with an empty vessel. It is said, “At the fall of a rose petal, the far-off worlds tremble” and “the feather from the wing of a bird creates thunder upon the far-off worlds.” What a vast, beautiful responsibility! Let us not turn the thunder born through light-mindedness towards the Earth.\n\nFrom this inspiring responsibility issues a radiant attempt honestly to study without any disillusionment all which surrounds us. Even an accomplished virtuoso is in need of daily exercises. It is repeated: “If thou art tired, begin again. If thou art exhausted, begin again and again.” And like a Shield invoke Love.\n\n“The warmth of Love” is as real as the “subtle pain” of the heart. The radiance of the thought is not only tangible to the eye, but is even accessible to the film. It is necessary to study at once, without superstition, fearlessly and altruistically. Evidence relates to the physical body, but not to the spirit. Truth is in the very reality, but not in the pathology of evidence.\n\nThe heart, this great transmuter of energies, knows where is the convulsion of horror and the tremor of ecstasy. The spirit distinguishes the spots of terror and the radiation of exaltation. Wherefore to be scorched and carbonized if it is preordained to radiate immortally? “God is the fire which warms the hearts,” says Saint Seraphim.\n\n“He knows the depths of the heart,” chants the Psalmist King. When we speak about the Beautiful, about the depths of the heart, then first of all we have in mind the beautiful creative thoughts. As the most delicate flowers they must be cultivated. They must be unceasingly watered by the joyful streams of Bliss. One must learn daily how to think clearly and benevolently. One must nurture the aspirations—these loftiest seedlings of thought. Let us dare. Let us not be afraid to aspire upon heights. From the summits we can see afar. From the summits come the Tables of Commandments, From the summits come the heroes and achievement. Radiant is aspiration. The flaming aspiration is the threshold of Bliss.\n\nAgni and Thought.\n\nFiery are the wings of “Sophia—the Almighty’s Wisdom.”\n\nHimalayas, 1930.\n\ntop\n\nCULTURE\n\n1930\n\nDear Friends: We shall say briefly wherein the substance of our tasks and strivings lies. Everything which is defined can be expressed briefly: We are helping Culture. And if some one in a moment of audacity should take upon himself the burden of saying “We are constructing Culture,” then he will be not far from the truth. Does not every one who helps appear to be a co-worker?\n\nWe are asking our friends, each day to think, to pronounce and to apply the understandings of Beauty and Culture. And this is not new, because there is nothing new anywhere. But we are gathering around these precious understandings a new effort; we are striving to help towards the tension of creative energy. We are striving to learn and to reincarnate the so-called abstraction into reality. It is very easy to make an abstraction from each action, and in this abstraction to lose the possibility of action. We see constantly that the most real teaching of life is being transmuted by clever rhetoric into an unapproachable abstraction and for the appeasing of the weak will it is being transported into an intangible cloudiness. To make this artificially created abstraction a reality and substance of life, is the next task of Culture. It is impossible for one to imagine that the true perception of substance, the true teaching of life is only something forbidding, obstructing or deadening.\n\nTruth will be there, where will be manifested without obstacles a constructive broadening containment and love towards the untiring achievement. Our enemies say that we are forming of ourselves a special race. If we understand by this a nation of culture, then maybe this hostile definition, as too often happens, comes very close to the truth. We shall not be afraid of this truth, if as the highest condemnation, the Black Century—which has already spent itself—will tell us: “Here are gathered dreamers, and they imagine they can help humanity.” Namely, in this help to humanity we are being reproached. But each of our companions-at-arms, who are scattered all over the world, will smile at that and say: “Does not every natural labor appear to be a help to humanity?” Because it would be abominable to think that every one who labors, labors only for himself. No, he works for some one unknown to him. And this unknown one will accept the nameless labor as an expression of Benevolence which makes his passage along the earthly path easier for him.\n\nNot dreams, but embodiments of thoughts; the dream flies away into the shoreless ocean of the air, but the embodiment of thoughts creates substance and cements space with the coming creations. Of the creation by thought into multiple forms, all religion, all teaching has spoken. Many thousands of years before our era the Egyptians knew the creativeness of thought. And it has been said everywhere: “Thought and Love.” And under the sign of the Heart and the Serpent and the Chalice in all its multiformity of benevolent symbols is being given also the wise, preordained inscription, “Thought and Love.” Because from a thought, an emanation absolutely real, we contrive to make abstractions. We forget that it is not the hand, but the thought which creates and kills. And of Love we have made either a sour sigh or an abomination of fornication.\n\nIt has been told us that certain branches of the Christian Church recently sanctioned abortion. This unhappy ordinance must be understood as the highest negation of spirituality. Just think, if the Church will recommend murder, instead of the wise distribution of strength and abstinence. If the division of the world into Constructors and Destroyers is constantly talked about, then this measure would be a terrible sign of destruction. But Culture in its essence does not know destruction as such. It is impetuously, constantly creating, it is constantly covering with a newer, higher dome the imperfections of yesterday. But here it comprises that stone which would be of use to the wise builder, which meets every possibility.\n\nVerily, in all parts of the world, at present is rising the tension of constructive energy. The lines of new workers cry out: “We are tired of destruction, we are overburdened by senseless mechanization. We want to create, we want to do that useful work which unites us with the resplendent future.” In ancient teachings, there has always been pointed out the bridge which unites the old and the new worlds. And nowhere have destruction and violence been mentioned.\n\nIf one is to ponder over the spirituality of the future, although this spirituality seem an abstract one, it shall again assert its visibility, its tangibility and its immutability. And again Benevolence will become objective, just as Thought is objective and can be weighed. If one ennobles his life, if instead of vile calumny, one tries to turn again to the resplendent creation, is this laughable? Because only ignoramuses will laugh—for them, knowledge itself has already become an abstraction and Beauty also has become an unnecessary luxury, and Benevolence itself has become a childish fairy-tale. But the most serious scientists long ago came to the conclusion that a fairytale is a narrative. And a narrative is an historical fact which one can perceive only through the smoke of ages.\n\nThe same scientists have pointed out to us that Culture and the achievements of empires have been constructed by Beauty. Take away the monuments of Beauty and the whole aspect of history will be depleted. The virility of Beauty, the age-long inviolability of Culture tell us of the true transmutation of abstraction into manifested life. And we are not dreamers at all, but workers for life, and our apostolate above all is content in that we are striving to say to the people, “Remember Beauty. Do not exile its image from life, but also actively call others to this feast of joy! And if you see allies, do not bid them depart, but find the full measure of benevolent containment in order to call us to the very same peaceful, measureless field of labor and construction. In Beauty and in Spirit shall our strength be multiplied. Look into the heights, and spread thy wings as the conqueror of the predestined Light.” ... In the day of spiritual disturbances and tremor, we shall repeatedly affirm the very same construction and the same benevolent Light. And there are no conditions which could turn one aside who has entered the path of construction. And we shall not be afraid in the name of the Beautiful; and we shall remember that the ridicule of ignorance is only a torch of achievement. If we will eschew egotism, if we will strive not only ourselves towards the path of the Beautiful, but also by all possible means open it to our nearest ones, then we shall have already fulfilled the next task of the enlightening of Culture—the ascension of the Spirit.\n\ntop\n\nTHE BEAUTIFUL\n\nAddress To The Dalton School\n\n1930\n\nIn Bombay I was once asked what was the difference between East and West, and I answered, “The best roses of East and West have the same fragrance.” So, while we are speaking about opposition and differences, essentially we have the great “One,” because really all law is One, and under this Law, everything is One. We have only to serve this One and if we are unable to do so, we may say “Mea culpa,” for we are guilty of having failed to follow the law.\n\nVery often we are trying to discover how to build the next life—how to build the evolution to come. Well, that is our duty. And you will all very soon wish to build up your own lives, and certainly you will wish to build up a happy life. What is the best medium to reach this happiness? Fortunately, after visiting more than twenty-five countries, I can tell you from my own experience—only through the Beautiful. We are divided in so many experiences, and yet everywhere is this same feeling of the Beautiful. You note that I am underlining the Beautiful, not Beauty, because I am speaking not only about art, or about some expression of art, music, drama, song, but I am speaking about the sense of the Beautiful, and it is our duty to introduce in our lives this general sense of this great conception.\n\nPerhaps some one could ask me, “Well, it is very good to have such a dream—to make life somehow beautiful. We often think that this Beautiful is only for those who are rich; and he who must work—how can he dream about the Beautiful? And certainly, we all have need of this dream about the Beautiful.”\n\nIn various countries, I have seen many collectors, real workers in art, and some of them have been very poor. They have been of the working class, and still this sense of the Beautiful was so strong in them that, even with their modest means, they found the possibility to approach the Beautiful.\n\nI remember one very prominent collector, a colonel in the army—and you know that the income of a colonel is not large—but he was a born collector. He understood that not only the painting exists, but that before it, a sketch is made and very often in these sketches the conception is expressed far better than it is in the painting. So this ardent collector began to gather various sketches. He came to our studios, saying he could not pay much, but would like this first thought, this first expression of the painting. He was very persistent—in ten years he gathered a most remarkable collection of these various expressions, and perhaps this collection was sometimes far more precious than a huge collection of finished paintings.\n\nThe chief thing is to have this inner sense of the Beautiful. Because not every one has a medium in art, but practically every one has thought, and very often our creation in the realm of thought is far greater than reflections in some medium of art. I am underlining this because very often people come to me, saying over and over the same story: “I have no prospects in life, how can I dream about something beautiful—I have no time to study.” But in a few moments you can see that this man is really gifted—that he has wonderful conceptions and thoughts, and really can project his thoughts and his conceptions into space.\n\nWe have to remember that every thought is recorded in the space. So the chief thing is to create in thought—to be real cooperators in this beautiful creation of the whole universe. Because in this way of creation we will reflect the best creative powers and we will then be true cooperators and co-workers toward the Supreme.\n\nAfter visiting various peoples of Asia, with varied customs and varied lives, I can affirm that this idea is very vital. Because while we think very often to introduce art in life—there you find everywhere that art is part of life. When some one asked us, “Is it possible for you to be away from a theater for five years?” the answer was that we have the theater in life itself; we have music in life itself; we have song in life itself.\n\nSeveral times in Central Asia, in the desert of Mongolia, we heard a Mongolian singing a beautiful song. When we asked him to repeat it, he answered, “That is impossible, because we are singing only for the desert.” We are dreaming of having art in life, in the most vital way.\n\nIn the Roerich Museum you have seen my expression of the Sacred Dances of Mongolia. You ask how to introduce the theater? There they have as a stage-setting their beautiful sacred banners, exquisitely painted; a huge orchestra, with gigantic trumpets; powerful choruses. For days and days they are performing the sacred dances, sacred rituals. For days and days every one takes part in the ceremony. So all of life is transmuted into beauty.\n\nHow can we introduce this spirit here? Difficulties and possibilities are alike—there and here. To do this in a vital way, we have to realize the power of thought. We speak often about will-power, but very seldom do we employ this power. We speak about telepathy and we think that it is something very difficult and supernatural, phenomenal; but there are no phenomena, and there is no occultism.\n\nTo children, even the telephone is a most occult thing. But when you know how energy is employed, you know that there is nothing extraordinary involved.\n\nWe should introduce these possibilities into our lives.\n\nIn Asia, they speak about Agni Yoga, the Teaching of Fire. Is it something supernatural? No. They are explaining how to use this element of Fire—the flame of Space —this all-embracing element. And you will be told that very soon the Era of Flame is approaching our land. You will hear it in a quite scientific way, and then you will remember that Professor Millikan discovered the cosmic ray, and is about to discover the keenest application of that ray.\n\nIn Asia, for ages and ages, they have spoken about this same beautiful energy. And this discovery will soon be given to humanity.\n\nIn the time of Buddha, they knew about the iron birds which would serve humanity. They knew from the most ancient times about iron serpents, also for the sake of humanity. So you see how, for ages, real knowledge was being given out, but in another language, or with other symbols, for if we analyze our prejudices in full honesty, we can have a multitude of very useful facts. But the problem is how to approach facts honestly. “We have to take science as science without any prejudice or superstition.” At the same time, not infrequently, the scientists themselves fail to regard facts in the pure light of honesty. We should take these facts through ourselves —through our own understanding, and sometimes we will find ourselves more superstitious than some of the people in the desert. But all this does not matter. When we have such scientists as Einstein, as Millikan, we feel that our coming evolution is in good hands.\n\nYou have probably read the articles by Prof. Millikan. Is it not a great joy to see how this eminent scientist speaks in so broad a way? In him there is no superstition. And he is experiencing this same state of the Beautiful, because every scientist, in the moment of discovery, is the same as the artist, because he is in the same spirit of the Beautiful. Sometime you can ask a discoverer how his discovery was made—what happened in the moment of discovery. And if the man is honest, he will tell you that something happened at that moment. It was not an accident. At that moment, he touched the Supreme—the highest Cross of Eternity.\n\nI have seen your beautiful room dedicated to chemistry and to science. You know how electricity is created by the crossing of two energies. That is a beautiful moment when two immeasurable energies create something physical and measurable.\n\nYou see how important it is to create your essential energy. You will hear about scientific energy, occult energy, Agni energy. These are all symbols for the same thing—creative energy.\n\nSome big bankers, big business men, are also artists, and it is very easy to speak to and to receive understanding from a big man, because his consciousness is already expanded and if you are speaking to him about something difficult, still his experience is so big that he can understand everything, and from this understanding emanates his tolerance. Please remember this quality—tolerance. You will need it. So many things have been broken through ignorance.\n\nIntolerance is ignorance. And having dispersed essential ignorance with science, we may feel that science and art are one. Because everything is one. And creative energy is one. In this way you can forever keep your enthusiasm. Sometimes we think we are tired. But we are not tired. We are only using the same nervous center too long. If we are tired, it does not mean that we need relaxation—that we need to sleep. We should only change our work —change the center, and in this change of different nervous centers you will become rested.\n\nRemember, the chief poison is the poison of irritation and anger, and this is a most powerful poison. For with every irritation, we physically create in our nervous system some emanation.\n\nOur best scientists, physicians, know already that something physical is created through irritation. In Asia, they will tell you about this crystal of anger. How can we be happy if we know that through our anger, we are creating poisons? The remedy is only not to be irritated—not to be angry. When you remember forever that anger is something hideous, then it is not so difficult not to be irritated. If you know some one comes to irritate you, you must encounter him with a smile. And when you know that, you are already strong.\n\nI should not like to feel that some of you today think that I am speaking of something abstract, or occult, or something mystical. What is “mystical?” Something from mist. But we have nothing to do with mists or clouds—only with facts and light. And with facts we can enlighten our life.\n\nWe are speaking about the Beautiful because when you will realize this scientific energy, the greatest power which is in each of you—then you shall release this energy, and energy will grow.\n\nVery often people ask how to release this energy. This energy is our property. One time a young group asked how to release this energy. I asked them—“Each of you, please tell me something unusual about your life.” They all became silent. There was nothing unusual to tell! “Our lives are routine.” ... “I am working in a bank.” … “I am working in a factory.” … But is it not strange that Boehme, one of the great philosophers, was a shoemaker? And One was a carpenter! Certainly this routine of life is our pranayama. This word, new to you, means the using of the energy, the processes of learning how to use the energy. You can achieve through this—and I can tell you that your routine work is the pranayama. Only we must maintain the quality of work. When we keep the quality of our work, we begin to be successful. He is the highest artisan who can attain the quality of art in work. We can even wash the floors spiritually. For then some one will at once remark it saying: “This man is doing this work in such a beautiful way, that he is not in his place. Something higher should be given him.” And when we refine the quality of our work, another thing happens—we have the joy of work. The greatest misfortune is that people often work for rest, for a holiday; but when we know the joy of work, then we need no conventional holidays. We can celebrate our holiday in labor, with the clearest conception, and with the best thought. And we shall not be tired, because we shall be so enthusiastic, we shall keep our enthusiasm. We shall not sleep too much, because we shall not need to sleep much. When we are sleepy, when we are not thinking, then everything bad happens. But if you are producing this work for the quality of the work, in this creative enthusiasm, you are strong and you are impersonal, and perhaps this feeling of the impersonal is the greatest aspect of the Beautiful.\n\nYou have some beautiful examples of art in your school —where is the name of the author? There is no name; no author. If the name had been written, perhaps it could be ascertained only for a few hundred years. But you have these objects for thousands of years.\n\nSo this impersonality is the greatest central aspect of the Beautiful. Then we can understand that “I” is isolated, and that “We” is strong. Through “We” comes the real beginning of organization, and the real cooperation.\n\nEverywhere in Asia you have this beautiful conception of Guru-ship, the Teacher—it is not a feeling of slavery —on the contrary, it is a great feeling of cooperation. In this way, a chain of cooperators can be created. You know your Master and some one considers you as a Master, and in this way there is one chain to the Supreme.\n\nAnd when you know this one Road, so many things are easy to you. I hope that sometimes you will remember what I have told you—how practical is the quality of work. We have to remember how much of waste there is in anger, so we can avoid it.\n\nWe know that at one time America and Asia have been one country. Some cataclysm occurred, and they were divided. In this connection, the Mongols tell a beautiful tale of how the earth was split, and how some fiery iron birds are soon to bring them news from their lost relatives. The scientists have made this story come true and the people of the desert knew the same thing, only in their own language.\n\nIt would be the greatest mistake to think that the people in the East had forgotten their memories. They have many things in their own symbols. How beautifully they can speak about art and art objects! I wish many art critics might have so beautiful a faculty of expressing their feeling before art objects.\n\nI remember in Kuchar in Central Asia, somebody told a beautiful tale about art:\n\nHow one artist wanted some money for his painting, and when he came to the money lender the man was absent, and only a boy was there. This boy gave the artist a very large sum for the painting. When the money lender came back, he said, “For these fruits and vegetables you gave such a great sum!” and he discharged the boy.\n\nTime passed, and the artist returned, and asked for the painting. When he saw it he was horrified, saying, “That is not my painting. Where are the butterflies? Go find the boy, that he may help us find my painting. This painting you show me has only cabbages.”\n\nThe boy came and said, “Now it is winter and the butterflies come only in the summertime. Put the painting near the fire, and we shall see the butterflies return.” And so it was; the paint was put on the canvas so delicately that during the cold weather the colors receded, but in the warmth they returned.\n\nThus beautifully do these people speak about the perfection of art.\n\nRemember the sense of the Beautiful. I again advise you to keep your enthusiasm, and to keep this creative thought—to remember that thought is the chief thing—that power of thought is the real possibility and it is the most practical thing to have pure thoughts. So please have pure thoughts.\n\nNew York, March 27, 1930.\n\ntop\n\nSPIRITUAL TREASURES\n\n1930\n\nIf, in gathering the beauties of spirit, we begin to remember the events of the last years, We are astonished by one basic circumstance, which prompts special consideration. For the last few decades we have seen many remarkable personalities passing on to the far-off path. It has been valuable to perceive also what sincere regrets have been called forth by their loss in the hearts of the most varied peoples in the different continents. As though something precious, needed, that constructs the ascending foundations of life’s structure, is passing away. In the eyes of the most apparently impartial people glimmered tears—those pure gems of impersonal vibration. We remember how we marked the passing of Leo Tolstoi, of Pasteur, of Wagner, of Mendeleeff and many others equally significant in the betterment and purification of human consciousness.\n\nWe remember also, another fact no less valuable: namely, the welcoming of experiments, discoveries and cultural achievements which took place. It is not a soulless chronicle which pointed out and hailed the new conquests of mankind. The enthusiastic praises as well as the inevitable condemnations which followed these events ignited an explosion of sparks which in their turn created and aroused attention.\n\nHow does it stand at present? The chronicles point out discoveries, and devote even greater space undoubtedly to the stock exchange and sport. The appearance of great people is met by suspicious doubt, and their departure is accompanied by a formal rising and an artificial silence, and no one knows the quality of the thoughts during that moment of prescribed silence.\n\nWhat does this mean? Perhaps it is a sign of unusual spiritual riches? Perhaps giants of thought, giants of creativeness have become so usual, that their departure can no longer occupy or attract public attention?\n\nIs this really the case? Or does it rather signify the very opposite? Does this not mean contempt of spiritual values? Does not this fascination with material, physical and passing concepts during which the light is veiled as if by a dusty cloud, indicate that the values of culture are being pushed into the mist? For us it is not necessary to convince ourselves of the true causes of the visible manifestations which take place. We gather together in the name of culture and each of us of course, feels keenly the need of true unity around this understanding which leads the forces of evolution. But if we, in any measure, feel the truth of what has been said, then is it not our duty to manifest it? Each person according to his own sphere must direct the attention of those who surround him, to any negligence of spiritual value.\n\nIt has been repeatedly inscribed on the scrolls of command that a spiritual garden is daily in need of the same watering as a garden of flowers. If we still consider the flowers as precious adornments of our life, then how much more must we remember and prescribe to the creative values of the spirit the leading place in the life which surrounds us? Let us then with untiring, eternal vigilance, benevolently mark the manifestations of the workers of culture; and let us strive in every possible way to ease this difficult path of heroic achievement.\n\nEqually so, let us mark and find a place in our lives for the passing heroes, remembering that their names no longer are personal, with all the attributes of the limited ego, but have become the property of pan-human culture, and must be safeguarded and firmly cared for in most benevolent conditions.\n\nThus we shall continue their self-sacrificing labor and we shall cultivate their creative sowing which as we see, is so often covered with the dust of non-understanding and overgrown with the weeds of ignorance.\n\nVery few are the spiritual discoveries of creative revelation. Hence we cannot excuse our negligence toward the leading lights because of the advance of the standard of life. Even though electric lights, which were a rarity not so long since, now burn upon every street, there still remains a treasure of new, and still-untried energies to be brought to us. Their manifestation in all branches is bound with the same self-denying sacrifices and labors, which should occupy public attention, because in this attention we seemingly collaborate with the creator, and in our benevolent thought-sending, intensify the possibilities of his discovery.\n\nAnd so among the activities of our cultural associations, let us assign a place worthy to mark creations and discoveries in all branches of art and science. Let us dedicate sincere thought to the progressive labors of the bearers of light—of those who come anew as well as those who pass on. Let it not be a doubtful shrug of the shoulders. Let it be not a cold obituary. But, as an honor-guard, let us protect these sprouts of light. Liberated from prejudices and superstitions, serving victorious beauty, uplifting knowledge, we shall apply in all measures and for all branches the zealous thought of affirmation of bliss, by thus helping the further branches of research and betterment of life.\n\nHow precious that our associations are in various countries! Thus it is easier to watch universally for the manifestations of creative power and researches, the easier for mutual interchange, to enrich each other with useful and encouraging information which otherwise might merge in the shoreless currents of closely printed chronicles. No one knows why it is absolutely necessary for the creators of true progress to be exiled and to depart from the earthly plane condemned.\n\nThe covenant repeatedly says not to be embers but to glow. Even the evil blazing, may be easily controlled by the conscious efforts of united cultural associations which are sincerely dedicated towards the creative cognizance.\n\nOf course our basic problem of action is to interchange all artistic expression between all our branches as well as all scientific discoveries, thus mutually acquainting ourselves with the spiritual values of all nations. And therefore, among plans of scientific and artistic discovery and the intercourse with which we are mutually enriched, let us not forget the noble work of gathering and establishing the cultural standards which so often may be ignored in the ebb and flow of life’s tides.\n\nAnd so, friends, let us introduce into our immediate program this interchange of constructive achievements already realized. And let us remember that the ignoring of cultural values is a shameful crime of ignorance. Therefore, let us untiringly and fearlessly strengthen each other and illumine the path which brings us closer to life.\n\nHimalayas, January 1, 1930.\n\ntop\n\nTRANSFIGURATION OF LIFE\n\n1930\n\nLast summer a robot was placed at the busiest cross-streets of London to direct traffic. At first this mechanical man performed his duties conscientiously and some people remarked jokingly in this connection that robots could be used for many tasks heretofore done by man. But after a cloudy day the sun appeared and its hot rays beat upon the robot, and apparently caused a local short circuit, for the robot, who was so splendidly replacing man, suddenly seemed to have gone mad, began frantically to wave his hands and for an entire hour threw into turmoil the most important traffic point of the metropolis. Policemen and mechanics were forced to apply extreme measures to put an end to this madness. Headlines in the newspapers commented on this extraordinary incident.\n\nAnother case was also recorded by the newspapers. During a boxing bout a robot was employed to keep the count and as a result confusion reigned in this favorite sport of today and even—horrors—money was lost. Again a very characteristic occurrence.\n\nWe must, however, see in this something which goes far beyond the limits of a street incident. The boundary of mechanization. The boundary of madness. How indispensable it is then to ponder over the necessity of establishing an equilibrium between spiritual energies and mechanical appliances. It is precisely now that the world civilization is deciding this most important problem. Not so very long ago people thought that photography could kill art and we still believe that the gramophone and the “talkies” can kill music and the theater. Did not wise men prophesy that in our day mankind would become blind from electricity and deaf from the telephone? A short time ago, motors were considered an impractical invention and the failure of the wireless telegraph and aviation was predicted. And now, when so many remarkable conquests have been bestowed upon humanity, how quickly people have succeeded in making an abominable standardization even out of the application of energy and of the elements, thus killing the possible enhancements of these conquests. Let us try to turn the regulator of an ordinary radio to see what there is on the air and infinity shall respond with a pandemonium, with Bedlam broken loose. In the same way all the maledictions of hate and envy are hanging in space and are destroying the healing prana.\n\nWe have reached the point when a human word can go around a planet in two minutes. But what does it impart at such speed? The news either of the stock exchange, or of sport or of clownery. Therefore, how necessary it is to use all means at our disposal to purify the quality of human thought so as not to depreciate and disfigure the splendid conquests of man’s genius. At times one already hears mention made in the schools of the need of developing the creative impulse and of organizing thoughts. If a deadly standardization is not made of this beneficial enterprise, then perhaps somewhere there might be felt a shock which will make the school generation ponder over the questions of elevated thought, of heroism, of self-denial and self-sacrifice. And then only will people understand the simple truth that in giving we receive and in sacrificing we are enriched. And this will not be understood in a narrow, material sense, but its spiritual meaning will be revealed in all its true wealth. This physiology of the spirit, of which one has to speak so often nowadays, will be a practical life principle which will once more bring the abstract into reality.\n\nIn our communities let us not be afraid of such syntheses of the idea of life, without pseudo-occultism and mysticism. Yes, we greet each great conquest of the spirit and of knowledge and we understand that mechanics may become true mechanics when the understanding of art is united to it.\n\nTherefore, through our friends, let us explain the all-penetrating understanding of the beauty of art, which shall save us from death-imparting standardization and from the pernicious debris of life. Over and over again we repeat that these are not commonplace utterances. We repeat that the idea of nobility and the dignity of thought is not hypocrisy, but a sign of true creative impulse brought forth by the Divine spark of the spirit in man. Mutually fortifying ourselves, let us say these same words to the school generations. And let us show them, at the same time, that we are not trying to humiliate them by giving them toys, but that we are earnestly calling them to cooperation. Does not every child feel proud when he is entrusted with the work of an adult? Only then does he act with circumspection and care, trying not to disgrace himself in the eyes of the grown-ups. We would like to call attention to the fact that children prefer the books of adults far more than the artificially “stylized,” so-called children’s books, in which some adults try to pull on children’s rompers. These reflections apply also to the mob, which, in fact, is far better than it is reputed to be. Only ignoramuses think that vulgarity is demanded by the mob. Thousands of examples could be cited to show that heroism inspires the crowd in a greater and more efficacious way than clownery or an insipid joke. Let heroism and nobility of thought be not an abstract notion for us, but let them become honored guests at our daily intercourses. And again let it not be an empty sound when we say that we shall devote all our strength to the positive principle of creative work. In studying the history of art, we see exactly what signs followed the constructive and the destructive moments. Unprejudiced and cautious, let us choose these sparks of positive creative impulse and let us try to bring them into our every-day life.\n\nHimalayas, February, 1930.\n\ntop\n\nTO WOMANHOOD\n\nDedicated to Woman's Unity of Roerich Museum\n\n1930\n\nThe Mother of the World. How much of that which is tremendously stirring and moving is blended in this sacred image of all ages and all peoples.\n\nIn cosmic waves this great conception moves toward the consciousness of man. In the spiral of accretion it appears sometimes as though receding, yet it is not a regression, it is only a phase of movement, inaccessible to our vision.\n\nTeachings speak of the epoch of the Mother of the World which has now begun. The Mother of the World, Near-to-all-hearts, Revered-by-all-minds, again takes Her place at the great helm. And he, who understands this Visage of Evolution, shall be happy and protected.\n\nIn an impressive and stirring way Christianity has consecrated the following legend to the Mother of God:\n\nThe Apostle Peter, sacristan of Paradise, was disturbed. And he said to the Lord God: “All day long I watch the gates of Paradise; I do not let anyone in, yet in the morning there are newcomers in Paradise.”\n\nAnd the Lord said: “Let us make the rounds at night, Peter.”\n\nSo they went in the night and they saw the Holy Virgin lowering along the wall Her snow-white scarf, up which souls were climbing.\n\nPeter took this to heart and wanted to interfere, but the Lord whispered: “Sh ... let be…”\n\nThe Orient has consecrated the following hymn to the Mother of the World.\n\n“Above Them is She Who veiled Her Face, She Who wove the Web of the far-off Worlds, She the Envoy of the Unutterable, the Ruler of the Intangible, the Bestower of the Unrepeatable.\n\n“By Thy Command is the Ocean silenced and the Whirlwinds trace the Invisible Signs.\n\n“And She Who Veiled Her Face shall stand Alone in Vigil, amid the Splendor of Her Signs.\n\n“And none shall mount the Summit. None shall witness the Effulgence of the Dodecahedron, the Sign of Her Power.”\n\nThe cult of the Mother of the World has been discovered in the ancient city of Kish, and the oldest literature of China has greeted the Mother of the World in inspired hymns. She is the Quick-to-Aid, She-of-the-Hundred-Hands and Of-the-Thousand Eyes, She Who protects by Her Veil all those who come for help. She, the Mother of the World, whether in the image of Kwan-Yin or in the bright colored mantle of the Madonna.\n\nThe marvelous Russian artist Maria Germanova, the Russian Duse, sent me last summer the following stirring and appealing letter which I am citing as a remarkable monument of the fiery heart of a woman.\n\nThis letter was the more appealing to the aspirations of our hearts, since the thought of a Woman’s Unity had crystallized itself with Mme. Roerich and myself into the forms of new organizations which, in the broadest measure, could summon the world to new constructions. In March, 1930, Mme. Roerich wrote to America of the need to organize a Woman’s Unity. And long before, the idea was formulated for the Altai Sisters—Sisters of the Golden Mountain. Frequently I hailed the women’s organizations. I also had written of the Great Mother of the World and the mysterious veil of Woman, and in this article, I asked, “Why, since antiquity, has the wreath been the true adornment of the woman’s brow? The wreath—that crown of achievement!” … Hence, in the name of this crown of Achievement, the letter of Mme. Germanova responded so greatly to our previous decisions. I quote it:\n\n“We lift our hearts to the Mountains…\n\n“There is an old proverb: ‘When the children are small, they are a burden for a Mother’s knees; When they grow up, for her heart.’ And, verily, children grow up, they outgrow us, they fly away from the nest; there is no more need to bathe, feed, clothe them; yet a Mother’s heart is just as full of cares, worries and prayers for her beloved ones.\n\n“A Mother’s heart, a woman’s heart, is a great treasure. It kindles us, it lights up the family. Who taught you to pray? Who will understand and forgive? The Mother. The Woman. Who will inspire to a great task?—The Beloved One, The Friend—The Woman.\n\n“Oftener and oftener, firmer and firmer, it is now being realized that the Era of the Woman has come, and many glowing lamps of the women’s hearts are kindled in solitude, in secrecy, and often in the bondage of darkness; but they are kindled by one fire—Love, by the beauty of Motherhood, of Womanhood.\n\n“If only we could unite in the time of this Fire, if only we could know that we are not alone!—how lightly and joyously the flame of our hearts would rise.\n\n“We, the Women, old, young, mothers, wives, friends, the happy and the lonely ones, if we were to gird ourselves by the might of Love, what a divine power would be erected, what resplendent harmony would take up arms against darkness and evil, to help all humanity, which at present is in unprecedented danger.\n\n“We shall save the earth. We shall transform life. In the Unity of our hearts we do not have to gather in clubs and societies; read reports, give lectures; and abandon for these our dear ones and our homes. No. Verily in the Home we shall carry our Light.\n\n“How much we can do! We shall cast ugliness, vulgarity, out of our everyday life, and we shall invite Beauty to come as a Guest into our homes.\n\n“We shall sweep away the dust and the spider-webs, not only from the corners of our houses, but also from our relationships, words, thoughts—in order that our spirits may breathe easily; we shall think not only of the meal but also that there should be no poison for the spirit. Let us cast out the poison of quarrels, gossip, slander, and give the honored place at our table to the laughter of joy.\n\n“When departing on a journey, or to work, let us not only take care of trunks and expenses, but also send forth pure, benevolent thoughts and prayers.\n\n“Yes, one cannot enumerate at one time all the possibilities of achievement which as a Promised Land lie before the Woman.\n\n“We shall lay down our souls for our beloved Ones.\n\n“Jeanne d’Arc saved her country.\n\n“We, if united, shall save the earth. There is no resurrection without a Golgotha, and so this call has a reason, because it comes out of the pain of one tortured woman’s heart, the heart of Madame Helena Roerich, who is in a foreign, far-off country, to which she came so self-sacrificingly to bring her service to Enlightenment. She is ill, alone, longing for her dear ones; separated from her husband and friends, who, because of inexplicable, unjust, incomprehensible reasons, are unable to secure visas and the possibility of consoling, calming, healing this sacred pain and sorrow of a Mother. Let us rise to the defense of this suffering heart. Let it be our oriflamme. It is purged by the fire of eternal suffering, and shall be as a Beacon Star which will lead us to Victory.”\n\n* * *\n\nThe letter was partly addressed to Helena Ivanovna Roerich who has written and spoken so glowingly of the Mother of the World. I am citing her inspiring reply:\n\n“Dear Maria Nikolaevna (Germanova)\n\n“I have received your inspiring letter and rejoice in spirit. Verily, the idea of creating an unity of the women of the world is at present more than timely.\n\n“During the hard days of cosmic cataclysms of human disunion and disintegration, of the forgetfulness of all of the highest principles of existence which give true life and lead to the evolution of the world, a voice must rise which calls to the resurrection of the spirit and to the carrying of the fire of achievement into all actions of life. And of course, this voice should be the voice of Woman, who has drunk the chalice of suffering and humiliation and has become forged in the highest patience.\n\n“Let Woman, Mother of the World, say, ‘Let There Be Light.’\n\n“Then what will this light be, and in what will the fiery achievement consist? In the lifting of the banner of Spirit upon which will be inscribed ‘Life, Knowledge and Beauty.’\n\n“Yes, only the heart of the Woman, the Mother, can gather under this banner the children of the whole world without difference of sex, race, nationality and religion.\n\n“Woman, Mother and Wife, witness of the development of man’s genius, can appreciate all the great significance of the culture of thought and knowledge.\n\n“Woman, the inspirer of beauty, knows all the power, all the synthetic might of Beauty.\n\n“And so at once let us assume the carrying of the Great Banner of the New Era—the Era of the Mother of the World. Let every woman expand the boundaries of her own hearth so as to encompass the hearths of the entire world. These multiple fires will strengthen and embellish her hearth.\n\n“Let us remember that each limitation leads to destruction and each expansion gives constructive energy. Therefore with all forces let us strive toward the expansion of our consciousness and the refinement of our thoughts and feelings so that through this fire we will be enabled to kindle our hearth.\n\n“Put into the foundation of this Woman’s unity the striving towards the true knowledge which does not know human demarcations. ‘But how can one reach the true knowledge?’ you will be asked.\n\n“Answer that this knowledge lies in your spirit, in your heart—be able to awaken it.\n\n“Striving toward beauty will be as the key to knowledge. This knowledge lies in each striving towards the General Good. This knowledge is scattered in all great teachings which have been given to the world. This knowledge is poured out in manifestations of the Cosmos, in each phenomenon, and only people who have lost the gift of observing Cosmic manifestations have lost the key to many of the mysteries of existence which could give them the understanding of the causes of all calamities which take place at present.\n\n“Therefore, gathering women-warriors of Spirit, direct them toward the carrying of this knowledge.\n\n“Humanity should realize the great Cosmic law, the law of Majesty, the law of greatness and equilibrium—of two as the basis of existence. All principles deprived of these two beginnings, call forth a lack of balance and destruction. But let the woman who has realized this law, and who is striving toward the equilibrium of the Beginnings, preserve all beauty of the Woman’s Image, let her not lose the tenderness of the heart, the finesse of feeling, the sacrifice and courage of patience.\n\n“You, my Dear, who have accepted with a sensitive heart the Teaching of the Lord, can become the calling and the leading one, kindling the souls of those who are ready, with the fiery Word of the Greatest Heart. Be able to give to each woman according to her consciousness and broaden the consciousness by light, careful touches without impeding the natural and individual growth of each one. Let each one develop herself in the direction closer to her, and bring out what is possible according to the level of her consciousness. Beauty is contained in manifoldness. Give all to one general foundation—the foundation of striving toward the General Good. Because the broadest cooperation is inscribed upon the Banner of the Lord. His Cupola contains all and everything! Let us manifest the broadest tolerance.\n\n“Sisters of the Golden Mountain, before us is a difficult and wonderful time. I send you the Call of the Heart. Be armed with the fire of striving, patience and courage, through all obstacles carrying the Banner of the Mother of the World—the Banner of Self-Sacrifice and Beauty—so that in the hour of victory, you may erect it upon the Peaks of the World.\n\n“My dear, I feel your heart, I feel our future united work, and I send you strength and joy of spirit for the creation of the great Unity. The Lord of the Heart is with us.\n\n“In spirit and heart with you,\n\n“H. R.”\n\n* * *\n\nIn great joy I answered Germanova with the following words:\n\n“Dear Maria Nikolaevna:\n\n“Verily I rejoiced at your note about the foundation of the Woman’s Unity of Roerich Museum. This thought is truly ever dear to me; and the dedication of your thought to Madame Roerich deeply touched me.\n\n“Who, if not woman, must now rise and unite in the name of Culture and the Beautiful? Because it was precisely a Woman who was destined to be first to proclaim the Resurrection.\n\n“To enumerate all that was accomplished and inspired by woman would mean to describe the history of the world. If we speak about the bringing of the Beautiful into the whole fullness of life; if we know that the predestined evolution rests upon the cornerstones of Beauty and Knowledge; then who shall be the most faithful ally and transmitter of these foundations into the depth of human consciousness?\n\n“A beautiful legend speaks about the coming Era of the Mother of the World. Under manifold garments human wisdom molds the very same image of Beauty, Self-sacrifice and Patience. And again must the woman ascend a new mountain, telling her dear ones about the eternal paths.\n\n“ ‘Sisters of the Golden Mountain’ will speak in the West. ‘Sisters of Altai’ will speak in Asia. Mothers, sisters, beloved ones—all this is impressed above tongues and earthly boundaries. Once more in this unity will be shown to us the one meaning of Beauty, the one achievement, the one all-binding and strength-giving Benevolence.\n\n“Better than others, the woman knows the element of fire, that element with which is bound the nearest future. From ancient times, the woman was called to the most sacred tests. And so now she is called to the most broad knowledge, because with her heart she will understand how variedly and cautiously one should kindle the fires of understanding and response.\n\n“Reaching the extreme line of disunion and demarcation, humanity again thinks about collecting and constructing. The paths of destruction already reach the abyss. The way of Evil already seems to show boundaries. And to measure the boundary of Evil against the boundlessness of good can only be achieved by comparing the relative limitedness of Evil with the infinity of Good. When all attempts of Evil have already been distorted in the horror of their impotence, then still boundless and unlimited will be the Legion of the Warriors of Light.\n\n“Verily, it is not only the gatherings of women, regretting something or condemning something, which have already become conventional; but the union of women in the valiant, living exchange of all creative possibilities of unity, calling for the realization of the Good through united work, that will give the desired results.\n\n“There have already been many different unions and societies; and yet we feel clearly that the unity of women which will weave the sparkling threads from the hearth through all Hierarchies into the Infinite, is especially needed now.\n\n“Life itself, in all its complexity, imperatively calls for builders. In the various comers of the earth women are dreaming: ‘Great countries are beyond the seas.’ It is just this image of the woman, striving toward the distant shore in the realization of the predestined treasures of the Spirit that I felt in this picture; and as the apotheosis of this spiritual striving, in the painting: ‘She Who Leads,’ I wished to give the resplendent striving of the woman who leads the seeker of achievements to the glorious peaks.\n\n“And the first distinction of this unity of women from any other unions, should be that its participants will come together with the purpose of bringing each one within her own boundaries, within her own knowledge and possibilities. This chalice of the soul-offering will illumine the gathering and transform the hard everyday life into the festival of labor and attainments.\n\n“It is a joy for me to feel that women are striving toward these great strongholds of Spirit. And to strive in the right direction means already to approach Victory.\n\n“And therefore, I wish you, Sisters of Altai, Sisters of the Golden Mountain, to conquer all fiery obstacles, to reject all fear and doubts—and unwaveringly, untiringly, heroically, patiently, to build the resplendent Zvenigorod erecting the Indestructible Kremlin of Beauty. And the sighing shall become the inspiration of Benevolence and in the Victory of the Spirit shall shine daring and exultation and Beauty.\n\n“In spirit with you,\n\nNicholas Roerich.”\n\nThus, the Woman’s Unity has already been formed, erected not through business calculations, but because of fervent, heart-felt yearning—because of the impulse of the heart which gives life to things on earth and above it.\n\nPresidents of the Branches of this Society have already been selected both in North and South America, as well as in Europe, and the new creative seeds again shall sprout on the Field of the Great Achievement.\n\nHow good it is that beauty and knowledge blend so indissolubly with the highest and greatest ideals and gain more strength on the steps leading to the great transfiguration of life.\n\nNow is a hard time.\n\nNo one should think that we have enough schools. No one should be satisfied with the fact that something has already been done. Creative work is insufficiently appreciated. Only to a small degree is it understood that ideas are not made with money. The world is living through a materialistic crisis of tremendous significance. Everybody feels that it is impossible to remedy currency by currency. Of course it is necessary to counteract it with other values. The treasure of the spirit, of the mind, of the conception of creative work and of illumination will be the only adequate panacea at the collapse of the superficial, mechanical civilization. The conventionality of uncognized life can be transformed only by that bright, affirming conception which is expressed in the word culture.\n\nAction cannot be deferred.\n\nRemember women, remember mothers, wives and sisters, remember that you are united by the beauty of spirit. Beyond the confines of everyday life a great feast is awaiting you. In the night the preparations have already begun; the lamps are being lit which are to illumine the Great Ascent of the Mother of the World. A marvelous spiritualization by Her resplendent Veil.\n\nWomen, it is you who are to weave and unfurl the banner of peace. You shall stand guard over the amelioration of life, you shall light at every hearth a beautiful fire, creative and inspiring. You shall tell your children the first word about beauty. You shall teach them the blessed Hierarchy of knowledge. You shall explain to the little ones the creative power of Thought. You can preserve them from disintegration and at the very beginning of their lives inculcate in them the meaning of heroism and self-sacrifice. You shall be the first to speak to the children of the advantages of spiritual values. You shall say the sacred word Culture.\n\nA great and beautiful work is entrusted to you, Women. Greetings to you!\n\ntop\n\nROOTS OF CULTURE\n\nOn The Tenth Anniversary Of The Master Institute\n\n1931\n\nTen years have already passed since we laid the foundation of the Master Institute of United Arts. How unnoticeably these ten years have gone by! Because during a multitude of circumstances and events, time moves with especial rapidity. As if it were yesterday one recalls how with M. M. Lichtmann we were hurrying to rent space in the Hotel des Artistes in New York. By accident we found ourselves delayed on the way, and due to this accident, as we entered the subway, we were accosted by a Greek artist with the unexpected extraordinary exclamation:\n\n“I have been looking for you for three months already! Do you need a large studio?”\n\n“Of course we do. Where is it?”\n\n“In the building of the Greek Church on 54th Street.”\n\n“All right, tomorrow we will go to look at it.”\n\n“No, impossible! I cannot keep it any longer; if you wish to see it, let us go at once!”\n\nAnd so instead of the Hotel des Artistes, we are seated with Father Lazaris of the Greek Cathedral, who insists that I must be of the Clergy. And here we decide to rent the space. And under the Cross of the Greek Cathedral is laid the foundation of the long-since conceived Institute of United Arts. It is a large studio, but only one room.\n\nSome one says to us: “Could you possibly dream of having an Institute of United Arts in one studio?”\n\nI answer, “For the conception of creation, one does not need a room larger than the cell of Fra Angelico. Each tree must grow. If the work is vital, it will develop, if it is destined to die, in any case it will have to die in one room.”\n\nAnd so the first piano studies resound through the studio, and the first dreams about painting, vocal and sculpture classes are realized. Soon the studio has to be divided into three parts, and life itself supports the idea of unity.\n\nThose connected with us are such experienced, creative guides as Giles, Such, Mordkin, the Lichtmanns, Grant, Germanova, Bisttram, Andoga, Wagenaar and Appia. Already we have seventy co-workers, working in different departments and hundreds of students fill the classes and halls. Already the new generation of teachers is growing, and Ellen Kettunen, Frieda Lazaris, Linda Cappabianca and others of our pupils form the second line of attack. Twelve years ago, based on long academic experience, I decisively affirmed the following statement:\n\n“Art will unify all Humanity. Art is one—indivisible. Art has its many branches, yet all are one. Art is the manifestation of the coming synthesis. Art is for all. Everyone will enjoy true art. The Gates of the ‘Sacred Source’ must be wide open for everybody, and the light of art will influence numerous hearts with a new love. At first this feeling will be unconscious, but after all it will purify human consciousness, and how many young hearts are searching for something real and beautiful! So, give it to them. Bring art to the people where it belongs. We should have not only Museums, Theaters, Universities, Public Libraries, Railway Stations and Hospitals, but even Prisons decorated and beautified. Then we shall have no more prisons.”\n\nI remember that at that time, certain friends smiled to each other, whispering, “Beautiful dreams, but how will life react to them?” But our chief principle is: “Admittance and benevolence.” We and our co-workers do not like the dead, “No”; and with each possibility make the effort to say, “Yes.” It is not without reason that all people express their affirmations by an open sound, and for negation have chosen the dumb, semi-bestial, “No.”\n\nWhat other considerations have been confirmed by the experience of the last ten years? Life has confirmed that all unity is useful; confirmed that it is practical (we do not fear this word) to have various branches of art under one roof, having one common library, a common office, a common artistic activity, common guidance and the closest intercourse between the separate branches. It is practical to afford the students the opportunity of trying their forces in various branches until they finally make their choice. It is practical that there be interchange of musicians, artists and designers. It is practical to show full trust in the teacher, letting him manifest his methods in life. The results will indicate whether he is right, because as in one’s entire life, we must judge by results. It is practical to give opportunity to students as soon as possible to try their forces in life, teaching them courage and safeguarding them from vulgarity. It is practical as was carried out by Howard Giles and Emil Bisttram, to have music during the work in art classes and to give lectures which by their artistic and philosophic content, may raise and unite the spirit of the entire artistic working guild.\n\nIt is practical to give examples from the history of art; thus we will once more learn to what extent art was the creative, peaceful basis in the entire life of the State. Chiefly, one must reject less, remembering that the majority of denials have ignorance as their basis; thus the teachers turn into guides, transmitting to the students not only technique, but also life’s experience, sharing with them the valuable acquisitions which will prove a strong shield for the new generation.\n\nHow often humanity, entangled in its problems, attempted to deny the significance of the teacher. In epochs of decadence, it was seemingly possible to shake the basic conception of the spiritual hierarchy. But not for long did this darkness last. With the epochs of renaissance again the great leadership of teaching was inevitably crystallized and people again began to feel the ladder of ascent and the blessed hand of the Leader. Many times small minds hesitate, fearing that they may be oppressed by the personality of the Teacher. Especially those who have little to lose often worry lest they lose something. In this regard, we now enter a very significant epoch. In certain strata of humanity, the spirit of denial has just succeeded in evoking a protest against the Teacher. But as always happens, denial can arise only temporarily, and the creative origins of humanity again lead the wanderers of life into the path of affirmation, of fearless search—to the path of creation and beauty. People again remember about the Teachers. Of course these teachers must not pertain to a grandfather’s study with all its petrified remains. The Teacher is He who reveals, enlightens and encourages. He who will say, “Blessed are the obstacles. Through them we grow.” He who recalls the beautiful Golgothas of knowledge and art, because therein lies the creative achievement. He who is able to remind, to teach the means of achievement—he will not be rejected by the strong spirits. He himself, will realize the value of the Hierarchy of knowledge; and in his constant movement will create the ascending researches.\n\nSo many schools and useful disseminators of knowledge can be organized in our societies. To all of them the same advice can be given; each tree can be planted only as a small sapling. Only gradually it will become tried and find steady roots. Therefore, if there is heartfelt desire to help the dissemination of knowledge and beauty, let it be fulfilled without delay. Let it not be handicapped by small possibilities. Practicality is not in the measure, but in the inner substance of the seed.\n\nHimalayas, 1931.\n\ntop\n\nCOLLECTING\n\n1930\n\nFrom ancient times collecting has been a sign of stability and introspection. It is very instructive to survey the various means and ways of collecting and of studying art from our days down to the heart of antiquity. Again, as in all the spirals of accretion, we see almost completed circles, yet at times, an almost elusive heightening of consciousness forms another step which is reflected in many pages of the history of art. We see how specialization and synthesis alternate. Collecting molded by the inner consciousness of the collector and united by one general idea is replaced by a classification almost pharmaceutical, sometimes destroying completely, by its pedantry, the fire of new discoveries. Not so long ago the combining of Gothic primitives with ultramodern aspirations would have been considered a proof of dilettantism. It would have been regarded altogether taboo to have simply a collection of beautiful medals and coins. Pedantry was wont to confine its scope of vision to a certain epoch, limiting it to objects of a certain type and character. Thus icons and primitives glowing with color, were turned into iconography in which the descriptive part obliterated the true and artistic meaning.\n\nThus, not very long ago the history of art was taught as a collection of anecdotes of painters’ lives, while the exposition of sculpture and the technique of painting were reduced to a summary of proportions and to the mechanics of construction, diverting and distracting attention from the essence of creative work. Peculiar text-books began to appear in which one would come across such chapters for instance, as: “How to paint a donkey,” in connection with which gray paint—which does not exist—was recommended. I remember that my attention was arrested on a boat by the typical argument between a mother and her little girl in which the mother earnestly asserted that the mountain in the distance was black, while the child affirmed candidly that it was blue. It seems to me that the mother’s eyes must have been dimmed by some text-book she was studying about the way to paint donkeys.\n\nWhat a joy it is for children, when, from their tenderest age, in their homes they see objects of true art and serious books. Of course, it is necessary that these artistic objects do not cease to “live” and do not find themselves in the pitiful situation of remaining upside down, sometimes for an entire decade—which means that the soul of the collector has long departed for the cemetery and that his heirs have for some reason become morally blind.\n\nDuring the very recent years we have had occasion to rejoice many times over the synthetic system of collecting which has again come into existence. Not afraid of being called eccentrics or dilettantes, the sensitive collectors have begun to group their treasuries of various objects according to an inner meaning. Thus, the most modern pictures could be combined with those masters who, in their time, burned with the unquenchable fire of bringing new ways to creative work.\n\nIn the newest collections one sees such giant pathfinders as El Greco, Giorgione, Peter Breughel and all the noble"
