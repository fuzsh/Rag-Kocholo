        "text": "Answer\n\nIs there truth to Dan Brownâs bestseller The Da Vinci Code? It is important to remember that The Da Vinci Code is entirely fictional. As much as author Dan Brown would like us to believe, The Da Vinci Code has no solid basis historically, biblically, or theologically. The Da Vinci Code is essentially an attempt to \"humanize\" Jesus Christ by inventing a story of how His true identity was distorted and hidden for nearly two thousand years. In the book, Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene and had children. Mary Magdalene and Jesusâ descendants were the âholy grailâ that carries the blood of Christ. The Da Vinci Code states that these facts about Jesus Christ were covered up by the early church in order to protect the idea of Jesusâ divinity. All the Christian books which told of Jesusâ relationship with Mary Magdalene were destroyed, and any evidence of such a relationship was covered up.\n\nAgain, The Da Vinci Code is fiction. It has no basis in reality. It is a well-written, entertaining book, but thatâs all there is to it. Dan Brown is of the persuasion that these ideas about Jesus are true. Since there is no historical, biblical, or theological basis for his beliefs, Dan Brown presented them in a fictional account. But the truth is that Jesus was not married to Mary Magdalene or anyone else. Jesus did not have any children. Yes, the early church attempted to destroy many âgospelsâ about Jesus, but they did so because they were almost universally recognized as heretical, not to cover anything up. Even these âgospelsâ only give hints of a relationship between Jesus and Mary Magdalene. The church did not cover up the truth about Jesus being married to Mary Magdalene. Rather, the church protected the truth about Jesus being God in the flesh (John 1:1, 14).\n\nThe Da Vinci Code is in reality an attack on the Person of Jesus Christ. People do not want to believe that Jesus is God or that He is the Savior, so they make up falsehoods about Him in order to create a false Jesus that they can believe in. That is what The Da Vinci Code is all aboutâpresenting a false view of who Jesus Christ truly was and then explaining why this âtruthâ has been \"hidden\" for nearly 2000 years."
