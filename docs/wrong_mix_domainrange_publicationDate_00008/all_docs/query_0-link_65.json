        "text": "I’m pretty terrified to start? because damn, this book is a worldwide bestseller book. I delayed myself long enough to finally decided to give it a go. I’ve set my eyes for the book for I don’t know how long already. I’m afraid it would be boring, so I decided to grab another book instead (⋟﹏⋞) Alright, here we go!\n\nGenre : Thriller, Mystery\n\nPage : 489 pages\n\nPublished :18th March 2003\n\nWhile in Paris, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is awakened by a phone call in the dead of the night. The elderly curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum, his body covered in baffling symbols. As Langdon and gifted French cryptologist Sophie Neveu sort through the bizarre riddles, they are stunned to discover a trail of clues hidden in the works of Leonardo da Vinci—clues visible for all to see and yet ingeniously disguised by the painter.\n\nEven more startling, the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sion—a secret society whose members included Sir Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo, and Da Vinci—and he guarded a breathtaking historical secret. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine puzzle—while avoiding the faceless adversary who shadows their every move—the explosive, ancient truth will be lost forever.\n\n“History is always written by the winners. When two cultures clash, the loser is obliterated, and the winner writes the history books.”\n\nHello Dan Brown, here I come!\n\nThe Da Vinci Code — Robert Langdon and gifted French cryptologist Sophie Neveu embark a life and death mission to uncover the puzzles of Priory of Sion.\n\nSo, I’ve read Origin before, another book by the almighty Dan Brown, and I felt okay with the book.\n\nFor The Da Vinci Code, I have long set my eyes on the book due to it’s unique and catchy phrase. I mean, look at those names! I could say it’s pretty intriguing. The Da Vinci Code? Ha. Count me in.\n\nOne of the best Dan Brown’s traits, is his likeliness to mix all the theories, reality, architectures, documents, fiction in one solid book. Like, I could randomly chose one term in the book and google it accros the web, it would come out with a logic and interesting result.\n\nIt’s quite a fun read, for there are hidden knowledge everywhere in the book. Robert Langdon is a professor framed for murdering Jacques – the curator of Louvre, as Robert’s name is written by Jacques himself before his death.\n\nFinding himself associated with Sophie- Jacques grand daughter who very much wanted to solve the murder, both try as best as they could to escape from the complicated framed situation whilst trying to gather bits of evidence Jacques seems to plant.\n\nThe first thing I love about this book is the complex plot and yes, the setting. I’ve never been to Louvre, but I would very much love to visit it one day. I mean, going there feels like a dream comes true.\n\nAnd I love how the setting in the book all comes so detailed. Detailed as in, the information is there on the internet, but it’s a kind of information people rarely knows about. I could tell you, all these detailed blend in so perfectly with the story.\n\nThere are even moments I stop my reading to search the web for a fuller description about what I just read in the book. It’s mind-blowing and I personally think it’s a fun way to learn too.\n\nAnyhow, the way this book contains all those real-fact settings and documents can’t be compare to any other books. It’s a win.\n\nFor the plot, I admit, is genius. This book is downright screaming “brilliance” from the beginning to the end. Personally, I find this book falls in the ‘okay‘ zone. I love how this book begins, how it introduce the characters, how the murder took bigger scale than it seems, and how the story progress as it goes.\n\nTruth to admit, I find it quite hard to read because there’s so much new knowledge to dig into. (not that I’m complaining, in fact, I feel happy with all these new stuff) it’s just sometimes because of this, I feel my reading progress doesn’t improve much because it’s addictive to dig into the web to read more about the information ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\n\nIt’s a good thing though.\n\nThe story feels so real that sometimes I don’t even know which is just a theory, which is fiction and which is the truth. This book is ‘that’ good in blurring the lines.\n\nAlso, I love the thrill. The cats and dogs moments of Langdon, Sophie and the police force. It’s chef kiss.\n\nHowever, as much as I love this book, I’m starting to get kind off um, bored? because I think this book is kind off never-ending although they indeed show steady progress.\n\nIn the beginning and up to the point of half of the book, I’m still excited for the book. But reaching the end, I think my interest for the book kind off depleting? I don’t feel ‘that’ excited anymore and I just want to finish the book as soon as possible.\n\nHowever, I am grateful for the book and I’m happy for reading it. Overall, it’s an okay read for me. I would very much recommend this book to anyone.\n\n“Everyone loves a conspiracy.”\n\nAuthor: Celine"
