        "text": "Dan Brown, a well-known professional in the field of criminal justice, a professor of criminal justice and political science at Southwestern Oklahoma State University, has completed his new book, \"Justifiable Homicide\": a detailed account across twenty homicides from different states in America. With this book, studying these cases is looking into how the justice system treats women who are charged for killing men.\n\nBrown shares, \"This book, Justifiable Homicide, exams twenty actual criminal cases where a woman has been charged with the crime of murder as the result of a homicide where the victim is a man. What does the criminal justice system do with a woman who is on trial for murder? An interesting question. The answer may surprise any person who reads this book.\"\n\nPublished by Covenant Books of Murrells Inlet, South Carolina, Dan Brown's new book contains a study across murders where the victims were men and the perpetrators were women. It brings forward a different perspective as to how the American jury runs justice between the two sexes.\n\nReaders can purchase \"Justifiable Homicide\" at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iTunes store, Amazon, or Barnes and Noble.\n\nCovenant Books is an international Christian owned and operated publishing house based in Murrells Inlet, South Carolina. Covenant Books specializes in all genres of work which appeal to the Christian market.
