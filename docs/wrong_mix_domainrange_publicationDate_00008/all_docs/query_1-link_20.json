        "text": "January 3, 2019\n\nI don’t get all the haters of the Dan Brown books. Are you really going in with the expectation that these books are going to be award-winning, works of art? If so, do you critique every book you read with that same expectation? It would be a pity if you did.\n\nLike movies, I don’t expect every one I watch to be an Academy Award winner. If I did, that would certainly narrow the number of films I’d see. No, I go to be entertained (whatever that may mean on any particular day). That’s the way I look at the books I read, particularly fiction, and I think Dan Brown’s books are very entertaining. They are a fictional escape.\n\nWe’ve all seen the stats that show how few books Americans are reading these days (present company excluded) and I think these types of books are an excellent way to get the masses to pick up, read, listen and get back involved in books. That’s what it is all about…like starting children with books from an early age, once they’re in, who knows where it can lead them. I want more of my friends to read books and if this is the hook, then I’m happy to bait it and reel them in.\n\nMy personal opinion of the Lost Key Symbol was that I liked it, but after reading all his other books I found this one more predictable. Still it was entertaining and I recommend it. I think many others will enjoy it as well.\n\nSeptember 19, 2009\n\nThis book is both poorly written and impossible to put down.\n\nI think that about sums it up.\n\nApril 18, 2022\n\n(C-) 56% | Very Unsatisfactory\n\nNotes: Its secret society has no intriguing back-story, the villain is inappropriate and asinine, and the end revelation is lame.\n\nSeptember 22, 2009\n\nI have such issues rating Dan Brown books... I want 1.5 stars, I think. Snark ahead.\n\nHere's the deal: the man can't write. He's a name-brand & url spewing, Wikipedia-like fountain of knowledge, who CAN'T HANDLE VERB TENSES. He also likes really short sentences. That aren't sentences at all. Really. Expect iPhone, Twitter, and Google shout-outs, too. I'm almost surprised he didn't mention the inevitable hash #thelostsymbol and tell us to use it when we tweet about what we just learned.\n\nOn the flip side, who doesn't love a good romp around a famous city solving mysteries with art and science and religion? You know the drill, and the formula hasn't changed here in the slightest.\n\nAs a former DC resident of 7 years, I have to admit, I was expecting slightly more from the location, but Langdon and his companion du jour keep getting trapped in random places, so it's a bit disappointing on that front. He does get 10 points for a hilarious caper including the Blue Line out to the King Street station though and the Red Line to Tenleytown (yeah, Tenleytown shout-out, what up!)\n\nThis book's wacky science theme is Noetics, and the quasi-religious thing at hand is the Masons. Since the first thing that comes to mind re: Noetics is Fringe, I sort of expected a Pacey Witter guest appearance, but alas, it was not meant to be. I know absolutely zip about the Masons, but who wants to bet their membership applications go through the roof this month?\n\nSo my final verdict: did I hate it as much as Catcher in the Rye? No. (Will I ever hate any book as much as I hate Catcher in the Rye? Unlikely. BUT THERE'S TIME.) Is it the best Robert Langdon book? Not by a long shot. Angels & Demons still is the best of the trilogy. Is it still vaguely enjoyable in the way only a Dan Brown book can be? Yes. Does Dan Brown's copy editor need to be publicly humiliated? YES AND HIS NAME IS APPARENTLY JASON KAUFMAN (according to the Acknowledgements, so I'm not like, stalking anyone here) AND GOOD LORD MAN, ONLY YOU CAN PREVENT FOREST FIRES CAUSED BY PEOPLE BURNING THIS BOOK EDIT THIS INTO SOMETHING ENJOYABLE. EVERY TIME DAN BROWN DOESN'T KNOW HOW A VERB WORKS, KITTENS DIE.\n\nAlso, if I ever have to read the words \"neutered sex organ\" again, I will be forced to remove my eyeballs and then pour bleach directly onto my brain.\n\nOne more P.S., since I tweeted this and then forgot to include this here: Most unbelievable part of the plot? The Redskins are in the playoffs AND score on their opening possession. PLEASE TRY AGAIN, YOU FAIL AT HAVING SPORTS KNOWLEDGE.\n\nOctober 23, 2022\n\nاهنيء نفسي على نهاية الرمز المفقود..بعد ان تم فقداني بداخلها لاكثر من شهرين\n\nلماذا؟ حسنا\n\nالرواية هرم متكامل براق لتمجيد الماسونيين الكيوت الاخيار الطيبين\n\nا\"لو تم نشر هذه الطقوس ستتم الاطاحة بالحكومة\n\n..سيمتلىءالشارع بالمناهضين للماسونية و الاصوليين..\n\n.سيتم تشويه الحقيقة ..كما يحصل دائما مع الماسونيين \"؟!!؟ا\n\nهكذا هتف لانجدون بتلك الكلمات مذعورا..و هو ليس ماسونيا\"على الاطلاق\"و\n\nاعلم جيدا ان امريكا دولة ماسونية منذ نشاتها..و انا اقرأ رواية امريكية..و يجب ان اخضع لشروطها..و لكنك كلما تقدمت في السن..ازددت تمسكا بقناعاتك و نحن كعرب و مسلمين تربينا بالطبع على المؤمراة الماسونية الكبرى\n\nلذا كان من الصعب التعاطف مع بيتر الثري المحسن المخطوف..مبتور اليد..و محاولات لانجدون المحمومة لاعادته سليما\n\nالسبب الثاني انني كشفت\"سر الخاطف \"مبكرا جدا مما قتل التشويق نوعا. .و كان هناك جو من الملل و الرتابة غير مألوف بالمرة في روايات براون الضخمة\n\nو لكن هناك ايجابيات\n\nانا من كبار عشاق الالغاز و الرموز..و كم كان ممتعا الوقت الذي قضيته مع المكعب الحجري و الهرم الذهبي. .كم هو مبهر ان يحتوي شيئا صغيرا على كل هذه الطبقات من الاسرار القديمة المعقدة\n\nالفصل الواحد لا يزيد عن 3صفحات والمعلومات خرافية متكدسة في 480 صفحة و 133فصلا..و كانت اكثر مما يجب احيانا مما يمنح الرواية طابع الموسوعة او القاموس..💫\n\nاول مرة طبعا اسمع عن حوض التجريد الحسي..و عن الااااف المعلومات المدهشه عن واشنطون ..كاني زرتها\n\nوكان هذا يقتل التشويق احيانا ..و يفصلك عن المغامرة التي استغرقت يوم واحد كالعادة\n\nاحببت جدا شخصية العالمة الذكية العقل والروح \"كاثرين\"و بعيدا عن فك الرموز احسست ان لانجدون كان مفعولا به في اغلب الاوقات..و\n\nموقف الغرق كان من افضل ما قرات في حياتي\n\nما زال موقفي من الماسونية كما هو.. رغم هذه الجرعة المكثفة من الكيوتنس ..ولا اقدر فيهم الا الشق الهندسي..فهم في النهاية \"البناؤن الاحرار,,و كان دور المهندس بيلامي مميزا حقا\n\nهناك شيء مفقود من روح دان براون في هذه الرواية ..اسلوبه مهتز كانه غير مقتنع تماما بالموضوع ..و لكن تظل المعلومات تجذبك لانهاءها\n\nOctober 12, 2009\n\nI liked Angels and Demons and I really liked The DaVinci Code but this latest of Dan Browns thrillers was barely worth the time, and definitely not worth the money.\n\nThe Lost Symbol follows the familiar Dan Brown formula - an ominous conspiracy, a threat to end the world as we know it, a relentless villain, and a search for hidden secrets which require the decoding of obscure clues. This formula has given us a couple of fine thrillers, and has taken advantage of the authors familiarity with arcane history, philology, symbolism, art and architecture. But even this intriguing texture would not be terribly interesting without the intrepid symbologist Robert Langdon to lead us through the perilous labyrinth at high speed. This time, Langdon must find the Freemason’s grand secret hidden in Washington, D.C. and evade both the CIA and a brilliant but scary villain, while rescuing a kidnapped friend and his sister.\n\nThe DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons were both intriguing and thrilling enough to overcome Mr. Brown's weak writing. But because The Lost Symbol’s plot is so much weaker, Brown’s sophomoric writing becomes much more obvious and ever more bothersome as the work progresses. For example, the formulaic mini-cliffhangers at the end of nearly every chapter became trite and annoying manipulations. Brown also employed several set-pieces of lecture and discovery that annoyingly repeat themselves. This book is full of Brownian cliches.\n\nI think that the credibility of this work is further undermined by using characters who are simultaneously brilliant and clueless. For instance, the intrepid and brilliant professor Langdon, who by now should be rather wary of mysterious invitations, flies to Washington D.C. at a moment's notice supposedly at a friend's request but without actually speaking to his friend. And even less credible, is that without direct confirmation, he brings with him a top-secret package that he swore to keep hidden at all costs.\n\nSimilarly, the brilliant scientist Katherine doesn’t think to back up her life’s work of scientific research, and she allows a man she's met only once into her \"top secret\" laboratory because she receives a TEXT message purportedly from her brother who she admits doesn’t even know how to text. And these are not the only naive, and clueless people who should know better. The police and security guards are all hapless,and even the CIA director fails to question whether a suspect is lying when he says \"I'll be there in 20 minutes.\"\n\nMore disappointing still is that the main character of Robert Langdon seems to have been dumbed down in this book. He repeatedly is adamant about thus and such only to be subsequently shocked when the true meaning is revealed. He always requires two attempts to decipher the true meaning of clues - the first one which is obvious and turns out to be wrong, followed by the shocking epiphany. One would think that a Harvard professor would eventually learn that things are not always what they seem. In this work Robert Langdon spends more time being lectured than he does solving mysteries or puzzles. My recollection is that he figured out absolutely nothing critical in the last third of the book.\n\nEven more troubling than Brown’s weak and cliched characterization is that as the thriller reaches its climax, it becomes clear that the pieces do not fit together well. For instance, for most of the story, both the villain, and the CIA insist the stakes couldn't be higher, but in the end we learn that the potential danger is merely some bad public relations for a few powerful Masons. Why then is the CIA involved in this extortion plot - especially since it is legally barred from domestic law enforcement? The author simply fails to provide justification for all the black opps of the CIA counter- conspiracy despite their central role in the story.\n\nThere are lots of problems with this book, but perhaps the its greatest flaw is Dan Brown’s failure to ever explain the main premise for the book, something he calls the Ancient Mysteries. The primary force that propels the plot is the implicit promise that in the end, a tangible secret will be uncovered. While the protagonist keeps asking if this grand secret is merely metaphorical, he is assured by friends, enemies and even the CIA that the secret is literal and potentially dangerous. But, in the end we learn that the grand secret for which people are willing to sacrifice their lives and fortunes doesn’t really exist. What exactly is the point of the pyramid and the secret codes and symbols if the grand mystery is already found in every church, in nearly every home, and in even in all the hotel rooms in the country? Doesn't that make the entire plot pointless to begin with?\n\nOK, if it’s not clear yet, HERE IS THE BIG SPOILER: The great Masonic secret is the most widely published and read book in history - it is the Bible. Brown’s thesis is that the Bible is loaded with hidden wisdom, and once these biblical secrets are pointed out, people are going to be shocked that they didn't see them before. And then they are going to be transformed because they now know that they're one with God, or they're the same as God, or they are made of God, or some such new age mumbo-jumbo. So in the end the whole purpose of all the elaborate secrecy is that a few people think mankind may not be ready for a new age when human potential will be finally unleashed. So for centuries the inner circle of Masons have concocted elaborate means to hide this enlightenment from a world not ready for apotheosis. And so despite all the symbols and codes, the grand secret is really kept hidden in plain sight. So pay no attention to the coded mysteries behind the curtain.\n\nThe ending of this story is an embarrassment. It may be the most anti-climactic, unsatisfying ending I have ever read. While the story kept claiming that earth shattering secrets were soon to be revealed, in the end all the paintings, pyramids, talismans, and other clues turned out to lead to nothing. They resolved nothing, they didn’t even leave us with a mystery yet unsolved. The mystery was solved, and it was an inconsequential whimper instead of a revelatory bang. It is my opinion that the author could not pull together the novel in the last chapters simply because there was nothing to pull together. There was no sweeping statement to be made and no grand secret to be revealed. This left me very unsatisfied at the story’s end.\n\nTheological addendum:\n\nMany Christians are offended by the idea of apotheosis which seems to be a core premise of Brown’s Masonic heroes. Though the idea of human deification has a long and ancient history in Christian thought, these critics have disowned the notion that Man can become like God, and consequently are offended when Brown places this mystery at the apex of his new-age amalgam of Masonry, religion and pseudo-science.\n\nAs a Latter-day Saint (Mormon), I believe that having been literally created in God’s image, we each have the innate potential to become glorified and exalted through obedience to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. My belief that man can become like god, is akin to the belief of Christian writers through the ages from Irenaus to C.S. Lewis. So deification doesn’t offend me at all. Ironically, however, I find myself in strong agreement with Christian critics who accuse Brown of idolatry for claiming that this apotheosis can occur merely through our own mystical consciousness raising efforts.\n\nThe central message of the Bible, and most especially the New Testament is that such a dramatic transformation can only occur on God’s terms and by means of his power and grace. In contrast, Brown attempts to “spiritualize” or metaphorize all particularity and literal meaning out of the biblical text. To Brown’s heroes, the real meaning of the text is whatever the true mystic wants to find hidden within. His new-age hodge podge of religion is very convenient,non-demanding, self-asserting and self-serving. It is the opposite of God’s revealed truth which requires self-less obedience and devotion to God and our fellow men. The Bible’s central message of obedience and faith is not found in Brown’s mystical amalgam, nor in any other brand of humanism.\n\nBrown ironically attempts to bolster his view of an impersonal God and a godless salvation by selectively quoting the Bible, a book which persistently and powerfully testifies of a personal God - a Father in Heaven who knows us individually, and cares about helping us overcome our sins more than developing our mental, or psycho-kinetic capacities. I agree with those critics who claim that the God described, or implied by Brown is an idolatrous invention of man as surely as that of Odin, Zeus, Baal, or the God of the Greek philosophers whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere.\n\nIn my view, Brown’s mishmash of new age nonsense intending to avoid dogma and doctrine, has very little point except to highlight that humans have enormous untapped potential. I don’t see anything revealing or revolutionary about this truism. I cannot conceive of such a benign observation creating any paradigm shift, nor can I imagine it unleashing pent-up human capacity. On the contrary, I think it is mankind’s persistent attempts to ignore the substantive teachings of the Bible that have bound us to telestial mediocrity.\n\nEven so, I suspect this theological critique is probably a bit over-the-top when you consider that this book is just a work of adventure fantasy. The Lost Symbol ought not to be taken too seriously. I don’t imagine that it will shape many people’s views of God, the Bible, or even religion in general. I don’t see The Lost symbol as much of a threat to my sacred beliefs, even though I thought I might as well throw in my two bits on the matter.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nDecember 6, 2009\n\nI really enjoy Dan Brown's stories. I have read Angels and Demon and The Da Vinci Code, I am currently reading Deception Point and plan on reading Digitial Fortress. I absolutely love his story telling. I have read mixed reviews and I think the negative reviews are just really people who are too serious in life. For goodness sake it is a book for entertainment, not a non-fiction story. Though I have read some non-fiction stories that are more fiction then Dan Brown's book. Brown's books are entertaining and make you look at thing in different ways which is good. Everytime I pick up Brown's book, I am totally immersed in the story and at the edge of my seat wanting to know what happens next. I can't wait until the next book.\n\nIt took me a bit longer to finish this book then I expected, but I am so glad that I read it. Again, Dan Brown delivers a thought provoking story in his unique style. I know others really dislike Brown's style of writing saying that it follows a formula of the ultra dramatic and the never ending cliff hanger chapters, but I just don't tire of that at all. A great thrilling read. I can't wait to read the next Dan Brown book!\n\nAugust 27, 2021\n\nThe Lost Symbol (Robert Langdon, #3), Dan Brown\n\nThe Lost Symbol is a 2009 novel written by American writer Dan Brown.\n\nIt is a thriller set in Washington, D.C., after the events of The Da Vinci Code, and relies on Freemasonry for both its recurring theme and its major characters.\n\nIt is the third Brown novel to involve the character of Harvard University symbologist Robert Langdon, following 2000's Angels & Demons and 2003's The Da Vinci Code.\n\nRenowned Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is invited to give a lecture at the United States Capitol, at the invitation apparently from his mentor, a 33rd degree Mason named Peter Solomon, who is the head of the Smithsonian Institution.\n\nSolomon has also asked him to bring a small, sealed package which he had entrusted to Langdon years earlier.\n\nWhen Langdon arrives at the Capitol, however, he learns that the invitation he received was not from Solomon, but from Solomon's kidnapper, Mal'akh posing as Solomon's assistant, who has left Solomon's severed right hand in the middle of the Capitol Rotunda in a recreation of the Hand of Mysteries.\n\nMal'akh then contacts Langdon, charging him with finding both the Mason's Pyramid, which Masons believe is hidden somewhere in Washington, D.C., and the Lost Word, lest Solomon be murdered.\n\nLangdon meets Trent Anderson, head of the Capitol police, and Inoue Sato, the head of the CIA's Office of Security.\n\nSato claims that Mal'akh poses a threat to the national security of the U.S. and that his capture is more important than Peter's rescue, although she refuses to elaborate.\n\nExamining Solomon's hand, they discover a clue leading them to Solomon's Masonic altar in a room in the Capitol's sub-basement, where they find a small pyramid lacking a capstone, with an inscription carved into it. ...\n\nعنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «نماد گمشده»؛ «طلسم گمشده»؛ «نشان گم شده»؛ «نشانه ی گمشده»؛ »هزارتوی اسرار»؛ «رمز گمشده»؛ نویسنده: دن براون؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز بیست و پنجم ماه دسامبر سال 2009میلادی\n\nعنوان: نماد گمشده؛ نویسنده: دن براون؛ مترجم: نوشین ریشهری؛تهران، نگارینه، 1388؛ در 672ص؛ شابک 9789642300068؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا -

Pace, suspense, mystery, humor and characters all good but everything feels just too repetitive. At this point, I'm starting to think that the problem partly lies with me since I'm reading the entire series in one go, as opposed to the average reader having at least a year between consecutive releases. So, I'm going to keep this one short without making the review a rant. If you're looking for sheer entertainment, this could work quite well for most, but that's pretty much all the good I could say. I'm convinced more and more that reading RL books back to back is a bad idea as this series unfolds.\n\n\"To live in the world without becoming aware of the meaning of the world is like wandering

17, 2021\n\nDan Brown - image from AARP - photo by Drew Gurion\n\nWhen one picks up a Dan Brown book there are certain expectations. First one can look forward to a fast-based adventure pitting the intellect of Robert Langdon against dark forces intent on creating mayhem of one sort or another. One expects that religion or religious institutions will play a central role in the story. One can expect that there will be puzzles to be solved and mysteries within mysteries. One can expect murderous sociopaths and police of questionable loyalty. One can expect that there will be a considerable quantity of payload in the form of interesting, arcane information. One can expect that once begun it will be a difficult book to put down. And Brown delivers on all of the above. If you are looking for great literature, look elsewhere. That is not Brown’s beat. Be prepared for some eye-rolling, as hyper-intelligent people make glaringly stupid decisions, all in the service of moving the plot along. And there are some notions at the end of the book that may be a bit much to swallow. But it is all in fun. It is what it is. Enjoy.\n\nThe TV min-series based on the novel premiered on September 16, 2021 on Peacock\n\nSumalee Montano as Agent Sato, Ashley Zukerman as Robert Langdon, Rick Gonzalez as Nunez - image and text from The Hollywood Reporter - image from Peacock\n\n=============================EXTRA STUFF\n\nLinks to the author’s personal, Twitter, GR and FB pages\n\nA few other DBs for your consideration\n\n-----Angels & Demons\n\n-----The Da Vinci Code\n\n-----Inferno\n\nMay 3, 2020\n\nI enjoyed reading Angels & Demons and The Da Vince Code, but Brown wasted a plot, wrote poorly and with less suspense, inner logic, and momentum. A reason might be that it´s hard to write series in the genre of epic, eyeopening, world shattering blockbuster epiphany hybrid thrillers, but at least the editors could truly have tried to make this better, it was disappointing to be left with such a facepalmy ending and a general meh feeling.\n\nThe worst thing about such literary fails is that one is waiting for the action, the logic, the conclusion towards the end and then nothing, just lol rofl facepalm. Believe me, if you read (don´t do it) it, you will feel this immense disappointment when realizing that this is the explanation, the reason why you invested hours of time to be Brown pranked, browned, whatever.\n\nThe reason might be that there is not just the stupid premise, but the missing good, well written and credible metaplot, the action, and the sheer freshness of the mentioned works and that it seems to me like a failed approach of producing the next mind penetrating revolution in the thriller market without using the working recipe for whatever reason. There would be so many conspiracy theories in different cultures that could be used to write series about, but this is a no go. I don´t understand why neither Brown nor the proofreaders saw this coming, so it remains the only interesting mystery surrounding this concoction.\n\nTropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique:\n\nhttps://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...\n\nNovember 12, 2022\n\nThis is one of my least favorite books by Dan Brown in the Robert Langdon series. There are indeed some thrilling elements that are usually seen in Dan Brown’s books, like clues, secrets, conspiracies, and history. The narration and plot were also engaging in the initial part.\n\nThe kidnapping of Langdon’s mentor Peter Solomon and Langdon’s attempt to save him will initially take us on a roller coaster ride. But after some time, the readers will lose interest in the book as we have read so many similar stories. The ending was the most disappointing part. These might be the reasons why the people in Tinsel town discarded the option of making the silver-screen version of it.\n\nIf you are a fan of the Robert Langdon series and have read all other books, you can opt for this book. Please go into this book without much expectation, as there is a high chance that you will be disappointed otherwise.\n\nMarch 26, 2013\n\nI liked this novel actually better than DV Code and A & D, which is ironic as it wasn't quite the page turner as those were, but the plot and ideas were more believeable. I was very interested in The Masons, as they were so much a part of the early patriotic/revolutionary era of the US. As usual there is a gruesome evil person, with superhuman like skills and power. The whole story covers just 24 hours...wow, what a day!\n\nInteresting insight from Brown on the Masons or Noetic Science?: \"a temple of God\" refers to the \"temple\" of the brain; how \"the created,...becomes the Creator\"; when the eye is single, your body fills with light\". For me the last part of the book added to my personal confirmation of what faith is, and that \"our minds can generate energy capable of transforming physical matter.\" I believe as Katherine stated, \"As soon as we humans begin to harness our true power, we will have enormous control over our world..and be able to design reality, rather than merely react to it.\"\n\nHow about this idea: God created us in his image, but not just our physical bodies resemble him, but our minds! Now that's a a great idea, and correlates with my LDS belief that we were all intelligences first, even before our spirits were created. Because of this, we have God-like potential power, and indeed can become like him. We just haven't learned all that is necessary ...yet. Interestingly, he refers to the Hebrew meaning of God, Elohim, which is plural. Hmmm, gives lots to think about, especially if you don't believe in God, or if your belief in God is limited.\n\nLove this idea also on p. 563, There are those who create, and those who tear down. The dynamic has existed for all time.\n\nAnother perspective of atonement....\"gathering what is scattered...to bring order from chaos, to find \"at-one-ment\", from this vantage point, His characters discuss the inherent power of prayer groups, healing circles, singing in unison, worshipping en mass... unfortunately, no mention of Christ in that view, but there is still much truth there. \"We have barely scratched the surface of our mental and spiritual capabilities.\" Can you believe a popular fiction novel promoting such eternal truths? I'd love to talk to others about this, but my husband disliked the book. I thought it was great.\n\nJanuary 12, 2022\n\nLibro controversial sobre la religión y la ciencia, aunque a mí, me ha encantado.\n\nEl tiempo es un rio... y los libros son barcos. Muchos volúmenes parten por esa corriente, pero encallan y se pierden en sus arenas. Solo unos pocos, muy pocos, resisten la prueba del tiempo y viven para bendecir los siglos sucesivos.\n\nDesde que leí el primer libro de Dan Brown, que fue Ángeles y Demonios, mentalmente lo he catalogado como un autor talentoso y muy valiente. Talentoso porque escribe muy bien sus novelas, y mantiene al lector enganchado todo el tiempo con sus conspiraciones y con las aventuras de Robert Langdon, su protagonista; valiente, porque escribir sobre Dios siempre, pero siempre, crea polémica en cualquier rincón del mundo sin importar nuestras creencias. Si declaras tú fe por Dios, te caerá una lluvia de burlas de parte de miles de escépticos; si declaras que eres ateo, los más religiosos empezarán a despreciarte por tus ideales. Y sí, con lo que acabo de escribir se puede llegar a la conclusión de que el problema no es la fe, ni Dios, sino el problema es la falta de tolerancia y respeto que tenemos hacia los demás porque no piensan igual que nosotros. Pero, volviendo al tema del autor, atreverse a escribir una saga en la que sus libros exponen diferentes teorías sobre Dios, es igual de osado que lanzarse desde un gran trampolín, con los ojos cerrados, y sin saber si en la parte de abajo la piscina tendrá agua: Atrevido, pero interesante; atrevido, pero original. No sé si es confianza excesiva, simple osadía, o si no le importan las críticas, pero su intrepidez lo hace un autor muy especial. Dan Brown, es un autor el cual puede ser fuertemente criticado, pero también puede ser muy elogiado, todo dependiendo de la disposición del lector. La única forma de saber si nos gustarán los libros de Dan Brown es arriesgándonos y leyéndolos. Es la única forma porque no es recomendable crear una imagen de él, confiando en el criterio de las demás personas cuando la fe, y las creencias, están de por medio.\n\nEs más, puede volverse aún más complicado. ¿Por qué? Porque según mi opinión, el segundo libro, llamado El código da Vinci, no es recomendable para los lectores que son muy fieles a Dios, y que les molesta que «inventen» historias sobre los santos, la Virgen María, Jesucristo, y demás. Pero, este tercer volumen, siento que no está orientado para las personas que no creen en Dios. Es más, a algunos creyentes también les molestará. Irónico, ¿verdad? Pues sí, y mucho. Pero esa es la conclusión a la que he llegado, después de leer un texto el cual presenta una teoría muy radical sobre la ciencia y su vínculo con la religión, la biblia, capacidades extrasensoriales del ser humano, etc. Es un texto que propone una teoría sobre el mundo y la humanidad tan diferente de todo lo que había conocido, que me ha dejado pensando mucho durante varias noches sobre la posibilidad de que algo así fuera realidad. Y lo he pensado porque la verdad me encantaría que fuera realidad. Y sí, sé que es ficción, pero es que el autor presenta la información de tal manera que todo empieza a tener sentido. Si la vida fuera tal y como se describe en susodicha teoría, encontraríamos miles de respuestas a miles de acontecimientos que no tienen sentido en nuestra historia: Sería fantástico. Pero naturalmente, esto solo es una conspiración, y como toda conspiración siempre se presentan los datos de forma apropiada para que la teoría parezca realidad. El problema es que amo las conspiraciones, y por ello, esta en especial me ha dejado completamente maravillado. Como se pueden dar cuenta es muy complicado dar una opinión personal sobre el tema principal de esta novela, teniendo en cuenta que puedes perder la imparcialidad dependiendo de que tanto crees en la conspiración que presenta Dan Brown.\n\nAhora bien, retirando de por medio el tema religioso que es tan importante aquí, se puede describir esta novela como un thriller muy trepidante. Me molestó al inicio que presentaran demasiados flashbacks porque se alteró mucho el ritmo del argumento, y también que repitieran algunas informaciones ya que los personajes estaban descubriendo datos que como lectores ya conocíamos, pero después de una parte el libro toma un ritmo frenético de aventura, peligros, muchísima acción, secretos, criptología, etc. Es demasiado adictiva esta lectura, y más teniendo en cuenta el uso de capítulos cortos. Les juro que no quería parar de leer. Fueron 622 páginas que devoré con un hambre voraz. No sentí cansancio, no me aburrí nunca, el argumento me pareció súper interesante, e incluso quedé con ganas de leer La Biblia. Con eso lo digo todo.\n\nLos personajes han estado bien desarrollados, no en exceso, pero sí con la suficiente información para que cada uno cumpla su rol. No obstante, si tuviera que pensar en un personaje para destacar, naturalmente me inclinaría por el antagonista. Podría decirse que está sugestionado por tantas creencias, ritos y demás, pero en verdad es un personaje muy malvado. Además, es muy inteligente, por lo que sus planes son brillantes y da gusto conocerlos. También posee un pasado muy, pero muy bien pensado, y aunque al principio sentí pereza por conocer su historia ya que interrumpía el ritmo de la novela, a medida que fui avanzando dejé de sentir eso porque el autor nos presenta más trozos de su historia, y cada vez su vida se va tornando más, y más interesante. Un gran villano que le aportó a la historia crímenes, violencia, brutalidad, y mucha, pero mucha maldad. El mejor personaje del libro ha sido el antagonista.\n\nEn resumen, una historia que jamás tendrá película porque es demasiado controversial y puede ser criticada fuertemente tanto por los religiosos, como los apasionados por la ciencia. No comprendía la razón por la que muchas personas detestan esta historia, pero después de reflexionar creo entender que se debe a las «creencias» que mencioné anteriormente. Naturalmente, si yo encontrara un libro donde ofendieran, o contaran una historia diferente de mi familia, que es lo más sagrado para mí, pues lo más normal sería odiar aquel libro con toda la fuerza de mi corazón. Por ello, comprendo a quienes no les gusta este libro, su opinión es muy respetable.\n\nProsa genial, ritmo genial (no al inicio), adrenalina, crimen, violencia, secretos, etc. Un libro muy adictivo, perfecto para quienes sufren un bloqueo lector, y necesitan una lectura ligera para volver a tomar confianza. Además, es un libro independiente, por lo que no se necesita haber leído anteriormente Ángeles y Demonios, ni tampoco El código Da Vinci. Mi calificación es de cinco estrellas porque he quedado muy satisfecho con el contenido, porque la teoría conspirativa me ha encantado, y porque tiene muchas frases interesantes que destacar en la parte final (para quienes leen el libro con mente abierta). Próximo destino, Inferno. ¿Libro recomendado?\n\nApril 21, 2017\n\nDan Brown is one of my favorite authors. I know there are several of my online and in-person (sounds so weird!) friends who disagree, but ultimately... you have to acknowledge the amount of time and dedication he puts into his story, the vast eccentric cast of characters, the intrigue and suspense, the unexpected connections and the fast-paced thrill of turning the pages more quickly than you can actually read each one. People love books for different reasons. It's not always the \"beautiful and lyrical prose\" or the \"emotional gut punch you feel from its reality.\"\n\nThese books are meant to keep your heart racing, your mind guessing and your eyes unable to blink for a few minutes at a time. At the time I'm writing this review, it's been about five years since I read the book, and I still haven't seen the movie... but I am excited to watch it, though I haven't heard great things from those who have.\n\nOf the four Robert Langdon books in the series, this was my least favorite. Angels & Demons and The Da Vinci Code had such complex and shocking story lines, I couldn't help but be amazed. Inferno was so intense and ripe with \"what if\" scenarios, my mind was non-stop going. With this book, it's still a huge and complex puzzle, but it felt a little weaker than the other ones. There was a different type of emotional connection given Langdon's friendship with the kidnapped mentor.\n\nI liked the puzzle, but were pictures necessary?\n\nIt was a little too easy to solve this time.\n\nIt felt a bit repetitive at times.\n\nBut you still flip the pages faster than a normal read.\n\nI'd push you to read his other books. I'd be OK if you skipped this one.\n\nBut I am still super excited about Origin, the fifth in the series, which will debut later this year.\n\nAbout Me\n\nFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT. And now I blog A LOT. First the book review goes on Goodreads, and then I send it on over to my WordPress blog at https://thisismytruthnow.com, where you'll also find TV & Film reviews, the revealing and introspective 365 Daily Challenge and lots of blogging about places I've visited all over the world.

Thanks for stopping by.\n\n[polldaddy poll=9729544]\n\n[polldaddy poll=9719251]\n\nSeptember 18, 2009\n\nNow boarding on track 33, the Symbolism Express departing for the Freemasons, the Invisible College, the Office of Security, the SMSC, the Institute of Noetic Sciences and multiple points around the cryptic compass.\n\nYour temporal destination, not Paris and London, but Washington, D.C.\n\nYour conductor, Harvard symbiologist Robert Langdon, the Indiana Jones of the new age.\n\nTied to the tracks in the gathering darkness ahead and facing certain death, if not embarrassment, another keeper of the ancient mysteries including the wisdom of Solomon, not a man of the Louvre, but a man of the Smithsonian.\n\nTraveling alone, an attractive female relative of the man lashed to the tracks, not agent and cryptologist Sophie Neveu, but Noetic scientist Dr Katherine Solomon.\n\nSitting in the engineer's seat with a small stone pyramid rather than a chalice holding down the deadman's pedal, a rogue and tattooed Mason in search of apotheosis replaces Silas, \"The Da Vinci Code's\" rogue and scourged monk as our antagonist for the evening.\n\nHold on. It's going to be another bumpy ride.\n\nDreams of déjà vu remind you what the journey will be like: short chapters, multiple points of view, conflicting agendas with something very large (yet unknown) at stake, the thrill of the chase, the almost-sexual tension of near-satisfaction again and again as answers appear and disappear, multiple station stops for arcane wisdom instruction, and a desperate-save-humanity-hunt for secrets you've stared at your entire life without comprehending.\n\nBy the end of the novel, you won't be a 33rd Degree Mason and you won't be like unto a god in any way you can quite wrap your mind around, but you will have experienced a high-adrenaline ride. This thrill is what the journey is all about. Perhaps reality lurks around the edge of the plot and theme and perhaps sacred messages lurk within the vast white spaces between the lines of black type, but that's not why we're turning the pages from 1 to 509.\n\nDan Brown has done it again, and upon reflection at the dawn's first light, you'll see that he knows how to pull the right strings and push the right buttons and sprinkle the right esoteric seasonings across his smorgasbord of mysteries from around the world to keep readers addicted for the trip. On the last page, you may well hope, along with Robert Langdon and Katherine Solomon that men and women will follow the ancient maps toward their true potential; but seriously, the novel's destination really doesn't matter, does it, because the ride was the peak experience you were seeking when you picked up \"The Lost Symbol.\"\n\nAll aboard.\n\nFebruary 18, 2010\n\nwell, that's several hours of my life i'll never get back.\n\nyou know, it's not so much that the writing is bad -- i expect it to be bad. it's laughably bad. (to enjoy some truly great bad, relish the self-consciously lascivious descriptions of the bad guy's naked body, they are made of awesome.) it's not so much that the plot is shaky -- i expect it to be shaky, and if this plot could be drawn, it would have to be drawn by dr. seuss. it's that i would expect, at least, that the book actually END SOMEWHERE.\n\nas i recall of the da vinci code, the details of which don't stick in my mind, there WAS a conclusion of sorts, the Big Secret did actually turn out to be something -- that whole Jesus Got Laid revelation that everyone got their panties in a wad about. in this one, i was so confused by the end that i lost track of what The Big Secret was supposed to be, and i don't think one was ever actually given. it started as a Place that contained a Thing ... then it was a Place that contained a Word ... then there was no Place but there was a Word ... then there WAS a Place and a Word which was perhaps a Thing after all ... after that, i fuzz out, i have no idea what the conclusion was.\n\ndan brown just sort of rambles about some ideas he must have found interesting after watching a lot of The Learning Channel and reading some Joseph Campbell. a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, dan. a very little.\n\nbut you know what? that's ok. it's a supermarket book. it's an airplane read, and sometimes i like an airplane read, just like sometimes i eat a donut for dinner. but if you're going to drag me through a book that starts and stops and lurches and jerks like a teenager in driver's ed, for god's sake dan, GIVE IT AN ENDING.\n\nanything can be forgiven with a decent ending. you obviously didn't have anything in mind when you started and i'm sorry, kiddo, but your talents are not great enough to take you to unexpected places. leave that to the big boys. you go steal another interesting conclusion about a historical/religious/mythological item and work backwards. you are not good enough to ruminate randomly and have it come together as something meaningful.\n\nwatch that petard, brother, after it hoists you high, it'll drop you hard.\n\nNovember 3, 2009\n\nI think I finally figured out why I hate Dan Brown. He writes very average thriller/ mystery books, just like many others do, and the thing is that I don't have a problem with the other writers. Sometimes their books are entertaining, sometimes they are not, sometimes they are poorly written, sometimes they are not so bad, and I'm perfectly fine with it. The thing I can't stand about Dan Brown is his attitude. He truly believes he has been invested with the power of 'omniscience', and he looks down at the reader as if he were talking to a bunch of retarded individuals (which we actually probably are just by virtue of the fact that we are reading his books). But this is still ok, it doesn't upset me all that much.\n\nWhat I think is unacceptable is the fact that in his 'all encompassing knowledge', all we find is an endless bunch of lies, lies about the most obvious evidence anybody can prove. Angels and Demons, which takes place in Rome, is filled with sentences in Italian, except that Mr. Brown didn't even bother looking up the spelling of the words and, as if that were not enough, he invented words to look cool in the eyes of his readers which, come on, wouldn't be able to pick all the bull I'm trying to sell them in a million years!\n\nIn the Italian version of The Lost Symbol, I noticed that the translators skipped more than one passage because what DB had written not only wasn't accurate, it was blatantly WRONG! So, I don't know if they didn't want to look stupid themselves or did it to try and give Mr. Brown a better image abroad. Just one tiny detail out of many: Classical Greek 101 - Apo is a preposition, with different meanings but still and only a preposition, for sure not a verb. No!!! not in the Lost Key. Dan Brown has to show us he knows the ethimology of the word apotheosis, and so Apo, for him, turns into a verb, and he lectures us as if he were revealing this great truth. I read on a review that his books are an insult to human intelligence. I agree, and not because they are necessarily awful books, but because taking reality and twisting it so that it can fit the story line and, on top of that, selling it as if it were some kind or revelation we can only obtain through Dan Brown's grace, to me is unacceptable.\n\nOctober 20, 2009\n\nUgghhhhhh. I've been trying to figure out where to start with this one for the past couple days and still haven't been able to decide. So I guess I'll start with my point.\n\nThis book F*CKING BLOWS. F*ck you, Dan Brown, you smug bastard, for insulting my intelligence like nobody's business. I really liked Angels and Demons, was entertained by The Da Vinci Code, and this book had half the content (not to mention a sixteenth of the climax) of the latter in almost twice the number of pages.\n\nDo you get paid by the modifier? Or the number of hits of the term \"secret wisdom\"? BUY A GODDAMN THESAURUS. LEARN SOME NEW F*CKING VERBS. Do you ever get sick of writing the following dialogue?\n\n\"But that can't possibly be true!\"\n\n\"Why not Robert?\"\n\n\"My sharp intellect and well-toned physique just won't let me believe it!\"\n\nSeriously, every other f*cking chapter has that conversation, but with way more modifiers and whining, not to mention that it usually takes up a whole f*cking page.\n\nAnd the shit of it is, it's not even f*cking suspenseful. He literally just keeps you waiting. He doesn't even hide it anymore. The f*cker knows you're going to keep reading anyway, so why even bother to be creative with the cliffhangers?\n\nAnd the puzzles are even straightforward! Even though I don't hold a degree in Symbollogy (Yeah f*cking right. I still contend that he made that word up. Watch the f*cking Boondock Saints, Dan Brown.), a handful of them are completely obvious, and I swear he recycled at least one from Angels and Demons.\n\nAnd only one revelation in the whole book is remotely shocking. And I did see it coming. The rest of them are just inane letdowns. When I hear, \"issue of national security,\" I think nukes-- not the pussy shit this guy is threatening.\n\nDeep breath.\n\nMoral of the story, please don't feed the author. And moral number two: if the back cover of a book contains solely \"Critical Raves for Another Book,\" I should know better.\n\nSeptember 19, 2009\n\nI'm a fan of Dan Brown. I've read all his books - not just The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons, but also Deception Point and Digital Fortress. I like his writing style, how his books are layered with codes and mysteries, and how they're so fast-paced they make my heart beat faster because I feel pulled into the stories and into the lives of his characters.\n\nThe Lost Symbol is the third book in the Robert Langdon series, and I was glad to see that Brown brought this dynamic and entertaining character back to the United States from Europe and the UK in his previous books. The book starts with a bang, pulling me in within the first few paragraphs, though I didn't feel quite as captivated by this story as I had with his previous two.\n\nAs with numbers 1 and 2 in the series, there's a format to the story: Robert Langdon, Harvard professor and expert on symbology and religious iconography find himself embroiled in the middle of a high-stakes religious mystery, where a long-debated and highly protected secret is on the verge of being exposed to the masses and ruined for those who have long stood to protect it. There is, of course, the supporting female character, a smart and capable woman who helps fill in the gaps where Langdon's knowledge leaves off. As was true to the past two books, there is physical and emotional danger, as well as a deranged villain who is at once brilliant, physically superior, and acting in what he believes to be the best interest of the world.\n\nDespite the true-to-form shape of this book, though, it stands well on its own as a book. Although I enjoyed the reading of this book from beginning to end, it wasn't until the final chapters that I felt a strong connection with it, and that is because the view of religion that Brown describes here - as in both of his previous books in the series - falls directly in line with my own personal beliefs of religion and the concept of God. Readers who criticized his previous explanations of such topics will likely find much to refute and criticize here as well, but for me it's like a breath of fresh air, to know that I'm not the only one who sees the universe in greater terms than just a church and its congregants.\n\nThis was an entertaining read, as always, and I'm glad to add it to my collections with his other works. I'm sure I'll enjoy reading this particular book more in the future.\n\nMay 7, 2021\n\nThis book is basically The Da Vinci Code with an awfully, appallingly and dismally pathetic ending.\n\nJuly 23, 2018\n\n“Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand.”\n\n― Dan Brown, The Lost Symbol\n\nI know that a lot of readers do not find Dan Brown's writing style appealing, but in my opinion, l think he writes very captivating novels. I won't go into details of the plot line or the action that takes place, but I will say that if you are a fan of action, drama, conspiracy theories, and history then you probably should give this one a shot. Brown uses point of view brilliantly to increase suspense. His books are fairly quick easy reads, but they are full of excitement and surprises. It is hard to have a novel keep you guessing until the end like this one does.\n\nDecember 6, 2019\n\nIt’s bloated and lame. After all the buildup and intricate clues, the final resolution is underwhelming, and that’s what I have the hardest time forgiving.\n\nJune 17, 2024\n\nAdvised and loaned by a neighbor who knows that I like historical enigmas, the Lost Symbol did not captivate me.\n\nMadly racing through Washington and some famous landmarks in search of ancient symbols and mysteries held by Freemasons, this novel puts Robert Langdon at odds with an annoying character.\n\nEager for supernatural power, he tries to appropriate an object of symbolic value and, to do so, uses violence and threats of all kinds.\n\nWhen we approach themes such as mysticism, esotericism, and others, there is a reason for assumptions and theories, which Dan Brown does not deny.\n\nHonestly, I got utterly lost in the information about sects, secret congregations, symbols, and codes.\n\nReligious and philosophical reflection is interesting, supported by this new science of noetics.\n\nA branch of metaphysical philosophy concerning intellect and thought, this science studies, particularly, the links between human intelligence and the divine brain through the research carried out by Katherine Solomon.\n\nI got a few hard-hitting, sobering phrases out of it, but again, they've drowned in a lot of otherwise confusing information.\n\nI was also stunned by the enormity and the improbability of certain developments.\n\nThe stubbornness of Americans to see global conspiracies everywhere makes me smile and gives their works an air of \"too much.\"\n\nThe Da Vinci Code did not leave me with lasting memories; it will not stay in my mind for long. But I will at least have made my neighbor happy ;-)\n\nSeptember 22, 2009\n\nI am so disappointed. I found Brown's other books to be captivating, if a little formulaic. This is just a blatant rewrite of his own material in a different setting. Angels and Demons set a bar for Brown, and he just hasn't been able to match it since. It reads just like The DaVinci Code, with its plot changed to Washington, D.C. It's a completely improbable plot mixed with even more improbable character developments and plot twists.\n\nSo disappointed. If I'd known, I never would have bought the book in the first place, and certainly not in hardcover.\n\nApril 25, 2021\n\nAn excellent read! I think this is probably my fave Dan Brown book so far.\n\nI got so into it I didn't want to go to work. Interesting, gripping and fast moving are the words I would use to describe this book."
