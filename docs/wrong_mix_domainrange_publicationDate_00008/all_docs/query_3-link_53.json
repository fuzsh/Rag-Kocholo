        "text": "Reviewer: FARAH TAMIZUDDIN, Springfield High School junior\n\nWhat about it made you decide to pick it up? I read “Angels and Demons” and “The Da Vinci Code” (by the same author).\n\nHow did you hear about the book? I knew Dan Brown was writing a new novel.\n\nWhat’s it about? The moment I finished “The Lost Symbol,” I jumped out of bed and made my way over to my computer for an hour of intense Googling. I spent the remainder of the morning alternately cross-legged or on my back with my palms face up, attempting to locate my pineal gland.\n\nThe importance of the pineal gland is just one of the many pieces of information Brown packs into his latest thriller. The epitome of a page-turner, this 509-page book reads more like a movie script than a dusty library tome.\n\nThat doesn’t mean it’s bursting with dialogue, though. Brown intermingles everyone’s favorite character, Robert Langdon, with a new woman, Katherine Solomon, and a plot that plays out like a movie marathon that can make four hours seem like two minutes.\n\n“The Lost Symbol” introduces many connections regarding Masons and the nation’s Founding Fathers and Noetic science — defined as “explorations into the nature and potentials of consciousness using multiple ways of knowing,” according to the Institute of Noetic Science — and their significance in our nation’s capital, Washington, D.C.\n\nBrown’s work is not repetitive, but Langdon’s relationships seem slightly more stale or flat. Concepts, events and actions are more fully developed than in past books.\n\n“The Lost Symbol” is fiction, though, and the word “novel” is printed plainly on the front cover, despite the ostensible “Fact” page inside the book and Brown’s method of stating theories and concepts.\n\nThere is enough intrigue surrounding the facts to make it more than a historical conspiracy-theory trivia textbook, though. While reading this book, it is easy to imagine the world could potentially be a more interesting place.\n\nWhat are the characters like? Robert Langdon is a Harvard professor on an extraordinary adventure. The villain is extremely creepy. The plot, more than the characters, makes the book.\n\nWhat story or other book does it remind you of? “The Da Vinci Code”\n\nDid you learn anything new from reading the book? The weekend after I finished the book, I actually met a Mason — a Mason of the 33rd degree, who, in Brown’s novel, was conveyed to be elusive and exceedingly rare. My Mason had a ring with the circumpunct I learned about while reading the book, but he was from southern Illinois and did not have the magical quality Brown’s book indicated he would.\n\nMoreover, he was sponsoring a high school scholastic bowl tournament, not conducting secret rituals or deciphering ancient pyramids as I mistakenly assumed all 33rd-degree Masons would. I couldn’t help but wonder how many other concepts Brown played up in his novel might be comparatively common or mundane.\n\nWhat’s the setting? Washington, D.C.\n\nDid this book remind you of anything that has happened to you? I wish it reminded me of something that happened to me — but my life isn’t full of CIA agents and murderers.\n\nIf you could change something about the story, what would it be? I was a little disappointed that there was no sense that artwork was important to the story as it was in “The Da Vinci Code.”"
