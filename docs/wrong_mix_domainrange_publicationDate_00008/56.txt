Dan Brown is an American novelist who writes thriller and mystery fiction. The common themes in his books consist of cryptography, secret codes and conspiracy theories. His books have created some controversy with people who consider his novels to be anti-Christian, but he insists that they are simply stories to promote spiritual debate.

Brown’s novels The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons have both been adapted to major motion pictures starring Tom Hanks and the next to get that treatment is The Lost Symbol. Below is the order in which Dan Brown’s books were originally released in:
