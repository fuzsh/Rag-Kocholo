It describes the conflicts Â Â Â Â Â  and contradictions of a traditional peasant society in which the rise in Â Â Â Â Â  population was not matched by increases in wealth and food production.    Â Â Â Â Â  \"It presents us with a great study of rural history, an analysis of economic change and a description of a society in movement that has few equals.\" -- Washington Post Book World \"It is without any doubt one of the most important, if not the most important, monograph of the French Annales school of socio-economic historians written in the last decade.\" -- Canadian Historical Review Â",
