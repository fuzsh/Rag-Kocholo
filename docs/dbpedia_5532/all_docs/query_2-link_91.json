I was also surprised to learn this was the home of Toulouse Lautrec and other later artists. As an archaeologist studying cave art, I became caught up in the long and important history of this one small area. The idea for a story intertwining different religious movements and art over thousands of years quickly emerged.

I often found myself wrapped up in the incredible history that surrounded me everywhere I went in the region, leading to my own attempt at expressing some of it.\n\nI’ve learned that Peter Mayle, through his books, is like having…\n\nBy Peter Mayle,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n5 authors picked A Year in Provence as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nA personal description of Provencal life as seen through the eyes of the author and his wife when they move into an old farmhouse at the foot of the Luberon mountains between Avignon and Aix.

I couldn’t resist this unique opportunity to reveal a piece of the past from a perspective I hadn't considered before.\n\nT.C.'s book list on the amazing history of the south of France\n\nWhy did T.C. love this book?\n\nIt is virtually impossible to write or even investigate medieval southern France, especially the famous Cathar Period without delving into this classic work.\n\nStill available in different translations, Le Roy Ladurie takes us into the life of a 14th-century French mountain village and its people in a way no one else has ever attempted. Based upon meticulous church records of contemporary individual interviews and interrogations with alleged heretics in one small village by Church Inquisitors, the author gives us a look into the lives of common people of that time that has never been equaled.\n\nI found myself returning to this small book time and again in creating my own setting and characters (including borrowing authentic names at times) for a near-contemporary portion of the story I wanted to build within the larger framework of time and place I was focused upon.\n\nThe reader gets a true sense of the…\n\nBy Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, Barbara Bray (translator),\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked Montaillou as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n\"Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie has had a success which few historians experience and which is usually reserved for the winner of the Prix Goncourt...Montaillou, which is the reconstruction of the social life of a medieval village, has been acclaimed by the experts as a masterpiece of ethnographic history and by the public as a sensational revelation of the thoughts, feelings, and activities of the ordinary people of the past.\"―Times Literary Supplement.\n\nWith a new introduction by author Le Roy Ladurie, this special edition offers a fascinating history of a fourteenth-century village, Montaillou, in the mountainous region of southern France, almost…\n\nPreview\n\nLabyrinth\n\nBy Kate Mosse,\n\nFrom my list on whisking you from one time period to another.\n\nBy Julie Brooks Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’m the girl who loved school excursions to historical parks and the middle-aged author who cannot keep away from a house museum. Like most Australians, I love to travel (you’ll meet us everywhere), gravitating towards historical sites and weighing down my luggage with museum-shop trophies from Beijing to Bath and Cusco to Athens. All novels are mysteries the reader wants to solve, but stories with multiple timelines add an extra layer of puzzle to the mystery. As a writer I get to craft those puzzle pieces. And as a reader, I love solving them!\n\nJulie's book list on whisking you from one time period to another\n\nWhy did Julie love this book?\n\nMystery, quest, treasure, and historical adventure, this novel has it all.\n\nLabyrinth links a twelfth-century French heroine in a land of legends, castles, and knights with a present-day heroine who finds two ancient skeletons at an archaeological dig and is drawn into a quest for the Holy Grail.\n\nI love mystical, historical quests, and mysterious symbols, especially when the setting is so real you feel you are there. This one kept me reading far into the wee hours and I enjoyed learning more about medieval France.\n\nBy Kate Mosse,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n5 authors picked Labyrinth as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.

Kuhn Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nWhile using the city of Albi in southern France as a base for visiting some cave art locations I became fascinated with the history of the early Christians of the region and the brutal Cathar Crusade which happened there. I was also surprised to learn this was the home of Toulouse Lautrec and other later artists. As an archaeologist studying cave art, I became caught up in the long and important history of this one small area. The idea for a story intertwining different religious movements and art over thousands of years quickly emerged. I couldn’t resist this unique opportunity to reveal a piece of the past from a perspective I hadn't considered before.\n\nT.C.'s book list on the amazing history of the south of France\n\nWhy did T.C. love this book?\n\nIn taking on any project dealing with the origins of art or religion in any time and place I have found Pfeiffer’s book to be an excellent and easily readable starting point.\n\nAs an experienced journalist and writer, his ability to take on difficult subjects in the human origins story in a way the average reader can comprehend and enjoy keeps his work relevant, despite the passing years.\n\nFollowing his own path through some of the art caves of southern France many years later, I found a reread of this book and the still relevant questions it asks and attempts to answer a virtual guidebook to my own understanding of this rapidly changing subject. Profusely illustrated and supported with color photos, this book challenges the reader to begin elevating both the abilities and complexity of our stone age ancestors in ways we may not have considered or even thought possible.…\n\nBy John E.

As a music journalist, I’ve written extensively for many major U.S. and international guitar publications before launching the website, The Guitar. My music has been featured on National Public Radio and worldwide at major U.S. and international art and design museum festivals. Part of being a writer is about expressing one’s curiosity through constant delving and engaging in the ongoing process of discovery. What compels me is the attempt to understand the inspiration that drives an artist to create a distinctively beautiful melody, fragrance, or artwork—one that grabs your attention with a mesmerizing, transfixing, and soulful quality.\n\nJulia's book list on what drives an artist\n\nWhy did Julia love this book?\n\nFrey’s book is a vivid account of the fin-de-siecle French painter who was born into aristocracy but did not fit in, due to hereditary dwarfism. Lautrec devoted himself to studying painting in Paris, where he fell in with the cabaret theatre and dancehall crowd, along with its contingent, shadier side of sundry misfits, whom he embraced wholly. In the milieu that permitted a laundress (La Goulue) to become a can-can star, Lautrec put himself on the map with his spectacular cabaret posters. I chose this book because though I do not draw portraits, I can relate to my enjoyment of capturing artistic photographs of musicians.\n\nBy Julia Frey,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Toulouse-Lautrec as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nDebauched aristocrat, cabaret painter or accidental dwarf: Julia Frey's definitive biography uses meticulous research to strip away the myth of Toulouse-Lautrec and reveal for the first time the tortured man beneath. 'The book deals seriously and sensitively with Lautrec's progress as an artist, his academic training and the audacious use he put it to. Equally, readers in search of the ooh-la-la side of Paris during the Belle Epoque won't feel short-changed. Almost everyone from Manet to the young Picasso crosses the stage. It is of course a tragic story, but a triumphant one also' George Melly, Mail on Sunday\n\nPreview\n\nA Lion in Paris\n\nBy Beatrice Alemagna,\n\nFrom my list on picture books about cities.\n\nBy Tania de Regil Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nWhen I was a young girl, I was lucky to have friends from all over the world, so learning about a new country or a new city always fascinated me, and it still does.

Robb provides some episodic portraits of some of those stages, and the chapter on the eighteenth-century architect Charles-Axel Guillaumot is one of the most arresting discussions I’ve ever seen of how the actions of those living in one epoch can reverberate for generations to come. Guillaumot literally saved Paris from collapsing in on its medieval past by bracing up the swiss-cheese-like network of tunnels that had been left behind by its medieval quarry workers.\n\nBy Graham Robb,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Parisians as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThis is the Paris you never knew.
