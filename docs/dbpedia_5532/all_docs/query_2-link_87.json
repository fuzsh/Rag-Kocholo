        "text": "This is the concluding part of our story of the codex known as the Tonalamatl de Aubin, and of its little known, secret journey from Mexico to France - and back again... (Written by Ian Mursell/Mexicolore)\n\nPic 1: Antonio Peñafiel and the title page of his book ‘Monumentos del Arte Mexicano Antiguo’ (Click on image to enlarge)\n\nPeñafiel - a distinguished Mexican scientist and scholar - was on a mission to recover Aubin’s collection for Mexico, and after Boban and Goupil left the house, Peñafiel returned to offer to purchase Aubin’s whole collection with funds from the Mexican government - ‘within days’. Aubin was by now old and impoverished (having lost a small fortune in the Panama canal fiasco). ‘According to Boban’s version of the events, Peñafiel had told Aubin to keep silent about the deal, especially with regard to Boban. But the aging and fearful Aubin could not hold his tongue about the possible sale. He told Boban that he was in dire straits and had decided to sell his collection for cash. Boban asked him to give him two days and to make no decision before he could see him again. Aubin agreed and Boban went straight to E. Eugène Goupil.’ (ibid: 254).\n\nPic 2: The Exposition Universelle, Paris, 1889 (Click on image to enlarge)\n\nWhen Goupil bought the Aubin manuscripts – all 384 of them, including the Tonalamatl - for 20,000 francs on 11 April 1889 he and Boban had succeeded in ‘triumphantly snatching the collection from under Peñafiel’s nose, blocking the return of the precious manuscripts to their country of origin’. With this success, Goupil and Boban were able to exhibit at the Exposition not only the artefacts collection but also specially mounted, large-format photographs of Aubin’s painted manuscripts, in a separate building to the Mexican pavilion, the ‘section de l’Exposition retrospective du Travail’ (Boban 1893: 20) (pic 3).\n\nPic 3: Plan of he section ‘du Travail’, Exposition Universelle, Paris (Click on image to enlarge)\n\nThe display was promoted as ‘Mexique… Collection de photographies representant des antiquités diverses et plusieurs manuscrits de la collection Aubin’ (Exposant, M. Goupil) under Ethnography, directed by Dr. E. Hamy.\n\nInterestingly, Boban also mentions an exhibition section on the ‘Fabrication du Papier d’agave par les Aztèques’ as well as a section on the history of writing.\n\nPic 4: ‘Documents pour servir à l’histoire du Mexique...’ with its Atlas of images (Click on image to enlarge)\n\nGoupil then planned to employ Boban to catalogue and survey the entire collection in a publication, which ended up being ‘a two-volume, six-hundred-page tour de force’ (Walsh 2019: 255), the Documents pour servir à l’histoire du Mexique – Catalogue Raisonné de la Collection de M.E. Eugène Goupil, with its Atlas of 80 photographic reproductions of the manuscripts (for an example, see pic 6). ‘Published in 1891, it has since become a primary reference resource on the subject of Mexican pre-Columbian codices and manuscripts’ (ibid: 255).\n\nPic 5: One of the photoreprodutions from the Tonalamatl de Aubin in the Boban ‘Atlas’, with Boban’s original catalogue number of the codex ‘18-19’ in the Bibliothèque Nationale de France (Click on image to enlarge)\n\nThe 1891 catalogue included photoreproductions of two pages (3 and 20) from the Tonalamatl - numbered 18-19 in the catalogue). Following Boban’s original listing, ‘18-19’ is the entry number for the codex in the National Library of France (BNF)’s records (the original Codex Xolotl is listed as no. 1-10, and León y Gama’s copy of the Tonalamatl is no. 19bis).\n\nPic 6: The Tonalamatl de Aubin was Number 1 in Goupil’s collection of Mexican manuscripts; shown here are pages 16-15 as reproduced in the ‘Atlas’ (Click on image to enlarge)\n\nThe leading American ethnologist Daniel Garrison Brinton met Boban, Aubin and Goupil, and was hugely impressed by Boban’s ‘Documents…’ with its atlas. He describes the Tonalamatl as ‘the famous Tonalamatl, or “Book of Days”… an original hieroglyphic book of eighteen leaves, magnificently coloured in red, black, green and brown… None of the documents in the collection presents to the eye a more striking appearance than this venerable pictograph…’ (Brinton 1893).\n\nThree years after the death of Eugène Goupil, in 1895, his widow, Augustine Élie, donated his collection – including 24 original manuscripts from Boturini’s trove (Galarza & Bejarano, n.d.: 187) - to the BNF in August 1898.\n\nAnd there it was to remain for the best part of a century until…\n\nPic 7: José Luis Castañeda speaking on Mexican TV in 1982 (Click on image to enlarge)\n\nHistory 20th & 21st centuries (1982-present)\n\n… late one afternoon, on Friday 18th June 1982, 36-yr-old Mexican lawyer, José Luis Castañeda del Valle (pic 7), one of 19 lawyers who founded the Barra de Abogados de Quintana Roo, strolled into the BNF, stole the original Tonalamatl and returned to Mexico with it!\n\nPic 8: Richelieu Library - Manuscripts Reading Room, Blbiothèque Nationale de France, Paris (Click on image to enlarge)\n\nOf course, there’s more to it than that. Castañeda had, it seems, originally planned to take, the previous day, the (Maya) Paris Codex and had made several preliminary visits to the Library to gain the confidence of the staff there. Initially he been refused permission by the head of the historical manuscripts section to see – and photograph – any of the original codices in the BNF, but as he claimed professional status (including as a journalist) and provided photo ID and proof of his home address in Cancún, Mexico, permission was subsequently granted. On an impulse – he recounted later to Mexican news outlet Noticiero 24 horas - ‘decidí yo al siguiente día, traerme el Tonalamatl o Libro de la Buenaventura, de origen Tolteca o Azteca’.\n\nPic 9: Two sections of the Carmen Aguilera facsimile edition of the Tonalamatl de Aubin (Click on image to enlarge)\n\nIt wasn’t until the following week that the loss was discovered, and local police and Interpol were called in, to search for Castañeda. He had been aided by the fact that the codex was stored – as many such precious manuscripts are around the world – in its own bespoke box, which he calmly handed in (empty) along with other materials at the end of his visit, having concealed the original under his jacket (or was it a sarape, as some claimed at the time?!). Franch (1992: 85) suggests that he cunningly swapped the original for a fine facsimile – the edition by Carmen Aguilera, which conveniently had just been published the previous year. We’ll probably never know – for the record, the BNF lists the Aguilera facsimile edition in its manuscript holdings! Incidentally, we’ve been told that the Tonalamatl’s bespoke box ‘is no more’ in the BNF: perhaps, in the light of events, this is understandable…\n\nPic 10: The Bibliothèque Richelieu today... (Click on image to enlarge)\n\nCastañeda was arrested at his home in Cancún on 16th August 1982, where he was said to be running a small newspaper, and detained for two days. He surrendered the Tonalamatl to the Procuraduría Federal de Justicia and claimed that he had intended all along to hand the codex to the Mexican authorities. He told one reporter ‘It was stolen from Mexico, and now we have recovered stolen property’. However the simple fact that he kept the valuable codex at home for two months and only handed it in when arrested made many suspect that he planned to sell it on the lucrative antiquities market. Inevitably, a diplomatic row broke out between Mexico and France – the former portraying Castañeda as a hero, the latter labelling him a common criminal.\n\nPic 11: Excerpt from UNESCO’s statement on Culture, World Conference on Cultural Policies, 1982 (Click on image to enlarge)\n\nWhilst a legal accord existed between Mexico and the USA to control trafficked cultural artefacts, no such agreement existed between Mexico and France. Following UNESCO’s sixth World Conference on Cultural Policies – ironically held in Mexico City that summer and at which an important focus was a call for the ‘restitution of cultural property’ between member states, a spokesman for the French Embassy in New York stated that ‘Here we’re dealing with a common crime. Our reaction is the same as Britain with the Falklands: there was a theft and we cannot accept a theft’ (Riding 1982).\n\nPic 12: ... and the Bibliothèque Richelieu towards the end of the 19th century (Click on image to enlarge)\n\nThe eminent French historian Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, director of the BNF in the mid-‘80s, refused to allow any Mexican to cross the threshold of the Library again, and demanded the return of the manuscript on a legal basis: it had been in the BNF since 1898, donated by the Eugène Goupil’s widow in accordance with her husband’s will.\n\nPic 13: The original Tonalamatl de Aubin is prepared for exhibition in Mexico City in 2014 (Click on image to enlarge)\n\nIt wasn’t until almost a decade later, in 1991, that the two countries were able to reach a ‘technical’ understanding, allowing cultural exchanges, scholarships and mutual cooperation to recommence – and the symbolic ‘handing over’ of the original Tonalamatl to Roberto García Moll, director of Mexico’s National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) by Pierre Charasse, a high-ranking French diplomat.\n\nEssentially, the codex today ‘belongs’ to France, but is on permanent loan to Mexico. A further rapprochement occurred when the original was put on public display in Mexico City’s National Museum of Anthropology (to mark its 50th anniversary) in September 2014 – Mexico prudently sought France’s approval at the time.\n\nPic 14: Poster announcing the 50th anniversary of the founding of Mexico’s Museo Nacional de Antropología e Historia (Click on image to enlarge)\n\nBilateral links improved again in 2018 when INAH published a 5m 30cm long facsimile edition of the Tonalamatl, hand made in San Pablito Pahuatlan (a Nahua community with a long tradition of native paper-making). According to Baltazar Brito, a ‘cultural agreement’ was signed at the time between the two respective Ministries of Culture.\n\nPic 15: Presentation of the INAH facsimile edition of the Tonalamatl de Aubin, 2018 (Click on image to enlarge)\n\nChoosing his words carefully at the presentation of INAH’s facsimile edition (pic 15), Brito noted that the original codex had come to Mexico as a result of ‘avatares del destino’ – what we might euphemistically call in English ‘twists of fate’…\n\nSpecial thanks in the preparation of this article are due to Jane Walsh, anthropologist emerita at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of Natural History.
