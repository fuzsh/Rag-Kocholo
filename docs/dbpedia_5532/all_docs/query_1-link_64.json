        "text": "Montaillou by Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie – Cathars and Catholics in a French Village 1294-1324 – translated by Barbara Bray – is another book I read for my studies. First published in 1975 in French and translated into English a few years later, this was very popular with the public. It sold hundreds of thousands of copies. The book is about the everyday life in a medieval French village. It had about 200 inhabitants and it is structured thematically, covering everything, from where the livestock lived to the sexual life of the people in Montaillou .\n\nThe sources Le Roy Ladurie uses are records gathered by the Catholic Church in its pursuit of heretics. He read everything on this particular village and his account recreated the daily life beautifully. Reading this book it became clear why it was so popular. It’s far from dull and the Le Roy Ladurie storytelling is just wonderful. I am glad I read it and I would highly recommend it. Despite being a subject one might not think of as particularly interesting, the book in fact it is fascinating.\n\nMontaillou by Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie\n\nDetails about the picture: –\n\nMy rating: 5/5 Stars\n\nWould I recommend it: yes!\n\nPublished by: Penguin Books\n\nYear it was published: 1990 (first published in 1975)\n\nFormat: Paperback\n\nGenre(s): History – France\n\nPages: 400"
