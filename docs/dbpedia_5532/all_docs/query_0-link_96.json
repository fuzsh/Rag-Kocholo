        "text": "With the British Library soon to open an exhibition about Henry VIII, I would just like to proclaim my fandom of its curator, Dr David Starkey. A while ago I got some sniffy responses when I included Starkey in a list of outstanding historians. Starkey? Just a populist glorifier of monarchy, someone objected. I don't agree.\n\nStarkey is not just an admirable television presenter, a terrific writer and – yes – a fascinating commentator on Britain's peculiar institution, the monarchy, but the kind of historian who makes this craft truly compelling and worthwhile. In fact, beneath his very British veneer, he is, I believe, a great exemplar of a continental type of history.\n\nHis current book and exhibition on Henry draw on research he has been doing since he was a graduate student on Tudor court life. As he quotes his younger self saying in the preface to Henry: Virtuous Prince, \"Did you know that the groom was actually ... in charge of Henry's close stool? What? Oh yes, the royal loo.\" In other words, his studies of offices like the Groom of the Stool revealed how high politics and bodily intimacy intertwined in the rituals of a palace like Hampton Court.\n\nStarkey would never say it, and may not even believe it, but this kind of detailed picture of the everyday existence of the Tudors is history in an anthropological vein and its most serious champions are the French Annales school. There's not that great a difference between discovering about Henry's groom of the stool and the Annales historian Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie telling how peasants in a medieval village called Montaillou structured social encounters around delousing one another.\n\nIn short, the reason I love Starkey's books is the same reason I love Montaillou. It's great to read history that feels like time travel, that brings another world to life so you can, er, smell it. Of course, Starkey starts with an advantage. Historians of peasant life have to search for trial records to give rare glimpses of real people behind the statistics. Starkey writes about the elite of the elite, the monarchy, which is, of course, more richly documented than any other social sphere. But that also means he can link the rituals and routines he describes so well with the affairs of high politics. In Henry: Virtuous Prince he shows how jousting and King Arthur helped cement diplomacy. Ultimately, Henry's intimate life was a political and even a religious fact: his failed marriages led to the Reformation. There's nothing trivial about examining the royal stools."
