        "text": "Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, a French historian at the forefront of a scholarly movement that sought to understand the past from the bottom up, by probing the beliefs and psychology of anonymous peasants and priests rather than the exploits of triumphant generals and rulers, died on Wednesday. He was 94.\n\nHis family confirmed the death, according to Agence France-Presse and other French news organizations. The magazine L’Obs said he died in Paris.\n\nIn a statement from the Élysée Palace, President Emmanuel Macron of France called Mr. Le Roy Ladurie “one of our greatest historians,” adding, “His work truly extended history’s domain — the discipline was enriched because he was able to invent new tools, new approaches, and new subjects.”\n\nA prolific and eminently readable scholar, Mr. Le Roy Ladurie was most familiar for his books “Montaillou: The Promised Land of Error” (1975) and “Carnival in Romans” (1979), both of them best sellers and instant classics on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nHe was a leading member of the Annales movement, which rejected traditional historiography, with its emphasis on great events (the War for Independence, the Bolshevik Revolution), ideologies (capitalism vs. Marxism) and protagonists (Washington and Jefferson, Napoleon and Wellington, Lenin and Trotsky).\n\nBefore the influence of Mr. Le Roy Ladurie and other, mainly French, scholars, students were confidently assumed to have mastered the outlines of history if they could recite the dates, describe the cataclysms and memorize the names of the greats. But according to Mr. Le Roy Ladurie, they would have only scratched the surface of the human experience through the ages.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
