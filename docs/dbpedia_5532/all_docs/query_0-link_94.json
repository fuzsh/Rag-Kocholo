        "text": "Carnival, 1580, in Romans, France, was a time of \"\"masks and massacres,\"\" two weeks whose events revealed both shared culture and deeply-sown conflict. Professor Le Roy Ladurie delves into rich archival sources to reconstruct the social structure of this small town of 8,000 located near Grenoble. The resulting analysis is thorough and many-faceted, yet lacks the sparkle of the earlier Montaillou. This may be because, as the author points out, \"\"Romans was richer in situations than in characters to study, richer in sociology than psychology.\"\" Certain characters do take center stage: Catherine de Medici, \"\"staunch supporter of noble privilege\"\"; Jean Serve-Paumier, leader of the rampaging craftsmen; and Antoine Guerin, royal judge and \"\"the real town boss.\"\" But, here, it is the folk tradition, religion, rural-urban tensions, and class conflict that combine to form a \"\"complete geology\"\" for this carnival period, and Le Roy Ladurie reaches back to earlier centuries and throughout the province to examine its shifting layers. By carnival time the stage was set for violence: Huguenots had been defeated but rigid Catholics remained suspicious; the Wars of Religion had placed a heavy burden on all but the tax-exempt nobles. They in turn were buying the peasants' land and bringing on their revolt. Liberal judges argued for equality, itchy bourgeois yearned for ennoblement, urban craftsmen sought political representation and an economic break. The folkloric staging of carnival allowed all these conflicting groups to use shared symbols for their own political goals--in the end the upper-class partridge and eagle groups murder the bear (Serve-Paumier) and disperse his pack. The plethora of social organizations involved (warring peasants, guilds, Catholics, Calvinists, and state representatives) make it hard at times to keep the players straight--Le Roy Ladurie could provide more direction. Yet the work adds to the growing trend (Philip Abrams and E. A. Wrigley, Towns in Societies) toward viewing cities as fields for the playing out of broader social forces. In the Annales tradition of French historiography: careful, dense, reflective--well worth the time."
