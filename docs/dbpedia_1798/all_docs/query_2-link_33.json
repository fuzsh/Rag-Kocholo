        "text": "Indonesia missed another Olympic men's soccer spot\n\nQATAR-Indonesia lost 1-2 to Iraq and let the 2024 Olympic spot fall to this opponent, but Shin Tae-yong and his team still have a chance to compete for the final ticket.\n\n*Goals: Jenner 19′ – Tahseen 27′, Jasim 96′\n\nAfter the final whistle of the 23 U2024 Asia third-place match, Iraqi reserve players rushed onto the field, jumping up and down and spreading in many directions. Meanwhile, the Indonesian player stood silently, or collapsed on the field. That moment marked the sixth time Iraq won a spot in Olympic men's soccer, while Indonesia continued to miss out on a ticket to Paris, three days after they lost their first spot to Uzbekistan.\n\nNo Southeast Asian team has won a spot at the Olympics since the Olympics limited the U23 age group in 1992. Indonesia still has the last chance, if it wins against African representative Guinea in the qualifying match on May 9. at the French national football center Clairefontaine. This place is about 5 km southwest of Paris, and Indonesia is also close to the Olympic spot.\n\nCompared to the loss to Uzbekistan, where the opponent had seven times more shots, Indonesia created far more opportunities against Iraq. Shin Tae-yong's team shot 17 times in this match, but only twice did the ball reach the goal. One of those situations brought the opening goal for the Southeast Asian representative, when midfielder Ivar Jenner shot from a distance of more than 20 meters, sinking the ball to the near corner in the 19th minute.\n\nThe Indonesian audience was already rowdy from the beginning of the match, exploding when the ball entered the net. There were more than 8.000 spectators coming to the stadium to watch this match, most of them supporting the Southeast Asian representative. So after scoring, Jenner also ran towards the audience, stepping on the fence and was hugged tightly by many fans. He is one of four naturalized players starting for Indonesia in this match, and is also a mainstay on the national team.\n\nHowever, the joy of the Indonesian audience did not last long, as Iraq equalized just seven minutes later. From Iraq's corner to the right of captain Muntadher Mohammed, goalkeeper Ernando Ari punched the ball poorly, allowing striker Nihad Mohammed to head close to the goal line for midfielder Zaid Tahseen to tap into the empty net.\n\nThe video referee (VAR) took three minutes to check whether the goal was valid, mainly because Tahseen was possibly offside. The VAR team also includes Mr. Sivakorn Pu-udom - who was criticized by the Indonesian media when Shin Tae-yong and his team lost to Uzbekistan in the semi-finals.\n\nIndonesia did not flinch after the opponent's equalizer and continued to play controlled football. Shin's army kept the ball 52% of the time in this match, when Iraq played mainly based on quick counter-attacks. The number of dangerous opportunities created by the two teams is not much different, but the problem lies in taking advantage of the opportunity. In addition, Indonesia's physical strength is also weaker, shown by the fact that they were forced to play in the second half of the second half and the first half of extra time.\n\nIraq's pressing efforts were rewarded with Ali Jasim's decisive goal in extra time. In the 96th minute, Muntadher passed a long ball across the line to Ali Jasim, broke the offside trap, rushed down to the right side of the penalty area and faced the goalkeeper. The Iraqi national player shot low through Ernando's legs, putting the ball into the net, sealing a 2-1 victory for the home team. The 20-year-old midfielder also rose to the top of the top scorer race with four goals in the tournament.\n\nEven though they needed an equalizer in the remaining minutes, the Indonesian player was exhausted and could not create a dangerous opportunity. The Southeast Asian fans in the stands no longer had the same energy as before, most of them sat still and did not cheer for the home team with sound. But they still have one more chance to fire up Shin's teachers and students, on their journey to making history for regional football.\n\nVnexpress.net\n\nSource: https://vnexpress.net/indonesia-vs-iraq-4741328-tong-thuat.html\n\nSame author\n\nDeputy Minister Do Hung Viet evaluated the UPR report dialogue session of the Vietnamese delegation\n\nDeputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Do Hung Viet said that Vietnam had a very successful UPR dialogue session with the participation of a large number of United Nations member countries.
