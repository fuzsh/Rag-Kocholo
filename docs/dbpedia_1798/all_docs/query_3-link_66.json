These acts angered the fans of Indonesia who went on to critisice the referee on social media, even calling him making favours for the other side.\n\nWho is Shen Yinhao?\n\nShen Yinhao is a Chinese football referee who was born in 1986 in Shanghai, China. The 38 year old has been working as a full international referee for FIFA since 2018.\n\nThe referee has been involved in several controversial acts. Back in 2020, the Chinese Super League official was charged with academic plagiarism. He was compelled to defend himself after Shandong Luneng’s game against Beijing Guoan on October 17 was marred by fan backlash over what they saw as bad calls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShen Yinhao’s penalty to Beijing Guoan tied the game at two goals, despite the Shandong players’ protests claiming there had not been a foul. Despite the Shandong defenders’ claims of a foul in the build-up, he let the equalising goal to go through.\n\nAccording to PP Sports, a CSL broadcaster, supporters decided to take matters into their own hands and looked up his master’s degree course thesis.\n\nIn the “thesis incident,” Shen was observed leaving the Suzhou bubble, where the CSL championship match was taking place, and returning to Tongji University in Shanghai on October 19 to face down on plagiarism accusations.\n\nAdvertisement"
