The cause was heart failure, according to a spokesperson. Diddley performed live until May 2007, when he suffered a stroke; three months later, in August, he also suffered a heart attack. The spokesperson said that he was surrounded by family and friends when he died. Public and private services are scheduled for this weekend.\n\nIn the summer of 2005, Rolling Stone writer Neil Strauss caught up with Diddley for the magazine’s last major feature on him, the award-winning “Indestructible Beat of Bo Diddley.”\n\n• The Indestructible Beat of Bo Diddley by Neil Strauss (RS 981, August 25, 2005)\n\n• The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time: Bo Diddley by Iggy Pop (RS 946, April 15, 2004)\n\nTrending\n\n• Bo Diddley: The Rolling Stone Interview by Kurt Loder (RS 493, February 12, 1987)\n\n• Photo Gallery: Shots From Bo Diddley’s Five Decade Career"
