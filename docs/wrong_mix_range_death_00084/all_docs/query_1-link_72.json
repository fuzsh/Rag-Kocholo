        "text": "Rock pioneer Bo Diddley, whose famous beat became a building block of rock 'n' roll and ensured his status as one of its architects, died early Monday at his home near Archer.\n\nThe 79-year-old guitarist/singer/songwriter died from heart failure, said his spokeswoman Susan Clary. The performer had suffered a stroke while on tour in Iowa in May 2007, and suffered a heart attack three months later.\n\nFuneral services will be held at 2 p.m. Saturday at Showers of Blessings Harvest Center, 2615 SE 15th St. A community memorial celebration will take place from 6-9 p.m. Saturday at the Martin Luther King Jr. Multi-Purpose Center, 1024 NE 14th St. Both are open to the public.\n\nDiddley, who was born in McComb, Miss., and grew up in Chicago, had been recovering at his home near Archer, where he had lived for 30 years. Friends, family members and musicians, both from Archer and across the country, bemoaned the loss of a man who rose from simple beginnings to become a giant of the music he helped build.\n\nHe was an \"artiste, the man who constructed the sound we all grew to revolve around,\" said ZZ Top guitarist Billy Gibbons, who along with his bandmates co-inducted Diddley into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nDiddley's sound and trademark beat \"was a vision of simplicity delivered through effortless expression and sense of humor,\" Gibbons said in an e-mail to The Sun. \"Many times, Bo made a point to say, â€òI'll always be around,' and we know he will.\"\n\nFamily members gathered at Diddley's home near Archer on Monday as plans were made to honor the performer.\n\n\"As a person he was a man with a heart for people,\" said Garry Mitchell, one of Diddley's 15 grandchildren. \"He was a giver and always willing to help. And he was everything you wanted in a grandpa, because he was there for the long haul, for the enjoyment and the laughter and for showing (his grandchildren and great-grandchildren) the way.\"\n\n\"He gave the world so much,\" said Scott Free, a guitarist and longtime family friend who performed with Diddley in the 1980s after he began dating the singer's daughter, Tammi McDaniel. \"He was really, really sweet; a really generous person almost to a fault.\"\n\nSUBHEAD IN COPYf=Garamond Bk I s=14 l=15The beat\n\nl%50\n\nWith Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Elvis Presley, Fats Domino and Jerry Lee Lewis, Diddley became one of the architects of rock 'n' roll in the mid-1950s. The guitarist/singer/songwriter scored major pop hits with \"Bo Diddley\" and \"I'm a Man\" in 1955 on Chicago's Chess Records, and drew attention to rock 'n' roll's backbeat on a label primarily known for the blues.\n\nFrom there, his \"dunt da dunt da dunt, da dunt dunt\" beat became an integral - and instantly identifiable - part of rock 'n' roll's grammar. And his sound influenced artists in styles as diverse as rockabilly, punk, hip-hop, British invasion pop and others.\n\n\"It's not the number of notes you play, it's the notes you select,\" Free said.\n\nOver the years, Diddley variously claimed to have adapted the beat from music he heard in church, from trying to play the Gene Autry song \"Jingle Jangle\" and from trying to play his guitar like a drum.\n\nThe \"Bo Diddley beat\" could be heard in countless rock and pop hits, from Buddy Holly's \"Not Fade Away\" and The Who's \"Magic Bus,\" to Elvis Presley's \"His Latest Flame,\" Tom Petty's \"American Girl,\" George Michael's \"Faith\" and Bruce Springsteen's \"She's the One.\"\n\nWhen Petty and the Heartbreakers recorded \"American Girl,\" Petty told his bandmates to go for a \"Bo Diddley\" sound, recalled Stan Lynch, the Heartbreakers' drummer at the time.\n\n\"That was the mandate, â€òI want to hear Bo Diddley,' \" Lynch said Monday.\n\n\"Everybody knew the Bo Diddley beat; everybody knew just what that meant, but nobody knew how good it was until you actually went back and studied the record, or you heard it on â€òEd Sullivan,' \" Lynch said. \"You went â€òwow, it's a lot more subtle than I think.' It almost has a Latin feel in it; there's a lot of depth to that beat.\"\n\nPetty, a Gainesville native, also a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, recounts the story in the book, \"Conversations with Tom Petty.\" The song was \"supposed to be like Bo Diddley,\" Petty said. \"That was Stan's version of the Bo Diddley rhythm .\"\n\nDiddley's song, \"Who Do You Love,\" was memorably covered by guitarist George Thorogood in 1978 and his music was featured on the soundtracks of such films as \"Boys Don't Cry,\" \"The Color of Money,\" \"Dirty Dancing\" and \"La Bamba,\" and in a series of Nike ads in 1989, in which Diddley appeared with football/baseball star Bo Jackson.\n\nHis musical path\n\nBorn Ellas Otha Bates in Dec. 30, 1928, in McComb, Miss., Diddley was raised by his mother's cousin, Gussie McDaniel, and moved with her to Chicago at age 7. He later took her surname, becoming Ellas McDaniel. At age 12, he took up the violin and also learned to play guitar.\n\nThough accounts of how he auired his stage name vary, he had begun to use it by 1954, when he recorded \"I'm a Man\" and his namesake song - \"Bo Diddley\" - at Chess Records' studios on the Southside of Chicago. Though he hailed from the Mississippi Delta like Muddy Waters, the blues wasn't Diddley's forte.\n\n\"I couldn't play blues,\" he told The Sun in 1986. \"Blues wasn't for me. So I came up with my own sound.\"\n\nIssued as a single, \"Bo Diddley\" became many people's sound when it hit No. 1 on Billboard's R&B Singles chart in 1955. Its flip side, \"I'm a Man\" - which Muddy Waters famously reworked for his own hit, \"Mannish Boy,\" was on the charts for 11 weeks.\n\nAlso in 1955, Diddley made an appearance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" that caused a sensation, predating and foreshadowing those of a swivel-hipped young singer from Memphis (Elvis Presley) in 1956, and a mop-topped foursome from England (The Beatles) in 1964.\n\nSullivan had wanted Diddley to sing a version of \"Sixteen Tons,\" a big hit for Tennessee Ernie Ford at the time. But Diddley was determined to perform his own, namesake hit - even after telling Sullivan's staff he didn't know the words to \"Sixteen Tons\" and they were written on cue cards for him.\n\n\"Man, maybe that was â€òSixteen Tons' on those cards, but all I saw was â€òBo Diddley,' \" Diddley later told The New York Times.\n\nThough he continued to record and perform in the 1960s, Diddley spent several years in the 1970s working as a deputy sheriff in Los Lunas, N.M., said Mitchell, his grandson who follows in his grandfather's footsteps both by recording a song with him (\"Kids Don't Do It\" on Diddley's \"A Man Amongst Men\" in 1996) and as a lawman by working as a deputy for the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\n\"He was actually a gunslinger for real; he had a six-shooter,\" Mitchell said."
