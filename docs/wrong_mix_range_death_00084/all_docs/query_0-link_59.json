        "text": "The Keystone Berkeley, at 2119 University Avenue (at Shattuck), some time in the early 80s\n\n60s and 70s Rock Nightclub History Navigation and Tracker\n\nOver the years, I have done detailed research into the performance histories of various rock music nightclubs in the 1960s and 70s. The goal has always been to identify an exact record of every musical performer at a club over a given period. Due to the paucity of sources, sometimes the chronicle may be incomplete, but not for lack of effort. In some cases, for less well-documented clubs, the goal is to identify every performer, even if the exact nights of their performances can't be nailed down.\n\n60s rock found its footing in psychedelic ballrooms, and moved on up to civic auditoriums and basketball arenas. By the 1970s, the big business of rock touring took away many of the regional differences. If you saw the Grateful Dead, or Mott The Hoople or the Doobie Brothers in San Francisco, Des Moines or Boston, it was probably pretty much the same in each city. As the biggest bands moved up to the auditoriums, however, the rock audience got older and found that they liked a drink while watching music.\n\nRock nightclubs, rare in the 60s, were common in the 1970s. Unlike the big arenas, there were distinct differences between regions. There were even differences between parts of the Bay Area. The demographics of parking, FM radio and economies made each club distinct from its competitors, at least for a while. I have not used a precise definition of what makes a \"rock nightclub,\" but the general criteria are:\n\nOriginal live rock music (with some exceptions, perhaps)\n\nLiquor (at least beer)\n\nTables and chairs (at least some of the time)\n\nThis excludes rock venues with a bar in the back, or coffee shops. There isn't a size limit to my analysis, but my goal is to look at the middle tier of 60s and 70s rock.\n\nBy identifying a complete list, the club histories skew away from impressionistic memories that can be clouded by nostalgia. Seeing who was actually booked, the status of that performer at the time--as opposed to how important they would become later--gives a clear picture of the economic forces of any club, and in turn can be revealing about the city and the regional rock scene at the time.\n\nI would not have been able to complete all this work without the assistance of co-conspirators. The Chicken On A Unicycle website has been a joint effort. As to the blogs, the Comment Threads are filled with detailed updates from known and unknown participants, greatly enhancing the scholarship.\n\nThis tracker has links to various associated pages on Chicken and specific blog posts. Here and there I also link to a few other posts by others that fulfill my needs. Some forthcoming posts are listed (without links yet, of course) in anticipation of the future.\n\nA Tom Weller flyer for Country Joe and The Fish at Berkeley's Jabberwock, November 1-3, 1966\n\nBerkeley Rock Nightclubs\n\nThe Jabberwock, 2901 Telegraph Avenue, Berkeley, CA 1964-67\n\nThe Jabberwock was a folk club, but it gave birth to Country Joe and The Fish.\n\nList of Jabberwock Performances 1964-July 8, 1967\n\nJabberwock Poster Art\n\nThe Questing Beast, 2504 San Pablo Avenue, Berkeley, CA: Performance History 1965-66\n\nCounty Joe and The Fish got started at the Jabberwock, but they went electric at the Questing Beast.\n\n2976 College Avenue, Open Theater, Berkeley, CA 1965-1966 History\n\nNew Orleans House, 1505 San Pablo Avenue, Berkeley, CA Performance Listing 1966-1970\n\nThe New Orleans, opened as a home for New Orleans-style jazz, rapidly became a rock club by 1966. It was the primary nightclub for original rock music in Berkeley throughout the 1960s. We attempt to identify every performer from 1967 to 1969, and its an excellent survey of original California rock bands just one tier below the Fillmore and Avalon.\n\n1505 San Pablo Avenue, Berkeley, CA: New Orleans House Performers List, January-March 1967 ('67 Berkeley I)\n\n1505 San Pablo Avenue, Berkeley, CA: New Orleans House Performers List, April-June 1967 ('67 Berkeley IV)\n\nFreight and Salvage, 1827 San Pablo Avenue, Berkeley, CA Performance Listing 1968-70\n\nThe Freight and Salvage was really a folk club, but it was founded by Berkeley hippies in 1968, and it was part of the rock music community, in it own way. We attempt to identify every performer at the Freight and Salvage in 1968 and '69, and its a primer on American music over the next 50 years.\n\nMandrake's, 1048 University Avenue, Berkeley, CA Performance List 1965-1973\n\nMandrake's, a converted pool hall on University and San Pablo, mainly presented blues and jazz, but by the end of the 1960s, it presented a lot of rock as well.\n\nThe Babylon, 2504 San Pablo Avenue, Berkeley, CA Performance Listings 1969-70\n\nThe Babylon featured original rock music, almost all from local East Bay bands.\n\nThe Long Branch, 2504 San Pablo Avenue, Berkeley, CA Performers Listing May-December 1971\n\nThe Long Branch, at the infamous Berkeley music address of 2504 San Pablo, expanded the building and replaced the Babylon in May 1971. This post is a detailed discussion of every performer who was known to have played the Long Branch in 1971, even if some dates are uncertain.\n\nThe Long Branch, 2504 San Pablo Avenue, Berkeley, CA: Performers Listing January-June 1972 (Long Branch II)\n\n2504 San Pablo Avenue, Berkeley, CA: The Long Branch Performance History October-December 1973 (Long Branch III)\n\nKeystone Berkeley, 2119 University Avenue, Berkeley, CA Performance Listings 1972\n\nThe Keystone Berkeley replaced the New Monk, going from a fraternity beer joint to Berkeley's primary rock club throughout the 1970s. This post is a detailed discussion of every performer who played Keystone Berkeley in 1972.\n\nKeystone Berkeley, Berkeley, CA: Performance Listings, January-April 1975\n\nThe Keystone was still the second best gig in the Bay Area during this period.\n\n2119 University Avenue, Berkeley, CA: The Keystone Berkeley\n\nJerry Garcia played the Keystone Berkeley at least 243 times. His relationship to Keystone Berkeley was unique to Garcia's career, and an essential lynchpin of the club.\n\nBay Area Survey Rock Nightclub Survey, January-April 1974 Performance Listings\n\nA snapshot of East Bay rock nightclubs in 1974, including analysis of performers for Keystone Berkeley (January), the Long Branch (February), Bill Graham Presents (March, at Winterland and Berkeley Community Theater) and the Freight and Salvage (April).\n\nSan Francisco Rock Nightclubs\n\nThe Matrix, 3138 Fillmore Street, San Francisco, CA Performance Listing 1965-70\n\nThe Matrix was San Francisco's first, and for a while only, hippie rock night club. This page is a list of performers at the Matrix, to the best of our knowledge.\n\nThe Matrix, 3138 Fillmore Street, San Francisco, CA: Performer Listing January-June 1970 (Matrix I)\n\nThis post provides a detailed analysis of all the known performers at the Matrix during the first half of 1970. As the tiny Matrix became a less lucrative gig, the club turned into a musician's hangout and the music played was pretty interesting. Not least--besides Bruce Springsteen dropping in--Jerry Garcia began his long collaboration with bassist John Kahn.\n\nThe Matrix, 3138 Fillmore Street, San Francisco, CA: Performer Listing July-September 1970 (Matrix II)\n\nContinued analysis of performers at the Matrix in 1970. Merl Saunders joins Garcia and Kahn.\n\nThe Matrix, 3138 Fillmore Street, San Francisco, CA: Performer Listing October-December 1970 (Matrix III)\n\nThe Matrix is in decline a club, but it is all the more fascinating for having become Jerry Garcia's hangout.\n\nThe Boarding House, 960 Bush Street, San Francisco, CA: Performance List March-July 1971 (Boarding House I)\n\nThe first year of the Boarding House in 1971 was quite different than the years that followed. Proprietor David Allen tried to make it an \"Acoustic Music Salon\" and Dinner club, and San Francisco didn't seem to want that.\n\nThe Boarding House, 960 Bush Street, San Francisco, CA: Performance List August-December 1971 (Boarding House II)\n\nWhisky A Go-Go, San Francisco, 568 Sacramento St, San Francisco, CA: March 11, 1967\n\nThe West Hollywood Whisky A-Go-Go had a long forgotten San Francisco branch. I obtained a photo of the Grateful Dead's performance there on March 11, 1967. I discuss what little is known about the club, with some links to other posts.\n\n2629 Bayshore Blvd, San Francisco, CA The Moonrose Forest (formerly George's Log Cabin) November 1969\n\nBay Area Rock Nightclub Survey, May-September 1974\n\nA snapshot of Bay Area rock nightclubs in 1974, including analysis of performers at The Great American Music Hall (May), the Boarding House (June), the Orphanage (July), the Inn Of The Beginning in Cotati (August) and the Lion's Share in San Anselmo (September).\n\nPalo Alto Rock Nightclubs\n\nPalo Alto Psychedelic Rock Shows, 1965-66 (Palo Alto I)\n\nPalo Alto, to hear Palo Altans tell it, was the birthplace of psychedelic rock. Palo Alto's first rock nightclub was The Big Beat, at 998 San Antonio Road. Right before it opened, the club was rented by The Merry Pranksters for the Palo Alto Acid Test on December 18, 1965, with the Grateful Dead providing the music. The Big Beat was never that interesting again.\n\nPalo Alto Psychedelic Rock Shows, 1967 (Palo Alto II)\n\nIn April, 1967, The Poppycock opened in downtown Palo Alto, at 135 University Avenue. It presented original rock bands, and downtown Palo Alto slowly came to life. I list what is known about performers at The Poppycock this year (and elsewhere in Palo Alto).\n\nPalo Alto Psychedelic Rock Shows, 1968 (Palo Alto III)\n\nIn 1968, the modest Poppycock books a lot of good Bay Area rock bands. I review the status of all the known performers from the year.\n\nPalo Alto Psychedelic Rock Shows, January-June 1969 (Palo Alto IV)\n\nRock music is exploding in the Bay Area, and some really good bands play the Poppycock. The club is starting to seem on the small side, however. This post identifies all the Poppycock performers from the first half of 1969.\n\nPalo Alto Psychedelic Rock Shows, July-December 1969 (Palo Alto V)\n\nIn the second half of 1969, the Poppycock has become too small to compete with other venues. Some really good bands play the club on weeknights, some that really interest us today, but the club was wearing out its welcome in downtown Palo Alto. It would close quietly in mid-1970.\n\nSeptember 4, 1970 The Checkmate Inn, Nairobi Village Shopping Center, 1675 Bay Road (at University), East Palo Alto, CA: Dance Concert with Metropolitan Sound Company 2am-? (Lost Horizons VI)\n\nEast Palo Alto is usually left out of the Palo Alto story, because, well, it's inconvenient.\n\nIn Your Ear, 135 University Avenue, Palo Alto, CA: Performer Listing, May 1971-December 1972\n\nIn Your Ear opened at the site of the Poppycock (135 University). Nominally, it was a jazz club, but it had a broad booking policy that included jazz, blues and rock. A fire on New Year's Eve 1972 closed the club. Fellow scholar CryptDev has the details of all the known performers.\n\nHomer's Warehouse, 79 Homer Lane, Palo Alto, CA: Performer Listing 1971-73\n\nQuiet Palo Alto did not like the noisy rock of the Poppycock downtown. A few blocks away, and quite literally across the railroad tracks, Homer's Warehouse booked bands in a quonset hut that was formerly a warehouse. The fun lasted until 1973. CryptDev has what details survive of the known performers.\n\nSophie's, 260 S. California Avenue, Palo Alto, CA: Performer Listing 1976\n\nAfter a quiet period, rock music returned to Palo Alto. This time, however, it wasn't downtown, but rather on the main street of what was formerly Mayfield, the rowdy predecessor to Palo Alto. Sophie's opened in 1975. I review the performers in 1976, when the club was migrating from just being a Top 40 dance bar to an original music club (Sophie's would become the Keystone Palo Alto in 1977).\n\nKeystone Palo Alto, 260 South California, Palo Alto, CA: Performers List, January-July 1977 (Palo Alto VIII)\n\nFreddie Herrera extended his Keystone empire to Palo Alto, but survival was initially a close call.\n\nKeystone Palo Alto, 260 South California Avenue, Palo Alto, CA: Performance List, August-December 1977 (Palo Alto IX)\n\nPalo Alto Rock History Navigation\n\nI have a page listing all my Palo Alto and South Bay posts, including Night Clubs, other venues and some bands.\n\nThe Leaves, opening the Whisky A-Go-Go in Sunnyvale, August 1965\n\nBay Area Rock Nightclubs\n\nThese are some pages and posts to assorted rock nightclubs around the Bay Area\n\nThe In Room, Swiss Chalet, 635 Old County Road, Belmont, CA 1965\n\nThe In Room opened in February 1965 and did not last a year. Yet an 8-week booking for the Warlocks made the band.\n\nWhisky A-Go-Go, Washington and Murphy, Sunnyvale, CA: Fall 1965\n\nBriefly, there was a franchise of West Hollywood's legendary Whisky A-Go-Go in suburban Sunnyvale, between San Jose and Palo Alto. It only lasted a few months--but we have photos.\n\nWayne Manor, Washington and Murphy, Sunnyvale, CA: 1966-68\n\nThe Sunnyvale Whisky closed, and then re-opened as Wayne Manor, a Batman-themed club. At the time, the comic book was a popular TV show.\n\nFrenchy's, Hayward, CA: Performance Listings, January-June 1966\n\nThere were very few rock clubs booking original music in the Bay Area in early 1966, but Frenchy's, at 29907 Mission Boulevard in Hayward, was one of them. Far more interesting than you might think.\n\nInn Of The Beginning, 8201 Redwood Highway, Cotati, CA: Performance Listings 1968-75\n\nA complete list of performers at the Inn Of The Beginning from 1968-75, albeit without commentary.\n\nChateau Liberte, 22700 Old Santa Cruz Highway, Los Gatos, CA\n\nThe Chateau Liberte was a legendary early 1970s nightclub, but I have been unable to find a consistent source for bookings. This post is a meditation on the peculiar economics of the club itself (with a picture of the Zig Zag Man swimming pool).\n\nThe Red Ram, 444 E William St, San Jose, CA\n\nI know very little about this place, except that the pizza joint near San Jose State booked rock bands for a few months in 1970. At this time (early 1970), there were no nightclubs in San Jose booking original rock bands.\n\nLion's Share, 60 Red Hill Avenue, San Anselmo, CA: Performance Listings April-June 1971\n\nThe Lion's Share was just a local musicians hangout, but since it was in Marin County, it was a happening place for a while.\n\nWest Hollywood Rock Nightclubs\n\nWhisky A-Go-Go, West Hollywood, CA: Performance List 1966-70\n\nThe Whisky A-Go-Go in West Hollywood started as a dance club, but it became America's first high profile rock club. Local bands and touring bands wanted to play the tiny Whisky in the 60s, just to see and be seen.\n\nWhisky A-Go-Go, West Hollywood, CA: Performance List 1971-75\n\nWhiskey A-Go-Go, 8901 Sunset Blvd (at Clark), West Hollywood, CA: January-June 1971 Performance Listings (Whisky I)\n\nRather unexpectedly, with the rise of The Troubadour, the Whisky becomes the home for Jazz-rock and Prog bands.\n\nThe Trip, West Hollywood, CA: Performers List 1965-66\n\nElmer Valentine, the proprietor of the Whisky A-Go-Go, had another West Hollywood club, The Trip (at 8572 W. Sunset).
