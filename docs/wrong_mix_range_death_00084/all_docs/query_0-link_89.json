        "text": "http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/28/a...71dd379b3dfeff&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss\n\nBy JON PARELES\n\nPublished: February 28, 2008\n\nBuddy Miles, the drummer in Jimi Hendrix's Band of Gypsys and a hitmaker under his own name with the song \"Them Changes,\" died on at his home in Austin, Tex. He was 60.\n\nMr. Miles suffered from congestive heart failure, his publicist, Duane Lee, said, according to Reuters. Mr. Lee said he did not know the official cause of death.\n\nMr. Miles played with a brisk, assertive, deeply funky attack that made him an apt partner for Hendrix. With his luxuriant Afro and his American-flag shirts, he was a prime mover in the psychedelic blues-rock of the late 1960's, not only with Hendrix but also as a founder, drummer and occasional lead singer for the Electric Flag. During the 1980's, he was widely heard as the lead voice of the California Raisins in television commercials\n\nGeorge Allen Miles Jr., whose aunt nicknamed him after the big-band drummer Buddy Rich, was born in Omaha and began playing drums as a child. He was 12 years old when he joined his father's jazz group, the Bebops. As a teenager he also worked with soul and rhythm-and-blues acts, among them the Ink Spots, the Delfonics and Wilson Pickett. By 1967, he had moved to Chicago, where he was a founding member of the Electric Flag.\n\nThat band included a horn section and played blues, soul and rock; it made its debut at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967 and released its first album in 1968. But the Electric Flag was short-lived. Mr. Miles formed the Buddy Miles Express, and its first album, \"Electric Church,\" was produced by Hendrix, whom he had met when both were sidemen on the rhythm-and-blues circuit. Mr. Miles appeared on two songs on the Hendrix album \"Electric Ladyland.\" When Hendrix disbanded the Jimi Hendrix Experience and replaced his trio's British musicians with African-Americans, Mr. Miles joined him in the Band of Gypsys along with Billy Cox on bass.\n\nOn the last night of the 1960s, a New Year's Eve show, they recorded \"Band of Gypsys,\" an album that included \"Them Changes.\" Mr. Miles also worked in the studio with Hendrix, and appears on \"Cry of Love,\" released after Hendrix died in 1970.\n\nHe re-recorded \"Them Changes\" with his own band, and it became a hit and a blues-rock staple; Eric Clapton and Steve Winwood performed it on Monday at Madison Square Garden. Through the 1970s, Mr. Miles made albums with his own bands. He also made a live album with Carlos Santana in 1972, and sang on the 1987 Santana album \"Freedom.\" During his career he appeared on more than 70 albums and worked with musicians including Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Barry White and George Clinton.\n\nHe was imprisoned on drug-related convictions during the late 1970's and early 1980's, but when he emerged, advertising recharged his career. He sang the lead vocal for the California Raisins, whose Claymation commercials were so popular that they led to a string of albums by the fictional group. Two of them, \"California Raisins\" and \"Meet the Raisins,\" shipped a million copies. Mr. Miles also produced and performed commercials for Cadillac and Harley Davidson.\n\nHe and Mr. Cox recorded a live album, \"The Band of Gypsys Return,\" in 2004. Mr. Miles continued to perform even after suffering a stroke in 2005. Survivors include his partner, Sherrilae Chambers.\n\nJeff Healey\n\nLegendary Toronto blues guitarist and old-style jazz aficionado Jeff Healey died yesterday in Toronto's St. Joseph's Hospital after a lifelong battle with a rare form of cancer – retinoblastoma – that blinded him in his first year. He was 41.\n\n\"Discovered\" in a Toronto club in 1982 by Texas blues guitarist, the late Stevie Ray Vaughan, Healey astonished music fans with his outrageous technique. Self-taught by age 4, he laid the electric guitar across his lap and played it in much the same way as a pianist manipulates a keyboard.\n\nThough he specialized in blues-based rock and sold more than a million copies of his Grammy-nominated 1988 debut album See the Light – released after a cameo performance in the Hollywood movie Road House with Patrick Swayze – Healey's real passion was vintage American jazz.\n\nHealey hosted a long-running CBC Radio series, My Kinda Jazz, before moving the program to Toronto's Jazz-FM station, relying solely on his personal collection of 35,000 rare and obscure 78 rpm recordings and an encyclopedic knowledge of the music and personalities he featured in the show.\n\nHealey also played trumpet and clarinet, and in the past decade recorded three albums of vintage jazz with Jeff Healey's Jazz Wizards, including It's Tight Like That.\n\nHealey was an internationally known star who shared stages with B.B. King and Vaughan, and recorded with George Harrison, Mark Knopfler and blues legend Jimmy Rogers.\n\nAt the time of his death Healey was planning to release his first rock/blues album in eight years, Mess of Blues, recorded in studios in Toronto, in concert in London, England, and at the popular Entertainment District club that bore his name, Jeff Healey's Roadhouse. It goes on sale in Europe March 20, and in Canada and the U.S. April 22.\n\n\"Jeff was an amazing colleague and as a musician and a personality, in a league of his own,\" the Jazz Wizards' drummer Gary Scriven said last night. \"It was always game on for him. His generosity and sense of humour lasted till the end. He was brave without ever being dramatic. In a word, Jeff was inspirational.\"\n\nIn 2007 Healey underwent surgery to remove cancerous tissue from his legs and both lungs. Radiation and chemotherapy failed to halt the spread of the disease, as did alternative homeopathic treatment in the U.S. this year.\n\nDespite his illness, Healey continued to perform across Canada with both his blues band and jazz ensemble, and had scheduled a tour of Germany and the U.K., including an appearance on BBC's Jools Holland Show, in April, his publicist said.\n\n\"I'm so sad to hear this news,\" award-winning Canadian guitarist and music producer Colin Linden said on the phone from New York. \"There was a quality of genius in the way Jeff harnessed that distinctive technique. He was such a natural musician.\"\n\nVeteran Toronto guitarist Danny Marks, who fronts the Jeff Healey Band at the Roadhouse on Tuesday nights, said \"Jeff was a tremendous musician and always so kind. He always knew the odds were against him, but it never ruined his sense of humour. I used to love to watch him having fun – he'd throw his head back and laugh like a little child.\"\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/03/arts/music/03diddley.html#\n\nBo Diddley, a singer and guitarist who invented his own name, his own guitars, his own beat and, with a handful of other musical pioneers, rock 'n' roll itself, died Monday at his home in Archer, Fla. He was 79.\n\nThe cause was heart failure, a spokeswoman, Susan Clary, said. Mr. Diddley had a heart attack last August, only months after suffering a stroke while touring in Iowa.\n\nIn the 1950s, as a founder of rock 'n' roll, Mr. Diddley — along with Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis and a few others — helped to reshape the sound of popular music worldwide, building on the templates of blues, Southern gospel, R&B and postwar black American vernacular culture.\n\nHis original style of rhythm and blues influenced generations of musicians. And his Bo Diddley syncopated beat — three strokes/rest/two strokes — became a stock rhythm of rock 'n' roll.\n\nIt can be found in Buddy Holly's \"Not Fade Away,\" Johnny Otis's \"Willie and the Hand Jive,\" the Who's \"Magic Bus,\" Bruce Springsteen's \"She's the One\" and U2's \"Desire,\" among hundreds of other songs.\n\nYet the rhythm was only one element of his best records. In songs like \"Bo Diddley,\" \"Who Do You Love,\" \"Mona,\" \"Crackin' Up,\" \"Say, Man,\" \"Ride On Josephine\" and \"Road Runner,\" his booming voice was loaded up with echo and his guitar work came with distortion and a novel bubbling tremolo. The songs were knowing, wisecracking and full of slang, mother wit and sexual cockiness. They were both playful and radical.\n\nSo were his live performances: trancelike ruckuses instigated by a large man with a strange-looking guitar. It was square and he designed it himself, long before custom guitar shapes became commonplace in rock.\n\nMr. Diddley was a wild performer: jumping, lurching, balancing on his toes and shaking his knees as he wrestled with his instrument, sometimes playing it above his head. Elvis Presley, it has long been supposed, borrowed from Mr. Diddley's stage moves; Jimi Hendrix, too.\n\nStill, for all his fame, Mr. Diddley felt that his standing as a father of rock 'n' roll was never properly acknowledged. It frustrated him that he could never earn royalties from the songs of others who had borrowed his beat.\n\n\"I opened the door for a lot of people, and they just ran through and left me holding the knob,\" he told The New York Times in 2003.\n\nHe was a hero to those who had learned from him, including the Rolling Stones and the Beatles. A generation later, he became a model of originality to punk or post-punk bands like the Clash and the Fall.\n\nIn 1979 Joe Strummer and Paul Simonon of the Clash asked that Mr. Diddley open for them on the band's first American tour. \"I can't look at him without my mouth falling open,\" Mr. Strummer, star-struck, said during the tour.\n\nFor his part Mr. Diddley had no misgivings about facing a skeptical audience. \"You cannot say what people are gonna like or not gonna like,\" he explained later to the biographer George R. White. \"You have to stick it out there and find out! If they taste it, and they like the way it tastes, you can bet they'll eat some of it!\"\n\nMr. Diddley was born Otha Ellas Bates in McComb, Miss., a small city about 15 miles from the Louisiana border. He was reared primarily by Gussie McDaniel, the first cousin of his mother, Esther Wilson. After the death of her husband, Ms. McDaniel, who had three children of her own, took the family to Chicago, where young Otha's name was changed to Ellas B. McDaniel. Gussie McDaniel became his legal guardian and sent him to school.\n\nHe was 6 when the family resettled on Chicago's South Side. He described his youth as one of school, church, trouble with street toughs and playing the violin for both band and orchestra, under the tutelage of O. W. Frederick, a prominent music teacher at the Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Gussie McDaniel taught Sunday school. Ellas studied classical violin from 7 to 15 and started on guitar at 12, when a family member gave him an acoustic model.\n\nHe then enrolled at Foster Vocational School, where he built a guitar as well as a violin and an upright bass. But he dropped out before graduating. Instead, with guitar in hand, he began performing in a duo with his friend Roosevelt Jackson, who played the washtub bass. The group became a trio when they added another guitarist, Jody Williams, then a quartet when they added a harmonica player, Billy Boy Arnold.\n\nThe band, first called the Hipsters and then the Langley Avenue Jive Cats, started playing at the Maxwell Street open-air market. They were sometimes joined by another friend, Samuel Daniel, known as Sandman because of the shuffling rhythms he made with his feet on a wooden board sprinkled with sand.\n\nMr. Diddley could not make a living playing with the Jive Cats in the early days, so he found jobs where he could: at a grocery store, a picture-frame factory, a blacktop company. He worked as an elevator operator and a meat packer. He also started boxing, hoping to turn professional.\n\nIn 1954 Mr. Diddley made a demonstration recording with his band, which now included Jerome Green on maracas. Phil and Leonard Chess of Chess Records liked the demo, especially Mr. Diddley's tremolo on the guitar, a sound that seemed to slosh around like water. They saw it as a promising novelty and encouraged the group to return.\n\nBy Billy Boy Arnold's account, the next day, as the band and the men who were soon to be their producers were setting up for a rehearsal, they were idly casting about for a stage name for Ellas McDaniel when Mr. Arnold thought of Bo Diddley. The name described a \"bow-legged guy, a comical-looking guy,\" Mr. Arnold said, as quoted by Mr. White in his 1995 biography, \"Bo Diddley: Living Legend.\"\n\nThat may be all there is to tell about the name, except for the fact that a certain one-string guitar — native to the Mississippi Delta, often homemade, in which a length of wire is stretched between two nails in a board — is called a diddley bow. By his account, however, Mr. Diddley had never played one.\n\nIn any case, Otha Ellas McDaniel had a new name and the title of a new song, whose lyrics began, \"Bo Diddley bought his babe a diamond ring.\" \"Bo Diddley\" became the A side of his first single, in 1955, on the Checker label, a subsidiary of Chess. It reached No. 2 on the Billboard singles chart.\n\nMr. Diddley said he had first heard the \"Bo Diddley beat\" — three-stroke/rest/two-stroke, or bomp-ba-domp-ba-domp, ba-domp-domp — in a church in Chicago. But variations of it were in the air. The children's game hambone used a similar rhythm, and so did the ditty that goes \"shave and a haircut, two bits.\"\n\nThe beat is also related to the Afro-Cuban clave, which had been popularized at the time by the New Orleans mambo carnival song \"Jock-A-Mo,\" recorded by Sugar Boy Crawford in 1953.\n\nAttachments\n\n02diddley-600.jpg\n\nWhatever the source, Mr. Diddley felt the beat's power. In early songs like \"Bo Diddley\" and \"Pretty Thing,\" he arranged the rhythm for tom-toms, guitar, maracas and voice, with no cymbals and no bass. (Also arranged in his signature rhythm was the eerie \"Mona,\" a song of praise he wrote for a 45-year-old exotic dancer who worked at the Flame Show Bar in Detroit; this song became the template for Buddy Holly's \"Not Fade Away.\")\n\nAppearing on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" in 1955, Mr. Diddley was asked to play \"Sixteen Tons,\" the song popularized by Tennessee Ernie Ford. Without telling Mr. Sullivan, he played \"Bo Diddley\" instead. Afterward, in an off-camera confrontation, Mr. Sullivan told him that he would never work in television again. Mr. Diddley did not play again on a network show for 10 years.\n\nFor decades Mr. Diddley was bitter about his relationship with the Chess family, whom he accused of withholding money owed to him. In her book \"Spinning Blues Into Gold,\" Nadine Cohodas quoted Marshall Chess, Leonard's son, as saying, \"What's missing from Bo's version of events is all the gimmes.\" Mr. Diddley would borrow so heavily against projected royalties, Mr. Chess said, that not much was left over in the final accounting.\n\nMr. Diddley's watery tremolo effect, from 1955 onward, came from one of the first effects boxes to be manufactured for guitars: the DeArmond Model 60 Tremolo Control. But Mr. Diddley contended that he had already built something similar himself, with automobile parts and an alarm-clock spring.\n\nHis first trademark guitar was also handmade: he took the neck and the circuitry off a Gretsch guitar and connected it to a square body he had built. In 1958 he asked Gretsch to make him a better one to the same specifications. Gretsch made it as a limited-edition guitar called \"Big B.\"\n\nOn songs like \"Who Do You Love,\" his guitar style — bright chicken-scratch rhythm patterns on a few strings at a time — was an extension of his early violin playing, he said.\n\n\"My technique comes from bowing the violin, that fast wrist action,\" he told Mr. White, explaining that his fingers were too big to move around easily. Rather than fingering the fretboard, Mr. Diddley said, he tuned the guitar to an open E and moved a single finger up and down to create chords.\n\nAs his fame rose, his personal life grew complicated. His first marriage, at 18, to Louise Woolingham, lasted less than a year. His second marriage, in 1949, to Ethel Smith, unraveled in the late 1950s. He then moved from Chicago to Washington, settling in the Mount Pleasant district, where he built a studio in his home.\n\nSeparated from his wife, he was performing in Birmingham, Ala., when, backstage, he met a young door-to-door magazine saleswoman named Kay Reynolds, a fan, who was 15 and white. They moved in together in short order and were soon married, in spite of Southern taboos against intermarriage.\n\nDuring the late 1950s Mr. Diddley's band featured a female guitarist, Peggy Jones (stage-named Lady Bo), at a time when there were scarcely any women in rock. She was replaced by Norma-Jean Wofford, whom Mr. Diddley called the Duchess. He pretended she was his sister, he said, to be in a better position to protect her on the road.\n\nThe early 1960s were low times. Chess, searching for a hit, had Mr. Diddley make albums to capitalize on the twist dance craze, as Chubby Checker had done, and on the surf music of the Beach Boys. But soon a foreign market for his earlier music began to grow, thanks in large part to the Rolling Stones, a newly popular band that was regularly playing several of his songs in its concerts. It paved the way for Mr. Diddley's successful tour of Britain in the fall of 1963, performing with the Everly Brothers, Little Richard and the Rolling Stones, the opening act.\n\nBut Mr. Diddley was not willing to move to Europe, and in America the picture worsened: the Beatles, the Stones, Bob Dylan and the Byrds quickly made him sound quaint. When work all but dried up, Mr. Diddley moved to New Mexico in the early 1970s and became a deputy sheriff in the town of Los Lunas. With his sound updated to resemble hard rock and soul, he continued to make albums for Chess until his contract expired in 1974.\n\nHis recording career never picked up after that, despite flirtations with synthesizers, religious rock and hip-hop. But he continued apace as a performer and public figure, popping up in places both obvious, like rock 'n' roll nostalgia revues, and not so obvious: a Nike advertisement, the film \"Trading Places\" with Eddie Murphy, the 1979 tour with the Clash, and inaugural balls for two presidents, George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton.\n\nHis last recording was the 1996 album \"A Man Amongst Men\" (Code Blue/Atlantic), which was nominated for a Grammy. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 and in 1998 was inducted into the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences Hall of Fame as a musician of lasting historical importance.\n\nSince the early 1980s Mr. Diddley had lived in Archer, Fla., near Gainesville, where he owned 76 acres and a recording studio. His passions were fishing and old cars, including a 1969 purple Cadillac hearse.\n\nThe last of Mr. Diddley's marriages was to Sylvia Paiz, in 1992; his spokeswoman, Ms. Clary, said they were no longer married. His survivors include his children, Evelyn Kelly, Ellas A. McDaniel, Tammi D. McDaniel and Terri Lynn McDaniel; a brother, the Rev. Kenneth Haynes; and 15 grandchildren, 15 great-grandchildren and three great-great-grandchildren.\n\nMr. Diddley attributed his longevity to abstinence from drugs and drinking, but in recent years he had suffered from diabetes. After a concert in Council Bluffs, Iowa, on May 13, 2007, he had a stroke and was taken to Creighton University Medical Center in Omaha. On Aug. 28 he suffered a heart attack in Gainesville and was hospitalized.\n\nMr. Diddley always believed that he and Chuck Berry had started rock 'n' roll, and the fact that he couldn't financially reap all that he had sowed made him a deeply suspicious man.\n\n\"I tell musicians, 'Don't trust nobody but your mama,' \" he said in an interview with Rolling Stone magazine in 2005. \"And even then, look at her real good.\"\n\nRobert Hazard, Philly rocker, dies at 59 | Philadelphia Inquirer | 08/06/2008\n\nBy Michael Klein\n\nINQUIRER STAFF WRITER\n\nRobert Hazard, 59, the Philadelphia-bred rock troubadour who wrote the pop anthem \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun,\" died unexpectedly Tuesday night after surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, his widow, Susan, confirmed today. Mr. Hazard, who lived with his wife and two teenage sons in the Adirondacks and in Vero Beach, Fla., last month had canceled a planned fall tour without explanation.\n\nRobert Hazard and the Heroes, born out of the late-1970s punk movement, were a fixture on the local bar scene through the mid-1980s.\n\nOne night in a motel in Delaware, Mr. Hazard sat in a bathtub and in 15 minutes wrote \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun,\" a sprightly pop tune covered in 1983 by Cyndi Lauper. Labeled a feminist anthem, it shot to No. 1. Miley Cyrus' remake is included on her new album, Breakout.\n\nIn an autobiography from 2003, Mr. Hazard - born Robert Rimato - acknowledged that his father was an opera singer. \"Obviously, I didn't follow in his footsteps, but did learn a bit about music appreciation,\" he wrote. \"I started singing and writing songs about about age 10. I didn't really play guitar till much later. In my teens I would audition at coffee houses like the Second of Autumn and the Edge\" in the Philadelphia area. \"I never got a job, but learned about acoustic music by hanging out at these places listening to Eric Andersen, Chris Smither, Jimmy Webb, and other great song writers and poet guitar players.\"\n\nFrom his first marriage, he had a daughter, Corrina. With Susan, whom he married in 1986, he had sons Rex and Remy. The couple own an antiques shop near their home in Old Forge, N.Y.\n\nIn his autobiography, Mr. Hazard recounted his big break in 1982:\n\n\"One night, we were playing a little joint called J.C. Dobbs on South Street. Kurt Loder was in town to review the opening of a world tour by another band called the Rolling Stones, who were playing at JFK Stadium that same night. After the Stones concert, Kurt stopped into Dobbs for a beer. I stayed up talking with him till 5 o'clock in the morning. The next month, there was a two-page spread in Rolling Stone magazine, pictures and all, raving about the band. Soon after that, we were signed to RCA Records.\"\n\nThe Hazard song \"Escalator of Life\" charted soon after.\n\nIn more recent years, he delved into country, forming a band The Hombres. He said his favorite shows were what he called \"the stripped-down acoustic concerts I did with my buddy Michael Pilla. I thought these were the most rewarding and the most appreciated by my audience.\"\n\nMemorial services were incomplete today, though Susan Hazard said something would be planned for next week in his hometown.\n\nfrom Wiki.....\n\nRobert Hazard (born Robert Rimato, died August 5, 2008), was a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, musician, probably best known for composing and recording the song \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\" which Cyndi Lauper covered, turning the song into a best-selling hit. He also composed the 1980s New Wave and MTV hits, \"Escalator of Life\" and \"Change Reaction\", which he performed with his band, Robert Hazard and the Heroes, which was popular in the Philadelphia club scene during the '80s. These songs appeared on the five song EP Robert Hazard, released in 1982. Hazard's first major label album, Wing of Fire, was released by RCA Records in January 1984.\n\nHazard was son of an opera singer. He was profiled in a 1981 Rolling Stone article by Kurt Loder. In the piece, Loder describes Hazard's musical history as a musician \"...who started out as a Dylan-era folkie, then spent eight years singing country western. 'I just love country music,' he explains -- which of course explains nothing, least of all the two years he subsequently spent with a reggae band...or his current electro-pop approach, which owes little to any of the above\".\n\nHis final recordings were country albums, beginning with The Seventh Lake (2003) and continuing with Blue Mountain (2004). In 2007, Rykodisc signed Hazard and released his album, Troubador.\n\nHazard died August 5, 2008 at age 59 after surgery for pancreatic cancer at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.[2]\n\nAttachments\n\n1984_promo_01.jpg\n\nBy MICHELINE MAYNARD\n\nPublished: October 17, 2008 New York Times\n\nDETROIT — Levi Stubbs, the gravelly-voiced, imploring lead singer of the Motown group the Four Tops, who stood out in 1960s pop classics like \"Reach Out, I'll Be There,\" and \"Bernadette,\" died on Friday at his home here. He was 72. His death was confirmed by the office of the Wayne County Medical Examiner. No cause was given. Mr. Stubbs had had a series of illnesses, including a stroke and cancer, that forced him to stop performing in 2000, although he briefly participated in the Four Tops' 50th-anniversary concert in 2004, which was broadcast on public television.\n\nFormed while its original members were in high school, the Four Tops were one of the most successful groups of the 20th century. They had more than 40 hits on the Billboard pop charts, including their first No. 1 single, \"I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch)\" in 1965.\n\nHugely popular abroad as well as in the United States, the group became a linchpin of Motown Records, the Detroit label started by Berry Gordy Jr., and was second only to the Temptations, with whom it was often compared, in popularity among its male artists. In 1990 the Four Tops were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nUnlike the Temptations, whose members regularly changed, the Tops exhibited extraordinary loyalty, with the original four remaining together for more than 40 years. In fact, they began their singing career almost a decade before joining Motown in 1963.\n\nIn 1953 Mr. Stubbs, a student at Pershing High School in Detroit, and his friend Abdul Fakir, known as Duke, attended a birthday party at which they met two other founding members of the group, Renaldo Benson, known as Obie and Lawrence Payton, who were students at Northern High School. (Mr. Fakir, who continues to perform with the Tops' current lineup, is now the last surviving member.) Originally calling themselves the Four Aims, they were rechristened the Four Tops in 1954 and signed with Chess Records, the Chicago rhythm and blues label, in 1956.\n\nIt was clear from the beginning that Mr. Stubbs, with his booming, rough-edged baritone, would be the lead singer, Mr. Fakir said in a 2004 interview. Yet many of his songs were written in a tenor range that pushed his voice higher and made it sound urgent and pleading. Mr. Stubbs and the group did not plan a pop career, but began as jazz singers. Leaving Detroit in the mid-1950s, they headed for New York, bouncing around the nightclub circuit.\n\nThe four singers shared a studio apartment and rotated three daytime suits among them; whoever had the more important appointment got first pick, Mr. Fakir recalled. The Tops added choreography to their act, but were advised to drop it when they toured with the jazz balladeer Billy Eckstine, who told them to master their singing. In 1963 Mr. Stubbs and the other Tops appeared on the \"Tonight\" show, then hosted by Jack Paar, singing a jazz arrangement of \"In the Still of the Night.\" Mr. Gordy, who saw their performance, told his staff to sign them up, and assigned the songwriting team of Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier and Eddie Holland to shape their sound and deliver them a hit song.\n\nIt took a year before the group recorded \"Baby, I Need Your Loving,\" followed by their first No. 1 hits, \"I Can't Help Myself\" in 1965 and \"Reach Out\" in 1966. \"We didn't know what bag to put them in,\" Mr. Dozier said in 2004. The three songwriters concluded that Mr. Stubbs's booming voice should be most prominent, backed by the Tops' harmonies; layered with vocals by a female group, the Andantes; and supported by the Motown studio band known as the Funk Brothers.\n\nThe combination worked.\n\n\"Stubbs's bold, dramatic readings of some of Holland-Dozier-Holland's choicest material set a high standard for contemporary soul in the mid-'60s,\" the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame said when the Tops were inducted. Snappily dressed, even offstage, the Tops toured extensively throughout the United States and around the world, recording more hits like \"It's the Same Old Song\" and \"Standing in the Shadows of Love.\"\n\nIn 1971 the group joined the Supremes to record a cover version of the Ike and Tina Turner song \"River Deep — Mountain High.\" But by then, relations with Motown were strained, and the group left the label after Mr. Berry moved it to Los Angeles. The Tops continued to record during the 1970s and '80s, often touring with the Temptations. Their biggest post-Motown hit was \"Ain't No Woman Like the One I've Got,\" in 1973.\n\nLevi Stubbles was born in Detroit on June 6, 1936, a cousin of the soul singer Jackie Wilson. His younger brother, Joe, sang with the Falcons and the Contours, two rhythm and blues groups.\n\nMr. Stubbs is survived by his wife of 48 years, Clineice; five children, Deborah, Beverly, Raymond, Kelly and Levi Jr.; and 11 grandchildren.\n\nMr. Stubbs took on a side project to become the voice of a man-eating plant, Audrey II, in the 1986 musical film \"Little Shop of Horrors,\" and also was the voice of Mother Brain, an evil character on the cartoon show \"Captain N: The Game Master,\" from 1989 to 1991.\n\nBy 1995, Mr. Stubbs's health had begun to fail, forcing him to curtail his performances. Mr. Payton died in 1997, and Mr. Benson in 2005. Mr. Fakir has continued singing with Mr. Payton's son Roquel; a former Temptation, Theo Peoples; and Ronnie McNair, a veteran Motown singer.\n\nBefore his death, Mr. Benson said in an interview that he was saddened by performing without Mr. Stubbs and Mr. Payton.\n\n\"It's like having one body with two limbs missing,\" he said.\n\nAttachments\n\nfour_tops_the_02l.gif"
