        "text": "Rock and blues lost 171 years of talent with the passing of harmonica master James Cotton at the age of 81 last Thursday and rock ‘n’ roll pioneer guitarist and singer Chuck Berry, who died on Saturday at 90.\n\nNeither musician had particularly strong Long Beach connections, though they did blow through, or duck-walk into town on several occasions.\n\nIt’s no surprise that Berry visited this city, since he missed very few towns throughout his long career that found him performing everywhere from the White House to Garden Grove’s old Gold Street.\n\nOne of Berry’s earliest shows in Long Beach was an undercard performance in a 1957 Rock ‘n’ Roll Revival (rock needed a revival in 1957?) with then-mega-star Fats Domino, who came into town with 20 million record sales under his lengthy belt. The show at the Municipal Auditorium brought in a raft of pre-hippie youths to stomp to the tunes of players on the all-star bill, including Charles Brown, Clyde McPhatter, the Five Satins and Lavern Baker.\n\nAnother fairly early show of Berry’s in Long Beach was his performance at the old Fox West Coast on Ocean Boulevard in May 1972. The Fox was a short-lived but great venue for rock shows in the early 1970s, drawing such acts as Little Feat, Van Morrison and Captain Beefheart.\n\nLong Beach wasn’t much of a blues town in the 1950s and 1960s, so we can’t find any sign of Cotton showing up until 1970, on a strange bill at the Long Beach Arena with headliners Chicago, along with Grand Funk Railroad and Norman Greenbaum (“Spirit in the Sky”). Interesting, that one.\n\nCotton was also in Long Beach a year later, with a decidedly bluesier bill headed by John Mayall and including Mike Bloomfield’s blues band at the Arena.\n\nWe called Vince Jordan, who ran and booked downtown’s Blue Cafe in its glory days. Jordan has stories, frequently embellished, about most blues artists, but he didn’t have much on Cotton.\n\n“He came into the club, but he didn’t play,” said Jordan. “He was just hanging out. He’s one of the few musicians who came in to see a show but didn’t wind up performing. Richie Sambora did, Jimmie Vaughan did, John Lee Hooker did, Taj Mahal did. But Cotton just listened.”\n\nThe sadly departed Long Beach Blues Festival brought killer acts to Cal State Long Beach and, at the end, Rainbow Lagoon, from 1984 to 2009.\n\nBoth Berry and Cotton were frequent performers at the annual Labor Day weekend festival.\n\nBerry played for the first time in 1992 on a bill headlined by James Brown, and he played the 2008 festival with John Mayall, Taj Mahal and others.\n\nCotton was at the fest a mess of times, starting with the first one with Elvin Bishop and occasional Long Beacher John Lee Hooker. Subsequent appearances included 1986, with Buddy Guy and Koko Taylor; 1988, with Bobby “Blue” Bland and the Staple Singers; 2000, with the Allman Brothers Band and Bo Diddley; and 2004, with Leon Russell, Dave Alvin and Macy Gray.\n\nFinally, confluence occurred, for the first and only time, at the 1997 Long Beach Blues Festival, when both Cotton and Berry were among the weekend’s performers.\n\nContact Tim Grobaty at 562-714-2116, tgrobaty@scng.com, @grobaty on Twitter."
