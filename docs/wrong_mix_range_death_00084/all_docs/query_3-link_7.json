        "text": "â€” Officials in Gainesville, Fla., have renamed the city's downtown plaza after rock 'n' roll legend and former Florida resident Bo Diddley. Diddley died in June 2008. Officials honored him Friday by unveiling a mural and renaming the downtown space the Bo Diddley Community Plaza. Diddley lived in Archer, a few miles southwest of Gainesville, and played at the plaza in 2006. Diddley's grandson Garry Mitchell thanked the city at the ceremony, and he and other family members gave city officialsone of Diddley's guitars. \"Gainesville's been really good to my granddad,\" Mitchell said. \"Thank you for your encouragement and your prayers. Long live rock and roll!\" Diddley's family planned to unveil his tombstone in Bronson, also southwest of Gainesville, at 10 a.m. Sunday.\n\nNia Vardalos enjoyed big success with the 2002 film My Big Fat Greek Wedding, but it wasn't enough. She longed to be a mom. So Vardalos took a break from acting to \"grieve an infertility situation.\" The 46-year-old actress-writer says she wrote six scripts during that time, and then she and her husband, Ian Gomez, adopted a 3-year-old girl. Vardalos says her daughter, now 4 years old, is \"definitely the best thing that ever happened to me.\" She adds: \"And that's a big statementbecause a miracle happened with My Big Fat Greek Wedding. But career success means nothing without personal happiness.\" Her latest film, My Life in Ruins, opened Friday."
