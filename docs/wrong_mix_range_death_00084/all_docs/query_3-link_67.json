        "text": "The blues guitarist Robert Lockwood Jr. used to tell the story of touring with Diddley, Sonny Boy Williamson and Muddy Waters in 1955, traveling east from Chicago. Diddley started off the tour as a fresh-faced opening act, but by the time they reached Atlantic City he was headlining because the predominantly white audience kept yelling for “Bo Diddley.” That was when Lockwood knew that blues was over, and rock roll had arrived.\n\nDiddley’s bravado would culminate a year later with “Who Do You Love.” Here, he walks forty-seven miles of barbed wire; wears a cobra snake for a necktie; carries a rattlesnake whip; has a chimney made from a human skull; and, in a flash of nihilism that wouldn’t find an equal until gangsta rap, he claims, “Just twenty-two, and I don’t mind dying.” Its pure, swaggering menace would inspire covers by the Doors, the Grateful Dead, Carlos Santana, the Band and the Yardbirds. Where Chuck Berry was a sleek convertible full of teenagers speeding down the road at night, Diddley was a gnarled, ancient medicine stick, connecting the dots between ritual African music, coded slave communication and the street games of the ghetto.\n\nOddly, despite the influence of his songs on the generations of rock to follow, Diddley’s biggest chart success was a novelty, “Say Man.” (A similar fate would befall Chuck Berry, whose only Number One was also a novelty, the bawdy, unrocking “My Ding-A-Ling.”) “Say Man” and its follow-up, “Say Man, Back Again,” were litanies of “yo’mama”-style jokes that originated when the Chess brothers recorded Diddley and Green goofing off in the studio playing the dozens.\n\nIn the decades since the Fifties, Diddley has lived several lifetimes. He moved from Chicago to Washington, D.C., where he built a home studio and recorded his Bo Diddley Is a Gunslinger album. Later, he moved to Albuquerque, where he worked as a deputy sheriff.\n\nAs new trends supplanted the Chess sound, the label pushed Diddley on each one — the Twist, surf rock — with diminishing returns. The British Invasion gave him a much-needed revival, and he returned to festivals and stages. As funk took over in the late Sixties and early Seventies, Diddley renamed himself the Black Gladiator and recorded a series of funky albums that have become cult favorites, recently reissued as Drive By Bo Diddley.\n\nSince the Seventies, he has had more revivals than some artists have had albums, as various bands from the Stones to the Clash to George Thorogood have included him on tours or in videos. And through it all, Diddley’s music has never been uncool. Even acts that stand in direct opposition to classic rock — the Smiths, Nine Inch Nails, the Jesus and Mary Chain (who named a song “Bo Diddley Is Jesus”) — have incorporated his beat, his tremolo or his material.\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nOne of the main factors Diddley attributes to his longevity is that he never messed with drugs or alcohol. Gloria Jolivet, who began singing with Diddley when she was seventeen, recalls, “We were doing a show in San Francisco at the Fillmore with Janis Joplin and Big Brother, and there was plenty of marijuana going around. But Bo would throw it in the trash. If anyone got onstage drunk, they were fired. He was so strict, which I didn’t appreciate at the time.”\n\nI meet Diddley’s newest protégée in Gainesville, at another instrument store, which Diddley has been patronizing for twenty years. Her name is Tiffany. She is a twenty-year-old dentistry student, wearing a powder-blue dress.\n\n“I started rock roll fifty years ago, and I’m trying something else,” Diddley informs me, beaming at her proudly. “She can’t sing, but there’s room in the business for people who can’t sing. When we get through with this, if it catches on, a lot of people are going to jump all over it.”\n\nIn the background, “Mona” plays over the store’s sound system. Diddley turns to Tiffany and informs her, “That’s me.”\n\nRelated\n\nDiddley is looking better, stronger and thinner then he did in New York, perhaps because of the diet his family and manager are trying to make him stick to. His radiant smile brightens the room.\n\n“This is one of the kindest, gentlest people you’ll ever meet in your life,” the store’s owner says, speaking of Diddley. “It’s unbelievable how many free concerts he’s done for charity and the Just Say No program.”\n\nDiddley smiles modestly and suggests we adjourn to the house he is renting. His real home is a large property with its own small lake in Archer, fifteen miles outside the city. He originally bought the house so could enjoy her racehorses. But, at present, he is living in exile."
