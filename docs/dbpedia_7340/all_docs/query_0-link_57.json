        "text": "In conjuction with the NHL’s centennial celebration of honoring the 100 greatest players in League history, the team at Blackout Dallas have taken their own twist. We’re continuing our Top 100 Stars countdown with ten more today.\n\nOver the past few days, we have been counting down some of the best Dallas Stars players of all time. The list only includes players who have been with the team since the move to Dallas in 1993, which still leaves plenty to choose from.\n\nThis list was compiled as a result of the “NHL 100,” the list that the NHL released on Jan. 27 showcasing the 100 best players of all time. It was released in conjunction with the NHL beginning their celebration of 100 years (1917-2017).\n\nWe began at 100 and have made our way to 50. For the results of the first 50, click here.\n\nBut let’s go ahead and continue the countdown.\n\nBlackout Dallas has counted down the first half of the Top 100 Dallas Stars in franchise history over the last two weeks. With players 50-1 still left to be seen, here are Stars legends 50-41…\n\nFeb 11, 2017; Nashville, TN, USA; Florida Panthers right wing Jaromir Jagr (68) lines up for a face off during the second period against the Nashville Predators at Bridgestone Arena. Mandatory Credit: Christopher Hanewinckel-USA TODAY Sports\n\n#50 – FORWARD, JAROMIR JAGR\n\nIn the lockout-shortened season of 2012-13, the Dallas Stars were led by perhaps the best player of NHL history, Jaromir Jagr. Prior to being traded to Boston at the deadline for 2013’s 29th overall pick (Jason Dickinson), the 45-year-old Czech led the Stars with 26 points in 34 games — including his 1,000th career assist. Jagr is behind only Wayne Gretzky in all-time scoring, with 1,898 points.\n\nMore from Blackout Dallas\n\n#49 – DEFENSEMAN, PAUL CAVALLINI\n\nToronto native Paul Cavallini tallied 233 points in a ten-year NHL career, after coming to the Washington Capitals with their 10th-round, 205th overall pick. The lefty played a total of 126 games with the Stars, scoring a career-high of 11 goals in the 1993-94 season. Cavallini led the League in plus/minus (+38) as an All-Star with St. Louis in 1989-1990.\n\n#48 – FORWARD, CODY EAKIN\n\nA prototypical two-way center with quick feet and heads-up playing style, Cody Eakin was acquired by the Dallas Stars from Washington in exchange for Mike Ribeiro in 2012. Since then, the 25-year-old from Winnipeg has scored 59 goals and 81 assists while doubling as bottom-six forechecker and steady top-line center. Eakin, or the “Ginga Ninja,” is on a contract with the Stars for two additional seasons after this one.\n\nDec 29, 2015; Columbus, OH, USA; Dallas Stars left wing Patrick Sharp (10) against the Columbus Blue Jackets at Nationwide Arena. The Jackets won 6-3. Mandatory Credit: Aaron Doster-USA TODAY Sports\n\n#47 – FORWARD, PATRICK SHARP\n\nIn September of 2015, Jim Nill shocked the hockey world when he suddenly obtained three-time Stanley Cup champion winger Patrick Sharp from the Chicago Blackhawks – in addition to Stephen Johns – for Ryan Garbutt and Trevor Daley.\n\nSharp provided a huge punch down the wing last season (Sharp scored 20 goals and added 35 assists, coupled with a mid-season 13-game point streak), and when healthy has done the same in 2016-17. The 35-year-old will likely be traded before the trade deadline as the Stars have zero years left on his contract.\n\n#46 – FORWARD, ULF DAHLEN\n\nTwice a 30-goal scorer for the Minnesota North Stars, Ulf Dahlen followed the ailing franchise to Dallas and potted 19 goals and 38 assists in his first year in green and black.\n\nDahlen, a 1st-round pick to the Rangers in 1985, later rejoined the Stars for his final NHL season, notching 17 goals and 20 assists at 36-years-old. After wrapping up his 655-point NHL career, Dahlen joined the Stars once more as an assistant coach from 2006 to 2008.\n\n#45 – FORWARD, PIERRE TURGEON\n\nWith the first pick in the 1987 NHL Entry Draft, the Buffalo Sabres nabbed 18-year-old Quebecois Pierre Turgeon, and he didn’t look back. While his peak years came with the aforementioned Buffalo and later the New York Rangers, Turgeon suited up in 207 games for Dallas and enumerated 42 goals and 87 assists.\n\nThe 1993 Lady Byng Trophy winner retired as a member of the Colorado Avalanche.\n\n#44 – FORWARD, VERNON FIDDLER\n\nA fan favorite for five seasons with the Dallas Stars, former Calder Cup champion Vernon Fiddler was a speedy, gritty, all-around two-way workhorse in green.\n\nThe erstwhile Stars alternate captain filled in 43 goals and 69 assists while also doing just about anything you could ask him to do. Fiddler, after a mid-season trade from New Jersey, is playing solid time for the team that originally drafted him: the Nashville Predators.\n\nJan 16, 2017; Pittsburgh, PA, USA; Washington Capitals defenseman Matt Niskanen (2) moves the puck up ice against the Pittsburgh Penguins during the second period at the PPG PAINTS Arena. The Penguins won 8-7 in overtime. Mandatory Credit: Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY Sports\n\n#43 – DEFENSEMAN, MATT NISKANEN\n\nDallas took the right-shooting defender named Matt Niskanen #28th overall in the 2005 Draft, and since then, he has shown his worth. Niskanen is remembered by most Stars fans as one of two pieces the organization tossed to Pittsburgh in exchange for Alex Goligoski, but he was very solid and driving offensive play prior to that.\n\nThe native of Virginia, MN totaled 82 points in three and a half seasons with Dallas, and now protects the defensive zone for Washington.\n\n#42 – GOALTENDER, ANDY MOOG\n\nAt 5’8″ and 175lbs, there are literally zero NHL teams that would utilize Andy Moog in net today, but that very thing is what made Moog one of the League’s best netminders in the 80s and 90s. Moog was a four-time All-Star, three-time Cup winner, and the 1989 Jennings Trophy recipient with the Oilers and Bruins, and also backstopped in four seasons for Dallas, recording a 75-64-26 record.\n\nMoog stopped 31 of 35 shots for a 6-4 victory in the Dallas Stars franchise’s first ever victory, a defeat of Detroit at Reunion Arena on October 5th, 1993. The B.C. native served time as goaltender coach and assistant coach for the Stars as well.\n\n#41 – FORWARD, PAT VERBEEK\n\nScoring 30 or more goals eight times in his 21-year career, Pat Verbeek is considered one of the flashiest players in League history. Always taking loads of penalties (2,905 career PIM) and never being the most consistent defensive player ails Verbeek’s Hockey Hall of Fame case, but being one of the best pure scorers of his era certainly helps it.\n\nVerbeek scored 522 goals and 544 points at the top-level in hockey — 72 and 92, respectively, coming with the Stars — and engraved his name on the Cup in 1999."
