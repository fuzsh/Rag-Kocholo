        "text": "Aug. 23, 2018\n\nBy Andy Zilch – Gulls Play-by-Play Announcer\n\nThe 2018 offseason is winding down with a few changes unfolding for the Anaheim Ducks organization with a number of transactions that could directly impact the Gulls.\n\nOne change is the promotion of assistant coach Marty Wilford who was named as the Ducks assistant coach on May 21. Wilford was a tenured assistant with the Ducks primary AHL affiliate spanning three cities over seven years. The St. Thomas, Ontario native has certainly made an impact on the defense corps in Anaheim by coaching and developing top Ducks blueline prospects in the AHL such as Hampus Lindholm, Josh Manson, Brandon Montour, Shea Theodore, Sami Vatanen, with the exception of Cam Fowler who made the Anaheim roster as an 18-year old. Wilford also oversaw the development of Marcus Pettersson and Andy Welinski, both of whom made their NHL debuts with Anaheim last season, and Jacob Larsson the season prior.\n\nThe list of newcomers transitions into players but the theme of champions continues. Joining the organization from the 2017 Stanley Cup championship Pittsburgh Penguins is forward Carter Rowney. Forward Ben Street and goaltender Jared Coreau are also recent winners, joining the organization from the Grand Rapids Griffins who won the Calder Cup in 2017.\n\nStreet, 31, not only has a championship but a wealth of leadership having worn a letter as an alternate captain the last five seasons for his respective AHL teams. His offensive talent is dominate as well, notching 357 points (144-213=357) in 428 career AHL games that spans eight seasons. The Coquitlam, B.C. native continues that offensive punch during a time that the Gulls hope to return to this season; the Calder Cup playoffs.\n\nOver 48 Calder Cup playoff games, Street has produced 34 points (13-21=34), helping lead the Griffins in scoring last season after registering 65 points (21-44=65). The veteran was named San Antonio’s IOA/American Specialty Man of the Year in 2015-16, named to the 2014 AHL All-Star Classic and won the 2006 NCAA national championship with Wisconsin.\n\nCoreau adds to the goaltending depth in his first professional season away from the Detroit Red Wings organization. Over the last five seasons, the 26-year-old has appeared in all three pro levels in North America, climbing from the ECHL, to the AHL and then the NHL. The Perth, Ontario native has compiled an 85-48-13 record with 13 shutouts, a 2.44 GAA and .918 SV% in 148 career AHL games with Grand Rapids.\n\nThe 6-6, 220-pound had a 10-game unbeaten streak last season that also included a 145-plus minute shutout streak. Coreau finished last season with a 21-10-5 record, 2.52 GAA and a .913 SV%. Coreau is also a player who remains consistently stellar in the AHL playoffs posting an 18-8 record with one shutout, a 2.66 GAA and a .915 SV% in 26 career postseason games.\n\nRowney, along with newcomer forward Brian Gibbons, have a strong AHL pedigree but are attempting to settle in for another full season in the NHL. Each player chalked up their first full NHL season last year after playing a few years prior in the AHL. All four of these players were not originally drafted, proving hard work pays off.\n\nForward Chase De Leo was acquired in exchange for Nic Kerdiles on June 30 after spending a majority of the last three years with the Manitoba Moose. Prior to his professional career, the 22-year-old was also a champion with the Portland Winterhawks in 2012-13, claiming the Western Hockey League title. A Southern California native, De Leo hails from La Mirada only a few miles outside of Anaheim. Last season, De Leo posted 35 points (12-23=35) in 69 games with the Moose. Manitoba advanced to the playoffs and the former fourth round pick excelled by leading the team with eight points (2-6=8) in nine Calder Cup playoff games. Over a span of 211 career AHL games, De Leo tallied 107 points (45-62=107).\n\nRounding out the Ducks newest additions are forward Anton Rodin, and defenseman Luke Schenn and Andrej Suster. Since being named the Swedish Elite League MVP, Rodin has been injury plagued over the past two seasons. In that time, the 27-year-old has only skated in 10 AHL games and three NHL games but is looking to regain his form and be a mainstay in the NHL. The former second round pick has competed in 121 AHL games dating back to the 2011-12 season with the Chicago Wolves.\n\nSchenn, 28, enters his 11th professional season after being selected fifth overall in the 2008 NHL Entry Draft. The physical defenseman spent the previous two seasons with the Arizona Coyotes and gives the Ducks defensive cores a leadership presence having dressed in over 700 NHL games. Along with the physicality and leadership, size was added with the singing of the 6-foot-7 Sustr. The Plzen, Czech Republic native enters his sixth professional season after playing the previous five with the Tampa Bay Lightning.\n\nThe Gulls inked three new defensemen to AHL contracts this offseason in Chris Forney, Scott Moldenhauer and Terrance Amorosa. Forney, 23, got a taste of AHL experience last season by skating in three games with the Gulls after his collegiate career at UMass-Lowell concluded. The Thief River Falls, Minnesota native enters his first professional season after compiling 49 points (14-25=49) in 135 games with the RiverHawks. Forney tallied career highs in goals and scoring, registering 15 points (4-11=15) in 35 games. During his junior season, he helped the club win a Hockey East championship.\n\nMoldenhauer, 24, turns pro this season after playing the last four seasons under former NHL coach Andy Murray at Western Michigan University. The 6-4, 225-pound defenseman posted 33 points (7-26=33) in 140 career colligate games with the Broncos while serving as an alternate captain his final two sasons. A native of Oak Ridge, North Carolina, he was a four-time Academic All-NCHC selection and three-time NCHC Distinguished Scholar.\n\nAmorosa also begins his pro career after four seasons with the Clarkson Golden Knights amassing 64 points (15-49=64) and a +45 rating in 115 career games. The Kirkland, Quebec native boasted career highs in last season with seven goals, 20 assists, 27 points and a plus-22 rating. Originally selected by the Philadelphia Flyers in the fifth round (132nd overall) of the 2013 NHL Draft, he was named to the ECAC Second All-Star Team after leading the team with seven power-play goals, a +22 rating and all team blueliners in goals. He also led the team in plus/minus each of his final three seasons.\n\n<strong>IN</strong>:\n\nTerrance Amorosa (AHL free agent)\n\nJared Coreau (free agent)\n\nChase De Leo (trade)\n\nChris Forney (AHL free agent)\n\nBrian Gibbons (free agent)\n\nScott Moldenhauer (AHL free agent)\n\nCarter Rowney (free agent)\n\nAnton Rodin (free agent)\n\nLuke Schenn (free agent)\n\nBen Street (free agent)\n\nAndrej Sustr (free agent)\n\n<strong>OUT</strong>:\n\nAssistant Coach Marty Wilford (promoted to Ducks coaching staff)\n\nReto Berra (signed with HC Fribourg-Gottéron)\n\nStu Bickel (unsigned free agent)\n\nJared Boll (retired)\n\nBrian Cooper (signed with Milwaukee Admirals)\n\nLeland Irving (signed with HCB South Tyrol)\n\nNic Kerdiles (traded to Winnipeg Jets)\n\nMike Liambas (signed with Minnesota Wild)\n\nJames Melindy (signed with Newfoundland Growlers)\n\nAustin Ortega (signed with Vaxjo Lakers)\n\nScott Sabourin (unsigned free agent)\n\nJeff Schultz (unsigned free agent)\n\nNext week, we'll update the prospect watch with players entering their first professional season in the organization."
