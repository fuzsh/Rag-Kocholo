        "text": "Distilling a decade as action-packed as the 2010s down to its 25 central figures is a challenge and not the same exercise as trying to identify the decade’s 25 most influential figures.\n\nIf your focus was purely on the influential, you’d almost certainly fall back on a series of default names — NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, NHLPA executive director Donald Fehr and many other front-office movers and shakers. Naturally, you can’t ignore their impact. But at the top of the list, we wanted to emphasize contributions on the ice, where the games actually took place, and less on all the boardroom battles that, for better or worse, unfolded behind the scenes.\n\nBecause let’s face it: Nobody ever paid to watch the league and the players association square off in collective bargaining sessions. Now, once you establish on-ice impact as the starting point, it is hard not to immediately settle on one singular figure who rose above all others in the 2010s:Pittsburgh Penguins center Sidney Crosby.\n\nCrosby began the decade by scoring the Golden Goal for Canada at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. He then captained the Penguins to back-to-back Stanley Cup championships in 2016 and 2017, which made them the first team to accomplish that feat in almost 20 years.\n\nCrosby also remained a central figure in the ongoing conversation about concussion diagnosis, treatment and recovery. In a two-year span that covered the 2011-12 and 2012-13 seasons, Crosby missed 101 games — more than the 63 he played. As he tried to get healthy, there were some genuine concerns Crosby’s career would grind to a halt in the midst of his prime years.\n\nIn the hardware department, Crosby won an Art Ross trophy, two Rocket Richard trophies and two Conn Smythe trophies as playoff MVP.\n\nCollectively, you can endlessly debate the names on the rest of the list, from No. 2 to 25, but it is hard to dispute the person at the top. Here is my colleague Craig Custance with a deeper, longer look at how Crosby was the face of the NHL for the past decade.\n\nAnd now onto the rest of the list:\n\n2. Alex Ovechkin\n\nIf every absorbing narrative requires both a compelling protagonist and antagonist, the Washington Capitals’ Alex Ovechkin neatly fits the bill. Ovechkin made his NHL debut the same year as Crosby and upstaged him by winning the Calder Trophy. During the last decade, Crosby versus Ovechkin remained one of the NHL’s most reliable storylines, with Crosby almost always getting the upper hand. From 2010 on, Ovechkin was the engine who drove the Capitals to four regular-season first-place finishes in the Eastern Conference. All were met with some level of postseason disappointment until the narrative shifted in 2017-18, when the Capitals, said to be past their championship prime, won the Stanley Cup. It’s hard to predict how Ovechkin will be best remembered this past decade — for all those Rocket Richard trophies as the perennial goal-scoring leader, or that giddy celebratory summer, which included an awesome video of him and Nicklas Backstrom, tuxedo-clad, dancing on a barge with the Stanley Cup in front of the Bellagio hotel fountains.\n\n3. Connor McDavid\n\nConnor McDavid arrived on the NHL scene midway through the decade as the Oilers’ No. 1 pick in the 2015 draft, but his presence was already felt and anticipated long before then. In 2012, Hockey Canada granted him “exceptional player status,” which made him eligible for the OHL draft at 15, where he promptly was the No. 1 pick of the Erie Otters and demonstrated, almost from the get-go, he truly was an exceptional talent. Nothing has changed. Three months after his 20th birthday, McDavid won an NHL scoring title and led the Oilers to the playoffs. Twice already his peers have voted him the Ted Lindsay Award winner as the NHL’s top player. McDavid’s ability to get into high gear from a standing start is eye-popping and unparalleled. Every generation or so, someone comes along who is worth the price of admission and can transcend the sport. For this generation, it’s McDavid.\n\n4. Cammi Granato\n\nIn 2009, the Hockey Hall of Fame amended its election procedures to include separate candidates for male and female players, which opened the door the following June for the selections of Cammi Granato and Angela James as the first two female players in the Hall. Nowadays, social media is all about the value of “influencers.” Arguably, there is no greater influencer on the growth of women’s hockey in the United States than Granato, who grew up in a hockey family, played collegiately at Providence and won a gold medal the first time the Olympics showcased female players. Upon retirement, she was part of NBC’s NHL coverage and also provided color commentary on women’s ice hockey at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. She runs an annual summer hockey camp for girls in Chicago and blazed the trail that has nudged the U.S. women’s program to the top of the world. Last month, Granato was hired by the NHL’s expansion team in Seattle as the first female pro scout. She is assisting with a cross-Canada and U.S. barnstorming tour of prominent female players and acting as coach during a critical stage in the evolution of the sport.\n\n5. Gary Bettman\n\nOn one level, Gary Bettman is no different than the players in the league he administers: He had some victories and he had some defeats in this decade. The wins: Negotiating a massive $5.2 billion television contract with Rogers for Canadian national television rights; selling an expansion franchise for $500 million to Bill Foley and then seeing the Vegas Golden Knights establish all kinds of records for expansion teams; overseeing an overall increase in NHL revenue by roughly $2 billion, which was reflected in the salary-cap rising from $56.8 million in 2009-10 to $81.5 million for the current season. The setbacks: The inability to avoid another lockout, the third of his tenure as NHL commissioner, which shortened the 2012-13 season to 48 games; unable to get an agreement with the IOC, which meant that for the first time since 1998, NHL players were not represented at the 2018 Winter Olympics. Lots of good, some bad — and a passing grade overall.\n\n6. Roberto Luongo\n\nTwitter became a thing in 2006, but not until the brilliant, witty and slightly subversive @Strombone1 came along did the NHL have a Twitter voice that resonated so smartly across the platform. Roberto Luongo poked fun at himself, his teammates and the game, usually in a genuinely warm way. In an era when not a lot of athletes want to show their personalities, Luongo was out there, an engaging personality at a time when the game really needed one. Oh, and there were also 239 NHL wins in the decade as well as a gold medal for Canada in 2010 and a trip to the 2011 Stanley Cup final with the Vancouver Canucks.\n\n7. Derek Boogaard\n\nIn spring 2011, Boogaard, long one of the NHL’s most feared tough guys, died of an accidental drug overdose as he tried to combat the pain of a lifetime of throwing punches for a living. Boogaard was one of three players who earned their livings primarily as NHL enforcers — Rick Rypien and Wade Belak were the other two — who died in a four-month span, which drew new attention to thuggery in the game and renewed the call for a fighting ban. As research into CTE gains ever more ground, the three deaths in such a short period of time put increasing pressure on the NHL to make the game safer. Concussion spotters, time in the quiet room and in-game testing for players who’ve been rocked by a hit can all be linked in an irregular line back to three deaths in that eye-opening summer. The activism, spawned by those deaths, is now being championed by former enforcer Daniel Carcillo and others who refuse to let the issue return to the back burner.\n\n8. John McDonough\n\nAfter the Blackhawks’ long-time owner, Bill Wirtz, died in 2007 and his son assumed control of the operation, Rocky Wirtz hired John McDonough away from the Chicago Cubs, installing him as the team’s president and putting him in charge of a radical and much-needed franchise makeover. Under McDonough’s watch, the Blackhawks executed one of the most dramatic turnarounds in professional sports history. Instead of dealing with acres of empty seats, the United Centre is now perpetually sold out. McDonough put the Blackhawks on local TV (something Bill Wirtz refused to do) and brought some of the team’s legendary players back into the fold. But most importantly, the Blackhawks became relevant on the ice again. They won as many Stanley Cup championships in the decade — 2010, 2013 and 2015 — as they did in the previous 84 years of their existence.\n\n9. Patrick Kane\n\nMaybe the oddest Stanley Cup celebration in history occurred on June 9, 2010, when Patrick Kane scored the overtime winner to defeat the Philadelphia Flyers — and no one, apart from Kane, saw the puck go in. So, there was Kane yippee-yahooing as he raced back up the ice and everyone else in the building collectively wondering: What just happened? But sure enough, replays proved Kane’s shot eluded Flyers goalie Michael Leighton to end a 49-year Stanley Cup drought for one of the NHL’s most venerable franchises. Kane was in his third full season by then and was a key figure in all three Blackhawks’ championships in the decade, winning the Conn Smythe in 2013 and averaging a point-a-game in the 2015 triumph. At 5-foot-11 and 177 pounds, Kane also proved that good things do come in small packages and opened the door for a generation of tiny mites, from Johnny Gaudreau to Cole Caulfield, to follow in his footsteps. Kane’s decade wasn’t without controversy, however. He was the target of a 2015 sexual assault investigation in Hamburg, N.Y., where he maintains an offseason home, though no charges were ever brought against him.\n\n10. George McPhee\n\nIn January 2010, George McPhee was in his 13th season as the Capitals’ general manager. That proved to be a good one — the Capitals set a franchise record with 121 points and won the Presidents’ Trophy as the NHL’s top regular-season team. But McPhee’s greatest claim to fame in the decade came after he was appointed the first general manager of the Golden Knights. McPhee took the job on July 13, 2016, hired future Jack Adams trophy-winner Gerard Gallant as his coach and assembled a hockey operations staff that cobbled together a team out of NHL castoffs that won a division crown in its inaugural season and qualified for the 2018 Stanley Cup final — a hither-to unimaginable possibility. Now in Year 3, the Golden Knights continue to be among the top teams.\n\n11. Jaromir Jagr\n\nJaromir Jagr was hockey’s international man of mystery in the past decade. After a 17-year NHL career appeared to grind to a halt after the 2007-08 season with the New York Rangers, Jagr left to play in Russia. After three seasons there, Jagr made it known he was interested in one last NHL hurrah, which actually turned into six last NHL hurrahs. He made stops in Philadelphia, Dallas, Boston, New Jersey, Florida and Calgary before finally returning home to play in Kladno, the Czech team he owns, in 2017-18. If Jagr hadn’t constantly had to deal with injuries in his final year in Calgary, he was in a position to pass Gordie Howe for most games played in the NHL. As it turned out, he finished 34 games short, 1,733 to Howe’s 1,767. Jagr also caught and passed Mark Messier for No. 2 on the all-time NHL scoring list. The only thing delaying his automatic entry in the Hockey Hall of Fame? A player isn’t eligible for selection until three years after he retires. With Jagr, that may not happen anytime soon.\n\n12. Corey Hirsch\n\nIn a Feb. 15, 2017, article for The Players Tribune, Corey Hirsch said he suffered from severe anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and described how, in 1994, he contemplated suicide by planning to drive his sports car off a cliff. Hirsch’s poignant retelling of his personal story opened the door for other hockey players to discuss their own battles with mental health and mental wellness, including a similar heartfelt narrative penned by then-New York Islanders goaltender Robin Lehner for The Athletic. Lehner won the Masterton Trophy in June and made a memorable speech that resonated with athletes and civilians alike, dealing with their own struggles. Lehner made an important and noteworthy distinction: Mentally ill is not the same as mentally weak. Amen to that.\n\n13. Steve Yzerman\n\nAfter Wayne Gretzky stepped aside as Canada’s Olympic general manager, Hockey Canada tabbed Steve Yzerman to run the show in perhaps the most pressure-packed job in history — assembling Canada’s men’s hockey team to play in front of a hometown crowd at the Olympics in Vancouver in 2010. Yzerman made some bold selections — including Drew Doughty, who was just 20 at the time — all of which paid off in a heart-stopping gold-medal win. In May 2010, the Tampa Bay Lightning named Yzerman their sixth general manager, and in his first year in the position, he was a runner-up for the GM of the year award. Yzerman stepped aside in September 2018, but not before handing over to Julien BriseBois a team that recorded 128 points. Under Yzerman’s watch, the Lightning made it to three conference finals (2011, 2016 and 2018) and the Stanley Cup final in 2015.\n\n14. Marc-Andre Fleury\n\nOne of only two goaltenders to win 300-plus games in the decade (the other: Pekka Rinne of the Nashville Predators), Marc-Andre Fleury might have solidified his place on the list with his eight-year run in Pittsburgh, which included two Stanley Cup championships — one as the emergency starter, one as the backup. But then he joined Vegas in the expansion draft and was the single biggest reason for their run to the 2018 Stanley Cup final. Fleury’s sunny disposition and his popularity within the squad makes him the poster boy for what a teammate can contribute off the ice to chemistry.\n\n15. P.K. Subban\n\nP.K. Subban contributed 312 assists in his first 653 games in the 2010s, but arguably his biggest helper was in September 2015 when he committed to raising $10 million over a seven-year span on behalf of the Montreal Children’s Hospital. Nine months later, the decision by Canadiens general manager Marc Bergevin to swap Subban to the Predators for Shea Weber in a one-on-one exchange rocked the hockey world. Subban was the 2013 Norris Trophy winner and a finalist again in 2018 with Nashville before getting shipped off to New Jersey in June. Subban has been an important trailblazer for young black players in both Canada and the United States. Also, noteworthy: Hockey hasn’t had many power couples in the past (Gordie and Colleen Howe; Wayne and Janet Gretzky), but Subban and Lindsey Vonn are shifting attitudes as well. Subban’s outgoing personality, his fashion sense, his philanthropy and his popular television commercials have all made him a larger-than-life personality off the ice; and on the ice, it was a pretty great decade to 400-plus points and counting.\n\n16. Brendan Shanahan\n\nJust a month before the calendar clicked over to 2010, Brendan Shanahan joined the NHL’s front office as the vice president of hockey and business development, but his role soon shifted over to head of the player safety department, which he oversaw until leaving to join the Toronto Maple Leafs as president of hockey operations in April 2014. Under Shanahan’s watch, the Leafs quickly turned the corner, making the playoffs in each of the past three seasons. Most importantly, Shanahan’s leadership and decision-making helped restore some credibility to a franchise that had become something of a laughingstock. Shanahan hired Mike Babcock to coach, resurrected Lou Lamoriello from his old New Jersey Devils days and identified and subsequently hired and promoted Kyle Dubas to Leafs GM.\n\n17. Erik Karlsson\n\nThe swashbuckling face of the Senators, Erik Karlsson won the Norris Trophy in 2012 and 2015 and was one of only two defencemen to score more than 500 points in the decade. He overcame a serious Achilles injury in 2012-13 that limited him to 17 games and his 66 assists in 2015-16 led all players, not just defencemen. In the 2010s, hockey fundamentally changed — and defencemen who weren’t necessarily bruisers or otherwise physically intimidating became the drivers of offence. Karlsson wasn’t just part of a quantum shift in the way the game evolved. He was its driving force.\n\n18. Hayley Wickenheiser\n\nHayley Wickenheiser won a gold medal for Canada on home soil in February 2010 then followed up with another gold in Sochi four years later, when she played with a broken foot and was the flag bearer for the Canadian team in the opening ceremony. But the decade also marked the launch of WickFest — officially the Wickenheiser World Female Hockey Festival — which is in its 10th year and brings together thousands of female players from atom and peewee to bantam and midget ages over two weekends in Calgary for coaching and mentorship. It is now the largest annual gathering of female players in the world. In 2018, she was named assistant director of player personnel for the Toronto Maple Leafs, a month after starting medical school full time in Calgary. Wickenheiser was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame last week, the seventh female player so honored.\n\n19. Ken Holland\n\nAmong current NHL GMs, Ken Holland is both a progressive and a big-picture thinker and his pet project resulted in one of the most positive outcomes of the current decade — the introduction, for the start of the 2015-16 season, of three-on-three overtime. Holland reasoned it would be a vastly entertaining success (and it has been) and it would serve as a fairer way of breaking ties than the shootout, which had become far too great of a factor by mid-decade. The inability to win the roll-of-the-dice shootouts had actually caused teams to miss the playoffs. Holland also championed the introduction of ROW — regulation and overtime wins — as a further, fairer means of breaking ties in the standings. Among NHL innovations, which can be hit and miss and sometimes even have unintended negative consequences, three-on-three overtime is the most universally appealing change of the past 10 years.\n\n20. John Chayka\n\nWhen the Arizona Coyotes appointed John Chayka as general manager on May 5, 2016, replacing Don Maloney, they made history of sorts. Chayka, at 26, became the youngest GM in both NHL and major North American sports history. Chayka had joined the organization the year before with the title assistant GM, analytics, after co-founding and serving as director of hockey operations at Stathletes, Inc. since 2009. The 2010s were the decade when analytics evolved. From its humble beginnings — examining Corsi, and for the really adventurous, Fenwick — to where things stand today, when most teams have entire departments devoted to acquiring and interpreting data as a means of making smarter, better decisions, Chayka paved a path that hundreds of others have followed in a short time.\n\n21. Henrik Lundqvist\n\nWhen people talk about the face of the NHL, they usually cite Crosby, Ovechkin or McDavid. But regular readers of GQ will beg to differ and suggest that the New York Rangers’ goaltender is actually that person — a handsome, chiseled face who can look even more striking with a two-day growth of beard. Henrik Lundqvist makes every NHL best-dressed list. Moreover, he is one of the few players in the sport who crosses over and can seamlessly mingle with athletes and celebrities because he plays in the largest city in North America. But enjoying a profile that extends beyond the hockey universe wouldn’t matter if he wasn’t also No. 3 in wins for the decade.\n\n22. Marie-Philip Poulin\n\nCanada’s national women’s team won Olympic gold in both 2010 and 2014, and both times Marie-Philip Poulin scored the winning goals. The ultimate clutch performer, many — including influential commentator Cassie Campbell-Pascall — believe she is the greatest talent ever to play the game. Poulin played four years at Boston University and graduated as its all-time leading scorer with 181 points in 111 games played. She won a Clarkson Cup with the CWHL’s Montreal team and was the overplayed mainstay of Canada’s 2018 silver-medal Olympic team. At a time when the pool of women’s hockey players has never been deeper, Poulin stood alone at the top of the heap for most of the decade.\n\n23. Donald Fehr\n\nAs with Bettman, there was some good and some bad with Donald Fehr. He joined the NHLPA in an advisory capacity soon after stepping away from his previous job, executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association, but within a short time was running the show, replacing Paul Kelly. Fehr’s almost decade-long presence at the NHLPA’s helm brought much-needed stability to the organization. The fact that the past decade included just one lockout — in 2012-13 — represents close to labor peace for the two usually warring factions. But Fehr neglected to get the NHL’s Olympic participation codified in the CBA, which opened the door for the league to give South Korea a pass in 2018, and the grumbling about escrow, which was happening when he first took over, is still happening today within the rank and file.\n\n24. Darryl Sutter\n\nAmid a lot of criticism that he was yesterday’s man, Darryl Sutter was hired by the Los Angeles Kings on Dec. 20, 2011, when they were foundering at 15-14-4. A surge under Sutter (25-13-11) saw them narrowly qualify for the 2012 playoffs as the Western Conference’s eighth seed. From there, the Kings posted a remarkable 16-4 run, obliterating every comer, and won the Stanley Cup in the most dominating manner. In Sutter’s first full season behind the Kings’ bench, 2012-13, they made it to the Western Conference final, narrowly losing to the champion Blackhawks, and in 2014, they won the Stanley Cup again. In 2015-16, the Kings set a record with 48 regular-season wins. Sutter’s old-school methods don’t always resonate well with everyone, but there is no disputing the results. He did something even Gretzky couldn’t accomplish: Winning not one but two championships in the City of Angels.\n\n25. Evgeni Malkin\n\nOmitted when the NHL published its list of the greatest 100 players of all time, Evgeni Malkin is harder to overlook for his play and presence in the 2010s. Even though he was drafted in the shadow of Ovechkin at No. 2 in 2005, has played his entire career in the shadow of Crosby and had injuries limit him to 578 games thus far in the decade, Malkin produced 661 points in that time, which is still the ninth-highest total of the decade. He cleaned up in 2012 — scoring title, Hart Trophy. He was the yin to Crosby’s yang on the Penguins’ most successful and watchable team of the decade.\n\n(Top photo: Andrew D.
