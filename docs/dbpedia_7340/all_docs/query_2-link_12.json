        "text": "Christian Petersen/Getty Images\n\nThe NHL released the schedule for the 2012-13 season on Saturday night, and there are many important dates for hockey fans to circle on their calendars.\n\nEach team will play 48 games in a 99-day regular season, which will be a grueling sprint to the playoffs for the players and an exciting three months of hockey for fans.\n\nLet's look at the key dates to remember for the new season. To view the full schedule for all 30 NHL teams, click here.\n\nJanuary 19: New Season Begins\n\nThe 2012-13 season will officially begin on Saturday, January 19 with three games scheduled for 3 p.m. ET, including the Los Angeles Kings raising their 2012 Stanley Cup banner before an exciting matchup with the Chicago Blackhawks.\n\nThe league's opening day schedule also includes the Pittsburgh Penguins traveling on the road to play the Philadelphia Flyers, the Toronto Maple Leafs visiting the Montreal Canadiens and the New York Rangers taking on the Boston Bruins.\n\nThere will be 13 games for fans to enjoy on the first day of the season. The Buffalo Sabres, San Jose Sharks, Calgary Flames and the Edmonton Oilers are the only teams that do not have a game on opening day.\n\nFebruary 9: Hockey Day in Canada\n\nOne date that did not change in the NHL's new 48-game schedule is Hockey Day in Canada on February 9.\n\nAll seven Canadian teams will in action on this day, and each game will be broadcast on CBC. Here are the matchups (via Tim Wharnsby of CBC Sports):\n\nHockey Day in Canada is Feb. 9: Edm @ Det, 2 pm ET; Wpg @ Ott, 2 pm ET; Tor @ Mtl, 7 pm ET; Cgy @ Van, 10 pm ET.\n\nâ€” Tim Wharnsby (@WharnsbyCBC) January 13, 2013\n\nFebruary 17: Hockey Day in America\n\nThere are three games scheduled as part of Hockey Day in America on February 17. All three matchups will be broadcast on NBC or the NBC Sports Network.\n\nHere are the matchups:\n\nPittsburgh Penguins at Buffalo Sabres\n\nLos Angeles Kings at Chicago Blackhawks\n\nDetroit Red Wings at Minnesota Wild\n\nApril 3: Trade Deadline\n\nThe trade deadline is usually in February, but with the late start to the season, the final day to make trades before the summer will be April 3.\n\nLast year's trade deadline was pretty quiet, but with teams having the option of buying out players in the summer, we could see a lot of trades on deadline day.\n\nTeams could also make trades to shed salary so they can get under the $64.3 million salary cap ceiling for the 2013-14 season.\n\nThere are five games scheduled on trade deadline day.\n\nApril 27: Regular Season Ends\n\nThe regular season will end on April 27, and there are 13 games on the schedule, including nine matchups between division rivals that could impact the playoff race.\n\nHere are the four best matchups on the season's final day:\n\nSan Jose Sharks at Los Angeles Kings\n\nVancouver Canucks at Edmonton Oilers\n\nBoston Bruins at Washington Capitals\n\nChicago Blackhawks at St. Louis Blues\n\nJust three days after the regular season ends, the playoffs will begin.\n\nApril 29: NHL Draft Lottery\n\nThe NHL draft lottery will undergo some major changes this season. For the first time in the league's history, each of the 14 teams that fail to qualify for the playoffs will participate in the lottery.\n\nTeams with the worst record will have the best chance of winning the No. 1 overall pick.\n\nSince the the 2013 NHL draft is expected to be one of the deepest in years, this will be a very important lottery for teams who struggle this season.\n\nApril 30: 2013 Stanley Cup Playoffs Commence\n\nThe 2013 NHL playoffs will begin on April 30 and the final possible day that Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Final can be played is June 28.\n\nWhen the NHL last played a lockout-shortened season (1994-95), the New Jersey Devils swept the Detroit Red Wings as the fifth seed in the Eastern Conference to win their first Stanley Cup championship in franchise history.\n\nThe last two seasons following a lockout (1994-95 and 2005-06) have included some amazing playoff series with low seeds (the aforementioned Devils and the Edmonton Oilers as an eighth seed in 2005-06) advancing to the Stanley Cup Final.\n\nJune 30: 2013 NHL Draft\n\nThe 2013 NHL draft will take place on Sunday, June 30 at the Prudential Center in New Jersey.\n\nInstead of a normal two-day draft with the first round on one day and then rounds 2-7 the day after, all seven rounds will take place on the same day.\n\nJuly 5: Free Agency Starts\n\nFree agency usually starts off on July 1, which is also Canada Day. With free agency scheduled to begin on July 5, hockey fans will have a whole day to relax with family and friends and not have to spend their Canada Day holiday watching television to get the latest updates."
