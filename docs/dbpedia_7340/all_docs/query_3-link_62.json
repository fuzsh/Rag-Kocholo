        "text": "The 2013 NHL Awards presented a lighter dose of last year's ceremony due to the shortened season, but it wasn't short on big storylines and importance after the two-day show.\n\nWhile the biggest awards—the Hart, Vezina, Norris, Calder and Lindsay Trophies—were handed out on Saturday, we saw plenty of surprises and big-time trophies handed out to some of the NHL's best players on Friday.\n\nBut the biggest action came on Saturday, when the league's MVP, top defenseman, best goalie and more are awarded.\n\nLet's get right to it and break down the winners from the 2013 NHL Awards.\n\nFrank J. Selke Trophy: Jonathan Toews, Chicago Blackhawks\n\nThe 2012-13 Chicago Blackhawks notched some gaudy numbers defensively, and that was the biggest difference-maker for the Selke Trophy as they awarded it to the Hawks captain.\n\nThe award, given to the forward with the best defensive abilities, is a telling point to Chicago's great season. Toews finished plus-28 on the season, the best mark of his career, while his Blackhawks finished first overall in team defense.\n\nToews also won nearly 60 percent of his faceoffs on the year.\n\nHis impact on his team is still on display, if you tune into the 2013 Stanley Cup Final.\n\nJack Adams Award: Paul MacLean, Ottawa Senators\n\nSenators head coach Paul MacLean did a lot with a little this season, and that won him the Jack Adams Award presented to the NHL's coach of the year.\n\nHis Ottawa squad was pegged as one of the NHL's elite heading into the season, but injuries to Norris Trophy winner Erik Karlsson and star forward Jason Spezza left them staggered from the start. That didn't stop him from leading his team to a 25-17-6 record.\n\nMacLean beat out Chicago's Joel Quenneville and Anaheim's Bruce Boudreau, both worthy contenders, for the award.\n\nMacLean's victory here goes to show that the voters take overcoming obstacles into account more than anything. Quenneville can boast the best start-to-finish performance, and Boudreau can say that he did more with less all year. But MacLean lost arguably his two best players to rebound and put together a great season.\n\nGM of the Year Award: Ray Shero, Pittsburgh Penguins\n\nHaving quite possibly the two best players in the world on your roster is enough to win the GM of the Year award, but Penguins general manager Ray Shero did much more than that.\n\nDesperate to give his team a boost at the trade deadline, he grabbed veteran NHL star Jerome Iginla, as well as Brenden Morrow and Jussi Jokinen.\n\nShero also obtained center Brandon Sutter and goalie Tomas Vokoun in the offseason, the latter having played well between the pipes early on in Pittsburgh's playoff run when inserted into the starter's spot.\n\nShero narrowly beat out finalists Bob Murray of Anaheim and Marc Bergevin of Montreal for the award.\n\nLady Byng Memorial Trophy: Martin St. Louis, Tampa Bay Lightning\n\nMartin St. Louis is no stranger to winning the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy, with this being his fourth time notching the award.\n\nSt. Louis beat out Chicago's Patrick Kane and the New York Islanaders' Matt Moulson for the award.\n\nIt was also the third time in four years that he's taken the Lady Byng, with Florida's Brian Campbell taking the award last year. It's given to the player picked to have exhibited the best type of sportsmanship and gentlemanly conduct combined with a high standard of playing ability.\n\nThere's no doubt that St. Louis has been one of the NHL's best players on a consistent basis for the past decade, but his sportsmanship and love for the game and the way it's supposed to be played is admirable.\n\nIt doesn't hurt that he led the NHL in points, either.\n\nKing Clancy Memorial Trophy: Patrice Bergeron, Boston Bruins\n\nThe first of three awards given for service-related work, Bruins star Patrice Bergeron took the King Clancy Trophy.\n\nThe Clancy Trophy is given to an NHL player who best exemplifies leadership qualities both on and off the ice and has made a noteworthy humanitarian contribution in his community.\n\nBergeron is busy preparing for Game 2 of the Stanley Cup Final, but he took time out of that to make a statement on the Bruins' official website.\n\n“It means a lot, it's a huge honor. Obviously, anytime you have the chance to help out the community, it's something that speaks a lot to me and I want to do,” said Bergeron. “Like I said it’s a huge honor, and I'm very happy about it. I like to lead by example and just work as hard as I can on and off the ice and help whoever I can.”\n\nBergeron's \"Patrice's Pals\" program brings hospital patients and young children receiving treatment to home Bruins games for them to watch the games in luxury suites.\n\nNHL Foundation Player Award: Henrik Zetterberg, Detroit Red Wings\n\nThe NHL Foundation Player Award is designated for players who do the most off the ice and in their communities, but that didn't stop one of the sport's top stars from winning it.\n\nNot to be overstated by his hockey prowess, Henrik Zetterberg and his wife, Emma, are all over the place in his community and in outreach projects to poverty-stricken countries including Ethiopia, Guatemala and Nepal.\n\nZetterberg also funds a high school scholarship for one hockey player each year.\n\nThe NHL Foundation will present $25,000 to the Zetterberg Foundation, which will help fund three water stations in Kenya and Ethiopia.\n\nBill Masterton Memorial Trophy: Josh Harding, Minnesota Wild\n\nAlthough not officially noted, the Masterton Trophy is essentially the \"comeback player of the year\" award. It could not have gone to a more fitting player.\n\nThe Minnesota Wild goaltender was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2012, an autoimmune disease that attacks and eats away the protective lining of his nerves and causes them to scar.\n\nHe came back from extensive treatments and a life-threatening injury to return to the ice during the 2012-13 season, posting a 1-1-1 record. Harding beat out Pittsburgh Penguins star Sidney Crosby and Boston Bruins defenseman Adam McQuaid for the award.\n\nWhile no one is arguing that Harding had a better year on ice than his fellow finalists, it can't be appreciated enough that the Wild goalie overcame such a devastating and deadly disease.\n\nMoments like this remind you that hockey is just a game.\n\nMark Messier Leadership Award: Daniel Alfredsson, Ottawa Senators\n\nMark Messier isn't just important enough to put his name on this award, he also gets to pick the winner. And this year, he went with Senators captain Daniel Alfredsson.\n\nThe award is given to the player who shows great leadership qualities to his team, on and off the ice, during the regular season.\n\nAlfredsson was a likely candidate for the award, as he's serving as the NHL's longest-active captain and is already Ottawa's franchise leader in points, games played and assists.\n\nHe's also gotten involved with the Boys and Girls Club outside of his day job, giving back to the community and being a long-time staple in Ottawa as one of the faces of the city.\n\nCalder Memorial Trophy: Jonathan Huberdeau, Florida Panthers\n\nFlorida Panthers star rookie Jonathan Huberdeau took the Calder Memorial Trophy after beating out Chicago's Brandon Saad and Montreal's Brendan Gallagher.\n\nDespite his Panthers finishing last in the NHL with 36 points on the lockout-shortened season, Huberdeau was a bright spot for the team with 14 points and 17 assists in his inaugural campaign. The 20-year-old has been heralded as one of hockey's up-and-coming stars.\n\nHe beat out worthy company as Saad has emerged as a big-time contributor during the Blackhawks' run to the Stanley Cup Final, and Gallagher finished with 28 points and a plus-10 rating on the season.\n\nTed Lindsay Award: Sidney Crosby, Pittsburgh Penguins\n\nPittsburgh star Sidney Crosby edged out Alex Ovechkin and Martin St. Louis to take the Ted Lindsay Award on Saturday.\n\nThe award, given to the NHL's most outstanding player during the regular season, is Crosby's second of his career. Ovechkin, despite not winning it in 2012-13, has picked up three Lindsay Awards in his career.\n\nDespite only playing in 36 games on the season, Crosby finished with 41 assists, second in the league behind St. Louis' 43. He also finished with a plus-26 rating on the year and led the Penguins to the Eastern Conference Final.\n\nVezina Trophy: Sergei Bobrovsky, Columbus Blue Jackets\n\nAfter an epic turnaround season, Blue Jackets' goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky took home the 2012-13 Vezina Trophy awarded to the league's best netminder.\n\nBobrovsky went 21-11-6 on the season for Columbus, who was one of the NHL's worst teams before the lockout-shortened season. They rebounded to nearly make the playoffs, and Bobrovsky was a huge reason why.\n\nJames Norris Memorial Trophy: P.K. Subban, Montreal Canadiens\n\nCanadiens defenseman P.K. Subban took the Norris Trophy as the league's top defenseman after leading his Montreal team to the playoffs in 2012-13.\n\nHe tied atop defenseman with finalist Kris Letang of the Pittsburgh Penguins, both of whom notched 38 points on the year. But it was Minnesota defenseman Ryan Suter who nearly took the Norris from Subban, as Dan Rosen of NHL.com tells us.\n\nSubban staked his claim this season as one of the NHL's premier blue-liners, and he did so by suffocating opposing forwards all season with his strong frame. He also got in on the scoring end of things, notching 11 goals and 27 assists to go along with a plus-12 rating.\n\nHart Memorial Trophy: Alex Ovechkin, Washington Capitals\n\nOvechkin was edged out by Crosby for the Lindsay Trophy, but he got the one that counts most by taking the Hart Memorial Trophy given to the league's MVP.\n\nThe Russian notched his third Hart Trophy in the 48-game season, after winning two consecutive times in 2007-08 and 2008-09. Crosby was gunning for his second Hart, before being barely edged out. It was quite close, as ESPN's Pierre LeBrun points out with a stunning stat.\n\nThe darkhorse candidate was John Tavares of the New York Islanders. The 22-year-old is nowhere near his prime, but put together a breakout season with 47 points and 28 goals.\n\nPerhaps Crosby would've had a better shot if he hadn't missed 12 games, but Ovechkin's NHL-leading 32 regular season goals didn't help his cause."
