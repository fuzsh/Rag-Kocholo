        "text": "College Hockey East was originally named the Western Pennsylvania Intercollegiate Hockey Association (WPIHA), which was organized during a dinner meeting hosted by Carnegie Mellon University at Skibo Hall on March 26, 1971. The meeting was attended by team representatives of the following colleges and universities: Carnegie Mellon University, Duquesne University, Gannon University, Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Penn State University-West, University of Pittsburgh, Saint Vincent College, and Slippery Rock University. Robert W. McCurdy, who then was serving as the Director of Student Activities at Carnegie Mellon, led the meeting with the help of Clifford C. Wise. During that session, the WPIHA was officially founded. McCurdy was elected as the first Commissioner of the league, and Wise was elected the first WPIHA Secretary.\n\nThe league began its first official season of intercollegiate competition in the fall of 1971. There were 8 teams in the league, including Carnegie Mellon, Duquesne, IUP, Penn State West, Pitt, Saint Francis, Saint Vincent, and Slippery Rock. Representatives from Saint Francis had not attended the first organizational meeting, but their team joined the league shortly after its formation. And despite helping found the organization, Gannon College (now Gannon University) did not enter a team in the WPIHA until a few years later.\n\nMcCurdy served as the WPIHA Commissioner for the first three seasons of the association. Sam Orr then commissioned the WPIHA for one season before handing the reigns over to Jack McKinnon, who served as Commissioner from 1975 to 1979. It was during McKinnonâ€™s tenure that the WPIHA officially became the Western Pennsylvania Collegiate Hockey Association (WPCHA) in 1975.\n\nMichael G. Kaleina from Saint Vincent College was elected the fourth Commissioner of the WPCHA in 1979. Kaleina remained the league's Commissioner from 1979 to 2002, spanning 24 years and touching parts of four decades. During that time, the WPCHA and Western Pennsylvania saw its first big growth of college hockey due to the natural maturation of the sport in the region and the subsequent boom following the Stanley Cup championships by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the early 1990s.\n\nRobert Morris College (now Robert Morris University) significantly changed the landscape of collegiate hockey in the region by winning the American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA) Men's Division 3 National Championship in 2002. In turn, this took the profile of the entire WPCHA and its teams from a local level to a broader scale, and the league was ready for a new chapter and expanded horizons.\n\nOn April 21, 2002, the WPCHA was officially renamed to College Hockey East (CHE) in an effort to forge new relationships with a broader scale of colleges and universities beyond the limits of Western Pennsylvania. That same day, the league ushered in new leadership by naming Charles R. Kuzniewski II of Robert Morris College as its fifth Commissioner.\n\nUnder the guidance of Kuzniewski, the league added to its existing teams in Pennsylvania and West Virginia by expanding into eastern Ohio and western New York. And backed by the vision of Associate Commissioner Thomas Harper and IUP Head Coach Sam Kelly, the College Hockey Association (CHA) was formed in 2004 as an extension of the CHE. The sister league offered a place to play for new and developing teams, particularly as smaller schools sought to establish hockey programs and larger schools looked to add more teams within their existing programs.\n\nIn 2005, California University of Pennsylvania (now PennWest University - California) hosted the ACHA Men's Division 3 National Tournament in Pittsburgh, which solidified the national emergence of the CHE in club hockey. In 2006, all CHE members became members of the ACHA at the Division 3 level, and the league was fueled by the vision of Kuzniewski to make the CHE the best collegiate club hockey league in the country.\n\nFrom that point forward, CHE teams annually made appearances in the ACHA Regional and National Tournaments, with at least one CHE team qualifying for the ACHA Men's Division 3 National Tournament every season from 2005 to 2016. That run was highlighted by the rise of the California program as a perennial national title contender, and the Vulcans won the ACHA Men's Division 3 National Championship in 2008.\n\nMany CHE players and coaches also began to garner regional and national honors for their accomplishments, including California's BJ DePaoli as the ACHA D3 National Player of the Year in 2007-08, California's Justin Berger as the ACHA D3 National Coach of the Year in 2010-11, and Robert Morris's Craig Bioni as the ACHA International Select Team Head Coach in 2012-13.\n\nAfter 9 seasons of continuously directing the league to new heights, Kuzniewski passed the torch in 2011 to new Commissioner Daniel J. \"DJ\" Craven, who had played 5 seasons in the CHE with Penn State Behrend while also serving as the team's General Manager. In his two seasons as the CHE's sixth Commissioner, Craven initiated a new revision of the league's by-laws and oversaw the addition of the CHE Select Team, a squad of the CHE's top players that competed against all-star teams from other ACHA Division 3 leagues in a post-season showcase.\n\nThe league welcomed its seventh Commissioner on June 2, 2013, when David L. Fryer, Jr. took the helm. Fryer was already an experienced CHE administrator from various roles with the league, so the organization remained focused on continuing its ascent. As one of his first orders of business, Fryer merged the CHA under the CHE umbrella as a second division of play, and that division affiliated with a new national organization called the College Ice Hockey Association (CIHA). The benefits of that change were immediate, as Pitt-Greenburg captured the first CIHA National Championship in 2014.\n\nWith the assistance of Associate Commissioner Jamison Roth, Fryer also created the CHE's first women's division in the 2013-14 campaign. The CHE adopted four women's teams who chose to withdraw from a different league due to a shared desire to solidify their programs and increase their competitiveness nationally. The CHE was a perfect match for those premier teams, which included California University of Pennsylvania, University of Delaware, Pennsylvania State University, and West Chester University.\n\nTogether, those teams and the CHE set out to grow the sport for female athletes at the collegiate club level in the eastern US. That mission quickly became a reality, as the CHE hosted 10 women's teams at the start of the 2017-18 season, despite the loss of one founding member to a higher division of play. The CHE women's teams were also very competitive nationally, with several teams qualifying each season for the ACHA Women's Division 2 National Tournament and two teams (Penn State and West Chester) advancing to the national championship games in back-to-back seasons in 2014 and 2015.\n\nThe national significance of the CHE was seen again in 2014 when California's BJ DePaoli was inducted into the ACHA Hall of Fame. DePaoli was the first Men's Division 3 player to earn the honor, and he was later accompanied into the select group by long-time CHE contributor Sam Kelly in 2021.\n\nBy the start of the 2015-16 season, the CHE had expanded its collection of men's programs to 20 teams. Therefore, the league was again restructured to include a new, third division of play for the colleges whose men's teams were generally in their infancy, allowing all CHE programs to be in a competitive division of teams with similar profiles.\n\nThe CHE saw several teams come and go through the latter half of the 2010's, mainly due to more leagues forming and maturing throughout the region. Eventually, the third division of men's play was no longer needed, but the CHE continued to take in new programs and strengthen existing programs in all of its divisions. Competition within the league grew to an all-time high, culminating with all three league championship games played on the same day in 2020 needing overtime to determine a winner.\n\nThe global pandemic set in immediately after the 2020 CHE Playoffs, and the impact was strong enough to not hold an official CHE season in 2020-21. Most teams were able to return for 2021-22, and those teams collectively navigated through the season to complete a full slate of games and another competitive year of CHE playoffs. That set the stage for a huge boost to the league for the 2022-23 season, as several new members joined and some teams re-emerged. The M3 division boasted 10 teams, which is the largest it had been in the 21st century. The W2 division grew back to 10 teams, matching its historical high. And the M4 division settled in at 4 teams, 2 of which were not even in existence the prior season.\n\nWith over 50 seasons of existence, College Hockey East is one of the oldest conferences of club hockey programs in the country, and it has unequivocally established itself as one of the top collegiate club hockey leagues in the nation. But the CHE shows no signs of slowing down, as it continues to grow and promote the great game of ice hockey at colleges and universities throughout the eastern United States.\n\nMarch 26, 1971\n\nCarnegie Mellon University, Duquesne University, Gannon University, Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Penn State University-West, the University of Pittsburgh, Saint Vincent College, and Slippery Rock University conduct a dinner meeting at Carnegie Mellon University and form the Western Pennsylvania Intercollegiate Hockey Association (WPIHA). The WPIHA soon became the Western Pennsylvania Collegiate Hockey Association (WPCHA) and eventually was renamed College Hockey East (CHE).\n\nAugust 8, 1979\n\nMichael G. Kaleina is elected as the fourth Commissioner of the WPCHA. Kaleina was originally serving in a management position with the Saint Vincent College hockey team, where he was the representative for the team at the organizational meeting in 1971 that founded the WPIHA. Kaleina would go on to serve as the Commissioner of the league for the next 23 seasons.\n\nMarch 8, 1997\n\nWPCHA-member Penn State University participates in the ACHA Men's Division 2 National Tournament in Jefferson City, MO, marking the first league team ever to compete in a national tournament. Penn State lost in the championship game to Life College, but the national-level accomplishment grabbed the attention of other WPCHA members, leading many other teams into the ACHA. A strong partnership between the CHE and ACHA was formed, benefiting both organizations as the ACHA Men's Division 3 was established in 1999.\n\nApril 10, 1999\n\nThe first all-star game is held in the league's history, taking place at the Island Sports Center on Neville Island in Pittsburgh, PA. The game showcases the top players from around the league and took place after the conclusion of the 1998-99 season. Chuck Kuzniewski, then a manager for the team at Robert Morris College, organizes the event, and Joe Mullen, a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame and a two-time Stanley Cup winner with the Pittsburgh Penguins, conducts a ceremonial opening face-off as an honorary guest at the game.\n\nMarch 9, 2002\n\nThe Robert Morris College Colonials defeat the University of Wyoming in the ACHA Division 3 National Championship Game, 3-2, in Atlanta, GA. The win crowns Robert Morris as National Champions and vaults hockey to the forefront of sports on its suburban-Pittsburgh campus. The school's strong interest in hockey led to their purchase of the nearby Island Sports Center in August 2003 and accompanying formation NCAA Division 1 teams for both men and women.\n\nApril 21, 2002\n\nThe league initiates a massive overhaul during its annual meeting. The organization is renamed \"College Hockey East,\" and Charles R. Kuzniewski II is elected as the new Commissioner. The league then embarks on a new era, creating a logo and by-laws to back its new mission of establishing the CHE as a premier college club league.\n\nJanuary 14, 2006\n\nA skills competition is introduced into the league's All-Star Event at the Cambria County War Memorial in Johnstown, PA. Dave Fryer, who held the title of CHE Special Events Coordinator at the time, designed and conducted the skills competition, which instantly became a fan and player favorite. The competitions included a unique display of skills in contests for fastest skater, rapid fire shooting, puck control relay, and breakaways.\n\nNovember 17, 2006\n\nThe first day of a three-day event called the \"CHE-MET Showdown\" gets underway in Altoona, PA. The event was established by the CHE as a friendly showcase and competition between College Hockey East and the Metropolitan Collegiate Hockey Conference. The Ryder Cup-style event featured four teams from each league, increasing the number of non-league games played between teams in the ACHA D3 Atlantic Region. A scoring system was attached to each game to award points to the competing leagues. The event lasted in its basic form through the 2009, after which it morphed into \"The Classic,\" which was hosted by the ACHA to involve more teams and leagues from the Atlantic Region.\n\nMarch 15, 2008\n\nThe California University of PA Vulcans complete a near-perfect season with a 7-3 victory over San Diego State University in the ACHA Division 3 National Championship game in Rochester, MN. The title earns considerable notoriety in the Pittsburgh region, including several forms of recognition by the Pittsburgh Penguins.\n\nJuly 14, 2013\n\nThe College Hockey Association (CHA) is rebranded as a league under the College Hockey East name. The five existing members of the CHA remain in the league, including Carnegie Mellon University, Case Western Reserve University, California University of PA, Community College of Allegheny County, and University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg. Newcomers Gannon University, Allegheny College, and Wheeling Jesuit University join from an external league, and Saint Francis rejoins the organization after many years of not fielding a team. The league is affiliated with the Collegiate Ice Hockey Association (CIHA) to allow member teams to compete for a national championship.\n\nJuly 17, 2013\n\nEstablished women's hockey teams from California University of PA, the University of Delaware, Penn State University, and West Chester University withdraw from their current league with aspirations to collectively improve their off-ice standards and on-ice competitiveness. College Hockey East creates a women's division for the very first time to give these programs a new home and provide a unified effort towards growing women's hockey in the region.\n\nFebruary 22, 2014\n\nCollege Hockey East crowns its first-ever women's champion in York, PA, as part of a four-team playoff tournament. California University of PA edges Penn State University, 2-1, in a thrilling championship game, completing an overwhelmingly successful first season for the league's newest venture.\n\nApril 5, 2014\n\nThe University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg travels to Newark, OH, for the National Tournament for the Collegiate Ice Hockey Association (CIHA) and defeats the University of California-San Diego, 2-0, to win the CIHA National Championship. The national title is the third of its kind earned by member teams in CHE history.\n\nMay 3, 2014\n\nWilliam \"BJ\" DePaoli is inducted into the ACHA Hall of Fame during a ceremony in Naples, FL. DePaoli was a standout player at the California University of PA, where he amassed 413 points in just 122 games and was the 2008 ACHA Men's Division 3 Player of the Year. DePaoli is the first CHE player to enter the ACHA Hall of Fame.\n\nJune 12, 2017\n\nCollege Hockey East increases its total number of women's teams to ten for just its fifth season with the addition of Mercyhurst University's newly formed women's club team. The rapid growth to 10 women's teams marks a significant milestone in the league's mission to promote women's collegiate club hockey in the eastern USA.\n\nMarch 1, 2020\n\nFor the first time, College Hockey East hosts all of its league championship games on the same day and at the same venue. All three games need overtime to decide a winner, resulting in a total of 7 overtime periods. Cal U of PA won in Men's Division 3 in overtime, Pitt-Greensburg prevailed in Men's Division 4 in triple overtime, and Mercyhurst triumphed in Women's Division 2 in triple overtime.\n\nJune 29, 2021\n\nA second participant of College Hockey East is named to the ACHA Hall of Fame when Sam Kelly is posthumously given the honor. Serving in various leadership roles over a span of 33 years, Kelly was a vital contributor to the IUP program, to the CHE, and to the ACHA. Kelly won 406 games and 4 league championships as the Head Coach at IUP."
