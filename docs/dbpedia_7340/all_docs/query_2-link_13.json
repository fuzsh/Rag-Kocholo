        "text": "Friday marked the start of Ron Hextall’s 69th full day as Penguins general manager. Craig Patrick needed only 34 days. Ray Shero required just 30. And in what now seems like a warning shot, Jim Rutherford waited only 21 days before making his first move.\n\nHextall’s circumstances are different from those of his predecessors. Rutherford and Shero were offseason hires in June 2014 and May 2006, respectively. Hextall and Patrick have a shared experience of being in-season replacements, but Patrick inherited a Penguins team perceived to be on the rise in December 1989, whereas Hextall’s arrival this past February was widely viewed as being handed the keys to a luxury car close to passing inspection for the final time.\n\nExcept, not really … because the expectation remains to win the Stanley Cup. Only for Hextall, the best opportunity might be within his first five months.\n\nPartly, that is due to the unknowns that come with having only nine current regulars under contract after next season. The potential for significant roster changes — including decisions this summer that will probably determine the Pittsburgh futures of Evgeni Malkin, Kris Letang and Bryan Rust — places an extra emphasis on the opportunity to bolster the current Penguins for a deep postseason run.\n\nAnd why wouldn’t Hextall exhaust all options to that end? The Penguins have emerged as one of the NHL’s best clubs since Hextall’s hiring was announced Feb. 9. They were 20-8-1, with a points percentage (P%), goals-for (GF/GP) and goals-against (GA/GP) averages and regulation-wins (RW) total that each ranked in the NHL’s top 10 over that span.\n\nSeems a group worthy of an addition or two for a push over the top. Despite 213 man-games lost to injury as of Friday, the Penguins were positioned to arrive at the trade deadline poised to win their first division title since 2013-14 and with it home-ice advantage through at least the first couple of postseason rounds.\n\nHextall, however, has not sounded as though he was close to a trade of any type, let alone The Big Deals that have become as much a part of Penguins’ Cup runs as series comebacks and Game 7 victories.\n\nThe Big Deals also don’t always work. Trades are risk-reward ventures by their nature, and too much of a good thing is possible.\n\nOr did everybody forget the last time an NHL season was shortened and the Penguins seemed set up for silvery success?\n\nShero’s seventh season with the Penguins was all kinds of weird.\n\nThe 2012-13 season was staged entirely in 2013 because of an offseason labor dispute. Only 48 games were scheduled, all within the conference. Also, the cap did not exist.\n\nThat last note is an especially important — and too-often-forgotten — part of this story. Had the cap not been given a one-season hiatus coming out of the lockout, the Penguins probably would have gone into the 2013 postseason with a roster strikingly similar to the one that had lost an opening-round series to the Flyers in 2012.\n\nThat series stayed with Shero long after it ended. He’s not alone, either.\n\nTo this day, almost every member of the Penguins around to watch their bewildering blowup against the Flyers has few answers for it and too many nightmares about it.\n\n“I don’t have an answer, and I never will,” winger James Neal said a few years ago. “I think if you ask anybody on that team, he’d probably say we should have won the Cup.”\n\nDan Bylsma wouldn’t go quite that far, but only because he had experienced the lows and highs of winning a Game 7 in the Cup Final. His loss as a player and victory as a coach brought a certain clarity when it came to hockey clubs’ fortunes.\n\nOften, the difference comes down to luck. Title teams end up getting good luck at the right time.\n\nAnd that is not to suggest the Penguins were overly lucky in 2009, when Bylsma coached them to the first title of the Crosby Era. Heck, they finished that postseason with Crosby stuck to the bench because of an injury midway through Game 7 of the Cup Final in Detroit. Them winning that game without Crosby speaks somewhat to the suspicions that although everything tends to add up in the end for Cup champions, not all things make sense along the way.\n\nIn January 2013, Bylsma did sense his returning players believed they wasted a Cup chance the previous spring. When a shortened camp opened after the lockout, the coach and his players were speaking the same language.\n\nSpeaking recently to The Athletic, Bylsma, now an assistant coach with the Red Wings, described the Penguins as “having a chip on our shoulders” at the start of 2012-13.\n\n“I think we played with it that whole shortened season,” he said. “We had this burning drive to win a championship because of the way things had gone the past couple of years.”\n\nThe Penguins had amassed the NHL’s third-most points from 2009-10 through 2011-12. Their success was no surprise given their run to the 2008 Cup Final, their Cup win in 2009, and their roster that included centers Sidney Crosby, Malkin and Jordan Staal, Letang, and goalie Marc-Andre Fleury.\n\nThey were young. They had won. The future was theirs to shape.\n\nA second-round loss to the Canadiens in 2010 stung but was not viewed at the time with much negativity. The Penguins had come off consecutive Final appearances and a handful of their players had also played in the Vancouver Olympics. “Our tank was pretty empty,” Crosby said a few years ago of the 2010 postseason loss.\n\nA promising 2010-11 season was forever altered when Crosby was concussed twice by hits in successive games in the opening week of January 2011. He would not play again until November that calendar year and appeared in only 28 games, including the 2012 postseason, from Jan. 6, 2011, until Jan. 19, 2013.\n\nMalkin, because of a right knee with two torn ligaments (sound familiar?), also missed that 2011 postseason. The Penguins lost a Game 7 in the opening round at home, 1-0, to the Lightning. He returned to win a second scoring title and his lone Hart Trophy for 2011-12 and, along with Crosby and Staal, was an offensive force in that 2012 playoff series against the Flyers.\n\nEverything was set up for the Penguins, or so it seemed.\n\n“We got parked over,” Shero said of a 2012 opening-round loss to Flyers, who outscored the Penguins, 32-24, after falling behind 3-0 before rallying to an overtime win of Game 1 in Pittsburgh.\n\n“So you go into that (2012) offseason, and you’re thinking you had a really good team, but now there’s all these questions.”\n\nShero sought a backup goalie who could take over for Fleury if another postseason series started going sideways. He found that in veteran Tomas Vokoun, who — as fate would have it — supplanted Fleury as the starter after only four games in the 2013 playoffs.\n\nShero didn’t do much else during the 2012 offseason other than bringing in Vokoun. Had the 2012-13 season started on time and with a cap, he probably wouldn’t have done much else during that season, barring injuries. He, too, was aware that returning players sensed a rare championship opportunity had been wasted in the 2012 playoffs; the Penguins’ collective motivation to vindicate themselves was viewed internally as a valuable intangible.\n\nBut when October and November came and went without the NHL returning in 2012, Shero had time — maybe too much time? — to rethink that galling postseason loss to the Flyers. The more he thought about it, the more he felt unsure of what exactly he was bringing back to Pittsburgh when the lockout ended.\n\nBelieve it or not, the biggest question he began to ask was one he could barely bring himself to say. Shero wondered: “What are we going to get from Sid?”\n\nCrosby’s concussions saga when combined with the lockout essentially limited the NHL’s dominant player to playing games in only five weeks during a 24-month span prior to the league’s return in January 2013. Neither Shero nor Bylsma could interact with Crosby during the lockout, even though Crosby had joined most teammates in Pittsburgh for player-run on-ice workouts.\n\n“Look, he’s the best player in the world when he gets that concussion, it’s not even close how great he is, and you know he’s pushing himself to come back and be Sidney Crosby whenever we start playing games,” Shero said. “He’s literally skating with our guys where we practice, but I can’t be there, I can’t see — none of us can. You’re hearing, ‘Sid looks great.’ Really? That’s fucking awesome. But you’d like to see for yourself.\n\n“Asking any player to miss that much time and just be dropped into a short season — that’s not fair. Even for Sid. Of course, we start that season in January, and within a couple weeks it’s fucking obvious: ‘Sid’s back!’\n\n“Again, you’re feeling good about your team. But what am I supposed to do — just forget what happened in those seasons?”\n\nCrosby’s concussion. Malkin’s knee injury. The carried-over memories of how the Penguins’ bad luck with injuries somewhat shaped disappointing 2011 and 2012 postseasons. Trading Staal, and thus losing the depth advantage and grit he provided, the previous offseason.\n\nThere was a lot for Shero to mull as the lockout stretched into late 2012. Even as he watched Bylsma preside over the Penguins’ return to dominance six weeks into the shortened 2012-13 season, Shero was stuck on what could happen at any minute.\n\nA bad bounce. A bad break. The infamous bad luck that followed the star-crossed Penguins, who in January 2013 had won the Cup three times and been through bankruptcy twice.\n\nAny other season, an injury or two to a couple of their stars would doom the Penguins to a long summer. That’s how life worked for cap clubs.\n\nThe 2012-13 season could be different. There was no cap. And even though his stars were healthy, his captain again ruling the NHL, and his club was at the beginning of what would become an undefeated March, Shero was not about to leave anything to chance.\n\nAside from dealing away defenseman Ben Lovejoy and winger Eric Tangradi, neither of whom fit into the current or future plans other than as extras, Shero had not tinkered with the 2012-13 Penguins all that much before March 24 of that season. Coincidentally, the Penguins downed the Flyers in overtime that night to stretch a winning streak to 12 games. As that victory was being procured, Shero closed a deal with the Stars to add veteran winger Brendan Morrow.\n\n“Ray talked to me about things he might be able to do,” Bylsma said. “With Morrow, it was insurance. He wasn’t coming in to be a top-six winger. I couldn’t say that night if we liked him for the third or fourth line, just somewhere on one of those lines — and insurance in case we needed somebody to play with Sid or Malkin.\n\n“Morrow did bring some of that element you lost with Jordan. He made us a harder team to play against. I’d say abrasive more than toughness. I always thought our players didn’t get enough credit for being tough; our stars would play through anything they could, physically. But Morrow was — let’s just say he had a different style, something Ray was looking for, and I agreed with him.”\n\nHad he only added Morrow, there would be no lingering criticism of Shero now about his dealings during the 2012-13 season.\n\nShero didn’t stop at Morrow. He was the first of four players acquired over 11 days before the 2013 trade deadline. And while each acquisition filled a presumed want, only the last player added actually filled a need.\n\nThat player was forward Jussi Jokinen, whom Shero plucked from Rutherford’s Hurricanes on April 3. By that point, the Penguins of Crosby and Malkin improbably needed a center despite their position atop the Eastern Conference.\n\nWell, perhaps not improbably.\n\n“Sid and Malkin were hurt,” Shero said of trade deadline day 2013. “They weren’t when we got Morrow. What was it, two weeks later and they’re hurt? Are you kidding me? After everything those other seasons, now we need to get somebody that can play center? It’s fucking unbelievable.”\n\nNot really.\n\nOnly because by the time Jokinen had joined the Penguins, Shero had also added a defenseman nicknamed “Crankshaft” (Douglas Murray) and arranged for a match seemingly made for hockey heaven — pairing winger and Canadian treasure Jarome Iginla with Crosby, a Canadian icon for scoring the golden goal at the 2010 Vancouver Games — only to quickly watch it all go to hell.\n\nUp until Crosby’s jaw was pulverized by an errant puck early in a game against the Islanders on March 30, the trade deadline appeared to have already been won by Shero.\n\nThe Cup, too, or so many had predicted.\n\nIginla checked all the boxes. He was skilled. He was physical. He was a leader. He was a veteran without a Cup. He had experience playing with Crosby (they were linemates during the 2010 Olympics). He had an expiring contract.\n\nShero saw no downside to swooping in early the morning of March 27 to call Jay Feaster, then the Flames GM, to inquire about television reports that Iginla was headed to the Bruins. Shero asked for the lowdown. Feaster told him no deal between the Flames and Bruins was in place. With an hour or so, a deal between the Flames and Penguins was completed.\n\nTo add a living legend to a team led by a couple of generational superstars in their prime, Shero sent wingers Kenny Agostino and Ben Hanowski and a 2013 first-round pick to the Flames. A pittance to pay for a chance at the Cup, or so the thinking went in most parts of the hockey world. A few months after the deal, Shero was voted GM of the Year.\n\nMore than any of the others he made in 2012-13, this one sent a message to the NHL. Shero and the Penguins were all-in to win it all. He didn’t then nor does he now deny that being the approach.\n\n“The first thing I said after the lockout was I wanted to re-sign Malkin and Letang that summer,” Shero said. “I wasn’t looking to bring in guys with contracts. We didn’t, except for Jokinen, and Carolina retained some of his cap (hit).\n\n“We’ve got this group. It’s a good group. It’s a group that wants to win, that we think can win, and there’s no cap. So, yeah, we’re going for it. It wasn’t any different from the other seasons when I was there. We always went for it. But I think because it was so many guys in however many days and Jarome was that guy that year, it became a bigger deal. But you tell me how getting Jarome that year was different from getting (Marian) Hossa.”\n\nThere’s one way, anyway.\n\nHossa, also the big fish GMs were trying to reel in at the 2008 deadline, was ticketed to play on Crosby’s line upon arriving in Pittsburgh.\n\nIginla might have been ticketed for the Hockey Hall of Fame, but he held no such pass to play with Crosby.\n\nThe reason was obvious only inside the Penguins dressing room. The reason was Pascal Dupuis.\n\nBylsma never considered swapping Dupuis for Iginla on Crosby’s line. Beloved and respected, but also prideful, Dupuis was the rare player with freedom to smack-talk Crosby, prank Fleury, mock Malkin and let loose on Letang. If the Penguins were Crosby’s club, the room was marshaled by Dupuis.\n\nThat Dupuis meshed well on the ice with Crosby and left winger Chris Kunitz was one thing for Bylsma to consider when assessing where a veteran of Iginla’s stature should play. What playing him over Dupuis could do to team chemistry that had become a stabilizing strength for the Penguins in 2012-13 was another.\n\n“All that stuff about getting Iginla to play with Crosby — I can tell you that was never discussed with Jarome,” Shero said. “It wasn’t, ‘You’re coming to Pittsburgh to play with Sid.’ It was, ‘You’re coming to Pittsburgh to play for the Penguins.’ And he said he was fine with that. So that’s all I ever thought about it.\n\n“I don’t think Jarome had a problem. You’d have to ask Dan.”\n\nBylsma declined to comment on specifics of his original plan for Iginla but did concede that the acquisition forced “hard conversations with guys about where they’d play.” Probably best to not read into Iginla being one of those guys.\n\nNeal likely was, though. He had moved from left to right wing in his first full season and become entrenched in that spot on Malkin’s line — also as the primary shooter on the top power play.\n\nNeal had scored 26 power-play goals from the start of 2011-12 until Iginla’s debut with the Penguins on March 30, 2013. While teammates said Neal never complained of moving to left wing so Iginla could play his natural position on Malkin’s line, Malkin is known to not have supported finding room on the top power play for Iginla at Neal’s expense.\n\nWhen considering Dupuis’ rank among team leaders, Crosby’s comfort with Kunitz and Dupuis as his wingers, and Malkin’s loyalty to Neal, Bylsma had to weigh working Iginla into the dynamic of a Penguins club running roughshod over its conference. If Morrow had been insurance, Iginla represented the potential for ripping at a fabric that, until he arrived, seemed to be sewn with steel wool.\n\nHow could anybody look Iginla in the eye and make a case for him to play on a third line? Bylsma was going to find out.\n\nBefore he could, circumstances conspired against him and the Penguins.\n\nThe puck that crushed Crosby’s jaw. The injury to Malkin. Each coincided with the dealing spree executed by Shero. Subtracting heart-and-soul former MVPs, in Crosby and Malkin, from an evolving dynamic that included Iginla and Morrow, a couple of former captains of other clubs, had the Penguins in a neither-fish-nor-fowl situation. And that was no way to embark upon a Cup chase, especially with nobody knowing what could be expected of Crosby.\n\n“I visited him the next day in the hospital, and it wasn’t great,” Bylsma said of Crosby’s jaw injury, which occurred in Iginla’s debut with the Penguins. “You’re talking about a brutal injury — he’s drinking food through a straw — on the heels of a bad head injury with the concussions. It was just a difficult time for him. You’re worried about him as a person, not what he can do for the team.”\n\nNeither Bylsma nor Shero said the experiment of adding multiple veterans to a close-knit group would have gone better had Crosby, their ill-fated captain, been able to work his unique follow-by-example leadership between the trade deadline expiration and the start of the postseason in 2012-13. But they would have liked to see Crosby get the opportunity to try.\n\nInstead, he and the Penguins somehow managed to end up disappointing themselves all over again in the 2013 postseason. Even though they matched their total of series wins from the prior three postseasons and reached the conference final, being swept in it by the Bruins turned hovering clouds into a storm front.\n\nOnly Jokinen was with the Penguins by the 2013-14 season. A division title and Crosby’s second Art Ross/Hart Trophy season became footnotes to a history-making postseason; the Penguins’ second-round collapse against the Rangers left them with only four series wins since their 2009 Cup victory, and Shero and Bylsma were fired in the offseason.\n\nIn those early-morning moments when he sealed the deal to bring Iginla to Pittsburgh, Shero could not possibly have envisioned what would happen in the ensuing days, weeks and months of that 2012-13 season — let alone how it all might contribute to a changing of the guard within 14 months. Not that he regrets getting Iggy with it for the Penguins.\n\nNot even close.\n\n“We were out in the first round the two years before, then we were playing Boston in the conference final,” Shero said. “Did I want more? No shit. But that doesn’t mean I wouldn’t do it all again, because we were one of the last four teams.”\n\nThe question that haunts many with those Penguins is how things might have gone had Shero left them alone.\n\n“What I think about that year, looking back, is that we were two different teams, and both were really good,” Bylsma said. “We were this team with Sid setting the tone and we’re on top of teams and attacking. Sid’s jaw, Malkin gets hurt, and when they’re out we start grinding out wins over that last month, and we’re leaning a lot on veterans — our own guys, like Kunitz, but also some of the new guys, especially Jarome, who was better for us, including in the playoffs, than I guess people like to remember.\n\n“That chip was always on our shoulder. I don’t think it disappeared. But the team we ended up having in the playoffs, when Sid and Malkin are back, wasn’t the same team as we had before. I think that’s why maybe you’ll find guys who were part of it say things changed on us.\n\n“It felt like two different years.”\n\n(Top photo: Ronald C. Modra / Getty Images)"
