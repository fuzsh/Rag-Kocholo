        "text": "History lesson: In the year of 1917, Russia was in political distress. The October revolution had resulted into the Bolsheviks taking over the country from the provisional government, which itself had overthrown Tsar Nicholas II in the same year. The Finnish government at the time recognized that this was an opportunity where the country could gain independence. After all, the sense of Finnish nationalism had grown strongly in the 19th century. The idea eventually materialized and in 4th of December 1917, the Finnish government structured the Declaration of Independence, which was approved in voting on the 6th of December 1917. On the same date in 2017, Finland is celebrating it’s 100th birthday and in order to celebrate this once-in-a-lifetime occasion, we — on this hockey related blog — decided to put in order the 100 greatest Finnish NHL players of all time.\n\nEnjoy.\n\n100.

Jussi Jokinen W,C\n\nThe Swiss army knife of NHL players, Jussi Jokinen was an all-around player who represented several teams in his career. Jokinen started his career in Dallas after the 2005–04 lockout and scored 55 points right away. Jokinen showed promise, but he couldn’t quite reproduce the points of his rookie season until 5 years later in Carolina, where he scored 30 goals and 65 points. In Carolina Jokinen had his best years, but a slow start to the 2012–13 seasons resulted into him being traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins.

Tuukka Rask G\n\nThe first years of Tuukka Rask’s career was spent backing up Tim Thomas with the Boston Bruins. However, this spoke more to the goodness of Thomas than to that of Rask. When Thomas eventually retired, Rask — much like was expected — established himself as a new starter for the Bruins and as an elite goaltender in the NHL. This was certified in 2014, when Rask was awarded the Vezina trophy for being the best goaltender in the NHL that season. In 2017 Rask played in the NHL All-Star game. He is also a Stanley Cup Champion from 2011, backing up Thomas in that run.\n\nAchievements:\n\n411 GP, 209 Wins, 39 shotouts\n\nStanley Cup Champion (2011)\n\nVezina Trophy (2014)\n\nNHL All-Star game (2017)\n\n13. Pekka Rinne G\n\nOriginally, Pekka Rinne was drafted based on a warm up in the Finnish league. He was backing up Nicklas Backström and the scouts had to settle for what they saw in the pre-game show. It was impressive enough for the Nashville Predators to take a flier at him at the 8th round of the 2004 NHL entry draft. It turned out to be the biggest draft steal in the organisation’s history. In the 2007–08 season, Rinne would establish himself as the starter, a position he is still holding a decade later. In his unlikely career, he has been nominated for the Vezina Trophy on 3 separate occasions, finishing second in 2011 and in 2015. In the 2017 NHL playoffs, Rinne was one of the biggest reasons why Nashville made the Stanley Cup finals finals. He posted a save percentage of 93.0 from the spring. Rinne leads all the Finnish goalies in shotouts.\n\nAchievements:\n\n530 GP, 285 Wins, 45 shotouts\n\n2 NHL All-Star games\n\n12. Reijo Ruotsalainen D\n\nReijo Ruotsalainen didn’t have the longest NHL career, but he made the most of his short time in the league. Known as a smooth skating offensive defenseman, Ruotsalainen was often the one pacing the game, this was in a time when it wasn’t in the mainstream for a defenseman like it is nowadays. As a more of an attacking type of defeseman, he often was participating in the attack as an extra forward. This resulted in 5 55+ point seasons. Besides racking up points, Ruotsalainen also won the Stanley Cup on two separate occasions, first with the Oilers in 1987 and second time with the Rangers in 1990.\n\nAchievements:\n\n446 GP, 344 Points (107+237)\n\n2 Time Stanley Cup Champion (1987, 1990)\n\nNHL All-Star game (1986)\n\n11. Jyrki Lumme D\n\nA Montreal Canadiens draft pick from the 1986 draft, Jyrki Lumme made a name for himself with his offensive game. He started in Montreal, but it didn’t last for too long as he was traded to the Vancouver Ganucks just a couple of seasons into his career. As a total he played 9 seasons with them and it is where he spent the best years of his career. Between the years 1991 and 1996, Lumme had 4 straight over 40 point seasons, the lockout year of 1994–95 excluded. In the year of 1994, Lumme also made the Stanley Cup finals with the Ganucks, but they were defeated in seven games by the New York Rangers.

Lumme retired from the NHL in 2003, after having played 985 games and scored 468 points.\n\nAchievements:\n\n985 GP, 468 Points (114+354)\n\n10. Mikko Koivu C\n\nOne of the few Finnish players who has spent their entire career — thus far — with one organisation is Mikko Koivu. He was drafted by the Minnesota Wild 6th overall in 2001, 16 years and 816 games later he is the team captain, a position he has held since 2009. He shares a lot of similarities with his bother Saku, who will be introduced later in the list. He too is a long time team captain; he is not regarded as a point scoring forward in spite of recording 3 over 60 point seasons, he is rather a strong two-way presence; Koivu was nominated for the Selke Trophy, which is awarded for the best defensive forward, in 2017.\n\nAchievements:\n\n870 GP, 629 Points (183+446)\n\nNHL All-Star game ((2012) invited, didn’t play)\n\n9. Jere Lehtinen W\n\nBesides Koivu, another Finn who spent all of his time in the NHL with one team is Jere Lehtinen, who only played for the Dallas Stars. Lehtinen was drafted when the organisation was still in Minnesota, but when he come over to North America, they had already moved to Dallas. In his career Lehtinen never made a name for himself as an offensive powerhouse, but rather, he had a knack for the defensive game, in spite of being a winger. This is the role he played for Dallas throughout his career. It’s a role he played well, winning the Selke trophy 3 times. Only Bob Gainey and Patrice Bergeron have more Selke trophys to their name. In spite of playing a lengthy NHL career (14 seasons), Lehtinen’s time was riddled with injuries and thus he only played a total of 875 games in the league. Lehtinen won the Stanley Cup with the Stars in 1999, and had his number (26) retired by the organisation in 2017.\n\nAchievements:\n\n875 GP, 514 Points (243+271)\n\nStanley Cup Champion (1999)\n\n3 time Selke Trophy winner (1998, 1999, 2003)\n\nNumber retired by the Dallas Stars\n\n8. Esa Tikkanen W\n\nThroughout his career Esa Tikkanen become known as one the hockey’s finest agitators; Constantly getting under opponents skins and chirping them with his so-called “Tiki-Talk”. It was a language only Tikkanen could understand. The meaning of his message was never clear to his opponents; for them, the only thing that they saw was Tikkanen constantly yapping at them. It famously drove Wayne Gretzky nuts when he was with the Kings. Besides yapping, Tikkanen also could score points and perform under pressure. He scored 70 points 3 times and had 3 more seasons where he scored over 60 points. In the Stanley Cup winning dynasty of the Edmonton Oilers, Tikkanen was a plaoff performer: In the Playoffs of 1988, 1989, 1990 and 1991 Tikkanen scored a combined 75 points in just 66 games.\n\nAchievements:\n\n877 GP, 630 Points (244+385)4 Time Stanley Cup Champion (1987, 1988, 1990, 1994)\n\n7. Olli Jokinen C\n\nOlli Jokinen is somewhat of a divisive figure in Finnish hockey-circles due to reported attitude problems, off-ice antics and negative feedback from former teammates. How much of this is true and how much is false is a conversation for another day, what we ought to recognize amids the banter, is that Olli Jokinen is one of the best Finnish NHL-players of all time. Amidst the Finns, Jokinen sits 3rd alltime in goals and 4th alltime in points. In games played he is also 4th. Most of the goals and points were scored with the Florida Panters, the team where Jokinen found himself as a hockey player, putting behind the struggles he had with the New York Islanders and the Los Angeles Kings. His time in Florida includes 4 30+ goal seasons. In 2003 Jokinen participated in the NHL All-Star game as a member of the Panthers. In the franchise’s history Jokinen is the all time leader in both goals and points.\n\nAchievements:\n\n1231 GP, 750 Points (321+429)\n\nNHL All-Star game (2002–2003)\n\n6. Kimmo Timonen D\n\nA diminutive defenseman, Kimmo Timonen paved way to small, skilled defensensemen in the NHL. He was selected by the Los Angeles Kings in the 1993, but he never gained the organisations’s vote of confidence and as a result he never got signed. Later, he found a team with Nashville Predators, who had just entered the NHL and were looking for players. Timonen started establishing himself in the organisation and after the change of the millennium he was the most important defenseman in the team. It was that way until 2007, when he signed with the Philadelphia Flyers. With them, Timonen made the Stanley Cup finals in 2010, but his team lost to the Chicago Blackhawks. Ironically, Timonen would later won the Cup with the Hawks in 2015, and retired after that victory.\n\nAchievements:\n\n1108 GP, 571 Points (117+454)\n\nStanley Cup Champion (2015)\n\n3 NHL All-Star games\n\n5. Miikka Kiprusoff G\n\nAt one point Mikka Kiprusoff’s NHL career looked unlikely. In San Jose he was stuck behind Evgeni Nabokov and Vesa Toskala. It was when he was traded to Calgary that his career took flight. In the same season he had struggled in San Jose, but in Calgary he was an instant success, and lead the Flames to the Stanley Cup Finals on that season. It was that season where he established himself as the number one goalie for the Flames for the foreseeable future. He was a workhorse for the Flames. Starting from 05–06 season, he played 7 consecutive seasons where he would start 70+ games. He played well, too, and was awarded the Vezina trophy in the 2005–2006 season, becoming the first Finnish goalie to achieve the honor.\n\nAchievements:\n\n623 GP, 319 Wins, 44 Shotouts\n\nNHL All-Star Game (2006)\n\nVezina Trophy (2006)\n\nJennish Trophy (2006)\n\n4. Teppo Numminen D\n\nWhen discussing the great Finnish players Teppo Numminen always seems to go unmentioned being behind the top 3. This shouldn’t be the case as Numminen is the best Finnish defenseman of all time. No other Finnish defender has played more games or scored more points in the league as Numminen has. “Repo man” made his name with the Winnipeg Jets and then later the Phoenix Coyotes. As a total he played 15 seasons for the franchise. In this time he was arguably their most important defenseman, racking up big points season to season. His loyalty to the team led to his jersey retirement in 2010, joining only Teemu Selänne, Jari Kurri and Jere Lehtinen who have had the same honor.\n\nAchievements:\n\n1372 GP, 637 Points (117+520)\n\n3 NHL All-Star Games\n\nNumber retired by the Arizona Coyotes\n\n3. Saku Koivu C\n\nThe center Saku Koivu always faced his size as his biggest obstacle in his career. Luckily for Koivu, what he lacked in size was made up in heart and skill. This encouraged the Montreal Canadiens to draft him with their 21st overall pick in 1993. The pick turned good for them as Koivu would go on to captain the franchise for a decade. A loved figure in Montreal, evidenced by the standing ovation he received when returning from cancer in 2002.\n\nKoivu would later part ways with Montreal in order to play in Anaheim with his good friend Teemu Selänne, with whom he had develop a chemistry in the Finnish national team. Anaheim would be the last team that he played for as he retired in the same year as Selänne. The ten years he spent as a captain is an all time Finnish record.\n\nAchievements:\n\n1124 GP, 832 Points (255+577)\n\nNHL All-Star Game (1997)\n\nBill Masterton Trophy (2002)\n\nKing Clancy Trophy (2008)\n\n2. Jari Kurri W\n\nWayne Gretzky’s right hand man, Jari Kurri was one of the few who could keep up with the best player of all time. His records speak for themselves: he has recorded 10 consecutive 30 goal seasons from 1980 to 1990. His all time point record is 135 from the 1984–85 season, his goal record is 71 from the same season, a number reached only by 6 other players from one season. A member of the Oilers’ dynasty, Kurri played a crucial role for the team. After all of the glory with the Oilers, Kurri — like Gretzky — was traded to Los Angeles. There he continued to play well and went to the Stanley Cup finals with the team in 1992–93 season. After 5 seasons with the Kings, Kurri went to have short, one season visits with New York, Anaheim and Colorado. As Kurri retired, he was the leading Finnish player in goals and points out of all the Finnish players, eventually passed only by Teemu Selänne. He is a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame and his jersey has been retired by the Edmonton Oilers.\n\nAchievements:\n\n1251 GP, 1398 Points (601+797)\n\n5 time Stanley Cup champion (1984, 1985, 1987, 1988, 1990)\n\nHockey Hall of fame (inducted 2001)\n\n9 NHL All-Star Gmes\n\nGoal scoring title (1986)\n\nLady Byng Trophy (1985)\n\nNumber retired by the Edmonton Oilers\n\nTeemu Selänne W\n\nThe greatest Finnish hockey player of all time, Teemu Selänne,”the Finnish Flash” . To say that Selänne made wawes in his first season would be an understatement. His rookie season with the Winnipeg Jets resulted into 76 goals, a total which won’t be seen again from a rookie. From Winnipeg he was traded to Anaheim, which was to be his home in North America. With the then Mighty Ducks, Selänne formed one of the deadliest duos in the NHL with Paul Karya. After 6 years in California, Selänne had short visits in San Jose and Colorado, but they were troubled by increased knee injuries, which threatened to cut Selänne’s career short. The estimate at the time was a couple of more years, tops. After the lockout of 04–05, he returned to Anaheim. Perhaps it was the warming Californian sun or something completely different, but the knee injuries never returned and Selänne went on to have a productive run of seasons. He won the Stanley Cup with Anaheim in 2007 and retired in 2014. Selänne scored 684 goals during his career, which ranks him 11th all-time. He got his number (8) retired by the Ducks in 2015 and he was inducted to the Hockey Hall of Fame in the 2017 class.\n\nAchievements:\n\n1451 GP, 1457 Points (684+773)\n\nStanley Cup Champion (2007)\n\nHockey Hall of Fame (inducted 2017)\n\n11 NHL All-Star Games\n\nCalder Trophy winner (1993)\n\n3 Time Maurice Rocket Richard Trophy winner (1993, 1998, 1999)\n\nBill Masterton Trophy winner (2006)\n\nNumber retired by the Anaheim Ducks\n\nStats and information for this article can be found from the following sources:"
