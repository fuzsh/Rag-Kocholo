        "text": "Birth of the Rangers\n\nIt might seem hard to believe, but the New York Rangers were once an NHL expansion team.\n\nThe year was 1926, and hockey was already a popular sport at Madison Square Garden â only the team of choice was not yet the Blueshirts. Back then, another NHL squad, the old New York Americans, were drawing big crowds in their first season at The Garden.\n\nThe Americans, who wore stars-and-stripes jerseys patterned after the American flag, proved that MSG was a perfect venue for hockey. Garden President George Lewis âTexâ Rickard came to realize that the time was ripe for a second New York hockey team â one owned and operated by The Garden itself. Working with the league, Rickard managed to secure a team for the 1926-27 season.\n\nRickard knew he had to put a strong team on the ice to compete with the Americans and win over the loyalty of New Yorkers just discovering hockey. To assemble this team, he convinced one of the brightest minds in hockey, Conn Smythe, to leave his post at the University of Toronto. Rickard encouraged Smythe to travel throughout North America in search of the most talented âundiscoveredâ players he could find.\n\nSmythe ended up laying the groundwork for a team that was instantly a Stanley Cup contender. In the course of one summer, he found future Hall of Fame forwards Frank Boucher, Bill Cook, and Bun Cook, Hall of Fame defenseman Ivan âChingâ Johnson, and winger Murray Murdoch, who would become hockeyâs first âIron Manâ by playing 508 consecutive games.\n\nAs Smythe was out signing players, sportswriters back in New York began referring to the team as âTexâs Rangersâ. The name stuck, and Rickard formally adopted it â stripping the word âRangersâ diagonally across the front of a blue jersey to make his team stand out from the Americans, whose name was displayed horizontally on the playersâ jerseys.\n\nBefore the start of the 1926-27 season, Smythe left the team he had built as a result of disagreements with Garden management. Rickard looked west to British Columbia, where he found one of hockeyâs great pioneers in Lester Patrick. Although Smythe had put the majority of the roster together, it was Patrick who would mold it into a championship team.\n\nPatrick, who would become nicknamed âThe Silver Foxâ, was the face of the Rangers for the franchiseâs first two decades of existence. Serving as the teamâs Head Coach and General Manager (as well as a player during the 1928 Stanley Cup Finals), Patrick not only guided the Rangers to an extended period of success, he introduced the game of ice hockey to New Yorkers. Through his relationship with prominent sportswriters, Patrickâs chats and lessons on the game helped readers become accustomed to the new game, and the Rangers would soon be the favorite hockey team among New Yorkers.\n\nWith Patrick leading a group of future Hall of Fame players, the Rangers immediately established themselves as a formidable hockey team in New York, and as a result, they quickly surpassed the Americans in both the NHL standings and popularity. They finished their first season with the best record in the American Division, and team captain Bill Cook led the league with 33 goals and 37 points.\n\nThe following year, they won the first of the franchiseâs four Stanley Cup championships, defeating the Montreal Maroons, three-games-to-two. The seriesâ defining moment came in Game 2. After the Rangers lost Game 1, goaltender Lorne Chabot suffered an injury that forced him to leave the contest. When the Maroons refused to let Patrick use their emergency goaltender to finish the game, the 44-year-old Head Coach put on the goalie gear and inserted himself into the net. Patrick only allowed one goal for the rest of the game, helping the Rangers win the game in overtime and eventually the Stanley Cup.\n\nSince the Rangers pulled off their remarkable feat in 1928, no other NHL team has ever won the Cup in its first two years of existence.\n\nThe Rangers earned the adoration of New Yorkers with a reputation for hard, clean play. Combined with Patrickâs innovative tactics, the Rangers became known as âthe classiest team in hockey,â advancing to the Finals four times in their first seven years and winning two Stanley Cups.\n\nThe core of these early Rangers teams was the teamâs top offensive trio, center Frank Boucher, right wing Bill Cook, and left wing Fred âBunâ Cook. The three players were nicknamed the âA Lineâ for the subway line that ran underneath Madison Square Garden on Eighth Avenue. Each player was an innovator in his own way and made his own mark on franchise history.\n\nBoucher epitomized the clubâs style and grace, winning the Lady Byng Trophy so frequently (seven times in an eight-year span) that the league allowed him to keep the original silverware and struck a new award. Brothers Bill and Bun flanked Boucher and provided the bulk of the scoring for over a decade. Bill Cook, who was the Rangers captain for his entire 11-year career with the Blueshirts, still holds the franchiseâs all-time record for hat tricks with nine, and he led the NHL in goals in three different seasons. Bun Cook was a perfect complement to his brother and Boucher. Bun, who, received his nickname for his penchant of hopping like a bunny while skating, is credited with being the first player in hockey to use a slap shot, a maneuver that is still used regularly in the NHL.\n\nAfter advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals in 1931-32, the Rangers returned the following season. Bill Cook led the NHL with 28 goals and 50 points in 1932-33, and scored the Cup-clinching goal in overtime in Game 4 of the 1933 Stanley Cup Finals to give the Rangers their second Stanley Cup in franchise history."
