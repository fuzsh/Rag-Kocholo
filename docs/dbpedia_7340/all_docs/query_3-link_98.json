In addition, 30+ alumni have gone on to play professionally.\n\nThe impact of playing AAA hockey goes well beyond the ice, as our alumni have also gone on to achieve success in education, business, law enforcement, government, engineering and other well-respected industries all over the world.\n\nWhen it comes to firsts, it was Dublin native Trent Vogelhuber that pioneered the hockey pathway for the Ohio AAA Blue Jackets program. A member of the inaugural AAA team in 2004, Vogelhuber was able to advance his career with the NAHL's St. Louis Bandits where he recorded 26 points in 31 games during the 2006-07 season and accepted a scholarship offer from Miami University.\n\nIn the summer of 2007, Vogelhuber made more history when he became the first native of Central Ohio to ever be selected in the NHL Draft when he was taken in the 7th round (211 overall) by the Columbus Blue Jackets. He was also selected in the 1st round (5th overall) in the USHL Draft by the Des Moines Buccaneers.\n\nFrom 2008-2012, Vogelhuber enjoyed a successful college career at Miami University where he recorded 51 points in 149 career games. Vogelhuber played in four consecutive NCAA Tournaments and back-to-back Frozen Fours. He was a key member of the RedHawks 2009-10 CCHA regular season title and 2011 Mason Cup playoff championship.

In 2015-16, Trent helped the Monsters capture their first Calder Cup in franchise history.\n\nSince retiring in 2018, he spent four seasons developing the Blue Jackets' top prospects as an assistant coach with the Cleveland Monsters. On June 8, 2022, Vogelhuber was named the 7th head coach in Monsters history.\n\nA native of Dublin, Connor Murphy is entering his 10th NHL season and serves as an assistant captain with the Chicago Blackhawks. In 2021, he signed a 4 year extension with the Blackhawks. A veteran of more than 600 NHL games, Murphy made history on November 6, 2013 when he became the first member of the AAA Blue Jackets program to play and score in an NHL game. In 2022, Murphy was nominated for the NHL's prestigious King Clancy Memorial Trophy, presented to \"the player who best exemplifies leadership qualities on and off the ice and has made a noteworthy humanitarian contribution in his community.\"\n\nIn 2011, Murphy became the first OBJ alumnus to be selected in the 1st round of the NHL Draft when he was selected 20th overall by the Phoenix Coyotes. Following the draft, Murphy signed his first NHL contract and played his junior hockey with the Ontario Hockey League's Sarnia Sting. In two seasons in Sarnia, Murphy scored 14 goals and tallied 44 points in 68 games and served as an assistant captain during the 2012-13 season.\n\nMurphy is a graduate of USA Hockey's National Team Development Program and has enjoyed an incredible amount of success on the international stage. In 2011, Murphy scored the game-winning goal in overtime vs. Sweden to give the American the gold medal at the U18 World Championships. He also helped Team USA to the gold medal at the 2013 U20 World Junior Championship alongside his former OBJ teammate Sean Kuraly. The duo also won silver together at the 2010 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament.\n\nMurphy has represented the United States at the World Championships on FIVE occasions, winning bronze medals in 2015 and 2018. In 2016, he led the entire tournament in goals by a defenseman and was named a Top 3 Player of the Team. Perhaps his biggest honor was in 2017, when he was named captain of Team USA.\n\nA native of Dublin, Kuraly signed with his hometown Blue Jackets on July 28, 2021 after 5 successful seasons with the Boston Bruins. Kuraly thrived in his first season with CBJ, setting career highs with 14 goals and 30 points in 77 games. He also led the team and was 11th in the NHL in hits (240). During his time in Boston, he developed the reputation as a clutch performer and helped lead the Bruins to the 2018 Stanley Cup Final. His clutch moments include scoring the game-winning goal at the 2019 Winter Classic, a critical 3rd period goal in Game 7 of the 2019 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals and the winner in double overtime in Game 5 of the 2017 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals. In 2022-23, he was named an assistant captain with the Blue Jackets.\n\nPrior to beginning his NHL career, Kuraly was a 4-year standout and captain at Miami University, where he tallied 93 points in 154 career games and helped lead the RedHawks to the 2012-13 CCHA regular season championship and the 2015 NCHC playoff title.

Since returning home to Columbus, Roslovic has set career bests in all offensive categories in each of his first 2 seasons. In 2020-21, he finished tied for second in team scoring with 34 points in 48 games. In 2021-22, he tallied a career high 22 goals and 45 points. He was also the recipient of the Blue Jackets' Community MVP Award and was nominated for the NHL's King Clancy Memorial Trophy for establishing his foundation, Rosie's Gear for Goals, which has a mission to support aspiring Central Ohio hockey players by equipping them with the gear they'll need to succeed, while also building a strong community around the sport to help players see through their goals on and off the ice.\n\nOn February 4, 2019, Roslovic was named the NHL's 1st Star of the Week after recording 5 goals and 6 points in a 4 goal stretching, including his first career hat trick. Now in his fifth full NHL season, Roslovic was named an AHL All-Star in his first professional season after leading the Manitoba Moose in scoring. He made his NHL debut on April 17, 2017 at Nationwide Arena against the Blue Jackets.\n\nIn 2015, Roslovic was selected in the 1st round of the NHL Entry Draft by the Winnipeg Jets and signed his first professional contract after playing one season at Miami University where he was named to the NCHC's All-Rookie Team. He also helped leaded Team USA to a gold medal at the 2017 U20 World Junior Championship.\n\nRoslovic is a graduate of USA Hockey's National Team Development Program where he tallied 111 points in 119 career games. In 2018, Jack was named one of the top three players on Team USA while helping the team win a gold medal at the U18 World Championship. He also helped the Americans win gold at the 2014 World Hockey Challenge and Four Nations Tournament.\n\nA native of New Albany, Kiefer Sherwood is currently in his sixth professional season. He signed as a free agent with the Anaheim Ducks in 2018 and owned a 6-7-13 line in 60 games with the Ducks before signing with the Colorado Avalanche in 2020. He played in 27 regular season games with the Avalanche and made his Stanley Cup playoff debut in 2021. In the summer of 2022, Sherwood signed as a free agent with the Nashville Predators and made their opening night roster, scoring the first goal of the NHL season vs. the San Jose Sharks.\n\nSherwood has been a dominant force in the American Hockey League with both the San Diego Gulls and Colorado Eagles. In 2021-22, Sherwood was an AHL All-Star and finished the season 3rd in the league in goals (36) and 5th in points (75) in just 57 games.\n\nSherwood played college hockey at Miami University where he scored 34 goals and 86 points in 3 seasons with the RedHawks. He was a member of the NCHC All-Academic Team.\n\nPrior to Miami, Sherwood played two full seasons in the USHL with the Youngstown Phantoms where he racked up 90 points in 126 games.

He was selected in the 7th Round (No. 99 overall) in the 2012 USHL Draft following his 16U season.\n\nOn July 7, 2015, Kole Sherwood became the first player to sign an NHL contract directly from the AAA Blue Jackets program when he signed as a free agent with the Columbus Blue Jackets. The previous season, he led the T1EHL in goals (22) and helped the AAA Blue Jackets win its first ever league championship. Four years later, on February 16, 2019, Sherwood became the first central Ohio product to play for the Blue Jackets.\n\nPrior to making his pro debut, Kole spent three seasons in the Ontario Hockey League with the London Knights, Flint Firebirds and Kitchener Rangers. He notched 75 goals and 179 points in 180 career OHL games and was a member of the 2015-16 London Knights squad that won the OHL Championship and Memorial Cup.\n\nSherwood is currently in his fifth professional season. He has played 12 career NHL games with the Blue Jackets and Predators, and more than 150 games in the AHL with the Cleveland Monsters, Belleville Senators and Milwaukee Admirals.\n\nJustin Richards became the sixth AAA Blue Jacket alumnus to play an NHL game on May 8, 2021 when he recorded an assist and +1 rating in a 5-4 win over Sean Kuraly and the Boston Bruins. In 2022-23, he signed with his hometown Columbus Blue Jackets and tallied one assists while appearing in two games. He finished second on the AHL\"s Cleveland Monsters in scoring with a 10-29-39 line in 61 games.\n\nRichards signed a free agent contract with the New York Rangers in 2020 after three incredibly successful seasons as the University of Minnesota-Duluth. During his collegiate career, Richard helped lead the Bulldogs to the 2019 NCHC playoff championship and back-to-back National Championships in 2018 & 2019. He served as an assistant captain and notched 66 points and a +40 rating in 120 career games. In 2018-19, Richards was a member of the All-NCHC 2nd team and was a two-time winner of the league's Defensive Forward of the Year award. In 2019, he was named to the NCAA All-Tournament team.\n\nPrior to UMD, Richards spent one season in the USHL with the Lincoln Stars where he tallied 30 points in 52 games.\n\nOn April 4, 2022, Carson Meyer became the 7th alumnus of the program to play in an NHL game and the fourth to play for his hometown Columbus Blue Jackets when he debuted vs. the Boston Bruins at Nationwide Arena. He went on to finish the season with the Blue Jackets, playing in 13 games and tallying 3 points. He recorded his 1st NHL goal and assist on April 5 vs. the Philadelphia Flyers.\n\nMeyer spent his college career playing 2 seasons at Miami University and 2 seasons at Ohio State where he totaled 42 goals and 89 points in 137 career games. Following his freshman season at Miami, Meyer was selected by the Columbus Blue Jackets in the 6th round of the 2017 NHL Entry Draft.

In 2013, Connor Murphy and Sean Kuraly (pictured above) helped lead Team USA to a gold medal at the World Junior Championship. Four years later, Jack Roslovic followed suit as he helped Team USA capture gold in a dramatic shootout win over Canada.\n\nThe program has also proven to have a great relationship with the National Team Development Program over the years. While Murphy and Roslovic are both full-time graduates of the program, seven others have received NTDP call-ups while playing for the AAA Blue Jackets (Sean Kuraly, Henry Dill, Kiefer Sherwood, Haydn Gould, Will Elger, Nathan McBrayer and Ethan Perrault). In addition, former Director of Player Development & Advancement Jimmy Mullin was hired as an assistant coach with Team USA in 2021.\n\nCole Cassels has had perhaps the most accomplished junior hockey career of any member of our program. In 2011, Cassels was selected in the 1st round (No. 16 overall) by the Oshawa Generals in the OHL Priority Selection and 3rd round (No. 45 overall) by the Muskegon Lumberjacks in the USHL Futures Draft.\n\nHe would go on to play 4 years in Oshawa, tallying 208 points in 243 career games.
