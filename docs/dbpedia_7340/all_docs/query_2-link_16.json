But according to SB Nation's Travis Hughes, its not yet time to panic.\n\nIf the season begins as scheduled, the Tampa Bay Lightning will open their season on Saturday, October 13 when they will visit the Florida Panthers. The home opener for the Lightning will be Tuesday, October 16 when they host the New York Islanders. The Lightning also get two separate sets of six-game homestands, one in November and the other in March. In addition to that, they will not have a road trip longer than four games at all this season.\n\nThe Lightning close out the 2012-13 season Saturday, April 13 when they visit the Washington Capitals. Their final home game of the season will be Thursday, April 11 against the Pittsburgh Penguins.\n\nFor the complete schedule of the Tampa Bay Lightning, please check the NHL's official website."
