        "text": "The award goes to the player who best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey. It is named for the former North Stars forward, who is the only player in league history to die as a result of injuries suffered on the ice.\n\nNEW YORK (May 14, 2013) -- Center Sidney Crosby of the Pittsburgh\n\nPenguins, goaltender Josh Harding of the Minnesota Wild and defenseman Adam\n\nMcQuaid of the Boston Bruins are the three finalists for the 2012-13 Bill\n\nMasterton Memorial Trophy, which is awarded \"to the player who best\n\nexemplifies the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to\n\nhockey,\" the National Hockey League announced today.\n\nThe local chapters of the PHWA submitted nominations for the\n\nMasterton Trophy at the conclusion of the regular season and the top three\n\nvote-getters were designated as finalists. The winner will be announced\n\nduring the 2013 Stanley Cup Final, with more detail on format to be\n\nreleased at a later date.\n\nCrosby took to the ice in 2012-13 following two seasons in which he\n\nhad missed extended time due to concussion symptoms. His offseason training\n\nand preparation paid off in a remarkable start to the season, as he\n\nrecorded points in nine of his first 11 games. He continued his torrid\n\nscoring into March, helping the Penguins post 15 consecutive wins. Crosby\n\nled the League in points by a double-digit margin on March 30, when he was\n\nstruck in the face with a puck. He underwent surgery that night for a\n\nbroken jaw and significant dental work was required in later days while he\n\nworked toward a return to the Penguins lineup.\n\nWhen faced with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, an incurable\n\nautoimmune disease, last fall, Harding made it clear that his career wasn't\n\nover. In his first start of the season, Harding made 24 saves to shut out\n\nthe Dallas Stars 1-0 on Jan. 20. On Feb. 12, after feeling ill from\n\nmedications treating the disease, he was placed on Injured Reserve and\n\nmissed 33 games as he continued treatment. However, the netminder continued\n\nhis fight with the disease and, after a two-game conditioning assignment\n\nwith the Houston Aeros of the American Hockey League, was activated from\n\nInjured Reserve on April 22 and returned to the Wild lineup.\n\nMcQuaid suffered a season-threatening injury in September when his\n\nright arm grew increasingly swollen. He was diagnosed with a condition\n\nknown as Thoracic Outlet Syndrome that was causing dangerous blood clots to\n\nform in his body. After undergoing two emergency surgeries to remove the\n\nblood clots, the defenseman was deemed unfit to continue his normal\n\noffseason workouts in order to give his body adequate time to heal.\n\nMcQuaid's dedication to his rehabilitation efforts later in the fall\n\nhastened his recovery and he skated alongside his teammates on opening\n\nnight of the 2012-13 season against the New York Rangers at TD Garden.\n\nThe trophy was presented by the NHL Writers' Association in 1968 to\n\ncommemorate the late Bill Masterton, a player with the Minnesota North\n\nStars who exhibited to a high degree the qualities of perseverance,\n\nsportsmanship and dedication to hockey and who died on January 15, 1968."
