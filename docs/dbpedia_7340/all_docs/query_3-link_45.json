        "text": "Rick Paterson completed his 20th season with the Ducks last season, his second as Director of Professional Scouting. He served as the Director of Player Personnel from 2009-20, and was also the Director of Professional Scouting for two other stints with Anaheim (2005-09 and 2020-21). Paterson has over 40 years of experience as a player, coach and scout, and has won the Stanley Cup four times. Along with his Stanley Cup championship with the Ducks in 2007, he won titles with Tampa Bay (2004) and Pittsburgh (1991 and 1992).\n\nPrior to joining the Ducks front office, Paterson spent seven years with the Tampa Bay Lightning, winning the Stanley Cup in 2004 as the club’s Chief Professional Scout. After retiring from the NHL as a player following 10 seasons with Chicago (1978-88), Paterson joined the Pittsburgh Penguins as an Assistant Coach from 1988-93, winning the Stanley Cup in 1991 and 1992. He coached the Penguins’ International Hockey League affiliate in Cleveland from 1993-97 and joined the Tampa Bay Lightning as Assistant Coach in 1997-98. Paterson remained in that role until being named a Professional Scout prior to the start of the 1999-00 season.\n\nBob Ferguson enters his 15th season with the Anaheim Ducks organization and eighth in the San Diego Gulls Hockey Operations department. Ferguson is a hockey lifer, having been involved in either professional or amateur hockey for the past 42 years, either as a player, coach or member of a front office.\n\nIn his seven seasons with the Gulls, Ferguson helped build teams that have a combined 238-164-26-15 record to lead the Pacific Division in all-time wins, points (515) and points percentage (.584%, min. three seasons) since the division’s inception in 2015. The Gulls are the only Pacific Division club to finish among the top four teams in five of the division’s seven AHL seasons. Ferguson has also led San Diego to four Calder Cup Playoffs appearances, including the club’s first appearance in the Western Conference Finals in 2019.\n\nThe Gulls (three times), Toronto Marlies (four times), Charlotte Checkers (three times), Chicago Wolves (three times) and Hershey Bears (three times) are the only AHL teams to advance to the Division Finals on three-or-more occasions since the inception of the current division format in 2015. Under Ferguson, San Diego owns the most playoff wins (18) and is tied for the most series wins (4) among Pacific Division teams.\n\nUnder Ferguson, San Diego completed the 2021-22 season with a 28-33-4-3 record for 63 points and finished seventh in the Pacific Division, earning the club’s fourth Calder Cup Playoffs berth. In 2020-21, San Diego finished with a 26-17-1-0 record for 53 points and finished third in the Pacific Division based on points percentage (.602%), earning a spot in the Pacific Division Playoffs. In 2019-20, the Gulls posted a 30-19-6-2 record for 68 points and tied for third in the Pacific Division, sixth in the Western Conference, before the COVID-19 pandemic ended the season in March. The 2018-19 club compiled a 36-24-5-3 record for 80 points and third in the Pacific Division, while also representing the division in the Western Conference Finals for the first time. San Diego defeated San Jose (four games) and Bakersfield (six games), before falling to Chicago in six games.\n\nThe 2016-17 club went 43-20-3-2 for 91 points, second in the Western Conference and third in the AHL, while defeating Ontario in the first round of the postseason before falling in the Pacific Division Finals to San Jose (five games). The Gulls were named winners of the 2016-17 President’s Award as the AHL Team of the Year, given to an AHL organization for overall excellence as voted on by AHL team presidents. In the club’s inaugural season in 2015-16, the team finished with a 39-23-4-2 record for 84 points, earning second place in the Pacific Division and the club’s first berth in the Calder Cup Playoffs. Under Ferguson’s guidance, San Diego won its first-ever playoff series over the Texas Stars, 3-1, prior to falling to Ontario in the second round (five games).\n\nFerguson was the Assistant General Manager of the Norfolk Admirals for the previous three seasons (2012-2015) and prior to that manned the same position for the Ducks’ prior AHL affiliates, the Syracuse Crunch (2010-12) and Iowa Chops (2008-09). He also spent one season as a college/amateur scout for the Ducks in 2009-10.\n\nBefore joining the Ducks organization, Ferguson spent 26 seasons on the bench as a head coach in the professional and junior ranks. He had head coaching stints with Augusta (ECHL, 2005-08), Florida (ECHL, 1998-2001) and Indianapolis (IHL, 1995-98).

He is a two-time John Brophy Award winner as ECHL Coach of the Year, winning the honor in consecutive seasons with the Florida Everblades in 1998-99 and 1999-2000.\n\nA native of Kingston, Ontario, Ferguson’s illustrious 17-year career as a head coach in the United States Hockey League (USHL) with Sioux City (1981-90) and Des Moines (1990-95, 2001-04) garnered 517 career wins, the third-most in league history. Ferguson guided Sioux City to a pair of Clark Cup championships and won three Clark Cups with Des Moines. He is a three-time Gold Cup winner (U.S. Junior ‘A’ National Champion), five-time USHL Coach of the Year and five-time USHL General Manager of the Year.\n\nBob and his wife, Lisa, have two children: Brett and Kaylee. Brett and his wife, Amanda, have the family’s three grandchildren: Caleb, Aidan and Reid. The family resides in San Diego.\n\nMatt McIlvane enters his first season as head coach of the San Diego Gulls, becoming the fifth head coach in Gulls AHL history.\n\nNamed to his current position on Apr. 25, 2023, McIlvane joins the Gulls after spending the last four consecutive seasons as a coach with EC Red Bull Salzburg of the ICE Hockey League (International Central European Hockey League), the top-tier league in Austria, featuring additional teams from Hungary, Italy, and Slovenia, from 2019-23. McIlvane led Salzburg to back-to-back league championship in 2021-22 and 2022-23, and he also won an ICE Hockey League title as assistant coach with Salzburg in 2013-14. He was the youngest head coach in Salzburg’s history when he was hired at age 33, leading the club to a 94-42-22-19 record in his four seasons (.650%) and a 31-8 mark in the postseason (.795%).\n\nA native of Naperville, Ill., McIlvane has won five league championships as a head coach and assistant coach in Europe the last 10 seasons. Prior to his role with Salzburg, McIlvane spent five seasons with EHC Red Bull München in Germany’s Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL) from 2014-18, serving as associate coach in 2018-19 and assistant coach the prior four seasons. McIlvane helped München to three straight championships in 2016, 2017 and 2018, tied for the longest championship streak in DEL history. He began his coaching career as an assistant coach with the Orlando Solar Bears (ECHL) in 2012-13 and the Danville Dashers of the Federal Prospects Hockey League as General Manager and head coach (2011-12).\n\nInternationally, McIlvane helped Germany to a silver medal at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang as an assistant coach, the country’s first-ever Olympic silver medal in hockey and third medal overall (two prior bronze).
