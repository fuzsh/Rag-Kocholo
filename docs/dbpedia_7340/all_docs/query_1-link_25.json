Serving as one of the team's tri-captains, D'Agostino continued to be a threat offensively with 17 points in 34 games. His six goals were tops among blueliners, including three power-play goals. One of those served as the winning goal in the Big Red's 4-2 victory over Princeton in Game 2 of a ECAC Hockey Championship first round series, spurring a Cornell sweep. It was D'Agostino's 10th career power-play goal and it was his second goal of the game. He also had his first career three-point game when he dished out three assists in a span of just 11 minutes in the championship game of the Florida College Hockey Classic against Maine on Dec. 29.\n\nJunior Season — 2011-12\n\nD’Agostino emerged as one of the nation’s top point-producing defensemen, leading the Big Red with six power-play goals en route to All-Ivy League Second Team and All-ECAC Hockey Second Team selections. He posted career-highs in goals (8) and points (20), while producing a whopping five game-winning goals. He was named ECAC Hockey’s Player of the Week on Nov. 15 after scoring three goals in games at Dartmouth and Harvard. He scored all eight of his goals in a nine-game span from Nov. 11 to Dec. 29. At the team's postseason banquet, D'Agostino was awarded the Crimson Cup for being the team's standout player in the season series against Harvard.\n\nSophomore Season - 2010-11\n\nD'Agostino had a strong sophomore season, contributing on both ends of the ice. He posted 17 points on seven goals and 10 assists while helping to anchor one of the two power play units. D'Agostino appeared in 32 games, matching his total from his first season, and posted a pair of multi-point efforts on the year. He picked up a goal and an assist in the season opener against New Hampshire on Oct. 29, then tallied the same against Colgate at the Prudential Center in Newark, N.J., on Nov. 27. He added in a pair of game-winning tallies on the season, scoring the winner on Nov. 12 against Quinnipiac and again on Jan. 7 at Princeton.\n\nFreshman Season - 2009-10\n\nD'Agostino made an immediate impact as an offensive-minded defenseman for the Big Red. He scored four goals and added another 14 assists for 18 points, ranking second on the team in scoring among defensemen. D'Agostino earned a spot on the ECAC Hockey All-Rookie team for his play on the season. He made his collegiate debut on Oct. 30 in the season opener against Niagara, picking up an assist in the game. He scored one point in each of the first three games he appeared in, culminating with a goal in the loss to Yale on Nov. 13. D'Agostino had his best game of his career against Harvard in the ECAC Hockey quarterfinals, scoring two goals and adding an assist in the 5-1 victory in game one, finishing the night with a +4 rating. D'Agostino scored a pair of game-winners, first on Nov. 20 against Princeton, then in the March 12 victory against Harvard in the ECAC Hockey quarterfinals. He finished the season with a +13 rating and six minutes in penalties.\n\nCareer Highs Goals 2 (four times) last at Princeton, 3/9/13 Assists 3 vs. Maine, 12/29/12 Points 3 (two times) last vs. Maine, 12/29/12 Shots 5 (four times) last at Princeton, 3/9/13 Penalties 2 (six times) last at Quinnipiac, 3/16/13 Penalty Minutes 12 at Quinnipiac, 3/16/13\n\nBefore Cornell\n\nD’Agostino spent two seasons with the St. Michael’s Buzzers of the OJHL and was selected after his first season with the Buzzers by the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League in the seventh round of the 2008 draft. He was named the OJHL Central Division’s top defensemen last season. Serving as an assistant captain, he played in 43 games in 2008-09 with the Buzzers, scoring nine goals and 24 assists for 33 points to rank first among all defensemen. He was also named the Buzzers’ Rookie of the Year after the 2007-08 season that saw him tally 23 points on five goals and 18 assists. D’Agostino was selected to represent Team Canada East at the World Junior A Challenge in 2008-09, helping that squad to a third-place finish.\n\nPersonal\n\nNicholas D'Agostino is the son of Paul and Anna D'Agostino and has a younger sister. His father played professional soccer in the North American Soccer League from 1978-82.
