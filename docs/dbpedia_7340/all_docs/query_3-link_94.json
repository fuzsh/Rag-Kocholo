        "text": "It always seems like a bad idea to count out the Pittsburgh Penguins, especially considering the two-time defending Stanley Cup champions have proved themselves to be slow starters in season's past.\n\nThe Penguins hit the Christmas break this year 10th in the Eastern Conference sitting on 39 points. Pittsburgh is 4-6-0 in its past 10 games and sits three points out of a wild card spot, and seven points out of second place in the Metropolitan Division.\n\nThis isn't unfamiliar territory for Pittsburgh. Two Christmas' ago the Penguins were in 12th in the Eastern Conference, accruing 35 points over their first 33 games that season (Pittsburgh currently has 39 in 37). Two weeks prior to Christmas 2015 the Penguins fired Mike Johnston, Mike Sullivan took his place as head coach, and the whole situation has worked out pretty well for Pittsburgh ever since.\n\nThe thing about that Penguins team, and a trait it shares with the current club, is some decent underlying numbers. The Penguins were a team with pretty good underlying numbers early months of the 2015-16 season but couldn't score (28th in the NHL in 5-on-5 shooting percentage at the Christmas break). The current Penguins are mirred in one of the strangest statistical slides the NHL has ever seen.\n\nWith the NHL nearing a close to the calendar year, the Penguins are dead last in the NHL — 31st — in both 5-on-5 shooting and save-pecentage. Never in the Behind the Net Era (beginning in 2008) has a team finished last in both of those categories, and up until this season there were 30 teams to jockey with.\n\nBerkshire: Alex Ovechkin, 32, ages into goal-scoring glory at historic pace\n\nFor all the offensive talent on Pittsburgh's roster with the likes of Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Phil Kessel, the Penguins have scored on 5.26-percent of their shots at 5-on-5. It's now only a low mark, it's 0.59 points lower than the second-worst team in the league, the Arizona Coyotes. That kind of disparity is the difference between the 22nd-ranked team in 5v5 shooting percentage and 14th.\n\nPittsburgh has also struggled to get consistent stop in this situation, with a team save-percentage of .905. The Penguins lost long-time starter Marc-Andre Fleury to expansion, and have turned over the reigns to the crease to Matt Murray. It's been a rocky start for the new No. 1 in Pittsburgh, who has a .910 save-percentage at 5-on-5. But the Penguins real problem has been finding a reliable backup; Antti Niemi and Casey DeSmith have combined to go .878 at 5-on-5 in seven starts. Tristan Jarry, who has backed up and taken the starting job while Murray was out with a lower-body injury, leads the team with a .925 5-on-5 save-percentage in 11 appearances.\n\nThe Penguins have not played up to the standard they've set over the past two seasons, but it's also been a statistically unsustainable stretch the likes of which has never been seen. There have been four instances since 2008 of a team finishing in the bottom-five in both 5-on-5 shooting and save-percentage, and each of those teams finished near the bottom of the NHL standings. Those teams are the 2008-09 New York Islanders (61 points), the 2012-13 Florida Panthers (36 points in a 48-game schedule), the 2014-15 Arizona Coyotes (56 points) and the 2016-17 Colorado Avalanche (61 points).\n\nPittsburgh's current pace of 1.08 points per-game has them on pace just about 89 points, and of course that's having played nearly half its season getting some of the worst goaltending and shooting efficiency in the league.\n\nIt remains to be seen how far each of these numbers will regress. In 49 games last season Murray's 5-on-5 save percentage was .934, the same figure he posted the season prior in 13 appearances. Murray has been even better in the postseason, a .941 5-on-5 save percentage in the 2017 Stanley Cup Playoffs to lead Pittsburgh to that second consecutive championship.\n\nWATCH: John Gibson dives to make miraculous save against Crosby, Penguins\n\nOffensively one would also assume given all the pieces have the Penguins simply can't continue not to score like this. Pittsburgh is 29th in the NHL in goals-for per 60 minutes, a year removed from leading the NHL in that category.\n\nKris Letang has yet to score a 5-on-5 goal on 84 shots, Sidney Crosby is shooting 4.48 percent (over 10 points lower than the 15.12 percent he shot last year) and the list goes on.\n\nAnd yet given all of this, Pittsburgh still finds itself within shouting distance of a playoff spot playing in the most competitive division in the NHL."
