        "text": "Columbus Blue Jackets, American professional ice hockey team based in Columbus, Ohio, that plays in the Eastern Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL).\n\nThe Blue Jackets joined the NHL in 2000 alongside fellow expansion team the Minnesota Wild. The franchise’s nickname, the product of a name-the-team contest, pays homage to the many Ohioans who served in the Union army during the American Civil War and to the manufacture in Columbus of many of the uniforms worn by that army. The Blue Jackets’ first three seasons ended in last-place divisional finishes. A highlight of that period came in 2002 when the team drafted left wing and future All-Star Rick Nash with the first overall selection of the NHL draft. Nash’s presence helped Columbus escape the divisional cellar for the first time in 2003–04, and the team qualified for its first postseason berth (a first-round loss to the Detroit Red Wings) in the 2008–09 season. Following that playoff appearance, subsequent Blue Jacket squads returned to the lower echelons of the NHL.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nGreat Moments in Sports Quiz"
