        "text": "Sidney Crosby News\n\nPenguins Hope To Have \"Quiet\" Extension Talks With Sidney Crosby\n\nThe Pittsburgh Penguins hope to keep extension talks with Sidney Crosby \"as quiet as possible\" this offseason. \"The key for us is, because of the importance of it and how much Sid means to the organization and the city, we want to keep that as quiet as possible and go through it,\" Penguins general manager Kyle Dubas told NHL.com at the weekend. \"And then hopefully as we get through this summer, get a sense where everybody's at and then let everybody know at the right time.\" Crosby is set to head into the final season of a 12-year, $104.4-million contract, which has a $8.7 million average annual value. The Penguins captain has seen his team miss the Stanley Cup Playoffs in two consecutive seasons despite him having back-to-back 90-point years. Crosby registered 42 goals and 52 assists in 82 outings in 2023-24, showing he's far from past his best.\n\nJun 10\n\nSidney Crosby To Discuss Extension With Penguins\n\nPittsburgh Penguins center Sidney Crosby will discuss a contract extension with the team as he will be on the final season of a 12-year, $104.4 million deal with the team in the 2024-25 season. The average annual value of that deal was a unique $8.7 million, an homage to his No. 87 and his birth year in 1987. \"Obviously, I'm going to talk to [general manager Kyle Dubas] and have a conversation with him,\" Crosby said. \"We'll see. I think it's just something I'll have a conversation with him about.\" The future Hall of Famer led the Penguins with 94 points in his 19th NHL season. The Penguins fell just shy of the Stanley Cup Playoffs in the 2023-24 campaign, finishing three points back of the Washington Capitals for the final Wild Card spot in the Eastern Conference.\n\nApr 18\n\nSidney Crosby Enters Top 10 On NHL's All-Time Scoring List\n\nPittsburgh Penguins center Sidney Crosby made his way into the top 10 on the NHL's all-time scoring list on Thursday with a three-point performance in a vital 6-5 overtime win against Detroit. He finished the contest with a goal and two assists as the Penguins kept their playoff hopes alive. Crosby reached 1,591 points (591 goals, 1,000 assists), pushing Phil Esposito out of the top 10. He will have his eyes next on Joe Sakic, who collected 1,641 points in his career. The Penguins captain continues to make scoring look easy even as a 36-year-old and is on the cusp of recording his eighth campaign with at least 90 points, having notched 41 goals and 48 assists in 79 outings.\n\nApr 12\n\nSidney Crosby Earns Three-Point Night Monday\n\nPittsburgh Penguins center Sidney Crosby notched two goals and an assist for a three-point night en route to a 5-2 win over the hosting New York Rangers. With the effort, the future Hall of Famer ensured he will hit at least one point per game for the 19th season, tying legend Wayne Gretzky for the most of all-time. It has been a disappointing season for the Pens whose playoff chances are on life support as they still sit five points back of the final Wild Card spot in the Eastern Conference behind the Washington Capitals who hold a game in hand.\n\nApr 2\n\nSidney Crosby Collects Three Points Versus Carolina\n\nPittsburgh Penguins center Sidney Crosby recorded his sixth game of the season with at least three points on Tuesday, netting a goal and two assists in a 4-1 win over Carolina. The Penguins captain assisted Bryan Rust on the game-winning goal at the 18:09 mark in the second period and bagged a pair of points near the end of the game with the opposition net empty. Crosby hit the 35-goal mark with the game and now has 76 points in 71 outings. He's had a whopping seven points across the past two games, and with back-to-back meetings with the struggling Blue Jackets coming up, Crosby's numbers could get another big boost this week.\n\nMar 27\n\nSidney Crosby Notches Four Points In Defeat Sunday\n\nPittsburgh Penguins center Sidney Crosby notched a goal and three assists but his team fell to the Colorado Avalanche in overtime by a 5-4 count on Sunday. The future Hall of Famer's team looked primed to earn the victory as they led 4-0 late in the second period before the Avalanche stormed back, tying the game with 4:38 remaining in the third period before winning it in the extra frame just 54 seconds in. While the Penguins have disappointed this season, Crosby has been excellent with 34 goals and 73 points across 70 games. The Penguins' playoff chances are almost zero as they sit with a 30-30-10 record, nine points back of the second Wild Card spot in the Eastern Conference.\n\nMar 25\n\nSidney Crosby Puts In Vintage Performance Versus Flyers\n\nPittsburgh Penguins center Sidney Crosby had an outstanding game against Philadelphia on Sunday, leading the team to a 7-6 victory in the Battle of Pennsylvania with a four-point effort. Crosby scored Pittsburgh's first goal and delivered three assists, with one of the helpers coming on the power play. The Penguins captain became the 10th player in NHL history to register at least 460 career multi-point games, and it's his 39th four-point effort. Pittsburgh is heading for another year without any playoff action, but Crosby continues to crush it. He has tallied 32 goals and 60 points in 55 games. 24 of Crosby's points have come in 20 games since the calendar was flipped.\n\nFeb 26\n\nSidney Crosby Scores Goal In Loss\n\nPittsburgh Penguins center Sidney Crosby scored a power-play goal in Friday's 3-2 loss against the Wild. The 36-year-old scored from close range in the opening minute of the third period to tie the game at two, while the Penguins captain extended his point streak to nine consecutive games with the important goal. Crosby remains one of the premier players in the league as he has recorded a team-best 28 goals and 52 points through 48 games.\n\nFeb 10\n\nSidney Crosby Scores Twice In Monday's Win\n\nPittsburgh Penguins center Sidney Crosby produced two goals in Monday's 3-0 win over Seattle. It's his second multi-goal effort in three games. Crosby is enjoying one of the most productive campaigns of his career in front of the net, having lit the lamp 26 times in 42 appearances. He's on pace for his second 50-goal year. The Penguins captain has also notched 20 assists this season, and he's made a red-hot start to 2024 with a run of 10 points (six goals, four assists) in seven games.\n\nJan 16\n\nSidney Crosby Records Three Points In Victory\n\nPittsburgh Penguins center Sidney Crosby finished with two goals and one assist in Wednesday's 4-3 shootout victory against the Canadiens. The Penguins captain scored an even-strength goal to cut the deficit to one in the opening frame, while adding a power-play goal at the midway mark of the second period. Crosby's three-point night brings him to a tie with Hall of Fame forward Mark Recchi for 13th on the NHL's all-time scoring list with 1,533 points. Crosby continues to perform at the highest level as he has totaled a team-high 17 goals and 31 points through 28 games.\n\nDec 14\n\nSidney Crosby On Longest Point Streak In Five Seasons\n\nPittsburgh Penguins center Sidney Crosby is on an 11-game point streak following Saturday's two-goal effort in a 4-2 loss to Carolina. The run includes nine goals and eight assists and is Crosby's longest scoring streak since the 2017-18 season. The Penguins tend to be very inconsistent with their work, but Crosby has performed well throughout the campaign, going pointless just once. With 16 games played, he has contributed 12 goals and 10 assists. The Penguins captain is among eight players with at least 10 goals and 10 assists for the season.\n\nNov 19\n\nSidney Crosby Scores Hat Trick In Tuesday's Victory\n\nPittsburgh Penguins center Sidney Crosby scored three goals and added an assist in Tuesday's 5-3 victory against the Blue Jackets. Crosby opened the scoring four minutes into the first period, and scored his second goal of the contest on a redirected shot from close range to give the Penguins a one-goal lead in the closing stages of the third period. Crosby completed the hat trick with an empty-net goal in the final minute of the contest, bringing his season totals to a team-leading 10 goals and 19 points through 14 games. It was the 16th career hat trick for the Penguins captain, while the four-point night marks a season-high for the center and extends his point streak to nine games. Crosby has picked up at least one point in 13 of 14 games to begin the season, and the 36-year-old is still one of the elite forwards in the league in his 19th NHL season.\n\nNov 15\n\nSidney Crosby Strikes Twice Against Washington\n\nPittsburgh Penguins center Sidney Crosby had two goals against his old rival Alex Ovechkin and the Washington Capitals on Friday. The classic matchup ended with a blowout victory for the Penguins, as Crosby's crew put four pucks past Charlie Lindgren without a reply. Both of Crosby's markers were power-play goals. No. 87 has kicked off his 19th campaign in very good goal-scoring form, having netted three times through two games with nine shots on goal. He gets a quick chance to add to his tally, with the Penguins in action again Saturday night versus the Flames, against whom Crosby has tallied 13 goals and 24 points in 19 career games.\n\nOct 14\n\nSidney Crosby Hopes To See Penguins Bounce Back From Disappointing Year\n\nPittsburgh Penguins center Sidney Crosby hopes to be part of a bounce-back campaign after the team's 16-year playoff streak came to an end last season. \"I think you want to bounce back, when it doesn't go your way. I think you want to respond the right way and use it as a learning experience,\" Crosby said. \"Hopefully, that's everyone's mindset. I think with a lot of new faces, everyone's really excited and has a lot of energy and wants to get going, want to prove themselves.\" While Pittsburgh's 2022-23 campaign finished in disappointment, Crosby had plenty of personal success, producing his second consecutive 30-goal season and recording 93 points overall in 82 games. He has managed more points just once over the last nine years. With him now fueled by the desire to get back in the playoffs, we should see another very productive campaign from the veteran superstar.\n\nSep 19\n\nSidney Crosby Finishes Season With Two-Assist Performance\n\nPittsburgh Penguins center Sidney Crosby had two assists in Thursday's 3-2 overtime loss to Columbus to finish his 18th NHL campaign with 93 points. Crosby played in all 82 regular season games, contributing 33 goals and 80 assists. Unfortunately, the Penguins didn't have enough quality to make the postseason, meaning Crosby will be watching the Stanley Cup Playoffs from home for only the third time in his career. The 35-year-old, who recently hit 1,500 career points, will look to break into the top 10 in the all-time scoring list next season.\n\nApr 14\n\nSidney Crosby Reaches 1,500 Career Points\n\nPittsburgh Penguins center Sidney Crosby reached another special landmark in his illustrious career on Saturday, becoming the 15th player in NHL history with 1,500 points. He did it with a three-point performance in a 5-1 win over Detroit, scoring twice and handing out one assist. By doing it in his 1,188th game, Crosby became the sixth fastest player to hit 1,500 career points. Only seven players on the exclusive list have recorded 1,500 points with one team. He has totaled 550 goals and 950 assists. Pittsburgh's 16-year run of straight Stanley Cup playoff spots might end this season, but Crosby is still going strong, boasting 33 goals and 91 points through 80 games.\n\nApr 9\n\nSidney Crosby Contributes With Assist In Loss\n\nPittsburgh Penguins center Sidney Crosby finished with one assist and a plus-three rating in Saturday's 4-3 loss against the Bruins. Crosby picked up his only point of the contest on forward Bryan Rust's first goal of the contest in the opening period, as the Penguins lost the game in the final minutes of the third period while they continue to battle for the final wild card spot in the Eastern Conference. Crosby is still one of the best players in the league as he has totaled 31 goals, 55 assists and a team-high 86 points through 76 games, for his highest point total in a season since reaching the 100-point mark during the 2018-19 season.\n\nApr 2\n\nSidney Crosby Makes History By Reaching 30 Goals\n\nPittsburgh Penguins center Sidney Crosby scored his 30th goal of the season Wednesday against Colorado, helping the team stop a four-game skid with a 5-2 victory. He produced the first goal of the contest, becoming the first player ever to record a 30-goal campaign as an 18-year-old and then again at 35-plus. Nothing appears to slow down No. 87, not even Father Time. The Penguins captain is averaging 1.18 points per game in his 17th season in the league, having added 54 assists to his goals in 71 games.\n\nMar 23\n\nSidney Crosby Closes Three-Point Show With Game-Winner\n\nPittsburgh Penguins center Sidney Crosby finished off his 169th career three-point game with the game-winning goal as his crew beat Columbus 5-4 in overtime Tuesday. No. 87 produced two assists in the third period before wrapping things up with a power-play goal in the extra frame. He is now tied with Paul Coffey for the eighth-most three-point games in NHL history and boasts the second-most overtime goals (20). Crosby has gone without a point just four times across his last 21 appearances and has 28 goals and 48 assists in 63 games for the season.\n\nMar 8"
