        "text": "Presented by Karen’s Print Rite\n\nIt was an eventful offseason for Waterloo Black Hawks alumni. Many landed with new National Hockey League clubs. Looking at the list of former Hawks which follows, nearly half of the players who have already skated in a 2023/24 NHL game are doing it with a different team than they played for in 2022/23.\n\nThe musical chairs of pro hockey has provided an opportunity for Waterloo fans to continue watching many familiar NHL teams. Joe Pavelski may not play for the San Jose Sharks anymore, but Jacob MacDonald has been there since a trade last winter. Mark Eaton retired long ago, and Mark Friedman was dealt earlier this year, but the Pittsburgh Penguins' roster now includes Vinnie Hinostroza. Friedman is in Vancouver, together with Brock Boeser after the two were just a year apart in Waterloo. In fact, five of the seven clubs where Hawks alumni have played the most games all time (Nashville, San Jose, Vancouver, Los Angeles, and Pittsburgh) include at least one former Waterloo player on their rosters right now.\n\nHere's how it all fits together:\n\nMikey Anderson – Los Angeles Kings\n\n(Waterloo: 2015/16 – 2016/17)\n\nAnderson continues to bring stability to the Kings' defensive zone. He entered this season as a career +30 player and is already +7 this season. That ties Anderson for the Kings' 2023/24 plus/minus lead with defense partner Drew Doughty and star forward Quinton Byfield. Anderson is also on track for his best offensive season at the NHL level. He already has seven points (one goal, six assists) in 11 games. Last season, Anderson tallied five goals and 15 assists in 77 appearances. His first goal of this campaign came against the Arizona Coyotes on October 27th.\n\nBrock Boeser – Vancouver Canucks\n\n(Waterloo: 2014/15)\n\nIt's hard to imagine a better season debut than Boeser and the Canucks celebrated on October 11th. Boeser scored four times and Vancouver crushed the Edmonton Oilers 8-1. As the season has progressed, Boeser has continued to accumulate multigoal performances, scoring twice against San Jose last Thursday, then producing two more goals Monday versus Edmonton. As of today, he is one of only three NHL players to have reached the 10-goal mark, tied with Nikita Kucherov and trailing only Auston Matthews (13). The resurgent Canucks are currently second in the Pacific Division.\n\nJack Drury – Carolina Hurricanes\n\n(Waterloo: 2016/17 – 2017/18)\n\nThis looks like the year Drury becomes a regular in the Hurricanes' lineup. Two seasons ago, he played in just two games. Last year, a mid-season call-up from the American Hockey League led to 38 appearances. So far, he has played in all 13 games for second-place Carolina. The Hurricanes have started the season 8-5-0 and trail only the New York Rangers in the Metropolitan Division. Among Carolina centers, Drury's 55 percent faceoff win percentage ranks second behind veteran Jordan Staal. Drury has one assist.\n\nMark Friedman – Vancouver Canucks\n\n(Waterloo: 2012/13 – 2013/14)\n\nIn three seasons with the Philadelphia Flyers, Friedman was in the lineup 11 times. Three more years with the Pittsburgh Penguins were worth 54 games played. During the first three weeks after a trade that moved Friedman to Vancouver, he has dressed for nine Canucks games. Vancouver has won seven of them, and the veteran defenseman is averaging 13:28 of ice time. His first point for the Canucks was an assist during a 10-1 victory over San Jose on November 2nd. At his current pace, Friedman could play in his 100th career game sometime in January.\n\nVinnie Hinostroza – Pittsburgh Penguins\n\n(Waterloo: 2010/11 – 2012/13)\n\nOn three separate occasions, Hinostroza was called up to Pittsburgh from the AHL's Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins. Each time, he was sent down without appearing in a game. That changed last week on a fourth call-up. Hinsotroza scored a goal and assisted on another November 4th during his season debut against the San Jose Sharks. The assist was his 150th career NHL point. Hinostroza remained up and played in another game at Anaheim on Tuesday. Pittsburgh is his fifth stop in the NHL after playing previously for Chicago, Arizona, Florida, and Buffalo.\n\nJacob MacDonald – San Jose Sharks\n\n(Waterloo: 2009/10 – 2010/11)\n\nMacDonald opened the year on San Jose's injured reserve list. Unfortunately, after playing in two games, he has gone back on IR. His brief stint in action included some highlights. The Sharks lost last Saturday's game against Pittsburgh 10-2, but MacDonald had a hand in both goals. He scored the first power play goal of his NHL career on a one-timer in the third period. Earlier he had assisted on another goal by Anthony Duclair. Although his time with the Sharks has been limited this season, San Jose has indicated a willingness to use him as either a forward or a defenseman.\n\nTom Novak – Nashville Predators\n\n(Waterloo: 2014/15)\n\nLast season, Novak had a breakout season with Nashville, sticking in the lineup for 51 games after being recalled from the AHL's Milwaukee Admirals and generating 43 points (17 goals, 26 assists). This year, Novak is just shy of a point-per-game average, with six goals and four assists over the Predators' first 12 contests. He ranks second among his teammates in goals and third in points. On October 21st he scored the game-winning goal in Nashville's 5-1 victory over San Jose. It was the fourth game-winner of Novak's NHL career.\n\nJoe Pavelski – Dallas Stars\n\n(Waterloo: 2002/03 – 2003/04)\n\nEarlier this fall, NHL.com featured an article on the Hawks' most illustrious alumnus: \"Pavelski Turning Back Clock for Stars with Hot Start.\" In reality, Pavelski's best hockey has come during his 30s, and the Stars' decision to sign him as a 35-year-old free agent in 2019 has continued to pay off. Pavelski has five goals and six assists in 11 games for Dallas this year. That brings his scoring total as a member of the Stars to 251 regular season points, or almost a quarter of the goals and assists he has during a 17-year-plus league career. He is currently tied with Roope Hintz for the Dallas lead in goals and points.\n\nCal Petersen – Philadelphia Flyers\n\n(Waterloo: 2010/11 – 2013/14)\n\nPetersen has been getting acclimated to new surroundings after being traded from L.A. to Philadelphia this summer. He opened the season in the American Hockey League, but was called up last week following an injury to Carter Hart. His first appearance with his new team was against his former team when the Kings visited the Flyers on Saturday. L.A. produced five goals on 30 shots. Petersen has remained with the Flyers during a trip to the West Coast this week. Philadelphia visits Anaheim on Friday and Los Angeles on Saturday.\n\nDylan Samberg – Winnipeg Jets\n\n(Waterloo: 2016/17)\n\nWith 12 appearances so far this season, Samberg is climbing steadily toward 100 in his NHL career. He could theoretically reach the milestone on the last day of this month if he plays in all of the Jets' November games. Samberg has started this season with a pair of assists and a +2 plus/minus differential. He is now at +15 over the length of his NHL career. So far this year, he has been averaging 14:33 of ice time per game, which is in line with his previous minutes for the Jets. Winnipeg hosts the Nashville Predators tomorrow.\n\nZach Sanford – Arizona Coyotes\n\n(Waterloo: 2013/14)\n\nSanford made his Coyotes debut on October 27th during a 5-4 loss to the L.A. Kings. He tallied an assist in that game. Sanford now has at least one goal or assist with six different NHL clubs. No former Black Hawk has played for a wider assortment of teams. He needs one more goal for 50 in his NHL regular season career and one more point of any kind for 100. However, a bid to reach those milestones is temporarily on hold. Sanford was assigned to the Tucson Roadrunners of the AHL on Tuesday.\n\nCraig Smith – Dallas Stars\n\n(Waterloo: 2006/07-2008-09)\n\nLast season in Boston, Smith was scratched more times than during any season of his NHL career. A relocation to Washington gave the veteran an opportunity for a strong finish. In the offseason, Smith signed a free agent contract with the Stars. He has been in the lineup for all 11 Dallas games, and the Stars have started well, currently holding second place in the Central Division. Smith has one goal and one assist so far. With 864 career regular season appearances, Smith has the third-highest game total among Waterloo alumni. Jason Blake is just ahead of him at 871.\n\nWhere Are They Now features are presented by Karen's Print Rite, 2515 Falls Avenue in Waterloo."
