The two teams battled for 65 minutes with the game ending in a 1-1 tie. In the shootout, Notre Dame took a 2-1 win in five rounds. Team USA took a 1-0 lead in the game as Shane Eiserman scored at the 1:10 mark of the third period to put the Under-18 squad in front. Junior David Gerths (Ankeny, Iowa) tied the game at 13:45 of the third when he scored from the slot off a nice feed from Mike Voran (Jr., Livonia, Mich.). In the shootout, Team USA got a goal from Anthony Louis on the second shot that was answered by T.J. Tynan (Jr., Orland Park, Ill.) on Notre Dame’s second shot. After a pair of misses by both teams, Team USA’s Scott Savage missed on the fifth shot while Bryan Rust (Jr., Novi, Mich.) scored on his chance to give the Irish the shootout win.

The Hockey City Classic is being organized by the Chicago-based sports and entertainment marketing agency Intersport, in partnership with Soldier Field and the Chicago Park District. Notre Dame hockey is no stranger to the city of Chicago as the Irish have played hockey in the Windy City on and off since the 1966-67 campaign when the Notre Dame club team played in the first-ever college hockey tournament at Chicago Stadium. Since then, the Irish have played more than 40 games in and around Chicago, playing at Lake Forest (1969-70 and from 1985-91), at Chicago Stadium (1971 and 1972), at the University of Illinois-Chicago (1979-82 and 1988-96 as CCHA rivals), at Allstate Arena (2003 and 2005) and most-recently, at the Sears Centre in Hoffman Estates, Ill., where Notre Dame hosted the Shillelagh Tournament from 2009-11. The 2012-13 Notre Dame hockey roster features six players with ties to the Chicago area: The group includes senior Sam Calabrese, juniors Kevin Lind (Homer Glen) and T.J. Tynan, sophomore Robbie Russo (Westmont) and freshmen Thomas DiPauli and Sam Herr. The Irish have had 25 hockey monogram winners from the Chicago area in the program’s history. Current Notre Dame defenseman Stephen Johns (Wampum, Pa.) was selected by the Chicago Blackhawks in the second round, 60th overall in the 2010 NHL Entry Draft and the Hawks have drafted five Notre Dame players since 1971.\n\nTHE FINAL COUNTDOWN: The 2012-13 season marks the final year for the Central Collegiate Hockey Association. Due to the shift in the college hockey landscape last season, the conference saw its teams shift as Michigan, Michigan State and Ohio State will now play in the Big 10 hockey conference, beginning in 2013-14 along with Minnesota, Penn State and Wisconsin from the WCHA. When those teams pulled out of their respective conferences, the National Collegiate Hockey Conference (NCHC) was created, taking in teams from the WCHA and the CCHA. That conference includes: Colorado College, Denver, Miami, Minnesota Duluth, Nebraska-Omaha, North Dakota, St. Cloud State and Western Michigan. The remaining CCHA teams then joined the remaining WCHA teams in the WCHA that now includes: Alaska, Bowling Green, Ferris State, Lake Superior State and Northern Michigan. Notre Dame then made its conference choice and joined Hockey East.\n\nCONFERENCE CALL: Notre Dame begins its final season in the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA) in 2012-13. The Irish will begin play in the Hockey East Association beginning with the 2013-14 campaign. The change in conferences was announced on Oct. 5, 2011 with a press conference that was held at the Compton Family Ice Arena. In making the announcement, Hockey East commissioner Joe Bertagna said, “It is not an overstatement to say that this is one of the most significant days in the history of our conference. The addition of new institutions is always exciting but Notre Dame brings a unique set of qualities and circumstances to the continued growth of our league. We are proud to welcome Notre Dame into the fold and we look forward to getting to the many details that come with this announcement.” Notre Dame Vice President and Director of Athletics Jack Swarbrick said, “We are excited to be joining Hockey East beginning in the 2013-14 season. Many factors played a role in our decision, but three were of special importance to us. The first two were the critical issues of the student-athlete experience and Notre Dame’s fit with the other schools in the conference. But of special importance in this instance, was our goal of giving our hockey program an unprecedented level of national exposure through our expanded partnership with the NBC Sports Group. Athletics at Notre Dame has always served as a platform for promoting the University.” Notre Dame head coach Jeff Jackson added, “We are honored and pleased to join Hockey East for the 2013-14 season. The conference is an established league with a great tradition and outstanding programs that share Notre Dame’s values. The exposure for our players and team in a major media and NHL market will be second to none. Hockey East’s commitment to playing a smaller league schedule will allow us to enhance our home and non-conference schedule with traditional western and Big Ten rivals. This will allow us to bring great games to the Compton Family Ice Arena and create a more diverse, nationally-televised schedule. We are grateful to Joe Bertagna and the Hockey East Association members for this tremendous opportunity.” Notre Dame has been a member of the CCHA twice during its 45 years of Division I hockey. The Irish first joined the conference from 1981-83 and then again in 1992 through the 2012-13 season. During that time, Notre Dame has won two CCHA regular-season and postseason tournament titles (2007 and 2009).\n\nNATIONAL JUNIOR TEAM: Four current members of the Notre Dame hockey team were invited to the 2012 Junior National Evaluation Camp last summer with the goal of being selected for the 2012 United States Junior National team that will participate in the World Junior Championships. Sophomore defenseman Robbie Russo (Westmont, Ill.) was joined by freshmen Thomas DiPauli (Woodridge, Ill.), Steven Fogarty (Edina, Minn.) and Mario Lucia (Plymouth, Minn.). Last season, defenseman Stephen Johns and center T.J. Tynan played for the United States in the World Juniors held in Calgary and Edmonton, Alta., helping the U.S. to a 3-3-0 record. They became the 14th and 15th Notre Dame players to participate in the World Junior Championships. They joined Jack Brownschidle (`76-’77, `78-’79), Ben Simon (`96-’97, `97-’98), Joe Dusbabek (`97-’98), Dan Carlson (`98-’99), Connor Dunlop (`99-’00, `00-’01), Brett Henning (`99-’00), David Inman (`99-’00), Rob Globke (`00-’01, `01-’02), Brett Lebda (`01-’02), Kyle Lawson (`06-’07), Ian Cole (`07-’08, `08-’09), Teddy Ruth (`08-’09) and Kyle Palmieri (`09-’10, `10-’11) as former Irish players to play in the World Junior Championships."
