        "text": "The Edmonton Oilers' comeback bid came up short in last year's Stanley Cup Final, but the latest NHL odds show books expect them to be the last team standing in 2025.\n\nWith just a couple of weeks left in August and preseason closer than it appears, here are the latest 2024-25 Stanley Cup odds.\n\n2025 Stanley Cup betting odds\n\n8/14/2024: Regular season hockey is still almost two months away, but the preseason will be here quicker than you think. Florida did open as the favorite to repeat, but the Edmonton Oilers have since overtaken them with retooled offseason acquisitions to remain elite. With big free agency moves in the rear-view mirror, it's unlikely the odds will move much between now and October barring any major splashes.\n\nPrevious Stanley Cup betting action\n\n7/1/2024: The Florida Panthers kicked off their quest to repeat as Stanley Cup champions by inking Sam Reinhart to an eight-year, $69 million deal. Reinhart scored 10 times in the playoffs — including the game-winning goal in Game 7 — and 57 times in the regular season. The Panthers were not the only team in Florida making moves prior to the start of free agency, as the Tampa Bay Lightning acquired the rights to Jake Guentzel from the Carolina Hurricanes and promptly signed him to a seven-year, $63 contract. The move could usher in the end of the Steven Stamkos era in Tampa. Yet those signings hardly moved the needle in the Stanley Cup odds. The biggest movers by far since the end of the Stanley Cup Final were... the Utah Hockey Club (née Arizona Coyotes), who dropped anywhere from 20 to 40 points. The volume of the \"for laughs\" and \"souvenir\" tickets must have been fairly significant.\n\n6/25/2024: The Florida Panthers are Stanley Cup champions. After coming up short vs. the Vegas Golden Knights in 2023, the Panthers nearly coughed up a 3-0 series lead as the Edmonton Oilers stormed back to force a Game 7. Florida held firm as netminder Sergei Bobrovsky stopped 23 of 24 shots in the 2-1 win. Books are bullish on the Cats' chances next year, too, listing them around +900 to go back-to-back. At DraftKings, they share favorite status with the Dallas Stars but are alone in the top spot at FanDuel with the Colorado Avalanche and Carolina Hurricanes next in line. While it's a disappointing end for the Oilers, they're not expected to recede into the background as books have them between +950 and +1,000 to become the first Canadian team since 1993 to win the Cup. These lines are virtually identical to where they were entering Game 7, though some slight movement has occurred below the top teams. The Ottawa Senators were listed at 40/1 before they acquired goaltender Linus Ullmark from the Boston Bruins. Now, they're trading between 32/1 and 35/1. Ullmark gives the Sens a legitimate No. 1 netminder ahead of a do-or-die season for the current core. The NHL Entry Draft will kick off on Friday, June 28 with free agency following on July 1.\n\n2023-24 Stanley Cup odds over time\n\nHere is a look at how the 2023-24 Cup odds have played out so far! Follow each team's journey with our Stanley Cup Playoffs bracket.\n\nStanley Cup betting trends\n\nHere are some trends you may want to consider before placing a bet on the Stanley Cup.\n\nRepeat winners are more common than you think. Since 2010, the Pittsburgh Penguins and Tampa Bay Lightning successfully defended their Cup once.\n\nTop teams from the beginning of the year typically go on to win the Cup. Since 2010, just five teams with odds above +1,000 have gone on to hoist Lord Stanley.\n\nIn the last 10 seasons the Western Conference has won six championships to the East's four.\n\nThe President’s Trophy winner has gone on to win the Stanley Cup just eight times in the 35 years that both trophies have been awarded.\n\nA team has won 2+ consecutive Stanley Cups 15 times, most recently the Tampa Bay Lightning in 2020 and 2021.\n\nThe runners-up have gone on to win the Stanley Cup in the following season only once since 1990 (Pittsburgh Penguins 2009).\n\nStanley Cups won by division\n\nIn the 2013-14 season, the NHL opted to move to a four-division league. This is the number of Stanley Cup winners per division since the switch.\n\nPast Stanley Cup winners\n\nHere are the last 15 winners of the Stanley Cup, their odds of winning just before the playoffs began (courtesy of Sports Odds History), and the team that lost in the Stanley Cup Finals.\n\nAs the Lightning appear set to fade a bit, the Panthers have reached consecutive Cup Finals and are favored to do it again next year.\n\nNHL teams with the most Stanley Cups\n\nThe Habs have a comfortable lead in the clubhouse but haven't hoisted Lord Stanley's Cup since 1993.\n\nHow to read Stanley Cup odds\n\nSportsbooks will post NHL futures odds before the season starts — including odds to win the Stanley Cup. These odds are constantly adjusted throughout the offseason as players get hurt, suspended or are traded. Once the regular season begins, title odds will change daily as teams win and lose games and as more players get hurt, suspended or traded. Sportsbooks will also adjust the NHL futures odds based on handle and liability to certain teams.\n\nStanley Cup odds will usually look like this:\n\nColorado Avalanche +550\n\nThis means that on a $100 bet, you'll stand to win $550 if the Avs win the Stanley Cup. If it's close to the end of the regular season or even during the playoffs and the NHL has a very dominant team, you might see that a team is has a minus sign (-) ahead of its odds.\n\nTampa Bay Lightning -120\n\nThis means that you would need to bet $120 to win $100 on a Lightning Stanley Cup win.\n\nAbove we have posted the American odds for the Stanley Cup. However, these are easy to convert to decimal odds or fractional odds with our odds converter tool.\n\nBest NHL betting sites\n\nScouting NHL betting websites should be a breeze, but new bettors often feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of options available. Here are the must-have NHL betting site features you should target before placing your wagers.\n\nBest odds: Not all sportsbooks are created equally, especially when it comes to odds. Finding the best price for your hockey bets is key to a successful betting strategy.\n\nLive betting: Watching betting lines move in real-time and comparing statistics allows you to jump into the action at just the right moment.\n\nFast payouts: Accessing your hard-earned funds shouldn't feel more intense than Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Final. It's important to choose a sportsbook that offers fast and reliable money withdrawals post game.\n\nSafe money transactions: The days of placing bets with bookies in shadowy back rooms are long over. Major online sportsbooks boast state-of-the-art security measures like SSL data encryption, and each holds a legal operating license from registered authorities.\n\nBest NHL betting promos\n\nBetting boosts are special promotions offered by legal sports betting sites that increase the odds for a specific game, event, or prop, designed to give you better value on your bets or encourage you to sign up for a new sportsbook with unique rewards and offerings.\n\nThey can be a great way for bettors to get better value for their wagers, as the odds are temporarily increased, thereby increasing a potential payout. The promotions are usually limited to a specific period and are subject to terms and conditions, so it's always important to read the fine print for more details.\n\nTypes of odds boosts\n\nThere are a number of different types of betting boosts available, with some targeting specific games, some aimed at specific leagues, and some just enticing users to try a new sportsbook. Here are the most common types of betting boosts:\n\nOdds boost: When a sportsbook enhances the value of a specifically chosen player prop or a curated parlay/SGP, offering better odds than if you normally bet or created the wager yourself.\n\nProfit boosts: When you are given a token that increases the value of any bet you want (such as a 25% boost on one Super Bowl bet). Sometimes these tokens are for all bets, while sometimes they have specific criteria (such parlays/SGPs only or bets above a certain price).\n\nSign-up offers: Operators offer benefits such as free bonus bets after your first wager, bonus bets offered as insurance if your first bet loses, an initial account deposit match, or even giving you discounts on other services for signing up with a sportsbook.\n\nIf you're in a state that allows mobile, online betting, make sure you know which sites are the best hockey betting sites. The best betting sites offer sharp odds, quick payouts and are safe and secure when it comes to depositing and withdrawing your money.\n\nStay updated with the latest picks, odds, and news!
