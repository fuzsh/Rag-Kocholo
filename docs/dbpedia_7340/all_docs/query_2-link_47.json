        "text": "It’s the burning question on the mind of every red-blooded Penguins fan. Do our guys have the stuff to three-peat?\n\nWhile there are tons of issues to consider, I decided to depart from my more traditional analysis and zero in on four factors as a way of evaluating our chances—offensive rank, power-play rank, defensive rank and penalty-kill rank.\n\nThe results are intriguing.\n\nOFFENSE\n\nIn Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Phil Kessel, the Pens boast three of hockey’s supreme talents, not to mention big-game performers. Spread out over three separate lines, as coach Mike Sullivan is wont to do? I don’t envy opposing coaches, nor the matchup nightmares they face.\n\nBlend in net-front wrecker Patric Hornqvist, who’s positively on fire, and a cast of secondary scorers including newcomer Derick Brassard, Jake Guentzel and Bryan Rust, the black-and-gold forwards take a back seat to no one.\n\nNor does it hurt to have the league’s top power play, which clicked at a scalding 26.2 percent during the regular season.\n\nSince the Pens are clearly banking on offense—fourth-best in the league—to outscore the opposition, I wanted to see how critical a super-charged attack is to capturing a Stanley Cup. Here’s a glance at the offensive rank of the past 10 champions.\n\nGOALS FOR RANK Season Team Rank Season Team Rank 2016-17 Penguins 1st 2011-12 Kings 29th 2015-16 Penguins 3rd 2010-11 Bruins 8th 2014-15 Blackhawks 16th 2009-10 Blackhawks 3rd 2013-14 Kings 25th 2008-09 Penguins 4th 2012-13 Blackhawks 2nd 2007-08 Red Wings 3rd\n\nClearly a case of different strokes for different folks. While a high-powered offense certainly won’t hurt your chances of hoisting a Cup, the tight-checking Kings won a pair of titles with an offensively challenged group, as did the ’14-15 Blackhawks. So the ability to fill the other guy’s net isn’t necessarily the be-all and end-all.\n\nNow for the power play.\n\nPOWER PLAY RANK Season Team Rank Season Team Rank 2016-17 Penguins 3rd 2011-12 Kings 17th 2015-16 Penguins 16th 2010-11 Bruins 20th 2014-15 Blackhawks 20th 2009-10 Blackhawks 16th 2013-14 Kings 27th 2008-09 Penguins 20th 2012-13 Blackhawks 19th 2007-08 Red Wings 3rd\n\nFrankly, I was shocked to discover that possessing a potent power play seems to have little or no bearing on a team’s chances of hoisting Lord Stanley’s coveted silverware.\n\nHopefully, not a bad omen for our boys.\n\nDEFENSE\n\nThe Pens have demonstrated the past two seasons that you don’t need to be the best defensive team to win a Cup. However, you do need to be able to keep the other team off the scoreboard, at least to a degree. I’m worried about the Pens’ ability to do that.\n\nHere’s look at the defensive rank of Stanley Cup champions going back to 2007-08. The results are eye-popping.\n\nGOALS AGAINST RANK Season Team Rank Season Team Rank 2016-17 Penguins 17th 2011-12 Kings 2nd 2015-16 Penguins 6th 2010-11 Bruins 3rd 2014-15 Blackhawks 1st 2009-10 Blackhawks 5th 2013-14 Kings 1st 2008-09 Penguins 18th 2012-13 Blackhawks 1st 2007-08 Red Wings 1st\n\nThe only club to capture a Cup with a defensive rank outside of the top five in my sample set? You guessed it…our Pens. We’ve done it three times.\n\nStill, with our leaky 20th ranked defense, it seems our guys are pushing their luck this time around.\n\nOn to the penalty killing.\n\nPENALTY KILLING RANK Season Team Rank Season Team Rank 2016-17 Penguins 21st 2011-12 Kings 4th 2015-16 Penguins 5th 2010-11 Bruins 16th 2014-15 Blackhawks 10th 2009-10 Blackhawks 4th 2013-14 Kings 11th 2008-09 Penguins 8th 2012-13 Blackhawks 3rd 2007-08 Red Wings 8th\n\nOkay, so having an airtight penalty kill isn’t especially crucial to postseason success. Still, the Pens’ 17th ranked PK leaves a lot to be desired. Keep in mind our best shorthanded work occurred prior to the trade-deadline departure of Ian Cole.\n\nWhich leads me to my deepest, darkest concern. Minus Cole, the Pens are…in my humble opinion…a d-man short. When you factor in Kris Letang’s thoroughly uneven play, never mind the inevitable injuries? Not matter how you slice it, we don’t have a Cup-worthy ‘d.’\n\nSame with our goaltending.\n\nTrue, Matt Murray still possesses the wonderful bend-but-not-break quality that helped stake us to back-to-back Cups. However, there’s no Marc-Andre Fleury waiting in the wings should he falter. Not that I mind Casey DeSmith…the kid’s reasonably cool under fire. But ‘Flower’ he ain’t.\n\nSo How About the Flyers?\n\nNo longer a holy terror, the once ferocious Flyers have followed our lead under scholarly coach Dave Hakstol. And there’s no question Philly boasts some elite talent in forwards Sean Couturier, Claude Giroux and Jake Voracek and mobile young defensemen Shayne Gostisbehere and Ivan Provorov.\n\nAll that flash can’t conceal a weak underbelly…the lack of a go-to goalie…a flaw the Pens exploited to the tune of 20 goals in four regular-season meetings between the former blood rivals.\n\nWhile I look for an entertaining series, we should have more than enough to dispatch Philly. After that, our fate’s going to depend heavily on favorable matchups.\n\nWe’ll take it one series at a time.\n\nPenguins in six."
