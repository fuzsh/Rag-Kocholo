        "text": "CLOQUET ― As the 2016 NHL Entry Draft creeps closer and closer, more and more mock drafts flood the internet every day trying to predict who goes when and where.\n\nWill the Toronto Maples Leafs take Auston Matthews of Scottsdale, Ariz., with the first overall pick Friday at the First Niagara Center in Buffalo, N.Y., as many have predicted?\n\nIs incoming Minnesota Duluth forward Riley Tufte a first-round pick, or will he slip to Saturday and go in the second round?\n\nMinnesota Wild prospect Mario Lucia’s answer to both questions would be that it doesn’t matter.\n\n“It’s not about where you get drafted. It’s about what you do after and how hard you work,” said Lucia, who was selected in the second round, No. 60 overall, in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft in St. Paul.\n\nLucia and 2013 Wild draft choice Kurtis Gabriel, along with Fox Sports North’s Mike Greenlay and Wes Walz, were at Northwoods Arena on Tuesday afternoon as part of the three-day Minnesota Wild Road Tour.\n\nWild prospects Jordan Schroeder and Mike Reilly, as well as Wild radio personalities Tom Reid and Kevin Falness, will be at Kerry Park Arena in International Falls from 11:30 a.m.-12:30 p.m. and at Miners Memorial Building in Virginia from 4-5 p.m. today as part of the Northern leg. On Thursday, they’ll be at Whiteside Park in Ely from 11 a.m.-noon and at Thomas Owens Park in Two Harbors from 4-5 p.m.\n\nSchroeder is a former first-round draft pick of the Vancouver Canucks. He was taken No. 22 overall in 2009 but allowed to leave for the Wild in free agency in 2014. Reilly, who like Schroeder played at the University of Minnesota, went in the fourth round in 2011 to the Columbus Blue Jackets, but declined to sign with them and instead used a loophole to go to the Wild.\n\nReilly played 29 NHL games his rookie year in 2015-16. Schroeder has played in 112 career NHL games in four seasons, but he’s only played more than 29 games in a season once - his rookie year in 2012-13.\n\n“It’s wherever you end up in the end,” Gabriel, a native of Newmarket, Ontario, who played four years of major juniors in Canada with Owen Sound, said about the draft. “Personally, I was never drafted to the Ontario Hockey League. It was a pretty big honor to me being undrafted before and being drafted by the NHL.”\n\nGabriel went undrafted the first two years he was eligible for the NHL Draft in 2011 and 2012. He said he had no business being drafted those years after totaling just five goals and 16 assists as a 17- and 18-year-old.\n\nIt wasn’t until he asked for more playing time as a 19-year-old going into his third season of major juniors that things started to turn around. Gabriel tallied 13 goals and 15 assists playing on the Owen Sound third line. The Wild drafted him later that summer in the third round, No. 81 overall, in what he called a surreal experience because he didn’t know he was still draft eligible.\n\nAfter playing one more year in Canada and all of 2014-15 with the Wild’s American Hockey League affiliate, the Iowa Wild, Gabriel made his NHL debut on Nov. 10, 2015 against Winnipeg. He returned for the Stanley Cup playoffs, where he appeared in four of the six games against the Dallas Stars.\n\n“The NHL (draft) is a lot different than any other sport because it’s based off potential,” Lucia said. “Getting drafted is a cool experience, but it’s what you do after that to set yourself up for hopefully having success in the NHL. The NHL Draft is a marathon, not a sprint.”\n\nMario Lucia, the son of Gophers coach Don Lucia, was drafted after his junior year of high school. Instead of playing another season at Wayzata, though, he opted to play one year of juniors in the British Columbia Hockey League with Penticton.\n\nHe then spent four seasons at Notre Dame where he amassed 61 career goals and 48 career assists. On April 1, after the Fighting Irish’s season had ended, Lucia finally made his professional debut - five years after he was drafted - with Iowa. He played nine games, totaling two goals and two assists.\n\nThe 22-year-old, 6-foot-3, 205-pound forward is expected to be back in Iowa to start 2016-17. He’s hoping to eventually crack the Wild’s NHL roster, focusing his offseason training on being more explosive when it comes to his first few steps. It’s something he noticed watching the Pittsburgh Penguins win the Stanley Cup this year.\n\nLucia is trying to find that explosiveness back home where it all started, where the Wayzata junior was drafted - back home at Don and Joyce’s home in Plymouth, Minn.\n\n“My mom and dad enjoy it,” Lucia said about living back home. “My mom does my laundry. Parents cook me dinner every night. It’s free. I’ve been gone the last four years. It’s good to spend some time with them every night.”\n\n2016 NHL Entry Draft\n\nWhen: First round Friday; rounds 2-7 Saturday\n\nWhere: First Niagara Center, Buffalo, N.Y.\n\nEligibility: Players born between Jan. 1, 1996 and Sept. 15, 1998 and undrafted non-North Americans born in 1995\n\nWild picks: No. 15 (first round); 106 (fourth); 196 and 204 (seventh)"
