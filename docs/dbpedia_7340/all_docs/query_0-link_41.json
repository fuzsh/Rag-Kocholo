        "text": "Erik Foley, Jordan Greenway, and Caleb Jones received early Christmas presents Saturday – roster spots on the U.S. team that will compete in the International Ice Hockey Federation World Junior Championship.\n\nWith its final roster announcement, USA Hockey will skate one of the most diverse teams in the 10-nation tournament that begins Monday in Toronto and Montreal.\n\nThe three American players join Team Canada’s Mathieu Joseph and Team Sweden’s Oliver Kylington members of the diverse National Hockey League draft class of 2015 who will represent their countries in the tournament.\n\nFoley, a Winnipeg Jets third round draft pick, is a forward for Providence College Friars of Hockey East. A sophomore, Foley leads the team in scoring with 7 goals and 8 assists in 15 games.\n\nGreenway, a Minnesota Wild second round draft pick, is a forward for Boston University of Hockey East. The sophomore is the Terriers’ second-leading scorer with 6 goals and 10 assists in 16 games.\n\nJones, an Edmonton Oilers fourth round draft pick, plays defense for the Portland Winterhawks, a major junior team in the Western Hockey League. Jones, the younger brother of Columbus Blue Jackets defenseman Seth Jones, is fifth on the Winterhawks in scoring with 3 goals and 28 assists in 32 games. He’s tenth in scoring among WHL defensemen.\n\nTeam Canada’s Joseph, a Tampa Bay Lightning fourth round selection, is a forward for the Saint John Sea Dogs of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League. He’s the Sea Dogs’ second-leading scorer with 33 goals and 40 assists in 58 games.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nAnd let’s not forget Sweden’s Kylington. When he isn’t wearing his country’s classy Three Crowns jersey, the Calgary Flames second round draft pick skates for the Stockton Heat, the Flames’ American Hockey League affiliate.\n\nKylington is ninth on the Heat in scoring – and second among defensemen – with 4 goals and 9 assists in 25 games. He appeared in one game for the Flames in 2015-16.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nCongratulations to forward Mathieu Joseph, a 2015 Tampa Bay Lightning fourth-round draft pick, for being selected to play for Team Canada in the 2017 International Ice Hockey Federation World Junior Championship.\n\nJoseph, 19, will represent Canada for the first time at any level internationally when he takes to the ice for the tournament that begins December 26 in Toronto and Montreal.\n\nCanada will open with a tough matinee match against Russia at Toronto’s Air Canada Centre while the United States plays Latvia in an evening contest at the arena.\n\nJoseph is the second-leading scorer on the Saint John Sea Dogs of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League with 25 goals and 20 assists in 29 games. The 120th overall pick in the 2015 National Hockey League Draft has scored 80 goals and 91 assists in 176 QMJHL games since the 2013-14 season.\n\nJoseph got an early Christmas present in December when the Lightning signed him to a three-year entry-level contract on the eve of the IIHF tournament.\n\nJoseph’s game is about high energy and enthusiasm – traits he carries on and off the ice. He’s a gregarious personality, something he inherited from his parents.\n\n“I’m a pretty outgoing guy,” he told Canada’s TSN. “Honestly, it’s easy for me to talk. My family has been raised like that. My parents are like that, maybe not as hyper per se, but I”d say they raised me like that.”\n\nJoseph isn’t the only one in his family who was recognized this month for his hockey prowess. His younger brother, defenseman Pierre-Olivier Joseph of the QMJHL’s Charlottetown Islanders, was selected to play in the 2017 Sherwin-Williams CHL/NHL Top Prospects Game in Quebec City on January 30, 2017.\n\nPierre-Olivier Joseph has 4 goals and 23 assists in 32 QMJHL games this season. NHL Central Scouting lists him as a player to watch and projects him to be a second or third-round pick at the 2017 draft to be held June 23-24 at Chicago’s United Center.\n\nUSA Hockey will announce its final 23-man U.S. roster for the IIHF world juniors on Dec. 24. Three players of color who were also chosen in the 2015 draft are in the hunt for roster spots: Caleb Jones, a defenseman for the Western Hockey League’s Portland Winterhawks and an Edmonton Oilers fourth-round pick; Boston University forward Jordan Greenway, a Minnesota Wild second-round draft choice; and Providence College forward Erik Foley, a Winnipeg Jets third-round pick.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nIn summertime, ice hockey rinks become lands of hopes and dreams.\n\nWhile it’s lazy, hazy days outside, can’t-miss prospects and undrafted players are hard at work at training facilities throughout the National Hockey League, hoping to catch a coach’s eye and dreaming of earning a spot on an NHL club or a place in its minor league system.\n\nKeoni Texeira, a defenseman last season for the Western Hockey League’s Portland Winterhawks, was ranked the 143rd-best North American prospect by the NHL’s Central Scouting Service but wasn’t chosen by any team at the 2015 NHL Draft last month.\n\nThe 18-year-old California native’s disappointment from being passed over quickly turned to elation when he received a telephone call from the Washington Capitals inviting him to the team’s development camp as an undrafted free agent.\n\n“The draft obviously didn’t go the way I was hoping for but I’m happy I get a chance to come here. It’s a great opportunity and a Class-A organization,” Texeira said after a vigorous practice session last week at the Capitals’ practice rink in Virginia. “They called me a few hours after the draft. I wanted to come to the Capitals camp because I like their system and I think I would fit great in their system.”\n\nTexeira sored eight goals, 18 assists and had a plus/minus rating of plus-32 in 71 regular season games in 2014-15 for Portland. He tallied two goals, three assists and was a plus-two in 17 playoff games for the Winterhawks.\n\nNot bad for a Fontana, Calif., kid who started out in roller hockey but switched to ice at age six. He got the hockey bug from his Hawaiian father and Canadian mother.\n\n“My grandpa and dad were from the Big Island,” he said. “My dad came over from Hawaii when he was about 10, my mom came over from Canada when she was 14-15 years-old. My dad played roller hockey at the local ice rink with one of our neighbors who was from Toronto. He loved hockey, so he got my dad involved in roller hockey. My dad and mom both loved hockey so they decided to put me in roller hockey, and I loved it.”\n\nTexeira had a solid season in Portland last year, it wasn’t enough to keep the Winterhawks from being ousted from the WHL’s Western Conference Final by the Kelowna Rockets and defenseman Madison Bowey, a top Capitals prospect.\n\nBowey attended Washington’s development camp and Texeira stayed close to him on the ice, hoping to pick up some tips from the organization’s 2013 second-round draft pick.\n\n“He’s been here for a while, knows all the ropes and tricks and he gives out some good advice,” Texeira said with a smile. “Coming into camp, I’m just trying to make a great impression, a good first impression, so it’s great to follow a guy like that.”\n\nWhile Texeira was thrilled to be at the Capitals’ camp, defenseman Dajon Mingo looked like the happiest man at the Kettler Capitals Iceplex whenever he was on the ice. The diminutive Bowling Green State University player, another undrafted invitee, had a perpetual smile on his face, no matter how difficult the drill or strenuous the workout.\n\n“I like to smile, I like to have fun out there,” said Mingo, a Canton, Mich., native. “Without fun, I’m not playing at my best. So I’m always smiling. Even if I mess up, I’m going to smile because I’m going to learn from my mistakes.”\n\nMingo, 25, aspires to go pro, but he’s in no rush. With one more season of eligibility left at Bowling Green, he viewed his attendance at the Capitals camp as an investment for the future.\n\n“Obviously, everyone’s dream is to play in the NHL, but I wouldn’t mind going to the AHL (American Hockey League) and working my way up,” he said. “But I want to finish college first. I have one more year at Bowling Green and after that, we’ll see what happens.”\n\nA lot has already happened in Mingo’s hockey career, a path that’s best described as a series of conversions. Mingo was a figure skater as a child, but switched to hockey when it was suggested that he become his sister’s doubles skating partner.\n\n“It was my sister. If it was someone else, that would have been okay with me,” he said with a laugh. “So I tried out hockey. I already had the speed and all that for hockey. All I needed was to learn how to shoot, stop on my left foot. It took me, maybe, a couple of years to get the puck off the ice. But after that, it came easy.”\n\nInitially, Mingo was a forward, and a pretty good one. He led the United States Hockey League’s Des Moines Buccaneers in goals with 24 in 2010-11 and was tied for second on the team in overall points with 35.\n\nMingo was Bowling Green’s third-leading scorer in 2012-13, his freshman season, with 22 points – eight goals, 14 assists in 41 games. But despite his scoring touch, Mingo’s coach asked him to switch to defense.\n\nThe 5-foot-8 player responded by scoring a goal and nine assists in 39 games last season. He was tied for fourth on the team in blocked shots with 35. In a weekend series against Northern Michigan, he registered a goal, two assists, a plus-four rating, and seven blocked shots.\n\n“To be honest, our coach wanted a better D-corps because we were running low on D,” Mingo said. “After that, I had a good season, so I’m strictly defense now. I like it, I get to see the ice a lot. When I take the puck up from behind the net, I like to look left, right and center, I can see everything.”\n\nBut Mingo admits that he’s still a work in progress on the blue line.\n\n“My positioning, my stick-work and footwork as a defenseman,” he listed as areas that need improvement. “I know I’m good on my feet, but you’re learning in hockey everyday, particularly as a first-year defenseman.”\n\nMingo was surprised that the Capitals invited him to camp, but never asked anyone in the organization why they did.\n\n“No,” he said with that perpetual smile. “I just came.”\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe 2014 National Hockey League Draft concluded Saturday with alums of the Skillz Black Aces youth hockey teams doing the squad’s smiling Afro-man logo proud.\n\nThree Skillz veterans were chosen in the draft Saturday, joining Windsor Spitfires forward Joshua\n\nHo-Sang, who was taken Friday night in the first round with the 28th overall pick by the New York Islanders. The draft began Saturday morning with the Buffalo Sabres choosing Brendan Lemieux, a Skillz alum who’s a forward for the Ontario Hockey League’s Barrie Colts, with the first pick in the second round, the 31st overall pick.\n\nWhile elated to be selected by Buffalo, Lemiuex, the son of former NHLer Claude Lemieux, was disappointed that he wasn’t chosen in the first round, where some mock drafts projected him. Lemieux tallied 27 goals, 25 assists and a whopping 145 penalty minutes in 65 games for Barrie during the 2013-14 season.\n\n“I expected to be a first round pick and never really looked at the second round,” Lemieux told Yahoo Sports. “But that being said, things have a way of working out.”\n\nThe Skillz Black Aces and Black Mafia teams began as Toronto-based summer youth hockey teams coached by Cyril Bollers and comprised of elite, NHL draft-eligible players born between 1995 and 1996 – and almost all of them black. As the program became successful, kids of all colors began filling out the rosters.\n\nAlums include Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds defenseman Darnell Nurse, the Edmonton Oilers’ 2013 first-round pick last summer; Kitchener Rangers forward Justin Bailey, a Buffalo Sabres second-round pick; forward Stephen Harper of the Erie Otters; and Bellville Bulls defenseman Jordan Subban, the Vancouver Canucks’ fourth-round pick and the younger brother of Montreal Canadiens defenseman P.K. Subban and Boston Bruins goaltending prospect Malcolm Subban.\n\nNow add Lemieux, Keegan Iverson, and Jaden Lindo to the list. Iverson, a forward for the Western Hockey League’s Portland Winterhawks, was scooped up by the New York Rangers in the third round with the 85th overall pick. He registered 22 goals, 20 assists and 85 penalty minutes in 67 games for the Winterhawks. Last week, the Minnesota-born Iverson was among 42 players invited by USA Hockey to attend the U.S. National Junior Evaluation Camp, an audition for a roster spot on Team USA for the 2015 International Ice Hockey Federation World Junior Championship tournament.\n\n“Pretty exciting stuff,” Amy Iverson, Keegan’s mother, said in an email message Saturday.\n\nIverson barely had time to celebrate being drafted. He boarded a plane Sunday for the Big Apple to attend the Rangers prospect camp, which runs June 30 to July 4 at Madison Square Garden Training Center.\n\n“With the way the game is going you’ve heard every GM say we want to get bigger and stronger and faster, and that heavy style; well that’s the type of game (Iverson) plays,” Gordie Clark, the Rangers director of player personnel said on the team’s website. (Portland) had a really good team with five really high-skilled players that got most of the ice time. So I think with more ice time available next year (Iverson’s) numbers will go up.”\n\nIverson didn’t attend the draft at Philadelphia’s Wells Fargo Center, preferring to watch at home in St. Louis Park, Minn., with his family. Lindo wasn’t in Philadelphia, either. The forward for the OHL’s Owen Sound Attack was trying to watch the draft on television at home in Ontario, Canada.\n\nFrustrated with the broadcast’s lag in listing drafted players, Lindo switched on his tablet to get more up-to-date results. That’s how he learned he was chosen by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the sixth round with the 173rd overall pick. Lindo was surprised about being selected because he suffered a torn left ACL that curtailed his 2013-14 season at Owen Sound.\n\nThe power forward who lists Philadelphia Flyers forward Wayne Simmonds and Washington Capitals forward Joel Ward as role models, collected 9 goals, 9 assists and 41 penalty minutes in 40 games for the Attack.\n\n“When I saw my name, I just screamed,” Lindo told me. “My mom jumped up and hugged me. I feel amazing, Pittsburgh’s a good organization. I’m going to work harder than before so the (knee) rehab goes well.”\n\nThe Penguins foresee Lindo becoming a Simmonds-like NHL power forward.\n\n“Jaden Lindo is big, good along the wall, heavy on pucks, strong, good on the forecheck…great low game,” Randy Sexton, the Penguins co-director of amateur scouting said on the Penguins official website. “He’ll chip in with some offense, very reliable defensively.”\n\nAny comparisons to Ward and Simmonds, who led the Flyers with 29 goals last season, is fine with Lindo.\n\n“I try to model my game to theirs,” he told the Penguins website. “They’re both strong, physical players. I’m a big, strong winger. I like to use my size and strength to my advantage. I’m physical. I like to separate men off the puck and create room for my teammates.”\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe National Hockey League’s 2014 midterm draft rankings are out and players of color populate the list from top to bottom. Forward Josh Ho-Sang of the Ontario Hockey League’s Windsor Spitfires placed highest – listed as the 18th best North American skater. Forward Keegan Iverson of the Western Hockey League’s Portland Winterhawks ranked 64th among draft-eligible North American players.Forward Jaden Lindo of the OHL’s Owen Sound Attack was graded as the 96th-best North American player. And Cordell James, a forward for the OHL’s Barrie Colts, ranked 126th among North American skaters.\n\nSamuel Bennett, a forward for the OHL’s Kingston Frontenacs topped the list of North American skaters, with 26 goals and 66 points so far this season. Kasperi Kapanen, a forward for KalPa of Finland’s SM-liiga, heads the list of draft-eligible European skaters. He has four goals and four assists.\n\nThe draft will be conducted June 27-28 at the Wells Fargo Center, home of the Philadelphia Flyers. Last year, eight minority players were chosen in the draft. Some hockey experts think this year’s draft could exceed that number.\n\nSome people believe that the offensively-gifted Ho-Sang could be a first or second round pick. He has 19 goals and 32 assists for the Spitfires in 42 games. Craig Button, director of scouting for Canada’s TSN, ranks Ho-Sang 33rd among North Americans and European draft-eligible players.\n\n“I like him as a player,” Chris Edwards, a scout for the NHL’s central scouting bureau told The Windsor Star. “He’s highly-skilled and has a chance to be a good pro.”\n\nBob Boughner, Ho-Sang’s coach at Windsor, agrees but also noted that the young player still has some work to do.\n\n“You can’t teach his skill, but he still has to learn to conform a little and make guys around him better,” Boughner told The Star.\n\nHo-Sang, who’ll turn 18 on Jan. 22, still has some growing up to do. he was scratched for one game this season for what Boughner termed “internal discipline problems.” Ho-Sang told The Star the benching stemmed from being late for a practice.\n\n“I know it could (hurt my draft ranking), but that’s not what bothers me,” he told the newspaper. “It’s the 22 players (teammates) in that room that I let down.”\n\nButton ranks Lindo the 76th best player available. Lindo has nine goals and nine assists in 35 games for the Attack. Iverson, who didn’t make Button’s list, has 10 goals and 11 assists for Portland. James has tallied two goals and three assists in 39 games for the Colts.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
