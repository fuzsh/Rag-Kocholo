As you might imagine, the release of the 2012-13 schedule elicited a lot of reactions from the NHL community. Here’s a sampling of some of the immediate thoughts and facts brought up by hockey writers and staffers on Twitter following the unveiling.

Let’s start out with some good news for the Buffalo Sabres:

“Sabres will play a franchise-low 11 back-to-back sets next year after averaging 20 since 1970 and leading the league in 2010-11 and 2011-12.” -- Buffalo Sabres PR staffer Ian Ott

Of course, not every team will be happy with the schedule and the Pittsburgh Penguins might end up feeling like they got a raw deal:

“Pens start season at home on Oct. 12 against the Islanders. Later in the month, they have a very bizarre 6-game road trip ... Check out this road trip for Pens: at Ottawa, at Washington, at Columbus, at NJ, at Chicago, at Toronto. That makes a lot of sense ... Pens play 12 of 14 games at home late in regular season. Very odd.” -- Josh Yohe of the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review.

The Chicago Blackhawks schedule looks like a bit of a mixed bag. They do have several lengthy road trips ahead of them, as Chris Kuc of the Chicago Tribune pointed out. However, the news isn’t all bad:

"‪#Blackhawks‬' seven-game homestand from Feb. 15-March 1 equals franchise-longs set in 1926-27, 1951-52 and 1969-70.” -- Chris Kuc

The Florida Panthers will also enjoy a lengthy homestand:

"‪#FlaPanthers‬ tie a franchise record with a 7-game homestand, Feb. 24-Mar. 10" -- Florida Panthers’ Official Twitter

Finally, here’s a few minor odds and ends:

“Winnipeg doesn’t make trip to ‪#mnwild‬ this season. So much for the momentum of a great rivalry started last year. Lost a sellout too.” -- Michael Russo of the Minneapolis Star Tribune

“Good news for Sens fans: Of the 6 games vs. Toronto this year, only 2x is it the second of a back-to-back for Ottawa. Happened 6x last year.” -- Sportsnet’s Ian Mendes
