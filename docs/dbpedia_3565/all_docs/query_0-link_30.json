        "text": "Trade is an important engine of economic growth and development. In almost all low- and middle-income countries, trade is part of national development plans. Since 2005 OECD and WTO has brought the development community and the trade community together under the Aid for Trade Initiative, focusing on how development assistance (ODA) help build partnerships with developing countries on investments in infrastructure, productive sectors and trade facilitation. The 9th “Aid for Trade at a Glance Report” was just launched today and is available here: https://lnkd.in/eMriYiqs International trade patterns are changing and the time of hyper-globalization is over. Covid-19 proved to be an eye-opener for companies and governments alike: global value chains need to be more resilient and sustainable. Operating models and sourcing strategies need a make-over. Countries are increasingly focusing on self-reliance and strategic autonomy as core components of their trade strategies and approaches, responding to shifting geopolitical tensions and growing economic uncertainty. The landscape is changing – both the way we trade and what we trade in. Aid in support of international trade must reflect these shifts. Aid for Trade disbursements have never been higher than in 2022, where they reached 51.1 billion USD. But we need more focus, not only on new challenges like digital trade or the greening of trade, but also on the poorest and most vulnerable countries. It is concerning that the increased donor support in 2023 is primarily focused on Asia which increased with 22 %, whereas support for Africa fell by 2,5 %. That trend needs to change - and quickly so, as African countries are still marked by the aftermath of Covid-19 and soaring energy and food prices. Africa still only represent 3 % of global trade. More Aid for Trade support for Africa can help economies grow and exports to be developed from primary products to products with higher value added. This must be on top of the future Aid for Trade priorities.\n\nIn the opening plenary session, global leaders reflected on 18 years of Aid for Trade, an initiative that has unlocked USD 648 billion of investment since 2006 to help developing economies participate more fully in global trade. The discussion focused on how the international community can help lower-income countries tap further trade opportunities. In her opening remarks, Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala recalled that the WTO is marking its 30th anniversary this year, coinciding with the 80th anniversary of the Bretton Woods Conference, which established the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Reflecting on the transformative changes over the decades, DG Okonjo-Iweala highlighted the significant achievements in global trade and economic development. \"One of the most remarkable changes since 1995 is that trade-enabled growth has lifted over 1.5 billion people out of extreme poverty,\" she said. This period also saw low- and middle-income economies nearly double their share in global exports from 16.5% to 32.2%, while the percentage of their populations living on less than US$ 2.15 per day has dropped from 40% to under 11%. Despite these advances, the current global trade landscape faces several challenges. \"We are now in troubled times. We see increasing protectionism, the return of industrial policy, and the shaping of a narrative about trade that casts it as anti-people and anti-planet. We see signs of fragmentation in the trade data, with like-minded countries beginning to trade more with each other than with others that are not so like-minded,\" she said.

The agreement, which came into force in January 2021, aims to create a unified market for goods and services in Africa, encouraging economic integration and sustainable growth on the continent. While many African countries have ratified this historic agreement, the United States has a chance to deepen its economic engagement in Africa by taking full advantage of the benefits offered by the AfCFTA. The AfCFTA intends to eliminate trade barriers between African countries, making it easier to move goods, services, and people across the continent. The United States can benefit from the AfCFTA by gaining access to a market of over one billion consumers, and strengthening its commercial ties with Africa. By leveraging the advantages of the AfCFTA, American companies can expand their presence in the African market, diversify their revenue streams, and tap into new investment opportunities. By investing in key sectors such as energy, information and communication technologies, and agribusiness, U.S. companies can contribute to economic growth and sustainable development in Africa. Although the AfCFTA offers numerous opportunities, there are still challenges to overcome, such as harmonizing trade regulations, facilitating cross-border trade, and building institutional capacity. By working together with African governments and private sector players, the United States can help overcome these obstacles and create a business-friendly environment in Africa. The AfCFTA presents a unique opportunity for the United States to strengthen its economic partnership with Africa and stimulate economic growth on both sides of the Atlantic. By seizing this opportunity and working together to overcome the challenges, the United States and Africa can realize their full potential as trading partners and investors.\n\nLatest from the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa. Essentially, with 40 years to go, progress towards meeting \"Agenda 2063\" goals might need to be accelerated in key areas, especially in intra-African trade. Intra-African trade stands at 13% to 17% of total trade by African countries, significantly lower than in other continents, despite initiatives like the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). To compare, intra-EU trade accounts for 60% to 70% of member states' total trade. Intra-Asian trade makes up 50% to 60% of the continent's total trade. Except for South America which is at around 20%. Imagine what could be if intra-African trade matched Asia's or the EU's. The success of \"Agenda 2063\" will depend on the collective efforts of all African countries, the public and private sectors.\n\ninteresting points: African #integration is in the interest of its trading partners. [S]trategic sequencing [can help] to prioritise the implementation of the AfCFTA [over reciprocal trade agreements with the EU, e.g.]. Africa’s trading partners [should] offer unilateral duty-free, quota-free market access with cumulative #rulesoforigin regime to all African countries for a transitional period, benchmarked against milestones in #AfCFTA implementation and the resulting benefits. #Africa’s small share of #globaltrade flows, at 2.3 per cent in 2020, [...] poses little competitive threat to the commercial interests of countries around the world. [a #WTO waiver on rules of reciprocity should therefore not be an obstacle]. So: A new #trade deal will require a broader framework of trade support, including boosting #investment in non-extractive industries, removing non-tariff barriers, and aligning development aid with trade efforts.\n\nThe International Trade Centre's Executive Director, Pamela Coke-Hamilton, delivered a powerful keynote speech at the African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) annual meetings here in the capital Nassau, The Bahamas. Coke-Hamilton painted a truly remarkable process through which Africa and the Caribbean can work together to elevate trade and investment between the two regions. If Europe can negotiate a reciprocal free trade agreement with small island nations like the Caribbean, why can't Africa do the same? Africa and the Caribbean have shared historical ties, and trade has potential to grow to reach $1.8 trillion annually, according to the yet to be released study by International Trade Centre and African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank). \"The ties between Africa and the Caribbean run deep, and it’s these ties that can and must carry us through some of the biggest threats that we face, especially in today’s polycrisis world.\" Check out more in Africa Finance Today.

Access to new markets, increased revenue, and economic growth are just a few of its promises. However, as with any strategy, relying too heavily on international trade can expose a nation to significant risks that could undermine its long-term prosperity. ✅ External Shocks and Vulnerability One of the main risks of relying too heavily on international trade is the susceptibility to external shocks. A downturn in the global economy, political turmoil in key trading partners, or disruptions in supply chains can have devastating effects on a trade-dependent nation. This vulnerability can leave the country susceptible to economic instability, potentially leading to declines in growth and employment. ✅ Trade Imbalances and Debt Accumulation Trade imbalances, particularly persistent trade deficits, are another concern. When a country imports more than it exports, it must finance the difference, often through borrowing. Over time, this can lead to the accumulation of substantial debts, placing a significant burden on the economy. ✅ Over-Reliance on Specific Sectors Another pitfall is the potential over-reliance on specific export sectors. While specializing in a particular industry can bring short-term gains, it can also leave a nation vulnerable to changes in global demand. If a country's main export sector falls out of favor or faces increased competition, its economy can suffer significantly. ✅ Policy Changes and Interdependence Risks The interconnectedness of the global economy means that a nation's economic prospects are intertwined with those of its trading partners. Changes in trade policies, regulations, or agreements in other countries can have far-reaching effects. This interdependence can make a trade-dependent nation susceptible to external forces beyond its control. ✅ The Importance of Balance International trade is undoubtedly a valuable tool for economic development. However, it is crucial to strike a balance between engaging in international trade and nurturing domestic industries. This diversification can provide a buffer against external shocks, enabling a nation to maintain resilience and pursue sustainable growth. International trade presents significant opportunities but also carries risks, particularly when a nation becomes overly reliant on it. It is essential to adopt a measured approach that leverages the benefits of international trade while also fostering domestic industries and reducing vulnerability to external factors."
