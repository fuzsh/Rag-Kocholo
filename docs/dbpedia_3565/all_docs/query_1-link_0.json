        "text": "An important stop for those wishing to visit the islands of La Maddalena Archipelago: white sandy beaches facing a tropical like sea, high rocky cliffs with a sheer drop to the sea hide quiet little bays, long stretches of sand behind which Mediterranean pine-woods open out. These represent the splendid landscapes which portray the Island of Budelli (like the Pink Beach), the small islands of Santa Maria and the island of Spargi.\n\nA fundamental \"Raid\" in the VIP's paradise, amongst wonderful villas and extremely well-known places, between the contrast of the rocks and the crystalline water of the beaches. It starts with a visit to Baja Sardinia and the characteristic square, around which there are numerous Hotels and friendly bars and boutiques for shopping; Poltu Quatu (=hidden port), recently constructed in 1987 within an inlet of particular rocks; and also the exclusive centre of Porto Cervo, tourist destination of the elite.\n\nArzachena and the Gallura have a very antique history, as the granite rock of the \"Mushroom\" testifies, a likely shelter for the population in the pre-Nuragic era. A few kilometres away you can visit some archaeological sites of particular interest like the Albucciu nuraghe and the giants’ tomb “Coddu 'Ecchiu”, an antique collective burial place for the inhabitants of the area.\n\nInteresting naturalistic excursion starting with the spectacular view of Lake Liscia, a large artificial basin which supplies water to the whole area of the Gallura, arriving at the summit of Mount Limbara. It is an extensive granite complex with numerous species of plants (like the sequoia and the wild rose) and animals (like the Sardinian newt and the golden eagle); furthermore, it dominates the plain of Tempio Pausania, an ancient district of the Gallura, full of monuments, historic centres and ancient churches.\n\nFollowing the road from S. Teresa di Gallura towards Castelsardo, you can admire the panorama which includes the scenographic beaches of the coastline. On arrival in Costa Paradiso, you enter a path in the rocks which dominates Mount Tinnari (m.214); after appreciating the panorama from high up, you descend to the beach of Tinnari, one of the most fascinating in Sardinia, formed of porphyry pebbles extending to the outlet of the Riu Pirastu in an environment of indescribable wild charm.\n\nAdventurous naturalistic excursion through the landscape dominated by the lake which flows into canals and around small islands. The shores, mostly sandy, present small patches of vegetation. Following a charming park with holm oaks and other secular trees as well as animal species like wood pigeons and turtles you can visit the thousand-year old olive trees with magnificent trunks."
