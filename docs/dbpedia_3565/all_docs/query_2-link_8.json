As a result, its towns and culture reflect this mixed heritage beautifully, and its breath-taking landscape seals the deal: it is a truly gorgeous place. For those interested in the great outdoors – be that exploring it, photographing it, or just looking at it – Corsica is an ideal destination and a must-see in France. From craggy peaks lined with hiking routes to water almost too blue to be real, stacked villages backing right up to rugged cliffs to impressive rock formations emerging from the sea, and ancient fortifications and pretty lighthouses lining the coast to painterly sunsets that astound, Corsica is a jewel-box of an island, full of delights and surprises, just waiting to be explored.\n\nAs travel is not possible quite at the moment and we are all long due and in need of a holiday, we thought we'd compile some wonderful photos of beautiful Corsica to help sate your wanderlust (or perhaps stoke it?) and for you to enjoy at home for now so you can compile a list of all of the incredible sights you want to go and see when we are free to move about once more. So, for now, may enjoying these photographs of Corsica in the comfort and safety of your home suffice until you are able to see the majestic beauty of the island for yourself, in person.\n\nStunning Corsica is a little slice of paradise on earth and is filled with gorgeous towns and landscapes and wee surprises dotted all over the place. One such little surprise that you might find yourself stumbling upon is the Staircase of The King of Aragon (or the Escalier du Roi d’Aragon), an incredible stone stairwell carved out of the side of a cliff in Bonifacio. Steep, striking, and extraordinary, it is one of those unique curiosities about a place that one should pop along to and see for themselves while on holidays. If you have found a vacation rental in Corsica and are seeking out everything wonderful and special and unique about this beautiful island, swing by this rather unusual gem.\n\nCorsica is known by many as a perfect destination for those who are interested in a seaside break but, in addition to some of the most dazzling beaches that you have ever seen in your life, this French island in the glittering Mediterranean boasts a lush and diverse landscape of truly breathtaking natural beauty. Those who like to hike, explore, and enjoy a whole range of outdoor pursuits will find themselves well-catered to by a vacation rental in Corsica and a holiday in France spent diving into and wandering this spectacularly lovely part of the world."
