        "text": "Take inspiration from the world‚Äôs first zero waste island Tilos, Dhodhekanisos, Greece@www.tilos.gr. A diminutive Greek island is punching above its weight when it comes to waste management, becoming the world‚Äôs first zero-waste island and completely energy self-sufficient. Before the project began, the island of Tilos sent 87% of its waste to landfill; now 100% of waste is diverted, the island no longer needs rubbish bins and the landfill site has been permanently closed. A new Centre for Creative Upcycling provided a replacement for the landfill; here, items can either be repaired, reused or repurposed into building or art materials. The Just Go Zero project was managed and funded by Polygreen, a Greek company that specialises in circular economy solutions. The first step was to establish an information centre, which allowed the island‚Äôs 745 residents to learn how to sort their waste into three categories: recyclable materials, non-recyclable materials and organic waste. Each household was given its own equipment, including boxes for recyclable and non-recyclable waste, a bag for organic waste and a box for cigarette butts. Regular collections were instated across the island. All waste is taken to the 3K Circular Innovation Centre, which is equipped with high-tech waste handling solutions that can further sort rubbish and send it for recycling or composting. Some waste is used as an alternative fuel for the cement industry. ‚ÄúThe project has brought about transformative positive changes that have had a profound impact on both the environment and the local community,‚Äù said Mayor Maria Kamma-Aliferi. The project has already created new job opportunities related to renewable energy installation and sustainable agriculture. It‚Äôs also attracting a new type of tourist; environmentally-conscious visitors are choosing to holiday here, boosting the local economy. These visitors are also required to take part in the scheme; hotels have special equipment for separating rubbish, and tourists can pick up cloth bags for shopping from the Information Centre. ‚ÄúThe island now stands as a shining example of how sustainable practices can create a harmonious balance between development and nature, ensuring a brighter and more resilient future,‚Äù said Kamma-Aliferi.

The need for sustainable waste solutions has never been more critical. As the second-most populous nation, India‚Äôs approach to waste management holds profound implications for our planet üåé . As part of the Mitigation Action Facility (formerly NAMA Facility) funded project ‚ÄòWaste Solutions for a Circular Economy in India‚Äô, we organised a one-of-its-kind awareness event in #Varanasi to sensitise the public on source segregation. Three unique floating installations, designed in the shape of single-use plastic items namely a pet bottle, tetra pack, and biscuit packet, sailed on the Ganges by the ghats of Varanasi! The message on the art installations appealed to people to use the correct dustbins for waste disposal. To support the installations, volunteers from our project implementation partner, TERI - The Energy and Resources Institute, engaged with people on the importance of source segregation and using the right dustbins to segregate waste, and was met with an enthusiastic response by the public who pledged to practice waste segregation at source and contribute to sustainable #wastemanagement in the city of Varanasi. Key Takeaways and Impact ‚¨á : ‚ôªÔ∏è Widespread public awareness on the importance of source segregation among people who visit the ghats of Varanasi. Around 600,000 people were engaged through these unique floating installations! üöÆ Attention-grabbing and thought-provoking message to inspire people for segregating and using correct dustbins for disposing of waste. Want to know more? Watch our video üìΩ üëâ bit.ly/3PfVg80 The project aims to achieve low-carbon transformation of the Indian waste sector through awareness on waste segregation at source, setting up material recovery facilities, biomethanation and composting facilities as well as scaling-up existing recycling facilities. Through our joint efforts, it is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the waste sector by around 1.2 million tonnes over a period of 5 years. Our project activities contribute to a circular economy, promoting sustainable consumption and production, which are also the focus of the Green and Sustainable Partnership (#GSDP) between India and Germany.

In 2020, 12.7 million tonnes of municipal waste went to landfill in the UK. Waste generates harmful emissions and much of it finds its way into our rivers and oceans doing untold harm to aquatic ecosystems. It‚Äôs time for a new approach. Read our latest article about how The P & M Group is helping address the issue. We are passionate about reducing harmful impacts and finding new ways of working that better meet the needs of people and planet. A key part of that is for manufacturers to design products with resource efficiency in mind and collaborate with supply chains to promote recycling and reuse. We are exploring how to reduce waste through our design processes and are working with customers and suppliers to embrace circularity. The P&M Group is helping keep resources in the value chain by finding new uses for discarded pallets, working with stakeholders to improve the recyclability of packaging, and joining forces with a recycling partner to help us meet our Zero to Landfill goal. Join us on our journey and support the shift to responsible waste management. Address the problem by embracing lower impact working practices and work collaboratively with stakeholders to be part of the solution.

It always seemed like a distant concept for me, something for businesses and policymakers to worry about. But then, entering the world of solid waste management, everything clicked. Right there, in the tireless work of waste pickers, I saw a living, breathing example of the circular economy in action. We talk about jackets made from recycled plastic, recycled paper for packaging ‚Äì all this becomes reality only because of the dedication of waste pickers. These unsung heroes are the backbone of a system that gives waste a new lease on life. Waste pickers are the silent orchestra conductors of the circular economy. By meticulously collecting, sorting, and selling recyclable materials, they act as the first link in the chain, rescuing valuable resources from landfills. This doesn't just reduce the environmental burden ‚Äì it breathes new life into these materials, transforming them into valuable resources for a new generation of products. They also collect waste daily in many cities. While most of us are uncomfortable handling our own generated waste, they collect waste from thousands of households, additionally segregating this unknown waste with meticulous care. But the harsh reality is, these green warriors often fight unseen battles. Their work is physically demanding, a constant strain on their bodies. The stigma associated with it can be crushing, their vital role often dismissed. We must acknowledge this injustice and work towards creating a system that recognizes their worth. The time has come to rewrite the narrative. Let's recognize them not just as waste pickers, but as waste transformers, environmental stewards, and the silent heroes of the circular economy. We must champion their rights, provide them with the well-deserved support, and integrate them formally into waste management systems. Let's empower them, celebrate them, and together, weave a future where their work is not just respected, but celebrated. Because in their tireless efforts lies the key to a world where waste is not burden, it's a resource. The next time you see a waste picker, don't turn a blind eye. See the environmental warrior, the social crusader, the embodiment of the circular economy in action. Let their dedication inspire us to become more responsible citizen, to embrace a future where waste becomes a resource, and where everyone has a dignified role to play in building a more sustainable world. Together we can!

Below is what we can benefit from small actions of waste separation at the household level. 1. By simply sorting our waste into recyclables, organics, and non-recyclables before collection, we unleash positive environmental impacts. 2. We reduce the amount of waste destined for landfills, thereby extending their lifespan and minimizing environmental pollution. 3. By separating recyclable materials, we support recycling industries, conserve natural resources, and reduce energy consumption. 4. Segregating organic waste for composting or anaerobic digestion helps mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and prevents soil and water contamination. 5. Waste segregation promotes environmental awareness and behavior change, empowering individuals to make sustainable choices in their daily lives. Together, through small actions at the household level, we can make a significant difference in building a cleaner, greener future for the planet we're so desirous of. Let's start segregating our waste today for a more sustainable tomorrow.
