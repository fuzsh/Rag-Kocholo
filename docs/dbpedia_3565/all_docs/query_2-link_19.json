        "text": "Ferrari, Trentodoc, NVThe legend of Ferrari began with a man, Giulio Ferrari, and his dream of creating wine in Trentino capable of competing with the best Champagne. He was a pioneer, the first person to realize the extraordinary vocation of the region, and it was he who first made substantial plantings of Chardonnay in Italy. With this profound link to territory and respect for the land in every single operation: all of Ferrari's wines are Trentodoc. They are all produced exclusively from grapes grown in Trentino at high altitudes using sustainable farming methods44\n\nRicci Curbastro, \"Gualberto\", Dossagio Zero, 2013Farming the land for eighteen generations, the family at Ricci Curbastro takes great pride in the grapes they grow and the wine they produce. A founding member of the Franciacorta appellation, they have believed in the power and finesse of the region for as long as it has been recognized. This profound respect for the land and deep care for the fruit shines through in every bottle. They are no strangers to the ageabilty and complexity that Franciacorta can provide - and now neither are you while enjoying this selection240\n\nPol Roger, \"Réserve\", NV\"I cannot live without Champagne. In victory I deserve it; in defeat I need it.\" - Sir Winston Churchill. Pol Roger is an iconic house known for exceptional quality and elegance. With a rich history dating back to 1849, Pol Roger has been enjoyed in celebration and in defeat, as it is known to be the favorite of Sir Winston Churchill. Committed to sustainibility and environmental responsibilty, Pol Roger is focused on traditonal winemaking with a focus on future generations220\n\nMontenidoli, \"Fiore\", 2022The vineyards of Montenidoli are an uncontaminated land, high on the hill, which breathe in the purest air. Elisabetta Fagiuoli has been tending to the land here since 1965 when it was an untamed forest, untouched by man. Throughout her almost 60 years of winemaking here, she can only describe the experience as such: \"I enjoy the truth of other places, but I am in this place and I'm making the wine of this terroir. I don't want to be similar to anybody else. I want to be better than myself.\" The \"Fiore\" cuvée of her signature Vernaccia di San Gimignano is the free run juice that escapes before any grapes are pressed, imprinting the cleanest expression possible82\n\nVigneti Massa,\"Derthona\", 2021In the Colli Tortonesi DOC on the border of eastern Piemonte, Walter Massa single-handedly resurrected the Timorasso variety from extinction. Working in obscurity for years, Massa's determination is driven by his love, passion, and belief in the terroir of the region. Farming around 30 hectares near the partially abandoned hilltop town of Monleale Alto, the variety of the soils in his higher-elevation vineyards inform the complexity of this wine. Although he also produces top wines from Barbera, Nebbiolo, and Freisa as well, his 'Derthona' of 100% Timorasso is a world-class, benchmark example of this unique and beautiful wine120\n\nErmes Pavese, 2022Ermes Pavese is a youthful grower in the commune of La Ruine just outside of the town of Morgex in the high Alps, mere minutes from the summit of Mont Blanc. Pavese works with the native grape known as Prié Blanc. Starting with barely two hectares of vineyards, situated at about 1200 meters above sea level, Pavese has gradually expanded his holdings in this high altitude zone (some of the highest altitudes of vineyards in Europe). He now produces three versions of Blanc de Morgex et de La Salle. Because these vineyards are so isolated, Pavese has been able to work with the original, pre-Phylloxera root stock since that malady never infiltrated this area when it came sweeping through Europe many years ago. The wine is austere, racy, and mineral driven with length120\n\nVenissa,\"Venusa\", 2019Venissa was founded in 2002, when Gianluca Bisol saw a small vineyard in a garden in front of the Santa Maria Assunta Basilica, the oldest church in all of Venice, located on the island of Torcello. His curiosity was piqued and he began to carry out historical and agronomical research on the vines. He discovered that the Venetian islands had an important viticultural tradition up until 1966, the year the great flood destroyed the vineyards, causing all traces of this millennial tradition to be lost. The research he began led to the rediscovery of an indigenous variety, Dorona di Venezia, that had adapted to the salty conditions of the lagoon over the centuries. Thanks to a team of agronomists and experts in lagoon history, the last 88 vine plants that survived the flood were found. In the course of their research the experts met Gastone, a farmer who produced a small amount of wine for his family and used the traditional winemaking methods of the lagoon, including the long skin maceration that give Dorona its impressive longevity240\n\nTorre dei Beati, \"Giocheremo\", Pecorino, 2022Located between the town of Pescara and the highest peak in the Apennine Mountains in the Abruzzo region, the estate derives its name 'Tower of the Blessed' from a 14th century mural in the local church. Fausto Albanese and his family believe that the beauty and quality of a wine cannot be separated from the vineyard. Certified organic since 2000, Albanese's ethos is a firm commitment to quality, producing wines from hand-harvested grapes which are selected using the strictest criteria. His 'Giocheremo' Pecorino is the result of many pickings in the vineyard, crafting the wine to express varietal purity in addition to six months on the lees. He and his family believe in leaving a lasting legacy of respect and care for the land for future generations and for the region68\n\nMastroberardino, 2008The Mastroberardino family are largely responsible for the revival and elevation of Irpinian and Campanian winemaking post WWII. Working primarily with Campania's ancient native varietals such as Fiano, Greco, and Aglianico, Mastroberardino has resuscitated into world class wines. One such example is Greco, a clone of the ancient Greco Bianco grape which was brought to Campania from Thessaly in Greece in the first century BC. It's named after the town of Tufo in Avellino where the grape thrives in soft volcanic rock that makes up the subsoil of the region. This rock imparts crystalline minerality to the wine's profile, and it is one of few white wines from the area with excellent aging potential84\n\nSurrau, \"Sciala\", 2021'Gallura' translates to 'stony area' - and the granite-dominant soils of the Vermentino di Gallura DOCG on the windswept northeastern corner of Sardegna makes for one of the most important sites for Vermentino. Taking its name from the Surrau valley, the Demuro family have been making wine for generations. Nestled amongst rugged hills and near the Costa Smeralda, Tino Demuro and his team cultivate 20 hectares exclusively to Vermentino. The cuvée name 'Sciala' has its origins in Arabic, referring to generous fruit and an abundant harvest. With the grapes sourced and blended from his best sites, Demuro wishes to tell the story of the sun, sea, and wind of Gallura84\n\nFèlsina,\"Rancia\", 2019In 1966, Domenico Poggiali Fèlsina realized the potential for quality Sangiovese in Chianti. With estates that have a history of viticulture dating back thousands of years, Fèlsina developed a team committed to quality and with a respect for tradition. The unique variety and complexity of the many clones of Sangiovese developed over decades in the vineyards are reflected in the quality, balance, consistency, and style of the final wines. The 'Rancia' vineyard takes its name from the historic Rancia farmhouse which was once a Benedictine monastery. Respect for tradition and the embrace of modern techniques makes this one of the finest examples of Chianti Classico Riserva in the region180\n\nDonatella Cinelli Colombini, 2019A story centuries long, where the lives of heretics, jurists, men of the church and grape growers entwine. With the oldest part of the estate being an underground cavern described in 12th century texts, it now houses the precious collection of Donatella's early bottles of Brunello di Montalcino. Donatella's paternal forefathers built the Fattoria and one of them went on to be Pope Pius II. Since the 16th century it has never been sold, it has always been handed down from mother to daughter. Currently, the winery and Castato is fully operated by an all female staff320\n\nLe Macchiole, \"Rosso\", 2021Le Macchiole makes some of the most sought-after monovarietal wines from Syrah, Merlot, and Cabernet Franc in the world. With a commitment to organic and practicing biodynamic farming, terroir expression, refinement and elegance, Cinzia Merli and her two sons Elia and Mattia make some of the finest wines from the Bolgheri region of Tuscany. Manually harvested and carefully sorted from small vineyard plots with an attention to nuance and subtlety, this gorgeous blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, and Syrah is an elegant introduction to what they do best.130\n\nAvignonesi, 2019Avignonesi's mission is to assume leadership in the context of the \"good wine industry\". An ecosystem built on organic and biodynamic agriculture, sustainable distribution systems, and consumer education. The development of the winery, founded on the production of wine, also extends to their hospitality. The Ancient Greeks would have defined this approach to wine making with the words \"kalòs kagathòs:\" the beautiful and the good. Two virtues together that speak of a profound coherence of soul, uniting qualities that if separated, undermine the very existence of the winery and its people. This ancient concept encapsulates Avignonesi today: working with determination to act in a \"noble way\", as well as being producers of the \"Nobile\"84\n\nMalvirá, 2013When Giuseppe Damonte started to produce wine in the 50's at the family winery, he had a dream: to bottle the soul of the land that he loved, to be discovered sip by sip. In 1989, the winery Malvirà was moved to the current location at the foot of the S.S. Trinità vineyard and taken over by Giuseppe's grandchildren. Although the family is famous for their beautiful Roero wines, this small vineyard at the limit of Brunate fell into their capable hands. It was thanks to their older sister Gianna, and her marriage to a man from La Morra, that they became owners of a small piece of land in Barolo where these grapes are grown260\n\nCascina Baricchi, \"Rose delle Casasse\", 2016Cascina Baricchi is a unique estate in that, to our knowledge, is the only producer of a Barbaresco made one hundred percent from the Nebbiolo Rosé clone. Half of the vineyard's vines in Neive date back to 1913, and Nebbiolo vines this old are almost non-existent. This wine is truly a treasure of the area. The winery itself is in a small village called Neviglie which is actually just outside of the official Barbaresco zone, though given the quality of the vineyards and their historical importance, Baricchi is grandfathered in to be allowed to bottle his wine as Barbaresco240\n\nVallana, 2019A pioneer in the region that put Gattinara on the map, Antonio Vallana and his 17 year-old son Bernardo started the winery in 1937 in the town of Maggiora 100 miles northeast of the Langhe. Nebbiolo, known here as Spanna, finds incredible expression in Alto Piemonte, with Bernardo making world-class wines that rival the best of Barolo and Barbaresco. The sixth generation of Francis and Marina Fogerty carry on the tradition of sustaining family traditions and a commitment to excellence, regardless of trends. The single village appellation of Gattinara DOCG sits on a unique UNESCO geo-site of ancient volcanic soils, creating exceptional conditions for viticulture. The Vallanas believe their wines and others from Alto Piemonte to be \"unum, verum, bonum\" - one, true, and good140\n\nPrà, \"Morandina\", 2017Graziano Pra had a calling to become a vine grower, and it's a road he followed with commitment and honesty. He says: \"I admire wine, I respect it, and try to bring out what is already written in the soil it is born in and grows in. For me, this interpretation of wine was part of a long road, along which my point of reference was the modern sense of a vine grower: the person oversees and manages each step of the wine, from its transformation, and finally to its enjoyment240\n\nNino Negri, 2019In the amphitheater of the steep terraced slopes facing the majestic Alps in the Lombardia region, the Nino Negri family have been making concentrated, yet elegant wines from Nebbiolo for over 125 years. The grapes - here called Chiavennasca - receive intense sunlight and the 'Breva' wind sweeps the Adda Valley from Lake Como, allowing for full ripening and fresh fruit in these thousand year-old stone terraces. Hand harvested with scrupulous care, the grapes are dried through the autumn and winter, pressed, and then aged in French oak barrels. This process reveals one of the most singular and unique expressions of Nebbiolo in the world. As one of Italy's most decorated estates, Nino Negri's benchmark Sforzato di Valtellina is recognized around the world for its high quality, power, and finesse180\n\nMoschioni, 2009\"To grow, to give, to be.\" Winemaker Michele Moschioni's statement of purpose informs the generosity with all that he does on his family estate of many generations in the Colli Orientali del Friuli DOC in northeastern Italy. Using organic, hand-harvested grapes with indigenous yeasts, Michele and his son Valentino, wife Sabrina, and daughter Alessia insist on the importance and toughness of family to produce world-class wines that have no equal. Setting a new standard for quality and terroir expression with the Schioppettino grape, Michele is a trailblazer in the region, recognized the world over. When it comes to their commitment to quality, Michele has two words: \"No compromise\"130\n\nCantina Fratelli Pardi, \"Sacrantino\", 2016Cantina Fratelli Pardi's story begins in 1919 with three brothers, Alfredo, Francesco and Alberto. The winery was, then, located on the ground floor of the San Marco Hospital that resided within Saint Francis in Montefalco. White and red wines were both produced, but it was the Sagrantino based wines that became the stars of the region. These wines were sold all over Umbria, and eventually all over Italy, even to eminent places such as the Vatican. In 2002 the founders' great grandsons, driven by the will of the Pardi family to keep tradition, restored the building in Montefalco and revived their great-grandfathers' winery. Today the brothers Alberto Mario and Gianluca Rio, with their enthusiasm and hard work, are the new era of the Pardi wine's legacy160\n\nRe Manfredi, 2018On the slopes of the extinct Monte Vulture volcano which rises to 4,300 feet in the region of Basilicata, the Re Manfredi estate sits on some of the most unique volcanic soils in continental Europe. Considered a benchmark producer in the region, the Montrone family have been making some of the top expressions of Aglianico since 1998. In addition to the warm, dry climate, the volcanic terroir imparts a minerality to the wine not found elsewhere in Italy. Sourced from over 50 hectares of estate vineyards of over 30 yearold vines, Re Manfredi has been recognized internationally for its quality and unique expression of Aglianico110\n\nAzienda Agricola COS, 2020Seeking to respect the land with humility, hard work, and patience, three friends founded Azienda Agricola COS in 1980 and were the youngest wine producers in Italy: Giambattista Cilia, Cirino Strano and Giusto Occhipinti. They received an old family winery from Giambattista Cilia's father Giuseppe Cilia and the nearby vineyard of bush trained vines in the famed town of Bastonaca. In 2005, they made the first wine that bore the Denominazione d'Origine Controllata e Garantita (D.O.C.G.) designation, the only one in Sicily. Today, COS is associated not only with the success of Cerasuolo di Vittoria but also with rigor and quality. The region was reborn, and the area around Vittoria is thriving with its extraordinary wines110\n\nVilla Calcinaia, 2013This bottling of Villa Calcinaia's Vin Santo is as powerful as it is seductive and as indulgent as it is pleasurable. Best enjoyed with a few years of age, the stellar 2013 vintage is showing beautiful depth in the glass. The Capponi family has been working this land continually since the 1500's. They are committed to traditional values, while using modern practices for the best possible results: both for the wine and for the EarthGlass 49Bottle 190\n\nMontevertine, \"Le Pergole Torte\", Toscana, 2019\"Le Pergole Torte\" is possibly Tuscany's most famed Sangiovese wine. Ironically, even though it is made within a well-known appellation like Chianti Classico, it doesn't wear the DOCG \"fascetta\" seal or the historical black rooster emblem. Sergio Manetti, the owner of the Montevertine estate, was ahead of his time. In the 70's and 80's, the Chianti region was nowhere close to wanting to let go of age-old traditions (blending white varietals with Sangiovese), yet suffered from an ever-worsening poor reputation. With this, Sergio voiced that Sangiovese could be made as a single varietal wine. He was booed by this rebellious notion and had to carry on without the consensus of his peers. He left the Chianti appellation in 1981 and continued his pursuit to produce fine wine using only his own small farm's brand. This quest paid off as his pure Sangiovese \"Le Pergole Torte\" became a cult phenomeon. Sergio passed away in 2001 and his son Martino continues his father's legacy today2200"
