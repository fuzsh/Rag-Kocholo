        "text": "Valpolicella Rocks: Tenuta Sant'Antonio\n\nNow approaching a 30-year milestone in the history of the Tenuta Sant'Antonio, the Castagnedi brothersâ€™ dream is alive and well in the hills above Verona, known worldwide as the City of Love. Not far from the vineyards where the brothers played as children, they took the far-sighted decision to purchase land in the rugged and steep Monti Garbi, now an agricultural site renowned for innovative wine growing."
