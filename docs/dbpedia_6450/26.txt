Depending on your point of view, James Toback's Fingers from 1978 is either one of the great US independent films of the 1970s or a sprawling and incoherent mess. Fingers is the movie in which Harvey Keitel plays a tormented would-be concert pianist whose day job is collecting debts for his mobster father.
