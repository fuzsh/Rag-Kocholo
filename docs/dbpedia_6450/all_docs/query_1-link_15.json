And I deserved not to tell anyone,” she said.\n\nToback has been active as a writer and director since the mid 1970s, and titled his semi-autobiographical 1987 film The Pick-Up Artist. His most recent film, The Private Life of a Modern Woman, stars British actress Sienna Miller.\n\nIn 2008, he directed the documentary Tyson, which took a sympathetic look at the boxer and convicted rapist Mike Tyson. He also wrote the film Seduced and Abandoned, featuring a look at how Hollywood films are financed.\n\nAs with Weinstein – who continues to deny that he had non-consensual sexual contact with any of his accusers – Toback’s behaviour is said to have been something of an open secret in Hollywood, with rumours of his behaviour reported in celebrity gossip columns as far back as 1989.\n\nLouise Post, now a guitarist and vocalist for indie rock band Veruca Salt, said she met the writer in 1987 when she was a 20-year-old student.\n\n“Going to his apartment has been the source of shame for the past 30 years, that I allowed myself to be so gullible,” she said.\n\nIn the wake of the Weinstein scandal, many women have shared tales of sexual harassment – from being harassed on the street to serious sexual assaults including rape, using the hashtag #metoo.\n\nThe Veruca Salt account tweeted: “Us too: by bosses, boyfriends, male babysitters, taxi drivers, strangers and movie director/pig #jamestoback #metoo.”\n\n“James Toback damn you for stealing, damn you for traumatizing,” one of Weinstein’s most prominent accusers, Rose McGowan, tweeted on Sunday.\n\nWeinstein accuser Asia Argento wrote on Twitter following the allegations against Toback: “So proud of my sisters for bringing down yet another pig.“\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
