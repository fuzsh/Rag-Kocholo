        "text": "In the days after more than 30 women alleged that the movie director James Toback had sexually harassed or assaulted them, hundreds more have reportedly made similar accusations.\n\nAmong those who went public this week were the actors Julianne Moore, Selma Blair and Rachel McAdams.\n\nOn Sunday, The Los Angeles Times reported that 38 women had accused Mr. Toback, a director and screenwriter who worked on movies including “Bugsy” and “Two Girls and a Guy,” of harassment.\n\nThe women’s stories were similar. They included allegations that Mr. Toback tried to impress them by talking about his work and, in many cases, invited them to hotel rooms where he told them to take off their clothes.\n\nSome of the women accused Mr. Toback, 72, of rubbing his groin against them or masturbating while forcing them to look him in the eye.\n\nGlenn Whipp, who wrote Sunday’s article for The Times, reported on Monday that hundreds of women were reaching out to the newspaper with new allegations. He added that their stories were unverified.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
