        "text": "Just a week after the viral #MeToo campaign, another Hollywood boss has been accused of sexual harassment spanning decades.\n\nThis time, The Los Angeles Times has reported that writer and director James Toback has sexually harassed 38 women.\n\nIt has been alleged that he approached both young and upcoming actresses, talking up his connections and access to big names.\n\nThe meetings, sometimes billed as auditions, would often end with either questions of a personal or sexual nature or with Toback masturbating in front of them, or dry-humping them.\n\nHe has denied the allegations.\n\nSo, who is he?\n\nWhile less known than producer Harvey Weinstein, Toback has had a four-decade long career in Hollywood.\n\nHe is best known for writing the 1991 film Bugsy — starring Hollywood stalwart Warren Beatty — which scored him an Oscar nomination.\n\nHe has worked with several big Hollywood names through his writing and directing, including Mark Wahlberg (The Gambler), Robert Downey Jr and Molly Ringwald (The Pick-up Artist) and Harvey Keitel (Fingers).\n\nHe also directed the 2008 documentary Tyson about the life of former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson.\n\nHis latest film starring Sienna Miller and Alec Baldwin (The Private Life of a Modern Woman) debuted at the Venice Film Festival in September.\n\nWho are the women who have made the allegations?\n\nOf the 38 women who made the accusations, 31 spoke to the Times on the record.\n\nThey include actress Adrienne LaValley who alleged Toback rubbed himself against her.\n\nEcho Danon, who worked on Toback's film Black and White, said he put his hands on her and said he would ejaculate if she looked at his eyes and pinched his nipples.\n\nShe said: \"Everyone wants to work, so they put up with it.\"\n\nVeruca Salt guitarist and singer Louise Post and actress Terri Conn (As the World Turns) have also spoken out.\n\nWhat's the response been so far?\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn has written a lengthy Facebook post on the allegations.\n\nHe said he knows at least 15 women who have had similar experiences, including a member of his family, and said he had been bringing up Toback's name at every chance he could.\n\n\"I couldn't stop him, but I could warn people about him,\" he said.\n\n\"Recently, I thought the guy had disappeared into obscurity and old age, but then I saw an article in the Huffington Post about him, entitled, 'James Toback Gets Us, He Truly Gets Us'. I almost vomited.\n\n\"... So since then I've been hoping the Weinstein/O'Reilly stuff would bring this vampire into the light [him and a couple others, frankly].\n\nDirector Paul Fieg (Bridesmaids) also took to social media to share his thoughts.\n\nAnd actress Rose McGowan, who has led the charge against Harvey Weinstein, tweeted her take.\n\nWhat has Toback said in response to the story?\n\nThe 72-year-old has denied the allegations.\n\nHe told the Los Angeles Times he never met any of the women, and if he had it \"was for five minutes and [I] have no recollection\"."
