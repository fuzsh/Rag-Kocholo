        "text": "Writer and director James Toback has been accused of sexual harassment by 38 women in a recent report published Sunday morning in The Los Angeles Times. These allegations stem all the way back to the 1980s.\n\nToback is most known for films such as \"Black and White,\" \"Two Girls and a Guy\" and \"Bugsy,\" which earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. The director reportedly used his status in Hollywood to approach women on the streets of New York City, promising stardom. He would lure them into auditions, meetings and interviews that would turn sexual.\n\nThirty-one of the women spoke openly, and on the record, with The Los Angeles Times. Among them were musician Louise Post, guitarist and vocalist for the band Veruca Salt, and actress Terri Conn of \"As the World Turns.\"\n\nThe 72-year-old denied the allegation, stating that he had never met any of the women--but if he had, \"it was for five minutes.\" He also explained that it was \"biologically impossible\" for him to participate in such acts because he had diabetes and a heart condition that required medication.\n\nToback commended women coming forward with their stories about sexual assault and harassment, saying their actions are revolutionary. \"While I am sympathetic to the concept of 'Me too,' I am afraid that it invites not just legitimate anger and complaint, but also faceless and invented slander,\" he added.\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, many of the women's accounts describe similar situations, where Toback made lewd suggestions and engaged in some sort of masturbation."
