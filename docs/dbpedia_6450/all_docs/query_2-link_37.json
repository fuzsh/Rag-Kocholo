        "text": "Today's Marking - Finger Zones - Introduction\n\nOh yes! Everything in the hands means something. Not only the fingerprints and lines, but shapes and the size, width and length of all 3 zones of all 10 fingers. I could write a little book about the finger zones and what they indicate.\n\nOne of the primary pieces of information available to you by looking at the zones of your fingers is guidance about your innate business, or career niche. I’ll use myself as an example.\n\nThe print below is my right hand. Notice how dominate the upper zones look overall compared to the other zones, especially on my middle, or Saturn, finger and my thumb.\n\nAnother dominant zone is the lower zone of my thumb, it is significantly larger than the same zone on most people’s thumbs. I have drawn a line showing the two joints on my thumb so you can see the length of the lower zone.\n\nOverall, the upper zones the spiritual, conceptual, theoretical, abstract, philosophical, ideals, big picture. Each finger follows that general theme, but within the context of the meaning of each finger. I’m going to stick with the general application in this newsletter or I’ll be writing for hours!\n\nSaturn is about career, systems, structure, responsibility, integrity, value out in the world. The upper section of the thumb is about setting intentions, applying your will, taking action, and getting results. The lower section of the thumb is the voice, communicating desire, speaking up.\n\nSo, putting that all together, the work I am naturally talented with doing is...\n\nUsing a spiritual and abstract system (hand analysis and my own purpose coaching process) along with my big picture and philosophical thinking and skilled communication, I help people identify their ideal work, embrace their value, set their intentions, take right action, and communicate their work and desire out in the world.\n\nPretty cool the way HA works, right?\n\n*************************************\n\nA PERSONAL NOTE\n\nThis was the first time Darby and I rode along the creek that runs south, then east, from Addenbrooke Park in Lakewood. We got to see lots of nice yards and many dogs, yikes. Thank goodness all of them were behind fences, but still a bit nerve-wracking for the horses (and riders) from time to time as they basically attacked the fence as we rode by. Actually the first human we saw early in the ride asked, \"Going on the dog tour this morning?\" Funny.\n\nNotice how little space there is to my right between Darby and the creek. If Allison's horse Oscar had a big spook from a dog to his left, we would likely have ended up in the creek. But all worked fine, both horses did great and for the most part were very brave."
