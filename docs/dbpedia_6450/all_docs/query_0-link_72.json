        "meta_description": "Like any genre that dates back nearly to the beginning of narrative cinema, the biopic has gone through developmental stages, emerging from each of its historical cycles with certain modes that continue to be available to filmmakers working in the form. This chapter focuses on three categories of biopic performance: embodied impersonation, stylised suggestion and the star performance. Stylised performances that rely more on suggestion and less on full impersonation include Paul Giamatti and Hope Davis in American Splendor, as well as Anthony Hopkins in Nixon, Johnny Depp in Ed Wood and Hilary Swank in Boys Don't Cry. Two rightly celebrated performances by Cate Blanchett, as Katharine Hepburn in The Aviator and as the 1966-model Bob Dylan in I'm Not There, are of a different sort, and they differ from each other as well.",
