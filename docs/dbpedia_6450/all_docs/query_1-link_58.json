        "text": "The Oscar nominated filmmaker and screenwriter James Toback has been accused of sexual harassment, with 38 women speaking on the record to the Los Angeles Times about incidents in which he allegedly offered them acting work in exchange for sexual favours.\n\nAccording to many of the women, Toback would approach them on the streets of New York, introduce himself as an Oscar nominee, occasionally pull out magazine articles about himself to prove his identity, and then encourage them to attend an audition for him. Alleged sexual harassment would then occur.\n\n\"In a weird sense, I thought, 'This is a test of whether I'm a real artist and serious about acting,'\" remembered a former aspiring actress named Starr Rinaldi. \"He always wanted me to read for him in a hotel or come back to his apartment, like, 'How serious are you about your craft?'\n\n\"And the horrible thing is, whichever road you choose, whether you sleep with him or walk away, you're still broken. You have been violated.\"\n\nOther women accused the director of refusing to let them leave his apartment before they watched him masturbate, while others alleged the director physically assaulted them.\n\nToback was nominated for an Oscar for writing the Warren Beatty film Bugsy, but is arguably best known for his provocative late-Nineties work including the sex comedy Two Girls and a Guy, starring Robert Downey Jr and Heather Graham, and the maligned race drama Black & White, starring an oddball cast including Jared Leto, Ben Stiller and Claudia Schiffer.\n\nOther work includes Harvard Man, an LSD-infused basketball drama with Sarah Michelle Gellar, and a talky erotic thriller called When Will I Be Loved with Neve Campbell. He's also responsible for a 2008 documentary about his long-time friend Mike Tyson, which The Guardian accused of failing to properly probe Tyson's rape conviction in 1992.\n\nHis last film was The Private Life of a Modern Woman, which premiered at this year's Venice Film Festival to jeers. Featuring Sienna Miller as a potential murderess and a cameo from former Donald Trump special advisor Carl Icahn as himself, The Telegraph dubbed it a \"pompous chore\".\n\nToback denied all the allegations against him, the Los Angeles Times writing that Toback said \"he had never met any of these women or, if he did, it 'was for five minutes and have no recollection.'\" He also reportedly told the Times that it would be \"biologically impossible\" for him to engage in the behaviour described by his accusers, citing diabetes and a heart condition.\n\nClaiming he had only heard anecdotes from friends and collaborators that he couldn't publicly address without facing a lawsuit, Gunn wrote: \"I did what I could do in my impotent state â€“ for over 20 years now, I've been bringing up James Toback every chance I could in groups of people. I couldn't stop him, but I could warn people about him.\"\n\nThe allegations against Toback come on the heels of the Harvey Weinstein scandal, in which countless women accused the film mogul of sexual harassment and rape over the course of nearly three decades. Asia Argento, one of the most vocal of Weinstein's accusers, offered her support to the women to come forward about Toback, tweeting: \"So proud of my sisters for bringing down yet another pig.\""
