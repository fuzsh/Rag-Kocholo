        "text": "Writer and director James Toback, who received an Oscar nomination for writing Bugsy, has been accused of sexual harassment by 38 women in a report published Sunday in The Los Angeles Times.\n\nIn the report, many of the women allege that Toback approached them on the streets of New York City and promised stardom. His meetings would often end with sexual questions and Toback masturbating in front of them or simulating sexual intercourse with them, according to the accounts.\n\nThe 72-year-old denied the allegations to The Los Angeles Times, saying he never met any of the women, or if he had it \"was for five minutes and [I] have no recollection.\"\n\nThirty-one of the women spoke on the record including Louise Post, who is a guitarist and vocalist for the band Veruca Salt, As the World Turns actress Terri Conn and actress Echo Danon, who worked on the set of his film Black and White.\n\n\"Everyone wants to work, so they put up with it,\" Danon told the Times. \"That's why I put up with it. Because I was hoping to get another job.\"\n\nNumber of accusers doubles\n\nThe Los Angeles Times also reported that Canadian actress Chantal Cousineau alleged that Toback made sexually explicit comments in a Toronto hotel room when she was asked to meet him for an audition in 2001. She also alleged during a subsequent rehearsal that Toback was masturbating just off the set.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, Times reporter Glenn Whipp said the number of accusers had doubled since the story had published.\n\nToback hasn't responded to a request for comment from The Associated Press.\n\nThe report comes amid the ongoing downfall of producer Harvey Weinstein, who has been accused of sexual harassment and assault by over three dozen women. He was fired from the company he co-founded and widely denounced by his Hollywood peers.\n\n'So proud of my sisters'\n\n\"James Toback damn you for stealing, damn you for traumatizing,\" tweeted Weinstein accuser Rose McGowan on Sunday.\n\nAnother Weinstein accuser, actress-director Asia Argento, tweeted, \"So proud of my sisters for bringing down yet another pig\" in response to the Toback report.\n\nThough less widely known than Weinstein, Toback has had a successful four-decade career in Hollywood and has a devoted following who have praised him for his originality and outsized, deeply flawed characters.\n\nA New York native, Harvard graduate, creative writing professor and compulsive gambler, Toback used his own life as inspiration for his first produced screenplay, The Gambler, which came out in 1974 and starred James Caan. The film was remade in 2014 with Mark Walhberg and Brie Larson.\n\nThe Private Life of a Modern Woman\n\nHe also wrote and directed the Harvey Keitel film Fingers, the loosely autobiographical The Pick-up Artist, which starred Robert Downey Jr. and Molly Ringwald, Two Girls and a Guy, also with Downey Jr. and Heather Graham, Harvard Man, with Sarah Michelle Gellar, and the Mike Tyson documentary Tyson.\n\nHis one and only Oscar nomination is for writing the Barry Levinson-directed and Warren Beatty-starring Bugsy.\n\nToback's upcoming film, The Private Life of a Modern Woman, stars Sienna Miller and Alec Baldwin and debuted at the Venice Film Festival earlier this year.\n\nLike Weinstein, reports of Toback's alleged behaviour toward women have been around for decades. Spy magazine wrote about him in 1989, and the now-defunct website Gawker also published accounts from women in New York who had had run-ins with Toback.\n\n'A disgrace'\n\nBut in the past few weeks, amid the Weinstein scandal and the rise of the #MeToo social media movement, in which women are revealing instances of sexual harassment and assault, more reports have emerged about the conduct of many working in the entertainment industry.\n\nJust days ago, top Amazon Studios executive Roy Price resigned following sexual harassment allegations made by a Man in the High Castle producer.\n\nOn Sunday, a few in Hollywood began denouncing Toback on social media, including Bridesmaids director Paul Feig, who tweeted that Toback is \"a disgrace.\"\n\n\"One of the main jobs of a director is to create a safe environment for the actors,\" Feig wrote.\n\nWarned for 20 years\n\nDoctor Strange director Scott Derrickson added, \"If there is a Hell, James Toback will be in it.\"\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn wrote a lengthy Facebook post Sunday about the allegations, saying that he has personally met at least 15 women who have said they have had these kinds of encounters with Toback, including three women he has dated, two friends and a family member.\n\n\"For over twenty years now, I've been bringing up James Toback every chance I could in groups of people,\" Gunn wrote. \"I couldn't stop him, but I could warn people about him.\""
