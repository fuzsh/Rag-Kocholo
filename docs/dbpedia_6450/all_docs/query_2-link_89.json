        "text": "Nicotine is the addictive drug in tobacco smoke that causes people who smoke to continue to smoke.\n\nAlong with nicotine, people who smoke inhale about 7,000 other chemicals in cigarette smoke. Many of these chemicals come from burning tobacco leaf. Some of these compounds are chemically active and trigger profound and damaging changes in the body.\n\nTobacco smoke contains over 70 known cancer-causing chemicals. Smoking harms nearly every organ in the body, causing many diseases and reducing health in general.\n\nDangerous chemicals in tobacco smoke\n\nHighly damaging components of tobacco smoke include:\n\ntar – is the word for the solid particles suspended in tobacco smoke. The particles contain chemicals, including cancer-causing substances (carcinogens). Tar is sticky and brown, and stains teeth, fingernails and lung tissue\n\ncarbon monoxide – is a poisonous gas. It is odourless and colourless and, in large doses, quickly causes death because it takes the place of oxygen in the blood. In people who smoke, the carbon monoxide in their blood makes it harder for oxygen to get to their organs and muscles\n\noxidizing chemicals – are highly reactive chemicals that can damage the heart muscles and blood vessels of people who smoke. They react with cholesterol, leading to the build-up of fatty material on artery walls. Their actions lead to heart disease, stroke and blood vessel disease\n\nmetals – tobacco smoke contains several metals that cause cancer, including arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, lead and nickel\n\nradioactive compounds – tobacco smoke contains radioactive compounds that are known to be carcinogenic.\n\nEffects of smoking tobacco on the body\n\nInhaling tobacco smoke causes damage to many of the body’s organs and systems.\n\nEffects of smoking on the respiratory system\n\nThe effects of tobacco smoke on the respiratory system include:\n\nirritation of the trachea (windpipe) and larynx (voice box)\n\nreduced lung function and breathlessness due to swelling and narrowing of the lung airways and excess mucus in the lung passages\n\nimpairment of the lungs’ clearance system, leading to the build-up of poisonous substances, which results in lung irritation and damage\n\nincreased risk of lung infection and symptoms such as coughing and wheezing\n\npermanent damage to the air sacs of the lungs.\n\nEffects of smoking on the circulatory system\n\nThe effects of tobacco smoke on the circulatory system include:\n\nraised blood pressure and heart rate\n\nconstriction (tightening) of blood vessels in the skin, resulting in a drop in skin temperature\n\nless oxygen carried by the blood during exercise\n\n‘stickier’ blood, which is more prone to clotting\n\ndamage to the lining of the arteries, which is thought to be a contributing factor to atherosclerosis (the build-up of fatty deposits on the artery walls)\n\nreduced blood flow to extremities (fingers and toes)\n\nincreased risk of stroke and heart attack due to blockages of the blood supply.\n\nEffects of smoking on the immune system\n\nThe effects of tobacco smoke on the immune system include:\n\ngreater susceptibility to infections such as pneumonia and influenza\n\nmore severe and longer-lasting illnesses\n\nlower levels of protective antioxidants (such as vitamin C), in the blood.\n\nEffects of smoking on the musculoskeletal system\n\nThe effects of tobacco smoke on the musculoskeletal system include:\n\ntightening of certain muscles\n\nreduced bone density.\n\nEffects of smoking on the sexual organs\n\nThe effects of tobacco smoke on the male body include an increased risk for:\n\nlower sperm count\n\nhigher percentage of deformed sperm\n\ngenetic damage to sperm\n\nimpotence, which may be due to the effects of smoking on blood flow and damage to the blood vessels of the penis.\n\nThe effects of tobacco smoke on the female body include:\n\nreduced fertility, menstrual cycle irregularities, or absence of menstruation\n\nmenopause reached one or two years earlier\n\nincreased risk of cancer of the cervix\n\ngreatly increased risk of stroke and heart attack if the person who smokes is aged over 35 years and taking the oral contraceptive pill.\n\nOther effects of smoking on the body\n\nOther effects of tobacco smoke on the body include:\n\nirritation and inflammation of the stomach and intestines\n\nincreased risk of painful ulcers along the digestive tract\n\nreduced ability to smell and taste\n\npremature wrinkling of the skin\n\nhigher risk of blindness\n\ngum disease (periodontitis).\n\nEffects of smoking on babies\n\nThe effects of maternal smoking on an unborn baby include:\n\nincreased risk of miscarriage, stillbirth and premature birth\n\nweaker lungs\n\nlow birth weight, which may have a lasting effect of the growth and development of children. Low birth weight is associated with an increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes in adulthood\n\nincreased risk of cleft palate and cleft lip\n\nincreased risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n\nPassive smoking (exposure of the non-smoking mother to second-hand smoke) can also harm the fetus.\n\nIf a parent continues to smoke during their baby’s first year of life, the child has an increased risk of ear infections, respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia and bronchitis, sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) and meningococcal disease.\n\nDiseases caused by long-term smoking\n\nA person who smokes throughout their life is at high risk of developing a range of potentially lethal diseases, including:\n\ncancer of the lung, mouth, nose, larynx, tongue, nasal sinus, oesophagus, throat, pancreas, bone marrow (myeloid leukaemia), kidney, cervix, ovary, ureter, liver, bladder, bowel and stomach\n\nlung diseases such as chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which includes obstructive bronchiolitis and emphysema\n\nheart disease and stroke\n\nulcers of the digestive system\n\nosteoporosis and hip fracture\n\npoor blood circulation in feet and hands, which can lead to pain and, in severe cases, gangrene and amputation\n\ntype 2 diabetes\n\nrheumatoid arthritis.\n\nWhere to get help"
