Pollicization is a surgical procedure used to treat severe thumb hypoplasia by transferring another finger to the thumb position. Twin girls aged two years and eight months, born to a 42-year-old para III mother, presented with bilateral thumb hypoplasia. There was no family history of similar complaints, and no consanguinity was identified between their parents. After excluding other associated anomalies, index finger pollicization was performed for all four hands of the children according to modified Buck-Gramcko techniques, with modifications from Ezaki et al. Generally, index pollicization executed with careful preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative planning will lead to aesthetically and functionally attractive thumbs for children with congenitally severe hypoplasia or absent thumbs.",
