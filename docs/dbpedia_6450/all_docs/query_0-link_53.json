        "text": "Kent Jones is not the first film critic to turn filmmaker. But as director of the New York Film Festival, a role he has held since late 2012, Jones’s increasingly prolific output behind the camera can, on occasion, put him in an awkward position. He has already had to recuse himself from the selection process due to his creative involvement on one film under consideration—Arnaud Desplechin’s Jimmy P, on which Jones shared a screenplay credit. But with his new film, Hitchcock / Truffaut, Jones took the matter out of the selection committee’s hands. As he told me last summer, between announcements of the festival’s main slate, “This film can’t get near this festival. It’s just that simple. How can I possibly look a documentary filmmaker, or any filmmaker, in the face and say ‘Sorry, I’m going to show my movie but yours isn’t good enough?’”\n\nGiven the film’s subject matter—the meeting of Alfred Hitchcock and Francois Truffaut in 1962 that yielded one of the great books about cinema—this might seem harsh on New York’s committed cinefile audiences. But Jones’s integrity as a programmer is consistent with his modesty as a critic, a modesty which in no way negates his passionately held positions. (He took Tarantino to task for slighting John Ford.) As a critic, Jones, to paraphrase James Wood, does not show a lot of plumage towards his subject: he is not in competition with the film under discussion. In this he follows in the footsteps of two film critics whose names crop up several times during our conversation, Andre Bazin and Manny Farber.\n\nIt was Bazin, founder of Cahiers du Cinema, who provided a stage for the most notable critics-turned-filmmakers in the history of cinema, and a rare moment, says Jones, of a critical fraternity with Bazin framed as “this genius dying of leukaemia surrounded by these younger men…on their way to taking their writing and using it as a declaration.” Those young men—Francois Truffaut, Jean-Luc Goddard, Claude Chabrol, Eric Rohmer, and Jacques Rivette—were instrumental in elevating the artistic reputations of Hollywood directors who had previously been considered light entertainers, Hitchcock being a case in point.\n\nManny Farber had been doing much the same thing: writing about the unseen merits of American filmmakers, though long before La politiques des auteurs made its way across the Atlantic in the guise of Andrew Sarris’s Notes On the Auteur Theory. Jones, who was born in 1960, was a teenager when he discovered both Sarris’s The American Cinema and Farber’s Negative Space, books that would affect him in different ways. “With Andrew the impact was immediate. It was [his] hierarchies and categories that got me. Because the whole idea what is a director—that’s interesting, you know. And then [Negative Space], that’s something else. For years I would crack it open every once in a while and look at it. I had no idea what the fuck this guy was talking about. But I am intrigued. At a certain point it clicked. If you understand that writing is a matter of rhythm, and that a writer is engaged in rhythm and not just the translation of thoughts into language then you’re dealing with writing. With Manny as opposed to 90% of other critics—Pauline Kael being an exception—you’re thrust into the deep-end of rhythm right away. I related to him much more than Pauline Kael.”\n\nThe lone wolf of American film criticism, Farber emerged out of one tradition of American critical prose—he replaced Otis Ferguson at the New Republic and James Agee at Time respectively—but ended up in an altogether different place. Susan Sontag called him “the liveliest, smartest, most original film critic [America] ever produced”, and in her landmark essay Against Interpretation praised him for his ability to describe films in terms of their surface and texture. But then Farber was a terrific painter who came at movies with an innate sense of the visual, and an understanding of how something is put together. If Jones has sought to emulate (though never imitate) anyone, it is Farber, as much for his approach (detail-oriented and exhaustive) as well as his style.\n\nJones is not a weekly reviewer as such, so he is spared from having to write about everything he sees. At Film Comment, where he is also deputy editor, he is blessed with a long lead-in time and given ample space to cover the ground of a given film or filmmaker. (And covering the ground was a Farber imperative.) His pieces are rigorous, serious without being dry, and often richly conceived. He can evoke a film’s mood or a director’s style in a sentence, which in the case of Sofia Coppola amounts to the same thing:\n\n“Sofia Coppola is uncommonly gifted at the articulation of something so fleeting and ephemeral that it seems to be on the verge of evaporating on contact with her hovering, deadpan, infinitely patient camera eye.”\n\nOne can see that Jones has also been rigorous about his choice of subject matter: critical appreciations of leading contemporary filmmakers (Hou Hsiao-hsien, Claire Denis, Wong Kar-wei, Abbas Kiarostami, and Lucretia Martel) account for over half the pieces in Physical Evidence, his debut collection. When he began writing for Film Comment, in 1996, articles about ‘the death of cinema’ were very much in the air. But as far as Jones is concerned, the medium is still in its infancy, still vital. The writer Phillip Lopate, who included one of Jones’s essays in the Library of America’s American Movie Critics anthology, calls him “…the film critic most alive to this moment”. Physical Evidence, published in 2007, was proof enough, but in the years since Jones’s writing has grown in authority, while his newly divergent path as a filmmaker (he co-wrote Martin Scorsese’s My Voyage to Italy and A Letter to Elia) has perhaps permanently marked his approach to writing criticism. “Making films has changed my criticism in the sense that—and I really started to think this a long time ago, and my opinion has only grown stronger as the years have gone by—that 90% of film criticism is just divorced from the actual practice of making movies.”\n\nIn terms of the position Jones presently occupies within contemporary film culture, he reminds me of Mark Cousins: wearers of multiple hats, both have run major festivals; each are quick to challenge critical orthodoxy and / or received wisdom; and while they are devoted students of film history, they are always making the case for cinema now. And as with Cousins, it’s clear that each activity—writing, programming, and making films—feeds the other. “There’s rhetoric about keeping stuff alive and making sure that people remember the past, or that they get to experience a film that they wouldn’t be able to see elsewhere. But really, it’s not about that in terms of the [programming] choices or in terms of the writing. If it were then it would make for a very dull film festival; it would make for very dull writing. I wouldn’t want to read it. I can’t stand it when people say to me: ‘I support this film for these reasons.’ Why bother?”\n\nThis uncompromising and passionate approach informs Hitchcock / Truffaut, which like Jones’s criticism, is deeply engaged and carries no extraneous weight. Jones is neither seen nor heard—there’s that modesty again—but then he doesn’t need to be. His material is gold, and he knows it. Truffaut’s book was the culmination of a kind of pursuit and an artistic debt repaid, with Hitchcock flattered and bemused, as well as moved, by the younger man’s ardour and attention. What strange path led Truffaut to Hitchcock? Well, Jones answers that too. And through the use of the original audio tapes, their voices can now be heard. Nuance, lost to the inevitable limitations of translation and transcription, is restored. We hear for ourselves how Hitchcock’s curiosity about Truffaut’s comfort with actors and improvisation led to his famous remark “actors are cattle”. It sounds far more benign on tape than it looks in print. Hitchcock, in effect, is rescued again.\n\nBut Jones opens up—extends—the conversation in another way. By turning to those filmmakers who devoured and absorbed its contents as though it were a sacred text, the film reveals the extent of the book’s (ongoing) impact—on Hitchcock’s reputation and those who followed in his wake. As you’d expect, Jones’s long-time collaborator Scorsese is on hand to talk about the book’s radicalising effect on his generation. But no less illuminating are Peter Bogdanovich, himself a great critic, Paul Schrader (ditto), Olivier Assayas, David Fincher, Richard Linklater, and Wes Anderson. Fincher is particularly good on Hitchcock’s mastery of time and space. He also mischievously wonders how a DeNiro, Pacino, or Hoffman might have flourished under Hitchcock’s “iron umbrella”.\n\nJones, who writes with great insight about actors and acting, believes that Hitchcock was aware of the shifts that had taken place in American film post-Brando and “the Method”, or as Jones puts it—“the exultation of acting as an event in and of itself.” But like many of Hollywood’s old-guard, Hitchcock struggled to accommodate the modern actor’s quest for authenticity: directorial design trumped motivation; his process trumped theirs. And the struggle made for an interesting tension in Hitchcock’s films, particularly in the era of arguably his greatest work.\n\nSays Jones: “Hitchcock arrived at this moment—and how did he deal with it? By taking an actress who was involved in that kind of thing, Eve Marie Saint, but making her into something else; by finding Tippi Hedren. Taking Bruce Dern and not really doing much with him that was that adventurous. And I think that when the younger generation—Marty, Paul Schrader, Spielberg—came along, what made their films feel different was that they responded to that reality. It’s like when the Velvet Underground came along and they mixed the drums up front, and the guitars in the background. Suddenly the acting occupied a different position in the film.”\n\nI get the impression that Jones could talk about cinema all day, and probably does. But he has a festival to run, and I have a plane to catch. Before I leave, I quote a passage from Randall Jarrell’s essay The Age of Criticism:\n\n“Remember that you can never be more than the staircase to the monument, the guide to the gallery, the telescope through which the children see the stars. At your best you make people see what they might never have seen without you; but they must always forget you in what they see.”\n\nJones agrees. “I think that that’s generally true. I think it’s true of criticism in a very particular way. When the critic becomes the central event, they’re not writing criticism any more. So Manny—and I’ve quoted this many times—he said the idea is to get yourself out of it so that the object itself takes on religious awe. It also rhymes with Bazin—prolonging the original shock of the work of art.”\n\nAnd this is where Hitchcock/Truffaut succeeds—as both a movie and as an example of criticism in action. As the film builds towards the peaks of Vertigo and Psycho, the conversation stops, and Jones returns to those images and moments that have lost none of their power. Kim Novak, say, emerging remade before James Stewart’s eyes, her appearance filtered through that strange, vertical shaft of aqua green light. A moment that best explains, but never quite reveals, itself. And we forget we are watching a documentary ostensibly about a book, a movie about cinema, but one that effortlessly, passionately—and modestly—achieve Bazin and Farber’s critical objectives.\n\n—Mick McAloon\n\nTo read the full interview go to http://anosamoursblog.weebly.com/blog/june-08th-2016\n\nAs Stanley Kowalski in the original stage version of A Streetcar Named Desire in 1947, Marlon Brando forever altered the landscape in American theatre and film. Often cited as the leading exponent of “the Method”, the acting system derived from the teachings of Stanislavski, and promulgated in America by Lee Strasberg, what Brando had—or possessed—could not be schooled. Even though he had studied with acting coach and Group Theater breakaway Stella Adler, the nature of Brando’s gift was too large, too poetic, and ultimately too mysterious to be attributed to any one movement. David Mamet was right to surmise that a talent like Brando would have succeeded anyway—regardless of the gurus who sought to claim his success a result of their expertise as opposed to his.\n\nBorn in Omaha, Nebraska in 1924, Brando was educated at Shattuck Military Academy, where he was expelled for insubordination—an early warning—though not before impressing in a school production. There had already been intimations as to where his future might lie: Brando’s older sister had moved to New York to pursue an acting career; his mother had been a member of the Omaha Community Playhouse, where she had appeared onstage with Henry Fonda. After expulsion from Shattuck, Brando briefly returned home before joining his sister in New York, where he attended Erwin Piscator’s Drama Workshop at the New School. It was here, in a class that included Rod Steiger and Shelley Winters, that Brando met Stella Adler. On seeing Brando for the first time, Adler is reported to have said: “Who’s the vagabond?” As first responses go, Adler’s is remarkable in that seemed to intuit what future audiences would feel—or a variation thereof—whenever Brando appeared on stage or on screen. In her review of Last Tango in Paris (1972), Pauline Kael writes fondly of seeing Brando in what was only his second Broadway production, Truckline Café, in 1946: “…the young man who brought me grabbed my arm and said “Watch this guy!…” We’ve been watching him ever since.\n\nHe made his screen debut with The Men (1950), as a returning war veteran and paraplegic. In what was considered unusual practice at the time, Brando spent weeks at a veterans’ hospital in an attempt at understanding as well as verisimilitude. His performance was warmly reviewed, but the film was a disappointment at the box office. Still, Brando had made his mark. He followed with the movie version of A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), directed by Elia Kazan, the play’s original director and Brando’s most vital collaborator. Tennessee Williams’s poetic masterpiece was always too florid for the screen, but Brando is still electric. And as the closest thing we have to a record of his famous Broadway performance, it should be cherished. Something in the clash of acting styles—Vivien Leigh’s theatricality, Brando’s immediacy—suited the material and brought out the conflict in Williams’s drama: the old world versus the new. Stanley Kowalski may have been a brute, and Brando had access to all his uncouthness and vulgarity, but there was something about his presence—deeply masculine, strangely feminine, a poetic delicacy always beneath the surface—that seemed if not to subvert the archetype then to co-exist within it. Perhaps it was a matter of Brando’s extraordinary physiognomy, combined with casting that was simultaneously ideal and contradictory. For Brando made Stanley interesting and not just alluring, which ran counter to the playwright’s intentions. Williams envisaged Stanley as a meathead, comfortable in his own skin, but without a trace of sensitivity or a flicker of poetry in his soul—qualities that Brando had in abundance. And it was these qualities and contradictions that coalesced around Brando’s film appearances in the early 1950s. In his own way, Brando opened the door for a subsequent generation of rebels—James Dean, Elvis Presley, and Bob Dylan. But those genuine American firebrands could never be confused with the biker rebels in The Wild One (1953). Laslo Benedek’s film was dated even before the cameras rolled, though its iconography remains potent, if only for t-shirts and bedroom walls.\n\nViva Zapata (1952) and Julius Caesar (1953) saw Brando extend his range, doing John Steinbeck and Shakespeare respectively. But in On the Waterfront (1954), and back with Kazan, he gave one of his greatest performances. As ex-fighter and longshoreman Terry Malloy, Brando exemplified “the Method” at its most poetic. Two scenes in particular are justifiably lauded: Brando picking up Eve Marie Saint’s glove and putting it on his hand—a moment of improvisatory genius; while his “contender” speech in response to his brother’s betrayal remains one of the most moving and memorable scenes in cinema: “It was you, Charlie. It was you.” Martin Scorsese and Robert DeNiro would pay tribute to this scene in Raging Bull (1980), though they refrained from the emotion so evident in Brando’s delivery. Pauline Kael called Brando’s speech “the great American lament…” after she’d been quick to claim him as “our most powerful young screen actor, [and] the only one who suggested tragic force…” In hindsight On the Waterfront can be seen as the culmination of Brando’s genuine engagement with Hollywood, and the precise moment he delivered on the promise of his Broadway arrival. After three successive Academy Award nominations (1952-1954), he won Best Actor, as though anyone needed to be told.\n\nBrando himself became indifferent towards acting and ambivalent about fame. He made some poor choices, though he was still capable of a surprise like Guys and Dolls (1955). He directed himself in One-Eyed Jacks (1961) after falling out with—and firing—Stanley Kubrick. But directors who fit the Kazan mould, such as Sidney Lumet and Arthur Penn, and who had come up through the theatre and live television, elicited something like his best work: The Fugitive Kind (1959), and The Chase (1966).\n\nBut then in the early 1970s, Brando made a spectacular comeback. The Godfather (1972) reaffirmed his status as America’s greatest actor, while forever linking him to the generation he had inspired—Al Pacino, James Caan, and, by way of his young Vito Corleone in The Godfather, Part II (1974), Robert DeNiro. Last Tango in Paris (1972) saw Brando at his most naked and personal before he withdrew from public life altogether, aside from the occasional cameo or supporting role in films such as The Missouri Breaks (1976), Superman (1978), A Dry White Season (1989) and The Freshman (1990). His final film was The Score (2001), with DeNiro and Edward Norton. But his last great film was Apocalypse Now (1979), where Brando’s rogue colonel anticipated the actor’s self-imposed exile from the profession he had done so much to redefine.\n\n—Mick McAloon\n\nRobert De Niro is regarded as one of the finest actors of his generation, but why was he so compelling?\n\nDear S,\n\nIt’s interesting how you frame the question in the past tense, as if De Niro no longer compels our attention. You’re not alone: David Thomson has spoken of De Niro’s “grievous decline”. Perhaps it’s true and for me to insist otherwise would be foolish and sentimental. I do know that your question is sincere. You’re a lot younger than me and I guess you’re genuinely curious about De Niro’s early appeal. Not that my youth coincided with De Niro’s great years: I came in at the tail-end—Once Upon A Time in America, Falling In Love—when video stores were in the ascendant, and it seemed as if there was an inexhaustible supply of great performances, in great films, that one could rent night after night. I remember being thrilled by each new discovery and buoyed by the prospect of there still being more to come. It was an education, of sorts. Already you can see that I am being sentimental; I’m certainly romanticising my youth and the great days of Selecta Video. So perhaps you were right to use the past tense. So where do we start?\n\nDe Niro was the A-list anti-star, but a star nonetheless. His reputation is built on that great run of films beginning with Mean Streets and ending with Once Upon A Time in America. In between came The Godfather II, Taxi Driver, New York, New York, The Deer Hunter, 1900, Raging Bull, and The King of Comedy. You have to admit that’s a hell of a run. And it’s not that he hasn’t done good work in the years since—Brazil, Falling in Love, Midnight Run, Heat, Casino, Jackie Brown, Silver Linings Playbook—it’s just that decade-long run was truly special. For one thing, he worked less, averaging a film about every eighteen months. He was more selective about who he worked with: Scorsese x 5, Coppola, Cimino, Bertolucci, Leone. The climate encouraged maverick talent; novelists and filmmakers were central to the culture; film critics had influence—and an audience. (Or should that be the other way round?)\n\nBut what was it about De Niro that made him so compelling? On screen, he seemed incapable of false moments (he still does), even in films that are beneath him, such as New Year’s Eve. Off screen, he made himself scarce, rarely doing press. Of course, like most well-known actors or movie stars, especially those with long careers, he can be reduced to a set of ticks and mannerisms. But can’t we all?\n\nWhen I think of De Niro, I think of his fierce artistic will—how else do you account for that great run of films as well as the physical transformations? And I think of his soulfulness. There was something mysterious about him—his stillness, his watchfulness. I think of his eyes, particularly in Taxi Driver and Once Upon A Time in America. And I think of the choices he makes within a given role, which speaks of his special insight into the character he’s playing, or perhaps I should say “becoming”. It could be an item of clothing, a gesture, or simply his way of listening to another person. Over the years I got so bored with journalists’ tired run-throughs of De Niro’s method acting resume, but without any corresponding insights. So they might tell you that he learned to play saxophone for New York, New York, but they never point out that his timing is off when he counts in the band—a rare lapse. Or that he trained to be a boxer for Raging Bull, without acknowledging the way he moves when he’s not in the ring. And all that tired talk of De Niro’s weight-gain but no mention of Jake’s laboured breathing. (De Niro is one of cinema’s great listeners and breathers.)\n\nSo perhaps the best thing I can do is refer you to the films themselves, and to some of his most inspired choices, where De Niro is more than just the actor of his generation. He’s that rare beast—the actor as artist, where the choices he makes are invariably true, unerringly specific, and so vital to these movies’ artistic accomplishments that it’s hard to imagine them having been made with anybody else. Would it be wrong to say that he’s as much a presiding intelligence in these films as his directors? De Niro as auteur? I’ve heard Tarantino make that argument—and he’s not far wrong.\n\nMean Streets (1973) —\n\nDid he ever act with such wild abandon again? Of course, Scorsese gives him a helping hand, not one explosive entrance, but two: the first, literally, as Johnny blows up a mailbox, and the second to Jumping Jack Flash: Has there ever been a character in all of Scorsese’s oeuvre and his extensive use of the Stones back-catalogue more suited to their ramshackle symmetry?\n\nInspired moment #1: Johnny Boy dancing to Mickey’s Monkey outside the car when it’s all falling apart. Johnny Boy’s the joker in the pack, and De Niro the movie’s wild card! Sometimes, even Harvey Keitel can only look on in astonishment and wonder at De Niro, as if to say, where did this kid come from? But it would be wrong to talk about De Niro’s performance here without acknowledging Keitel’s great work, his simplicity and rock-solid presence. The entire movie is a beautiful duet, best summed up by two scenes: the ‘improv’ in the “back room” early on, and the way they each lay out handkerchiefs on the gravestones in the cemetery—the Abbot and Costello of the Lower East Side.\n\nDe Niro & Costume\n\nDe Niro’s choice of costume for his characters has always been impeccable. Johnny Boy may be wild, but he’s fastidious about the way he looks, and you can see this is not only in the way Johnny Boy dresses but in the way he readies himself in preparation to greet his friends in that second entrance—that is, once he’s put his trousers back on. But there are countless examples of De Niro’s great costume choices: in Goodfellas, for example, when De Niro’s Jimmy Conway is arrested. What struck me about De Niro’s costume choice here—a yellow jersey, jeans—was the level of detail for such a seemingly offhanded moment that takes place within a montage of arrests. It can only be for a few seconds of screen time, but that yellow jersey speaks volumes.\n\nDe Niro & Detail\n\nTalking about De Niro’s wardrobe tests for Falling in Love, and how he finally decided on the type of jacket his character would wear, Meryl Streep said… “[the jacket] was tan, it was ignorable, but that’s different from unimportant. Details are important, and Bob knows that.”\n\nTaxi Driver (1976) —\n\nInspired moment #2: After shooting Sport (Keitel), Travis sits down in the middle of the street, between parked cars; it’s a strange and disconcerting moment—Travis’s body descending into trauma?—all the more so for being so unexpected. Where did this detail come from? It seems so unforced: an actor’s truth transcending genre and pulp style. In Scorsese’s early movies, life is always intervening and his actors respond in kind—at least that’s what it feels like. But we’re also watching hungry, ambitious actors at the top of their game. Manny Farber and Patricia Patterson described Taxi Driver as “buzzing with star-turn acting”, which it is, though I’d call it an anti-star-turn very much attuned to a specific time and place: New York, 1970s, the Actor’s Studio: from street to (acting) class to screen, and hipper than anything Hollywood had to offer. It was Farber/Patterson, in the same article, who wrote one of the best things I’ve ever read about De Niro: they refer to him as “a high-class actor…whose acting range is always underscored by a personal dignity.” We must not forget that Farber, a great painter and critic, moved in the same circles as De Niro’s artist parents and would have recognised a fellow artist’s dedication to the truth: Negative Space, Farber’s singular collection of film writing, is dedicated to De Niro’s mother, Virginia Admiral; while De Niro, in those days, was the actor as termite-artist, prestige-resistant, burrowing through the Hollywood canvas. (cf. New York, New York.)\n\nRaging Bull (1980) —\n\nInspired moment #3: When Jake and his brother Joey (Joe Pesci) attend St Clare’s annual summer dance, Jake sees Vicky (Cathy Moriarty) leave with a local mobster (Frankie Vincent). But it’s what happens next, when Jake helps a doorman evict someone from the club: it’s another lovely detail—casual, off the cuff, and exquisitely judged—that tells us about Jake’s place and standing within the community. Detail in service of the truth. And let’s not forget Jake’s culinary advice—written or improvised?—to his first, beleaguered wife, as she cooks a steak: “don’t overcook it—it defeats its own purpose.”\n\nThe King of Comedy (1983) —\n\nFrom its homage to John Cassavetes’ Opening Night—a freeze-frame of a fan’s hands pressed against the window of a limousine—to its dissection of fame in the 20th Century post John Lennon’s assassination, The King of Comedy is a forerunner to Larry Sanders, with its behind-the-scenes look at a talk-show, and celebrities playing versions of themselves. Which makes Rupert Pupkin the patron saint of cable and reality television. So an argument could be made that Scorsese and De Niro’s fifth collaboration—and a commercial failure on its release—is the cornerstone of HBO’s present dominance. And—Hey Now!—don’t we see traits of Rupert Pupkin in Jeffrey Tambor’s Hank? (Check out Season 2 episode Hank’s Wedding.) Rupert could certainly have played the role of Larry’s sidekick, if he hadn’t harboured such crazy ambitions to be out there on his own. And Rupert is out there—a more psychotic version of David Brent, which brings us back to Larry Sanders (cf. The Office), HBO and the question of influence. (And I haven’t even mentioned The Sopranos.) This is one of De Niro’s greatest performances, perhaps his best: inspired, uncompromising and—pre Midnight Run—very funny.\n\nTrue Confessions (1981) —\n\nFalling in Love (1984) —\n\nTwo Ulu Grosbard films. True Confessions was written by husband and wife team John Gregory Dunne and Joan Didion, and based on Dunne’s novel. Tonally it belongs to the 1970s—Chinatown is in its sights. You believe De Niro’s priest has said a thousand masses, and heard a thousand confessions; while Falling in Love is like a made-for-television movie devised by Lee Strasberg. Which is to say that Grosbard, a man of the theatre, is an actors’ director: the performances are full, rich, nuanced and textured. De Niro and Streep are heavy-weights in fluff and the film as comfort-inducing as the best carrot cake and coffee, but I much prefer it to Brief Encounter, to which it is often, and unfavourably, compared.\n\nHeat (1995) —\n\nTalking about the differences between De Niro and Pacino, Michael Mann described them in terms of colours: Pacino is “deep red”, De Niro “cool blue”. For me, “cool blue” takes it. Pacino rips and roars—“Sit down, Ralph!”— while De Niro gives one of his great minimalist performances: his presence balancing Mann’s tendency towards verbosity: who needs Mann’s inflated dialogue when you’ve got De Niro? Mann certainly doesn’t. But then the abiding impression the film leaves is a wash of “cool blue”.\n\nCasino (1995) —\n\nAside from a rare moment of levity—once again suited up but with his trousers off (cf. Mean Streets)—De Niro’s Ace Rothstein is cold, dead-eyed, cool and controlling, and Sharon Stone’s Ginger like a slot machine that can’t stop giving out, much to Ace’s displeasure. Was this his last great leading role?\n\nJackie Brown (1997) —\n\n“Sadness” is not a word one normally associates with the exuberant Quentin Tarantino, but there it is…Jackie Brown is both lovely and tough and features one of De Niro’s (and Tarantino’s) saddest characters. Louis Gara (De Niro) gives off a sadness that I don’t remember from Elmore Leonard’s novel, Rum Punch. It’s as if he’s experienced so great an internal collapse—too many joints, too much time in the joint—that death would be a welcome relief. And when it comes, it’s heartbreaking: filmed from behind, a static camera, we don’t even see De Niro’s face: it’s all in his back and shoulders—forfeit, collapse, resignation.\n\n—MM\n\nWhenever I watch David Mamet’s films, I am reminded of William Hazlitt’s brilliant essay on actors. Actors, wrote Hazlitt, “are the only honest hypocrites.” To which we might tentatively add those honorary members of the acting profession—the con man and the politician. From House of Games to Wag the Dog, Mamet has presided over films that are like elaborate tricks, in which con-artists act out roles in exquisitely designed scams. Whichever way you look at it, somebody is always being duped—and that includes us.\n\nIn Redbelt, Mamet’s ninth film as a writer-director, it’s Mike Terry (Chiwetel Ejifor), a jiu-jitsu instructor, who gets seduced by Hollywood-types and scammed by fight promoters, all in the name of entertainment. Money’s involved, as it usually is in Mamet, and pride and honor is thrown into the mix. Mike is ex-army, though what he did “out there”—presumably Iraq —is only briefly alluded to. (Mamet has always resisted back-story.) Mike runs a jiu-jitsu academy in L.A., training, among others, cops and doormen in the art of self-defense. Two incidents early on trigger the plot. In the first, a woman (Emily Mortimer) enters the academy and (inadvertently) shoots out a window, narrowly missing one of Mike’s cop-students. In the second, Mike comes to a movie star’s rescue in a nightclub brawl. Both scenes establish Mike’s character—honorable and tough. And both leave him vulnerable to outside forces. The film charts Mike’s journey from idealist to practical idealist.\n\nMike’s idealism is taken for weakness, though his wife would probably call him naïve, or at the very least mock his purity. Mike is a fighter who refuses to fight—“competition weakens the fighter”, he tells her. His wife sees this adherence to a code as a refusal to participate in the messy business of life. She would seem to be the practical one. Where Mike talks in such abstract terms of not wanting to bring shame or dishonor upon the Academy, she just wants to keep the damn thing open, trading for business. Money’s tight, a problem which becomes further exacerbated after Mortimer’s explosive entrance. When we first see Mortimer, she’s driving through LA in search of a prescription: cascading rain, agitated wipers, and deserted streets. Things are that bad you half expect her to run into Julianne Moore and Magnolia’s biblical downpour. Mamet has always loved noir’s theatrical landscape, a place where he can house his games. Redbelt, then, has one foot in noir and the fight picture, while simultaneously reaching for the nobility of the Samurai film. Certainly, Ejifor’s performance, and the role as written, is more in keeping with the latter. It’s a lovely performance—calm, centered, physically contained, and not unlike Val Kilmer’s Special Forces operative in Spartan, though Kilmer had his own cool, quizzical thing going on.\n\nAlthough Mamet works predominantly within established genres, there is always something fresh about his approach. He moves into genre as one might move into a listed building: he respects the architecture, the building’s history, but makes it feel like home—Mamet world—filling it with the people and the things he likes. His films constitute a democracy ruled by a tyrant: actors and non-actors happily co-exist; the movie star and the repertory player are equally at home; and there is always room for family and friends (Rebecca Pidgeon, William H. Macy, Joe Mantegna, and Ricky Jay). But all toe the Mamet line (or lines). His famously profane speech is as distinctive and as metronomically precise as a Philip Glass score: tick-motherf***ing-tock. At its best (American Buffalo, Glengarry Glen Ross,) Mamet’s dialogue gives the impression of being ragged and wild, though it is anything but; at its most jarring, the actors speak as though listening to a click-track. Control is Mamet’s thing, and he rarely loses it. (Or as Mike puts it, “take the fight out of your face.”)\n\nThis extends to his mise-en-scene, which, understandably, is often overlooked because of the dialogue. Like Robert Bresson, another advocate of non-actors, Mamet constructs sequences from uninflected shots and uninflected performances—Mamet’s dialogue is inflected enough. But as Phillip Lopate suggested, as early as Homicide (1991), Mamet has been “evolving a personal cinema which may yet stand comparison with that of anyone of his generation.” I agree. Think of those modern juggernaughts of genre, the Oceans and Bourne trilogies, fast and slick, franchise-ubiquitous, whose roll-out and distribution patterns enact a kind of zoning—the Starbucks of the multiplexes. Then think of Mamet’s versions (Heist, Spartan), which are bespoke by comparison, European in sensibility, despite the Americanness of the dialogue and the roll-call of Great American Actors who have lined up to shoot his intoxicating breeze—Newman, Pacino, DeNiro, Hackman. For over two decades, Mamet, no less than John Cassavetes or even Larry David for that matter, has been making a form of home movie but without venturing into the deeply autobiographical or personal nature of his plays (The Cryptogram, The Old Neighborhood). (Although I’ve long thought that the wonderful scenes between Philip Seymour Hoffman and Rebecca Pidgeon in State & Main were a tribute to his wife.) And then there are Mamet’s views on acting, best exemplified by William H. Macy. You only have to see Macy in films that aren’t by Mamet (Fargo, Magnolia, The Cooler) to see the influence Mamet exerts on American film. And where would HBO (Entourage) and Showtime (Mad Men) be without Mamet’s Men (Piven, Slattery)?\n\nIn the same way that Virginia Woolf’s unsigned essays for the TLS were manifestos for the novel, as Woolf saw it, Mamet’s essays and books espouse a theory—his theory—of filmmaking and acting, which the films admirably demonstrate. Mamet is the practical idealist. The book he wrote for actors, True or False: Heresy and Common Sense for the Actor, is full of plain speaking advice: “…my views have been informed by and directed toward performance on the stage in front of a paying audience. That is what acting is. Doing a play for the audience. The rest is just practice. And I see the life of the academy, the graduate school, the studio, while charming and comfortable, are as removed from the life (and the job) of the actor as aerobics are from boxing.”\n\nYou could see this as further evidence of Mamet’s control extending beyond the confines of his film set or the rehearsal studio. Or perhaps it’s simply Mamet’s way of keeping his own actors—his hypocrites—honest.\n\n—Mick McAloon"
