        "text": "The devastating 2004 Sumatra earthquake and tsunami brought to the world’s attention the possibility of large megathrust ruptures occurring along the heavily populated coast of Bangladesh. The Sunda-Andaman subduction arc continues into Bangladesh where oblique convergence of the Indian plate with the Burma segment of the arc was measured at GPS rates of 14 mm/yr. A long section of the megathurst ruptured during the 1762 Great Arakan earthquake along the Myanmar coast. A 1762 tsunami was reported from historic accounts and predicted from modelling, but geologic evidence for it was not previously reported. St Martin’s Island and the Teknaf peninsula in SE Bangladesh are expressions of anticlines in the outer part of the accretionary prism of the Arakan subduction boundary. Our lithology, biostratigraphy and C-14 ages in this region provide evidence for a possible tsunami associated with the 1762 earthquake and validate the continuity of the rupture zone for as much as 700 km, from th...\n\nBangladesh, a small country with a high population density, is historically prone to certain natural disasters, notably floods and cyclones. While there have been no recorded major earthquakes causing significant loss of life or infrastructure damage within the country, Bangladesh remains vulnerable to seismic activity due to several factors. Firstly, its geographical location places it in close proximity to a seismically active region, as it lies at the convergence of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. Secondly, the prevalence of soft soil composition in many areas of the country amplifies the impact of earthquakes, resulting in heightened ground shaking and potential structural damage. Thirdly, Bangladesh's densely populated urban centers further increase its susceptibility to earthquakes, exposing its population to risks such as loss of life, injuries, and infrastructure destruction. This book aims to provide an understanding of the seismic risk of Bangladesh. It is based on available instrumental earthquake data collected from United States Geological Survey (USGS) spanning the last 50 years (from January 1, 1972, to December 31, 2022) and the known major plate boundary map of the world as available in the USGS database.\n\nNatural hazards and major land-use/land-cover change can have significant impacts on humans around the world. If these two concerns exist together in a coastal area, the consequences for people and the environment may be severe. This study investigated the combined effects of land-use changes and natural disasters in the southwest coastal area of Bangladesh. Satellite images were analyzed to detect changes in land cover in the study period of 13 years (1999–2012). Three areas were selected for ground data collection. Household surveys and focus groups were conducted to discover the type, level and effects of disasters. Probit regression analysis was performed to assess the relationship between various disasters with overall income, agricultural production and outward migration. Results from image analysis showed an overall 30 % increase in shrimp culture ponds in the past 13 years. Agricultural land and vegetation decreased by 48 and 3 %, respectively. Barren and built-up areas incr...\n\nWe are trying our best to reach the status of middle-income country but an earthquake of magnitude of 7 or above can shatter that dream, prevent us from achieving the sustainable development goals, slow down growth, and push us down to a lower economic status. We talk about earthquakes and then we quickly forget about them. We talk about earthquakes when a tremor jolts Bangladesh. We panic, we jump out of high buildings, we get injured, and we lose our family members and neighbours, we lose our lives. However, preparedness, better planning, community engagement, mitigation measures and continued awareness programme can save lives and asset from any earthquake in Bangladesh."
