        "text": "This article is about the city. For the upazilas, see Comilla Adarsha Sadar Upazila and Comilla Sadar Dakshin Upazila. For the district, see Comilla District. For the proposed division, see Comilla Division.\n\nComilla (; Bengali: কুমিল্লা, romanized: Kumillā, Bengali pronunciation: [kumilla]), officially spelled Cumilla from April 2018,[1][2] is a city in the Chittagong Division of Bangladesh, located along the Dhaka-Chittagong Highway. It is the administrative centre of the Comilla District, part of the Chittagong Division. The name Comilla was derived from Komolangko (কমলাঙ্ক), meaning the pond of lotus.\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nAncient era[edit]\n\nThe Comilla region was once under ancient Samatata and was joined with Tripura State. This district came under the reign of the kings of the Harikela in the ninth century AD. Lamai Mainamati was ruled by the Deva dynasty (eighth century AD), and (during the 10th and mid-11th century AD). In 1732, it became the centre of the Bengal-backed domain of Jagat Manikya.[3]\n\nThe Peasants’ Movement against the king of Tripura in 1764, which originally formed under the leadership of Shamsher Gazi is a notable historical event in Comilla.[4] It came under the rule of East India Company in 1765. This district was established as the Tripura district in 1790. It was renamed Comilla in 1960. Chandpur and Brahmanbaria subdivisions of this district were transformed into districts in 1984.\n\nBritish era[edit]\n\nCommunal tension spread over Comilla when a Muslim was shot in the town during the partition of Bengal in 1905. On 21 November 1921, Kazi Nazrul Islam composed patriotic songs and tried to awaken the townspeople by protesting the Prince of Wales's visit to India.[5] During this time, Avay Ashram, as a revolutionary institution, played a significant role. Poet Rabindranath Tagore and Mahatma Gandhi visited Comilla at that time. In 1931, approximately 4000 peasants in Mohini village in Chauddagram Upazila revolted against a land revenue tax. The British Gurkha soldiers fired indiscriminately on the crowd, killing four people.[6] In a major peasant gathering, the police fired at Hasnabad of Laksam Upazila in 1932. Two people were killed and many were wounded. Comilla Victoria Government College in the city was named in memory of Queen Victoria. And the people of Comilla were recognized as ITOR by the British people that means they were intellectual, talented, obedient, and reliable (ITOR). The main meaning of a conversation is that the people of Comilla have always maintained good relations and harmonized with others.[7]\n\nWorld War II[edit]\n\nComilla Cantonment is an important military base and the oldest in East Bengal. It was widely used by the British Indian Army during World War II. It was the headquarter of the British 14th Army.
