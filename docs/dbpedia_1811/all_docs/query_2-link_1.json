Traffic jams or tailbacks of 25 kilometres (16 miles) have been reported.[7] In 2009, it was estimated that daily usage of the highway was 20,000–25,000 motorised vehicles, up 40% of which were trucks.[2]\n\nThe highway forms a critical component of the proposed Asian Highway Network route AH41 and the Central-South-East Asian economic corridor, including initiatives such as BCIM.[citation needed]\n\nExpansion and development\n\n[edit]\n\nDhaka–Chittagong highway\n\n[edit]\n\nFour lanes\n\n[edit]\n\nIn January 2010, construction work to expand the Dhaka–Chittagong stretch from two to four lanes commenced.[8] The project was expected to decrease travel time from Dhaka to Chittagong to 4.5 or 5 hours.[3]\n\nAs of March 2013, only 23.5 per cent of work has been completed, and it was unlikely to meet its December 2013 deadline. Construction included 221 culverts, 22 bridges and three flyovers.[9] Reza Construction Ltd. and Sino Hydro have set temporary camps for this purpose respectively near Daudkandi and Chandina in Comilla District.[1]\n\nAfter inauguration being postponed several times, the project, implemented by the Roads and Highways Department (RHD), was finally completed and opened on 2 July 2016, three years behind schedule and a full decade after the plan was approved.[10][11]\n\nThe total cost for the expansion of the stretch was ৳3817 crore (US$320 million), up from the initial estimate of ৳2161 crore (US$180 million) in 2006.[12]\n\nEight lanes\n\n[edit]\n\nAn upgrade of the Dhaka–Chittagong section to eight lanes to start construction by late 2024 or early 2025 is on the cards. Portions of the 229-kilometre (142 mi) road will be converted into six lanes, while others will be expanded to eight lanes. The total cost of the project is estimated at ৳73150 crore (US$6.2 billion). The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide financing for this project—which is going to be implemented in three phases—according to the RHD.[13][14]\n\nChittagong–Cox's Bazar highway\n\n[edit]\n\nBypass lanes\n\n[edit]\n\nThe RHD is planning to alleviate traffic congestion on the Chittagong–Cox's Bazar route by constructing bypass lanes and flyovers at five crucial points. This initiative is prompted by the upcoming opening of the Matarbari Deep Sea Port in 2026, which is anticipated to increase traffic on the current two-lane highway. The project includes the construction of four-lane bypasses at Patiya (5.4 kilometres (3.4 mi)), Dohazari (3.3 kilometres (2.1 mi)), Lohagara (5.1 kilometres (3.2 mi)), and Chakaria (6.8 kilometres (4.2 mi)), along with a six-lane flyover at Keranihat (3.5 kilometres (2.2 mi)).[15]\n\nFour lanes\n\n[edit]\n\nThe RHD is also upgrading the Chittagong–Cox's Bazar highway to four lanes, at an initial estimated cost of ৳18000 crore (US$1.5 billion). This project aims to expand 110 kilometres (68 mi) of the 169 kilometres (105 mi) highway into four lanes, as sections of the highway have already been upgraded earlier.[14]\n\nRoute description\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Dhaka District\n\n[edit]\n\nFrom Jatrabari to Signboard 6 km in Dhaka District.\n\nIn Narayanganj District\n\n[edit]\n\nThis highway runs on three Upazilas of Narayangaj district.
