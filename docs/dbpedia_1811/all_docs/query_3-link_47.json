        "text": "This is a study of the gendered aspects of armed conflict. It explores gender relations between men and women and demonstrates how different groups of women and men experience, participate in and respond to ethnically-constructed armed conflict in southeast Bangladesh. It examines in which ways and to what extent their experiences in the conflict have been gendered. It is also a narrative about people’s longing to belong, and an attempt to understand the gendered embodiments of nationalism in a post-colonial location in the global south, Bangladesh. The concepts of gender and ethnicity are integral to much feminist research in the field of conflict and peace studies, which has looked at the transformations of conflict, interrogating the power relations between women and men, and addressed, more recently, the added symbolic meaning and representation of gendered violence in conflict. However, studies have focused either on the ‘material reality’ or on the symbolic aspects of gender and ethnicity, and have rarely focused on the situated and contested aspects of gender relations between women and men in historically specific armed conflict. This thesis moves beyond a structural assessment of conflict and avoids a gender versus culture analysis; its aim is to develop a more nuanced understanding of the lived experiences of different groups of women and men in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT). The research offers a three-level investigation: it looks at whether and how structural inequalities contribute to the making of the armed conflict and gendered violence; it provides a discursive analysis of narratives of sexual violence against women; and it offers an intersectional analysis of the lived experiences of women and men in the nationalist movement and armed conflict. The study considers the spatial, material, relational and changeable aspects of the nationalist movement and armed conflict to reveal that the experiences of different groups of women and men have been gendered in heterogeneous ways. The research demonstrates that the conflict in the CHT is a highly gendered phenomenon, yet ‘situated’ so that women and men, and Bengali and Jumma people, experience the conflict in different ways. Economic exploitation and state assimilation of the Jumma people are obvious factors in the making of the conflict; however, the phenomena of gendered violence and the subjectivity of Jumma women to sexual violence during and after the armed conflict are not merely the effects of male supremacy or the international politics of militarisation. What the Jumma women experience in the conflict is much more complex. Their lived experiences are informed by their ethnicity, nationality, culture and gender. Likewise, the responses of the Jummos and civilian Bengalese are informed by: their political goals, collective sentiment and sense of belonging; nationalist ideologies, political values and practices; a longing to demonstrate a difference and a culturally distinctive identity; performing chosen and appropriate roles; and the desire and ability to negotiate with shifting lifestyles, embodying their experience of the material situation, and the repetitions of daily life in a changing society. It is the contestations of all these factors, which illustrate the complexity of the phenomenon of gendered violence and the gendered aspects of the conflict in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. This study recognises that the state, as a momentous social actor, contributes to the making of the nationalist projects and ensuing conflict with gendered violence. But the women and men living the conflict are agents in their own lives, and never victims per se. The findings are based on my ethnographic fieldwork, narrative interviews with Jumma women and men, semi-structured interviews with Bengali women, men, mediators and actors, and library research on the topic. Meanings in this research are co-constructed between me as a feminist researcher and my interviewees, and do not necessarily reflect any general ‘truths’."
