Sheikh Hasina will place the proposals during her speech at the 74th UNGA which is scheduled to be delivered on September 27. These proposals are Myanmar must express clear political will manifested by concrete actions for sustainable return and reintegration of Rohingyas to Myanmar, and Myanmar must build trust among Rohingyas by discarding discriminatory laws and practices and allowing \"go-and-see\" visits to Northern Rakhine by Rohingya representatives. The other two proposals are Myanmar must guarantee the security and safety of Rohingyas, among others, by deploying civilian monitors from the international community in Rakhine, and the international community must ensure that the root causes of the Rohingya problem area addressed while atrocious crimes committed against Rohingyas are accounted for. The OIC initiative to take the issue to ICJ is indeed a significant step towards that direction. Sheikh Hasina made the announcement while addressing the High Level Side Event on Situation of Rohingya Minority in Myanmar Organized by the Permanent Mission of Bangladesh and the OIC Secretariat at the Conference Room 11 of the UN headquarters. At the 72nd UNGA, she had offered a 5- point proposal, which included the full implementation of recommendations of the Kofi Annan Commission, and the establishment of a \"civilian monitored safe zone\" in the Rakhine State. The Prime Minister firmly reiterated that the Rohingya crisis is a political one deeply rooted in Myanmar and thus its solution has to be found inside Myanmar. Hasina categorically said the Rohingyas must be able to return to their homes where they lived for centuries. She mentioned that it was regrettable that yet another year has passed by without any solution to the Rohingya crisis. The plight of the Rohingyas - persecuted in the Northern Rakhine state of Myanmar-is continuing unabatedly. According to the UN reports, Rohingyas have been victims of atrocity crimes. She said Bangladesh has been hosting 1.1 million forcibly deported Myanmar nationals. \"We opened our borders for these people in the spirit of humanitarianism, which is a pervading moral fiber of Islam. We'll continue to do everything possible to ensure the basic needs of the Rohingyas pending their return to their homeland. We've allocated over 6800 acres of forest land for sheltering them incurring huge ecological hazard and environmental destruction,\" she said. Asian Development Bank (ADB) on Wednesday projected 8 percent GDP growth DHAKA : The Asian Development Bank (ADB) on Wednesday projected 8 percent GDP growth in Bangladesh in the current fiscal year indicating that the country will continue as the fastest growing economy in Asia and the Pacific, reports UNB. The multilateral lending agency attributed the growth to continued buoyant exports, robust private consumption with higher remittances, accommodative monetary policy, ongoing reform to improve business climate for private investment, and public infrastructure investment. On the supply side, sustained strong growth in industry and agriculture are expected to be the main drivers of growth in FY2020, said the ADB. \"Bangladesh economy is in a good shape and is likely to continue to grow. At 8 percent growth in FY2020, ADB's outlook indicates that Bangladesh is likely to continue as the fastest growing economy in Asia and the Pacific,\" said ADB Country Director Manmohan Parkash adding that favourable trade prospects are expected to continue despite a weaker global growth. Launching the Asian Development Outlook (ADO) <strong>2019</strong> Update at its office in the city, he said exports and remittances are likely to be further strengthened. \"Strong public investment due to continued policy environment and expediting implementation of large infrastructure projects are also envisaged. We see such momentum to continue in FY2020,\" said the ADB Country Director. Parkash said such strong performance and prospects are commendable, especially under the current situation and near term forecast of moderating growth in developing Asia. To sustain this momentum in the medium- to long-term, the ADB Country Director said there are several challenges the country needs to overcome. He said Bangladesh requires expanded industrial base, a diversified export basket, equitable development in urban and rural areas, and a sound financial system as the ADB indicated in the previous Bangladesh country chapters. The ADB Country Director said the authorities must speed up reforms to improve the business environment for vibrant private sector development. The implementation of the VAT law is a welcome development. However,the further expansion of tax base and promotion of efficient tax administration are required for improved resource mobilization, he said. The ADB Country Director said Bangladesh also needs to further develop human capital to meet the growing needs from private sector. sport Mahmudullah ready to take up captaincy for Bangladesh >Page 9 On Tuesday, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina exchanged greeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New York.
