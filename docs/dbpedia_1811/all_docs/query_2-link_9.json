For the subdistrict, see Khulna Kotwali Thana.\n\nMetropolis in Khulna Division, Bangladesh\n\nKhulna (Bengali: খুলনা, [ˈkʰulna]) is the third-largest city in Bangladesh, after Dhaka and Chittagong. It is the administrative center of the Khulna District and the Khulna Division. Khulna's economy is the third-largest in Bangladesh, contributing $53 billion in gross regional domestic product and $95 billion in purchasing power parity (PPP) in 2020. In the 2024 census, the city corporation area had a population of 884,445.\n\nKhulna is on the Rupsha and Bhairab River, a strategic point in southwestern Bangladesh. It is also a center of Bangladeshi industry, hosting many of the nation's largest companies. It is served by the Port of Mongla, Bangladesh's second-largest seaport.\n\nA colonial steamboat service, which includes the Tern, Osrich and Lepcha, operates on the river route to the city. Khulna is considered the gateway to the Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest and home of the Bengal tiger. It is north of the Mosque City of Bagerhat, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nKhulna was part of the ancient kingdoms of Vanga, Gangaridai and Samatata. After the end of the Pala Empire, it was ruled by the Sena dynasty during the 12th-century reign of Ballala Sena, and formed part of the Bagri division of Bengal. During the 14th century, Shamsuddin Firoz Shah was the first Muslim ruler to arrive in the city. Muslim settlements increased during the time of Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah, and many mosques and shrines were established. A Muslim saint, Khan Jahan Ali, acquired a jagir (fiefdom) encompassing a large part of Khulna Division from the king of Gauḍa during the 15th century and renamed the region as Jahanabad. Ali ruled until he died in 1459.\n\nAfter Ali's death, the city became part of the Bengal Sultanate. During the reign of Daud Khan Karrani in the 16th century, Vikramaditya (one of Karrani's chief ministers) obtained a grant in southern Bengal—including Khulna—when Karrani was fighting the Mughals. Vikramaditya established a sovereign kingdom with its capital at Iswaripur (in present-day Satkhira District). He was succeeded by his son, Pratapaditya, who gained preeminence over the Baro-Bhuyans and controlled southern Bengal. Vikramaditya was defeated by Raja Man Singh I, a Hindu Rajput general of the Mughal emperor Akbar, in 1611.\n\nKhulna was ruled by autonomous Bengali nawabs until 1793 when the British East India Company abolished nizamat (local rule) and took control of the city. Becoming part of Jessore District in 1842, it became the headquarters of Khulna District (the Khulna and Bagerhat subdivisions of Jessore District, the Satkhira subdivision of 24 Parganas district, and the Sundarbans) in 1882. Khulna had a pouroshava (municipal council) in 1884, which became a municipal corporation in 1984.\n\nBefore 19 August 1947, Khulna District was part of undivided Bengal.
