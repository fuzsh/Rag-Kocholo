        "text": "This paper examines per capita income convergence across six divisions–– Dhaka, Chittagong, Rajshahi, Khulna, Sylhet, and Barisal––in Bangladesh using annual data during 1977-2000. The methodology uses ordinary least squares as well as time series ap proach, specifically unit root and cointegration techniques. The findings, however, do not provide enough evidence in favour of th e convergence hypothesis even though the regions have similar socio-economic background and physical infrastructure, and access to the same financial system , administrative institutions, and technology. The series of income deviations from the benchmark fail to reject the null of non-stationarity in most cases. However, the presence of cointegration between various economic factors and the leading regions suggests the presence of long-run equilibrium relationship among them. Therefore, proper attention in terms of providing infrastructural as well as technological and financial supports to the lagging regio...\n\nThis paper examines the inequality and convergence of districts of West Bengal using the neo-classical convergence theory. The district domestic product (DDP) has been used to understand the regional inequality pattern and convergence among the 18 districts of West Bengal. The estimated σ-convergence and unconditional β-convergence reveal uneven growth among the districts. The σ-convergence measured in terms of log SD and CV shows rising trend during the study period. The dispersion amongst districts, measured in terms of log standard deviation of per capita income, increased from 7.54 in 1993-94 to 8.87 in 2007-08. The estimated result of unconditional β-convergence also supports the hypothesis that rich districts grow faster than the poor ones. The positive and significant correlation coefficient between gross DDP and various socioeconomic variables also support economic reasoning that districts with higher per capita income have higher level of urbanization, literacy, banking inf...\n\nThis article examines the nature of spatial dimensions of poverty in Bangladesh by undertaking an in-depth investigation of inter-temporal divergence and convergence in poverty levels. Based on the estimations of Alkire–Foster Multidimensional Poverty Index (A–F MPI) for selected years, the article compares trends in broader dimensions of spatial poverty in Bangladesh with income poverty trends available for corresponding periods. The article scrutinizes the validity of the so-called ‘East–West divide’ in view of poverty levels in Bangladesh. The results evince a number of interesting insights. First, trends of income poverty in Bangladesh are not aligned with those of multidimensional poverty. Second, the levels of inter-temporal poverty as per MPI are relatively higher for the rural–urban divide and also at sub-national (division) levels. Third, inter-temporal trends of divergence–convergence in terms of income poverty relating to the East–West divide do not match corresponding mo...\n\nThis paper investigates the causal relationship between urbanization and per capita income of Bangladesh for the sample period of 1972- 2018. Both the Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) and Phillips-Perron (PP) tests are applied to find the existence of unit root in each of the time series data collected from World Development Indicators (WDI). To observe the long-run relationship between urbanization and per capita income this study relies on Johansen- Juselius cointegration technique. Empirical results of this paper confirm the presence of long-run relationship between the variables. The Granger causality test shows that causality between urbanization and per capita income is bi-directional.\n\nHistory of development and progress has seen divergence and convergence across regions both between countries and within the country throughout the history. The widespread regional disparity is an important economic and political issue. The forces of globalisation are expected to reduce the gap between rich and poor regions thereby reducing the disparities considerably due to overwhelming impetus of convergence forces. Many studies have studied the trends and patterns of regional convergence and divergence. South Asia has an important place in various regions of the world as it is home to around 24 percent of world population and it is both the most populous and the most densely populated geographical region in the world. The current territories of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka form the countries of South Asia. In recent periods South Asia has been second largest growing region of the world but it is home to the largest number of people living amid poverty with widespread under-nutrition and other health related degradations. The present paper analysed inter-country disparities in the south Asian countries. The aim is to study the trends in various indicators of social and economic development with a view to identify the possible impacts of these divergences and convergences. Theoretically, a divergence in poverty and poor social outcomes would indicate that poor regions are trapped in low-level equilibrium traps. The paper analyses data obtained from World Bank data indicators and estimated convergence and divergence trends in various indicators. The paper found high level of regional disparity derived on the basis of both nominal GDP and per capita GDP."
