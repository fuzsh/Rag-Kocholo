        "text": "The New Yorker, November 2, 1968 P. 52\n\nThe author learned of Pedro Damian's death in a letter from a friend who was translating Emerson's poem \"The Past.\" Damian had joined the rebel army when the Uraguayan revolution broke out in 1904. After the final battle, in 1905, he had returned to his home, living alone and working as a gaucho until his death in 1946. In his final illness, Damian had relived the battle of Masoller, the final defeat of the rebels. Interested in writing a story on the battle, the author visited Colonel Tabares, who vividly remembered Damian as a coward. The author was stunned and realized that Damian had lived alone out of shame. When the author returned to speak to the Colonel, he had a visitor, Dr. Amaro, who remembered only that Damian had died a magnificent and heroic death on the battlefield. The Colonel, on the other hand, could not recall Damian at all. A few months later, the author received aletter from the Colonel who gave his recollections of Damian and his courageous death. The author speculated on these contradictions. Perhaps, he thought, there had been two Damians, or perhaps the aloof gaucho who returned from Masolla had been a ghost. His solution, since no one seemed to remember Damian clearly, was that he had been a coward, and that God, unable to change the past, as in Emerson's poem, had, instead, altered human memory of the event, allowing Damian to die bravely in the battle he relived in his delirium."
