Clay Gabler (Virginia Tech), Craig P. Thor (Virginia Tech), and John Hinch (NHTSA), August 2008, DOT HS 811 01\n\nABSTRACT: This report describes a preliminary evaluation of the field performance of occupant restraint systems designed with advanced air bag features including those specified in the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 208 for advanced air bags, through the use of event data recorders. Although advanced restraint systems have been extensively tested in the laboratory, we are only beginning to understand the performance of these systems in the field. Because EDRs record many of the inputs to the advanced air bag control module, these devices can provide unique insights into the characteristics of field performance of air bags. This research program investigates the feasibility of using EDR data to evaluate advanced air bags. Specifically, this report discusses (1) the development of an expanded EDR dataset based on data retrieved from NASS/CDS 2005, SCI, and CIREN in-depth crash investigations, (2) the validation of the accuracy of EDRs in full-scale crash tests, and (3) the feasibility of using EDRs to monitor the performance of advanced air bag restraints in real-world crashes\n\nFinal Report [PDF]\n\nAnalysis of Event Data Recorder Data for Vehicle Safety Improvement\n\nby Marco P. daSilva, Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (VRTC), Cambridge, MA., April 2008, DOT HS 810 935 Analysis of Event Data Recorder Data for Vehicle Safety Improvement\n\nABSTRACT: The Volpe Center performed a comprehensive engineering analysis of Event Data Recorder (EDR) data supplied by NHTSA to assess its accuracy and usefulness in crash reconstruction and improvement of vehicle safety systems. The Volpe Center gathered and analyzed 2,541 EDR files downloaded from the National Automotive Sampling System (NASS), Special Crash Investigations (SCI), and Crash Injury Research & Engineering Network (CIREN) databases supplied by NHTSA. The analyses focused on EDR file format and potential improvements, assessment of crash types where EDR data exists, review of EDR data for accuracy and completeness, EDR data comparisons with existing crash data, review of pre-crash, crash, and post-crash data for usefulness in better understanding the crash reconstruction, identification of error sources, and determination of methods by which researchers could use the EDR data to improve their crash case information. The results of the engineering analysis show that EDR data can objectively report real-world crash data and therefore be a powerful investigative and research tool, by providing very useful information to crash reconstructionists and vehicle safety researchers. Due to significant limitations however, EDR data should always be used in conjunction with other data sources.\n\nFinal Report [PDF]\n\nNational Cooperative Highway Research Program Research Project Statement, Project 17-24, FY 2002 Use of Event Data Recorder Technology for Roadside Crash Data Analysis\n\nABSTRACT: An important function of the Transportation Research Board is the stimulation of research toward the solution of problems facing the transportation community. One of the techniques employed by technical committees in support of this function is the identification of problems, and the development and dissemination of research problem statements. The aim of this activity is to provide information to governmental agencies, research institutes, industry, the academic community and others in allocating scarce resources to the solution of transportation problems. There is a critical need to obtain accurate and reliable real-world crash data to improve vehicle and highway safety. The use of event data recorder information has the ability to profoundly affect roadside safety. EDRs are capable of capturing vehicle dynamics data, such as vehicle speed; lateral and longitudinal acceleration-time histories; principal direction of force on the vehicle; the status of braking, steering, seat belt usage, and air bag deployment; and other valuable crash information. This represents a new source of objective data for the highway and vehicle safety community because it will provide a real-world connection between controlled test results and actual field performance of vehicles and highway design features. EDRs have the potential to capture a large number of crash-related and other data elements for a wide range of users with different data needs. The data elements related to improving vehicle safety and driver performance are being used, but little has been done to apply the data elements to roadside safety analysis. Research can identify data elements relevant to roadside safety and improve methods to retrieve, store, and access these data.(Source: Transportation Research Board)\n\nProject Statement\n\nFinal Report\n\nInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Press Release Announcing World's First Automotive Black Box Standard (9/28/04)\n\nABSTRACT: Driven by a lack of uniform scientific crash data needed to make vehicle and highway transportation safer and reduce fatalities, the IEEE has created IEEE 1616, the first universal standard for motor vehicle event data recorders (MVEDRs) much like those that monitor crashes on aircraft and trains.\n\nSponsor: IEEE Vehicular Technology/Land Transportation\n\nTitle: IEEE 1616: Standard for Motor Vehicle Event Data Recorders (MVEDRs)\n\nStatus: Approved Publication of IEEE, Published Date: Dec 10, 2004\n\nContact: For non technical questions, including pricing, availability and ordering, please contact IEEE Customer Service at 800-678-IEEE (in the U.S.and Canada); or 732-981-0060 (outside the U.S. and Canada); or send a detail email to customer- service@ieee.org. To purchase this standard, or for pricing and availability go to http://shop.ieee.org/ieeestore and type in the standard number.\n\nHistory: PAR APP: Dec. 06, 2001, BD APP: Sept. 23, 2004\n\nProject scope: Motor Vehicle Event Data Recorders (MVEDRs) collect, record, store and export data related to motor vehicle pre-defined events. This standard defines a protocol for MVEDR output data compatibility and export protocols of MVEDR data elements. This standard does not prescribe which specific data elements shall be recorded, or how the data are to be collected, recorded and stored. It is applicable to event data recorders for all types of motor vehicles licensed to operate on public roadways, whether offered as original or aftermarket equipment, whether stand-alone or integrated within the vehicle.\n\nProject purpose: Many light-duty motor vehicles, and increasing numbers of heavy commercial vehicles, are equipped with some form of MVEDR. These systems, which are designed and produced by individual motor vehicle manufacturers and component suppliers, are diverse in function, and proprietary in nature. The continuing implementation of MVEDR systems provides an opportunity to voluntarily standardize data output and retrieval protocols to facilitate analysis and promote compatibility of MVEDR data. Adoption of the standard will therefore make MVEDR data more accessible and useful to end users.\n\nPress Release FULL DOCUMENT\n\nITSC 2004 -- Automotive Black Box Panel - All Things Considered, 7th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems, October 3-6, Washington, DC.\n\nABSTRACT: This presentation provides an overview of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Standards Association Motor Vehicle Event Data Recorder Standards Initiatives. It also provides insight on this emerging technology from the perspective of a panel of experts from government, industry and advocates.\n\nLink: http://www.itsc2004.org/\n\nSociety of Automotive Engineers Standards\n\nDocument Number: J1698 - Vehicle Event Data Interface - Vehicular Output Data Definition (December 2003)\n\nScope: This recommended practice aims to establish a common format for displaying and presenting crash-related data recorded and stored within certain electronic components currently installed in many light-duty vehicles. This recommended practice pertains only to the post-download format of such data and is not intended to standardize the format of the data stored within any on-board storage unit, or to standardize the method of data recording, storing, or extraction. Historically, crash data recording technology in light-duty vehicles has developed and evolved based on differing technical needs of manufacturers and their customers without industry standards or government regulation. As a result, wide variations currently exist among vehicle manufacturers regarding the scope and extent of recorded data. For this reason, this recommended practice is not intended to standardize or mandate the recording of any specific data element or to specify a minimum data set. Rather, it is intended to be a compilation of data elements and parameters that various manufacturers are currently recording, as well as those elements reasonably predicted to be recorded in the foreseeable future, and to establish a common format for display and presentation of that data so recorded. This version of the recommended practice is limited in application to vehicular data recorded in single frontal-impact events. Provisions for multiple-impact events may be included in the next version. Side-impact and rollover events may be addressed at a later time.\n\nDocument Number: J1698/1 - Vehicle Event Data Interface Vehicular Output Data Definition\n\nScope: This document is part of the J1698 document family, and provides the definitions for event-related data items.\n\nDocument Number: J1698/2 - Vehicle Event Data Interface-Vehicular Data Extraction (May 2004)\n\nScope: This Recommended Practice is intended to define a common method for determining how to extract Event Data from a motor vehicle, including the Event Data Set needed to output the Event Record of data elements defined in SAE J 1698. It is intended for use by those developing tools for the purpose of Event Data Set extraction. This Recommended Practices aims to utilize existing industry standards to define a common physical interface and the protocols necessary to Event Data Set extraction. To accomplish this, the SAE J 1962 Diagnostics Connector has been designed the primary physical interface and associated industry standard diagnostic protocols have been designated for communications.\n\nLink: http://www.sae.org\n\nNHTSA Notice of Proposed Rulemaking - Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards - Event Data Recorders - Document NHTSA-2004-18029-2 06/14/04\n\nABSTRACT: This proposal addresses event data recorders that record safety information about motor vehicles involved in crashes. Manufacturers have been voluntarily installing EDRs as standard equipment in increasingly larger numbers of light vehicles in recent years. They are now being installed in the vast majority of new vehicles. The information collected by EDRs aids investigations of the causes of crashes and injuries, and makes it possible to better define and address safety problems. The information can be used to improve motor vehicle safety systems and standards. As the use and capabilities of EDRs increase, opportunities for additional safety benefits, especially with regard to emergency medical treatment, may become available. We are not presently proposing to require the installation of EDRs in any motor vehicles. We are proposing to (1) require that the EDRs voluntarily installed in light vehicles record a minimum set of specified data elements useful for crash investigations, analysis of the performance of safety equipment, e.g., advanced restraint systems, and automatic collision notification systems; (2) specify requirements for data format; (3) increase the survivability of the EDRs and their data by requiring that the EDRs function during and after the front, side and rear vehicle crash tests specified in several Federal motor vehicle safety standards; (4) require vehicle manufacturers to make publicly available information that would enable crash investigators to retrieve data from the EDR; and (5) require vehicle manufacturers to include a brief standardized statement in the owner's manual indicating that the vehicle is equipped with an EDR and describing the purposes of EDRs.\n\nFULL DOCUMENT\n\nNHTSA Request for Comments Regarding--Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards -- Event Data Recorders -- Document NHTSA-2002-13546-1 10/11/02\n\nABSTRACT: Over the past several years, NHTSA has been actively involved with Event Data Recorders (EDRs) in motor vehicles. EDRs collect vehicle and occupant based crash information. The agency's involvement has included sponsoring two working groups, using data from EDRs in crash investigations, and conducting research and development. Particularly since the two working groups have completed their work, we request comments on what future role the agency should take related to the continued development and installation of EDRs in motor vehicles.\n\nFULL DOCUMENT\n\nEDRs - Summary of Findings - NHTSA EDR Working Group (8/01)\n\nABSTRACT: This report documents the findings of the Event Data Recorder (EDR) working group established by the NHTSA's Motor Vehicle Safety Research Advisory Committee. In 1997, the National Transportation Safety Board issued recommendations to pursue vehicle crash information-gathering using event data recorders. In early 1998, NHTSA's Office of Research and Development launched a new effort to form a working group comprised of industry, academia, and governmental organizations. The members of the working group participated in the forum to study the state-of-the-art of EDRs. Meetings were held on a regular basis, culminating in this EDR findings report.\n\nThe following selected findings present the highlights of the report:\n\nEDRs have the potential to greatly improve highway safety, for example, by improving occupant protection systems and improving the accuracy of crash reconstructions.\n\nEDR technology has potential safety applications for all classes of motor vehicles.\n\nA wide range of crash-related and other data elements have been identified which might usefully be captured by future EDR systems.\n\nNHTSA has incorporated EDR data collection in its motor vehicle research databases.\n\nOpen access to EDR data (minus personal identifiers) will benefit researchers, crash investigators, and manufacturers in improving safety on the highways.\n\nof EDRs in Europe and the U.S. have shown that driver and employee awareness of an onboard EDR reduces the number and severity of crashes.\n\nGiven the differing nature of cars, vans, SUVs, and other lightweight vehicles, compared to heavy trucks, school buses, and motor coaches, different EDR systems may be required to meet the needs of each vehicle class.\n\nThe degree of benefit from EDRs is directly related to the number of vehicles operating with an EDR and the current infrastructure's ability to use and assimilate this data.\n\nAutomatic crash notification (ACN) systems integrate the on-board crash sensing and EDR technology with other electronic systems, such as global positioning systems and cellular telephones, to provide early notification of the occurrence, nature, and location of a serious collision.\n\nMost systems use proprietary technology and require the manufacturer to download and analyze the data.\n\nPart 1 - FULL DOCUMENT File: 2.8MB\n\nPart 2 File: 2.3MB\n\nPart 3 File: 2.2MB\n\nPart 4 File: 2.2MB\n\nParts 1-4 File: 9.4MB\n\nNHTSA Event Data Recorders Summary of Findings by the NHTSA EDR Working Group, Volume II: Supplemental Findings for Trucks, Motor coaches, and School Buses, May 2002 Final Report DOT HS 809 432\n\nABSTRACT: Event Data Recorders (EDRs) are devices that record information related to highway vehicle crash. EDRs could have a major impact on highway safety, assisting in real-world data collection, better defining the auto safety problem, aiding law enforcement in understanding the specific aspects of a crash. This report summarizes the activities and findings of the NHTSA sponsored Truck and Bus Event Data Recorder Working Group (T&B EDR WG).\n\nThe T&B EDR WG focused its findings in three areas: data elements, survivability of the EDR data, and discussion on when data should be collected. Twenty-eight data elements were highlighted for inclusion in EDRs. These were subdivided as follows: 13 Priority 1 elements, 13Priority 2 elements, and 2 optional elements. Based on input from the WG members, manufacturers should focus on collecting the Priority 1 data elements and include Priority 2 data elements only as sensors to measure these characteristics become more commonplace, or as technology develops that would make them more feasible for large vehicles.\n\nThe T&B EDR WG felt that technology was now sufficiently developed for the two optional data elements, but chose not to include them at this time. The T&B EDR WG assessed the need for EDR data survivability and event description. They found that typical highway-vehicle crash characteristics were different from other modes, such as airplanes and trains, and as such, found that a unique set of survivability requirements were needed.\n\nGenerally, the T&B EDR WG found that EDR data should be collected when a substantial crash occurs, and thus advised that triggering the EDR should occur when the vehicle’s deceleration exceeded 2-4 g. In the process of developing the data elements, survivability, and event description findings, the T&B EDR WG felt the need for some research effort in certain areas. These areas have been identified. In the current fleet of large vehicles, very few employ EDR technology. Summary findings include: 1) EDRs have the potential to greatly improve truck, motor coach, and school bus vehicle safety, 2) Many manufacturers of engines for use in large vehicles have included memory modules in the engine’s electronic control unit (ECU) that collect vehicle data, and 3) Manufacturers of aftermarket EDRs have had limited success in deploying EDR technology into large vehicle fleets.\n\nFULL DOCUMENT:\n\nPerformance of Selected Event Data Recorders\n\nABSTRACT: This report describes the findings of a study to compare the performance of selected event data recorders in recording the crash environment for severe impact conditions.\n\nFULL DOCUMENT File: 67KB\n\nAir Bag Crash Investigations (18th ESV paper)\n\nABSTRACT: The performance of occupant protection systems, especially air bags, is of high interest to NHTSA. Since 1972, NHTSA has operated a Special Crash Investigations (SCI) program, which provides the agency with the flexibility to acquire detailed engineering information quickly on high visibility traffic crashes of special interest. The SCI collects in-depth crash data on new and rapidly changing technologies in real world crashes. NHTSA uses the data collected in this program and others to evaluate rulemaking actions. The data are also used by the automotive industry and other organizations to evaluate the performance of motor vehicle occupant protection systems such as air bags. This paper presents information from NHTSA's SCI program concerning crash investigations on air bag equipped vehicles. The paper provides information on data collection and findings in the NHTSA-sponsored air bag crash investigations, updating and expanding findings from the 17th Enhanced Safety of Vehicles paper “Air Bag Crash Investigations” by Chidester and Roston [Ref. 3]. Topics include air bag-related fatalities as a whole and by certification status; physical characteristics of occupants fatally injured by a deploying air bag; and an overview of special case studies available on NHTSA’s Web site.\n\nFULL DOCUMENT\n\nAssessing the Safety Benefit of Automatic Collision Avoidance Systems (18th ESV Paper)\n\nASTRACT: Throughout the last decade a number of advanced system concepts for improving safety, efficiency, environmental compatibility and comfort of driving have emerged. One of these, Automatic Collision Avoidance Systems (ACAS) aims to help drivers avoid accidents by alerting them to a potential collision and initiating braking. This paper assesses the safety effects of ACAS by examining driver response during emergency braking situations.\n\nFULL DOCUMENT\n\nChange of Velocity and Crash Pulse Characteristics in Rear Impacts: Real-World Data and Vehicle Tests (18th ESV Paper)\n\nASTRACT: Impact severity in collisions that can cause soft-tissue neck injuries are most commonly specified in terms of change of velocity. However, it has been shown from real-world collisions that mean acceleration influences the risk of these injuries. For a given change of velocity this means an increased risk for shorter duration of the crash pulse. Furthermore, dummy response in crash tests has shown to vary depending on the duration of the crash pulse for a given change of velocity. The range of duration for change of velocities suggested for sled te"
