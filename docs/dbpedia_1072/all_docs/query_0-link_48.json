His love of people showed in him being a wonderful grandad to his six grandchildren, he was always happy to see each one of them calling out when he saw them in the same way as a great friend appearing and remembering every one of them right into his ill health. Dad’s love of people also showed in how he would love to go walking round the neighbourhood with the dogs when he still had them but latterly on his own and he would come back having spoken to at least a dozen people on his way round - he would often fondly talk about a neighbour or dog walker knowing many details of their lives. Dad was also a man of many interests taking up different activities throughout his life including sailing, painting, dancing and singing and both mum and dad instilled the principle of activities within myself and my brother.\n\nHe was of course a quiet man as well enjoying sitting reading books and listening to music or the radio - dad would often have a stack of books to read and latterly ended up buying book after book on kindle when he discovered that very convenient technology - I also remember running round the library as a child while I picked out books that dad might be interested in reading\n\nJOHN MICHAEL BEHARRELL (L 49-53)\n\n1935 - 25TH MARCH 2024\n\nDOUGLAS ARCHIBALD COX (SH 50-54)\n\n1936 - 27TH MARCH 2024\n\nPETER NORMAN OLSEN (L 63-67)\n\n1948 - 26TH MARCH 2024\n\nDR COLIN CRANFORD ROBERTSON (W 49-54)\n\n1936 - 1st FEBRUARY 2024\n\nCHRISTOPHER WILLIAM STEUART-CORRY (S 51-55)\n\n1937 - 20TH FEBRUARY 2024\n\nTIMOTHY WILLIAM PROUDMAN (W 79)\n\n1962 - 22ND FEBRUARY 2024\n\nRead article in tribute to Tim HERE.\n\nDENIS BRUCE WILSON (S 51-55)\n\n1938 - 11TH FEBRUARY 2024\n\nEDWARD WILSON (TIM) HOULT (SH 47-52) 1933 - 26TH JUNE 2023\n\nIt is with great sadness that we advise you of the passing of Tim Hoult (SH 47-51).

He went on to Sedbergh from St Mary's prep school in Melrose. After a career in printing and publishing that took him to East Anglia and then London he retired in 1996 back to Northumberland.\n\nHe was a member of the 1525 Society and wore his society tie with pride at social events.\n\nHe leaves his wife, Jancis and three sons, Charles, William and Edward.\n\nDAVID LORIMER SIMPSON (E 52-57) 1938 - 2023\n\nDavid studied law at Edinburgh University.

He eventually became MD of Pasta Foods, then later a change of company to become MD of Jameson Chocolates, until they were taken over by Cadburys. Paul was very musical, encouraged at Sedbergh, so that most of his hobbies involved singing in choirs, and performing with amateur dramatic and light operatic societies. Paul's wife Carole told us that over the years they have called in to visit Sedbergh whenever in the area. Paul enjoyed reminiscing as they looked around School House and gazed across the beautiful cricket ground. Paul enjoyed cricket and rugby as a supporter all his life.\n\nMICHAEL RAW\n\nHead of History 1984 - 2015\n\nSedbergh School is saddened to record the death of former teacher, Michael Raw, on 27th May 2023. Educated at Haberdashers School and Queens College, Cambridge, Michael was invited to join the Common Room of Sedbergh School in 1984 as Head of the History Department.\n\nMichael was a generous colleague and a compelling teacher. His propensity for clear, erudite explanations of the subject matter combined with entertaining and often gruesome detail created an enviable level of engagement with his pupils.\n\nUnashamed of his eccentricities Michael chuckled at the reputation he enjoyed. Pupils recall the windows of Room 13 open all year round, in sun, wind and even the odd Cumbrian snow storm. Michael was a willing judge for any school competition from house drama to academic challenge. His cutting, occasionally brutal critique of pupils’ performance could certainly not be called pithy but was always entertaining, apt and often surprisingly edifying.\n\nAfter writing in his early adulthood for amongst others the Cambridge footlights and 'Not The Nine O'clock News' Michael had to content himself with writing and performing in Sedbergh's own sketch show 'A kick in the stalls' and its various sequels. One particularly memorable scene featured Michael in Y fronts grunting as a monosyllabic caveman. Shocking for pupils and colleagues alike this hilarious performance typified Michael in that it was funny, unashamed and perfectly pitched. When a spoof 'Micky Raw Sedbergh' twitter account emerged in 2012 readers were fairly sure that it was a parody - but with Michael anything was possible.\n\nMichael was unashamed of his determination to do things the old way and found that his genuine charm and warmth meant others wanted to accommodate him. His reluctance to use a computer was warmly indulged by the school secretary who typed his hand written pupil reports for many years after the Common Room embraced a computerised report system.\n\nMichael was a generous, entertaining and warm host who welcomed many colleagues and former pupils to his home. An evening at one of his successive Sedbergh residences was a richly sought after prize, particularly as it came with viewing rights to Michael's extensive collection of historic artefacts, modern art and an enviable library. Conversation was lively as Michael brought together friends from different aspects of his life, regailing them with stories of his work on radio and television comedy, and name dropping with ease.\n\nDuring a stint playing for the Harlequins Michael gained what he described as his ‘cauliflower ears’ as well as a keen sense of sportsmanship. At Sedbergh he coached the First XV from 1987-1991 and later moved to the B1 team with whom he stuck for much of his career.\n\nSedbergh has benefitted from Michael's writing and attention to literary detail over many decades, first during his time as editor of the Sedberghian and latterly as Michael was appointed to chronicle various aspects of the school's history. Prior to retiring from teaching Michael was invited to write ‘Thread of gold’, a history of Sedbergh School Football Club. He approached this with his trademark thoroughness reading every historic issue of the Sedberghian magazine, Captains’ minute book, Governors’ minute book and personal memoir available.\n\nIn recent years Michael undertook the substantial role of school historian, seeking to research and write a new history of the school in time for the 500th anniversary. Michael's diligence and integrity made him the perfect person for this role. He sought to accurately represent the community he served while ensuring that the individuals involved were portrayed compassionately. Michael's portrayal weaves the events of school life into the context of national and international history in a manner that elevates the book beyond the ambitions of many coffee table school histories. Michael died whilst writing the final chapter. The completist in him would have been slightly frustrated with the premature ending to his career as a writer but the comedian in him would have chuckled at the off beat timing.\n\nMichael travelled to the Baltic states in mid May for a much anticipated holiday. Unsurprisingly he travelled with a suitcase full of history books about the region, keen as always to expand his knowledge and engage deeply with his subject matter. Michael died in his sleep on holiday.\n\nMichael's death is a great loss to his many friends in the Sedbergh community and further afield. He was a special man who will be sadly missed.\n\nBy Katy de la Riviere\n\nBRIAN WEBB\n\nFormer member of staff who worked in the Mathematics Department from 1970 to 1987 sadly passed away in 2023.\n\nANTHONY PHILIP HUDSON (E 50-55)\n\n1936 - 27TH FEBRUARY 2023\n\nDAVID PHILIP MAYNE (SH40-44)\n\n1927 - 21ST JANUARY 2023\n\nDavid passed away in January aged 95 in Australia. His wife Diana has sent us an obituary which you can read here David Mayne obituary."
