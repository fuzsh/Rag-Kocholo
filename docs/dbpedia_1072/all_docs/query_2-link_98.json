        "text": "The City of Richmond’s onetime manager for its ballpark-anchored Diamond District project is back in the game, but this time on a different team.\n\nMaritza Pechin, who left City Hall last year for a job with the U.S. Department of Transportation, has joined Thalhimer Realty Partners as director of development with a sole initial focus on the Diamond District, the mixed-use portion of which TRP is developing with Chicago-based Loop Capital.\n\nPechin, who starts with TRP today, said she had no intention of leaving her federal gig when TRP principal Jason Guillot threw out the idea.\n\n“It was one of these things where the idea presented itself and I was like, ‘Huh, let me think about this,’” Pechin said.\n\nGuillot said the idea came to him while he and Pechin, who has remained based in Richmond, were catching up over a drink one day.\n\n“It was one of those things that was serendipitous: we’re just sitting there having a beer and I was like, ‘This may sound a little crazy, but what do you think about this?’” Guillot said.\n\nWhile she’d planned to stay on with the USDOT, the department led by Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and where her mother had worked and retired from, Pechin said the commute and travel involved and the time away from her family had begun to wear on her.\n\n“I have two little kids and I was traveling a lot for the DOT, and I wanted to be here,” Pechin said. “I wanted to do more project work, I wanted to be here more, and Richmond is the place where I’ve lived the longest in my entire life. I really like it. I want to be part of helping it continue to grow in a beautiful, equitable and sustainable way, so I’m excited to be on the developer side and get to do that.”\n\nWhile she’s most known in Richmond for her time at City Hall, where she started as an embedded consultant with national planning firm AECOM before joining the city’s planning department as a deputy director, Pechin’s background includes a stint in private development with Fulton Hill Properties, the local development firm led by Margaret Freund.\n\nThat varied experience, along with Pechin’s familiarity with Richmond and the Diamond District, put her at the top of a list of candidates that Guillot said TRP was considering to expand its team.\n\n“We have a number of projects at various stages of development across the city, so we always knew that we would need to expand our team as the (Diamond District) picked up steam, and this really is the right time to do it,” Guillot said, noting the approval of the project’s development agreement and pending land purchases for the mixed-use development’s initial phase.\n\n“One thing that has tremendous value is her institutional knowledge of the project, the process, how we got here and what the future is supposed to look like. There’s really no one else out there who could really match her,” he said. “This project needs to move quickly, so having someone who can hit the ground running is incredibly valuable.”\n\nAs the project manager for the Diamond District, Pechin helped lead the city’s solicitation process that drew submissions from 15 development teams. While that work included seeing the process through to a selection, Pechin noted she was not part of the project’s selection committee and said she did not have a say in the selection of TRP’s team.\n\n“I oversaw the process. I was more the person that made sure a selection was made, regardless of who was selected,” she said. “In many respects, I wasn’t even really part of the negotiations. The negotiations were really led by others in the city.”\n\nNoting her work in developing and then implementing the Richmond 300 plan that envisioned the Diamond District, Pechin added, “Now I get to help build it.”\n\nPechin’s hire brings TRP’s team to eight, half of whom are focused on the Diamond District specifically, Guillot said.\n\nThe development arm of commercial real estate brokerage Thalhimer, TRP is juggling multiple projects in town, including the Westhampton Commons development where it is headquartered, the Regency mall redevelopment with co-developer Rebkee Co., and the Novel Scott’s Addition apartments it’s developing with Crescent Communities across Arthur Ashe Boulevard from The Diamond.\n\nWhile her focus for the foreseeable future will be on the Diamond District, which is expected to take shape over several years, Pechin said she’s excited about getting back into private development after years on the public sector side, where Guillot noted she’s maintained relationships at City Hall.\n\n“The whole idea of a public-private partnership is you’re working day-in and day-out with these people at the city. She already has a great relationship with people at the top and at the bottom,” Guillot said. “Before we put things into place, we checked with the city, and they were thrilled. They were like, ‘This is awesome. This is great for the project.’”\n\nA groundbreaking for the Diamond District is expected this month, with site work on the stadium to start in the fall and TRP and Loop’s work on the rest of the development’s first phase to start early next year. The Richmond Flying Squirrels’ ownership group is leading development of the stadium.\n\nLast month, TRP and Loop were hit with a $40 million lawsuit by their former partner on the project, D.C.-based Republic Properties, which alleged that they cut it out of the project. Thalhimer’s CEO has called the lawsuit “baseless.”\n\nThe city is aiming for the stadium to be open in time for the 2026 baseball season, to satisfy facility standards required by Major League Baseball for all pro baseball venues.\n\nHaving watched the Diamond District evolve since last year in terms of its design and financing approach, Pechin said she comes into the project confident that it will be a success and she’ll get to see it through.\n\n“It’s going to happen. The city sold two separate bonds to make this happen; it’s moving,” she said. “We’ve already gotten this far on this project; significant milestones have passed. This will happen. It’s going to get done.”"
