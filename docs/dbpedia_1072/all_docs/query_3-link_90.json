Here are a few reasons why some individuals might view business ownership as more beneficial: 1. Potential for higher earnings. 2. Greater autonomy and control over decisions. 3. Opportunity for creativity and innovation. 4. Building asset value and long-term financial security. 5. Legacy building and societal impact. However, it's important to note that entrepreneurship also entails risks and responsibilities, and suitability depends on individual circumstances. Despite the risks and substantial responsibilities associated with business ownership, it offers significantly greater benefits and flexibilities compared to being a salaried individual. While this represents my viewpoint based on personal experiences, I acknowledge that perspectives may vary. I welcome any valuable insights and differing opinions on the matter.\n\nSpeaking to a headhunter can feel like a high-stakes experience - so I was slightly daunted to be speaking to 60 of them about purpose-led business at Perrett Laver yesterday. As a company that places leaders into the 'purpose-driven' sectors, the group was asking what it might mean to be a purpose-led business themselves. My answer went all the way back to the \"Wealth of Nations\", Adam Smith's seminal description of modern capitalism published in 1776. Ever since then, we have built global prosperity on the idea that profit and wellbeing are connected. The purpose movement is a response to the breakdown of this link. Only now are we learning what it has truly cost to achieve today's material wealth. The profit-maximisation doctrine, taken to its extreme in the last 50 years, has harmed the planet and left too many people out. But the doctrine is breaking. The British Academy stated in 2018 that \"the purpose of a corporation is to produce profitable solutions to the problems of people and planet. In the process it produces profits, but profits are not per se the purpose of corporations.\" The British Standards Institute goes even further, stating in its 2022 that organisations should exist \"to achieve an optimal strategic contribution to the long-term wellbeing of all people and planet\". It is easy to dismiss these ideas as idealistic or naive. But the shift is real: there is a strengthening intellectual consensus, growing demand from customers and employees, and emerging evidence that purposeful businesses outperform exploitative ones. Of course, breaking with a 250-year old orthodoxy comes with its challenges. We are living them every day at University of the Arts London, the organisation Perrett Laver placed me in last May, which in 2022 set out its intention to become a purpose-led organisation. Huge thanks to Ilona Motyer for the invitation and to the whole team at Perrett Laver for their excellent questions. I look forward to walking this path with you, and the many other organisations forging a new consensus."
