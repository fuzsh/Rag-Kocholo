        "text": "mail:\n\nBill Thayer\n\nItaliano\n\nHelp\n\nUp\n\nHome\n\nJames Wilkinson\n\nAÂ Study in Controversy\n\nThe basic facts of General Wilkinson's life are fairly straightforward: poor boy born inÂ 1757 on the East Coast, enlists in the rag-tag American revolutionary army and becomes a general at ageÂ 20. Finds Kentucky more to his liking, fights to get his new home a square deal, negotiating with Americans who controlled the influx of immigrants and with Spaniards who controlled the mouth of the Mississippi and thus the exports and economic life of the territory. Like Daniel Boone, a fellow Kentuckian originally from eastern Pennsylvania, he moves west again at the end of his life: Texas and more negotiating with Spaniards; dies inÂ 1825 in Mexico City, where he is buried.\n\nIt is, however, the interpretation put on this life that divided his contemporaries; and continues now to divide historians, even more fiercely if that were possible. Was he involved in the soâcalled Conway Cabal which sought to replace Washington by Gates as commander-inâchief during the Revolutionary War? Did he sell himself to the Spanish, and was he their agent in any modern sense? Did he conspire with Aaron Burr to carve out a fief for him in the western territories of the fledgling United States? Did he arrange to have Meriwether Lewis murdered?\n\nEveryone agrees that Wilkinson's genius lay in plotting and dissimulation; the question is whether the man was a traitor to that new American republic, which is by far the majority opinion, based on documents that have slowly seeped out of Spanish government archives. Details though are still very hard to come by as well as contradictory, and the cast of characters arrayed against Wilkinson are themselves an unsavory lot. My editionÂ (1975) of the Encyclopedia Britannica calls him a double agent: it's a tempting solution, and certainly gives the feel of his life and that of those with whom he dealt.\n\nThe most puzzling thing is that a man later called by a historian \"the most consummate artist of treason that the nation ever possessed\" should have retained the unwavering support of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, and should have held a series of prestigious posts in the government of the United States, with correspondingly heavy responsibilities, including that of Commander of the Army and Governor of the Louisiana Territory; and that, though tried in court several times, he was always completely cleared: this in the face of a very public, vociferous opposition with no shortage of people to accuse him of various crimes.\n\nThe primary sources on James Wilkinson extend to many thousands of documents of all kinds, the principal being much given to writing, and others to writing about him: aÂ correspondent has sent me a list running to 1,764 letters, reports, court transcripts, army orders, legislative material, contemporary news articles â and cheerfully reminds me that the inventory is no doubt woefully incomplete. The man has attracted, and such a mass of information requires, many experts devoting years of their lives to getting at a shadow of the truth. Some of these experts are represented onsite; for the reader then to judge, insofar possible:\n\nHere is a quartet of typical items:"
