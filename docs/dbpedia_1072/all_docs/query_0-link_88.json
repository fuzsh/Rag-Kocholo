        "text": "John Gardner Wilkinson was born in 1797, the son of John Wilkinson, a clergyman, of Hardendale in Westmorland, and Mary Anne Wilkinson (née Gardner). Through his mother he was related to the Crewe family of Calke Abbey in south Derbyshire; Georgiana Crewe (née Lovell, c.1824-1910), wife of the ninth baronet Sir John Harpur Crewe (1824-86), was his second cousin.\n\nWilkinson's mother and father had died by the time he was ten years old. He was entrusted to a guardian, and was educated at Harrow and at Exeter College, Oxford. His love of travel began with visits to the Continent in 1817 and 1818. In 1819 he set off on a 'Grand Tour' through France, Germany, and Italy, where he met the antiquarian and student of Egyptian hieroglyphics, Sir William Gell. Gell encouraged Wilkinson to engage in Egyptological study under his guidance; and in October 1821 Wilkinson left Italy for Alexandria.\n\nWilkinson remained in Egypt until 1833. He travelled extensively in that country, learnt Coptic and Arabic, continued his study of hieroglyphics, and surveyed and recorded the remains of ancient Egyptian society, notably the tombs at the site of Thebes. He began to publish his research, and continued to do so after his return to England. Manners and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians, his most extensive work, was first published by John Murray in two series in 1837 and 1841; a second edition appeared in 1847. This work enhanced Wilkinson's reputation as an Egyptologist, which resulted in his knighthood in 1839, and in membership of many learned societies.\n\nHe revisited Egypt four times: in 1841-2, 1843-4, 1848, and 1855-6. Partly because of these visits, as well as through undoubted inclination, he also travelled widely in Western Europe and the Mediterranean, and in the early 1840s toured Dalmatia and Montenegro, part of Asia Minor, the Levant and North Africa. (John Murray published Wilkinson's account of his travels in the Balkans as Dalmatia and Montenegro in 1848.)\n\nIn 1856 Wilkinson married Caroline Catherine Lucas (1822-81), a keen botanist and antiquarian, the companion of Augusta, Lady Llanover. The couple lived first at Tenby in Pembrokeshire, on the South Wales coast. In 1866 they moved to Brynfield House, at Reynoldston on the Gower peninsula. Brynfield and the surrounding area provided Wilkinson with ample opportunity to indulge his interest in ancient British remains; he had already published several articles on British archaeology and antiquities.\n\nWilkinson's Egyptological work contributed to the foundation of that discipline in Britain, but his research and publications ranged beyond Egypt into architecture, aesthetics, international relations and the classics, as well as travel and the study of ancient Britain. Moreover, in his detailed water-colours and drawings, as in his extensive notes and 'journals', he recorded his impressions of the architecture, costume and contemporary society of all the countries he visited.\n\nWilkinson was a man of such varied interests that his papers do not easily fall into archival arrangement, except for the sequence of sketchbooks. These are described first in the catalogue and form a discrete series of material. They are followed by five further, composite, series: Papers relating primarily to foreign travel and residence in Egypt; Papers relating to specific published and unpublished academic and literary projects; Papers relating to academic and antiquarian research in general; Personal papers; and Papers of others - of Lady Wilkinson, and of Wilkinson's cousins Sir John and Lady Georgiana Crewe and Matilda Lovell (Lady Crewe's sister).\n\nEach series is arranged chronologically, apart from general academic and antiquarian papers and papers of Lady Wilkinson and others, which fall into subseries, each arranged chronologically. Any references or file titles given to individual items by Wilkinson or Lady Wilkinson appear at the end of the description of the relevant item (before the current shelfmark), followed by the letter W in brackets, as Thompson's biography makes use of the Wilkinsons' references. Because of the miscellaneous nature of some of the papers, especially those which were bound for Wilkinson, occasionally material may not be in the series in which one might expect to find it. Readers should particularly note that drafts and originals for illustrations by Wilkinson, although mostly in papers relating to academic and literary projects, may also be found in foreign travel papers and general academic and antiquarian papers."
