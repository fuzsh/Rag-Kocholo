        "text": "The narrative of the Wilkinson family in England is based on the research of Arthur\n\nWilkinson of British Columbia, Canada. I have not seen the documentation yet that\n\nArthur has but relate his conclusions as they were related to me. Future research will\n\nhopefully confirm his findings. The story of our line of the larger Wilkinson family line\n\nbegins in the mid sixteenth century. A man named Lawrance Wilkinson held a\n\nsubstantial estate called Harperly Hall, located near Lanchester, County Durham,\n\nEngland . There is a location with that name still in existence at the location\n\ndescribed in historical documents. I have found an extensive property that contains\n\ntwo large houses and many farm buildings by using the Internet. Harperly Hall\n\nappears to be a 17th century manor house of considrable size. It is currently owned\n\nby a British government agency that overseas the training of police officers for the\n\nnorth of England. A second and seemingly much older dwelling, also quite large, sits\n\non the same grounds. This is called Low Harperley House. I have found a painting\n\ndone by an artist with the last name 'Wilkinson' of Harperley Hall manor house which\n\nI have included in the photo section. Lawrance had a son, William, who caused a\n\nservant girl, Mary Smythe, to become pregnant. Because this birth would be\n\nillegitimate and a marriage between William and Mary would be inappropriate in the\n\ndays standards of propriety, Mary was sent away to Litchfield, Derbyshire, England.\n\nShe gave birth to a son and named the child William Smythe Wilkinson, and recorded\n\nthe birth in 1550 in the Church of England parish at Litchfield. William Smythe\n\nWilkinson moved to London at an unknown later date and worked there as a \"Black\n\nSmythe (Smith).‚Äù He married and had a son who he named Smythe Wilkinson, after\n\nhis mother. Smythe Wilkinson was born in London around 1590. The spelling of this\n\nname varies, and appears in at least four different forms. The father and sons\n\ncontinued in the trade as metal workers. Back in the day metal working was called\n\nIronmongery and the workers were members of the Ironmongers Guild.\n\nThe Wilkinson Family in England\n\nHarperley Hall location Maps\n\nLow Harperley Hall\n\nSmythe Wilkinson was born in 1590 in London. He married and had a son who was\n\nnamed Stephen Wilkinson . Stephen Wilkinson #1 was christened at St. Midland\n\nchurch on 25 September, 1631. His wife was named Ann, and they had a son who\n\nwas also named Stephen. Stephen Wilkinson #2 was christened on 23 April,1661\n\nin London at St. Bride Cathedral, located on Fleet Street in the City. Steven's wife\n\nwas named Mary, and they had a son named Lewis Wilkinson, in 1686 and another\n\nson, Stephen Wilkinson in 1688. Arthur Wilkinson, who has done extensive research\n\ninto this phase of the Wilkinson family, reports that during the time in London the\n\nWilkinson clan applied for the 'right of birth' which was granted by the authorities\n\nalong with a distinctive coat of arms. This would imply that the family had attained a\n\nlevel of respectability such that it was recognized as a legitimate family. In English\n\nsociety of the time this would remove the stigma of the line from William Wilkinson\n\nand Mary Smythe being based on an illegitimate birth. The Coat of arms is\n\ndescribed in detail and I hope one day to track down an image of it or perhaps craft\n\na version myself. It does carry a slanted bar which denotes an illegitimate origin but\n\nthe granting of the 'right of birth' was an important step in the society of the day. A\n\nhappy ending perhaps to an unhappy beginning of our branch of the family.\n\nDescendants of Lawrance Wilkinson immigrated to the American colonies at an early\n\ndate and settled in Rhode Island. There is no record that they ever recognized the\n\ndescendants of William, son of Mary Smythe as part of the family. Among the many\n\nimportant Wilkinson's who descended from this line of the Wilkinson family was a\n\nnoteworthy early American religious leader, a woman named Jemima Wilkinson.\n\nAs she is not a direct ancestor I will not include documentation of her fascinating\n\nstory but it is worth doing an Internet search using her name.\n\nLondon (1570's - 1718)\n\nLondon 1700\n\nNew Milford, Connecticutt (1720 - 1791)\n\nLewis (Sr.) Wilkinson immigrated to the American colonies from London in 1718, at\n\nthe age of perhaps 32. In some of the information that has come to me he is\n\ndescribed as being a Lieutenant, although I do not have information as to what\n\nexactly this may have meant. He landed at Milford, Connecticut and settled there.\n\nOn 4 Dec 1721 he married a widow, Sarah Terrill, (born circa 1685, daughter of\n\nJohn E. and Abigail Terrill and widow of John Hubbard) in Milford. I know nothing\n\nabout this first husband of Sarah but his surname catches my attention. If you look in the chapter covering the ancestors of Angeline Hubbard you will notice that James\n\nHubbard is described as coming from the New England area before moving south to\n\nNew Amsterdam with Lady Moody. Could it be possible that Sarah's first husband,\n\nJohn Hubbard was a descendant of the same family line that produced James\n\nHubbard? At this early date in the history of the American colonies the populations\n\nwere very small and the chances are good this is so. I will certainly be researching\n\nthis possibility. The newly married Lewis and Sarah moved from Milford to New\n\nMilford, Connecticut in 1722 and started a family. Sarah Terrill's family was prominent\n\nin Milford. Our branch of the Terrill family has been traced back to a man named\n\nRoger Terrill, born in 1586 in Nazeing, Essex, England. Other branches of Sarah's\n\nfamily have been traced back to Thomas Ufford, born in 1560 also in Nazeing,\n\nEssex; Robert Bryan, born in 1530 in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire and Thomas\n\nBowling, born in 1539 also in Aylesbury; and Richard Hitchcock, born in 1556 in\n\nWiltshire County, England. A large group of related families, including many Terrills\n\nand Uffords, immigrated to the new world together in 1632 aboard a ship named the\n\n'Lyon'. They landed at Boston and then proceeded overland to Milford Connecticut\n\nwhere they were prominent in the settling of that area.\n\nNew Milford, CT on a map from 1766.\n\nPassenger ship \"Lyon\", model in City Hall\n\nat Braintree, MA..\n\nPfenninger Family added to the website\n\nA new section has been added that includes information about\n\nthePfenninger family that is descended from Henry Pfenninger\n\nand his wife Lena Schottlin. This section connects with the\n\nWilkinson Family history through the marriage of Alfred\n\nPfenninger (1888 -1964) and Hassel Mae Wilkinson (1894 -\n\n1981). Hassel Wilkinson was the youngest daughter of James\n\nWilkinson and Luella Adams Wilkinson.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________________"
