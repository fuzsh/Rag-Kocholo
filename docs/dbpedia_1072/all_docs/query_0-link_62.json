        "text": "I actually think it’s good that Bob at #3 found King’s piece to be “extremely rude.” In the last two decades or so, King has been bathed in precisely the kind of embalming fluid that he worked so hard to dispel from American politics. He sought, as he put it elsewhere in his Letter, to provoke and create tension: “There is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, so must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.” It’s good that people today still find him rude, that he makes people uncomfortable and creates tension in the air. That means he’s still doing his job. And now our job is to take that provocation and turn into the productive release that he sought.\n\nI was that white moderate. In 1965 as a 9th grader I remember being asked about the goals of the Civil Rights movement and saying that “they want too much too soon”. In my omnipotent naivete, I thought that incremental change would happen eventually but that it was not possible to get people to change quickly. In 1975, I thought the same thing about getting people to stop using male pronouns to refer to mixed-gender groups.\n\nI was wrong both times and I am very glad that I was. Had Dr. King not pushed for change now, I would never have had the opportunity to meet so many wonderful people with dark skins and had the Women’s Rights movement not been able to achieve such rapid success, I wouldn’t have the African-American woman heading up the division where I work and doing such an excellent job of removing obstacles that prevent us from doing our work well.\n\nThe implicit question framed by Corey’s post, it seems to me, is not ‘are moderates bad?’ (it seems to me inarguable that people who ‘wish to preserve their own small privileges with little regard to the deprivation of others’, to quote DrDick, there, are indeed bad people) but: have ‘moderates’ in this sense done more damage, tout court, than extremists?\n\nWe don’t want to think of ourselves as ‘extremists’, of course. We want to think of ourselves as ‘radicals’, ‘revolutionaries’ and so on. And let’s hope we are. But ‘moderate’ is the piece of rhetorical nomenclature in the box today, and moderate opposes extremist. The moderate says: ‘racially integrated buses are a fine idea, but not yet, one step at a time, etc etc.’ The extremist plants a bomb. (Or maybe the ‘terrorist’ plants a bomb, whilst the extremist supports him).\n\n(‘We’ in that second paragraph should be in inverted commas, of course.)\n\nThe Raven (10): I really don’t get this attitude. That 1789 is held up as an example of horror is in itself the other side of the embalming fluid quoted above (the trick being to separate the ostensibly moderate hero from the violent extremist in the story that we construct about political progress). It relies on ignoring the massive violence meted out by the absolutist state right until July 14, 1789 and starting the history of the revolution just then: oh my, how suddenly violent life has become now it’s the King’s head that rolls!\n\nPeople in 1788 lived as we live now under a system that constantly applies violence to perpetuate itself. The idea that this could be changed without being prepared to counter this violence seems naive to me (and no I am not arguing for quixotic armed insurrection, I’ll leave that one to the gun nuts).\n\nIn any event, the reference to revolution is not one to violence, but rather to the belief that fundamental change happens, when it happens, rapidly. We won’t reform our way to a just society.\n\nFrom the quote in the OP:\n\nwho prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice\n\nThis clause is esp. interesting to me b/c the negative peace vs positive peace distinction is standard in the ‘peace studies’ and conflict res. (etc.) literature. I’m guessing that MLK and the peace studies people both took it from some earlier source but I don’t know the provenance or pedigree [or substitute whatever other fancy synonym you want…] Or maybe ‘Letter from Birmingham Jail’ is its first appearance?\n\nAs to mpowell’s remark about King not being a philosopher, pol theorist etc.: It’s sort of beside the point b/c, as can be inferred from js’ remark about having taught King and Aquinas together, ‘Letter’ is now, or such is my impression, a canonical work taught in high schools and colleges — which I think is good, since you don’t want to limit the canon to works produced by professional philosophers. (‘Letter’ had not yet attained its present status when I was in h.s. and college.)\n\n/me raises eyebrows…\n\nNow wait just a minute here…\n\nFirst of all, all this “moderate” stuff is intended to be disarming. That’s usually the purpose of labeling something “moderate” or the “compromise position” or “Third Way”. King wasn’t really talking to a well intentioned polity. If he was, he wouldn’t have outlined his argumentation the way he did, like the discussion about “positive speech” and the presence of “justice”. His motives were to undress concern trolls of their “I’m not a racist, but…” dressing from over their sentiments, and make it more difficult to make their genuine feelings attractive and normative.\n\nIn any event, it has always amazed me, ever since I was old enough and educated enough to know, just how much white people care about race, and over the most trivial bullcrap. This has always amazed me, this creativity that some people have when trying to feel better about their noxious attitudes, like that Dred Scott dogwhistle. And it has always amazed me just how defensive white people can be when a minor racist sentiment is challenged. I don’t think I have ever been banned from any forum for a reason other than something related to white racial butthurt. And when I mean trivial, I mean stuff like correcting someone who fiddles with the stats to prove that Colt McCoy is, indeed!, better than Aaron Brooks.\n\nThere have always been poseurs within the groups of people who identify as “left”, who are largely “for me, but not for thee” every which way. Feminist who only look out for a certain segment of women. Nationalists who only think of the other guys just like them. Police unions who couldn’t give a crap about the janitors. Etc, etc, etc. Part of all movements is getting to people who want to pitch in, organize them, and exclude the time-wasters and the free-loaders. As MLK understood, radicalism means clarity, and it puts the burden of temporizing on the people that do it, not the people who listen to it. Why not now?\n\nMain Street Muse:\n\nThat’s the sort of interpretation I have a problem with. Ultimately, what MLK wanted was not extreme in the abstract. You know, equality and shit. Nobody who wanted to think about it, and who thought black people were people, could avoid the moral imperative in that positive peace. Not any more than anyone who didn’t already hate non-heterosexual people can really say that gay marriage could destroy their own.\n\n“Moderates” were not moderate, or sensible, or any other positive connotation. They were not in between “extremes”. This world ain’t the True Blood world, where there is a minority of people who need to suck blood and stuff, never age, and plenty of those who don’t consider humans their equals and act as so. Integrating vampires is a far more dicey proposition than allowing a person to sit anywhere she likes, free of targeted, lethal, terrorism. There was never any extreme (danger, finance, otherwise) to be moderated against, except that you had to recognize someone’s very humanity.\n\nNo it was not that “moderates” had to be galvanized. It’s that “moderates” had to be suppressed, and visible practices of non-violence was how it’s done (of course, everyone else who wishes to preserve a non-egalitarian society has taken notes, and such non-violent movements aren’t allowed easy access to media these days).\n\nAnderson @ 53\n\nMy original comment was at best tangential to the topic of this post, so I should probably not belabor the point I was trying to make. It’s enough to say that the Aaron Swartz prosecution amounted to an egregious misuse of the mechanism of the law to criminalize what was essentially a political act, and Orin Kerr’s defense of that prosecution was — as Rich Puchalsky implied — a bit of sophistry which very much depended on pulling rank on people who can’t claim to be legal scholars.\n\nPontius Pilate was allowed to wash his hands after a similar bit of sophistry, but we shouldn’t allow Orin Kerr the same privilege, not at least without a discussion of why in this, as in so many other cases, the law insists on being an ass. Lawyers have a right to claim that justice isn’t their business, or perhaps more accurately, that it isn’t exclusively their business, but if that’s their claim, then they have no business pretending otherwise, which in this case, Orin Kerr very definitely did.\n\nWha? What does preserving strawberry jam (in all its different varieties) and custard pie have to do with any of this? (Also:the original version, and the only one worth listening to.)\n\nMore seriously, (and to clarify my last comment a bit), King’s point is clearly that the so-called and self-conceived white moderates are squarely on the side of injustice—this is how they can be “the great stumbling block” in the fight for civil rights (so also, they don’t “swim with him”, or whatever).\n\nAt the same time, to say that the white moderates are the great stumbling block, on the side of injustice etc., is not to say that they are inevitably any or all of these things. (Which is why, while I agree with a lot of what shah8 says, and while my 57 was partly in support of his view, I disagree that King thinks the moderates need necessarily be “suppressed”—cf. #50.) The point of the designation is precisely to make evident to the self-conceived “moderates” (the kind who would “sympathetically” read what King wrote while gravely tsk tsk-ing his methods) the ways in which they support and abet injustice. But I take it that part of the point here is that making this evident can at the very least make them less of a stumbling block.\n\nâ€œThe Interrogation of the Goodâ€ by Bertold Brecht\n\nStep forward: we hear\n\nThat you are a good man.\n\nYou cannot be bought, but the lightning\n\nWhich strikes the house, also\n\nCannot be bought.\n\nYou hold to what you said.\n\nBut what did you say?\n\nYou are honest, you say your opinion.\n\nWhich opinion?\n\nYou are brave.\n\nAgainst whom?\n\nYou are wise.\n\nFor whom?\n\nYou do not consider your personal advantages.\n\nWhose advantages do you consider then?\n\nYou are a good friend.\n\nAre you also a good friend of the good people?\n\nHear us then: we know.\n\nYou are our enemy. This is why we shall\n\nNow put you in front of a wall. But in consideration\n\nof your merits and good qualities\n\nWe shall put you in front of a good wall and shoot you\n\nWith a good bullet from a good gun and bury you\n\nWith a good shovel in the good earth.\n\nThis thread is being embalmed all over again. How does “moderation” operate now? Part of it is what Duncan Black calls Very Serious People, of course, but that’s a media / policy cohort rather than an activist cohort.\n\nI know that there are going to be any number of people saying “how dare you compare Occupy to the Civil Rights Movement”, and yes, there were many important differences. But you can’t ever talk about Occupy — and couldn’t talk about it when it started — without moderates giving free advice about how people were doing it all wrong. Debates about tactics and organization were, of course, a big part of the Civil Rights Movement, and people regularly disagreed about what to do and how it should be done. But the people critiquing Occupy from outside it generally never felt the real need for any alternative at all. It was all “why are you so laughably disorganized?” and “because when we tried to be organized, it didn’t work, and nothing was happening” didn’t count as an answer.\n\nI don’t think the Occupy critiques (at least the best ones) are the same thing that MLK is talking about here, Rich. The “moderates” MLK is attacking see the solutions – have had them described in great detail – but think the solutions would rock various boats too much, so things have to be done “moderately” – i.e., more slowly. The best Occupy critiques boil down to either “you didn’t propose a solution” or “I don’t think what you’re proposing is a solution; it won’t work for reasons X, Y, and Z.” That’s very different from “your solution would work, but X, Y, and Z might be inconvenienced so lets do it another time.”\n\n(I’d also note that MLK always had not just lists of specific grievances, but lists of specific steps to be taken to remedy those grievances. Compare and contrast, again, to Occupy, where the grievances were sometimes well-articulated, often not, and the solutions were correspondingly vague at best and non-existent at worst.)\n\nLuis, if you want to characterize what the moderates MLK was attacking were saying, it might be good to look back at their statement (“Public Statement by Eight Alabama Clergymen”). There is no mention of solutions there, either in terms of agreement or disagreement, only an insistence on recommitment to negotiation. Similarly, MLK Jr. doesn’t focus on solutions in his reply. He writes that “In any nonviolent campaign there are four basic steps: collection of the facts to determine whether injustices exist; negotiation; self purification; and direct action.”\n\nI agree that the Civil Rights Movement always had a good idea of what its next goal was, what the next thing was that it should ask for. That’s one of the many reasons why it was so much more successful than Occupy. But there is a tendency to dismiss non-segregation problems that the movement started to address as never having existed in the first place — components about militarism, for instance. If those hadn’t been swept away by the official celebrations, the Civil Rights Movement might look a lot more unfocussed and wooly to people now.\n\nItâ€™s quite another, and a far worse thing, to dismiss him as â€œa master-theoretician/not a philosopherâ€, and hence presumably not worthy of the kind of close reading we honor properly â€œphilosophicalâ€ texts with.\n\nI think he’s worthy of close reading because he does an exceptional job of using the rhetoric of American political tradition to support his positions, but this is really not the same thing as being a good philosopher. MLK was perfectly willing to tell us the lies we liked to hear in a way that would advance his cause. If you read/listen to his work as a philosophy of political justice, it will not make much sense. If you read it as an educated and intelligent man advancing a political agenda, it will.\n\nThat’s why I think his argument that the moderates are the great stumbling block is not very convincing taken on its own, but that it was a perfectly reasonable rhetorical move at the time. It was an incitment to action not an actual logical argument.\n\nIn partial agreement with mpowell, people should note that MLK Jr. does the very typical moderate “I’m standing between two positions” bit in the letter. He’s not really addressing a binary between moderates and extremists intended to stand for all time, he’s criticizing particular attitudes.\n\n“At first I was rather disappointed that fellow clergymen would see my nonviolent efforts as those of an extremist. I began thinking about the fact that I stand in the middle of two opposing forces in the Negro community. One is a force of complacency, made up in part of Negroes who, as a result of long years of oppression, are so drained of self respect and a sense of “somebodiness” that they have adjusted to segregation; and in part of a few middle-class Negroes who, because of a degree of academic and economic security and because in some ways they profit by segregation, have become insensitive to the problems of the masses. The other force is one of bitterness and hatred, and it comes perilously close to advocating violence. It is expressed in the various black nationalist groups that are springing up across the nation, the largest and best known being Elijah Muhammad’s Muslim movement. “\n\ncleisthenes@49\n\nMark Twain was a wonderful writer but a dreadfully incompetent statistician. If you take literally his statement that “the one lasted mere months, the other had lasted a thousand years; the one inflicted death upon a thousand persons, the other upon a hundred millions” you would conclude that the pre-Revolutionary regime was killing people at the rate of a hundred thousand or more each year (if “mere months” is taken to be a year or more).\n\nThere is a problem there: the Ancien Regime deliberately killed people, certainly, but at far less than a thousandth of that rate.\n\nAnother problem: you could say that the Ancien Regime, though not deliberately and specifically drowning, shooting and beheading people at anything like the rate of the Revolution, let many die every year in misery, through “death from hunger, cold, insult, cruelty and heartbreak”. True enough: but did the Revolution do better? Look up “le maximum” and Gracchus Baboeuf.\n\nIf one were living under the Ancien Regime, and sure to live for a thousand years or more, then one’s probability of meeting an unjust death in that period might well be as high or higher than the equivalent probability in the Revolution. Trouble is that, from the point of view of an ordinary person with an ordinary lifespan just before the Revolution, chances of survival would be much better if the Revolution had never happened.\n\nNot to mention that the Revolution did not last, was succeeded by the mega-deaths of the Empire, and then the restoration of the original Bourbon monarchy.\n\nThere have been some revolutions that have not been, in the short to medium term, a step to the worse: not many. Examples?\n\nThe kind of moderate King wrote about doesn’t, today at least, say anything like “It’d be inconvenient for me if you push for that now.” They say things like:\n\n* Your pursuit of a narrow interest-group concern breaks our message of focus on some general one.\n\n* Your pursuit of your own self-interest that way threatens the viability of our coalition on some general matter.\n\n* Of course we care about your grievances but we don’t have time to formulate an appropriate strategy; please stop sabotaging our worthy efforts.\n\nSome of my friends in GLBT activism are feeling rather mean right now. It was always a given that the presidential and party line would be “When the time was right, we acted wisely, and now all is well.” But it’s sometimes infuriating to see the groups and people outside the party who told them to shut up, stop jeopardizing the ACA, and just generally to stop being so damn selfish now attributing the results of sustained protest to the target of the protests rather than to the instigators. Also, of course, now that they’ve got DADA repealed and some movement on marriage equality, they can please shut up about ENDA and other issues that will threaten the vital second-term campaigns.\n\nIt was an incitment to action not an actual logical argument.\n\nSurely you don’t mean that a call to action can’t consist in a chain of reasoning where a set of premises lead to a conclusion? In any case, I don’t at all see why such a thing couldn’t exist, and in fact I think “Letter” very much qualifies as a call to action that consists in a quite cogent chain of reasoning, etc. (On the other hand, you presumably also don’t mean that if “Letter” were submitted for publication at J. Phil., it would be rejected. Of course it would, but what exactly does that show? So, e.g., would the Crito I imagine.)\n\nIt’s true that King draws on “rhetoric of the American political tradition” to make his case. It’s also true, as I pointed out above, that King draws on Augustine and Aquinas and a rich tradition of natural law theory to make his case. In fact he draws on a lot of things. What he constructs though is precisely a very powerful argument.\n\nRich points out (78) that King is targeting “particular attitudes”, presumably particular attitudes that were prevalent in the context in which King was writing. This is very true. But it’s just another false dichotomy to suggest that King wasn’t thereby also identifying and critiquing a quite general tendency among those who style themselves “moderates” (across at least a significant range of contexts). If you doubt that this is a false dichotomy , I suggest that you check out some of Plato’s early dialogues (the Crito once again is perfectly serviceable, though the Apology might be even better).\n\nLook, I’m not particularly hung up on the “philosopher” label (though speaking as someone who is in a philosophy dept., “rhetorician” does sound dismissive to me). What does very much matter I think is that King is making a quite insightful argument about people who self-conceive as “moderates”—an argument that quite obviously generalizes (see Hidden Heart’s 84 for a perfectly good contemporary application). But unless you approach the text as worthy of serious analytic treatment, you’re of course going to miss the argument (as lots of people on this thread obviously do).\n\nStephen@81\n\nThe use of the Twain quote was to highlight the fact that the popular view of the Jacobin Terror is that it was premeditated and unique in its blood thirst, its depravity and its violence. It wasnâ€™t. Twain makes it clear that the lot of the average French person was bleak and dismal for a millennium, but if direct violence is the measure you want to use then the Bourbon monarchy had more than its fair share, far more than the Jacobins can ever be accused of- the pointless slaughter of the seven years war and the Atlantic slave trade are just two 18th Century examples. Robespierre and the Convention of course abolished French slavery during the terror (5th February 1794).\n\nBut the real question is why did the terror emerge? Itâ€™s a popular theory that all Revolutions â€œcarry within them the seeds of their own destructionâ€ but of course this is crude determinism, ironically a charge leveled against left wing History held by those who believe Revolution to be doomed to deterministic destruction. Revolutions are dynamic, chaotic by their nature and at the mercy of human agency and events. The French Revolution and the subsequent terror is one such example of this in action.\n\nThe reign of terror stemmed from the destabilization and threat to France caused by the declaration of war in the Assembly by the opportunist Brissotin faction on 20th April 1792. The most vehement opponent of war was one Maximilien Robespierre who famously declared, â€œArmed missionaries are loved by nobodyâ€. War was supported secretly by the counter revolutionaries and Louis XVI who saw it as an opportunity to bring the revolution to its knees and towards absolute restoration.\n\nThe reign of terror was not some uniform, thought out, premeditated plan of bloodthirsty action but one that was planned according to circumstances and events. This is why some areas of France never felt the impact of the terror at all. The maximum was an attempt to stop war profiteering and to try to ensure the supply of food to French citizens and Gracchus Babeuf was executed by the reactionary Directory, instituted after the fall of Robespierre.\n\nYes there were disgusting excesses, notably Fouche in Lyons who was recalled to Paris by Robespierre as a result (and would go on to be chief reactionary against Robespierre during Thermidor and faithful servant of Napoleon). The maximum was chaotic in its implementation and had dubious results and yes towards the end Robespierre descended into paranoia, exhaustion and excess. However the radical phase of the Jacobin period introduced policies and reforms we now take for granted- universal suffrage, abolition of slavery etc and saved France from coalition occupation and the re-installation of absolute monarchy in 1793-1794. This was humanityâ€™s advance. Unfortunately there has never been a radical political advance in human progress that has not included violence as an integral part.\n\nThe reactionary revolt of Thermidor ensured the White Terror (surpassing the Jacobin Terror for violence), the stripping of suffrage; bourgeois rights as against citizenâ€™s rights and the way clear for the Bonapartist regime.\n\nThe French Revolution is a tumultuous event in human history and cannot be categorised as ‘one event and one failure’. There are at least three distinct periods- 1789-92, 1793-94 and Thermidor until Brumaire (1799) and the periods differ fundamentally in terms of what was gained and lost. The Revolution’s lessons are myriad and its effects are still felt today. It should never be dismissed as a wasted, doomed, premeditated, violent attempt to change humanity- all tumbrils and guillotines. Unfortunately for the most part it is.\n\nI’m playing with the idea that the qualitative difference between “radicals” and “moderates” is that the former but not the latter are willing to engage in negative-sum games. The radical sees a difference between right and wrong, and is willing to pursue right even at the cost of self-destruction; the moderate knows half a loaf is better than none. The radical says let justice be done, though the skies fall; the moderate weighs costs and benefits.\n\nI think the advantage of this definition is that it describes a difference of kind and not degree, and it’s not pejorative toward either side; when you think of it this way you see that any politics will have radical and moderate moments. And it corresponds, roughly at least, I think, to King’s ideas. Tolerating “tension”means accepting that you may have to commit to a posture that is irrationally costly, taken in isolation, if you want your opponents to back down.\n\nMao Cheng Ji@82\n\n“The fact that the king and his minions can and will get their heads chopped off if they go too far, it creates an important constraint.”\n\nVery true. Also true for the President or the First Secretary of the Communist Party. But only a very partial truth.\n\nJoseph de Maistre – not I think a writer much admired on CT, but one sometimes worth considering – put it more generally. Abuses in government may eventually produce popular revolutions, and that is a very important lesson for governments. But the abuses of revolutions are usually worse than the abuses of the previous governments, and that is a very important lesson for peoples.\n\nYou see, the French Revolution was not just a matter of beheading king, queen and some nobles. Most of its victims were ordinary decent people, and the outcome was no improvement. As someone, I forget who, said: enthusiasm for revolution in settled societies is too often playing with fire, by children who don’t even know that fire is hot.\n\nCleisthenes, grandson of a tyrant but reformer of the constitution, @88:\n\nI’m sure we agree that the popular view of the Jacobins and the Terror is erroneous. I doubt if either of us would limit that to the view of the Jacobins, or the Terror. And I am at least as well aware as you of the different phases of the Revolution. Where we would differ, I think, is in the weight we would give to to what you would regard as the excesses of the Terror and I would regard as an integral part of it. Granted that it was not what anyone originally intended, it was still far worse than anything that had happened in France for many years, even worse than St Bartholomew’s Day: Fouche in Lyons was not the worst, consider the Vendee, the September Massacres, the fate of the Princesse de Lamballe, or the final settling of scores between the leaders of the Revolution which make Al Capone look moderate and merciful.\n\nI agree Robespierre spoke against the revolutionary declaration of war against France’s neighbours. He also, before he had a chance to exterminate his real or imaginary enemies, wrote passionately against the death penalty. And once he and his friends were in power, I don’t remember that they (notably Saint-Just) were against the war. I really am not sure to what to make of him myself, but the phrase “two-faced conniving bastard of a weasel” does come to mind.\n\nAs for the improvements of the Revolution: universal suffrage was introduced on the condition that anyone standing or voting for the wrong parties would have a very short life expectancy, wars as futile as the Seven Year’s War were replaced by much longer but equally or more futile ones, slavery was indeed abolished (to be restored later), the absolute monarchy was abolished to be replaced by the absolute Empire …\n\nThis has wandered a long way from the original thread. To try to return: no, I don’t think moderates are the worst enemies, and I fear that in a genuinely revolutionary situation many real moderates will end with their heads tumbling into the basket. To be followed or accompanied, of course, by the heads of many revolutionaries."
