        "text": "Â p82Â James Wilkinson's\n\nFirst Descent to NewÂ Orleans inÂ 1787\n\nThe object of this note and the accompanying documents is to explain how James Wilkinson succeeded in descending the Mississippi River past the Spanish posts and in arriving at NewÂ Orleans in July,Â 1787, unmolested by Spanish officials. It is a well known fact that inÂ 1784 the Spanish government issued a proclamation closing the Mississippi River to all foreigners pending the adjustment by treaty of outstanding disputes with the United States.​1 For several years (i.e., untilÂ 1789) this proclamation was enforced and the property of American citizens attempting to navigate the river below its junction with the Ohio was confiscated by the Spanish government.​2 How did Wilkinson succeed where others had failed? Even had he come as a mere sightseer, a tourist, he would have been liable to arrest, as the Spanish dominions were closed to travelers as well as to merchants; but Wilkinson was not a mere tourist, for he brought with him a flatboat loaded with \"flour, butter, bacon and tobacco\".​3 Nor can his success be attributed to any invitation or overtures from Spain, for, as Professor W.Â R.Â Shepherd has pointed out,​4 the Spanish intrigue in Kentucky was begun on the initiative of Wilkinson, not of Spain, and was begun after he had completed the journey now under discussion and had arrived unmolested at NewÂ Orleans.\n\nÂ p83Â Previous writers on this subject have generally taken for granted Wilkinson's safe descent of the Mississippi, and have confined their attention to his reception by Governor MirÃ³ and Intendant Navarro at NewÂ Orleans. Professor Shepherd, in his notable article on Wilkinson, gathers together some of the explanations offered in this connection by Wilkinson and his contemporaries and by subsequent writers, and then advances his own.​5 Among Wilkinson's contemporaries we may mention Daniel Clark, who claimed that his uncle, a NewÂ Orleans merchant, persuaded MirÃ³ not to confiscate Wilkinson's property, since the latter's influence in Kentucky would make him a dangerous enemy to Spanish Louisiana. Wilkinson, however, denied this, and furthermore averred that he arrived in NewÂ Orleans in July,Â 1787, a \"perfect stranger\".​6 MirÃ³ and Navarro explained to the court, in the letter transmitting Wilkinson's memorial (September,Â 1787) that it was Wilkinson who had destroyed George Rogers Clark's expedition against Natchez in the spring of that year.​7 Their statement might be understood to imply that they were acquainted with the fact before Wilkinson's arrival in NewÂ Orleans and it has apparently been so accepted by Professor Shepherd, as it seems to be the only authority for his assertion that Wilkinson's military and political reputation preceded him to NewÂ Orleans and that in consequence MirÃ³ forbore to seize his boats and cargo until the precise object of his visit could be ascertained.\n\nNow it is a curious fact that, on the one hand, there is no indication that MirÃ³ and Navarro ever had the slightest intention of seizing his boats and cargo, nor yet, on the other hand, is there any evidence that before his arrival in NewÂ Orleans they knew of the existence of such a person as James Wilkinson. Â p84Â The letter which is apparently Professor Shepherd's authority was written by MirÃ³ and Navarro in September,Â 1787, and, with regard to their acquaintance with Wilkinson, states nothing more than that they were aware at the time of writing the letter (i.e., three and one half months after the date of his arrival in NewÂ Orleans) that Wilkinson was a person of consequence in Kentucky.​8 They do not state when or how they acquired this information, and nothing in the letter warrants the assertion that Wilkinson's fame was known to them before his arrival in NewÂ Orleans. Moreover, we have evidence of a negative character that Wilkinson was either unknown or lightly esteemed at NewÂ Orleans as late as JuneÂ 1, 1787, for, while, at a later time, MirÃ³ frequently declared that Wilkinson's first service to Spain was his opposition to the projected attack on Louisiana by Clark and Green in the spring ofÂ 1787, yet in a comprehensive despatch describing the failure of that project and dated JuneÂ 1, 1787, MirÃ³ did not even mention Wilkinson.​9 There is no evidence that the governor heard of him in the course of the month that intervened between the writing of this letter and Wilkinson's arrival in NewÂ Orleans.\n\nThere have recently appeared two other works containing accounts of Wilkinson's reception at NewÂ Orleans. These accounts are mutually contradictory, and yet neither writer seems aware that there might be any other version of the affair than his own. In one of these books, Mr.Â Temple Bodley​10 tells us that Wilkinson prepared the way for his arrival by instructing a confidential agent in NewÂ Orleans\n\nThe other recent account, written by Professor SamuelÂ F. Bemis,​11 runs as follows:\n\nHis [Wilkinson's] ready wit somehow got him by the Spanish posts. He actually floated down to NewÂ Orleans before his cargo was seized and himself arrested and brought before the Spanish Governor. .Â .Â . It is certain that he [Wilkinson] was no whit daunted by his detention.\n\nMr.Â Bodley implies that Wilkinson was not arrested, Professor Bemis asserts that he was, and neither of them tells us how he reached NewÂ Orleans. Clearly the whole episode needs more careful study.\n\nFortunately, documents exist which enable us to follow with some degree of assurance the course of Wilkinson's relations with the Spanish officials on the Mississippi up to the time of his safe arrival in NewÂ Orleans. From these documents and from other sources is drawn the following brief account of Wilkinson's preparatory measures and his descent to NewÂ Orleans inÂ 1787.\n\nSome time late inÂ 1786, Wilkinson attempted, with the aid of no less a person than John Marshall, to secure a passport from Governor Randolph of Virginia,​12 and from the circumstances that will shortly appear it is highly probable that he intended to use the passport for a journey down the Mississippi to NewÂ Orleans. About the same time, he also attempted through Baron vonÂ Steuben to obtain a passport from Gardoqui for the same purpose.​13 As a further preparation, he Â p86Â wrote the first of the letters appended below. This letter, dated DecemberÂ 20, 1786, was addressed to the commandant of the Spanish post at St.Â Louis, Francisco Cruzat. The subject of the letter was George Rogers Clark's recent seizure of the property of Spanish subjects at Vincennes, which Wilkinson deplored on behalf of all the law-abiding people of Kentucky. His letter was accompanied by one in English from Richard Anderson to the commandant (the text of this letter also is given below), and both were delivered at St.Â Louis by a Captain Carberry.\n\nWilkinson's next communication to the commandant of St.Â Louis was dated MayÂ 15, 1787. By this time he had doubtless received John Marshall's letter informing him that Governor Randolph was of the opinion that he had no authority to issue a passport for use outside of Virginia,​14 and by this time it was also apparent that there was no hope of getting a passport from Gardoqui. At St.Â Louis Wilkinson's efforts had met with more success, and Carberry had returned with the cheering news of the favorable reception given him by the commandant of that post. Wilkinson had then completed his preparations and had begun his journey down the Ohio. Arrived at its junction with the Mississippi, he went into camp, wrote Francisco Cruzat, commandant of St.Â Louis, the letter of MayÂ 15 mentioned above, again despatched Captain Carberry as his messenger, and awaited an answer.\n\nIn this letter​15 he referred to his \"former address\" to Cruzat (i.e.,Â the letter of DecemberÂ 20, 1786), thanked him for his civilities to Captain Carberry on his previous mission to St.Â Louis, stated that he was on his way to Philadelphia via NewÂ Orleans, and asked for a passport for himself, his servant, and baggage. Informing Cruzat of the failure of Green's projected attack on Louisiana, mentioned in his previous letter, Wilkinson concluded with the postscript: \"You will Â p87Â pardon this scral, wrote under the assaults of Legions of Musquitoes.\"\n\nJust what action Cruzat took on receiving Wilkinson's request cannot be stated with certainty. Search has failed to discover any letter from Cruzat either to MirÃ³ or to the commandant at Natchez, Carlos deÂ Grand-PrÃ©, referring to this affair, but there can be little doubt that he did write such a letter or letters. In the first place, the presence in the Spanish archives of Wilkinson's letters to Cruzat proves beyond a reasonable doubt that Cruzat forwarded them to MirÃ³ with a covering letter, and the Spanish government's neglect of its Louisiana records until very recent times will explain the absence of this covering letter from its proper place in the colonial archives. Cruzat's hypothetical despatch was probably written about JuneÂ 1, 1787, in order to transmit Wilkinson's letter to him of MayÂ 15, and also, we may suppose, enclosed the earlier letter (that of DecemberÂ 20, 1786), which would not seem to require transmission on its own account, but would be necessary to explain the letter of MayÂ 15. Cruzat's despatch probably did not reach MirÃ³ before the arrival of the expeditious Wilkinson at NewÂ Orleans (JulyÂ 2), but at the same time or later.\n\nIn the second place, it seems highly probable that Cruzat wrote about Wilkinson to Grand-PrÃ© as well as to MirÃ³. Whether the letter was official or personal, and whether or not he gave Wilkinson the desired passport, it is impossible to say. Grand-PrÃ©'s letter to MirÃ³ (see below) reporting Wilkinson's arrival at Natchez contains no reference to any kind of communication from Cruzat, and yet some sort of introduction Wilkinson must have had. We know that Captain Carberry carried his letter of MayÂ 15 to Cruzat, and that the object of this letter was to obtain a passport for the voyage down the Mississippi. We also know that \"aÂ captain\", probably Carberry, accompanied Wilkinson on his arrival at Natchez. It seems highly probable, therefore, that Carberry delivered Wilkinson's letter to Cruzat and returned to his Â p88Â employer with a reply satisfactory enough to induce Wilkinson to continue on his way down the Mississippi. This assumption is strengthened by Grand-PrÃ©'s treatment of Wilkinson. Instead of forcing the American to return to Kentucky, as the law required, or of holding him a virtual prisoner at Natchez while consulting MirÃ³, as was done in extraordinary cases, the Spanish commandant entertained Wilkinson in Fort Panmure, showed him every courtesy, permitted him to continue immediately on his way to NewÂ Orleans, and recommended him warmly to the governor. Even the engaging personality of the American adventurer or the flattering promises that he knew so well how to hold out will hardly explain Grand-PrÃ©'s assumption of such a responsibility. Everything indicates that he had knowledge of unusual circumstances entitling Wilkinson to special consideration. It is highly improbable that he owed this knowledge to MirÃ³, for he wrote as if Wilkinson were (as he probably was) an utter stranger to the governor. It seems probable, therefore, that Cruzat complied with Wilkinson's request to the extent of giving him a personal letter to Grand-PrÃ© in order to facilitate his descent to NewÂ Orleans.\n\nHowever this may be, Wilkinson left his camp at the mouth of the Ohio and continued on his way down the river. On JuneÂ 16, 1787, he arrived at Natchez, accompanied by \"aÂ captain\" (probably Carberry), a slave and a servant, and followed by a barge. As we have seen, Grand-PrÃ© entertained him in Fort Panmure and wrote MirÃ³ an official letter (JuneÂ 18, 1787) recommending him highly. Grand-PrÃ©'s letter apparently left Natchez with Wilkinson and arrived in NewÂ Orleans at the same time that Wilkinson did, namely, on JulyÂ 2.​16 This letter alone was enough to save Wilkinson from immediate arrest and makes it unlikely that the intervention of Daniel Clark's uncle was required, for when once the Kentuckian obtained a hearing his own glib tongue could be relied Â p89Â on to do the rest. Finally, Grand-PrÃ©'s letter is the only evidence, so far as the present writer is aware, that Wilkinson's fame preceded him to NewÂ Orleans, as Professor Shepherd says. It would therefore be more accurate to say that his fame accompanied him to NewÂ Orleans.\n\nThat Wilkinson was not arrested on his arrival at NewÂ Orleans is further indicated by his own report of the affair to Gardoqui in a letter dated JanuaryÂ 1, 1789.​17 In this letter Wilkinson declared that inÂ 1787 he had run the risk of prosecution by entering Louisiana without a passport or permission, determined, if he failed in that quarter, to negotiate with the British; but that he was most warmly welcomed by the governor and intendant. We are justified in inferring from this letter that Wilkinson was not arrested, for, since he sent a copy of it to MirÃ³, the facts stated in it must have been accurate so far as they could have been known to the governor, and a faithful statement of the facts would have required a reference to the arrest if Wilkinson had been arrested. Furthermore, we have two letters written from NewÂ Orleans at the time of Wilkinson's visit there, one by Villars, the French commissaire in Louisiana,​18 the other by Enrique White, sargento mayor of the fixed regiment of Louisiana,​19 and although both of these letters mention Wilkinson's presence in the city, neither of them contains any allusion to an arrest. Since neither MirÃ³, Navarro, Wilkinson, White, nor Villars mentions an arrest, it is highly improbable that Wilkinson was arrested on his arrival at NewÂ Orleans.\n\nIn conclusion, this note and the accompanying documents show that George Rogers Clark's act of violence at Vincennes was the starting point of James Wilkinson's intrigue with Spain; they corroborate (if corroboration were needed) Professor Shepherd's statement that Wilkinson, not the Spaniards, Â p90Â took the initiative in the Kentucky intrigue; and they give the first authentic information as to the circumstances of his first voyage down the Mississippi and of his arrival at NewÂ Orleans. Some of the details of his descent are conjectural, but there seems to be little doubt that for once in his life Wilkinson told the truth when he said in his Memoirs that he arrived in NewÂ Orleans in July,Â 1787, a \"perfect stranger\". He remained a stranger only until MirÃ³ had opened his mail received on the same day and had read Grand-PrÃ©'s despatch of JuneÂ 18. This letter assured Wilkinson a favorable welcome and a hearing for his schemes, and crowned with success the plan that he had been maturing at least as far back as the fall ofÂ 1786.\n\nIt may be added by way of postscript that George Rogers Clark was well aware that his enemies in Kentucky had capitalized the Vincennes episode in order to open commercial relations with Louisiana. InÂ 1788 Clark, like so many other Americans, offered Gardoqui his services for the establishment of a colony in Spanish territory. Defending his conduct at Vincennes two years earlier, he protested that his enemies in Kentucky had misrepresented the affair, and continued:\n\nThe real motive of my accusers [in Kentucky] was that, wishing to trade with NewÂ Orleans, they thought that by pretending to take the side of the Spanish vassals, they might hope to be favored in their projected commerce.​20\n\nHe could hardly have stated the case more accurately even if he had seen Wilkinson's letter of DecemberÂ 20, 1786, to the Spanish commandant of St.Â Louis.\n\nThe documents and translations follow:​a\n\nÂ p91Â Document No.Â 1​21\n\nJames Wilkinson to His Excellency the Governor of St.Â Louis, District of Kentucky, DecemberÂ 20, 1786.\n\n[Translation]\n\nÂ p94Â Document No.Â 2​22\n\nRichardÂ C.
