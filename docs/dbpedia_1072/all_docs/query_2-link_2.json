It was carved by the artist Arthur Wilkinson (1882-1957) who was inspired to make puppets in 1914 by some toy Italian puppets. He started as a professional puppeteer by touring England in a caravan with his brother Walter and performing with puppets he carved.Walter Wilkinson went on to concentrate on the revival of glove puppetry in Britain, while Arthur Wilkinson continued with marionettes.\n\nBy the 1920s Arthur Wilkinson was so concerned that puppetry had become neglected in England that he began The Marionette Society to produce marionette theatre throughout the country. He launched the society with a performances at the Poetry Bookshop in London in November 1923, using his own figures including Harlequin, Columbine, the dragon and Pantaloon. By 1928 he had carved the remarkable set of marionettes, illustrated on a flyer for his show and including Pagliacci and Pimpinella, and Harlequin and Columbine. After Arthur Wilkinson married Lily Gair they became known as the 'Gair Wilkinson Marionettes' and he later assumed the name Gair Wilkinson professionally.\n\nThe original costume of this marionette was oversewn with gold lurex fabric, probably in the 1950s, to make a replacement dress. The parts of the replacement dress were removed and preserved, but made a weightier type of dress not in keeping with lightness and delicacy of the original dress and appearance of the marionette."
