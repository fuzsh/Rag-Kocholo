        "text": "Vital Statistics records for deaths registered in Newfoundland and Labrador from 1950 to 1968 are now available online via The Rooms website.\n\nIn 2021, Digital Government and Service NL’s Vital Statistics Division provided an initial transfer of 59,698 death certificates, to allow public access for research purposes. This is the first time a collection of vital statistics records has been digitally transferred to The Rooms Provincial Archives. The records can be found on a searchable database here Vital Statistics (Deaths 1950-1968) digital collection.\n\nAll original materials and digital copies are still maintained by the department. Marriage, birth and additional death records will be added to the Archives in the near future.\n\nThe database can be keyword searched by: name; date of death; sex; marital status; place of death; or date of registration of death. Attached to each individual record is a digital reproduction of the individual’s registration of death.\n\nThe Rooms Provincial Archives holds many useful genealogical research sources, in paper and microfilm format, including: Vital Statistics (pre-1892), Vital Statistics (1891-1949) collections, parish records, census records, the All Newfoundland Births, Family History Collection (MG 929), Gert Crosbie collection, Mildred Howard collection and select newspapers.\n\nQuotes\n\n“Enabling public access to historic documents online is an important public service that we are proud to facilitate. Thanks to the work of The Rooms, Vital Statistics and the Office of the Chief Information Officer, we are allowing people to research and easily find answers to questions about their history and ancestors.”\n\nHonourable Sarah Stoodley\n\nMinister of Digital Government and Service NL\n\n“Digitalizing these Vital Statistics records is bringing our history into the present in a modern, accessible way. In doing so, The Rooms is further cementing its own place as the province’s largest cultural facility – not only for the appreciation and exploration of art, heritage and culture, but for archival research, as well. I expect this new development to entice more Newfoundlanders and Labradorians to explore their ancestries and family trees.”\n\nHonourable Steve Crocker\n\nMinister of Tourism, Culture, Arts and Recreation\n\n“Digital transfer of vital statistics records is an exciting milestone for The Rooms. These records are essential for genealogical research, and making them publically available is one of our core archival services. I am delighted that the public can conveniently access these records online, and I am grateful to staff at The Rooms, Vital Statistics and the Office of the Chief Information Officer for their involvement in this project.”\n\nAnne Chafe, CEO\n\nThe Rooms Corporation of Newfoundland and Labrador\n\n– 30 –\n\nLearn more\n\nFollow us on Twitter @GovNL and @DGS_GovNL @TCAR_GovNL and @TheRooms_NL\n\nLike us on Facebook\n\nMedia contacts\n\nKrista Dalton\n\nService NL\n\n729-4748, 685-6492\n\nkristadalton@gov.nl.ca\n\nAdrienne Luther\n\nTourism, Culture, Arts and Recreation\n\n709-729-4819\n\nadrienneluther@gov.nl.ca"
