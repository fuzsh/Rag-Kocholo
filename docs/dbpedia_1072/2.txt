The narrative of the Wilkinson family in England is based on the research of Arthur

Wilkinson of British Columbia, Canada. I have not seen the documentation yet that

Arthur has but relate his conclusions as they were related to me. Future research will

hopefully confirm his findings. The story of our line of the larger Wilkinson family line

begins in the mid sixteenth century. A man named Lawrance Wilkinson held a

substantial estate called Harperly Hall, located near Lanchester, County Durham,

England . There is a location with that name still in existence at the location

described in historical documents. I have found an extensive property that contains

two large houses and many farm buildings by using the Internet. Harperly Hall

appears to be a 17th century manor house of considrable size. It is currently owned

by a British government agency that overseas the training of police officers for the

north of England. A second and seemingly much older dwelling, also quite large, sits

on the same grounds. This is called Low Harperley House. I have found a painting

done by an artist with the last name 'Wilkinson' of Harperley Hall manor house which

I have included in the photo section. Lawrance had a son, William, who caused a

servant girl, Mary Smythe, to become pregnant. Because this birth would be

illegitimate and a marriage between William and Mary would be inappropriate in the

days standards of propriety, Mary was sent away to Litchfield, Derbyshire, England.

She gave birth to a son and named the child William Smythe Wilkinson, and recorded

the birth in 1550 in the Church of England parish at Litchfield. William Smythe

Wilkinson moved to London at an unknown later date and worked there as a "Black

Smythe (Smith).‚Äù He married and had a son who he named Smythe Wilkinson, after

his mother. Smythe Wilkinson was born in London around 1590. The spelling of this

name varies, and appears in at least four different forms. The father and sons

continued in the trade as metal workers. Back in the day metal working was called

Ironmongery and the workers were members of the Ironmongers Guild.

Smythe Wilkinson was born in 1590 in London. He married and had a son who was

named Stephen Wilkinson . Stephen Wilkinson #1 was christened at St. Midland

church on 25 September, 1631. His wife was named Ann, and they had a son who

was also named Stephen. Stephen Wilkinson #2 was christened on 23 April,1661

in London at St. Bride Cathedral, located on Fleet Street in the City. Steven's wife

was named Mary, and they had a son named Lewis Wilkinson, in 1686 and another

son, Stephen Wilkinson in 1688. Arthur Wilkinson, who has done extensive research

into this phase of the Wilkinson family, reports that during the time in London the

Wilkinson clan applied for the 'right of birth' which was granted by the authorities

along with a distinctive coat of arms. This would imply that the family had attained a

level of respectability such that it was recognized as a legitimate family. In English

society of the time this would remove the stigma of the line from William Wilkinson

and Mary Smythe being based on an illegitimate birth. The Coat of arms is

described in detail and I hope one day to track down an image of it or perhaps craft

a version myself. It does carry a slanted bar which denotes an illegitimate origin but

the granting of the 'right of birth' was an important step in the society of the day. A

happy ending perhaps to an unhappy beginning of our branch of the family.

Descendants of Lawrance Wilkinson immigrated to the American colonies at an early

date and settled in Rhode Island. There is no record that they ever recognized the

descendants of William, son of Mary Smythe as part of the family. Among the many

important Wilkinson's who descended from this line of the Wilkinson family was a

noteworthy early American religious leader, a woman named Jemima Wilkinson.

As she is not a direct ancestor I will not include documentation of her fascinating

story but it is worth doing an Internet search using her name.

Lewis (Sr.) Wilkinson immigrated to the American colonies from London in 1718, at

the age of perhaps 32. In some of the information that has come to me he is

described as being a Lieutenant, although I do not have information as to what

exactly this may have meant. He landed at Milford, Connecticut and settled there.

On 4 Dec 1721 he married a widow, Sarah Terrill, (born circa 1685, daughter of

John E. and Abigail Terrill and widow of John Hubbard) in Milford. I know nothing

about this first husband of Sarah but his surname catches my attention. If you look in the chapter covering the ancestors of Angeline Hubbard you will notice that James

Hubbard is described as coming from the New England area before moving south to

New Amsterdam with Lady Moody. Could it be possible that Sarah's first husband,

John Hubbard was a descendant of the same family line that produced James

Hubbard? At this early date in the history of the American colonies the populations

were very small and the chances are good this is so. I will certainly be researching

this possibility. The newly married Lewis and Sarah moved from Milford to New

Milford, Connecticut in 1722 and started a family. Sarah Terrill's family was prominent

in Milford. Our branch of the Terrill family has been traced back to a man named

Roger Terrill, born in 1586 in Nazeing, Essex, England. Other branches of Sarah's

family have been traced back to Thomas Ufford, born in 1560 also in Nazeing,

Essex; Robert Bryan, born in 1530 in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire and Thomas

Bowling, born in 1539 also in Aylesbury; and Richard Hitchcock, born in 1556 in

Wiltshire County, England. A large group of related families, including many Terrills

and Uffords, immigrated to the new world together in 1632 aboard a ship named the

'Lyon'. They landed at Boston and then proceeded overland to Milford Connecticut

where they were prominent in the settling of that area.

Pfenninger Family added to the website

A new section has been added that includes information about

thePfenninger family that is descended from Henry Pfenninger

and his wife Lena Schottlin. This section connects with the

Wilkinson Family history through the marriage of Alfred

Pfenninger (1888 -1964) and Hassel Mae Wilkinson (1894 -

1981). Hassel Wilkinson was the youngest daughter of James

Wilkinson and Luella Adams Wilkinson.
