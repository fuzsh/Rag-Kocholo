Inscribers relationship to WC Not applicable Context of subject matter to WC WSC was a key person in the D-Day Landing in Normandy during Jun 1944. The author, although not landing on D-Day did arrive shortly after, only to lose his life in late July. WSC would have found this gift poignant and a reminder to that period of the war, where so many laid down their lives to eventually defeat the Germans Events at time of book gifted WSC was MP for Woodford, but for three years he was to serve as the Leader of the Opposition and during these years he continued to influence world affairs.
