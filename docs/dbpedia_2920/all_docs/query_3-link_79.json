Distribution of entangled photons between the ground and the satellite can be used to certify the quantum nature of the link: a guarantee that no eavesdropping can take place. By placing the entangled photon source on the ground, the space segments contains “only” the less complex detection system, enabling its implementation in a compact enclosure, compatible with the 12U CubeSat standard ( ${\\sim}12~\\mbox{dm}^{3}$ ). This reduces the overall cost of the project, making it an ideal choice as a pathfinder for future European quantum communication satellite missions. The space segment is also more versatile than one that contains the source since it is compatible with a multiple of QKD protocols (not restricted to entangled photon schemes) and can be used in quantum physics experiments, such as the investigation of entanglement decoherence. Other possible experiments include atmospheric transmission/turbulence characterization, dark area mapping, fine pointing and tracking, and accurate clock synchronization; all crucial for future global scale quantum communication efforts.",

        "text": "The NanoBob mission will miniaturize the Bob receiver payload for it to fit inside a 12U CubeSat frame. This size limit is chosen as the smallest CubeSat standard that allows for a reasonably large main telescope of 150-mm diameter (potentially up to 180-mm diameter), increasing the light collection efficiency by a factor of four (6 dB) compared to the alternatives of 3U or 6U, and providing sufficient space to incorporate the on-board beacon laser with a secondary, smaller telescope. Figure 3 gives a schematic representation of the assembly, while Table 1 gives the estimated size, weight (or rather mass), and power consumption (SWaP) of the subsystems together with their uncertainties. The definition of the Technology Readiness Levels is according to ISO standard 16290:2013 as adopted by ESA [27].\n\nThe SWaP analysis of Table 1 shows that the estimated maximum volume including contingency is 12 L, the maximum mass is 9 kg, and the peak power consumption can reach 34 W. Both volume and mass are well within the limits of 19.9 L and 24 kg imposed by the 12U CubeSat standard [10]. Table 1 also enables estimation of the energy consumption per orbit. The most critical orbital scenario is, not surprisingly, the scientific scenario of a QKD experiment. For a worst case estimation we assume that the initial alignment phase takes 5 minutes, the quantum experiment lasts 5 min, the beacon lasers will be operated during this entire period (10 min) and the S-band communication with the ground station lasts 10 min. We then calculate an energy consumption of 9.2 Wh during one full orbit. This is to be compared with the recharging capacity of the batteries of 21.6 Wh (beginning of life) provided by the solar panels during the same orbit. It also means that the installed battery capacity of 66 Wh will see a cycling of less than 15% of its nominal, initial capacity. The efficiency of the solar panels is expected to decrease less than 10% over 3 years [28]. We thus expect that the batteries can easily sustain the \\({\\sim}16\\text{,}400\\) cycles during the longest expected operational lifetime of the satellite of 3 years (which is more likely limited by radiation damage to the single photon detectors).\n\nIn the following sections we describe the subsystems that have been identified as most critical to the mission outlined above. All other subsystems (such as power systems and OBC) can be purchased commercially off-the-shelf and be used with minimal modification. They also generally have space heritage.\n\n4.1 Light collection optics\n\nThe optical module (see Fig. 4) is literally (at) the center of the payload. It consists of a telescope with high light gathering power followed by the quantum channel polarization analyzer and a separate unit dedicated to detecting the ground-to-satellite beacon laser. It is complimented with a small diameter telescope that focuses the satellite beacon laser, as well as two corner cubes that retro-reflect the OGS beacon laser.\n\nThe light collection optics should maximize the number of photons captured from the photon stream directed towards the satellite by the OGS. Ideally, the OGS produces a diffraction limited beam diameter of a little over 1 meter at the location of the satellite for the 808 nm quantum channel; in practice increased to several meters due to atmospheric turbulence. Increasing the receptor aperture will directly result in higher signal. Losses internal to the quantum channel light collection optics and the polarization analysis module should also be minimized. The receiver telescope must preserve the polarization direction of the incoming photons, such that it contributes not more than 0.25% to the total polarization error (see Sect. 4.2). This signifies that the receiver telescope is polarization neutral to the extent that the spread in polarization of beams taking different paths through the telescope will be less than 1∘. Starting point for the optical design is a Cassegrain telescope with an opening aperture of 150 mm diameter and an overall length of just 125 mm. A refractive solution was not considered. Although the weight of a lens system could be reduced using a Fresnel lens, strong accelerations along the optical axis expected during launch are a serious concern, as is radiation damage of the optics.\n\nThe FOV of the quantum channel’s detectors (100-μm diameter) should in practice be as small as possible while respecting the constraint of the dynamic pointing stability of the pointing and tracking system (see Sect. 4.5). This in order to reduce unwanted background light from being captured by the receiver telescope. Considering this, the quantum channel FOV is \\(215~\\mu\\mbox{rad}\\) (45 arcsec), corresponding to a circular footprint of 120 m diameter with the satellite at an orbital height of 550 km. Knowledge of the photon intensity or spectral radiance of the area of the OGS then enables one to calculate the expected background count rate. The Vienna group made measurements at the Canary Islands with a spectral band pass filter of 10 nm centered at 810 nm, resulting in a photon flux of 1010 to \\(2.5\\cdot10^{11}~\\mbox{s}^{-1}\\mbox{sr}^{-1}\\mbox{m}^{-2}\\) depending on the moon phase [29]. Even at a distance of 1100 km between OGS and satellite, near the beginning and end of their encounter, the background count rate is then still smaller than 400 cps (counts per second), given a 15-cm receiver telescope diameter and taking an atmospheric attenuation of \\({\\sim}3~\\mbox{dB}\\) into account; acceptable for a Bell test with uplink losses \\({<}50~\\mbox{dB}\\) (cf. the calculated Visibility of Fig. 9). We note that the actual background can be further reduced using bandpass filters with a narrower transmission profile; 3 nm appearing a reasonable choice for which center wavelength transmission of \\({>}90\\%\\) is still possible and outside bandpass blocking is better than OD6 (60 dB).\n\nIn order to compact the whole instrument while conserving a small ratio of the diameters of the secondary and primary mirrors (i.e., a better transmission), a relatively high field curvature has been chosen. Considering the on-axis aberrations, we take benefit of the Cassegrain design, which enables totally suppressing the spherical aberration (SA3) by choosing the conic constant (also known as the Schwarzschild constant) of the hyperbolic secondary mirror. Aberrations are in general not critical given the small FOV and the non-imaging character of the application. In particular, the aberrations appearing within the FOV (coma, FOV curvature, distortion) can be neglected. The design was analyzed in ray tracing software to show that a 100-μm diameter photodetector behind the telescope can capture more than 80% of the incoming light intensity.\n\nThe FOV of the beacon detection is 9 mrad (see Sect. 3). The compact telescope allows for the entire optics module to be shorter than 200 mm.\n\n4.2 Polarization analysis\n\nThe polarization detection unit analyzes the incoming photons in either one of two bases (see Fig. 4). An easy and secure way to make the random choice of selecting either one of the two bases is by the use of a 50/50 beam splitter (BS) [30]. As pointed out by Gisin et al. [7], the quantum mechanical nature of the underlying physical process guarantees its randomness, but experimental artifacts, notably detector dead-time, afterpulsing, and detector flashes [31] could potentially lead to correlated adjacent bits at high photon rates [32–34]. Following the BS a half-wave plate (HWP) oriented at 22.5∘ in one of the two paths is used to rotate the polarization direction by 45∘. Polarizing beam splitters (PBS) in both paths enable the polarization analysis. The polarizer extinction ratio and the orientation/mounting precision of the PBS are such that the probability of a photon ending up in the wrong path (e.g., a vertically polarized photon being detected by the “horizontal detector” instead of the “vertical detector”) is not larger than 1%, as such a detection error (\\(e_{\\mathrm{d}}\\)) increases the coincidence error and therewith reduces the signal-to-noise ratio and visibility (Sect. 7). Importantly, this error includes the possible misalignment of the OGS and satellite polarization bases.\n\nAll quantum communication protocols based on polarization encoding of the qubits require a shared reference frame between the transmitter (Alice) and receiver (Bob). Atmospheric turbulence, scattering, and the Faraday effect can potentially rotate the plane of polarization. It is, however, easily shown that these effects are negligible (\\({<}1~\\mbox{mrad}\\)) compared to geometrical effects due to the moving satellite and the moving mirrors of the transmitter telescope. The latter effect was studied by Bonato et al. [35] and should be compensated by appropriate rotation of the polarization bases of the OGS or satellite. If these bases would be misaligned by 4∘, this would contribute 0.48% to the detection error. Two options are available: The first is to rotate the OGS polarization basis (e.g., by the motorized rotation of a half-wave plate (HWP) in the quantum light channel) to adapt to the satellite orientation. The latter is known to the OGS from the pre-programmed flight plan and the information received at regular intervals (\\({\\sim}100~\\mbox{ms}\\)) from the satellite’s star tracker measurements. Fine-tuning will take place using a signal obtained from the analysis of the linear polarization of the satellite’s beacon laser as received by the OGS [36]. A second option entails rotation of the satellite about its seeing axis using an error signal derived from analysis of the separately controlled linear polarization of the OGS beacon laser, again combined with data from the star tracker. Both solutions avoid addition of moving parts (the rotatable HWP) to the satellite. We fully implement the first solution, but equip the satellite with the hardware required for the second option. In case of failure of the first option, for example due to a satellite beacon laser failure, the satellite can be re-programmed to implement the second solution. Even though the dynamic tracking precision of the ADCS is generally significantly worse about its star tracker bore axis (which is parallel to the receiver telescope seeing axis), it is however more than sufficient to allow precise pre-orientation of the satellite about its seeing axis (see Sect. 4.5). The OGS laser beacon signal is then used to improve absolute accuracy and to further improve alignment precision to the 10-μrad level. Ground-based experiments will verify that the OGS laser beacon polarization correctly tracks the orientation of the OGS polarization bases.\n\nThe coincidence count rate shows a cos2-dependence when varying the measurement basis between HV and DA. The visibility of this polarization correlation decreases, not only due to the above mentioned polarization detection error, but also due to source imperfections, polarization imbalance in the quantum link, and detector dark and background counts (see Sect. 7).\n\n4.3 Single photon detectors\n\nBased on the link-budget and key rate analyses presented in Sects. 6 and 7 we require the single photon detectors (SPDs) to have a photon detection efficiency (PDE) \\({>}40\\%\\), dark count rate (DCR) per detector \\({<}1000~\\mbox{cps}\\), timing jitter \\({<}100~\\mbox{ps}\\), afterpulsing \\({<}3\\%\\), and a maximum count rate \\({>}100~\\mbox{kHz}\\) without saturation effects. Afterpulsing will contribute to the dark- or background count rate, and may also lead to a correlation between bits. The light collection optics have been designed for a detector diameter of \\(100~\\mu\\mbox{m}\\), but could be modified to accept \\(50~\\mu\\mbox{m}\\) diameter detectors.\n\nThe wavelength of operation is not a primary specification. Two wavelength ranges appear potentially attractive for free-space QKD: the near-infrared region near 800 nm, and the telecom, short wave infrared (SWIR) range around 1550 nm. The link budget slightly favors the longer wavelength (see Sect. 6). Since key distribution and the sending of encrypted messages are in principle independent aspects of cryptography, there is no fundamental reason to operate the QKD channel on the same wavelength as that used for a fiber-based network used to transmit the encrypted message. That said, there remains an obvious interest in mutualizing optical building blocks between the free-space and fiber-based systems, which drives the exploration of the feasibility of QKD at 1550 nm. However, currently, neither of the available detector technologies in the 1550 nm region is attractive for use in a CubeSat: Both Indium–Gallium–Arsenide (IGA) Avalanche Photo Diodes (APDs) and detectors based on Mercury–Cadmium–Telluride (MCT) technology require cooling to very low temperatures (\\({<}{-}80^{\\circ}\\mbox{C}\\)). In addition, IGA APDs have a rather low photon detection efficiency (PDE) \\({<}25\\%\\), whereas MCT SPDs are still in development and appear to be hampered by large DCR [37, 38]. At the current state of technology, only Silicon-based APDs in the 800-nm range are able to combine a sufficiently high PDE and low jitter with a low DCR. Si-APDs have been operated and characterized in space or under space radiation conditions. This has clearly shown the need for special measures to keep the dark count rate below acceptable levels, also after longer times in a space environment [39–41]. To our knowledge, no similar space heritage exists for IGA, let alone MCT SPDs.\n\nThe Si-APD that was identified for use in the NanoBob quantum channel is manufactured by Micro-Photon Devices. In particular, the Red-Enhanced version of this detector shows an improved sensitivity towards 800 nm (\\(\\mathrm{PDE} = 40\\%\\)) and is also very attractive as it combines a low reverse voltage (50 V) with low jitter (90 ps) and dark count rate [42]. Additionally, the specified low dark count rate of 25 cps was demonstrated at a temperature of \\(-5^{\\circ}\\mbox{C}\\), much higher than the \\(-30^{\\circ}\\mbox{C}\\) targeted in our system. We expect to receive prototypes of these detectors shortly for radiation testing in Grenoble.\n\nWe note that the DCR requirement has obvious implications for the detector operating temperature. However, the stability of the detector temperature is not very critical for the QKD experiment, but may limit the precision and accuracy that can be attained if the space segment is to be used in light pollution mapping mode (see Sect. 1). High doses of radiation in space may cause the DCR to increase over time. For this reason the detectors are shielded by housing them in an aluminum module with walls of minimally 10-mm thickness, as well as by other satellite components around it (batteries, electronics, the aluminum CubeSat structure, and solar panels). Using the OMERE software package [43] we calculated the cumulative total radiation dose received by the detectors as a function of the thickness of the aluminum shielding provided by the mounting structure. The satellite was assumed to be in an SSO at 550 km with a launch date in September 2020. The results for a 1-year and a 3-year exposure are shown in Fig. 5. The total incident radiation dose includes contributions from electrons trapped in Earth’s magnetic field, solar and trapped protons, and Gamma photons (in order of decreasing radiation level). Kodet et al. [44] determined that gamma radiation has no detrimental effect on Si-APD performance, and in any case in our mission scenario the gamma radiation dose accounts for just 1‰ of the total. Anisimova and colleagues tested several different Si-APDs shielded by 10 mm of aluminum under similar radiation exposures and found the DCR of the small area detectors to increase to several hundred cps [41]. Packing the detector unit in a hydrogen-rich material such a polyethylene may further reduce the total radiation dose. This will be part of the radiation testing of the above-mentioned prototype detectors.\n\nIt has been shown that annealing of Si-APD detectors at elevated temperature (60 to 100∘C) for several tens of minutes can already lower the dark count rate significantly (up to about an order of magnitude decrease) [39, 41, 44]. For this reason, it may actually be advantageous to let the detectors heat up during the daytime part of the orbit.\n\nIn fact, the detectors will be cooled passively during the nighttime part of the orbit using a radiator facing deep space. Small local heaters will regulate the individual detector temperatures to \\(-30\\pm 1^{\\circ}\\mbox{C}\\). We thus do not use thermo electric cooling (TEC) of the detectors, also not for final stage cooling or as a temperature fine-tuning solution. This comes with some notable advantages: TEC units are notoriously inefficient with a low coefficient of performance. More problematic appears the risk of total or partial failure of the TEC or its power supply, in which case the TEC unit would act as a thermal insulator between the detector chip and the mounting structure. The TEC unit would also introduce a mechanically less rigid element that may affect detector positioning. Relying solely on passive cooling and low-power resistive heating thus increases the reliability of the detector thermal management system.\n\nTo study the passive cooling of the detector module in some detail we modeled the spacecraft as a square cuboid of size \\(22 \\times 22 \\times 34~\\mbox{cm}^{3}\\). Its panels are covered with a multi-layer insulation (MLI) characterized by an IR emissivity of 0.71 and a UV absorptivity of 0.52, whereas the radiator is coated white with an IR emissivity of 0.81 and UV absorptivity of 0.25. The average spacecraft temperature in a 550 km SSO is taken to be 10∘C. The detector unit is modeled as an aluminum block connected to the radiator with a thermally conductive strand with a total resistance of 3.2 K/W. Each of the four detectors and its proximity electronic circuitry consumes 0.3 W. The incoming direct solar UV/VIS radiation, the reflected radiation from Earth’s surface, and Earth’s emitted IR radiation during a typical QKD orbital scenario with nighttime OGS encounter was calculated using Airbus’ Thermica software [45]. Taking further into account the different radiative and conductive heat fluxes between the satellite structure, the radiator, and the detector unit, the model developed allows us to calculate the minimum radiator surface area needed to maintain the detector module temperature below \\(-30^{\\circ}\\mbox{C}\\). Depending on whether the radiator is placed on the square end-panel facing deep space (the panel that also accommodates the star tracker) or on one of the space facing side panels, the calculated required surface area varies between 0.052 and 0.055 m2. In practice the radiator area will be distributed over the end-face and one or two side panels. Maximizing the radiator area to the available 0.19 m2 may enable cooling of the detectors to a lower temperature still. This is clearly favorable in light of the recent findings that show that deep cooling drastically reduces and even mitigates the effects of radiation [41].\n\n4.4 Time tagging\n\nThe events detected by the Bob quantum receiver can be due to detector dark counts, background (stray) light, or the entangled photons sent by the OGS. Identification of the entangled photons is done by comparing their time of arrival at the NanoBob quantum receiver with the arrival times of the other photon of the entangled pair at the Alice detection unit at the OGS. Such identification through coincidence timing requires a high timing precision if large numbers of photons are involved. With a source single photon generation rate of 100 Mcps, a timing resolution (coincidence time window) better than about 1 ns is required in order to reduce the probability of accidental coincidence to an acceptable minimum. A better timing resolution will thus increase the signal-to-noise ratio (see Sect. 7) by suppressing the number of background or dark counts being accidentally registered as an entangled photon event.\n\nIn order to time stamp the photon arrival a time-tagging module is used, both at the OGS [46] and on the CubeSat. An integrated space-qualified system will be specifically designed using a dedicated integrated circuit implementing time-to-digital conversion (TDC). A short-term stability of the TDC oscillator of 0.1 ppb (10−10) is required, corresponding to a measurement precision of about 10 ps for an average time between photon arrivals that could be as long as roughly 100 ms (10 cps). This can be achieved using an oven controlled crystal oscillator (see, e.g., [47]) or miniature atomic clock (such as, e.g., the model Quantum SA45.s by MicroSemi [48]). Long-term clock synchronization between OGS and satellite is then achieved by the fore-mentioned time correlation technique applied repeatedly on data over intervals of approximately 100 ms [26, 46]. Implementing TDC with a time resolution \\({<}25~\\mbox{ps}\\) and jitter \\({<}10~\\mbox{ps}\\) in integrated circuitry is challenging but can be done in standard field programmable gated arrays (FPGAs) using a method based on self-timed rings (STR) [49]. Alternatively, Vernier-TDC will be employed if the compact STR-based approach turns out to be too difficult to implement in an FPGA.\n\nThe combined contribution to the coincidence time window of the detector and electronics jitter on the space segment, and those of a state-of-the-art OGS [46], is about 100 ps.\n\n4.5 Position, acquisition and tracking\n\nA first concern for the PAT of the satellite is whether the precision of its ADCS is sufficient, also under dynamical conditions. For a circular orbit at an altitude of 550 km the slewing rate required to keep the line of sight of the satellite along the line segment from OGS to satellite is reaches a maximum value of \\({\\sim}12.6~\\mbox{mrad/s} = 0.72^{\\circ}\\mbox{/s}\\) at closet approach (0∘ zenith angle). The slewing rate required of the OGS telescope to track the satellite reaches a maximum value of \\(13.7~\\mbox{mrad/s} = 0.79^{\\circ}\\mbox{/s}\\). These values are compatible with OGS telescopes designed to track LEO satellites, such as the ESA OGS “Observatorio del Teide” at Tenerife, situated at an altitude of 2.393 m, and also less stringent than the capabilities of the best commercial CubeSat ADCSs.\n\nThe current demonstrated state-of-the-art in terms of attitude determination and control appears to be held by the XACT family of ADCS manufactured by Blue Canyon Technologies [50]. Their XACT-15 module was integrated in the MinXSS 3U CubeSat [51], launched December 6, 2015 and the RAVAN 3U CubeSat [52], launched November 11, 2016. On MinXSS it has demonstrated to exceed its specifications of a pointing accuracy \\({<}50~\\mu\\mbox{rad}\\) (11 arcsec) and a pointing knowledge \\({<}30~\\mu\\mbox{rad}\\) (6 arcsec) (both 1-sigma) for the two cross-star tracker-bore sight axes. The pointing accuracy about the bore axis is specified to be \\({<}120~\\mu\\mbox{rad}\\) (25 arcsec). Furthermore, the dynamic tracking error (1-sigma) of the XACT unit as a function of the slewing rate for the two cross axes is largely unaffected for slewing rates \\({<}1.1^{\\circ}\\mbox{/s}\\). Even the dynamic tracking error about the bore sight axis does not exceed \\(480~\\mu\\mbox{rad}\\) (100 arcsec), which is still well within our requirements. For the Blue Canyon XACT-50, which is identical to the XACT-15, except for its larger 50 mNms reaction wheels, to guarantee a slewing rate of at least 1∘/s in any axis, the moment of inertia in the slewing axes needs to be below \\(2.8~\\mbox{kgm}^{2}\\) [53]. The predicted moments of inertia of the NanoBob satellite are about one-twentieth of this value.\n\nAt a satellite altitude of 550 km it takes the beacon laser photons at least 1.83 ms to arrive at the satellite. During this time the angular displacement of the satellite, as seen from the OGS telescope position, could be as much as \\(25~\\mu\\mbox{rad}\\). This is non-negligible with respect to the telescope quantum channel beam diameter and will have to be taken into account in its tracking control by having the telescope point slightly ahead of the satellite position. This has no major consequence for the reception of the satellite’s beacon signal considering the relatively large FOV of the beacon receiver (the unvignetted FOV of the Coudé system of the ESA OGS equals 2.4 mrad).\n\n4.6 Beacon lasers\n\nKnowledge of the attitude (orientation) of the satellite is typically limited to about \\(50~\\mu\\mbox{rad}\\) by star tracker performance. While this is almost an order of magnitude smaller than the satellite’s quantum channel FOV, this may not be sufficient for accurate pointing due to ephemeris uncertainty that limits the ability to accurately transfer the attitude knowledge in the inertial frame to the Earth-fixed frame. On the other hand, the OGS requires accurate knowledge of the satellite position in the Earth-fixed frame in order to accurately track the satellite. For the same reason as before, data from the star tracker may not be precise enough. The positioning error of a Commercial-Of-The-Shelf (COTS) GPS receiver can be as large as 10 m [54], even though sub-meter precision has been shown on a LEO spacecraft [55]. This, however, could already put the satellite out of sight of the OGS quantum channel, considering that even in the presence of atmospheric turbulence a 1-m diameter telescope would illuminate a disk with a diameter of just a few meters at the altitude of the satellite.\n\nTo provide an additional, and more accurate way to align both the OGS telescope and satellite receiver we will implement a two-way beacon (guide star) system, allowing for relatively fast closed-loop control of the satellite attitude, as well as satellite tracking by the OGS telescope. The beacon receiver module on the space segment includes a quadrant detector (or alternatively or CCD camera) to enable attitude control about the two axes perpendicular to the line of sight, and a linear polarization analyzer made up of a polarizing beamsplitter and two IGA photodetectors.\n\nThe initial choice of wavelength for the beacon lasers is in the NIR C-band around 1550 nm as here efficient lasers and detectors are easily available and the atmospheric transmission is high. Moreover, the wavelength is retina-safe, and directly compatible with existing telecommunication hardware and infrastructure. It is also advantageous that optical communication in space has been demonstrated previously in this wavelength range [56]. We therefore aim to use the beacon lasers not only for PAT, but also for fast optical communication by implementing a pulse position modulation scheme [57]. Optical communication provides an attractive alternative to RF communication by virtue of its lower power demand and high data rate.\n\nThe use of a beacon laser and optical communication using a laser beam between a ground station and a LEO CubeSat have been separately investigated by other groups [58–60]. We will implement a very similar design as those explored by the groups mentioned here, and DLR in particular [58]. It should be noted that the uplink experiences a higher link loss (by about 10 dB) due to atmospheric turbulence, but that this could be compensated by the use of a higher power laser. The downlink experiences lower losses and the OGS can be equipped with a large diameter receiver (or use the Coudé focus of the main telescope) as well as cooled high-sensitivity detectors, together allowing for the use of a relatively low power laser source and small transmitter telescope on the space segment. Finally, we note the encouraging result reported in [61] that the large difference in quantum channel and beacon laser wavelength does not preclude using the beacon laser at 1550 nm to correct the turbulence-induced beam wander at the quantum channel wavelength of 808 nm (employing, e.g., a fast steering mirror on the OGS or its adaptive optics system [62]).\n\nWe have performed a study of the expected key rate using a model developed by Ma, Fong, and Lo for QKD with an entangled photon source based on spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) [67]. The model provides an expression for the coincidence detection probability given a source photon (referred to as a “pulse” in the original paper):\n\n$$ Q(\\mu)=1-\\frac{1-Y_{0A}}{(1+\\eta_{A}\\frac{\\mu}{2})^{2}}-\\frac{1-Y_{0B}}{(1+\\eta_{B}\\frac{\\mu}{2})^{2}}+ \\frac{(1-Y_{0A})(1-Y_{0B})}{(1+\\eta_{A}\\frac{\\mu}{2}+\\eta_{B}\\frac{\\mu}{2}+\\eta_{A}\\eta_{B}\\frac{\\mu}{2})^{2}}. $$\n\n(7)\n\nHere μ is the average number of photon pairs produced for one source photon (\\(\\mu < 1\\)), \\(\\eta_{X}\\) is the detection efficiency of channel X (=A for Alice, or B for Bob), and \\(Y _{0X}\\) is the probability of a dark- or background count in channel X within the coincidence time τ (s). For a system with \\(N_{\\mathrm{det}}\\) detectors, a dark count rate of \\(D _{X}\\) (\\(X=A,B\\)), and a background (e.g., due to stray light, poor filtering of beacon light, or other light pollution sources within the FOV of the receiver telescope) count rate of B (s−1) in Bob’s channel, we can write:\n\n$$ \\begin{aligned} &Y_{0A}=N_{\\mathrm{det}}D_{A} \\tau, \\\\ &Y_{0B}=(N_{\\mathrm{det}}D_{B}+B)\\tau. \\end{aligned} $$\n\n(8)\n\nAs in the following we will vary the value of the dark count rate \\(D _{B}\\), we note here that for the purpose of the simulation, an increase of the dark count rate \\(D _{B}\\) by and amount ΔD is equivalent to changing the background count rate B by \\(N _{\\mathrm{det}} \\cdot \\Delta D\\) (\\(= 4 \\Delta D\\)). The coincidence rate then equals Q times the source photon (singles) production rate (equal to the inverse of the coincidence time window, since the pair production probability is already included in Q):\n\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{coinc}}=\\biggl(\\frac{1}{\\tau}\\biggr)Q(\\mu). $$\n\n(9)\n\nWe note that the coincidence rate is inversely proportional to the link attenuation until the visibility decreases and the Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) increases. This is because dark- and background counts at the NanoBob receiver could accidentally coincide with photon detection at the sender side (Alice, at the OGS), increasing the QBER, and adding to the number of detected coincidences. The rate at which this occurs can be estimated as \\(N_{\\mathrm{acc}} = N_{\\mathrm{t}} \\times N_{\\mathrm{r}} \\times \\tau = ( \\eta_{A} R) \\times ( \\eta _{B} R / A ) \\times \\tau\\). Here \\(N_{\\mathrm{t}}\\) is the rate of events detected at the sender side, \\(N_{\\mathrm{r}}\\) the rate of events detected at the receiver side, R the rate of pair production, and A the link attenuation. For example, with a pair production rate of \\(R = 10^{8}~\\mbox{s}^{-1}\\), coincidence time window \\(\\tau = 10^{-9}~\\mbox{s}\\), and detection efficiency of \\(\\eta = 0.32\\), this gives \\(N_{\\mathrm{acc}} \\approx 10~\\mbox{cps}\\) at a link attenuation of 50 dB, assuming that the sum of dark- and background count rates \\({\\ll}N_{\\mathrm{r}} = 320~\\mbox{cps}\\). But if the sum of dark and background count rates (\\(4D _{B}+B\\)) is high, say 5000 cps, \\(N_{\\mathrm{acc}} \\approx 50~\\mbox{cps}\\) (on a total coincidence rate of 63 cps at a link attenuation of 50 dB).\n\nThe secret key rate is lower than the coincidence rate since the sequence of coincidences (the “raw key”) still contains wrong bits that need to be removed using some kind of error correction. Also, in order to decrease the amount of information that Eve may have been able to obtain, Alice and Bob engage in a process known as privacy amplification that further reduces the number of bits available for the construction of a secret key (see, e.g. [7, 8]). Ma et al. provide a lower limit of the secret key generation (“distillation”) efficiency due to post-processing [67]:\n\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{dist}}(\\mathrm{QBER})\\geq q\\bigl(1-f( \\mathrm{QBER})H_{2}(\\mathrm{QBER})-H_{2}(\\mathrm{QBER})\\bigr), $$\n\n(10)\n\nwhere q represents the basis reconciliation factor, in our protocol equal to 0.5, \\(f(x)\\) is the bidirectional error correction efficiency, and \\(H _{2}(x)\\) is the binary entropy function: \\(H _{2}(x):= -x \\log_{2}(x) - (1-x) \\log_{2}(1-x)\\). In the Shannon limit, \\(f(\\mathrm{QBER}) = 1\\) and the secret key generation fraction reaches zero for \\(\\mathrm{QBER} \\rightarrow 11.0\\%\\) [7, 67, 68]. Here, again conservatively, we follow [67] in taking \\(f(\\mathrm{QBER}) = 1.22\\), in which case the function reaches zero for \\(\\mathrm{QBER} = 9.4\\%\\) and secret key distillation is no longer possible. However, the secret key rate is only a factor of 5 lower than the coincidence rate if the \\(\\mbox{QBER} \\approx 5\\%\\). Only if the QBER exceeds 8%, does the secret key rate drop quickly towards zero.\n\nThe QBER could be measured directly in the QKD experiment, but can also be calculated as follows [67]:\n\n$$ \\mathrm{QBER}=e_{0}-\\frac{1}{Q(\\mu)} \\frac{(e_{0}-e_{\\mathrm{d}})\\eta_{A}\\eta_{B}\\mu (1+\\frac{\\mu}{2})}{ (1+\\frac{\\eta_{A}\\mu}{2})(1+\\frac{\\eta_{B}\\mu}{2})(1+\\frac{\\eta_{A}\\mu}{2}+\\frac{\\eta_{B}\\mu}{2}+\\frac{\\eta_{A}\\eta_{B}\\mu}{2})}. $$\n\n(11)\n\nWe start our analysis by considering the conservative scenario given by the parameters of Table 3. Notably, we consider that the source produces 108 pairs per second, and that the coincidence time window is limited to 1 ns. This can easily be met by currently existing sources and detection systems that can be integrated on the OGS. We further assume a background count rate of 400 cps. Figure 8 then shows that with a dark count rate of 100 cps per detector, the experiment can tolerate a total link loss up to about 47 dB, and that this limit is reduced to about 40 dB if the dark count rate reaches 1000 cps. The same figure also shows the behavior of the signal-to-noise ratio, defined as \\(\\mathrm{SNR} = (N_{\\mathrm{max}}- N_{\\mathrm{min}})/N_{\\mathrm{min}}\\), with \\(N_{\\mathrm{min}}\\) (\\(N_{\\mathrm{max}}\\)) the coincidence count rate measured at the minimum (maximum) of the polarization correlation curve. The SNR may be calculated directly from knowledge of the QBER: \\(\\mathrm{SNR} = (1/\\mathrm{QBER})-1\\).\n\nThe QBER increases and the visibility of the polarization correlation curve (see Sect. 4.2) decreases with link attenuation, as well as with increasing dark count rate or background count rate. The visibility may be obtained directly from knowledge of the QBER:\n\n$$ V=\\frac{1-\\mathrm{QBER}}{1+\\mathrm{QBER}}. $$\n\n(12)\n\nThe visibility is a valid estimator of the QBER for the E91 protocol, but not BB84. Using entangled photons, a Bell-test provides a measure of the quantum nature of the link. In order to be able to violate the Bell inequality, the overall visibility V should be larger than \\(1/\\sqrt{2} = 0.71\\), since the observed Bell parameter (\\(= V \\cdot S_{\\mathrm{max}}\\)) should be larger than 2, whereas its quantum mechanical limit \\(S_{\\mathrm{max}} = 2\\sqrt{2}\\). Thus, the SNR should be larger than \\(2/(\\sqrt{2} -1) = 4.83\\). As seen above, this condition is always satisfied in the case of a successful QKD experiment.\n\nThe visibility for the conditions specified above is shown in Fig. 9 as a function of link attenuation and for three different levels of dark count rate. As long as the link attenuation does not exceed 51 dB, a dark count rate up to \\({\\sim}250~\\mbox{cps}\\) per detector can be accommodated.\n\nA test of the Bell inequalities requires ∼1000 coincidences (corresponding to a 3-sigma violation with \\(S=2.38\\) and \\(\\Delta S=0.126\\)) [7]. With a dark count rate of 100 cps per detector, this can be reached within seconds or less if the link attenuation is less than 40 dB, and within 1 minute if the link attenuation equals \\({\\sim}50~\\mbox{dB}\\), as can be seen by evaluating Eq. (9) with the parameters of Table 3.\n\nIn the end, the quantum secured secret key rate is obtained by using Eq. (11) to evaluate the QBER in Eq. (10) as a function of the channel losses and by multiplying the result with the coincidence rate of Eq. (9). The result is shown in Fig. 10(a) for the conservative scenario of Table 3 (\\(\\tau = 1~\\mbox{ns}\\), \\(\\mu = 0.1\\)).\n\nThe construction of a key of length 105 bits could be accomplished within one ground station overpass (\\({\\sim}200~\\mbox{s}\\) measurement time) as long as the link attenuation does not exceed 40 dB and the dark count rate is below 250 cps per detector. The Mission Specification of a minimum key length of 1000 bits per experiment (one OGS overpass) can be attained with an average link loss of \\({<}45~\\mbox{dB}\\) if the dark count rate is lower than about 100 cps. If the detector dark count rates would reach roughly 1000 cps per detector, the maximum link loss that can be sustained is about 38 dB. As we will show further down, this is mostly due to the assumed very conservative coherence time window of 1 ns.\n\nWe may now investigate the effect of two important model parameters: the average number of pairs per laser pulse μ and the coincidence time window τ. Recall that together they determine the pair production rate \\(R_{\\mathrm{pair}} = \\mu/\\tau\\). Increasing μ while τ remains constant therefore has the consequence of increasing the pair production rate. This will initially result in a higher key rate, but eventually lead to an accelerated production of accidental coincidences, and an effectively lower key rate. If instead μ is kept constant and the coincidence time window τ is reduced to achieve the same increase in pair production rate, the secure key rate increases, and remains at higher levels at high link attenuation. Now a higher pair production rate will enable the experiment to tolerate a significantly higher channel loss.\n\nIt appears in fact realistic to expect a coincidence time window shorter than 1 ns. Detectors and electronics should enable reaching 200 ps easily. As mentioned in Sect. 4.3 we select single photon detectors with a jitter \\({<}90~\\mbox{ps}\\). The time tagging module itself generally contributes less than 100 ps (see Sect. 4.4: the currently pursued solution aims for 25 ps maximum and electronic jitter below 10 ps), both on the ground and in the satellite segment. A state-of-the-art OGS polarization analysis module using semi-conducting nanowire single photon detectors could contribute a mere 16-ps time jitter to the total [46]. Two other effects are expected to lead to only small increases in τ. Two photons that departed the OGS at exactly the same time may still arrive at slightly different times at the satellite, as they may have traversed slightly different path lengths. Beam spreading over the receiver aperture could lead to an increased coincidence time window, but this effect is typically of the order of 1 ps. Also, due to the large velocity at which the satellite moves, uncertainties in its exact position (of the order of tens of cm), will lead to a similar order of magnitude increase in the effective coincidence time window. Together this should lead to a coincidence time window below 200 ps. We therefore have also calculated the expected secure key rate for the case of \\(\\tau = 200~\\mbox{ps}\\) accompanied by a higher pair production rate of \\(3\\cdot10^{8}~\\mbox{s}^{-1}\\) (i.e., \\(\\mu = 0.06\\)). This is the value that the Vienna source can currently attain without damage to the SPDC crystal. We note that higher pair production rates can realistically be achieved, e.g., through the implementation of a larger crystal, but that the event timing at the OGS constitutes the real bottleneck towards even higher count rates. The result of the key rate calculation is shown in Fig. 10(b).\n\nFrom the above analysis we conclude that with conservative parameters for the source performance (\\(10^{8}~\\mbox{pairs/s}\\)) and a relatively poor timing resolution (\\(\\tau = 1~\\mbox{ns}\\)), the experiment can tolerate link losses up to 45 dB by keeping dark and background counts to well below 1000 cps. The secret key rate would reach 100 to 1000 bits/s, depending on the exact track of the satellite. Under otherwise the same conditions, but with a higher source performance as already demonstrated in practice (\\(3\\cdot10^{8}~\\mbox{s}^{-1}\\)), and especially if the coincidence time window can be kept small (\\(\\tau < 200~\\mbox{ps}\\)), the experiment can accommodate link losses up to 50 dB and still produce a secret key at a rate up to several kbits/s. This is shown in Fig. 11 for the two orbital scenarios we considered in Sect. 6: a direct overpass and a distant overpass in which the ground track passes the OGS at a distance of 500 km under atmospheric conditions characterized by a Fried parameter \\(r _{0} = 20~\\mbox{cm}\\) (at 808 nm). The figure also shows that the length of the secure key (i.e., the integrated key rate) as a function of the time during one OGS encounter."
