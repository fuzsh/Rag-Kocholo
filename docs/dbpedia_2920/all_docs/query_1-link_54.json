        "text": "The work performed in this project is part of the Test Satellite student project at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). Setting up a ground station for CubeSats is a complex task requiring considerable resources and knowledge in several fields. Extensive work and time is required if all modules and parts of the base station are developed from scratch. This work is an effort to simplify the development process by creating a module/building block for receiving, sending and displaying CubeSat data. Communication with the satellites is achieved through a software defined radio. A network protocol called CubeSat Space Protocol is used. The protocol unwrapping software will run as a background process on a web server, continuously listening for data transmissions from the satellite. Communication between the software defined radio framework and the server will use User Datagram Protocol or Transmission Control Protocol. Whenever a packet is received its content should be written to the server, either to a database or to a text file, ensuring a persistent data structure. The data stored to the server shall be accessed through a graphical user interface taking the form of a web page. It is written in Python using the Django web framework, making it easy to extend and maintain. The GUI will also have the ability to send simple commands to the satellite, requesting data transfers or in other ways command the satellite. The commands will be stored as a time tag list and transferred when the satellite is in range. Commands, defined through Djangoâ€™s administrative pages, are given via a text field. Even though the project is part of the NTNU Test Satellite project the framework is developed to be accessible and allow for uncomplicated integration into other projects. The only required protocols are CubeSat Space Protocol and User Datagram Protocol or Transmission Control Protocol. Our goal is that a module of this kind, if user-friendly in its interface and implementation, may boost the motivation for creating a global network of base stations. Such a network which would ensure continuous contact with CubeSats through their orbits.\n\nIn the paper entitled \"FPGA Implementation of Space Qualified Bundle Protocol for Satellite Communication\" a CCSDS proposed Bundle Protocol for delay / disruption tolerant networks in space is designed. The paper presents software coding and hardware implementation of Bundle Protocol using VHDL programming and its implementation on Xilinx Vertex 4 xc4vfx60 Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGAs). The existing TCP /IP based Internet protocols have many assumptions built into their architecture which make them not suitable for space. Compared to the present Internet architecture, delay / disruption tolerant networking (DTN) technology uses store and forward paradigm for latency as long as a year, persistent storage of protocol data units, custody transfer and self delimiting numeric values (SDNV) encoding scheme to minimize the transmission bandwidth. The proposed methodology in this paper is useful in highly stressed communications in space environments especially those with long link delay, intermittent connectivity, network partitions, frequent link disruptions and fewer node resources. The main focus of this paper is to design and demonstrate a three node test set up delay and disruption tolerant network lacking end-to-end connectivity, asymmetric data rates, variable delays, and high packet error rates.\n\nEmerging technologies of CubeSat communication and navigation systems enable new approaches such as larger bandwidths, spectrum and security decrement and high speed communications. In order to create a vantage point, young professionals and students from the four corners of the earth had performed a comprehensive study at the 2014 Space Generation Congress in Toronto, Canada under \"CubeSat Swarms Communication Networks and Policy Challenges\" working group. While potential possibilities are endless for the structure of Cubesat networks, decisions made amongst the group were based on existing technologies and guidelines. Therefore, the working group discussed (1) short and long term technical challenges (2) policy requirements, (3) radio communication bandwidth limitations, (4) data collection and transmission regulations and (5) the standardization of the CubeSat communication system. Technical challenges for small satellite missions involve limitations of link budgets, the size of the deployable high gain antennas, optical and laser communication and the restriction of the link budget due to the interferences. In addition, policy issues have immaturities for frequency allocation and registration complimenting the short lifespan of CubeSats. The standardization of mission operations enables a space communication network architecture that of which is similar to the internet, incorporated into CubeSat Swarms. The group suggests a CubeSat network system architecture including inter-swarm and intra-swarm constellations, optical and laser communications and delay-tolerant networks (DTN). The proposed CubeSat communication network also consists of inter-swarm constellation communications along with intra-swarm constellations sustained through four different basic data links, a mother-daughter satellite framework, and net-neutrality throughout the network. In the meantime, policy regulation recommendations allow global communication by reducing data downlink time. Governments, as well as service providers, treat all data used online the same regardless of its origins, platform, and users. The standardization of the CubeSat network system was formed by operator expectations for high downlink speeds, equal priority for data transfers, and streamlined registrations. The simplified registration process for CubeSat-Swarms is more efficient by establishing new baseline legal framework, rules, and standards. This would help all users and operators in this sector, including entrepreneurs, licensing bodies, and end-users. Saving time for everyone while achieving maximum efficiency, utilization of the time and results are the end result of proposed system architecture by the working group."
