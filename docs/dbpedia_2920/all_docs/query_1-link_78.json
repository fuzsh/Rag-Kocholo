While satisfying the goals of scalability, reliability and performance, CDFS is designed for CubeSat clusters which communicate using wireless medium and have severe power and bandwidth constraints. CDFS has successfully met the scalability, performance and reliability goals while adhering to the constraints posed by harsh environment and resource constrained nodes. It is being used as a storage layer for distributed processing and distributed communication on CubeSat clusters. In this paper, we present the system architecture, file system design, several optimizations and report several performance measurements from our simulations.\n\nKeywords: CubeSat Cluster, Distributed File System, Distributed Systems"
