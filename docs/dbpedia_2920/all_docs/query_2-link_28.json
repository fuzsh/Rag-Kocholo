        "text": "The space industry is one of today’s major growth markets and a very interesting business sector for innovation, science, and technology. In the last century, the space industry has dramatically changed and undergone strong commercialization referred to as “New Space”. In addition to the commercialization, the concept of CubeSats has become well established in the market during the last decade. The European Space Agency (ESA) has acknowledged this trend and uses CubeSat nanosatellites for projects like the OPS-SAT mission. OPS-SAT uses state-of-the-art embedded systems for various tasks. These embedded systems are the key for the great mission success of OPS-SAT and provide outstanding computational power for various experiments conducted with the OPS-SAT flying laboratory. This paper describes the fundamental design of these embedded systems and discusses some of the related achievements during the OPS-SAT mission.\n\nWhile there is no rigorous framework to develop nanosatellites flight software, this manuscript aimed to explore and establish processes to design a reliable and reusable flight software architecture for cost-efficient student Cubesat missions such as Masat-1. Masat-1 is a 1Unit CubeSat, developed using a systems engineering approach, off-the-shelf components and open-source software tools. It was our aim to use it as a test-bed platform and as an initial reference for Cubesat flight software development in Morocco. The command and data handling system chosen for Masat-1 is a system-on-module-embedded computer running freeRTOS. A real-time operating system was used in order to simplify the real-time onboard management. To ensure software design reliability, modularity, reusability and extensibility, our solution follows a layered service oriented architectural pattern, and it is based on a finite state machine in the application layer to execute the mission functionalities in a dete...\n\nThe work performed in this project is part of the Test Satellite student project at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). Setting up a ground station for CubeSats is a complex task requiring considerable resources and knowledge in several fields. Extensive work and time is required if all modules and parts of the base station are developed from scratch. This work is an effort to simplify the development process by creating a module/building block for receiving, sending and displaying CubeSat data. Communication with the satellites is achieved through a software defined radio. A network protocol called CubeSat Space Protocol is used. The protocol unwrapping software will run as a background process on a web server, continuously listening for data transmissions from the satellite. Communication between the software defined radio framework and the server will use User Datagram Protocol or Transmission Control Protocol. Whenever a packet is received its content should be written to the server, either to a database or to a text file, ensuring a persistent data structure. The data stored to the server shall be accessed through a graphical user interface taking the form of a web page. It is written in Python using the Django web framework, making it easy to extend and maintain. The GUI will also have the ability to send simple commands to the satellite, requesting data transfers or in other ways command the satellite. The commands will be stored as a time tag list and transferred when the satellite is in range. Commands, defined through Django’s administrative pages, are given via a text field. Even though the project is part of the NTNU Test Satellite project the framework is developed to be accessible and allow for uncomplicated integration into other projects. The only required protocols are CubeSat Space Protocol and User Datagram Protocol or Transmission Control Protocol. Our goal is that a module of this kind, if user-friendly in its interface and implementation, may boost the motivation for creating a global network of base stations. Such a network which would ensure continuous contact with CubeSats through their orbits."
