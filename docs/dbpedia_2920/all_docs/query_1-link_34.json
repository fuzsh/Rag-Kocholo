        "text": "What if you could hitch a ride on the next satellite launch? Or float outside the Earth's atmosphere on a balloon, as students in South Africa have done? Not physically, of course, as some galactic hitchhiker; but by peeking through the lens of a satellite that is no larger than a laptop computer. That is exactly what students, small countries’ space agencies, citizen science groups, start-ups, and hobbyists have been doing through a class of satellites called CubeSats.\n\nCubeSats are a class of satellites, whose development began in 1999 with the intent of making space science accessible to education. Unlike historically prominent satellites—large in size and expensive—CubeSats are small and low-cost. CubeSats are the Hubble and Landsat's boxy diminutive cousins, with a standardized sizing system of a 10 cm3 unit. Their design has made them particularly impactful by broadening participation in space, providing hands-on educational opportunities, and enabling innovative, exploratory space research.\n\nCubeSats are more accessible to users beyond government agencies and commercial industries, who have historically been leaders in satellite development and launch. These new users include universities, small countries’ space agencies, citizen science groups, start-ups, hobbyists, and even artists. CubeSats’ role in broadening participation in, and consequently expanding access to space exploration, has a variety of benefits for science and society, including:\n\nImproved science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education: CubeSats provide students with hands-on learning opportunities in aerospace engineering. In addition to being a professional development opportunity, Dr. Zac Manchester described the benefit as “a different level of engagement [from students] when the thing you build is going into space” (Building Blocks for Better Science).\n\nNew types of research: Standard satellites are expensive and take a long time to build. For this reason, they typically are used for low-risk missions. CubeSats, on the other hand, can be used for exploratory, high-risk research—such as NASA’s studies of bacteria genetics in space and deep space exploration—because of their inexpensive and quick development.\n\nAccelerated innovation: CubeSats enable new users from across different disciplines to contribute their ideas and unique skill sets to small satellite design. With both more participants and more diverse participants, solutions to challenges in space and on Earth can be faster and more creative.\n\nPublic engagement: CubeSats’ accessibility allows members of the public more autonomy over the research questions they address. For example, citizen scientists use CubeSats to conduct experiments of interest in space, including those that broaden our understanding of Earth. The opportunity for the public to engage with and shape research agendas can strengthen the connection between science and society.\n\nCubeSats have broadened access for many different groups of people, giving the opportunity of space exploration to new players with new ideas and research that might otherwise not be explored. However, CubeSats’ growth also exposes current challenges, and creates new ones."
