        "text": "Object #: SCP-299-DE-0032\n\nObject Description: A 5l bag full of humus/fertilizer\n\nSite of Recovery: Isle of Skye, Great Britain\n\nAnomalous Properties: Significantly accelerates plant growth.\n\nNotes: The bag had burst open when it was found. The Foundation had become aware of this object because the humus had caused extreme uncontrolled growth of heather in the pasture where it had appeared, which could still be detected 500 meters away. In the process, the plants grew twice as tall and were longer in bloom. Amnestication was waived because the plants were destroyed within a week by the cattle of resident shepherds. Eyewitnesses thought the phenomenon was a vagary of nature. Remnants of the fertilzer were collected for examination.\n\nObject #: SCP-299-DE-0089\n\nObject Description: A gauntlet made from white metal\n\nSite of Recovery: Island of Kythnos, Greece\n\nAnomalous Properties: Any form of metal gripped by the glove can be shaped according to the wishes of the wearer\n\nNotes: The item was discovered around 150 BC. Records seized by the Foundation indicate that the glove was used to construct the Antikythera mechanism. The object was later stolen by Mekhanites and recently rediscovered in a tomb on Kythnos along with the specified documents. However, the glove had been damaged by some kind of highly corrosive substance and no longer functions reliably.\n\nObject #: SCP-299-DE-0112\n\nObject Description: A tunnel boring machine\n\nSite of Recovery: Zurich, Switzerland\n\nAnomalous Properties: Drills with a high energy laser instead of a drill head with no apparent power source.\n\nNotes: The machine had apparently manifested itself directly in the rock south of Zurich and was therefore unable to move forward. However, since it was apparently in operation, it began to melt out the rock in front of it until it was so badly damaged by the rock expanding and fracturing from the heat that it shut down. The object was discovered during construction of the Zimmerberg Base Tunnel and was confiscated by the Foundation after it was excavated. The tunnel was already completed at that time and eased its transportation. The cave in which it was located was subsequently sealed. A reactivation of the object succeeded in Site-DE20 by pure coincidence. It is currently being used to dig the rail network of the Foundation's underground magnetic railroad.\n\nObject #: SCP-299-DE-0153\n\nObject Description: A white-grey cube with wires\n\nSite of Recovery: Hong Kong, China\n\nAnomalous Properties: Allows the storrage of over 400 yottabytes of data.\n\nNotes: This cube was traded on the Chinese black market and eventually arrived in Japan, where it was found by the Foundation. Along with it, a makeshift adapter was found that allowed retrieving encrypted data. Decryption of this data provided many insights into the society of a version of SCP-299-DE. It was apparently a kind of album kept by a family. It should be noted that language and writing in this SCP-299-DE instance seem to have a memetic effect, making it understandable to everyone, regardless of native language or origin. (For more information, see Log 200-Alpha). So far, it is unknown if and how many other parties have accessed the cube and copied its data. Investigations are ongoing\n\nObject #: SCP-299-DE-0201\n\nObject Description: Wreckage of a spacefaring vessel.\n\nSite of Recovery: Alice Springs, Australia\n\nAnomalous Properties: None.\n\nNotes: The wreckage materialized burning a hundred meters above the ground and destroyed a house on impact. Ten people died. The cover-up required a large Foundation contingent, as well as Class A amnesic sprayed by aircraft and antimemes printed in local newspapers. The components were recovered, but proved to be too far advanced to be repaired by today's methods. Human remains were found, but they were too badly burned to allow identification.\n\nObject #: SCP-299-DE-0245\n\nObject Description: A 2 m high and 70 cm wide canister made of metal and glass\n\nSite of Recovery: Lagos, Nigeria\n\nAnomalous Properties: Changes genetic material and phenotype of people placed in it.\n\nNotes: The object works by means of an attached control panel. Choices include things like body size, skin color, body attributes and physical abilities. It is thus possible to reshape the entire human body. The device was brought to the Germanophone Foundation and is currently being tested for usability for the ATLAS Protocol.\n\nObject #: SCP-299-DE-0299\n\nObject Description: A resonance weapon\n\nSite of Recovery: Marcos Ju√°res, Argentia\n\nAnomalous Properties: Destroys targets by reaching their natural frequency and sustaining it until structural collapse takes place.\n\nNotes: The gun was found by a child who apparently thought it was a toy gun because of its shape. The misuse of the gun destroyed two houses and caused a small earthquake before it could be confiscated. 120 people died in this incident. The incident was declared a natural disaster and, after an investigation, the weapon was placed in storage at Site DE12 until the Foundation's technology is advanced enough to replicate it.\n\nObject #: SCP-299-DE-0333\n\nObject Description: A helmet with a touchscreen\n\nSite of Recovery: Bagdad, Irak\n\nAnomalous Properties: Allows to change the personality and intelligence of a person beyond the limits of what is physically possible.\n\nNotes: The object was in the possession of the ORIA, which used it to ease interrogations. The device came into the Foundations's possession during a raid, after which it was discovered that too great a change in personality and too great an increase in cognitive ability resulted in side effects in the form of mental disorders, depression, and sudden death. Tolerance to the effect of the artifact was apparently dependent on genetic factors. The device was later stolen during an infiltration by the IMBW.\n\nObject #: SCP-299-DE-0356\n\nObject Description: A semi-fluid metal-alloy (200 Liters)\n\nSite of Recovery: Oaxaca, Mexiko\n\nAnomalous Properties: Ecteontropic worker drone\n\nNotes: Appeared in the ground and apparently began digging tunnels under the earth and excavating foundations for buildings, forming its body into tools. The undermining resulted in a severe landslide that buried several hundred homes. The object was found in the aftermath and could be deactivated by electrical current pulses. Researchers at site-DE12 subsequently managed to reactivate the artifact and are currently attempting to reprogram it. The material must be stored in a spinning barrel because it will start moving again and run its program when it comes to rest.\n\nObject #: SCP-299-DE-0409\n\nObject Description: A weapon of mass destruction\n\nSite of Recovery: Rings of Saturn\n\nAnomalous Properties: Fires a white beam that travels at faster than light speed. Radiation measurements with SCP-‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà-DE suggest that hit objects are halfly converted into antimatter, which then annihilates with the remaining matter.\n\nNotes: The object has the shape of a pen and is estimated to be about 12 meters long and 5 meters thick. It is labeled with silver paint and has writing on it that was used to identify it as an SCP-299-DE instance. Since its discovery, the device has fired five times at irregular intervals. With the help of SCP-‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà-DE, two hits could be confirmed, once near the center of the Milky Way and once at a location in the Horsehead Nebula. The targets, an asteroid about the size of Mars' moon Phobos and a star three times the mass of the Sun, were destroyed without residue.\n\nObject #: SCP-299-DE-0476\n\nObject Description: A powered armor\n\nSite of Recovery: Cham des Bondons, France\n\nAnomalous Properties: The object seems to be a construction tool, as it does not seem to have any weapons. More detailed investigations could not be carried out yet, because the suit could not be opened or damaged so far. The object was discovered during excavations on the Cham of Bondon, together with a stone slab with runes and engravings from the Copper Age. The engravings show a humanoid apparently carrying a large object, surrounded by other humanoids who appear to be cheering. The runes accompanying it apparently form the words \"The Erector/The Builder.\" Because of the absence of other records, several theories exist about this object. For example, it is believed that the original finder of the artifact, or at least the one who last wore it, is still encased within it. A claim that has not yet been proven, as non-destructive imaging techniques have not yet been able to penetrate the object. Another theory assumes that the carrier set up the numerous menhirs that can be found on the Cham of the Bondon. The reason for this, however, is unknown."
