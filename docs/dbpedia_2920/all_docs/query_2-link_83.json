The satellite was deployed from ISS and is operational. https://amsat-uk.org/2017/05/19/lilacsat-1-cubesat-iss/ http://lilacsat.hit.edu.cn/?page_id=594 FM to Codec2 digital audio repeater of LilacSat-1 is now switched on. 145.985 PL 67 UP, 436.510 DOWN It seems a few folks keep posting LilacSat-1 information in the Twitter format and toss in a few links. Here is another link if it helps any ... http://destevez.net/2016/10/lilacsat-1-codec-2-downlink/ Built by students at the Harbin Institute of Technology the new LilacSat CubeSat has a 145/436 MHz FM / Codec2-BPSK Digital Voice transponder. It will deploy from the ISS at 0815 GMT Tuesday, May 23. The Lilac 2 satellite multi-mode transponder can work as an APRS digipeater and FM repeater. The science goals of the mission include building flight software development for an on-orbit test platform, which is used to analyze the effect of space single particle effects on FPGA software function and performance. The satellite also includes equipment for global flight ADS-B and monitoring and tracking of large wildlife traces and other tasks. The satellite also carries an industrial infrared camera to explore the feasibility and effectiveness of using satellite satellites to monitor the environment. The FM transponder is expected to be a popular mode using amateur radio FM walkie-talkies or mobile radios. The voice filter passband is in the range of 300~3500 Hz. Below 300Hz below the sub-audio in the form of baseband data emplying a CCSDS mode of 300 bps telemetry data transmission. The BJ1SI-1 APRS digipeater will immediately forward the received UI frame in real-time. The BJ1SI-2 APRS digipeater will allow delayed forwarding with a user specified forwarding path and an ASCII coded time delay.

She says working on the CubeSat has allowed her to practically implement a lot of what she learns theoretically at university The Jordan Times reports on the country's first CubeSat JY1-SAT which was built under the Masar initiative of the Crown Prince Foundation (CPF), by 16 young Jordanian men and women. The satellite is scheduled to be launched on a mission in February 2018, a date on which the team pins great hopes and ambitions. These young Jordanians were supervised by a group of experts and academics through their weekly meetings held at the Royal Jordanian Radio Amateurs Society (RJRAS). JY1-SAT was chosen as a tribute to His Majesty the Late King Hussein of Jordan whose amateur radio call sign was JY1. The CubeSat will carry an Amateur Radio FUNcube 435/145 MHz SSB/CW transponder and a Slow Scan Digital Video (SSDV) system to transmit stored images reflecting the Jordanian culture and its historical heritage.

The expedition takes place next weekend, May 20th and 21st 2017; a long weekend up here in Canada. He will be driving up from his home QTH in FN03 and will arrive in Chibougamau QC on the afternoon of Saturday May 20th. There are several favorable passes on Saturday evening and hw hopes to spend a few hours handing out FN29 to get warmed up. Sunday the 21st looks like a bonanza of great passes! The trouble will be deciding when to break so he can move to a different location. The plan at this time is to set up on the FN29/39 boundary in the morning and operate there for a few hours. Then he will move to FO20/30 and then FO20/FN29. More information about operating schedules will be posted on amsat-bb as he gets closer to departure date. He will also post information on his QRZ page at https://qrz.com/db/VE3HLS [ANS thanks Ken, VE3HLS for the above information] --------------------------------------------------------------------- Asia Islands on the Air Satellite Activation Operators Makoto/JI5RPT and Toru/JI5USJ will be active as homecall/1 from Shikine Island (North Izu Island) between 0000z, May 20th and 0000z, May 21st. Activity will be on 160/80/40/30/20/17/15/12/10/6 meters using CW, RTTY and PSK31. There will also be satellite operations.

The K2Sat's primary mission is to demonstrate satellite imaging and transfer, to also test voice repeating capability. The followings are the payloads: 1. On-board camera 2. On-board voice repeater proposing a V/U FM voice transceiver 3. 9k6 BSPK AX25 downlink for data and telemetry and planning a 2 Mbit QPSK downlink on S Band. The launch is planned for a 500/600km SSO orbit in 2018. [ANS thanks the IARU for the above information] --------------------------------------------------------------------- Lloyd V. Berkner Space Policy Internships The Space Studies Board is seeking applicants for the Lloyd V. Berkner Space Policy Internships for autumn 2017. The goal of the program is to provide promising undergraduate and graduate students with the opportunity to work in the area of civil space research policy in the nation's capital. Established in 1958, the Space Studies Board is the principal advisory group providing independent scientific and programmatic advice to NASA and other government agencies on all aspects of civil space research and associated ground-based activities. Interns typically undertake one or more short-term research projects designed to assist with or to enhance ongoing study projects. Applicants must be registered students (undergraduate or graduate) at a U.S. university or college who have completed their junior year. Applicants should have long-term career goals in space science research, applications or policy. Applications are due June 2, 2017. For more information and a full list of eligibility requirements, visit http://sites.nationalacademies.org/SSB/SSB_052239. Please direct questions about this internship to Dr. David H. Smith at dhsmith(a)nas.edu.

As SpaceX has disrupted the large scale market, so does Vector Space hope their new rocket system can disrupt the small scale market by eliminating the need for ride-share requirements small satellites currently face while significantly lowering the cost to small satellite customers. The first test flight, conducted on 3 May from the Mojave Desert in California, used a single-engine scaled-down model of the three-engine Vector-R rocket and allowed the company to test aspects of launch operations – including its infrastructure-lite launch architecture approach – for their rocket as well as portions of its 3D-printed components and pressure-fed engine design. The suborbital test flight launched from the Friends of Amateur Rocketry site in California’s Mojave Desert at 12:00 PDT (19:00 GMT) on 3 May and reached a maximum altitude of 1,370 m (4,500 ft). The second test flight, expected in July, will radically shift launch operations to a never-before-used location – the U.S. state of Georgia – and will highlight what Vector Space says is an innovative solution to various launch market needs with an ability to launch from locations outside the standard U.S. Ranges. This Georgia test will occur from Camden County – the state’s southern-most county, which borders Florida’s north-eastern most boundary. Following completion of the Vector-R test flight series, Vector Space plans to introduce the Vector-R rocket for commercial launch operations in 2018. From there, the company currently has 12 commercial launches for the Vector-R planned in 2019, with an eventual eye toward ramping up operations to 100 launches of the Vector-R later in its operational life.
