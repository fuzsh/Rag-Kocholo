This document summarizes research into magnetic control systems for the MCubed-2 CubeSat. It discusses both passive control using permanent magnets and hysteresis rods, and active control using a magnetorquer coil. Order-of-magnitude torque calculations are provided for environmental disturbances. The current baseline design for MCubed-2 uses a neodymium ring magnet and 193-turn coil that can generate 0.36 A-m2 of magnetic moment. Manufacturing and testing plans are also mentioned.",
