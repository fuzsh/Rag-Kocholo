        "text": "Usage of Software-Defined Radio (SDR) in digital communication systems can easily cater to sophisticated coding and modulation techniques, to meet the ever-increasing requirements of the wireless communication industry. Future generation of wireless communications will meet the requirements of Software Radio technology as it would provide the state-of-art design to complex radio designs. Software-defined radios are configurable devices in which the components can be reprogrammed to emulate various functionalities like data rate, modulation, filtering etc. Field programmable architectures provide a suitable platform to achieve such run-time reconfigurations of the components of the radio. The proposed design is implemented in SPARTAN3 FPGA by using Xilinx ISE 13.4 and verilog and simulated in modelsim 6.3f. The Chipscope pro Analyzer is used to view the execution results of FPGA.\n\nCurrent small satellite platforms such as CubeSats require robust and versatile communication subsystems that allow the reconfiguration of the critical operating parameters such as carrier frequency, transmission power, bandwidth, or filter roll-off factor. A reconfigurable Analog Back-End for the space segment of a satellite communication subsystem is presented in this work. This prototype is implemented on a 9.5 cm2 6-layer PCB, and it operates from 0.070 to 6 GHz and complies with CubeSat and IPC-2221 standards. The processing, control, and synchronizing stages are carried out on a Software-Defined Radio approach executed on a baseband processor. Results showed that the signal power at the output of the proposed Analog Back-End is suitable for feeding the following antenna subsystem. Furthermore, the emitted radiation levels by the transmission lines do not generate electromagnetic interference.\n\nAbstract: Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based transceiver is purely a new kind of digital implementation of transceiver in Software Defined Radio (SDR) platform. This replaces a multiple platform based system with a single platform. It guarantees reliable, reconfigurable, handy transmitter and receiver. A high-level programming language is used to simulate and implement system in real time.\n\nThe rapid growth of SmallSat and CubeSat missions at NASA has necessitated a re-evaluation of communication and remote-sensing architectures. Novel designs for CubeSat-sized single-board computers can now include larger Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and faster System-on-Chip (SoCs) devices. These components substantially improve onboard processing capabilities so that varying subsystems no longer require an independent processor. By replacing individual Radio Frequency (RF) systems with a single software-defined radio (SDR) and processor, mission designers have greater control over reliability, performance, and efficiency. The presented architecture combines individual processing systems into a single design and establishes a modular SDR architecture capable of both remote-sensing and communication applications. This new approach based on a multi-input multioutput (MIMO) SDR features a scalable architecture optimized for Size, Weight, Power, and Cost (SWaP-C), with sufficie...\n\nSoftware defined radio is a feasible solution for reconfigurable radios, which can perform different functions at different times on the same hardware. The project uses integrating FPGA with multicore Software defined Radio development platform design wireless communication system. It constructs the system on the Matlab/Simulink environment in the way of Model-based Design, and realizes transmitter section with FPGA. Finally, it uses Hardware-in-the-loop co-simulation to observe the bits error rate of system under the white Gaussian noise channel disturbance of different SNR values. The performance of the baseband transmitter is analyzed using constellation and eye diagrams for different modulation techniques and different signal to noise ratios."
