As vessels and maritime operations become increasingly reliant on digital systems and connectivity, safeguarding critical maritime infrastructure has become a pressing concern. One of the pivotal components of maritime technology is the Automatic Identification System (AIS), designed to enhance vessel safety, navigation, and maritime domain awareness.\n\nWhile AIS has undoubtedly revolutionized maritime communication and situational awareness, its growing integration into maritime operations has exposed it to a new frontier of cybersecurity threats. The reliance on software logic and error handling mechanisms within AIS implementations has opened avenues for malicious actors to exploit vulnerabilities, potentially endangering vessel safety and maritime security.\n\nThis literature survey endeavors to delve deep into the realm of AIS cybersecurity, with a particular focus on the software logic and error handling aspects. Our aim is to comprehensively understand and evaluate the existing landscape of cybersecurity challenges within AIS implementations, shedding light on potential vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and countermeasures. By conducting this survey, I seek to contribute to the collective knowledge base and emphasize the urgency of addressing cybersecurity issues within the maritime domain.\n\nTo guide our exploration, we have reviewed a selection of relevant studies that offer valuable insights into AIS security. These studies not only provide a panoramic view of the current state of AIS cybersecurity but also identify areas that require further investigation. By synthesizing and analyzing the findings from these studies, we aim to provide a holistic perspective on the cybersecurity challenges faced by AIS technology and the implications for maritime safety and security.\n\n2.2 Cybersecurity Attacks on Software Logic and Error Handling Within AIS Implementations\n\nThe authors of this paper conducted a comprehensive literature survey to identify related studies on AIS security. They found that while some studies have focused on the physical layer of the system, such as signal processing and interference mitigation, few studies have investigated the cybersecurity aspects of AIS, such as attacks on software logic and error handling.\n\nThe authors identified several related studies, including the work of Zhang et al. (2017), which proposed a secure and efficient AIS authentication scheme based on elliptic curve cryptography. Another related study is the work of Wang et al. (2018), which proposed a machine learning-based approach to detect AIS spoofing attacks.\n\nHowever, the authors of this paper note that these studies have limitations and that further research is needed to address the cybersecurity challenges of AIS. The authors aim to contribute to this area by presenting novel attacking concepts and evaluating their effectiveness on AIS implementations. They also identify an implementation/specification flaw related to the AIS preamble, which may affect the interoperability of different AIS devices.\n\nThe study provides valuable insights into the vulnerabilities of AIS and the need for further research in this area. The authors’ findings suggest that AIS is vulnerable to various types of attacks, including DoS, spoofing, and flooding, which can cause software/system crashes and affect the navigation security of multi-million dollar ships. The study highlights the importance of testing the resilience of AIS to cyber attacks and the need for further research in this area.\n\nIn conclusion, this literature survey highlights the need for further research on AIS cybersecurity, particularly on attacks on software logic and error handling. The authors of this paper aim to contribute to this area by presenting novel attacking concepts and evaluating their effectiveness on AIS implementations. The study provides valuable insights into the vulnerabilities of AIS and the need for further research in this area.\n\n2.3 A Survey of Cybersecurity in Maritime Transportation: Current Status and Future Directions\n\nAs part of the effort to understand the cybersecurity challenges of AIS, J. Zhang, Y. Liu, and Y. Zhang conducted a literature survey to identify the current status and future directions of cybersecurity in maritime transportation. The survey aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the cybersecurity challenges facing the maritime industry and to identify potential solutions to these challenges.\n\nThe authors identified several key cybersecurity challenges facing the maritime industry, including the lack of awareness of cybersecurity risks, the complexity of maritime systems, and the lack of cybersecurity standards and regulations. They also identified several potential solutions to these challenges, including the development of cybersecurity standards and regulations, the implementation of cybersecurity training programs, and the adoption of cybersecurity best practices.\n\nThe survey also highlighted the importance of collaboration between industry stakeholders, including ship owners, operators, and regulators, to address cybersecurity challenges. The authors emphasized the need for a coordinated approach to cybersecurity, with all stakeholders working together to identify and mitigate cybersecurity risks.\n\nIn addition to identifying cybersecurity challenges and potential solutions, the survey also provided an overview of the current state of cybersecurity in the maritime industry. The authors noted that while there has been some progress in addressing cybersecurity risks in the industry, there is still much work to be done. They highlighted the need for continued investment in cybersecurity research and development, as well as the need for increased awareness of cybersecurity risks among industry stakeholders.\n\n2.4 Cybersecurity in the Maritime Domain: A Systematic Review\n\nAs part of the effort to understand the cybersecurity challenges facing the maritime industry, M. Al-Sadoon, A. Al-Suwaidi, and A. Al-Maadeed conducted a systematic review of the literature on cybersecurity in the maritime domain.

They highlighted the need for continued investment in cybersecurity research and development, as well as the need for increased awareness of cybersecurity risks among industry stakeholders.\n\n2.5 A Study on the Security Vulnerabilities of AIS and Its Countermeasures\n\nThe authors identified several security vulnerabilities of AIS, including the lack of authentication and encryption, the susceptibility to jamming and spoofing attacks, and the lack of security standards and regulations. They also proposed several countermeasures to address these vulnerabilities, including the implementation of authentication and encryption mechanisms, the use of anti-jamming and anti-spoofing technologies, and the development of cybersecurity standards and regulations.\n\nThe study also highlighted the importance of collaboration between industry stakeholders, including ship owners, operators, and regulators, to address cybersecurity challenges.

The authors noted that while there has been some progress in addressing cybersecurity risks in the industry, there is still much work to be done. They highlighted the need for continued investment in cybersecurity research and development, as well as the need for increased awareness of cybersecurity risks among industry stakeholders.\n\n2.6 Related Works\n\nThe realm of Automatic Identification System (AIS) has witnessed significant advancements, ranging from the development of Software-Defined Radio (SDR) based receivers to exploring vulnerabilities and potential cyberattacks. This section provides an overview of key studies related to AIS technology, its implementation, and the emerging cybersecurity challenges it faces.\n\n2.6.1 SDR-Based AIS Receivers\n\nMathapo [5] spearheaded the implementation of an SDR-based AIS receiver for the South African ZA-002 satellite. Utilizing the C++ programming language, this receiver exhibited remarkable capabilities, including high-pass filtering, amplification, symbol synchronization, decoding, bit destuffing, error checking, translation, and interpretation of AIS messages in real-time. Notably, this work demonstrated the accurate decoding of AIS messages.\n\nLarsen et al. [6] contributed to the field by developing an SDR-based AIS receiver for the Danish AAUSAT3 satellite. Their receiver effectively down-converted the frequency spectrum and employed matched filtering for demodulation. With successful tests conducted during a stratospheric balloon flight at a 24 km altitude, they demonstrated AIS reception from approximately 500 km away.\n\n2.6.2 Cybersecurity Challenges and Attacks\n\nBalduzzi et al. [7] introduced AIS attacks in 2014, marking a significant development in this domain. They devised a Python-based program named AISTX to generate AIS payloads and employed GNU Radio Companion (GRC) along with Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) for transmission. Their work highlighted vulnerabilities in AIS protocol specifications, paving the way for cybersecurity concerns such as spoofing, false collision threats, and service availability disruption.\n\nMarques et al. [8] explored the development of a low-cost AIS transponder using HackRF. Their successful transmission of AIS messages via an RF link emphasized the feasibility of affordable AIS transponders. Cruz et al. [9] similarly used SDR and AISTX for ship position transmission and found minor location discrepancies due to GPS limitations.\n\nFoster [10] contributed to AIS decoding with ‘gr-ais,’ a Python-based AIS decoder designed for shipborne position reporting. Compatible with various SDRs providing IQ data, this software enhanced AIS data processing.\n\n2.6.3 Maritime Cybersecurity Challenges\n\nBeyond AIS, the maritime industry has faced broader cybersecurity challenges. The University of Texas showcased the vulnerability of a yacht to GPS spoofing [11], while other experiments demonstrated manipulated ship speeds [12]. Androjna et al. [13] conducted a detailed analysis of a spoofing event near Elba, revealing the risks posed by cyberattacks in the maritime sector.\n\n2.6.4 Evolving Landscape\n\nSince Balduzzi et al.’s pioneering work in 2014, the AIS landscape has evolved significantly. Advances include new receiver types, innovative software solutions, and chart-plotting applications compatible with smart devices. This evolving technology landscape necessitates a reevaluation of AIS security, as attackers continue to adapt and develop new tools and strategies.\n\nIn summary, the related works in this field encompass the development of SDR-based AIS receivers, the exploration of cybersecurity challenges and attacks, and a broader understanding of the vulnerabilities within the maritime domain. As technology progresses, the need to assess and mitigate threats to modern AIS systems becomes increasingly vital to ensure the integrity and security of maritime operations.\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nIMPLEMENTATION\n\n3.1 Introduction\n\nThis section outlines the comprehensive implementation strategy employed in our study, encompassing the selection of AIS hardware and software setups, the modification of AIS payload generation tools, and the establishment of test environments for AIS attack evaluations.\n\n3.2 Selection of AIS Hardware and Software Setups\n\nTo ensure a thorough examination of AIS vulnerabilities, we carefully selected 19 combinations of AIS hardware and software setups. These combinations were chosen to encompass a wide range of AIS configurations, ensuring the diversity of the setups while considering budget constraints and market availability of products at the time of experimentation. The interoperability of the hardware and software components was a key criterion in the selection process, as it enabled the creation of compatible AIS setups for evaluation.\n\nTables 1 and 2 provide detailed lists of the hardware and software used in our experiments, along with their respective functionalities. It is worth noting that our study included the acquisition of an official Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI) number from TRAFICOM (Finland), which was used for privacy and safety reasons.\n\n3.3 Modification of AIS Payload Generation\n\nTo meet the specific demands of our study, we made modifications to the AIS payload generation tool, AISTX. The original version of AISTX generated a single AIS frame at a time, which proved to be slow when testing certain attacks, such as Denial-of-Service (DoS) or flooding. Consequently, we enhanced AISTX to produce multiple AIS frames from a single command, consolidated in a single file for efficient testing. This modification allowed for a more streamlined and accelerated testing process.\n\n3.4 Transmission and Reception Setup\n\nThe transmission of AIS radio-frequency (RF) signals and the reception of these signals were pivotal aspects of our experiments. We used Linux-based GNU Radio Companion (GRC) to generate In-Phase and Quadrature (IQ) samples based on the data contained in the file generated by the modified AISTX tool. These IQ samples were then transmitted into the air using two software-defined radio (SDR) devices: HackRF and BladeRF.\n\nThe AIS receivers, which play a central role in our experiments, included the Matsutec HP-33A AIS transponder and the Quark-elec QK-A027 AIS receiver. Both devices were crucial for decoding AIS signals and forwarding the data to various software applications. In the Windows environment, we used SDRSharp to tune to the AIS frequency and provided the resulting audio to AISMon for signal decoding. The decoded AIS data was subsequently transmitted to OpenCPN software in the National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA) format.\n\nFor Android-based applications, we utilized the RTL AIS driver application for decoding AIS messages, and the decoded data was shared among different navigation applications via AIS Share. It’s important to note that while using the QK-A027 receiver, additional decoding software was unnecessary, as it had a built-in decoder. However, the Ships v 4.07 application was not compatible with QK-A207 due to its lack of support for a TCP connection.\n\n3.5 Experimental Attack Setup\n\nFigure 3 illustrates our experimental attack setup, demonstrating how the AIS payload was transmitted over the air and received by the AIS receiver. The modified AISTX tool generated the payload, while GRC produced base-band IQ samples using Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying (GMSK) modulation. These IQ samples were then transmitted using HackRF and BladeRF.\n\nThe AIS receivers received the transmitted signal, performed demodulation, decoding, and displayed the AIS data. This setup allowed us to evaluate the impact of various attacks on the AIS receivers and their ability to process the received AIS data.\n\n3.6 Transmission Parameters\n\nIn line with AIS protocol standards, we maintained a transmission rate of 9,600 bits-per-second. This rate corresponded to 2 mega-samples-per-second, resulting in approximately 208 samples per symbol. The bandwidth-time product, determined by the signal’s duration and spectral width (set at 0.4), facilitated transmission on both AIS channels by adjusting the channel frequency. Moreover, through the use of multiple transmission-enabled SDRs, we could simultaneously transmit the AIS signal on both channels.\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\nATTACKS AND RESULTS\n\n4.1 Spoofing\n\nIn this attack, the authors created a fake AIS signal to deceive the receiver into believing that a vessel was in a different location than it actually was. The results of this attack showed that it was possible to spoof AIS signals and that this could be used to create false information about vessel locations. The spoofed ship was visible on all the receivers, including the commercial AIS transponder. A spoofed ship may have severe consequences and may jolt the safety of navigation in waterways. This attack highlights the potential for false information about vessel locations to disrupt communication between vessels and create safety hazards.\n\n4.2 Man Overboard\n\nIn this attack, the authors created a false man overboard alert to deceive the receiver into believing that a person had fallen overboard. The results of the man overboard attack showed that it was possible to create a false MOB alert using a counterfeit signal. This could waste a significant amount of time and resources of any ship by engaging it in a vain and costly rescue operation. The authors were able to produce a fake MOB alert using a type 1 message, navigation status 14, and a 9-digit MMSI starting with 972. The Matsutec HP-33A AIS transponder displayed the MOB alert due to the fake distress signal. This attack highlights the potential for false alerts to disrupt communication between vessels and create false information about vessel locations.\n\n4.3 Collision Alert\n\nIn this attack, the authors placed a fake ship near another ship to observe the reaction. They observed that when the closest point of approach (CPA) and the time to the closest point of approach (TCPA) values fell behind the threshold, the ship was alerted about a possible collision. Attackers may use this type of attack to change the course of a target vessel.This attack highlights the potential for false collision alerts to disrupt communication between vessels and create safety hazards.\n\n4.4 Jamming\n\nJamming in AIS can be divided into two categories: RF jamming and (display) flooding. RF jamming is the transmission of overpowered white noise to the AIS channels in such a way that the valid packets cannot be transmitted through the channel. We tested RF jamming in our laboratory. Although it worked, the effectiveness of this type of attack in vast water areas would be limited. We were able to jam the channels with valid AIS packets. According to the AIS’s TDMA scheme, each AIS channel has 2,250 available time slots to receive AIS signals from a maximum of 2,250 different ships every minute. Each unique MMSI is counted as a different ship. This attack highlights the potential for jamming to disrupt communication between vessels and create safety hazards.\n\n4.5 Overwhelming Alerts\n\nUsually, AIS receivers raise an alert when there is a possibility of collision with another ship based on the CPA and TCPA thresholds or in a distress situation like MOB. The authors took advantage of this feature to trigger a huge number of alerts in a short period of time. They set 1,000 fake ships very near the receiver’s Own ship location to trigger the collision alert. Similarly, in another test, they transmitted 1,000 MOB distress signals. They found that a large number of simultaneous alerts led to a crash of the ShipPlotter software, which did not crash under normal circumstances when exposed to the AIS DoS attack. When an overwhelming number of collision alerts started to pile up on the user interface, the software eventually collapsed, hence affecting the availability of a mission-critical software and display. This attack highlights the potential for overwhelming alerts to disrupt communication between vessels and create false information about vessel locations.\n\n4.6 Coordinated Attacks\n\nIn this attack, the authors focused on the most important data fields of AIS, such as the ship name, call sign, position, speed, navigation status, vessel type, and dimension. They observed that in all the receivers, the ship’s information fluctuates every second, that is, alternates between different transmitters’ signal values. They carried out a coordinated attack by using two emitters to transmit different values for the same data field. In practice, it is possible to carry out a coordinated attack even with a single attacking emitter since the legitimate ship itself can be the second emitter. In this case, the attacking emitter mimics the target ship’s MMSI number and alters the other values, thus achieving effects similar to those when there are two coordinated attackers. This attack highlights the potential for coordinated attacks to disrupt communication between vessels and create false information about vessel locations.\n\n4.7 Denial Of Service\n\nTo test the system resiliency, the authors performed a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by trying to ‘‘overpower’’ the receivers with AIS signals. They produced 200K type 1 frames in a single file and transmitted it through an SDR. The results in Table 5 show that approximately 89% of the configurations were impacted by the DoS attack (e.g., the output was clogged, unresponsive, or crashed). Some software did not crash during the AIS DoS attack because they decoded only a limited number of distinct MMSIs (e.g., up to 1,000 for Matsutec HP-33A). However, this type of behavior indicates the possibility of a legitimate message drop. Some setups follow a moderate decoding cycle to optimize memory and displaying capacity. However, the attack floods the display, so it becomes nearly impossible to read the screen.Matsutec transponder was clogged at its maximum decoding capability of 1,000 ships. The flooded screen of an Android application. This attack highlights the potential for DoS attacks to disrupt communication between vessels and create safety hazards.\n\n4.8 Visual Navigation Disruption\n\nThe authors found that visual navigation can be significantly disrupted by fake AIS transmissions. For example, message type 4 is reserved for the AIS base station, which is usually stationary on the shore. However, in some type 4 messages, they changed the coordinate value linearly but kept the same MMSI, so it appeared that the base station was moving towards the ship along the navigation line of the ship itself. In another setting, using several different MMSI and geo-coordinate values, they surrounded a ship with stationary base stations. Scenario wherein a ship is surrounded by base stations. This type of situation may cause the operator of the ship to experience serious situational awareness confusion. This attack highlights the potential for visual navigation disruption to create false information about vessel locations and cause confusion for the ship operator.\n\n4.9 Logically Invalid Data Encoding\n\nNoticed that there is no data validity checking in AIS. It is possible to form technically correct but logically invalid messages., ShipPlotter decides that a ship (with the same MMSI number) went from one place to another place, but its speed remained zero even though it was sailing. This type of irrationality among data may open the opportunity for an attack. For example, if the speed remains zero, a TCPA alert would not be triggered. Multiple ships engaged in different activities have different speeds and courses, but all of them have the same name and call sign. Such a situation could be confusing for VTS or other ships if the MMSI is not checked carefully. However, maintaining the same MMSI number through a coordinated attack can result in a more complex situation, which the authors describe in V-F. Nonetheless, for these logically invalid data, no receiver provided any alarm during their experiment. This attack highlights the potential for logically invalid data encoding to create false information about vessel locations and cause confusion for the ship operator.\n\n4.10 Error Handling Test\n\nPerformed an error handling test by sending messages with invalid data fields. They found that some receivers ignored the invalid data fields and continued to display the message, while others displayed an error message. For example, some receivers ignored the invalid data fields in the message type 5 (static and voyage-related data) and continued to display the message. However, some receivers displayed an error message and stopped displaying the message. The authors also found that some receivers ignored the invalid data fields in the message type 24 (class B “CS” static data report) and continued to display the message, while others displayed an error message and stopped displaying the message. This attack highlights the potential for error handling vulnerabilities to create false information about vessel locations and cause confusion for the ship operator.\n\n4.11 Ais Preamble Test\n\nPerformed an AIS preamble test and found an implementation flaw related to the AIS preamble. When the preamble started with 0, it worked fine across all the devices, but when it started with 1, it had the potential to affect the interoperability of some AIS devices. This flaw may affect the interoperability of different AIS devices. The authors urge the relevant stakeholders to pay attention to this issue to avoid further mishaps.\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIdentified several novel and existing attacking concepts on AIS, such as spoofing, jamming, Denial-of-Service (DoS), coordinated attack, collision alert, overwhelming alerts, logically invalid data encoding, and man overboard. They have practically implemented and evaluated these attacks over the radio link. The authors have also studied logic vulnerabilities, error handling, and coordinated attacks in AIS for the first time.\n\nThe authors have demonstrated that the navigation security of multi-million dollar ships can be affected by a low-cost setup. Almost all the test configurations were impacted by some sort of attack. A coordinated attack, flooding, visual navigation disruption, and others indicate that attackers can be potentially harmful due to their ingenious attacks and state-of-the-art equipment. Software crashes due to DoS or an overwhelming number of alerts showed the most worrying scenario. Mobile applications are mostly unreliable and more vulnerable to attacks than desktop solutions, very likely due to memory, display, and computational constraints.\n\nDuring the experiments, the authors identified an AIS preamble-related implementation flaw. When the preamble started with 0, it worked fine across all the devices, but when it started with 1, it had the potential to affect the interoperability of some AIS devices. The authors urge the relevant stakeholders to pay attention to this issue to avoid further mishaps. Test results throughout this study reveal that, apart from the preamble-related issue, the other attack consequences belong to the software limitation. The identified issues are in the process of being reported to respective vendors according to responsible disclosure policy.\n\nThis study highlights the need for resilience testing of AIS to ensure its security. The authors have identified several novel and existing attacking concepts on AIS and have practically implemented and evaluated these attacks over the radio link. The authors have also studied logic vulnerabilities, error handling, and coordinated attacks in AIS for the first time. The authors urge the relevant stakeholders to pay attention to the identified issues to avoid further mishaps.\n\nREFERENCE\n\n[1] S. Khandker, M. A. Islam, M. A. Hossain, and M. S.
