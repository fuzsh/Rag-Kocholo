        "meta_description": "The Internet has dramatically transformed people's lives, fundamentally altering how we communicate, work, and access information. Today, staying \"connected\" is a priority no matter where we are, from bustling urban centers to remote wilderness areas. As we look toward the future, 6G technology promises to push the boundaries of connectivity even further, encompassing not only terrestrial networks but also satellite communications. However, beyond our immediate surroundings and the global infrastructure, there lies a fascinating frontier: deep space communications. This realm involves establishing and maintaining communication links with distant celestial bodies such as the Moon, Mars, and even further into the cosmos. In this month’s article, Marc Blanchet discusses the challenges of deep space communications and how Internet Protocols can be adjusted and utilized in this extraordinary environment.",

        "text": "These relays are relatively unintelligent in the sense that they do not create a true network because, for example, there is no consideration of alternate paths, nor do they make any routing decisions. However, during time slots where no communication is possible, for example when the Mars relay is on the opposite side of the planet to the rover, the relay stores temporarily the frames until communication is re-established. For Mars, communication delays and interruptions are managed by a brokering software [MAROS] where missions such as the Deep Space Network and relays around Mars provide communication windows to other missions such as those of exploration robots on the surface of Mars. Everything is specified and planned in advance. If a planned communication cannot be used for one reason or another, the window of communication is lost.\n\nNowadays, space conquest has undergone significant transformations. Indeed, industrialization now allows for a decrease in the construction costs of space devices. A good example is the CubeSat [CUBESAT], which consists of a simple and relatively small format of satellites, allowing less affluent actors and projects to send devices into space at a lower cost. Furthermore, the space industry now uses less demanding electronic components [COTSESA] [COTSNASA], allowing for significant cost reductions but requiring more verification tests, including radiation testing. Finally, launcher innovation led by SpaceX has significantly reduced launch costs. Finally, recent tests [LCRD] [PSYCHE] show that optical communications using lasers will be possible in deep space, enabling much larger and symmetrical bandwidth. These combined changes create a new era where many small to large companies and organizations become players in this space conquest. Space agencies used to define the specifications themselves and then subcontract the realization are now in a mode of contracting for commercial services where they can rent services according to their needs. These services include communications and networking. In some ways, the Internet has seen similar history where the initial funding was from governments and then commercialization and openness enables a large network to be built creating a platform for innovation. The key to make this happen is to use standards, ensuring interoperability between all protocols, software and infrastructure.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Vint Cerf and JPL engineers investigated if the Internet Protocol (IP) suite would be usable to create a network in deep space [RFC4838], named the Solar System Internet [IPNSIG]. We use the term deep space here to clearly differentiate with the various orbits (LEO, MEO, GEO) around Earth where IP is already in use. Deep space here means communications with the Moon and its orbits, Mars and beyond as well as cruising spacecrafts.\n\nTheir conclusion was that the IP protocol stack is not usable in deep space given its unique characteristics, such as very large and variable delays and long communication interruptions, where the current IP transport and applications at that time were too chatty for that use case. For example, the round-trip time (RTT) from Earth to Mars can range from a few minutes to 40 minutes, due to the propagation delays of radio waves in space and the position of the planets relative to each other. Long interruptions can be from a few seconds to several days or weeks. For instance, Mars may be on the other side of the Sun from Earth, as illustrated in Figure 2, creating a period where direct communications are not possible, a situation that occurs every 2 years. The last Martian solar conjunction took place in November 2023 when, for two weeks, no direct communication was possible between the two planets [MARSCONJUNCTION].\n\nA network protocol working with long delays and interruptions is called Delay and Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN). It was deemed necessary to create a completely new network stack using a store and forward paradigm. The result is the Bundle Protocol [RFC9171], which is different and incompatible with IP. Since then, there has been work in both the Internet Engineering Task Force [IETFDTN] and the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems [CCSDS] to engineer all the pieces necessary for a full functional networking stack, obviously a major undertaking, which is still not quite complete.\n\nA group of Internet engineers recently reassessed [DEEPSPACEIPREASSESSMENT] the use of the IP stack in deep space. Since the initial assessment in early 2000’s, the IP stack has evolved a lot, including the capability of handling Internet of Things [IoT] which have many similarities with space usage, such as low bandwidth, low energy, intermittent communications, low CPU and low memory. Since the early 2000’s, the QUIC transport protocol [RFC9000] has also been invented and is now a significant portion of Internet traffic [CLOUDFLAREHTTP3]. The Deep Space IP work is currently being carried out as an informal group [DEEPSPACEIP], meeting at the IETF.\n\nThe primary conclusion of this new assessment is that the IP stack is usable in deep space. There are essentially three places in the IP stack where we need to adapt the normal IP behavior: forwarding, transport and applications. Each is discussed below.\n\nOn the Internet, an IP forwarder (or router) drops packets when the destination is seen unreachable in its forwarding table and therefore sends an ICMP destination unreachable error message to the source. However, in space, given that orbital relays will have regular disconnections, the packets should not be dropped but instead stored temporarily until the communication is re-established. One should note that this storage behavior can be accomplished either at the lower levels as today, or at the IP layer, depending on the deployment model.\n\nThe temporary storage of IP packets was implemented easily (200 lines of C code) in a prototype using the Linux Tun interface and a simulation showed [DEEPSPACEIPTESTBED] that it was able to store packets during a link interruption and that packets were then pull from storage and forwarded when the link becomes up again.\n\nAs noted in [RFC4838], the TCP transport is not suitable for deep space. While QUIC was not designed for space use, it can be profiled to support that use case. QUIC is a modern transport and has many features very useful for space. It uses a single round-trip time (RTT) for establishing a secure and encrypted connection between two peers, while TCP and TLS require multiple RTTs. The connection can carry an unlimited number of requests and answers, named streams, without having to re-establish the connection itself, while TCP would require multiple connections. Any peer can start a new stream. It supports the re-establishment of a connection with data in the payload of the first packet, a feature named 0RTT. There is no a priori expiration of a connection, so it can remain opened for minutes, hours, days, weeks, months or even years which is well suited for space. A deployment scenario could be to even establish the connection before the spacecraft leaves Earth and keep the connection for the whole duration of the mission.\n\nIf the spacecraft changes its network attachment, as when a cruising spacecraft is landing on a planet and attaches to the surface network, the spacecraft will receive a new IP address or range. QUIC solves the mobility problem because there is a security association between the two peers and because of its non-dependence on IP address and port to identify the connection The connection is re-established even when the IP address or port changes, supporting full mobility.\n\nAs a reliable transport, QUIC automatically manages issues in networks such as packet reordering, duplication and loss.\n\nHowever, the typical QUIC behavior for Internet assumes short delays in the order of hundred milliseconds and relative full-time connectivity. Therefore, it does not work as is for deep space. However, by setting a few of its transport configuration parameters and implementing a simpler congestion control mechanism, it works well in deep space conditions.\n\nIn a simulation testbed, sending an HTTP request to Voyager and getting the response was successfully demonstrated [DEEPSPACEIPTESTBED]. Not that the real Voyager received the packet, but the one-way delay in the simulation was 18 hours. Another successful simulation took this further by having a 5-day one-way delay (10 days RTT). Various conditions such as packet reordering, duplication and loss have also been simulated.\n\nIt should be noted that another transport protocol, User Datagram Protocol (UDP), works just fine in deep space, since it has no notion of time. It is, however, unreliable. Various protocols such as SNMP, NTP, SIP, RTP, RTSP are using UDP, therefore are candidates to work in deep space. SNMP, the traditional network management framework, was tested and worked just fine [DEEPSPACEIPTESTBED], since the protocol itself has no notion of time. One has to only set the requester timeout to be larger than the expected round-trip time.\n\nThe third important aspect of IP in deep space rely on the application layer itself. If the application uses HTTP, the HTTP protocol itself does not have any notion of time. Only clients, servers and applications usually have timeouts that should be adjusted to values of the expected round-trip time. Any application in deep space must be designed completely asynchronously (as it is also the best current practice for Internet applications nowadays). It must also contain either no timeouts or have timeouts set properly related to the expected round-trip time.\n\nThe reassessment of IP in deep space also covers other topics such as routing, naming, network management and media, but are not covered here for brevity. Figure 3 shows the resulting deep space IP stack."
