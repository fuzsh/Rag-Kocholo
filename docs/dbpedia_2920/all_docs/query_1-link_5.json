        "meta_description": "CubeL is the first COTS cubesat to be operated by the German Space Operations Center (GSOC) utilizing cubesat space protocol (CSP). Scheduled for launch in summer 2020, it will initially be monitored and controlled via UHF using a compatible COTS ground segment to perform an IOD of “OSIRIS4CubeSat”, a miniaturized OSIRIS space-to-ground laser communication terminal developed by DLR-KN in cooperation with Tesat-Spacecom. Afterwards, CubeL will be integrated into the GSOC multi-mission environment and be operated via S-Band. The GSOC ground segment architecture and software focuses on institutionally standardized communication, such as CCSDS frame (132.0-B-2) and packet standards (133.0-B-1) and the ECSS packet utilization standard (E-ST-70-41C). At the core of GSOC's multi-mission environment is the SCOS-2000 based monitoring and control system “GECCOS”, which supports all satellite missions currently operated by GSOC. CubeL however depends on CSP for most communication. This page briefly introduces the CubeL mission and ground segment design, presents relevant protocols and the subsequent tailoring of CCSDS protocol features before describing the required CSP to CCSDS adapter, to enable communication between CubeL and GECCOS. For concept validation a minimal prototype is tested against the CubeL engineering model. This work concludes with a critical review of the chosen approach.",
