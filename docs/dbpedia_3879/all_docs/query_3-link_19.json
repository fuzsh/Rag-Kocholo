        "text": "Irwin Allen was a Hollywood producer, director, screenwriter, show host, and journalist with over half a decade of experience in the film industry. He understood storytelling, the media, and cinema. He also knew talent when he saw it in the performers of classic Hollywood.\n\nHe worked on the sets of feature films, TV series, TV movies, and TV mini-series. The man was responsible for producing four sci-fi shows: Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, Lost in Space, The Time Tunnel, and Land of the Giants. Here are 10 interesting facts about a few of his productions.\n\n1 – Allen’s Most-Used TV Show Actors\n\nIn the 1960’s, Irwin Allen produced and created four different sci-fi/fantasy series. Many of the series employed well-known TV actors and actresses of the time. But several of these were more common than most. For example, Michael Ansara, Kevin Hagen, and Torin Thatcher were actors who appeared in guest roles in all four of Allen’s classic sci-fi TV shows.\n\n2 – Burgess Meredith’s Appearances in Allen’s TV Movies\n\nBurgess Meredith is probably best known for portraying the crooked character of the Penguin in the comical (as well as comic-based) Batman TV show of the 1960’s. He is also known for his frequent guest roles in The Twilight Zone as well as the recurring role of trainer Mickey Goldmill in the first four Rocky movies. Some of Meredith’s lesser-known work includes acting in a number of Irwin Allen’s later TV productions including The Return of Captain Nemo, Outrage, and When Time Ran Out.\n\n3 – Composer John Williams and Allen Had An Amazing Relationship\n\nThe world-renowned film composer/conductor John Williams worked extensively with Allen on several of his shows and even on two big disaster films which would be what got Allen his name in Hollywood popularity. Williams composed the main themes for three of Allen’s sci-fi series including Lost in Space. This work would prepare him for his later work on such epic films as Star Wars, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and E.T. It is being said that Williams is returning to tweak his original Lost in Space scores for the rebooted Netflix series!\n\n4 – Series Stars Playing Guest Roles in the Other Series\n\nMain stars of one Irwin Allen sixties series often got to play guest roles in at least one of his other series. For instance, June Lockhart of Lost in Space made a guest appearance in the Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea episode “The Ghost of Moby Dick.” And Richard Basehart of Voyage provided the voice of a Shakespearian narrator on one of Penny Robinson’s tapes in the Lost in Space episode “The Derelict.”\n\nJonathan Harris of Lost in Space played in the Land of the Giants episode “Pay the Piper.” Del Monroe, a regular cast member on Voyage played one of those silver aliens in The Time Tunnel. And Whit Bissel (Gen. Kirk in Time Tunnel) showed up on Voyage in “The Peacemaker.”\n\n5 – Those Familiar Dinosaurs from The Lost World\n\nIn 1960, Allen’s feature film The Lost World hit theaters. Based on Arthur Conan Doyle’s novel of the same title, the film was costly but also successful overall. The movie was a classic retelling which included elements of danger, greed, revenge, and surprise. It employed reptilians with fake frills and horns attached to them to portray the dinosaurs. Allen used stock footage in his shows constantly and without shame. It turns out, he was able to incorporate scenes of the dinosaurs from The Lost World into all four of his sci-fi shows.\n\n6 – Michael Rennie’s Parts in Allen’s Productions\n\nMichael Rennie was a fabulous film and television actor. He portrayed Peter the Apostle in The Robe (based on the novel by Lloyd C. Douglas) and its Hollywood sequel Demetrius and the Gladiators. However, what he is most remembered for is the sci-fi cult classic The Day the Earth Stood Still, a movie with perhaps the most bizarre and eerie soundtrack of any Hollywood film. He is the lead star and portrays an alien named Klaatu.\n\nHe went on to have a large part in Allen’s The Lost World. Following this role, Rennie played yet another humanoid alien in Allen’s Lost in Space series. He plays the main alien in the only two-parter episode of the series, “The Keeper.” And he plays the Keeper himself. Soon he went to have a big role appearing the pilot episode of The Time Tunnel. In an age decades before the well-known movie The Titanic, Allen’s pilot episode thrusts the two main characters back in time. They happen to land aboard the Titanic, a vessel whose maiden voyage turned into a historical tragedy. Rennie plays the stern captain of this doomed ship.\n\n7 – Allen Seemed to Love Jules Verne’s Fantasies\n\nSo many films are based on bestselling novels these days. Back in Allen’s time there was a genre of literature referred to as “the classics.” And Verne’s works were among the classics. Jules Verne was a brilliant and imaginative French author of over 60 novels. Several of his better-known tales have had screen adaptations. His novels that have been turned into films include The Mysterious Island, Around the World in Eighty Days, and Master of the World.\n\nAllen must have been fond of Verne’s storytelling for one of his films was a 1962 adaptation of Verne’s novel Five Weeks in a Balloon. (Verne had somewhat of an uncanny fascination for hot air balloons and other flying contraptions. But in his defense, the hot air balloon was invented by the Frenchmen.) Allen would go on to produce a 1978 mini-series featuring perhaps Verne’s most famous fictional character – Nemo. It was entitled The Return of Captain Nemo.\n\nIrwin Allen even seemed to try to copy a few of Verne’s techniques. Disney had produced a film version of Verne’s submarine action novel 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea in 1954. When Allen created his own submarine film in 1961 he included several of the same plot developments. He even cast Peter Lorre, who had played a scientist’s assistant in the Disney film, to play a scientist assisting another scientist in his movie. The original trailer for the film went so far as to state the “mind of Jules Verne” could not dream of such a fantastic adventure! You can read slightly more in-depth about the similarities between Disney’s 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and Allen’s Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea here.\n\n8 – Irwin Allen Employed the Star Trek Composer Prior to Star Trek\n\nNext to John Williams and Jerry Goldsmith, one of the best TV composers around in the 1960’s was Alexander Courage. Courage did extensive work including some main themes for the Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea TV series. He also did some special scores for Lost in Space. He went on to compose the main themes for Star Trek: The Original Series. And the theme has been used in nearly every Star Trek film and series since then.\n\n9 – Voyage May Have Been Allen’s Most Successful Endeavor\n\nIrwin Allen’s Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea TV series was based on his 1961 feature film of the same title. It was Allen’s first TV series and his most successful. It ran for four seasons adding up to 110 episodes. One of Season 2’s episodes was entitled “The Sky’s On Fire,” and its screenplay was taken from that of the original film. So it follows the same general premise including the Van Allen belts catching on fire.\n\n10 – Allen’s Wife In Show Biz\n\nOther than portraying Fanny Tatum in a few episodes of The Waltons, it seems the acting career of Sheila Matthews Allen was based primarily around her husband’s producing career. She appeared in Lost in Space, Voyage, Land of the Giants and other film and TV productions by Irwin Allen. In her later years, she herself even turned to producing. She is responsible for helping produce the 2002 TV remake of The Time Tunnel."
