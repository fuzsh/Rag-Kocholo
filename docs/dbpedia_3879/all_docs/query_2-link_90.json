        "text": "If I was producing a science fiction show, I doubt I'd be too inclined to check out other science fiction TV shows for either business or pleasure. If they did something really stupid, you'd just say, \"Oh God, why did they do that?\" If they did something really cool, you'd say, \"Damn, why didn't we do that?\" So there's no real upside.\n\nEven less so if you have to worry about inadvertent plagiarism. It's remarkably easy for an idea to get lodged in your brain without remembering the source of it. You could watch a show, forget about it, and then a year later a cool story pops into your head fully-formed -- one that you've forgotten you watched a season before.\n\nUntil LIS went campy at really the start of the color episodes, it was much grittier and more mature. For me I enjoyed those episodes.\n\nIt was never gritty or mature. It was played more straight in the first season, but it was always a family show, meant to be enjoyed by children and their parents, and the Robinsons were as clean-cut and wholesome as the Cleavers. \"Gritty\" is a word that gets tossed around a lot and used to mean a lot of different things, but it basically means something like realistic, unsentimental, hard-edged, acknowledging the rough and uncomfortable aspects of life or the ugly, imperfect details. I don't think that describes LiS much at all. It was a very sentimental show, and though the first season did try to tell stories about the challenges of survival in space, it did so in a fairly lightweight manner, with everyone ending up okay at the end and nothing really horrible happening.\n\nI imagine with Irwin Allen producing the number of shows he was (not sure if he was also doing movies then as well) but it would seem to me regardless of TOS's popularity, he wouldn't have given it much thought. I suspect he was both too busy and generating a more than decent income flow. His shows were popular and enough demand to pump them out. You can't fault his creativity and business sense.\n\nI doubt he would've seen ST as very threatening. He was a successful TV mogul with multiple shows on the air; when you thought sci-fi television, you thought Irwin Allen. This Roddenberry guy was an upstart trying to horn in on his turf, and his show constantly struggled in the ratings -- although it did get the sort of critical acclaim Allen's shows didn't. I'm not sure that would've mattered to Allen much, though. If he'd cared about quality, his shows wouldn't have been so shlocky.\n\nLost in Space was doomed from the start. CBS wanted a light family show. The first, more serious and grim episodes never had a network rerun. The kids weren't permitted to be shown in danger and Smith was lightened up from the second episode. You can see the show evolve by the episode. A real shift occurred about midway, once the weekly aliens showed up. Long before the show hit color, they were dealing with Space Hillbillies, and Gilligan's Island style visitors who would come and go and never offer to help. Long before color, Dr. Smith was in unexplainable outfits, screaming like a little girl and fainting. The show was \"camp\" almost from the start. Definitely got much lighter from the sixth episode on, when Warren Oates arrived as a good ol' boy astronaut in a dinky like spaceship. When it hit color, after a half season of being directly opposite the first part of the weekly two-part Batman, they went to all out comedy, sprinkled with moments of drama and adventure. By the time the second season was winding down, they were doing Children's Theater. But, really, only the first five episodes were really steadfastly serious.\n\nIrwin Allen did what the networks wanted. Notice none of his other shows went in that extreme. They were on ABC, where fantasy adventure was presented with a straight face. Still flighty and, as Christopher says, \"schlock,\" but not sitcomy as LIS had become. None of Irwin's shows remained the way he originally presented them. Voyage held out longest, lasting a year and a half before truly falling into the pattern of monsters and stock footage. Time Tunnel changed two-thirds of the way through it's single season and Land of the Giants wrestled with its dead end concept as seriously as possible until finally lapsing into weird fantasy in its second season."
