Fox were eventually persuaded to fund around half of the estimated production costs and Irwin brought in his friends Sherrill Corwin and Steve Broidy to fund the rest. Corwin later worked with Irwin Allen for Viva Knievel and had an executive producer credit.\n\nThe Poseidon Adventure principal filming took place between 27 March and 11 July 1972 (a total of 70 days).\n\nSeveral scenes were filmed aboard the ocean liner the Queen Mary which now resides at Long Beach in California. These include the scene of Eric Shea climbing up to the bridge in the storm, Red Buttons jogging along the deck, the communal area and corridor outside Rogo's stateroom, the sermon on the deck, and John Crawford in the engine room.\n\nMuch of the filming took place on the Twentieth Century Fox stages B, 6, 14 and the moat for the water sequences.\n\nGene Hackman's brother Richard worked on The Poseidon Adventure as a stunt coordinator.\n\nJack Albertson appeared twice in Land of the Giants.\n\nThe filming minature of the Poseidon can be viewed at the San Pedro Maritime Museum in Los Angeles county.\n\nStuntman Dick Durock who appears as a passenger in the overturned ship was a stunt double for Guy Williams in Lost in Space.\n\nMany of the passengers on the Poseidon also enjoyed a well cooked (okay, burnt) dinner at the top of The Towering Inferno. See how many people you can spot in both movies.\n\nStuntman Robert Prohaska was the son of Janos Prohaska who appeared as monsters and gorillas in Irwin Allen's TV series. They were both tragically killed in a plane crash on 13th March 1974 in California whilst working on a TV project for ABC Television.\n\nThe President of the United States (Norman Stevans from The Return of Captain Nemo) appears as one of the passengers following the doctor in the overturned ship.\n\nTony Regan also played the scientist in the Land of the Giants episode The Weird World.\n\nSong writing partnership Al Kasha and Joel Hirschhorn won their first Academy Award for the song \"The Morning After\".\n\nSeveral clips from The Poseidon Adventure feature as a phobia in the Sky Arts Playhouse Presents episode \"The Cruise\" with Jane Horrocks and Jason Watkins. Includes clips of Paul Stader as the ship overturns, Ernie Orsatti's stunt fall, and the ship overturning.\n\nBehind the Scenes\n\nSelection of storyboards from The Poseidon Adventure\n\nShooting Schedule for The Poseidon Adventure\n\nWe thought researchers of The Poseidon Adventure would find the above selection of storyboards and shooting schedule pages useful.
