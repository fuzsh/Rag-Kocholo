        "text": "American film producer\n\nNot to be confused with Irwin Allen.\n\nIrving Allen (born Irving Applebaum, November 24, 1905 – December 17, 1987) was an Austro-Hungarian–born American theatrical and cinematic producer and director.[1]\n\nHe received an Academy Award in 1948 for producing the short movie Climbing the Matterhorn. In the early 1950s, he formed Warwick Films with partner Albert \"Cubby\" Broccoli and relocated to England to leverage film making against a subsidy offered by the British government. Through the 1950s, they each became known as one of the best independent film producers of the day, as the two men would sometimes work in tandem, but more often than not on independent projects for their joint enterprise producing multiple projects in a given year.[citation needed]\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nBorn in Lemberg (Austro-Hungary), Allen entered the film industry as an editor at Universal, Paramount and Republic in 1929. During the 1940s, he made a sequence of shorts, including the Academy Award-nominated Forty Boys and a Song (1941), which he directed.[2] His short films often won more acclaim than his low-budget features. In the late 1940s, Allen started concentrating more fully on being a producer.\n\nWarwick Films\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the early 1950s, he led Warwick Films as the 'name producer', making films in both the US and England, with Albert R. Broccoli something of a junior partner. In 1957–1958, his partnership with Broccoli was strained both by Broccoli's family health crises (his second wife became terminally ill, soon after adopting one child and with a newborn) and to a lesser extent their disagreement over the film potential of the James Bond novel series. Broccoli was very interested, believing the novels could lead to a high quality series of films, and Allen was not, eschewing the potential of Broccoli's vision of Bond in favor of older established forms. The partners met with Bond author Ian Fleming separately in 1957, Cubby from New York where he'd retreated to care for his wife, but in the London meeting with Fleming arranged by Broccoli, Allen all but insulted Fleming, declaring that Fleming's novels weren't even \"good enough for television\". Broccoli mired in his troubles in New York, only knew that no deal had occurred until pre-production meetings with Fleming which resulted in the decision to make the Dr. No, as the first film project by Eon Productions.\n\nIn 1959, captivated by the historical importance and a good script Warwick undertook the risky project of producing, funding, and distributing The Trials of Oscar Wilde, which was released in 1960. Ahead of the times, its frank unprejudiced depiction of homosexual issues ran into a ratings stone wall in the United States all but preventing any sort of advertising, and the company lost its large investment, Broccoli and Allen fell out, and the partnership became moribund, being dissolved officially in a 1961 bankruptcy liquidation.\n\nThus the two partners each turned into solo producers in late 1960. Broccoli went on to found Danjaq, S.A. and Eon Productions with Harry Saltzman beginning the Bond films on a shoestring budget, and Allen occupied himself with other projects.\n\nMatt Helm\n\n[edit]\n\nSome years later, Allen cast about for his own spy series. He acquired the rights to Donald Hamilton's Matt Helm series. Allen was responsible for the Matt Helm series, The Silencers (1966), Murderers' Row (1966), The Ambushers (1967), and The Wrecking Crew (1969).\n\nIn July 1967, Allen said \"At this stage I\"m only interested in making money. I'm not interested in kudos or getting good reviews - I've had all that. I'm just concerned with getting the greatest number of people into theatres.\"[3] \"I've done practically everything,\" he said. \"There's no place I haven't been in the business. The only thing I can't do is write.\"[3]\n\nAllen's Helm series had one major effect on Broccoli's Bond movies (produced at the time in partnership with Harry Saltzman). To get Dean Martin on board as Matt Helm, Allen had to make the actor a partner in the enterprise. Dean Martin ended up making more money on The Silencers (1966) than Sean Connery made on Thunderball (1965). This did not go unnoticed by Connery.\n\nAllen was buried at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood, California.\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nForty Boys and a Song (documentary, 1941) - director\n\nAvalanche (1946) - director\n\nStrange Voyage (1946) - director\n\nClimbing the Matterhorn (documentary, 1947) - director, producer\n\nHigh Conquest (1947) - director, producer\n\n16 Fathoms Deep (1948) - director, producer\n\nChase of Death (short, 1949) - director, producer\n\nThe Man on the Eiffel Tower (1950) - uncredited director, producer\n\nSlaughter Trail (1951) - director, producer\n\nNew Mexico (1951) - producer\n\nThe Return of Gilbert& Sullivan (short, 1951) - director, producer\n\nThe Red Beret (1953) - producer\n\nHell Below Zero (1954) - producer\n\nThe Black Knight (1954) - producer\n\nA Prize of Gold (1955) - executive producer\n\nThe Cockleshell Heroes (1955)\n\nSafari (1956) - producer\n\nApril in Portugal (1956) (short) - producer\n\nOdongo (1956) - executive producer\n\nZarak (1956) - executive producer\n\nThe Gamma People (1956) - executive producer\n\nInterpol/Pickup Alley (1957) - producer\n\nFire Down Below (1957) - producer\n\nHow to Murder a Rich Uncle (1957)\n\nThe Long Haul (1957)\n\nHigh Flight (1957)\n\nA Day in Trinidad (short, 1957) - executive producer\n\nNo Time to Die /Tank Force (1958) - producer\n\nThe Man Inside (1958) - producer\n\nIdol on Parade (1959) - producer\n\nThe Bandit of Zhobe (1959) - producer\n\nKillers of Kilimanjaro (1959) - producer\n\nJazz Boat (1960) - executive producer\n\nThe Trials of Oscar Wilde (1960) - executive producer\n\nIn the Nick (1960) - executive producer\n\nJohnny Nobody (1961) - executive producer\n\nThe Heillions (1961) - executive producer\n\nThe Long Ships (1964) - producer\n\nGenghis Khan (1965) - producer\n\nThe Silencers (1966) - producer\n\nMurderers' Row (1966) - producer\n\nThe Ambushers (1967) - producer\n\nHammerhead (1968) - producer\n\nThe Wrecking Crew (1968) - producer\n\nThe Desperados (1969) - producer\n\nCromwell (1970) - producer\n\nEyewitness (1970) - executive producer\n\nMatt Helm (TV series, 1975) - executive producer\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
