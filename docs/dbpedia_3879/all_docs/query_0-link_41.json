        "text": "Before he took us on a \"Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea\" and let us go through \"The Time Tunnel\" to a \"Towering Inferno\". Producer, Director, and Writer, Irwin Allen, told us about his Dark Fantasy Science Fiction, \"THE STORY OF MANKIND\"!\n\nIrwin O. Cohen was born on June 12, 1916, in New York City. Cohen first attended and graduated from \"City College of New York\", and afterwards, moved to \"Columbia University\". He majored in Journalism and Advertising, until \"The Great Depression\" caused him to drop out like many a young American, over financial difficulties, being unable to continue to pay his tuition.\n\nWith a change in name, Irwin Allen, arrived in Hollywood in 1938. Many websites agree that he went to work that year as the editor of the tourist magazine \"Key Magazine\". The one website that seems to disagree, is \"Key Magazine's\", because according to the magazine their first Los Angeles issue wasn't until sometime during the 1940's.\n\nhttps://www.keymagazine.com/\n\nWe can confirm from the website, \"The Irwin Allen News Network\", that in 1941, Allen became a publicist for some of the movie studios and was able to produce a radio program on Los Angeles station KMTR, that would become KLAC in 1946.\n\nThe Irwin Allen Show was a regular radio show produced and presented by Irwin Allen from the early 1940s to the early 1950s. In each show Irwin interviewed celebrities, went behind the scenes at movie productions, and discussed the arts. The show fitted in well with his media column in newspapers. The Irwin Allen Show (also sometimes referred to as Hollywood Merry-Go-Round) was broadcast at various times of the day (even midnight some weeks), and usually on a Sunday. It was initially broadcast on the station KMTR which was later (12 March 1946) sold and renamed to KLAC on 570 on the broadcasting dial.\n\nhttps://www.iann.net/irwinallenshow/\n\nAllen's, \"Hollywood Insider\", newspaper column, was syndicated in 73-newspapers.\n\nDuring those late 1940's, Irwin Allen logically become a \"Talent Agent\", as a result of both his radio program and newspaper column's interactions with would be celebrities and the motion picture studios.\n\nIn 1950, talent agent Allen, put together a package that consisted of a director, some of the actors, and a writer, and sold it to Howard Hughes, the owner of the motion picture studio that was founded by the \"Radio-Keith-Orpheum-Corporation (RKO)\".\n\nThe package became the film-noir, \"Where Danger Lives\", released on July 8, 1950. Irwin Allen received his first motion picture credit as \"Associate Producer\", under RKO's contract producer, Irving Cummings.\n\nAllen followed \"Where Danger Lives\", as the uncredited \"associate producer\", on 1951's, \"Double Dynamite\", a musical comedy, starring Howard Hughes' current girlfriend, Jane Russell, Groucho Marx, and Frank Sinatra. Next, Irwin Allen was shown as the sole producer of a Groucho Mark comedy with William Bendix, 1952's, \"A Girl in Every Port\".\n\nBEFORE there was either \"THE SEAVIEW\", or the \"S.S. POSEIDON\", Irwin Allen traveled under the oceans of the world.\n\nRACHEL L. CARSON'S THE SEA AROUND US released on July 7, 1953\n\nRachel Louise Carson was an Aquatic Biologist for the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, and a Conservationist, and Writer. Her 1962 book, \"Silent Spring\", became a bestseller about the dangers of pesticides, speaking to the aerial spraying of DDT on crops, that she said led to American deaths as a result of eating food from those same crops. Carson was able to get President John F. Kennedy's administration to realize that danger and stop the use of DDT. Her work would move into President Richard M. Nixon's administration and resulted in Nixon creating the \"Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\".\n\nBack in 1951, Rachel Carson published her second book, and the second part of what would become known as \"The Sea Trilogy\", the bestselling \"The Sea Around Us\". The book remained on the \"New York Times Best Seller List\" for 86-weeks.\n\nThe website, \"Literary Ladies Guide\", has a review of \"The Sea Around Us\", by Nava Atlas, dated August 20, 2022. https://www.literaryladiesguide.com/book-reviews/the-sea-around-us-by-rachel-carson-1951/\n\nNava writes:\n\nThe Sea Around Us remains as fresh today as when it first appeared over six decades ago. Carson’s genius for evoking the power and primacy of the world’s bodies of water, combining the cosmic and the intimate, remains almost unmatched: the newly formed Earth cooling beneath an endlessly overcast sky …The seas sustain human life and imperil it.\n\nToday, with the oceans endangered by the dumping of medical waste and ecological disasters such as the Exxon oil spill in Alaska, the gradual death of the Great Barrier Reef, and the melting of the polar ice caps,\n\nCarson’s book provides a timely reminder of both the fragility and the centrality of the ocean and the life that abounds within it. Anyone who loves the sea, or who is concerned about our natural environment, will want to read, or re-read, this classic work.\n\nIrwin Allen Produced, Directed, and Wrote the descriptive dialogue for his filmed documentary version of Carson's 1951 book, \"The Sea Around Us\".\n\nRachel Carson was hired by \"RKO\" as a consultant only on the choice of the film footage used by Allen. She had no input on his screenplay, or the direction he was going to use to tell her book's story.\n\nIn fact, Irwin Allen took Carson's focus on the ecosystems in the world's oceans and their potential impact on the future environment, which had made the book a best seller. Then, turned the focus around, to how valuable the sea is as a source of food for man.\n\nAbove, Irwin Allen and an unidentified assistant inspect film footage for the documentary.\n\nAt the \"25th Academy Awards Ceremonies\", March 19, 1953, Irwin Allen received the \"Oscar for Best Documentary\". Apparently, not one of the members of the Academy had read Carson's best seller, or if they did, missed Rachel Carson's poetic plea to save the oceans before they're gone that was completely lost by Allen.\n\nLater, Rachel Carson was approached to sell the rights to her other works for motion picture documentaries, but refused over what Irwin Allen had done with \"The Sea Around Us\".\n\nCesar Romero portrayed a \"Spanish Envoy to Queen Elizabeth's Court\". The 6'3'' Cesar Julio Romero, Jr. was a New York City born boy that joined the United States Coast Guard during the Second World War, between 1943 and 1947. He portrayed on-screen in supporting roles until 1935's, \"The Devil is a Woman\", co-starring with Marlene Dietrich and Lionel Barrymore, that was directed by Josef von Sternberg. In 1939, Romero took over for Warner Baxter in the title role of \"The Cisco Kid and the Lady\". That same year he portrayed \"Doc Holiday\", opposite Randolph Scott's \"Wyatt Earp\", in \"Frontier Marshall\", the second sound picture about \"The Gunfight at the O.K. Corral\". The screenplay would be reworked by director John Ford with Victor Mature in the role, as 1946's, \"My Darling Clementine\". Other work, found Romero in the 1951, science fiction film, \"The Lost Continent\", and from 1954 through 1958, the actor starred in the long-forgotten television series \"Passport to Danger\". He would appear in four episodes of Walt Disney's \"Zorro\", and of course, became television's \"The Joker\", in 22-episodes of \"Batman\" and in the movie version of the television series. Cesar Romero also co-starred in Japanese movie studio, Toho's, science fiction feature, 1969, \"Latitude Zero\".\n\nAbove, Marie Windsor and Dennis Hopper.\n\nMarie Wilson portrayed \"Marie Antoinette\". Katherine Elizabeth Wilson was a radio, film, and television actress. She is best remembered for portraying scatterbrained \"Irma Peterson\", first on the radio program, \"My Friend Irma\", April 11, 1947 through August 23, 1954. Next, in the 1949 motion picture, \"My Friend Irma\", and again in the 1950 movie, \"My Friend Irma Goes West\", along with the television series, \"My Friend Irma\", 1952 through 1954. Speak to type-casting!\n\nOf course, if you're a child of the 1960's, you recognize Horton's voice as the narrator for the \"Fractured Fairy Tales\", on \"Rocky and Bullwinkle\", 1959 through 1963.\n\nAbove, Edward Everett Horton is on the far right.\n\nReginald Gardiner portrayed \"William Shakespeare\". William Reginald Gardiner first appeared on-screen as a \"Dancer\" in director Alfred Hitchcock's, 1927, \"The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog\", his silent Jack the Ripper movie. That unnoticeable career start would lead to supporting roles in 1938's, \"Marie Antoinette\", starring Nora Shearer and Tyrone Power, 1940's, \"The Great Dictator\", starring Charlie Chaplin, the Bette Davis, Ann Sheridan, and Monte Wooley, 1942, \"The Man Who Cam to Dinner\", the Henry Fonda and Maureen O'Hara, 1943, the Immortal Sergeant\", 1946's, \"Cluny Brown\", starring Charley Boyer, and Jennifer Jones, and 1948's, \"Fury at Furnace Creek\", starring Victor Mature and Coleen Gray, among other films and television appearances.\n\nCathy O'Donnell portrayed \"An Early Christian Woman\". Ann Steely was born in Siluria, Alabama, and in 1946, under her on-screen name, appeared in director William Wyler's highly acclaimed motion picture about returning Second World War vets, \"The Best Years of Our Lives\". O'Donnell's role was the high school sweetheart, \"Wilma Cameron\", of Navy vet, \"Homer Parrish\", portrayed by real-life, double amputee, Harold Russell. In 1950, she was 5th-billed in the sequel to \"Mrs. Miniver\", \"The Miniver Story\", again starring Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon. While in 1951, O'Donnell was 4th-billed in William Wyler's hard hitting \"Detective Story\", starring Kirk Douglas, Eleanor Parker, and William Bendix, and in 1959, she played Charlton Heston's sister in William Wyler's \"Ben Hur\". Cathy O'Donnell, by that time was married to William's older brother Robert Wyler.\n\nAbove, Henry Danielle listens to Hedy Lamarr's \"Joan of Arc\".\n\nNick Cravat portrayed the \"Devil's Apprentice\". Nicholas Cuccia, while at a New York summer camp to get boys out of the city environment for a while, met another boy who became his lifelong friend, named Burt Lancaster. The two literally would run away and join the circus and as an acrobatic team appeared together in Lancaster's 1950, \"The Flame and the Arrow\", and 1952's, \"The Crimson Pirate\", considered the model for both actor Johnny Depp's \"Captain Jack Sparrow\" and \"The Pirates of the Caribbean\" series. Cravat also appeared with Lancaster in 1958's, \"Run Silent, Run Deep\". My article, \"Burt Lancaster: Circus Acrobat Turned Actor\", speaks to Nick Cravat and Lancaster's circus performances and films. It can be read at:\n\nhttp://www.bewaretheblog.com/2016/04/burt-lancaster-circus-acrobat-turned.html\n\nAnthony Dexter portrayed \"Christopher Columbus\". Walter Reinhold Alfred Fleischmann resembled silent film idol Rudolph Valentino. In fact, his second on-screen appearance was the lead in producer Edward Small's, 1951, \"Valentino\". Dexter followed that motion picture with title roles in two \"B\" productions, 1953's, \"Captain John Smith and Pocahontas\", opposite Jody Lawrence, and 1954's, \"Captain Kid and the Slave Girl\", opposite Eva Gabor. In 1956, Anthony Dexter was \"Luther Blair\", in the British science fiction film, \"Fire Maidens of Outer Space\", in 1960, he was \"Dr. Luis Vargas\" in the science fiction \"12 to the Moon\", and the following year he was \"Herron\" in another science fiction feature, \"The Phantom Planet\". Starting in 1968, Anthony Dexter spent the next ten-years as a speech and drama teacher at \"Eagle Rock High School\", in Los Angeles.\n\nFrancis X. Bushman portrayed \"Moses\". Francis Xavier Bushman's first on-screen appearance was in a 1912 short, \"My Friend's Wife\". In 1925, the actor asked his friend, cowboy star and owner of half of the Santa Clarita Valley, William S. Hart, about playing a villain in an upcoming feature film. Bushman's image had always been of a good person and he worried about how his fans would react. Hart told him to go for it, and Francis X. Bushman became \"Messala\", opposite Ramon Novarro in title role of Civil War General and Governor of New Mexico, Lew Wallace's \"Ben Hur: A Tale of the Christ\", in one of the masterpieces of the silent era. Bush's career continued until 1966 and he even found himself both in the \"Beach Party\" entry, 1966's, \"The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini\", and on televisions \"Batman\".\n\nThe motion picture was no longer a travelogue and Irwin Allen was not going to 18-countries. In fact, the entire motion picture was shot at \"The Warner Brothers Studios\", 4000 Warner Boulevard, Burbank, California. Filming began on November 12, 1956, not even a full-month after Michael Todd released \"Around the World in 80 Days\". The actual filming ended, and post-production would begin in January 1957.\n\nTo keep the costs down, Allen used a large amount of excess stock footage in \"The Story of Mankind\". Four of these sources came from director Howard Hawks', 1955's, \"Land of the Pharaohs\", director Michael Curtiz's, 1939 Western, \"Dodge City\", director Victor Fleming's, 1948, \"Joan of Arc\", and director Robert Wise's, 1956's, \"Helen of Troy\".\n\nIrwin Allen's screenplay, not the original children's novel, now asks the question:\n\nWill the \"High Tribunal\" prevent the bomb from going off, or should they let the human race face their created fate? A decision to hold mankind on trial is agreed too.\n\nThe tribunal now calls for \"The Spirit of Man\" to defend the human race and \"Mr. Scratch (The Devil)\", who arrives with his apprentice devil, to prosecute the human race.\n\nAbove, Welsh character actor Tudor Owen swears in Ronald Colman and Vincent Price.\n\nThe \"High Judge\" of the tribunal instructs the defense and prosecutor that they may use any person from Earth's history to make their case. The witnesses had been assembled and the \"Spirit of Man\" starts his case by first showing how man developed from a solidary people to communities. That in communities he developed both fire, with its uses for warmth and cooking their food, and created the wheel and that inventions impact.\n\n\"Mr. Scratch\" argues that man's downfall began almost immediately by creating envy and greed. He switches to 26th Century Egypt during the \"Old Kingdom\" and \"Pharaoh Khufu\". \"Scratch\" tells the tribunal that the Pharaoh murdered 100,000 men to build his tomb, the \"Great Pyramid of Giza\", because man in his stupidity, worshipped villains as heroes.\n\nWhile \"The Spirit of Man\" conceded \"Mr. Scratch's\" point, he countered by reminding the prosecutor and the tribunal that the reverse was also true. By bringing up the story of \"Moses\" who led his people to freedom, and gave them \"God's Ten Commandments\" upon Mount Sinai.\n\nThen \"Mr. Scratch\" brings up \"Nero\" and the burning of Rome, claiming the citizens were content with \"Nero's\" abuse of power. \"The Spirit of Man\" counters with Christians martyrs praying to God as Roman soldiers take them to their deaths in the arena. Adding that despite these brutal times, a new hope for man had arrived.\n\n\"Mr. Scratch\" now presents \"Attila the Hun\", whose armies marched against the Pope and organized religion. However, \"The Spirit of Man\" counters with the signing of the \"Magna Carta\", and the legend of \"King Arthur\", showing faith did survive.\n\nAttacking \"The Spirit of Man\", \"Mr. Scratch\" claims the treatment of \"Joan of Arc\" completely disproves his position and he goes on to indict the entire Middle Ages.\n\n\"The Spirit of Man\" again counters by stating that the era gave birth to the Renaissance, a new age of thought, and \"Leonardo da Vinci\".\n\n\"Mr. Scratch\" counters that some of da Vinci's inventions were forerunners of weapons of war, the flying machine, the submarine, and his version of a machine gun made with multiple rifles on a wheel firing each one as it turns.\n\n\"The Spirit of Man\" counters by saying that da Vinci's worked influenced \"Christopher Columbus's\" voyage to the new world.\n\nWhich is immediately countered by \"Mr. Scratch\" reminding \"The Spirit of Man\" how Spanish explorer \"Hernan Cortes (Cortez)\" lead an expedition to the New World that ended with the slaughter of the Aztec Indians, as Spain attempted to rule and terrorize the seas.\n\nSpeaking to the New World, \"Mr. Scratch\" mentions how \"Peter Minuit\" cheated the Indians out of Manhattan Island.\n\n\"Scratch\" adds that the colonies permitted slavery, and in Salem, people were hung and burned at a stake for being witches. Not to forget that \"Sir Walter Raleigh\" introduced tobacco to the \"Old World\" and that the unsanitary conditions throughout Europe created plague.\n\nTo which, \"The Spirit of Man\" counters with the discoveries of medicines and advances in science, mentioning \"Sir Isaac Newton\", the discover of gravity.\n\nNext, \"The Spirit of Man\" adds the story of the American founding fathers building a nation on the principle the all men are created equal. To which, \"Mr. Scratch\" again doubles down by calling to the witness stand, first \"Marie Antoinette\", and next, \"Napoleon Bonaparte\", to illustrate mankind's lust for power and creed.\n\n\"Mr. Scratch\" continues his argument about greed, by leaving Europe for America, and speaking to the land grabbing and gold fever that led to the Indian Wars, and the Civil War pitting brother against brother. \"The Spirit of Man\" argues that out of the American Civil War came \"President Abraham Lincoln's\", played by Austin Green, \"Emancipation Proclamation\".\n\nThe final session of the \"High Tribunal of Outer Space\" is called to session. The \"High Judge\" calls for summations so that the judges can make a determination, as the \"Celestial Clock\" is nearing eleven o'clock and the \"Super H-Bomb\" will explode."
