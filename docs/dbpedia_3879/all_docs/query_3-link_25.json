Before pursuing a career in film and television, Allen turned his eyes towards journalism, graduating from the New York's Columbia School of Journalism and eventually becoming a magazine editor as well as the producer and director of a radio program.

He also created the 1960s science fiction television series The Time Tunnel, as well as Lost in Space and Land of the Giants.\n\nIn the 1970s, Allen returned to film work and became a driving force in the production of a string of disaster films, which became increasingly popular throughout the decade, earning him the nickname \"The Master of Disaster\". Allen produced the successful The Poseidon Adventure and The Towering Inferno, which he also co-directed. He produced several made-for-TV disaster movies including: Flood!, Fire!, Hanging by a Thread, The Night the Bridge Fell Down and Cave In!, both of which were broadcast in 1979. The 1978 films The Swarm and 1979's Beyond the Poseidon Adventure were both released theatrically. In 1980, he produced When Time Ran Out.\n\nIrwin Allen passed away in Santa Monica, California on November 2nd, 1991.\n\nNotes & Trivia[]\n\nMade cameo appearances in three episodes of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. He appeared in \"The Village of Guilt\", \"The Ghost of Moby Dick\" (voice only) and \"The Saboteur\" (voice only).\n\nThe pilot episode of Land of the Giants titled \"The Crash\" takes place on June 12th, Irwin Allen's birthday.\n\n[]\n\nIrwin Allen at Wikipedia\n\nReferences[]\n\nLost in Space Actor or Crew member\n\nThis article relates to actors or production crew members pertaining to the Lost in Space franchise.
