        "text": "Heritage Auction's The Irwin Allen Collection sale on July 29 features storyboards and concept art from some of the producer-director's most popular 1970s disaster movies.\n\n\"Almost none of this has ever been seen by anyone,\" says Ron Hamill, associate producer of the 1995 documentary The Fantasy Worlds of Irwin Allen. \"The storyboards are incredible. It's all the detail. They show exactly what happens on screen, and of course this was all before CGI. And the concept art is fantastic, starting with The Big Circus.\" A lifetime fan of Allen's, he stepped in following Allen's death in 1991 to help gather and organize Allen's material legacy, which was spread across his production studios and homes."
