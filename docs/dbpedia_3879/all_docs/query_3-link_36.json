        "text": "FAQ\n\nQuestion: Are any of the Irwin Allen shows available on video/DVD?\n\nAnswer: Yes, Lost in Space, Land of the Giants, Time Tunnel, and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, the documentaries The Fantasy Worlds of Irwin Allen (DVD) and Lost in Space Forever (DVD), and many of the movies are available...Check out all the Internet video sites and use the search engines for more details. Land of the Giants, Time Tunnel, and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea have also been released on DVD in the UK.\n\nQuestion: How much is this collectible worth?\n\nWe get a lot of enquiries asking about the value of different Irwin Allen collectibles. If you are planning on spending over $100 on a collectible, we recommend researching the prices the item has previously sold at as this will provide the most accurate valuation of an object. For past Ebay \"Sold\" prices, a good source of information is the subscription service at the Worthpoint Worthopedia. If you notice items sitting unsold on Ebay for many weeks then it is very likely that the items have been over priced, sometimes many times over what they would normally sell for. Purchasing over-valued items means that it will be much harder to sell those items later on and that likely to make a significant loss on the investment. The hardest items to estimate the value for are the one-off items like original props, so the price these will sell at auction for will depend on whether there are multiple bidders willing to pay whatever it costs. The best guide for one-off item values is to find out what similar items from the genre sold for.\n\nOver the past few years we have been collating a list of sold prices for original 1960's toys and collectibles. If you are looking for information on a particular Irwin Allen collectible, we are happy to help if we can. Our research is by no means complete, but it provides a good guide for what items have been selling for. For big ticket items, it would be advisable to seek advice from a reputable antiques dealer or auction house. Remember that an item is only worth what someone is prepared to pay for it.\n\nIf you are unsure about whether a collectible is original or not, it is worth checking the licensing information on the item. All licensed toys and collectibles will have verifiable licensing, date and copyright information on them. There are a lot of goods appearing online that aren't original or licensed so again, it is worth researching any intended purchase before spending a lot of money on it.\n\nQuestion: Is there going to be a Land of the Giants movie?\n\nAnswer: There have been a number of initiatives over the past couple of decades, including scripts by Gary Conway, Don Marshall and Deanna Lund, and there is interest in a movie. Whether these things will get off the ground depends on financing and interest from potential viewers. Note that there was a successful Lost in Space movie with a different cast (some original cast members had cameo roles).\n\nQuestion: Where can publishers obtain photographs for articles and books?\n\nAnswer: Pictures can be licensed through the Motion Picture and Television Photo Archive. Visit the Irwin Allen Vaults for details.\n\nQuestion: Is there going to be a Time Tunnel or Voyage movie?\n\nAnswer: There is always talk of these things, but no concrete plans at the moment for Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. A lot depended on the success of the Lost in Space movie. A TV movie for The Time Tunnel was produced but never aired (it can be found on one of the Time Tunnel DVD sets) and another Time Tunnel pilot is currently in production (watch news pages for details).\n\nQuestion: What are the cast members doing these days?\n\nAnswer: The IANN site contains a number of pages with news and information on the Irwin Allen actors:\n\nQuestion: Can I write to or get autographs from any of the actors and actresses?\n\nAnswer: The best place to get autographs is to attend conventions where they appear. You can also get photos via addresses given on some of the actor web sites. Please note that we cannot give out any individual addresses and cannot forward any mail.\n\nQuestion: Are any conventions planned in my area?\n\nAnswer: Any news we get on conventions will appear in our conventions list. If any large scale TV or Sci-Fi conventions are held in your area, ask them if they'd consider inviting Irwin Allen guests (noting that fees and/or expenses may be required to secure attendance of guests).\n\nQuestion: Can you give me the contact details of one of the actors etc?\n\nAnswer: We're not able to give out any private contact details of any of the performers, crew, or fans. The best place to meet and chat with the actors is to get to one of the signings or conventions that they occasionally go to. Visit the respective convention pages for more information on upcoming events.\n\nCAN YOU HELP\n\nThis is a new section where fans can help each other. If you know the answers to the following questions, please contact us and we will place the questions and answers in the above section (we will include your name with your answer...note, you can request that we use an abbreviated name or nickname)."
