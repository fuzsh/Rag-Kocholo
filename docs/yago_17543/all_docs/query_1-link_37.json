        "text": "Dr. Sultani’s area of focus include neck pain, back pain, hip pain, knee pain, and shoulder pain. He stays up to date with the most innovative treatment options to best care for his patients. He uses a multi-modal approach to taking care of his patients. His expertise is in using minimally invasive procedures to help improve quality of life and eliminate pain. These procedures typically take only a few minutes and are done efficiently in an outpatient setting. He uses various techniques – including medication injections, radiofrequency ablations, and small implantable devices to alleviate pain. Dr. Sultani also specializes in medication management for those patients who are candidates for such therapy.\n\nAs a patient himself, Dr. Sultani understands the difficulties of living with chronic pain. During college, he underwent back surgery for a herniated disk. He went through all the steps to help manage his pain and continues to receive interventional treatment to this day. His personal experience with a back injury motivated him to pursue a career in treating pain.\n\nDr. Sultani speaks English, Spanish and Farsi. For appointments, please call 602-786-0030.\n\nRatings and comments are obtained from verified patient survey data collected on behalf of HonorHealth by a third-party vendor, Press Ganey Associates, Inc. HonorHealth uses Press Ganey’s MD satisfaction surveys to assess patients' experiences with healthcare providers and staff in our Medical Group practices. In order to support full transparency, HonorHealth ensures that the full range of patient comments, both positive and negative, are published.\n\nStar ratings are displayed only for those physicians who participate in HonorHealth’s patient experience survey program through Press Ganey and have received a minimum of 30 surveys responses.\n\nDespite the drive toward full transparency, occasionally some comments cannot be published because they jeopardize the patient’s privacy, contain vulgar or offensive language, or contain libelous or defamatory content. In these rare instances, comment exclusion based on a strict set of exclusion criteria may be appropriate."
