        "text": "By Frud Bezhan\n\nSeptember 9, 2016\n\nRadio Free Europe/Radio Liberty\n\nResistance fighter and anti-Taliban leader Ahmad Shah Masud was killed by Al-Qaeda assassins on September 9, 2001, ushering in a chain of events that would place Afghanistan at the center of the global war on terrorism.\n\nTwo days after his death, Al-Qaeda operatives would carry out the 9/11 terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. Within a month, the United States military was leading a bombing campaign and invasion of Afghanistan with the intention of overthrowing the Taliban and capturing Al-Qaeda leader and 9/11 orchestrator Osama Bin Laden.\n\nIn life and as in death, the military strategist who had made his name as a commander of anti-Taliban forces would have a significant impact on life in Afghanistan. Here are some stories behind the man whose battlefield exploits earned him the moniker “The Lion of Panjshir.”\n\nNorthern Alliance Founder\n\nHe was a key leader of the Northern Alliance, a combination of Afghanistan-based forces that aligned in 1996 to counter the Taliban’s takeover of Kabul. After the U.S-led invasion in October, 2001, those forces would play a key role as a coalition partner until a new government could be formed.\n\nLarger-Than-Life Figure\n\nNumerous books, films, and articles have been written about Masud, and to this day he is revered as a national hero in Afghanistan. Posters of the 48-year-old — wearing his trademark woolen hat, the pakol — still dot the capital, Kabul, where monuments have been erected and streets named in his honor.\n\nCamera Bomb\n\nMasud was killed in Khwaja Bahauddin, a far-flung area in northeast Afghanistan near the Tajikistan border that served as his base of operations.\n\nHis assassins were identified as Abdessater Dahmane and Bouraoui el-Ouaer — two men of Tunisian descent who posed as journalists and traveled on Belgian passports. They killed Masud by setting off a camera bomb as they interviewed Masud in his office.\n\nOne of the attackers died immediately, while the second was shot dead after he attempted to escape. Masud was mortally wounded and died while he was being flown by helicopter to Tajikistan for treatment.\n\nAssassins Spent Time In Molenbeek\n\nThe Al-Qaeda militants who killed him were believed to have transited through the Brussels neighborhood of Molenbeek, which has since become notorious for being home to several suspects linked to recent terrorist attacks in Brussels and Paris.\n\nIn 2005, a court in Paris found four men guilty of offering logistical support to Masud’s killers. The four Islamic militants were sentenced to between two and seven years. Those convicted were captured by French authorities, who traced passports found on Masud’s killers to a Brussels-based militant cell run by Tarek Maaroufi, who was sentenced to six years in prison in 2003.\n\nRevered In Neighboring Tajikistan\n\nMasud, an ethnic Tajik, is widely revered in neighboring Tajikistan. In a sign of his enduring popularity, Masud has become a popular name for boys.\n\nMasud received arms and financial backing from the Tajik government during the Taliban’s rule from 1996-2001. Some of his wounded fighters were taken to hospitals in Tajikistan. Masud’s own stronghold in northeast Afghanistan bordered Tajik territory and he often visited Tajikistan.\n\nAfter his death, Masud’s family briefly moved to Dushanbe, where the family still owns a home. His family eventually moved to Iran.\n\nWarned Of Attack On U.S.\n\n“If President Bush doesn’t help us, these terrorists will damage the U.S. and Europe very soon.”\n\nMasud gave this warning in an address at the European Parliament in Brussels in April, 2001. He also told EU leaders that he had gathered evidence about an imminent terrorist attack by Al-Qaeda on the U.S. homeland.\n\nHis words proved prophetic. Months later, Al-Qaeda operatives hijacked four passenger planes with the intention of flying them into U.S. targets. Two brought down the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York. A third hit the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. The fourth went down in a field in Pennsylvania. Altogether, the attacks claimed the lives of nearly 3,000 people, and injured more than 6,000.\n\nCold Warrior\n\nA 1992 editorial in the Wall Street Journal described Masud as the “Afghan who won the Cold War.”\n\nPanjshir was a bastion of resistance to the 1979-89 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and the last stronghold of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance.\n\nMasud’s Jamiat-e-Islami political party and military wing was the most successful Mujahedin group fighting against the invading Red Army. From his base in the Panjshir Valley, Masud’s men led a successful guerrilla fight against the Soviet forces, which launched several failed operations to claim control of the valley.\n\nPanjshir still bears the scars of Masud’s fight against the Soviet Union and the Taliban. Hundreds of destroyed Soviet tanks are littered throughout the valley, as are weapons left by the Taliban in their failed attempts to conquer the area. Vast tunnel networks are carved into the mountains that the Mujahedin used to escape Soviet and Taliban bombardments, and dozens of mine-clearing operations continue on the rocky hilltops surrounding the picturesque valley.\n\nFrench Connection\n\nMasud spoke some French, having studied at the French-language Lycee Esteqlal school in Kabul, and was admired in France. In 2001, European Parliament President Nicole Fontaine invited Masud to address the parliament.\n\nMasud was also friends with French intellectual Bernard-Henri Levy, who visited Masud in the Panjshir Valley in the 1990s. Masud was known to have said that French President Charles De Gaulle was one of his political heroes.\n\nFrench audiences got to know Masud after the release of a documentary — The Valley Against An Empire — by French journalist Christophe de Ponfilly in 1981, just two years after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan."
