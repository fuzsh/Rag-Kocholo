Masood first rose to fame in the 2030s for his very progressive teachings of Islam, especially for Afghanistan where the Taliban government had enforced a strictly ultraconservative form of Islam as the sole legal religion. Masood's teachings openly opposed the Taliban and preached human rights, equality and tolerance, however this made him the target of numerous attacks by the Taliban and terrorist organizations operating within the country, including in 2038 when Taliban militants stormed his mosque in the northern city of Kunduz during a prayer session, executing many of Masood's followers present at the mosque, although he was not present and fled to Turkmenistan a week later.\n\nFrom Turkmenistan, Masood would continue to operate and preach, later establishing the Front for the Liberation of Afghanistan and calling on his supporters to \"march on Kabul\" in 2044, depose the totalitarian theocratic state that the Taliban had led, and establish a democratic, secularized state. This speech led to a battle between moderate Taliban who had defected to Masood's cause and radical Taliban in Shahjoy District, and when Masood's supporters seized control in Kandahar Province two days later, a civil war began within the country. Masood returned to the country a month later, establishing a government in Kandahar, the second-largest city in the country, and by 2047 had captured most major cities in Afghanistan from the Taliban with the exceptions of Mazar i-Sharif and Jalalabad, even taking Kabul in 2046. However, the moderate factions of the Taliban which had been vital to Masood's war effort would defect back to the Islamic Emirate the following year, and infighting between anti-Taliban resistance would lead to the rapid collapse of his government, leading to the collapse of the National Reform Council in 2049 as Masood went into hiding in Panjshir Province, where he would continue to lead a insurgency that would gradually gain in strength until another civil war broke out in 2057. His brother was kidnapped and murdered by Taliban militants in 2053, while he narrowly escaped a suicide bombing ordered by Taliban leadership in 2054 with his life.\n\nStarting in 2055, Masood's anti-Taliban resistance would gradually began to regain territory in the northeast, eventually taking over the entirety of the mountainous northeast of the country by the end of World War 3 in 2058. Masood's forces would march on his home city of Kunduz in 2060 and 2061, taking the city after much fighting later in 2061. They would then turn their attention south, gradually gaining ground against the Taliban until they eventually took Kabul in 2064. Even as Masood's health continued to decline into 2065, he continued to lead the war effort against the Taliban, quickly clearing resistance in Kandahar and Mazar-i-Sharif by that June, later reaching Herat in October and taking Jalalabad after a protracted siege in November, forcing the Taliban to retreat into a insurgency against Masood's forces, who consolidated their control over Afghanistan. However, Masood himself would not live long to see his desired democratic reforms implemented, passing away in 2066 and being succeeded on an interim status by his son, Elam Diar Masood. In Afghanistan, Masood is widely celebrated, being nicknamed the \"Savior of Democracy\" by many, and he is generally regarded as one of the most influential people in modern Afghan history, especially as his teachings of Islam inspired uprisings against other Middle Eastern states, and his ideological beliefs have occasionally been tagged as \"Elamite socialism\", which is generally considered the most popular and widespread form of socialism in the Arab world, although Masood considered himself a social democrat.\n\nEarly life[]\n\nElam Masood was born on January 6, 2001 into a impoverished family in a small village near Kunduz, Afghanistan. He was the youngest of five siblings, and only a few weeks after he was born his mother passed away from a severe illness that began after his birth. His father had secretly been conducting work for the Northern Alliance in an attempt to undermine Taliban rule in the Kunduz area, and went into hiding when Ahmad Shah Massoud, one of the leaders of the Northern Alliance was assassinated by al-Qaeda militants on September 9, 2001, fearing retribution against him and his family for their role in supporting the Northern Alliance. The family fled into Northern Alliance territory later that month, with it being indicated that the family had resettled in Fayzabad sometime in October or November, with his father leaving his children with his brother upon the onset of the United States invasion of Afghanistan, providing vital intelligence information for American and Northern Alliance troops, especially during the Siege of Kunduz. The family returned to Kunduz some time around 2003 or 2004, and his father was elected into the city government as an independent in 2006. Despite this, his father still couldn't afford to send the young Elam to school, and he turned to his older brother Shuja to teach him to read and write, with the two developing a bond as siblings (compared to Elam's relatively strained relationship with his other siblings) that would last the rest of their lifetime.\n\nOn June 5, 2009, Masood's father, Zafran Masood was murdered by Taliban loyalists in his car, and it was after this point that the young Masood began to turn to religion, sticking with Shuja as the two brothers lived off of what little money that they made selling scrap off the streets in local markets around the city of Kunduz, with the young Elam befriending an Afghan soldier in 2013, with said Afghan soldier attempting to adopt the young Elam and his brother, although this request was denied. Masood and his brother would later become informants for the Afghan government, informing them of suspected pro-Taliban activity in the markets they operated out of, earning a reputation among local police officials for his devotion to assisting them crack down on Taliban activity. He would later find himself in the service of a local mosque by 2019, and attempted to flee Afghanistan with his brother in early August 2021 as the pro-western anti-Taliban government rapidly collapsed under pressure from a massive Taliban offensive, however was turned around less than 30 miles from the border with Turkmenistan. He would spend the next couple of days in hiding until he became confident that the Taliban were not seeking him out, later fully entering religious service while his brother remained a street vendor.\n\nAnti-Taliban resistance, rise to notoriety[]"
