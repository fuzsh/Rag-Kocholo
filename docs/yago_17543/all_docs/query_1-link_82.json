        "text": "Two novels by writer-cultural activist Masud Ahmed namely Bikel Shesher Alo and Pranprapat were launched at Sufia Kamal auditorium of Bangladesh National Museum on Sunday.\n\nNational professor Anisuzzaman was present as the chief guest at the programme.\n\nCEO of Anyaprokash Mazharul Islam and literary critic Shahid Iqbal, among others, were present at the programme.\n\nBikel Shesher Alo is a historical fiction which portrays the political scenario from 1947 to 1971. It revolves around a love story between a Muslim girl and a Hindu boy.\n\nPranprapat portrays human emotions like sadness and frustration and their impact of people’s lives.\n\n‘The novel Bikel Shesher Alo depicts that love cannot be restricted by national borders, religion and others. On the other hand, Pranprapat portrays the evolution of human behaviour over time,’ said professor Anisuzzaman.\n\n‘Bikel Shesher Alo celebrates the triumph of selfless love. Besides, it also depicts historical events. I hope readers will find the novel entertaining,’ said Mazharul Islam.\n\nFollowing the book launch event, classical singer Talat Mahmud entertained the audience presenting solo songs."
