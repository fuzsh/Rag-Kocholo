        "text": "CEDAR MILL -- If you want something done in the greater Portland Muslim community, it's generally understood that you need to call Salma Ahmad.\n\nJOSEFINA 'SALMA' AHMAD\n\nHome:\n\nHartung Farms neighborhood of Cedar Mill\n\nAge:\n\n66\n\nReligion:\n\nSunni Muslim\n\nBorn:\n\nLuzon, Philippines\n\nFamily:\n\nHusband Masud Ahmad, cardiologist; adult son and two daughters, all professionals, and all graduates of Sunset High School\n\nEducation:\n\nBachelor's degree in nursing, 1966\n\nAffiliations:\n\nPresident of the\n\n; founding member of\n\n; Washington County Human Rights Commission; Ecumenical Ministries of Oregon; Interfaith Action Network of Washington County; Center for Intercultural Organizing; Muslim Educational Trust advisory board; Muslim Women's League; Institute of Islamic and Interfaith Studies; Oregon Physicians for Social Responsibility; Human Rights Commission and Police Racial Profiling Committee\n\nOf note:\n\nShe and her husband were born on the same day in 1943; they married on their shared birthday. She met mass murderer Richard Speck at Chicago's Cook County Hospital, where she was once head nurse and where she also met her husband-to-be.\n\nHobby:\n\nObsessive backyard gardening\n\nTravel :\n\nHas been all over the world; next trip is Tunisia and Mongolia because she has always wanted to see a camel with a double hump.\n\n\"How can you say no to Salma?\" she says into the phone with a knowing grin. Her no-nonsense requests are more like orders, as she finds free dental care for Bosnian refugees or tutors for Somali refugees. She persuades fellow members of the Muslim women's guild she founded to participate in walks to benefit the mentally ill and finding a cure breast cancer or to staff the phones for OPB fund-raisers.\n\nThe tiny woman wearing the hijab head covering, a native of the Philippines, is seated at the dining room table of her Cedar Mill home among 25 Oriental carpets. This is the home she has made with her Pakistan-born cardiologist husband, where she raised her three now-grown children.\n\nOver the years, she and her husband became stalwarts and driving forces among the local Muslim community. She stepped up her interfaith and outreach efforts after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The\n\nrecently recognized her for her work with law enforcement, giving her the\n\nat a ceremony last month in Washington, D.C.\n\nAfter Sept. 11, she pushed her fellow Muslims to blend in rather than isolate themselves. \"We were under the microscope,\" she said, \"and it almost became my moral obligation to educate the public about what Islam is all about.\"\n\nThe local Muslim-FBI relationship has been rocky and characterized by mistrust on both sides, she said. \"I really wanted to build a bridge,\" she said. She enrolled in the FBI citizens academy and attended for six weeks, even learning how to shoot an automatic gun.\n\nThings are still not perfect, she acknowledged. But, \"Now they are happy that the dialogue is open. We reached out to them, they reached out to us. It was mutual. We thought by the FBI knowing the Muslim community and our culture and our religion, there would be better communications. They are not our enemies; they are here to protect the country. We have the same goals. The FBI has to realize we also want to protect this country. We live here. We pay our taxes here. We want the best for our children.\"\n\nShahriar Ahmed, a leader at Beaverton's\n\n, said Ahmad's presence was critical: \"We could not make things work. When Salma started engaging with them, things became very different. She is very open and consistent with her simple message. Bridges were being built, people were walking across the bridges. There was even a communal chili dinner.\"\n\nAhmad, 66, was raised Catholic -- her given name is Josefina -- and she moved to Chicago in 1967 after graduating from nursing school. A head nurse at\n\n, she met her Pakistani husband-to-be in 1968. She converted to Islam in 1969, and married in 1970; the couple moved to Portland in 1974 and their three children were born here.\n\nOver the years, her home has become almost a hotel and clearinghouse for visitors. People call her to house visitors from Albania and Indonesia. She has hosted exchange students from all over the world. She hosts a Turkish woman whose husband left her. At their Arch Cape beach home during spring break, she watched \"Band of Brothers\" with two young Mongolian guests. Many people call her \"Mom.\"\n\nShe doesn't mind speaking in churches, senior centers or libraries. But she likes young people best. Her most rewarding work is her involvement in a Humanities project at\n\n. The students ask direct questions: Are you oppressed? Can you drive? Do you have freedom to do what you want? One student wrote, \"That experience was eye-opening.\"\n\n\"Salma has become an integral part of my unit on Islam and I can't imagine teaching it without her,\" says Laura Pridmore-Brown, social studies teacher. Last year, 16 Clackamas High School kids attended a Halal dinner as part of their Humanities course to honor those who had just come back from Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca.\n\nShe has attended a Passover seder almost every year, and on Monday -- Yom Hashoah or Holocaust Remembrance Day -- read the names of Holocaust victims on in Pioneer Courthouse Square. \"If I want representation or participation, I just have to call Salma,\" said Emily Gottfried, of the\n\n.\n\n\"I try to identity the needs in the community, I mingle and socialize with everybody and I listen,\" Ahmad says.\n\nWhy does she do it? \"Because God has been so good to me,\" she says, \" I call it payback time. Do something for his creation, like He told you in the Quran.\"\n\n-- Amy Martinez Starke, special to The Oregonian"
