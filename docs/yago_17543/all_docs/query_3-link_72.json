        "text": "Mayo Hospital is the oldest and largest hospital of the country, serving the humanity since 1871. Mayo Hospital was completed in 1870 and it started patient care in 1871. It was named after the Earl of Mayo, the then Viceroy and the Governor General of India. Encompassing over 54.6 acres of land and the main building with boundary having 11 gates, the hospital is one of the largest hospitals in South East Asia and is a centre of excellence for public benefit. It had bed capacity of 300 beds on the Day of Independence (1947) but now is extended up to 2399 beds. The father of the nation, Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah also paid tribute to services rendered by this hospital on his visit to Mayo Hospital dated 19.03.1940. Mayo Hospital is located in the heart of Lahore City and is surrounded by busy commercial and thickly populated residential areas with famous Anarkali Bazaar, Nila Gumbad, Gawalmandi and the Walled City of Old Lahore around it. Earlier, after its construction in 1871, the Mayo Hospital was affiliated as a teaching hospital with the King Edward Medical College which came into being in 1860.\n\nThe hospital used to be managed by the Medical Superintendent under the administrative control of the Government till 1999 when the whole setup was declared an Autonomous Medical Institution. Later in 2016, a new management model was introduced on the modern lines and the M.S. and the whole administration of Mayo Hospital were placed under the administrative control of a newly created post of Chief Executive Officer. Prof Asad Aslam remained the CEO from Nov 2016 to March 2021, followed by Prof Saqib Saeed till Jan 2023, and currently, Prof. Muhammad Haroon Hamid has been the CEO since Jan 2023. For some time the hospital was governed by the MTI Act with Prof Mehmood Shaukat as the Chairman Board of Governors. Specialized Healthcare & Medical Education Department declared the Mayo Hospital autonomous institute under the PHMI Act in Aug 2023, and is governed by the Administration Committee notified for this purpose."
