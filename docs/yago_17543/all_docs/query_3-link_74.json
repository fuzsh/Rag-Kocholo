        "text": "High on a dusty hilltop close to the ruins of an ancient Greek city, Afghanistan's toughest military commander sits on a red carpet sipping tea and sucking on a boiled sweet. Ahmad Shah Masood is the last man holding out against the hardline Taliban militia and his war is not going well. He peers though his binoculars at the enemy positions on the distant hills, draws a quick diagram in the dust for the other commanders and then angrily barks new orders over the radio in Persian.\n\nAcross the Kokcha river just below this hill, Masood faces the artillery positions of the Taliban, the Islamic students who chased him out of the capital, Kabul, four years ago. A stone's throw to his right is the border with Tajikistan, a key military supply route through which his allies Russia, Iran and India send equipment and support. Behind him lies Badakshan, the mountainous province he cannot afford to lose and the last in Afghanistan under his complete control.\n\nFor the past four months the Taliban have fought harder than ever to push back Masood's forces and draw a noose around his military base and family home in the Panjsher valley, in central Afghanistan. \"If they win Badakshan, they win the war,\" the gaunt 47-year-old says in halting French. \"The Taliban think they can take Badakshan and encircle the Panjsher. But in the end they will never succeed in Afghanistan.\"\n\nTo his men Masood is revered as the Lion of the Panjsher. Well-educated, a devout Muslim and a brilliant military tactician, he defended the Panjsher Valley against the invading Soviet army through 10 years of war. His face and his trademark brown wool cap are still plastered on teahouse walls across northern Afghanistan.\n\nAfter the Soviets retreated, the mojahedin commanders fought between themselves and in 1992 Masood's forces won control of Kabul. But four years later, when the Taliban swept through southern Afghanistan and into Kabul, Masood fled to the Panjsher and returned to his guerrilla war. Today he holds less than 10% of the country.\n\nYet the people of the north still adore him. His intellect and his charm seem oddly out of place in a nation destroyed by two decades of fighting and so different from the poorly educated, doctrinaire and misogynistic Taliban. \"I used to read Che Guevara and Mao Tse-tung. I learned from Mao, but not Che. He was too simple. Victor Hugo is still the writer I prefer. But now there is little time to read.\"\n\nMasood has never been in a more dangerous position. In early September, after days of heavy jet and artillery bombardments, the Taliban seized the strategic town of Taloqan, the ousted government's administrative headquarters. Masood's forces fled.\n\nAs the Taliban advanced they imposed their strict brand of Islam, beating men who trim their beards and interrupting football matches to make the crowds pray. Women are banned from working and rarely allowed to leave their homes. Men were encouraged to black out their windows so their wives and daughters could not be seen from outside the home.\n\nMore than 80,000 people fled the area around Taloqan as the fighting grew closer. Packing their few belongings onto their donkeys they walked east in search of shelter. Most now face a bitterly cold winter in Badakshan, living under plastic sheeting praying for food handouts from aid agencies. They came with harrowing accounts of the brutality of Taliban occupation: houses burned and looted, civilians killed and young men and women abducted.\n\n\"I saw Taliban soldiers knock on the door of the house next to ours during the night and they took a young girl. She was 25 and her name was Bekea,\" says Farzana, a 27-year-old woman who fled with her children to Faizabad, the largest town still under opposition control. \"The Taliban said one of them would marry her. Now we don't know if she is alive or dead.\"\n\nThe fall of Taloqan was a bitter blow for Masood, cutting a major supply route linking Tajikistan and the Panjsher. Nearly 350 of his fighters, the mojahedin or \"holy warriors\", were killed in the battle and 500 injured. \"We had some problems with logistics and transport. We can't fight in every part of Afghanistan at the same time,\" he says.\n\nHe claimed the Taliban suffered 2,000 killed and injured. Analysts have put the Taliban's death toll at 1,500 in the fighting this summer.\n\nMasood has been awake since before dawn, kneeling in prayer in the cold autumn morning outside the shabby, four-roomed house which has become his base, an hour's drive from the frontline. After praying he paces alone in the rose garden watching the sun rise before breakfast and the first of his meetings with his commanders and military allies. Over a meal of tea, a slice of Afghan bread and cheese, he plans the day's attack.\n\nBy the afternoon Masood is back at the front, stopping his tank drivers to give them final instructions before his artillery and multi-barrel rocket launchers open up on the Taliban positions. His khaki trousers tucked into polished, black boots, Masood watches through binoculars as three mojahedin tanks climb the distant hill towards the Taliban posts. He breaks from the fighting just once, to lead his men in prayer before sunset when they kneel facing west to their enemy and to Mecca beyond.\n\n\"This is just the beginning,\" he says. \"Our first target is to take back Taloqan, God willing, before the winter. But these days the Taliban are advancing more cautiously and now they have Pakistani backing and tanks.\" Pakistan's military government is the Taliban's biggest ally and one of only three countries to recognise the regime, but Islamabad has always denied its troops are fighting in Afghanistan.\n\nMasood has said he is ready for negotiations with the Taliban and tentative talks have begun, but few observers expect the Islamic militia to give up their dominant military position. \"There will be resistance inside Afghanistan and we need pressure from the outside on Pakistan,\" he says. \"Even if the fighting is finished, the Taliban movement cannot continue, they cannot stay united.\" There is a note of resignation in his voice. Afghanistan's last mojahedin commander knows he must win back Taloqan before the winter, or face a final defeat."
