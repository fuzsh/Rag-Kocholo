Once you have been examined and approved the report, the compensator (insurance company of the party at fault for the accident) will use this as the basis for your compensation.\n\nAs a litigant in person dealing with your own claim, The Expert pledges to deal with your claim with integrity, fairness and diligence. Although they are acting for you, their over-riding duty is to the Court, so it is important to understand that although they are sympathetic to all of your symptoms and allegations, their report must say whether on the balance of probability i.e 50% of more whether the symptoms you have in each area are or are not related to the accident for which you are claiming for. The Expert will always explain to you the basis of their opinions in their final report.\n\nIf at any stage during the process you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to contact the administration team who can be reached via telephone, text message, livechat or email.\n\nBooking Your Medical\n\nOn receiving your case, we will add this to our secure case management system and you will be sent a link our simple portal, which allows you to book your own appointment if you so wish. If you want to speak us at time of booking your appointment, please contact us. If we do not hear from you we will attempt to call you in order to book the appointment.\n\nOnce the appointment is booked you will receive a text message and an email with the details of your appointment. Should you wish for a letter to be sent please let us know.\n\nWhen the appointment is booked, you will be sent a link in order to find the venue.\n\nIt is important that the appointment is convenient to you. If you have any issues attending the appointment, please contact us as soon as possible so that we can address this.\n\nWe will remind you of the appointment before it takes place.\n\nAttending the Medical\n\nPlease remember to bring some photo ID with you to the medical examination. Ideally this would be your passport or driving licence. If you do not have one of these please considering bringing work ID, education ID or a travel pass.\n\nPlease try and attend your appointment on time and we ask that you do not arrive too early, but please allow time for traffic, finding the clinic and parking. If you are late we will always do our best to accommodate you.\n\nThe appointment will result in you having to undertake a medical assessment of the affected area(s). It is advisable that you wear loose fitting clothes. If you wish to take a family member, friend or carer to act as a chaperone or interpreter, you are most welcome to do so.\n\nThe Expert will need to know lots of details about the accident, your injuries and treatment. It is important to be prepared for the questioning nature of the examination. It maybe helpful for you to take a note of any relevant dates of treatment if you need to.\n\nOnce the medical has taken place, the report will then be produced and uploaded to the Official Injury Claim site. From here you can review the report. Should you wish to correct any factual inaccuracies within the report, there is the function available to send such a request to The Expert.\n\nThe most important thing to remember about your examination is that it will be relaxed and friendly. It is not an inquisition or a cross examination! Simply be open and honest about your injuries and symptoms and how they have affected you since the accident. If your symptoms have improved or gone away, don’t think you have to report or display ongoing problems if they are better. Simply tell it “how it is” and the Expert will report on these even if there is nothing to actually see on examination or bothering on the day of the appointment.\n\nOur Service Pledge\n\nIn addition to our commitment to treat each claimant with courtesy, respect and dignity, we also aim to offer firm timelines to deliver your report. These include:\n\nOffer you a choice of appointments within 4 weeks of your choosing me.\n\nSee you within 10 minutes of your designated appointment time.\n\nComplete your report as you see me.\n\nExplain my findings to you at the time of the appointment.\n\nUpload your report to the LiP Portal within 24 hours of your appointment.\n\nDeal with any questions or amendment requests within 3 working days. (Respecting the fact that DME has to remain independent).\n\nData Security & Use of Data\n\nIn order to arrange and complete your medical, we will have to process and store the information which you have already provided to us from the Litigant in Person Portal.\n\nThis data will be kept confidential and only shared with our contracted secretaries, administrators and IT providers (notably D2Expert) in keeping with the rules on the use and storage of data based on our legitimate interest, which is that you have asked us to conduct a medical on your behalf.\n\nIn relation to any special category personal data, such as health records, we rely on the legal claims basis for processing this data, in addition to our legitimate interest.\n\nAll of our policies regarding privacy, data and GDPR can be found on our website.

If at any time you feel we have let you down or there is something that we could improve, then please tell us. You will be given a customer feedback form at the end of your examination, which will be anonymous, so please feel free to help us improve anything that we haven’t got quite right. If you don’t want to fill this in, then just call us or drop us an email.\n\nHowever, if there is anything that you feel you wish to take further with a more formal investigation then do not hesitate to ask us for our complaints procedure.\n\nCharges\n\nAs your case has been accepted onto the LiP Portal, the cost of the medical report will be paid by the compensator, so we will never come to you to ask for money. We understand that occasionally appointments need to be changed last minute or that you forget to come and don’t attend. Please make every effort to do so. We will remind you by text message the day before. However, it is our policy not to charge for such events, as we understand life sometimes gets in the way.\n\nAbout D2Expert\n\nAbout D2Expert\n\nD2Expert are specialists in medico-legal administration and work on behalf of the expert to provide them with administration services including:\n\nBooking and Rescheduling of Appointments\n\nTelephone Call Handling\n\nLive Chat Handling\n\nSMS Handling\n\nManaging Email\n\nManaging Post\n\nOther administration tasks\n\nBy being your first port of call for any queries, this allows the expert to concentrate on providing examinations and independent medico legal reports.

The Expert is committed to the principles set out in the General Data Protection Regulation and has reviewed its personal data processing activities so as to carry on its business as an Expert Witness in compliance with the provisions of the Regulation.Anyone processing personal data, must ensure that data is:\n\nProcessed fairly, lawfully and in a transparent manner;\n\nCollected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and any further processing is completed for a compatible purpose;\n\nAdequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the intended purposes.\n\nAccurate, and where necessary, kept up to date;\n\nKept in a form which permits identification for no longer than necessary for the intended purposes;\n\nProcessed in line with the individual’s rights and in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures;\n\nNot transferred to people or organisations situated in countries without adequate protection and without firstly having advised the individual.\n\nData protection lead: this person is responsible for ensuring compliance with policies and procedures on data protection, for providing any staff training, for conducting audits, risk assessments and data protection impact assessments, for responding to requests from data subjects and dealing with data breaches. He or she also handles queries and complaints from data subjects about the processing of their data, including from any members of staff. The name of the data protection lead is The Expert\n\nData subject: an individual whose personal data is processed.\n\nThe expert processes personal data belonging to those who wish to obtain expert advice in relation to legal issues or disputes, and also individuals linked in any way to the circumstances giving rise to those issues. The personal data of any members of staff is also processed.\n\nPersonal data: any information from which a living individual can be identified, either directly or indirectly. It is not limited to names and identification numbers, or to photographs or addresses.\n\nThe categories of personal data The Expert processes include:\n\nLegal cases\n\nNames, addresses, dates of birth and other personal data contained in witness statements and other evidence relevant to the legal issues;\n\nHealth information contained in medical records, together with information on sex, race and ethnic origin;\n\nPersonal data in invoices and copy receipts, accounting records, tax and VAT returns and related information;\n\nCopy passports, driving licenses, utility bills and other documents used to check identity;\n\nMembers of staff\n\nNames, addresses, dates of birth, personal email addresses and telephone numbers;\n\nCVs, contracts of employment, references, appraisals and salaries;\n\nBank details and pay slips;\n\nHealth information;\n\nSpecial category data: information revealing an individual’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic and biometric data, health information and data in relation to a person’ s sex or sexual orientation.\n\nThe special category personal data The Expert holds includes:\n\nMedical and other health records\n\nInformation on sex, race and ethnic origin\n\nProcessing: covers any activity involving personal data, including holding, storage and destruction. The Information Commissioner says it is difficult to image an activity involving personal data that does not fall within the definition.\n\nThe Expert processes personal data in order to carry out its work as an expert witness and when carrying out other functions necessary to its business.\n\nThe data processing activities include: compiling expert reports, taking copies of identity documents and storing them in files or online, sending and receiving emails internally and externally, submitting invoices and filing them with receipts, uploading documents onto the cloud, using a customer relationship management system, holding staff details on hard copy/electronic personnel files, archiving and destroying information.\n\nSharing of personal data: The Expert shares personal internally, and also externally only when necessary to achieve its business purposes.

The Expert is a data controller for the purposes of this policy.\n\nData processor: processes personal data in accordance with the written instructions of the data controller. Most of the organisations that The Expert shares personal data with are processors.\n\nLegitimising conditions: The processing of personal data is unlawful unless a legitimising condition, or lawful basis, applies. The Expert generally relies on the following legitimising conditions:\n\nLegitimate interest as a business\n\nContract (with employees)\n\nConsent\n\nWhen processing special category data, The Expert generally relies on one of the following additional legitimising conditions\n\nLegal claims\n\nExplicit consent\n\nThe Expert avoids relying on the consent basis where possible. In order to be valid, consent must be freely given and as easily withdrawn as it was to give it.\n\nData protection principles: Where there is a lawful basis for processing personal data, The Expert takes proportionate steps to ensure it carries out its personal data processing activities in accordance with the various conditions or principles contained in the GDPR.\n\nAccountability: This principle is designed to ensure that data protection is embedded in an organisation at all levels of decision making and becomes fundamental to its culture. Not only must The Expert comply with the General Data Protection Regulation but it must be able to show it complies. It is for this reason that this policy, and the appended policies have been written. All staff receive training in these policies and The Expert ensures that they are implemented.\n\nData protection by design: This is an aspect of the accountability principle. It means that data protection risks are evaluated and eradicated and reduced at the very earliest stage, whenever there is a significant change in processes or procedures which entail a risk to data subjects. Examples: a substantial upgrade to an IT system, the introduction of CCTV cameras, outsourcing such as engaging a new cloud provider. Data Protection Impact Assessments are carried out by the data protection lead in these and other circumstances where there is likely to be a high risk to data subjects.\n\nData protection by default: minimisation: Another important principle is data minimisation. In other words, no more data should be collected, shared and stored than is strictly necessary. The retention periods for the personal data The Expert stores are up to six years, as necessary. A schedule of retention periods is appended to this policy.\n\nSecurity: This is one of the most important principles. The Expert has taken physical, organisational and technical measures to ensure that its personal data is secure. Hard copy as well as electronic data is processed in accordance with The Expert’s security policy, attached to this policy.\n\nIt is important that all members of staff comply with the security policy. Failure to do so is a disciplinary offence that may result in dismissal.\n\nPersonal data breach: The data protection lead is responsible for responding to personal data breaches. He or she notifies the Information Commissioner as necessary, and also data subjects where the risk to them is high.\n\nBreaches which carry any risk to data subjects must be reported to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) within 72 hours, together with a summary of the nature of the breach, the steps taken to reduce the risk to data subjects, and measures to prevent the breach from happening again. The Expert’s data breach policy is attached.\n\n21 Rights of data subjects: Data subjects have eight rights which include:\n\nRight to be informed about what The Expert does with personal data;\n\nRight of access to personal data by means of a subject access request;\n\nRight to rectification of inaccurate data, and to add to the information The Expert holds about the data subject if it is incomplete;\n\nRight to erasure, otherwise known as the right to be forgotten;\n\nRight to restrict the processing of personal data;\n\nRight to object to the processing The Expert carries out based on its legitimate interest.\n\nThe Expert must respond to requests from data subjects within one month. The procedure for responding to requests is appended to this policy.\n\nHuman Resources: is responsible for processing the personal data of members of staff. It is stored in hard copy files that are stored securely/electronic files stored securely in the cloud. Access to these files is restricted. Special category data, such as medical records, is further restricted as appropriate. Special category data stored electronically are encrypted. No personal data is shared outside Human Resources, other than with the member of staff’s manager.\n\nAll members of staff receive training in data protection.\n\nData Protection Risk Register: All personal data processing activities are recorded in the data protection risk register.\n\nPersonal data breaches are recorded in the risk register, whether they are reportable or not.\n\nThe risk register contains a copy of all audits, risk assessments and Data Protection Impact Assessments.\n\nThe data protection lead holds the risk register.\n\nEnforcement and disciplinary action: Failure to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation is a criminal offence in many cases and can result in large fines. It is important that all staff are aware of this policy, receive training in data protection, and that this policy is properly implemented.\n\nAny staff failure to comply with this and its associated policies is a disciplinary offence which may lead to disciplinary action and dismissal.\n\nData Breach Policy\n\nData Breach Policy\n\nData Subject Request Policy\n\nData Subject Request Policy\n\nThe rights of data subjects include the following:\n\nRight of access to personal data by means of a subject access request;\n\nRight to rectification of inaccurate data;\n\nRight to erasure, otherwise known as the right to be forgotten;\n\nRight to object to processing;\n\nRight to restriction on processing;\n\nIn order to respond to requests in a timely manner The Expert recognises the importance of centralised efficient information management systems. It is reviewing how it organises and stores emails and texts so as to enable easy and efficient retrieval.\n\nThe Expert stores data in relation to each client, whether it be an organisation or individual, on a hardcopy and/or electronic files dedicated to the client. The files contain the evidence The Expert has been provided with, together with identity check documents, and invoices and receipts. Relevant emails, letters and faxes are also stored on these files.\n\nIdentification records and special category personal data, such as medical records, are kept in a separate sub folder, distinct from the main file, whether the data is in hard copy or kept electronically. Hard copy files are stored in locked cabinets with access restricted to a need to know basis. Identification records and special category data are encrypted on electronic files, with similarly restricted access.\n\nRecords relating to employees are kept in individual files, with any medical or health related information separated into a sub folder. Hard copy files are kept in locked cabinets with restricted access. Electronic files also have restricted access and any medical or health data is encrypted.\n\nThe data protection lead/The Expert is responsible for responding to requests from data subjects and must do so within one month. The period may be extended by a further two months where that is necessary. In these circumstances the data subject must be informed within one month that more time is needed and given the reason why.\n\nRequests from data subjects need not be in writing. There is no standard wording and they may be made casually over the telephone.
