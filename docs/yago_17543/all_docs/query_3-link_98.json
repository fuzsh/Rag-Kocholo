        "text": "(The Unworthy) Masood Ali (1861-1953)\n\nThe humble compiler of this narrative is the younger son of Sheikh Ahmed Ali Marhoom, may he be favoured by divine mercy. Although I am convinced that there is no aspect of my life worthy of presenting to the public as exceptional in any way, nonetheless this ongoing narrative cannot be halted merely on that basis. My place of birth is also Delhi. I was still on my mother’s lap when the benign presence of my father left us. The youngest issue and that too an orphan; one can well image a mother’s love and affection for this child. The untimely death of her young daughter only made the surviving offspring more cherished and precious. Our late father left no great wealth, but whatever there was, through her prudent economising and Chacha Marhoom’s (Moulvi Ali Ahmed Sahib) propitious planning (whereby) the funds were invested in a way that in those cheaper times it was possible to get by with a lifestyle of reasonable quality. Chacha Marhoom’s house in Delhi was located within Habash Khan’s Phatak. This house was extremely spacious and pleasing; it had been constructed at Bahadur Shah Zafar’s behest for his sixth wife Zeenat Mahal’s mother, we resided in a portion of this haveli. When I reached the age of comprehension my mother enrolled me at the neighbourhood Maktab where a Qari Sahib taught only the Kalam Majeed. This Mohalla was largely inhabited by Punjabi Saudaguran (merchants and traders) and it was their sons who studied with Qari Sahib. While we shared our schooling with them our temperaments never matched enough to allow any familiarity or closeness with them. A few days must have passed when Chacha Marhoom sent for the Sipara for me to recite. I proved to be a total dolt, I remembered neither the past lesson nor had any comprehension of the next one. He remarked, “Moulvi Waziruddin Sahib teaches the Kalam Majeed at the Maktab Masjid, from now on you will go there, I will let him know.” That mosque too was close by and in accordance with Chacha Marhoom’s instructions, I began going there. ‘Allah, Allah kar ka, I had read only a few Surah’s, when Nana Sahib Marhoom (Munshi Sheikh Baqar Ali Sahib) arrived in Delhi from Fatehpur to escort my mother to the wedding celebrations of her youngest brother Sheikh Amjad Ali. By coincidence, I was just leaving the Maktab Masjid when I noticed a gentleman standing nearby inquiring about something, people offered him some information and he, accordingly, took a particular direction. It happened to be the same route that I took and so I followed behind him. Seeing that his style of dress and bearing were distinct from the typical Delhi style and deportment, I quickened my steps until I was soon walking alongside him. Sheikh Baqar Ali Sahib (Marhoom) had never seen any of seen us children, but as soon he set eyes on me he addressed his retainer and remarked: “look at that resemblance to our family faces.” I do not know what answer the man gave since having heard that I had moved on, and, upon reaching home promptly started eating my meal. I had just finished my food and was washing my hands when a servant came in from outside and informed my mother that “your respected father has arrived from Fathepur and honoured us with his presence.” She immediately called for him to be brought inside. Indeed the meeting of father and daughter after almost forty to forty-five years was a memorable scene to behold; the picture of it is still clear in front of my eyes. In short, Nana Sahib Marhoom stayed a few days and then taking us with him set out for the journey home to our vatan.\n\nAlthough in those days a journey by train from Delhi to Lucknow was certainly possible, nonetheless in that era travelling by bullock-cart was perceived as far more desirable, private and safer as well. Chacha Marhoom and certain relatives and close friends came with us up to the Ganga Bridge to see us off on our way. If my memory doesn’t fail me, it was the month of May and the loo [1] blew with great intensity, after about ten, eleven in the morning until four or five in the evening travel was practically impossible. For our journey, we were equipped with a bullock-cart and a two-wheeled horse-carriage. Riding on the bullock-cart was my mother, myself and our old household attendant and companion Bibi Chando who had brought up and raised all of us brothers and sisters, forsaking her own children, kith, kin and vatan, and had devoted forty to fifty years of her life to us, staying faithfully in our service through good times and bad, through comfort and ease as well as difficulty and hardship. The luggage was on the other cart along with Nana Sahib Marhoom himself and his two attendants. The normal mode of travel was such that while it was still somewhat dark we would all wake up, hurriedly get through our morning routine and be ready for the journey. In those days we were not yet subject to the bane of morning breakfast and tea. By the time the sun had risen in the sky we had covered two to four miles and around ten or eleven o’clock when the sun was blazing and the wind scorching we would seek shelter under some shady trees close to a well, a stream or riverside and stop for a while. The two carts were placed close together, a purdah tied around the perimeter and the ground covered with flooring. People would disembark from the carts and sit in that space. Within one side of this enclosure preparations for cooking food would then begin. If the food was to be cooked elsewhere the utensils would be sent out. After the meal had been prepared and the eating, drinking, resting and napping was done and over with, the journey would re-commence around four or five o’clock and would continue until eight or nine at night. The night would be then spent in some qasba serai. At that time, I could not have been more than six, seven years of age and till then had never stepped out of Delhi, in fact, most likely never stepped out of my Mohalla. For me, this journey was like a fantastical, magical dream and the impression of it is deeply embedded in my being even now, so much so that whenever I recall that journey it has an unimaginable effect on my heart and mind. Waking up under a canopy of stars; the warble and chirping of the birds; the rising of the sun and its gradual ascent until it reached its fierce apex; our seeking protection from its afternoon heat under the shade of trees; Dhak[2] and Babul[3] forests with their bright orange-red and yellow flowers and delicate fragrance; arriving at the serias in the evening; the bellowing and clamour of the hawkers; the hustle, bustle of the travellers; such scenes, such sights I can never, ever forget. Since then I have had occasion to travel extensively; from Kashmir to Ceylon, to cities and mountains, where I have had the opportunity to view and gaze upon the most incredible sights and scenery, but the truth of the matter is that I have never enjoyed a journey as much as that one.\n\nApproximately fifteen days into our travel we stopped over at the residence of Chotay Mamo, Munshi Amjad Ali Sahib, who at that time was employed in the Munsify[4]of Sikandarabad in the district of Bulandshahr. It was to attend his marriage that this extensive journey had been undertaken. By the time we approached our vatan, the monsoon rains had begun with full force and because of this we were forced to stop for one, sometimes two days, and in one instance, we ended up spending almost an entire week at the qasba of Kursi. During the course of my young life in Delhi, I had never seen a mango tree nor had any idea that this prized fruit was so abundantly available all over Hindustan. The moment we stepped onto Awadh’s soil the bounty and splendour of the orchards was all around us. Nana Sahib Marhoom was passionate about mangoes, wherever he saw a large orchard he would alight from his carriage, partake of the fruit, share them with us, and gather some for later. His carriage was virtually a moving bushel of mangoes in which ripe fruit from the many qasbas and villages we passed through were always accessible. Needless to say, in this manner, stopping and going, approximately one and a half month later we arrived in Kursi. Since our intended date of arrival had passed and although the reason for our delay in the qasba of Kursi (as a result of to the heavy rains) had been conveyed via letters, men had been sent out from our vatan to inquire about our wellbeing. The arrival of these men was a source of great support to us; whenever the carriages were bogged down and stuck in the slush and mud and the bullocks stopped pulling, these men would use their strength to haul them out. This part of the journey was indeed covered with great difficulty. When we reached the border of our vatan many of our companions plunged into the river to wash and bath themselves and changed out of their mud-soiled clothes. Some of our relatives had come out to this place to welcome us, and in their company, we arrived at Nana Sahib Marhoom’s house where our kin and relatives of all ages, young, old and contemporaries were gathered in such numbers that one was left wide-eyed with astonishment.\n\nAt this time Walda Sahiba remained in our vatan for almost two years, and during this period Chotay Mamo’s marriage to Afzulunissa, d/o Khan Bahadur Syed Hafeezuddin Dewai and the eldest sister of Khan Bahadur Nihaluddin Ahmed was solemnised and celebrated with great fanfare and ceremony in qasba Dewa. I remember being part of the baraat, arriving in Dewa, seated on the bridegroom’s lap atop an elephant; my crying session that began in the middle of the night; being carried around the house in the arms of Sakina Bibi who was my mother’s Mamuzad Bhain, and thereby my Khala, trying very hard to soothe me. While I remember all this, what I do not recall is how and when we returned from Dewa.\n\nDuring our stay in Fatehpur, Walda Sahiba had to make a trip to Laherpur, in the district of Sitapur, to commiserate with Sheikh Ahmedullah Sahib (Marhoom) Laherpuri on the demise of his eldest son Sheikh Zahoorul Haq. I, of course, went along with her. Incidentally, it was there that I got my first glimpse of the lifestyle and habits of the larger land-owners, the rural Zamindars. At that time Sheikh Ahmedullah Sahib (Marhoom), and Moulvi Shah Rukunuddin (Marhoom) and Haji Mian (Marhoom) were alive and these three gentlemen were considered the major Zamindars and Rais’of Laherpur. If I am not mistaken, amongst these three gentlemen, in terms of wealth, the most affluent was Haji Sahib, then Moulvi Shah Rukunuddin followed by Sheikh Ahmedullah Sahib, but because Sheikh Ahmedullah Sahib held the largest area of cultivated land within the qasba, besides being the village headman, he commanded greater prestige and respect. Moreover, his middle son Sheikh Nurul Haq Sahib Marhoom’s many interests and activities, his decorum and excellent disposition, his immense popularity and the high regard in which he was held by all those who knew him made this household one of notable distinction and honour. There was no official in the municipality or district, no Rias amongst the aristocrats of the surrounding areas with whom he did not enjoy a cordial, warm and friendly relationship. With his open-hearted generosity of spirit and his enthusiastic energy, he raised every pursuit and activity he undertook to an elevated level of excellence. When he took an interest in developing a fruit-garden, his home garden and orchards were embellished and equipped, as is proper, with a vast variety and assortment of mangoes and other fruit. There was no popular fruit or mango whose tree he did not send for to plant and add to his collection. When he acquired poultry and pigeons, they were similarly unsurpassed in quality. In the same manner and style, he kept peregrines and falcons of outstanding superiority. When he decided to breed cattle for milk, he sent animals from as far off as Gujrat.\n\nSuffice it to say that for me the ordinary and routine activities of the rural lifestyle with frequent gatherings for feasting on the of fruits from the orchards, sugarcane from fields and singhara or water chestnuts from the ponds held an inordinate and extraordinary fascination. I can still clearly picture some of those memorable picnics. It was here too that I witnessed my very first ram-fights and cockfights.\n\nSheikh Ahmedullah Sahib (Marhoom) must have been approximately seventy to seventy-two years old, but despite that, with his fine full-face, his fresh pink and white complexion, his white roundly trimmed beard, an onlooker could help but be impressed by the nobleness of his countenance. His warm-heartedness, his earnestness and intrinsic graciousness and nobility of character was evident in his every word and action. A considerable portion of his time was spent in worship and the rest of his time was spent in writing letters to his relatives and friends. Stacks and stacks of long envelopes of (sharbati) pale-yellow paper were neatly and meticulously arranged on his writing takht and within two to four days he would have finished with them. Hardly a day went by when he would not anxiously be concerned about the welfare and health of at least twenty-five to thirty of his close friends, kith and kin and dispatch letters off to inquire about their well-being. These letters were delivered by hand or via regular, economy post. As soon as it was discovered that someone was going to such-and-such place the writing of letters would commence, in fact later in life, letters addressed to different people were written and prepared in advance requiring only the addition of a date and the subject of health and some brief sentence or phrase to complete it. People would view this sagely practice with respectful appreciation. He was particularly attached to us, and not merely due to our kinship; a reason for this was that Sheikh Sahib’s mother departed from this life when he was very young, and his nurturing and upbringing was undertaken by his Chacha’s daughter Bibi Sajjani, the author’s Dadi. A man of his sensibility and warm heart could never forget or fail to acknowledge his gratitude towards her, he would repeatedly and in countless ways express his indebtedness and whenever the subject was brought up, his eyes would involuntarily well up with tears.\n\nWe stayed in Laherpur for about a month or two after which we returned to Fatehpur. It was during this time that my mother was summoned by her Mamo, Sheikh Abad-ul Salam Dewai, and as was our usual practice, I went along with her to the qasba of Dewa. Sheikh Abad-ul Salam (Marhoom) was commonly referred to as Salam Mian and at that time could not have been less than seventy years of age; a slender, slim gentleman with a pink and white complexion, his eyesight had failed, but with the assistance of his man-servant, he was efficiently and actively mobile and would at times walk all the way to Fatehpur. Only moderately educated for that era, he was meticulous in the observance of his namaz and rooza and was an extremely virtuous and upright elder. He had one son and five daughters. At the time of our visit, other than his eldest daughter, Bibi Sabira, who was married to Sheikh Abid-ul Samad (Marhoom) Dewai, the other daughters were all living with him. His son Sheikh Ghulam Mohiuddin, who remained a bachelor till the end of his life, worked for the police department in Lucknow. Sheikh Abad-ul Salam possessed a small zamindari on which he managed to subsist, but the house always appeared full of cheerful hustle-bustle and lively activity. Walda Sahiba and I stayed for about a fortnight and then returned home.\n\nAlthough my mother herself could not be included amongst the well-educated ladies of the times, she put in an inordinate amount of effort into our education. Thus wherever her journeys took her, the first thing she did was arrange for my tutoring and did not let me remain idle for a single day. But obviously, under those unsettled circumstances, no progress was likely. The outcome of this was that I returned to Delhi unlettered and ignorant as I had left it. Our uneventful return journey was by rail, without any memorable incident worth mentioning. After having tested my learning, Chacha Sahib Marhoom (Ali Ahmed Sahib Marhoom), expressed the opinion that it was not enough to just continue the study of the Holy Scriptures anymore, I had to be taught Urdu and Farsi as well. Accordingly, I was admitted to a Primary-level Madrasah, located within the Habash Khan Phatak precinct, housed in the Mirza Asfandyar Baig’s Shish Mahal. Most of the boys studying there were Hindu of the Khatri caste from the gritty narrow lanes, who, as was to be expected in a bazar neighbourhood came to this Madrasah due to the close convenience of its location; there were also perhaps five or six Muslim children. Although, to a certain degree there was the element of touchable and non-touchable amongst the Hindu children, I was much happier in their company than I had been in the company of Qari Sahib’s Punjabi students. I was soon able to overcome the apathy that had made my progress in Urdu reading and writing torturous. The rate of my advancement was fairly rapid when all of a sudden, an unexpected development occurred in our lives. Chacha Sahib (Moulvi Ahmed Ali Sahib Marhoom) who had been jobless for an extended period accepted a job in the Princely State of Dujana and he urged my mother to go with him. Although initially, she refused to do so, nevertheless given her circumstances, she eventually relented. Bhai Sahib (Hakim Mehmood Ali Sahib Marhoom) who was at that time studying under the tutelage of Maulana Nazeer Husain Sahib (Marhoom) Muhaddis Dehlvi was left behind in Delhi.\n\nIn those days, there was no railway connection between Delhi and Dujana. The journey to Dujana took two days, and one night had to be spent at a serai in qasba Bahadurgarh. Bahadurgarh serai was a very busy place; all those travelling back and forth to and from Delhi stopped at this particular Inn. In the evenings, the scene around the seria was indeed a sight to behold. The building was extensive with identical sturdy, well-built private chambers in front of which was a continuous raised terrace. At the end of the terrace were row upon row of very small (clay) stoves and when these were lit up in the evening it was a magical, marvellous sight to behold. All around the fires were crowds of people; some just sat about and talked, others related stories and tales, while some lively and high-spirited travellers played music and sang. All in all, the atmosphere and ambience at this serai in the evening hours was a splendid sight. After spending one night there we arrived in Dujana.\n\nQasba Dujana at that time was a very simple and barren place; there were no roads, and other than a mosque no buildings of any consequence, and perhaps other than the residences of the Nawab Sahib and some of his relatives no substantial houses were to be found. Forget about orchards and such like, even the most ordinary fruits and vegetables including paan had to be procured from Delhi or qasba Beri etc. So much so that even the boys there would chew on jowar (sorghum) stalks instead of chewing on sugar-cane stalks. Every week or so when a Kunjra[5] brought in overripe and rotten guavas or dried out and shrivelled tangerines to sell there would be much excitement throughout the qasba. But these inadequacies were compensated by the abundance of milk, yoghurt and ghee, combined with the healthy, wholesome air and salubrious environment.\n\nIn Dujana, Chacha Marhoom had me admitted to a Maktab run by a gentleman named Moulvi Imamuddin who promptly dismissed all my Madrassah books and started me solely on Maulana Qazi Sanaullah’s “Mala baad Minah”. However, a few days later, Moulvi Imamuddin made an extended visit to his vatan and the Maktab shut down. Another Moulvi named Moulvi Fakhruddin Sahib was the officially appointed Pesh Imam of the Dujana State Mosque and tutor to the current Rias’s heir apparent Mumtaz Ali Khan (b.1864-d.1908) With the permission of the Rias, he also admitted sons of certain State functionaries to his Maktab. Chacha Marhoom obtained Nawab Sahib’s consent and I too was admitted there. The style of education here was what is the norm amongst aristocratic children. The heir apparent was probably about ten, eleven years old at that time, he was quiet but friendly and clever. He would happily fraternise with the boys at the Maktab, laughing and conversing with them and joining in their games. Towards me he was favourably gracious as well and would often reiterate that on completion of my studies he would procure me employment in the State. While the schooling in itself was reasonable, the heir apparent’s words were undeniably heart-warming. In this way, some time passed when Bhai Sahib who had been left behind in Delhi to continue his studies began to experience the lack of good food and drink that our mother’s absence caused. His letters to her about his hardships evoked her maternal sensibilities, she could not allow a son of hers to suffer such privations and immediately resolved to return to Delhi. Chacha Sahib was opposed to this, his main objection was “if you leave, your younger son’s education will suffer.” After much discussion and deliberation, it was decided that Walda Sahiba would return to Delhi to look after Bhai Sahib while I would stay on in Dujana and this plan was followed accordingly. Since Chacha Sahib had rented his house out when he moved to Dujana, and since it made no sense to get such a large house vacated for just two people, Walda Sahiba and Bhai Sahib, Bhai Sahib took a small house on rent near Tahur Khan’s Masjid in the Hakeemon Wali Gali and that is where he settled our mother. It was during that period that our close friendship with Anees ul-Rehman Khan Sahib and Latif ul-Rehman Khan Sahib etc who were the maternal nephews of Qudratullah Khan Sahib developed further. Qudratullah Khan Sahib who was the younger son of Mundo Khan Sahib and the brother of Tahur Khan Sahib had held important commissions such as that of Subedari during the Badshahi period and was a man of high status, held in great esteem, and considered amongst the pious and virtuous people of his time. After the British took over control and administration of Awadh he had purchased several villages near Fatehpur, had moved from Lucknow and taken up residence in Fatehpur. Nana Sahib, Munshi Baqar Ali Sahib and other Rais from the qasba had provided him with land to construct his houses there. His relationship with our family was as that of brethren. Anees ul-Rehman Khan Sahib and others would often pay brief visits to their Mamo in Fathepur and thus were familiar with our family and would always meet us with great cordiality. The house Bhai Sahib had taken on rent did not possess a Mardana[6] section, therefore the seating and meeting area for his visitors was one of Anees ul-Rehman Khan Sahib’s room that was attached to the mosque. However, Walda Sahiba was accustomed to and had spent her entire life in spacious and commodious houses and was greatly distressed with her current cramped accommodations. And to top it all, her faithful maidservant and companion of forty to fifty years standing Bibi Chando passed away in this house at approximately eighty years of age. She is buried in the dargah of Hazrat Baqi Billah where the graves of some of our elders exist. Bibi Chando’s death made matters worse for our mother. With Chacha Sahib’s move to Dujana, there was nothing left to induce her to stay on in Delhi. The elders back home in our vatan especially our Mamo’s were emphatic that it was only reasonable for her and Bhai Sahib to return home and take up residence there. Bhai Sahib too was by now amenable to the idea. Frequent visits back and forth to the vatan over the last few years had revived old connections, and long-lost and forgotten relationships had been rejuvenated and restored afresh and were exerting their pull with full force. In the end, mother and son both concurred that the logical thing to do was to return to Fathepur and live there. I was with Chacha Sahib in Dujana when a letter summoning back to Delhi arrived; I do not know how Chacha Sahib agreed to send me but nonetheless, he dispatched me to Delhi with someone. Within a month or two of my arrival in Delhi, we departed for Fathepur via rail.\n\nOn our return to our vatan we took up residence in our nanial, our maternal home, in the section of the house had had previously been occupied and vacated for us by our sanglay[7] Mamo, Moulvi Nawazish Ali Sahib’s family. That family had moved to the house of their brother-in-law Hakim Sarfraz Ali whose wife had passed away leaving his extremely young children bereft and motherless. The area around the large courtyard within the house was occupied by the family of Moulvi Abbas Ali Sahib (Marhoom) and the smaller section next to it, which was for some reason referred to as the kitchen, was occupied by manglay[8]Mamo’s family (whose wife Bibi Maryam was also my phupi). Nana Sahib was still alive at that time and his residence was in the outside summerhouse pavilion. As it is, the house was under the circumstances, Mashallah, overflowing with people and our arrival now added to the comings and goings, and the lively hustle and bustle of people. In those days none of our Mamo’s resided at home on a permanent basis, they would merely visit from their places of employment for a few days every now and then. However, because of Nana Sahib, Munshi Baqar Ali’s personality, the Mardana was always teeming with his friends and pupils. I will write in detail about Nana Sahib life later, for now it will suffice to say that when Walda Sahiba confided and disclosed to him the consistent shortcomings in my education and her own trepidations about my schooling, he comforted her and reassured her that, “ Inshallah your son will be well educated, there is no need for any anxiety, I will supervise his studies myself.” Consequently, following this plan of action, Nana Sahib selected a book and commenced my Farsi education himself, while my Kalam Majeed tutoring was assigned to Bibi Rasool Bandi, my Mamozad and Phupizad sister. Not much time had passed after this that Nana Sahib Marhoom’s health began to deteriorate and within a few days he passed away. With his death that scholarly gathering of people that he personally drew dispersed and the arrangements for my education changed yet again.\n\nIn those days Moulvi Abid ul-Samad Sahib s/o Moulvi Nawazish Ali Sahib (Marhoom) and Moulvi Hakeem Ali Mahmud Sahib (Marhoom) s/o Maulana Moulvi Hakeem Masoom Ali Sahib were residing in the qasba; these venerable gentlemen tutored me for a bit, but since both had completed their education and were in quest of work they did not stay in the vatan for long and once again my mother’s anxiety about my schooling ensued. After much deliberation and consultation, it was decided that I be sent to a Maktab located in the house of Moulvi Kazi Mohammad Sirajuddin Sahib (Marhoom ) where Moulvi Saeed Zamin Ali Sahib taught young children. Moulvi Saeed Zamin Ali Sahib (Marhoom) was an aristocrat from Malihabad who himself had come to Fatehpur to learn from Janab Maulana Nazeer Ali Sahib (Marhoom). He would study with Maulana Sahib and spend the rest of his time teaching children. His bonds and ties to the Makhdoomzadagan of Fatehpur grew to such an extent that he forsook his own vatan and made Fathepur his permanent abode. At the time I am referring to he was a handsome, athletic young man. He studied medium level Arabic with the aforementioned Maulana and resided in Moulvi Kazi Mohammad Sirajuddin Sahib’s house. That house had a magnificent and majestic Imli tree that served as a canopy over the extensive yard and in the north, east and west sides were dalans (halls) of varying sizes and levels. Kazi Jalaluddin (Marhoom), who had lost his sanity lived in the western dalan. The eastern portion had previously been designated for the servants, but later when Kazi Imaduddin Sahib (Marhoom) retired and came home with a pension he took up residence in this section of the house. The Maktab was in the northern dalan, two takhts had been placed here on which the boys sat and studied. The lessons were taught by Moulvi Saeed Zamin Ali Sahib seated across from us on a charpoy. The number of students at this Maktab was small; Moulvi Kazi Mohammad Sirajuddin Sahib Marhoom’s two nephews, his sister’s sons, Mohammad Yaqoob and Mohammad Ayub, Bhai Piaray Jan (Ghulam Mohiuddin s/o Moulvi Ghulam Jilani), our kinsman Abu Al-Hasan son of the now late and highly respected Maulana Hafiz Hakeem Masoom Ali Sahib and if my memory does not fail me, our close relative Moulvi Mohammad Yusuf who was admitted at this Maktab at the same time as myself. After essentially inquiring about my age, Moulvi Zamin Ali Sahib began my studies with the forward to The Gulistan, which is in essence actually very difficult, nonetheless, my proficiency in this had developed to the extent that I could not only comprehend but also appreciate the magical narrative powers of the revered Hazrat Sheikh Saadi and be captivated by them. Certain verses and phrases are still firmly entrenched in my memory. During those moments when I recall those words, I am overwhelmed by a flow of memories, of childhood and carefree times, the faces of friends and peers, of bygone companionships, the very features of the house, all appear in front of my eyes, and my heart, my very being is overcome by a condition beyond description which cannot be expressed and for which neither poetic or philosophical words can be sufficient. However, those people who have themselves undergone such profound, heartfelt experiences can fully comprehend this feeling. My participation in this engaging company continued for approximately three to four years, and during the extent of this period, I made considerable progress in my studies. After reading a few chapters of Gulistan, we moved on to Bustan and read some sections of the divinely blessed and revered Jami’s Zuleika. Moulvi Zamin Ali Sahib was himself studying as well as teaching a considerable number of children; he did not have the time to offer them a second lesson in the day, therefore some of his students took that second tutorial with Moulvi Hafeezuddin Sahib (Marhoom). Moulvi Hafeezuddin Sahib had by this time lost his sight and was therefore unemployed. He liked teaching and was proficient at it, therefore I, Mohammad Yaqoob, Bhai Piaray Jan, cousin Mohammad Yusuf and others began going to him for our second lesson, and since there was no one who kept a watch on us, slowly and gradually we stopped attending the Maktab altogether and relied only on Moulvi Hafeezuddin Sahib’s lessons for our schooling. Thus according to our plan, every morning around seven or eight o’clock Bhai Piaray Jan, cousin Mohammad Yusuf, I and others would leave our homes together for our lessons, each one with a small (paper) packet of salt and chilli powder in our pockets. Our first destination was invariably the red Imli tree that was in front of the Kachi Phulari[9]. Throughout the year this tree would invariably bear some ripe fruit, if however, no fruit was to be found, our activity would focus on the flowers and buds. When our pockets were full of these items we would arrive at Moulvi Sahib’s. After offering our adaab and taslim we would open our books and simultaneously the small parcels of salt and chilli, then some of the ripe Imli fruit or buds would be unloaded from our pockets and the pleasure of savouring this cache would commence. All the students who studied with Moulvi Sahib read different books, while one gentleman read, the others would savour their snack and indulge in swiping and snatching from each other’s stash, in fact, some would not even refrain from eating while reading out their lesson. Being blind, Moulvi Sahib could not view this spectacle, but his ears could hear the lip-smacking sounds that instinctively emanate from the mouth of someone relishing a sour, tangy food item and would often enquire about, “why do you people keep smacking your lips while reading?’ A chipper and evasive answer would be used to fob off the hapless gentleman. Debility had moderated Moulvi Sahib’s quick temper to a large extent, but on occasions, such deeds and our disinclination to learn would stoke those latent flames into action. Bhai Piaray Jan was the oldest amongst all of us and as a consequence of his patrimonial traditions and affinities as well as heredity learning he was much inclined towards dua and taweez,[10]totkas and shagun.[11] It was he who proposed (to the rest of us) that if we wanted to ensure that Moulvi Sahib did not lose his temper at us we had to follow his prescribed antidote. This entailed taking a pinch of dust from the under the sole of Moulvi Sahib’s shoe and sprinkling it on his head. Piaray Jan himself first enacted this feat since he was the preeminent target of Moulvi Sahib’s ire, and as it would happen on that particular day Moulvi Sahib actually did not lose his temper at him. As a result, every boy who walked in would drop a pinch of dust on Moulvi Sahib’s head. During the wintertime, with his head covered by caps or other headgear, Moulvi Sahib was unaware of what was going on, but during the summer he would often be bareheaded when he taught. And whenever he would pass his hand over his head he would ask his grandson Mohammad Yaqoob, “Mian Yaqoob where does this dust on my head come from?” Mian Yaqoob was himself a keen participant in this activity, and the neediest since generally Moulvi Sahib’s benevolence would be directed towards him. His simple answer would be, “Dada Jan, the birds have gone and built a nest in the roof, and that is where the dirt keeps falling from.” This response would silence poor Moulvi Sahib. Our lack of interest was such that we would have no idea about where our lesson had stopped the day before, and from which point we had to commence. When one of us would make such a blunder Moulvi Sahib would suggest that “Mian, at the end of the lesson put some Hing[12] on the page, you can then smell it and start your new lesson.” Moulvi Sahib would only teach a lesson once and when we had each completed our lesson for the day, all of us would head towards the orchards and open spaces. In this manner, frolicking and cavorting we would reach our homes by the afternoon. Our families would assume that the children had spent half the day being schooled and were now home. For a short period, these activities remained hidden from our families, but this was not the type of behaviour that could be kept secret for long; our diverse pranks and people’s complaints very soon revealed our pastimes. Walda Sahiba was now convinced that her plan to rehabilitate my schooling and education in Fatehpur was an impossibility, and in any case Chacha Marhoom had been consistent in his opposition to the Fatehpur option and had consistently been adamant that I be sent back to Delhi.\n\nThe 1877 Imperial Darbar was to be held in Delhi and people from all over were being drawn to the city because of this. My older brother Hakim Mehmood Ali also resolved to head that way and I was sent along with him. The reports that Chacha Marhoom had received, time and again, about my total disinterest and overall lack of progress had convinced him of the futility of expecting any kind of high-calibre scholarship from me. Consequently, it was decided that I be taught some English and Khushkhati (Urdu and Persian Calligraphy) in order to make me eligible for an office job and even if I was unable to achieve that, with Khushkhati I would have acquired a skill with which no one could remain unemployment even in those times. To learn English, in accordance with this plan, I was placed in the charge of Chacha Marhoom’s friend Munshi Inshaullah Khan Sahib who was at that time employed at the Sherista Permit and was well regarded as being proficient in the English language (within the Muslim community). For my Khushkhati lessons, I was tutored by Moulvi Raziuddin Ahmed Sahib son of Moulvi Salimuddin Khan Sahib (Marhoom) whose lineage traced back to Mir Nicha Kush (Marhoom) and who was one of the successors of the renowned Delhi calligrapher Mirza Obaidullah Baig. To attend my lessons with these two gentlemen, I had to go to the corner of Adina Baig Khan and Bulbuli Khana which were about two to two and a half miles from Habash Khan’s Phatak. My reading and writing skills might have increased by only a reasonable level but what I observed in the company of Moulvi Raziuddin Ahmed Sahib convinced me that excellence in a craft cannot survive without appreciation and value. Every skill has its mysteries and subtle points which have been gained over centuries of experimentations and these cannot be acquired or learnt without being taught by the Ustads[13]. This was an era in which neither the prolific perusal of reading or book-writing, particularly the skill of calligraphy, held the preeminent value and significance it had in previous times, but Moulvi Raziuddin Ahmed Sahib’s excellence in this area had made him its custodian not only in Delhi but in the entire north Hindustan. Moulvi Raziuddin Ahmed Sahib’s house was a centre for calligraphers from all over the city which included a venerated gentleman by the name of Moulvi Amiruddin, from the family of the Pesh Imams of the Jamia Masjid Delhi, himself a Master of Naskh Script and a prominent member of this select society. It was Moulvi Raziuddin Ahmed Sahib’s customary routine to emerge from within and enter his Diwan khana or reception-room at seven, seven-thirty, his servant would open the parcels of calligraphy stones and papers that had been sent from other cities for the purpose of transcribing and spread them out in the Diwan khana courtyard; thick bamboo qalams or pens, large ink-pots and all the various tools needed such as cutters and sharpeners were selectively and meticulously laid out on a carpet. On coming out of the house Moulvi Sahib would directly attend to these, he would examine and scrutinise every aspect, shape and size of the papers and stones and would write standing, sitting, or lying down as the task or situation necessitated. To write with such thick pens, in such a variety of positions and then to use such flourishing strokes for the sweep and curve of the letters, the drawing of parallel and equal circles while ensuring that the alphabets remained pleasing to the eyes was no easy undertaking. But Moulvi Sahib’s experience and God-given ability had made this task effortless and he used those stones and wrote on those papers which were often awkward and ill-shaped with the ease of someone writing on a slate. Moulvi Sahib would complete his work in approximately an hour’s time and then enter his Diwan khana and begin the task of reviewing and correcting his student’s work. The number of students, during the time I was going for my lessons, was never much, if my memory does not fail me, there were two or three other boys besides myself, one of them, whose name was perhaps Saeed Ahmed was the son of Hafiz Saeed Amiruddin Sahib. After the death of his father, he became the Imam of the Jamia Masjid in Delhi. Having examined his student’s efforts, he would get immersed in his own work. At times it would be a book, but more frequently he would transcribe qatats[14] which were often reproductions and copies of old masters such as Rashid Dailmi, Mir Hamad, Mir Ali and many others. These qatats after a few days of scrutiny and observation, of skill and technique, of practice and execution, would be completed in such a manner that even the most discerning and knowledgeable of observers would be unable to tell the original apart from the copy. For the residents of the city of Delhi, Moulvi Raziuddin Ahmed Sahib’s father Moulvi Salimuddin Khan Sahib was a mentor and patron, especially for the poor and vulnerable for whom he was (like) a blessing from God. Amongst the elite families of Delhi, there was no function, whether it be a wedding celebration or bereavement where Moulvi Salimuddin Khan Sahib’s help and assistance would not be sought. Often enough he was assigned the responsibility of ordering, buying and selling of Jewellery and other valuables and this he undertook and accomplished with great pleasure, manner and style. As is the case these days, selling rather than buying of objects was the dominant practice among the Muslim gentry, especially the sale of antique books and fine chinaware crockery. Through the constant sale of these goods, Moulvi Salimuddin Khan Sahib (Marhoom) had become an expert at this, and as such, much of the considerable demand for antique books and antique china-ware in Delhi was handled by him. In this context, many of the qatats rendered by Moulvi Raziuddin Ahmed Sahib would also be disseminated at a reasonable price.\n\nNonetheless, I had only been able to pursue my calligraphy writing for no more than a few months when the bustle and commotion of the Delhi Darbar ended, and in accordance with a plan devised between Moulvi Samiullah Khan Sahib and Chacha Marhoom (see the section on Moulvi Ali Ahmed Sahib (Marhoom), Chacha Marhoom personally took me along with him and admitted me at the Madrasah Uloom Aligarh. Since other than recognising and identifying the alphabets my knowledge of English was non-existent, I was admitted in the lowest grade, which in the manner of numbering in those days was called the new class. At the time that I joined the Madrasah, it had been functioning for about three to four years’ time and the students living at the Madrasah were no more than a hundred or a hundred and twenty-five in number.\n\nThere was a particular faction within the Muslim community that disagreed with Sir Syed Ahmed Khan’s religious thought, and because Sir Syed was the founder of the Madrasah, they were opposed to the Madrasah as well and incessantly sought to subvert and malign it. Sir Syed and his group’s endeavour was to see the Madrasah grow and flourish and for the nation to associate and unanimously accept it. In this significant venture, amongst all of Sir Syed’s supporters the most illustrious and eminent name, in my opinion, is that of Moulvi Samiullah Khan Sahib. I do not deny that Moulvi Mehdi Ali Sahib (Nawab Mohsin-ul-Mulk) and Moulvi Mushtaq Hussain Sahib (Nawab Waqar-ul-Mulk) were indeed instrumental in promoting the fame and reputation of the Madrasah in region of the Deccan, but in north Hind, Moulvi Mohammad Samiullah Khan Sahib was solely responsible for this undertaking and only he could accomplish it. Despite being a member of Sir Syed’s clique Moulvi Sahib was generally considered an exemplary Muslim and moved within that same select sphere of powerful officials and other elites and he undoubtedly commanded considerable influence and sway over people. When I reflect on the connections and affiliations of the students at the Madrasah in my time there, other than a few from the Deccan, I can think of no student whose admission had not been a direct result of Moulvi Sahib’s far and wide effort and determination. After all, this was the era when as to be expected in this community, from the perspective of the foolish, the uninformed and ignorant, admission at Aligarh Madrasah was considered an endorsement of irreligiosity and faithlessness, and of course the majority, regrettably were followers of this camp, and still are.\n\nOn entering the Madrasah, the people I had the opportunity of living with, spending day and night with were Mohammad Daud, Mirza Qaseem Beg, Mohammad Wajy, Mohammad Fazi, Mazhar Hussain Khan, Ahmed Mazim, Latif Hussain Khan, Yakut Khan and others.\n\nMohammad Daud and I arrived at the Madrasah the same year and were roommates for about five years. A native of Ambroha, his father was a legal attorney. Mohammad Daud was a very good-natured and principled man. Later he started writing poetry, some of his masnavis[15] are still remembered by the older students, a collection of masnavis were also printed. If I recollect clearly it was called “The Test of Friendship.” He was with me in school until Intermediate. On the other hand, all my other companions, one by one, got left behind, the reason being that I never failed an exam in any class. Up to Middle School, I kept moving up a grade every six months and after that on a yearly basis without variation. Mohammad Daud graduated two years after me, he reached the rank of Naib Tehsildar but sadly death cut short all possibilities of flourishing and prospering. He left behind a child who survived only a few years after him.\n\nMirza Qaseem Beg Chughtai’s ancestral home was Agra but due to the early death of his father, his upbringing and education was taken care of by his Chacha, Mirza Alf Beg who was an eminent bailiff at the Lucknow Supreme Court. The good-humoured natives of Lucknow referred to him as Bailiff Beg instead of Alf Beg. Mirza Qaseem Beg came to Aligarh after passing his Intermediate and was my class fellow through FA and BA and we both graduated together. After graduation, through Mr Beck Marhoom’s intercession the Collector at Aligarh took him on as his secretary for a short while, he was then nominated for the post of a Deputy Collector. After retirement he found employed in various Princely States, he passed away only a short while ago. At the time of his death, he left behind six boys and four girls. One of his son’s Mirza Azeem Beg Chughtai and a daughter Ismet gained considerable repute in Urdu writing, unfortunately, Mirza Qaseem Beg also passed away at a fairly early age.\n\nMohammad Wajy and Mohammad Fazi were the sons of Moulvi Omer Sheikh Siddiqui a Zamindar from the town of Ghosi in the district of Azamgarh. Mohammad Wajy was my class-mate and Mohammad Fazi a grade below. Neither of the two was able to graduate. After eight years of constant candidacy and effort, Mohammad Wajy became a Tehsildar and later a Deputy Collector. Mohammad Fazi too served efficiently in the Irrigation Department. Neither enjoyed a long life; I have been unable to obtain any information about their off-springs. In qasba Fathepur it was related that the family of Maulana Moulvi Abid Hussain Sahib Marhoom’s family came from this very qasba Ghosi and settled down in Fathepur. I have not had the opportunity to investigate this, but I would not be surprised if the Maulana’s family and my friends’ family were the same.\n\nMazhar Hussain Khan was a native of Gorakhpur. His father was the administrator of the notable and highly reputed District court there. The famous Tarik, intrinsic and extrinsic “Eighteen seventy-five” which is obviously Nineteen and obliquely Hijra is his compilation. From the beginning Mazhar Hussain Khan genuinely enjoyed listening to and narrating tales of theft and highway robbery, we all used to tease him about this, therefore, not surprisingly because of his interest and inclination he sought and found employment in the Police Force. He passed away after his retirement.\n\nMohammad Mazim was a resident of Charikot in the district of Azamgarh and a scion of an eminently learned family of Zamindars. His father Moulvi Mohammad Azeem Sahib and his grandfather Moulvi Najamuddin Sahib ranked among the well-known, established scholars of their times. Moulvi Mohammad Azeem Sahib was employed in Secretariat of the Ministry of Civil Works where he worked for many years. He was considered very learned in Islamic reasoning and claimed the right to propose his own interpretations, for instance, he believed that smoking a hookah or cigarettes did not annul one’s fast, as a result, he would keep his fasts but continue to smoke his cheroot throughout Ramazan. Many a time one discussed this topic with him but Moulvi Sahib remained steadfast to his belief to the end. His son Mohammad Mazim also displayed his family’s touchiness and stubbornness. I had managed, based on his entitlement as his father’s son, to obtain an official post for him in the Secretariat of the Ministry of Civil Works, but as in his studies he did not show much interest in his work and after a few days took leave to return to his vatan and did not come back. He passed away there at a young age.\n\nLatif Hussain Khan Sahib was actually from Shikarpur in the district of Bulandshahr, but his family had lived in Aligarh for a long time. Initially, he was a “day scholar”, but for a while, he also lived in the boarding-house. He was an extremely good-natured man. His recitation of the soos[16]was quite outstanding. He also wrote poetry. He was an administrator in the UP Judicial Courts and passed away after retirement.\n\nYaqut Khan was an Afghan and a native of the Sarhadi region. His father was a prominent dry-fruit trader. Not that he gained much in terms of education, but he did remain at the Madrasah for quite a long time. He was employed by the Kothwali at Bala Hissar where he attained the post of Inspector before his untimely death.\n\nIf I were to write about the lives and activities of all those who were my peers or classmates at the Madrasah and narratives of all the events and incidents that took place at that time that in itself would stretch into a lengthy volume. It is enough therefore to mention a few close friends.\n\nSyed Abid al-Rauf was a Justice at the Punjab High Court and is by the grace of God is still going strong. Mohammad Yaqoob Shah Khan (Marhoom), Sahibzadas Sultan Ahmed and Aftab Ahmed Khan (Barrister), Sheikh Inayatullah (B.A) Ibn Munshi Zakaullah Sahib (Marhoom), and Syed Mohammad Ali, Syed Mehmood Ali (Marhoom) and Syed Hamid Ali who was a maternal grandson of Syed Ahmed Khan. Moulvi Sakafat Hussain Marhoom Barouli, Mir Vilayet Hussain Sahib, Syed Kalan and Qamarumarun. Syed Zainuddin who served as a Collector in the United Provinces for a long time was a very religious man, he passed away only recently. Nawab Islam Mohammad Khan who was Superintend Police in UP, and Sarfraz Khan and Sarfaraz Baksh etc.\n\nIn short, those were the best years of my life. The pleasant amiability of college companions, the overflowing affectionate kindness of Madrasah friends and teachers had captivated and engrossed me to the extent that I was oblivious to the wider world and events. It was during my student years that Maulana Shibli Marhoom was appointed Professor of Farsi at Aligarh College. Maulana’s engaging and enlightening presence drew some of us students towards poetry and poetic works and I too was a keen participant in this. In those days I wrote incomplete and fragmented verses in both Farsi and Urdu. Some of my Urdu poems that were written on subjects and topics current at that time became exceedingly popular at the Madrasah. Once Master Bakhtawar Lal, who was an acclaimed and highly respected teacher and an extremely good-natured individual gave our class some verses to analyse. Several students were unable to this and I was amongst them. The other boys were admonished, scolded and let off but I was ordered to stand for half an hour. I respectfully asked, “Sir, why have I been singled out for this punishment?” Master Sahib laughed and read out a few verses of “An April Fool” and replied “An individual who can write such verses and then is unable to explain these? The punishment is for apathy and inattentiveness.” I responded, “In the first place, there is no proof that these verses are mine, in the second place it is not necessary that a person who can write lyrics in Urdu can analyse English poetry as well.” Master Bakhtawar Lal replied, “Okay beta, go ahead and recite the entire poem.” I replied that I did not remember the entire poem, however, some boys did, and they obligingly recited it. Master Sahib explained that some verses revealed an adroit poetic quality and the picture they painted was indeed adept in its formation.\n\nAmongst my close friends in my vatan were several kinsmen and brethren such as Azizi Mohammad Yusuf, Azizi Mohammad Rafi, Azizi Ali Azfar and Azizi Azimuddin and brethren Khurshid Ahmed Sahib Khawar. My eagerness to meet them can be inferred from the following incident. When Aligarh Madrasah shut down for the summer vacations I immediately left for home, it was twelve noon when I disembarked at Barabanki Train Station, in those days there was no train up to Fathepur and one had to take yakas [17]from Barabanki to Fathepur. By coincidence the day I arrived the Satrikh Mela was underway and all the carriages had been commandeered by travellers to transport them to Satrikh. I was so consumed with my zeal and keaness to be home with my friends that heedless to the intense heat of the afternoon sun in the month of Jyestha [18] I deposited my baggage with a potter and started off on foot. By the time I got to Dewa, I was in a horrible, sorry state and the painful blisters that had formed on my feet made it impossible for me to take another step. My youngest Mumani Sahiba, the wife of Moulvi Amjad Ali Sahib was in Dewa at that time and it had been my normal practice, on my way back and forth from Barabanki, to stop over and pay my respects to her but this time my attendance was perforce fated. Mumani Sahiba scolded and admonished me for my foolishness and recklessness. She had me bathed immediately and applied medicated balm to my blistered feet. At that point, I did not experience acute pain but later that night I developed a high fever. The result of my impatience and haste was that instead of reaching Fathepur the same day as I intended, I arrived there four days later, and instead of turning up on foot or in a yaka, on the shoulders of kahars [19] seated in a palanquin.\n\nIn those days, a month or a month and a half stay in Fathepur felt like a mere few days or even a few hours stay. Most of the hours were spent in the company of close friends; eating, drinking, sitting around, getting around, all took place together. Fazal Chacha, Hakeem Moulvi Fazalullah Sahib (Marhoom) who was an elder amongst elders and a child amongst children would sometimes participate in our gatherings and would delight us with his entertaining conversation. In the evenings we would all gather at some relative’s house or the other where we would experience and revel in the affectionate kindness and regard of our seniors and elders, the warm-hearted friendliness of our peers and the delightful chatter of the younger children. Ultimately this period was one of such enjoyment and contentment that one would never be destined to experience again, nor hope for any possibility of in the future. To leave this company behind and return to the Madrasah was sheer predition. But the consequence of my comings and goings, of engaging and fraternising had an impact if not on the entire clan, on at least on those close to me; it brought about a change in their approach to progressive education, an added inclination towards learning, and a thought process that gained a wider scope in expanse and tolerance. In fact, there were still people at that time who considered the very learning of the English language heresy. Therefore, on hearing the fact of my admission to Aligarh Madrasah, Chacha Jan, Moulvi Hakeem Masoom Ali Sahib Meh (Marhoom), wrote a lengthy and protracted letter to Chacha Marhoom (Moulvi Ali Ahmed Sahib Marhoom) in which he quoted a hadith and placing a great deal of emphasis on it’s interpretation he maintained that, “The blame and responsibility of turning this child into a non-believer with his blind irreligiosity lies on your head.” How could Chacha Marhoom, who was himself personally familiar with the (Madrasah) student’s fulfilment of their religious duties and the arrangements made for their religious education accept that mere entry to the Madrasah could destroy an individual’s religious faith? But those people who were not acquainted with the actual situation were likely to be subject to such erroneous notions. Because people’s view of English education and particularly their perception of Aligarh Madrasah was so distorted, my every utterance and action was viewed as presenting proof of their pre-conceived assumption. It so happened, that once when I was home in my vatan, during the Madrasah’s summer vacation, Barey Mamo (Moulvi Abbas Ali Sahib Marhoom) and Shanglay Mamo (Moulvi Nawazish Ali Sahib Marhoom) were sitting at home one evening discussing some matter regarding Tibb, I too was present at the gathering. Moulvi Nawazish Ali delineated the four types of Tibb, Tibb Nabvi[20], Tibb Unani[21], Tibb Angerezi[22], and Tibb Vedic[23]. At this, I remarked that Tibb Nabvi should not be included in these categories since it is not based on established principles. It is indeed narrated that some people would approach the Last Prophet and complain about certain diseases, and he, with respect to their habits and the air and environmental conditions of that country would recommend the use of certain medications. Accordingly, these medicines are mentioned in the hadith and a certain gentleman collected and compiled and named them Tibb Nabvi, it is not, however, a special method of treatment. I had only to mention this that Shanglay Mamo lost his temper and launched into a protracted argument while reiterating that Tibb Nabvi like the other Tibbi practices has its special method of treatment and is moreover superior to all the others. I responded that if that was so then it should similarly possess the means to treat all ailments which is clearly not the case. In short, this altercation got to be long-drawn-out and Mamo Sahib in his rage branded and condemned me as a misguided nonbeliever who had been led astray and much more. Seeing the direction this was taking I became totally silent. My Phupi Sahiba who was present in the house came in, took my hand and led me away. By the morning this incident was being talked about in every house. Some good-humoured individuals also spread the rumour that Moulvi Nawazish Ali Sahib would not accept me as his son-in-law until I renounced my false beliefs before the entire gathering at the time of my Nikah. Friends asked if such a demand was stipulated, what would I do? I replied, I am ready and willing to acknowledge what I regard as the truth in this matter not merely in one place but in a thousand places, and, I will never, ever accept any concept I consider to be erroneousness.\n\nAmongst the assets I carried back with me from the Madrasah to the vatan was an appreciation of Farsi poetry and verse as well as Maulana Shilbi’s erudite discourses on poetry. Certain friends and brethren who had the temperament and natural inclination towards versifying were encouraged and motivated by these discourses and some individuals such as Azizi Mohammad Yusuf and brethren Khurshid Ahmed Sahib Khawar and other began composing verses in Farsi and after a few days of practice penned commendable poetic compositions. Azizi Mohammad Rafi had prepared a notebook, whenever any amongst us verbalised a lyric he would enter and transcribe it in his notebook which he had named “Merka Sukhan”[24]. Although Azizi Mohammad Rafi did not himself compose poetry, he by no means lacked the familial fine perception and comprehension of good verse. And to tell the truth, he was the one who would through various means persuade us to compose our poems. This activity continued amicably for a considerable length of time, but after a few years, the thought occurred to me that if I do not put an end to this poetic competition it might eventually lead to animosity and resentment, as indeed ensued between Azizi Mohammad Yusuf and Bhai Khurshid Ahmed. Because of this I stopped composing poetry within this gathering and removed all my previous compositions from the notebook. These writings remained safely with me as a remembrance, and in certain ways, in spite of their many flaws and shortcomings were not without their charm. During my Lucknow sojourn, about which I will write at length later, a trunk of mine was stolen that contained besides many valuable effects, all my certificates and various important papers as well as these unique and old compositions. All were forever lost and wasted.\n\nIn 1885 I sat for my Intermediate Exam and that same year I married the daughter of my Shanglay Mamo, Bibi Majida. Although it had been my firm intention not to marry until I had completed my education and procured a job, however being engaged, and then that too within one’s family; it is to be expected that all such plans will invariably fail and must perforce be revised since they are never likely to succeed. Subsequently, that is what happened in my case as well. Munshi Abid al-Samad Sahib, the only son of Shanglay Mamo, an excellent and worthy young man passed away after an extended illness. Family circumstances demanded that both his daughters be married at the same time and as soon as possible. The younger daughter was engaged to Munshi Aleemullah of Dewa and they too were demanding an early marriage. This issue involved one’s brethren and relatives, it was not just my mother and my brother, but our entire clan that was insistent on this. Under the circumstances, it was impossible for me to get my way in this matter. However, after my marriage, I continued with my education, so much so that in 1889 I passed my B.A. Exam. This was the first exam held at Allahabad University and we all had to go to Allahabad for it. The Principal of Aligarh College was Mr Theodore Beck. Mr Beck was one of those conscientious and noble-minded Englishmen, who though born in England, once having entered and lived in Hindustan for an extensive period of time had closed all exit doors. From the start I was amongst his very favourite students, he called me gentle Masood and was always extraordinarily supportive and solicitous. Once, when I came down with a bout of diphtheria, he would check on me twice a day and throughout my illness would bring with him specially prepared food and drink that could not be made at the Madrasah and ensure I ate and drank them before he left. In other words, he showered more compassion and consideration on his students than any teacher possibly could. When the examination results were announced I was at Aligarh and some of us (students) went together to meet Beck Sahib. Beck Sahib’s joy was a sight to behold. He questioned each of us in great detail about our future plans; about me, it was settled that I would spend my vacation wherever I wanted, but I was to report to the college on the day it reopened. There was a vacancy for a teacher in the school at Rupees 200 a month, for which I would be nominated, I would have to live at the college and would have the responsibility of supervising some of the smaller boys and in return. I would not be charged for board and lodging. Moreover, my appointment as a lecturer would allow me to prepare for the Allahabad High Court Law Exam. Thus, after the summer vacations, in accordance with this plan, and after reviewing the tasks consigned to me, I began my work. During the winter vacations, Beck Sahib took a trip down to Hyderabad Deccan and although the era of the Honourable Nawab Liaq Ali Khan (Marhoom ) Prime Minister of the Mehboob Shahi State had ended its effects were still evident. Every minister and every official considered it essential that he maintain a high (Indian/Eastern) standard of living befitting his rank and office. Beck Sahib was a guest of Nawab Imad-ul-Mulk Syed Hussain Sahib Bilgrami (Marhoom) and as a Principal of a Muslim College, he was regaled with great hospitality, honoured and feted. For the first in his life, he had the opportunity to experience the splendour and grandeur of the Mushraqi (eastern) aristocrats lifestyles and the resplendent magnificence of their attire. His admiration and the profound impression it left on him was such that he enjoyed talking about it for a long time thereafter. Hyderabad’s weather and climate, Hyderabad’s sights and vistas, Hyderabadi officials’ style and mode of living, Hyderabadi apparel and clothing, Hyderabadi festivals and banquets, in short, there was nothing that he did not like.\n\nIt was not long after Beck Sahib’s return that Sir Asman Jah (Marhoom), at that time the Secretary of Justice in Hyderabad State, on his way back from Shimla where he had gone for some work, decided to make a stop-over at Aligarh to observe the working of the Madrasah. He was accompanied by his associates Moulvi Mushtaq Hussain Sahib, Viqar-ul-Mulk, Secretary Revenue, and Moulvi Mehdi Hasan Sahib, Fateh Nawaz Jung, Secretary Home-Department. That evening these two gentlemen came down to the Cricket field to watch a match being played between two groups of college boys. Syed Mehmood Ali (Marhoom) was the bowler and I was batting; Moulvi Mehdi Hasan Sahib asked who the young man on the crease was, and someone apprised him with my name, vatan, and so on. Moulvi Sahib stayed for a bit and then left, but before doing so instructed the boys to inform me, when I came back, that I was to go meet him at Sir Syed’s house that very evening. When I completed my inning and came back the boys briefed me of this exchange. Since I was not too familiar with Moulvi Mehdi Hasan Sahib other knowing than that he was from Fathepur, I was unsure if I should go or not. Several friends were of the opinion that I should most certainly go, consequently after the Maghreb prayers I arrived at Sir Syed’s house. After inquiring at length and in great detail about my life he informed me that he needed a translator for his office in Hyderabad, and although he also had advertisements put out for that position over there he had been unable to find a fitting or suitable candidate so far. I politely responded that I could not make a decision without consulting and discussing the matter with Beck Sahib and others.\n\nFrom there I went straight to Beck Sahib’s bungalow and related the entire account. Beck Sahib disclosed that “later that evening there is a dinner at Sir Syed’s where I will be meet Moulvi Mehdi Hasan Sahib and will confer with him on this issue. Come and see me tomorrow morning.” I do not know what transpired in that conversation between Beck Sahib and Moulvi Mehdi Hasan Sahib, but the next morning when I met Beck Sahib I was told that “All the preliminaries have been worked out, the salary for that position is Rupees 200 per month with good prospects for promotion. Moulvi Mehdi Hasan Sahib will put forward a formal proposal to the Madrasah to take you away. In my opinion, you should definitely accept the position. Furthermore, Hyderabad is an interesting place, and a Muslim Principality. But, Sir Syed, it appears, is opposed to your going, let us see what happens after the proposal is presented. In the meantime, I will discuss this subject with him again.”\n\nVery soon after that dinner, Sir Asman Jah’s party left for Hyderabad and things were left up in the air. About fifteen days after this episode, Moulvi Mehdi Hasan Sahib’s formal proposal was received. As promised Beck Sahib conferred with Sir Syed on this issue. Sir Syed remained resolutely steadfast in his opinion, but after a lengthy exchange proclaimed, “If you want to send him and he himself wants to go, I will not object to it, but send him to me and I will explain all the issues to him one time, then you and he have my permission to proceed.” This was no exceptional demand, but Sir Syed’s awe-inspiring and imposing personality had such an effect on all of us that when following Beck Sahib’s directive, I arrived at Sir Syed’s kothi, my face was flushed, and my heart was thumping furiously. On being informed of my arrival Sir Syed summoned me inside where, as was his custom, he was seated on a charpoy with a table drawn up next to it on which he was writing something. He gestured towards me and I sat down on a chair, he put his pen down and turning his attention towards me declared, “I am well acquainted with this entire business; it was only a short while ago that Beck Sahib came back from Hyderabad, he is totally enamoured by the undisputable magnificence and grandeur, the sociability and cordiality that he encountered there, but he no inkling or knowledge of the internal state of affairs or the intrigue and squabbles amongst the officials. The salary that Mehdi Hasan has offered you is totally inadequate for your expenses there. What will happen is this, you will have to take a small house on rent in the city to live in, and since you will be unable to afford a cook on this salary you will have to keep a maid and the distance and separation from wife and family and the inherent loneliness of your situation, will make the formation of an adulterous relationship inevitable and that is only natural. Other than all these things, the issue of mulki or ghairmulki[25] is such that no matter how hard and with how much honesty a man may strive, he cannot in truth hold out any expectations for advancement. On the contrary, here there are plenty of possibilities and prospects for you, you possess a BA degree and are preparing for your High Court Exam if you pass getting you appointed as a Munsif will require no special effort. In this country, where at one time the department of Sheristadar in the law courts was heavily populated by Muslims, they have now been emptied (of them) and the government itself is sensible to this. After being made cognizant of all these circumstances, you now have the liberty to choose what you think is suitable for you. I am not opposed to your going to Hyderabad, nonetheless, I thought it appropriate to inform you of the conditions there.” At this, I replied, “Sir who can understand these issues better than you? And who else can counsel and guide me or be more considerate and caring towards me than you?” We were still thus conversing when Maulana Altaf Hussain Sahib Hali walked in and Sir Syed’s attention turned towards him, I offered my salaams and left.\n\nI went and recounted this entire discourse to Beck Sahib who replied, “Perhaps Sir Syed is not aware that I have already given Moulvi Mehdi Hasan my absolute assurance to send you, the matter has been decided and finalised and now there is no possibility of any reversal or change. I will talk to Sir Syed again about this, you should, however, prepare for your departure.”\n\nThe next day I received a note from Beck Sahib, he wrote that “I have clarified this issue with Sir Syed and he bids you farewell and God’s blessings. You should definitely leave by day after tomorrow. I gathered whatever items I could obtain hurriedly for my journey and on the 21st of February 1890 I set off in the direction of Hyderabad via Jabalpur. I had sent telegrams to Moulvi Mehdi Hasan Sahib and Bhai Khurshid Ahmed Sahib. Moulvi Mehdi Hasan Sahib sent his man to Hyderabad station for me and Bhai Khurshid Ahmed Sahib himself along with some friends came to the station to receive me. In those days Bhai Khurshid Ahmed practised law, he took me straight home with him to Shidi Amber Bazar where he then resided.\n\nThe next day I met Moulvi Mehdi Hasan Sahib and handed him the letter of recommendation that Beck Sahib had sent. Moulvi Mehdi Hasan Sahib greeted me with great courtesy and conversed with me on various subjects for a considerable length of time. During the course of this conversation, he asked me if I had seen the letter Beck Sahib has written about you? When I replied in the negative he gave me the letter to read. Beck Sahib had written briefly about Sir Syed’s opposition, and, about me, he had, with great affection used words of praise that I, in reality, did not consider myself deserving of. Having read the letter, I returned it to Moulvi Mehdi Hasan Sahib who remarked, “My expectation is that you will prove yourself just as Beck Sahib has written.” During this meeting, it was agreed that I should go to the office today and sign in my attendance, and by tomorrow shift to his house. Consequently, I followed up accordingly. In those days, the Home Office was located in the building that later became famous as Abid ki dukaan.\n\nDuring my time in Hyderabad, I have seen many ministries, but the reality of the fact is there has never been a ministry better than that of Sir Asman Jah. Although Sir Asman Jah Marhoom was the least educated amongst all those Ministers that I came across, he, however, possessed an innate perception and knowledge of people’s qualities, and the faculty and capacity to understand others, and most important of all there was a resolute firmness and stability in his character. With much observation and discerning insight he had chosen Moulvi Mushtaq Hussain Sahib, Nawab Viqar-ul-Mulk, as his deputy and had left the entire running of the State to him; the result was that everything worked according to a methodical system and every official was well-versed with the policies of the government and would accordingly strive towards implementing these. They also knew that the administrator who held the reins of government kept a sharp eye on matters and was well aware of affairs and working of each department and official. Because of this, within a few days, the door to dishonesty was shut closed and the inertia that had beset all the departments was banished. However, Moulvi Mushtaq Hussain Sahib’s extraordinary governance and his strict administration provided the ammunition required for the growth of a large, nation-wide opposition that included not just officials but also a group of Jagirdars as well. The participation of the Jagirdars was a result of the regulations Moulvi Mushtaq Hussain Sahib sought to impose on them, he was also inclined to ignore the basis and source of the endowment granted to these individuals. And so, when I began my employment, there were two opposing factions of office-holders, one that supported and sided with the current government and the other that was averse to it. The later faction included Sir Khurshid Jah (Marhoom), Nawab Sarwar Jung (Marhoom), Mohsin-ul-Mulk (Marhoom), Moulvi Syed Ali Bilgrami, Akbar Jung and other State office-holders. Relationships had got strained to such an extreme level that those employed by the government were afraid to meet those considered antagonistic to the government. I, of course, was unfamiliar with this state of affairs. Because of our prior acquaintanceship Moulvi Abid ul-Ghani Sahib, son of Maulana Moulvi Ahmed Ali Sahib Muhaddis Saharanpuri, a senior alumnus of our college had started visiting me regularly. Often, he would come by in the evening and we would go for a walk together. One evening as we strolled past Mohsin ul-Mulk’s house Moulvi Abid ul-Ghani Sahib said to me, “You have now been here for quite a while, but you haven’t yet met Nawab Mohsin-ul-Mulk Bahadur.” I replied, “Immediately after arriving I went to see Mirza Nasir Beg Sahib (Nasir Jung Marhoom), I met him, and he invited me to dinner as well, but I haven’t had an opportunity to meet Nawab Mohsin-ul-Mulk. He responded, “Come let me introduce you to Nawab Sahib, this is a good time to meet him.” Without giving it any thought or consideration, I went along with him. It was summertime and Nawab Sahib was seated all by himself on the terrace of his house. Moulvi Abid ul-Ghani Sahib introduced me; Nawab Sahib while pursuing his education had himself lived in qasba Dewa and was to some extent familiar with the shurfa of Fathepur. Nawab Sahib’s quick-wit, affability and ebullience were such that it was impossible for anyone not to fall under his magical spell and be captivated by his charm. The government at that time had more or less curtailed all his powers, the Office of Finance existed only in name, every secretary would present the financial matters himself to the concerned department and on acceptance would issue the directive. Once the decree was issued, an exact copy of the ordinance requested would be sent to the Department of Finance for entry into the records. Perhaps Moulvi Sahib might not have verbalised it, but the greatest injustice being inflicted on him was that visits by people especially State officials were viewed disapprovingly. Nawab Sahib possessed a warm-hearted personality and this avoidance and holding back was exceedingly distressful to him. Therefore, anyone who continued to pay him constant visits was considered a blessing and was accorded extraordinary attention. Moulvi Abid ul-Ghani Sahib would deliver the letters sent by Sir Syed’s to both gentlemen, i.e. Moulvi Mushtaq Hussain Sahib (Viqar-ul-Mulk) and Moulvi Mehdi Ali Sahib (Mohsin-ul-Mulk). But as was his habit and style, Mohsin ul-Mulk’s natural charisma and conduct towards him had made him into an admirer and a regular visitor at Nawab Sahib’s. After this what was one to expect from the current government at that time? Consequently, Viqar-ul-Mulk told him in plain words that, “There is nothing more that I can do for you.” Although I had now been in Hyderabad for quite some time, my nature and temperament was such that I had remained basically oblivious to all these factional issues and such matters. When I was leaving, the undoubtedly sagacious Moulvi Mehdi Ali Sahib cautioned me that, “Your superiors will not approve of your coming here, but if there is no interference from them on this account then you can come see me whenever you like.” I replied, “I will indeed continue to come and go and deem your scholarly company my good fortune.”\n\nIn those days Moulvi Mehdi Ali Sahib spent most of his time in the perusal of books and these were predominantly the topic of discussion when I was in his company. I had probably meet Moulvi Sahib no more than three or four times when information of my visits reached Moulvi Mushtaq Hussain Sahib. Since the Chief of the Police, Akbar Jung was not a supporter of the current government Moulvi Mushtaq Hussain Sahib did not receive any intelligence reports from that office, consequently, Moulvi Sahib had himself set up his own spy network and through this he would obtain this kind of information which would be reported directly to him. On receiving word of my vists he complained about it to Moulvi Mehdi Hasan Sahib (Fateh Nawaz Jung) at a dinner at the Nizam Club. Moulvi Mehdi Hasan Sahib came back from dinner around eleven, eleven-thirty and sent for me. The manservant informed him that I had gone to sleep and was told to “wake him up and bring him here.” In such matters, Moulvi Mehdi Hasan Sahib was totally oblivious to the discomfort of others. I went in rubbing my eyes; he was in the drawing-room changing his clothes. Sheikh Shujaat Ali Sahib, who was Moulvi Mehdi Hasan Sahib’s childhood friend was also present. Moulvi Sahib told me to sit down and I seated myself on a chair. He asked, “Is it true that you are a regular visitor at Moulvi Mehdi Ali Sahib’s?” I replied, “Actually, I am not a regular visitor anywhere, but it is true that I have paid Nawab Sahib a visit perhaps two or three times.” He retorted, “You are well aware that he is strongly opposed to the present government, and Moulvi Mushtaq Hussain Sahib will not countenance the fact that an individual who is well acquainted with classified official matters should be a regular guest at Moulvi Mehdi Ali Sahib’s.” I am not in the habit of offering sharp retorts, especially to my elders and superiors, but at that moment, in my overwrought, upset state, I replied in a somewhat insolent tone, “In the first place I was not aware that Moulvi Mushtaq Hussain Sahib does not approve of anyone visiting Moulvi Mehdi Ali Sahib. secondly, I have heard that he himself regularly visits Moulvi Mehdi Ali Sahib, and it a strange thing that while he himself can meet him, others should refrain from doing so. Thirdly, I am a translator in the Home Office, I am not privy to any confidential material, so there is no danger of any disclosure of secrets. There remains the fact that a few times Moulvi Mehdi Ali Sahib has summoned me to assist him in some translations, this is not included in my official duties and if you so desires this activity can easily be stopped. And clearly, the issue is that for his excellency, the honourable Maulana, to entrust such an individual with confidential tasks whose actions have to be watched and curtailed and whose honesty cannot be depended does not appear to be appropriate.” Noticing my trembling lips, flushed face and the tone of my voice, Sheikh Shujaat Ali Sahib, who was a scion of the Lucknow Sheikhzadas and one of our brethren said to me, “You are offended, but all that Nawab Sahib has said has been offered by the way of counsel and advice. You should leave now, I will discuss this issue with you myself some other time.” This is what I wanted as well, I got up and left. After that, Sheikh Shujaat Ali Sahib did not bring up this matter again, but I now understood the tenor of these people and I reduced my visits to Nawab Mohsin ul-Mulk’s.\n\nMoulvi Mehdi Hasan Sahib was not a very highly educated man, but he was extremely intelligent and astute, and his administrative skills were outstanding. Within a short period, he had transformed the Home Office in such a manner that it was counted amongst the best-run offices in the government. In those days the Department of Law, Police, Committees, Registration of Stamps, Education and others, the Mint and the Court of Wards were all associated with this office. To ensure efficiency and good-management, Nawab Sahib had devised numerous rules and regulations and promulgated them through resolutions. He had also gathered together a group of intelligent and proficient officials. Since I was his protégé and lived in his house he reposed great trust in me. One day he asked me about a particular officer, the standard of the work he did and what his opinion of Nawab Sahib was. I said, “He does his work with great diligence but what his perception of you is, I have no knowledge of that.” At this Nawab Sahib made a face and said, “We get no help from you in such matters, nor attain any account of things at the office.” I did not care for the manner in which he asked this, I responded, “From the time I enter the office, I am absorbed in my assigned work and have no time to socialise with co-workers or ask about their views or issues, and even if did I doubt if I could carry out this task. Such and such Munshi Sahib is suitable for that.” My answer did not meet with approval, he declared that “What is a man who lives his life with his eyes shut? The only difference between a living being and a dead one is one sees and hears and the other neither sees nor hears.” I thought it better not to extend this argument and remained silent. But thanks be to God, I never let myself be drawn into these espionage undertakings that Nawab Sahib expected of me. As a consequence of this clash of personalities, the type of relationship that ought to have developed between Nawab Sahib and me could not be established. But in spite of these differences and our natural dispositions, all of Nawab Sahib’s confidential papers were in my custody and whenever he went on his tours and trips he took me with him.\n\nThus when he took a month-long leave to visit Hindustan I accompanied him there. Numerous noteworthy events made this journey a memorable one. At that time Nawab Fateh Nawaz Jung’s star was at its apex. Not only was he the Home Office Minister and Chief Justice of Hyderabad he was also the State Director of the Railways and Mineralogy. In those days the Director of the Nizami Government State Railway had a special carriage allocated for his use which was richly furnished with red velvet seats, mirrors, tables and chairs. The State Director could use this for both official trips as well as personal ones. This carriage was used throughout for our entire journey. At that time Syed Mahmud was a Judge at the Allahabad High Court and Sir Syed Ahmed Khan Sahib (Marhoom) was staying there with his son. Ross Masood was very young and I saw him for the first time. I picked him up and placed him on my knee, on seeing Ross Masood on my lap Sir Syed remarked, “One had heard of Kiran-al-Saeeddin[26], but this is Kiran -al- Masooduddin.” We stayed in Allahabad for only two days. During our Lucknow sojourn Moulvi Mehdi Hasan Sahib paid a visit to Raja Kazim Hussain Khan Sahib, Rais of Bahatwamau at Kaiser Bagh, I accompanied him there. Raja Sahib asked me my name and I complied, he then inquired about my father’s name to which I replied that “It was unlikely that you, sir, would be acquainted my father since he lived his entire life in Delhi.” On my mentioning Delhi, Raja Sahib persisted, “Tell me his name?” When I told him the name he summoned me to approach him and embraced me with great warmth and said, “Perhaps you are not aware of the kinship that exists between us.” He then provided a lengthy explanation of our shared genealogy. (In spite of the close kinship, it appears that religious differences i.e. Sunni-Shia, have kept the two families from further marriage connections.)\n\nIt was not long after our return from this journey that Moulvi Dastagir Sahib, the manager of Nawab Iftikhar-ul-Mulk, Mukhtar-ud-Duala Sahab Jung Bahadur, Minister of Police passed away and this post became vacant. After a prolonged exchange of confidential correspondence between Fateh Nawaz Jung and Nawab Sahab Jung, my nomination for this position was announced. As a result of this, I now earned two hundred and fifty Rupees instead or two hundred Rupees. This appointment, unfortunately, had such a profound impact that I was unable to gain any relief from financial difficulties till almost the very end of my career and it consistently created obstacles and impediments in my advancements and my earnings. Nawab Sahab Jung Bahadur was a close relative of Sir Salar Jung 1 (Mir Turab Ali Khan Marhoom) and was a nobleman with a reserved disposition and reticent habits. If one were to write down his life, an entire book and that too a very engaging book could be composed. But for my purpose, it would suffice to say that Nawab Sahib rarely ventured out other than for specific and necessary reasons and would, for the most part, seldom meet people. If an official found it necessary to meet him for some reason, he would have to first write and procure an appointment time. Generally, Nawab Sahib would see people at night; during the day he would sleep or spend his time in solitude. There was a fixed time and procedure for every task. His assistant was instructed to complete his work at the office secretariat and on completion of the day’s work collect and compile all the papers neatly in a prescribed order and sent them across. Since assembling the day’s paperwork was not a substantial task, with Nawab Sahib’s permission all the secretariat work of the Departments of Police, Postal Services, Registration and Stamps, Mint, Religious Affairs and others were delegated and handed over to me. These tasks I continued to execute in this manner year after year and when the any of the Departmental Secretaries left I would take on their management as well, and at times this would continue for months on end. Consequently, Nawab Sahab Jung Bahadur had come to trust and rely on me to such an extent that he would not agree to release me. Eventually, this reliance and confidence on me instead of being a blessing and asset became a hindrance and disadvantage for me. I could neither benefit in any way from leaving his direct employment nor did any Secretary have the courage to extricate me from this Amir and promote and assign me to another governmental department. Albeit, all the Secretaries I had the opportunity to work with were unanimous in the opinion that I was worthy of a promotion. Some head of Departments such as Nawab Imad-ul-Mulk Marhoom (Moulvi Syed Husain Bilgrami Sahib), Secretary of Education and Moulvi Mir Afzal Husain Sahib, Supreme Court Justice both attempted several times to induct me into their departments, but Nawab Sahab Jung Bahadur would not comply. In light of this situation, I realised that even though I would have to continue to report to Nawab Sahib I could at least change my Secretariat affiliations from the offices of Law, Police and Public works, and thus perhaps a change for the better would be possible in the future. In those days Moulvi Mir Kazim Ali Sahib was the Secretary of Building and Construction, the position of his assistant was vacant, and I decided to try and apply for the post and with difficulty managed to convince Nawab Sahab Jung Bahadur to send in my application to the Department of Building and Construction. This Department was also under Nawab Sahib’s jurisdiction, because of that, although with great reluctance, he agreed to this proposal. And although he sent in my application he did not back it up in any way. Moulvi Mir Kazim Ali Sahib was one of those exceedingly cautious people who undertake every action after a great deal of contemplation and thought and would ponder each and every item for months at a time. However, he was close to several our family members and was an old friend of Haji Raizuddin Sahib, Tehsildar, Hafiz Mohammad Bashir Sahib, Superintend of Police, and Hakeem Mohammad Rashid Sahib (2nd) Taluqedar, and also knew me well. But even in this case, he deliberated in his usual manner. The Right Honourable Sir Maharaja Yamin-us Sultanate Kishen Pershad Bahadur was the Prime Minister and because he and Nawab Sahab Jung Bahadur were not on amicable terms I assumed that it was his prevarication that had put this matter on hold. But in fact, this was not the case and Sir Maharaj himself told me during a conversation that, “I am prepared to do whatever is necessary for you, but your Nawab Sahib is determined that you will not be transferred from the Ministry of Law and Police. Several times he has spoken to me about this matter on a personal level, nevertheless, I have written to him that it is preposterous that you are thwarting the advancement of an individual who has spent a considerable segment of his life in your service and whose abilities and proficiency you yourself have lauded.” Ultimately, after almost one year of negotiations and through Sir Maharaja Bahadur’s mediation my application was accepted. But with the caveat that I would continue as Nawab Sahib’s assistant. In this manner after almost fifteen years of working in the Office of the Secretariat of Law, I was finally detached from it.\n\nOver this long period of time I had occasion to work with the following Minsters; Nawab Fateh Nawaz Jung, Imad Jung 1, Mr Hormasji N. Vakil, Nawab Sarbuland Jung Bahadur, Moulvi Aziz Mirza Sahib, Nawab Nizamat Jung Bahadur. The way I executed my work in this Ministry, and the trust that was placed in me and my work can be measured by the remarks that Mr Hormasji N. Vakil wrote about me at the time his assessment of the Secretariat and which are likely to be amongst the old archival records of the concerned office. “The manner in which Masood Ali has worked with me, the competence and integrity with which he has fulfilled his obligations makes it essential for me to recognise and acknowledge his contribution, and I have no hesitation in declaring that without his help I would not have for a moment been able to complete the crucial tasks of the Secretariat.” A fact worth noting is that Mr Hormasji N. Vakil had been educated in Britain and was amongst Bombay’s most highly regarded legal professionals. In my opinion, there has not been an Advisor as capable as him since. During his tenure at the Secretariat he shut down the Department of Thugee and Dacoit, and it is difficult to find another example of the tactfulness with which he negotiated with the Government of India about the important issues of Stamp and Coinage. If I were to write about the comportment of the other Secretaries towards me this tale will get exceedingly lengthy and serve no purpose either. All this that has flowed from my pen is self-explanatory in itself.\n\nAfter my transfer to the Department of Building and Construction, my association was with Moulvi Mir Kazim Ali Sahib who reposed the same confidence and trust in me as had the Department of Law and Police. But around this time, Moulvi Mir Kazim Ali Sahib took three months of sick leave having written to the Government that, “for the Department to continue functioning it is imperative that instead of the Chief Engineer or any other individual, Masood Ali be appointed administrator since I have total credence in his abilities.” This was accordingly approved by the Government. At that time, Mr Muraj was the Chief Engineer and he considered this post his prerogative and there is no doubt that he was senior to me in terms of emolument. Understandably this move was objectionable to him, furthermore, he thought I had a part in depriving him of his due, although in fact, this perception was entirely erroneous since I had not the least knowledge about the proceedings undertaken by Moulvi Mir Kazim Ali Sahib to obtain this managerial appointed for me. He had personally penned the request and had himself gone in person to obtain the acceptance. In those days, in matters of governance, nothing could be done in the entire Kingdom without the council, advice and approval of Mr Walker.[27] Moulvi Mir Kazim Ali Sahib was an official of the old-school and it was impossible for him and Mr Walker to see eye-to-eye and this was reason enough for him to detach himself through early retirement.\n\nAlthough Moulvi Sahib was considered an exceptionally conscientious and well-regarded civil servant, his recommendation was not followed and after his departure Mr Muraj was appointed in his place. Mr Muraj was a native of Bombay and educated in England, he was among the remarkably good-natured and friendly people of this world and his relationship with me was always excellent. He was also a man of great compassion and generosity, but some of his unscrupulous acquaintances and subordinates began to take undue advantage of this kindliness and began meddling and interrupting the flow of office activities and work. When I tried to stop this, my endeavour merely brought their ire down on me and they began to persuade him that, “You have no importance in this office, no standing or respect, the only with any who carries any weight is Masood Ali, whatever he wants is done. Appearing trustworthy he will first offer you helpful suggestions, if you concur, well and good, if you disagree then he will in his presentation manage to get it blocked by Nawab Moin Bahadur.” The nature of this false accusation was such that it took root in Mr Muraj’s heart. One day, Mr Muraj called me and related this entire affair to me and revealed the names of all those who had planted these ideas in his head and said to me that, “If you agree, and are not opposed to it, I can try and get you transferred from this Ministry.” I replied, “I will gladly accept your offer since there is can be no opportunity for my advancement here. But the appropriate thing to do first is to set to rest all those notions about me that have been conveyed to you, and the easiest way to do this is to instruct the office Manager Sahib to take out some records on file where our opinions on a matter were not in accord and see whose suggestions met with Nawab Moin al-Maham Bahadur’s approval. Accordingly, the Manager Sahib was summoned and appropriately briefed. He produced five cases-files amongst which Nawab Sahib agreed with the Honourable Secretary Sahib on four cases and only one in which he disagreed. Among these five files was the file regarding Ala-Hazrat’s Ooty Palace in which there were serious differences of opinion between me and Secretary Sahib. Ala-Hazrat Mir Mehboob Ali Khan had ordered a palace be built for him in Ooty and instructed that the Department of construction take charge of this. Secretary Sahib took this to mean that job should not only remain under the supervision of the Chief Engineer Construction’s office management without the input of other agencies. I deliberated, that in the first place, the order of undertaking the task did not connote that and it would not be proper to take the assistance of other managerial departments. I wrote several dissenting notes to this effect, but Secretary Sahib did not agree with me. I showed this file to Mr Muraj and told him that what if those ideas that have been put into your head had been true, then in this matter, where our opinions were clearly in conflict, I would have got Moin al-Maham Bahadur to write an order against your judgement, but this had clearly not been the case and Moin al-Maham has clearly sided with you on this issue. After seeing this Mr Muraj’s misgivings about me were removed, but I had understood the lay of affairs in the office and the daily meddling and interference of some of the lower officials and realized that to seek a transfer out was the appropriate thing to do and with some convincing managed to get Mr Muraj to agree to this.\n\nAt that time the position of Secretary of the Majlis-alee-Adalat was vacant due to the death of Nawab Zain ul-Abideen and with Mr Muraj’s commendation and Sir Maharaja Yamin-us Sultanate Kishen Pershad Bahadur’s benevolence I was appointed to this post. From there to the District Court and from the District Court to the Chief Session Judge Warangal and Medak. It was during my tenure in Medak District, that unanticipated and unheralded, a Farman[28] was issued from Ala-Hazrat Bundgan Alee Mutalee Nawab Mir Osman Ali Khan Bahadur’s Secretariat that, “Since Masood Ali’s tenure of service has been completed, he should consequently be granted the pension he is entitled to, and, he should be informed that it is suggested that it is expedient that after collecting his pension he return to his vatan to reside there. A grace period of one week should be adequate for this purpose.”\n\nIt had been almost eighteen years since I had come to Hyderabad and now a substantial number of my kith and kin and all my immediate family members were there as well. The emotional and psychological agony I had to bear at having to leave them behind in this precipitous manner without the wherewithal to cope with it is beyond description, and I do not even want to recount it. In brief, complying with the orders received, I left my family and children in Hyderabad and instead of seven within five days departed for Awadh.\n\nIt was almost twenty years since I had seen my vatan; the older generation had passed on and my contemporaries were away earning their livelihoods. The houses lying in their derelict and delipidated state told tales of their ruin and devastation. Seeing them and remembering their former dwellers shattered one’s heart into pieces. I could not bear this distressing sight for long and after staying a week to a week and a half left for Lucknow where I resided for almost a year at the house of Moulvi Nihaluddin Ahmed Sahib, former Deputy Collector. Moulvi Sahib, had very graciously, given me the upper story of his house to live in which was extremely comfortable and quiet and there I resided with my servants. Moulvi Nihaluddin Ahmed Sahib who had been an employee of the United Provinces had served the Government intelligently, shrewdly and with great honesty was by this time a pensioner and had embraced the life of a recluse. His time was mostly spent in prayers, fasting and litanies. For a short while in the morning and evening, he would venture out from his seclusion. His regular visitors were also no more than two or four gentlemen such as Moulvi Maulana Waris Hussain Sahib and Mohammad Nasim S"
