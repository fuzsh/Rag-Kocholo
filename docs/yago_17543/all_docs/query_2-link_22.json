        "text": "Sri Lanka’s dark legacy of enforced disappearances underscores the blatant disregard for human rights that characterized the civil war and youth uprisings, ranking the country as the second highest worldwide for the practice, with 60,000-100,000 reported cases. For decades, Sri Lankan authorities have weaponized disappearances as a tool of state terror, ostensibly to combat ‘terrorism’ and maintain national security.\n\nThe practice of enforced disappearances traces back to the 1970s and 1980s, during the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) led insurrections (1971 and 1988-89), and intensified throughout the internal armed conflict, with Tamil youths disproportionately abducted by state forces and government-aligned militants. The cessation of the armed conflict in 2009 did little to halt enforced disappearances. state-backed groups in white vans created a new series of post war enforced disappearances, a wave of “white van abductions”, targeting journalists, activists and minorities communities. There is a trail of devastation, unanswered questions and deep-rooted grief among the families of the missing. Their tiring, yet tireless quest for truth, justice and reparation has been marred by state evasion, silence and even harassment.\n\nSri Lanka ratified the Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (CPED) in May 2016 but it did not recognize the competence of the Committee on Enforced Disappearances to receive and consider communications from or on behalf of victims. Sri Lanka initially introduced a mechanism for the families to apply for death certificate for their missing family members, one year after the disappearance and introduced Certificate of Absence for the missing persons in 2016. However, Sri Lanka passed a domestic law criminalising enforced disappearances in 2018. Human rights organisations have repeatedly stated that the transitional justice process of Sri Lanka falls far short of meeting serving justice to the families.\n\nThe response of the Sri Lankan government to demands for justice have been tepid and largely performative. Despite establishing bodies like the Office of Missing Persons and the Office of Reparations in 2017 and 2018 respectively, efforts have fallen short of meaningful accountability. These initiatives are marked by a lack of trust and tangible progress due to political interferences have failed to assuage the victims’ families or to address the core issue at hand.\n\nHuman rights organizations and the United Nations, has repeatedly called on Sri Lanka authorities to investigate and, if there is sufficient admissible evidence, prosecute those suspected of criminal responsibility for these heinous acts, to provide the victims and their families with truth, justice, and reparations. Yet, the persistence of enforced disappearances as an issue underscores the urgent need for Sri Lanka to confront its past, ensure accountability, and safeguard against the recurrence of such crime.\n\nAfghanistan has been afflicted by a harrowing legacy of enforced disappearances, spanning various regimes, including the People’s Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (PDPA) era, Mujahideen conflicts and civil war, and the ongoing de facto Taliban’s regime. The PDPA period (1978-1992) is particularly noted for its egregious record of enforced disappearances, with thousands vanishing simply for opposing the PDPA led government leaving families in perpetual anguish, unaware of the fates of their loved ones.\n\nThe turmoil continued with the Mujahideen (1992-1996), who also committed crimes under international law and human rights violations during civil war, including the enforced disappearance. Documentation by various organizations reveals a pattern of abductions across factions, with particularly devastating impacts on ethnic Hazaras. The Taliban’s emergence (1996-2001) and (20210 to present) further intensified the crisis of enforced disappearances, with their rule marked by widespread crimes, especially against Hazara community.\n\nThe subsequent government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (2002-2021), despite international support, could not curb the tide of enforced disappearances, with groups like the Taliban and Islamic State of Khorasan Province. The Taliban’s return to power in 2021 has ushered in a new era of systematic disappearances, despite promises of amnesty. Independent reports of enforced disappearances and other documentation on and human rights abuses are severely restricted, obscuring the full extent of the crisis.\n\nDespite the staggering scale of disappearances, Afghanistan lacked specific legal frameworks to address this crime until 2017, when enforced disappearances was included in the Penal Code. Yet, successive Afghan governments have largely failed to investigate or provide reparation for the victims and their families, with the situation remaining dire and largely unaddressed. The Independent Human Rights Commission of Afghanistan and civil society efforts highlight the ongoing plight of so many families affected by enforced disappearances, underscoring the urgent need for bringing all those suspected of criminal responsibility to justice in fair trials.\n\nEnforced disappearances in Pakistan have been used as a political tool to silence the voices of political opponents, activists, journalists, and dissenters since the 1980’s. However enforced disappearances became more frequently deployed after 2001, during the ‘War on Terror’, as a counterterrorism strategy. The Pakistani Penal Code does not criminalise enforced disappearances, and various legal gaps have allowed this heinous crime to be committed in the country with impunity, leaving a trail of devastation in their wake.\n\nSince 2011, at least 10,078 enforced disappearances were recorded by the Pakistan Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances (COIED). Of them, 3,485 took place in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and 2,752 in Balochistan. Figures by human rights organisations and families suggest higher numbers.\n\nIn Pakistan, the recourse to enforced disappearance has evolved over time and a chilling pattern has emerged. While many remain disappeared, in other cases, the state, after briefly abducting people, releases them or uses draconian laws and trumped-up charges to silence them. In addition to these resurfaced disappearances, there have been instances of the same person being repeatedly abducted by the state.\n\nPakistan is also yet to ratify the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. There have been several attempts to criminalise enforced disappearance in Pakistan. On 7 June 2021, a proposed amendment to the Penal Code was presented before parliament by the Ministry of Human Rights, but it failed to meet the standards of international law and eventually lapsed in the Senate. Since then, owing in part to the political tumult in the country, Pakistan has made no meaningful effort to criminalize the practice.\n\nExisting avenues do not prevent recurrence of the crime or protect victims’ families from harassment or threats and do not provide any means for redressal, rehabilitation, or financial support. Most of the families of forcibly disappeared people are unable to seek legal support to locate their loved ones due to socio-economic reasons despite broad constitutional safeguards and the application of the penal code as a protection against enforced disappearances. Their protests demanding justice continue despite resistance and harassment from the state.\n\nEnforced disappearances in Bangladesh, tracing back to the 1971 independence and subsequent years, have alarmingly escalated since the Awami League’s ascent to power in 2009. Reports by Sweden-based Bangla news portal called Netra News and human rights organizations, such as Odhikar and the Asian Human Rights Commission indicate that hundreds have fallen victim to this heinous tactic of silencing dissent and political opposition. Amnesty International, the United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances and other human rights oranisations have highlighted the persisting issue, with cases predominantly targeting opposition leaders, activists, and dissenting voices under the guise of “counter-terrorism” .\n\nBangladesh’s notorious Rapid Action Battalion which consists of officers of Bangladeshi Army, Navy, Air Force, Border Guards, and police force, are accused of carrying out enforced disappearances, along with other human rights violations. Despite the international community raising concerns, the government has continued to stifle opposition voices through disappearances, torture, and stringent digital security laws, further undermining democracy and electoral integrity. The suffering of the disappeared’s families impact their mental, social, economic, and physical well-being as well, in addition to being harassed by the law enforcement authorities.\n\nDespite Bangladesh’s membership in the United Nations Human Rights Council, the lack of ratification of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance highlights a reluctance to commit fully to international human rights law. As a result, Bangladesh is yet to recognise enforced disappearance under its domestic criminal law, which underscores the urgent need for legal reforms, and a genuine commitment to human rights protection.\n\nLikewise, the absence of adequate legal frameworks and mechanisms to address enforced disappearances, or even acknowledgement of the existence of this crime, fosters a culture of impunity. Activists and organizations like Maayer Daak and Odhikar face governmental repression, including false charges and operational restrictions, indicating a broader crackdown on civil society and human rights advocacy.\n\nDespite UN interventions and calls for cooperation, the Bangladeshi government’s response remains unsatisfactory, suggesting a deliberate avoidance of accountability.\n\nNepal’s state of emergency from November 2001 to August 2002 marked a harrowing period of the increased use of enforced disappearances with more than 1300 cases of enforced disappearances. Amnesty International documented over 100 cases in this timeframe alone. The UN Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances (UNWGEID) reported Nepal as having the highest number of new reported cases of enforced disappearance for the period of 2002 and 2003. The district of Banke, situated in mid-West of Nepal, became a grim epicenter, with detainees often held at Chisapani army barracks, a site notorious for torture. Comprehensive records from various organizations painted a bleak picture: the Informal Sector Service Centre (INSEC) reported 931 enforced disappearances, the International Committee of the Red Cross identified 1,347 missing persons, and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons (CIEDP) registered 3,223 complaints.\n\nThe pattern of disappearances primarily targeted those suspected of connections to the Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist Centre (CPN-M), with individuals frequently taken by security personnel in civilian clothes to locations where they were held incommunicado, often leading to extrajudicial executions. Victims predominantly came from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, especially from indigenous groups like the Tharu, highlighting the conflict’s deep-rooted issues around land distribution, economic disenfranchisement, and political marginalization.\n\nNepal is yet to ratify the Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, but have domestic legal provisions criminalizing enforced disappearances. Despite Nepal criminalizing enforced disappearances in 2017 and the establishment of the CIEDP, not a single case has been investigated under the new Penal Code, reflecting a glaring gap between legislative progress and practical justice. The lack of investigations persists even as Nepal faces international obligations to address human rights violations stemming from its ratified treaties.\n\nEfforts towards remedy and reparation have seen some progress, with Nepal’s constitution and subsequent legislation acknowledging the rights of victims to information, social rehabilitation, and compensation. The Comprehensive Peace Agreement and subsequent government initiatives have sought to provide relief and compensation to conflict-affected individuals, including monetary support and educational scholarships. However, the implementation of these measures has often been criticized for lacking clear guidelines for immediate relief.\n\nIn a recent development, the CIEDP’s distribution of Identity Cards to victims and their families faced rejection, as the cards omitted crucial details such as name of the disappeared person, and did not specify the reparations and subsidies that the card holders are entitled to, which leg to legal challenges. Alongside continuous support from national and international organizations through psychosocial support, financial assistance, and capacity-building programs, ongoing efforts to address the legacy of enforced disappearances in Nepal continues, albeit with significant challenges.\n\nIn India, enforced disappearances have been a grave human rights issue for decades, predominantly utilized in Kashmir, Punjab, Manipur, Chhattisgarh, and most recently in West Bengal. . They have largely been associated with armed conflicts and counter-insurgency operations. They are often compounded by “fake encounter killings”, where security forces stage self-defense scenarios to justify extrajudicial killings.\n\nAt least 8,000 disappearances were recorded between 1989 and 2012 in Kashmir. In Punjab, around 8,000 people were reportedly disappeared between 1984 and 1995 as part of the state’s counter-insurgency efforts. Manipur and the surrounding region in the north-east has seen enforced disappearances since the 1980s. Chhattisgarh, caught between the state sponsored ‘Salwa Judum’ (a vigilante group) and the Naxalite movement, has led to civilians being forcibly abducted – especially when violence peaked between 2005 and 2007. In West Bengal, nearly 100 enforced disappearances have come to light, where low-caste villagers, suspected of smuggling and trafficking, are targeted often the consequence of law enforcement trading in their human rights obligations for quick results when they face a complex criminal justice issue.\n\nThe UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances (WGEID) has highlighted India’s issue in its annual reports since mid 1980s. India has not yet ratified the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, and its national legal framework does not recognize enforced disappearances as a specific offence – worsening the situation. Often, police refuse to file complaints against law enforcement officials whenever the families try to lodge complaints under broader provisions under the Penal Code of India.\n\nAs families attempt to seek justice, truth and reparation, they are often met with intimidation, harassment and legal obstacles, including the requirement of government consent to pursue cases against state security forces under the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) – and equivalent Act in Jammu Kashmir – which grants broad immunities and powers to the military.\n\nThere have been some important legal cases with potential to address such injustices, including the landmark judgment in Manipur where the Supreme Court ordered investigations into alleged extrajudicial killings yet, the Supreme Court has not explicitly deliberated on the practice of enforced disappearance as a distinct offence nor highlighted the need for perpetrators of enforced disappearances to be held criminally responsible. Thus, systemic impunity endures, bolstered by laws like the AFSPA, and the families of the disappeared are left on their own to navigate a challenging legal landscape in their pursuit of accountability.\n\nIn the Maldives, the governance history has entrenched a culture of political repression, restricted free speech, and curtailed civil liberties. Reports of enforced disappearances and other human rights violations during the 2013-2018 regime highlight the challenges in investigating and holding those suspected of criminal responsibility accountable due to government control over the nation’s institutions. This pattern of repression extends to threats, violence against activists and journalists, and a stark lack of accountability and transparency in addressing these violations.\n\nThe most recent prominent case of enforced disappearance in the Maldives was of journalist and activist Ahmed Rilwan Abdulla, who vanished in August 2014 after tweeting about the unsafe conditions for journalists reporting on gangs and Islamists -symbolic of the ongoing threat to freedom of expression. Despite it being one case, it fostered a climate of fear, suggesting a nexus between gang members, some Islamist, and political figures aiming to suppress dissent, coupled with the government’s indifference to these dynamics.\n\nThe government that came into power in the Maldives in 2018 appointed ‘The Deaths and Disappearances Commission in late 2019 which published a report into their investigation on Rilwan’s disappearance. However, the Commission had a mandate to investigate into 27 cases of disappearances, details of which have not been made public as of March 2024.\n\nInternational bodies, including the United Nations and various human rights organizations, have called on the Maldivian government to tackle these pervasive issues. On 31 July, Maldives ratified the Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. However, Maldives did not recognize the competence of the Enforced Disappearance Committee to receive and consider communications from or on behalf of victims or other states parties to the Treaty. The Maldivian Attorney General’s Office noted that they are working on formulating the relevant laws necessary for effective implementation of the Convention, criminalising enforced disappearance under the domestic law.\n\nThere is very limited information available in the public domain regarding human rights violations in Bhutan, especially on enforced disappearances. In the 1990s, Bhutan experienced significant political and social upheaval due to government policies aimed at national integration, privileging northern Bhutanese culture. These policies led to widespread human rights violations against the Nepali-speaking Lhotshampa population in southern Bhutan, resulting in arbitrary arrests, degrading treatment, and the forced exodus of over 70,000 people to Nepal. Several Bhutanese activists living in exile that Amnesty International spoke to, mentioned cases of enforced disappearances during this period, though data and statistics of the extent of the issue is unavailable.\n\nBhutan is yet to ratify the Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and recognize the competence of the Enforced Disappearance Committee to receive and consider communications from or on behalf of victims and other states parties to the Treaty. Likewise, the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances has noted that there is one outstanding case of enforced disappearance registered with them, and the government of Bhutan is yet to investigate the case."
