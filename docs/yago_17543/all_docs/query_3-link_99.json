        "text": "JAMMU: National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah on Sunday requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to restore 4G mobile internet services in Jammu and Kashmir as he highlighted various problems due to lack of the facility and the harsh winter in the Union Territory.\n\n\"The prime minister is saying 5G is coming in India while we are deprived of 4G (mobile internet service). May he come and live here after leaving the chair and see how we are living under 2G (service),\" Abdullah, the former chief minister of the erstwhile state, said at a book release function here.\n\nWhile the service was restored in two districts, Udhampur in Jammu and Ganderbal in Kashmir, after over a year, it is still suspended in rest of the 18 districts.\n\n\"Students are sitting in their homes and getting education through internet and the businessmen are also dependent on internet connectivity. My request to the prime minister is that if you are saying this place is on the path of development, give us 4G for the sake of god so that we too can benefit and our children move forward,\" Abdullah said.\n\n\"There is a talk of Rs 28,000 crore package. First, let us know what happened to the earlier Rs 80,000 crore package and where the money had gone. See our condition and had there been no army, the Srinagar-Jammu national highway would have remained closed for one year,\" the NC leader said referring to the restoration of the highway by Border Roads Organsiation (BRO), which constructed a bailey bridge near Kela Morh to restore traffic on the strategic highway after a portion of the road caved-in on January 10.\n\nEarlier this month, the Jammu and Kashmir administration had announced a new industrial development scheme (IDS) with a total outlay of Rs 28,400 crore to encourage new investment and to take industrial development to the block level.\n\n\"What can I say about the problems we are facing in Kashmir where there is no electricity, petrol, diesel, kerosene oil and shortage of daily use food items. Jammu is the door to Kashmir and it is pathetic that former prime minister A B Vajpayee promised a rail link (between Kashmir and rest of the country) by 2007, which was revised to 2022 by this regime. Hope it would not extend to 2040 when I will be no more,\" he said.\n\nAbdullah said he is advising his brother Mustafa Kamal not to travel by Jammu-Srinagar national highway in view of the lurking threat of shooting stones from the hillocks overlooking the highway from Udhampur onwards.\n\n\"I am not doing any politics. This is the present day condition in J&K. Yesterday, I received the New Year greeting card from Delhi Chief Minister and five days back a friend's letter from abroad dispatched in November last year. I telephoned him and requested him not to post any letter in future,\" he said.\n\nReferring to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, he said the virus has brought the world to its knees and showed people power of the almighty.\n\n\"People today are afraid of handshakes and hugging each other as thousands are still dying on a daily basis in various parts of the world. Vaccine has been found and only time will tell about its efficacy but I am praying for its success so that the situation gets normal,\" he said.\n\nHe, however, expressed surprise that some people were not adhering to the SOPs and moving around without masks, urging them not to lower their guard.\n\nUrging people to be courageous and never deviate from truth, Abdullah said education has the power to empower the people and make them distinguish between right and wrong.\n\n\"Make yourself courageous which is possible when you receive education, both religious as well as worldly knowledge. Nothing will happen if you get only one of the two, innocents are being put inside jails and criminals are roaming freely. Why because we lack boldness?\" he said.\n\n\"No religion teaches hatred. The religion is not bad but it is the human who is bad,\" he said, adding every religion teaches brotherhood and to live in harmony.\n\n\"When we do not respect our religion, how will we respect the religion of others? He (god) is everywhere and in every shape. We are Muslims for namesake and are practically far away (from Islam). Till we become practical, we cannot change our destiny,\" he said.\n\nHailing the contribution of Choudhary for the upliftment of his community, he said Gujjars are still facing poverty and disease and need to be empowered economically and educationally.\n\nHe urged the trust to translate the released Urdu biography of Choudhary into other languages, especially Hindi and said \"they think Urdu is a language of Muslims but do not know this is not the Muslim's language alone. This is one of the languages in the country.\""
