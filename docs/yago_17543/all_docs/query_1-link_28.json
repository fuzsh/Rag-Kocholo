        "meta_description": "There has been an enhanced quest for understanding 'Islam' especially after the incidence of 9/11. Obviously, the Qur'an being the main source of Islamic teachings, has also attracted the friends and foes in general but the thirsty souls in particular. However, it is beyond the comprehension of the common people as to how this Divine Book is so powerful in its appeal. It is in this context that the author realized the need for the crucial task of elaborating the ways and means of Qur'anic understanding. Moreover, the author's endeavor herein was to emphasize that Al-Qur'an's unique style, contents, meanings, messages and guidance has made it the most appealing and revolutionary book of all time. Amazingly, it not only provides a soothing effect on the human mind, soul and spirit, but also makes its followers very dynamic and ambitious to carry out the humanistic tasks of diverse nature.\nVarious ways of enhancing the ability of understanding the noble Qur'an and approaching it correctly have been dealt with by the author in detail for the reader to appreciate the underlying beauties of this living miracle.\n \n\nAbout the Author \nDr. Masood Ahmad is professor of Biochemistry, and presently working as the Dean, Faculty of Life Sciences, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, India. Besides his active involvement in teaching and research of Biochemistry, he has also published three books and dozens of articles on various aspects of the Qur'an and Islam. Prof. Ahmad's emphasis on Islam as the best ideology for human salvation is primarily based on the Qur'anic teachings. He takes inspiration from Al-Qur'an especially as the living miracle and a Divine Book that contains a universal message for all time to come. Inspirations from the Qur'an is an outcome of his 38 years' of contemplation on the last emanation of the Book of Divine guidance",
