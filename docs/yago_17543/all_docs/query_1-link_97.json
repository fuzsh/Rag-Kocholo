        "text": "Rabia Ahmad’s parents, who live in Portland, Ore., were not around to witness her exchange of vows with Christopher Pattison on Dec. 19 at the Manhattan Marriage Bureau. They were visiting relatives in her father’s native Pakistan.\n\nBut Ms. Ahmad, 39, was not without the warmth of family to greet her when she stepped out of a Mercedes-Benz in front of 141 Worth Street wearing a blush-colored wedding dress amid the whir of cameras, the sun peeking at her from behind dark clouds on a chilly day.\n\nClutching a small bouquet of white roses and pine stems, Ms. Ahmad made her way past a dizzying array of soon-to-be and just-married couples and into the arms of Harper and Ellis Marsili-Batt. The blonde 5-year-old twin girls are part of Ms. Ahmad’s “New York family,” an ethnic mix of friends who have been helping her view life through an ever-widening lens since she arrived in New York City 22 years ago.\n\n“I was raised in a very conservative Muslim community in Portland, and left there at 17 to attend N.Y.U.,” Ms. Ahmad said. “I liked the freedom that came with living in New York, and never went home.”"
