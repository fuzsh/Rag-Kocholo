        "text": "Translation of Sahih Muslim, Book : 1\n\nKITAB AL-IMAN\n\n(THE BOOK OF FAITH)\n\n(Continued)\n\nChapter 51 : CONCERNING THE WIND WHICH WOULD BLOW NEAR THE DAY OF RESURRECTION AND WOULD CAUSE TO DIE ANYONE HAVING ANKTHING LIKE FAITH IN HIS HEART Book 1, Number 0212:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Verily Allah would make a wind to blow from the side of the Yemen more delicate than silk and would spare none but cause him to die who, in the words of Abu 'Alqama, has faith equal to the weight of a grain ; while Abdul-'Aziz said: having faith equal to the weight of a dust particle.\n\nChapter 52 : EXHORTATION TO BE PROMPT IN DOING GOOD DEEDS BEFORE THE APPEARANCE OF TURBULANCE Book 1, Number 0213:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) observed: Be prompt in doing good deeds (before you are overtaken) by turbulence which would be like a part of the dark night. During (that stormy period) a man would be a Muslim in the morning and an unbeliever in the evening or he would be a believer in the evening and an unbeliever in the morning, and would sell his faith for worldly goods.\n\nChapter 53 : PERTAINING TO THE FEAR OF A BELIEVER LEST HIS DEEDS SHOULD BE LOST Book 1, Number 0214:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik that when this verse: \"O ye who believe I raise not your voices above the voice of the Prophet, nor shout loud unto him in discourse, as ye shout loud unto one another, lest your deeds should become null and void, while you perceive not\" (xlix. 2-5), was revealed. Thabit b. Qais confined himself in his house and said: I am one of the denizens of Fire, and he deliberately avoided coming to the Apostle (may peace be upon him). The Apostle (may peace be upon him) asked Sa'd b, Mu'adh about him and said, Abu Amr, how is Thabit? Has he fallen sick? Sa'd said: He is my neighbour, but I do not know of his illness. Sa'd came to him (Thabit), and conveyed to him the message of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). Upon this Thabit said: This verse was revealed, and you are well aware of the fact that, amongst all of you, mine is the voice louder than that of the Messenger of Allah, and so I am one amongst the denizens of Fire, Sa'd Informed the Holy Prophet about it. Upon this the Messenger of Allah observed: (Nay, not so) but he (Thabit) is one of the dwellers of Paradise.\n\nBook 1, Number 0215:\n\nThis hadith has been narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik by another chain of transmitters in which these words are found: Thabit b. Qais was the orator of the Ansar, when this verse was revealed: the rest of the hadith is the same with the exception that there is no mention of Sa'd b. Mu'adh in it. This hadith is also transmitted by Ahmad b. Sa'id, Habban, Sulaiman b. Mughira on the authority of Anas who said: When the verse was revealed: \"Do not raise your voice louder than the voice of the Apostle,\" no mention was made of Sa'd b, Mu'adh in it.\n\nBook 1, Number 0216:\n\nThis hadith is narrated on the authority of Anas by another chain of transmitters in which there is no mention of Sa'd b. Mu'adh, but the following words are there: We observed a man, one of the dwellers of Paradise, walking about amongst us.\n\nChapter 54 : WOULD (PEOPLE) BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEEDS COMMITTED DURING THE STATE OF IGNORANCE? Book 1, Number 0217:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Abdullah b. Mas'ud that some people said to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him): Messenger of Allah, would we be held responsible for our deeds committed in the state of ignorance (before embracing Islam)? Upon his he (the Holy Prophet) remarked: He who amongst you performed good deeds in Islam , He would not be held responsible for them (misdeeds which he committed in ignorance) and he who committed evil (even after embracing Islam) would be held responsible or his misdeeds that he committed in the state of ignorance as well as in that of Islam.\n\nBook 1, Number 0218:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Abdullah b. Mas'ud: We once said: Messenger of Allah, would we be held responsible for our deeds committed in the state of ignorance? He (the Holy Prophet) observed: He who did good deeds in Islam would not be held responsible for what he did in the state of ignorance, but he who committed evil (after having come within the fold of Islam) would be held responsible for his previous and later deeds.\n\nBook 1, Number 0219:\n\nThis hadith has been transmitted by Minjab b. al-Harith Tamimi with the same chain of transmitters.\n\nChapter 55 : ISLAM EFFACES ALL THE PREVIOUS MISDEEDS AND SO DO MIGRATION AND PILGRIMAGE Book 1, Number 0220:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Ibn Shamasa Mahri that he said: We went to Amr b. al-As and he was about to die. He wept for a long time and turned his face towards the wall. His son said: Did the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him not give you tidings of this? Did the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) not give you tidings of this? He (the narrator) said: He turned his face (towards the audience) and said: The best thing which we can count upon is the testimony that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah. Verily I have passed through three phases. (The first one) in which I found myself averse to none else more than I was averse to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and there was no other desire stronger in me than the one that I should overpower him and kill him. Had I died in this state, I would have been definitely one of the denizens of Fire. When Allah instilled the love of Islam in my heart, I came to the Apostle (may peace be upon him) and said: Stretch out your right hand so that may pledge my allegiance to you. He stretched out his right hand, I withdrew my hand, He (the Holy Prophet) said: What has happened to you, O 'Amr? replied: I intend to lay down some condition . He asked: What condition do you intend to put forward? I said: should be granted pardon. He (the Holy Prophet) observed: Are you not aware of the fact that Islam wipes out all the previous (misdeeds) ? Verily migration wipes out all the previous (misdeeds), and verily the pilgrimage wipes out all the (previous) misdeeds. And then no one as or dear to me than the Messenger of Allah and none was more sublime in my eyes than he, Never could I, pluck courage to catch a full glimpse of his face due to its splendour. So if I am asked to describe his features, I cannot do that for I have not eyed him fully. Had I died in this state had every reason to hope that I would have bee among the dwellers of Paradise. Then we were responsible for certain things (in the light of which)I am unable to know what is in store for me. When I die, let neither female mourner nor fire accompany me. When you bury me, fill my grave well with earth, then stand around it for the time within which a camel is slaughtered and its meat is distributed so that I may enjoy your intimacy and (in your company) ascertain what answer I can give to the messengers (angels) of Allah.\n\nBook 1, Number 0221:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that some persons amongst the polytheist had committed a large number of murders and had excessively indulged in fornication. Then they came to Muhammad (may peace be upon him) and said: Whatever you assert and whatever you call to is indeed good. But if you inform us that there is atonement of our past deeds (then we would embrace Islam). Then it was revealed :\n\nAnd those who call not unto another god along with Allah and slay not any soul which Allah has forbidden except in the cause of justice, nor commit fornication; and he who does this shall meet the requital of sin. Multiplied for him shall be the torment on the Day of Resurrection, and he shall therein abide disgraced, except him who repents a believes and does good deeds. Then these! for the Allah shall change their vices into virtues. Verily Allah is Ever Forgiving, Merciful (xxv. 68-70).\n\nSay thou: O my bondsmen woo have committed extravagance against themselves despair not of the Mercy of Allah I Verily Allah will forgive the sins altogether. He is indeed the Forgiving, the Merciful (xxxix. 53).\n\nChapter 56 : PERTAINING TO THE VIRTUOUS ACT OF A MAN BEFORE EMBRACING ISLAM Book 1, Number 0222:\n\nHakim b. Hizam reported to 'Urwa b. Zubair that he said to the Messenger of Allah: Do you think that there is any thing for me (of he reward with the Lord) for the deed of religious purification that I did in the state of ignorance? Upon this he (the Apostle of Allah) said to him : You accepted Islam with all the previous virtues that you practised.\n\nBook 1, Number 0223:\n\nHakim b. Hizam reported to 'Urwa b. Zubair that he said to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him): Messenger of Allah, do you think if there is any reward (of the Lord with me on the Day of Resurrection) for the deeds of religious purification that I performed in the state of ignorance, such as charity, freeing a slave, cementing of blood-relations ? Upon this he (the Apostle of Allah) said to him: You have accepted Islam with all the previous virtues that you had practised.\n\nBook 1, Number 0224:\n\nIt is narrate on the authority of Hakim b. Hizam: I said: Messenger of Allah , I did so some of the deeds in the state of ignorance. (One of the transmitters Hisham b. Urwa explained them as acts of piety. Upon this the Messenger, of Allah remarked: You have embraced Islam with all the previous acts of virtue. I said: By God, I would leave nothing undone in Islam the like of which I did in the state of ignorance.\n\nBook 1, Number 0225:\n\nHisham b. Urwa narrated it on the authority of his father: Hakim b. Hizam freed one hundred slave and donated one hundred camels (for the sake of Allah) during the state of ignorance. Then he freed one hundred slaves and donated one hundred camel(for the sake of Allah) after) he had embraced Islam. He subsequently came to the Apostle (may peace be upon him). The rest of the hadith is the same as narrated above.\n\nChapter 57 : THE VERACITY OF FAITH AND ITS SINCERITY Book 1, Number 0226:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of 'Abdullah (b. Mas'ud) that when this verse was revealed: \"It is those who believe and confound not their belief with wrongdoing\" (vi. 82), the Companions of the Messenger of Allah wore greatly perturbed. They said: Who amongst us (is so fortunate) that he does not wrong himself? Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) remarked: It does not mean that which you presume It implies that which Luqman said to his son: O my son, do not associate anything with Allah, for indeed it is the gravest wrongdoing (xxxi. 13).\n\nBook 1, Number 0227:\n\nThis hadith is narrated by another chain of transmitters, (namely) lshaq b. Ibrahim. Ibn Idris says: My father transmitted it from Aban b. Taghlib who heard it from A'mash; then I heard it also from him (A'mash).\n\nChapter 58 : CONCERNING THE WORDS OF ALLAH WHETHER YOU MANIFEST WHATEVER IS IN YOUR MIND OR HIDE IT Book 1, Number 0228:\n\nIt is reported on the authority of Abu Huraira that when it was revealed to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him): To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth and whether you disclose that which is in your mind or conceal it, Allah will call you to account according to it. Then He forgives whom He pleases and chastises whom He Pleases; and Allah is over everything Potent\"(ii. 284). the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) felt it hard and severe and they came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and sat down on their knees and said: Messenger of Allah, we were assigned some duties which were within our power to perform, such as prayer, fasting, struggling (in the cause of Allah), charity. Then this (the above-mentioned) verse was revealed unto you and it is beyond our power to live up to it. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Do you intend to say what the people of two books (Jews and Christians) said before you: \"We hear and disobey\"? You should rather say: \"We hear and we obey, (we seek) Thy forgiveness, our Lord! and unto Thee is the return.\" And they said: \"We hear and we obey, (we seek) Thy forgiveness, Our Lord! and unto Thee is the return.\" When the people recited it and it smoothly flowed on their tongues, then Allah revealed immediately afterwards: \"The Apostle believes in that which is sent down unto him from his Lord, and so do the believers. Each one believes in Allah and His Angels and His Books and His Apostles, saying: We differentiate not between any of His Apostles and they say: We hearken and we obey: (we seek) Thy forgiveness, our Lord! and unto Thee is the return\" (ii. 285). When they did that, Allah abrogated this (verse) and the Great, Majestic Allah revealed: \"Allah burdens not a soul beyond its capacity. It gets every good that it earns and it suffers every ill that it earns. Our Lord, punish us not if we forget or make a mistake.\" (The Prophet said:) Yes, our Lord! do not lay on us a burden as Thou didst lay on those before us. (The Prophet said:) Yes, our Lord, impose not on us (burdens) which we have not the strength to bear (The Prophet said:) Yes, and pardon us and grant us protection! and have mercy on us. Thou art our Patron, so grant us victory over the disbelieving people\" (ii. 286). He (the Lord) said: Yes.\n\nBook 1, Number 0229:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas: When this verse: \"Whether you disclose that which is in your mind or conceal it, Allah will call you to account according to it\" (ii 284), there entered in their minds something (of that fear) such as had never entered their hearts (before). The Apostle (may peace be upon him) observed: Say: We have heard and obeyed and submitted ourselves. He (the reporter) said: Allah instilled faith in their hearts and He revealed this verse: \"Allah burdens not a soul beyond its capacity. It gets every good that it earns and it suffers every ill that it earns. Our Lord, call us not to account if we forget or make a mistake. He the (Lord) said: I indeed did it. Our Lord! do not lay on us a burden as Thou didst lay on those before us. He (our Lord) said: I indeed did it. And pardon us, have mercy on us. Thou art our Protector\" (ii. 286). He said: I indeed did it.\n\nChapter 59 : ALLAH DISREGARDS THE PREMONITION OR THE EVIL PROMPTINGS OF THE HEART SO LONG AS THEY DO NOT TAKE A FIRM ROOT Book 1, Number 0230:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) observed: Verily Allah forgave my people the evil promptings which arise within their hearts as long as they did not speak about them or did not act upon them.\n\nBook 1, Number 0231:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) observed: Verily the Great and Mighty Allah forgave my people the evil promptings arising in their minds, but they neither talked about them nor acted upon them.\n\nBook 1, Number 0232:\n\nThe same hadith has been narrated by Zuhair b. Harb, Waki, Ishaq b. Mansur, Husain b. 'Ali.\n\nChapter 60 : WHENEVER A PERSON INTENDS TO DO A GOOD DEED, IT IS RECORDED BUT WHENEVER HE INTENDS TO COMMIT EVIL, IT IS NOT WRITTEN Book 1, Number 0233:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: The Great and the Glorious Lord said (to angels) : Whenever My bondsman intends to corn it an evil, do not record it against him, but if he actually commits it, then write it as one evil. And when he intends to do good but does not do it, then take it down is one act of goodness, but if he does it, then write down ten good deeds (in his record).\n\nBook 1, Number 0234:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) observed: Allah, the Great and Glorious, said: Whenever my bondsman intends to do good, but does not do it, I write one good act for him, but if he puts it into practice I wrote from ten to seven hundred good deeds in favour of him. When he intends to commit an evil, but does not actually do it, do not record it. But if he does it, I write only one evil.\n\nBook 1, Number 0235:\n\nAbu Huraira reported that Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), said: When it occurs to my bondsman that he should do a good deed but he actually does not do it, record one good to him, but if he puts it into practice, I make an entry of ten good acts in his favour. When it occurs to him to do evil, but he does not commit it, I forgive that. But if he commits it, I record one evil against his name. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) observed. The angels said: That bondsman of Yours intends to commit evil. though His Lord is more Vigilant than he. Upon this He (the Lord) said: Watch him; if he commits (evil), write it against his name but if he refrains from doing it, write one good deed or him, for he desisted from doing it for My sake. The Messenger of Allah said: He who amongst you is good of faith, all his good acts are multiplied from ten to seven hundred times (and are recorded in his name) and all the evils that he commits are recorded as such (i,e. without increase) till he meets Allah.\n\nBook 1, Number 0236:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) observed: He who intended to do good, but did not do it, one good was recorded for him, and he who intended to do good and also did it, ten to seven hundred good deeds were recorded for him. And he who intended evil, but did not commit it, no entry was made against his name, but if he committed that, it was recorded.\n\nBook 1, Number 0237:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Ibn Abbas that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) transmitted it from the Blessed and Great Lord: Verily Allah recorded the good and the evil and then made it clear that he who intended good but did not do it, Allah recorded one complete good in his favour, but if he intended it and also did it, the Glorious and Great Allah recorded ten to seven hundred virtues and even more to his credit. But it he intended evil, but did not commit it, Allah wrote down full one good in his favour. If he intended that and also committed it,Allah made an entry of one evil against him.\n\nBook 1, Number 0238:\n\nThis hadith has been narrated with another chain of transmitters with the addition of these words: Allah would even wipe out (the evil committed by a man) and Allah does not put to destruction anyone except he who is doomed to destruction.\n\nChapter 61 : PERTAINING TO EVIIL SUGGESTION OR PROMPTING IN FAITH AND WHAT SHOULD BE SAID WHEN IT OCCURS TO THE MIND OF A MAN Book 1, Number 0239:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that some people from amongst the Companions of the Apostle (may peace be upon him) came to him and said: Verily we perceive in our minds that which every one of us considers it too grave to express. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Do you really perceive it? They said : Yes. Upon this he remarked: That is the faith manifest.\n\nBook 1, Number 0240:\n\nThe same hadith has been transmitted by Muhammad b. 'Amr, Abu Baker b. Ishaq, Abu'l-Jawwab, A'mash and Abu Huraira.\n\nBook 1, Number 0241:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of 'Abdullah b. Mas'ud that the Apostle (may peace be upon him) was asked about evil prompting, to which he replied: It is pure faith.\n\nBook 1, Number 0242:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Men will continue to question one another till this is propounded: Allah created all things but who created Allah? He who found himself confronted with such a situation should say: I affirm my faith in Allah.\n\nBook 1, Number 0243:\n\nThis hadith has been transmitted by Mahmud b. Ghailan by another chain of transmitters (and the words are) : The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: The Satan will come to everyone of you and say: Who created the heaven, who created the earth? (And the man) replies: It is Allah, Then the remaining part of the hadith was narrated as mentioned above and the words 'His prophets\" were added to it.\n\nBook 1, Number 0244:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah may peace be upon him) observed : The Satan comes to everyone. of you and says : Who created this and that? till he questions: Who created your Lord? When he comes to that, one should seek refuge in Allah and keep away (from such idle thoughts).\n\nBook 1, Number 0245:\n\nThis hadith is transmitted by Urwa b. Zubair on the authority of Abu Huraira (and the words are):The Satan comes to the bondsman (of Allah) and says: Who created this and that? The remaining part of the hadith is the same.\n\nBook 1, Number 0246:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) observed: People will constantly ask you questions pertaining to knowledge till they would say: Allah created us, but who created Allah? he (the narrator) says: he (Abu Huraira) was (at the time of narrating this hadith) catching hold of the hand of a man and he said: Allah and the Messenger told the truth. Two persons have already put me this question, and this is the third one, or he said: One man has put me this question and he is the second one.\n\nBook 1, Number 0247:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that he said: The people will constantly, and the rest of the hadith is the same as that transmitted by 'Abdul-Warith with the exception that there is no mention of the Apostle of Allah in that, but he observed at the end of the hadith: Allah and His Messenger told the truth.\n\nBook 1, Number 0248:\n\nAbu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said to me: they (the people) till constantly ask you, Abu Huraira, (about different things pertaining to religion) the they would say: Well, there is Allah, but after all who created Allah? He (Abu Huraira) narrated: Once we were in the mosque that some of the Bedouins came there and said: Well, there is Allah, but who created Allah? He (the narrator) said: I took hold of the pebbles in my fist and flung at them and remarked: Stand up, stand up (go away) my friend (the Holy Prophet) told the truth.\n\nBook 1, Number 0249:\n\nYazid b. al-Asamm said: I heard Abu Huraira saying that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) observed: people will certainly ask you about everything till they will propound: Allah created every thing, but who created Allah?\n\nBook 1, Number 0250:\n\nAnas b. Malik transmitted it from the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) that the Great and Glorious Allah said: Verily your people would constantly question about this and that till they would say: Well, it is Allah Who created the creation, but who created Allah?\n\nBook 1, Number 0251:\n\nThis hadith has been narrated by another chain of transmitters with the exception that Ishaq made no mention of this: Allah said: Verily your people.\n\nChapter 62 : WARNING FOR ONE APPROPRIATING THE RIGHT OF A MUSLIM BY TAKING A FALSE OATH: THE FIRE (OF HELL) IS HIS CHASTISEMENT Book 1, Number 0252:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Abu Umama that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) observed: He who appropriated the right of a Muslim by (swearing a false) oath, Allah would make Hell-fire necessary for him and would declare Paradise forbidden for him. A person said to him : Messenger of Allah, even if it is something insignificant? He (the Holy Prophet) replied:(Yes)even if it is the twig of the arak tree.\n\nBook 1, Number 0253:\n\nThis hadith has been transmitted by another chain of narrators: Abu Bakr b. Abi Shaiba, Ishaq b.

Umar) that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) observed : He who perjured with a view to appropriating the property of a Muslim , and he is in fact a liar and would meet Allah in a state that He would be angry with him . He (the narrator) said : There came Ash'ath b. Qais and said (to the people): What does Abu Abdur-Rahman (the Kunya of Abdullah b. Umar) narrate to you? They replied : So and so. Upon this he remarked: Abu Abdur-Rahman told the truth. This (command) has been revealed in my case. There was a piece of land in Yemen over which I and another person had a claim. I brought the dispute with him to the Apostle of Allah (to decide) He (the Holy Prophet) said: Can you produce an evidence (in your support) ? I said: No. He (the Holy Prophet) observed: (Then the decision would be made) on his oath. I said : He would readily take an oath. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) remarked : He who perjured for appropriating the wealth of a Muslim, whereas he is a liar, would meet Allah while He would be angry with him.

Then the remaining part of the hadith was narrated as transmitted by A'mash but with the exception of these words: There was a dispute between me and another person in regard to a well. We referred this dispute to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). Upon this he remarked : Either (you should produce) two witnesses (to support your contention) or his oath (would be accepted as valid).\n\nBook 1, Number 0256:\n\nIbn Mas'ud says: I heard the Messenger of Allah observing: He who took an oath on the property of a Muslim without legitimate right would meet Allah and He would be angry, with him.

One who had come from Hadramaut said : Messenger of Allah, only this man has appropriated my land which belonged to my father. The one who had came from Kinda contended . This is my land and is in my possession: I cultivate it. There is no right for him in it. The Messenger of Allah said to the Hadramite: Have you any evidence (to support you)? He replied in the negative. He (the Apostle of Allah) said: Then your case is to be decided on his oath. He (the Hadramite) said: Messenger of Allah, he is a liar and cares not what he swears and has no regard for anything. Upon this he (the Messenger of Allah) remarked: For you then there is no other help to it. He (the man from Kinda) set out to take an oath. When he turned his back the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) observed: If he took an oath on his property with a view to usurping it, he would certainly meet his Lord in a state that He would turn away from him.\n\nBook 1, Number 0258:\n\nWa'il reported it on the authority of his father Hujr: I was with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) that two men came there disputing over a piece of land. One of them said: Messenger of Allah, this man appropriated my land without justification in the days of ignorance. The (claimant) was Imru'l-Qais b.'Abis al-Kindi and his opponent was Rabi'a b. 'Iban He (the Holy Prophet) said (to the claimant): Have you evidence (to substantiate your claim) ? He replied: I have no evidence. Upon this he (the Messenger of Allah) remarked: Then his (that is of the defendant) is the oath. He (the claimant) said: In this case he (the defendant) would appropriate this (the property). He (the Holy Prophet) said: There is than no other way left for you but this. He (the narrator) said: When he (the defendant) stood up to take oath, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: He who appropriated the land wrongfully would meet Allah in a state that He would be angry with him. Ishaq in his narration mentions Rabi'a b. 'Aidan (instead of Rabi'a b. 'Ibdan).\n\nChapter 63 : CONCERNING THE FACT THAT VIOLABLE IS THE BLOOD OF ONE WHO MAKES AN ATTEMPT TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THE PROPERTY OF ANOTHER WITHOUT ANY LEGITIMATE RIGHT. IF SUCH MAN IS KILLED HIS ABODE IS FIRE AND HE WHO DIES IN PROTECTING HIS PROPERTY IS A MARTYR Book 1, Number 0259:\n\nAbu Huraira reported: A person came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and said: Messenger of Allah, what do you think if a man comes to me in order to appropriate my possession ? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Don't surrender your possession to him. He (the inquirer) said: If he fights me? He (the Holy Prophet) remarked: Then fight (with him). He (the inquirer) again said: What do you think if I am killed? He (the Holy Prophet) observed: You would be a martyr. He (the inquirer) said : What do you think of him (Messenger of Allah) If I kill him. He (the Holy Prophet) said: he would be in the Fire.\n\nBook 1, Number 0260:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Thabit, that when 'Abdullah b. 'Amr and 'Anbasa b. Abi Sufyan were about to fight against each other, Khalid b. 'As rode to 'Abdullah b. 'Amr and persuaded him (not to do so). Upon this Abdullah b. 'Amr said: Are you not aware that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had observed: \"He who died in protecting his property is a martyr.\"\n\nThis hadith has been narrated by Muhammad b. Hatim, Muhammad b. Bakr, Ahmad b. 'Uthman Naufali, Abu 'Asim, Ibn Juraij.\n\nChapter 64 : THE RULER WHO, IS UNJUST TO HIS SUBJECTS DESERVES PUNISHMENT OF FIRE Book 1, Number 0261:\n\nHasan reported : 'Ubaidullah b. Ziyad paid a visit to Ma'qil b. Yasar Muzani in his illness of which he (later on) died. (At this juncture) Ma'qil said: I am going to narrate to you a hadith which I have heard from the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and which I would not have transmitted if I knew that I would survive. Verily I have heard the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) say: There is none amongst the bondsmen who was entrusted with the affairs of his subjects and he died in such a state that he was dishonest in his dealings with those over whom he ruled that the Paradise is not forbidden for him.\n\nBook 1, Number 0262:\n\nHasan reported: Ubaidullah b. Ziyad went to see Ma'qil b. Yasir and he was ailing. He ('Ubaidullah) inquired (about his health) to which he (Ma'qil) replied: I am narrating to you a hadith which I avoided narrating to you (before). Verily the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) observed: Allah does not entrust to his bondsman the responsibility of managing the affairs of his subjects and he dies as a dishonest (ruler) but Paradise is forbidden by Allah for such a (ruler). He (Ibn Ziyad) said: Why did you not narrate it to me before this day ? He replied : I (in fact) did not narrate it to you as it was not (fit) for me to narrate that to you.\n\nBook 1, Number 0263:\n\nHasan reported: We were with Ma'qil b. Yasar inquiring about his health that Ubaidullah b. Ziyad came there. Ma'qil said to him: Verily I am going to narrate to you a hadith which I heard from the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). Then he narrated the hadith like those two (mentioned above).\n\nBook 1, Number 0264:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Abu Malih that Ubaidullah b. Ziyad visited Ma'qil b. Yasar in his illness. Ma'qil said to him: I am narrating to you a hadith which I would have never narrated to you had I not been in death-bed. I heard Allah's apostle (may peace be upon him) say: A ruler who has been entrusted with the affairs of the Muslims but he makes no endeavors( for the material and moral uplift) and does not sincerely mean (their welfare) would not enter Paradise along with them.\n\nChapter 65 : REMOVAL OF TRUSTWORTHINESS AND FAITH FROM SOME HEARTS AND APPEARANCE OF DISCORD THEREIN Book 1, Number 0265:\n\nHudhaifa reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) narrated to us two ahadith. I have seen one (crystallized into reality), and I am waiting for the other. He told us: Trustworthiness descended in the innermost (root) of the hearts of people. Then the Qur'an was revealed and they learnt from the Qur'an and they learnt from the Sunnah. Then he (the Holy Prophet) told us about the removal of trustworthiness. He said : The man would have a wink of sleep and trustworthiness would be taken away from his heart leaving the impression of a faint mark. He would again sleep and trustworthiness would be taken away from his heart leaving an impression of a blister, as if you rolled down an ember on your foot and it was vesicled. He would see a swelling having nothing in it. He (the Holy Prophet) then took up a pebble and rolled it down over his foot and (said) : The people would enter into transactions amongst one another and hardly a person would be left who would return (things) entrusted to him. (And there would be so much paucity of honest persons) till it would be said: There in such a such tribe is a trustworthy man. And they would also say about a person: How prudent he is, how broad-minded he is and how intelligent he is, whereas in his heart there would not be faith even to the weight of a mustard seed. I have passed through a time in which I did not care with whom amongst you I entered into a transaction, for if he were a Muslim his faith would compel him to discharge his obligations to me and it he were a Christian or a Jew, the ruler would compel him to discharge his obligations to me. But today I would not enter into a transaction with you except so and so.\n\nBook 1, Number 0266:\n\nThis hadith has been transmitted by another chain of transmitters: Ibn Numair, Waki', Ishaq b. Ibrahim, 'Isa b. Yunus on the authority of A'mash.\n\nBook 1, Number 0267:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Hudhaifa : We were sitting in the company of Umar and he said: Who amongst you has heard the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) talking about the turmoil ? Some people said : It is we who heard it. Upon this be remarked: Perhaps by turmoil you presume the unrest of man in regard to his household or neighbour, they replied : Yes. He ('Umar) observed : Such (an unrest) would be done away with by prayer, fasting and charity. But who amongst you has heard from the Apostle (may peace be upon him) describing that turmoil which would come like the wave of the ocean. Hudhaifa said: The people hushed into silence, I replied : It is I. He ('Umar) said : Ye, well, your father was also very pious. Hudhaifa said : I heard the Messenger of Allah (may peace be, upon him ) observing: Temptations will be presented to men's hearts as reed mat is woven stick by stick and any heart which is impregnated by them will have a black mark put into it, but any heart which rejects them will have a white mark put in it. The result is that there will become two types of hearts: one white like a white stone which will not be harmed by any turmoil or temptation, so long as the heavens and the earth endure; and the other black and dust-coloured like a vessel which is upset, not recognizing what is good or rejecting what is abominable, but being impregnated with passion. Hudhaifa said: I narrated to him ('Umar): There is between you and that (turmoil) a closed door, but there is every likelihood of its being broken. 'Umar said: Would it be broken? You have, been rendered fatherless. Had it been opened, it would have been perhaps closed also. I said: No, it would be broken, and I narrated to him: Verily that door implies a person who would be killed or die. There is no mistake in this hadith. Abu Khalid narrated: I said to Sa'd, O Abu Malik, what do you mean by the term \"Aswad Murbadda\"? He replied: High degree of whiteness in blackness. I said: What is meant by \"Alkoozu Mujakhiyyan\"? He replied: A vessel turned upside down.\n\nBook 1, Number 0268:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Rib'i (b. Hirash). When Hudhaifa came from 'Umar he sat down to narrate to us and said: Verily yesterday when I was sitting with the Commander of the believers he asked his companions: When amongst you retains in his memory the utterance of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) with regard to the turmoil ?-and he cited the hadith like the hadith narrated on the authority of Abu Khalid, but he did not mention the exposition of his words (Murbaddan) and (Mujakhiyyan).\n\nBook 1, Number 0269:\n\nIt is transmitted by Rib'i b. Hirash. who narrated it on the authority of Hudhaifa that verily 'Umar said: Who would narrate to us or who amongst you would narrate to us (and Hudhaifa was one amongst them) what the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had said about the turmoil? Hudhaifa said: I will, and recited the hadith like that transmitted by Abu Malik on the authority of Rib'i and he observed in connection with this hadith that Hudhaifa remarked: I am narrating to you a hadith and it has no mistake, and said: That it is transmitted from he Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him).\n\nChapter 66 : ISLAM WAS INITIATED AS SOMETHING STRANGE, AND IT WOULD REVERT TO ITS (OLD POSITION) OF BEING STRANGE, AND IT WOULD CONCENTRATE BETWERN THE TWO MOSQUES Book 1, Number 0270:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Islam initiated as something strange, and it would revert to its (old position) of being strange. so good tidings for the stranger.\n\nBook 1, Number 0271:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Ibn 'Umar ('Abdullah b. 'Umar) that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) observed: Verily Islam started as something strange and it would again revert (to its old position) of being strange just as it started, and it would recede between the two mosques just as the serpent crawls back into its hole.\n\nBook 1, Number 0272:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Verily the faith would recede to Medina just as the serpent crawls back into its hole.\n\nChapter 67 : THE EFFACING OF FAITH IN THE LATER AGE Book 1, Number 0273:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Anas that verily the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) observed: The Hour (Resurrection) would not come so long as Allah is supplicated in the world.\n\nBook 1, Number 0274:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Anas that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: The Hour (Resurrection) would not come upon anyone so long as he supplicates Allah.\n\nChapter 68 : PERMISSIBILITY OF CONCEALING THE FAITH OF ONE WH0 FEARS Book 1, Number 0275:\n\nHudhaifa reported: We were in the company of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) when he said. Count for me those who profess al-Islam. We said: Messenger of Allah, do you entertain any fear concerning us and we are (at this time) between six hundred and seven hundred (in strength). He (the Holy Prophet) remarked: You don't perceive; you may be put to some trial, He (the narrator) said: We actually suffered trial so much so that some of our men were constrained to offer their prayers in concealment.\n\nChapter 69 : TO HABITUATE THE HEART WITH FAITH WHICH DUE TO ITS WEAKNESS, IS SCARED AND THE FORBIDDANCE TO CALL POSITIVELY ONE A BELIEVER WITHOUT A DEFINITE PROOF Book 1, Number 0276:\n\nSa'd narrated it on the authority of his father (Abi Waqqas) that he observed: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) distributed shares (of booty among his Companions). I said: Messenger of Allah! Give it to so and so, for verily he is a believer. Upon this the Apostle of Allah remarked: Or a Muslim. I (the narrator) repeated it (the word \"believer\") thrice and he (the Holy Prophet) turned his back upon me (and substituted the word) \"Muslim,\" and then observed: I bestow it (this share) to a man out of apprehension lest Allah should throw him prostrate into the fire (of Hell) whereas in fact the other man is dearer to me than he.\n\nBook 1, Number 0277:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Sa'd that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) bestowed upon a group of persons (things), and Sa'd was sitting amongst them. Sa'd said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) ignored some of them. And he who was ignored seemed to be more deserving in my eyes (as compared with others). I (Sa'd) said: Messenger of Allah I why is it that you did not give to such and such (man)? Verily I see him a believer. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) observed: Or a Muslim ? I kept quiet for some time but I was again impelled (to express) what I knew about him. I said: Messenger of Allah why is it that you did not give it to such and such ? Verily, by Allah, see him a believer. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) remarked: (Nay, not a believer) but a Muslim. He (Sa'd) said: I again kept quite for some time but what I knew about him again impelled me (to express my opinion) and I said: Why is it that you did not give (the share) to so and so: By Allah, verily I see him a believer. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) remarked; (Nay, not so) but a Muslim. Verily (at times) I give (a share) to a certain man apprehending that he may not be thrown prostrate in the Fire, whereas the other man (who is not given) is dearer to me (as compared with him).\n\nBook 1, Number 0278:\n\nSa'd reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) bestowed upon a group of persons (booty) and I was sitting with them. The remaining part of the hadith is the same as mentioned (above) with the additionI stood up and went to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and whispered to him : Why did you omit such and such a man ?\n\nBook 1, Number 0279:\n\nThe same hadith has been narrated on the authority of Muhammad b Sa'd and these words (are also there) : The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) gave a stroke on my neck or between my two shoulders and said: Sa'd, do you fight with me simply because I gave (a share) to a man ?\n\nChapter 70 : THE HEART IS MORE SATISFIED ON SEEING EVIDENCE Book 1, Number 0280:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) observed: We have more claim to doubt than Ibrahim (may peace be upon him) when he said: My Lord! Show me how Thou wilt quicken the dead. He said : Believeth thou not ? He said : Yes! But that my heart may rest at ease. He (the Holy Prophet) observed: May Lord take mercy on Lot, that he wanted a strong support, and had I stayed (in the prison) as long as Yusuf stayed, I would have responded to him who invited me.\n\nBook 1, Number 0281:\n\n'Abdullah b. Muhammad narrated the same hadith on the authority of Abu Huraira and in the transmission by Malik the words are that he (the Holy Prophet) recited the verse : \"but that my heart may rest at ease\" and completed it.\n\nBook 1, Number 0282:\n\nThis hadith has also been narrated by Abd b. Humaid Ya'qub, i.e. son of Ibrahim b. Sa'd, Abu Uwais, Zuhri, like the one narrated by Malik with the same chain of transmission and said : He recited this verse till he completed it.\n\nChapter 71 : THE NECESSITY OF AFFIRMING THE PROPHETHOOD OF OUR APOSTLE MUHAMMAD (MAY PEACE BE UPON HIM) WHO IS THE APOSTLE SENT TO THE WHOLE OF HUMANITY, AND THE ABROGATION OF OTHER RELIGIONS WITH HIS RELIGION Book 1, Number 0283:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) observed: There has never been a Prophet amongst the prophets who was not bestowed with a sign amongst the signs which were bestowed (on the earlier prophets). Human beings believed in it and verily I have been conferred upon revelation (the Holy Qur'an) which Allah revealed to me. I hope that I will have the greatest following on the Day of Resurrection.\n\nBook 1, Number 0284:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) observed: By Him in Whose hand is the life of Muhammad, he who amongst the community of Jews or Christians hears about me, but does not affirm his belief in that with which I have been sent and dies in this state (of disbelief), he shall be but one of the denizens of Hell-Fire.\n\nBook 1, Number 0285:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Sha'bi that one among the citizens of Khurasan asked him: 0 Abu! some of the people amongst us who belong to Khurasan say that a person who freed his bondswoman and then married her is like one who rode over a sacrificial animal. Sha'bi said: Abu Burda b. Abi Musa narrated it to me on the authority of his father that verily the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said : There are three (classes of persons) who would be given a double reward. One who is amongst the People of the Book and believed in his apostle and (lived) to see the time of Apostle Muhammad (may peace be upon him) and affirmed his faith in him and followed him and attested his truth, for him is the double reward; and the slave of the master who discharges all those obligations that he owes to Allah and discharges his duties that he owes to his master, for him there is a double reward. And a man who had a bondswoman and fed her and fed her well, then taught her good manners, and did that well and later on granted her freedom and married her, for him is the double reward. Then Sha'bi said : Accept this hadith without (giving) anything. Formerly a man was (obliged) to travel to Medina even for a smaller hadith than this.\n\nBook 1, Number 0286:\n\nThis hadith has been narrated by another chain of transmitters like Abu Bakr b. Abi Shaiba, 'Abda b. Sulaiman Ibn Abi 'Umar Sufyan, 'Ubaidullah b. Mu'adh, Shu'ba ; all of them heard it from Salih b. Salih.\n\nChapter 72 : THE DESCENT OF JESUS SON OF MARY, AND HE WILL JUDGE ACCORDING TO THE SHARIIAH OF OUR APOSTLE, MUHAMMAD (MAY PEACE BE UPON HIM) Book 1, Number 0287:\n\nAbu Huraira reported that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: By Him in Whose hand is my life, the son of Mary (may peace be upon him) will soon descend among you as a just judge. He will break crosses, kill swine and abolish Jizya and the wealth will pour forth to such an extent that no one will accept it.\n\nBook 1, Number 0288:\n\nThe same hadith is transmitted from Zuhri with the same chain of transmission. But in the tradition narrated by Ibn 'Uyaina the words are : \"impartial leader and just judge\" and in the tradition narrated by Yunus : the \"judge judging with justice\" and \"impartial leader\" are not mentioned. And in the hadith narrated by Salih like the one transmitted by Laith the words are : \"impartial judge\". And in the hadith transmitted by Ziyad the words are : \"Till one sajda is better than the worldand what it contains. Then Abu Huraira used to say, \"recite\" if you like: Not one of the People of the Book will fail to believe in him before his death.\n\nBook 1, Number 0289:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger or Allah (may peace be upon him) observed: I swear by Allah that the son of Mary will certainly descend as a just judge and he would definitely break the cross, and kill swine and abolish Jizya and would leave the young she-camel and no one would endeavour to (collect Zakat on it). Spite, mutual hatred and jealousy against one another will certainly disappear and when he summons people to accept wealth, not even one would do so.\n\nBook 1, Number 0290:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) observed: What will be your state when the son of Mary descends amongst you and there will be an Imam amongst you?\n\nBook 1, Number 0291:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that he heard the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) as saying: What would you do when the son of Mary would descend and lead you?\n\nBook 1, Number 0292:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) observed: What would you do when the son of Mary would descend amongst you and would lead you as one amongst you ?

I said: Explain these to me. He said: He would lead you according to the Book of your : Lord (hallowed be He and most exalted) and the Sunnah of your Apostle (may peace be upon him).\n\nBook 1, Number 0293:\n\nJabir b. 'Abdullah reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) say: A section of my people will not cease fighting for the Truth and will prevail till the Day of Resurrection. He said: Jesus son of Mary would then descend and their (Muslims') commander would invite him to come and lead them in prayer, but he would say: No, some amongst you are commanders over some (amongst you). This is the honour from Allah for this Ummah.\n\nChapter 73 : DESCRIPTION OF THE PERIOD IN WHICH IMAN WOULD NOT BE ACCEPTABLE TO ALLAH Book 1, Number 0294:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: The (Last) Hour shall not came till the sun rises from the place of its setting And on the day when it rises from the place of its setting even if all the people together affirmed their faith, it would not be of any avail to one who did not believe previously and derived no good out of his belief.\n\nBook 1, Number 0295:\n\nThis hadith has been narrated by another chain of transmitters, Abu Bakr b. Abi Shaiba, Ibn Numair, Abu Kuraib, Ibn Fudail.\n\nBook 1, Number 0296:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) observed: When three things appear faith will not benefit one who has not previously believed or has derived no good from his faith: the rising of the sun in its place of setting, the Dajjal, and the beast of the earth.\n\nBook 1, Number 0297:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Abu Dharr that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) one day said: Do you know where the sun goes? They replied: Allah and His Apostle know best. He (the Holy Prophet) observed: Verily it (the sun) glides till it reaches its resting place under the Throne. Then it falls prostrate and remains there until it is asked: Rise up and go to the place whence you came, and it goes back and continues emerging out from its rising place and then glides till it reaches its place of rest under the Throne and falls prostrate and remains in that state until it is asked : Rise up and return to the place whence you came, and it returns and emerges out from it rising place and the it glides (in such a normal way) that the people do not discern anything ( unusual in it) till it reaches its resting place under the Throne. Then it would be said to it: Rise up and emerge out from the place of your setting, and it will rise from the place of its setting. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said . Do you know when it would happen ? It would happen at the time when faith will not benefit one who has not previously believed or has derived no good from the faith.\n\nBook 1, Number 0298:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Abu Dharr that the Apostle of Allah(may peace be upon him) one day said : Do you know where the sun goes ? The remaining part of the hadith is the same.\n\nBook 1, Number 0299:\n\nAbu Dharr reported : I entered the mosque and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was sitting there. When the sun disappeared (from the sight) he said : O Abu Dharr! Do you know where it goes? He (the narrator) said : Allah and His Apostle know best. He (the Holy Prophet) said . Verily it goes and begs permission, for prostration (to Allah) and the permission is granted to it. Once it would be said: Return to the place whence you came, and then it would rise from its setting place. Then he, after the recitation of 'Abdullah recited it: And that is its appointed term.\n\nBook 1, Number 0300:\n\nAbu Dharr reported: I asked the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) the (implication of the) words of Allah, the Exalted : The sun glides to its appointed resting place. He replied: Its appointed resting place is under the Throne.\n\nChapter 74 : THE BEGINNING OF REVELATION TO THE MESSENGER OF ALLAH (MAY PEACE BE UPON HIM) Book 1, Number 0301:\n\nA'isha, the wife of the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him), reported: The first (form) with which was started the revelation to the Messenger of Allah was the true vision in sleep. And he did not see any vision but it came like the bright gleam of dawn. Thenceforth solitude became dear to him and he used to seclude himself in the cave of Hira', where he would engage in tahannuth (and that is a worship for a number of nights) before returning to his family and getting provisions again for this purpose. He would then return to Khadija and take provisions for a like period, till Truth came upon him while he was in the cave of Hira'. There came to him the angel and said : Recite, to which he replied : I am not lettered. He took hold of me [the Apostle said] and pressed me, till I was hard pressed ; thereafter he let me off and said : Recite. I said : I am not lettered. He then again took hold of me and pressed me for the second time till I was hard pressed and then let me off and said : Recite, to which I replied : I am not lettered. He took hold of me and pressed me for the third time, till I was hard pressed and then let me go and said: Recite in the name of your Lord Who created, created man from a clot of blood. Recite. And your most bountiful Lord is He Who taught the use of pen, taught man what he knew not (al-Qur'an, xcvi. 1-4). Then the Prophet returned therewith, his heart was trembling, and he went to Khadija and said : Wrap me up, wrap me up ! So they wrapped him till the fear had left him. He then said to Khadija: O Khadija! what has happened to me ? and he informed her of the happening, saying: I fear for myself. She replied: It can't be. Be happy. I swear by Allah that He shall never humiliate you. By Allah, you join ties of relationship, you speak the truth, you bear people's burden, you help the destitute, you entertain guests, and you help against the vicissitudes which affect people. Khadija then took him to Waraqa b. Naufal b. Asad b. 'Abd al-'Uzza, and he was the son of Khadija's uncle, i.e., the brother of her father. And he was the man who had embraced Christianity in the Days of Ignorance (i.e. before Islam) and he used to write books in Arabic and, therefore, wrote Injil in Arabic as God willed that he should write. He was very old and had become blind Khadija said to him: O uncle! listen to the son of your brother. Waraqa b. Naufal said: O my nephew! what did you see? The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), then, informed him what he had seen, and Waraqa said to him: It is namus that God sent down to Musa. Would that I were then (during your prophetic career) a young man. Would that I might be alive when your people would expel you! The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Will they drive me out ? Waraqa said: Yes. Never came a man with a like of what you have brought but met hostilities. If I see your day I shall help you wholeheartedly.\n\nBook 1, Number 0302:\n\nThis hadith has been narrated on the authority of 'A'isha with another chain of narrators like one transmitted by Yunus, i.e. the first thing with which the revelation was initiated with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) except the words: By Allah, Allah would never humiliate you, and Khadija said: O son of my uncle! Listen to the son of your brother.\n\nBook 1, Number 0303:\n\nThis hadith has been reported from 'A'isha by another chain of transmitters and the words are: He (the Holy Prophet) came to Khadija an his heart was trembling. The rest of the hadith has been narrated like one transmitted by Yunus and Ma'mar, but the first part is not mentioned, i.e. the first thing with which was started the revelation to the Holy Prophet was the true vision. And these words like those transmitted by Yunus are mentioned thus: By Allah, Allah would never humiliate you. And there is also a mention of the words of Khadija: O son of my uncle! Listen to the son of your brother.\n\nBook 1, Number 0304:\n\nJabir b. 'Abdullah al-Ansari who was one of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) reportedThe Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) told about the intermission of revelation and narrated While I was walking I heard a voice from the sky, and raising my head I saw the angel who had come to me in Hira', sitting on a Throne between heaven and earth I was terror-stricken on that account and came back (to my family) and said: Wrap me up, wrap me up ! So they wrapped me up, and the Blessed and Most Exalted Allah sent down: \"You who are shrouded, arise and deliver warning, your Lord magnify, your clothes cleanse, and defilement shun,\" and \"defilement\" means idols; and then the revelation was followed continuously.\n\nBook 1, Number 0305:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Jabir b. Abdullah that he heard the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) says: The wahi was intermitted for me for a small span of time and while I was walking, and then the hadith like the one narrated by Yunus was transmitted but with the exception of these words: I was terror-stricken till I fell on the ground. Abu Salama said: Defilement means idols. After this the revelation was speeded up and followed rapidly.\n\nBook 1, Number 0306:\n\nThis hadith, the like of one narrated by Yunus has also been transmitted by Ma'mar on the authority of al-Zuhri who narrated: Allah the Most Glorious and Exalted revealed this: \"You who are shrouded, arise and deliver warning, your Lord magnify, your clothes cleanse and defilement shun,\" before making the prayer obligatory. I felt terror-stricken as narrated by Uqail.\n\nBook 1, Number 0307:\n\nYahya reported: I asked Abu Salama what was revealed first from the Qur'an. He said:\" 0, the shrouded one.\" I said: Or \"Recite.\" Jabir said: I am narrating to you what was narrated to us by the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). He said: I stayed in Hira' for one month and when my stay was completed, I come down and went into the heart of the valley. Somebody called me aloud. I looked in front of me, behind me, on the right of my side and on my left, but I did not see any body. I was again called and I looked about but saw nothing. I was called again and raised my head, and there on the Throne in the open atmosphere he, i.e. Gabriel (peace be upon him) was sitting. I began to tremble on account of fear. I came to Khadija and said: Wrap me up. They wrapped me up and threw water on me and Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, sent down this: you who are shrouded! arise and deliver warning, your Lord magnify, your clothes cleanse.\"\n\nBook 1, Number 0308:\n\nYahya b Abi Kathir has reported this hadith with the same chain of transmitters and narrated: And there he was sitting on the Throne between the heaven and the earth.\n\nChapter 75 : NIGHT JOURNEY OF THE MESSENGER OF ALLAH (MAY PEACE BE UPON HIM) TO HEAVEN, AND THE PRAYER MADE OBLIGATORY Book 1, Number 0309:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: I was brought al-Buraq Who is an animal white and long, larger than a donkey but smaller than a mule, who would place his hoof a distance equal to the range of version. I mounted it and came to the Temple (Bait Maqdis in Jerusalem), then tethered it to the ring used by the prophets. I entered the mosque and prayed two rak'ahs in it, and then came out and Gabriel brought me a vessel of wine and a vessel of milk. I chose the milk, and Gabriet said: You have chosen the natural thing Then he took me to heaven. Gabriel then asked the (gate of heaven) to be opened and he was asked who he was He replied: Gabriel. He was again asked: Who is with you? He (Gabriel) said: Muhammad. It was said: Has he been sent for? Gabriel replied: He has indeed been sent for. And (the door of the heaven) was opened for us and lo ! we saw Adam. He welcomed me and prayed for my good. Then we ascended to the second heaven. Gabriel (peace be upon him) (asked the door of heaven to be opened), and he was asked who he was. He answered: Gabriel; and was again asked: Who is with you? He replied: Muhammad. It was said: Has he been sent for? He replied: He has indeed been sent for. The gate was opened. When I entered 'Isa b. Maryam and Yahya b. Zakariya (peace be upon both of them), cousins from the maternal side. welcomed me and prayed for my good Then I was taken to the third heaven and Gabriel asked for the opening (of the door). He was asked: Who are you? He replied: Gabriel. He was (again) asked: Who is with you? He replied Muhammad (may peace be upon him). It was said: Has he been sent for? He replied He has indeed been sent for. (The gate) was opened for us and I saw Yusuf (peace of Allah be upon him) who had been given half of (world) beauty. He welcomed me prayed for my well-being. Then he ascended with us to the fourth heaven. Gabriel (peace be upon him) asked for the (gate) to be opened, and it was said: Who is he? He replied: Gabriel. It was (again) said: Who is with you? He said: Muhammad. It was said: Has he been sent for? He replied: He has indeed been sent for. The (gate) was opened for us, and lo! Idris was there. He welcomed me and prayed for my well-being (About him) Allah, the Exalted and the Glorious, has said: \"We elevated him (Idris) to the exalted position\" (Qur'an xix. 57). Then he ascended with us to the fifth heaven and Gabriel asked for the (gate) to be opened. It was said: Who is he? He replied Gabriel. It was (again) said: Who is with thee? He replied: Muhammad. It was said Has he been sent for ? He replied: He has indeed been sent for. (The gate) was opened for us and then I was with Harun (Aaron-peace of Allah be upon him). He welcomed me prayed for my well-being. Then I was taken to the sixth heaven. Gabriel (peace be upon him) asked for the door to be opened. It was said: Who is he? He replied: Gabriel. It was said : Who is with thee? He replied: Muhammad. It was said : Has he been sent for ? He replied : He has indeed been sent for. (The gate) was opened for us and there I was with Musa (Moses peace be upon him) He welcomed me and prayed for my well-being. Then I was taken up to the seventh heaven. Gabriel asked the (gate) to be opened. It was said: Who is he ? He said : Gabriel It was said . Who is with thee ? He replied : Muhammad (may peace be upon him.) It was said : Has he been sent for ? He replied : He has indeed been sent for. (The gate) was opened for us and there I found Ibrahim (Abrahampeace be upon him) reclining against the Bait-ul-Ma'mur and there enter into it seventy thousand angels every day, never to visit (this place) again Then I was taken to Sidrat-ul-Muntaha whose leaves were like elephant ears and its fruit like big earthenware vessels. And when it was covered by the Command of Allah, it underwent such a change that none amongst the creation has the power to praise its beauty. Then Allah revealed to me a revelation and He made obligatory for me fifty prayers every day and night. Then I went down to Moses (peace be upon him) and he said : What has your Lord enjoined upon your Ummah ? I said : Fifty prayers. He said : Return to thy Lord and beg for reduction (in the number of prayers), for your community shal1 not be able to bear this burden. as I have put to test the children of Isra'il and tried them (and found them too weak to bear such a heavy burden). He (the Holy Prophet) said: I went back to my Lord and said: My Lord, make things lighter for my Ummah. (The Lord) reduced five prayers for me. I went down to Moses and said. (The Lord) reduced five (prayers) for me, He said: Verily thy Ummah shall not be able to bear this burden ; return to thy Lord and ask Him to make things lighter. I then kept going back and forth between my Lord Blessed and Exalted and Moses, till He said: There are five prayers every day and night. O Muhammad, each being credited as ten, so that makes fifty prayers. He who intends to do a good deed and does not do it will have a good deed recorded for him ; and if he does it, it will be recorded for him as ten; whereas he who intends to do an evil deed and does not do, it will not be recorded for him; and if he does it, only one evil deed will be recorded. I then came down and when I came to Moses and informed him, he said: Go back to thy Lord and ask Him to make things lighter. Upon this the Messenger of Allah remarked : I returned to my Lord until I felt ashamed before Him.\n\nBook 1, Number 0310:\n\nIt is narrated on the the outhority of Anas b. Malik that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: (the angels) came to me and took me to the Zamzam and my heart was opened and washed with the water of Zamzam and then I was left (at my place).\n\nBook 1, Number 0311:\n\nAnas b. Malik reported that Gabriel came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upo him) while he was playing with his playmates. He took hold of him and lay him prostrate on the ground and tore open his breast and took out the heart from it and then extracted a blood-clot out of it and said : That was the part of Satan in thee. And then he washed it with the water of Zamzam in a golden basin and then it was joined together and restored to it place. The boys came running to his mother, i.e. his nurse, and said: Verily Muhammad has been murdered. They all rushed toward him (and found him all right) His color was changed, Anas said. I myself saw the marks of needle on his breast.\n\nBook 1, Number 0312:\n\nAnas b. Malik,while recountig the Night journey of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him), from the mosque of Ka'bah, reported : Three beings (angels) came to him in the osque of the Ka'bah, while he was sleeping in the sacred mosque before it (the Command of Night Journey and Accension) was revealed to him. The rest of the hadith is narrated like that of Thabit. However, some portions have occurred before and some of them have occurred after ; some have been added and some deleted.\n\nBook 1, Number 0313:\n\nAnas b. Malik reported : Abu Dharr used to relate that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: The roof of my house was cleft when I was in Mecca and Gabriel descended and opened my heart and then washed it with the water of Zamzam.He then brought a gold basin full of wisdom and faith and after emptying it into my breast, he closed it up. Then taking me by he hand, he ascended with me to th heaven, and when we came to the lowest heaven, Gabriel said to the guardian of the lowest heaven: Open. He asked who was there? He replied . It is Gabriel. He again asked whe he there was someone with him. He replied: Yes, it is Muhammad with me. He was asked if he had been sent for, He (Gabriel) said: Yes . Then he opened (the gate). When we ascended the lowest heaven (I saw) a man seated with parties on his right side and parties on his left side. When he looked up to his right, he laughed and when he looked to his left, he wept. He said: Welcome to the righteous apostle and the righteous son. I asked Gabriel who he was and he replied: He is Adam (peace be upon him) and these parties on his right and on his left are the souls of his descendants. Those of them on his right are the inmates of Paradise and the parties which are on his left side are the inmates of Hell ; so when he looked towards his right side, he laughed, and when he looked towards his left side, he wept. Then Gabriel ascended with me to the second heaven. He asked its guardian to open (its gate), and its guardian replied in the same way as the guardian of the lowest heaven had said. He (opened it). Anas b. Malik said: He (the Holy Prophet) mentioned that he found in the heavens Adam, Idris, Jesus, Moses and Abraham (may peace be on all of them), but he did not ascertain as to the nature of their abodes except that he had found Adam in the lowest heaven and Abraham in the sixth heaven. When Gabriel and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) passed by Idris (peace be upon him) he said : Welcome to the righteous apostle and righteous brother. He (the narrator) said: He then proceeded and said : Who is he ? Gabriel replied : It is Idris. Then I passed by Moses (peace be upon him) and he said: Welcome tothe righteous apostle and righteous brother. I said to (Gabriel) : Who is he ? He replied : It is Moses. Then I passed by Jesus and he said : Welcome to the righteous apostle and righteous brother. I said (to Gabriel) : Who is he ? He replied : Jesus, son of Mary. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Then I went to Ibrahim (peace be upon him). He said: Welcome to the righteous apostle and righteous son. I asked : Who is he ? He (Gabriel) replied : It is Abraham. Ibn Shihab said: Ibn Hazm told me that Ibn 'Abbas and Abd Habba al-Ansari used to say that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said : Thereafter he ascended with me till I was taken to such a height where I heard the scraping of the pens. Ibn Hazm and Anas told that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said : Allah then made fifty prayers obligatory for my Ummah and I returned with that and passed by Moses. Moses, (peace be upon him) said : What has thy Lord enjoined on thy people ? I said : Fifty prayers have been made obligatory on them. Moses (peace be upon him) said : Return to thy Lord, for thy Ummah would not be able to bear this burden. Then I came back to my Lord and He remitted a portion out of thut. I then again went to Moses (peace be upon him) and informed him about it He said : Return to thy Lord, for thy Ummah shall not be able to bear this burden. I then went back to my Lord and He said : They are five and at the same time fifty, and what has been said will not be changed. I then returned to Moses and he said: Go back to thy Lord. whereupon I said : I feel ashamed of my Lord. Gabriel then travelled with me till we came to the farthest lote-tree Many a colour had covered it which I do not know. Then I was admitted to Paradise and saw in it domes of pearls, and its soil of musk.\n\nBook 1, Number 0314:\n\nAnas b. Malik reported on the authority of Malik b. Sa sa', perhaps a person of his tribe, that the Prophet of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: I was near the House (i.e. Ka'bah) in a state between sleep and wakefulness when I heard someone say : He is the third among the two persons. Then he came to me and took me with him. Then a golden basin containing the water of Zamzam was brought to me and my heart was opened up to such and such (part). Qatada said: I asked him who was with me (i e. the narrator) and what he meant by such and such (part). He replied: (It means that it was opened) up to the lower part of his abdomen (Then the hadith continues): My heart was extracted and it was washed with the water of Zamzam and then it was restored in its original position, after which it was filled with faith and wisdom. I was then brought a white beast which is called al-Buraq, bigger than a donkey and smaller than a mule. Its stride was as long as the eye could reach. I was mounted on it, and then we went forth till we reached the lowest heaven. Gabriel asked for the (gate) to be opened, and it was said: Who is he? He replied: Gabriel .It was again said: Who is with thee? He replied: Muhammad (may peace be upon him). It was said: Has he been sent for? He (Gabriel) said: Yes. He (the Prophet) said : Then (the gate) was opened for us (and it was said) : Welcome unto him ! His is a blessed arrival. Then we came to Adam (peace be upon him). And he (the narrator) narrated the whole account of the hadith. (The Holy Prophet) observed that he met Jesus in the second heaven, Yahya (peace be on both of them) in the third heaven, Yusuf in the third, Idris in the fourth, Harun in the fifth (peace and blessings of Allah be upon them). Then we travelled on till we reached the sixth heaven and came to Moses (peace be upon him) and I greeted him and he said: Welcome unto righteous brother and righteous prophet. And when I passed (by him) he wept, and a voice was heard saying: What makes thee weep ? He said: My Lord, he is a young man whom Thou hast sent after me (as a prophet) and his followers will enter Paradise in greater numbers than my followers. Then we travelled on till we reached the seventh heaven and I came to Ibrahim. He (the narrator) narrat- ed in this hadith that the Prophet of Allah (may peace be upon him) told that he saw four rivers which flowed from (the root of the lote-tree of the farthest limits) : two manifest rivers and two hidden rivers. I said : ' Gabriel ! what are these rivers ? He replied :The two hidden rivers are the rivers of Paradise, and as regards the two manifest ones, they are the Nile and the Euphrates. Then the Bait-ul-Ma'mur was raised up to me. I said : O Gabriel! what is this? He replied: It is the Bait-ul-Ma'mur. Seventy thousand angels enter into it daily and, after they come out, they never return again. Two vessels were then brought to me. The first one contained wine and the second one contained milk, and both of them were placed before me. I chose milk. It was said: You did right. Allah will guide rightly through you your Ummah on the natural course. Then fifty prayers daily were made obligatory for me. And then he narrated the rest of the hadith to the end.\n\nBook 1, Number 0315:\n\nIt is reported on the authority of Malik b. Sa'sa' that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) narrated the hadith (mentioned above) and added to it : I was brought a gold basin full of wisdom and faith, and then the (part of the body) right from the upper end of the chest to the lower part of the abdomen was opened and it was washed with the water of Zamzam and then flled with wisdom and faith.\n\nBook 1, Number 0316:\n\nQatada reported that he heard Abu al-'Aliya saying that the cousin of your Prophet (may peace be upon him), i.e. Ibn Abbas, told him: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), while narrating his night journey observed : Musa (peace be upon him) was a man of high stature as if he was of the people of the Shanu'a (tribe), and Jesus was a well-built person having curly hair. He also mentioned Malik, the guardian of Hell, and Dajjal.\n\nBook 1, Number 0317:\n\nAbu al-'Aliya reported : Ibn Abbas, the son of your Prophet's uncle, told us that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had observed : On the night of my night journey I passed by Moses b. 'Imran (peace be upon him), a man light brown in complexion, tall. well-built as if he was one of the men of the Shanu'a, and saw Jesus son of Mary as a medium-statured man with white and red complexion and crisp hair, and I was shown Malik the guardian of Fire, and Dajjal amongst the signs which were shown to me by Allah. He (the narrator) observed : Then do not doubt his (i.e. of the Holy Prophet) meeting with him (Moses). Qatada elucidated it thus: Verily the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him), met Moses (peace be upon him).\n\nBook 1, Number 0318:\n\nAbu al-'Aliya narrated it on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) passed through the valley of Azraq, and he asked: Which valley is this? They said: This is the valley of Azraq, and he observed: (I perceive) as if I am seeing Moses (peace be upon him) coming down from the mountain track, and he is calling upon Allah loudly (saying: Here I am ! at your service ! ). Then he came to the mountain track of Harsha. He (the Holy Prophet) said : Which is this mountain track ? They said : It is the mountain track of Harsha. He observed (I feel) as If I am seeing Yunus (Jonah-peace be upon him) son of Matta on a well- built red dromedary, with a cloak of wool around him and the rein of his dromedary is made of the fibres of date-palm, and he is calling upon Allah (saying: Here I am ! at your service, my Lord!). Ibn Hanbal said in the hadith narrated by him: Hushaim said that the meaning of khulba was fibre of date-palm.\n\nBook 1, Number 0319:\n\nAbu al-'Aliya narrated it on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said: We travelled with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) between Mecca and Medina and we passed by a valley. He (the Holy Prophet) asked: Which valley is this? They said: This is the valley of Azraq Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) remarked: (I feel) as if I am seeing Moses (peace be upon him), and then he described something about his complexion and hair, which Diwud (the narrator) could not remember. He (Moses, as described by the Holy Prophet) was keeping his fingers in his ears and was responding loudly to Allah (saying: I am as Thy service, my Lord) while passing through that valley. We then travelled (further) till we came to the mountain trail. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Which mountain trail is this? They said: It is the Harsha or Lift. He (the Holy Prophet) said: (I perceive) as if I am seeing Yunus on a red camel, with a cloak of wool around him. The halter of his camel was that of the fibre of date-palm, and he was passing through the valley saying: I am at Thy service! my Lord.\n\nBook 1, Number 0320:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Mujahid that he said: We were with Ibn 'Abbas and (the people) talked about al-Dajjal. (One of them remarked. There is written between his eyes (the word) Kafir (infidel). The narrator said: Ibn 'Abbas remarked: I did not hear him (the Holy Prophet) say it, but he said: So far as Ibrahim is concerned. you may see your companion and so far as Moses is concerned, he is a well-built man with wheat complexion (riding) on a red camel with its halter made of the fibre of date-palm (and I perceive) as if I am seeing towards him as he is going down in the valley saying: I am at Thy service ! my Lord.\n\nBook 1, Number 0321:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Jabir that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: There appeared before me the apostles, and Moses was among men as if he was one of the people of Shanu'a, and I saw Jesus son of Mary (peace be upon him) and I saw nearest in resemblance with him was 'Urwa b. Mas'ud, and I saw Ibrahim (blessings of Allah be upon him) and I see your companions much in resemblance with him, i.e. his personality, and I saw Gabriel (peace be upon him) and I saw Dihya nearest in resemblance to him; but in the narration of Ibn Rumh it is Dihya b. Khalifa.\n\nBook 1, Number 0322:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: When I was taken for the night journey I met Moses peace be upon him). The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) gave his description thus: He was a man, I suppose-and he (the narrator) was somewhat doubtful (that the Holy Prophet observed): (Moses) was a man erect in stature with straight hair on his head as it he was one of the men of the Shanu'a; and I met Jesus and the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) described him as one having a medium stature and a red complexion as if he had (just) come out of the bath He observed: I saw Ibrahim (peace be upon him) and amongst his children I have the greatest resemblance with him. He said: There were brought to me two vessels. In one of them was milk and in the other one there was wine. And it was said to me: Select any one you like. So I selected the vessel containing milk and drank it. He (the angel) said: You have been guided on al-fitra or you have attained al-fitra. Had you selected wine, your Ummah would have been misled.\n\nChapter 76 : PERTAINING TO JESUS SON OF MARY AND AL-MASIH AL-DAJJAL Book 1, Number 0323:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of 'Abdullah b. Umar that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: I found myself one night near the Ka'bah, and I saw a man with wheat complexion amongst the fair-complexioned men that you ever saw. He had a lock of hair the most beautiful of the locks that you ever saw. He had combed it. Water was trickling out of them. He was leaning on two men, or on the shoulders of two men, and he was circumscribing the Ka'bah. I asked, What is he? It was said: He is al-Masih son of Mary. Then I saw another person, stout and having too much curly hair , and blind in his right eye as if it was a full swollen grape. I asked Who is he? It was said:He is al-Masih al-Dajjal.\n\nBook 1, Number 0324:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of 'Abdulldh b. Umar that one day the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) mentioned in the presence of people about al-Masih al-Dajjal. He said: Verily Allah (hallowed be He and High) is not blind of one eye. Behold, but the Masih al-Dajjal is blind of right eye as if his eye is like a swollen grape, and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: I was shown in a dream in the night that near the Ka'bah there was a man fair-complexioned, fine amongst the white-complexioned men that you ever saw, his locks of hair were falling on his shoulders. He was a man whose hair were neither too curly nor too straight, and water trickled down from his head. He was placing his bands on the shoulders of two persons and amidst them was making a circuit around the Ka'bah. I said: Who is he? They replied: Al-Masih son of Mary. And I saw behind him a man with intensely curly hair, blind of right eye. Amongst the persons I have ever seen Ibn Qatan has the greatest resemblance with him. He was making a circuit around the Ka'bah by placing both his hands on the shoulders of two persons. I said: Who is he? They said; It is al-Masih al-Dajjal.\n\nBook 1, Number 0325:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: I saw near the Ka'bah a man of fair complexion with straight hair, placing his hands on two persons. Water was flowing from his head or it was trickling from his head. I asked: Who is he? They said: He is Jesus son of Mary or al-Masih son of Mary. The narrator) says: I do not remember which word it was. He (the Holy Prophet) said: And I saw behind him a man with red complexion and thick curly hair, blind in the right eye. I saw in him the greatest resemblance with Ibn Qitan I asked: Who is he? They replied: It is al-Masih al-Dajjal.\n\nBook 1, Number 0326:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Jabir b. 'Abdullah that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: When the Quraish belied me, I was staying in Hatim and Allah lifted before me Bait-ul-Maqdis and I began to narrate to them (the Quraish of Mecca) its signs while I was in fact looking at it.\n\nBook 1, Number 0327:\n\n'Abdullah reported on the authority of his father 'Umar b. Khattab that he heard from the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) say: I was sleeping when I saw myself making circuit around the Ka'bah, and I saw there a man of fair complexion with straight hair between two men.

Then I moved forward and cast a glance and there was a bulky man of red complexion with thick locks of hair on his head, blind of one eye as it his eye was a swollen grape. I asked: Who is he? They said : He is Dajjal. He had close resemblance with Ibn Qatan amongst men.\n\nBook 1, Number 0328:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said : I found myself in Hijr and the Quraish were asking me about my might journey. I was asked about things pertaining to Bait-ul-Maqdis which I could not preserve (in my mind). I was very much vexed, so vexed as I had never been before. Then Allah raised it (Bait-ul-Maqdis) before my eyes. I looked towards it, and I gave them the information about whatever they questioned me I also saw myself among the group of apostles. I saw Moses saying prayer and found him to be a well-built man as if he was a man of the tribe of Shanu'a. I saw Jesus son of Mary (peace be upon him) offering prayer, of all of men he had the closest resemblance with 'Urwa b. Masu'd al-Thaqafi. I saw Ibrahim (peace be upon him) offering prayer; he had the closest resemblance with your companion (the Prophet himself) amongst people. When the time of prayer came I led them. When I completed the prayer, someone said: Here is Malik, the keeper of the Hell; pay him salutations. I turned to him, but he preceded me in salutation.\n\nChapter 77 : CONCERNING SIDRAT-UL-MUNTAHA (REMOTEST LOTE-TREE) Book 1, Number 0329:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Abdullah (b. Umar) that when the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was taken for the Night journey, he was taken to Sidrat-ul-Muntaha, which is situated on the sixth heaven, where terminates everything that ascends from the earth and is held there, and where terminates every- thing that descends from above it and is held there. (It is with reference to this that) Allah said: \"When that which covers covered the lote-tree\" (al-Qur'an, Iiii. 16). He (the narrator) said: (It was) gold moths. He (the narrator further) said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was given three (things): he was given five prayers, be was given the concluding verses of Sura al-Baqara, and remission of serious Sins for those among his Ummah who associate not anything with Allah\n\nBook 1, Number 0330:\n\nAl-Shaibini reported to us: I asked Zirr b. Hubaish about the words of Allah (the Mighty and Great): \"So he was (at a distance) of two bows or nearer\" (al-Qur'an, Iiii 8). He said: Ibn Mas'ud informed me that, verily, the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) saw Gabriel and he had six hundred wings.\n\nBook 1, Number 0331:\n\nAl-Shaibani narrated on the authority of Zirr who narrated it on this authority of Abdullah that the (words of Allah): \"The heart belied not what he saw\" (al Qur'an, Iiii. 11) imply that he saw Gabriel (peace be upon him) and he had six hundred wings.\n\nBook 1, Number 0332:\n\nZirr b. Hubaish narrated it on the authority of 'Abdullah (that the words of Allah): \"Certainly he saw of the greatest signs of Allah\" (al-Qur'an, liii. 18) imply that he saw Gabriel in his (original) form and he had six hundred wings.\n\nBook 1, Number 0333:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the (words of Allah): \"And certainly he saw him in another descent\" (al-Qur'an, Iiii. 13) imply that he saw Gabriel.\n\nChapter 78 : THE MEANING OF THE WORDS OF ALLAH: \"HE SAW HIM IN ANOTHER DESCENT\" (AL-QUR'AN, LIII. 13). DID THE APOSTLE (MAY PEACE BE UPON HIM) SEE HIS LORD ON THE NIGHT OF HIS JOURNEY (TO HEAVEN)? Book 1, Number 0334:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he (the Holy Prophet) saw (Allah) with, his heart.\n\nBook 1, Number 0335:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Ibn Abbas that the words: \"The heart belied not what he saw\" (al-Qur'an, Iiii. 11) and \"Certainly he saw Him in another descent\" (al-Qur'an, Iiii. 13) imply that he saw him twice with his heart.\n\nBook 1, Number 0336:\n\nAbu Bakr b. Abi Shaiba narrated it on the same authorities.\n\nBook 1, Number 0337:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Masruq that he said: I was resting at (the house of) 'A'isha that she said: O Abu 'A'isha (kunya of Masruq), there are three things, and he who affirmed even one of them fabricated the greatest lie against Allah. I asked that they were. She said: He who presumed that Muhammad (may peace be upon him) saw his Lord (with his ocular vision) fabricated the greatest lie against Allah. I was reclining but then sat up and said: Mother of the Faithful, wait a bit and do not be in a haste. Has not Allah (Mighty and Majestic) said: \"And truly he saw him on the clear horizon\" (al-Qur'an, lxxxi. 23) and \"he saw Him in another descent\" (al-Qur'an, iiii. 13)? She said: I am the first of this Ummah who asked the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) about it, and he said: Verily he is Gabriel. I have never seen him in his original form in which he was created except on those two occasions (to which these verses refer); I saw him descending from the heaven and filling (the space) from the sky to the earth with the greatness of his bodily structure. She said: Have you not heard Allah saying. \"Eyes comprehend Him not, but He comprehends (all) vision. and He is Subtle, and All-Aware\" (al-Qur'an, v. 104)? (She, i.e. 'A'isha, further said): Have you not heard that, verily, Allah says: \"And it is not vouchsafed to a human being that Allah should speak unto him otherwise than by revelation, or from behind a veil, or that He sendeth a messenger (angel), so that he revealth whatsoever He wills. Verily He is Exalted. Wise\" (al. Qur'an, xii. 51)She said: He who presumes that the Messengerof Allah (may peace be upon him) concealed anything, from the Book, of Allah fabricates the greatest lie against Allah. Allah says: \"O Messenger ! deliver that which has been revealed to thee from thy Lord, and if thou do (it) not, thou hast not delivered His message\" (al-Qur'an, v. 67). She said: He who presumes that he would inform about what was going to happen tomorrow fabricates the greatest lie against Allah. And Allah says \"Say thou (Muhammad): None in the heavens and the earth knoweth the unseen save Allah\" (al-Qur'an, xxvii 65).\n\nBook 1, Number 0338:\n\nDawud reported on the same authorities the hadith as narrated above by Ibn 'Uliyya and added: She ('A'isha) said: If Muhammad were to conceal anything which was sent to him, he would have certainly concealed this verse: \"And when thou saidst to him on whom Allah had conferred favour and thou too had conferred favour: Keep thy wife to thyself and fear Allah, and thou wast concealing in thy heart that which Allah was going to disclose, and thou wast fearing men while Allah has a better right that thou shouldst fear Him.\"\n\nBook 1, Number 0339:\n\nMasruq reported: I asked 'A'isha if Muhammad (may peace be upon him) had seen his Lord. She replied: Hallowed be Allah, my hair stood on end when you said this, and he (Masruq) narrated the hadith as narrated above. The hadith reported by Diwud is more complete and longer.\n\nBook 1, Number 0340:\n\nMasruq reported: I said to 'A'isha: What about the words of Allah: \"Then he drew nigh and came down, so he was at a distance of two bows or closer still: so He revealed to His servant what He revealed\" (al-Qur'an, liii. 8-10)? She said: It implies Gabriel. He used to come to him (the Holy Prophet) in the shape of men; but he came at this time in his true form and blocked up the horizon of the sky.\n\nChapter 79 : PERTAINING TO HIS (PROPHET'S) WORDS: HE IS A LIGHT; HOW COULD I SEE HIM?-AND HIS WORDS: I SAW THE LIGHT Book 1, Number 0341:\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Abu Dharr : I asked the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him): Did you see thy Lord? He said: He is a Light;.bow could I see Him?\n\nBook 1, Number 0342:\n\nAbdullah b. Shaqiq reported: I said to Abu Dharr: Had I seen the Messenger of Allah, I would have asked him. He (Abu Dharr) said: What is that thing that you wanted to inquire of him ? He said: I wanted to ask him whether he had seen his Lord. Abu Dharr said: I, in fact, inquired of him, and he replied: I saw Light.\n\nBook 1, Number 0343:\n\nAbu Musa reported: The Messenger ofallah (may peace be upon him) was standing amongst us and he told us five things. He said: Verily the Exalted and Mighty God does not sleep, and it does not befit Him to sleep. He lowers the scale and lifts it. The deeds in the night are taken up to Him before the deeds of the day. and the deeds of the day before the deeds of the night. His veil is the light. In the hadith narrated by Abu Bakr (instead of the word \"light\") it is fire. If he withdraws it (the veil), the splendour of His countenance would consume His creation so far as His sight reaches.\n\nBook 1, Number 0344:\n\nA'mash has narrated this hadith on the same authority and said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was standing amongst us and he told us four things. He then narrated the hadith like the one reported by Abu Mua'wiya, but did not mention the words \"His creation\" and said: His veil is the light.\n\nBook 1, Number 0345:\n\nAbu Musa reported: The Messenger of Allah (znay peace be upon him) was standing amongst us and (he said) four (things) : Verily Allah dock not sleep and it does not befit Him to sleep. He raises the scale and lowers it. The deeds of the day are presented to Him in the night and the deeds of the night in the day.\n\nChapter 80 : IN PROOF OF THE FACT THAT THE BELIEVERS WOULD SEE THEIR LORD (HALLOWED BE HE AND EXALTED) ON THE LAST DAY Book 1, Number 0346:\n\n'Abdullah b. Qais transmitted on the authority of his father (Abu Musa Ash'ari) that the Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: There would be two gardens (in Paradise) the vessels and contents of which would be of silver, and two gardens whose vessels and contents would be of gold. The only thing intervening to hinder the people from looking at their Lord will be the mantle of Grandeur over His face in the Garden of Eden.\n\nBook 1, Number 0347:\n\nSuhaib reported the Apostle (may peace be upon him) saying: When those deserving of Paradise would enter Paradise, the Blessed and the Exalted would ask: Do you wish Me to give you anything more? They would say: Hast Thou not brightened our faces? Hast Thou not made us enter Paradise and saved us from Fire? He (the narrator) said: He (God) would lift the veil, and of things given to them nothing would he dearer to them than the sight of their Lord, the Mighty and the Glorious.\n\nBook 1, Number 0348:\n\nHammad b. Salama narrated it on the same authority and added: He then recited the verse: \"Those who do good will have the best reward and even more\" (x. 26)\n\nChapter 81 : THE WAY IN WHICH THE BELIEVERS WOULD SEE THE LORD Book 1, Number 0349:\n\nAbu Haraira reported: The people said to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him): Messenger of Allah, shall we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection? The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Do you feel any trouble in seeing the moon on the night when it is full? They said: Messenger of Allah, no. He (the Messenger) further said: Do you feel any trouble in seeing the sun, when there is no cloud over it? They said: Messenger of Allah. no. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Verily you would see Him like this (as you see the sun and the moon). God will gather people on the Day of Resurrection and say: Let every people follow what they worshipped. Those who worshipped the sun would follow the sun, and those who worshipped the moon would follow the moon, and those who worshipped the devils would follow the devils. This Ummah (of Islam) alone would be left behind and there would be hypocrites too amongst it. Allah would then come to them in a form other than His own Form, recognisable to them, and would say: I am your Lord. They would say: We take refuge with Allah from thee. We will stay here till our Lord comes to us. and when our Lord would come we would recognise Him. Subsequently Allah would come to them in His own Form, recognisable to them, and say: I am your Lord. They would say: Thou art our Lord. And they would follow Him, and a bridge would be set over the Hell; and I (the Holy Prophet) and my Ummah would be the first to pass over it; and none but the messengers would speak on that day, and the prayer of the messengers on that day would be: O Allah ! grant safety, grant safety. In Hell, there would be long spits like the thorns of Sa'dan He (the Holy Prophet) said: Have you seen Sa'dan? They replied: Yea, Messenger of Allah. He said: Verily those (hooks) would be like the thorns of Sa'dan, but no one knows their size except Allah. These would seize people for their misdeeds. Some of them would escape for their (good) deeds, and some would be rewarded for their deeds till they get salvation. When Allah would finish judging His bondsmen and because of His mercy decide to take out of Hell such people as He pleases. He would command the angels to bring out those who had not associated anything with Allah; to whom Allah decided to show mercy. those who would say: There is no god but Allah. They (the angels) would recognise them in the Fire by the marks of prostration, for Hell-fire will devour everything (limb) of the sons of Adam except the marks of prostra- tion. Allah has forbidden the fire to consume the marks of prostration. They will be taken out of the Fire having been burnt, and the water of life would be poured over them, and they will sprout as seed does In the silt carried by flood. Then Allah would finish judging amongst His bondsmen; but a man who will be the last to enter Paradise will remain facing Hell and will say: O my Lord I turn my face away from Hell, for its air has poisoned me ard its blaze has burnt me. He will then call to Allah as long as Allah would wish that he should call to Him. Then Allah, Blessed and Exalted, would say: If I did that, perhaps you would ask for more than that. He would say: I would not ask You more than this, and he would give his Lord covenants and agreements as Allah wished, and so He would turn his face away from the Fire When he turns towards the Paradise and sees it, he will remain silent as long as Allah wishes him to remain so. He will then say: O my Lord I bring me forward to the gate of the Paradise. Allah would say to him: Did you not give covenants and agreements that you would not ask for anything besides what I had given you. Woe to thee ! O son of Adam, how treacherous you are ! He would say: O my Lord ! and would continue calling to Allah till He. would say to him: If I grant you that, perhaps you will ask for more. He will reply: No, by Thy greatness, and he will give His Lord promises and covenants as Allah had wished He would then bring him to the gate of the Paradise, and when he would stand at the gate of the Paradise, it would lay open before him. and he would see the bounty and the joy that there is in it. He would remain quiet as long as Allah would desire him to remain silent. He would then say: O my Lord, admit me to Paradise. Allah. Blessed and Exalted, would say: Did you not give covenants and agreements that you would not ask for anything more than what I had granted you? Woe to you ! son of Adam, how treacherous you are! And he would say: O my Lord, I do not wish to be the most miserable of Thy creatures. He would continue calling upon Allah till Allah. Blessed and Exalted. would laugh. When Allah would laugh at him. He would say: Enter the Paradise. When he would enter, Allah would say: State your wish. He would express his wishes till Allah would remind him (the desire of) such and such (things). When his desires would be exhausted Allah would say: That is for thee and, besides it, the like of it also. 'Ata' b. Yazid said: Abu Sa'id al-Khudri was with Abu Huraira and be did not reject anything from the hadith narrated by him, but when Abu Huraira narrated: \"Allah said to that man; ind its like along with it,\" Abu Sa'id said: \"Ten like it along with it,\" O Abu Huraira. Abu Huraira said: I do not remember except the words: \"That is for you and a similar one along with it.\" Abu Sa'id said: I bear witness to the fact that I remembered from the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) his words: \"That is for thee and ten like it.\" Abu Huraira said: That man was the last of those deserving of Paradise to enter Paradise.\n\nBook 1, Number 0350:\n\nAbu Huraira reported: The people said to the A"
