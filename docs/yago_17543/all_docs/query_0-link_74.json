Key leaders of the TTP – including its ‘commanders’ in Swat, Bajaur Agency and Mohmand Agency Maulana Fazalullah, Maulvi Faqir and Abdul Wali – and dozens of their loyalists had fled military operations and sought sanctuary in the Afghan provinces of Nuristan and Kunar. Sporadically, they have been mounting cross-border attacks on Pakistani border guards in Chitral and Dir Districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. They have introduced “moral policing” on the pattern of the Taliban-era ‘Department for the Preservation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice’ in Kamdesh District of Nuristan province. Their armed vigilantes roam the streets to stop what they believe are un-Islamic activities. “Turbaned and bearded Pakistani Taliban fighters, clad in black clothes, punish local people for shaving or trimming beards, using mobile phones and even eating Naswar,” Provincial Police Chief Ghulamullah Nuristani told The Express Tribune by phone. These vigilantes, according to Nuristani, are affiliated with a TTP group, led by Maulana Fazlullah, the infamous cleric who had fled his stronghold in Swat District following a military operation in 2008. However, Sirajuddin, a TTP ‘spokesperson’, denied the claim. So did the Afghan Taliban. The Taliban’s shadowy Governor for Nuristan, Sheikh Dost Muhammad, dismissed Nuristan’s claim as “part of propaganda to undermine the Taliban’s growing popularity in the region”.

During sentencing proceeding, the US district court found that all three of Awan's crimes intended to promote crimes of terrorism, and imposed a prison sentence of 14 years. Khalid Awan was convicted in 2006 by a United States (US) federal jury in Brooklyn for providing financial aid to KCF. In a statement, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said KCF comprises Sikh militants seeking a separate Sikh State in Punjab and has been responsible for thousands of deaths in India since it was founded in 1986. The organisation has engaged in numerous assassinations of prominent Indian government officials — including that of Chief Minister Beant Singh of Punjab in 1995 — and hundreds of bombings, acts of sabotage, and kidnappings.

You should interview the victim families and dig deeper to know who is responsible for this massacre,” Justice Chaudhry said. The figures provided by the Home Department were different from the report of the Intelligence Bureau (IB). The IB, in its report, said 52 bodies were found dumped this year [2012], but the Home Department said 44 bodies were found during the past three months.

A statement issued by the HRCP says, it is a matter of concern that forced disappearances still continue in Pakistan. The HRCP has been trying to verify and document cases of forced disappearances for years now and has no hesitation in admitting that verification of the actual number, particularly in Balochistan, has been quite difficult and sometimes impossible. The nationalists claim the figure is in thousands and the people must respect their views. The authorities have put the number from scores to several hundred, which obviously is an understatement.

Reportedly, the outfit later burnt tyres and forced shopkeepers to close down their shops. Meanwhile, unidentified people hurled a grenade at the protesting ASWJ cadres.

He said, “Islamabad does not understand the importance of the Balochistan issue” and this attitude was encouraging the anti-Pakistan elements to misguide jobless Baloch youths. Other countries were spending money to achieve their nefarious designs, he added. The CM said the Federal Government was not providing funds for the departments devolved to his province under the 18th Amendment. There was no provision in the 18th Amendment or the NFC Award that the provinces would bear all expenditures of the departments transferred to them, he added. Raisani said all provinces, including Balochistan, had pleaded on the eve of the NFC award and the 18th Amendment that they would not bear expenditures of devolved departments. “If the federal government does not accept this principle, it should take back the Gwadar port and other devolved departments.” He said the Aghaz-i-Haqooq-i-Balochistan package, under which the Chief Minister was made chairman of the Gwadar Development Authority, was not fully implemented so far.

The Ministry of Public Security published the names of the suspects, all apparently ethnic Uighurs, on its website (www.mps.gov.cn) late on April 5, along with their photographs and an outline of their alleged crimes. All six had spent time in what the ministry called “a certain south Asian country” – a likely reference to Pakistan – where they were trained to carry out terror attacks and incited militants in China to carry out suicide bombings and knife attacks. Some Chinese officials have blamed attacks on Muslim militants trained in Pakistan, though the Foreign Ministry has refrained from public criticism of the neighbour. Both Chinese and Pakistani officials have said that the militants based in western China have ties to the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and other militants in north-western Pakistani regions along the Afghanistan border. Officials in Kashgar, a city in south Xinjiang, said a stabbing attack there in July 2011 was orchestrated by members of the separatist East Turkestan Islamic Movement who trained in Pakistan before returning to China.

Gilani made the remarks while responding to points raised by lawmakers during a joint session of the National Assembly and Senate about the USD 10 million bounty offered by the US for Saeed, the founder of the Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT). The premier said this was an internal issue of Pakistan and \"if there is any concrete proof against Saeed then it should be provided to Pakistan, which has an independent judiciary\". He pointed out that cases against Saeed were dismissed in the past due to lack of evidence. Further, PM Yousaf Raza Gilani said that the US bounty on Hafiz Saeed would send a “wrong signal” at a time when the two countries were embarking upon new dimensions. “This is purely an internal issue of Pakistan and the US has been asked to provide evidence [against Saeed], if they have any, to the Pakistani government… This was also conveyed to the US deputy secretary of state that when new rules of engagements are being defined, they should send a positive signal to Pakistan,” Gilani added.

The seven people were picked up during a raid in Quetta’s Sariab Mill area on March 1 and had been listed ‘missing’ since then. Police, who had earlier been declining having information about the missing persons, produced four of seven people. The four were Hazar Khan, Mazar Khan, Malik Sher and Javed Marri. Justice Chaudhry suspended New Sariab SHO Noor Baksh Mengal for his false statement about the missing persons and directed Police to arrest him. The Chief Justice said he would also suspend the Balochistan IGP if the remaining three missing persons were not produced before the court by April 9. Frontier Corps (FC) Inspector General Major General Ubaidullah Khan Khattak also appeared before the court and rejected charges against his force.

Talking to The Express Tribune via telephone, the IG maintained that few job opportunities and a high literacy rate among the resident youth was fueling dissatisfaction and was feeding the rise in sectarianism. “I don’t think there is any foreign hand involved in the sectarian riots. The key thing in my understanding is the high rate of literacy without employment opportunities, which allows the frustrated youth to be easily used by some elements,” he said. Talking about farsighted measures to stem sectarianism from the picturesque region, he suggested establishing industries to absorb the educated youth on a large scale. This would, according to him, keep them from involvement in sectarian activities. “G-B has among the highest literacy rates in the country, but few employment opportunities. Such a situation frustrates the youth,” he said. “If they have jobs and are busy with work, they will not have time to indulge such activities,” he suggested.

According to official sources, Mr Raisani made the remarks during a meeting with Finance Minister Dr Abdul Hafiz Sheikh and said these elements were destabilising the federation and fuelling hatred between federating units and the centre. He said that if Balochistan seceded from Pakistan it would not be because of a handful of extremists challenging the State. He said he would blame the attitude of policy-makers and bureaucrats in Islamabad for paving the way for the success of extremists. The Chief Minister said the Aghaz-i-Haqooq-i-Balochistan package was not being implemented in letter and spirit.

The national strategy, soon to be made public, has been prepared by the National Counter-IED Forum. It is headed by the interior secretary and includes chief secretaries of all provinces, the National Counter Terrorism Authority Director General (FG), DG Engineers Pak Army, DGs/ IGs of all Civil Armed Forces, IG police of all provinces and representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Inter-Services Intelligence.
