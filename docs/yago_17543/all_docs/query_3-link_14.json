        "text": "Syed Ross Masood (1889-1937), grandson of the Muslim modernist Syed Ahmad Khan and former principal of Osmania University, traveled in 1922 from India to Japan as Director of Public Instruction for Hyderabad to assess Japan's educational system. In Japan and Its Educational System, a report published in 1923, Masood concluded that education had been key to Japan's rapid modernization and recommended that Hyderabad follow the country's model of modernization and educational reform: transmit Western knowledge through widespread vernacular education, and focus on the imperial tradition, freedom from foreign control, and patriotic nationalism. Masood sought to use mass vernacular education to create in Hyderabad a nationalist subject, loyal to the ruling Muslim dynasty, who absorbed modern scientific knowledge with its Western epistemic foundations but who remained untainted by Western norms. This study contextualizes and historicizes Masood's attempt to create in Hyderabad a new nationalist subject, focusing on his 1923 report about Japan.\n\n2 Masood to E. M. Forster, letter 12, in E. M. Forster, Jalil Ahmed Kidwai, and Syed Ross Masood, Forster-Masood Letters, ed. Jalil Ahmad Kidwai (Karachi, Pakistan: Ross Masood Education and Culture Society of Pakistan, 1984), 113-14. The letter is incomplete and undated, but Masood closes with the remark, “Well, goodbye for the present, and expect my next letter from Hyderabad on the 21st Jan 1923.”\n\n4 Masood was born on February 15, 1889, and died on July 30, 1937. He accepted the job of Director of Public Instruction for Hyderabad in 1916 and held the position from 1918 to 1928. See Forster, Kidwai, and Masood, Forster-Masood Letters, 173 (birth); 29-30 and 153 (death); 124; 192n36 (Director of Public Instruction). See also Syed Ross Masood, Travels in Japan: Diary of an Exploring Mission, ed. Jalil A. Kidwai (1922; repr., Karachi: Ross Masood Education and Culture Society of Pakistan, 1968), vii.\n\n6 Methodologically, this study moves beyond the limitations of both the Western-centric diffusionist model of global educational history—wherein ideas and practices are diffused or transmitted from certain locations (often in the West) to other locations (often not located in the West)—as well as the aggregative approach that aims for a comparative framework by aggregating discrete histories. See Sabyasachi Bhattacharya, “Towards a Global History of Education: Alternative Strategies,” in Connecting Histories of Education: Transnational and Cross-Cultural Exchanges in (Post)Colonial Education, edited by Barnita Bagchi, Eckhardt Fuchs, and Kate Rousmaniere (New York: Berghahn Books, 2014), 27-40.\n\n28 Masood traveled in 1928 to England with his sons, Anwar (age thirteen) and Akbar (eleven), for them to commence their education in England. Masood then returned to India to begin his position as vice chancellor of Aligarh Muslim University, leaving his sons in England under the guardianship of E. M. Forster. Forster, Kidwai, and Masood, Forster-Masood Letters, 123-24, 152.\n\n29 The Ansei Treaties were treaties of friendship and commerce (the individual names of each treaty differ) signed by the Tokugawa bakufu, or shogunate, in the final decade of Tokugawa rule before the Meiji period. These were, in chronological order, the treaty with the United States on July 29, 1858 (Ansei 5/6/19); Holland on August 18, 1858 (Ansei 5/7/10); Russia on August 19, 1858 (Ansei 5/7/11); Britain on August 26, 1858 (Ansei 5/7/18); and France on October 9, 1858 (Ansei 5/9/3). The Ansei (November 1854 through March 1860) was the era name during the period of the emperor Kōmei-tennō. The Japan-US Treaty of Amity and Commerce formed the template for the rest, which were all nearly identical trade treaties. Michael R. Auslin, Negotiating with Imperialism: The Unequal Treaties and the Culture of Japanese Diplomacy (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2004).\n\n31 Iwakura was Iwakura Tomomi's surname. Japanese names are written according to Japanese convention, with the surname first, followed by the given name. For Japanese authors of secondary sources published in English, names are written according to European convention, with given name first, followed by the surname.\n\n75 Although Japan increasingly became militarized in the 1920s, rikkensei (constitutional system) was the term applied to the new Meiji political structures during the Meiji period itself, emphasizing the Meiji Constitution. Tennōsei, or an emperor system, was a term that would only be coined later, in the 1930s, and was later abolished by the US occupation and the post-WWII Japanese government because it had advanced Japanese militarism and imperial expansion. See Gluck, Carol, Japan's Modern Myths: Ideology in the late Meiji Period (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1985), 41, 281Google Scholar.\n\n76 Major Osman Senai graduated from the War College in 1895, and Captain Ali Fuad (Erden) graduated in 1904; both were regular contributors to the military press in the years after the 1908 Young Turk/Constitutional Revolution.

The commission to explore university reform in India was led by and named for Ethelbert Blatter, S.J. (1877-1934), the Swiss born Jesuit and botanist, who taught botany at St. Xavier's College in Bombay from 1903-1908, before returning to England and Europe and then ultimately back to Bombay in 1915. He remained in India until his death in 1934. “Obituary: Ethelbert Blatter, S.J.
