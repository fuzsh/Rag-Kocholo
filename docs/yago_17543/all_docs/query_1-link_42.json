        "text": "Idris is continuing his work from last year for the Yemen people. As you know, Yemen has been struggling for many years and is in desperate help. We need to stand beside these people as itâ€™s never ending. Idris is only 7 years old and understands the importance on how we can make a difference for these people. Can you help? He has dedicated his time and effort writing a short story (six pages) with animations to raise funds. It is called: The Door and the Multi-universe. He has created a blurb for his story as follows:\n\nIdris and his friends decide to go on an Adventure in the woods. What they did not realise was there was a door that goes into different Multi-universes. Can Idris and his friends find their way back home?\n\nIdris humbly requests for family and friends to please donate what ever you can. Every penny counts. Thank you for the overwhelming support from people for many years.\n\nPlease note: as soon as you donate, you will receive a link for the story. The link will be in the email receipt from JustGiving. Idris hopes you enjoy the story as much as he has written it.\n\n24 million people are in need of humanitarian aidWith families facing ongoing armed conflict, displacement, disease and economic decline, an estimated 24 million people are now in need of humanitarian aid to survive a figure so high that it is in fact the highest across the globe.Yemen now officially hosts the worlds largest human-induced food security crisis.Families and communities have been torn apart and left without even the most basic of living essentials:- 19.7 million people need basic healthcare- Almost 18 million people are in need of water and sanitation facilities- Over 3 million people have been left displaced by conflictOn the ground: A country on the edge of famineIslamic Relief is on the ground in 17 of the countrys 22 governorates, providing essential food aid to families at risk of famine and facing extensive food insecurity.With your support we can help these communities in their hour of need.Donate Now and help save lives."
