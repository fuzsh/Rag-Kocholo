Rutherford B. Hayes became president as the Reconstruction period ended.

Rutherford Birchard Hayes was born on October 4, 1822 in Delaware, Ohio. He was the son of Rutherford and Sophia Birchard Hayes.

The future president never knew his father, who died ten weeks before his birth. His widowed mother never remarried and raised him and his sister on her own.

In 1838, he graduated Kenyon College as its valedictorian. He then attended Harvard Law School and joined the Ohio bar in 1845.

He married Lucy Webb on December 30, 1852. The couple would have a daughter and seven sons together. Only four of their sons lived to adulthood.

In the late 1850s, he became the city solicitor for his area.

He joined the Ohio Volunteer Infantry as a major during the Civil War. Hayes was shot in the arm at the Battle of South Mountain and out of commission for a while. Upon return to duty he moved to the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia and the campaigns that took place there. His leadership drew the attention of his superiors, including Ulysses S. Grant. He was later promoted to brigadier general and later major

general.

While serving in the Union army in 1864, he was elected to the U.S. Congress. He resigned in July 1867 to campaign for governor and won the election.

Upon leaving office of governor, deciding not to run for re-election, he returned to private life and his law career and real estate management.

He came under consideration for the presidency in 1876. The election between him and Samuel J. Tilden was very contentious. He lost the official popular vote to Tilden, but won the vote of the electoral college. This happened only after the Congressional commission awarded him with twenty contested electoral votes.

He took the oath in March 1877, but many Democrats would always refer to him as “His Fraudulently”.

President Hayes tried to improve morality in the south, dealt with the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, dealt with corruption in the postal service, and the Coinage Act of 1873 while in office.

In 1880, he embarked on a 71-day tour of the American West and became the first sitting president to travel west of the Rocky Mountains.

He kept his pledge not to seek re-election and returned to private life in 1881. He became an advocate for educational charities in his retirement.

In 1889 he was “greatly saddened” by his wife’s death. He died from a heart attack on January 17, 1893. His last words were “I know that I’m going where Lucy is.”

After his home was donated to the state of Ohio, he was re-interred there in 1915.
