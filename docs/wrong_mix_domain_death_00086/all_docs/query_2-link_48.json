        "text": "\"President Hayes\" and \"Rutherford Hayes\" redirect here. For his son, see Rutherford P. Hayes. For the Department in Paraguay, see Presidente Hayes Department. For the attack transport, see USS President Hayes.\n\nRutherford Birchard Hayes ( ; October 4, 1822 â€“ January 17, 1893) was an American military officer and politician who served as the 19th president of the United States from 1877 to 1881.\n\nQuick Facts 19th President of the United States, Vice President ...\n\nClose\n\nAs an attorney in Ohio, Hayes served as Cincinnati's city solicitor from 1858 to 1861. He was a staunch abolitionist who defended refugee slaves in court proceedings.[1] At the start of the American Civil War, he left a fledgling political career to join the Union Army as an officer. Hayes was wounded five times, most seriously at the Battle of South Mountain in 1862. He earned a reputation for bravery in combat, rising in the ranks to serve as brevet major general. After the war, he earned a reputation in the Republican Party as a prominent member of the \"Half-Breed\" faction.[2] He served in Congress from 1865 to 1867 and was elected governor of Ohio, serving two consecutive terms from 1868 to 1872 and half of a third two-year term from 1876 to 1877 before his swearing-in as president.\n\nHayes won the Republican nomination for president in the 1876 United States presidential election. In the disputed general election, he faced Democratic nominee Samuel J. Tilden. Hayes lost the popular vote to Tilden; neither candidate secured enough electoral votes to win the election. Hayes secured a victory when a Congressional Commission awarded him 20 contested electoral votes in the Compromise of 1877. The electoral dispute was resolved with a backroom deal whereby both Southern Democrats and Whiggish Republican businessmen acquiesced to Hayes's election on the condition that he end both federal support for Reconstruction and the military occupation of the former Confederate States.[5][6]"
