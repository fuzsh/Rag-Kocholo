        "text": "Rishi Sunak has accused Nigel Farage of “playing into Putin’s hands” by saying that the West “provoked” Russia into invading Ukraine.\n\nFollow The Telegraph’s general election liveblog\n\nThe Reform UK leader received a barrage of criticism from across the political spectrum on Saturday after he claimed that the “ever-eastward expansion of Nato and the European Union” gave Vladimir Putin a justification to attack.\n\nThe Prime Minister said the comments were “completely wrong”, while Sir Keir Starmer labelled them “disgusting”.\n\nBen Wallace, the former defence secretary, branded Mr Farage a “pub bore” with “simplistic answers” to “complex problems”.\n\nHowever, writing for The Telegraph, Mr Farage refused to back down, claiming that his warnings about Western foreign policy had been “proved right”.\n\nThe row erupted after Mr Farage was asked in a BBC Panorama interview with Nick Robinson on Friday why he had “blamed the West” for Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nHe replied: “It was obvious to me that the ever-eastward expansion of Nato and the European Union was giving this man a reason to his Russian people to say, ‘they’re coming for us again’ and to go to war.”\n\nPressed on whether his rhetoric was echoing that of the Russian president, he said: “But, hang on a second, we provoked this war. It’s – you know, of course, it’s his fault, he’s used what we’ve done as an excuse.”\n\nOn Saturday, Mr Sunak said: “What he said was completely wrong and only plays into Putin’s hands.\n\n“This is a man who deployed nerve agents on the streets of Britain, who’s doing deals with countries like North Korea. And this kind of appeasement is dangerous for Britain’s security, the security of our allies that rely on us and only emboldens Putin further.”\n\nSir Keir said: “Nigel Farage’s comments were disgusting. Russia is the aggressor and Putin bears the responsibility.”\n\nSpeaking on the BBC’s Today programme, Mr Wallace claimed that the Reform leader was “a bit like that pub bore we have all met at the end of the bar who often says if ‘I was running the country’ and presents very simplistic answers to … complex problems”.\n\nHe added that the comments reflected a “rather odd admiration of totalitarian leaders that we hear from parts of the Trump campaign and some of the Farage lot – ‘oh well he’s a good old strong leader’”.\n\nMr Wallace said: “Well he might be a good old strong leader but he’s done that at the expense of sacrificing half a million Russians dead, injured or deserted and on track to be lost by the end of this year. I don’t want that anywhere in our politics.”\n\nBut in his article for The Telegraph, Mr Farage claimed he had been the victim of a “slur”.\n\n“I am not and never have been an apologist or supporter of Putin,” he said. “His invasion of Ukraine was immoral, outrageous and indefensible. As a champion of national sovereignty, I believe that Putin was entirely wrong to invade the sovereign nation of Ukraine. Nobody can fairly accuse me of being an appeaser. I have never sought to justify Putin’s invasion in any way and I’m not now.\n\n“But that doesn’t change the fact that I saw it coming a decade ago, warned that it was coming and am one of the few political figures who has been consistently right and honest about Russia’s Ukraine war.\n\n“What I have been saying for the past 10 years is that the West has played into Putin’s hands, giving him the excuse to do what he wanted to do anyway.”\n\nHe added: “If you poke the Russian bear with a stick, don’t be surprised if he responds.”\n\nMr Farage claimed that he was questioning “political conformism” on Ukraine. “The escalation of British support for the war in Ukraine has not even been an issue in this election campaign, since the old parties all agree with it,” he said.\n\nOn Saturday, he was gained support from George Galloway, the veteran hard-Left politician and outspoken Nato critic, who posted on X: “The absolute hysteria over Nigel Farage telling the truth about the Ukraine war is the shape of things to come.\n\n“The establishment narrative over this and a hundred other things is a Potemkin Village – paper thin!”"
