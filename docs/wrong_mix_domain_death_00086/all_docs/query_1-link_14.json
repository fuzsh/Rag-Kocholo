        "text": "Sunny lived in St. George, Utah since November 2019. She was 81 years old and passed away on Wednesday, November 16th, 2022, at 4:45pm at Intermountain St. George Regional Hospital. She was born on September 26, in Miami, Florida to parents Morris Hayes and Darline C. Campbell. Morris was born in Cordele, Georgia and Darline was born in Dillon, Montana. They met & married in Miami, Florida. They had two children-Sunny & Cathy.\n\nSunny was raised and spent most of her life in Miami. She graduated from Hialeah High School at the age of 17. Dad loved to hunt & fish & Sunny as a teenager would go with dad & his brothers. Dad and his brothers had a camp in the Florida Everglades. Sunny had a rifle but never would shoot any animal or bird. She couldn't stand the thought of killing something so beautiful.\n\nSunny was a life long member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, She loved the Gospel of Jesus Christ. It meant the world to her. Her great-grandfather was the branch president of the Edinburgh, Scotland Branch for 20 years before he & his family moved to Salt Lake City, Utah. She always knew she wanted to go to Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, for her higher education. Sunny enjoyed her freshman year of college. However, upon her return to Miami after her freshman year, she developed polio. She wasn't well enough to go back to college in the fall. It would take 2-3 years. As she got better she prepared to return to B.Y.U. and resume her education. She did indeed eventually go back to Provo & B.Y.U. Once her younger sister, Cathy, had graduated from high school (1966), she followed her sister back to B.Y.U. They enjoyed their college days together. They even lived together all through college. They had always lived together and enjoyed each others company. Both sisters graduated in education and looked forward to teaching in Miami. Sunny worked for the Dade County School Board for a year or two. Cathy got a \"temporary\" job with the State of Florida. It lasted 35 years. She pretty quickly dragged Sunny to also work for the same employer. It also was a \"temporary\" job. Sunny's temporary job lasted 30 years until she and Cathy decided to retired in 2004.\n\nIn 1992, Sunny, Cathy, Mom & Dad decided to moved from Miami to Pembroke Pines, Florida. It was in Broward county and not that far from where they lived in Miami. It was really nice there. It was west of Ft. Lauderdale and VERY close to the Florida Everglades. Sunny & Cathy decided to retire September 2004. As a family they decided to move to Americus, Georgia (SW GA.). Americus, is a small town of 30,000 people. Dad had family there and they moved there because dad was ill and he had a nephew he was very close to who lived there. In Americus, in 2009, her dad and mom passed just a couple of months apart. They are buried there. So Sunny & Cathy made the decision to move to St. George, Utah, where they have several cousins & friends with whom they grew up with in Miami. They have been very happy here.\n\nSunny is survived by her sister Cathy and a multitude of cousins and friends all over the U.S.A.\n\nFamily and friends meant everything to Sunny. Sunny was a kind, compassionate, and a generous person. Some comments from her friends and family are as follows:\n\nSunny had a great spirit\n\nShe was very strong She was a good person.\n\nI always love to hear her pray\n\nShe was very much loved in our Americus, GA. Branch\n\nShe was always a very kind and gracious lady\n\nShe was always a beacon in our lives\n\nShe was loved so much and she loved us too. She always showed it.\n\nArrangements are made under the direction of Hughes Mortuary, 1037 East 700 South, St. George, Utah (435) 674-5000. There will only be a graveside service on Monday November 28th at 1pm at Tonaquint Cemetery. In lieu of flowers please make a donation to your favorite charity."
