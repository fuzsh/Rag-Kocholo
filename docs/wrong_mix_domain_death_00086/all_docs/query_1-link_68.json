        "text": "The former president was rushed off the stage in Butler after gunshots rang through the crowd.\n\nOne person in the crowd was killed and two people were critically injured after an attacker fired “multiple shots”, said the Secret Service. The suspected gunman was killed according to Butler County District Attorney Richard Goldinger.\n\nThe Secret Service said the suspected gunman fired from “an elevated position outside of the rally venue” and that the FBI has taken over the investigation.\n\nWriting on his Truth Social platform, Mr Trump said he was “shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear”.\n\n“I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin,” he said. “Much bleeding took place, so I realised then what was happening.”\n\nMr Trump thanked the Secret Service and other law endorsement for their “rapid response” and he extended condolences “to the family of the person at the rally who was killed and also to the family of another person that was badly injured”.\n\n“It is incredible that such an act can take place in our Country. Nothing is known at this time about the shooter, who is now dead,” he said.\n\nSpokesman Steven Cheung said Mr Trump is “fine” and being checked out at a local medical facility while the former president’s eldest son Donald Trump Jr said his father “is in great spirits”.\n\nMr Trump flew back to New Jersey ahead of his spending the night at his golf resort in Bedminster.\n\nThe FBI named Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, as the gunman.\n\nKevin Rojek, the FBI officer in charge, said they had not identified a motive for what he a called “an assassination attempt on our former president”.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said “everybody must condemn” the incident, adding that he hoped to speak with his 2024 presidential rival soon.\n\nAddressing the nation about two hours after the shooting, Mr Biden said he was relieved the former president is reportedly “doing well” and the White House confirmed the presidential rivals have spoken.\n\n“We cannot allow this to be happening,” he said. “The idea that there’s violence in America like this is just unheard of.”\n\nMr Biden said he was waiting for additional information before formally calling the attack an attempted assassination on the former president.\n\nThe president delivered his comments from the White House’s emergency briefing room in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, which is set up whenever the president travels. He was spending the weekend at his beach home and was at a nearby church when the shooting occurred.\n\nMr Biden received an “initial briefing” from aides after he left church minutes after the shooting and then convened security officials for a more in-depth update.\n\nThe Biden campaign said it was pausing all messaging to supporters and working to pull down all of its television ads as quickly as possible, the campaign said.\n\nMr Trump’s campaign and the Republican National Committee said the party’s convention in Milwaukee, which is due to start on Monday, will “proceed” after the shooting.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris said in a statement that she was also briefed, adding that she and her husband “are relieved” that Mr Trump was not seriously injured.\n\n“Violence such as this has no place in our nation,” she said. “We must all condemn this abhorrent act and do our part to ensure that it does not lead to more violence.”\n\nMr Trump was showing off a chart of border crossing numbers when bangs started ringing out.\n\nThe ex-president could be seen reaching with his right hand towards his neck and there appeared to be blood on his face.\n\nHe quickly ducked as agents from his protective detail rushed the stage and screams rang out from the crowd. The bangs continued as agents tended to him.\n\nThe crowd cheered as he got back up and pumped his fist before he was taken to his motorcade which left the venue.\n\nPolice began vacating the site in Butler shortly after Mr Trump left the stage.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama said in a statement: “There is absolutely no place for political violence in our democracy. We should all be relieved that former President Trump wasn’t seriously hurt and use this moment to recommit ourselves to civility and respect in our politics.”\n\nHis predecessor George W Bush described the shooting as a “cowardly attack” on Mr Trump’s life.\n\nPennsylvania Republican Senate candidate Dave McCormick, who was sitting in the front row, said: “All the sudden shots started to crack, someone behind me appears to have been shot.\n\n“There’s lots of blood, and then the Secret Service were all over President Trump.”"
