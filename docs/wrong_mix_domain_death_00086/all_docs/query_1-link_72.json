        "text": "You can follow our exit poll and results live blog here\n\nRishi Sunak has named Craig Mackinlay and Theresa May in the dissolution honours list, published less than an hour before the polls closed.\n\nA list of seven new Conservative peers, including the first “bionic MP” and the former prime minister, appeared on the Government website after 9pm on July 4.\n\nThe dissolution honours list allows parties to nominate MPs who are standing down and leaving the House of Commons at the end of a parliament to enter the House of Lords.\n\nEight new Labour peerages were also awarded, as well as one for the Liberal Democrats and one for the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).\n\nDr Hilary Cass, who authored the Cass review into NHS gender services for children and young people, was also made a crossbench peer.\n\nOliver Dowden, the deputy prime minister and Julian Smith, the former chief whip, Ben Wallace, the former defence secretary, and Alister Jack, the Scotland Secretary, have been nominated for knighthoods. Thérèse Coffey, the former deputy prime minister, has been made a dame.\n\nThe Prime Minister also included Sir Graham Brady, the former chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs and Liam Booth-Smith, who had been Mr Sunak’s chief of staff in Downing Street, in his list.\n\nDame Eleanor Laing, the former deputy speaker, and Sir Alok Sharma, the ex-Cop26 president and Cabinet minister, have also been made peers.\n\nAmong Sir Keir Starmer’s nominations for peerages are Dame Margaret Beckett, Harriet Harman, Margaret Hodge and Kevan Jones.\n\nMr Jones played a prominent role in campaigning for justice for sub-postmasters caught up in the Post Office Horizon scandal.\n\nMrs May, who was the first prime minister in more than 60 years to choose not to publish a dissolution honours list in 2017, has now been given a seat in the House of Lords.\n\nMr Mackinlay made an emotional return to the Comons in May following months in hospital, and used his first speech to raise awareness of sepsis and to ask for better provision of prosthetics for amputees.\n\nHe announced he would not stand again at the general election days afterwards, explaining it would be “impossible” to seek re-election while continuing his rehabilitation.\n\nMr Mackinlay said he was “overwhelmed” by the honour and would use his platform to campaign for sepsis, limb loss and appropriate prosthetics, as well as “sensible” net zero. Writing on X he said: “The Bionic MP changes into the Bionic Lord.”\n\nDr Cass’s report into the support and treatment offered to children who believe they are transgender was welcomed widely, with Mr Sunak saying that the Government had already acted swiftly on her previous call to stop routine use of puberty blockers for under-16s.\n\nHe said: “We will continue to ensure we take the right steps to protect young people. The wellbeing and health of children must come first.”\n\nThe Liberal Democrats nominated Caroline Pidgeon, former leader on the London Assembly, who said it was a “huge honour” and that she looked forward to working to “champion liberal values, mend our broken political system and hold the government to account”."
