        "text": "One of Edinburgh’s most popular destinations today, Princes Street has been a major thoroughfare in the city since its creation in the early 18th century. Princes Street specifically traverses the Edinburgh’s historic neighborhood called, “New Town,” which UNESCO decreed a World Heritage Site in 1995. New Town itself dates to 1767, when the Edinburgh City Council approved plans to create a unique suburban district that would attract more affluent individuals to the area. To make their vision a reality, the council members commissioned architect James Craig for the project. Craig’s plan was audacious: a grid five-streets deep seven-street wide that featured grand square at each end of its central axis. Every street was named after a member of the British Royal Family in honor of the recent Act of Union that had finally unified Scotland and England in 1707. George Street would specifically operate as the area’s main traffic artery, which Craig had named in honor of King George I of Great Britain. Two gorgeous churches were to serve as the anchors for the scheme, with St. George Church situated at the western end and St. Andrew’s located to the east. Craig intended for his new neighborhood it only feature residential structures, as the Edinburgh City Council intended for the nearby “Old Town” to exclusively act as the local center of commerce.\n\nThe development of New Town, though took nearly five decades to complete, formally concluding with Robert Adam’s construction of Charlotte Square in 1820. Soon enough, many brilliant Georgian-styled townhouses and manor homes filled the district. Perhaps the greatest of those buildings was the Dundas House, which functioned as the home of Sir Lawrence Dundas. Designed with some of the most beautiful Palladian-inspired design aesthetics throughout the entire city, the Dundas House today serves as the headquarters for the Royal Bank of Scotland. Another brilliant landmark to appear within the neighborhood around this time was the magnificent West Register House, located in Charlotte Square. Now the National Archives of Scotland, this charming structure originally debuted as the West Register House in 1792. The New Town retained its unique residential character for some time until the railroads arrived at the height of the Victorian Era. While George Street had functioned as the focal point of the neighborhood since its inception, the installment of a train station along Princes Street in the 1890s quickly changed the dynamic. Many businesses soon opened in New Town as such, transforming Princes Street into one of the city’s foremost shopping districts—a reputation that the area still bears today.\n\nIn 1899, the Caledonian Railway Company hired architects John More Dick Peddie and George Washington Browne to design the hotel as part of a much larger train station complex. The two men had managed to secure the contract thanks, in large part, to Peddie’s father, John Dick Peddie. The senior Peddie was a renowned architect in his own right, having developed several financial buildings on behalf of the Royal Bank of Scotland. After completing his studies at the University of Edinburgh, John More Dick Peddie worked in the office of George Gilbert Scott before formally joining his father’s firm in the 1870s. Becoming a partner in 1878, the junior Peddie eventually brought on George Washington Browne as an associate. Together, the two men helped make their practice incredibly successful that by the 1890s, it had become one of the most prolific architectural firms in all of Scotland. The primary focus of their work remained centered on the creation of financial institutions, including the design of several branches within the British Linen Bank. Yet, the true genius behind the firm’s success was Peddie’s assistant at the time, John Wilson. Wilson specifically drew the initial blueprints for most of the company’s projects during the apex of its prosperity, designing such renowned buildings like the magnificent Edinburgh College of Art. His influence was even felt on the overall design of The Caledonian, as he was Peddie and Browne’s main project manager throughout its construction.\n\nThe Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh – The Caledonian displays some amazing Renaissance Revival-style architecture, specifically a subset that embraced the design principles of the Flemish Renaissance. Renaissance Revival architecture—sometimes referred to as \"Neo-Renaissance”—is a group of architecture revival styles that date back to the 19th century. Neither Grecian nor Gothic in their appearance, Renaissance Revival-style architecture drew inspiration from a wide range of structural motifs found throughout Early Modern Western Europe. Architects in France and Italy were the first to embrace the artistic movement, who saw the architectural forms of the European Renaissance as an opportunity to reinvigorate a sense of civic pride throughout their communities. As such, those intellectuals incorporated the colonnades and low-pitched roofs of Renaissance-era buildings, with the characteristics of Mannerist and Baroque-themed architecture. Perhaps the greatest structural component to a Renaissance Revival-style building involved the installation of a grand staircase in a vein similar to those located at the Château de Blois and the Château de Chambord. This particular feature served as a central focal point for the design, often directing guests to a magnificent lobby or exterior courtyard. Yet, the nebulous nature of Renaissance Revival architecture meant that its appearance varied widely across Europe. As such, historians today often find it difficult to provide a specific definition for the architectural movement.\n\nEdinburgh Agreement (1992): Also known as the “Edinburgh Decision,” the Edinburgh Agreement was a political deal struck between Denmark and the presiding European Council in relation to the former’s rejection of the Maastricht Treaty. The Maastricht Treaty itself formally established the European Union in February 1992, in which the member nations of the preexisting European Communities decided to form a more centralized political union to better coordinate their respective social and economic affairs. At the time, 11 different countries in Europe constituted the European Communities and nearly all of them approved of the Maastricht Treaty. The only exception was Denmark, where a popular referendum held in June narrowly rejected the pact. Since the Maastricht Treaty could not become law until every nation within the European Communities singed the document, the other 10 nations scrambled to find a way to get Denmark’s approval. As such, the European Council—a body of dignitaries representing the political will of the pending European Union—met at The Caledonian to discuss the affair further that December. In the end, the European Union granted several concessions to Demark, which ultimately led to the country’s eventual approval in 1993. Those concessions essentially involved granting Denmark more autonomy in setting its domestic and foreign policies, as well as the preservation of the Danish krone. Today, the European Union is composed of 27 nations and is one of the most powerful geopolitical entities in the modern world.\n\nCharlie Chaplin, renowned actor known for his silent roles in The Kid and A Woman of Paris.\n\nJudy Garland, actress and singer known for her roles in A Star is Born (1954), Meet Me in St. Louis, and Wizard of Oz.\n\nGene Kelly, actor known for his roles in such movies like An American in Paris and Singin’ in the Rain.\n\nMarlene Dietrich, actress known for her roles in Morocco, Shanghai Express, and The Blue Angel.\n\nBette Davis, actress known for her roles in All About Eve, Jezebel, and What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?\n\nSean Connery, actor known for his roles in Goldfinger, The Untouchables, and The Hunt for Red October.\n\nRichard Burton, child actress known for her role in Bright Eyes and The Little Princess.\n\nElizabeth Taylor, actress known for her roles in Cleopatra and The Taming of the Shrew.\n\nAnthony Quinn, actor known for his roles in such films like Zorba the Greek, The Guns of Navarone, and La Strada.\n\nRoy Rogers, actor best remembered for his role on The Roy Rogers Show.\n\nFred MacMurray, actor known for such roles in Double Indemnity, The Absent-Minded Professor, and The Apartment.\n\nDavid Niven, actor best remembered for his roles in such films like Separate Tables, The Pink Panther, and Around the World in 80 Days.\n\nStan Laurel, one half of the legendary comic duo, Laurel and Hardy.\n\nOliver Hardy, one half of the legendary comic duo, Laurel and Hardy.\n\nCharles Aznavour, singer who sold well over 180 million records in his lifetime.\n\nBing Crosby, singer and actor known for his roles in Going My Way and The Bells of St. Mary’s.\n\nCount Basie, big band leader known for leading the Count Basie Orchestra to national prominence from Chicago.\n\nPerry Como, singer remembered as “Mr. C” who won five Emmy Awards.\n\nYehudi Menuhin, considered by experts to be one of the best violinists of the 20th century.\n\nRudolf Nureyev, ballet dancer who once directed the Paris Opera Ballet.\n\nJean Chrétien, Prime Minister of Canada (1993 – 2003)\n\nJohn Major, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (1990 – 1997)\n\nTony Blair, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (1997 – 2007)\n\nMikhail Gorbachev, General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (1985 – 1991)\n\nNelson Mandela, anti-apartheid revolutionary and 1st President of South Africa (1994 – 1999)\n\nLee Kuan Yew, Prime Minster of Singapore (1969 – 1990)\n\nGoh Chok Tong, Prime Minister of Singapore (1990 – 2004)\n\nP.J.

Among the places where the new rail line traversed was Princes Street in the heart of Scotland’s New Town. Many businesses began to open in the area, as such, which transformed Princes Street into one of the city’s most vibrant shopping districts.\n\n1899: Due to the rise in traffic along the West End branch of the Caledonian Railway, the company decided to create an exclusive, high-end train station at Princes Street. Its main attraction would involve a magnificent boutique hotel that would cater to the station’s many passengers. The Caledonian Railway Company then hired the architectural firm of John More Dick Peddie and Sir George Washington Browne to spearhead the project.\n\n1903: After nearly four years of constant construction, the Caledonian Railway Company proudly debuted its brilliant new hotel. Christened as “The Caledonian Hotel,” the building featured an extensive selection of 205 unique guestrooms. Guests also encountered gold-painted ceilings, marble columns, and a grand staircase upon entering the building.\n\n1923: Due to The Caledonian Hotel’s rising popularity among travelers passing through the Princes Street Station, the Caledonian Railway Company opened several new facilities inside the building. The greatest of those new ventures was an immaculate restaurant called, “The Pompadour.” The restaurant quickly transformed The Caledonian Hotel into one of Edinburgh’s most premier fine dining establishments.\n\n1965: Passenger travel along the West End line of the Caledonian Railway had decline significantly by the start of the decade, leading to the closure of the Princes Street Station in 1965. The building was then mostly demolished five years later, with only The Caledonian Hotel getting spared. The hotel’s owners subsequently expanded into the remaining portions of the train station, increasing the size of The Caledonian Hotel greatly.\n\n1992: Denmark and the European Council met at The Caledonian Hotel to discuss the former’s rejection of the Maastricht Treaty. Their discussions—known as the “Edinburgh Agreement”—granted Denmark several concessions that ultimately led to its eventual recognition of the law. The Maastricht Treaty then formally created the European Union.\n\n1995: The Scottish Government designated The Caledonian Hotel a Category A Listed Building. According to Historic Environment Scotland: “listed buildings of national or international importance, either architectural or historic, or fine little-altered examples of some particular period, style or building type.”\n\n2000: Queens Moat Houses—which had come to own The Caledonian Hotel several years prior—sold its interests in the business to Hilton Hotels. The sale proved massive, as the final price tag reached the sum of more than £44 million. Hilton then renamed the building as the “Caledonian Hilton Edinburgh.”\n\n2008: Hilton sold the Caledonian Hilton Edinburgh to a group of Israeli investors with the backing of the Lloyds Banking Group. The new owners decided to allow Hilton to continue operating the hotel, though.\n\n2014: The hotel completed a three-year-long restoration that cost around £24 million. The renovations restored the hotel’s many facilities and accommodations. The Pompadour received a much-needed facelift, too, and the original station concourse was transformed into a wonderful bar called “Peacock Alley.” Hilton then moved the hotel into its prestigious Waldorf Astoria brand, renaming it as the “Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh – The Caledonian” in the process.\n\n2018: Twenty14 Holdings purchased the Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh – The Caledonian, although kept the hotel within Hilton’s Waldorf Astoria collection. The sale came at the massive sum of £85 million. Twenty14 Holdings itself was the investment arm of the Abu Dhabi-based Lulu Group. The Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh – The Caledonian also joined Historic Hotels Worldwide around the same time, as well."
