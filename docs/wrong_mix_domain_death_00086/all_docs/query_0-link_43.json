        "text": "- All right there. Hello everybody. This is Nick Sacco with Ulysses S. Grant National Historic Site in St. Louis, Missouri and today is pretty exciting. This is gonna be the first of a series of chats with historians over the next few weeks. We're calling it the U.S. Grant History Chat. And our first guest today is historian David Silkenat. He is a Professor of History at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland and Dr. Silkenat wrote a book recently entitled \"Raising the White Flag: How Surrender Defined the American Civil War.\" So with Ulysses S. Grant being involved in a number of surrenders during the American Civil War, it only seemed appropriate to have Dr. Silkenat join us today for this interview. So thank you for being with us here today and just to kind of kick things off, it's rather interesting that you're teaching the American Civil War in Scotland. So I think our viewers would love to kind of hear about what that's like teaching in Scotland and what kind of sparked your interest in the Civil War in the first place?\n\n- Well, thank you very much, Nick. It's really great pleasure to be here. So as you can probably tell from my accent, even though I teach in Scotland and I've been teaching here for seven years now, I'm not Scottish. I'm from New York City originally.\n\n- Okay.\n\n- And teaching here has really been amazing. There's actually a huge amount of interest in the American Civil War in the UK generally and in Scotland. We have a huge number of students who were interested in studying it, both the undergraduate and graduate level. We actually have some Civil War sites connected to Edinburgh. We've got the Scottish American Civil War Memorial here not far from me which is an enormous statue of Abraham Lincoln. So you can come to Scotland and see that. We also have a somewhat smaller Confederate monument too. So we've got all kinds, Frederick Douglas lived just around the corner from me for a couple of years. So we've got actually some Civil War connections you know, even thousands of miles away from the U.S. So you asked about sort of how I got interested in the Civil War. I think it sort of happened by accident like it is for most people, but there's sort of two moments that really in my life that drove me to the Civil War. One, I went on a class trip when I was in eighth grade and I was from New York City, went down to the Shenandoah Valley, I think we ended up going to Antietam. And this was about the same time that the Ken Burns documentary had come out and Glory had come out. And so that was just a really sort of pivotal time in my life sort of thinking about it in retrospect. And I guess the other moment is I went to Duke University as an undergrad. Not far from where we lived is Bennett Place, which is one of the, thinking about the book I'm talking about today, Bennett Place is the site of one of the big surrenders at the end of the Civil War and I became fascinated by that site and what it meant then and what it has meant over the past 150 years.\n\n- Fantastic, yeah, that's a, I think very common story with a lot of us. And I remember it took me a little longer to get into the Civil War, but when I was a kid, I mean Glory was just one of those movies that really stuck out and really sparked my interest in history more generally. So kind of a similar story there as well. Absolutely. So in reading \"Raising the White Flag\", I thought your introduction really did a nice job of summarizing some of your larger arguments in the book. And, you know, in the introduction that one out of every four soldiers in the Civil War surrendered at some point during the war. It's just an astounding number of soldiers who were part of a surrender in some way. And so that sort of sparks this question about what made the nature of surrender during the Civil War so unique with such a high number of soldiers participating in surrender?\n\n- Well, and not only so many soldiers surrendering but they're surrendering so often, right? So this is a war that starts off the way we usually conventionally describe it. It starts off with a surrendered Fort Sumter. It ends with a series of surrenders, the Appomattox Court House and Bennett place, and a few other places. And in between there's lots of sort of the pivotal moments of the war are defined by surrender, whether it's, you know, in Grant's case in Fort Donelson and in Vicksburg, but in dozens of other, they're surrendering a lot. And so one of the things I've tried to sort of figure out in the book was why was it that surrender was so common? Why is it that, you know, that there seems to be more surrenders in the American Civil War really than any other war in human history that at least that I've been able to find. If somebody has a counterexample, please let me know. I've been trying to find one. And there's a couple of reasons why surrender is so common in the Civil War. One is I think from the very beginning there's a common understanding by both Union and Confederate officers and soldiers about when's the right time to surrender. What happens when a surrender happens. The language of surrender becomes very familiar to soldiers on both sides. And they understand when you're supposed to surrender, when you're not. And there was a conception that one could surrender honorably. That really runs throughout the entire war. So if you think about Major Anderson, Major Robert Anderson when he surrenders at Fort Sumter, he is greeted when he and his men go to New York City, immediately thereafter and he is greeted as a hero. They are treated as heroes. They have an enormous parade and rally for them in the city. If we think about the end of the war when Lee surrenders, his standing among the soldiers only increases. And there's a couple of cases when people surrender prematurely. But the standard basically was that if you were fired upon, if you realize that continuing to fight would only lead to the unnecessary loss of life, then it was appropriate that you surrender in those cases. And I think this sort of shared understanding of what surrender would look like and a common understanding that if you surrendered, you'd be well treated by your enemy. Now there's some exceptions to this, but in most cases, people who surrendered are well treated in the Civil War. So if you think about what happened to Lee's men when he surrenders, we think about Johnson's. I mean, all the other people who will surrender at the end of the war. They're all allowed to go home. We think about in Fort Sumter, they're all allowed to leave. You know, there's obviously some exceptions to this but for the most part, people surrender because they think that surrendering is a much better alternative than fighting in a battle they're going to die in especially die unnecessarily. And the fourth sort of thing that makes the surrender, I think interesting in the Civil War is the ways in which I think like everything else in the Civil War, it's shaped by race, right? The race really is a fundamental framework for how people understood surrender. And from what I've been talking about thus far, it usually applies for white soldiers. For African-American soldiers though, a very different rubric applies. As soon as the Union army introduces black soldiers, the Confederacy says, we do not consider them legitimate soldiers, and if we capture them, we're not going to treat them the same as we would treat white soldiers. We're going to return them to a state of slavery is the sort of official Confederate policy. In practice, the Confederate policies if they capture black soldiers, they're going to be executed. Which means that for certain categories of soldiers and similar kinds of things apply to southern unionists and gorillas who were also sort of seen as being illegitimate soldiers by the enemy. African-American soldiers recognize they cannot surrender on the battlefield and consequentially say, if we can't surrender, we're not gonna let Confederates surrender to us, right? We're gonna play by the same rules. And so it's really one of those interesting places to look at how race informs the ways in which soldiers are going to fight in different ways.\n\n- Very interesting. Absolutely. So there's a lot of this that's kind of bound up in the notion of honor and fighting honorably but then knowing when to stop, but then we can kind of see through the racial dimension that there are limits to that notion of honor as well it sounds like.\n\n- Oh, to be sure. I mean, I think the Civil War soldiers really thought of themselves as fighting in a civilized war. We had to have a conception of what war was supposed to look like. A set of rules of war was supposed to be fought according to and obviously the Civil War was enormously bloody and brutal in all kinds of ways. But it could have been a lot more bloody and more brutal than it was. You know, if we think about, you know, the Civil War is the bloodiest war in American history with three quarters of a million Americans dying, one could imagine alternative war in which surrender is taken off the table and these one quarter of soldiers who surrender, you know have to fight to the death. The war looks even bloodier, you know, imagine what Fort Donelson would have looked like if they hadn't surrendered or Vicksburg would have looked like if they hadn't surrendered or Appomattox Court House would have looked, you know, these all would have been well over a million deaths. I mean, it's hard to sort of estimate what that would have looked like but it would have been a very different war than what we had.\n\n- Absolutely. And you could definitely see with Appomattox, you know, if Lee refused to surrender at Appomattox, who knows how much longer the war would have, that particular war with the army in Northern Virginia would have lasted.\n\n- Well, I mean I think Lee's army was in extraordinarily bad shape, right? And so what that battle would have looked like, it would not have looked good for Lee's army. They would not have been able to walk away from that. And the fact that they were all able to receive their paroles, go home, return to civilian life, I think is really sort of astonishing. I think we, people don't take enough time to think about what that means and what the consequences of that were for not only those men but for what the post-war world looked like.\n\n- Absolutely, absolutely. And then finally, with our last question here kind of going back to Grant specifically, I'm very interested in the case of Fort Donelson 'cause with Grant, he gains really international fame with the notion of unconditional surrender but with Confederate General Simon Bolivar Buckner, at least in his perspective, he's expecting to be able to negotiate terms with Grant, and he's sort of taken aback when Grant demands unconditional surrender. So maybe if you can kind of speak to maybe that moment and then the way that Grant and unconditional surrender maybe shape future surrenders later on in the war.\n\n- Sure. So one of the things to think about with Fort Donelson, there's a bunch of things that factor into this. One is there are actually a lot of Confederates who are surrendering at about the same time. So actually just like a week earlier, there've been a major surrender on Roanoke Island in North Carolina, part of the Burnside invasion. And there's, I think a couple of things that are going on in Grant's mind. He never explains this. You know, if you look at his memoirs, he doesn't say why he demands unconditional surrender. And obviously he gets this nickname, unconditional surrender Grant, which fits with his initials but I'm not sure he actually deserves it because the other two major surrenders he's involved with are not unconditional. He negotiates terms. And that was the default, right? And all, most nearly all Civil War surrenders, the premise is the two commanding officers are sitting down to negotiate a way not to fight. And usually, one of them is in a vastly superior position to the other and that's why they're having that negotiation. But they at least, they walk through the motions of doing it as equals and unconditional surrender is seen as sort of in a front to that kind of mode of doing things. So why does Grant do this? Well I think the reason why Grant demanded unconditional surrender at Fort Donelson is because of the sort of the situation of the Fort on the river. Lots of Confederates are fleeing during the moment in which, you know, Buckner offers to surrender and then Grant writes back that he demands unconditional surrender. There are Confederates who are fleeing. Buckner was actually the third highest ranking officer when the siege begins, right? So he's got John B. Floyd who ranks higher than him. Gideon Pillow ranks higher than him. Buckner is the most military experienced of the three, but both of those men outranked him and both of them fled the fort before the surrender happens along with several thousand Confederate soldiers. I think part of what Grant was worried about was that if he went through the process of negotiation, there would be nobody left in the fort to surrender when the fort actually surrendered. If we think about, you know, Fort Henry which had surrendered just a week earlier, there's basically nobody in that fort when the fort surrenders, right? And so I think what Grant wants to do was to actually have a garrison there that's surrenders rather than having an empty fort which would be somewhat useless. So that's my thinking through why he demands unconditional surrender then. But I think it's, you know, thinking about the nickname, you know, Grant saw surrender as a way to avoid fighting when fighting didn't need to happen. And I think one of the things that people don't fully recognize about Grant, they sort of think of him as a great general and a great warrior and all these kinds of things, I think the thing that made him really the best general was he found ways to avoid war when he could. You know, and if you think about Vicksburg, he found a way to not fight a battle there and at Appomattox Court House, he found a way to not fight a battle there. And I think those are actually the moments of genius for him and the moments where he demonstrated his greatest humanity. Right? So if we think about what happened at Appomattox Court House, you know he demonstrates a great deal of deference to Lee. He demonstrates a great deal of kindness to Confederate soldiers. There's a point there which his soldiers are celebrating and he tells them not to. He says, look, these are our countrymen. We need to recognize them and not shame them in this moment. Interesting thing about Buckner though. Buckner ends up surrendering when as the two guys who are ranked higher than him decided they don't want to do it. That's actually the first of two times that Buckner ends up surrendering. The second time is at the very end of the war. He is working for Edmund Kirby Smith who was sort of at the, one of the last Confederate surrender. Kirby Smith is trying to relocate his headquarters. He puts Buckner in charge for a brief moment. And it's during that brief moment that Kirby Smith's army dissipated, he decides that they need to surrender. So on two occasions, Buckner ends up taking responsibility for surrendering when his superior officers didn't want to do it. We need to serve some credit for that too.\n\n- Yeah, it sounds like Buckner kind of got the short straw a couple of times there during the war. Well that's really fantastic and fascinating. And thank you again, Dr. Silkenat joining us today, talking about surrender during the Civil War and Grant's role with it. Again, the book is, \"Raising the White Flag: How Surrender Defined the American Civil War\" published with University of North Carolina Press. And is there any way that we could, any videos or any other way we can learn more about you? Do you have a website or anything like that?\n\n- Well, so you can follow me on Twitter, I'm at @DavidSilkenat. I also have a podcast if you want to hear more of my voice on a regular basis. I do a podcast and my colleague Frank Cogliano who is a Thomas Jefferson specialist. It's called The Whiskey Rebellion.\n\n- Okay.\n\n- Partially because we live in Scotland and what happened with whiskey. But we have a weekly podcast where we talk about American history and politics and try to sort of make sense of the present using the past. So yeah, lots of ways to keep up with me.\n\n- Fantastic. All right. Thank you, Dr. Silkenat. We'll see you soon and thank you very much. Have a great day.\n\n- Thank you very much. It was my great pleasure.\n\n- Thank you.\n\n- All right. Hello everybody. This is Nick Sacco at Ulysses S Grant National Historic Site in St. Louis, Missouri. And it is my distinct pleasure today to be speaking with Emmanuel Dabney, Who's a park ranger at Petersburg National Battlefield in Virginia. This is episode two of our US Grant History Chat. So, to kind of kick things off of the Emmanuel here, I think it'd be really interesting to learn more about the operation at Petersburg National Battlefield and perhaps more specifically, you all take care of a Grant's Headquarters at City Point was really neat structure that is on the Battlefield there. So, you tell us a little bit about what you do at Petersburg, Emmanuel and maybe a little bit about Grant's Headquarters as well?\n\n- Sure. So thanks so much for asking me to participate. Our park Petersburg National Military Park when it was first established came about in 1926. So we're, getting long in the tooth now, but came later than some of the other national parks that are large landscapes that people are familiar with. We are a series of battlefields, and I always say if I ever get the chance to rename the park, I'm going to call it Petersburg National Battlefields with an s is we protect sites that cover nine and a half months of military action. The Senate around the city of Petersburg and the control of that city, whether it would remain in Confederate hands, a defended by Robert Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, and whether it would fall to the federal forces under the overall command of Lieutenant General Ulysses S Grant. For many years, the park did not have possession of the site in which Grant had his headquarters and supply depot during the Petersburg campaign. But in the late 1970s, the Eppes family who owned the land that Grant's Headquarters tent, and then later his cabin had been on sold their home and acreage around that house to the National Park Service. So, what had happened kind of in between the war and in between the late 1970s had happened kind of quickly in the summer of 1865 grants headquarters cabin that he had lived in during the winter of 1864 and 1865, had been moved from City Point Hopewell, Virginia to Philadelphia and put in Fairmount Park. This had been orchestrated by the President of the US Christian Commission, George Stewart, and all of the furnishings, as well as the building have been taken apart and shipped and reconstructed there in Philadelphia is this sort of gift to the city. It remained there with no real understanding by anyone in the late 19th, the early 20th century, about how to protect said building. And it didn't take long for it to become victim, to souvenir hunting, vandalism, rot and decay. In 1981, the National Park Service engaged with Fairmount Park and the City of Philadelphia officials about what to do with Grant's Cabin. And they agree that they would willingly sort of let it come back to Virginia. And after an archeological investigation, research investigation through documents, as well as photographs, the cabin was reconstructed in 1983 on its original location.\n\n- Interesting. So Grant's Cabin in Virginia, kind of had the same experience as his log cabin here in Saint Louis, where he built this log cabin when he lived in St. Louis before the Civil War, it got moved around several times. Relic hunters took a lot of different artifacts and items and even parts of the cabin itself and then it was reconstructed later on. So, kind of an interesting parallel with what's going on in Virginia and in his log cabin here in St. Louis. And with the Petersburg Battlefield, you mentioned several battlefields. So I'm thinking of places like the Battle of the Crater is like one of the battles that you talk about as well, in addition to the siege.\n\n- Yes. We have a range of military operations that began sort of June 9th, 1864, then a break of a few days and kicked off in earnest on June 15th, in what grant thought would be a quick assault on Petersburg because Lee's army was not there at the time. Confederate General P Beauregard had a small force of men defending Petersburg on that day, but a variety of things occurred that ended up lasting several more days. And by the afternoon of June 18th, Lee's Army was now joined with Beauregard forces in defending Petersburg. And over this nine and a half month military action, there was a series of battles. Certainly the one that people know us, I think the best for is the Battle of the Crater in July of 1864, but that's the beginning, still eight months of combat to go on. And so we certainly encourage our visitors to visit whatever elements of the battlefields that interest them. But to know that this is a long sustained campaign that had not been kind of seen before in the Eastern Theater. And, we're in a fortunate position right now that hopefully in coming years, as we got a new legislative boundary, we'll be able to add some new lands to the park boundary, and folks will be able to actually walk on those battlefields that we previously had been able to talk about from afar, but not actually walk the ground.\n\n- Very cool. Yeah. We'll have to see what happens with that legislation. Now, I followed your work for a couple of years now online, and I know you've been working on a number of research projects. So for example, you mentioned the Eppes family, I know you've been doing some research on the enslaved people that were owned by the Eppes family. And I know you've been doing some research on the Freedmen's Bureau, the sort of the social organization under the control of the US army during the reconstruction era. So maybe you kind of speak to us a little bit about your research projects and some of your findings.\n\n- Sure. So when I got to Petersburg, which this month I will, it's just amazing. I started 19 years ago as a seasonal employee, still in high school. And, I'm sort of out in the park as I had been even as a child, I grew up around here, I was sort of confronted with something that just didn't make sense. We had this plantation site that there was visible structures for and then there was ample evidence about what happened at that site, through the antebellum war time in post-war owners diaries, that span about 40 years. And yet the only mention really of enslaved people that he owned, or at least he claimed ownership over.\n\n- Sure.\n\n- It was a brief line on our site brochure, which I don't know when that was created, but my guess is sometime around 1981 or 1982. And I just started diving into these diaries because here was this evidence sort of waiting to be mined for more information. And over time, thanks to the developments of the internet. I have been excited and motivated and stayed up late at night and got up early in the morning, go to work, keep digging to find out more about these people. And so Richard Eppes, no one would say that he himself was famous, but he was a very wealthy in locally, in his community. He was well-known. And with that wealth came his inheritance and subsequent purchasing in those enslaved families, having more children to by the summer of 1860, he had 122 enslave people on his plantations and an excess of 3000 acres of land. The park today only owns about 21 acres at City Point. So just a fragment of what was his, nevertheless, the records tell us about all this stuff that's happening both within the household, outside of the household and through work from the works progress administration who interviewed at least one of the formerly enslaved men on episodes plantation right up through modern researchers. And then my own research, I've been able to document at least 10 men who escaped in 1862.\n\n- Wow. Wow\n\n- And joined the US Navy, which was not a discussion point prior to this. And it was kind of hard to figure out the internet opened up that door to that at least two others served, well, one left the Navy and joined the Army, but another one independently just joined the Army in US Colored Troop regimens and sort of, ironic twist of fate for them, they had left this area in 1862 and the regiments are stationed in the area in 1864, 1865. But so it's been exciting through pension research. We've been able to capture these people's stories, the complexity of their stories, other formerly enslaved people who testify on behalf of these men or their widows, which I think opens up this narrative for so long that because so many black people were illiterate prior to the war and during the war and for many years after the war, that we can't know this story and work from many researchers show that's not true, there if you use the pensions, you can get the story. And in that sort of what I have been engaged in doing, in fact, just this morning, I found one of the formerly enslaved men who became Navy person during the war I found his widow had been unable to secure a pension, but there was that evidence about their marriage and about their relationship with other formerly enslaved people that had been owned by the Eppes family. And many of these people though they left the plantation in 1862, they were intermarried with one another. And so they reconstructed their households and freedom down in Hampton Roads area of Virginia and lived next door to each other within a couple of streets from one another, and for the rest of their lives.\n\n- Wow. Wow. So there's, I think this is a wonderful example of a battlefield like Petersburg really going beyond maybe the tactics or strategies or what Grant Lee's Army were doing to really bring out sort of the human element of the battlefield and looking at enslaved people sort of utilizing their own agency to fight for freedom. And in the case of some of these men joining the US Military. So, I think it's really wonderful that research that you're doing and it'll be great for the site moving forward to be able to share more of those stories when people come to see the site. So I think that's great. And then finally, just to kind of wrap things up here with our last question, as you well know, the park recently got involved more deeply with the story of the reconstruction era with the establishment of reconstruction era National Historical Park, what a mouthful, but the new site in Buford, South Carolina. And so I'm curious about your thoughts on the National Park Service, telling the story of reconstruction, what happened in America after the Civil War? What direction do you see that playing out? What do you hope to see out of the park services, interpretive efforts moving forward?\n\n- Well, I definitely am excited for reconstruction era as a new site in the park service. I wish we could create multiple reconstruction areas, whether they be managed by the National Park Service or state park system, is this era, this period, which is of course, much debate about when it started and when it ended. But this period of time definitely is worthy of understanding in different communities, how things played out. And, but I think that, one of the things that is sort of interesting, and it has been interesting to me even before reconstruction era was established, was this notion that the National Park Service didn't have reconstruction sites or places to talk about this. And, sort of my first reaction was always, we got Andrew Johnson's home. And when you think more deeply it's these National Cemeteries come about as a result of war and reconstruction how our people as a whole, the nation as a whole one to make sense out of all of this bloodshed. And what does that mean for former Confederate soldiers bodies? How will the nation deal with those? 'Cause the body is they're still there and communities obviously dealt with them. And in some fairly similar ways, look through Caroline Janney's book on the Ladies' Memorial Associations. But, I think what has been the problem is that our traditional Civil War battlefield sites have struggled with how to balance what they feel like we were mandated to tell these stories about military tactics and battles in generals to what does it mean? And, so we were missing course context and consequences. And we finally now, got the green light to do this, in the early 2000. And it's taken some time for people I think, to know how to do it. And I think it's okay for people to still feel like they need some more information, but it's out there. It may take some efforts to go to the research repository, to talk to people in your community, because a lot of things have been segregated amongst people because black people in my own family have had a very different experience in the 1860s through the 1960s and sort of 100 years of large national strife on the issues of both, race and gender as well as the meaning of this cataclysmic war. And I am excited in that I see most sites are doing more topics, more conversations, looking at the different versions of reconstruction that wars with native American tribes out West, we're not some sort of something to separate from reconstruction. It's just a different version of reconstruction then dealing with sharecropping in the South.\n\n- Yeah. Fully, fully agreed. There's a lot of different directions and there's really stories of reconstruction, not just in the South, but in the North, in the West I mean really everywhere. So it's an exciting time to see more of an interest being taken in reconstruction. And hopefully some of the efforts of the park service will sort of translate over into schools as well, and sort of integrating the school curriculum with what the national parks are doing too. So, there's a lot to be excited about. So I really want to thank Emmanuel for being with us today. Really enjoyed hearing your perspective and yeah, so you you'll be at Petersburg and hopefully when we reopen folks out there can come and check you out in Virginia. And thank you so much Emmanuel.\n\n- Thank you. Have a great day.\n\n- Okay. You too.\n\n- Thanks.\n\n- All right, hello everybody this is Nick Sacco at Ulysses S Grant National Historic Site in St. Louis Missouri. And this is episode three of the US Grant History Chat. And today joining me is professor Travis Crum. He is a Bigelow fellow and lecturer in law at the University of Chicago Law School. And later this summer he'll be joining the faculty at Washington University St. Louis. He'll be a little bit closer to the park starting this summer. And professor Crum, he specializes in the 15th Amendment and we are in the 150th anniversary of the 15th Amendment right now. So a very timely and relevant topic. And I guess just to kinda kick things off for us here, Travis, you can tell us a little bit about your interest in the 15th Amendment. What kind of sparked the historical interest in this topic?\n\n- Thanks Nick for having me on to interview with you and I'm really looking forward to moving to St. Louis this summer. So let's spark my interest in the 15th Amendment. I guess there's two things. The kind of broader thing is that I've always been interested in issues of democratization and political theory. And the reconstruction period is one of our nation's attempts to better live up to our ideals. And there was a very brief period of time in the mid to late 19th century where the U.S was a multiracial democracy before Jim Crow was established. And so that kinda historical aspect of things caught my eye. More immediately the reason I delved into the 15th Amendment actually relates to my last work on the Voting Rights Act. And there was a provision of the Voting Rights Act that allows you to put States and counties under federal supervision if they violate the 14th or 15th Amendments. And when I was doing research for that it occurred to me that there was very little case law on what the 15th Amendment means. The Supreme Court has never decided whether a racist or intentional discrimination is needed to show a violation of the 15th Amendment. The Supreme Court has never decided whether or not a vote dilution or why the ordinary person on the street would call Gerrymandering is prohibited by the 15th Amendment. So there's all these open doctrinal questions when it comes to that amendment to the constitution. And when I dug into the history, there was a lot of history that and yet to be written about 15 amendment. It's oftentimes treated as an afterthought in the legal history as a reconstruction. They focus along the 13th amendment, a lot of ink has been spilled talking about the 14th amendment, But the 15th Amendment is kind of viewed as an inevitability. And I hope my research shows that that wasn't necessarily the case during reconstruction. And I'm trying to shine a new light on that amendment given the 150th anniversary that you mentioned.\n\n- Yeah definitely and just to clarify for folks who are watching. So the 15th Amendment, sometimes it's kind of incorrectly described as granting the right to vote African Americans, but in reality, it was really about just banning racial discrimination. So in some places that, through the Military Reconstruction Act of 1867 you had African Americans in the South who were already voting. And so the 15th Amendment basically just removes racial discrimination as a barrier for voting. And in reading your article, what I found very interesting is that a lot of political thinkers in the 19th century, they made this distinction between civil rights and political rights. And today we kind of combine both of those concepts together and we would think of something like voting as a part of civil rights but that wasn't necessarily the case in the 19th century. Maybe you kind of expand upon that a little bit.\n\n- Yeah, absolutely Nick. You're right that today the term civil rights is much more capacious and that term was used during reconstruction. So during reconstruction civil rights was a narrower category. There were referring to things like the right to Sue in DC the right to own property, the right to sign a contract, the right to be treated equally under the criminal law. Political rights, and that's how they were referred to back then they weren't referred to as voting rights. Political rights were the right to vote the right to hold office the right to sit on a jury. So it was kind of a bundle of rights. And the reason why the reconstruction generation distinguished between civil and political rights I think is two fold. One, is that these rights in many ways are different from one another. And that civil rights tend to be more atomistic. It tends to be, you signing a contract with your neighbor or me needing to own property and have a deed on file with the government. But political rights and the right to vote necessitates some sort of coalition building. It's more of an aggregate right. And so, that distinction was something to reconstruction framers, thought about. But the other and someone more insidious reason is that the difference between civil and political rights was a unifying a hierarchy and doling out political power in a very real way. And so the reconstruction generation did not view citizenship as synonymous with the right to vote the way that we do today. And the classic example here are relates not necessarily to African-Americans, but to women. White women were often cited as the example of people who are citizens, who could sign contracts, who could own property but they were not given the right to vote during reconstruction. And so that sort of distinction was in the minds of the reconstruction framers as they were drafting the 14th amendment which they viewed as primarily concerning civil rights. And later on when they drafted the 15th Amendment which was concerned with political rights.\n\n- Right, so the view of voting, in some cases it could be viewed as more of a privilege than a right. And so you have certain groups of people who are citizens through the 14th Amendment, but not necessarily eligible voters to participate in elections as well. So yeah, that definitely makes sense. And another aspect of your scholarship that stuck out was the what you described as the article five debate and essentially in determining the nature of Black voting rights in America would this be done through congressional legislation? Would it be done through a constitutional amendment? So I'd love to hear about the article five debate as well.\n\n- Thanks Nick, So the article five debate that you're talking about or you're referencing is something that I explicate in my new Northwestern University law review article the surplus 15th Amendment. And so to understand this debate, I think it's helpful to kind of go back in time and understand the political context of 1868, 1869. So in 1868, president Grant wins election and he does so in an electoral college landside but he only wins the popular vote by 300,000. And at the time that was largely attributed to the 500,000 African-American men who have been enfranchised by the first Reconstruction Act. And moreover, Grant won every Southern State but two where clan related violence stopped Blacks from going to the polls. And so Grant and the Republican Party really owe their political fortunes to African-American men coming out and supporting the Republican Party. And so in early 1869, when the radical Republicans came to Congress, you had a divided nation. You had a nation where 17 States had racially discriminatory laws on the books. And those States were mostly in the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest and the West Coast. By contrast in 17 States the former Confederacy or Congress had enfranchised Blacks some States in the Midwest and five of the six new England States African-American men could vote. And so there was a debate about how best to achieve nationwide Black male suffrage. And the radical Republicans like Senator Charles Sumner and representative George Boutwell. They thought that the newly ratified 14th Amendment gave Congress authority to pass the statute. And they advocated first passing a statute that would have been franchised blacks nationwide but also passing an amendment. And they thought that the newly enfranchised Black men in border States like Maryland and Missouri in Delaware and in swing States like Connecticut and New York would help push the 15th Amendment over the three fourths requirement for advocation under article five. Now moderate Republicans put a stop to this plan and they did so for two reasons. One is constitutional. Throughout the debate over the 14th Amendment ratification from 1866 to 1868, moderate Republicans insisted that the 14th Amendment did not confer suffrage. It did not go so far as to enfranchise Black men in border States and elsewhere where they were currently barred from the polls. And so they thought that that commitments throughout the debate limited the 14th amendment scope. And then secondly, and relatedly, they thought that there would be a political cost from going back on that promise. They worried that the newly enfranchised Black voters would be outnumbered by White voters who would turn to the Democratic Party and be upset about this change of political affairs. And so this debate, the moderate Republicans eventually won and given the small number of Democrats in Congress at the time, the moderate Republicans were able to essentially scuttle Voting Rights act of 1869 and push for a 15th Amendment. And from a constitutional law perspective it needs to meet is really important because it's the first post ratification debate about what the 14th Amendment means. And it also tells us that we should treat the 15th Amendment as an independent constitutional provision that gave new rights to Black male voters and gave new authority to Congress to remedy racial discrimination in voting.\n\n- Yeah, and what's interesting is that with the the 14th Amendment there, very interesting about whether or not, it sort of left an opening for potential future legislation to be passed. And by going the route of the constitutional amendment with the 15th Amendment, perhaps supporters of the 15th Amendment thought that in the long run that would be the more stable and harder barrier to overcome and the constitutional amendment is just simply overturning a law with the next session of Congress or what have you. But in the end, the 15th Amendment still kinda got thrown to the side anyway, even though it was a constitutional amendment.\n\n- No, I just sort of pick up when you're on point I mean, the decision to non make it a statute to not pass it but the rights Act of 1869 Two examples kinda come to mind. One, is that Congress would later pass a civil rights act of 1875 that prohibited racial discrimination in public accommodations. Things like railroads, things like hotels. And in 1883 of the Supreme Court struck down that law under the 14th Amendment saying that it targeted private action as opposed to state or governmental action. And so it's possible that something like that could have happened to a VRA in the reconstruction era. And then your point about Congress repealing these laws something like that did occur in the 1890s during the sort of early days of Jim Crow, Congress repealed many of the enforcement acts, not all, but many of the enforcement acts that had been passed during reconstruction to protect the right to vote. And so something like that could have happened if we did not have the 15th Amendment embedded in try and into the constitution.\n\n- Sure, absolutely that's very interesting. And then just to kinda wrap up our conversation here another central argument of your scholarship is that the courts today or in more recent history in trying to define who's an eligible voter and sort of the parameters of fair elections and fair voting, oftentimes they ironically go to the 14th Amendment but then less often they go to the 15th Amendment although the 15th is primarily focused on voting. So if you just kind of break that down for us. And why in your view the federal courts may be not giving as much attention to the 15th Amendment as they should.\n\n- Yeah so I think on that front, there's two reasons and there is somewhat path dependent. One is to kinda go back to the point that you made earlier that the 15th member was forgotten during Jim Crow. And during that period the 14th amendment started to be interpreted to protect the right to vote. Much like we do today, when we use the term civil rights to include the right to vote. The 14th Amendment beginning in the 1920s but really accelerating in the 1960s, 1970s was interpreted capaciously to encompass the right to vote. And the most famous example of these cases or this broader interpretation of 14th Amendment is the one person one vote line in cases. And so in the 1960s you had what we would call rotten boroughs. You had places that would have 1000, 2000 voters controlling a state legislative district and next door in a city you would have 50,000 voters and they would each get one member of the state house delegates. And so when the Supreme Court started striking down there was discharged. It relied on the 14th Amendment as the constitutional hook to do that. And that kinda reshaped how we think about the 14th amendment. But the other is a little bit more recent and that's the Voting Rights Act. And so ever since the Voting Rights Act was amended in 1982 to make it clear that it applied to Gerrymandering, and to discriminatory effects claims, the VRA or the Voting Rights Act has been the primary engine of voting rights litigation as opposed to the 14th or 15th Amendments. Because it's a lot easier to prove a statutory claim than a constitutional claim. To prove that someone is infringing on the right to vote because of race under the constitution, you need to show discriminatory intent. Whereas under the Voting Rights Act is just a discriminatory effect showing. And so let me illustrate that with a very simple example. Imagine you have a city that is 25% African-American, and you have 10 city council seats. Now it might be for groundswell African-American should have two legislative seats or three legislative seats but if they had only one legislative seat that would be a very easy claim to bring under the Voting Rights Act because they're only getting one tenth of the seats on that legislature. By contrast in order to bring a claim under the 14th Amendment, you have to show that that city council plan was enacted or maintained with a racist or discriminatory intent. And that requires a good deal of discovery is very fact intensive and courts and judges are very reluctant to say that politicians are doing things for racist reasons. And so the discriminatory effects standard allows you to avoid the sidestep a lot of those problems and protect the right to vote in a much more straightforward way.\n\n- Fascinating, fascinating, absolutely. So there's a lot to unpack with the the potential power of the 15th Amendment and then kind of connecting that to future civil rights legislation and the Voting rights Act and what have you as well. So that's really great information and I know all of us in St. Louis will be looking forward to your arrival to work with WashU in the law department there. And once again, this is Travis Crum. Thank you so much for speaking with us today and we'll see you around here in St. Louis.\n\n- Thanks Nick, looking forward to moving there.\n\n- All right, thank you.\n\n- Okay, hello everybody. This is Nick Sacco, Park Ranger at Ulysses S. Grant National Historic Site, in St. Louis Missouri. And this is episode four of the US Grant History Chat. And it's my pleasure today to be speaking with Anne Tucker. Ann is a Professor of History at the University of North Georgia. And she has a book coming out through the University of Virginia Press. It's called \"Newest Board of Nations European Nationalist Movements and the Making of the Confederacy.\" So kind of placing political thought within the Confederacy within the international context. So some really interesting stuff to sort of jump into. So thanks for being with us today Ann.\n\n- Thanks for having me.\n\n- Absolutely, so to kinda kick it off here, in reading the introduction to your book and the book is coming up in June, right? Later.\n\n- That's right.\n\n- So it'll be coming out very soon. And in the introduction, you mentioned that the 19th century, we're seeing some pretty dramatic political changes really throughout the world. Some of these minors keys and empires that had existed there are challenges to these rules, we're kind of seeing a spirit of democracy taking place in South America and Europe and other parts of the world. And we're seeing kind of these there's the rise of nationalist movements and this belief in people being able to self-determination and having the right to choose their own leaders. And so you highlight Giuseppe Garibaldi who is a revolutionary who participates in revolutions all over the world. And you mentioned that as the Civil War is kind of brewing and getting ready to break out in 1861 you have both supporters of the Union and supporters of the Confederacy who are very familiar with Giuseppe Garibaldi and they're sort of claiming his legacy for a justification of their own movement. So if you could maybe tell us just a little bit about who this guy was, who Giuseppe Garibaldi was and how could both Unionists and Confederates find justification for their causes through this one person?\n\n- Absolutely, well, like you say, the 19th century was this age of nationalists revolutions, where, like you say these ideas of national self-determination, democracy were spreading throughout the Atlantic world and just suddenly Garibaldi really came to be a symbol of all of these ideas. So Garibaldi of course, was one of the key figures of the Italian Risorgimento or unification of Italy. He was Italian himself. He was a military general who helped lead the military campaigns of Italian unification but he had also previously fought for national independence in South America, even before he went to fight in his home country at Italy. And his career really propelled him to international celebrity, even in his own lifetime. He was the hero of two worlds. Really internationally associated with these ideas, again, of national independence, national virtue, etc. And so, because he was the symbol really of the same values that 19th century Americans valued of course, the United States was a nation based on a nationalist revolt against tyranny and favor of democracy and self-determination. So Garibaldi was this international symbol of the values that 19th century Americans held dear. And so that's what really allowed both northerners and southerners and the lead up to the Civil War and during the Civil War itself even to use Garibaldi as really a symbol of what they were trying to claim they were fighting for in the Civil War. And so when we look at the Confederates white Southerners were drawing comparisons between the Confederacy and Garibaldi's Italy as a way to try to attach Garibaldis acclaim and legitimacy to the Confederacy. So they're claiming the Confederacy is the same as Italy. It represents the same values of self-determination and democracy. And therefore, because we are like Garibaldi's Italy we are legitimate as well. Of course, the problem with that was they weren't the same. They weren't fighting for the same cause, they were fighting for the defense of slavery, for their ability to control a government to protect slavery and Garibaldi recognized this difference as well. So during the Civil War, Garibaldi comes out in favor of the North and in favor of abolition which causes problems for Confederate comparisons as I discuss in my book. So far as the North goes though this was obviously a easier path to draw that connection between Garibaldi, his nationalism, his abolitionism and the values of the United States. And that connection was clear enough that the United States actually issued an invitation to Garibaldi to come fight for the United States and the Civil War. Now, this didn't happen largely because of logistical issues with Garibaldi demanding the right to be commander in chief, which was constitutionally impossible. He also declared however he wanted the ability to free the slaves before he would come fight for the North. So the Civil War in many ways, I argue as this war over competing interpretations of these 19th century ideas of nationalism. And again, both North and South thought, if they could connect themselves to Garibaldi, that would help them prove that they had the best, most legitimate value of nationalism. Obviously this worked better for the North than for the South, however.\n\n- Sure, sure and it's very interesting with Garibaldi cause if it's 1863 and the US government embraces the emancipation as a warring, perhaps they're catching up to Garibaldi but he was maybe a little too far ahead in 1861 by using that as sort of a term for him to, in order to join the US army and Lincoln administration is not quite there in 1861. So that's very interesting. Now, there's something else that was brought up in your introduction that you discuss is that you have white southerners who support the Confederacy, and some of them, not all of them but some of them are justifying their movement based on the concept of self-determination and the examples of other countries, such as Italy that are trying to have their own independence movements as well. But you do highlight that a lot of Europe in the end end up sort of rejecting the Confederacy. And so of course, the institution of slavery being one of the issues behind them. Maybe you can tells just a little bit as to why perhaps these nations of Europe in many cases are rejecting the Confederate succession movement.\n\n- Sure, absolutely. Again, basically what I'm arguing is that the 19th century Atlantic world was this place on time of debate about the meaning of nationhood and legitimate expressions of nationhood. And the Confederates I look at are really making the case that they're part of this, they're part of this age of nationalist revolts and they deserve independence because they either fall in the footsteps of nations like Italy or they a more conservative strain of thoughts as they purify the nationalism seen in places in Europe that conservative slaveholding Confederates claimed was excessively liberal. So this is the argument that Confederates are making in their popular discourse, trying to justify to themselves and the rest of the world, why they're legitimate, why the Confederacy should be recognized as an independent nation. This really doesn't work outside the Confederacy however. I talk about in my book, there are a few Europeans and northerners who accept at least the idea that the Confederacy is following in the footsteps of nations abroad and fighting for national self-determination, fighting for the right of self government, etc. And certainly when we look at Europeans there are conservatives who would be quite happy to see the American Republic fail. And particularly when we look at European reaction to the Civil War before the Emancipation Proclamation as you were talking about a minute ago, a lot of Europeans really aren't quite clear on what this is all about why this Republic is tearing itself apart. And so if the South is claiming self-determination, why not? And as you noted, the Emancipation Proclamation does become a key turning point then where Europeans start going, oh this is a war about slavery. Now we understand, and this is critical to Europeans rejection of the Confederacy then because the Confederates are claiming a slave holding nation still fits within a 19th century ideas of nationalism. Most of the rest of the Atlantic world has moved to the point where it does not, they've embraced ideas of abolitionism or at least antislavery that recognize you can't have slavery and self-government, you can't have slavery and natural rights. And so the North is embracing this anti-slavery, Great Britain of course, had already moved to being a world's leader in abolition. And so once the United States is clear that they're fighting to end slavery, it becomes clear that Confederacy is fighting to defend slavery and Europeans realize those Confederate claims, they're fighting for these ideals of nationalism and self-determination, they don't hold water. They're actually fighting for slavery which we have rejected as part of this set of ideas of nationalism, basically. So now when we look at Confederate official diplomacy really the main reason why Great Britain and France don't recognize the Confederacy is they didn't want to, they were busy with other affairs, they didn't wanna get involved in the war. But when we do look at public opinion that helped lead that response, We do see that while some Europeans are fine with the Confederacy and even accept its claims most Europeans really reject Confederates claims that their interpretation is a legitimate interpretation of 19th century nationalism.\n\n- That's really fascinating. And I love how you clarified with the Emancipation Proclamation. It better helps Europeans better understand what the fighting is all about. It's not simply a fight over territory, but it's over larger ideals of slavery, freedom, democracy and natural rights in America. So Emancipation Proclamation has these international implications what's going on in United States as well. So I love that, that's really great. And then just to wrap up our conversation here, I'm fascinated as well with the concept of Southern Unionists as well. Ulysses S. Grant probably would identify as a southerner but he did live in Missouri for a period of time. And you know, here in Missouri we're right in the heart of things, you have people who are on all sides of the political spectrum but you had many Unionists here in Missouri. And so you're looking at it more broadly, but Southern Unionists are also sort of utilizing the language of democracy and self-determination to justify the importance of maintaining the union. So if you could speak for a minute about Southern Unionist and how they use the same sort of rhetoric to justify keeping the country together, I'd love to hear about that too.\n\n- Absolutely, yeah. When I wrote this book, I knew that I wanted to look at Southern Unionists and it really was one of my favorite findings in the book in part because it helps drive home that the international perspectives that southerners are using to understand and make cases for their nationhood, it really was wide spread. It's Confederates, it's Unionist it's Democrats, it's Wigs. That's really the whole political spectrum but the Unionists are also fun because of course they're taking this international perspective that Confederates had used to try and justify the Confederacy and they're turning it completely on its head. So what the Southern Unionists are arguing, for one thing they're arguing much like much of the North, including Lincoln did, that the United States is the last best hope of democracy and republicanism for the world. So when these Southern Unionists look at European nationalist movements, for example they realistically see a lot of failure. Italy was in many ways, the exception. So Garibaldi's Italy succeeded in gaining national independence and unity but the revolutions of 1848, for example failed. And so the Unionists are looking at that and saying democracy is on the retreat, republicanism is failing, monarchy and empire are reasserting their power. The United States is really the key republic internationally and if we fail, if we fall apart that's going to prove monarchists argument that republicanism can't work, that it's not a viable form of government. And so the Unionists are arguing that the United States has to be preserved not just for its own sake, but for the sake of all of these aspiring nations and Europe. For the sake of Hungary, for the sake of Poland, for the sake of Ireland. So they're using these international comparisons to argue that the US must be preserved. But they're also using these international comparisons and trustingly to make a case for national unity as a value period. So they're looking at Europe and pulling examples of nations that they claim have been created through unity like Italy which had just succeeded in national unification. And they're claiming unification is what has made Italy strong. It's what has allowed Italy to emerge from, you know, decades and centuries of oppression into the light of democracy again. And they're looking at Germany which had yet to begin its fully unification movement. They're looking at Poland which had been partitioned decades earlier and they're saying Germany, Poland, these are examples of divided nations. They show us that divided nations are weak and that divided nations can't protect people's rights basically. So for Southern Unionists, unity is how you get national strength and how you get protection for your rights. That's what they learned from an international context.\n\n- Sure, absolutely. In your comments said one more thing that popped in my mind and that would be the Gettysburg address, famous speech. I'm sure you talk about it in your book, but there's a lot of discussion in the Gettysburg address about the entire world and the significance of this moment of Civil War in America and how it shaped future political developments in the world as well.\n\n- Yeah, yeah, you know, I always say that, you know, I grew up in the South, you know, I was certainly very into Civil War history. I've memorized the Gettysburg address for fun as a child. But you know, we always hear the story of the Civil War as this brother versus brother war just kind of the ultimate domestic dispute, but things like the Gettysburg address really do show us that people at the time in the United States and the Confederacy really did conceive of this war as having much broader international implications. Again, not just Confederates, not just Southern Unionist but northerners like Lincoln also saw this as really part of this larger struggle about the meaning and expression of nationhood. What does democracy look like? Can it work? Who gets to participate in the democracy? Who has rights within a democracy? And so, yeah, I love the way that this really shows us that it was a domestic war but one with enormous international importance far beyond the borders of the United States.\n\n- Wow, fascinating stuff. This is the sort of history I love studying. So it's been great having you on today. So Anne Tucker, your book is coming out very soon here, \"Newest Board of Nations European Nationalists Movements and the Making of the Confederacy\" through the University of Virginia Press. And yeah, we look forward to seeing, hopefully you have future talks and presentations about your book. So we'll definitely make sure to follow your scholarship moving forward as well. Thanks Ann.\n\n- Well, thank you.\n\n- All right, have a great day, thank you.\n\n- Thanks.\n\n- Hello, everybody. This is Nick Sacco, Park Ranger at Ulysses S. Grant National Historic Site in St. Louis, Missouri, and this is episode five of the U.S. Grant History Chat. It is my distinct pleasure to be interviewing Dr. Elizabeth Samet, who is the author of the Annotated Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant. And so to kind of kick off our interview with Dr. Samet today, many of you watching might recognize her from her participation in the recent documentary on the History Channel on Ulysses S. Grant. Dr. Samet, we would love to hear a little bit about what that process was like. What was it like being on the documentary and just kind of give us some insights. We'd love to hear about that.\n\n- Well, it was a great treat for me to be a part of that endeavor so long in the making. We filmed a while ago, and of course, when you film those interviews, you know only what you've said and you don't really have any idea of how it will fit in with the rest of the narrative. So I watched along with everyone else at the premiere, and of course that was not how anyone imagined it, that would happen during a period of crisis, but I think that the Memorial Day date was very appropriate and I think that it garnered a lot of viewers as a result of that timing. Seeing it all unfold and seeing the ways in which the film was crafted was really a great treat for me, and to be able to see, it's so hard of course to fit an entire life into six hours, so I was happy to see both his earlier life as well as the Civil War, and then of course at the end, also the presidency and the writing of the memoirs. Of course, the memoirs are so important to me. There's never enough time in these things devoted to the memoirs for my taste, but I think they did give a great flavor of how he finished them up in the cottage in Mount McGregor, New York.\n\n- Sure, absolutely. I think what's interesting too with a lot of these documentaries, it's almost like pieces of a puzzle where you have all these different historians but then you're also adding these dramatic scenes, these sort of historical reenactments, and you got to kind of put the pieces together, and to your point, you can easily spend a six hour documentary on the memoirs alone, so it was nice to at least see a little bit of the mention of the memoirs in there. And to that point, your recently published annotated memoirs. I've had a chance to flip through them. I thought they were beautifully illustrated and your annotations, your explanations in the memoirs are very helpful for modern readers, but understandably this is a huge undertaking that you did. What kind of motivated you to start this project in the first place, and what was that process like creating this annotated edition of Grant's memoirs?\n\n- I would say that most of the work in a concentrated fashion took place over the last several years, but I realized as I was editing that as I was working on it, that in some strange way I had been working on it for 20 years in that I first found the memoirs a long time ago in graduate school, actually. My specialty is literature, not history. I read this fascinating book and I can't even do the archeology anymore of how I got there, but instead of writing my PhD dissertation, I was reading this book and it didn't conform to any expectations that I had about what a 19th century general would sound like or write. It seemed totally self-effacing. It did not have the kinds of rhetorical flourishes and the sort of purple prose that we associate with many 19th century writings about war. One of the things initially very early on in the memoirs, in one of the first chapters, Grant writes about his experience as a student at West Point, saying that he spent most of his time actually reading novels. That charmed me immediately, of course, as someone whose specialty is literature, and he read Scott and Cooper and Washington Irving and sort of was very typical in that sense of a 19th century reader, and so it gave me a window into 19th century culture, and also at the time, I found it, I have to say difficult to trace some of the battles. I've since visited many of the sites, and so now when I read it, whenever I go to visit a site I will read that chapter in the memoirs as preparation and then to be able to see the actual site. That was of course one of his great gifts as a soldier and as a commander, was this ability to look at a map once. He just had this wonderful facility, this almost photographic memory for the terrain and the topography. I don't have that, so it was great to be able to actually visit the sites, and I think the documentary did a nice job with that as well, showing us sort of, things like that. And so I was acquainted with the memoirs for a long time and then the opportunity came to edit them, and I was just thrilled. And so that was a nice sort of coincidence really, and it was great.\n\n- Sure, sure. I guess along these lines, a question that just popped in my mind here. Have you had a background, with your literature background, have you had any other interactions with other writings about the Civil War, say Ambrose Bierce or somebody else like that that's kind of stuck out to you as well?\n\n- Yes, in fact, one of the things that I worked hard to do in the annotations, because of course I'm deeply indebted to all of the historians, the military historians who analyzed and annotated the memoirs, but my primary interest was in trying to situate this book and to situate Grant into a literary and a cultural context as well, and so I looked at a lot of memoirs, at a lot of non-fiction and a lot of fiction, including Bierce, also De Forest, his novel about the Civil War, Ms. Ravenel's conversion and his journals and diaries, and I think De Forest is an undervalued writer who, like Bierce, did not look at the romantic aspects of combat but looked at the grim brutality of it all. I think that that was what Grant, actually, I think that's what he figured out about war as early as his experience in the Mexican War, but it's surely shaped his attitudes toward the Civil War and to the way he wrote about it. So I try to include all kinds of memoirs from the time and also fiction, poetry, to sort of think about what this memoir means to the history of war writing.\n\n- Absolutely, that's really wonderful. It's one of the great insights of the memoirs, because it does provide that, your annotated memoirs provides that larger literary context as well, certainly. In your research, when you were working on the memoirs, what was one of the big insights or takeaways or perhaps a discovery that you made in these years of studying the memoirs, maybe one passage that you go back to all the time?\n\n- It's a hard question, the hardest question I'm asked usually, because there are so many passages and I've spent so much time with it that there are passages I sort of carry around with me and they help explain the world to me sometimes. One of the passages is from early on in the memoirs where he's talking about the two commanders he worked with in Mexico, General Winfield Scott and General Zachary Taylor, who were really opposites in many, many ways except in the fact that they were successful commanders. Grant has this wonderful passage in the early chapters about these two generals and about how they write and talk. I found that fascinating that that's what he would concentrate on, less on how they fought, but instead how they talked and how they wrote. I really think about someone who was so conscious of the way that he spoke, the way that he communicated, and I think that that's a really interesting and perhaps understudied aspect of military culture. So that's one of the passages that sticks with me. That's the end of Chapter 10, and it's just a wonderful little portrait of these two men. The memoirs, it's full of these wonderful little portraits of different commanders, different people he encountered, and they'll just come up in a paragraph and he's able to distill someone's character in that way. The person's character that I think he finds most mysterious is that of Lee, and so the passage that I think of, that I often go back to because it has significance for Grant but I think it also has significance for us as a country and particularly now we're dealing not only as we have this discussion, not only with the pandemic but with protests and violence across the country. And I think that much of this violence is rooted in our history, and I think that part of what Grant's memoirs offers is a corrective to what's commonly called the lost cause mythology that demoted slavery as one of the causes of the Civil War and instead turned to the phrase state's rights. I think that Grant was not confused at all about the nature of the Civil War, about the issues being fought over, and I think that he would have been slightly mystified about the ways in which we have since remembered the war. So this passage where he meets with Lee at Appomattox kind of emphasizes for me the way that he understood the war and the way that he understood his role in it. If we have the time, I'm happy to read just a little bit of the chapter. It's from Chapter 67, and one of the things that makes it typical is that he always is dispelling the romance of war and he's always saying look, it's a great story, but this is what really happened. One of the myths that grew up was that of the apple tree, that there was a famous apple tree there, so he starts with that. Before stating what took place between General Lee and myself, he writes, I will give all there is of the story of the famous apple tree. Wars produce many stories of fiction, some of which are told until they are believed to be true. The War of the Rebellion was no exception to this rule, and the story of the apple tree is one of those fictions based on a slight foundation of fact. As I have said, there was an apple orchard on the side of the hill occupied by the Confederate forces. Running diagonally up the hill was a wagon road which at one point ran very near one of the trees so that the wheels of vehicles had on that side cut off the roots of the tree, leaving a little embankment. General Badcock of my staff reported to me that when he first met General Lee, he was sitting upon this embankment with his feet in the road below and his back resting against the tree. The story had no other foundation than that. Like many other stories, it would be very good if it was only true, and that's sort of typical of Grant's understated humor as well. And then it goes on to talk about his acquaintance with Lee. I had known General Lee in the old army, that's of course in the Mexican War, and did not suppose, owing to the difference in our age and rank, that he would remember me. Well, I would more naturally remember him distinctly, because he was the Chief of Staff of the Engineers of General Scott in the Mexican War. When I had left camp that morning, I had not expected so soon the result that was then taking place, and consequently was in rough garb. I was without a sword, as I usually was when on horseback on the field, and wore soldier's blouse for a coat with the shoulder straps of my rank to indicate to the army who I was. Grant, of course, had this famous dislike for military uniform.\n\n- Absolutely.\n\n- When I went into the house, I found General Lee. We greeted each other, and after shaking hands took our seats. I had my staff with me and a good portion of whom were in the room during the whole of the interview. What General Lee's feelings were I do not know, as he was a man of much dignity with an impassible face. It was impossible to say whether he felt inwardly glad that the end had finally come or felt sad over the result and was too manly to show it. Whatever his feelings, they were entirely concealed from my observation, but my own feelings, which had been quite jubilant on the receipt of his letter were sad and depressed. I felt like anything rather than rejoicing at the downfall of a foe who had fought so long and valiantly and had suffered so much for a cause. Though that cause was, I believe, one of the worst for which a people ever fought and one for which there was the least excuse. I do not question, however, the sincerity of the great mass of those who were opposed to us. And then he goes on to describe the terms and he dispels the rumor of the sword, you know, the celebrated hand over the sword. The story ran in newspapers long after that, but he said it's the purest romance.\n\n- Sure, absolutely. That's one of my favorite passages from the memoirs as well, because I think Grant, in his mind he's willing to acknowledge the sincerity and sort of the sacrifices that were made by these Confederate soldiers, but he's still not, he's not giving them a full break, and he's still asserting the the importance and significance of what the Union cause was all about as well. With the rise of lost cause literature in the 1880s and going on from there, we can see Grant is sort of offering a rebuttal to that interpretation of the war in this passage.\n\n- Right, and when he was young, when he was lieutenant in the Mexican War, he was fighting in a war in which he did not believe. He's clear about that in the memoirs. I think at the time he thought less about the cause, but he had that experience. He said that was a purely political war, an unjust war, and the Civil War he believed in was a war of principle, and so you can see that I think very clearly in this depiction of what happened at the surrender.\n\n- Absolutely, I fully agree 100%. Well, this has been really wonderful. Thank you to Dr. Elizabeth Samet for speaking today with us a little bit about her Annotated Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant. I know you've written a couple of other books too along the lines of the Civil War. You can maybe tell us a little bit about that to wrap up our interview.\n\n- Sure. One of the things that I did before this book actually was an anthology of leadership. It's not just military leadership, but it does certainly involve some Grant and a lot of Lincoln. I think there's much to be learned from reading his work as well, obviously.\n\n- Sure, well fantastic. Thank you so much, Dr. Samet. We look forward to seeing your progress with your book here, and those who haven't seen the documentary, look out for Dr. Samet on the documentary as well. Thank you.\n\n- Thank you, Nick, I appreciate it.\n\n- All right, Hello everybody. This is Nick Sacco, park ranger, at Ulysses S grant national historic site, in St. Louis, Missouri. And this is the U S grant history chat. This is episode number six, and it's my pleasure today to be speaking with Dr Conevery Valencius, who is a historian of science at Boston university. I think it's just so cool, because as a historian of science you have to really master two different disciplines which is not easy. And Dr. Valencius teaches among other courses, the civil war and reconstruction, the history of medicine, and the history of science. And so I wanted to kind of play into that expertise to have a conversation about, the practice of medicine during the civil war, logistics in the civil war, and a little bit about Grant's role in all of these things. So thank you, Dr. Valencius for being with us today. To start things off, your work examines, transformations to the practice of medicine in the United States. And I'd love to hear a little bit about, what is the state of medical science at the beginning of the civil war, and perhaps share with us some of, the insights that you've come way within your research, over the years, looking at this particular topic?\n\n- Sure. One quick thing, is that in Boston we have a whole bunch of universities with really confusing and overlapping names.\n\n- Sure.\n\n- I actually went to Boston college,\n\n- Boston college, thank you.\n\n- Bunch of fine universities among which VU is among.\n\n- Okay, thank you. So, in 1850, in 1860, anytime up to the beginning of the civil war, the main medical practitioner, that most people living in the United States would have encountered, would be a midwife. That would probably be the most trusted, medical practitioner. Doctors were certainly called in. They gave people medicines, they helped them in the transitions of health and of life. They were, in some ways as much status symbol as anything else. There was not, merely as much difference in efficacy and actually what worked, between what doctors would offer, and what other, you know, local healers, midwives, route doctors would offer. It wasn't nearly as much differentiation there as, the more educated physicians wanted to assert. Hospitals, leading up to the civil war, were only a place typically, for very poor people to be sick and die, often of a sexually transmitted disease related illnesses, or simply of, the ailments of very hard lives. But only hospitals most people would be familiar with, would be plagued hospitals essentially, that is quarantine institutions set up, in the midst of it, in reaction to pandemics like the one we're living in right now.\n\n- Sure.\n\n- Most of the time, people who entered the hospital did so out of desperation, and didn't necessarily expect to leave. All of that changed, as a result, of the experience of the United States civil war. We got hospitals that were institutions that many soldiers fighting in the civil war, particularly those fighting for the United States, had the experience of going into, an institution called the hospital, and walking, out better than they had walked in. They had the experience of encountering, an explicit and increasingly professionalized, cadre of people, mostly although not all women, who were dedicated to nursing these men. It is through the civil war that we get nursing, as a vocation, as a profession, rather than just as, something that anybody did, when you had sick family members or someone in your household to take care of. We also got differentiation of care, both on the battlefield, and different ways of addressing illness, or sort of injury, on the battlefield, in a field hospital. And then you know, in a more specialized institution removed from care, removed from the battlefield. And we got the institution of quantification, statistics, numerical analysis of what worked and what didn't, that went along with the whole development of different wards for different purposes. So, even as germ theory, in the night 1860s, was beginning to lighten everybody's intellectual world, in Europe, And for those who had access to them in scientific publications in the United States. Even if that's happening, it didn't have any impact yet, on the course of the U S civil war. Nobody understood that washing hands would save lives, in 1860, and they didn't understand it, most of them by 1865 either. But all of the institutional and logistical changes that were needed, to implement this revolution of medical care, were all happening in and through this tumultuous conflict.\n\n- Wow. And that, I really loved that insight about hospitals as well, because, before the civil war it sounds like if you're going to a hospital, I mean, that was pretty much the end of the road for you. Whereas, with the civil war, the field in a way is becoming more professionalized, there's statistical analysis being done. And there's a possibility that if you go to a hospital, you might actually, be able to get out and still be alive, thanks to some of the transformations that are happening, during the civil war. So that's really fascinating, Absolutely. And kind of connected to this here to, you discuss a bit in your scholarship about, the logistics of medical practice, and what you described as business efficiency. And, I would love to hear a little bit more about that. because grant himself would have known about this. Having served in the Mexican American war, as a quartermaster, he's got to make sure he's getting supplies, food, and resources to his troops. And so, I would love to hear a little bit more about, sort of the relationship of logistics, and medical practice during the civil war as well.\n\n- So, one of the things that we often Think about rightly, is the changes in medical care, because so many medical practitioners, unfortunately, got so much practice, in the internal workings of the human body. But what we also don't necessarily think behind is, how many, young men, not only got practice in wielding ornaments, right, and saddling up mules. But they also got practice in using account books, to keep track of where the blankets were, and where they were needed. They got practice understanding railroad scheduling, and who you needed to work with, and how you needed to communicate with others, in order to get the morphine, to where it was needed. And all of those seemingly mundane administrative skills, were just as important, I would argue, as the battlefield skills, in remaking the United States, after the civil war. It is those young men, you know, some of them with glasses like mine, who couldn't serve on the front,\n\n- Right, who were getting good at enormous realms of paperwork, right. Of the bureaucracy of a massive administrative apparatus. And that, enabled the massive growth, of nationwide commercial enterprises, of train systems that ran on time, right. A huge communications infrastructure. So the soldiers and the officers who watched, as one of the forward pieces, of the union army trains, throughout the war, but especially after grant assumed command, was the mobile Telegraph wires, being laid, often with a spool of newfangled telephone Telegraph wire, that had special installation on it, from the back of a mule, right, going along with forward parties, and the pioneer crews, who were scouting ahead, and making roads, were also selecting the right trees to cut down, and then put up, in order for Telegraph wires to be attached, as the American army moved.\n\n- Wow.\n\n- And, every soldier seeing, that as they marched by, there were wires already draped on the bushes. And then a little while later, you know from these improvise, they understood, infrastructure, in a way that was new to them, and will enormously, impacted the course of us history after the war.\n\n- Yeah and, if I'm understanding the argument here correctly, I think we can see a connection between, the civil war and industrialization in the country, sort of breeding this new generation of, accountants, managers statisticians, that are playing their own role after the civil war, in fostering industrial growth, and sort of managing this growth economically speaking, as well in the future too, It sounds like.\n\n- Absolutely. So the administrative, what we would in modern sense maybe call the project management skills, right. back off, of the enormous administrative might, of the U S army, of U S armed forces, allowed for, all of what we tend to think of as the private enterprise, right. Of the gilded age.\n\n- Wow, fantastic. That's really fascinating. And, and then finally, we talked a little bit ahead of time, and you're pretty familiar with grants personal memoirs, and i was kind of curious about your own studying of the memoirs, and what is one or multiple takeaways that you got from, studying Grant's memoirs?\n\n- One of my favorite stories about U S grants, took place before he was famous, when he was still kind of a wash out really, when he recoded, soldiers in Illinois and been an appointed a Colonel, and, was assigned to go chase away some forces of the Missouri state guard, not very far from you, a little North of there in Florida,\n\n- Right. Florida Missouri , it is the birthplace of the person at that point, known as Samuel Clemens, right now known to us as Mark Twain, who later was the publisher, of Grant's memoirs,\n\n- Right\n\n- to make that come about. So grant was assigned, to clear out these pro Confederate forces. He described in his memoir, marching with his men. And as he said, his heart Rose further and further into his throat, the more they marched. All I wished he said was to be back in Illinois. He said, the only reason I kept going, was that I did not have the heart to stop, and consider what to do. He is quaking in his boots, as he rides along. He comes to the brother Hill, where he expects to see, Harris's camp before him. And it's deserted. They have decamped, they have run. It occurred to me then, Grant writes in his memoirs, that Harris was as afraid of me, as I was of him. That was a view of the question he wrote, that had not before occurred to me, but that I never forgot after. And that is such a moving Testament. This is a 19th century American military leader, communicating to the American public, that he was terrified to lead, in his first command, and that he got over it. And, everyone who served of under him later, talked about his calm, but he did not fall into this myth of the unstoppable Bobby Lee. He said well, what are we going to do? And throughout Grant's leadership, he never failed to acknowledge, what ordinary soldiers, were feeling, and experiencing. He also, never failed to acknowledge, where he had changed, and he had learned. And that is one of the most lasting gifts I think, of his presidency, to our understandings of national leadership.\n\n- I would fully agree. And, I love the passages that you cite there too. because they, I think they have applicability in our daily lives as well. I mean, we're all kind of scared of different situations that pop up in our lives but, sometimes you have to realize that, everybody else has their own fears too. It's not just us, personally as well. So, I love that. That's really great. And, and then finally, just to kind of wrap things up, if we have viewers that want to learn a little bit more about your scholarship, and your contributions to the history of science, where you can tell us a little bit about, some of your scholarship.\n\n- Sure. Actually, could I plug two other people's books?\n\n- Sure, absolutely.\n\n- Kevin, I don't have them here, because I'm not in my off-work office, but Kevin Levine's search that the myth of the black Confederate, addresses a question a lot of people have, about the false history, being promoted, about the African-American Confederate soldiers, that didn't actually exist. And the three cornered war by Megan Kate Nelson, talks a lot about the war in the West, which might be of interest to, those of y'all interested in the Western history. And, if you want to know more about medicine in the 19th century, the yellow book, the health of the country, is something I wrote, about ideas of health, and environment, in the 19th century, American West, and the lost history of the new Maverick earthquakes. And y'all in Missouri know how to pronounce\n\n- Yes.\n\n- that name of new Mandarin, has, features a stirring civil war battle, the battle for Island number 10. So it's about earthquakes, but it's also about the U S civil war.\n\n- I love it. I'm adding those to my book list. And the one book here, I have Kevin Levine's book right here actually. So that's, in my bookshelf that I would get. I would, hardly second that recommendation, and Meghan Kate Nelson's book is on my reading list as well. So thank you so much, Dr. Conevery Valencius, and at Boston college. So, thank you so much for being with us today, and we'll see you around the future. Thank you.\n\n- Thank you. Bye bye.\n\n- Okay, hello, everybody, this is Nick Sacco, park ranger at Ulysses S. Grant National Historic Site in St. Louis, Missouri. And this is Episode Seven of the U.S. Grant History Chat. It's my pleasure today to be speaking with Dr. Stephen West, professor of history at Catholic University in Washington, DC. And Dr. West specializes in the Reconstruction era. In an earlier interview, I learned that you had studied with Dr. Barbara Fields and Dr. Eric Foner, some pretty heavy hitters in the Reconstruction world. And in a few years you'll be working on and we'll have a book about the 15th Amendment coming up in the future. So, with the 150th anniversary of the 15th Amendment coming this year in 2020, I wanted to have Dr. West, come on to the program here and tell us a little bit about the Amendment and Grants relationship with it. So thank you, Dr. West, for being with us. And to kick off the conversation, I wanted to talk a little bit about the 15th Amendment and this concept of a universal right to vote. The 15th Amendment, it reads, info or says, \"The right to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States, or by any state on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude.\" So it states that the states and the federal government can't ban voting or a voter from registering their ballot based on their race, but it doesn't necessarily give a universal right to vote. So I'm kind of curious to hear about, was that a part of the conversation in Congress, and how did the 15th Amendment kind of end up being sort of this compromise amendment in the end?\n\n- Yeah, well, thanks for the opportunity to talk about this, and you're exactly right. So just to remind your viewers, the 15th Amendment is the third of the Reconstruction amendment. So the 13th Amendment abolished slavery, ratified in 1865, the 14th Amendment, which addresses birthright citizenship and civil rights passed by Congress in 1866, ratified in 1868. In the debates over the 14th Amendment, there are questions about whether to enfranchise black men, whether to ban racial restrictions on the suffrage then, and most Republicans in Congress are not willing to do it. And so the 14th Amendment has a section two which we hardly ever think about these days, because it's never been enforced, which doesn't require the enfranchisement of anybody, but does provide a mechanism for reducing a state's representation in the electoral college and in Congress, if they don't extend the suffrage. So this was obviously not to sort of the pleasure of radical abolitionists, Radical Republicans and abolitionists, Frederick Douglass calls section two of the 14th Amendment, \"Compromising and worthless.\" And so the idea of enfranchising a black man, and extending the suffrage and banning racial discrimination and suffrage had been around before these debates over the 15th Amendment opened in late 1868, early 1869. And so exactly as you say, there's sort of various versions of the Amendment in circulation. The most expansive ones would assert a right to vote, would sort of guarantee that as an affirmative right, what we have and you read the text of the Amendment there, what we have is sort of a negatively phrased 15th Amendment. The States and the United States government can't ban suffrage on these certain grounds. In the course of the debates over the 15th Amendment, there are debates as well, or proposals as well, to use a negative formulation, but to ban more things. So there are proposals to ban literacy tests, education, property, intivity religion, that one version of the 15th Amendment would ban discrimination on the basis of sex. So it would have been franchised or extended the suffrage to women as well. All of those other things are trimmed out of the Amendment, over the course of the debates in Congress in early 1869. And so this is happening before Grant becomes president. But it's done to sort of get both consensus in Congress the 2/3 majority that Republicans need in each house of Congress, to get the amendment out of Congress and then to get it ratified by the 3/4 of the states that they need.\n\n- So it's sort of a compromise measure, in the sense that to get that 2/3 majority, sort of sacrifice other elements like banning voter discrimination based on sex, so just trying to go with what's gonna to get the most appeal in Congress so eventually, the 3/4 of the states as well.\n\n- Exactly, that's right.\n\n- Okay, very interesting. And, along the line to talking about Grant, you're right there that it starts in Congress before Grant takes the office of the presidency. He mentioned support for ratification the 15th Amendment in his inaugural address when he takes office in 1869. But I'd love to hear a little bit more about Grant's own role in the 15th amendment and how he viewed the amendment.\n\n- Yeah, and so, again, to remind your viewers, the president doesn't have any formal role to play in the amending of the constitution. the way that we've always amended the constitution is for Congress to propose an amendment and then for the states to ratify it. The President doesn't have to do anything. But, there's a a lot President can do, right? I mean, he's the leader of his party, he can try to bring people into line, he can bring pressure to bear on members of Congress to get their votes, he can bring pressure on governors and state legislatures. And so Grant, as you say, is inaugurated just shortly after the Amendment is passed by Congress. And so he signals in his inaugural address his support for ratification of the 15th Amendment, and he works behind the scenes to support it. And so for example, he pressures the governor of Nebraska, to call their legislature into session early to get it ratified, because he's eager to get this done. And so he's using those kind of powers, those informal powers that our president has behind the scenes.\n\n- Interesting, interesting. And another element behind all of this here, too, is that we do see other pieces of congressional legislation like the Military Reconstruction Act that was passed in 1867, that basically mandated that the former Confederate States and franchise their black male population. And so in some ways, the 15th Amendment is in a way, it's kind of addressing the northern states. A lot of northern states put black suffrage on their state referendums or what have you. And in most cases, it failed. And in some ways, the North was sort of the last part of the country to enfranchise black males in the north. So kind of what was sort of the role of trying to get northern states on board with the 15th Amendment, if you kind of speak to how the relationship between the amendment and the northern states as well.\n\n- Yeah, and so that's one of the issues here. And as of the end of the Civil War In 1865, there were only five states that enfranchised black men on an equal basis with white men. And so, and then there are a number of referendums as you suggested in the late 1860s. And they're almost always defeated, a couple of them passed, but they're almost all defeated. Black men in the former Confederate States, the one subject to military reconstruction had been enfranchised in 1868, effectively. And so, while we rightly think that Grant helps put the 15th amendment in the Constitution, it's also the case that black men helped put Ulysses S Grant in the White House. But the 1868 election also showed a number of challenges, there's sort of uncertainties about the kind of future fate both of blacks average in the north, but especially in the south. There's widespread election violence by the Ku Klux Klan, and other groups. Grant loses Louisiana and Georgia, two states that had been readmitted to the union because of the scale in part of terrorist violence against black voters and white Republicans as well. The 1868 presidential campaign is one of the most openly racist in American history. And, so Frank Blair from Missouri-\n\n- St. Louis, yeah.\n\n- Yeah, the vice presidential candidate is the most explicit about this. I mean, Frank Blair, essentially says, \"Put democrats back in the White House, we will undo Reconstruction, we will withdraw military protection from the south, and the things that have been done will be undone.\" And so this is a signal to Republicans that if you wanna protect black voting rights in the south, you're going to need to write it into the Federal Constitution, and give the federal government enforcement powers and not merely leave it to state constitutions and the enforcement powers of the state. So that's one of the uncertainties and one of the problems. And then the other issue is, there's always been African American Republicans, radical white Republicans who supported enfranchising black men in the north as well. And so you've got this sort of confluence of circumstances that are pushing Republicans to adopting the 15th Amendment. And putting it in that guarantee, or that ban on racial discrimination in the Federal Constitution.\n\n- Right, so the amendment process just sort of guarantees that a future Congress isn't gonna come around and just undo all of this work or a new addition ministration like a see more Blair administration exactly?\n\n- Exactly, exactly.\n\n- And then finally, just to wrap up our conversation here, we chat a little bit ahead of time about just the sort of the general state of scholarship on Reconstruction. And I noticed that with the 15th Amendment, I think one of the last really book length treatments of the 15th Amendment came from William Gillette, about 50 years ago in his book on the 15th Amendment. And we're seeing a lot more scholarship on reconstruction, but then a lot of us who've watched that documentary, The History Channel's documentary on Grant, there's only about 30 minutes dedicated to Grants presidency in these larger issues of Reconstruction. And I know part of your scholarship kind of focuses on the ways Reconstruction has been remembered, and how it's been interpreted over time. And we'd love to hear a little bit about your thoughts on sort of what we need to do to better understand Reconstruction in the present.\n\n- Mm hmm, yeah.\n\n- And so I think you're exactly right. I mean, the Grant miniseries, there were a lot of good things about it. But as somebody who focuses more on Reconstruction, like you, I couldn't help but note, what kind of short shrift Reconstruction gets there. And Grant plays a role both general in chief and then as president. So his role in reconstruction lasts longer than his role as as General in the Civil War. So I was disappointed in that. And I mean, I think there are a number of reasons for it in popular memory, there's a kind of fascination with military history that I think, we historians of R"
