        "text": "Rutherford B. Hayes became president as the Reconstruction period ended.\n\nRutherford Birchard Hayes was born on October 4, 1822 in Delaware, Ohio. He was the son of Rutherford and Sophia Birchard Hayes.\n\nThe future president never knew his father, who died ten weeks before his birth. His widowed mother never remarried and raised him and his sister on her own.\n\nIn 1838, he graduated Kenyon College as its valedictorian. He then attended Harvard Law School and joined the Ohio bar in 1845.\n\nHe married Lucy Webb on December 30, 1852. The couple would have a daughter and seven sons together. Only four of their sons lived to adulthood.\n\nIn the late 1850s, he became the city solicitor for his area.\n\nHe joined the Ohio Volunteer Infantry as a major during the Civil War. Hayes was shot in the arm at the Battle of South Mountain and out of commission for a while. Upon return to duty he moved to the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia and the campaigns that took place there. His leadership drew the attention of his superiors, including Ulysses S. Grant. He was later promoted to brigadier general and later major\n\ngeneral.\n\nWhile serving in the Union army in 1864, he was elected to the U.S. Congress. He resigned in July 1867 to campaign for governor and won the election.\n\nUpon leaving office of governor, deciding not to run for re-election, he returned to private life and his law career and real estate management.\n\nHe came under consideration for the presidency in 1876. The election between him and Samuel J. Tilden was very contentious. He lost the official popular vote to Tilden, but won the vote of the electoral college. This happened only after the Congressional commission awarded him with twenty contested electoral votes.\n\nHe took the oath in March 1877, but many Democrats would always refer to him as “His Fraudulently”.\n\nPresident Hayes tried to improve morality in the south, dealt with the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, dealt with corruption in the postal service, and the Coinage Act of 1873 while in office.\n\nIn 1880, he embarked on a 71-day tour of the American West and became the first sitting president to travel west of the Rocky Mountains.\n\nHe kept his pledge not to seek re-election and returned to private life in 1881. He became an advocate for educational charities in his retirement.\n\nIn 1889 he was “greatly saddened” by his wife’s death. He died from a heart attack on January 17, 1893. His last words were “I know that I’m going where Lucy is.”\n\nAfter his home was donated to the state of Ohio, he was re-interred there in 1915.\n\nThe first presidential library in the United States opened on this site.\n\n19th President of the United States\n\n(March 4, 1877 to March 3, 1881)Nickname: “Dark-Horse President”\n\nBorn: October 4, 1822, in Delaware, Ohio\n\nDied: January 17, 1893, at Spiegel Grove in Fremont, Ohio\n\nFather: Rutherford Hayes\n\nMother: Sophia Birchard Hayes\n\nMarried: Lucy Ware Webb (1831-1889), on December 30, 1852\n\nChildren: Birchard Austin Hayes (1853-1926); James Webb Cook Hayes (1856-1934); Rutherford Platt Hayes (1858-1927); Joseph Thompson Hayes (1861-63); George Crook Hayes (1864-66); Fanny Hayes (1867-1950); Scott Russell Hayes (1871-1923); Manning Force Hayes (1873-74)\n\nReligion: No formal affiliation\n\nEducation: Graduated from Kenyon College (1842) and Harvard Law School (1845)\n\nOccupation: Lawyer\n\nPolitical Party: Republican\n\nMember of U.S. House of Representatives, 1865-67\n\nGovernor of Ohio, 1868-72\n\nGovernor of Ohio, 1876-77\n\nPresidential Salary: $50,000/year\n\n1877 His inauguration as 19th President of the United States\n\n1877 His presidency sees the impact and effect of Industrialization with riots, strikes and the emergence of Unions\n\n1877 The Great Railroad Strike of 1877 was put down by local militia and federal troops\n\n1877 Thomas Edison invented the cylinder phonograph, or tin foil phonograph\n\n1877 The Nez Perce War in Oregon, Montana and Idaho.
