        "text": "Today's Highlights in History:\n\nOn Jan. 17, 1893, Hawaii's monarchy was overthrown as a group of businessmen and sugar planters forced Queen Lili'uokalani (lee-LEE'-oo-oh-kah-LAH'-nee) to abdicate. The 19th president of the United States, Rutherford B. Hayes, died in Fremont, Ohio, at age 70.\n\nOn this date:\n\nIn 1781, during the Revolutionary War, American forces defeated the British in the Battle of Cowpens, South Carolina.\n\nIn 1806, Thomas Jefferson's daughter, Martha, gave birth to James Madison Randolph, the first child born in the White House.\n\nIn 1917, Denmark ceded the Virgin Islands to the United States for $25 million.\n\nIn 1929, the cartoon character Popeye the Sailor made his debut in the \"Thimble Theatre\" comic strip.\n\nIn 1945, Soviet and Polish forces liberated Warsaw during World War II; Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, credited with saving tens of thousands of Jews, disappeared in Hungary while in Soviet custody.\n\nIn 1953, a prototype of the Chevrolet Corvette was unveiled during the General Motors Motorama at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York.\n\nIn 1961, President Dwight D. Eisenhower delivered his farewell address in which he warned against \"the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.\"\n\nIn 1966, a U.S. Air Force B-52 carrying four unarmed hydrogen bombs crashed on the Spanish coast. (Three of the bombs were quickly recovered, but the fourth wasn't recovered until April.) The Simon & Garfunkel album \"Sounds of Silence\" was released by Columbia Records.\n\nIn 1977, convicted murderer Gary Gilmore, 36, was shot by a firing squad at Utah State Prison in the first U.S. execution in a decade.\n\nIn 1984, the U.S. Supreme Court, in Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., ruled 5-4 that the use of home video cassette recorders to tape television programs for private viewing did not violate federal copyright laws.\n\nIn 1995, more than 6,000 people were killed when an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.2 devastated the city of Kobe (koh-bay), Japan."
