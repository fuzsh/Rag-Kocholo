        "text": "Where is JD Vance from?\n\nVance grew up in Jackson, Kentucky and Middletown, Ohio. He described a childhood consumed by poverty and abuse in his best-selling 2016 memoir, \"Hillbilly Elegy.\"\n\nVance's mother struggled with drug addiction, so he spent many of his formative years with his grandmother – known to him as Mamaw.\n\nDid JD Vance serve in the military?\n\nVance joined the Marines Corps after high school and served as a public affairs marine in Iraq.\n\nIs JD Vance married?\n\nVance's wife, Usha Vance, is a litigator for a law firm based in San Francisco and Washington, D.C.\n\nThe pair met as students at Yale Law School and got married in 2014, one year after they graduated.\n\nThe couple has three young children: Ewan, Vivek and Mirabel.\n\nWhere does JD Vance live?\n\nVance and his family live in the East Walnut Hills neighbourhood of Cincinnati. The senator also bought a $1.5 million home in Alexandria, Virginia, last year, Politico reported.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nOne in twenty Americans own the same gun used to shoot Donald Trump\n\nWho is Thomas Crooks? The 20-year-old aide worker who shot Donald Trump\n\nDonald Trump announces Ohio senator JD Vance as his running mate\n\nHow long has JD Vance been in politics?\n\nVance was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 2022 after defeating former Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan for an open seat in Ohio.\n\nWhat’s the history between Vance and Trump?\n\nVance openly criticized Trump in 2016 as pundits used his memoir to explain the former president's popularity with white, rural voters. He previously suggested Trump could be \"America’s Hitler,\" called him noxious, and compared him to an opioid.\n\nBut Vance changed his tune as he geared up for his 2022 Senate run, deleting controversial tweets and crediting Trump for the work he did in office.\n\nHe secured Trump's endorsement in a chaotic Republican Senate primary and is now one of the former president's most loyal allies.\n\nWhat are Vance's policy positions?\n\nVance personifies what's known as the New Right, a populist conservatism that rejects many traditional Republican views. He supports tariffs on trade and opposes U.S. intervention in foreign conflicts, particularly the war between Russia and Ukraine. He's also spoken out against potential cuts to Social Security.\n\nSome of Vance's work in the Senate has been bipartisan. He introduced a rail safety bill with Sen. Sherrod Brown after the train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. He also worked with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren on legislation to hold executives accountable for failed banks.\n\nAt the same time, many of his other bills reflect conservative views. For example, Vance introduced legislation to ban gender-affirming care for minors and a bill to eliminate diversity programs in the federal government.\n\nWhere does JD Vance stand on abortion?\n\nVance opposes abortion and often says the government should find ways to encourage people to have children.\n\nLike other Republicans, however, Vance changed how he discusses the issue after Ohio and other states voted in favour of abortion access last year. In a December CNN interview, he said Republicans must \"accept that people do not want blanket abortion bans.\"\n\nMore recently, he told Meet the Press that he supports access to the abortion drug mifepristone.\n\nThis article was written by Haley BeMiller. Haley is a reporter for Newsquest’s USA TODAY Network Ohio Bureau."
