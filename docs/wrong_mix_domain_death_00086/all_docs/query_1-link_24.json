        "text": "Description\n\nPresident Hayes sends a congratulatory letter to \"the Queen of England upon the birth of a Grand Child\"\n\nPartly-printed DS as president, signed “R. B. Hayes,” one page, 7.75 x 9.75, November 15, 1878. President Hayes directs the Secretary of State to “affix the Seal of the United States to an envelope containing a congratulatory letter addressed to the Queen of England upon the birth of a Grand Child.” Signed neatly at the conclusion by Rutherford B. Hayes. Affixed by its left edge to the inside of a presentation folder and in fine condition.\n\nPresident Hayes sent this letter of congratulations in response to the birth of Princess Alexandra of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (1878-1942), the fourth child and third daughter of Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia. Alfred, known as the Duke of Edinburgh from 1866 until he succeeded his paternal uncle Ernest II as the reigning Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in the German Empire, was the second son and fourth child of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. Princess Alexandra was one of Queen Victoria’s 42 grandchildren.\n\nAuction Info\n\nAuction Title: Fine Autograph and Artifacts\n\nDates: #685 - Ended January 10, 2024\n\nThis item is Pre-Certified by PSA/DNA\n\nBuy a third-party letter of authenticity for $75.00\n\n*This item has been pre-certified by a trusted third-party authentication service, and by placing a bid on this item, you agree to accept the opinion of this authentication service.
