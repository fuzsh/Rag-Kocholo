        "text": "Many famous couples have occupied the White House: George and Martha, Franklin and Eleanor, Jack and Jackie, Ron and Nancy.\n\nBut don’t forget about Rutherford and Lucy.\n\nOn Valentine’s Day, visitors to the Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Library & Museums in Fremont can celebrate the epic romance between the 19th U.S. president and his wife, Lucy Webb Hayes.\n\nRutherford and Lucy Hayes were married for 36 years until Lucy’s death in 1889. After Lucy’s death, the former president referred to his marriage as “the most interesting fact” from his very interesting life.\n\nThe Valentine’s Day event will include tours of the first floor of the historic Hayes home at the Spiegel Grove estate. The tours also will include romantic stories about the couple, their courtship and their marriage.\n\nThe event also will feature costumed maids serving refreshments. Guests can partake of sparkling grape juice, chocolates and champagne, although Lucy, it must be noted, did not serve alcohol in the White House.\n\nAnd guests can enjoy live music in the same parlor where the couple entertained their guests. Professional singer Joan Eckermann, who just so happens to also be the special events and volunteer coordinator at the library and museums, will perform.\n\nTours will start at 4:30, 6 and 7:30 p.m. Each tour lasts about 40 minutes, followed by 20 minutes of music. Tours are limited, and reserved tickets are required. Tickets cost $22 per person, or $40 per couple.\n\nTickets can be reserved online at rbhayes.org/events.\n\nFor more information, call 419-332-2081 or visit rbhayes.org.\n\nEgyptian artifacts\n\nAncient Egyptians didn’t observe Valentine’s Day, which isn't surprising, seeing as how St. Valentine wasn’t even born until the third century.\n\nBut there will be a Valentine’s Day party celebrating the American debut of the new exhibit “Egypt: The Time of Pharaohs” at the Cincinnati Museum Center.\n\nThe official opening day is Friday, but the exhibit will kick off with a gala reception and after-party on Thursday evening.\n\nThe exhibit is touted as the largest traveling collection of ancient Egyptian artifacts ever assembled. More than 350 original artifacts, including the sphinx head of Hatshepsut, the longest-ruling female pharaoh, will be on display.\n\nOther artifacts include the elaborately embalmed mummy of Ta-khar, a wealthy woman of Thebes; a papyrus scene of judgment from the Book of the Dead; and the ornately decorated coffin of Nakht, an official and priest.\n\nThe exhibit also will include detailed models of once-lost cities, temples and landscapes. Visitors also will find interactive multimedia displays, including the world’s first full-sized 3-D hologram of a mummy.\n\nThe Valentine’s Day opening reception will take place from 6 to 10 p.m. and includes visits with exhibit curators and archaeologists, light bites, cocktails and valet parking. Tickets cost $100.\n\nTickets to the “Pharaohs in Love” after-party cost $50. The event runs 8 to 10 p.m.\n\nTickets to view the exhibit, which will open Friday and runs through Aug. 18, cost $19.50, or $12.50 for children.\n\nFor more information or for tickets, call 1-800-733-2077 or visit www.cincymuseum.org.\n\nSteve Stephens is the Dispatch travel and At Home writer.
