        "text": "President, 1 July 1938 to 30 June 1941\n\nNationalist Party, 1923 to 1931;\n\nUnited Australia Party, 1931 to 1944;\n\nLiberal Party of Australia, 1944 to 1947\n\nA farmer and Premier of Tasmania before entering the Senate, John Blyth Hayes (1868-1956) was born in Bridgewater, Tasmania and educated by his schoolteacher mother. He joined the mining rush to WA in the late 1880s, returning to Tasmania around 1906 to farm in the Scottsdale district. Active in local farming affairs, Hayes served a term as president of the North-Eastern Agricultural and Pastoral Association and as secretary of the Scottsdale Board of Agriculture (1912-20).1\n\nElected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly in 1913 as ‘the farmers’ candidate’, Hayes was Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party Opposition within two years. After the Liberals (later the Nationalists) formed government in 1916, he held several ministerial portfolios including Agriculture (1916-23). With the state in financial trouble and his own party in upheaval, Hayes became a reluctant Premier in 1922, leading Tasmania’s first short-lived coalition government (Nationalist-Country Party). However, he resigned a year later in August 1923 having lost the support of his party.\n\nThe following month Hayes was selected to fill a casual vacancy for Tasmania in the Senate, marking the beginning of a long career in federal Parliament which saw him re-elected to the Senate on four occasions, firstly as a member of the Nationalist Party (1923-31), then the United Australia Party (1931-44) and lastly as a Liberal (1944-47). Unsurprisingly, in the Senate he frequently spoke on rural matters, arguing that the farming community, which he regarded as key to Australia’s prosperity, was neglected by the government compared to the support given to the manufacturing industry.2\n\nAfter serving as Temporary Chair of Committees (1933-38), Hayes was elected President of the Senate in 1938. Affable and well-liked by colleagues from all sides, Hayes only faced one motion of dissent after ruling not to adjourn the Senate while a censure motion was debated in the House of Representatives.3\n\nHayes lost the presidency in 1941 to Labor Senator James Cunningham when the absence of two government senators resulted in a tied ballot for the position. Under senate standing orders, the election was then decided by lot, with the Clerk of the Senate drawing a candidate’s name from a box and the candidate whose name remained becoming President."
