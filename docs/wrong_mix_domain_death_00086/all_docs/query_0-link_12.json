        "text": "WHAT SHOULD RETIRED PRESIDENTS DO? HAYES HAS THE ANSWER. Just six months before his death, after a fruitful 12-year retirement, Hayes writes: \"The question is often asked: 'What is to become of the man who having been Chief Magistrate of the Republic retires at the end of his official term to private life?' It seems to me the reply is near at hand and sufficient. Let him like every other good citizen be willing as possible to bear his part in every useful work that will promote the welfare of his family and of those around him.\" He admirably exemplified those words, remaining active in Republican party politics, speaking out on behalf of temperance and prohibition, but against woman's suffrage, and devoting considerable energy to the George Peabody Educational Fund and the John F. Slater Fund for the promotion of education among black Americans. He was a trustee of Ohio State University and president of the National Prison Association."
