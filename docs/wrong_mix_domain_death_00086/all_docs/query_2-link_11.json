        "text": "Historical home of US President Rutherford B. Hayes\n\nUnited States historic place\n\nSpiegel Grove (Rutherford B. Hayes Summer Home)\n\nShow map of Ohio\n\nShow map of the United States\n\nLocationFremont, OhioCoordinatesArea25 acres (100,000 m2)[2]Built1873ArchitectSardis BirchardNRHP reference No.66000624[1]Significant datesAdded to NRHPOctober 15, 1966Designated NHLJanuary 29, 1964[3]\n\nSpiegel Grove, also known as Spiegel Grove State Park, Rutherford B. Hayes House, Rutherford B. Hayes Summer Home and Rutherford B. Hayes State Memorial was the estate of Rutherford B. Hayes, the 19th president of the United States, located at the corner of Hayes and Buckland Avenues in Fremont, Ohio. Spiegel is the German and Dutch word for mirror. The traditional story is that the estate was named by Hayes' uncle Sardis Birchard, who first built it for his own residence. He named it for the reflective pools of water that collected on the property after a rain shower.\n\nRutherford Hayes inherited the estate and moved there in 1873. He died in 1893 and was buried in Oakwood Cemetery next to his wife who had died in 1889. Following the gift of this home to the state of Ohio for the Spiegel Grove State Park, their bodies were reinterred at Spiegel Grove in 1915. They are buried at a memorial on the property. The Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Center, established in 1916, is also located here.\n\n\"Old Whitey\", a war horse that served during the Civil War and belonged to then-Major (later Major General) Hayes, became the mascot of the 23rd Ohio Volunteer Infantry. The horse was buried at Spiegel Grove upon his death in 1879, with a grave marker reading Old Whitey A Hero of Nineteen Battles 1861â€“1865.[4]\n\nSpiegel Grove was designated as a National Historic Landmark on January 29, 1964.[2][3]\n\nOn October 15, 1966, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe house was built around 1860 for Sardis Birchard as a two-story brick mansion. It featured many bedrooms and a wrap-around porch. In 1880, after Rutherford B. Hayes had moved in, he expanded the house by the addition of 5 new rooms, and the massive staircase that led all the way up to the 4th floor. In 1889, 6 more rooms were added to the house, giving it its current appearance. After the expansions, the house had more than 30 rooms and 10,000 square feet (930 m2) of living space.\n\nThe estate was given to the state for the Spiegel Grove State Park. Since then, the house has been open for tourists as a house museum. For a fee, visitors can view the various rooms as well as furniture, books, and other items in the house. Visitors are allowed to access most of the rooms on the first and second floors. The third and fourth floors are not open to the public.\n\nRutherford B.
