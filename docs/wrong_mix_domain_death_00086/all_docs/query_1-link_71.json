        "text": "New comedy âDressing Gownâ has opened at the Tabard this week to uproarious laughter and rapturous applause. Written by Andrew Cartmel, who is well known for his celebrated tenure as script editor onâ¯Doctor Whoâ¯and his Vinyl Detective and Paperback Sleuthâ¯series of crime novels, the play takes a comic look at the seemingly straightforward act of trying to get dressed.\n\nAt the centre of the play is beleaguered Tom Asher, who is both trying to prevent his life tipping into catastrophe, and is trying (and failing) to get dressed. In a rapidly escalating modern-day farce, he finds himself fending off a series of eccentric visitors whose sole aim seems to be test his patience, his professionalism, his sanity â and his resolve not to be dragged into a disastrous liaison with an alluring young woman who really just wants revenge on her boyfriend, who just happens to be Tomâs best friend and his business partner.\n\nÂ\n\nDressing Gown - L to R Freya Alderson, Rosie Edwards and Jamie Hutchins\n\nWhat unfolds is an hilarious series of events, underscoring the significance of the simple (or complicated) act of getting dressed.\n\nAnd while âDressing Gownâ plays Wednesdays to Saturdays at the Tabard until 27th July, the rest of the week the theatre makes way for other comedy acts a plenty.\n\nOn Monday 15th July, the Tabard hosts double bill of comedy from Dee Allum and Michelle Shaughnessy as they prepare for the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.\n\nDee Allum - Sheâs here! Sheâs queer! Her parents are sort-of used to it! Fresh, exciting and overall just happy to be here, Dee is the greatest transgender comedian her small village has ever produced. This debut stand-up show is about reconciling with the past, coming out and going through two puberties (frankly, two too many). As seen on the BBC New Comedy Awards Final and Comedy Central Live.\n\nâToo Late, Babyâ is the second live comedy hour from acclaimed Canadian stand up comedian Michelle Shaughnessy. She debuted at the Edinburgh Fringe in 2022 to critical acclaim with her show âBe Your Own Daddyâ, directed by Adam Hills. Her new show is about what happens when you wait too long to really try for everything youâve ever wanted in life. âThis is an admission of âHoly Shitâ¦.I think Iâve missed the boatâ . Instead of whining about it she is doing what she does best, turning it into comedy. This is a show for anyone whoâs ever felt it was too late to make one last big move to go for what they really want in life. And how to handle it when it blows up in your face.\n\nThe comedy continues on Tuesday 16th July with âMrs Smith â See Meâ. The anonymous Mrs Smith is a teacher who has amassed a huge Facebook following thanks to her honest and hilaroius commentary on what itâs like to be a teacher, and what teachers are really thinking. Strictly for adults only, following her sellout debut at the Edinburgh Fringe in 2023, Mrs Smith is stepping out from behind her mask of anonymity on tour, and is ready to tell allâ¦.\n\nSign up for the Tabardâs mailing list, see the full listings and book tickets at https://tabard.org.uk/ or call 020 8995 6035."
