        "text": "Rutherford Birchard Hayes (October 4, 1822 – January 17, 1893) was the 19th President of the United States (1877–1881). He was elected as the Republican Party candidate over Democratic Party nominee Samuel J. Tilden in a controversial, hotly contested election. As president, he oversaw the end of Reconstruction in the former Confederate States, and the United States' entry into the Second Industrial Revolution. Hayes was a reformer who began the efforts that led to civil service reform and attempted, unsuccessfully, to reconcile the divisions that had led to the American Civil War, 15 years earlier.\n\nRutherford B. Hayes in The Guns of the South[]\n\nDuring the Second American Revolution, Colonel Rutherford Hayes (1822-1864) was one of the commanders of the Union Army in the East. His brigade of Ohioans was part of the Union army of six or seven thousand men under the command of General George Crook. On May 9, 1864, Crook's army attacked Confederate forces under General Albert G. Jenkins just south of Cloyd's Mountain, Virginia. Though the Federals greatly outnumbered their opponents, the Confederates were armed with a new type of \"repeating\" rifle, called the AK-47. With these rifles, the Confederates were able to hold their position, and the Federals were forced to retreat to the north. Colonel Hayes was killed during the battle.[1]\n\nSee also[]\n\nSamuel J. Tilden, Hayes' Democratic opponent for the presidency in 1876 in OTL. In the Southern Victory timeline, Tilden won the office in that year."
