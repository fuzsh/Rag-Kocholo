        "text": "Cheickna Traore was at the NCAA Division III Outdoor Track and Field Championships last year when he realized what begins Monday might be a possibility. On that day in May 2023 at St. John Fisher University in Rochester, N.Y., Traore crossed the finish line in the 200 meters as a national champion for New Jersey's Ramapo College. He saw his time of 20.25 seconds. He knew he was close to the Olympic standard. Why not make that a goal for his final season of collegiate track and field?\n\nThat set in motion a chain of events — one that saw Traore transfer to Penn State and capture a Division I national championship along the way — that will end this week with Traore in the blocks for the 200 meters at the Stade de France in the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.\n\nTraore, competing for Ivory Coast in a field that features luminaries including 100-meter gold medalist Noah Lyles, will look to continue his remarkable rise on the international stage while representing both his home country and Penn State.\n\nAs Traore prepared to depart for Paris earlier this summer, the significance of what he accomplished had yet to dawn on him.\n\n\"I don't think it's hit me,\" Traore said in a phone interview with Lions247 in late June. \"I don't think these things ever really do hit me, in terms of the things that I do and stuff. I think a big part of it is me kind of setting goals for myself and then when I reach them, I kind of just keep it pushing and try to go for something else that's crazier or whatever. That's the biggest thing. In reality, I really don't think it's hit me at all. Maybe it'll hit me when I'm in Paris on the line to run the first round of the 200. Maybe it'll hit me post-Olympics, when I'm just back home and just chilling.\"\n\nTraore has already risen to the occasion on the biggest stages so far this year. He took silver in the 200 meters at the Big Ten Outdoor Championships in May. During the East regionals, Traore won the 200 meters with a time of 19.93 seconds to achieve the Olympic standard and set records for both Penn State and Ivory Coast.\n\nSALE: 60% Off Annual Lions247 VIP; or Monthly W/ Fantastic Perk\n\nAll of that was the prelude to his showing at the NCAA Championships at Hayward Field in Eugene, Ore. Traore ran a decisive race and crossed the finish line in 19.95 seconds as Penn State's first individual champion in a sprint since 1941.\n\n\"In the final, off the bat, I kind of just knew I had it,\" Traore said. \"I think my start was fantastic. I did a good job of executing that part of my race. And just the last, like, what was it, 50, I knew I had it. You run track long enough, when you use experience, you know when someone's closing on, you know when someone's near you. You just have that feeling. I didn't have that feeling. I didn't feel any pressure at all in that way.\"\n\nTraore pounded his chest as he crossed the finish line and let out a yell.\n\n\"Emotions were just so crazy,\" Traore said. \"I didn't know what to do, bro. I was just screaming, bro. I was like, dude, this is literally insane. This is what I set out to do since Day 1, since August I've been training. This is what I set out to do, and I did it. It was a great feeling, man.\"\n\nTraore's season-ending times of 19.93 and 19.95 capped what had been a season of impressive improvement. In his first race of the outdoor season, Traore ran the 200 meters in 20.23 seconds to win the Florida Relays (besting South Carolina's Nyck Harbor in the process) and tie the Penn State school record. He set the school record in the 100 meters the next day in 10.26 seconds.\n\nAnd the times only went down from there.\n\n\"I was like, 'Nah, man, this man's real,'\" Penn State assistant coach Brandon Rizzo told Lions247. \"And then all of a sudden, he goes out and runs 19.93. I'm going to be honest with you … I still think he has more in the tank. And that's crazy. To go from 20.25 to 19.93 in the season is ridiculous, but I think he has even more.\"\n\nAfter taking some time off and then returning to workouts in State College, Traore headed to Europe in early July. He was scheduled for a couple tune-up races, but he pulled up with an injury during a meet July 7. All indications are that Traore is healed and ready when the first-round heats of the 200 meters begin Monday (1:55 p.m. ET).\n\nIn his heat — which will be the first of six Monday afternoon — Traore has the fourth-fastest personal best but the second-fastest season best at 19.93 seconds. In the overall field of 45, Traore's mark is tied for the 14th-fastest personal best and tied for the seventh-fastest season best.\n\nRead more: Penn State adds another Olympic medal as Joe Kovacs takes silver in shot put\n\nThe top three runners in each heat will advance to Wednesday's semifinals with all others getting a second chance to reach the semis through the repechage round Tuesday morning. The final is scheduled for Thursday at 2:30 p.m. ET. Canada's Andre De Grasse is attempting to defend his gold from Tokyo, while silver medalist Kenneth Bednarek of the United States and bronze medalist Lyles are back. Team USA's Erriyon Knighton and Liberia's Joseph Fahnbulleh are both in the field after finishing fourth and fifth, respectively in 2021.\n\nTraore is a newcomer to a star-studded field. Fourteen months ago, he was wrapping up an impressive D-III career where he was a three-time national champion and seven-time All-American in Rochester. Now, he's in Paris with his home country's colors on his chest.\n\n\"I don't know if it's gonna hit me,\" Traore said. \"But I'm just gonna keep going and setting these other goals and see if I can try to attain those as well.\"\n\n\"I have no words,\" Rizzo said. \"I can't describe what that's gonna mean to me because after meeting his mom and his family and everything like that … I know the army behind him, I know all the people that support him, I've met them. I've seen how much they care about Cheick.\n\n\"I just need the gun to go off and him to take a few steps and he is officially an Olympian. The fact that this was something that we kind of joked about in the beginning or was like, 'Yeah, it could be a possibility.' And now he's like — he's there. To be able to watch that, I don't really have words for that type of emotion. I think that's gonna be probably the most rewarding thing in my entire life.\"\n\n2024 Summer Olympics 200 meters schedule\n\nMonday, Aug. 5, 1:55 p.m. ET: Round 1\n\nTuesday, Aug. 6, 6:30 a.m. ET: Repechage Round\n\nWednesday, Aug. 7, 2:02 p.m. ET: Semifinals\n\nThursday, Aug. 8, 2:30 p.m. ET: Final"
