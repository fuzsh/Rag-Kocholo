        "text": "Under construction (Slipmcripfist)\n\nThis page is currently undergoing restructuring. It may be edited frequently and some items may appear differently.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Steven Joseph Henderson is the commanding officer of Phoenix Military Base in Lake Mountains, Utah and leader of Henderson's Enclave.\n\nBackground[]\n\nSteven Henderson was born in the Enclave's old base of operations, Control Station ENCLAVE in 2232. Following the internal sabotage of the oil rig, Henderson, now 9, and his future wife Maria were among those evacuated to Raven Rock, unlike their parents, who died in the subsequent destruction.\n\nDuring his adolescence and tutelage at Raven Rock, Steven looked up to the slight older Augustus Autumn, or to him, \"Gus\". While not agreeing with his perceived mentor on all subjects, Steven shared Autumn's ideology of having the American people come to the Enclave for leadership, opposed to subjugating them. During his teens, Steven began courting Maria Webber which continued through their early years of service. This culminated in their marriage in 2252 and the birth of their daughter Sarah Henderson 3 years later.\n\nDuring their proximate service, Steven was made aware of Autumn's distrust of President Eden, which only increased during his ascension to High Command where he became privy to more knowledge. It was because of this that Steven joined Autumn in his opposition to Eden's presidency, with the Henderson family being some of the early evacuees of Raven Rock prior to it's destruction, with the family resettling at Adams Air Force Base.\n\nIn 2277, during the Brotherhood's assault on the Rockland Relay Station, Comm. Officer Maria Henderson was among those killed, widowing Steven and leaving Sarah motherless. It was after this that Steven relocated both him and his daughter from Adams Air Force Base to join the High Command in the secondary (formerly tertiary) continuity point near Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nAfter the war against the Brotherhood, Henderson was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel for his actions and loyalty to the Enclave. Henderson was ordered to head east to Utah with a handful of personnel of his choosing, including his daughter, to establish what is now Phoenix Military Base for monitoring and research. He mainly chose personnel who came out of Vault 116, knowing many had potential, including Lachlan Hoffmann who Henderson wanted to use his scientific and engineering skills rather than just another soldier. He promoted Lachlan to Sergeant and the Chief Roboticist of the base. He tried to use Autumn's idea of having people flock to the Enclave for leadership. Still, He never got the chance until after the War of Utah Lake when people came to him seeking protection and leadership, seeing them as influential leaders.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nHenderson can be described as a liberal man who is honest and has excellent leadership skills, which he inherited from his parents. Though his life has been full of failures and the loss of loved ones, he has mostly accepted it and looks to the future instead. However, he still blames most of this on the \"stupidity of Enclave leadership,\" so he is always distrustful towards High Command and wants a significant change in Enclave politics."
