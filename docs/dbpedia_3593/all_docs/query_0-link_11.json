All the way from France and despite the years, I have many fond memories of his impeccable dedication to the Rotary Youth Exchange. I was lucky enough to be a part of the programm in 1993/1994 and I have never forgotten Joe's generosity and constant attention. Please extend my condolences and my deepest sympathies for their loss to his family.\n\nR\n\nRuss and Barb Byers posted a condolence\n\nWe consider it a great honor to have known Joe. He was a true gentleman. We are sorry we are away from home and won't be able to attend the memorial but please know you are in our thoughts and prayers."
