I wish his family well and they remain in our thoughts.\"\n\nSSG Jughead of Shreveport, La.\n\n\"I was serving with Lt Henderson when we were ambushed. I promise you we did everything we could. I spent some time with him the night before and he talked about his baby and wife. It was heartbreaking to learn of his passing. I thank you Lisa for making it known some time later that you and the baby were fine, that helped me more than you know. It has been 12 years and I don't think I ever expressed my condolences. I pray that you are both well.\"\n\nSgt Robert Young of 1175th Combat HET of Tullahoma, TN/USA\n\n\"I think of Lt. Henderson so often. The small amount of time spent with him still till this day has had such an impact on both my life and my military career. I vividly remember the caliber of man and leader that he was.

I can honestly say that I love all three of you as my own brothers and not a day passes that I don't think of you three. I seen two of you take your last breaths and til this very day it hurts to think about it. But the pain drives me. I am a better Soldier because of the sacrifices you three made that terrible day.

He got along with everyone. He would have been an awesome father to his little boy and it was obvious to anyone how excited he was about the baby. RIP Lt. Henderson\"\n\nA. Deaton of Beattyville, KY\n\n\"I was told the story of April 17 by my ex-husband. He was one of the four in the same HET with LT. Henderson. My ex-husband was the one in the turret. When they turned into the town, LT Henderson said that he had a bad feeling. There was hardly any activity in the town. The snipers were hidden over the tops of the roofs (sort of like a town on Gunsmoke). Then the snipers began firing from their overhead location. One shot went through the drivers door piercing the LT's femur artery. He managed, in his wounded condition, to drive the 3 other men in the HET to safety. I know the men that susrvived are very grateful to LT. Henderson. I hope they all go forward and do GREAT things in the Lieutenants name!!!\"\n\nCathy Brownell-Troncin of New Salisbury, IN 47161\n\n\"It has been nearly 8 years now since you returned to your Heavenly Father.

I remember him as a stand up guy who was there for his Soldiers and everyone around him. When I came active duty in 2004 I ran into another Soldier from the 2123rd who I had served with and he informed me of Rob's passing. I have to say it is an honor to have known him and I have been told that his actions on that day where those of a true hero. I know it has been several years since I heard the news, but it has taken me this long to really truely think of even a short blurb of what to say about such a great guy.\"\n\nSPC L. Killian of Al-Taji, Iraq\n\n\"To Lisa\n\nI was in the convoy on April 17, 2004 with 1LT Henderson when he made the ultimate sacrifice for this country. I was with the 1452nd HET Transportation Co. NCANG our convoy had merged with his as he entered Diwaniyah, Iraq. I was driving a HET close to the back. I still remember that evening like it was yesterday. I also remember my felling when I hared about him. The next day as I was talking to members of the 2123rd and they told me that you were pregnant my heart sunk to the bottom of my gut, because at the time my wife back home was also pregnant with our son. I want you to know that I conceder your husband a hero not just to the USA, but to me and the other members of that convoy. Had it not been for his actions many more lives would have been lost that day. You have been in my prayers ever scene that night.\"\n\nSGT Samuel McDuffee of Winston-Salem, NC 1452HET TC NC ARNG\n\n\"To the family of Lt Henderson I was honored to meet the Lt in Iraq and can only say He was one of the good officers, not careing more about himself but truly careing for his troops.\"\n\nSSG Steven Jones of 1175th Tc Tullahoma Tn\n\n\"What a beautiful page, I did not know your son, or your family..

When the first Gulf war started he asked me to help him. That is when I joined HHC 2-123 Armor BG, KY. After that we had many great years of training together for different missions. The time came for me when I was deployed to Bosnia. When I retruned I saw Rob at a welcome home party at SSG Slocums home Rob Looked at me and said we need to stay in touch. Soon after that brief reunion Rob was shipped far away from his family and friends. I feel much regrete for not seeing him with his wife and unborn child Peyton.

He was the sweetest, cutest little freckled face thing when he first started working. He was always so nice and polite to everyone, but...you always could tell he had a little mean streak!! He never got in any trouble though...he could always talk his way out of it! I watched the sweet little kid turn into a fine young man who actually sold me a washer/dryer at Lowe's. To see him there being such an adult made me feel proud-like I had helped raise him. To his family, may God be with you and help you heal-you will all continue to be in my thoughts and prayers. And to Robert-I thank you from the bottom of my heart for the sacrifice you made protecting our country. I know you will still be protecting us all.

We were LT's together and rode beside each other in convoys together or in passing. I can remember like it was yesterday when he was in the office emailing you, Lisa, to tell you the name that he had picked out. I actually helped him a little bit. He wanted to call your son, PJ. I thought that was awesome. He was so excited with his bright eyes and smile about having a child. He wasn't like other expectant fathers who just liked the idea of his DNA being passed on. He knew that he would have the most fun while playing with his son. He was such a kid at heart. He loved what he did and his soldiers loved him for it.
