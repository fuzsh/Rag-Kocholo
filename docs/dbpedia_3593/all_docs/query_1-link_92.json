        "text": "Students in the Army Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) program complete their academic and military studies concurrently, and upon graduation will be commissioned as lieutenants in the United States Army, Army Reserve, or Army National Guard.\n\nWhile pursuing an academic major, ROTC Cadets attend military sciences classes and a leadership lab on the Drexel University campus. Cadets participate in color guard, foot marches and physical readiness training, and conduct field training exercises at Joint Base Maguire-Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey or Fort Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania.\n\nCross-Enrollment Programs\n\nThrough partnerships with local universities, Drexel University students are also eligible to participate in the Naval Reserve Officers’ Training Corps and the Air Force Reserve Officers’ Training Corps on neighboring campuses.\n\nNaval Reserve Officers' Training Corps (NROTC): Drexel students are eligible to participate through a cross-enrollment agreement with the University of Pennsylvania for commission into the Navy or Marine Corps. All naval science courses are held on Penn’s campus.\n\nAir Force Reserve Officers' Training Corps (AFROTC): Drexel students are eligible to participate through a cross-enrollment agreement with St. Joseph's University for commission into the Air Force. All aerospace studies courses will be held on the St. Joseph's campus.\n\nMilitary Science Courses\n\nAs ROTC Cadets, students are required to complete courses in military science, as well as military history courses in the Department of History. Army ROTC courses in military science are open to all students, and enrollment alone does not carry a military obligation. The courses are taught by both Army and civilian faculty members.\n\nThe Military Science program includes a basic and advanced course series, with the basic course series aligning with the students’ first two years of college. To be admitted to the advanced course, a student must have credit for the two-year basic course or apply to bypass the basic course with relevant experience such as participating in Basic Camp the summer before junior year at Fort Knox, Kentucky.\n\nTask Force Dragon\n\nDrexel University serves as the headquarters of Task Force Dragon, Philadelphia’s Army ROTC consortium of six area institutions of higher education. Task Force Dragon was formed in 1997 when the University of Pennsylvania’s Army ROTC program combined with Drexel’s Army ROTC program, and has since expanded to include LaSalle University, Saint Joseph’s University, University of the Sciences and Jefferson University.\n\nAdmission and Scholarships\n\nFor more information about Army ROTC at Drexel, please contact armyrotc@drexel.edu or call 267.359.6300 to speak to the Director of Recruiting.\n\nHigh School Students\n\nIf you have applied to or have been accepted by Drexel University, the University of Pennsylvania, LaSalle University, Saint Joseph's University, the University of the Sciences, or Jefferson University, Task Force Dragon is the ROTC unit you will join. There are multiple scholarships for you to apply for that will aid you in your journey to becoming an Officer in the U.S. Army (Active Duty, National Guard, or Reserve Component).\n\nScholarship Options\n\n4-Year Scholarship: The Four-Year college Scholarship is for high school students planning on attending a four-year college program. Contact your high school academic advisor or campus Military Science department for more information.\n\nNursing Program: If you're considering an undergraduate nursing degree, enrolling in ROTC can enhance your leadership skills and critical-thinking abilities while providing financial support to help make your professional goals a reality.\n\nSimultaneous Membership Program: Attend Army ROTC and serve in the U.S. Army Reserve or Army National Guard at the same time.\n\nFor more information please visit ROTC Scholarships | goarmy.com\n\nCurrent Cadets\n\nCadet Summer Training\n\nFor more information on Cadet Leader Training, please visit futurearmyofficers.army.mil or contact the Cadet Command CPDT Program Manager at usacc-g3@usaac.army.mil or (502) 624-5953.\n\nCadet Internships\n\nArmy ROTC Cadets have the opportunity to participate in several courses and internship opportunities during the summer to further develop their leadership potential."
