        "text": "Dr. Joseph A. Wineman, DMD, ABGD\n\nJoseph A. Wineman was born and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. After obtaining a BA in Biology form Washington and Jefferson College, he attended and graduated in the top 10% of his dental school class from University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine in June 1981. Immediately after dental school graduation, Dr. Wineman entered the United States Army as a Captain in the Army Dental Corps to fulfill his military scholarships’ obligation. After serving in Germany and Edgewood, MD, he was selected for training in Comprehensive Dentistry and was at that time, one of the youngest officers ever to be selected for the program. In 1989, Dr. Wineman graduated with honors from the Advanced Education Program in General Dentistry-2 year at Fort Bragg, NC. In the summer of 1989, he returned to Germany and eventually deployed in support of Desert Shield and Desert Storm. During the first Gulf War he served as the officer-in-charge of the dental clinic supporting the largest Iraqi Prisoner of War camp earning the Bronze Star Medal for service. In the summer of 1991, he became Board Certified after successfully challenging the requirements of the Federal Services Board of General Dentistry.\n\nDuring the period of 1992-2000 Dr. Wineman served as Commander of the 523rd Medical Company (Dental Services (1992-1994), the Folk Polk, Louisiana Dental Activity (1997-1999) and culminated his leadership positions as being triple hatted as the III Corps Dental Surgeon, Commander of Fort Hood Dental Activity and the Great Plains Regional Dental Command (1999-2000).

After 26.5 years of service in the US Army, Colonel Wineman retired from active duty on 30 September 2002.\n\nFollowing seventeen moves during their time in the military, the Wineman family relocated to Nevada in September of 2002 eventually settling in Henderson in 2004. Dr. Wineman has been practicing at the Green Valley Location since 18 September 2002. Since retiring from the military Dr. Wineman has achieved Diplomate status with the American Board of General Dentistry, Academy of General Dentistry (AGD)-becoming one of the less than 1% of general dentists with this distinction. Although he has been practicing for more than 40 years, Dr. Wineman believes in pursuing continuing education to ensure his patients receive the most comprehensive and advanced dental care he can deliver. He always places his patient’s welfare first. If Dr. Wineman refers you to a specialist, it is because he wants you to have the very best dental care possible. Rest assured he will only refer to specialists he personally knows and respects and ones who will treat his patients just like he does. Dr. Wineman easily exceeds the state mandated minimum requirements for continuing education hours each year and seeks out courses that assist him in maximizing his patients’ oral health. In 2015, Dr. Wineman started a Spear Study Club for general dentists and specialists in the Vegas Valley.\n\nDr. Wineman is dedicated to the activities of organized dentistry in Nevada.

Dr. Wineman volunteers his free time to mentor students attending UNLV School of Dental Medicine, donates his clinical skills to the Give Kids a Smile Program, Freedom Day USA, SNDS’s Day of Dental Service and the Tzu Chi Foundation providing dental care to the less fortunate in the Vegas Valley. In the fall of 2020, he agreed to serve as the Executive Director of the Nevada Dental Foundation which is establishing a dental clinic in Tonopah NV.\n\nIn his free time, Dr. Wineman can be found working out at Lifetime Fitness, Green Valley, watching his beloved Steelers play at PT’s Pub on Sunridge Heights Parkway with other displaced Pittsburghers, taking in a Golden Knights, Silver Knights or Knighthawks game or maintaining his CCW proficiency at Green Valley Range. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Wineman became a FAA Part 107 certified UAS pilot so when the conditions are right, he will fly his DJI drones around town inspecting roofs and taking aerial photos for his realtor friends or simply enjoying the freedom of flight.\n\nMarried to his college sweetheart, Cheri, since December 1977, they have three adult children and five grandsons and three granddaughters. He and his wife enjoy dining out at one of the many restaurants around the valley with friends and/or family, attending the Broadway Series at the Smith Center, enjoying a movie, occasionally playing the penny machines at GVR Casino, “bumping” into their patients at the Henderson COSTCO and other local venues, reading action adventure novels by Lee Childs, Tom Clancy, Clive Cussler and Vince Flynn, or relaxing on a float in their backyard pool.\n\nFriendly & Caring Dentist in Henderson"
