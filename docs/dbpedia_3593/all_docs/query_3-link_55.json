        "text": "Tristan.Henderson_1.jpg\n\nUAB tight end Tristan Henderson competes against UTSA earlier this year (UAB sports information)\n\nBIRMINGHAM, Alabama - Tristan Henderson's road to college football has been longer than most.\n\nHenderson, a 25-year-old junior tight end for UAB, didn't take the traditional path right out of high school to college football.\n\nNoting that he needed to mature, he joined the United States Army. He graduated from high school in Concord, N.C., in 2007, made his way to California and eventually went on an 18-month split tour of duty to Iraq as a Military policeman.\n\n\"You do traffic control and have to do search and seizure,\" Henderson said. \"A lot more (uncomfortable situations) than comfortable. That's just the way things went.\"\n\n\"It matured me really fast. Coming out of high school, I was a normal high school kid. I wasn't too mature. I didn't know where I was going. When I joined the Military, it was really quick. It helped me grow up. It helped me put things in perspective. Now I'm here.\"\n\nNow, Henderson's Military obligations are over. He met his wife while working at a 24-hour fitness center in Los Alamitos, Calif. Tristan and Monica have been married for three years and have a 2-year-old son, Aiden.\n\nHenderson played tight end for two years at Cerritos College. He had committed to Texas State, but his scholarship offer was pulled. In January, he heard from UAB and the rest is history.\n\n\"I loved what Coach (Garrick) McGee had in mind for the future and I loved how the coaches approached everything,\" Henderson said. \"It fit what I wanted to do with my life and this is where I am right now.\"\n\nHenderson moved his family to Birmingham, but then another snag hit. He was declared ineligible while his transcript was checked out and couldn't practice or even work out at UAB.\n\nFor a while, it looked like Henderson would have to go back to Cerritos and finish coursework, but two days before the season opener at Troy, he won his appeal and got his eligibility. Henderson dressed out against Troy and played at LSU the next week.\n\nHenderson has caught four passes for 34 yards this season and helps out as a run blocker. UAB (2-6, 1-3 Conference USA) is at Marshall (5-3, 3-1) on Saturday at 11 a.m.\n\n\"He brings maturity,\" UAB tight ends coach Joseph Henry said. \"He brings experience. He brings a mentality and a discipline on his team. Because of his age and experience in life, he's done a lot of things that the guys on this team have not.\"\n\nHenderson lost 20 pounds since the first game and is now in better shape, Henry said. Henderson stands 6-foot-4 and got his weight down between 255 and 260 pounds. His work ethic has impressed coaches.\n\n\"He's dedicated a lot of extra time to studying the game plan to make sure he knows the plays and his assignments,\" Henry said. \"He's put in the work mentally and physically. I think it's fair to say he's caught up.\"\n\nThe 25-year-old Henderson will turn 26 in December.\n\n\"I'm the oldest player, by far, on the team,\" Henderson said. \"Some of these guys a lot of them are fresh out of high school. I can teach these guys something about how to be mature in certain situations.\""
