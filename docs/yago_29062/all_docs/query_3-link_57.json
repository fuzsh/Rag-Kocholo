        "text": "In one fan-recorded video, Kunis appears to lower herself as if to “propose” to Kutcher, whom she married in 2015\n\nMila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher’s family partied at Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour!\n\nThe longtime couple and their children — Wyatt Isabelle, 9, and Dimitri Portwood, 7 — seemed to thoroughly enjoy Swift's second Eras Tour show in London on Saturday, June 22.\n\nIn one fan-recorded video — with a caption saying Kunis “proposes” to Kutcher — the actress, 40, sang and danced to “Love Story” with her husband, 46. When Swift sang, “He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring,” Kunis appeared to lower herself as if to propose to Kutcher.\n\nThe That ‘70s Show alums have been married since 2015.\n\nTheir daughter, who was leaning against the VIP section’s railing with friendship bracelets on her arms, was unaware of the cute moment happening behind her — as the Bad Moms actress, wearing a blue flannel button-up shirt, executed the “proposal” with the Two and a Half Men star.\n\nRelated: Taylor Swift Fan Catches Boyfriend's Proposal on Her Own Livestream at Eras Tour in Portugal (Exclusive)\n\nAnother video showed Dimitri and his dad entering a barricaded section and then busting a move to Swift’s “Blank Space.” Kutcher, wearing a white T-shirt and gray pants, paused several times to dance with his son, who wore a graphic white T-shirt and black pants. At one point, Kutcher picked up his son, and they embraced during the “Blank Space” chorus.\n\nIn 2023, Kutcher discussed parenting with PEOPLE, saying, \"For me, the No. 1 role I will ever play is father … It's the most important role in my life.\"\n\nThe PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now!\n\nKunis and Kutcher weren’t the only celebrities at the Eras Tour stop. The two shared the VIP tent at Wembley Stadium with Tom Cruise, Greta Gerwig, Hugh Grant and Travis Kelce, among others.\n\nRelated: Taylor Swift Brings Out Paramore’s Hayley Williams for Surprise Duet at 2nd Eras Tour Show in London\n\nGrant later took to social media to share his experience, writing, \"Dear @taylorswift13. You have an incredible show, an amazing and v hospitable team and excellent if gigantic boyfriend.\" He also included a hashtag suggesting that they took tequila shots.\n\nAt the Friday show, Prince William, Prince George and Princess Charlotte attended and posed with Swift for a photo. The royal trio took another selfie with the 14-time Grammy winner and her NFL boyfriend.\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n\"Happy Bday M8!
