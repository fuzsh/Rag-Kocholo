        "text": "Just in case you thought your TV couple shipping obsession would never amount to anything, fate proved you wrong this weekend when Jackie and Kelso reportedly got married IRL and all was right with the world. What a time to be alive — and to be a rabid That '70s Show fan! Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis are obviously the epitome of adorable in their own right (find me a better-looking couple than those two and I will gladly climb to the top of the Point Place Water Tower myself), but their relationship really reached the frenzy stage thanks to the fact that they played a beloved couple on TV.\n\nKutcher and Kunis are far from the only actors who starred on a television show together and later walked down the aisle. (Or, in the case of celeb faves like Nick Offerman and Megan Mullally, brought their real-life romance to the small-screen.) So in honor of life imitating art imitating life (or vice-versa), check out ten more pairs of your favorite TV characters who married in real life. Because really, is there anything better than TV IRL? (The answer is no, no there is not.)\n\n1. Prince Charming & Snow White, Once Upon a Time\n\nIt doesn't get any better than Snow White (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Prince Charming (Josh Dallas) tying the knot. Talk about a fairytale marriage!\n\n2. Lucas Scott & Brooke Davis, One Tree Hill\n\nR.I.P. Chad Michael Murray and Sophia Bush's short-lived marriage (and Lucas and Brooke's relationship).\n\n3. Pete Campbell & Beth Dawes, Mad Men\n\nVincent Kaitheiser and Alexis Bledel's Mad Men characters had a brief fling, while the actors married in real life. But the most important takeaway here is really that Pete Campbell is now married to Rory Gilmore, which is one pairing I would have definitely never seen coming.\n\n4. Ron Swanson & Tammy Two, Parks and Recreation\n\nNick Offerman and Megan Mullally were already married when they starred as exes on Parks and Rec, and their real-life relationship only made the whole Ron Swanson/Tammy Two dynamic that much more incredible.\n\n5. Sookie Stackhouse & Bill Compton, True Blood\n\nGood thing Anna Paquin and Stephen Moyer's real-life relationship has lasted longer than their True Blood counterparts'.\n\n6. Dexter & Debra Morgan, Dexter\n\nThey may have played half-sibs on Dexter, but Michael C. Hall and Jennifer Carpenter were also married (and later divorced) for real.\n\n7. Wesley Wyndham-Pryce & Willow Rosenberg, Buffy the Vampire Slayer\n\nAlexis Denisof and Alyson Hannigan's Buffy characters may not have dated, but they sure as hell got together IRL.\n\n8. G.O.B. & Wife, Arrested Development\n\nWill Arnett and Amy Poehlerhttp: consistently acted alongside each other during their marriage, including as a married couple on Arrested Development, Arnett as a potential suitor for Poehler's Leslie Knope on Parks and Rec, as a couple in Baby Mama, and as incestious siblings in Blades of Glory. Whew.\n\n9. Roseanne Connor & Arnie Thomas, Roseanne\n\nThough Roseanne Barr was married to Tom Arnold in the real world, on her show he played Arnie Thomas (a clever flip of his name), boyfriend of Roseanne-the-character's friend Nancy.\n\n10. Ricky & Lucy Ricardo, I Love Lucy\n\nPerhaps the OG married-IRL TV couple, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz were married throughout the entire run of I Love Lucy (Ball famously refused to do the show without him playing her husband) but the two divorced in 1960."
