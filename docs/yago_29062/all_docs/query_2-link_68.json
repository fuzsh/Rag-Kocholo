        "text": "ASHTON Kutcher has been married to fellow actor Mila Kunis since 2015.\n\nThe loving couple collaborated on a hilarious Super Bowl commercial in 2021.\n\nAre Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis still married?\n\nThey are still together and appear to be very happy.\n\nThe couple rubbished reports they were on the verge of divorce in 2019 by sharing a hilarious video of them analyzing a recent cover of In Touch Weekly, which stated that “it’s over” between them.\n\nIn the clip uploaded to Instagram on June 20, 2019, Ashton, 41, can be seen turning to Kunis, 35, and asking her: “Babe! What’s going on?”\n\n“It’s over between us,” Mila replied with a smirk on her face, before continuing: “I felt suffocated.”\n\nReading the tabloid report from her mobile phone, the actress added: “Also, I took the kids,” to which the PUNK’D presenter responded: “Oh you took the kids, I don’t get the kids anymore.”\n\nThe footage garnered huge attention, with a number of famous faces commenting on the pair’s funny reaction.\n\nSinger Demi Lovato wrote: “This is amazing. Miss y’all,” while Justin Biebers’ wife Hailey Balwin remarked: “Amazing.”\n\nRumer Willis, who is the daughter of his ex-wife Demi Moore, simply said: “Fake news.”\n\nAshton Kutcher and Mila Kunis have been married for six years after tying the knot in 2015 and share two children, Wyatt, 6, and Dimitri, 4.\n\nWhat have Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis had to say about their relationship?\n\nThe pair is notoriously private about their romance and rarely discuss their personal life, however, they have been ravaged by rumours of a break-up in the past.\n\nIn 2018 a publication published a cover story, which wrongfully claimed: “Mila and Ashton: Divorce Announcement.”\n\nHowever, a representative for Kunis later told Gossip Cop the story was “absolutely not true” and they never planned to make a divorce announcement.\n\nKunis has spoken out about numerous claims she and her husband are divorcing, branding stories about her nothing more than “rumors.\"\n\nIn an interview with Cosmopolitan in August 2018, she said: “Mostly everything that you hear about me is a rumor.\n\n“You know, sometimes, somewhere, a truth will sneak in. Very, very rarely.”\n\nWhen did Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis marry?\n\nThe Hollywood couple began dating in 2012, just a few months after his marriage with actress Demi Moore ended.\n\nHowever, they first met more than 20 years ago on the set of US sitcom, That '70s Show, when Kunis was just 14 and Kutcher was 20.\n\nBoth Kunis and Kutcher starred in the series from 1998 to 2006 and played major characters in the programme.\n\nIn February 2014 they got engaged and married a year later in July 2015 in a secret ceremony, which remained under wraps months after the wedding.\n\nThey welcomed their first child in October 2014 when their daughter Wyatt was born and had their son Dimitri in November 2016."
