        "text": "When Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher first went public as a real-life couple, the Internet—and former co-stars—rejoiced.\n\nBecause apparently Jackie and Kelso's roller-coaster teen love affair on That '70s Show was more meaningful to people than anyone could have anticipated, including the actors themselves.\n\n\"Michael & Jackie forever,\" a loyal commenter wrote just last week when Kutcher took to Instagram to pronounce himself \"the luckiest man alive\" thanks to his enduring partnership with his wife of now eight years, the pair having brought their own brand of fireworks to a July 4, 2015, vow swap.\n\nAnd the couple never forgot their humble sitcom roots (they were happy to return as Mr. and Mrs. Kelso for That '90s Show earlier this year), though they've made it clear that the set of their Fox sitcom was not where the magic happened. Not even when Kunis shared her first-ever kiss in a scene with her onscreen boyfriend.\n\n\"I think we had to both go through a lot in our lives to be the become the people that we were [when we finally got together],\" Kunis once explained to Howard Stern. \"We would never be together based on the people that we used to be.\"\n\n\"I never looked at him as somebody that was good-looking, I never looked at him as somebody that wasn't,\" recalled Kunis, who was 14 when she was cast as Jackie in 1998. It wasn't until years later that she saw Kutcher—or more accurately, the back of some tall guy—at an awards show and was blown away.\n\n\"And then he just turns around and it was literally like if we were in a movie, the music would start playing,\" the actress said. \"I think that he, for the first time ever, took my breath away.\"\n\nReader, she went home with him. But while they would both prove to be down for the count, they started out taking a cue from their respective movies and trying the whole No Strings Attached/Friends With Benefits game themselves.\n\n\"You know, I've learned the hard way how valuable privacy is,\" Kutcher said in the April 2013 issue of Elle. \"And I've learned that there are a lot of things in your life that really benefit from being private. And relationships are one of them. And I am going to do everything in my power to have this relationship be private.\"\n\nAll these years later, that hasn't changed, even when outside forces conspire against him.\n\nBack in September 2019, Kutcher seemingly subtweeted a response to the various headlines Moore's new memoir had been making, none of them painting the Punk'd visionary turned venture capitalist and movie star in a particularly flatting light.\n\n\"I was about to push the button on a really snarky tweet,\" he wrote. \"Then I saw my son, daughter, and wife and I deleted it. [heart emoji]\"\n\nThen they went to Disneyland.\n\nKunis has even said that she keeps her Tiffany diamond engagement ring in a safety deposit box, in case someone's inclined to \"chop my hand off\" to steal it, though she's never without her wedding band, a $90 Etsy find.\n\nKunis, a Golden Globe nominee for Black Swan in 2011, took a break from work after Wyatt was born and then got back into it with the 2016 comedy Bad Moms. (And all the while she's enjoyed the nice-work-if-you-can-get-it spoils of voicing Meg on Family Guy for almost 25 years.)\n\nWhile promoting Bad Moms, Kunis got used to answering questions about her own approach to parenting—and she never shied away from the truth about how darn hard it was to nail the work-kids-husband juggling act.\n\n\"What I do and who I am are two different things and, to me, it was always really important to keep those things separate,\" Kunis explained her nonexistent social media footprint to Australia's Daily Telegraph. \"I don't want people thinking they know me to the point where they feel comfortable coming in my house without being invited. For security reasons, it just wasn't worth it. I'd rather have my privacy over anything.\"\n\nShe also highlighted another reason why she and Kutcher are one of those couples that look like they'd be fun to have a beer with—an early beer, so everyone can be back home in time to tuck the kids in.\n\n\"Clearly I'm the funny one, let's be honest,\" she teased. \"I will say he makes me laugh every day. Sixty years from now, when we're in our rocking chairs and I'm wearing a muumuu, I hope he's still around and I'm still giggling, because the greatest gift you can give is making each other laugh.\"\n\nSounds like a couple who won't think they're too cool for the early bird special at the corner café.\n\n(Originally published March 29, 2017, at 3 a.m. PT)"
