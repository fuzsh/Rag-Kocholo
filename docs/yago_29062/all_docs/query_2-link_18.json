        "text": "The world has been shipping Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher since the '90s when they played on-screen lovers Jackie Burkhart and Michael Kelso, respectively, in the hit teen sitcom That '70s Show. After going their separate ways once the show concluded, they found their way back to each other more than a decade later—giving fans a reason to believe in soul mates. From their no-strings-attached dalliance to welcoming two kids and their return to the screen together, see ahead for every adorable moment KuKu has shared.\n\nAugust 23, 1998: They Meet on That '70s Show.\n\nKunis and Kutcher's relationship is a classic Hollywood romance. They first met on the set of That '70s Show, where they each other's on-screen love interests for eight years. Kunis, then 14 years old, played Jackie Burkhart, while Kutcher, then 20 years old, played Michael Kelso.\n\nKunis later revealed in 2001 that she and the actor had their first kiss on the show, and it was her first kiss ever. \"I was like, 'Oh, he's so cute, it's the Calvin Klein model!' \" she told People. \"Then I was like, 'I have to kiss him?' I was so nervous and uncomfortable. I had the biggest crush on him.\n\nThis nugget of information was unbeknownst to Kutcher, who also found out in 2001. \"I'm the first she kissed? Oh my god, I had no idea!\" he said at the time. \"I'm so glad I didn't know that or it would've been too much pressure.\"\n\nHe added, \"I was so nervous. She acted so cool. She seemed as if she'd done it a thousand times. I was the one with the butterflies in my stomach. I mean, here's this little girl and I have to kiss her. It was nerve-racking.\"\n\nJanuary 15, 2012: They Reunite at the Golden Globes.\n\nAfter they wrapped filming for the show, the pair went their separate ways. Kutcher married Demi Moore in 2005, but the couple later divorced in 2011. Meanwhile, Kunis was in a long-term relationship with Macaulay Culkin, who she also split from in 2011. After taking a few months to process their failed romances, Kunis and Kutcher once again crossed paths, this time at the 69th annual Golden Globes.\n\nKunis reflected on the moment later on the WTF with Marc Maron podcast, saying, \"I was looking around, and there was a really beautiful man from the back. I was literally like, 'Oh, he's kinda hot'…and then he turned around, and I was like, 'Oh my god, it's Kutch.'\"\n\nShe added, \"I thought it was the weirdest thing that I was checking this guy out, and it was someone that I had known forever.\"\n\nLate January 2012: They Have Their First Off-Screen Kiss.\n\nShortly after their reunion, Kutcher invited Kunis to a housewarming party in Hollywood Hills—an event they each remember differently.\n\nKutcher recalled their first kiss on The Howard Stern Show, noting, \"I think I was smoking cigarettes at the time, and I was still a smoker. And she had quit smoking and she was like, she wanted me to like shotgun cigarette smoke so she could breathe it in and I was like, 'All right.'\"\n\n\"Gradually through the night, it got closer and closer and closer,\" he added. \"It was kind of obvious that things were happening.\"\n\nKunis explained on The Late Late Show that that's not how things were supposed to happen. \"I found out later in life that [Kutcher] was trying to set me up on a blind date with one of his friends that night,\" Kunis explained. \"So he was like 'Come over,' and he had a friend he wanted to set me up with and that didn't happen.\"\n\n2012: They Casually Date.\n\nKutcher told Stern they \"legitimately lived out\" their movies (Kutcher's movie No Strings Attached and Kunis's film Friends With Benefits, which each tell the story of friends who agree to casually hooking up, just came out at the time).\n\nKunis echoed the sentiment. \"We were just like, let's just hook up. Let's have fun. We're both single. We both trust each other. Everything's great,\" she told Maron.\n\nApril 2012: They Move in Together.\n\nThings didn't stay casual for long. Kunis admitted on the podcast everything changed for her in just one night.\n\n\"I felt like I got punched in the gut, literally overnight,\" she said. \"I was like, 'You know what, I actually care about you. I don't want to mess anything up, so I'm just going to walk away before it becomes too much.' And he was like, 'Got it.' And the next day, he showed up to my house and he was like, 'Move in with me,' and I said 'OK.'\"\n\nDecember 16, 2012: They Make Their Public Debut.\n\nKutcher and Kunis put their love on display at a football game in Illinois, where they watched the Chicago Bears take on the Green Bay Packers.\n\nFebruary 12, 2013: They Sit Courtside.\n\nThe pair enjoy another sporty date, this time sitting courtside to watch the Los Angeles Lakers take on the Pheonix Suns.\n\nFebruary 2014: They Get Engaged.\n\nAnd after 16 years of friendship and almost two years of living together, Kutcher popped the question. People confirmed the news after Kunis was seen taking a stroll with a massive diamond ring on that finger. With their union on the horizon, the pair quickly started thinking about growing their family. Kunis revealed she was pregnant in May 2014 on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.\n\nApril 25, 2014: They Look Loved Up at California's Country Music Festival.\n\nKutcher and a pregnant Kunis put on a loved-up display at all three days of California's Country Music Festival. Snaps see Kutcher cuddling his wife from behind.\n\nOctober 1, 2014: They Welcome Their First Child.\n\nOn October 1, 2014, the lovebirds officially became parents. Kutcher announced the birth of their daughter on his website, writing, \"Mila and I would like to welcome Wyatt Isabelle Kutcher to the world. May your life be filled with wonder, love, laughter, health, happiness, curiosity, and privacy.\"\n\nDecember 19, 2014: They Make Out at a Lakers Game.\n\nThe new parents managed to sneak out for a date night at the Staples Center to watch Oklahoma City Thunder challenge the Los Angeles Lakers—and they couldn't keep their hands to themselves. At one point, they wrapped their arms around each other and shared a very big, shamelessly public kiss.\n\nJuly 4, 2015: They Tie the Knot.\n\nKutcher and Kunis got their fairytale ending on July 4, 2015, when they tied the knot in a private, low-key ceremony at The Secret Garden at Parrish Ranch in Oak Glen, California. They reportedly had a \"Camp Kuku\" theme (a play on their last names) that included a luxe campground, outdoor activities, and tents.\n\nMay 22, 2016: They Attend the Billboard Music Awards.\n\nKunis put on a dazzling display in a strapless, silver sequin-studded minidress while posing with Kutcher, who was clad in a cozy gray cardigan and pants set, at the 2016 Billboard Music Awards.\n\nOctober 19, 2016: They Announce the Starting Lineup at a Dodgers Game.\n\nThe pair's sports game streak continued, as they took to the baseball diamond to announce the starting lineup for the Los Angeles Dodgers, who played against the Chicago Cubs.\n\nNovember 30, 2016: They Welcome a Second Child.\n\nThe Kukus became a family of four on November 30, 2016, when they welcomed a second child, this time a son named Dimitri Portwood Kutcher.\n\nJuly 17, 2017: Their Kids Make Their Debut.\n\nWyatt and Dimitri make their public debut with their star parents at the 2017 FINA World Championships in Budapest, Hungary.\n\nAugust 10, 2017: They Attend Sziget Festival.\n\nThe pair managed to get a babysitter for the night, so they could enjoy Wiz Khalifa's set during Day 2 of Sziget Festival in Budapest. Kutcher looked at his wife lovingly as they enjoyed the concert.\n\nDecember 3, 2017: They Make Their Red Carpet Debut.\n\nKutcher and Kunis walked the red carpet for the first time as an item at the Breakthrough Prize Awards in December 2017, in what was a PDA-packed outing. The pair held hands and laughed.\n\nJuly 2018: Mila Kunis Opens Up About Her and Ashton Kutcher's Past Relationships.\n\nKunis got vulnerable on the WTF with Marc Maron podcast once again. She addressed Kutcher's eight-year marriage to Moore, which she described as a \"normal, real relationship.\" She added that Kutcher loved Moore's three children, who she shares with Bruce Willis, and helped raise them.\n\nWhen reflecting on her own relationship with the actor, she said it's \"the weirdest story that nobody believes.\" Kunis explained that although it feels like they lost time with one another, they needed space to eventually have their magical relationship.\n\n\"The people that we were back then would never be together. But it's just such a bummer that we missed out on 20 years together. I look back and I think, 'We could have spent 20 years together.' \" she said. \"But we would have never been together if we didn't both go what we went through in order to be the people that we were when we met.\"\n\nJune 19, 2019: They Shut Down Split Rumors.\n\nThe tabloids had a field day reporting Kutcher and Kunis were splitting up, to which the couple had the funniest response. Kutcher took to Instagram to shut down the rumors, posting a video in which Kunis holds up an image of a magazine cover that read \"It's over\" over a photo of the pair. \"Babe, what's happening? What's going on?\" he asked his wife. To which she responded, \"It's over between us,\" and he joked back, \"Oh my God, what are we going to do?\"\n\nAugust 14, 2019: They Discuss Their Parenting Style.\n\nThe usually private couple gave fans some insight into their lives at home, specifically in regards to how they parent. They made a join appearance on the Teach Me Something New podcast, where Kunis shared she and Kutcher are \"silly at home\" and are \"very goofy parents.\"\n\nShe continued, \"I think we're very comfortable with ourselves acting a fool at home, but maybe that comes from the idea of being comfortable in your own body, and in your own skin, and in your mind and not having a fear of making a fool of yourself.\"\n\nFebruary 7, 2021: They Return to the Screen Together.\n\nAfter 15 years, Kunis and Kutcher returned to where it all started—sharing the screen. They starred alongside Shaggy in a 2021 Cheetos Super Bowl commercial.\n\nIn addition to giving fans a bit of nostalgia, Kunis joked that they did the ad to get a break from their kids during lockdown. \"It was quarantine and we were stuck with our children for nine or 12 months at this moment,\" Kunis told Entertainment Tonight. \"And I was like, 'Two days, baby! Two days off!' Literally we were like, 'Yeah, okay, let's do it.' And so we did it. And I hate saying it but we were like, 'Freedom!'\"\n\nMay 2021: They Show Off Their Home.\n\nIn 2021, the couple invited Architectural Digest into their home, which they named \"KuKu Farms.\" \"We wanted a home, not an estate,\" Kunis told the publication. They said they wanted the property to look like an old barn while still feeling \"modern and relevant,\" and added that they even use their six acres of land for farming.\n\nMarch 2022: They Speak Out About the Russo-Ukrainian War.\n\nThe actors and philanthropists released a video showing their support for Kunis's home country Ukraine. They started a GoFundMe to provide aid to Ukrainian refugees fleeing the war, and shared they would match up to $3 million worth of donations to Airbnb.org and Flexport.org in an effort to raise $30 million, which they exceeded in the weeks following.\n\n\"We are overwhelmed with gratitude for the support. And while this is far from a solve of the problem, our collective effort will provide a softer landing for so many people as they forge ahead into their future of uncertainty,\" they wrote on Instagram.\n\nMarch 27, 2022: They Make a Stunning Appearance at the Oscars.\n\nKutcher and Kunis couldn't have looked more in love at the 94th Academy Awards.
