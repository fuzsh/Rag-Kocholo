I'm really lucky,\" Kutcher said.\n\nThe couple met while playing Kelso and Jackie on the hit show \"That 70's Show.\"\n\nOn the show, Kelso and Jackie dated, which led to several big moments for the real-life couple.\n\nShe told W Magazine, \"My first real kiss ever was with him on the show.\"\n\nThey also went to prom together on the show.\n\nShe said: \"My date is my current fiance. We can honestly say that we went to prom together!\"\n\nKunis and Kutcher got engaged in 2014 after dating for two years. Last October, Kunis gave birth to their first child, Wyatt Isabelle.\n\n\"It's just the two of us. It's awesome.
