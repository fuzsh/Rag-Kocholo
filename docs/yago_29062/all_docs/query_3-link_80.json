        "text": "I happened to catch a few minutes of Ashton Kutcher’s Just Married the other night and it occurred to me that he’s made a pseudo-”Marriage” trilogy this decade, likely without even realizing it.\n\nGuess Who\n\nA Meet the Parents redux, albeit one infused with interracial conflict. Kutcher falls in love with a girl and must deal with her bigoted, traditionalist father (Bernie Mac) before asking for her hand in marriage. It’s about falling in love and getting others to accept your somewhat non-traditional relationship before taking the next step and starting a life together. Parallels to the actor’s own romance with Demi Moore are clear as day.\n\nJust Married\n\nKutcher and his new bride (Brittany Murphy) encounter obstacles while on honeymoon that test the bounds of their relationship. It’s about facing the world together as a newly married couple and coming out stronger in the process.\n\nWhat Happens in Vegas\n\nTwo strangers (Ashton Kutcher, Cameron Diaz) drunkenly hook up and get married. While shocked to find themselves trapped in their situation: they resolve to make it work, while each secretly conspires to retain the fortune jointly won the night of their wedding. Is it the first part of the trilogy (discovering a new partner, falling in love despite the odds) or the life-affirming affirming finale (finding yourself married to a stranger, money troubles that lead to strife, eventual rebirth and renewal)? I can’t decide, but I appreciate that it’s left open to the viewer.\n\nAnyway, the series isn’t exactly told in the correct order (Guess Who was actually the second film released, following Just Married) but it works. Here’s hoping The Criterion Collection reads this and issues the three films in a exquisite box set."
