        "text": "Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher were co-stars on the popular sitcom ‘That 70s Show’ from 1998 until 2006.\n\nThe couple reconnected in 2012 and started dating. They got married in 2015, and they have two kids.\n\nAshton and Mila apologized in response to the backlash they received after writing letters in support of Danny Masterson ahead of his prison sentence.\n\nMila Kunis, 40, and Ashton Kutcher, 45, are still going strong! The famous couple have been married since 2015, though their bond started over 20 years ago as co-stars on the popular sitcom series That ’70s Show. Mila and Ashton have expanded their family by welcoming two children, daughter Wyatt, 8, and son Dimitri, 6.\n\nMore recently, both Mila and Ashton faced backlash when they wrote letters of support for Danny Masterson, 47, after he was convicted on two counts of rape. After he was sentenced to 30 years in prison, it was revealed that they’d written letters on his behalf. The pair subsequently released an apology video, explaining why they’d written them. Find out everything you need to know about Mila and Ashton’s relationship from their beginnings on the sitcom to their new apology video.\n\nMila & Ashton Meet on ‘That ’70s Show.’\n\nMila was 14, and Ashton was 19, when they met on the set of That ’70s Show. They played Jackie Burkhart and Michael Kelso, respectively, on the show, which aired from 1998 to 2006. Mila and Ashton had their first kiss on the show playing a couple. “I was like, ‘Oh, he’s so cute, it’s the Calvin Klein model!” Mila told People in 2001. “Then I was like, ‘I have to kiss him?’ I was so nervous and uncomfortable. I had the biggest crush on him.”\n\nAshton and Mila didn’t pursue a relationship while they were co-stars. Ashton ended up leaving the show in 2005 ahead of the final season. They did, however, keep in touch during the years that followed.\n\nThey Marry and Date Other People.\n\nIn September 2005, Ashton married actress Demi Moore. He became a stepfather to Demi’s daughters Rumer, Scout, and Tallulah from her marriage to Bruce Willis. In November 2011, Demi announced that she was ending her marriage with Ashton. Ashton officially filed for divorce from Demi on December 21, 2012, citing irreconcilable differences. They finalized the divorce in November 2013.\n\nMila, meanwhile, dated actor Macauley Culkin from 2002 to 2011. Mila’s been pretty private about that relationship, thought she did describe the split as “a horrible, horrible breakup” on Dax Shepard‘s podcast in 2018.\n\nThey Reconnect at the 2012 Golden Globes.\n\nNow officially both single, Mila and Ashton reconnected at the 69th Golden Globe Awards on January 15, 2012. Mila recalled seeing Ashton again after so many years on The Late Late Show With James Corden in 2016. “At first I was like, ‘Wow that guy’s really tall.’ And then he turned around, and I went, ‘Stop it!’ He’s like, ‘Oh my god, I haven’t seen you in so long.’ And I was like, ‘Yeah, Okay.’ And then he was like, ‘Why don’t you come over my house for a housewarming party?’ ” Mila went on to reveal, “I found out later in life that my husband [Ashton] was trying to set me up with one of his best friends on a blind date that night. He had a friend he wanted to set me up with. That didn’t happen.”\n\nMila & Ashton’s Romance Begins.\n\nMila and Ashton obviously hit it off at his housewarming party which was in early 2012. Ashton detailed how things turned romantic for the pair that very night, where they ended up kissing, on The Howard Stern Show in 2017. “I think I was smiling cigarettes at the time, and I was still a smoker. And she had quit smoking and she wanted me to shotgun cigarette smoke so she could breathe it in and I was like, ‘All right.’ And gradually through the night, it got closer and closer and closer. It was kind of obvious things were happening.”\n\nFrom there, Mila and Ashton started a casual relationship with just hooking up. But things turned serious quickly, and after just three months they had moved in together.\n\nThey Get Engaged.\n\nAfter two years of dating, Mila and Ashton got engaged in early 2014. The Friends with Benefits actress was seen wearing her gorgeous Tiffany engagement ring for the first time on February 27, 2014. A source close to the couple confirmed their engagement to news outlets that day.\n\nThey Welcome Their First Child.\n\nNews of Mila and Ashton’s first pregnancy broke on March 2014, just one month after they confirmed their engagement. Mila confirmed that she was pregnant on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that May. “We actually were able to hide it for a very long time. It’s amazing,” the actress said.\n\nMila and Ashton welcomed daughter Wyatt Isabelle Kutcher on October 1, 2014. They announced the news on Ashton’s website with a message that read, “Mila and I would like to welcome Wyatt Isabelle Kutcher to the world. May your life be filled with wonder, love, laughter, health, happiness, curiosity, and privacy.”\n\nMila & Ashton Get Married.\n\nMila and Ashton officially became husband and wife during the Fourth of July weekend in 2015. They had a private ceremony in Oak Glen, California. Their baby girl Wyatt reportedly wore a little white dress to the wedding. Mila and Ashton have kept the details about their wedding private.\n\nThey Have Another Baby.\n\nOn November 30, 2016, Mila and Ashton welcomed their second child, son Dmitiri Portwood Kutcher. Mila and Ashton have been passionate about keeping their children’s lives private from the media and the public. They do not show their son or daughter’s faces on social media.\n\nMila & Ashton Are Still Together.\n\nOver a decade after they started dating, with a marriage and two children along the way, Mila and Ashton have become one of Hollywood’s most beloved couples. They showcase their beautiful romance on social media and in joint and separate interview. Mila and Ashton are so supportive of one another’s acting careers. The couple also helped raise over $36 million for Mila’s native Ukraine after the country was invaded by Russia in February 2022. They even participated in a Zoom call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who publicly expressed his gratitude to the couple. Ashton and Mila truly are relationship goals!\n\nAshton & Mila Write Letters on Behalf of Danny Masterson.\n\nAshton and Mila’s former That 70s Show co-star Danny Masterson was sentenced to 30 years in prison after he was found guilty of two counts of forcible rape in September 2023. Ahead of his sentencing, both actors wrote letters to the judge to speak about Danny’s character. They each spoke about his anti-drug stance, and they praised his abilities as a father. In her letter, Mila referred to him as an “older brother figure” to her. “I wholeheartedly vouch for Danny Masterson’s exceptional character and the tremendous positive influence he has had on me and the people around him,” she wrote.\n\nAs Ashton asked for his letter to be taken into consideration, he wrote, “I do not believe he is an ongoing harm to society and having his daughter raised without a present father would [be] a tertiary injustice in and of itself.”\n\nAfter the letters were revealed, many people took to social media to call out both of them, including Chrissie Carnell Bixler, who was one of the women who accused Danny. “Dear Ashton, I know the secrets your ‘role model’ keeps for you. Ones that would end you. Did you forget I was there?” she wrote.\n\nAshton posted a video of himself and Mila apologizing and explaining why they’d written the letters in response to the backlash on Instagram on September 9, 2023. Ashton explained that their former co-star’s family had asked them to write letters to “represent the person that we knew for 25 years.” The pair clarified that they weren’t trying to “undermine” the verdict. “The letters were not written to question the legitimacy of the judicial system, or the validity of the jury’s ruling,” Mila said. Ashton also said, “They were intended for the judge to read and not to undermine the testimony of the victims or re-traumatize them in any way. We would never want to do that. And we’re sorry, that has taken place.”\n\nEarlier in the clip, the Black Swan star said that the couple has “historically” supported victims and will continue to do so. As the video concluded, the pair showed sympathy for victims of sexual abuse. “Our heart goes out to every single person who’s ever been a victim of sexual assault, sexual abuse or rape,” Mila said."
