        "text": "I really feel for Demi. Now the media will have a field day making fun of her for daring to marry a much younger man, although they accept men doing this time and time again. Ashton has made a fool of her and I think he is like a lot of extremely good looking men, more in love with himself than anyone else. Did he really think he could play away and not get caught. What are these girls going to do when they realise they were a \"one night stand\", go immediately to the media to make money from their sordid story. Why couldn't Ashton confront the problems within their marriage withough humiliating his wife like this. I thought he was a great guy but now.........jerk of the month!!\n\n0\n\nHollywood marriages seldom last for decades, it's not necessarily the age gap.\n\nMany people stray even when their partner is younger so to blame her age for him looking elsewhere is a bit off.\n\nWe'll never know what went wrong between them, but as they're showbiz, there'll be acres of speculation.\n\n0\n\nI really feel for Demi. Now the media will have a field day making fun of her for daring to marry a much younger man, although they accept men doing this time and time again.\n\nTo be fair men who marry younger women are made fun of all the time.\n\nIn fact the default setting for a man who leaves his wife for a younger model is \"idiot having a mid life crisis who is being taken for a ride by a golddigger\".\n\n0\n\ni cant stand this self obsessed couple - he was never gonna stay with her.\n\nand as for the reports saying she's bisexual and it was an open marriage - big deal so what - they're adults and last time i looked it wasnt a crime.\n\n0"
