        "text": "Ashton Kutcher is making peace with a painful part of his past.\n\nIn an interview with Esquire published Tuesday, the 44-year-old actor opened up about his former marriage with actress Demi Moore, whom he began dating when he was 25.\n\nKutcher spoke about the turmoil of the couple’s fertility struggles, including a miscarriage Moore suffered during a late-term pregnancy.\n\n\"Losing a kid that you think you’re going to have, and that close to thinking you’re going to have a kid, is really, really painful,\" Kutcher told the magazine. \"Everyone deals with that in different ways. ... For whatever reason, I had to have that experience.”\n\nAshton Kutcher's twin Michael told actornot to pity his cerebral palsy, says 'jealousy' drove them apart\n\nAshton Kutcher reveals he battleda 'rare form of vasculitis' and is 'lucky to be alive'\n\nKutcher and Moore were married from 2005 to 2013. During their relationship, the “That ‘70s Show” star also played step-dad to Moore’s three daughters Rumer, Tallulah and Scout, whom Moore shares with actor Bruce Willis.\n\nWhile Kutcher keeps in touch with Moore’s daughters, he said the experience of parenting in his 20s was “a lot ... I wouldn’t have gotten married to a woman that had three kids if I didn’t love kids,” Kutcher said, but “I was 26, bearing the responsibility of an 8-year-old, a 10-year-old, and a 12-year-old. That’s how some teen parents must experience their 20s.\"\n\nFollowing his split from Moore, Kutcher married his “That ‘70s Show” co-star Mila Kunis. The couple share two children: daughter Wyatt Isabelle, 8, and son Dimitri Portwood, 6.\n\nAnd while Moore hasn’t remarried since their divorce, her family is expanding. In December, Moore’s eldest daughter Rumer revealed she's expecting her first child with boyfriend Derek Richard Thomas, marking Moore’s first grandchild with Willis.\n\nLike any proud mom, Moore also shared her daughter's happy news on her own Instagram page.\n\n“Entering my hot kooky unhinged grandma era,” Moore playfully captioned a photo of Rumer’s baby bump following the announcement.\n\nRumer Willis is pregnant!Demi Moore celebrates entering 'kooky, unhinged grandma era'\n\nHow Ashton Kutcher drew on 'Dukes of Hazzard' to play a Texas baddie in B.J. Novak's 'Vengeance'\n\nContributing: Jenna Ryu, USA TODAY"
