        "text": "Mila Kunis might have met her husband Ashton Kutcher on the set of “That ’70s Show,” where they played on-again off-again couple Jackie and Kelso, but she isn’t so sure that their characters’ tumultuous romance would have lasted.\n\nThe couple is set to reprise their roles in the upcoming Netflix sequel “That ’90s Show,” and Kunis revealed during a recent interview with Access Hollywood that Jackie and Kelso are married with a child in the new series — a development that she took some issue with.\n\n“My husband and I are together in [the new show], which is weird ’cause we shouldn’t have been,” Kunis said. “You know what, I called B.S. I was like, ‘My character would be with Fez.’ I think that I ended up with Wilmer [Valderrama]’s character.”\n\nThe actress also pointed out that at the end of “That ’70s Show,” Kelso is already spoken for. “Now we’re like 20 years — no, 16 years later, whatever it is, and now we’re married with a kid. And I was like, ‘I don’t know about this one,’” Kunis joked.\n\nIt’s true, the series ends with Kelso moving to Chicago to be closer to his current partner, Brooke (Shannon Elizabeth), with whom he had a daughter named Betsy. But he didn’t leave without professing his love once more to Jackie, who also admitted she still had feelings for Kelso.\n\nThe pair agreed they had some growing up to do before their relationship could work, but the show didn’t completely shut the door on their romance. Jackie and Kelso were also a fan favorite, so it makes sense the writers would want to give audiences that victory.\n\nKunis called the spinoff “very sweet,” but also admitted that she was a bit nervous to film with her now-husband, especially back on the set where their relationship started.\n\n“I was more nervous to do that than anything else in my career,” she said. “I don’t know. It made me so uncomfortable, because acting is bulls—. At the end of the day, it’s all about f—ing bulls—ing. So, I would look at my husband while we were doing a scene or rehearsing and be like, ‘Oh my god, that’s what you look like when you act.’”\n\n“That 90s Show” wrapped production in July. A premiere date hasn’t been announced yet."
