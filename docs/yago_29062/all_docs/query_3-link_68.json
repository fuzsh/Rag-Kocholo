        "text": "Years after reconciling, Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis tied the knot in a private ceremony in Oak Glen, Calif., on the Fourth of July in 2015.\n\n\"Commitment sounded great, but I didn't believe in marriage,\" Kunis told Glamour in 2016. \"I grew up in West Hollywood, and my brother has reminded me that when I was like 12, I said, 'When gay people can get married, then I'll get married.' I was ahead of my time. The Supreme Court decision [on same-sex marriage came down], and that's when Ashton and I got married.\"\n\nThey share two children — daughter Wyatt Isabelle and son Dimitri Portwood.\n\nBeyoncé and Jay-Z met when she was 18, and they started dating months later. On April 4, 2008, the couple tied the knot in a secret ceremony at Jay-Z's Manhattan penthouse.\n\n\"There was no rush — no one expected me to run off and get married,\" Queen Bey told Seventeen. \"I really don't believe that you will love the same thing when you're 20 as you do at 30. So that was my rule: Before the age of 25, I would never get married. I feel like you have to get to know yourself, know what you want, spend some time by yourself, and be proud of who you are before you can share that with someone else.\"\n\nJay-Z then confirmed their marriage in a September 2008 interview with Vibe.\n\nThe Fantastic Four set became a bridge between Cash Warren and Jessica Alba, who dated for years before marrying in a low-key ceremony at the Beverly Hills courthouse in May 2008.\n\nSpeaking about their secret to a lasting marriage, Alba told People they constantly communicate and keep no secret.\n\n\"At different times, there were different things that we needed. Around the time I had the kids, it was like, 'I need [date night] once a week,'\" she said. \"And he's been like, 'I need you to be present on the weekends and not work.' Over-communicating, maybe that's it.\"\n\nAfter dating for six months, Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz secretly tied the knot in June 2011 in front of four people.\n\n\"We got away with it,\" Craig said of the ceremony during his interview with British GQ. \"We did it privately. And I've got a lot of people to thank for that.\"\n\nDave McCary and Emma Stone sparked marriage rumors a source told several news outlets they exchanged their vows privately on September 26, 2020.\n\nWhen the Poor Things actress won the Golden Globe for Best Film Actress in a Comedy or Musical in January, she mentioned McCary first in her acceptance speech.\n\n\"This is amazing, thank you. Dave, I have to start with you really quickly,\" Stone said. \"I love you very much. Thank you for everything!\"\n\nOn September 7, 2020, David Harbour and Lily Allen said \"I do's\" during a secret Las Vegas wedding officiated by an Elvis Presley impersonator.\n\n\"In a wedding officiated by the king himself, the people's princess wed her devoted, low born, but kind credit card holder in a beautiful ceremony lit by the ashen skies courtesy of a burning state miles away in the midst of a global pandemic,\" Harbour captioned the Instagram post confirming their marriage.\n\nThree years after their 2010 engagement, Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell officially married at the Beverly Hills courthouse without informing the public.\n\nIn her interview with Today, The Good Place actress described her wedding day as the \"easiest one\" of her life.\n\n\"I came out in sweatpants, and my husband was in a tuxedo, which was so cute, and he was like, 'I'll go pick your outfit out,'\" Bell shared. \"And he picked out a little black jumpsuit.\"\n\nJavier Bardem and Penélope Cruz married in an intimate ceremony at a friend's home in the Bahamas in January 2011. Although they kept everything private, the Vanilla Sky star revealed why she wanted to protect their family's privacy.\n\n\"There is something that is not making sense, and it's especially affecting younger generations,\" she said, saying she has always been careful about what she shares online. \"I feel really bad for the ones that are teenagers now. It's almost [as] if the world was doing some kind of experiment on them. 'Oh, let's see what happens if you expose a 12-year-old to that much technology.'\"\n\nAlthough they had a brief split, Mark Consuelos and Kelly Ripa found their way back to each other and secretly eloped on May 1, 1996, as soon as he asked to get married.\n\n\"Since we don't have to work tomorrow, why don't we fly to Vegas and get married?\" Consuelos asked Ripa a day before their secret wedding at the Chapel of the Bells."
