And now, Moore’s youngest daughter Tallulah Willis is sharing exactly how she felt when news broke that her mother and Kutcher were together.\n\n“That did send me into, like, a total dumpster fire. It was really hard, and I’m still unpacking,” she said to UsMagazine. “It was, like, 2003, [and] my mom had just started dating Ashton. It was that moment, [when] a lot [was] going on, [that] I really went inside of myself.”\n\nShe added that she “didn’t fully understand” her family’s fame until that relationship hit newsstands everywhere.\n\nMoore and Kutcher met back in 2003 during a dinner party, and hit it off immediately despite their 15-year age difference. The pair dated for two years before tying the knot in 2005. They called it quits in 2011, and their divorce was finalized in 2013. Years later, Moore detailed the tumultuous relationship in her memoir Inside Out, but the pair have since, more or less, mended their friendship.\n\nAt the time, Kutcher was the stepfather to Moore and Bruce Willis’ three daughters Rumer, now 34, Scout, now 31, and Tallulah now 29.\n\nWhile Scout has never publicly commented on her mother’s former relationship, Tallulah and Rumer have talked about it a few times now in total. Per UsMagazine, Rumer revealed that while she was “angry” at her mom for dating Kutcher at first, she did admit he was a great stepfather."
