        "text": "Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis are celebrating six years of married life, but the two actually met over 20 years ago, while working together in the late nineties.\n\nBoth got into longterm relationships in the noughties, Ashton with Demi Moore and Mila with Macaulay Culkin, but the pair who played lovers on Fox comedy That 70's Show were to find love in real life.\n\nThese days the couple are private when it comes to their relationship. Mila doesn't use Instagram, and Ashton rarely posts photos of his private life, although he is prone to the odd loved up selfie.\n\nHere's the full backstory on how Mila and Ashton ended up together, as they celebrate their sixth wedding anniversary.\n\nMet in the late nineties\n\nIn 1998 Mila and Ashton were both series regulars on That '70s Show. At the time, Mila was 15 and Ashton was 20.\n\nFor Mila, who instantly crushed on Ashton, it was a \"nervous\" experience working with the actor, particularly as their on screen characters Jackie Burkhart and Michael Kelso shared a kiss on the show.\n\n\"I was like, ‘Oh, he's so cute, it's the Calvin Klein model!\" Mila explained to People magazine, reflecting back to when the two first met.\n\n\"Then I was like, ‘I have to kiss him?' I was so nervous and uncomfortable. I had the biggest crush on him.\"\n\nThe two worked together on the show between 1998 and 2006.\n\nWent their separate ways\n\nAshton left That 70's Show in 2005 after choosing not to renew his contract for the eighth season.\n\nIn the same year, he married the actor Demi Moore, who he had been introduced to in 2003 through mutual friends.\n\nAll the while, Mila had been dating Home Alone actor Macaulay Culkin since 2002, but the pair eventually split in 2011 after nine years together.\n\nMila described to Women's Health magazine that she and Macaulay \"grew up together,\" referring to him as a \"steady rock\" in her life.\n\nIt was that same year, 2011, that Ashton and Demi announced their split. It was alleged that Ashton had cheated on Demi, and he filed for divorce in 2012 which was completed by 2013.\n\nA random meeting\n\nIt was at the Golden Globe awards in 2012 that Ashton and Mila bumped into each other for the first time in years, and both newly single, Ashton invited Mila to hang out.\n\nThey shared a kiss soon after at Ashton's housewarming, but the duo weren't sure the union was right for either party.\n\n\"We end up having a lot of talks about how this is a huge mistake and how he needs to go and be single and I need to go and be single. It was super private for a very long time,' Mila told the WTF with Marc Maron podcast.\n\nThey decided to give it a go by April 2012 though, and Mila explained to the Howard Stern show: \"We started dating with the idea we're both never going to get married. [He] just got out of a marriage. I got out of a long relationship. I was single and having the best time ever. I was totally dating, having a great time, and I was like, 'I'm never getting married.' He's like, 'Great, neither am I!'...\n\n\"And we're like shaking hands on it and we're like, 'Life is great!' A year later, we're like, 'Tomorrow, let's get married.'\"\n\nBy February 2014 the couple were engaged, and in May of that same year they announced they were expecting their first child, their daughter Wyatt, who arrived that September.\n\nThe two got married in July 2015 and a year-and-a-half later in November 2016, the couple welcomed their second child, a boy named Dimitri.\n\nFamily life\n\nAshton and Mila have always been private with their family life, and in 2016 around the birth of their second child, Ashton told digital media platform A Plus more about their parenting approach.\n\n\"We'd like to allow our kids to make their own choices on whether to have a life in the public eye or not,\" he said.\n\nThere's only one photo of Wyatt that's ever been shared by Ashton, from back in 2015, and her head is turned away from the camera.\n\nThe last time Ashton posted about his relationship with Mila was during the first lockdown, when the couple appeared on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.\n\nHaving married on the 4th of July, the couple join other couples including Victoria and David Beckham, Julia Roberts and Danny Moder and Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne, all of whom exploited the opportunity to tie the knot on American Independence Day."
