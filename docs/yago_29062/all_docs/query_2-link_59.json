And I just try to connect to that and celebrate who she was and how she was and not make sense of it ‘cause there is no sense of making sense of it.”\n\nWhen did Ashton marry Demi Moore?\n\nOn September 24, 2005, Ashton and Demi tied the knot in a private wedding ceremony at their Beverly Hills home.\n\nThe pair began dating sometime in 2003, three years after Demi divorced her first husband Bruce Willis.\n\nOn November 17, 2011, Ashton and Demi revealed they were separating.\n\nIn a statement, the former Punk'd host announced: \"I will forever cherish the time I spent with Demi.\n\n\"Marriage is one of the most difficult things in the world and unfortunately sometimes they fail.\"\n\nOn November 26, 2013, the former couple's divorce was finalized.\n\nWhen did Ashton marry Mila Kunis?\n\nOn July 4, 2015, Ashton walked down the aisle with fellow That '70s Show alum Mila Kunis.\n\nThe pair held a private wedding ceremony at Parris Ranch in Oak Glen, California.\n\nAt that point, Ashton and Mila had already been dating for three years.\n\nThe co-stars struck up a romance after reuniting at a party at Ashton's house in January 2012.\n\nHowever, they met several years before via That '70s Show when Mila was 14 years old and Ashton was 19.\n\nSince tying the knot, they welcomed two children together, a daughter named Wyatt Isabelle and a son named Dimitri.\n\nWyatt was born on October 1, 2014, and Dimitri was born on November 30, 2016."
