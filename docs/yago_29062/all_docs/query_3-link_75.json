        "text": "Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher were first paired over two decades ago, when their characters Jackie and Kelso got together on That ‘70s Show. So in a way, they’ve been together for…about 50 years.\n\nBut in a realer sense, they pair hooked up in the 2010s and have been going strong ever since, with two kids together and what seems like a great sense of humor about their relationship.\n\nHere's a look back and the highs and (very few) lows of the Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher story.\n\n1998\n\nThe pair meet on the set of That ‘70s Show, when Kunis is 14 and Kutcher, 19. Though they are friends—Kutcher says he thinks of Kunis as “a little sister”—their onscreen relationship (he is her first kiss) isn't replicated in real life. Kunis later tells Marc Maron that she had “no feelings whatsoever” for Kutcher at the time, but Kutcher makes a small correction to that story, telling Howard Stern, “She's lying. She has a journal, like a diary of when she was a kid that she wrote…. She thought I was cute.” Cute or not, they don't get together until…\n\n2012\n\nJanuary: The two reconnect and hook up at a party. Kutcher broke up with Demi Moore just a month earlier (their divorce was finalized in 2013), so Kunis suggests they keep things “casual.\" But she changes her mind just a few months later.\n\nApril: After Kutcher mentions seeing another woman, Kunis realizes her feelings go deeper. As she recalls, “He said something, and I was like, ‘Oh my God. I love this man, and I have to walk away because this is not the agreement that we had. And so I'm going to speak up.’ The next day he showed up to my house and he was like, ‘Move in with me,’ and I said, ‘Okay.’”\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\n2014\n\nFebruary: On February 27, a source confirms that the two are engaged.\n\nOctober: They welcome a baby girl on October 1. Wyatt Isabelle Kutcher is their first child.\n\n2015\n\nJuly: Over the Fourth of July holiday, they tie the knot! The celebration at the Secret Garden at Parrish Ranch in Oak Glen, California, is intimate and relaxed (the pair got legally hitched the week prior). Both Mila and daughter Wyatt wear white dresses.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\n2016\n\nNovember: On November 30, they welcome a baby boy named Dimitri Portwood Kutcher.\n\n2019\n\nJune: They do not divorce, despite what the tabloids, uh, invent.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\n2021\n\nOver the summer, they are embroiled in the great Hollywood bathing debate. They take the reactions on social media lightly, and on August 11 Ashton and Mila post a video of themselves—wait for it—bathing their kids, and they are giggling the whole way through."
