        "text": "In June 2019, the couple tackled tabloid speculation that their marriage was over in the most hilarious way possible.\n\n\"I guess it's over... Maybe next week my wife will be having twins. For the third time. But who's counting,\" Ashton jokingly captioned a video of him and Mila posted to his Instagram account.\n\nIn the video, his wife deadpanned, \"I felt suffocated.\" His response? \"I was just so overbearing wasn't I?\"\n\nMila and Ashton have been longtime friends with Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard, which is why they were able to send such a thoughtful Christmas gift for the couple's guest room in 2018.\n\n\"What a generous Christmas gift from the Kunis-Kutcher family,\" Dax, who starred on Punk'd with Ashton, shared on Instagram. \"A beautiful shower curtain for the attic(t) bathroom!\"\n\nThe Punk'd mastermind seemed to get a taste of his own medicine when he tried to get Mila a thoughtful Valentine's Day gift in 2019 when he noticed she and their kids loved watching a robin that had nested eggs in a tree outside their kitchen window.\n\n\"Ashton got me two little lovebirds,\" said on Ellen. But when they took the new pets to get cleaned, they learned he had not been given lovebirds, but budgies.\n\n\"I love my husband so, so, so, so much and it's the thought that counts and it's such a beautiful thought,\" Mila said.\n\nMila was outed as a Bachelor super-fan by Ashton in 2015 after he posted a photo of himself standing next to a TV still of Jared Haibon's face, writing \"I'm trying to figure out why mila is making me take this picture. @ashleyiaco who are you? And who is this guy?\"\n\nAnd the couple even ended up going on the show in 2017, making a memorable appearance during Rachel Lindsay's season of The Bachelorette.\n\nIn 2018, Ashton finally came face-to-face with his Bachelor doppelganger when he and Mila met Jared and Ashley Iaconetti at a charity event.\n\n\"In 2015, Ashton Kutcher tweeted a side by side photo of our faces,\" Haibon captioned a couple of the two couples meeting for the first time. \"In 2017, he said he got into watching The Bachelor because a guy named Jared looked like him. In 2018, we met and bonded over marrying our best friends.\"\n\nMila gave birth to the couple's second child, a son named Dimitri, on Nov. 30, 2016. (Ashton accidentally revealed they were having a boy during an interview months earlier.)\n\nAnd the Bad Moms star would later gush about Wyatt taking on the big sister role, telling Ellen DeGeneres, \"My daughter is very sweet to him. She's actually really nice. There are times where she's like an a-hole but more times than not she's actually really kind and really generous.\"\n\nIn October 2014, the couple welcomed their first child, a daughter named Wyatt Isabelle Kutcher.\n\nAnd Ashton being Ashton, he decided to have some fun with their baby's announcement anad the first photo of Wyatt, he posted a slew of pics to a guessing game posted to his Aplus.com site.\n\n\"Mila and I would like to welcome Wyatt Isabelle Kutcher to the world,\" he wrote. \"May your life be filled with wonder, love, laughter, health, happiness, curiosity, and privacy. Can you guess which one is ours, or does it really matter? All babies are cute.\"\n\nThe couple wed over the Fourth of July weekend in 2015, officially becoming husband and wife in a private ceremony. They exchanged vows at the Secret Garden at Parrish Ranch in Oak Glen, Calif., right at sunset in front of close family and friends, with an insider spilling that the bride wore a \"strapless dress with her hair pulled back\" and the couple's daughter Wyatt also donned a white dress.\n\nAnd the newlyweds decided to embark on the most low-key honeymoon ever, taking an RV trip up the California coast with their then-9-month-old Wyatt, with eyewitnesses saying the couple packed on the PDA and were super-friendly to the locals. Mila later recalled the \"absurb\" honeymoon and all of its misadventures during an interview with Jimmy Fallon, including their air conditioner breaking and how they \"almost died\" after they were directed onto a fireroad."
