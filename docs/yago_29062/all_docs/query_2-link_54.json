        "text": "Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis have one of the sweetest relationships in Hollywood. After meeting each other on set for That 70s Show when Kunis was just 14, they’ve been in each others lives for longer than most celebrity couples can say — but, that doesn’t mean the path to their love story was exactly linear.\n\nFrom lengthy relationships and one marriage to other people before a fateful reuniting, the pair ending up together was basically written in the stars once they’d had a few more life experiences under their belts.\n\nAs Kunis once said while on a podcast, they ended up being the right people at the right time when they wandered back into each others lives.\n\n“The people that we were back then would never be together,” she said. “It’s just such a bummer that we missed out on 20 years together, but we would have never been together if we didn’t both go what we went through in order to be the people that we were when we met.”\n\nBelow, everything you need to know about the Hollywood couple’s enviable love life.\n\n1998: They meet on That 70s Show\n\nAnyone who watched the iconic teen sitcom, That 70s Show, would have instantly fallen in love with the chemistry between Kunis (Jackie Burkhart) and Kutcher (Michael Kelso) whose characters dated on the show. They were 14 and 20, respectively, when the pilot episode aired in 1998, with the significant age gap revealed to be a result of Kunis lying about her age to get the part.\n\nKunis’ first real life kiss was from Kutcher on the show, with the actress telling PEOPLE in 2001 that she had a huge crush on him.\n\n“I was like, ‘Oh, he’s so cute, it’s the Calvin Klein model,” she said. “Then I was like, ‘I have to kiss him?’ I was so nervous and uncomfortable. I had the biggest crush on him.”\n\nKutcher, had no idea that this was her first kiss.\n\n“I’m the first guy she kissed? Oh my god, I had no idea,” he told PEOPLE in 2001. “I’m so glad I didn’t know that or it would’ve been too much pressure.”\n\nKutcher left the series in 2005 after seven seasons, causing most of his contact with Kunis to cease, though they did keep in touch occasionally.\n\nSeptember2005: Ashton Kutcher marries Demi Moore\n\nAfter two years of dating, Kutcher married actress Demi Moore and became a step-father to her three daughters from her previous marriage to Bruce Willis.\n\nJanuary 2011: Mila Kunis and Macaulay Culkin break up\n\nAfter 8 years, Kunis splits with her then-boyfriend, Macaulay Culkin.

Marriage is one of the most difficult things in the world and unfortunately sometimes they fail.”\n\nJanuary 2012: Ashton and Mila reunite at the Golden Globes\n\nEarly 2012: The pair start casually dating\n\nAfter that fateful night, Kutcher and Kunis started casually seeing each other.

Let’s have fun. We’re both single. We both trust each other. Everything’s great,” she said during an appearance on the WTF with Marc Maron podcast.\n\n“It was the first time ever that I ever slept over at a guy’s house since becoming single …” she said. “When I was single, I was so adamant about never staying at a guy’s house, that I was like peacing out. And he was like, ‘You’re not leaving.’ And that was the first time [I didn’t.]”\n\nThe casual thing only lasted three months before Kutcher asked Kunis to move in with him.\n\nFebruary 2014: Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis get engaged\n\nAfter finalising his divorce to Moore in November 2013, Kutcher popped the question with Kunis seen sporting a Tiffany engagement ring on February 27, 2014.\n\nOctober 2014: Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis welcome a daughter\n\nA few months after news of their broke, Kunis told Ellen DeGeneres that she was expecting their first child.

It’s the greatest thing on Earth,” Kutcher told Conan O’Brien later that month, per Us Weekly. “We’re really privileged that we have time and can afford to take time. So we don’t have a nanny or a night nurse of any of the stuff. It’s just the two of us.”\n\nJuly 4, 2015: Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis get married\n\nNearly a year after the birth of their first child, the pair tie the knot in a lowkey, private ceremony at The Secret Garden at Parrish Ranch in Oak Glen, California.\n\nSources said that they turned the property into “Camp Kuku,” a play on both of their last names, setting up outdoor activities and rows of tents to make a luxe campground.

Like, I think we’re very comfortable with ourselves acting a fool at home.”\n\nFebruary 2021: The couple star in a Super Bowl commercial together\n\nFor the first time in decades, Kutcher and Kunis shared the screen together for a Cheetos commercial for the 2021 Super Bowl.\n\nKunis later joked to Entertainment Tonight that they did the commercial partially to get a break from their kids during quarantine.\n\n“It was quarantine and we were stuck with our children for nine or 12 months at this moment,” Kunis said. “And I was like, ‘Two days, baby! Two days off!. Literally we were like, ‘Yeah, okay, let’s do it.’ And so we did it. And I hate saying it but we were like, ‘Freedom!’ “\n\nMarch 2022: The couple raise over $30 million for Ukrainian refugees\n\nAfter Russia invaded Ukraine at the end of February, Kutcher and Kunis (who emigrated from Ukraine when she was 7) started a GoFundMe to support refugees fleeing the country.\n\nAfter starting with a goal of $30 million, the pair ended up raising over $36 million for the cause.\n\n“Once I realized that this thing is not going to end anytime tomorrow, I could wrap my head around the refugee situation, and not just the refugee problem, but the getting supplies into the country.

It was so random and fun.”\n\nHe then added that it felt “very nostalgic” to be back on set, referencing how “bizarre” it was to be surrounded by the same people he essentially grew up with, all these years later.\n\nKunis later told Access Hollywood how “weird” it was being back on the set with her now-husband.\n\n“I was more nervous doing that than anything else in my career — to shoot with my husband on the set of ‘That ’70s show‘ because the set is exactly the same,” she said, adding, “To be married but to be at the place where we met — and it looks the same — was trippy.”\n\nSeptember 2022: Kutcher reveals how he told Kunis he loved her\n\nIn a TikTok video for Peloton, Kutcher revealed the story behind the first time he told Kunis he loves her.\n\n“I might have had a little too much tequila,” Kutcher said. “I showed up drunk at her house at like two in the morning and started screaming, ‘You and tequila make me crazy.’ And I told her I love her, and she said, ‘Don’t say it if you don’t mean it. Are you gonna love me in the morning when you wake up from this hangover?'”\n\nHe added, “I woke up the next morning and said, ‘I still love you.’ “\n\nKunis confirmed the story while talking to Entertainment Tonight.\n\n“It really happened,” she told the outlet. “Oh, I remember that night. I didn’t have tequila. I was sober and I was like, ‘Oh my god.’ It happened, guys.”"
