But who’s counting.\n\nA post shared by Ashton Kutcher (@aplusk) on Jun 19, 2019 at 6:52pm PDTJun 19, 2019 at 6:52pm PDT\n\n\"It's over between us,\" Kunis said in the video, holding up an apparent image of the magazine cover that featured the couple with a headline that read: \"It's over!\"\n\n\"I felt suffocated,\" the \"Bad Moms\" star continued.\n\nIn response, Kutcher jokingly said: \"You felt suffocated by me? I was just so overbearing, wasn't I?\"\n\nKunis also said that according to the magazine, she took the couple's two kids.\n\n\"You had a very dark secret exposed,\" Kunis told Kutcher.\n\nA few of their famous followers also commented on the video and shared their reactions.\n\nDax Shepard jokingly said that he \"was gonna take a run at [Kunis]\" and wanted a \"refund.\" Demi Lovato said, \"This is amazing\" and Sarah Hyland sarcastically said, \"I knew it.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Rumer Willis (the daughter of Bruce Willis and Demi Moore, who Kutcher was previously married to) responded with facepalm emojis and the hashtag \"fakenews.\"\n\nRead more: WHERE ARE THEY NOW: The cast of 'That '70s Show' 13 years later\n\nThe two stars met on the set of \"That '70s Show,\" playing on-again, off-again couple Jackie Burkhart and Michael Kelso. Kunis was 14 when she began the show, and in interviews, she's opened up about how their relationship began years later when she ran into the \"Ranch\" star at an awards show.\n\n\"I did have a moment where I was like, 'Well he's handsome.' And for the first time in my life, I thought that Ashton was actually handsome,\" she said while appearing on NBC's \"Sunday Sitdown With Willie Geist.\"\n\nIn July 2018, Kunis also said that she and Kutcher never actually dated. Their relationship started by hooking up, which mimicked the 2011 movies they starred in.\n\nRead more: Mila Kunis reveals how she and husband Ashton Kutcher got together and proves hooking up can lead to love\n\n\"I did a movie called 'Friends With Benefits.' He did a movie that was very similar called 'No Strings Attached.' We lived our movies out,\" she told Marc Maron. \"We were like, let's just hook up. Let's have fun. We're both single. We both trust each other. Everything's great.\"\n\nThe \"Spy Who Dumped Me\" star said she developed serious feelings for Kutcher.\n\n\"We were both seeing other people, so the second I started caring that he was seeing somebody else in that regard, I felt like I got punched in the gut, literally overnight,\" she said.\n\nKunis ended up coming clean about her reaction and Kutcher showed up at her house and asked her to move in with him. The stars got married in 2015 and welcomed daughter Wyatt in 2014 and son Dimitri in 2016."
