        "text": "With Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher’s prolonged absence from the public eye, many are wondering, “How is their marriage doing?” While we don’t know any details, relationship experts have weighed in on it, and they believe there could be trouble afoot for them.\n\nThe relationship experts called out Kutcher’s continual cheating in past relationships as a red flag, along with their frosty comments to one another over the years. However, the biggest thing that these experts from Glam believe to be the biggest obstacle in their relationship could be their lack of fulfillment outside their marriage.\n\nAfter they got canceled for showing support for their former co-star Danny Masterson, both have been on the down low (with Kunis making a rare red carpet appearance earlier this year solo). But the once beloved couple may be heading for some trouble, and experts believe it has everything to do with them having to leave multiple companies.\n\nBoth of them left the anti-sex-trafficking nonprofit Thorn. CEO of Exclusive Matchmaking, and behavior and relationship expert Patrick Wanis, PhD, said that this could hurt their relationship, telling the outlet that, “His position as Board Chair was truly significant to him. … My concern is that Ashton has subsequently lost something that gave his life meaning and purpose beyond acting or producing entertainment.”\n\n“Possibly being lost without a rudder and a goal of passionate significance, Ashton and Mila’s marriage could greatly suffer and be negatively affected,” Wanis added, noting that this could hurt both of their fulfillments, leading to friction in their marriage.\n\nWhile both have quite a few acting and producing credits for future projects, not having another outlet can reportedly hurt them in the long run, but only time will tell.\n\nFor those who don’t know, Kunis and Kutcher met on the set of That 70s Show when she was 14, and he was 19, but they didn’t start dating until 2012 after reconnecting at an A-list party. They got engaged two years later, in Feb 2014, and married in July 2015. They share two children together named Wyatt, born in Oct 2014, and Dimitri, born in Nov 2016."
