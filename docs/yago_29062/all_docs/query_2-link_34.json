I was literally like, ‘Oh, he’s kinda hot’…and then he turned around, and I was like, “Oh my god, it’s Kutch.’ I thought it was the weirdest thing that I was checking this guy out, and it was someone that I had known forever.”\n\nThe actress shared that started dating casually as both of them had become freshly single. Kunis shared,\n\n“We started dating with the idea that we both were never gonna get married. I was having the best time of my life, I had just come out of a relationship. He had come out of marriage. I said I was never gonna get married and he said great, neither am I. We were like shaking hands on it.”\n\nShe had broken up with her long-time boyfriend, Macaulay Culkin.
