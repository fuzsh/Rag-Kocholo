        "text": "We're always rooting for our favorite on-screen couples, so when \"That '70s Show\" stars Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher were first seen together off-screen, it sent fans' hearts fluttering. Though Jackie and Kelso don't end up together in the final season — sorry, spoiler alert — we've always felt a little better inside knowing that they do end up together in real life.\n\nKunis and Kutcher's love story, however, didn't begin until a couple of decades after they met. Their relationship even began as a casual hook-up before it escalated into experiencing more serious emotions. Now, the two can't imagine spending any sort of time apart. Living life alongside Kutcher \"truly is being married to your best friend,\" Kunis told Glamour. \"That's a cliché; it's cheesy. But it's true.\"\n\nFor the most part, these actors like to keep their private lives out of the spotlight — but we did some digging. From their top-secret engagement to the reason why we don't see them together on-screen anymore, here's a full timeline of Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher's romance.\n\nMila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher's story goes way back — though it definitely wasn't love at first sight for these two. They met on the set of \"That '70s Show\" when they were cast on the series as only teenagers in 1998. Though sparks weren't flying while they filmed the show, Kunis was secretly admiring the young actor from afar. \"I had the biggest crush on him,\" she later admitted to People. Lucky for her, the two shared a lot of scenes, and their characters even dated each other off and on throughout the series.\n\nWhile their characters were surely feeling the love, romance was never on these actors' minds. Behind the scenes, the two were busy trying to navigate show business — and they were also five years apart in age. \"She was like my little sister,\" Kutcher explained on \"The Howard Stern Show.\" In fact, he frequently helped her with her high school chemistry homework on set.\n\nFans of \"That '70s Show\" were obsessed with Jackie and Kelso's romance. When the two locked lips for the very first time during Season 2 in 1999, it was a major moment for the series. However, it was an even bigger moment for Mila Kunis. It was the first kiss she had ever had. \"I was so nervous and uncomfortable,\" the actor later admitted to People. At the time, Ashton Kutcher had no clue that his co-star was so uncomfortable. \"She seemed as if she'd done it a thousand times,\" he said. \"I was the one with the butterflies in my stomach. I mean, here's this little girl and I have to kiss her. It was nerve-racking.\"\n\nThe two ended up kissing quite a bit over the course of the series, too — 19 times to be exact, according to the people over at Pop TV.\n\nAfter Ashton Kutcher left \"That '70s Show\" a season early, Mila Kunis made sure to keep in touch with him — mostly over AOL instant messenger. As the actor admitted on \"The Howard Stern Show,\" their relationship still continued to be strictly a friendship. During that time, the two didn't get to see each other very often either as they were both busy actors.\n\nEven before the finale of \"That '70s Show\" ever aired in 2006, Kutcher seemed to be at the top of his game, making movies that were blowing up the box office. However, not everybody was so impressed by him. \"At the height of his career, I was like, 'Ugh, I don't like you. I don't even know you anymore,'\" Kunis admitted to Glamour. Yet, just when their friendship would fall out, the two would become best friends again almost overnight. \"All the time,\" she said — but that wouldn't last long.\n\nIt wasn't until 2012 that Mila Kunis ran into her co-star once again. She was standing backstage at an awards show when she spotted a cutie out of the corner of her eye. \"I was literally, like, 'Oh, he's kind of hot,'\" she explained on the podcast \"WTF with Marc Maron.\" When this male actor turned around, she realized it was none other than Ashton Kutcher himself. \"I thought it was the weirdest thing that I was checking this guy out, and it was somebody I'd known forever,\" she admitted.\n\nTheir encounter obviously wasn't what Kunis expected, but it kicked off a conversation that changed her life completely. It was also the same moment she fell for Kutcher. \"It was literally like if we were in a movie, the music would start playing,\" Kunis later said on \"The Howard Stern Show.\" \"I think that he, for the first time ever, took my breath away.\"\n\nAfter running into each other at an awards show, Ashton Kutcher invited Mila Kunis to his housewarming party to catch up. Little did she know at the time, he was planning to set her up with his friend — but that never ended up happening. The two actors hit it off at his house, and Kunis never went home that night. Yet, starting up a relationship with each other still was never their plan. \"We shook hands. We're like, 'Let's just have fun,'\" Kunis admitted on \"The Howard Stern Show.\"\n\nKutcher and Kunis' top-secret relationship quickly evolved into the real-life version of the movies \"No Strings Attached\" or \"Friends with Benefits\" — both of which they were the stars of. Neither one seemed to think their story would end the same way as their movies did, and boy, were they wrong. \"Clearly we didn't watch the end of either one of our movies,\" Kunis said on \"The Late Late Show with James Corden.\" (Spoiler alert: the characters end up falling in love in the end.)\n\nOnly three months after hooking up at Ashton Kutcher's housewarming party in 2012, Mila Kunis realized that she was starting to develop feelings for her former co-star — which was never part of their agreement. Because of that, it seemed as though their fling was finally coming to an end. \"I walked up to him and was like, 'You know what? I actually care about you, and I don't want to mess anything up,'\" she explained on the podcast \"WTF with Marc Maron.\" After that, Kunis went back home and didn't expect to see much of Kutcher anymore. Yet, the very next day, she heard someone knock on her door. \"He showed up to my house, and he's like, 'Move in with me,'\" she said. \"And I said, 'Okay.'\"\n\nAfter that, their relationship officially became serious — so serious that Kutcher even began asking for her permission about investments he was making. \"He's really smart about including me in everything and making sure that I'm aware of everything that's happening,\" Kunis said on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\" At the time, she even tried to talk him out of investing in companies like Uber and Bitcoin, which sounded like silly ideas to her. \"He's also really smart at knowing that sometimes, you shouldn't listen [to me],\" she later added.\n\nEarly on in 2014, people started noticing that Mila Kunis was rocking a ring on that finger. Since the paparazzi had already proved she had been seeing Ashton Kutcher, it seemed as though they couldn't keep their engagement a secret any longer. Now, fans were freaking out that their favorite characters from \"That '70s Show\" were actually going to get married off-screen. \"The best day of my life so far was the proposal,\" Kunis told Marie Claire later that year. \"I cried. I was a mess.\"\n\nThough no other details have been divulged about this special day, a source told People at the time that Kutcher was planning on proposing for a while. In fact, it was reported that he had talked with Kunis' father the year prior about asking for her hand in marriage. \"It was important to Ashton to be respectful and traditional,\" the source said. \"This is the real thing for him and he wants to do it all right.\" At this point, it was clear to everyone that these two were the real deal.\n\nFor the first time since they had made their debut on \"That '70s Show,\" Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis starred alongside each other once again on another TV series in 2014. While Kutcher was busy working on Season 11 of \"Two and a Half Men,\" his fiancée appeared on an episode playing a woman named Vivian. Fans could almost feel their connection on-screen, too, because funny enough, his character ends up falling in love with her. Yet, what may have been even funnier is one of the conversations the two have during a special scene together. As they're seated around Kutcher's character's kitchen table, they seem to take jabs at their off-screen relationship. \"I'd never date an actress,\" Kutcher tells her. \"They're all crazy.\"\n\nThough Kunis only stars in a single episode of his series, at the time, fans were ecstatic to see the two light up the screen together once again.\n\nOne month after their engagement, Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher shared the news that they were expecting. October 1, 2014, was when they welcomed their daughter Wyatt Isabelle Kutcher into the world.\n\nThough the two were busy actors, a nanny wasn't necessary. They planned to drop everything to be at home with their baby girl. \"I don't eat and breathe acting,\" Kunis told W Magazine at the time. \"I'm sure Meryl Streep has a very different point of view. But I'm excited about being a full-time mom.\" Becoming parents was something these two had always envisioned, and Kunis seemed to be loving every minute she was home with their daughter.\n\nWhile spending all their time with Wyatt was incredible, there was something even more amazing about the experience for Kutcher. \"The most amazing thing about having a baby is my partner, Mila,\" he said on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show.\" \"She's the greatest mom.\"\n\nWhen it came time to plan their wedding, Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher decided to keep it top secret for a very important reason. \"We really didn't want helicopters at our wedding, and it's of legitimate concern,\" Kutcher explained on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show.\" Because of that alone, the two tied the knot in a super-secret ceremony on July 4, 2015.\n\nAs exciting as the announcement was, many were surprised that Kunis ever even got hitched. \"I never wanted to get married,\" the actor admitted to W Magazine. \"From the age of 12, I prepared my parents for no marriage.\" However, everything changed when she fell for Kutcher. \"Now my theory on weddings is: Don't invite anyone. Do it privately and secretly,\" she said. \"My parents are okay with that. They're just excited that I said yes.\"\n\nNot much else is known about the actual ceremony itself, but Kunis did share some information about their rings. \"Our wedding bands are from Etsy,\" she said on \"Conan,\" proving how truly low-key this couple is. According to the actor, her wedding band was only $90 and her husband's was $100 — a steal for any celebrity.\n\nIn true low-profile fashion, Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher decided to take their honeymoon in an RV — a vehicle that Kunis had gifted her husband for his birthday that year. It sounded like a great idea, too — at least, at first. \"If you've ever seen the 'National Lampoon' movies, our honeymoon was like a real-life 'National Lampoon's Honeymoon,'\" Kunis described on \"The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.\" \"I'm not exaggerating. I'm not saying it for a laugh. We also went honeymooning with my in-laws,\" and not to mention their daughter, who was only 10 months old at the time.\n\nAs they started on their trek across the country, their air conditioning broke in 100-degree weather. \"This was like day two,\" Kunis said. Obviously, their trip wasn't off to a great start, and, unfortunately, it only got worse as they went. To take the stress of planning off of her son, Kutcher's mother had made a list of all the RV parks they were going to stay at. However, \"she didn't use the Internet,\" Kunis said. \"She used books.\" By the sixth day, the two gave up on traveling altogether and went home.\n\nWhile their honeymoon may not sound as enjoyable as laying on a beach in Aruba, it's something these stars will surely never forget.\n\nIn 2016, Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher announced they were expecting their second child. After becoming parents two years prior, they felt they were pretty prepared, too — or, at least, they thought they were. \"With the first one, I literally was on the app every day. I was like, 'What fruit size is my baby?' And it's like 'It's the size of a grape. It's the size of an avocado,'\" Kunis said on \"Live with Kelly and Ryan\". \"The other day someone asked me how far along I was, and I was like, 'I have no idea.'\"\n\nThe one thing Kutcher was prepared with was a name for their newborn son: Hawkeye. \"I'm an Iowan, right? Have a kid named Hawkeye,\" he said on \"Conan.\" \"And it's like 'M*A*S*H.' He could be a doctor.\" Unfortunately, his wife didn't like the name much. On November 30 that year, they welcomed their son Dimitri Portwood Kutcher into the world.\n\nFor actors who have spent their entire lives in front of a camera, it wasn't until December 3, 2017, that Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher appeared on the red carpet together for the very first time as a couple. It wasn't for a movie premiere, either. The two attended the 2018 Breakthrough Prize Awards ceremony, which honors those who work in the sciences. While onsite at the NASA Ames Research Center, the two actors even presented an award to one of the many acclaimed scientists in the audience.\n\nKunis showed up in a Dolce & Gabbana dress with a sheer bodice and floral skirt, as her husband accompanied her in a black tuxedo. The happy couple clearly seemed to be enjoying themselves throughout the night, too. As they were smiling for the cameras, Kutcher reportedly whispered something in his wife's ear that made her laugh.\n\nIn the summer of 2019, In Touch Weekly began to report that Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher's marriage was officially ending. The sudden news seemed to surprise everyone — even the couple themselves. \"It's over between us?\" Kutcher hilariously asked his wife in a video on Instagram with the magazine cover in view. According to the outlet's reports, Kunis was feeling \"suffocated\" in their relationship. \"And I took the kids,\" she joked to Kutcher in the video. The article also stated that the split had all started when Kutcher revealed a \"dark secret\" to his wife. It was a secret that was never disclosed, and one that left Kutcher trying to figure out for himself. \"It must have been really dark,\" he said.\n\nObviously, their reported feud was clearly fake news, but the two continued to poke fun at the outlet online. \"Maybe next week my wife will be having twins,\" Kutcher wrote. \"For the third time. But who's counting.\"\n\nMany times throughout Mila Kunis' career, the actor had been offered spots in Super Bowl commercials. Yet, she always had an important reason to say no. \"Every time I've ever been offered a Super Bowl ad it's always a female having to be scantily clad,\" she explained to ET. However, when she and her husband were offered roles in a Cheetos commercial in 2021 — where they would be wearing their everyday clothing instead – they finally had another reason to say yes. \"It was quarantine,\" Kunis said. \"And we were stuck with our children for nine, 12, months at this moment, and I was like, 'Two days, baby! Two days off.'\" Though, let's be clear, they still love their children. \"So, so much!\" Kunis added.\n\nThe two even got to star in the commercial with the singer Shaggy, acting out a spoof of his famous song \"It Wasn't Me.\" In the commercial, it's Kunis who is seen sneaking around — with a bag of Cheetos. In the end, Kutcher catches her, but she denies everything.\n\nFor being famous, both Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher like to keep their life out of the spotlight. Yet, this couple caused an uproar on the Internet shortly after an interview about their children on a podcast called \"Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard.\"\n\nIn a discussion on how often they bathe themselves, Kunis revealed that her family didn't have access to hot water when she was a kid. Because of that, she didn't get to take many baths. \"When I had children, I also didn't wash them every day,\" she explained, which seems understandable to any other parent out there. It wasn't until her husband chimed in that parents all over the planet suddenly became bothered. \"Here's the thing,\" the actor said. \"If you see dirt on them, clean them. Otherwise, there's no point.\"\n\nAfter all of the bathing backlash they received following their interview, the two took to Instagram to hash it out with everyone online. This time, however, they jokingly criticized themselves for bathing their kids too often. \"This bathing thing is out of hand,\" Kutcher wrote.\n\nWhile we all love seeing Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher together, sometimes they need some time apart. If you were hoping to see them in another show again someday soon, it's \"probably not going to happen,\" Kunis said while on \"Today.\"\n\nApparently, these two actors can't seem to keep a straight face when they shoot scenes together. Because they now know each other so well, it's impossible to take the other one seriously on set. \"We can't work together,\" Kunis explained. \"I don't know how people do it.\" It turns out, they were much more comfortable acting together in \"That '70s Show\" when they knew very little about each other.\n\nEven still, there's a more important reason that the two of them will never again share the screen. \"At the end of the day, we don't want to be away from the kids, together, at the same time for a duration of a shoot, which is about 14, 15 hour days,\" Kunis added. For this famous couple, their family will always come first."
