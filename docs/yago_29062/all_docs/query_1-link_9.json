        "text": "Ashton Kutcher, 45, has been happily married to That ’70s Show co-star Mila Kunis, 40, with whom he shares daughter Wyatt, 9, and son Dimitri, 6, since 2015 – but once upon a time, he was married to Bruce Willis‘ ex, Demi Moore. Doesn’t that feel like a lifetime ago?!\n\nThe Punk’d star and the ageless Ghost actress, now 60, met in 2003 and were married from 2005 ’til 2013, causing quite the controversy due to their 15-year age gap! But why did they go their separate ways? Let’s find out a few things they have said about their break-up in the past…\n\nShutterstock\n\nWhat Did Ashton Kutcher And Demi Moore Say About Their Divorce?\n\nIn her 2019 memoir, Inside Out, the G.I. Jane actress confessed that she was struggling with a drinking problem when she and the No Strings Attached actor were married, with reports of Kutcher's infidelity and IVF problems following a miscarriage also being contributing factors to their divorce.\n\nMoore alleged that Kutcher was unfaithful to her on two occasions during their marriage, and recalled a threesome which she then described as a \"mistake\" in her very candid memoir. She wrote: \"I put him first, so when he expressed his fantasy of bringing a third person into our bed, I didn't say no. I wanted to show him how great and fun I could be… They were good people, but it was still a mistake. I was strangely flooded with shame, I couldn't shake the feeling that this whole thing was somehow my fault.\"\n\nShe went on to say that the Just Married actor previously blamed his then wife's openness for his infidelity, adding: \"Because we had brought in a third party into our relationship, Ashton said, that blurred the lines and, to some extent, justified what he's done.\"\n\nShutterstock\n\nMoore And Kutcher Recalled 'Painful' Miscarriage And Fertility Struggles\n\nIn September 2019, the actress went into more detail about the miscarriage she suffered two years into their relationship, as well as their failed attempts to conceive through IVF. \"I can't even bring into words how lost, empty, desperate, confused [I was],\" she said in a candid interview with Diane Sawyer. \"I really lost sight of everything that was right in front of me, which was the family I had. And I think that the weight that it put on Ashton, it's kind of a natural thing to pull back, when somebody's clinging too tight.\""
