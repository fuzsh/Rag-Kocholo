        "text": "Like many Hollywood couples, Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis are incredibly private about their relationship. She doesn't have Instagam, they've never shared photos of their kids, and details about their romance are mostly kept under wraps. But here's what we do know about their history, including their on screen romance and five year marriage, starting with the most recent update...\n\nSeptember 2021 - Mila and Ashton make a rare red carpet appearance at the grand opening of the Lawrence J. Ellison Institute in Los Angeles.\n\nCheck out the rest of their timeline below...\n\n1998 - Mila and Ashton meet on the set of That 70's show when she's 15 and he's 20. In a 2001 interview, Mila revealed her first ever kiss was between their characters Jackie Burkhart and Michael Kelso.\n\nShe told PEOPLE they were practically strangers at the time, but that she had a crush on him: \"I was like, ‘Oh, he's so cute, it's the Calvin Klein model! ...Then I was like, ‘I have to kiss him?' I was so nervous and uncomfortable. I had the biggest crush on him.\"\n\nAshton and Mila, right, with the cast of That 70’s show in 1998\n\n2005 - Ashton left That 70's Show after seven seasons, choosing not to renew his contract for season eight.\n\nSeptember 2005 - Ashton marries actress Demi Moore. According to E! News, the pair met in 2003 through mutual friends. At the time, he was 25 and she was 41. \"You talk about meeting your soul mate. I truly feel I have been given that gift,\" Moore told Harper’s Bazaar in 2005 (via People), before the pair tied the knot in a secret ceremony the following September.\n\nAshton and Demi Moore in 2005\n\nJanuary 2011 - Mila and Macaulay Culkin confirm their split after nine years together, dating from 2002 - 2011. \"We grew up together,\" she told Women's Health of their relationship back in 2009. \"You find a steady rock in your life, and that's all you need. We have our ups and downs, but work through them.\"\n\nMila with Macaulay Culkin\n\nNovember 2011 - Demi announces her separation from Ashton, over an alleged affair with another woman. After confirming their split, Moore shared a statement with E! News that said:\n\n\"As a woman, a mother and a wife there are certain values and vows that I hold sacred, and it is in this spirit that I have chosen to move forward with my life.”\n\nKutcher officially filed for divorce in 2012; the following year in 2013.\n\nJanuary 2012 - the pair bump into each other at the Golden Globes, and Ashton invited Mila to hang out. She told Elle in 2016 of the meeting:\n\n\"We ran into each other at a party, at an award show. So I see this guy, and I see his back, and he's really tall [Kutcher is 6'2; Kunis is 5'4], and I was like who's that tall guy?…And I'm standing there like this, literally like \"Hmm...\" and I'm wearing this big poofy dress, and [I] look[ed] ridiculous, and then he just turns around, and it was like literally, if we were in a movie, the music would just start playing and violins would go. I just went [gasps]. Like, I think he for the first time ever took my breath away....I was like, 'f*ck, he's good looking.'\"\n\nThe night the pair reconnected at the Golden Globes\n\nAshton invited Mila to his housewarming later that month, where they shared a kiss and she stayed the night. She told the podcast WTF with Marc Maron:\n\n\"So then we end up having a lot of talks about how this is a huge mistake and how he needs to go and be single and I need to go and be single. It was super private for a very long time.'\n\n\"It was the first time ever that I ever slept over at a guy's house since becoming single. He didn't let me leave. At 2 in the morning, I was like \"I'm going to call an Uber.\" And he was like, \"You're crazy\" and I was like, \"BYE.\" When I was single, I was so adamant about never staying at a guy's house, that I was like peacing out. And he was like, \"You're not leaving.\" And that was the first time [I didn't.]\"\n\nApril 2012 - After three months of casual dating, the pair make it an official boyfriend/girlfriend thing.\n\nIn 2016, Kunis said to Howard Stern on his show, \"We started dating with the idea we're both never going to get married. [He] just got out of a marriage. I got out of a long relationship. I was single and having the best time ever. I was totally dating, having a great time, and I was like, 'I'm never getting married.' He's like, 'Great, neither am I!' And we're like shaking hands on it and we're like, 'Life is great!' A year later, we're like, 'Tomorrow, let's get married.'\"\n\nFebruary 2013 - The pair are photographed looking cosy at a Lakers Game:\n\nFebruary 2014 - Just over two years after reconnecting (and 16 years after first meeting), Mila and Ashton are engaged! Mila is spotted with a diamond ring on her finger.\n\nMay 2014 - The couple confirm they're expecting their first child together, during Mila's appearance on The Ellen Show. The actress continues to be coy about the gender and due date, though.\n\nSeptember 2014 - Their first child arrives! Congratulations are in order for the birth of their daughter, Wyatt Isabelle Kutcher, who was born at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles.\n\nJuly 2015 - The pair tie the knot with a ceremony in Oak Glen, California. \"Commitment sounded great, but I didn't believe in marriage,\" Mila later explained to Elle. \"I grew up in West Hollywood, and my brother has reminded me that when I was like 12, I said, 'When gay people can get married, then I'll get married.' I was ahead of my time. The Supreme Court decision [on same-sex marriage came down], and that's when Ashton and I got married.\"\n\nNovember 2015 - Ashton shares a glimpse at Wyatt on Instagram:\n\nJune 2016 - The couple reveal they're expecting another baby.\n\nA source close to the couple told E! News on Wednesday they are 'thrilled', commenting, \"They are very excited about baby No. 2. They wanted their kids to be close in age and Wyatt will be just over two when the baby is born,\" they said. \"Ashton and Mila both enjoy parenting and spending time with Wyatt more than anything else, so they are thrilled to be adding to the family.\"\n\nNovember 2016 - Mila and Ashton's second child is born, this time a baby boy. The pair announced his name on A Plus (a digital media platform which counts Kutcher as an investor), revealing Dimitri Portwood Kutcher was born weighing 8 pounds and 15 ounces.\n\nKutcher told the site, “We'd like to allow our kids to make their own choices on whether to have a life in the public eye or not.”\n\nJanuary 2018 - the couple attend the women's march in LA together:\n\nMarch 2018 - Ashton shares a rare selfie of the pair all glammed up together, with the caption, \"Night out with the wife\"\n\nApril 2019 - Ashton plugs one of his investments, datenightvip, with an Instagram caption about his \"love\" alongside a photo with Mila. Sweet. \"My love and I gave @datenightvip a trial run. I think you are in for something special! We have a few openings tonight and tomorrow night in LA. Link in bio.\"\n\nJune 2019 - The couple shut down rumours of a break up with a hilarious Instagram video, which sees Mila reading out the headlines while sitting next to Ashton in the car. \"I guess,\" Ashton wrote on Instagram. \"Maybe next week my wife will be having twins. For the third time. But who’s counting.\n\nMay 2020 - Ashton and Mila took over Jimmy Fallon's show, At Home With Jimmy Fallon, during quarantine.\n\nJuly 2020 - This month, the couple will celebrate their five year wedding anniversary.
