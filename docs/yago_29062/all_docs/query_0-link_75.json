        "text": "Breakups are universally messy, but when they involve two high-profile movie stars and one of them decides to write a memoir, well, it becomes decidedly messier. On September 24, Demi Moore released her memoir, \"Inside Out.\" But even before its debut, excerpts started circulating that contained drama about her 8-year marriage to Ashton Kutcher. Here, a breakdown of where the two stand now.\n\nWhat is Demi and Ashton's history?\n\nMoore and Kutcher met in 2003, publicly debuting their relationship at the premiere of Moore's Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle. Despite headlines about their 16-year age difference, the couple married in 2005.\n\nSix years later, in 2011, the two split. In a statement, Moore said, \"It is with great sadness and a heavy heart that I have decided to end my six-year marriage to Ashton. As a woman, a mother, and a wife there are certain values and vows that I hold sacred, and it is in this spirit that I have chosen to move forward with my life.\" It would be another two years before the proceedings were final.\n\nWhat new drama does Moore reveal in Inside Out?\n\nAfter years of relatively little animosity between the two, excerpts from Moore's forthcoming memoir were published. The actress details how, initially, she had \"never been so happy\" than when with Kutcher. But a year and a half into their relationship, Moore learned she was pregnant. Six months later, she had a miscarriage. In the book, Moore reveals her and Kutcher would've named their daughter Chaplin Ray and told Diane Sawyer on Good Morning America that her later struggles with infertility caused strain on the marriage.\n\nMoore also claims that after 20 years of sobriety, Kutcher, in her mind, encouraged her to drink again. She wrote, \"Ashton was enjoying a glass of good red wine when he said, 'I don’t know if alcoholism is a real thing — I think it's all about moderation.' I wanted to be that girl. The girl who could have a glass of wine at dinner, or do a tequila shot at a party. In my mind, Ashton wanted that, too.\"\n\nAnother thing he angled for was having threesomes in the marriage. She wrote, \"I put him first. So when he expressed his fantasy of bringing a third person into our bed, I didn't say no. I wanted to show him how great and fun I could be.\" Moore later confirmed that, \"There was two different people we opened our relationship to, and they didn't have bad intentions … They were good people, but it was still a mistake.\"\n\nShe said she blamed herself for Kutcher's cheating in San Diego during Danny Masterson's bachelor party, which she found out about via a Google Alert. \"Because we had brought in a third party into our relationship, Ashton said, that blurred the lines and, to some extent, justified what he's done,\" Moore wrote. When he cheated a second time, Moore said Kutcher \"admitted it right away.\"\n\nDid Kutcher actually cheat?\n\nRumors of infidelity plagued Kutcher and Moore's marriage multiple times over the years. However, the most substantial claim came in 2011 when Sara Leal told Us Weekly about her time with Kutcher in San Diego.\n\nInterestingly enough, Scott Eastwood seemingly confirmed the account during an April 2015 appearance on Watch What Happens Live. After Jon Cryer was asked about working with Kutcher on Two and a Half Men after both dated Moore, Eastwood offered his own connection. He revealed that his girlfriend cheated on him with Kutcher and that it was \"the catalyst that broke him (Kutcher) and Demi up.\"\n\nSpeaking of Cryer, he is the first to publicly dispel an account in Moore's memoir. She wrote that her and Cryer began dating while filming 1984's No Small Affair. Moore also opened up about taking Cryer's virginity, a decision she says she regrets. However, Cryer tweeted on Tuesday, \"Well, the good thing about this is she doesn’t have to feel bad about it anymore, because while I’m sure she was totally justified making that assumption based on my my skill level (and the stunned look on my face at the time), I had actually lost my virginity in high school.\" He added, \"But she's right the other part, I was over the moon for her during a very troubled time in her life. I have nothing but affection for her and not a regret in the world.\"\n\nHow has Kutcher responded?\n\nTangling the web further, Kutcher seemingly addressed the subject on Twitter, Tuesday. He wrote, \"I was about to push the button on a really snarky tweet. Then I saw my son, daughter, and wife and I deleted it,\" referencing his wife Mila Kunis and their children, Wyatt, 4 and Dimitri, 2. \"my drafts folder is full of those,\" Monica Lewinsky replied. Kutcher followed that up with a quote from his dad: \"Life is good -Larry Kutcher.\" Soon after he tweeted, \"For truth text me. +1 (319) 519-0576,\" giving the number connected to one of his automated startup projects."
