        "text": "When Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher started dating in 2003, they immediately became one of those Hollywood couples everyone had an opinion about.\n\nShe was 15 years his senior – he was 25, and she was 40 – and had three daughters with her ex-husband Bruce Willis. Their oldest, Rumer, was just 10 years younger than Kutcher.\n\nMoore and Kutcher married in 2005, with Willis among their guests. They had fallen pregnant just prior, however, miscarried six months into the pregnancy.\n\nMoore has since said their relationship was somewhat toxic.\n\n\"When [Kutcher] expressed his fantasy of bringing a third person into our bed, I didn’t say no. I wanted to show him how great and fun I could be,\" she wrote on their alleged threesomes in her memoir Inside Out.\n\nShe also raised allegations that the That '70s Show actor cheated on her with two women towards the end of their marriage. And that he used their previous group-sex encounters to defend that behaviour.\n\n\"Because we had brought a third party into our relationship, Ashton said that blurred the lines and, to some extent, justified what he’d done,\" she wrote.\n\nThe first instance, in 2010, she learned of via media reports that claimed he'd slept with a woman at their home while she was out of town.\n\nThe second, a year later, she learned via a Google alert, media publications reported. This time he'd allegedly cheated with a young woman at a friend's bachelor party.\n\nIt was his and Moore's sixth wedding anniversary weekend.\n\n\"I felt sick to my stomach,\" she wrote about the incident. \"I knew she wasn’t lying.\"\n\nIn 2011, Moore announced she was ending the marriage. Kutcher filed for divorce in 2012, and has remained tight-lipped on the details of their breakup ever since.\n\nBoth have moved onto new relationships – with Kutcher now married to Mila Kunis and Moore having just ended her most recent relationship days after celebrating her 60th birthday.\n\nHere's what their lives look like now.\n\nDemi Moore.\n\nBefore Kutcher, Moore was famously married to Bruce Willis for 13 years.\n\nThe couple have three children: Rumer, born in 1988, Scout born in 1991 (and the famous bump in her mother's now-iconic Vanity Fair nude pregnancy cover shoot), and Tallulah born in 1994.\n\nThe actors have remained close since their marriage ended in 2000.\n\nMoore attended Willis and his now-wife Emma Heming’s wedding and was there again when they renewed their vows in 2019.\n\nIn her memoir, Moore wrote about how proud she is of their divorce and their ability to co-parent their kids.\n\n\"It's a funny thing to say, but I'm very proud of our divorce,\" she said.\n\n\"I think Bruce was fearful at the beginning that I was going to make our split difficult, and that I would express my anger and whatever baggage that I had from our marriage by obstructing his access to the kids – that I'd turn to all of those ploys divorcing couples use as weapons. But I didn't, and neither did he.\"\n\nDuring lockdown in 2020, their family quarantined together in a house in Idaho. They posted photos and videos of themselves reading, posing for photoshoots and bonding outdoors.\n\nFollowing the show, they went their separate ways but came back together after filming almost identical movies – Kutcher, No Strings Attached with Natalie Portman, and Kunis, Friends With Benefits with Justin Timberlake.\n\nBoth movies were released in 2011 and centred on plot lines involving casual sex between friends that turns into something more.\n\nThe same thing then happened to the two actors.\n\n\"We lived our movies out. We were like, let's just hook up. Let's have fun. We're both single. We both trust each other. Everything's great,\" Kunis said on The Late Late Show With James Corden .\n\n\"Just like our movies, one of us caught feelings. We were both seeing other people, so the second I started caring that he was seeing somebody else in that regard, I felt like I got punched in the gut, literally overnight.\"\n\nKunis tried to break things off with Kutcher three months into their fling after realising she was in love with him.\n\nThe next day, he showed up at her house and asked her to move in with him.\n\nIn 2013, Kutcher's divorce was finalised with Moore, and 2014, he and Kunis welcomed their first child, a daughter named Wyatt.\n\nIn 2015, they married in a secret ceremony on a ranch outside of LA. Kutcher told Ellen DeGeneres they used social media to keep paparazzi from finding their location.\n\n\"I was, like, posting things on social media that were in different locations because we didn't want to be screaming our vows at each other and be like, 'Forever! Did you say never?' We didn't want to do that thing, so we went really under the radar with it.\"\n\n\"I never wanted to get married,\" Kunis told W Magazine in 2014.\n\n\"From the age of 12, I prepared my parents for no marriage. Then things changed – I found the love of my life. Now my theory on weddings is: Don’t invite anyone. Do it privately and secretly.\"\n\nThe couple are also private when it comes to their relationship – rarely posting photos together and never of their children.\n\n\"You know, I've learned the hard way how valuable privacy is,\" Kutcher told Elle of that decision.\n\n\"And I've learned that there are a lot of things in your life that really benefit from being private. And relationships are one of them. And I am going to do everything in my power to have this relationship be private.\"\n\nTheir son, Dimitri, was born in 2016.\n\nEarlier this year, Kutcher shared he'd previously had a health scare with a rare autoimmune disease.\n\n\"Like two years ago, I had this weird, super rare form of vasculitis that, like, knocked out my vision, it knocked out my hearing, it knocked out, like, all my equilibrium,\" Kutcher said in a sneak peek of Running Wild with Bear Grylls: The Challenge obtained by Access Hollywood.\n\nVasculitis is a rare autoimmune disorder which involves the inflammation of the blood vessels, resulting in restricted blood flow.\n\nHe said it took him \"about a year\" in order to get back to his healthy, normal self.\n\n\"You don't really appreciate it [your health] until it's gone,\" Kutcher said.\n\n\"Until you go, 'I don't know if I'm ever going to be able to see again, I don't know if I'm ever going to be able to hear again, I don't know if I'm ever going to be able to walk again.' I'm lucky to be alive.\"\n\nBoth Kutcher and Kunis continue to act and are involved in various charities, most recently starting a GoFundMe to help aid refugees fleeing Ukraine.\n\nFeature image: Getty."
