        "text": "Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher are Hollywood A-listers who are raising their family out of the spotlight. However, their love story has always been front and center of their lives, as they both dated and married other celebrities before finally finding their way to each other and celebrating their love with a secret wedding.\n\nThe pair now share an amazingly close bond, and utilize both their strong relationship and its media popularity to do amazing good, such as when they raised millions of dollars for Ukraine.\n\nJoin HELLO! as we investigate all we know about the couple's romance.\n\nHow did Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher meet?\n\nThe two met in 1998 when they began filming hit comedy That '70s Show together. Their characters Jackie Burkhart and Michael Kelso dated, but meanwhile off camera the two were no more than co-stars.\n\nBut even though it was just a work relationship, back in 2001 Mila revealed her first ever kiss was with Ashton when their characters had to kiss on the show. And it turns out the then 14-year-old Mila had a bit of an embarrassing secret regarding the older actor. Talking to People about her first kiss, the actress explained: \"I was like, 'Oh, he's so cute, it's the Calvin Klein model!'\"\n\nBut she continued: \"Then I was like, 'I have to kiss him?' I was so nervous and uncomfortable. I had the biggest crush on him.\"\n\nSEE: Mila Kunis wows in thigh-high boots and blazer dress – we're in awe\n\nNow was not the time for anything to come from this young crush of Mila's. During their time on the show the pair led separate lives, with Mila in a relationship with Macaulay Culkin between 2002 and 2011 and Ashton, who left the show in 2005, marrying Demi Moore that same year.\n\nHowever, in 2011 Ashton and Demi announced they would be getting divorced, with Ashton tweeting: \"I will forever cherish the time I spent with Demi. Marriage is one of the most difficult things in the world and unfortunately sometimes they fail.\"\n\nWhen did Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher become a couple?\n\nMila and Ashton finally made their way towards each other, romantically this time, in 2012. They rekindled their friendship when they bumped into each other at a Golden Globes party, both of them recently single following the break up of their long-term A-list relationships.\n\n\"We ran into each other at a party, at an award show,\" Mila told Elle in 2016. \"So I see this guy, and I see his back, and he's really tall and I was like 'Who's that tall guy?' I'm standing there like this, literally like, 'Hmm... ' and I'm wearing this big poofy dress, and look ridiculous, and then he just turns around, and it was like literally, if we were in a movie, the music would just start playing and violins would go.\"\n\n\"I thought it was the weirdest thing that I was checking this guy out, and it was someone that I had known forever.\" She later told the WTF with Marc Maron podcast.\n\nThe Bad Moms star then admitted that the casual nature of the relationships in the romcoms both actors were starring in at the time initially inspired the pair to keep things casual between themselves too. \"I did a movie called Friends With Benefits. He did a movie that was very similar called No Strings Attached. We lived our movies out,\" Mila told Marc.\n\nREAD: Mila Kunis opens up about protective relationship towards kids with Ashton Kutcher\n\n\"We were just like, 'Let’s just hook up. Let’s have fun. We’re both single. We both trust each other. Everything’s great.'\" But eventually things got more serious, and the couple moved in together in April 2012. They kept their romance private however, and only went public in 2013 at a Lakers game.\n\nWhen did Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher get married?\n\nIn February 2014, Mila was pictured wearing a $250,000 Tiffany's diamond engagement ring. Speaking to Elle Australia in 2016, the actress revealed she doesn't wear it often though, because of its worth.\n\n\"My engagement ring is in a safety deposit box,\" Mila said. \"I'm like, 'I can't wear this because someone's going to chop my hand off for it'\". Instead the 39-year-old opts to wear her $90 wedding band which Ashton bought for her via Etsy.\n\nA year and a bit after their engagement, the pair tied the knot with a ceremony in Oak Glen, California in July 2015. Just like with their friends Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard's relationship, Mila and Ashton waited a little while to get married in order to show their allyship with the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nSpeaking with Elle in 2016, the Black Swan actress explained: \"I grew up in West Hollywood, and my brother has reminded me that when I was like 12, I said, 'When gay people can get married, then I'll get married.' I was ahead of my time. The Supreme Court decision [on same-sex marriage came down], and that's when Ashton and I got married.\"\n\nReferring to the couple's attempt to keep their ceremony private, Ashton told Ellen on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in 2016: \"It was a ninja effort.\"\n\nHe continued: \"We really didn't want helicopters at our wedding and it's a legitimate concern. So we, I was like posting things on social media that were in different locations to avoid. We didn't want to be screaming our vows at each other. And being like 'Forever, did you say never?' We didn't want to do that so we went really under the radar with it.\"\n\nDISCOVER: Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher's eco-farmhouse is truly epic\n\nThe couple's efforts paid off, and they managed to keep their wedding ceremony private before going on a low-key honeymoon road trip across California's Yosemite National Park and Napa Valley.\n\nHow many children do Mila and Ashton have?\n\nMila and Ashton are parents to two children, eight-year-old daughter Wyatt and six-year-old son Dimitri. The two are very rarely pictured, although Ashton and Mila do sometimes share insights into their family life, such as when they recently opened up about how much they've protected their children from news of the war in Ukraine.\n\n\"Children's brains, as beautiful and rich as they are, aren't capable of digesting this amount of information all at once,\" Mila told People. \"So we give them enough to understand what's happening in the world without the details. Do they know that these two countries are at war? Yes. Do they know innocent people are dying? Yes.\"\n\nShe continued: \"But we don't watch the news with them. They don't need the visuals. We just want them to understand the world is bigger than they are.\"\n\nIn March 2023, the couple created headlines when they revealed they were not intending to leave their children any inheritance. \"We'll end up giving our money away to charity and to various things,\" Ashton told his friend Dax Shepard during an appearance on his podcast.\n\nWhere do Mila and Ashton live?\n\nMila and Ashton live with their two children in an eco-farmhouse near Beverly Hills. The six-acre property was first designed in the 1930s, before getting renovated in the 1980s.\n\nAlongside the main building the home also boasts an 'entertainment barn', which features 19-foot high sliding doors and an extravagant crystal chandelier that takes up most of the ceiling. The sprawling property also has a barbecue pavilion next to the family's swimming pool, which was topped with quirky floating pool chairs.\n\nSpeaking about their home, Mila explained to Architectural Digest: \"We wanted a home, not an estate.\" Ashton agreed, adding: \"We wanted the house to look like an old barn, something that had been here for decades, that was then converted into a house. But it also had to feel modern and relevant.\"\n\nIn 2017 they also splashed out $10million on a six-bedroom, six-bathroom beach house in Santa Barbara, California. The oceanfront home is just a short two hour drive away from their home in Beverly Hills so is within easy reach for a short break or weekend away.\n\nIn April 2023, the couple traveled to the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles in order to make a rare red carpet appearance together at the 9th Annual Breakthrough Prize Ceremony.\n\nDid Mila and Ashton split up?\n\nDespite what media outlets reported in 2019, the couple have never split since they began their relationship in 2012. The happy couple shut down break-up rumors in the best way they know how and that was with a satirical Instagram video, shot from their car."
