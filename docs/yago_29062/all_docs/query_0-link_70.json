        "text": "Ashton Kutcher has revealed why he was angry after his ex-wife Demi Moore released her memoir.\n\nThe actor, who is now married to Mila Kunis, said he was frustrated with the timing of the book.\n\nThis was due to the fact he had “finally gotten to a place where the press had really laid off me and Mila and my life and my family”.\n\nMoore released Inside Out in September 2019.\n\nIn it, she shared personal stories about her relationship with the actor, which started when he was 25. Moore was in her 40s at the time.\n\n“I was f***ing pissed,” Butterfly Effect actor Kutcher said of the book in a new interview with Esquire.\n\nHe added that “the next day”, following its release, members of the media “were at my kids’ school”.\n\nDespite his anger at the time, he maintains that he has no “hard feelings” for Moore, whom he divorced in 2013.\n\nAfter marrying the Ghost star, he became stepfather to the three children she shares with Bruce Willis: Rumer, Scout and Tallulah.\n\n“I was 26, bearing the responsibility of an eight-year-old, a 10-year-old, and a 12-year-old,” he said in the interview.\n\nKutcher married Kunis in 2013. They have two children together: Wyatt, eight, and Dimitri, six.\n\nElsewhere in the interview, the actor addressed the rape allegations made against his former That '70s Show and The Ranch co-star Danny Masterson."
