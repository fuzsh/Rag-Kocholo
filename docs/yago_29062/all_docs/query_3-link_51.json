        "text": "Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis are one of Hollywood’s most notoriously private couples.\n\nThe actors have been married for seven years and have two young children together. Yet, they’re rarely photographed together.\n\nWATCH: Here are some of the celebrity couples we didn’t know existed! Post continues after video.\n\nVideo by Mamamia\n\nThat said, their relationship story reads like a plot line straight from a movie. Specifically, their movies No Strings Attached and Friends With Benefits.\n\nFrom meeting as teenagers and having their first kiss televised, to the relationship breakups that led them to each other, keep scrolling for a deep dive into Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis’ ultra private relationship.\n\nAshton Kutcher, Mila Kunis and That 70s Show.\n\nLike most celebrity couples, Kutcher and Kunis (which sounds like it should be the name of their own show) met at work on the 1998 TV series That 70s Show.\n\nTheir characters Jackie Burkhart and Michael Kelso were an on-screen couple – as Kutcher said in a 2017 interview on The Howard Stern Show, their “first kiss was memorialised on a TV show”. (You can watch the very scene below.)\n\nBoth have always said there was nothing going on between them while they were working together.\n\n“I say this not as a joke, but [he] literally did my chemistry homework. I thought he was fine, he was a nice guy, we worked together and sometimes he’d drop me off at home,” Kunis, 37, told NBC’s Sunday Sitdown With Willie Geist in 2018.\n\n“It wasn’t until years later at an awards show I saw him again. He just turned around and it was literally like if we were in a movie, the music would’ve started playing and the violins would’ve gone. I think for the first time ever he took my breath away — I was like f**k, he’s good-looking.”\n\nKutcher, 43, added, “We’ve known each other for 20 years. I was 19, she was like 14. I did her chemistry homework for her. I think I was her first kiss, like, on the show.”\n\n“It was really weird. I was like, ‘Isn’t this illegal? Like can I — am I allowed? It was really awkward because I’m like a 19-year-old kid. She was like my little sister. I wanted to make sure she was OK.”\n\nAshton Kutcher and Mila Kunis’ previous relationships.\n\nAfter That 70s Show, Kutcher and Kunis went their separate ways, but stayed in touch online throughout their twenties.\n\nA then-18-year-old Kunis started dating Home Alone child star Macauley Culkin, who was 21 at the time. They dated for eight years, and managed to keep their relationship private from the media.\n\nIn interviews, Kunis has said they “grew up together,” but that their 2011 breakup was her fault, despite both their reps saying it was amicable.\n\n“It was a horrible, horrible breakup… I f**ked up,\" she told Dax Shephard on his Armchair Expert podcast in 2018.\n\n“I was an a**hole in my 20s and I’ll be the first to admit it. And that’s something that took me a long time to come out and be like, ‘Yeah, you know what, I was a d**k,’ and accept it and I own it now.”\n\n“It’s f*cked up what I did and it’s f*cked up how I did it. When I got to be a single I said, ‘I just need to figure myself out.’ I genuinely need to know why I did what I did, and, like, regroup myself as a human being.”\n\nThey married in a kabbalah ceremony in 2005, with Willis among the guests. During their six-year marriage, Moore and Kutcher fell pregnant before miscarrying. In Moore’s recent memoir, she opened up about their somewhat toxic relationship.\n\n“When he expressed his fantasy of bringing a third person into our bed, I didn’t say no. I wanted to show him how great and fun I could be,\" she wrote on their alleged threesomes.\n\nIn 2011, Moore announced she was ending the marriage, following allegations that Kutcher had been unfaithful. Kutcher filed for divorce in 2012, and has remained tight-lipped on the details of their breakup ever since. In 2013, he told Elle, \"There are some things that are better left private\"\n\nFrom 'just hooking up' to their secret wedding.\n\nThe story of how Kutcher and Kunis finally got together is one they've both told the media many times.\n\nBoth had just finished working on two films that were basically the same movie - he, No Strings Attached with Natalie Portman, and she, Friends With Benefits with Justin Timberlake.\n\nBoth movies were released in 2011 and centred on plot lines involving casual sex between friends that turns into something more. So, they decided to live out their fictional characters.\n\n\"We lived our movies out. We were like, let's just hook up. Let's have fun. We're both single. We both trust each other. Everything's great,\" Kunis told The Late Late Show With James Corden.\n\n\"Just like our movies, one of us caught feelings. We were both seeing other people, so the second I started caring that he was seeing somebody else in that regard, I felt like I got punched in the gut, literally overnight.\n\nThe story goes, she then tried to break things off with Kutcher three months into their fling after realising she was \"in love\" with him. The next day, Kutcher showed up at her house and asked her to move in with him.\n\nFrom there, things moved pretty quickly. So quickly, Kunis has been quoted as saying: \"Six months later we're, like, married and had a kid.\"\n\nIn 2014, the couple welcomed their first child, daughter Wyatt. The following year, Kutcher and Kunis married in a secret ceremony on a ranch outside of LA. Kutcher told Ellen DeGeneres they used social media to keep paparazzi from finding their location.\n\n\"I was, like, posting things on social media that were in different locations because we didn't want to be screaming our vows at each other and be like, 'Forever! Did you say never?' We didn't want to do that thing, so we went really under the radar with it.\"\n\nKunis also spoke about the wedding with W Magazine in 2014, saying: “I never wanted to get married. From the age of 12, I prepared my parents for no marriage. Then things changed — I found the love of my life. Now my theory on weddings is: Don’t invite anyone. Do it privately and secretly. My parents are OK with that.”\n\nThe couple are fairly private when it comes to their relationship - Kunis doesn't have Instagram, and Kutcher posts wholesome photos sporadically on his. They're rarely photographed together, except at basketball games and on the occasional red carpet.\n\n\"You know, I've learned the hard way how valuable privacy is,\" he told Elle of their decision to maintain their privacy.\n\n\"And I've learned that there are a lot of things in your life that really benefit from being private. And relationships are one of them. And I am going to do everything in my power to have this relationship be private.\n\nWhilst the pair are in the public eye, it's not often we get a glimpse into their life together. This week, Kutcher shared a photo of his wife on Instagram with the caption, \"Luckiest man alive.\"\n\nAshton Kutcher and Mila Kunis as parents.\n\nKunis and Kutcher have two kids together, six-year-old Wyatt Isabelle and their four-year-old son Dimitri, who was born in 2016.\n\nIn 2022, during an interview on Armchair Expert podcast with Dax Shepard, the couple shared that they don't bathe their kids every day.\n\n\"When I had children, I also didn’t wash them every day,\" said Kunis. \"I wasn’t that parent that bathed my newborns – ever.\"\n\nKucher added, \"Now, here’s the thing. If you can see the dirt on them, clean them. Otherwise, there’s no point.\"\n\nThe pair also said they don’t wash their own bodies with soap every day.\n\n\"I didn’t have hot water growing up as a child so I didn’t shower very much anyway,\" Kunis explained.\n\n\"I wash my armpits and my crotch daily, and nothing else ever,\" added Kutcher.\n\n\"I do have a tendency to throw some water on my face after a workout to get all the salts out.\"\n\nOf the kind of parents they are, Kunis has previously said she and Kutcher are quite goofy with their kids.\n\n\"I think that’s just [us] being idiots. We’re very comfortable with ourselves acting a fool at home, but maybe that comes from the idea of being comfortable in your own body, and in your own skin, and in your mind and not having a fear of making a fool of yourself.\"\n\nAs for what makes them such a great couple, she believes \"it truly is all about being able to be honest.\" And laughter.\n\n\"I will say he makes me laugh every day. Sixty years from now, when we're in our rocking chairs and I'm wearing a muumuu, I hope he's still around and I'm still giggling, because the greatest gift you can give is making each other laugh.\"\n\nWhen asked about their parenting fails, Kunis told Ellen DeGeneres' Mom Confessions web series she told her oldest, Wyatt Isabelle, to 'push back' when shoved in the playground, and say \"no thank you\".\n\n\"There was a little kid in my kid's preschool that wasn't very kind and pushed my daughter,\" she explained. \"My daughter came back and was like, 'Such and such little kiddo pushed me.' And I instinctually said, 'Did you push her back?' And my daughter's like, 'No!' \"\n\nKunis went on to explain the memory of \"seeing Ashton's face and he's like, 'No!'\"\n\n\"You stand up for yourself and say no thank you,\" she recalled telling her oldest child. \"Don't push her off of a ladder, off of a swing or off of a slide, but on the ground, Even Steven, you push her back.\"\n\n\"I'd say that that's a parenting fail.\"\n\nThis article was originally published on May 29, 2020 and has since been updated with new information.\n\nFeature Image: Instagram @aplusk."
