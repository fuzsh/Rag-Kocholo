Kutcher explained that their letters were not ever intended to \"question the legitimacy of the judicial system or the validity of the juryâ€™s ruling...[or] to undermine the testimony of the victims or retraumatize them in any way.\"\n\n\"We support victims. We have done this historically through our work and will continue to do so in the future,\" the pair further insisted at the time.\n\nMasterson was ultimately sentenced to 30 years to life in prison.\n\nKutcher later stepped down from the board of Thorn, an anti-child sex abuse organization he co-founded."
