        "text": "ASHTON Kutcher has testified at the trial of Michael Gargiulo, the man charged with the 2001 murder of a woman the actor had been seeing, named Ashley Ellerin.\n\nKutcher, who has since been married twice and welcomed two kids into the world, relived one of the most horrific experiences - but what really happened, how old is the actor and who is his wife?\n\nHow old is Ashton Kutcher?\n\nAshton Kutcher is 41 years old.\n\nHe was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on February 7, 1978.\n\nAnd to one's surprise, Ashton has German, Irish and Czech ancestry.\n\nAshton married Demi Moore in 2005, but the couple divorced in 2013.\n\nHe is now married to actress Mila Kunis.\n\nWhen did he date Ashley Ellerin?\n\nAshton Kutcher was romantically involved with 22-year-old Ashley Ellerin in 2001.\n\nOn May 29, 2019, the Two and a Half Men star testified at the trial of former plumber Michael Gargiulo, who has been charged with the murder of Ellerin.\n\nAshton explained that he had spoken with Ashley on February 22, 2001, and they both agreed to meet up for a date at her home later that evening.\n\nBy the time the father-of-two arrived at the property two hours later, he noted how the lights in Ashley’s home were on and her front door was locked.\n\nShe hadn’t answered the doorbell, leading Kutcher to peer through the window where he saw “what I thought was a red wine spilled on the carpet”.\n\nWhat Ashton didn’t know was that the \"red wine\" spilled on the floor was actually Ashley’s blood.\n\n“I didn’t really think anything of it,'' he said.\n\nThe Hollywood star left the property figuring he'd \"screwed up\" by showing up late, and he assumed Ellerin had gone out with a friend.\n\nBut he found out the next day that the woman he had arranged to go on a date with had been killed.\n\nHer roommate discovered Ashley’s body the following day, with prosecutors noting how the fashion design student had been brutally stabbed 47 times.\n\nMichael Gargiulo, who is nicknamed as the Hollywood Ripper, is on trial at Los Angeles superior court for a total of three murders between 1993 and 2008 in Illinois and California.\n\nHe is also being accused of attempting to kill another woman in Los Angeles between 2001 and 2008.\n\nDistrict Attorney Dan Akemon told the jury: “What you will hear is that Michael Gargiulo for almost 15 years was watching and waiting.\n\n\"His hobby was to wait for the perfect opportunity to attack women in and around their homes.\n\n\"Ashley Ellerin led a glamorous life. She was a beautiful 22-year-old fashion student who socialised with the Hollywood crowd.\"\n\nHow did Ashton meet his wife, Mila Kunis?\n\nAshton Kutcher met Mila Kunis while working together on the set of That ‘70s Show, the hit US sitcom which ran from 1998 until 2006.\n\nInterestingly enough, the two never dated while taping the TV programme, and instead waited until 2012 when both stars had parted ways with their partners.\n\nMila had called it quits with ex-boyfriend Macaulay Culkin while Ashton and Demi Moore were in the process of divorcing.\n\nThe couple became engaged in February 2014 and were married by July, 2015.\n\nIn October, 2014, Kunis gave birth to the couple’s first child - Wyatt Isabelle - before welcoming Dimitri Portwood two years later in 2016.\n\nWhat has Ashton starred in?\n\nAshton made his name in That '70s Show as Michael Kelso from 1998-2006.\n\nHe went on to star in Two and a Half Men from 2011 until 2015 before joining Netflix sitcom The Ranch in 2016.\n\nHe's also starred in movies Dude, Where's My Car (2000), Just Married (2003), A Lot Like Love (2005) and Jobs (2013)."
