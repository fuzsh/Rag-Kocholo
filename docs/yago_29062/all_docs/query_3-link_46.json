These are the seemingly unanswerable questions that keep us up at night. But, it appears we might finally have some answers…at least to the first query. According to People, yes, Mila and Ashton are officially husband and wife.\n\nSources say the couple (who are parents to baby Wyatt) married this weekend in typical, super secret celeb wedding style, waiting to reveal details about the location until 24 hours before the event. The twosome has yet to confirm the news, but considering the fact that they’ve been teasing us for months—wearing suspiciously wedding-band-ish-looking rings, signing holiday greetings “the Kutchers,” and playing it coy when asked directly—I think we can safely consider this relationship on lock down.\n\nThey’ll just have to let us know when we can whip out our That ’70s Show DVDs to celebrate their anniversary.\n\nSOURCE: ELLE.COM\n\n**Related Links:\n\n**Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher’s engagement announcement is so adorable\n\nMila Kunis has given birth to a girl"
