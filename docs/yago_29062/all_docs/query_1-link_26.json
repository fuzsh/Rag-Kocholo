        "text": "Yeah, with Hollywood marriages, they are usually so short. Ashton is 27 and Demi is in her early 40s.....I wonder how long that will last??\n\n*playing the violin* They wont last long. I am suprised they dated a long time and now they got married? They wont last long.\n\nnot to mention Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck dating for only 6 months and are already enaged.\n\n*shooks head*\n\ncelebrities always take their marriages WAY too fast than regualr people do.\n\nI loveeeeeeeeeee Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher (MMMmmmm.. He is sure a great looking guy) I'm glad to see them married, They're a perfect match in heaven, and also make an awesome couples.\n\nAll what I say is: Wish them best of good luck.\n\nAs long as they are happy that's fine.\n\nCheri said:\n\nI loveeeeeeeeeee Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher (MMMmmmm.. He is sure a great looking guy) I'm glad to see them married, They're a perfect match in heaven, and also make an awesome couples.\n\nOh, excuse me a moment.\n\nJust kidding, Cheri. I dislike Ashton Kutcher and just cannot stand him. I don't really have a good reason, except for \"Punk'd.\"\n\nI do think this will be just another short Hollywood marriage, though.\n\nSteel said:\n\nnot to mention Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck dating for only 6 months and are already enaged.\n\n*shooks head*\n\ncelebrities always take their marriages WAY too fast than regualr people do.\n\nAren't they married now??\n\nSteel said:\n\nugh...so much for him marrying older women.\n\nWell, who wouldn't want to marry Demi Moore? Even in her current age, she's a hot and intelligent babe.\n\nCONGRATULATIONS BOTH OF THEM, WISH THEM NOTHING BUT THE BEST\n\n(i m impressed with demi moore she is 42 and her looking younger than that, also Ashton is 27 same mine he looks not younger for demi moore )\n\nIm happy for them and do wish them lifetime of happy marriage bliss. I also love watching them as actors. It doesn't bother me how many years difference they are. Usually the man is older, but more and more younger men marry older women. Well...I'm one of them. My husband is more than 4 years younger than me. smile\n\nAwesome! Another May/December marriage. To their credit, they stuck it out long as bf/gf. Personally I thought I would throw up if I had to hear one more news of marriage between a way older man and a younger chick, so this is a nice change of pace.\n\nMagatsu said:\n\nWell, who wouldn't want to marry Demi Moore? Even in her current age, she's a hot and intelligent babe.\n\nOkay, she IS good looking but I wouldn't want to marry her. Allright, you knew you left yourself open for that one.\n\nVamPyroX said:\n\nOh dear, not again.\n\nI won't be surprised if Demi gets pregnant again and poses nude for Vanity Fair again.\n\ncut that picture from the front of magazine and put it in nice wooden frame. Hang it up at your bedroom.\n\nNancy said:\n\nThey apparently are very happier couples. Some men like to go out with older women due to more mature and honest.\n\nAmerican Chopper and I are 7 years apart. We have been together for 7 years as we do love each other very much."
