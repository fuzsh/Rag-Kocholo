        "text": "They were the couple who inspired every single woman who thought she was too old to be sexy and attractive to younger men. They made it acceptable for an older woman and a younger man to fall madly in love. And pictures of them always made us happy and hopeful. But now, Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore are officially divorced. What went wrong? Not knowing the facts, here is my opinion.\n\nKutcher met Moore when he was 25 and she was 41. Two years later they got married. When I think about how much I changed from 25 to 41, I can’t even imagine how many potential issues this couple had, just because of how much growth Kutcher would go through over the next decade and a half. Marriage is hard enough for ANY couple. Factor in such a large age gap, and you are already starting at somewhat of a disadvantage.\n\nIn my opinion, people in their 20’s are still trying to figure out life. I did really stupid things in my 20’s. I changed careers several times, I dated all the wrong men, and basically had my priorities in bad order. I’m not saying that’s the case for Kutcher or anyone else in their 20’s, I just 20s are a time to make a lot of mistakes, and attempt to figure out a lot of things.\n\nNow, let’s address life at 41. I was recently separated at 41, and sure, I was insecure and it wasn’t the happiest of times in my life. But, as I got into my forties, I became more comfortable in my skin, I had self assurance I didn’t have as a younger woman, and I was just smarter, not making emotional decisions like I did when I was younger.\n\nAt 41, Moore was a divorced mom who had gone from a Hollywood star to a peaceful, family life. (which I think is selfless and admirable.) So, what did she really have in common with Kutcher, who was just beginning his career? Professionally, he was where she was 15 years earlier.\n\nI’m by no means minimizing what they had. They really seemed like they were in love for a long, long time. But, like they introduced the world to the older-woman younger-man relationship, they are now showing us that maybe these relationships have a shelf life. Maybe as we grow, the age difference becomes more pronounced and less manageable.\n\nAll that said, even if they were 3 years apart instead of 16, they could have drifted apart and broken up. Men and women cheat and leave each other regardless of how many years apart they are in age. There are no guarantees that a relationship is going to last forever even when the couple are close in age or the same age.\n\nHere’s the part that kind of bothers me. I just read that “sources say Ashton is thinking of getting engaged to Mila Kunis.” This to me is just another example of someone rushing into another marriage too soon. Why do people do that??\n\nListen, I LOVE Mila Kunis and I think she and Ashton are an adorable couple. And I wouldn’t be surprised if they ended up together. But why does it have to happen tomorrow? Secondly, these could just be rumors, and maybe the couple will wait. I hope they do.\n\nAs far as Demi, I have a prediction. I have loved her since I saw her in “St. Elmo’s Fire” and “About Last Night.” I think she is drop dead gorgeous, I think she’s smart and she’s a great actor. I have a feeling she will reinvent herself and do something really special. I don’t think her fans have ever forgotten about her. And lastly, I think she will find love again. I really, really do.\n\nKutcher will continue to thrive. He can’t make enough great rom coms. And honestly, Kunis will do the same.\n\nBut there is a part of me that will never forget the blissful Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore. They gave us the fairytale we all wanted, and they showed us that age is just a number when it comes to falling in love, but sadly, that happily ever after might have an expiration date."
