        "text": "i dont see why everybody is so 'anti youth'........just because everybody in the history of the world has taken a step back after they reach the 40 mark, doesnt mean that nobody in the future cant.\n\npeople nowdays are living longer, looking younger for longer thanks to cosmetics and surgery so why is 'fun' supposed to be only for a certain age bracket\n\nage is a number not a lifestyle\n\nthere is a difference between thinking young - taking care of yourself etc and acting your age... demi is not 22 she has daughters to take care of and with her \"come back\" if you can call it that is ending up looking desperate and silly.\n\ni admire someone who can look amazing as they get older but while doing it appropriately.\n\nyes i think she ends up looking like an idiot.... clubbing...going out to a trendy restaurant or bar fine but i already feel like an idiot going to the hot spot places in my city as i approach 30... i just think, what am i doing here? i would rather sit with friends or my man dressed up at dinner at party or some sort of function not with pressed up bodies with blasting techno music, i already suffered through that! ker older daugther could go to these places...but that is just me..... as an outsider I think she looks silly....or like she is forcing it. It is ASHTON KUTCHER for godsake! I cannot help but laugh when I see him with those stupid oversized truck driver hats on sideways with her strolling down the streetâ€¦. Funny stuff. I have more respect for people that can age gracefully and stay married in Hollywood. ....\n\nOriginally posted by lele@Sep 20th, 2003 - 8:49 pm\n\ni already feel like an idiot going to the hot spot places in my city as i approach 30... i just think, what am i doing here?\n\nso where are you supposed to go after you're 30 then?\n\nthere's no reason you cant fit into clubs or bars or whatever over 40......\n\nlets face it.....the 20 somethings who hang out at the 'trendy' bars are the ones who cant really afford to be there....\n\nOriginally posted by Acid@Sep 20th, 2003 - 5:02 pm\n\nso where are you supposed to go after you're 30 then?\n\nthere's no reason you cant fit into clubs or bars or whatever over 40......\n\nlets face it.....the 20 somethings who hang out at the 'trendy' bars are the ones who cant really afford to be there....\n\nI don't know, I guess you move on with your life!! I'm not saying it's \"out to pasture\" time, but it seems kind of time-warpish to still be hanging around in your 40s doing the exact same thing you did in your 20s!\n\nEverything about Demi lately is shrieking \"I'm not old! I'm still hot! I'm still hip!\"...frankly, she's trying TOO HARD!\n\n~~Kim"
