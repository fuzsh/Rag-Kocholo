        "text": "Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis have a true Hollywood love story.\n\nThe couple first met as costars on That '70s Show, where they played on-again, off-again couple Jackie Burkhart and Michael Kelso, but it would take nearly 15 more years before they started dating off-camera.\n\nStill, Kunis and Kutcher's co-star, Debra Jo Rupp, saw there was a \"spark\" between the two before they got together.\n\n\"There was this little reunion, and I remember watching it,\" Rupp told Access Hollywood in January 2023. \"It was quite a while after '70s Show had ended, and there was kind of a little spark thing that was happening with Mila and Ashton. I caught that — I absolutely caught that.\"\n\nFast forward a few years, and the pair is now happily married with two kids. They regularly make headlines for their honest commentary on parenting and generous donations to humanitarian causes. In March 2022, Kutcher and Kunis helped raise more than $30 million in donations for Ukrainian refugees following Russia's invasion.\n\nFrom starring together on That '70s Show to turning a \"friends with benefits\" arrangement into a long-lasting marriage, here is a complete timeline of Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis' relationship.\n\nAugust 23, 1998: Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis meet as castmates on That '70s Show, where they share their first kiss\n\nKutcher and Kunis met on the set of That '70s Show back when Kunis was 14 years old and Kutcher was 20. Kunis played Jackie Burkhart while Kutcher played Michael Kelso, and their characters dated on and off throughout the series.\n\nIn 2001, Kunis revealed to PEOPLE that not only did she and Kutcher have their first kiss during the show, but it was also her first kiss ever.\n\n\"I was like, 'Oh, he's so cute, it's the Calvin Klein model!' \" she said. \"Then I was like, 'I have to kiss him?' I was so nervous and uncomfortable. I had the biggest crush on him.\"\n\nKunis went on to say that Kutcher put her at ease by making jokes and giving \"funny little compliments.\"\n\nThe actor was also nervous about the kiss. \"I'm the first she kissed? Oh my god, I had no idea!\" he said in 2001. \"I'm so glad I didn't know that or it would've been too much pressure.\"\n\nKutcher added, \"I was so nervous. She acted so cool. She seemed as if she'd done it a thousand times. I was the one with the butterflies in my stomach. I mean, here's this little girl and I have to kiss her. It was nerve-racking.\"\n\nSeptember 24, 2005: Ashton Kutcher marries Demi Moore\n\nAfter That '70s Show wrapped, Kutcher and Kunis went their separate ways, and in 2005, Kutcher married actress Demi Moore.\n\nJanuary 3, 2011: Mila Kunis and then-boyfriend Macaulay Culkin break up\n\nMeanwhile, Kunis had been dating her then-boyfriend, Macaulay Culkin, for eight years.

I was literally like, 'Oh, he's kinda hot' … and then he turned around, and I was like, 'Oh my god, it's Kutch.' \"\n\nShe added, \"I thought it was the weirdest thing that I was checking this guy out, and it was someone that I had known forever.\"\n\nJanuary 2012: Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis have their first off-screen kiss\n\nAfter reuniting, Kutcher invited Kunis to his housewarming party in the Hollywood Hills. However, both stars have slightly different memories about what happened that night.\n\nDuring an appearance on The Howard Stern Show, Kutcher discussed their first kiss and said, \"I think I was smoking cigarettes at the time, and I was still a smoker. And she had quit smoking and she was like, she wanted me to like shotgun cigarette smoke so she could breathe it in and I was like, 'All right.' \"\n\nHe added, \"And gradually through the night, it got closer and closer and closer … It was kind of obvious that things were happening.\"\n\nKunis told her version of the night during an appearance on The Late Late Show. \"I found out later in life that my husband was trying to set me up on a blind date with one of his friends that night,\" Kunis explained. \"So he was like 'come over' and he had a friend he wanted to set me up with and that didn't happen.\"\n\nEarly 2012: Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis start casually dating\n\nAfter the party, Kutcher and Kunis started casually seeing each other.

Everything's great,\" she said during an appearance on the WTF with Marc Maron podcast.\n\nApril 2012: Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis move in together\n\nDespite their casual start, the couple's relationship quickly turned serious, and they moved in together in 2012.\n\nKunis later said she developed actual feelings for Kutcher \"overnight\" and decided to voice them.\n\n\"I felt like I got punched in the gut, literally overnight,\" she said. \"I was like, you know what, I actually care about you. I don't want to mess anything up so I'm just going to walk away before it becomes too much. And he was like, 'Got it.' And the next day, he showed up to my house and he was like, 'Move in with me,' and I said 'OK.' \"\n\nFebruary 2014: Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis get engaged\n\nAfter Kunis was spotted walking around with a diamond ring on her finger, PEOPLE confirmed that the two were engaged.\n\nA source told PEOPLE that Kutcher had asked Kunis' dad for his blessing around Christmas. \"It was important to Ashton to be respectful and traditional,\" the insider said. \"This is the real thing for him and he wants to do it all right.\"\n\nThe source added that they didn't want to wait too long to get married, saying, \"This relationship started on solid ground and everything is working out.

But it's just such a bummer that we missed out on 20 years together.
