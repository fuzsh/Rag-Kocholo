        "text": "Since their days on That ’70s Show, Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis have come a long way. The pair met on set in 1998 and maintained a solid friendship for more than a decade before they actually began dating in 2012 (Kutcher was previously married to Demi Moore, but the pair called it quits in 2011 after six years of marriage). The former costars now share two young children, support countless social causes, and own a number of covetable homes in Southern California together. “To feel tranquility in a space, everything needs to be in order,” Kutcher previously told Architectural Digest, referring to the importance of creating a comfortable space to nest in. “If the world around you isn’t in order, it’s hard to get your brain in order. When we’re in our home, the world just makes sense.” Below, we’ve rounded up some of the couple’s better-known properties, places they’ve returned to time and again to find that peace of mind.\n\n2009\n\nWhile Kutcher was still married to his ex, he co-purchased a home in Hollywood Hills with his then stepdaughter Rumer Willis. The pair paid $971,500 for the two-bedroom, four-bathroom ranch-style property. The home spanned 1,800 square feet and sat behind a wood gate and tall hedges. Little else is known about the residence, but in 2018, Kutcher officially granted his 50% share of the home to Willis with a filing stating that “all debt owing under the note, deed of trust, and any related loan documents has been deemed paid and satisfied in full.” Property records show that the house was sold for $572,500 around that same time.\n\n2012\n\nFollowing his split from Moore, Kutcher paid $3.64 million for a Hollywood Hills home that he had been renting for $50,000 a month. (Reports around that time speculated that Justin Bieber was also interested in the property.) The modern three-story mansion was built in 2007 and featured five bedrooms and eight bathrooms spread out across nearly 9,400 square feet. The steel-and-glass structure had a double-height living room with a fireplace, floor-to-ceiling glass windows, wood-paneled guest rooms, and spacious outdoor patios. Amenities included a gym, a sauna, a wine cellar, and an infinity pool and spa with views of the Hollywood sign. Kutcher didn’t hold onto the house for too long. He sold the property for $9.925 million in 2014.\n\n2014\n\nKunis and Kutcher got engaged in early 2014 and picked up a $10.2 million home in Beverly Hills shortly after. The East Coast–inspired residence measured 7,351 square feet, with five bedrooms and five-and-a-half bathrooms spread across two floors. The picturesque home featured dark hardwood floors, French windows, and a chef’s kitchen seemingly straight out of a Nancy Meyers film, complete with a cozy breakfast nook with a built-in banquette. Out back, a kidney-shaped swimming pool and raised spa overlooked stunning views of the mountains. The couple listed the place for $12.25 million in 2020 and ultimately sold it for $10.4 million in early 2022.\n\nJoin Now\n\nBecome an AD PRO member for only $25 $20 per month.\n\nArrow\n\n2015\n\nPerhaps the couple’s best-known property is their sustainable modern farmhouse, dubbed “KuKu Farms,” where they currently live. The pair designed and built the LA home from the ground up with the help of architect Howard Backen and interior designer Vicky Charles. Both Kunis and Kutcher had a heavy hand in the intense five-year process. “We wanted a home, not an estate,” Kunis told AD when we toured the home last year. Added Kutcher, “We wanted the house to look like an old barn, something that had been here for decades, that was then converted into a house. But it also had to feel modern and relevant.” Sustainability was also key. The result was a main house built from reclaimed wood, concrete, and glass, completely powered by solar energy, and a farm that the couple utilizes to grow crops like corn. Charles also made sure to incorporate elements from the couple’s previous homes, including a set of custom silver throne chairs that Kutcher had commissioned from India and a 10-foot-long crystal chandelier that was installed in a barn turned entertainment pavilion. “We thought it would be funny to have this incredibly opulent thing hanging in a barn,” Kunis said. “It kind of takes the piss out of the property.”\n\n2017\n\nKutcher and Kunis then snagged a $10 million beach house a little ways north in Santa Barbara. The six-bedroom, six-bathroom home spans 3,100 square feet, with an abundance of windows to let in plenty of natural light and white exposed beam ceilings to further accentuate the pad’s open-plan spaciousness. Highlights include an eat-in kitchen with a large center island for entertaining and a living room with a cozy fireplace. A ground-level porch and a second-floor balcony both look out onto the Pacific Ocean. The couple still owns this getaway."
