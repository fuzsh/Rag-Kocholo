        "text": "Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher were together for eight years before splitting in 2011.\n\nThe couple met in 2003 and quickly made headlines as an unexpected pair with their 15-year age gap. They wed in 2005 but later separated after six years of marriage.\n\nTwo years after their divorce was finalized in 2013, Kutcher married former costar Mila Kunis. Moore is currently dating celebrity chef Daniel Humm.\n\nKutcher has remained close with Moore's three daughters — Rumer, Scout and Tallulah, whom she shares with ex-husband Bruce Willis. \"I think you try … but at the same time I am not their father,\" Kutcher recalled of his relationship with Moore and her daughters. \"I was never trying to be their father. I always had respect and honored Bruce [Willis], and I think he's a brilliant human being and a wonderful man. If they don't want an engagement with me, I'm not going to force it upon them. But they all do and it's great.\"\n\nFrom their first meeting to her tell-all memoir, here's a look back at Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher's relationship.\n\nMay 2003: Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher meet\n\nMoore and Kutcher met at a casual dinner with friends and became romantically involved shortly afterward.
