        "text": "Her memorable performance in Ghost made us dream of a perfect relationship, but her private life has been nothing like a movie. Demi Moore has been through many ups and downs and a string of marriages to rediscover herself again. However, the stunning actress has proven her tenacity, emerging from her 6-year-long marriage to Ashton Kutcher stronger than ever.\n\nBright Side loves hearing stories like this, and we’d like to invite you to join us in celebrating this remarkable woman who proved that happiness is not dependent on a man.\n\nDemi’s dating history is littered with celebrities.\n\nWarner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection / East News, ASSOCIATED PRESS/East News\n\nDemi has dated several prominent Hollywood celebrities throughout her life. Among her most famous relationships, we must mention her brief marriage to Freddy Moore, which lasted 5 years, and the intense love story she shared with actor Emilio Estevez.\n\nThe 2 connected immediately after they first met while filming St. Elmo’s Fire. “We were together for 6 months, and then we got engaged, and I moved in with him,” Demi recalled.\n\nDemi called off their engagement in 1986 after discovering Emilio’s infidelity, yet they remained extremely close friends. However, soon after ending her relationship with the actor, she began dating another big star, Bruce Willis, with whom she got married not even 3 months later.\n\nGilbert Flores/Broadimage/EAST NEWS\n\nFor years, Bruce Willis and Demi Moore were a Hollywood power couple, and they had 3 daughters together: Rumer, Scout, and Tallulah. However, their careers kept them apart too frequently to create the marriage they had envisioned, which led to their divorce in 1998.\n\nThe duo remained close friends while continuing to co-parent their kids. As Bruce said, “We have 3 children whom we will continue to raise together, and we’re probably as close now as we ever were. We realize we have a lifelong commitment to our kids. Our friendship continues.”\n\nThere is no animosity between Demi and Bruce, who are, in fact, closer than ever. The 2 parents have always put forth a lot of effort to give their daughters a happy childhood in order to maintain the family’s unity and strength.\n\nThe age gap between Demi and Ashton\n\nface to face/Reporter/ East News\n\nThey were one of the most iconic couples of the early 2000s, not only due to their fame but also because Demi was 40 at the time they met, and Kutcher was only 25. However, when Demi and Ashton ran into each other at a casual dinner in 2003, it was love at first sight.\n\nThe age difference caused quite a stir at the time, but the couple was more in love than ever. The actress had confessed, “We couldn’t feel it. We were totally in sync from our very first conversation.” So 2 years after their first meeting, the couple got married in a huge ceremony that also included Demi’s ex-husband, Bruce Willis.\n\nAshton’s bond with her daughters and the divorce\n\nWhen Ashton first appeared in Demi’s life, her daughters developed a strong attachment to him, and the famous actors worked hard from the start to establish a close bond with the girls. As Demi’s husband, he had an enormous influence on bringing up and guiding them through adolescence.\n\nUnfortunately, the couple struggled to maintain their union, and 6 years after getting married, they parted ways. Demi made the following claims in a statement: “It is with great sadness and a heavy heart that I have ended my 6-year marriage to Ashton.” They completed the divorce settlement 2 years later, in 2013.\n\nEven after splitting from Demi years later, Ashton maintained his connection with her daughters. Indeed, years later, he declared, “I love them, and I’m never going to stop loving them and rooting for them to be successful in whatever they are pursuing.”\n\nA toxic marriage\n\nDennis Van Tine/LFI/EAST NEWS\n\nDespite many infidelity rumors swirling around the time Demi and Ashton divorced, Demi opened up about it only after several years in her book, Inside Out. The actress admits she had “never been so happy” before meeting Ashton, but that things began to fall apart after she miscarried a few months later and had to deal with some addictions in the interim.\n\nThe Ghost star wrote, “It was my fault, I felt for sure [...] I was racked with guilt and convinced what had happened was my doing.”\n\nAFP/EAST NEWS, PictureGroup/Sipa USA/East News\n\nFew things came out of Demi’s marriage, which caused her to lose her self-esteem. Ashton’s extramarital relationships made this worse, and the actress began to settle for circumstances that would keep her husband close. “I put him first. I wanted to show him how great and fun I could be.”\n\nOn the other hand, following their divorce, Ashton married Mila Kunis, with whom he has 2 children. The actor never really responded to Demi’s words, stating once that his only thoughts are for his children and wife.\n\nShe rediscovered herself.\n\nDee Cercone/Everett Collection / East News\n\nEven though her romantic life didn’t turn out the way she had hoped, Demi has put a lot of effort into becoming the person she is today. The actress has overcome many obstacles to learn how to love herself and be in love with someone else. Indeed, Demi’s self-discovery journey has led her to a new, solid relationship with Daniel Humm, who she has been dating since the beginning of the year.\n\nDemi has always gone above and beyond to please the man she was with. “I changed myself to fit what somebody else wanted,” she confessed in an interview.\n\n“I think the thing is if I were to look back, I would say I blinded myself and I lost myself.” She gradually realized that pursuing her passions and focusing on developing a relationship with herself was the most effective way for her to love herself even more.\n\nHave you ever found yourself stuck in a negative relationship? How did you manage to get out of it?"
