(Beveryly Hills, Calif.-AP) September 26, 2005 - Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore are married.

US Weekly and People say on their Web sites the 27-year-old and the 42-year-old tied the knot at a private home Saturday night. It would be Kutcher's first marriage and Moore's third.

According to the magazines, the wedding guests included Moore's ex-husband, Bruce Willis, and their three daughters.

Moore and Kutcher met in 2003.

In September in Harper's Bazaar, Moore described Kutcher as her "soul mate" and said they wanted to expand their family. But she said they had no marriage plans.

Moore has starred in dozens of films including "St. Elmo's Fire," "Ghost" and "G.I. Jane." Kutcher was in the TV series "That '70's Show" and films "Cheaper by the Dozen" and "Guess Who?"
