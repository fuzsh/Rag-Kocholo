Today, Ashton Kutcher is happily married to and shares two kids with Mila Kunis, but in a new interview, the actor recalled the heartbreaks he faced in his previous marriage to Demi Moore.

The No Strings Attached star, 44, married Demi, 60, in 2005—their 16-year age gap drawing skepticism and making headlines all over Hollywood. At the time, the Striptease actor was already mom to three daughters—Rumer, Scout, and Tallulah Willis—from her marriage to fellow actor Bruce Willis.

“I was 26, bearing the responsibility of an 8-year-old, a 10-year-old, and a 12-year-old,” Ashton said in his interview with Esquire. “That’s how some teen parents must experience their 20s.” (Ashton has maintained a close relationship with the three women despite his split from Demi.)

Soon after they began dating, in 2003, Demi got pregnant with a baby girl, who would have been named Chaplin Ray. Ashton recalled wanting a child with the actor so badly and then being crushed when she suffered a miscarriage six months in.

“Losing a kid that you think you’re going to have, and that close to thinking you’re going to have a kid, is really, really painful,” he said. “Everyone deals with that in different ways.”

He and Demi separated in 2011 and finalized their divorce in 2013.

“Nothing makes you feel like a failure like divorce,” Ashton said.

“I love kids,” he told the magazine. “I wouldn’t have gotten married to a woman that had three kids if I didn’t love kids. The idea of having another kid would have been incredible.”

Of losing their baby, he added, “For whatever reason, I had to have that experience.”

Ashton is now dad to daughter Wyatt, 8, and son Dimitri, 6, with That ’70s Show costar and wife Mila, 39. The two married in 2015.
