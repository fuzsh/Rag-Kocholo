Actors Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher were married on Saturday, capping their celebrated two-year-long older woman, younger man relationship, two celebrity magazines reported on Sunday. Representatives for Kutcher, 27, and Moore, 42, could not be immediately reached for comment, but both Us Weekly and People magazine reported on their Web sites that the couple were married in Los Angeles area on Saturday.

Us Weekly, which first reported the wedding, said about 100 of the couple’s friends, including Moore’s second husband Bruce Willis, attended it. Also at the wedding were actress Lucy Liu and Moore’s three daughters from her marriage to Willis.

Moore, who starred in “Ghost,” “G.I. Jane” and “Striptease,” first began dating the younger Kutcher in 2003, just as she was making a highly publicized return to the screen as a high-kicking villain in “Charlie’s Angels: Full Throttle.” Kutcher, whose break came as a star in television’s “That 70s Show,” is co-creator of the MTV reality show “Punk’d.” His films include “Guess Who” in 2005 and “Dude, Where’s My Car?” in 2000. It was the first marriage for Kutcher and third for Moore. She was married from 1980 to 1984 to rock musician Freddie Moore and from 1987 to 2000 to Willis.

People Magazine said Kutcher and Moore met at a dinner in New York City in 2003. After Kutcher began dating Moore, the magazine said he quickly carved out a place in the lives of her three daughters by Willis – Rumer, 17; Scout, 14; and Tallulah, 11 – who came to embrace Kutcher as a third parent, affectionately calling him MOD, short for “My Other Dad.” The relationship between Moore and Kutcher has been seen by some in Hollywood as evidence of a liberating new trend in which older American women are dating younger men, challenging the traditional convention of May-December romances.
