        "text": "In celebration of EVANESCENCE's debut album, \"Fallen\", turning 20 years old, the band's founding guitarist Ben Moody has reimagined songs from the LP and is in the process of uploading the results to his YouTube channel. Check out the first reimagined track, \"Going Under\", below.\n\n\"Fallen\" was recently certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association Of America (RIAA) commemorating sales and streams of ten million units in the United States.\n\nLed by the smash single \"Bring Me To Life\", which also appeared on the soundtrack to the movie \"Daredevil\", \"Fallen\" yielded three more singles with \"Going Under\", \"My Immortal\" and \"Everybody's Fool\". EVANESCENCE also won Grammys in 2004 for \"Best New Artist\" and \"Best Hard Rock Performance\".\n\nAsked in a 2022 interview with Rock Sound if there were any plans for EVANESCENCE to commemorate \"Fallen\"'s 20th anniversary in 2023, singer Amy Lee said: \"I do have an idea. It's gonna take a little bit of work. But I think it probably won't be what everybody expects. I think everybody just is, 'Oh, why don't you do a show that's, like, [playing] the album front to back?' We've been playing so many shows, I would rather do something that, to me… I don't know. I don't wanna give it away, in case it doesn't work out. Maybe I'll do nothing. Expect nothing, and then if I do something, you'll be really, really grateful. [Laughs]\"\n\nAmy also talked about the fact that \"Bring Me To Life\" experienced a resurgence last summer, 19 years after its original release. The song, which initially reached No. 5 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and was EVANESCENCE's first U.K. No. 1 single, reached No. 1 on the U.S. iTunes chart in August 2022.\n\n\"It is satisfying,\" Lee said about the track's renewed popularity. \"And it's cool now, because I remember a lot of the feeling in the beginning. It was so much about, like, 'What's next?' And, 'Are we gonna be able to make it?' And, 'Are we gonna be able to survive?' And, 'Are people gonna listen to our next song?' And, 'What about the next record?' And just getting to the next place always.\n\n\"There is an element to a song like 'Bring Me To Life' that didn't exist before, which is this nostalgia,\" she explained. \"The song has grown live. It's something that we've added to. But part of how it's grown is with its history and with what it means to everybody in the room. It's not something new; it's just something that you already have known for so long that has a place in your heart. It's just able to be more than it would have been then. So I, in a lot of ways, love it more than I did.\"\n\nThe success of \"Fallen\" led to turmoil within the group, as Moody left in late 2003, leaving Lee as the only original member of the band.\n\nIn 2010, Moodygave a lengthy explanation for why he left EVANESCENCE while promoting his soundalike band called WE ARE THE FALLEN with other former EVANESCENCE members (John LeCompt on guitar and Rocky Gray on drums) along with \"American Idol\" powerhouse vocalist Carly Smithson and bassist Marty O'Brien.\n\nLee continued with new members, and EVANESCENCE issued \"The Open Door\" in 2006. While a hit, it did not equal the sales of \"Fallen\". Lee told The Pulse Of Radio at the time that she wasn't concerned about matching the previous album's success. \"I just haven't ever looked at it that way,\" she said. \"'Fallen' is a great record, but I don't think you can try to match the success of another body of work. I think that's only gonna frustrate you. And if, honestly if what you really care about is record sales and money, there's no way you're gonna make a great piece of art, because then you're just gonna get all confused and make something ingenuine.\"\n\nIn February 2022, EVANESCENCE's music video for \"Bring Me To Life\" — which featured guest vocals from Paul McCoy of 12 STONES — surpassed one billion views on YouTube. The Philipp Stölzl-directed clip, which was uploaded to YouTube in December of 2009, was filmed in Romania in January 2003. It features Lee in a night gown and barefoot, in her room, inside a tall building in the city at night. The rest of the band is playing on a higher floor of the building.\n\nIn March 2021, Lee told Alternative Press that EVANESCENCE's original record label Wind Up threatened not to release \"Fallen\" if she and her bandmates didn't add a male voice to lead single \"Bring Me To Life\" to make it more palatable for radio."
