        "text": "It's hard to believe, that in a constantly changing world, one tradition could stand the test of time for almost 82 years. But, that is exactly the case for the Lafayette Civic Cup award, sponsored by The Daily Advertiser since its inception in 1933.\n\nThe award is given each year to one outstanding individual in the city who has made significant contributions to the community. This year, Lafayette businessman Kevin Moody was honored as the 2014 Civic Cup winner.\n\n\"Everyone I asked said, 'He's such a nice guy.' I couldn't find anything bad about him,\" Red Lerille —last year's honoree — joked.\n\nFor many years, the Petroleum Club in Lafayette has hosted a special dinner where family, friends and associates have joined together to pay tribute to the chosen recipient. As is customary, last year's recipient presented the cup.\n\nMoody said he was not only surprised by the award but also very humbled.\n\n\"When they told me, I thought, there has to be someone more deserving than me,\" Moody said, \"but I was very honored, and I appreciate the thought.\"\n\nEach year, recipients are chosen by a committee of past recipients. Members of the community and the public submit letters recommending someone to the nominating committee and the past recipients. It is a low-key affair and members said it is meant to be that way.\n\n\"This is not a political event,\" said Paul Hilliard, a past recipient and Civic Cup committee member. \"We don't want it to be like a campaign. A rotating nominating committee looks at all the recent letters and letters for previous years and tries to select someone who has made a contribution for the better of the community. We try to keep it a surprise to keep people from campaigning for it.\"\n\nMoody, 56, grew up in Crowley and has been a resident of Lafayette for the last 32 years. Since 1986, the father of four has served as president and CEO of the Moody Company, a privately held holding company with interests in newspapers, restaurants, real estate, oil and gas, and private equity investments.\n\nHe is actively involved with The Moody Company Foundation, which was started by the family in the 1990s to support and organize the family's charitable giving.\n\nHe credits his father, B.I. Moody III, with teaching him those values.\n\n\"I learned early on,\" recalled Moody, \"It's about people and service and helping in ways that we can.\"\n\nThe Moody companies support numerous charities and causes in Acadiana including; the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, Lafayette Ballet Theatre, Lafayette Catholic Service Center, Lafayette Community Health Care Clinic, Louisiana Council on Child Abuse, Lourdes Foundation (St. Bernadette's Clinic) Make‐A‐Wish Foundation, Mark Graham Foundation, Miles Perret Cancer Services, National Downs Syndrome Society and the New Life Center, just to name a few.\n\nBut there is one cause that holds a special meaning for the Moody family.\n\n\"The Miles Perret Center is close and dear to our hearts because of our relationship with them and the work they do in the community,\" Moody said. \"Several of us (family members) are cancer survivors, so that one is special.\"\n\nLongtime friend Hank Perret said Moody is always kind and generous and has meant the world to the Miles Perret Center.\n\n\"He is one of the most unselfish people I know,\" Perret said.\n\nAccording to his family, accepting awards and recognition is not something Moody is comfortable with when he gives his time and resources to worthy causes.\n\n\"I knew he would be very honored,\" said Moody's son, Ben Moody. \"But also shocked. That's just how he is.\"\n\nMoody is also a founding member of Moody, Moreno & Rucks, a privately held investment company.\n\nHe currently serves on the board of directors for the Moody Company, Financial Corporation of Louisiana, America's Pizza Company, The Community Foundation of Acadiana, the University of Louisiana at Lafayette Foundation, Our Lady of Lourdes Regional Medical Center and Crossroads Catholic Bookstore.\n\nMoody graduated from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, then University of Southwestern Louisiana, in 1980 with an accounting degree and received his master's in business administration from Vanderbilt University in 1982."
