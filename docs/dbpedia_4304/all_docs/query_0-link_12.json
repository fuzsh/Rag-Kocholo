        "text": "Ben Robert Moody II (born in Little Rock, Arkansas on January 22, 1981) is a former guitarist of the band Evanescence, which he co-founded with Amy Lee in 1994. After leaving Evanescence in 2003, Moody co-wrote the song The End Has Come from The Punisher film's soundtrack and co-wrote for a number of pop artists, including Avril Lavigne, Kelly Clarkson, and Lindsay Lohan. He released a solo album called \"Can't Regret What You Don't Remember\" in 2011.\n\nAs of June 2023 Ben is now divorced.\n\nMusic and business\n\n[edit]\n\n\"It's weird when you open up Billboard because you see your name next to 50 Cent and Madonna. I mean, 50 Cent who I grew up on for the last month.\"\n\n\"I used to do the rap [on Bring Me To Life], but people could not handle my flow.\"\n\n\"We'll just drink and go on.\"\n\nOn dealing with nerves about The Tonight Show with Jay Leno where Evanescence was to perform Bring Me To Life.\n\nPeople\n\n[edit]\n\n\"She's not that attractive. I mean, she was hard to look at at first, but I figured, rough around the edges, but she can sing good.\"\n\nabout Amy Lee.\n\n\"We have faith in the people who support us. If they really like us, they're going to want to be cool enough to buy our music, and realize that if they don't, the record label gets our first-born child.\"\n\nAbout religion and Evanescence being a Christian band\n\n[edit]\n\n\"We're actually high on the Christian charts, and I'm like, 'What the f*** are we even doing there?'\"\n\nAbout Fallen.\n\n\"As far as spiritually - the message we as a band want to convey more than anything is simple - God is Love. He is a just God, but a gracious God. All anyone seems to want to do these days is judge other people for things that they themselves are doing. It's so easy to feel completely and hopelessly alone. I used to visit a church that happened to openly support President Clinton. I remember more than once seeing people on the street in front of the church who were opposed to Clinton's stand on homosexuality. These people had their small children with them holding up signs that said \"God Hates Fags\". The children weren't even old enough to know what homosexuality was, all they knew was that they were supposed to hate them. The thing that bothered me was not their ignorance or their hateful standpoint, but that they called themselves Christians. The world is filled with hateful people who parade the name of Christ like a badge that grants them immunity to destroy anyone who disagrees with them and they are turning more people away from the love of Jesus than any other group of people in the world. The #1 cause of atheism is Christians... We only hope to offset that as much as we can... We hope to express in our music that Christianity is not a rigid list of rules to follow only out of fear of an unseen deity who will strike you down at any given moment if you fail.\"\n\n\"We're musicians who write about things that affect our life. If I was taking the trash out and was suddenly struck with the inspiration to write a song about it, I'd probably do it. Our relationship with Christ is one of the biggest parts of our lives so of course we tend to be heavily lyrically influenced by that. We didn’t just decide to become “Christian musicians”, it just happened that way.\"\n\n\"We’ve had the same dream from the beginning; to write with everything in us and totally do the music we love while at the same time using that as a tool to share with others what Christ has done in our lives.\"\n\nRandom stuff\n\n[edit]\n\n\"I don't even have a jeep, let alone a bomb-proof jeep.\"\n\n\"That's the most rock-and-roll story in the world. No one can top it.\"\n\nOn how he and Amy met in a youth camp.\n\n\"Something tells me a bomb would pretty much take our bus out.\"\n\nWikipedia has an article about:\n\nOfficial site\n\nBen Moody LiveJournal community"
