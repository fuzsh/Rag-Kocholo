        "text": "Evanescence face an uncertain future following the shock walkout of their guitarist.\n\nIt has emerged that founder member Ben Moody walked out of the band’s world tour on October 24 in Berlin. He immediately flew home and did not give a reason for his departure, according to MTV.\n\nFurious singer Amy Lee told Rocksound magazine: “You don’t do that to your band. You wouldn’t do that to your friends or your family. You don’t do that to anyone.”\n\nThe band are ploughing on with their European tour, and are expected to honour their US dates, which begin later this month. Second guitarist John LeCompt is filling in Moody’s parts.\n\nAdvertisement"
