        "text": "You could definitely say that the first place they met was primed for the start of a relationship...but took a bit of time to start. It was at a mutual friend's Engagement Party. The Bride had grown up with Kellyn in church youth group and knew Ben from college, and Ben had played Football with the Groom at CNU. Right from the start, Ben will tell you he was laser focused on this curly-headed bombshell that was sitting in the living room of this party. The only problem was, Ben was ridiculously shy. Good thing for him, Kellyn has met little to no strangers and they struck up a good conversation. But with Ben dragging his feet and Kellyn's busy schedule, they weren't able to reconnect until their friend's wedding. This is where it gets good! June 29, 2013 Kellyn remembers seeing Ben at their friend's wedding and saying, \"I...totally forgot about that guy.\" Ben hadn't forgotten, though...and he had a plan for them to reconnect. At the reception, Ben got together with his buddies (football huddle style, of course) and moved around the seating assignments so that Kellyn would just so happen to be sitting next to him! They had a great time together at the reception, and a couple days later, Ben finally got the nerve to ask Kellyn on a first date and... she said yes!\n\nKellyn and Ben have had a great journey over the past six years! In that time they have taken trips together to Houston, Minnesota, New York, Charlotte, and all around Virginia! They have survived two fire academies (one surviving more than the other), and have also gained two fur babies whom they love very much...their cats, Sirius Black & Toby. They have grown in their faith together and have found a home church that has provided a wonderful foundation in which to start their marriage and grow their connection with God. They are thankful to have a great group of friends and family that have given them genuine support and love throughout their relationship!\n\nKellyn and Ben have a favorite place to spend their Summers (and really any other time during the year), and that place is Kellyn’s Aunt and Uncle’s river house in the Northern Neck! On the morning of July 1, 2018, Ben had woken Kellyn to go see the early morning sunrise. If anyone knows Kellyn, they know that early morning doesn’t really agree with her…especially when she’s on vacation. They made their way across the street and down to the beach to get their normal spot on the sand. Ben had been fully expecting that the beach would be completely deserted this early in the morning, hoping that it would be a moment just between the two of them… Well, that didn’t happen. There was an older gentleman 20 feet down from them that spent every morning fishing in HIS normal spot, and he wasn’t going anywhere. Ben did his best to inconspicuously make eye contact and telepathically transmit the message “Dude, I’m about to propose…GET OUT OF HERE!” The gentleman didn’t get that message. He looked Ben right in the eye, took a big puff from his cigar, and cast his line again. “Ok, plans change…we’re still good” Ben and Kellyn would always take a beach picture together, and so Ben suggested that they take a “picture” in front of the sunrise. Without Kellyn knowing, he had started recording a video to catch the whole proposal! Ben ran back over to Kellyn as if he had to beat the countdown timer, and immediately got on one knee. He was so nervous that he mumbled a series of sounds that somehow resulted in a question of “Kellyn Margaret Fleming, will you marry me?!” And with excitement and emotion in her voice, she said “Yes! Yes, I’ll marry you!”"
