You should be millions of miles away by now It's funny how it hurts me this way It's not the words that you say But that you believe them Fucked up as I ever was Make sure no one sees Me on my knees Clinging to my rage, just because It's easier, to believe in More than These lies and secrets Hopes and regrets It's the way we are No, I want to believe you You'll only leave, too Just the way we are It's just the way we are Getting good at saying goodbye I feel a little less, each time they walk away Don't even stop to wonder why It's not the reason that stays But that it's over Leaving More lies and secrets Hopes and regrets It's just the way we are No, I want to believe you You'll only leave, too Just the way we are It's the the way we are What am I reaching for? You don't love me anymore So just leave me here With our lies and secrets Hopes and regrets It's just the way we are No, I want to believe you You'll only leave, too Just the way we are Yes, I want to believe you I know you'll leave, too Just the way we are It's just the way we are We are\n\nBecome A Better Singer In Only 30 Days, With Easy Video Lessons!"
