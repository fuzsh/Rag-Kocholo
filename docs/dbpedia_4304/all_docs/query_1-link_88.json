        "text": "Home Town Takeover premiered Sunday, May 2nd and, a whopping 6.5 million viewers watched the show, making it the #1 show on all of TV for that time slot! Absolutely unbelievable!\n\nI am so thrilled to have been a part of the show and help these deserving families and business owners in Wetumpka, Alabama.\n\nOn the first episode you got to see the big reveal of the Moody house and The Tapp18 clothing boutique. Let’s take a look at the Moody house!\n\nThe Moody family was the sweetest young couple who have become foster parents. They recently bought this super cute house in the residential side of town.\n\nHere is the Moody home after the show was complete! Isn’t it beautiful?\n\nOn the exterior, Jenny and Dave Mars chose a fresh new coat of beautiful blue/green paint, cedar shutters with shutter dogs, cedar shake on the dormers and new columns on the carport.\n\nThe Mud Room/ Laundry\n\nHere is the “Before” pic of the entry from the carport. She had to step outside her kitchen door and go across this little breezeway to wash clothes. Such a pain!\n\nSo, to fix that issue, the kitchen door got enclosed and a new door was added at both ends of the hallway going into the living room.\n\nAnd here is the final finished product!! This beautiful new entryway is SOOOOOO much better for her needs, putting the laundry room door inside the locked exterior door and much closer to the kids bedroom.\n\nThe view from the living room looking toward the outside door. The area with the beadboard wall used to be the kitchen door. Now it will make the perfect place to hang backpacks and serve as a little mudroom area. (Obviously, these pics were taken while the house was still under construction- they have a door handle now and not just a hole in the door! )\n\nThe Kitchen\n\nOver in the kitchen, this tall bar area blocked her view of the living room. She also had to use the back of the bar for pantry space since the kitchen didn’t have enough space for storage.\n\nHere is the space before:\n\nWith the addition of this little wing wall, Ben and the crew were able to remove that support column and open up this entire area! I love the way the countertop becomes a table top so it’s now an extension of the kitchen. The kids can be close while they cook dinner.\n\nThe kitchen cabinetry got extended all the way down into the previous breakfast nook space. This gives them so much extra pantry space but also tons of horizontal countertop space.\n\nNot to mention these massive wall pantries over by the fridge!\n\nThe cabinets were painted SW Privilege Green with a quartz countertop and brushed gold hardware.\n\nIn case you’re looking for new cabinet hardware, these are not the exact cabinet pulls, but they are very similar in style and color:\n\nAlong the back wall, custom 3″ open shelving was added for storage of extra place settings and pretty knick-knacks.\n\nThis brilliant little space under the window is now the perfect place to keep the kids entertained with little kiddie sized stools. It could also serve as a window seat in the future.\n\nWho doesn’t love cubbies? Perfect place for kids to store their treasures.\n\nThe Living Room\n\nOver in the living room, the brightness got turned up by 1,000 with the removal of the old ceiling tiles, a fresh new coat of paint on the beautiful old paneling and new flooring.\n\nIt has such a relaxed, beachy vibe now, but still warm and inviting.\n\nHere is a look at the living room after the ceiling came out and before the support beam was removed.\n\nThe Boys Room\n\nSince the Moody’s have foster kids coming and going, it was really important to give every child their own private space. Lots of times kids arrive at a foster home with nothing but a trash bag full of their only possessions in the world.\n\nBen built these amazing drawers to fit around the existing kid’s beds so each kiddo can have their own space now. You can see how he designed the drawers around the center legs of the existing metal bed frames.\n\nAnd here they are on the night before filming.\n\nThose bundles on the bed are the quilts that the sweet quilting bee ladies made for the kids all wrapped up and ready to be opened.\n\nCheck out a few more details of this SUPER cute vintage camp-themed kids room.\n\nI absolutely adored working with the design team on this sweet little boys room. It turned out so perfectly!\n\nSo very proud of everyone involved. It turned out beyond better than I could have imagined.\n\nCongrats, Moodys!!! We hope you make many awesome memories in your beautiful home."
