        "text": "Evanescence is an Alternative Rock Band founded in Little Rock, Arkansas, USA in 1998 by singer Amy Lee and guitarist Ben Moody. Lee and Moody met in 1994 at a youth summer camp where Moody heard Amy Lee playing Meat Loaf’s “I’d Do Anything For Love (But I Won’t Do That) on the piano. Their first songs were “Solitude” and “Give Unto Me” written by Amy Lee and “Understanding” and “My Immortal” written by Moody. The songs were edited by both artists and they shared equal credit. Two of Lee and Moody’s songs found playtime on local Arkansas radio stations, which slowly raised local awareness of the group and a growing demand for a show. The band eventually appeared live and became one of the most popular acts in Little Rock. After experimenting with band names, such as Childish Intentions, and Stricken, they decided on Evanescence which means “disappearance” or “fading away.” Amy Lee has stated that she loves the name because “it is mysterious and dark, and places a picture in the listeners’ minds.” Their first full length demo cd, Origin was released in 2000 and remains relatively unknown. The band also released two Extended Plays (Eps). The first was the self titled Evanescence EP which was released in 1998 and about one hundred copies were made. The second, Sound Asleep EP, also known as the Whisper Ep was released in 1999 and was limited to fifty copies. Origin, and the EP’s contain demo versions of some of the songs on their debut album, Fallen. For example the recordings of “My Immortal” found on Fallen can also be found on Origin, minus a handful of additional string accompaniments. Only two thousand, five hundred copies of this record were produced, in response Lee and Moody encouraged fans to download the bands older songs from the internet. In early 2003 the Evanescence line up was completed by Amy Lee and Ben Moody’s friends, John LeCompt, Rocky Gray, and Will Boyd, all of whom worked on Evanescence’s earlier songs. Meanwhile, Evanescence signed on with their first major label, Wind-up Records, and began to work on their next album, Fallen. Nintendo offered the band a chance to perform on the “Nintendo Fusion Tour” and Evanescence accepted the offer and became the headlining band for the 2003 Fusion Tour. Fallen spent forty-three weeks on the Billboard Top 10, was certified 6x Platinum, and has sold more than fourteen million copies worldwide including 6.6 million in the United States. The album was listed for one hundred and four weeks on the Billboard top two hundred and it was one of eight albums in the history of the chart to spend at least a year on the Billboard Top fifty. Bring Me To Life, which features guest vocals from Paul McCoy of 12 Stones, was a global hit for the band and reached number five on the American Billboard Hot one hundred. It also provided Evanescence with their first UK number one listing where it stayed for four weeks from June through July of 2003. The equally popular My Immortal peaked at number seven in the United States and the United Kingdom charts and both songs were featured in the soundtrack for the movie Daredevil. On October 22, 2003, Ben Moody left the band during the European tour of Fallen, reportedly because of creative differences. Moody was replaced by Terry Balsamo of Cold. In 2004, Evanescence’s new lineup released a DVD/CD compilation entitled Anywhere But Home. The DVD includes a concert in Paris, as well as behind the scenes features, including shots of the band backstage, signing autographs, and warming up. The cd contains a previously unreleased song entitled “Missing” which was internationally released as a single and reached number one in Spain. Also on the cd are the live songs “Breath No more” from the Elektra Movie Soundtrack, “Farther Away”, and the band’s cover for Korn’s “Thoughtless.” On July 14, 2006, it was confirmed by a spokesperson for the band’s label that bassist Will Boyd had left the band because he did not wish to go on another tour and wanted to be closer to his family. Amy Lee originally broke the news to the fans in a post on an unofficial Evanescence site, EvBoard.com. On August 102996 it was confirmed that Tim McCord, former Revolution Smile guitarist, would switch instruments and play bass for the band. The band’s latest album, The Open Door, was released in Canada and the United States on October 3, 2006. The album sold four hundred forty-seven thousand copies in the United States in it’s very first week of sales and earned their first number one ranking on the Billboard two hundred album chart, becoming the seven hundredth number one debut in Billboard history. The album progressed slowly for several reasons, including Amy Lee’s desire to maximize the creative process and not rush production, other band members’ side projects, guitarist Terry Balsamo’s stroke, and the controversy surrounding the dismissal of their former manager. Their number one hit from The Open Door Call Me When You’re Sober is based on the fairy tale of Little Red Riding Hood. Amy Lee confirmed that she wrote two songs for the 2005 film version of the Chronicles of Narnia: the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe but it her songs were rejected due to their dark sound. Lee, however said it was “more great stuff for the album.” The Mozart inspired song, Lacrymosa, was one such song that was rejected by Disney.\n\nDiscography (That I Own)\n\nEvanescence 1998 – The first EP produced by Evanescence. The music is pretty good, but of a low quality which has led many who had heard Fallen before listening to this album to the conclusion that this album is fake. It is not a fake and though not of the best quality is still a nice album to have in one’s collection.\n\nSound Asleep 1999 – Also known as the Whisper EP, it was the second EP released by Evanescence. It was released at a show in August of 1999 with the help of BigWig Enterprises and it was released in an unmarked translucent case, though some were signed by Ben Moody and other’s by Amy Lee. This cd is again, very rare since only fifty were made, however some download sites have the full cd for download. The quality of production is far better on this cd than on their first EP.\n\nOrigin 2000 – The first full length demo cd released by Evanescence on the BigWig Enterprises label. It was released in 2000 and sold only to audiences in Little Rock, Arkansas. Only 2500 albums were printed but due to the band’s popularity the number of overpriced and pirated versions of Origin has sky rocketed. Evanescence has been reported to say that they prefer their fans to copy/download the cd at download sites rather than buy it. There are several songs on this album that later appear on Fallen and it’s interesting to note the changes that they made for the Fallen album.\n\nBring Me To Life 2003 – This is of course a single from Fallen. I fell in love with this song when I watched the Daredevil movie and decided that getting my hands on the single was a good idea. Thus I did and I still listen to it, years later!\n\nFallen 2003 – Their first full length album, it was produced on the Wind-up Label. This is their breakthrough album and it’s a wonderful album! The singing of Amy Lee is beautiful, the music is rhythmic and powerful! This is my favorite Evanescence album out of everything that they have produced.\n\nUltra Rare Trax 2003 – A compilation of the rare songs performed by Evanescence, in some cases these are songs that were on the original EP’s. A nice collection of songs!\n\nLe Nouveau Gothique 2004 – This is basically a collection of Evanescence songs including most of the songs from the Fallen album.\n\nAnywhere But Home 2004 – Their concert and dvd album. I truly love this album for the extra song, Missing, at the end of the album. I thought it was worth the money just for that song, but listening to the band performing live was nice too. I would have rather gone to a concert, but then the dvd has footage from their Parisian concert.\n\nThe Open Door 2006 – The latest album by Evanescence. This album has already received great reviews and though I like it, it’s taking a bit longer to grow on me than their Fallen album which I liked immediately."
