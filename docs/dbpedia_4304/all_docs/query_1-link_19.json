        "text": "Making their live debut, the\n\nquintet comprising three ex-\n\nEvanescence members (their\n\nname nodding to guitarist/\n\nsongwriter Ben Moody’s Fallen,\n\nas well as their status) and\n\nAmerican Idol singer Carly\n\nSmithson, belted out 13\n\nnumbers in 55 minutes,\n\ndemonstrating that Amy Lee has\n\ncompetition. All the trademark\n\nchugging guitar riffs, pummeling\n\npercussion and soaring vocals\n\nover piano/keys were present\n\nand correct, along with\n\nSmithson’s gothic allure, and\n\nWATF showcased their new set\n\nwith the likes of the thunderous\n\nWithout You and first single,\n\nBury Me Alive. Cello-effect\n\nkeyboards built the gothic\n\nsymphonic tone of I Am Only\n\nOne, and Madonna’s Like A\n\nPrayer got a similar makeover.\n\nIron Maiden’s Flight Of Icarus\n\nwas faithfully rendered, before\n\nthe Valkyrie splendor of Through\n\nHell and the closing punch of\n\nalbum title track Tear The World\n\nDown."
