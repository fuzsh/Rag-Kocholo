        "text": "A pic of Bn from the good days when he was a member of Evanescence!\n\nName - Ben Moody\n\nDate of birth - January 2nd, 1980\n\nFamily - Mother (Mellisa) Father (Ben) two sisters (Brooke and Summer) and one Brother (Dan)\n\nAll us Evanescence fans owe Ben moody a lot. He found Amy lee and the rest of the band. in the sep issue of revolver ben says, \"From 14, I've been putting 101 percent into this band, I've done nothing but eat, sleep, and breathe it. I destroyed my credit building a makeshift studio for demos. I sold my car to pay for gear. I've lived in a truck outside my friend's house for months. And I guess I expect that kind of dedication from everybody. But I've come to learn I can't really expect people to live up to my work ethic because my work ethic is unhealthy.\"\n\nThank you Ben!!!\n\nBen is now working with Avril Lavigne (another great artist) on her forth coming album so looking foward to that!\n\nBen and Amy were so close he took her to the prom. there was a rumour that Ben and Amy were once engaged but nothing official has been said about it..\n\nQuotes:"
