        "text": "Fifteen (15) years ago this week, the Evanescence album The Open Door was released on September 25th, 2006. The second studio album of the post-grunge, post-alternative rock band received generally positive reviews. The Open Door brings us to our review today of the music primarily performed by Amy Lee, Terry Balsamo, John LeCompt, Will Boyd and Rocky Gray.\n\nSweet Sacrifice opens The Open Door as the third single released in support of the album. Some have found the lyrics to the gothic sound of Sweet Sacrifice to include a metaphor to former Evanescence guitarist Ben Moody. Singer Amy Lee‘s lyrical reference to another can certainly be received this way.\n\nCall Me When You’re Sober speaks to Amy Lee‘s relationship with her former boyfriend, Seether lead singer Shaun Morgan. The song’s lyrics are direct in stating where things went awry with the relationship along with way Morgan would need to change to get back to a better place. The song also was the first single released in support of The Open Door.\n\nWeight of the World is a heavy song both lyrically and musically. The song feels to me like an ode to a relationship between Evanescence front woman Amy Lee and fans of the band. I feel a request to connect from fans and a hard time with the responsibility of defining that connection from Lee.\n\nLithium takes into an account the following quote attributed to Amy Lee. Lithium “is about losing the comfort of sorrow.” The rest of the thought is that the mood stabilizer removes feelings of sorrow that the singer had yet was not ready to let go. The lyrics deal with wishing to feel better while not having felt everything in response to what created the feelings in the first place.\n\nCloud Nine returns, or perhaps continues, with the feelings Lee had in separating from Seether singer Shaun Morgan. The pain of dreamed aspirations that fall through are real, or so it seems for Amy Lee and Shaun Morgan.\n\nSnow White Queen responds to legitimate fear prompted by stalker(s) that Amy Lee endured as a response to unhealthy impulse controls among fans coupled with the limelight of fronting Evanescence. The musicality of this song in mirroring the feelings associated with experiencing a stalker, especially at the opening, are striking.\n\nLacrymosa is the song title that, as a word, means “related to sadness,” at least per our friends at Songfacts. The song, musically inspired by Mozart, lyrically returns to the breakup with Shaun Morgan that we’ve seen referenced through much of The Open Door. The central message for The Open Door certainly feels like an invitation for both Amy Lee and Morgan to walk through the new open door spurred on by the closing of the metaphorical door of their former relationship.\n\nLike You takes on perhaps the hardest message underpinning the full album of The Open Door. The song lyrically addresses the death of Amy Lee‘s sister when both were young kids, along with feelings expressed in the lyrics of that love, coupled with more contemporary experiences, of Lee wishing to be like her sister. This reference to wishing for death should be taken seriously. If you personally are struggling with such wishes, know that there is help at 1-800-273-TALK, or 1-800-273-8255. That telephone number is for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.\n\nLose Control lyrically addresses a longing for what feels like safety and innocence that Evanescence singer Amy Lee finds hard to reconcile as an adult. The song sings of losing control, which I am take to mean wishing to sacrifice a sense of responsibility for the innocence once felt at perhaps a younger, safer time in life.\n\nThe Only One speaks to people, perhaps specifically younger people, that are aiming to find a sense of belonging. In seeking a leader, whether the aim was to speak politically or interpersonally really gets to the underlying point of a belonging that all people seek. It feels like the song speaks generally from a political perspective, though I can see a construct where the lyrics speak more to connecting and belonging from a more personal place than in politics.\n\nYour Star thematically feels like a possible return to the song Weight of the World. While speaking in the lyrics of not seeing your star coupled with feeling alone, could Lee be speaking of the star her fans want to see in her? Is this a specific reference to the ended relationship and love not experienced with Shaun Morgan through multiple songs on The Open Door? Are we returning to the lost star that Lee longs for in missing her deceased sister, as discussed in Like You? The lyrics work for all these possibilities, in my view. The piano heavy introduction coupled with Lee‘s vocals throughout are appreciated.\n\nAll That I’m Living For reflects Amy Lee‘s sense that found meaning can be found in engaging with the activities of the band Evanescence. In perhaps a profound recognition, the song All That I’m Loving For allows us to join the band in an understanding that there is meaning and satisfaction in the needs of life to be found in vocation while continuing to seek the needs of love and place one seeks in other facets of life. This song perhaps is the most straightforward offering of the base sound that Evanescence meant to offer as a band on this album.\n\nGood Enough, the final song released as a single in support of The Open Door, also concludes the 13-song set of songs offered with the full release of The Open Door. The song purportedly previews what would come next for Lee on a personal level. Good Enough musically offers a ballad while lyrically asking if Lee is good enough for the love she feels she found with Josh Hartzler. While fearing that something would go wrong, Hartzler and Lee would later get married, suggesting that things were on the upswing that this album wanted yet largely was concerned would be beyond reach.\n\nMatt – Wednesday, September 22, 2021"
