Moscow is the capital of Russia. Moscow’s wealth, power, and size will continue to be a vital center for Russia and an important city globally.

Moscow is Russia’s political, economic, cultural, and scientific hub. Moscow is one of the largest global city economies, home to many of Russia’s largest companies and the Russian headquarters of many multinational companies.

Moscow also has one of the world’s largest urban economies, is ranked as an alpha global city, and is one of the fastest-growing tourist destinations in the world.

Where is Moscow?

Moscow is located in the western part of Russia, roughly 1,300 kilometers (808 miles) east of the Eastern edge of Europe, and about 640 kilometers (397 miles) southeast of Saint Petersburg, Russia’s second-largest city. It is situated on the Moskva River.

Geographically, Moscow is in the Central Federal District of Russia and is surrounded by the Moscow Oblast, a region of Russia, although it is administratively separate.

Moscow’s position in western Russia places it in the East European Plain, Europe’s most prominent mountain-less landform. The city’s latitude is similar to that of cities such as Glasgow, Scotland, and southern parts of Alaska.

History of Moscow

Moscow was founded in the 12th Century by Yuri Dolgorukiy, a prince of the Rurik Dynasty. Over the following centuries, it gradually grew in size and importance, mainly due to its advantageous location at the crossroads of several important trade routes.

In 1237-1238, the Mongols, under the leadership of Batu Khan, invaded Rus’ (the medieval state inhabited by the East Slavs), and Moscow was burnt to the ground. However, it quickly recovered and began thriving under the Mongol yoke.

In 1380, Dmitry Donskoy, Prince of Moscow, led a united Russian army to a significant victory against the Mongols in the Battle of Kulikovo. While Mongol domination did not end immediately, it was a turning point, signaling the beginning of the Mongol Yoke’s end.

Under Ivan III (1462-1505), the Duchy of Moscow became the center of a unified Russian state, laying the foundation for the Tsardom of Russia. Ivan III also undertook many construction projects in Moscow, including expanding the Kremlin.

During the early Tsarist period, Moscow continued to grow as Russia’s cultural and spiritual center. The city experienced significant turmoil during the Time of Troubles in the late 16th and early 17th centuries – a period of civil war, foreign invasion, and famine. However, the Romanov dynasty, which took power in 1613, brought stability.

Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, Moscow developed rapidly. The city expanded beyond its original fortifications, and its population grew. Notable events during this period include Napoleon’s invasion in 1812, where much of Moscow was burnt after the French retreat.

In the wake of the Russian Revolution in 1917, Moscow became the capital of the newly established Soviet Union. Lenin believed that Moscow’s central location made it a better capital than Saint Petersburg, which was considered vulnerable to foreign attack due to its proximity to the western border.

Moscow underwent a massive transformation under Soviet rule, characterized by industrialization and the construction of housing, infrastructure, and public facilities. The city’s architectural landscape was shaped with buildings designed in the exquisite Stalinist style, such as the Seven Sisters, a group of skyscrapers scattered throughout the city.

Despite severe losses in World War II, the city’s population exploded during this period. Post-war, Moscow became the center of the Cold War, and its growth continued with the development of the city’s transport network, including one of the world’s busiest metro systems.

Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Moscow has undergone significant changes. It has seen a major influx of foreign investment and has experienced a boom in real estate development. The city has embraced capitalism, with numerous businesses, shops, and services springing up, starkly contrasting the Soviet era.

Many historical and cultural sites neglected during the Soviet period have been restored, and Moscow has increasingly become a destination for global tourism. The city’s rich history and rapid modernization coexist with Soviet-era buildings alongside modern skyscrapers.
