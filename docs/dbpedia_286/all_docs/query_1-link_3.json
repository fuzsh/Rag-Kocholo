A number of convenient cues are available to define latitude on the basis of geomagnetic and celestial information, but very few are useful to defining longitude. To investigate the effects of displacements across longitudes on orientation, we recorded orientation of adult and juvenile migratory white-crowned sparrows, Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii, after passive longitudinal displacements, by ship, of 266-2862 km across high-arctic North America. After eastward displacement to the magnetic North Pole and then across the 0 degrees declination line, adults and juveniles abruptly shifted their orientation from the migratory direction to a direction that would lead back to the breeding area or to the normal migratory route, suggesting that the birds began compensating for the displacement by using geomagnetic cues alone or together with solar cues. In contrast to predictions by a simple genetic migration program, our experiments suggest that both adults and juveniles possess a navigation system based on a combination of celestial and geomagnetic information, possibly declination, to correct for eastward longitudinal displacements.\n\nLongitude through time\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTorsvik, T.

If the LIP was formed at the margin of the Africa or Pacific LLSVPs and they have remained the same throughout Earth's history there are six possible marginal sites on the CMB from which to choose, but three sites that do not position the long- lived subduction margin of Gondwana (e.g. South America, East Antarctica and East Australia) above regions of high seismic velocity (the subduction graveyards) can be eliminated. If, as recently postulated, there have only been one LLSVP (or upwelling zone) in Pre-Pangean time (Pacific LLSVP) that reduces longitude choices to two possible marginal sites on the CMB.\n\nA computer program for converting rectangular coordinates to latitude-longitude coordinates\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nRutledge, A.T.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nA computer program was developed for converting the coordinates of any rectangular grid on a map to coordinates on a grid that is parallel to lines of equal latitude and longitude. Using this program in conjunction with groundwater flow models, the user can extract data and results from models with varying grid orientations and place these data into grid structure that is oriented parallel to lines of equal latitude and longitude. All cells in the rectangular grid must have equal dimensions, and all cells in the latitude-longitude grid measure one minute by one minute. This program is applicable if the map used shows lines of equal latitude as arcs and lines of equal longitude as straight lines and assumes that the Earth 's surface can be approximated as a sphere. The program user enters the row number , column number, and latitude and longitude of the midpoint of the cell for three test cells on the rectangular grid. The latitude and longitude of boundaries of the rectangular grid also are entered. By solving sets of simultaneous linear equations, the program calculates coefficients that are used for making the conversion. As an option in the program, the user may build a groundwater model file based on a grid that is parallel to lines of equal latitude and longitude. The program reads a data file based on the rectangular coordinates and automatically forms the new data file.

Locations on Earth are measured in degrees east or west from this position. The prime meridian was defined by international agreement in 1884 as the position of the large \"transit circle,\" a telescope in the Observatory's Meridian Building. The transit circle was built by Sir George Biddell Airy, the 7th Astronomer Royal, in 1850. (While visual observations with transits were the basis of navigation until the space age, it is interesting to note that the current definition of the prime meridian is in reference to orbiting satellites and Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) measurements of distant radio sources such as quasars. This \"International Reference Meridian\" is now about 100 meters east of the Airy Transit at Greenwich.) For Mars, the prime meridian was first defined by the German astronomers W. Beer and J. H. MÃ¤dler in 1830-32. They used a small circular feature, which they designated \"a,\" as a reference point to determine the rotation period of the planet. The Italian astronomer G. V. Schiaparelli, in his 1877 map of Mars, used this feature as the zero point of longitude. It was subsequently named Sinus Meridiani (\"Middle Bay\") by Camille Flammarion. When Mariner 9 mapped the planet at about 1 kilometer (0.62 mile) resolution in 1972, an extensive \"control net\" of locations was computed by Merton Davies of the RAND Corporation. Davies designated a 0.5-kilometer-wide crater (0.3 miles wide), subsequently named \"Airy-0\" (within the large crater Airy in Sinus Meridiani) as the longitude zero point. (Airy, of course, was named to commemorate the builder of the Greenwich transit.) This crater was imaged once by Mariner 9 (the 3rd picture taken on its 533rd orbit, 533B03) and once by the Viking 1 orbiter in 1978 (the 46th image on that spacecraft's 746th orbit, 746A46), and these two images were the basis of the martian\n\nA test of the influence of continental axes of orientation on patterns of human gene flow\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRamachandran, Sohini; Rosenberg, Noah A.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe geographic distribution of genetic variation reflects trends in past population migrations, and can be used to make inferences about these migrations. It has been proposed that the east-west orientation of the Eurasian landmass facilitated the rapid spread of ancient technological innovations across Eurasia, while the north-south orientation of the Americas led to a slower diffusion of technology there. If the diffusion of technology was accompanied by gene flow, then this hypothesis predicts that genetic differentiation in the Americas along lines of longitude will be greater than that in Eurasia along lines of latitude. We use 678 microsatellite loci from 68 indigenous populations in Eurasia and the Americas to investigate the spatial axes that underlie population-genetic variation. We find that genetic differentiation increases more rapidly along lines of longitude in the Americas than along lines of latitude in Eurasia. Distance along lines of latitude explains a sizeable portion of genetic distance in Eurasia, whereas distance along lines of longitude does not explain a large proportion of Eurasian genetic variation. Genetic differentiation in the Americas occurs along both latitudinal and longitudinal axes and has a greater magnitude than corresponding differentiation in Eurasia, even when adjusting for the lower level of genetic variation in the American populations. These results support the view that continental orientation has influenced migration patterns and has played an important role in determining both the structure of human genetic variation and the distribution and spread of cultural traits.

E.\n\n2005-12-01\n\nI present a brief history of the ``Lunar Distance\" technique for determining Longitude at sea, as developed by Astronomer Royal Neville Maskelyne (1732-1811) and others. I illustrate this history using images and results from a recent (2001) BBC History project to re-enact part of Captain James Cook's first voyage, from near-shipwreck on the east coast Australia, back to the relative safety of Batavia (modern-day Djakarta). I demonstrate the practical use of Lunars to determine longitude at sea, illustrated through comparison to GPS coordinates obtained along the voyage. During windows of lunar visibility, using new tables drawn up at HMNAO, we were able to match or exceed Maskelyne's stated accuracy of 30 nautical miles (0.5 degrees). Close to New Moon, dependent on our own skills of dead-reckoning, we prove far less able navigators than Cook and his cohort! I acknowledge the enormous assistance of Catherine Hohenkerk of the HMNAO, Tanya Batchelor of the BBC, George Huxtable, John Jeffrey, and John Selwyn-Gilbert in researching this subject. I gratefully acknowledge funding from the BBC, and HM Bark Endeavour Foundation for the use of their glorious ship, the Endeavour.\n\nInvestigating Systematic Errors of the Interstellar Flow Longitude Derived from the Pickup Ion Cutoff\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTaut, A.; Berger, L.; Drews, C.; Bower, J.; Keilbach, D.; Lee, M. A.; Moebius, E.; Wimmer-Schweingruber, R. F.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nComplementary to the direct neutral particle measurements performed by e.g. IBEX, the measurement of PickUp Ions (PUIs) constitutes a diagnostic tool to investigate the local interstellar medium. PUIs are former neutral particles that have been ionized in the inner heliosphere. Subsequently, they are picked up by the solar wind and its frozen-in magnetic field. Due to this process, a characteristic Velocity Distribution Function (VDF) with a sharp cutoff evolves, which carries information about the PUI's injection speed and thus the former neutral particle velocity. The symmetry of the injection speed about the interstellar flow vector is used to derive the interstellar flow longitude from PUI measurements. Using He PUI data obtained by the PLASTIC sensor on STEREO A, we investigate how this concept may be affected by systematic errors. The PUI VDF strongly depends on the orientation of the local interplanetary magnetic field. Recently injected PUIs with speeds just below the cutoff speed typically form a highly anisotropic torus distribution in velocity space, which leads to a longitudinal transport for certain magnetic field orientation. Therefore, we investigate how the selection of magnetic field configurations in the data affects the result for the interstellar flow longitude that we derive from the PUI cutoff. Indeed, we find that the results follow a systematic trend with the filtered magnetic field angles that can lead to a shift of the result up to 5Â°. In turn, this means that every value for the interstellar flow longitude derived from the PUI cutoff is affected by a systematic error depending on the utilized magnetic field orientations. Here, we present our observations, discuss possible reasons for the systematic trend we discovered, and indicate selections that may minimize the systematic errors.\n\nThe South ``West'' Pacific Convergence Zone: Large-scale feedback on atmospheric subsidence to the east\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWidlansky, M. J.; Webster, P. J.; Hoyos, C.\n\n2010-12-01\n\nThree semi-permanent convective cloud bands exist in the Southern Hemisphere extending southeastward from the equator, through the tropics, and into the subtropics. The most prominent of these features occurs in the South Pacific during summer and is referred to as the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ). Similar cloud bands, with less intensity, exist in the South Indian and Atlantic basins. To the east of each convective zone is a large-scale region of atmospheric subsidence. We attempt to explain the physical mechanisms that promote the diagonal orientation of the SPCZ and also teleconnections that may exist with stratocumulus cloud cover in the southeastern Pacific. It is argued that slowly varying sea surface temperature patterns produce upper tropospheric wind fields that vary substantially in longitude (âU/âx). Regions where 200 hPa zonal winds decrease with longitude (i.e., negative zonal stretching deformation, or âU/âx<0) reduce the group speed of the eastward propagating synoptic (3-6 day period) Rossby waves and locally increase the wave energy density. Such a region of wave accumulation occurs in the vicinity of the SPCZ (see Figure), thus providing a hypothesis for the diagonal orientation and a physical basis for earlier observations that the zone traps eastward propagating synoptic disturbances. Controlled numerical experiments and composites of observed life cycles of synoptic waves confirm that disturbances slow in the SPCZ. From the hypothesis comes a more general theory accounting for the SPCZâs spatial orientation and the lack of disturbances to the east.

Several authors study one or more of these regions using TEC data derived from GNSS observations to describe variations in TEC. They reported a pronounced longitudinal variation respect to zero magnetic declination. One of the important factors that cause the longitude difference at mid-latitude is a combined effect of the longitude variations of magnetic declination and the variations of the zonal thermospheric winds with local time. We propose to study this effect using Global Ionospheric Maps (GIMs) and the respective TEC values generated from the International Reference Ionospheric (IRI) model, during a solar cycle, applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Our works is focused over different local times and regions at mid-latitude. PCA involves a mathematical procedure that transforms a number of correlated variables into a number of uncorrelated variables using the data itself. The spatial structure of the ionosphere variability and its temporal evolution, together are called modes, and there are ordered according to their percentage of the variability of data from highest to lowest. In this analysis the first mode has more than the 90 % of the variability, representing the nominal behavior of the ionosphere, and the second and third modes are the more important for our analysis, because they show the strong longitudinal variation in the different regions using either GIMs or the IRI model.\n\nMotivational Orientations and Second Learner Variables of East Asian Language Learners in the United States.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nYang, Jean Sook Ryu\n\n2003-01-01\n\nCollege Students enrolled in East Asian language classes were surveyed about their language learning motivational orientations (MOs).

A.; Wimmer-Schweingruber, R. F.\n\n2018-03-01\n\n, the derived uncertainties are considerably larger. Furthermore, an unexpected systematic trend of the resulting interstellar flow longitude with the selection of interplanetary magnetic field orientation is uncovered.\n\nDevelopment of Integrated Magnetic and Kinetic Control-oriented Transport Model for q-profile Response Prediction in EAST Discharges\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, Hexiang; Schuster, Eugenio; Rafiq, Tariq; Kritz, Arnold; Ding, Siye\n\n2016-10-01\n\nExtensive research has been conducted to find high-performance operating scenarios characterized by high fusion gain, good confinement, plasma stability and possible steady-state operation. A key plasma property that is related to both the stability and performance of these advanced plasma scenarios is the safety factor profile. A key component of the EAST research program is the exploration of non-inductively driven steady-state plasmas with the recently upgraded heating and current drive capabilities that include lower hybrid current drive and neutral beam injection. Anticipating the need for tight regulation of the safety factor profile in these plasma scenarios, a first-principles-driven (FPD)control-oriented model is proposed to describe the safety factor profile evolution in EAST in response to the different actuators. The TRANSP simulation code is employed to tailor the FPD model to the EAST tokamak geometry and to convert it into a form suitable for control design. The FPD control-oriented model's prediction capabilities are demonstrated by comparing predictions with experimental data from EAST.

A simple model of the daytime F2-layer is adopted and the effects at midlatitudes (25-65 deg geographic) of three processes that accompany geomagnetic storms: (1) thermospheric changes due to auroral heating; (2) equatorward winds that tend to cancel the quiet-day poleward winds; and (3) the penetration of magnetospheric electric fields are studied. At +/- 65 deg, the effects of heating and electric fields are strongest in the longitudes toward which the geomagnetic dipole is tilted, i.e., the North American and the South Indian Ocean sectors. Because of the proximity of the geomagnetic equator to the East Asian and South American sectors, the reverse is true at +/- 25 deg.\n\n\"Michael Jackson World Tour:\" Maps and Globes--Latitude and Longitude.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBenscoter, Gloria Dee\n\n1988-01-01\n\nPresents a mapping activity which helps students understand the purpose of latitude and longitude lines.

(LS)\n\nOrientation of Christian Churches\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMcCluskey, Stephen C.\n\nThe orientation of Christian churches reflects the historically documented concepts that one should turn eastward to pray and the architectural and liturgical principle that temples and churches should be constructed facing east (often specified as equinoctial east). Since many churches do not face equinoctial east, various attempts have been made to explain this deviation. Among them are the idea that those churches were incorrectly built or that they were oriented toward sunrise on the date their foundation was laid or on the feast or the saint to whom the church was dedicated.\n\nInterannual SST Variability in the Japan/East Sea and Relationship with Environmental Variables\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2006-01-01\n\nSoya Strait (SS), and Tartar Strait (TTS).

A.; Phillipson, Graeme P.; Glennerster, Andrew\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe literature on vertical disparity is complicated by the fact that several different definitions of the term âvertical disparityâ are in common use, often without a clear statement about which is intended or a widespread appreciation of the properties of the different definitions. Here, we examine two definitions of retinal vertical disparity: elevation-latitude and elevation-longitude disparity. Near the fixation point, these definitions become equivalent, but in general, they have quite different dependences on object distance and binocular eye posture, which have not previously been spelt out. We present analytical approximations for each type of vertical disparity, valid for more general conditions than previous derivations in the literature: we do not restrict ourselves to objects near the fixation point or near the plane of regard, and we allow for non-zero torsion, cyclovergence and vertical misalignments of the eyes. We use these expressions to derive estimates of the latitude and longitude vertical disparity expected at each point in the visual field, averaged over all natural viewing. Finally, we present analytical expressions showing how binocular eye position â gaze direction, convergence, torsion, cyclovergence, and vertical misalignment â can be derived from the vertical disparity field and its derivatives at the fovea.

The value of oral health related quality of life (OHRQoL) measures to predict utilisation of dental services is unknown. This study aims to explore the association between OHRQoL and problem-oriented dental attendance among adults. We analysed cross-sectional data for 705 adults, aged 16Â years and above, living in three boroughs of Inner South East London. Data were collected during structured interviews at home. The short form of the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) was used to assess the frequency of oral impacts on daily life in the last year. Problem-oriented attendance was defined based on time elapsed since last visit (last 6Â months) and reason for that visit (trouble with teeth). The association between OHIP-14 (total and domain) scores and problem-oriented attendance was tested in logistic regression models adjusting for participants' sociodemographic characteristics. Problem-oriented attenders had a higher OHIP-14 total score than regular attenders (6.73 and 3.73, respectively). In regression models, there was a positive association between OHIP-14 total score and problem-oriented attendance. The odds of visiting the dentist for trouble with teeth were 1.07 greater (95% Confidence Interval: 1.04-1.10) per unit increase in the OHIP-14 total score, after adjustment for participants' sociodemographic characteristics. In subsequent analysis by OHIP-14 domains, greater scores in all domains but handicap were significantly associated with problem-oriented attendance. This study shows that oral impacts on quality of life are associated with recent problem-oriented dental attendance among London adults. Six of the seven domains in the OHIP-14 questionnaire were also associated with dental visits for trouble with teeth.\n\nPerformance of MIDAS Over East African Longitude Sector: Case Study During 4-14 March 2012 Quiet to Disturbed Geomagnetic Conditions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGiday, Nigussie M.; Katamzi-Joseph, Zama T.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThis study investigates the performance of a tomographic algorithm, Multi-Instrument and Data Analysis System (MIDAS), during an extended period of 4-14 March 2012, containing moderate and strong geomagnetic storms conditions, over an understudied and data scarce Eastern African longitude sector. Nonetheless, a relatively better distribution of Global Navigation Satellite Systems stations exists along a narrow longitude sector between 30Â°E and 44Â°E and latitude range of 30Â°S and 36Â°N that spans the equatorial, middle-, and low-latitude ionosphere. Then results are compared with independent global models such as International Reference Ionosphere 2012 (IRI-2012) and global ionosphere map (GIM). MIDAS performance was better than that of the IRI-2012 and GIM models in terms of capturing the diurnal trends as well as the short temporal total electron content (TEC) structures, with least root-mean-square errors (RMSEs). Overall, MIDAS results showed better agreement with the observation vertical TEC (VTEC) with computed maximum correlation coefficient (r) of 0.99 and minimum root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 2.91 TEC unit (1 TECU = 1,016 el m-2 over all the test stations and the validation days. Conversely, for the IRI-2012 and GIM TEC estimates, the corresponding maximum computed r values were 0.93 and 0.99, respectively, while the minimum RMSEs were 13.03 TECU and 6.52 TECU, respectively, for all the test stations and the validation days.\n\nEvidence of Jovian active longitude: 3. Observational constraints\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGalopeau, P. H. M.; Boudjada, M. Y.\n\n2010-12-01\n\nThe occurrence probability of the Io-controlled Jovian decameter radio emissions depends on the central meridian longitude and the orbital phase of the satellite Io. Investigations by Galopeau et al. (2004, 2007) have shown that some specific Jovian \"active\" longitudes favor the radiation. The authors proposed a model which involves the cyclotron maser instability (CMI) as the mechanism at the origin of the Jovian radio emissions produced near the local gyrofrequency, along an active magnetic field line carried away by Io through its revolution around Jupiter. Those studies brought out the existence of an active longitude anchored in Jupiter's magnetic field and directly related to the efficiency of the CMI. In the present analysis, we model the four occurrence regions associated to Io-controlled sources. This approach is in a reverse way of the parametric method developed by Galopeau et al. (2007). The properties of the propagation and polarization of the radio wave, derived from the CMI, are the key ingredients for the study of the beaming cone. It is shown that the lead angle of the active magnetic field line relative to Io has a significant effect on both the selection of the propagation conditions and the limit between the right- and left-hand polarization states. The modeled and observed occurrence regions are found to be similar for a lead angle of about 20Â°. However, it seems that the behaviors of the southern and northern sources are not alike despite a common generation mechanism.\n\nIsostatic gravity map of Yukon Flats, east-central Alaska\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nMorin, Robert L.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nThe gravity data used to make this map were collected between 1959 and 1984. The data were collected by automobile, aircraft, and watercraft. Most of the data were collected as part of a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) regional gravity data collection project. Some of the data were collected as part of other USGS local projects. One data set was collected by the NGS (National Geodetic Survey). This map ranges from 65Â° to 68Â° N latitude and 141Â° to 152Â° W longitude. The names of the 12 1:250,000-scale U.S. Geological Survey quadrangle maps that make up this map are labeled on the map.

For this study an extensive database on â450 solar proton events have been constructed using various available sources and solar cosmic ray measurements, which included the data about the time of the event, fluences of protons of various energies in it and the coordinates of its source on the Sun. The analysis has shown the significant inhomogeneity of the distribution. In particular a region of âpassive longitudesâ has been discovered, extensive over the longitude (from â90-100Â° to 170Â°) and the life time (the whole period of observations). From the 60 most powerful proton events during the 19-24 solar cycles not more than 1 event was originated from the interval of 100-170Â° Carrington longitude, from another 80 âmediumâ events only 10 were injected from this interval. The summarized proton fluence of the events, which sources belong to the interval of 90-170Â° amounts only to 5%, and if not take into account the single âanomalousâ powerful event - to just only 1.2% from the total fluence for all the considered events. The existence of the extensive and stable interval of âpassiveâ Carrington longitudes is the remarkable phenomenon in solar physics.

The East African Rift is a world-famous example of such rifting. It is characterized by 1) topographic deep valleys in the rift zone, 2) sheer escarpments along the faulted walls of the rift zone, 3) a chain of lakes within the rift, most of the lakes highly saline due to evaporation in the hot temperatures characteristic of climates near the equator, 4) voluminous amounts of volcanic rocks that have flowed from faults along the sides of the rift, and 5) volcanic cones where magma flow was most intense. This example in Kenya displays most of these features near Lake Begoria. The image was acquired December 18, 2002, covers an area of 40.5 x 32 km, and is located at 0.1 degrees north latitude, 36.1 degrees east longitude.

The data were taken in May and June, 2014, with the 4.2-m Isaac Newton Telescope at Roque de Los Muchachos Observatory in the Canary Islands, using the ACAM (auxiliary-port camera) in spectrometer mode, and using two solar analog stars. The new spectra clearly show absorption bands of solid CH4 at 620, 728, and 850-910 nm, which were known from earlier work. The 620-nm CH4 band is intrinsically very weak, and its appearance indicates a long optical pathlength through the ice. This is especially true if it arises from CH4 dissolved in N2 ice. Earlier work (Owen et al. Science 261, 745, 1993) on the near-infrared spectrum of Pluto (1-2.5 Âµm) has shown that the CH4 bands are shifted to shorter wavelengths because the CH4 occurs as a solute in beta-phase crystalline N2. The optical pathlength through the N2 crystals must be on the order of several cm to produce the N2 band observed at 2.15 Âµm. The new spectra exhibit a pronounced red slope across the entire wavelength range; the slope is variable with longitude, and differs in a small but significant way from that measured at comparable longitudes by Grundy & Fink (Icarus 124, 329, 1996) in their 15-year study of Plutoâs spectrum (500-1000 nm). The new spectra will provide an independent means for calibrating the color filter bands on the Multispectral Visible Imaging Camera (MVIC) (Reuter et al. Space Sci. Rev. 140, 129, 2008) on the New Horizons spacecraft, which will encounter the Pluto-Charon system in mid-2015.

It is presumed that the non-ice component is the source of the yellow-red coloration of Pluto, which is known to be variable across the surface.\n\nSpectroscopy of Pluto, 380-930 Nm at Six Longitudes\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCruikshank, D.

The phylogeography, population genetic structure and historical demography of this species in the East Asia were examined by using partial sequences of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and 16S rRNA in mitochondrial DNA. Ten populations that included 239 individuals were collected from Taiwan (Shihmen Reservoir, SMR, Mingte Reservoir, MTR and Chengching Lake Reservoir, CLR), mainland China (Taihu Lake, TLC, Min River, MRC, Jiulong River, JRC and Shenzhen Reservoir, SRC), Japan (Biwa Lake, BLJ and Kasumigaura Lake, KLJ) and Korea (Han River, HRK). The nucleotide diversity (Ï) of all individuals was 0.01134, with values ranging from 0.0089 (BLJ, Japan) to 0.01425 (MTR, Taiwan). A total of 83 haplotypes were obtained, and the haplotypes were divided into 2 main lineages: lineage A included the specimens from BLJ, KLJ, CLR, MTR, TLC, MRC and JRC, and lineage B comprised the ones from HRK, SRC, SMR, MTR, TLC, MRC and JRC. Lineage A could be further divided two sub-lineages (A1 and A2). Individuals of lineage A2 were only from TLC. Demographic expansion was observed in each lineage, starting within the second-to-latest interglacial period for lineage A and within the last glacial period for lineage B. All FST values among the ten populations were significantly different, except for the values between MRC and JRC, and SMR and SRC. The phylogeography and genetic structure of M. nipponense in East Asia might be influenced by Pleistocene glacial cycles, lake isolation and human introduction. The possible dispersal routes of M. nipponense in the East Asia were also discussed.

W.\n\n2007-12-01\n\nThe Earth's magnetic field in the ionosphere is understood to be non-dipolar with significant deviations in magnitude and orientation across the globe. This study models the mid-latitude ionospheric response to a geomagnetic storm for different idealizations of the Earth's magnetic field strength. In so doing the study addresses the question whether or not a longitude dependence in ionospheric storm responses could exist due to the longitude dependence of the magnetic field [ Huang et al., 2005], and if so, how significant is the effect? The mechanism by which the magnetic field magnitude has a first order effect is through the E x B plasma drift that has a vertical components, i.e., usually described as a meridional plasma drift caused by the zonal electric field. This vertical drift is inversely proportional to the magnitude of the magnetic field. A vertical drift raises or lowers the F-region into regions of lesser or greater recombination rates respectively, hence, directly affecting the plasma density. The Utah State University (USU) Time Dependent Ionospheric Model (TDIM) uses a tilted dipole magnetic field model to represent the Earth's field. The magnitude of magnetic field is specified by the dipole moment, in fact, the magnetic field strength on the surface of the Earth at the magnetic equator. Changing this one parameter enables studies to be made under identical storm conditions of the effect of different magnetic field magnitudes. For this study the normal 0.31 Gauss surface magnetic field is replaced by 0.24 Gauss and 0.41 Gauss. These two numbers represent the magnitude of the minimum and maximum observed field strength around the Earth equatorial region. The TDIM results are shown for a storm simulation that occurred on 5-6 November 2001. For otherwise identical model conditions and drivers, the difference in magnetic field strength results in a factor of 2 difference in TEC, NmF2, etc. Since the magnetic field magnitude is weakest in the Atlantic\n\nType of faulting and orientation of stress and strain as a function of space and time in Kilauea's south flank, Hawaii\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nGillard, D.; Wyss, M.; Okubo, P.\n\n1996-01-01\n\nEarthquake focal mechanisms of events occurring between 1972 and 1992 in the south flank of Kilauea volcano, Hawaii, are used to infer the state of stress and strain as a function of time and space. We have determined 870 fault plane solutions from P wave first motion polarities for events with magnitudes ML ??? 2.5 and depth ranging between 6 and 12 km. Faulting is characterized by a mixture of decollement, reverse, and normal faults. Most large earthquakes with magnitude M 7 rupture the decollement plane, since it is the only surface large enough to generate magnitude 7 or larger earthquakes. The percentage of reverse faulting events is high compared to the decollement and normal faulting mechanisms for the period 1972-1983. The percentage of decollement type focal mechanisms becomes dominant after 1983. This pattern of faulting activity suggests that pressure was building up within Kilauea's rift zone prior to the 1983 Puu'Oo eruption. Overall, a single stress orientation with the maximum compressive stress oriented SE perpendicular to the rift and dipping at 45?? is compatible with the coeval existence of decollement, reverse, and normal faults. However, in a crustal volume east of longitude 155??10'W, we find a change of the orientation of ??1 from nearly horizontal to plunging 45?? SE occurring in 1979. This stress rotation suggests magma movements within the aseismic part of Kilauea's east rift zone. The strain and stress orientations are coaxial in the south flank except within the volume where the stress rotation is observed. We observe a change in the relationship between stress and strain directions caused either by the shifting of seismic activity from reverse faults to decollements, while stress stays constant, or by a rotation of stress, while strain remains constant. Assuming that the model of a noncohesive Coulomb wedge is appropriate for Kilauea's south flank, we find that high pore pressures are prevalent along the decollement and within the wedge\n\nIs it possible to receive information about the historical geomagnetic declination from church orientations?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDraxler, Andrea; Rauch, Roman; Gruber, Karin; Leohardt, Roman\n\n2013-04-01\n\nIt is widely known that the main structure of many churches was planned and built in an east-ward direction. This procedure, called \"easting\", was used for centuries especially in catholic structures. \"Easting\" usually refers to the direction of sunrise at the church patron's day. Assuming however that this direction is estimated by compasses there could be a significant correlation between the geographic orientation of the churches and the value of magnetic declination at the date of building. In Europe compasses are known since the 11th century. For this study altogether 124 churches located in lower Austria and built between 1100 to 1900 were analysed. Of primary interest is the geographic orientation of the churches, which was extracted out of georeferenced satellite images in Google Earth and the NO Atlas. The measured orientation of the church's nave is then compared to the geographic east direction as well as to the magnetic east direction, according to the magnetic field in the church's construction year which is determined by published geomagnetic field models. The resulting deviations for the geographic east direction split our data into two groups: churches that were built before 1500 and churches that were constructed after 1500. The boundary between these two data sets is marked by the Ottoman wars in the 16th century, where a lot of churches were destroyed. After 1500 the differences between the church's orientation and the geographic east direction are significantly bigger than before the Ottoman wars, so we shifted our focus for the following calculations on the time span from 1100 to 1500, where we found quite small deviations for both the geographic and the magnetic east direction. The principle idea of church orientation, usually referred to as \"Easting\" is to direct the church to the point of sunrise on the patron saint's day. Therefore we also calculated the solar azimuth on the patron saint's day and compared it to the orientation of the\n\nPerspective View of Venus (Center Latitude 45 Degrees N., Center Longitude 11 Degrees E.)\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1992-01-01\n\nThis perspective view of Venus, generated by computer from Magellan data and color-coded with emissivity, shows part of the lowland plains in Sedna Planitia. Circular depressions with associated fracture patterns called 'coronae' are apparently unique to the lowlands of Venus, and tend to occur in linear clusters along the planet's major tectonic belts. Coronae differ greatly in size and detailed morphology: the central depression may or may not lie below the surrounding plains, and may or may not be surrounded by a raised rim or a moat outside the rim. The corona shown here is relatively small (100 km in diameter and 1 km deep) and is of the subtype known as an 'arachnoid' because of the spider-like configuration of concentric (body) and radial (legs) fractures. Coronae are thought to be caused by localized 'hot spot' magmatic activity in Venus' subsurface. Intrusion of magma into the crust first pushes up the surface, after which cooling and contraction create the central depression and generate a pattern of concentric fractures. In some cases, lava may be extruded onto the surface. The fractured ridge at the left is classified as a 'nova' or 'stellate fracture center' and is believed to represent an early phase of corona formation, in which subsidence due to cooling has not yet created the central depression, and the fracture pattern is still entirely radial.

The bright lobate features along the southern and the western part of the image, oriented in northeast to southwest directions, are lava flows that are rough at the 12.6 centimeter wavelength of the radar. These flows range in width from 5 kilometers to 25 kilometers (3 to 16 miles) with lengths of 50 kilometers to 100 kilometers (31 to 62 miles), extending off the area shown here. Additional radar-dark (smooth) flows are also present. The radar-bright linear structures in the northwest part of the image are interpreted to be faults and fractures possibly associated with the emplacement of magma in the subsurface. Located near the center of the image is a 20 kilometer (12 mile) diameter impact crater. This crater is superimposed on a northeast/southwest trending fracture while the southern part of the crater's ejecta blanket is covered by a 6 kilometer (4 mile) wide radar-bright lava flow. These relations indicate that the crater post dates an episode of fracturing and is older than the lava flows covering its southern edge. This is one of only a few places on Venus in which an impact crater is seen to be covered by volcanic deposits.\n\nHot spots and active longitudes: Organization of solar activity as a probe of the interior\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBai, Taeil; Hoeksema, J. Todd; Scherrer, Phil H.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nIn order to investigate how solar activity is organized in longitude, major solar flares, large sunspot groups, and large scale photospheric magnetic field strengths were analyzed. The results of these analyses are reported. The following results are discussed: hot spots, initially recognized as areas of high concentration of major flares, are the preferred locations for the emergence of big sunspot groups; double hot spots appear in pairs that rotate at the same rate separated by about 180 deg in longitude, whereas, single hot spots have no such companions; the northern and southern hemispheres behave differently in organizing solar activity in longitude; the lifetime of hot spots range from one to several solar cycles; a hot spot is not always active throughout its lifetime, but goes through dormant periods; and hot spots with different rotational periods coexist in the same hemisphere during the same solar cycle.\n\nDistribution of activity at the solar active longitudes between 1979 - 2011 in the northern hemisphere\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGyenge, N.; Baranyi, T.; LudmÃ¡ny, A.\n\nThe solar active longitudes were studied in the northern hemisphere in cycles 22 and 23 by using data of DPD sunspot catalogue. The active longitudes are not fixed in the Carrington system, they have a well recognizable migration path between the descending phase of cycle 21 (from about 1984) and ascending phase of cycle 23 (until about 1996), out of this interval the migration path is ambiguous. The longitudinal distribution on both sides of the path has been computed and averaged for the length of the path. The so-called flip-flop phenomenon, when the activity temporarily gets to the opposite longitude, can also be recognized. The widths of the active domains are fairly narrow in the increasing and decaying phases of cycle 22, their half widths are about 20Â°-30Â° for both the main and secondary active belts but it is more flat and stretched around the maximum with a half width of about 60Â°.\n\nStatistical Analysis of Temple Orientation in Ancient India\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAller, Alba; Belmonte, Juan Antonio\n\n2015-05-01\n\nThe great diversity of religions that have been followed in India for over 3000 years is the reason why there are hundreds of temples built to worship dozens of different divinities. In this work, more than one hundred temples geographically distributed over the whole Indian land have been analyzed, obtaining remarkable results. For this purpose, a deep analysis of the main deities who are worshipped in each of them, as well as of the different dynasties (or cultures) who built them has also been conducted. As a result, we have found that the main axes of the temples dedicated to Shiva seem to be oriented to the east cardinal point while those temples dedicated to Vishnu would be oriented to both the east and west cardinal points. To explain these cardinal directions we propose to look back to the origins of Hinduism. Besides these cardinal orientations, clear solar orientations have also been found, especially at the equinoctial declination.\n\nIce crystal c-axis orientation and mean grain size measurements from the Dome Summit South ice core, Law Dome, East Antarctica\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTreverrow, Adam; Jun, Li; Jacka, Tim H.\n\n2016-06-01\n\nWe present measurements of crystal c-axis orientations and mean grain area from the Dome Summit South (DSS) ice core drilled on Law Dome, East Antarctica. All measurements were made on location at the borehole site during drilling operations. The data are from 185 individual thin sections obtained between a depth of 117 m below the surface and the bottom of the DSS core at a depth of 1196 m. The median number of c-axis orientations recorded in each thin section was 100, with values ranging from 5 through to 111 orientations. The data from all 185 thin sections are provided in a single comma-separated value (csv) formatted file which contains the c-axis orientations in polar coordinates, depth information for each core section from which the data were obtained, the mean grain area calculated for each thin section and other data related to the drilling site. The data set is also available as a MATLABâ¢ structure array. Additionally, the c-axis orientation data from each of the 185 thin sections are summarized graphically in figures containing a Schmidt diagram, histogram of c-axis colatitudes and rose plot of c-axis azimuths.

The GEO arena is home to hundreds of communications, data transmission, and intelligence satellites collectively insured for an estimated 18.3 billion USD. As the lack of natural cleansing mechanisms at the GEO altitude renders the lifetimes of GEO debris essentially infinite, conjunction and risk assessment must be performed to safeguard operational assets from debris collisions. In this thesis, longitude-dependent debris congestion is characterized by predicting the number of near-miss events per day for every longitude slot at GEO, using custom debris propagation tools and a torus intersection metric. Near-miss events with the present-day debris population are assigned risk levels based on GEO-relative position and speed, and this risk information is used to prioritize the population for debris removal target selection. Long-term projections of debris growth under nominal launch traffic, mitigation practices, and fragmentation events are also discussed, and latitudinal synchronization of the GEO debris population is explained via node variations arising from luni-solar gravity. In addition to characterizing localized debris congestion in the GEO ring, this thesis further investigates the conjunction risk to operational satellites or debris removal systems applying low-thrust propulsion to raise orbit altitude at end-of-life to a super-synchronous disposal orbit. Conjunction risks as a function of thrust level, miss distance, longitude, and semi-major axis are evaluated, and a guidance method for evading conjuncting debris with continuous thrust by means of a thrust heading change via single-shooting is developed.\n\nReal Research In The Classroom - Solar Active Longitudes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStagg, T.; Gearen, M.; Jacoby, S. H.; Jones, H. P.; Henney, C. J.; Hill, F.\n\n2000-12-01\n\nWe present a high-school level educational/research module for a project that improves computer and analytical skills and contributes new scientific results to the field of solar astronomy and physics. The module has been developed within the RET (Research Experience for Teachers) program as a new application of a cooperative project between the RBSE (Research-Based Science Education) initiative of the NSF and the NASA Education/Public Outreach program. The research goal is to improve our knowledge of the characteristics of solar active longitudes, where sunspots tend to cluster. In particular, the rotation rate of these regions is poorly known. It is suspected that the active longitude rotation rate (ALRR) is different from the rotation rate of the solar surface. If this is true, the ALRR can be compared with the internal rotation rate deduced by helioseismology providing an estimate of the active region depth. A good determination of the ALRR requires the measurement of the position of thousands of individual active regions, a step best done by interactive examination of images, selection of regions, and determination of heliographic position. These tasks are well-suited for high school students, who are thus provided with a motivation to improve their computer and scientific thinking skills. ScionImage (PC)/NIH Image (Macs) macros for this purpose have been developed which access a CD-ROM of 25 years of NSO/Kitt Peak magnetogram data and laboratory exercises developed previously for classroom use. In the future, a web site will be created for collecting the data from classrooms across the US, and for status reports on the results.\n\nLarge longitude libration of Mercury reveals a molten core.\n\nPubMed\n\nMargot, J L; Peale, S J; Jurgens, R F; Slade, M A; Holin, I V\n\n2007-05-04\n\nObservations of radar speckle patterns tied to the rotation of Mercury establish that the planet occupies a Cassini state with obliquity of 2.11 +/- 0.1 arc minutes. The measurements show that the planet exhibits librations in longitude that are forced at the 88-day orbital period, as predicted by theory. The large amplitude of the oscillations, 35.8 +/- 2 arc seconds, together with the Mariner 10 determination of the gravitational harmonic coefficient C22, indicates that the mantle of Mercury is decoupled from a core that is at least partially molten.\n\nM2 ocean tide parameters and the deceleration of the moon's mean longitude from satellite orbit data\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nFelsentreger, T.

G.\n\n1979-01-01\n\nAn estimation is made of the principal long-period spherical harmonic parameters in the representation of the M2 ocean tide from the orbital histories of the three satellites 1967-92A, Starlette, and GEOS 3. The data used are primarily the evolution of the orbital inclinations of the satellites in conjunction with the longitude of the ascending node from GEOS 3. Analysis procedure and analytic formulation, as well as ocean tidal parameter estimation and deceleration of the lunar mean longitude are outlined. The credibility of the M2 ocean tide solution is further enhanced by the close accord between the computed value for the deceleration of the lunar mean longitude and other recently reported estimates. It is evident from the results presented that studies of close earth satellite orbits are able to provide important information about the tidal forces acting on the earth.\n\nEast Candor Chasma\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1997-01-01\n\nDuring its examination of Mars, the Viking 1 spacecraft returned images of Valles Marineris, a huge canyon system 5,000 km long, up to 240 km wide, and 6.5 km deep, whose connected chasma or valleys may have formed from a combination of erosional collapse and structural activity. The view shows east Candor Chasma, one of the connected valleys of Valles Marineris; north toward top of frame; for scale, the impact crater in upper right corner is 15 km (9 miles) wide. The image, centered at latitude 7.5 degrees S., longitude 67.5 degrees, is a composite of Viking 1 Orbiter high-resolution (about 80 m/pixel or picture element) images in black and white and low-resolution (about 250 m/pixel) images in color. The Viking 1 craft landed on Mars in July of 1976. East Candor Chasma occupies the eastern part of the large west-northwest-trending trough of Candor Chasma. This section is about 150 km wide. East Candor Chasma is bordered on the north and south by walled cliffs, most likely faults. The walls may have been dissected by landslides forming reentrants; one area on the north wall shows what appears to be landslide debris. Both walls show spur-and-gully morphology and smooth sections. In the lower part of the image northwest-trending, linear depressions on the plateau are younger graben or fault valleys that cut the south wall. Material central to the chasma shows layering in places and has been locally eroded by the wind to form flutes and ridges. These interior layered deposits have curvilinear reentrants carved into them, and in one locale a lobe flows away from the top of the interior deposit. The lobe may be mass-wasting deposits due to collapse of older interior deposits (Lucchitta, 1996, LPSC XXVII abs., p. 779- 780); this controversial idea requires that the older layered deposits were saturated with ice, perhaps from former lakes, and that young volcanism and/or tectonism melted the ice and made the material flow.\n\nWere Greek temples oriented towards aurorae?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiritzis, Ioannis; Vassiliou, Helen\n\n2006-02-01\n\nTwo ancient Greek temples of Apollo at Bassae (Phigaleia, western Peloponnese, Greece), and Thermon at Aetolia, (Aetoloacarnania, western central Greece), have a north-south orientation of their main entrances. This is a rather rare alignment of temples in general and specifically of Apollo in classical Greece, where most of them have broadly an east-west orientation. Based on historical and mythological accounts, as well as astronomical orientation measurements, the northern direction orientation of these constructions may relate to the rare, albeit impressive, occurrence of aurorae borealis, the northern lights. These strong lights are attributed to god Apollo by the epithet ``hyperborean'', meaning to the northern lands. Attribution is supported by archaeomagnetic directional data accompanied by auroral occurrence during those times.\n\nMineral facilities of Africa and the Middle East\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nEros, J.M.; Candelario-Quintana, Luissette\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThis map displays over 1,500 mineral facilities in Africa and the Middle East. The mineral facilities include mines, plants, mills, or refineries of aluminum, cement, coal, copper, diamond, gold, iron and steel, nickel, platinum-group metals, salt, and silver, among others. The data used in this poster were compiled from multiple sources, including the 2004 USGS Minerals Yearbook (Africa and Middle East volume), Minerals Statistics and Information from the USGS Web site (http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/), and data collected by USGS minerals information country specialists. Data reflect the most recent published table of industry structure for each country. Other sources include statistical publications of individual countries, annual reports and press releases of operating companies, and trade journals. Due to the sensitivity of some energy commodity data, the quality of these data should be evaluated on a country-by-country basis. Additional information and explanation is available from the country specialists. See Table 1 for general information about each mineral facility site including country, location and facility name, facility type, latitude, longitude, mineral commodity, mining method, main operating company, status, capacity, and units.\n\nPole orientation of 16 Psyche by two independent methods\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nTedesco, E.

C.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nNineteen new lightcurves of 16 Psyche are presented along with a pole orientation derived using two independent methods, namely, photometric astrometry and magnitude-amplitude-shape-aspect. The pole orientations found using these two methods agree to within 4 deg. The results from applying photometric astrometry were prograde rotation, a sidereal period of 0.1748143 days + or - 0.0000003 days, and a pole at longitude 223 deg and latitude +37 deg, with an uncertainty of 10 deg, and, from applying magnitude-amplitude-shape-aspect a pole at 220 + or - 1 deg, +40 + or - 4 deg, and a modeled triaxial ellipsoid shape (a greater than b greater than c) and a/b = 1.33 + or - 0.07. The discrepancy between the high-pole latitude found here and the low latitudes reported by Lupishko et al. (1982) and Zhou and Yang (1982) is discussed.\n\n12.2-GHz methanol maser MMB follow-up catalogue - IV. Longitude range 20Â°-60Â°\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBreen, S. L.; Ellingsen, S. P.; Caswell, J. L.; Green, J. A.; Voronkov, M. A.; Avison, A.; Fuller, G. A.; Quinn, L. J.\n\n2016-07-01\n\nThis is the fourth and final instalment of a series of catalogues presenting 12.2-GHz methanol maser observations made towards each of the 6.7-GHz methanol masers detected in the Methanol Multibeam (MMB) survey. This final portion of the survey covers the 20Â°-60Â° longitude range, increasing the 12.2-GHz follow-up range to the full MMB coverage of 186Â° â¥ l â¤ 60Â° and |b| â¤ 2Â°. Towards a total of 260 6.7-GHz MMB methanol masers (we were unable to observe five of the MMB sources in this longitude range) we detect 116 12.2-GHz masers counterparts, 64 of which were discovered in this survey. Including data from the literature, we find that there are 12.2-GHz methanol masers towards 47.1 per cent of the 6.7-GHz methanol masers in this portion of the Galaxy. Across the entire MMB survey range, we find a detection rate of 45.3 per cent. We find that the detection rate of 12.2-GHz methanol masers as a function of Galactic longitude is not uniform and there is an excess of masers with broad velocity ranges at longitudes near 30Â° and 330Â°. Comparing the occurrence of 12.2-GHz methanol masers with MMB-targeted CO observations has shown that those outflows associated with a 12.2-GHz source have a larger average dynamical time-scale than those associated with only 6.7-GHz methanol masers, supporting the notion that the 12.2-GHz masers are associated with a later phase of high-mass star formation.\n\nObservations of Solar Energetic Particles from 3He-rich Events over a Wide Range of Heliographic Longitude\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWiedenbeck, M. E.; Mason, G. M.; Cohen, C. M. S.; Nitta, N. V.; GÃ³mez-Herrero, R.; Haggerty, D. K.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nA prevailing model for the origin of 3He-rich solar energetic particle (SEP) events attributes particle acceleration to processes associated with the reconnection between closed magnetic field lines in an active region and neighboring open field lines. The open field from the small reconnection volume then provides a path along which accelerated particles escape into a relatively narrow range of angles in the heliosphere. The narrow width (standard deviation <20Â°) of the distribution of X-ray flare longitudes found to be associated with 3He-rich SEP events detected at a single spacecraft at 1 AU supports this model. We report multispacecraft observations of individual 3He-rich SEP events that occurred during the solar minimum time period from 2007 January through 2011 January using instrumentation carried by the two Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory spacecraft and the Advanced Composition Explorer. We find that detections of 3He-rich events at pairs of spacecraft are not uncommon, even when their longitudinal separation is >60Â°. We present the observations of the 3He-rich event of 2010 February 7, which was detected at all three spacecraft when they spanned 136Â° in heliographic longitude. Measured fluences of 3He in this event were found to have a strong dependence on longitude which is well fit by a Gaussian with standard deviation ~48Â° centered at the longitude that is connected to the source region by a nominal Parker spiral magnetic field. We discuss several mechanisms for distributing flare-accelerated particles over a wide range of heliographic longitudes including interplanetary diffusion perpendicular to the magnetic field, spreading of a compact cluster of open field lines between the active region and the source surface where the field becomes radial and opens out into the heliosphere, and distortion of the interplanetary field by a preceding coronal mass ejection.

This experimental work adds to the knowledge available on the microclimate of an urban canyon and its impact on human comfort. Air temperature T a , air humidity VP, wind speed v and direction dd were measured continuously. All short-wave and long-wave radiation fluxes from the 3D surroundings were also measured. The degree of comfort was defined in terms of physiologically equivalent temperature (PET). Furthermore, the data gathered within the canyon were compared to data collected by a permanent urban climate station with the aim of furthering the understanding of microclimatic changes due to street geometry. Changes in the meteorological variables T a , v and dd in the canyon in comparison to an unobstructed roof level location were found to be in good agreement with previous studies, i.e., a small increase of T a in the canyon adjacent to irradiated surfaces, and a good correlation of v and dd between canyon and roof levels. The daily dynamics of canyon facet irradiances and their impacts on the heat gained by a pedestrian were strongly dependent on street geometry and orientation. Thermal stress was mostly attributable to solar exposure. Under cloudless summer weather, a standing body was found to absorb, on average, 74% of heat in the form of long-wave irradiance and 26% as short-wave irradiance. Shading the pedestrian as well as the surrounding surfaces is, hence, the first strategy in mitigating heat stress in summer under hot conditions.\n\nTime and Time Again; Determination of longitude at sea in the 17th Century\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nde Grijs, Richard\n\n2017-11-01\n\nDetermination of one's longitude at sea has perplexed sailors for many centuries. The significant uptake of world trade in the 17th and 18th Centuries rendered the increasingly urgent need to solve the 'longitude problem', an issue of strategic national importance. Historical accounts of these efforts often focus almost exclusively on John Harrison's role in 18th-Century Britain. This book starts instead from Galileo Galilei's late-16th-Century development of an accurate pendulum clock, which was first achieved in practice in the mid-17th-Century by Christiaan Huygens in the Dutch Republic. It is primarily based on collections of letters that have not been combined into a single volume before. Extensive introductory chapters on the history of map making, the establishment of the world's reference meridian at Greenwich Observatory, and the rise of the scientific enterprise provide the appropriate context for non-expert readers to fully engage with the book's main subject matter.\n\nWilhelm von Humboldt and the \"Orient\": On Edward W.

In 2007, the World Health Organization (WHO) advanced a handbook called Global Age-friendly Cities: A Guide The core concept of the age-friendly cities (AFC) movement is 'active ageing'. Taiwan became one of the few Asian countries that initially responded to the WHO AFC movement in 2010. Following the guidance set by the WHO, Taiwan began its promotion at a national level, and with local authorities. However, during the advocacy process, the fundamental differences between Eastern and Western cultures in terms of family values and deep-rooted respect for the elderly have raised an awareness of the need for an oriental paradigm. This paper identifies three key elements for AFC promotion in East Asian countries based on an analysis of Taiwan's experience: during needs assessment take collectivism into consideration, during action plans at the community level community leaders' views will be more important (particularism), and when promoting AFC at the institutional level a top-down approach will be more acceptable (high power distance concept).

The mission used the same radar instrument that comprised the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR)that flew twice on Endeavour in 1994.

We also estimate the Gaia capabilities of detecting the predicted signatures. Methods: We use both controlled orbital integrations in analytic potentials and self-consistent simulations. We introduce a new strategy to investigate the effects of spiral arms, which consists of comparing the stellar kinematics of symmetric Galactic longitudes (+l and -l), in particular the median transverse velocity as determined from parallaxes and proper motions. This approach does not require the assumption of an axisymmetric model because it involves an internal comparison of the data. Results: The typical differences between the transverse velocity in symmetric longitudes in the models are of the order of ~2 km s-1, but can be larger than 10 km s-1 for certain longitudes and distances. The longitudes close to the Galactic centre and to the anti-centre are those with larger and smaller differences, respectively. The differences between the kinematics for +l and -l show clear trends that depend strongly on the properties of spiral arms. Thus, this method can be used to quantify the importance of the effects of spiral arms on the orbits of stars in the different regions of the disk, and to constrain the location of the arms, main resonances and, thus, pattern speed. Moreover, the method allows us to test different origin scenarios of spiral arms and the dynamical nature of the spiral structure (e.g. grand design versus transient multiple arms). We estimate the number of stars of each spectral type that Gaia will observe in certain representative Galactic longitudes, their characteristic errors in distance and transverse velocity, and the error in computing the median velocity as a function of distance. We will be able to measure the median transverse velocity exclusively with Gaia data, with precision smaller than ~1 km s-1 up to distances of ~4-6 kpc for\n\nEducation Indicators for East Asia and Pacific.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nAcedo, Clementina; Uemura, Mitsue\n\nThis set of education indicators for the World Bank's East Asia and Pacific Region is designed to provide key policy-oriented data for World Bank staff and clients.

First, libration changes the spectral distribution of tidal damping across the tidal modes, as compared to the case of steady spin. This changes both the tidal heating rate and the tidal torque. Second, while a non-librating rotator experiences alternating deformation only due to the potential force exerted on it by the perturber, a librating body is also subject to a toroidal force proportional to the angular acceleration. Third, while the centrifugal force in a steadily spinning body renders only a permanent deformation (which defines the oblateness when the body cools down), in a librating body this force contains two alternating components-one purely radial, another a degree-2 potential force. Both contribute to heating, as well as to the tidal torque and potential (and, thereby, to the orbital evolution). We develop a formalism needed to describe dissipation in a homogeneous terrestrial body performing small-amplitude libration in longitude. This formalism incorporates as its part a linear rheological law defining the response of the rotator's material to forcing. While the developed formalism can work with an arbitrary linear rheology, we consider a simple example of a Maxwell material. We demonstrate that, independent of the rheology, forced libration in longitude can provide a considerable and even leading-and sometimes overwhelming-input in the tidal heating. Based on the observed parameters, this input amounts to 52% in Phobos, 33% in Mimas, 23% in Enceladus, and 96% in Epimetheus. This supports the hypothesis by Makarov and Efroimsky (2014) that the additional tidal damping due to forced libration may have participated in the early heating up of some of the large moons. As one possibility, such a moon could have been chipped by collisions-whereby it acquired a higher permanent triaxiality and, therefore, a\n\nA Coastal Hazards Data Base for the U.S. East Coast (1992) (NDP-043a)\n\nDOE Data Explorer\n\nGornitz, Vivien M. [NASA Goddard Inst. for Space Studies (GISS), New York, NY (United States); White, Tammy W. [Oak Ridge National Lab. (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States)\n\n1992-01-01\n\nThis NDP presents data on coastal geology, geomorphology, elevation, erosion, wave heights, tide ranges, and sea levels for the U.S. east coast. These data may be used either by nongeographic database management systems or by raster or vector geographic information systems (GISs). The database integrates several data sets (originally obtained as point, line, and polygon data) for the east coast into 0.25Â°-latitude by 0.25Â°-longitude grid cells. Each coastal grid cell contains 28 data variables. This NDP may be used to predict the response of coastal zones on the U.S. east coast to changes in local or global sea levels. Information on the geologic, geomorphic, and erosional states of the coast provides the basic data needed to predict the behavior of the coastal zone into the far future. Thus, these data may be seen as providing a baseline for the calculation of the relative vulnerability of the east coast to projected sea-level rises. This data will also be useful to research, educational, governmental, and private organizations interested in the present and future vulnerability of coastal areas to erosion and inundation. The data are in 13 files, the largest of which is 1.42 MB; the entire data base takes up 3.29 MB, excluding the ARC/INFOTM files.\n\nA Geodetic Strain Rate Model for the East African Rift System.\n\nPubMed\n\nStamps, D S; Saria, E; Kreemer, C\n\n2018-01-15\n\nHere we describe the new Sub-Saharan Africa Geodetic Strain Rate Model v.1.0 (SSA-GSRM v.1.0), which provides fundamental constraints on long-term tectonic deformation in the region and an improved seismic hazards assessment in Sub-Saharan Africa. Sub-Saharan Africa encompasses the East African Rift System, the active divergent plate boundary between the Nubian and Somalian plates, where strain is largely accommodated along the boundaries of three subplates. We develop an improved geodetic strain rate field for sub-Saharan Africa that incorporates 1) an expanded geodetic velocity field, 2) redefined regions of deforming zones guided by seismicity distribution, and 3) updated constraints on block rotations. SSA-GSRM v.1.0 spans longitudes 22Â° to 55.5Â° and latitudes -52Â° to 20Â° with 0.25Â° (longitude) by 0.2Â° (latitude) spacing. For plates/sub-plates, we assign rigid block rotations as constraints on the strain rate calculation that is determined by fitting bicubic Bessel splines to a new geodetic velocity solution for an interpolated velocity gradient tensor field. We derive strain rates, velocities, and vorticity rates from the velocity gradient tensor field. A comparison with the Global Geodetic Strain Rate model v2.1 reveals regions of previously unresolved spatial heterogeneities in geodetic strain rate distribution, which indicates zones of elevated seismic risk.\n\nCharacteristics of Solar Energetic Ions as a Function of Longitude\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nCohen, C. M. S.; Mewaldt, R. A.; Mason, G. M., E-mail: cohen@srl.caltech.edu\n\nSince the 2006 launch of STEREO , multi-spacecraft studies have yielded several surprising results regarding the spread of solar energetic particles (SEPs) within the inner heliosphere. We have investigated the role of energy and ridigity, using ACE and STEREO 10 MeV n{sup â1} oxygen data to identify 41 large SEP events observed by two or three spacecraft. We calculated fluence spectra from â¼0.1 to >10 MeV n{sup â1} for H, He, O, and Fe for each event at the observing spacecraft (including SOHO and GOES ). The particle fluences at 0.3, 1, and 10 MeV n{sup â1} were examined asmoreÂ Â» a function of the distance between the associated solar flare longitude and the spacecraft magnetic footpoints at the Sun to determine the longitudinal spread of particles and study how the distribution centers and widths depend on energy and charge-to-mass (Q/M) for the first time. On average, the three-spacecraft event distributions were centered at 22 Â± 4Â° west of the flare site and were 43 Â± 1Â° wide, though there was substantial variability, while the fit to the aggregate of the two-spacecraft event fluences yielded significantly wider distributions at 0.3 and 1 MeV n{sup â1}. The widths derived from both the three- and two-spacecraft events show an energy dependence with distributions narrowing with increasing energy, consistent with lower energy ions experiencing more field line co-rotation, or being accelerated over a larger portion of the CME-driven shock or for longer times as the shock expands. Surprisingly, no clear evidence was found for a Q/M dependence to the widths or centers suggesting that rigidity-related processes are not the dominant means of spreading particles in longitude.Â«Â less\n\nActive Longitude and Solar Flare Occurrences\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGyenge, N.; LudmÃ¡ny, A.; Baranyi, T.\n\n2016-02-01\n\nThe aim of the present work is to specify the spatio-temporal characteristics of flare activity observed by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) in connection with the behavior of the longitudinal domain of enhanced sunspot activity known as active longitude (AL). By using our method developed for this purpose, we identified the AL in every Carrington Rotation provided by the Debrecen Photoheliographic Data. The spatial probability of flare occurrence has been estimated depending on the longitudinal distance from AL in the northern and southern hemispheres separately. We have found that more than 60% of the RHESSI and GOES flares is located within +/- 36^\\\\circ from the AL. Hence, the most flare-productive active regions tend to be located in or close to the active longitudinal belt. This observed feature may allow for the prediction of the geo-effective position of the domain of enhanced flaring probability. Furthermore, we studied the temporal properties of flare occurrence near the AL and several significant fluctuations were found. More precisely, the results of the method are the following fluctuations: 0.8, 1.3, and 1.8 years. These temporal and spatial properties of the solar flare occurrence within the active longitudinal belts could provide us with an enhanced solar flare forecasting opportunity.\n\nThe Orientations of the Giza Pyramids and Associated Structures\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNell, Erin; Ruggles, Clive\n\n2014-08-01\n\nEver since Flinders Petrie undertook a theodolite survey on the Giza plateau in 1881 and drew attention to the extraordinary degree of precision with which the three colossal pyramids are oriented upon the four cardinal directions, there have been a great many suggestions as to how this was achieved and why it was of importance. Surprisingly, given the many astronomical hypotheses and speculations that have been offered in the intervening 130 years, there have been remarkably few attempts to reaffirm or improve on the basic survey data concerning the primary orientations. This paper presents the results of a week-long Total Station survey undertaken by the authors during December 2006 whose principal aim was to clarify the basic data concerning the orientation of each side of the three large pyramids and to determine, as accurately as possible, the orientations of as many as possible of the associated structures. The principal difference between this and all previous surveys is that it focuses upon measurements of sequences of points along multiple straight and relatively well preserved structural segments, with best-fit techniques being used to provide the best estimate of their orientation, as opposed to simple triangulation between directly identified or extrapolated corners. Our results suggest that there is only a very slight difference in orientation (c. 0.5 arc minutes) between the north-south axes of Khufu's and Khafre's pyramids, that the sides of Khafre's are more perfectly perpendicular than those of Khufu's, and that the east-west axis is closer to true cardinality in both cases. The broader context of associated structures suggests that the east-west orientation in relation to sunrise or (in one case) sunset may have been a, or even the, key factor in many cases.\n\nGenetic counseling/consultation in South-East Asia: a report from the workshop at the 10th Asia pacific conference on human genetics.\n\nPubMed\n\nZayts, Olga; Sarangi, Srikant; Thong, Meow-Keong; Chung, Brian Hon-yin; Lo, Ivan Fao-man; Kan, Anita Sik-yau; Lee, Juliana Mei-har; Padilla, Carmencita David; Cutiongco-de la Paz, Eva Maria; Faradz, Sultana M H; Wasant, Pornswan\n\n2013-12-01\n\nThis paper reports on the workshop 'Genetic Counseling/Consultations in South-East Asia' at the 10(th) Asia Pacific Conference on Human Genetics in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in December 2012. The workshop brought together professionals and language/communication scholars from South-East Asia, and the UK. The workshop aimed at addressing culture- and context-specific genetic counseling/consultation practices in South-East Asia. As a way of contextualizing genetic counseling/consultation in South-East Asia, we first offer an overview of communication-oriented research generally, drawing attention to consultation and counseling as part of a communicative continuum with distinctive interactional features. We then provide examples of genetic counseling/consultation research in Hong Kong. As other countries in South-East Asia have not yet embarked on communication-oriented empirical research, we report on the current practices of genetic counseling/consultation in these countries in order to identify similarities and differences as well as key obstacles that could be addressed through future research. Three issues emerged as 'problematic': language, religion and culture. We suggest that communication-oriented research can provide a starting point for evidence-based reflections on how to incorporate a counseling mentality in genetic consultation. To conclude, we discuss the need for creating a platform for targeted training of genetic counselors based on communication-oriented research findings.\n\nFormation of post-spreading volcanic ridges in the East sub-basin of the South China Sea\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHe, E.; Zhao, M.; Sibuet, J. C.; Tan, P.; Wang, J.; Qiu, X.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nIn the South China Sea (SCS), the post-spreading magmatism ( 3-13 Ma) largely masks the initial seafloor spreading fabric. The resulting post-spreading seamounts are more numerous in the northern part than in the southern part of the East sub-basin. In the eastern part of the East sub-basin, the post-spreading volcanic ridge (PSVR) is approximately N055Â° oriented and follows the extinct spreading ridge (ESR). In the western part of the East sub-basin, the PSVR, called the Zhenbei-Huangyan seamounts chain, is E-W oriented and hides the ESR (Sibuet et al., 2016). We conducted a seismic refraction survey covering both the Zhenbei-Huangyan seamount chain and the location of the adjacen"
