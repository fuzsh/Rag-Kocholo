        "text": "\"Looking back at Center City’s successes and challenges over the last four years is important, but 'it might be time to stop talking about recovery. Maybe our cities will never go back, no matter how hard we will them, to where we were in 2019. And it’s time to embrace the unanticipated strengths but also the exposed vulnerabilities and really work hard to build a downtown that our region needs and that also is the sort of place that it should be.'\" said Prema Katari Gupta, president and chief executive officer of Center City District in Philadelphia. I think this is a really interesting article. Although the focus is on my hometown city and how Center City Philadelphia has recovered post-pandemic in many ways and has not recovered in some other ways, I think there is a lot of application to business as well. The question that Prema is asking is a question we have grappled with at the last two companies I have worked with. How valid was YOY comparison in 2021 or even 2022 - it really wasn't so we spent time comparing performance to 2019? While I think it made a lot of sense to compare 2021 to 2019 rather than 2020 and that validity probably extended to 2022 as well, there are still some organizations comparing 2024 to 2019 and I believe the shelf life may have expired on that comparison. Especially in our world of high inflation and high interest rates over the past year or two - how much are those issues playing into current year performance versus the lingering effects from the pandemic? I love one of the later quotes in the article and believe this is the way we should approach the current environment - \"Should [we] still be talking about that missing 16% or should focus on finding new residents and companies.\" Should we still be comparing performance to 2019 and fighting to try to get back to that level as the definition of success or benchmarking to whatever our \"new\" normal is? https://lnkd.in/exgf-VAD\n\nDan Doctoroff’s story has never been more pertinent. As urban hubs the world over continue to battle post-pandemic population dips - “a big danger” he says - the lessons to be learned from how he drew people back to New York after 9/11 by creating a “magnetic force” of strategic, city-wide public places and spaces are invaluable. So how did the former CEO of Bloomberg and deputy mayor of New York rebuild the city after 9/11 with no urban planning experience whatsoever? How did he become one of the world’s best known urban innovators, turning over 40 seemingly impossible projects including The High Line, The World Trade Center Site, Yankee Stadium, The Whitney Museum and Governors Island into a reality? How did he persuade Google’s parent company Alphabet Inc. to back his vision to launch the world’s first generation of digital cities by setting up and entirely new business arm for him to run? For the answer to all these questions, plus Dan’s take on his reputation for relentlessness and the lessons he holds dear following his ALS diagnosis, check out my interview with him over on my Substack page Well-Placed. https://lnkd.in/dsCssx8s Target ALS Sidewalk Labs (Part of Google) REBNY (Real Estate Board of New York) Mike Bloomberg Whitney Museum of American Art Friends of the High Line Trust for Governors Island The Friends of Governors Island #urbanplanning #urbaninnovation #placemaking #humandesign #newyork #cities\n\nNY Analysis of the Day: What Made New York Great? Leadership. Where Is It Now? (New York Times - Michael Kimmelman) The city was built on bold ideas. Suddenly Gov. Kathy Hochul paused a game-changing plan to fight congestion. Can we still do big things in a polarized moment? And have we lost the ability to do big things? It’s a question after Gov. Hochul suddenly put an “indefinite pause” on a plan to institute congestion pricing for driving in a large swath of Manhattan, an idea dating back some six decades to the Lindsay era, writes Michael Kimmelman. Hochul reflects today’s wider, fearful culture, increasingly distracted by partisan politics, focusing on swing voters, not swinging for the fences. She said, in effect, that she paused congestion pricing because it doesn’t poll well. It didn’t poll well before it was instituted in London or Stockholm, either, where it has been solving gridlock, increasing bus ridership and reducing asthma rates. Opinion shifted in those cities after residents saw the benefits. A year ago, M.T.A. officials also said that they would finally fix Penn Station. They swore last spring that by now they would produce an architectural design sufficiently evolved — and pin down local funding reliable and substantial enough — to apply for crucial federal money to redo the Western Hemisphere’s busiest and most appalling transit hub. Hochul’s “pause,” denying the M.T.A. the proceeds from tolls that were to have supplied that local funding, leaves this promise in limbo, too. New York can still accomplish big, meaningful change, Kimmelman writes. Case in point: The Bloomberg years inaugurated sweeping changes along the waterfront. Brooklyn Bridge Park and Hudson River Park have dramatically reshaped what had once been the city’s economic and industrial heart. Hunter’s Point South Park has transformed the waterfront of Long Island City. (As featured in my Sheekey Daily Read newsletter today) Read more of Kimmelman’s analysis here: https://lnkd.in/eNDmnGd2\n\nPost-pandemic, many cities in the US and UK are searching for ways to reinvent city centers and public spaces. One outcome of this is that people have started to question the amount of space historically allocated for parking. Is there still a need for minimum parking requirements? Some cities think not, with California being the first US state to bring in new legislation removing such requirements. Since the start of the 2023, four cities have eliminated minimum parking requirements, which will allow more space to promote further development, including housing, to revitalize city centers. Some communities in the US are even implementing maximum parking requirements, demonstrating a dramatic shift in mindset as to how we plan for equitable and sustainable growth. Different organizations in Atlanta show growing support of implementing parking maximums, such as Propel Atlanta and the Atlanta Bicycle Coalition. DLBP wonders what effect such changes will have on communities in Atlanta - a city infamous for its rush hour traffic. Reference Link: https://lnkd.in/gHhiDfxn\n\nHey LinkedIn community! We're continuing to have multiple conversations everyday with investors about Johnson City TN. Excited to kick off the month of December with some valuable insights into analyzing rental property deals in our town, and share some of the concepts we're discussing on the daily. Join me on this journey to break down the essentials. HOT TAKE: Location Matters In the world of real estate, location is key. Johnson City's unique charm and growing economy make it a promising market. Numerous publications and websites support that notion, if you don't quite believe me, yet. (DM me if you want some articles.) Every city has a few drawbacks...and so does JC. AND, Johnson City has so much going for it, and at a macro level, this is what I talk to investors about. #1 Economic hub of Northeast TN #2 University town with a medical school and a pharmacy school. #3 Level 1 Trauma Center/Hospital #4 Highly Ranked Public Schools #5 Resurgent Downtown #6 Low crime - Low traffic #7 Great Outdoor Activity Lifestyle #8 Four seasons #9 4-hour (or less) drive to Nashville, Charlotte, Atlanta #10 BrightRidge Broadband offers nation-leading 10GB symmetrical fiber #RealEstateInvesting #JohnsonCityTN #LocationMatters #RealEstate\n\nDowntown is BACK! “A new study of more than 60 downtowns across the U.S. and Canada places downtown Minneapolis at the top of the pack when it comes to an increase in visitors over the past year…A previous Downtown Recovery study in mid-2023 by the University of Toronto’s School of Cities determined that downtown Minneapolis was third to last in foot traffic recovery compared to the same period in 2019.” This type of progress doesn’t happen by accident, but is the result of hard work by small businesses, city leaders, local organizations, and community organizers. But most importantly this type of progress is the result on Minnesotans showing up and investing their time, money, and energy in the small businesses and local events at the forefront of downtown’s resurgence. Keep up the good work, Minnesota! #ShopLocal #ReadLocal #VoteLocal\n\nSan Francisco is back! San Francisco has a long history of ebbs and flows as boom and bust market cycles leave their mark on The City. Yet, it’s always rebounded as a beacon for builders and dreamers. This cycle was called into question after the pandemic exodus, with many questioning if San Francisco would ever recover, but it seems that The City by the Bay has continued its historical pattern of ebbs and flows and we are witnessing it rebound, yet again. This latest gold rush is being driven by AI - giving new life to the real estate market, startup ecosystem and recovering population numbers. AI companies are massively expanding their office space, growing from a 500,000 sq ft footprint in 2016, to 3.4m sq ft at the end of 2023. They’re also attracting funding at a rapidly increasing rate, to the tune of $4.7 billion in February - more than double the amount invested in January. This capital isn’t just going to office space, it’s attracting the world’s best talent too and that’s helped reverse the declining population trend that started in 2020. There were certainly dark days where even I wondered if San Francisco would ever return from the brink, but as history has taught us - this pattern has long been a core part of The City’s story.\n\nThis stunning view from our office at 7 World Trade reminds me of the unparalleled vitality and grandeur of New York. Even still, Denver is one of the most livable cities in the country and recent trends show it growing at an impressive rate, outpacing New York and most other places. Beyond growth, Denver leads New York in having lower unemployment, higher job growth, lower taxes, higher per capita income, higher household income and higher family median income. But what do both cities have in common? A crushing need to invest more in infrastructure. As Denver business leaders, we have a role to play in leading our city into the future with smart, scalable infrastructure solutions. We can and should do more and engage more — working together — to make it happen. #Denver #Infrastructure #SmartSolutions #BusinessLeadership\n\n📍Raleigh, North Carolina has solidified its position as a powerhouse city, earning accolades such as the third-best city to live in the nation according to US News, and a prime work destination, recognized by WalletHub. The city's prosperity is further heightened as it forms part of the renowned \"Research Triangle,\" a tech hub often hailed as the Silicon Valley of the East Coast, alongside Durham and Chapel Hill. 📈Recent corporate moves exemplify Raleigh's growing appeal. ProPharma, a leading research consulting firm, and Bandwidth, a communications company, have both chosen Raleigh as the new home for their headquarters. Moreover, tech giant Apple is gearing up to establish its main East Coast campus in the Research Triangle. These strategic relocations signify not only the city's allure but also its rising prominence in the tech and business sectors. 💙One standout event in 2023 was the acquisition of Silicon Valley Bank by Raleigh-based First Citizens Bank. This strategic move resulted in a staggering 80% surge in First Citizens Bank's stock value, underlining the city's robust financial environment and its ability to foster successful business endeavors. ➡️For those considering real estate, the current climate in Raleigh presents an opportune moment to buy or sell a home. The influx of renowned companies and the impending establishment of Apple's East Coast campus are expected to stimulate job growth and drive demand for housing. As more professionals and businesses flock to the Research Triangle, the real estate market is poised to experience increased activity and appreciation. ❤️Raleigh's growing reputation as a thriving business and tech hub not only enhances the quality of life but also makes it an attractive destination for those seeking both professional opportunities and a vibrant community.
