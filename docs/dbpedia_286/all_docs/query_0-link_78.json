A wrap-around ramp, with viewing windows along the way, leads up and around the tank to exhibits on other floors that range from penguins to octopus to jellyfish. We spent a full day at the aquarium, enjoying the exhibits, taking a behind-the-scenes tour, and watching two ocean-themed IMAX films.\n\nTrip highlights from our day in downtown Boston and at the aquarium follow.
