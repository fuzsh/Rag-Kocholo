        "text": "Blizzard conditions, severe thunderstorms, damaging winds, heavy rain and bitter cold is lashing parts of the eastern US, as more than 70 million people are under winter weather alerts Friday.\n\nThe massive storm is only one piece in a very active weather pattern. Multiple weather hazards were impacting the country Friday morning, and the National Weather Service issued some kind of weather alert for every state.\n\nEverything from blizzard warnings to tornado warnings were in effect early Friday as the massive storm worked its way across the eastern half of the US. Wind alerts stretch nearly 2,000 miles from Texas to New England, while flood alerts span from the mid-Atlantic to Northeast.\n\nIf you’re just reading in now, here’s what you should know:\n\nSnow and blizzard conditions: Snow was forecast Friday to once again bury portions of the Midwest as a powerful storm tracks through the region Friday and Saturday. The combination of heavy snow and strong winds could make travel dangerous and even impossible in some areas, especially through Friday night. Whiteout conditions are possible from Iowa to Michigan, and people may even find themselves stuck in a blizzard. Iowa is one of the states where blizzard conditions were expected Friday.\n\nSevere thunderstorms: While the northern side of the storm will deliver snowy and windy conditions, severe thunderstorms were forecast Friday on the southern side — including for a significant portion of the South and portions of the mid-Atlantic. More than 5 million people across portions of Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Tennessee and Mississippi were under a tornado watch as intense thunderstorms rumbled across the South Friday morning.\n\nFlooding: Another bout of rain was forecast to fall on the already-soaked Northeast Friday, threatening to trigger disruptive and damaging coastal flooding in several of the region’s major cities through Saturday. More than seven million people were under coastal flood warnings along swaths of the Northeast Friday, including residents of Philadelphia and parts of New York, where Nassau and Suffolk Counties could be overwhelmed with up to three feet of coastline flooding.\n\nTravel trouble: The number of flight delays and cancellations is ticking up as the Midwest and South are experiencing messy conditions due to the storm.\n\nPreparations across the US: The mayor of Buffalo, New York, says the area is prepared for this weekend’s winter weather — and they’re not expecting the type of storm the city dealt with in late 2022, when dozens died. In Arkansas, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders declared a state of emergency. And former President Donald Trump’s campaign on Friday canceled three out of the four in-person campaign events he was scheduled to hold just days before the Iowa caucuses due to extreme weather in the state.\n\nBack-to-back storms have hammered the Midwest with heavy snow this week. For Des Moines, Iowa, the one-two punch has resulted the snowiest week since 1942.\n\nThe early-week storm brought a foot of snow to the city, while the late-week storm has totaled about nine inches. Combined, Des Moines has seen 21.3 inches of snow since Monday.\n\nWhere weather conditions stand now: The snow is tapering off this evening, but wind gusts of 30 to 45 mph will continue tonight and all day Saturday. A blizzard warning is in effect until 6 p.m. Saturday due to continued blowing snow which will create white-out conditions.\n\nTemperatures in Des Moines will remain in the single digits tonight and much of Saturday before dropping below zero Saturday afternoon. Once temperatures drop below zero they will remain there for all of Sunday and Monday — just in time for the 2024 Iowa caucuses, which are expected to be the coldest ever. Wind chills across the state will be as cold as -30 to -45 degrees this weekend into early next week.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s campaign on Friday canceled three out of the four in-person campaign events he was scheduled to hold just days before the Iowa caucuses due to extreme weather in the state.\n\nTrump canceled both rallies scheduled for Saturday in Sioux City and Atlantic, and is now holding a tele-rally featuring Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird in the evening.\n\nAs of now, Trump is still scheduled to hold one in-person rally on Sunday in Indianola. His campaign canceled the second rally he was slated to hold in Cherokee and will instead hold a tele-rally with Iowa State Rep. Bobby Kaufmann.\n\nOther candidates have also had to cancel campaign events leading up to the caucuses because of extreme weather in the state.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Des Moines is warning of “treacherous driving” conditions as well as possible “white-out conditions” as winds become stronger.\n\nWinter storms are bringing severe weather to several parts of the US this weekend — including the kind of brutal cold that can cause frostbite.\n\nFrostbite happens when the skin and the tissue under the skin freezes, which can happen much more quickly than you might imagine. It can cause blood clots, gangrene, and long-lasting damage to muscles, tendons, nerves and bones.\n\nThe cause: Frostbite is affected by both the outside temperature and the wind chill factor. As the speed of the wind increases, our bodies cool at a faster rate, causing the skin temperature to drop. Higher altitudes can also increase the speed at which skin can freeze.\n\nThe National Weather Service has created a wind chill chart that shows the time it might take to develop frostbite at varying temperatures and wind speed. It shows that your skin would freeze in a scant five minutes if you were out in minus 25 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 31.7 degrees Celsius) with a wind speed of just over 25 miles per hour.\n\nRisk factors: You are more susceptible to frostbite if you smoke, take medications called beta-blockers, have poor blood supply to the legs, or have diabetes or Raynaud syndrome, a condition in which strong emotions or cold temperatures cause blood vessels to spasm and block blood flow to extremities.\n\nOlder people and people who live outside without proper clothing, heating and food are also at high risk, as are hikers and hunters who aren’t properly clothed and stay outdoors too long.\n\nHere’s more on how to avoid frostbite.\n\nThere are now more than 2,000 flight cancellations in the US, according to FlightAware data.\n\nLast year, there were only three days when more than 2,000 flights were canceled, FlightAware data show, making today the fourth worst day for flight cancellations in the last 12 months. It is the most flights cancelled since une 2023.\n\nThe vast majority of the cancellations are weather-related, though the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft after a piece of one plane flew off mid-flight is also contributing to the disruptions.\n\nChicago is the hardest-hit area, with O’Hare and Midway airports leading the way with cancellations.\n\nSouthwest has the most cancellations – more than 400, or 10% of its flights, according to FlightAware. It does not fly the 737 Max 9 and thus is not impacted by the FAA-mandated grounding.\n\nIn addition to the cancellations, 4,700 flights have been delayed, FlightAware data show.\n\nMaine officials say an iconic state landmark dating back to the 19th century suffered significant damage after it was struck by high waves and winds during the powerful storm sweeping across the eastern half of the United States.\n\nOnly one wall of the Pemaquid Point Lighthouse Park bell house, built in 1897, is still standing after 79 mph winds struck it Wednesday, according to Bristol Parks and Recreation Department director Shelley Gallagher.\n\nGallagher said that — with another powerful storm on the horizon — time is essential to ensure more harm isn’t done to the building. Officials have taken steps to shore up what remains of the structure, but are “very concerned” it isn’t enough, Gallagher said.\n\nThe bell house was built to store a 1,000-pound bell that alerted sailors when fog set in and they couldn’t see the lighthouse, according to Gallagher.\n\nLuckily, the bell was not damaged in the storm — it was moved at the end of August because the beam on which it hung was rotting.\n\nHeavy snow and blizzard conditions will continue to blast portions of the Midwest. Strong winds will also ramp up across the region, reaching their peak once the powerful storm hits its full strength Friday evening.\n\nThunderstorms will continue to roll across the Southeast, where some may become severe through Friday afternoon and evening. Rain and thunderstorms will arrive in parts of the mid-Atlantic by Friday evening and much of the Northeast will deal with rain and potential flooding by Friday night.\n\nHere’s what a few cities in the path of the storm can expect:\n\nChicago: A mix of rain and snow Friday afternoon will gradually turn fully back over to snow Friday evening. Winds will remain gusty throughout the day, with gusts of 40 to 60 mph likely once again Friday night. Snow continues through Saturday as much colder conditions arrive.\n\nAtlanta: Thunderstorms will continue to develop and move across the city Friday afternoon. Some may become severe, with the potential for damaging wind gusts, hail and even a tornado. A Level 2 out of 5 risk for severe thunderstorms is in place Friday with the potential for damaging wind gusts, hail and even a tornado. Storms will exit the area Friday evening, but breezy conditions will linger through Saturday.\n\nWashington, DC: Rain and a few thunderstorms will arrive Friday evening and 1 to 2 inches of rain may drench some areas caught under heavy downpours. Winds will be quite strong with gusts of 30 to 50 mph possible. The combination of wind and rain may lead to power outages. Rain will taper off by early Saturday morning, but strong winds will persist.\n\nNew York City: Rain, heavy at times, and strong wind gusts of 40 to 60 mph will arrive Friday night. Rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches are likely across the city, with higher amounts possible just north. Rain will taper off Saturday morning, but gusty winds will persist through the weekend.\n\nWidespread wind gusts of 40 to 60 mph are likely across much of the Midwest and portions of the East as a powerful storm reaches its full strength Friday evening. Other portions of the central US will also get quite breezy Friday, with gusts of 30 to 40 mph possible.\n\nMore than 150 million people across the US are under wind alerts as roaring winds crank up in intensity. Multiple locations in northern Illinois — including the Chicago metro area — reported wind gusts exceeding 50 mph Friday morning.\n\nPower outages also started to increase Friday morning, with Illinois and Wisconsin accounting for more than 100,000 outages.\n\nWhat’s driving the winds: Severe storms aren’t driving these strong, prolonged winds — it’s the impressive strength of the storm, which is an area of low pressure, and how it interacts with a strong area of high pressure located off the northeastern coast of the US.\n\nThe atmosphere is exerting pressure on all of us. The force of that pressure is lower under areas of low pressure and higher under areas of high pressure, hence the names.\n\nAs the storm gets stronger, its pressure drops and it creates a stronger gap in pressure between it and the high pressure, known as a pressure gradient.\n\nThe speed of the wind is related directly to the strength of the pressure gradient, because it squeezes the air that moves through it, forcing it to pick up speed. Think of it like popping bubble wrap: Once it’s squeezed hard enough, the plastic pops and the air quickly rushes out.\n\nThe strength, duration and widespread nature of winds Friday in this pressure gradient are likely to bring down trees and cause additional power outages.\n\nThe number of flight delays and cancellations is ticking up as the Midwest and South are experiencing messy conditions due to the storm.\n\nAccording to the flight-tracking website FlightAware.com, there have been over 2,400 delays and 1,850 cancellations in the US today so far.\n\nIt’s the highest number since July 2023, according to the data from FlightAware.\n\nChicago-area airports are leading that list, with O’Hare International Airport canceling almost 40% of its flights out and 36% of its inbound flights, and Chicago Midway International Airport canceling about 60% of both outbound and inbound flights.\n\nOther affected airports include Denver International and Milwaukee Mitchell International.\n\nMax factor: Cancellations due to the grounding of the 737 Max 9 planes are also contributing to the totals. More than 200 United and Alaska Airlines flights have been canceled each day this week due to the Federal Aviation Administration-mandated grounding. The FAA and Boeing are still trying to settle on an inspection protocol that would allow those planes to resume flying.\n\nMost of the cancellations, however, are due to the winter storm. FlightAware shows Southwest, which doesn’t fly the 737 Max 9, canceling nearly 400 flights — the most of any airline.\n\nCNN’s Ross Levitt and Pete Muntean contributed reporting to this post.\n\nSatellite imagery captured at least two flashes of lightning occurring over the Chicago area on Friday morning. What’s strange is, the city was experiencing heavy snow and not rain at the time.\n\nInstead of a typical thunderstorm, what unfolded Friday morning was something called thundersnow.\n\nThundersnow is exactly what the name suggests – a snowy thunderstorm. It’s a rare phenomenon that occurs in incredibly strong winter storms and sometimes during intense lake-effect snow.\n\nTypical thunderstorms are fueled by atmospheric instability, which develops from moisture and heat in the atmosphere. As such, lightning is much more common during warmer parts of the year or in warmer locations.\n\nBut lightning isn’t impossible during cold months since very powerful storms like Friday’s can generate plenty of atmospheric instability. A snowstorm can tap into this instability and produce lightning, which is exactly what happened over Chicago.\n\nA snowstorm can tap into this instability and produce lightning, which is exactly what happened over Chicago.\n\nThe rumbles of thunder during thundersnow are often muffled by heavy snow. Despite this, lightning strikes during thundersnow are just as dangerous as a typical thunderstorm.\n\nWater levels on Maine’s coast are forecast to hit historic highs on Saturday, threatening to inflict more damage on coastal communities still reeling after a storm earlier this week sent water surging onshore.\n\nWater levels at gauges from Portland to Eastport were forecast to top levels from Wednesday during the last storm, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Portland and Bar Harbor both hit new historic high-water marks on Wednesday.\n\nThe water level reached 15.49 feet in Bar Harbor Wednesday morning and is forecast to top 17 feet by noon Saturday. The previous record in Bar Harbor was 15.04 feet in 2018.\n\nThe water is projected to top 14 feet in Portland Saturday morning, slightly higher than the 13.84 feet hit on Wednesday morning, which broke the previous record set in 1978, NOAA said.\n\nMaine’s governor issued a State of Civil Emergency Thursday for all eight of the state’s coastal counties after the storm surge caused destruction there.\n\nThe exceptionally high water is being driven by strong winds blowing water from the Atlantic Ocean toward the shore on top of high tide. Heavy rain inland only exacerbates the flooding.\n\nClimate change is also playing a role. Sea levels are rising as global temperatures climb and melt glaciers and ice sheets. Higher sea levels are making coastal flooding events worse and will continue to do so in the future.\n\nHere’s a look at the snowfall and other conditions expected in some of the Midwestern cities in the storm’s path. All times are local to the cities indicated.\n\nChicago\n\nAlert: Winter storm warning from early Friday to noon Saturday\n\nSnowfall: More than 8 inches; rates could exceed an inch per hour\n\nPeak snowfall: Friday morning and Saturday morning (commutes could be impacted)\n\nWinds: Gusts up to 45 mph, peaking Friday morning through Saturday\n\nWintry mix: Snow will mix with rain near Lake Michigan, limiting snow accumulations after mid-morning Friday\n\nDes Moines\n\nAlerts: Winter storm warning until 10 a.m. Friday; blizzard warning from 11 a.m. Friday to 7 a.m. Saturday; wind chill watch from Saturday evening through Tuesday morning\n\nSnowfall: Peak snowfall until 7 a.m. Friday, with snow accumulations between 6 to 11 inches before the blizzard warning; during blizzard warning, life-threatening conditions expected\n\nWinds: Gusts up to 45 mph from Friday through the day Saturday\n\nWind chill could reach 30 to 45 degrees below zero, threatening frostbite on skin exposed as little as 10 minutes\n\nGrand Rapids\n\nAlert: Winter storm warning from 10 a.m. Friday to 7 p.m. Saturday\n\nSnowfall: 8 to 14 inches expected, with peak snowfall between 1 to 6 p.m. Friday\n\nWinds: Gusts up to 50 mph\n\nMilwaukee\n\nAlert: Winter storm warning from 6 a.m. Friday to noon Saturday\n\nSnowfall: Accumulations of 3 to 7 inches along the lakeshore and 6 to 11 inches farther inland; peak snowfall rates from 6 a.m. to noon Friday\n\nWinds: Gusts up to 45 mph, peaking Friday morning through Saturday\n\nMinneapolis\n\nAlert: Winter weather advisory from Friday morning to Saturday morning\n\nSnowfall: Accumulations of 4 to 7 inches, with rates peaking noon to 10 p.m. Friday\n\nWinds: Gusts up to 35 mph, peaking Friday afternoon through Saturday\n\nA powerful storm is set to unleash blizzard conditions, severe thunderstorms, damaging winds and brutal cold across the eastern half of the US in what will be a dangerous dose of déjà vu for many.\n\nWhen staying indoors during cold temperatures or a winter storm, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers these tips:\n\nMake sure any infants younger than 1 year old are not sleeping in cold rooms and have adequate warm clothing, such as footed pajamas, one-piece wearable blankets or sleep sacks. Remove any pillows or other soft bedding from a baby’s crib, since they pose the risk of smothering or sudden infant death syndrome.\n\nIf you have friends or neighbors older than 65, check on them frequently to ensure that their homes are adequately heated.\n\nLeave water taps slightly open to prevent freezing pipes.\n\nEat well-balanced meals to stay warm.\n\nAvoid alcohol and caffeine, because they can cause your body to lose heat more rapidly.\n\nAnd if you must go outside, the CDC and National Weather Service have some recommendations for staying safe while venturing outdoors during a winter storm,\n\nDress warmly with hats, scarves and mittens and by wearing layers.\n\nAvoid walking on ice and avoid getting wet.\n\nIf you have to shovel snow or do other outdoor work, take your time and work slowly. If you have older neighbors, offer to help shovel their walkways or driveways.\n\nAvoid traveling on ice-covered roads if possible.\n\nIf you are stranded outdoors, it is safest to stay in your vehicle.\n\nTry to keep pets indoors during cold weather, but if they go outside, thoroughly wipe their legs and underbelly free of snow when returning indoors. Never let your dog off leash on snow or ice.\n\nRead more about how to stay safe during winter weather.\n\nSevere thunderstorms that may produce dangerous tornadoes will threaten parts of the South overnight and into the daylight hours Friday morning.\n\nNighttime tornadoes are twice as likely to be deadly as those that occur during the day, a 2022 study found.\n\nResearchers found that nighttime tornadoes from 1950 to 2019 made up less than a third of tornadoes, but were responsible for a staggering 42% of tornado deaths.\n\nTornado fatalities during the daytime hours have decreased by 20% since the late 1800s because of advances in science and communication, the study found. But the amount of nighttime tornado fatalities actually increased by 20% during the same period.\n\nThe increase could be due to factors like location and home construction, but the researchers said the most obvious issue is a large portion of the population is asleep at night and may miss life-saving warnings.\n\nIt’s difficult to spot a tornado at night, even for those who are awake or are awoken by warnings.\n\nThe best way to stay safe during a nocturnal tornado threat is to have multiple ways to receive severe weather warnings. At the very least, make sure emergency alerts are enabled on your smartphone. Charge devices ahead of time and set phones or alarms on a loud volume so you’re not caught unaware.\n\nSignificant snow is on the way for the greater Chicago area, but totals will vary wildly from an inch or two to closer to double-digits depending on where you are.\n\n“We are expecting a tight gradient in snow across a few miles inland from Lake Michigan,” Brett Borchardt, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Chicago, told CNN.\n\nMeaning parts of Chicago close to the lakeshore are likely going to end up with significantly lower snowfall totals than those in the western suburbs Friday through Saturday.\n\nThis difference is tied back to the warmth of Lake Michigan, according to Borchardt.\n\nWater temperatures on the surface of Lake Michigan are currently higher than they’ve been since records began in 1995, according to data from NOAA. Because of this warmth, the total percentage of the lake covered in ice is hovering near-zero. At this point in January, at least 10% to 20% of Lake Michigan should be covered in ice.\n\nWith warm waters and almost no ice, air temperatures near the lakeshore become warmer than typical. When air temperatures hover at or just above freezing, snow is unable to accumulate easily, lowering totals.\n\nSnow will accumulate more readily in areas farther from Lake Michigan where air temperatures are able to drop below freezing.\n\n“It’s best to prepare for difficult travel conditions regardless of how much snow falls, especially Friday night as winds pick up and lead to areas of blowing snow including in Chicago,” Borchardt cautioned.\n\nWhile the northern side of the storm will deliver snowy and windy conditions, severe thunderstorms are possible Friday on the southern side – including for a significant portion of the South and portions of the mid-Atlantic.\n\nEarly Friday, before sunrise: Parts of Arkansas, eastern Texas and northwestern Louisiana, including Shreveport, have an enhanced risk of severe storms, or a Level 3 of 5, according to the Storm Prediction Center.\n\nA slight risk for severe storms, or Level 2 of 5, exists early Friday for a wider area, from eastern Texas to western Mississippi. The main threats there are tornadoes, strong gusts and large hail.\n\nFriday, during the day: An enhanced risk of severe storms, or a Level 3 of 5, exists for a large portion of northern Mississippi and part of western Alabama, according to the Storm Prediction Center. A slight risk for severe storms, of Level 2 of 5, exists for a wider portion of the Southeast from the rest of Mississippi to much of the Carolinas, including the areas of Birmingham, Alabama; Memphis, Tennessee; and Charlotte and Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\nSnow will once again bury portions of the Midwest as a powerful storm tracks through the region Friday and Saturday.\n\nThe combination of heavy snow and strong winds could make travel dangerous and even impossible in some areas, especially late Friday through Friday night.\n\nWhiteout conditions are possible from Iowa to Michigan, and people may even find themselves stuck in a blizzard.\n\nSnowstorms are not considered blizzards until they meet certain criteria.\n\nBlizzards occur when snow and sustained winds of 35 mph or greater combine for at least three hours and reduce visibility to a quarter-mile or less, according to the National Weather Service. More simply: strong winds blow so much snow around that it’s impossible to see a distance farther than a few football fields for a long period of time.\n\nVisibility can plummet to near-zero, meaning it’s impossible to see farther than a few feet, in the most intense blizzards.\n\nBut remember: A storm doesn’t need to meet the technical definition of a blizzard in order to cause life-threatening conditions.\n\nStorms with similar wind speeds and snow amounts that happen on short timescales are also very dangerous. Whiteout conditions for any length of time may lead to serious accidents and deadly crashes."
