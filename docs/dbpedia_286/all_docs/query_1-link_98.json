        "text": "This course introduces students to regions of the world in historical and geographical context. We focus both on geographical locations and patterns, which we will learn to describe, and also on processes by which regions come to be, which we will learn to explain. We also learn concepts that are useful for describing and explaining regional differences. The course stands alone, but it can also serve as preparation for upper division courses. I am happy to discuss relevant courses or programs of study with interested students. This course is taught in person, unless the societal or institutional conditions require us to change modality. Any such change will be duly communicated. To be a successful student, you must regularly attend our class meetings and actively engage with course material (lectures, readings, videos, handouts, and assignments). See more details below, under “Habits of Successful Students.” This course begins with an activity that prompts us to account for our preconceptions about world regions, as well as an example of how regions are made. In subsequent weeks, we focus on processes through which regions take shape, and we substantiate our understanding of these processes with examples of regions and their histories. Emphases of this course include regional and national identity formation, state formation, migration, environmental change, and trade and the production of value through economic circuits. We cannot discuss all regions in one semester, but the course provides tools with which students can develop an understanding of regions we do not have time to examine in the course.\n\nGeography and Geographers provides a survey of the major debates, key thinkers and schools of thought in human geography in the English-speaking world, setting them within the context of economic, social, cultural and political, as well as intellectual, changes. It focuses on the debates among geographers regarding what their discipline should study and how that should be done, and draws on a wide reading of the geographical literature produced during a seventy-year period characterised by both growth in the number of academic geographers and substantial shifts in conceptions of the discipline’s scientific rationale. The pace and volume of change within the discipline show little sign of diminishing; this seventh edition covers new literature and important developments over the past decade. An insightful and reflective examination of the field from within, Geography and Geographers continues to be the most comprehensive and up-to-date single volume overview of the field of human geography. This seventh edition has also been extensively revised and updated to reflect developments in the ways that geography and its history are understood and taught. Providing a thoroughly contemporary perspective, the book maintains its standing as the essential resource for students and researchers across the field.\n\nDuring the past two years many books have been published in English on geographical education. Some of these are directly on geography and its curriculum, teaching, learning, resources and policy matters, aimed at teachers, teacher educators and researchers. Other publications which inform the wider frame of geography education include books on environmental education, education for sustainability, social studies education, outdoor education, cartography education, textbooks, the geography of education, and children’s geographies. You may know of English language books either about or likely to be of interest to geography educators that I have missed. If you do, please let me know about them. You can contact me via my email address: sjcatling@brookes.ac.uk . It helps to let me have the full reference for a book: author(s)/editor(s) , year of publication , title , place of publication and publisher . I will be most grateful to hear from you. RIGEO publishes book reviews but has not y...\n\nPrisoners of Geography stands out as a prominent journalistic-style book demonstrating and convincing us that geography not only shapes our political history, but also provides clues to why we live our lives the way we do. As one critique highlights, Marshall does not refrain from asking thorny questions and seeking sharp answers to those questions. His approach, with no doubt, is prone to provoke the decades-old debate emphasising geographical determinism and colonial discourse. But nevertheless Marshall’s contentious book on 10 maps that explain how and why world leaders make certain choices and how and why they become prisoners of their geography as they make these choices should be considered as a concise and a useful entrée for students of geopolitics."
