Mex. U.S.G.S. map;\n\n(10) It proceeds south on I-25 for approx. 8.6 miles until it intersects with NM-556 at the east bound interchange at Sec. 1, T11N, R3E on the Alameda, N. Mex. U.S.G.S. map;\n\n(11) The boundary goes east approx. 5 miles on NM-556 until it intersects the 106°30′ longitude meridian, T11N, R4E;\n\n(12) Then it goes south on the 106°30′ longitude meridian for approx. 4.5 miles until it arrives at Montgomery Blvd. at Sec. 34, T10/11N, R4E;\n\n(13) The boundary travels west on Montgomery Blvd. for approx. 6.1 miles until it meets the south exit ramp of 1-25 in Sec. 34, T11N, R3E;\n\n(14) Then it travels south on I-25 for approx. 13.3 miles (through Albuquerque, NM) until it intersects with NM-47 at Sec. 6, T8N, R3E on the Isleta, N. Mex. U.S.G.S. map;\n\n(15) It heads south on NM-47 for approx. 3.2 miles until it converges with the 4,900 foot elevation contour line at Isleta Pueblo, NM, in Sec. 24, T8N, R2E;\n\n(16) The boundary follows the 4,900 foot elevation contour line south for approx. 25 miles until it arrives at a point north on Madron, NM, at the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad (AT&SF RR) tracks, approx. 250 feet east of elevation mark 4,889 feet on the Turn, N.
