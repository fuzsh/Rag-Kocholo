It is used extensively in the manufacture of artificial fibers and explosives, as a chemical intermediate in pharmaceuticals, and as a solvent for vinyl and acrylic resins, lacquers, paints, inks, cosmetics (such as nail polish remover), and varnishes. It is used in the preparation of paper coatings, adhesives, and is also employed as a starting material in the synthesis of many compounds.\n\nAcetyl\n\nAny chemical compound with an acetate group.\n\nACGIH\n\nAmerican Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists. This organization includes professionals in government and education involved in occupational safety and health programs. One important function of this group is the determination and publication of recommended occupational exposure limits for chemical substances.\n\nAcid\n\nAny substance that in water solution tastes sour, changes the color of certain indicators, promotes certain chemical reactions, etc.. Examples of acids include inorganic substances such as sulfuric, nitric, and phosphoric acids, and organic compounds such as citric or maleic acid.\n\nAcid Oil\n\nAcid oil is a general term for a by-product obtained from the alkali refining of oils and fats. During alkali refining the free fatty acids are neutralised with alkali and this soapstock containing some emulsified neutral oil is separated. Acidification of the soapstock gives acid oil. Main components of acids oils are fatty acids, neutral oil and moisture. Acid oil requires further refining/purification before it is suitable for use in laundry soaps and washing powders.\n\nAcid Pre-Treatment\n\nThe crude oil or fat is pre-treated with phosphoric acid or citric acid to remove impurities such as gums, mucilaginous materials and phosphatides present. Also referred to as \"degumming\", it is essential since it removes impurities which would otherwise give a highly coloured product.\n\nAcid Value\n\nThis is defined as the number of milligrams of potassium hydroxide required to neutralise the free fatty acids in one gram of fat. Since acid value is an indication of the extent of hydrolysis and deterioration, oils with low acid value are sought after.\n\nAcidity\n\nFree fatty acids have, as the name implies, a weak acidic nature. There will be a naturally occurring level of these present in each oil and levels can be further increased by hydrolysis (water breakdown) of triglyceride. The level of acidity may be expressed in several ways (please refer to Acid Value and Free Fatty Acids).\n\nAcidulate soapstock (Acid Oil)\n\nSoapstock, which contains mainly soaps and entrained neutral oil, is treated with sulphuric acid and heated to decompose the soaps. This produces a layer of oil of high free fatty acid content (acid oil) and an aqueous phase which is separated and treated prior to discharge as an effluent. The acid oils can be used in animal feeds as they possess high calorific values.\n\nACOT\n\nAdvisory Committee of Offshore Technology\n\nACP\n\nAfrican, Caribbean, Pacific countries\n\nAcquiescence\n\nWhen a bill of lading is accepted or signed by a shipper or shipperâs agent without protest, the shipper is said to acquiesce to the terms, giving a silent form of consent.\n\nAcquittance\n\nA written receipt in full, in discharge from all claims.\n\nAcrylate elastomer\n\nIn latex paints, textile applications (backcoating), emulsion polymers for paper coating; as pulp additives, in floor polishes & sealants (resinous & polymeric coatings), in adhesives.\n\nAcrylic acid\n\nAcrylic acid and the basic alkyl esters (methyl, ethyl, butyl and 2-ethylhexyl esters) are important monomers used for the manufacture of polymer dispersions, adhesives, flocculants, detergents, varnishes, fibers and plastics as well as chemical intermediates.\n\nAcrylic esters\n\nWhen polymerized, acrylic esters, esters derived from acrylic acid, are the film-forming components of acrylic paints, coatings, textiles, adhesives, plastics and other applications.\n\nAcrylic fibers\n\nAcrylic fibers are artificial, thermoplastic fibers made from acrylonitrile. Fabrics produced from acrylic fibers wash and dry easily\n\nAcrylonitrile\n\nAcrylonitrile is a chemical intermediate used in acrylic fibers, ABS (acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene), SAN (styrene-acrylonitrile) and NBR (nitrile-butadiene-rubber).\n\nACS\n\nAmerican Chemical Society or Arab Classification Society\n\nACS or ACE\n\nU.S. Customsâ master computer system, âAutomated Commercial Systems.â Now being replaced by the Automated Commercial Environment system.\n\nAct of God\n\nAn act beyond human control, such as lightning, flood or earthquake.\n\nActivation\n\nChanging the condition of steel from passive to active\n\nActivation Potential\n\nThe electrode potential at which a steel is changed from passive to active condition\n\nActive State\n\nstate of a corroding metal surface which is below the passivation potential and associated with uniform corrosion\n\nActivity\n\nThe level of catalyst's ability to do its work. The scale descends from fresh (full capacity right from the box or rejuvenator) to spent (coated, poisoned, or other wise neutralized.)\n\nActual condition\n\nShip Stability: A condition of the vessel that is observed.\n\nActual specifications\n\nThe quality reports on a specific parcel of fuel or feedstock. Such specifications do not constitute guarantees on the oil unless the seller says so. But they give a good description of the product available aboard a vessel or in a storage tank.\n\nAcute\n\nA short term period of action measured in seconds, minutes, hours, or days\n\nAcute (aquatic) toxicity\n\nAdverse effects that occur rapidly as a result of a short-term exposure to a chemical or physical agent. In fish or other aquatic organisms, effects that occur within a few hours, days or weeks are considered acute. Generally, acute effects are severe, the most common one measured in aquatic organisms being mortality. A chemical is considered acutely toxic if by its direct action it kills 50% or more of the exposed population of test organisms in a relatively short period of time, such as 24-96h to 14d.\n\nAcute Effects of Overexposure\n\nRefers to the adverse effects that normally are evident immediately or shortly after exposure to a hazardous material without implying a degree of severity\n\nAcute toxicity\n\nAdverse effects produced by single exposure to substance\n\nAD\n\nAfter date\n\nAdcom\n\nAdress commision\n\nAd val.\n\nAd Valorem (duty)\n\nAd Valorem\n\nA term from Latin meaning, âaccording to value.â Import duty applied as a percentage of the cargoâs dutiable value.\n\nAd valorum\n\nMeans âat Valueâ a rate of freight based on the value of the goods.\n\nAD.VAL.\n\nAccording to value (ad valorem)\n\nAD VAL FRT\n\nAd Valorem Freight. Freight calculated on the value of the goods, expressed as a percentage thereof.\n\nADA\n\nAll Details About\n\nADCOM\n\nAddress Commission. Commission payable by the shipowner to the charterer. The reason for this system is sometimes said to be that the chartererâs shipping department for bookkeeping purposes must show some kind of income from their activities. State trading countries regularly include a 5% address commission in their orders.\n\nADCOM or ADDCOMM\n\nAddress Commission. Commission payable by the shipowner to the charterer. The reason for this system is sometimes said to be that the chartererâs shipping department for bookkeeping purposes must show some kind of income from their activities. State trading countries regularly include a 5% address commission in their orders."
