He inherited the genetic disorder haemophilia from his maternal line. He and his youngest brother Gonzalo were kept in specially-tailored jackets to prevent injury from accidents.\n\nAlfonso's father faced increasing political problems that led Spain to become a Republic in 1931 when the monarch was deposed. The family moved into exile.\n\nHe renounced his rights to the then-defunct throne to marry a commoner, Edelmira Ignacia Adriana Sampedro-Robato, in Ouchy on 21 June 1933, after which Alfonso took the courtesy title Count of Covadonga. The couple divorced on 8 May 1937.\n\nAlfonso married Marta Esther Rocafort-Altuzarra in Havana on 3 July 1937. They divorced on 8 January 1938. He had no children by either of his wives. However, Alfonso de Bourbon, a resident of California, later claimed to be an illegitimate son of Alfonso.\n\nA car accident led to Alfonso's early death on 6 September 1938, at the age of 31. He crashed into a telephone booth and appeared to have minor injuries but his haemophilia led to fatal internal bleeding.\n\nLink to Wikipedia biography\n\nRelationships\n\nchild->parent relationship with Alfonso XIII, King of Spain (born 17 May 1886)\n\nchild->parent relationship with Victoria Ena, Queen Consort of Spain (born 24 October 1887)\n\nsibling relationship with Beatriz de Borbón (born 22 June 1909)\n\nsibling relationship with Gonzalo, Infante of Spain (born 24 October 1914)\n\nsibling relationship with Jaime, Infante of Spain (born 23 June 1908)\n\nsibling relationship with Juan de Borbon, Prince (born 20 June 1913)\n\nsibling relationship with María Cristina, Infanta of Spain (1911) (born 12 December 1911)\n\nEvents\n\nRelationship : Marriage 21 June 1933\n\nchart Placidus Equal_H.\n\nRelationship : Marriage 3 July 1937\n\nchart Placidus Equal_H.\n\nOther Death 6 September 1938 (Internal bleeding)\n\nchart Placidus Equal_H.\n\nSource Notes\n\nSy Scholfield quotes \"HEIR TO SPAIN'S THRONE IS BORN: Thundering Cannon[s] Announce Birth of a New Prince of the Asturias,\" New York Times, 11 May 1907, p. 4: \"The Minister of Justice, Marquis Figueros, then made out the birth certificate . . .

I found the article in the New York Times quoted in Source Notes (http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9F04E3DD133EE033A25752C1A9639C 946697D6CF ) and I would transcribe complete until the part where the birth time is mentioned:\n\nNew York Times, 11 May 1907, p. 4:\n\nHEIR TO SPAIN'S THRONE IS BORN\n\n______________\n\nThundering Cannon Announce Birth of a New Prince of the Asturias.\n\n______________\n\nKING PARDONS THOUSANDS\n\n______________\n\nImpressive Presentation Ceremonies in the Palace - Baptism Set for Tuesday.\n\n______________\n\nMADRID, May 10.- The news that the direct male succesion to the throne of Spain had been assured by the birth today of a son to Queen Victoria sent a thrill of rejoicing throughout the country, and tonight the happy event is being celebrated from one end of the land to the other. Queen Victoria and the child are both doing well. The baby Prince weighs 8 3/4 pounds.\n\nThe hurried departure of royal messengers from the palace at 10 o'clock this morning to summon the courtiers and the mebers of the Diplomatic Corps gave the first indication that the happy event was imminent. The usual gathering outside the palace courtyard was soon swelled by immense throngs of the excited populace who watched the continual stream of brilliantly uniformed personages driving up to the royal residence, and tried to identify the individuals.\n\nThe crowd waited in hushed suspense until nearly 1 o'clock, whe the thundering of the first cannon signified that the royal accouchement was over. The reports were counted anxiously until the fifteenth, and the a complete silence ensued. The seconds appeared as hours until the sixteenth shot boomed forth, and the continuation until twenty-one had been fired informed the public that the royal child was a son. The sixteenth report brought forth ringing cheer that rent the air, and at the same time the royal standard was hoisted over the palace and it was known that no mistake had been made. The people danced with joy and embraced each other, shouting: \"Long live the King! Long live the Queen!\"\n\nNews Carried Far and Wide.\n\nThey then rushed from spot carrying the news to the furthermost points of the city. Soon after the royal salute the flags of Spain and Great Britain were raised over all the public buildings of Madrid. Many business houses closed for the remainder of the day, as a sign of rejoicing.\n\nIn the meanwhile, the solemn ceremony of presentation was being carried out inside palace. The Mistress of the Robes, carrying a huge silver tray, upon which was lying the newly born baby, accopanied by King Alfonso and Premier Maura, appeared in the antechamber were the coutiers had assembled. The young monarch appeared full of joy as the Premier, raising the drapery which covered the infant on the silver tray, said: \"Gentlemen, it is a Prince.\"\n\nThe solemn dignitaries thereupon forgot all etiquette and cheered both the King and the Queen heartily. The Minister of Justice, Marquis Figueroa, then made out the birth certificate, which was signed by all the prominent personages present. Then the gathering broke up. The Prince was born at 12:45 o'clock.\n\nAs you can see nothing indicates that the guns have been fired at 1 a.m. Rather, it indicates that at 10 a.m., when the messengers are sent to summon the court, the queen had not given birth yet.\n\nHaving established that was born after noon (not after midnight) is the matter of choosing between the time given by the birth certificate (12:30 p.m.), New York Times (12:45 p.m.), L'Echo de Paris (12:35 p.m.), or Heraldo de Zamora (12:25 p.m.)\n\nCategories\n\nDiagnoses : Major Diseases : Other Major diseases (Haemophilia)"
