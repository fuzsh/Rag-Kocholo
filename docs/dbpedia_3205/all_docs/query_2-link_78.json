The image, created by the renowned Spanish artist J. Donon in 1865, captures the young prince in his childhood, adorned with the prestigious decoration that bore the name of his mother, Queen Isabella II. The Prince of Asturias, born in 1857, was the eldest son of King Alfonso XII and Queen Maria Christina of Austria. At the time this print was made, he had not yet ascended to the throne, but was already the heir apparent. The Cross of Maria Isabel Luisa, established in 1831, was one of the most significant distinctions in the Spanish Order of Chivalry, and was awarded to those who had rendered exceptional services to the crown. In the print, the young prince is shown wearing the distinctive red and blue sash of the order, with the cross prominently displayed on his chest. He is also wearing a military cap and a uniform, reflecting his role as a future monarch and military leader. The intricate details of the insignia, the rich colors, and the elegant composition of the print make it a fascinating glimpse into the history of the Spanish monarchy during the 19th century. This print is an excellent example of the contemporary artistic style of the time, and serves as a reminder of the significance of the Spanish Orders of Chivalry and Decorations in the history of Europe. It is a testament to the rich heritage of the Spanish monarchy and the importance of the distinctions that were bestowed upon its members.\n\nRate this comment thumb_up thumb_down\n\nMADE IN AUSTRALIA\n\nSafe Shipping with 30 Day Money Back Guarantee\n\nFREE PERSONALISATION*\n\nWe are proud to offer a range of customisation features including Personalised Captions, Color Filters and Picture Zoom Tools\n\nSECURE PAYMENTS\n\nWe happily accept a wide range of payment options so you can pay for the things you need in the way that is most convenient for you\n\n* Options may vary by product and licensing agreement.
