        "text": "Before Isabella and Ferdinand became co-monarchs of Castile and Aragon, Isabella wasn't the initial heir-presumptive. That was her younger brother, Alfonso, Prince of Asturias. He was the figurehead of a noble rebellion against King Henry IV who wished to name his daughter, Joanna, as heir-presumptive. But there were rumors that Henry was impotent and that he wasn't Joanna's father (We don't know and never will if the last one is true). Before Alfonso's death in 1468 from either illness, poisoning or throat-slitting (take your pick), Henry arranged for him to marry Joanna.\n\nTo cut to the chase, what if Alfonso had survived to become ATL Alfonso XII of Castile? First, obviously, is that the Iberian peninsula would remain divided between Castile, Aragon and Portugal, but Isabella and Ferdinand II of Aragon weren't married yet, nor were Mary of Burgundy and Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I (the ancestors of the the future Hapsburg monarchy).\n\nI'll admit we don't know much about Alfonso compared to his siblings, but I'd imagine he'd have had a similar upbringing to Isabella and might share some traits with her. As for marriages, there is his proposed marriage to his half-niece, Joanna, but the whole basis of Alfonso and Isabella being named as heir presumptive to Henry IV was based on the rumor that Joanna was a bastard. If they married, it would probably be an acknowledgement that she was Henry IV's daughter, and, therefore, that Alfonso was a usurper and unworthy to be king.\n\nSo far, I see five major candidates:\n\n* Joanna, daughter of Henry IV of Castile. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanna_la_Beltraneja)\n\n* Mary of Burgundy. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_of_Burgundy)\n\n* Anne of France, eldest daughter of Louis XI of France. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_of_France)\n\n* Anne of Savoy, eldest daughter of Amadeus IX of Savoy. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_of_Savoy)\n\n* Joanna of Aragon, sister of Ferdinand II.

You seem to have an alt-Bosworth happening (since you have the Tudors climb onto the throne), which means that none of Elizabeth of York's sisters are going to marry outside of England. Not only would Henry VII be loathe to supply a dowry for them, but he would be terrified of a foreign king/'s heirs challenging his/heirs right to the throne.\n\nSomething I've only come across recently, so IDK if it's true or not, is that Bridget was promised to the church because she was retarded/slow/mentally deficient. But it wouldn't be unlikely that if Edward IV lives, or Richard never usurps the throne, that one Yorkist princess (presumably Anne/Katherine) would end up married to the son of Fernando and Isabel. while another (whichever didn't marry into Aragon) would marry the heir to the Castilian throne. But as one observer notes: \"Edward IV seemed to have the goal of marrying his daughters to the highest born princes and having to pay little to no dowry for them save their looks.\"\n\n1) @Kynan: the heir to the throne of Aragon was entitled Prince de Girona, not de los Asturias\n\n2) Also, IDK if Sancho is gonna marry Bridget of York.

Bu I concede thatit is unlikely. I think shall change this.\n\n3) Interesting. I'd heard she was sickly or simply small as a child, but never deformed or had mental issues. And it is hard to tell with her, as she was SO young at her father's death. And yes, Edward IV did have an issue with dowries. There's a reason Elizabeth of York was 17 and had no plans of marriage in an era when it wasn't uncommon for woman to be married and with their first (maybe second) child by then.\n\nJohn II of Castile (b.1405: d.1454) m.

So, on a quid pro quo basis, Aragon might agree to float the capital for a joint New World venture, if Castile backs her in her Mediterranean schemes. Now obviously both sides might honor their agreement, or they might not. Fernando after all, is the one who said \"the king of France says I have deceived him once. The fool, does he not realize I have fooled him a dozen times and more\". So he might offer the capital in exchange for the troops from Castile for his little Mediterranean ideas, and then once he gets what he wants, simply thumb his nose at Alfonso when that person insists on the payment. This could lead to bad blood between them that they might/might not try to paper over by a match between their kids (not unlikely, since Juan (son of Fernando and Isabel) was offered for his cousin, La Beltraneja)). The thing is, though, without a joint crown, Fernando and Isabel's kids catch the short end of the straw. They are nowhere near as prestigious candidates in Europe (in Italy maybe) as they were OTL.\n\nFernando King of Aragon\n\nNow obviously both sides might honor their agreement, or they might not.

They are nowhere near as prestigious candidates in Europe (in Italy maybe) as they were OTL.\n\nThe King of Aragon could become quite Machiavellian but he wasn't different from their counterparts in other nations, he was 'only the best'.\n\nHowever he was motivated exclusively by reasons of state and was not,\n\nAs might be inferred from his description one Mythomaniac nor does he acted in a reckless manner.\n\nFurther that in OTL, he had military and naval support of Castile, in case of a confrontation with France.\n\nThe case of your example of having to negotiate with Castilla, Fernando would have in mind that he needed its support and the fact that the Kingdom of Aragon shared a long border with a Kingdom that it's bigger and that it is a military power."
