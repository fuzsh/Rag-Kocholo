        "text": "Prologue\n\nIt was past eleven oâclock on the night of 15 April 1969 when Queen Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg (1887-1969) died at her home in Vieille Fontaine, Lausanne in Switzerland. She had been in exile since 1931, when the Second Republic was proclaimed and she and her husband had to leave the country for France. She had only set foot in Spain again a year before her death, in 1968, when she came to Madrid for the christening of her great-grandson, the then Infante Felipe, now King of Spain.\n\nFranco was the head of state at the time, and it is said that, during the christening, the Queen and Franco met alone in a small room of the Zarzuela. âWell, General,â she would say. âNow you have all of them here, the father, the son and the grandson. You can choose.â She was referring, of course, to her son Don Juan de BorbÃ³n, grandson Juan Carlos and great-grandson Felipe. And by the verb âchooseâ she meant âsuccessorâ.\n\nVictoria Eugenie wanted to somehow force Franco to name his successor as king. According to Cayetana de Alba, Victoria Eugenieâs goddaughter, the queen explained to her shortly afterwards that âFranco has assured me that it will be the princeâ. That is, Juan Carlos. And so it was.\n\nEarly years\n\nPrincess Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg was born on 24 October 1887 at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, her grandmotherâs summer residence. Her father was Prince Henry of Battenberg and her mother was Princess Beatrice, the fifth daughter of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. As the youngest daughter of a now widowed and sad queen, she was kept âat homeâ with the court. The British monarch, had indeed allowed Beatrice to marry on condition that she remained her motherâs full-time companion and personal secretary. Therefore, Victoria Eugenie spent her childhood at Windsor Castle, Balmoral and Osborne House on the Isle of Wight.\n\nVictoria Eugenie was named after her grandmother, Queen Victoria, and Empress EugÃ©nie de Montijo, who was her godmother at her christening. At the time, EugÃ©nie de Montijo was already the widow of the French Emperor Napoleon III and had been living in exile in England since 1870. She and Queen Victoria were close friends.\n\nTo her family and the British public Victoria Eugenie was known by the diminutive of her last name, Ena. She was born in the 50th year of Queen Victoriaâs reign, so she was called âthe Jubilee Babyâ.\n\nAlthough she was distant as a mother and somewhat cold to the rest of her grandchildren, Queen Victoria was always close to the little Battenbergs, even amused. The children called her âGanganâ and the monarch allowed them to play inside the palaces, even ignoring their shouts in the corridors, which decades earlier would have horrified her. But now she enjoyed that innocent bustle, so much so that she wrote in her diary âlittle Drino and Ena are delightful and very funnyâ.\n\nAt the age of six, Victoria Eugenie suffered a severe concussion when she was thrown from her pony at Osborne and hit her head on the ground, causing a dangerous haemorrhage that kept her bedridden for several days.\n\nAlthough she granted them certain freedoms, the Queen also demanded that her grandchildren be brought up with good manners and imposed strict discipline. Ena herself recalled years later that her grandmother âwas very kind but very strict, with old fashioned ideas of how children must be brought up; above all she insisted that the little ones should be seen and not heardâ. Furthermore, she ordered her grandchildren to be very aware of their royal position and to behave accordingly. Once, as a child, Ena said: âI think it is time for us to go to bedâ Queen Victoria corrected her. âYoung woman, a princess should say, âI think it is time for me to retireâ.â\n\nAs Prince Henry of Battenberg was the product of a morganatic marriage, he took the name Prince of Battenberg from his mother, who had been created Princess of Battenberg in her own right. Henryâs children would normally have been born with the appellation âSerene Highnessâ; however, on 4 December 1886 Queen Victoria issued a royal warrant granting the higher style of âHighnessâ to all the sons and daughters of Prince Henry and Princess Beatrice.\n\nVictoria Eugenieâs father died when Ena was nine years old, while on active military service after contracting fever in Africa in 1896. After Queen Victoriaâs death in 1901, Princess Beatrice and her family moved from Osborne House and took up residence at Kensington Palace in London.\n\nEngagement and precious gifts\n\nIn 1905, King Alfonso XIII of Spain paid an official state visit to the United Kingdom. Victoria Eugenieâs uncle, King Edward VII, hosted a dinner at Buckingham Palace in honour of the Spanish king. Alfonso was seated between Queen Alexandra and Princess Helena, another sister of King Edward.\n\nEveryone knew that King Alfonso was looking for a suitable bride and one of the strongest candidates was Princess Patricia of Connaught, another niece of King Edward, in whom Alfonso XIII was initially more interested and who was much more suitable than Ena. However, Patricia did not seem interested and so the king turned his attention to Victoria Eugenie. During the ball at the palace, Alfonso XIII asked her if she collected postcards. She replied that she did (all young women of good lineage did it at the time) and he told her that he would send her one every day. And so it was: Ena and Alfonso XIII began an epistolary relationship that lasted several months.\n\nThe Spanish kingâs mother, Queen Maria Christina of Austria, did not like her sonâs choice, partly because she considered the Battenbergs not to be royalty due to the obscure origin of Prince Henryâs mother, and partly because she wanted her son to marry into her family.\n\nThere were other obstacles to their being married: religion (Alfonso was Roman Catholic and Victoria Eugenie was Anglican) and the potential problem of haemophilia, the disease that Queen Victoria had passed on to some of her descendants. Victoria Eugenieâs brother, Leopold, was a haemophiliac; therefore, there was a 50-50 chance that she was a carrier and, if Alfonso had married her, their child could have been affected by the disease. Nevertheless, Alfonso was not deterred and persevered in his attachment to the chosen one.\n\nIn January 1906, Alfonsoâs mother agreed to her sonâs choice and wrote a letter to Victoria Eugenieâs mother, telling her of Alfonsoâs love for her daughter and seeking unofficial contact with the king. A few days later, in Windsor, King Edward congratulated his niece on her future engagement. The young couple moved, together with their respective mothers, to the Miramar Palace in San Sebastian, where the engagement was officially announced and where the bride had to renounce her Anglican faith to embrace Catholicism.\n\nHer fiancÃ© gave her a fabulous tiara as a wedding present. It is the famous Fleur de Lys, the most sumptuous in royal jewellery. Created by the Ansorena jewellers, it comprised 450 diamonds and ten pearls mounted on platinum. The main elements of the tiara, the lilies, are the heraldic symbol of the House of Bourbon, the Spanish ruling dynasty. Victoria Eugenie had it âadjustedâ years later to âmake it even more spectacularâ. In particular, she sent it to Cartier to have more diamonds added to the central part.\n\nAnother precious and âmysteriousâ gift came from her godmother, Empress Eugenie, who gave her goddaughter a fan. Reportedly, Ena expected a grander gift from her illustrious godmother and kept it in a drawer for many years until, soon after the Empressâ death (in 1920), she took it out and removed the fan to discover ten large square-cut emeralds of inestimable value inside! The queen had the emeralds set in a necklace by the Spanish jeweller Sanz, that she also wore as a band for a portrait of Philip de LÃ¡szlÃ³. Later, Empress Eugenieâs emeralds were re-set by Cartier into a two-row diamond parure, together with a brooch and a ring, which were worn by Queen Victoria Eugenie very often, even after her exile from Spain in 1931.\n\nA cursed marriage\n\nOn 31 May 1906, Princess Victoria Eugenie married King Alfonso XIII at the Royal Monastery of San JerÃ³nimo in Madrid.\n\nJulia de Herce ran one of the best fashion ateliers in Madrid and served some of the capitalâs most high-ranking women. For this reason, and for having worked in the past for the Queen Mother, Maria Christina of Austria, she was chosen to make the wedding dress of the English princess. Forty craftsmen were needed to make it in time and lace brought from England was used. The veil she wore had belonged to her mother-in-law and was embroidered with fleur-de-lys and the imperial eagle, the symbol of the Austrian imperial family.\n\nAfter the wedding ceremony, as the procession made its way to the Royal Palace, the anarchist Mateu Morral threw a bomb from a balcony at the royal carriage. The king and queen were unharmed. Victoria Eugenieâs life was saved because, at the exact moment the bomb exploded, she turned her head to see the church of Santa Maria, which Alfonso was showing her. She escaped injury but her dress was stained by the blood of a guard travelling alongside the carriage. In all, 28 people were killed and hundreds were wounded.\n\nDue to the terrorist attack suffered, it was decided to cancel the planned ball but not the dinner with the guests that evening. Incidentally, the wedding of Victoria Eugenie and Alfonso XIII was the first in Spain where a wedding cake was served, an English tradition that had never been seen on Spanish soil.\n\nAfter an inauspicious start to her term as Queen of Spain, Victoria Eugenie isolated herself from the Spanish people and was unpopular in her new land. In addition to her reserved nature, typical of the rigid Victorian court, she had a difficult relationship with the queen mother Maria Christina of Austria, who always maintained her authority over the royal family and her influence over the king. When World War I broke out in 1914, the differences between the two escalated, as the Queen Mother expressed her clear Germanophile feelings, while the Queen Consort showed her support for her cousin, King George V of the United Kingdom.\n\nHer married life seemed to improve when in 1907 she gave birth to a son and designated heir to the kingdom, Alfonso, Prince of Asturias. However, while the little prince was being circumcised, doctors noticed that he did not stop bleeding: the first sign that the little heir was suffering from haemophilia. Victoria Eugenie was the obvious source of the disease. Alfonso would never forgive Victoria Eugenie and would never accept what had happened. The idyll was over.\n\nDuring her tenure, the new Queen of Spain relaxed the customs of the Spanish court, which until then had been accustomed to the strict rules laid down by Queen Mother Maria Christina of Austria. She also introduced changes in the palace: she ordered the central heating system to be improved and installed a cinematograph in the columned hall so that films could be shown in the evening. Her personal tastes also caused a stir: the new queen drank tea, played sports and smoked, which caused a scandal in Spain.\n\nQueen Victoria Eugenie carried out very important welfare work, especially in the field of nursing. She was instrumental in the creation of a professional nursing career and devoted herself body and soul to the education of women.\n\nIn 1923, the Pope conferred the Golden Rose on her, the first time this honour had been awarded to a British princess since 1555, when Pope Julius III conferred it on Queen Mary I of England.\n\nKing Alfonso XIII and Queen Victoria Eugenie had six children: Alfonso, Jaime, Beatriz, Cristina, Juan and Gonzalo. It is known that neither daughter was a carrier of haemophilia. The eldest son and Gonzalo were born with haemophilia while little Jaime suffered from deaf-mutism from an early age due to a badly operated mastoiditis.\n\nAfter the birth of their children, Victoria Eugenieâs relationship with Alfonso deteriorated and he had numerous affairs. Finally, after the First World War, the two were practically separated and, once they left for exile, they chose to live in different countries.\n\nExile and death\n\nVictoria Eugenie always had the unpleasant feeling that the Spanish people did not like her, even though she always tried to do charity work and never got involved in politics. But the monarchy was collapsing (her husband had made many mistakes) and she was one of the first to realise that the Republic was imminent.\n\nThe Spanish royal family went into exile on 14 April 1931 after municipal elections brought Republicans to power in most major cities, leading to the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic. Alfonso XIII hoped that his voluntary exile would prevent a civil war between republicans and royalists. The family went to live in France and then Italy. Victoria Eugenie and Alfonso later separated and she lived partly in the United Kingdom and partly in Switzerland. She bought a castle, la Vieille Fontaine, outside Lausanne. King Alfonso XIII left for Rome.\n\nIn 1938, the whole family gathered in Rome for the christening of Juan Carlos, the first son of Infante Juan, at the Palazzo Malta.\n\nOn 15 January 1941, Alfonso, feeling that his death was near, transferred his rights to the Spanish crown to his son Juan, Count of Barcelona and third son. Why the third son? On 11 June 1933, the eldest son Infante Alfonso had renounced his rights to the Spanish throne for himself and his descendants (because of the unequal marriage he was about to contract). By the way, he died in a car accident in 1938 (in 1934 his youngest brother Infante Gonzalo had also died of injuries suffered in a car accident). The second son Jaime had renounced his rights to the Spanish throne too (due to his physical infirmities) on 21 June 1933.\n\nThe former king Alfonso XIII died on 28 February 1941.\n\nIn 1942, Victoria Eugenie was forced to leave Italy, having become persona non grata for the Italian government, according to Harold Tittmann, US representative in the Vatican at the time, due to her âill-concealed inclinations to the Allied causeâ. She settled permanently in Lausanne, Switzerland.\n\nTo make ends meet, she had to sell a lot of jewellery, not least to help cover part of the costs of her grandson Juan Carlosâs marriage to Sophie. Most notably, Queen Victoria Eugenie is believed to have disposed of Empress Eugenieâs fabulous emerald necklace. The necklace was bought by Cartier at auction and seven of the emeralds were remade into a large necklace that was sold to the Iranian Shah Muhammad Reza Pahlavi and worn by Empress Farah Diba, the third wife of the Shah of Persia.\n\nVictoria Eugenie only returned to Spain in 1968 on the occasion of the christening of her great-grandson, the then newborn Felipe, now King.\n\nEna died in Lausanne on 15 April 1969 at the age of 81, exactly 38 years after leaving Spain for exile. She was the last surviving daughter of Princess Beatrice and Prince Henri of Battenberg.\n\nThe funeral was held in the SacrÃ© Coeur church and she was buried in the nearby Bois-de-Vaux cemetery in Lausanne. On 25 April 1985 her remains were brought back to Spain and re-interred in the Royal Vault of the Escorial, on the outskirts of Madrid, next to the remains of her husband Alfonso XIII and not far from her sons Alfonso, Jaime and Gonzalo.\n\nTV series filming\n\nThe Spanish television company TVE is currently filming a new TV series entitled âEnaâ, about Queen Victoria Eugenie. Filming of the series has just begun at the Magdalena Palace in Santander, the monarchâs favourite place to spend her summers in Spain. The production is based on the novel Ena by Pilar Eyre, and will consist of six chapters, which will narrate the interesting life of Victoria Eugenie, while describing a moment of change not only in Spain but in the world, between 1905 and 1945.\n\nThe filming of Ena, which will take place in natural exteriors and interiors, will last until the end of December, as reported by TVE, although it did not specify when the official television premiere is scheduled. For the shoot, the team will also travel to the Royal Palace, the SantoÃ±a Palace and the FernÃ¡n NÃºÃ±ez Palace in Madrid, as well as La Granja Palace in Segovia. Anglo-Danish actress Kimberley Tell will play Victoria Eugenie and Joan AmargÃ³s will play Alfonso XIII.\n\nFor further reading\n\nAna de Sagrera, Ena and Bee: Queen Victoriaâs Spanish Granddaughters, 2022\n\nChristina Croft, Queen Victoriaâs Granddaughters: 1860-1918, 2013"
