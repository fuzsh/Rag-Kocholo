        "text": "For other Princes of Asturias named Alfonso, see Alfonso, Prince of Asturias.\n\nAlfonso, Prince of Asturias (Alfonso Pío Cristino Eduardo Francisco Guillermo Carlos Enrique Eugenio Fernando Antonio Venancio Borbón y Battenberg (Madrid, 10 May 1907 – Miami, Miami-Dade County, Florida, 6 September 1938), was an Infante of Spain and the heir-apparent of the throne of Spain from 1907 to 1931.\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n\n1.1 Early life\n\n1.2 Renunciation and first marriage\n\n1.3 Second marriage\n\n1.4 Death\n\n1.5 Succession\n\n2 Ancestry\n\n3 Sources\n\n4 External links\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\n\nAlfonso was the eldest child of the then-reigning king Alfonso XIII of Spain and his wife Victoria Eugenie. He inherited the genetic disorder haemophilia from his maternal line. He was a matrilineal great-grandson of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. He and his youngest brother Gonzalo were kept in specially-tailored jackets to prevent bloody accidents.\n\nHe was the 1,120th Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece in Spain in 1907.\n\nHis father the King faced increasing political problems that led Spain to become a Republic in 1931 when the monarch was deposed. The family moved into exile.\n\nRenunciation and first marriage\n\nThere had been plans of young Alfonso's deposition from succession, but ultimately he himself renounced his rights to the then-defunct throne to marry a commoner, Edelmira Ignacia Adriana Sampedro-Robato, in Ouchy on 21 June 1933, after which Alfonso took the courtesy title Count of Covadonga. (This was required by the regulations for the succession set by the Pragmatic Sanction of Charles III.) The couple divorced 8 May 1937, with Edemlira keeping the title Countess of Covadonga.\n\nSecond marriage\n\nHe married Marta Ester Rocafort-Altazarra in Havana on 3 July 1937. They divorced on 8 January 1938. He had no issue by either of his wives. By María Mercedes Flores de Apodaca, of Spanish family, he had a child born out of wedlock in 1932, Alphonse de Bourbon.\n\nDeath\n\nA car accident led to his early death in 1938, at the age of 31. He crashed into a telephone booth and appeared to have minor injuries but his haemophilia led to fatal internal bleeding. He was initially entombed at Woodlawn Park Cemetery and Mausoleum (now Caballero Rivero Woodlawn Park North Cemetery and Mausoleum) in Miami but in 1985 he was re-entombed in the Pantheon of the Princes in El Escorial. His first wife, who had been allowed to retain the title Countess of Covadonga, was present when he was re-entombed.\n\nSuccession\n\nThe last person to be titled Prince of Asturias before Alfonso's birth was his aunt Infanta Mercedes, who died three years before his birth; in practice, Alfonso's predecessor as first heir to Spain was his first cousin, Mercedes's son, the Infante Alfonso of the Two Sicilies.\n\nHis successor technically was his next brother, Infante Jaime, Duke of Segovia, who did not receive the Asturias title. Jaime's own renunciation took place soon after. In practice (but not titularly) the next heir-apparent of claims to Spanish throne was Alfonso's younger brother Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona. Generalissimo Francisco Franco gave Juan's son Infante Juan Carlos ranted the official title 'Prince of Spain' when he chose the Infante as heir to the throne; therefore the next member of the Spanish royal family to be officially invested with the title Principe de Asturias was Juan Carlos I's son Infante Felipe, Alfonso's grandnephew, in 1977.\n\nAncestry\n\nAncestors of Alfonso, Prince of Asturias (1907–1938)\n\n16.
