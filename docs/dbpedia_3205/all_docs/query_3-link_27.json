        "text": "Which Alfonso, I hear you ask. Well, none other than the full brother of OTL's Isabella I of Castile, who died at age 14. What if he didn't die young, instead outliving his sister, dying after 1504? He would be heir to the throne instead of his sister, though perhaps she still marries Ferdinand and becomes solely queen consort of Aragon. He would perhaps marry Joanna, Princess of Portugal (b. 1542), or Joanna of Aragon (OTL Queen of Naples, b. 1455). What changes?\n\nIf Alfonso lives he’ll likely marry Juana la Beltraneja as was planned in OTL. Though if she dies young Joanna of Aragon and Joanna of Portugal are possible.\n\nConsidering she outlived Ferdinand OTL, there's the possibility she might live. And probably would have married Alfonso, though who knows if a dispensation will arrive.\n\nIf Alfonso lives he’ll likely marry Juana la Beltraneja as was planned in OTL.

Same goes for a marriage with Portugal.\n\nSo...Ferdinand/Isabella, Alfonso/Joanna of Portugal. Can you imagine Isabella and Joanna bickering over dinner or something\n\nA match between Alfonso and Juana la Beltraneja would easily resolve the succession issues so that is a given (specially as Juana was half-Portuguese and her namesake cousin totally unwilling to marry) while the one between Isabella and Ferdinand is likely in any scenario\n\nA match between Alfonso and Juana la Beltraneja would easily resolve the succession issues so that is a given (specially as Juana was half-Portuguese and her namesake cousin totally unwilling to marry) while the one between Isabella and Ferdinand is likely in any scenario\n\nWhile it is likely, I wonder what will happen if Alfonso and Juana struggle to have children while Ferdinand and Isabella have their OTL children.

Will Joanna still be queen?\n\nAlfonso will be King and Joanna his consort. If they had no (surviving) children then Isabella’s children will inherit Castile\n\nWell, if Alfonso did marry Juana la Beltraneja then we have one more thing to consider.\n\nYes... that's right... more incest. Certainly, for the sake of bolstering the alliance, one of the kids of Ferdinand and Isabella would marry a child of Afonso - especially since Castile and Aragon will not be united under one monarch at this point. Ferdinand would have Aragon and his brother-in-law has Castile and Leon. If Afonso only has a girl (or a son) and Isabella and Ferdinand only have a boy (or girl, depending on which you go for with Alfonso) we could have even more closely related incest even earlier than Charles and Isabella of Portugal...\n\nWell, if Alfonso did marry Juana la Beltraneja then we have one more thing to consider.\n\nYes... that's right... more incest.
