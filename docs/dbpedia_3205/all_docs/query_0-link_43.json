        "text": "REFERENCE TITLE NAME BORN DIED TITLE NAME BORN DIED COMMENTS 10 Queen Isabel II of Spain 1830 1904 Infante Francisco de Asis of Spain (Duke of Cadiz) 1822 1902 Isabel's father King Fernando VII of Spain and Infante Francisco de Asis's father Infante Francisco de Paula of Spain (Duke of Cadiz) were brothers. Isabel's mother Princess Maria Christina of Bourbon Two Sicilies and Infante Francisco de Assisis's mother Princess Louise of Bourbon Two Sicilies were also sisters.\n\nIn other words Isabel and her husband Francisco de Asis were double first cousins since their respective fathers were married to two sisters.\n\n(Note - Since 1713 Salic Law applied in Spain but after Isabel's parents marriage (11 December 1829) Fernando revoked this law (on 30 June 1833) by Pragmatic Sanction. Ferdinand died three years after the birth of his daughter Isabel and she was proclaimed Queen of Spain with her mother, Marie Christina as Regent. Ferdinand's brother Carlos protested this change and on 4 October 1833 he was proclaimed as King. A treaty (22 April 1834) between Great Britain, France, Spain and Portugal provided for the expulsion of Carlos and in June 1834 Carlos retired to England and the following month the Carlist War began in Spain).\n\nIsabel was deposed and driven out of Spain following a revolution on 30 September 1868 and abdicated to her eldest son Alfonso on 25 June 1870. One of the instigators of this uprising was Isabel's brother-in-law Prince Antoine of Orleans (Duke of Montpensier).\n\nAn interesting account on the marriage of Queen Isabel and Infante Francisco de Asis.\n\nReport on the death of Queen Isabel.\n\nReport on the death of Infante Francisco de Asis 10.1 Stillborn Son 1849 1849 10.2 Infante Ferdinand of Spain 1850 1850 10.3 Infanta Maria Isabel \"la Chata\" of Spain (Princess of Asturias) 1851 1931 Prince Gaetan of Bourbon-Two Sicilies (Count of Girgenti) 1846 1871 See 37.557 - Gaetan was created Infante of Spain on 14 May 1868. He was an epileptic and committed suicide by a pistol shot to his head.\n\nIt was reported in 1870 that a suit for conjugal separation between the Count of Girgenti and his wife Infanta Maria Isabel. It was said that Gaetan had squandered his wife's dowry.\n\nA report on the death of Infanta Maria Isabel.\n\nNew York Times obituary on Prince Gaetan and their later report surrounding his suicide. 10.4 Infanta Maria Christina of Spain 1854 1854 10.5 Stillborn Son 1855 1855 10.6 Stillborn Son 1856 1856 10.7 King Alfonso XII of Spain 1857 1885 Infanta Maria de las Mercedes of Spain 1860 1878 See 13.J6 - Alfonso ascended the throne in 1875.\n\nPrince Amedeo of Savoy (1 st Duke of Aosta) was the King of Spain from 16 November 1870 to 11 February 1873.\n\nA report on the death of Maria de las Mercedes who died just five months after her marriage to Alfonso 10.7 King Alfonso XII of Spain 1857 1885 Archduchess Maria Christina of Austria (Teschen Line) 1858 1929 See 44.33 - Alfonso ascended the throne in 1875.\n\nPrince Amedeo of Savoy (1 st Duke of Aosta) was the King of Spain from 16 November 1870 to 11 February 1873.\n\nAlfonso suffered from tuberculosis but the reports of his death said he died from dysentery.\n\nA report on the marriage of Alfonso and Maria Christina 10.71 Infanta Maria de las Mercedes of Spain (Princess of Asturias) 1880 1904 Prince Carlos of Bourbon-Two Sicilies 1870 1949 See 37.5542 - Maria de las Mercedes died a week after giving birth to her daughter Isabella.\n\nA report on the death of Maria de las Mercedes .\n\nCarlos became a naturalised Spanish subject and was granted the title Infante of Spain on 7 February 1901. Carlos's children were also Infantes of Spain by Royal Decree of King Alfonso XIII of Spain on 3 August 1908. There's some dispute as to whether Prince Carlos validly renounced his rights to the throne of Bourbon-Two Sicilies on 14 December 1900 on his marriage to Maria de las Mercedes in execution of the Pragmatic Decree\" prohibiting the union of the Spanish and Two Sicilies Crowns. Supporters of this side of the family are apparently of the opinion that Carlos did not have the right to renounce for his descendants.\n\nThe impending marriage of Carlos and Maria de las Mercedes caused discontent and riots in Spain. 10.72 Infanta Maria Theresa of Spain 1882 1912 Prince Ferdinand of Bavaria 1884 1958 See 18.1911- Ferdinand was naturalised in Spain on 20 October 1905 and created Infante of Spain at the same time. He renounced his rights to the Bavarian throne on 29 June 1914 although he was granted permission on 3 August 1914 to continue ad persona the right, title and rank of Prince of Bavaria. His children were born Prince/Princess of Bavaria but were raised to Infante/Infanta of Spain when they were born. Maria Theresa died from an embolism (formation of a blood clot) just one week after the birth of her daughter Maria del Pilar 10.73 King Alfonso XIII of Spain 1886 1941 Princess Victoria Eugenia \"Ena\" of Battenberg 1887 1969 See 5.1442 - Alfonso was born posthumously (his father having died six months before his birth), he therefore became a King from his birth and his mother Queen Maria Christina acted as Regent until he reached his sixteenth birthday.\n\nAlfonso and his new wife Ena had a most unsatisfactory wedding day, during their return from their wedding to their Palace Mateo Moral an anarchist threw a bomb at their carriage and they narrowly escaped death. Mateo Moral committed suicide shortly afterwards. Another slightly different account on the suicide of Mateo Moral.\n\nFollowing republican demonstrations, King Alfonso left Spain without abdicating on 14 April 1931. He subsequently abdicated on 15 January 1941 just three months before his death in favour of his son Infante Juan.\n\nAn Interesting article on Ena regarding what awaited her when she married Alfonso, going from the seclusion of Osborne House to the rigid etiquette and protocol of the Spanish Court.\n\nQueen Ena was separated from her husband Alfonso and was staying in London and missed the marriage of her daughter Beatriz to Prince Alessandro Torlonia.\n\nInfanta Beatriz and Prince Alessandro Torlonia arrived in London a couple of days after their wedding presumably to visit her mother Queen Ena.\n\nAn interesting article on the \"broken love\" of Queen Ena.\n\nA report on the death of King Alfonso XIII.\n\nA brief report on the death of Queen Ena 10.731 - QVD Infante Alfonso of Spain (Count of Covadonga and Prince of Asturias) 1907 1938 Edelmira Sampedro y Robato 1906 1994 Alfonso gave up his rights to the Spanish throne on 21 June 1933 when he married Edelmira Sampedro y Robato.\n\nAn interesting article on two Cuban women who gave blood in 1936 to save the life of Alfonso who was profusely bleeding due to a minor external abscess on his thigh.\n\nAn account of the meeting and marriage of Alfonso and Edelmira with mention of a possible son from their relationship.\n\nThe marriage of Alfonso and Edelmira ended in divorce 10.731 - QVD Infante Alfonso of Spain (Count of Covadonga and Prince of Asturias) 1907 1938 Marta Rocafort y Altuzarra 1913 1993 Alfonso died from injuries received in a motor car accident in Miami, Florida. The car was driven by Mildred Gaydon who was employed as a cigarette girl in a cabaret and who was slightly injured.The subsequent coroner's jury absolved Mildred (on page six column 6) of any blame in the death of Alfonso.\n\nSome reports mentions Alfonso who was a haemophilic sufferer died from his injuries as the resultant bleeding could not be contained . However an article published days after Alfonso's accident and subsequent death reported \"a physician said that death was caused by heart failure and shock, and not by haemophilia\".\n\nA report on the wedding of Alfonso and Maria Rocafort y Altuzarra.\n\nA brief article on the divorce of Alfonso from his first and second wives within one year.\n\nA detailed article published in \"The Biscayne Times\" in 2009 provides a retrospect of how \"In 1938 a future king met his fate on the Boulevard\" 10.732 - QVD Infante Jaime of Spain (Duke of Segovia) 1908 1975 Countess Emmanela de Dampierre 1913 2012 Infante Jaime became a deaf mute following a botched operation after an attack of mastoiditis in 1911. He renounced his rights of succession to the Spanish throne for both himself and his descendants on 21 June 1933.\n\nA brief report on the wedding of Infante Jaime and Countess Emmanela de Dampierre including photographs of the happy couple. 10.732 - QVD Infante Jaime of Spain (Duke of Segovia) 1908 1975 Charlotte Tiedemann 1919 1979 Infante Jaime became a deaf mute following a botched operation after an attack of mastoiditis in 1911. He renounced his rights of succession to the Spanish throne for both himself and his descendants on 21 June 1933.\n\nIn 1949 Infante Jaime was reported as being anxious to resolve the problem of sharing out the fortune of his late father King Alfonso XIII.\n\nIn early 1950 Charlotte was responsible for a series of articles how she would \"abdicate\" to enable Infante Jaime to nullify the renouncement of his succession rights.\n\nFirst part\n\nSecond part\n\nThird and final part\n\n10.7321 - QVD Alfonso de Borbon y de Dampierre (Duke of Cadiz) 1936 1989 Maria del Carmen Martinez-Bordiu y Franco 1951 Alfonso died as a result of a skiing accident in Beaver Creek Colorado. At the time of his death he was engaged to Archduchess Maria Constance of Austria . Maria del Carmen is the granddaughter of General Franco.\n\nA brief report on the weding of Alfonso and Maria del Carmen 10.73211 - QVD Francisco de Borbon y de Martinez-Bordiu 1972 1984 Francisco died as a result of injuries sustained in a motor car accident, the car in which he was a passenger was being driven by his father Alfonso de Borbon y de Dampierre (Duke of Cadiz) crashed into a truck. Francisco's brother Luis Alfonso de Borbon y de Martinez-Bordiu and their governess Manuela Sánchez Prat were also passengers in the car. Francisco was taken to the \"Hospital de Navarra\" where he died from cardiac arrest. By a strange coincidence Francisco's grandfather Cristóbal Martínez-Bordiú y Ortega (10th Marquis of Villaverde) is a Spanish heart surgeon and it was he who communicated the death to the family. Cristóbal Martínez-Bordiú y Ortega was married to María del Carmen Franco y Polo daughter of General Franco. 10.73212 - QVD Luis Alfonso de Borbon y de Martinez-Bordiu (Duke of Anjou) 1974 María Margarita Vargas Santaella 1983 Luis Alfonso is a claimant to the French throne, and considered to be the head of the French Royal House by legitimists who consider the renunciation of Philip V of Spain as invalid.

Alessandro's great-great-grand father Giovanni Torlonia (1755-1829) who in return for the administration of the Vatican finances with the blessing of the Pope was created in 1803 1st Prince of Civitella-Cesi.\n\nThe Torlonia family were extremely wealthy and were considered as the Rothschilds of Rome as depicted by this article. The Don Alessandro Torlonia mentioned in the article was a younger brother to Alessandro's (husband of Infanta Beatriz) great grandfather.\n\nAlessandro (husband of Infanta Beatriz) was said to be the wealthiest land-owner in Europe and had to give up part of huge estates as part of Italy's land reform policy in 1950. 10.7331 - QVD Princess Alessandra \"Sandra\" Torlonia of Civitella-Cesi 1936 2014 Count Clemente Lequio di Assaba 1925 1971 A photograph of the \"beautiful\" Alessandra \"Sandra\" Torlonia.\n\nCount Clemente committed suicide 10.73311 - QVD Count Alessandro Lequio di Assaba 1960 Antonia Dell'Atte 1960 10.73311 - QVD Count Alessandro Lequio di Assaba 1960 María Palacios y Milla 1977 10.733111 - QVD Count Clemente Lequio di Assaba 1988 Corbie Gregory 1979 Clemente and Corbie were secretly married out of the glare of the public. 10.733112 - QVD Allesandro Lequio di Assaba 1992 2020 Allesandro's parents are Count Alessandro Lequiodi Assaba and Ana Garcia y Obregon 10.733113 - QVD Ginevra Lequio di Assaba 2016 10.73312 - QVD Countess Deserie Lequio di Assaba 1962 Count Oddone Tournon 1957 10.733121 - QVD Count Giovanni Tournon 1991 10.733122 - QVD Count Giorgio Tournon 1994 10.7332 - QVD Prince Marco Alfonso Torlonia of Civitella-Cesi (6th Prince) 1937 2014 Princess Orsetta Caracciolo 1940 1968 10.7332 - QVD Prince Marco Alfonso Torlonia of Civitella-Cesi (6th Prince) 1937 2014 Philippa Mcdonald 1942 Philippa McDonald was firstly married to Vicomte Luc de La Barre de Nanteuil (26 July 1962 according Marlene A.Eilers Queen Victoria's Descendants). Currently I can't locate this marriage in the 1962 Marriage Index but can find a possible marriage in the 1964 September Marriage Index .Luc de La Barre de Nanteuil was Ambassador of France to the United States, then in Great Britain.\n\nPhilippa McDonald was secondly married to Marco Alfonso Torlonia on 9 November 1968 (Divorced 1985).\n\nPhilippa McDonald was thirdly married to Laurie Morgan (date not known at present). Lawrence 'Laurie' Morgan (1915 -1997) won two golds medal in equestrian at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome and also became the first Australian to win an equestrian gold medal.\n\nAn interesting extract from Ben Toney's (original Programme Director of Radio London) autobiography in which he relates to his encounter with Prince Marco Torlonia and his future wife Philippa, Countess of Nanteuil. Ben Toney mentions Philippa McDonald an Australian model from Perth had gone to Paris to promote her modelling career. While she was there, she met and married the Count of Nanteuil - the inference is that Philippa and the Count of Nanteuil had married in Paris rather than London.\n\nAnother interesting article on Philippa and her life with Marco Alfonso Torlonia 10.7332 - QVD Prince Marco Alfonso Torlonia of Civitella-Cesi (6th Prince) 1937 2014 Blazena Svitakova 1940 10.73321 - QVD Prince Giovanni Torlonia of Civitella-Cesi (7th Prince) 1962 Carla De Stefanis 1966 10.733211 - QVD Prince Stanislao Torlonia of Civitella-Cesi 2005 10.733212 - QVD Princess Olimpia Torlonia of Civitella-Cesi 2008 10.73322 - QVD Princess Vittoria Torlonia of Civitella-Cesi 1971 Kenneth Lindsay 1970 10.73322 - QVD Princess Vittoria Torlonia of Civitella-Cesi 1971 Stefano Colonna 1965 10.733221 - QVD Josephine Lindsay 1998 10.733222 - QVD Benedict Lindsay 2001 10.733223 - QVD Francesca Colonna 2008 10.73323 - QVD Princess Caterina Torlonia of Civitella-Cesi 1974 Stefano d'Albora 1966 10.733231 - QVD Gianpoalo d'Albora 2002 10.733232 - QVD Gianmarco d'Albora 2003 10.7333 - QVD Prince Marino Torlonia of Civitella-Cesi 1939 1995 10.7334 - QVD Princess Olimpia Torlonia of Civitella-Cesi 1943 Paul-Annik Weiller 1933 1998 Obituary of Paul-Annik Weiller 10.73341 - QVD Beatrice Weiller 1967 Andre Correa do Lago 1959 10.733411 - QVD Paul-Annik Weiller Correa do Lago 1996 10.733412 - QVD Helena Weiller Correa do Lago 1997 10.733413 - QVD Antonio Weiller Correa do Lago 1999 10.733414 - QVD Victoria Weiller Correa do Lago 2000 10.73342 - QVD Sibilla Weiller 1968 Prince Guillaume of Luxemburg 1963 See 34.2215 10.73343 - QVD Paul-Alexandre Weiller 1970 1975 10.73344 - QVD Laura Weiller 1974 1980 10.73345 - QVD Cosima Weiller 1984 10.73346 - QVD Domitilla Weiller 1985 10.734 - QVD Stillborn Son (son of Princess Victoria Eugenia of Battenberg and King Alfonso XIII of Spain) 1910 1910 A brief report on the sad occasion of the birth of the stillborn son 10.735 - QVD Infanta Maria Christina of Spain 1911 1996 Enrico Marone-Cinzano (1st Count of Marone-Cinzano) 1895 1968 Enrico was created the Count of Marone-Cinzano by King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy on 13 May 1940 to mark his marriage to Maria Christina on 10 June 1940.\n\nEnrico is from the famous \"Vermouth\" family.

Paul Preston's is a professor at the LSE and regarded as the leading historian of twentieth-century Spain alive, his book caused a furore by suggesting the future monarch may have pulled the trigger.\n\nA newspaper report at the time indicated Infante Alfonso had accidently killed himself whilst cleaning his pistol. 10.737 - QVD Infante Gonzalo of Spain 1914 1934 Infante Gonzalo who suffered from haemophilia bled to death 2 days after being involved in a car accident Lake Worth, Carinthia, Austria , his sister Infanta Beatriz who was driving the car suffered only slight injuries. 10.8 Infanta Maria de la Concepcion of Spain 1859 1861 10.9 Infanta Maria del Pilar of Spain 1861 1879 10.J Infanta Maria de la Paz of Spain 1862 1946 Prince Ludwig Ferdinand of Bavaria 1859 1949 See 18.191 - An account of an audiance by Maria de la Paz with Pope Leo XIII 10.K Infanta Marie Eulalia of Spain 1864 1958 Prince Antonia of Orleans (4th Duke of Galliera) 1866 1930 See 13.J8 - Prince Antonia was also Infante of Spain\n\nAntonia of Orleans (4th Duke of Galliera) inherited the title from a rich Genoa lady (Maria Brignole Sale De Ferrari) via a somewhat convoluted route.\n\nThe first Duchess of Galliera (1813 to 1817) was Princess Josephine of Leuchtenberg\n\nThe second Duchess of Galliera (1837-1888) was Maria Brignole Sale De Ferrari (1811-1888) wife of the Marquis Raffaele Ferrari (1808-1876) who was created Duke of Galliera by Pope Gregory XVI in 1837, both Maria and her husband Raffaele were extremely rich in their own rights.\n\nThey had three children, the oldest died one year of age, their second child Andrea (1831-1847) grew up as friend of Antonia's father Antoine of Orleans (Duke of Montpensier). Maria and Raffaele's youngest son Philip ( 1850 -1917 ) had no interest in titles or enormous wealth and when Maria Brignole Sale De Ferrari died her wealth and title (i.e. Galliera) were passed to Antoine of Orleans (Duke of Montpensier) in view of the friendship between him and her son Andrea.\n\nI haven't located any reference to Antoine of Orleans (Duke of Montpensier) being designated (Duke of Galliera).\n\nIn 1895, King Umberto I of Italy recognised Antonio as the heir of the title Duke of Galliera (4th).\n\nNew York Times article on Antonia (Duke of Galliera) escape!"
