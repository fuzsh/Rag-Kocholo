        "text": "a fight.\n\nJust before he died he re-\n\nmarked to ex-Queen Ena,\n\nfrom whom he had been\n\nestranged for six years: —\n\n'I hope my death will not dis\n\ntress Don Juan— his third son\n\nwho is heir to the throne— too\n\nmuch. He must learn that kings\n\nmust suffer and be brave.'\n\nThen he called Juan to his side,\n\nmurmured: 'Your Majesty— Spain be.\n\nfore all.'\n\nThen he summoned a Spanish\n\nJesuit priest and prepared for the\n\nend.\n\nIt was stated recently in Lisbon\n\nthat Alfonso had signed a document\n\ngiving Don Juan full right to ascend\n\nthe Spanish throne, if invited to do\n\nso.\n\nBorn A King\n\nEx-King Alfonso XIII of Spain was\n\nliterally born a king. The posthu\n\nmous son of King Alfonso XII of\n\nSpain, Alfonso himself became King\n\nof Spain in name on the day of his\n\nbirth, May 17, 1886.\n\nSixteen years later (his mother\n\nin the meantime having acted as\n\nregent), he ascended the throne\n\nto assume its full powers and\n\nobligations.\n\nWhen the revolution of 1931 broke\n\nout and he left the country to go into\n\nexile, he refused to abdicate formally.\n\nOn the contrary, he issued a mani\n\nfesto on April 15, 1931, the day after\n\nhe left, declaring, 'I am King of all\n\nSpaniards ... I renounce no single\n\none of my rights.'\n\nDon Alfonso's life was stormy.\n\nDuring the 29 years he was on\n\nthe throne, there were eight at\n\ntempts to assassinate him.\n\nThe most dramatic of these was on\n\nMay 31, 1906, the day of his wedding\n\nto the English princess, Victoria\n\nEugenia Ena of Battenburg, niece of\n\nKing Edward VII.\n\nThe plots against Alfonso's life,\n\nhowever, dated much farther back.\n\nIn fact, on the very day he was\n\ncrowned (May 17, 1902), secret\n\npolice thwarted an attempt t to as\n\nsassinate the 16-year-old king.\n\nMany Changes\n\nWhen Alfonso ascended the throne\n\nthe country was in a very bad state\n\neconomically. Distress was prevalent.\n\nSocialism and anarchism began to be\n\ncome real forces; discontent was rife;\n\ntrouble, rioting and finally war broke\n\nout in Morocco (lasting until 1926).\n\nChange after change was tried\n\nin the administration, there being\n\n20 cabinets in one period of six\n\nyears.\n\nAs captain-general of Barcelona,\n\nPrimo de Rivera in 1923 headed a\n\nbloodless coup d'etat and made him\n\nself dictator. King Alfonso did not\n\nmove against the general, but invited\n\nhim to take charge of the Government\n\nwhen the Cabinet resigned. The part\n\nnership of King and Dictator lasted\n\nsix years.\n\nRepublican and other liberal lead\n\ners who had been exiled since 1923\n\nthen came back and a flood of agita\n\ntion against monarchial institutions\n\nwas released.\n\nIn 1931 a republic was pro\n\nclaimed at Barcelona and the\n\nmovement spread quickly. The\n\nRepublican leaders presented\n\ntheir ultimatum — abdication or\n\nrevolution.\n\nThe King had promised that he\n\nwould not plunge his country into\n\ncivil war; he kept his promise, at the\n\nprice of his throne.\n\nThe new Republic of Spain tried\n\nthe ex-King for high treason in his\n\nabsence. He was found guilty; his\n\ngoods and property were declared\n\nforfeit, and he was condemned to per\n\npetual banishment.\n\nFamily Troubles\n\nThe ex-King, who had gone to\n\nFrance, then became involved in a\n\nseries of family worries and cares.\n\nIn 1935, there was an estrangement\n\nfrom his wife, ex-Queen Victoria\n\nEugenia.\n\nThe year before, his eldest son, and\n\nheir to the throne, Alfonso Prince of\n\nAsturias, had married a commoner,\n\nthe Cuban, Edelmira Sanpedro-Ocejo,\n\nagainst his father's wishes.\n\nDon Alfonso insisted that his\n\nson give up his rights to the\n\nthrone. This was done and he\n\nwas created Count of Covadonga.\n\nIn 1935 Alfonso lost his youngest\n\nson, Don Gonzalo. Alfonso's second\n\nson, Don Jaime then followed his\n\neldest brother's example and relin\n\nquished his rights to the throne.\n\nAlfonso was described as one of\n\nthe richest monarchs of his time. Pre\n\ncise figures were never made public,\n\nbut it was known that he inherited a\n\npersonal fortune of several millions,\n\nwhich he increased materially by in\n\nvestments in British and other securi\n\nties."
