        "text": "Alfonso II (born 759, Oviedo, Asturias—died 842, Oviedo) was the king of Asturias from 791 to 842, the son of Fruela I. He had to face frequent and determined attacks by the armies of the emirate of Córdoba and was often defeated, but his doggedness saved Asturias from extinction. He built a new capital, Oviedo, on a strategic site in the mountains. Inspired in part by the traditions of the lost kingdom of the Visigoths, which had been conquered by the Muslims in the early 8th century, he set about giving the Asturian kingdom a national identity. He tried to enter into relations with Charlemagne, but although he seems to have failed to get Carolingian support, there are traces of Frankish influence in Asturias. During Alfonso’s reign the discovery of the supposed tomb of St. James the Apostle in Galicia made the kingdom the guardian of an important Christian shrine (Santiago de Compostela), and this, too, helped to give it a national identity."
