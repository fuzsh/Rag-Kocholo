Alfonso, Prince of Asturias (1907â€“1938), in bed, where he spent most of his life.

A prince who could have been king of Spain but he suffered from what is still today called the disease of kings, hemophilia.

He was born in the Royal Palace of Madrid on May 10, 1907. His arrival in the world filled his parents, Kings Alfonso XIII and Princess Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg. His birth was a real happiness for everyone because he was a boy; In a country where the wounds of the Carlist wars were still so open and where the memory of the reign of Elizabeth II continued to cause rashes, everyone wanted Alfonso XIII to have a male child as soon as possible. With that, the English queen, Ena, already complied. But, alas, how little joy sometimes lasts in the rich man's house, let alone in that of the poor ... And in a few days that joy would turn into a deep disappointment that would make the royal couple a very unhappy marriage .

Because it was not long before the prince was suffering from the cursed disease, hemophilia, which was still unknown at the beginning of the 20th century and for which there was no treatment. Hemophilia is a serious, inherited blood clotting disorder that usually affects men, although it is transmitted to them by their mothers. And it has been called the disease of kings because members of many dynasties in Europe suffered it decades ago. Through descendants of Queen Victoria of England, hemophilia reached the courts of almost all of Europe, sowing them with grief; one of the most famous cases was that of the Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich Romanov, who was shot with the rest of his family on July 17, 1918 in Yekaterinburg, when he was barely 13 years old, and after suffering a very limited existence because of that cursed disease .
