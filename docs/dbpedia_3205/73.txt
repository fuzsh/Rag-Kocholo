Alfonso was monarch from his birth in 1883, because his father had died the previous year, until 1931 when a Second Spanish Republic was proclaimed and he went into exile.

His parents were King Alfonso XII, and Archduchess Maria Christina of Austria.

Alfonso married Princess Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg (Ena), on 31 May 1906, in Madrid. Victoria Eugenie converted to Catholicism for the marriage.

The couple had six living children, unfortunately Victoria Eugenie was a carrier of haemophilia, and two of their sons, including their eldest child, Alfonso, Prince of Asturias, developed the condition.

From 1914 on Alfonso had several mistresses, and fathered five illegitimate children. A sixth illegitimate child was born before his marriage.

In 1933, his two eldest sons, Alfonso and Jaime, renounced their claims to the throne, and in 1934 his youngest son Gonzalo died. This left his third son Juan, Count of Barcelona his only heir. Juan was the father of Juan Carlos I.

On 15 January 1941, Alfonso XIII abdicated his rights to the Spanish throne in favour of Juan, and he died in Rome on 28 February of that year.
