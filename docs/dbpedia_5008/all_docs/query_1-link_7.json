Qt also allows you to write and use the same code across any platform.\n\nQt is based on the Qt Quick technology including the declarative language QML, devoted in writing modern and attractive user interfaces with animations and graphical effects.\n\nWith QML you can integrate 2D contents representing the product interface, with 3D contents to display information."
