        "text": "Highly reliable embedded systems start with secure, rock-solid hardware designs, such as those provided by WINSYSTEMS. The application software provides the unique functionality systems developers require for their embedded product solutions.\n\nThe Finnish software company, Qt, has based its highly efficient and flexible development platform on the principle of reducing coding effort to accelerate creativity. The cross-platform framework shortens the development cycle because it requires minimal-to-no code changes to run on a wide range of operating systems or on bare metal.\n\nThe object-oriented framework is written in C++ and includes a Graphical User Interface (GUI) framework, libraries, and toolsets. Tools include Qt Creator, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that supports extensible and true component programming; Qt for Device Creation development framework for embedded platforms that also supports various reference hardware through custom BSPs; and Qt Design Studio to simulate the design during prototyping with the ability to validate interactions and dynamic behaviors.\n\nThe single software code can be used across the most popular operating systems (including Windows, Embedded Linux, VxWorks, Integrity as well as desktop and mobile), and includes libraries and toolsets which allow developers to spend their time being creative rather than repeatedly coding blocks.\n\nIn addition, once the source code is written, it can be deployed immediately. This means that fewer resources are needed to deploy the design to a wide user base. It is also the case that just a single Application Programming Interface (API), with a single, consistent syntax, needs to be learned.\n\nThe Qt toolkit includes tools for coding, building, compiling and testing the APIs. There is also support from Qt or its network of partners, to meet regulatory standards and compliance.\n\nAdaptable, agile development enables developers to share or reuse code across multiple platforms and devices, reducing the costs of initial development and any updates across multiple platforms.\n\nQt’s software development framework has the added advantage that a single source code can be used across projects and design teams as well as operating systems, for rapid development and deployment.\n\nWINSYSTEMS’ rugged and highly reliable industrial embedded computer systems combined with the Qt software development framework offer OEMs and systems integrators high performing embedded platform solutions that can help them speed time to market and lower development costs.\n\nApplications such as industrial automation, digital signage, utilities and building automation require a versatile single board computer (SBC) that is high-performance and robust in harsh conditions. The ITX-P-C444 SBC is an industrial Pico-ITX SBC based on NXP’s i.MX8M application processor. The compact board measures just 102 x 73mm, operates at the industrial operating temperature range of -40 to +85°C (-40 to +185°F) and packed with dual Ethernet, industrial I/O, and expansion options.\n\nRobust hardware-based security is provided by the NXP Hardware Security Engine (HSE) and a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 chip.\n\nThe ITX-P-C444 is made in the USA by WINSYSTEMS and offers a compact, high-performance solution for secure, reliable, low-power processing in challenging conditions. It is compatible with Linux and Qt Embedded Board Support Packages (BSP) and Software Development Kit (SDK)."
