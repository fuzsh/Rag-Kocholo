Most of our packages are bumped out of the overlay and tree changes will be lost if not also made there.\n\nQA policy on USE=gui should be followed\n\nDependencies\n\nExplicitly depend on all Qt modules that are used - do not rely on transitive dependencies (including ).\n\nSpecify the correct slot - most Qt modules have two major versions.\n\nThe := subslot dependency operator must only be used for packages that are known to use a private part of the Qt API.\n\nHandling different versions of Qt\n\nWe recommend all packages with a Qt dependency follow these recommendations to ensure a consistent user experience.\n\nAvoiding unnecessary REQUIRED_USE is important to minimise user interaction, especially as USE=\"qt5 qt6\" becomes a common configuration.\n\nOptional support for a single Qt version\n\nFor example, a CLI application with an optional Qt GUI.\n\nIf the package has no other GUI toolkit support, implement USE=gui.\n\nIf the package supports two Qt versions (Qt 5 and Qt 6) but upstream prefer Qt 5, implement USE=gui and USE=qt6. USE=gui would use qt5.\n\nDepending on the Qt version required, implement the appropriate USE flag: qt5 or qt6.\n\nOptional support for one of two Qt versions\n\nFor example, a CLI application with an optional GUI that can be built with Qt 5 or Qt 6.\n\nImplement both qt5 and qt6 USE flags\n\nWhen both qt5 and qt6 USE flags are enabled, prefer qt5\n\nDo not use REQUIRED_USE=\"?? ( qt5 qt6 )\"\n\nOptional support for two Qt versions\n\nFor example, a library with both Qt 5 and Qt 6 bindings (example: ).\n\nImplement both qt5 and qt6 USE flags\n\nRequires at least one Qt version\n\nFor example, a library with a SONAME that changes based on which Qt version it was built against (example: ).\n\nImplement both qt5 and qt6 USE flags\n\nEnable the qt5 USE flag by default: USE=\"+qt5\"\n\nAdd REQUIRED_USE=\"|| ( qt5 qt6 )\"\n\nUse multibuild eclass instead of revision slotting (-r500, -r600)\n\nRequires one of two Qt versions\n\nFor example, a Qt-based media player that can be built with either Qt 5 or Qt 6 (example: ).\n\nImplement a qt6 USE flag to choose Qt 6\n\nDo not implement a qt5 USE flag and do not use REQUIRED_USE=\"^^ ( qt5 qt6 )\"\n\nFor a more troublesome example, a library that can only support either Qt 5 or Qt 6. First, consider one of the following options (especially for a non-niche library that many users will be installing):\n\nStill try to support both at once, e.g. with multibuild.eclass if libraries can coexist\n\nDrop support for the old Qt version entirely (including in reverse dependencies)\n\nUse revision \"fake\" slotting (-r500, -r600) for a smoother transition but only if reverse dependencies can align (all qt5 or all qt6 to avoid conflicts, safe if only one package)\n\nIf deemed too troublesome, a last option that is acceptable for niche libraries but still discouraged (similar end result as revision slotting that is easier to maintain but requires more work from users), is:"
