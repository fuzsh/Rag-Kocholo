However, it crashes instantly on execution. I have added only a single line of functional code attempting to initialize an authentication object, but the program is crashing even before it reaches the attempt.\n\nBefore I go any further down what could be a very long and frustrating road, I would like to know if there are any fundamental incompatibilities that would make this impossible.\n\nI am currently using quite a few third-party libraries, including portaudio and openssl, but many of these open-source libraries were written to be portable, and the Zoom SDK appears not to be in that category.\n\nThere are a number of possible solutions, including recompiling the Qt project with the Visual C++ compiler instead of MinGW.\n\nAny and all advice would be welcome."
