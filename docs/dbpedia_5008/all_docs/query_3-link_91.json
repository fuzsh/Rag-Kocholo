        "text": "Planning initiation of SERENITY At-Home pivotal Phase 3 trial of BXCL501 for acute treatment of agitation associated with bipolar disorders or schizophrenia\n\nAdvancing plans for TRANQUILITY In-Care pivotal Phase 3 trial with BXCL501 for agitation associated with Alzheimer’s dementia\n\nReported positive topline results from IGALMI™ post-marketing requirement (PMR) study\n\nConference call set for 8:00 a.m. ET today\n\nNEW HAVEN, Conn., Aug. 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BioXcel Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: BTAI), a biopharmaceutical company utilizing artificial intelligence to develop transformative medicines in neuroscience and immuno-oncology, today announced its financial results for the second quarter of 2024.\n\n“We are on track with our business priorities as we focus on bringing BXCL501 to the greatest number of patients in need,” said Vimal Mehta, Ph.D., CEO of BioXcel Therapeutics. “We are pleased with the progress with our SERENITY and TRANQUILITY programs and our focused market-access strategy for IGALMI™. Our confidence in our lead neuroscience asset is underpinned by its broad therapeutic potential across multiple neuropsychiatric conditions and its growing intellectual property portfolio.”\n\nLate-Stage Clinical Programs\n\nSERENITY At-Home* Pivotal Phase 3 Trial: designed to evaluate the safety of a 120 mcg dose of BXCL501 in the at-home setting for agitation associated with bipolar disorders or schizophrenia.\n\nRecently received feedback on protocol from U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nTRANQUILITY In-Care Pivotal Phase 3 Trial: designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 60 mcg dose of BXCL501 for agitation associated with Alzheimer’s dementia (AAD).\n\nProtocol being finalized for planned submission to FDA.\n\nIGALMI™ (dexmedetomidine) Sublingual film\n\nPost-marketing Requirement (PMR) Study\n\nReported positive topline results from PMR study evaluating PRN (as-needed) treatment of IGALMI™ for agitation associated with bipolar disorders or schizophrenia.\n\nStudy achieved its objective and demonstrated no evidence of tachyphylaxis, tolerance, or withdrawal with 180 mcg dose (highest approved dose).\n\nAlthough this PMR study was not statistically powered to evaluate repeat dose efficacy, a reduction in agitation was observed for each episode occurring during the seven-day study period, and no serious adverse events were reported following treatment.\n\nCommercialization\n\nIGALMI™ net revenue grew 90% in Q2 2024 over Q1 2024 driven by focused market-access strategy and increased contracting with psychiatric care clinics and behavioral health facilities using a small commercial team.\n\nPatent Portfolio\n\nThe Company continues to strengthen its intellectual property portfolio for IGALMI™.\n\nRecently received a U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) Notice of Allowance for U.S. Patent Application No. 18/526,686 for IGALMI™. Once issued by the USPTO, the patent is expected to have an expiration date of January 12, 2043, and will be submitted for listing in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (commonly known as the \"Orange Book\").\n\nThis is expected to be the 11th listed U.S. patent for IGALMI™ in the Orange Book.\n\nOnkosXcel Therapeutics\n\nLate-breaking abstract on preliminary findings from a Phase 2 investigator-sponsored trial of BXCL701 and KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) presented at 2024 ASCO Annual Meeting by Dr. Benjamin Weinberg, Principal Investigator, Georgetown University Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Financial Results\n\nNet Revenue: Net revenue from IGALMI was $1.1 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $457 thousand for the same period in 2023, representing a 141% increase. Sequential quarterly revenue increased 90% in Q2 2024 from Q1 2024. The increased revenue for both periods was primarily driven by an increase in contracting with psychiatric care clinics and behavioral health facilities.\n\nResearch and Development (R&D) Expenses: R&D expenses were $8.0 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $27.0 million for the same period in 2023. The decreased expenses were primarily attributable to the wind-down of the SERENITY III and TRANQUILITY II and III trials, as well as decreased professional fees, personnel, and related costs.\n\nSelling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses: SG&A expenses were $9.5 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $25.9 million for the same period in 2023. The reduced expenses were primarily attributable to a decrease in personnel and costs associated with the commercialization of IGALMI compared to the second quarter of 2023, driven by the Company’s strategic reprioritization announced in August 2023.\n\nNet Loss: BioXcel Therapeutics had a net loss of $8.3 million for the second quarter of 2024**, compared to a net loss of $53.5 million for the same period in 2023. The Company used $23.2 million in operating cash during the second quarter of 2024.\n\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $56.3 million as of June 30, 2024.\n\n*SERENITY At-Home represents the redesigned SERENITY III trial.\n\n**In the second quarter of 2024, the loss from operations of $17.3 million was offset by unrealized gains related to derivative liabilities.\n\nConference Call and Webcast\n\nBioXcel Therapeutics will host a conference call and webcast today, August 6, 2024, at 8:00 a.m. ET to discuss its second quarter 2024 financial results.

The safety and effectiveness of IGALMI has not been studied beyond 24 hours from the first dose. It is not known if IGALMI is safe and effective in children.\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nIGALMI can cause serious side effects, including:\n\nDecreased blood pressure, low blood pressure upon standing, and slower than normal heart rate, which may be more likely in patients with low blood volume, diabetes, chronic high blood pressure, and older patients. IGALMI is taken under the supervision of a healthcare provider who will monitor vital signs (like blood pressure and heart rate) and alertness after IGALMI is administered to help prevent falling or fainting. Patients should be adequately hydrated and sit or lie down after taking IGALMI and instructed to tell their healthcare provider if they feel dizzy, lightheaded, or faint.\n\nHeart rhythm changes (QT interval prolongation). IGALMI should not be given to patients with an abnormal heart rhythm, a history of an irregular heartbeat, slow heart rate, low potassium, low magnesium, or taking other drugs that could affect heart rhythm. Taking IGALMI with a history of abnormal heart rhythm can increase the risk of torsades de pointes and sudden death. Patients should be instructed to tell their healthcare provider immediately if they feel faint or have heart palpitations.\n\nSleepiness/drowsiness. Patients should not perform activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving or operating hazardous machinery, for at least 8 hours after taking IGALMI.\n\nWithdrawal reactions, tolerance, and decreased response/efficacy. IGALMI was not studied for longer than 24 hours after the first dose. Physical dependence, withdrawal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, agitation), and decreased response to IGALMI may occur if IGALMI is used longer than 24 hours.\n\nThe most common side effects of IGALMI in clinical studies were sleepiness or drowsiness, a prickling or tingling sensation or numbness of the mouth, dizziness, dry mouth, low blood pressure, and low blood pressure upon standing.\n\nThese are not all the possible side effects of IGALMI. Patients should speak with their healthcare provider for medical advice about side effects.\n\nPatients should tell their healthcare provider about their medical history, including if they suffer from any known heart problems, low potassium, low magnesium, low blood pressure, low heart rate, diabetes, high blood pressure, history of fainting, or liver impairment. They should also tell their healthcare provider if they are pregnant or breastfeeding or take any medicines, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Patients should especially tell their healthcare provider if they take any drugs that lower blood pressure, change heart rate, or take anesthetics, sedatives, hypnotics, and opioids.\n\nEveryone is encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800-FDA-1088. You can also contact BioXcel Therapeutics, Inc. at 1-833-201- 1088 or medinfo@bioxceltherapeutics.com.\n\nPlease see full Prescribing Information.\n\nAbout BXCL501\n\nOutside of its approved indication by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as IGALMI™ (dexmedetomidine) sublingual film, BXCL501 is an investigational proprietary, orally dissolving film formulation of dexmedetomidine, a selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist. BXCL501 is under investigation by BioXcel Therapeutics for the acute treatment of agitation associated with Alzheimer’s dementia and for the acute treatment of agitation associated with bipolar I or II disorder or schizophrenia in the at-home setting. The safety and efficacy of BXCL501 for these investigational uses have not been established. BXCL501 has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA for the acute treatment of agitation associated with dementia and Fast Track designation for the acute treatment of agitation associated with schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, and dementia.\n\nAbout BXCL701\n\nBXCL701 is an investigational, oral innate immune activator designed to initiate inflammation in the tumor microenvironment. Approved and experimental immunotherapies often fail to address cancers that appear “cold.” Therefore, BXCL701 is being evaluated to determine if it can render “cold” tumors “hot,” making them more detectable by the adaptive immune system and thereby facilitating the development of a strong anticancer immune response. OnkosXcel Therapeutics’ preclinical data support BXCL701’s potential synergy with both current checkpoint inhibitors and emerging immunotherapies directed to activate T-cells. BXCL701 is a potential therapy for the treatment of aggressive forms of prostate cancer and advanced solid tumors that are refractory or treatment naïve to checkpoint inhibitors. BXCL701 has received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA in four indications: acute myelogenous leukemia, pancreatic cancer, stage IIb to IV melanoma, and soft tissue sarcoma. The FDA designated as a Fast Track development program the investigation of BXCL701 in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor for treatment of patients with metastatic small cell neuroendocrine prostate cancer (SCNC) with progression on chemotherapy and no evidence of microsatellite instability. An 800+-subject clinical database, with data collected by the Company and others, supports the ongoing development of BXCL701.\n\nAbout BioXcel Therapeutics, Inc.\n\nBioXcel Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: BTAI) is a biopharmaceutical company utilizing artificial intelligence to develop transformative medicines in neuroscience. Its wholly owned subsidiary, OnkosXcel Therapeutics, is focused on the development of medicines in immuno-oncology. The Company’s drug re-innovation approach leverages existing approved drugs and/or clinically validated product candidates together with big data and proprietary machine learning algorithms to identify new therapeutic indications.
