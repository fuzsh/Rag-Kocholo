        "text": "Hi,\n\nI am trying to setup arcgis sdk (v100.13) with my existing Qt framework. Below are the details:\n\nQt Creator 6.0.2\n\nBased on Qt 6.2.2 (MSVC 2019, 64 bit)\n\nI have MSVC 2019 installed. But when I try to run an example from the ARCGIS project I get an error saying:\n\n\":-1: error: Project ERROR: untitled17 requires Qt 5.15.2\"\n\nIf i install qt using the online installer. I automatically get Qt 6.0.2. I have no control over that. How can i get the precise Qt 5.15.2 version. Please point out the correct qt installation file or any tutorial that has this covered.\n\nThanks"
