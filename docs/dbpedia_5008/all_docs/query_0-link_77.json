        "text": "My question is, do I need a commercial license for the framework even though I don't want to sell the software and the source code is free for all employees of the corporation?\n\nNo.\n\nAs long as you can comply with the (L)GPL requirements of the Qt libraries, then you do not need to purchase a \"commercial license\" from the Qt Company. Note that the terminology \"commercial license\" is a bit ambiguous, because the (L)GPL license also allows 'commercial' use as long as you can follow the obligations. Namely, the obligation for the LGPL is that you distribute the source code of the LGPL libraries themselves (i.e. the Qt libraries), and also that you allow your users to replace the LGPL libraries with alternative versions.\n\nBasically what this has been interpreted to mean is that if you distribute LGPL libraries (such as Qt) with your application, then you also must:\n\nDistribute to your users the source code of the same version of that library, or make it available in a way that is conformant with the LGPL license.\n\nMake it possible for a user to use a different version of that LGPL library with your application. In practice this means that you must use dynamically linked libraries for the LGPL library (i.e. on Windows, the Qt libraries must be DLLs, and on Linux the libraries for Qt must be .so's).\n\nIn practice it also means that on platforms like iOS and Android, LGPL is not really usable (because these platforms apparently do not allow users to replace the libraries with another version). Basically, the LGPL requires that you document the process for replacing your version of the LGPL library (Qt) with another version that the user may have built herself.\n\nSee: LGPL\n\nNote that some components of the Qt framework may be GPL licensed, and not LGPL. If you don't want to release the source code of your whole application, you must avoid distributing GPL applications in a way that combines it with your application. To be safe it would be best not to distribute the GPL components at all together with your application.\n\nSee also: Can I use an LGPL-licenced library in my commercial app?\n\nNo, you don't need a commercial Qt license if you don't distribute your application.\n\nIf the code you write for this application is owned by your employer and is only provided to your colleagues to assist them in their work duties, then the application is not being distributed according to copyright law. This means that the requirements of the LGPL license don't trigger and you have no obligations to comply with those requirements.\n\nIf the application gets distributed to a different legal entity (this could be within the same corporation, depending on how it is legally organized!), then you either need to comply with the LGPL requirements or you need to buy a commercial license."
