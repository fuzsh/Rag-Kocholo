        "text": "Course Description\n\nQt is a mature cross platform application development framework you can use to develop for Windows, Mac ,Linux, Mobile and Embedded Devices.\n\nThis course will teach you some of the advanced features of the Qt framework. This is not a beginners course. It is a follow up course on our Qt 5 C++ GUI Development for Beginners course, so you should have completed that course or have similar experience from elsewhere.\n\nThe course is packed with lots of tips and tricks, to help you master what it takes to build professional GUI applications using C++ and Qt. The lectures are carefully designed and revolving around demos that are to the point and easy to understand. Cutting down the fat and helping you understand a given topic at hand.\n\nThis course is is not just about theory and simple demos. No !\n\nWe will do theory and simple demos because you need that to understand the basics.\n\nBut we will go even further and not build full fledged practical projects for you to put together and practice all the knowledge in the course. You will build a clone of the Flappy Bird game and a full fledged painting application that supports tons of cool features like drawing with the pen, erasing , re-sizable shapes, copy, cut and paste, drag and drop , undo redo , saving and loading documents and many more features.\n\nHere are some of things you'll get to master in the course :\n\nEvent Programming in Qt\n\nBuilding Custom Widgets\n\nPainting and Drawing with Qt\n\nDrag and Drop in Qt Widgets\n\nAdvanced Features in Qt Model View Programming\n\nGraphics View Framework\n\nCopy, Cut and Paste Features in GUI applications\n\nBuilding Resizable Graphics Items\n\nSaving and Loading Documents in your Qt applications\n\nUndo Redo\n\nBuilding read only and editable tree models from scratch\n\nSupporting multiple languages in your Qt C++ GUI applications\n\nDeploying your Qt applications on Windows, Mac and Linux and way way more...\n\nTowards the end we will build a complete Graphics View based Painting application and a clone of the popular Flappy Bird game for you to put together and use all the knowledge in the course on real projects.\n\nThe course was carefully designed to get you to build projects step by step, making even complex concepts easy to understand. If you're looking to build professional grade Qt C++ GUI applications, then this course will help you get there in the shortest amount of time possible.\n\nQt is the platform of choice for thousands of software projects, both open source and commercial, including the one we passionately we use to record the videos for our courses. If you want to use C++ to build professional grade GUI applications, that can run virtually on any platform out there, Qt is second to none in that regard. Please check out some of the preview videos and let's get you started building professional C++ GUI applications using Qt\n\nEvent Programming\n\nCustom Widgets\n\nPainting and Drawing\n\nDrag and Drop\n\nCopying data through the clipboard\n\nModel View Architecture\n\nGraphics View Framework\n\nImplementing Copy, Cut and Paste Features in Qt Apps\n\nSaving and Loading Documents\n\nUndo Redo in Qt Apps\n\nBuilding Resizable Items in Graphics View\n\nMulti Language Support in Qt Apps\n\nDeploying Qt applications on Windows and Linux and Mac\n\nBuilding Games and Painting Applications with Qt\n\nDevelopers and Researchers and Students willing to build professional grade Qt C++ GUI applications\n\nGet in touch. We're there for you\n\nIf you want to get in touch for any inquiries on the one of our courses , we have somebody always available to answer any of the questions and respond to any need within 24Hrs.
