        "text": "Hey chaps,\n\nI'm a computer science student trying to learn some new techniques in the summer.\n\nDeveloping in xCode how do I make a use of the Qt library?\n\nMy only experience is with Java, using IDE's.\n\nFor example I know that when I needed an external library to download the JAR files and add them to the project and the import the files.\n\nIs it the same within Xcode?\n\nQt5.1 was just released by Digia PLC. It supports OS X 10.8.n. Here is the support matrix including older OS X releases. Older releases of Qt integrated with Xcode 4, and behind the scenes, mapped the Qt framework to use some of the underlying Foundation and Cocoa Frameworks. It expects you to be well-versed in C++, and nearly all of the documentation and examples are written with this expectation. The Qt SDK used to (attempt) to integrate with Xcode, though there is also Qt Creator which is their IDE.\n\nSo, you could conceivably use Xcode and Qt5.1 SDK to build applications that appear to have been written using Objective-C and Cocoa frameworks. The downside is that your application may break with any future release of OS X (or Xcode) and inherent Framework updates that the glacial Qt development cycle may not (if ever) support for months or years. You will unlikely find much comforting support for OS X Qt development in this forum or any other.\n\nDo not confuse my contribution here with encouragement as a good native OS X SDK developer (sticking with MacOS/IOS SDK, Objective-C, and Xcode) will code circles around you and get the support they need, while you will be stuck with Qt compatibility, support, and documentation issues that hinder your progress and delay a marketable application solution.\n\nEtresoft knows what he is talking about. I too would advise against using Qt on OS X."
