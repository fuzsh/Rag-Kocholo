        "text": "Qt Framework\n\nQt is an open-source, cross-platform framework for creating high-performance applications with interactive user interfaces. It is mainly used for developing GUI applications but can also be used for creating non-GUI applications like console tools and servers.\n\nQt provides a wide range of C++ libraries and seamless integration with popular IDEs, making it easier for developers to create feature-rich applications. It offers a comprehensive development environment, including tools for designing, coding, debugging, and profiling applications.\n\nKey Features\n\nCross-platform: Qt can create applications that run on different platforms (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS) without any platform-specific code.\n\nModular Libraries: Qt consists of several modular libraries, including QtCore (core non-GUI functionality), QtGui (GUI-related classes), QtWidgets (GUI widgets), and QtNetwork (networking support).\n\nSignals and Slots: Qt provides a unique mechanism to handle events called “signals and slots”, which allows safe and flexible inter-object communication.\n\nOpenGL Integration: Qt supports rendering 2D and 3D graphics using OpenGL, making it suitable for game development and other graphical applications.\n\nCode Example\n\nHere’s a simple example of a “Hello, World!” application using Qt:\n\n#include <QApplication> #include <QLabel> int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { QApplication app(argc, argv); QLabel label(\"Hello, World!\"); label.show(); return app.exec(); }\n\nIn this example, we include the necessary header files, create QApplication and QLabel objects, display the label with a “Hello, World!” message, and execute the application.\n\nTo compile and run this example, you need to install the Qt library and configure your development environment to use it."
