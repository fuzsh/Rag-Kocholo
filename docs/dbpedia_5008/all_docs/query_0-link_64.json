I just set up a Qt build environment for Windows and MacOS.\n\nHereâ€™s what I ended up doing within the pipeline:\n\nCheck out a submodule containing all the dependencies (including Qt and a Visual Studio installer for Windows)\n\nInstall the dependencies\n\nGenerate the .qt-license with secure environment variables\n\nBuild the app\n\nSign the app\n\nThe toughest bits for me were getting VS2015 to install in the executor (still takes ~20 minutes) and getting signing to work, particularly on MacOS."
