        "text": "What is Qt?\n\nQt framework is a cross-platform framework, written in C++, designed for developing applications for desktop and mobile devices, as well as embedded systems. Qt combines a cross-platform software development application, a graphical user interface (GUI) framework, and a toolkit for developing apps using C++ standards.\n\nThis object-oriented cross-platform framework comes with Qt Creator, an IDE that runs on Linux, Android, Windows, macOS, and other systems. It provides developers with all the functionality required to build cross-platform software.\n\nConsidering the fact that Qt uses C++, it is entirely object-oriented and supports extensible and true component programming. GUIs can be written directly in C++ using its Widgets module, as it comes with Qt Designer — an interactive graphical tool integrated into Qt Creator.\n\nQt QML is a specific declarative language — Qt Meta Language, or Qt Modeling Language. It is used to create cross-platform libraries and applications. Qt QML provides both QML and C++ APIs, which enables app developers to integrate QML code with JavaScript and C++.\n\nThe importance of choosing the right technology\n\nThere’s no ultimate list of all-purpose pros and cons of a technology: what may be a drawback for one project, is a crucial benefit for another. That’s why we have a totality of languages and frameworks to choose from, which is a blessing and a curse.\n\nThere’s no ‘good’ or ‘bad’ framework, as each of them was made for a specific purpose. The technology can be ‘suitable’ or ‘not suitable’. Choosing a framework that is not quite suitable for the project requirements can result in additional costs for re-developing, implementation issues, time losses, etc. The technology choice is kind of crucial here, that’s why we’d like to elaborate on it.\n\nEach programming language has its own structure, methods, and tools, and the software also has its structure, or application logic. Ideally, the basic framework structure should overlap the basic project structure or logic as much as possible. Then we can say that the choice is good. If there are a lot of missing components and inconsistencies, the engineers will need to take additional steps to put everything together.\n\nIn other words, you can choose almost any technology for any project, but if the technology wasn’t meant to be used for projects like yours, you will need more third-party components to complete it. Choosing the suitable technology saves a lot of time and effort, as it has more necessary features out-of-the-box so the engineers can just start building the software right away.\n\nThe reasons to choose Qt as a leading technology should be based on the project goals. The goals are extremely individual so it’s impossible to cover every reason to eventually choose Qt. Instead, we’d like to cover reasons to consider Qt for your project. Let’s go.\n\nReasons for considering Qt as a main technology\n\nTo make an informed decision, you should understand the tasks that the application should perform and then decide if the Qt framework is the best choice or if it’s better to go for an alternative. Let’s start with some general reasons why use Qt.\n\nCross-platform availability and portability\n\nUsing Qt for application development, engineers can build software for various platforms: desktop (Linux, macOS, Windows), mobile (iOS, Android), tvOS, watchOS, Universal Windows Platform, and embedded platforms. There’s no need to rewrite a dedicated code on native technology, which results in faster development and reaching more users with a single app.\n\nVersatility\n\nQt is used for the development of desktop apps, mobile apps, apps for embedded systems, IoT solutions, and more. With Qt software development services, you can choose the direction that corresponds to the project needs most and scale anytime. For instance, you can start with a desktop app and then add mobile or IoT without changing the team.\n\nFull stack of tools\n\nQt has a wide range of development tools, including an interface editor and tools for databases, graphical elements, and more. It means the developers will have more tools out-of-the-box to complete more tasks and add more features with no additional effort.\n\nFlexibility and opportunities\n\nQt allows you to cover many aspects of software, such as\n\nhigh-quality graphic interfaces\n\nmultimedia\n\nnetwork\n\nweb\n\nWebAssembly\n\nIf your project involves some or all of the aspects listed above, Qt is definitely worth considering.\n\nMultiple language interfaces\n\nIf you’re targeting several countries of different languages, don’t underestimate the importance of multilingual interfaces. This requirement is a telltale sign to consider Qt: the framework allows for creating UIs in different languages.\n\nUpdates and support\n\nQt has a huge community so the developers can easily access the documentation and get help solving difficulties. Apart from that, there’s commercial support from The Qt Company which can provide help for hard cases and offer access to exclusive functions by request.\n\nAdvantages of using Qt app development framework\n\nLet’s now talk about the advantages of Qt over native programming and other cross-platform options.\n\nMulti-platform availability\n\nQt app development allows porting an application to multiple target platforms through simple recompilation. It increases development productivity and decreases time to market, making applications future-proof. Qt development saves time, through one source code deployed across all screens and platforms.\n\nSimplified strategy and reduced costs\n\nThanks to ready-to-go tools, development can be faster and easier. Qt offers a wide range of instruments and classes to work with graphics, multimedia, databases, networks, UI elements, etc. making the framework suitable for pretty much any project. Choosing Qt means less of a headache pondering suitable technologies for the project.\n\nC++ included\n\nSince Qt is based on C++, it includes some C++ benefits that make it possible to reuse the code. Using C++ software developers have greater control and can create apps of any scale: from small mobile apps to complex high-performance systems.\n\nPerformance\n\nThe code is compiled to native binaries that run at full speed. It means that there’s no need to use a virtual machine to run the application, like with Java development. The app runs natively, allowing for better performance.\n\nSingle codebase\n\nQt cross-platform software development makes it easy to create intuitive experiences for all users, no matter what system is used. It’s a significant time and resource saver.\n\nStable and reliable framework\n\nQt is used in many industrial applications and solutions, confirming it to be reliable and stable. Furthermore, The Qt Company offers commercial support for highly specialized or hard development tasks. This means the engineers won’t be left to chance once they encounter unusual problems.\n\nUI-oriented\n\nQt offers tools to create various user interfaces, including responsive design, animation, stylization, etc. It may be not 100 percent native-looking, but you’ll be surprised with how flexible a cross-platform framework can be.\n\nDisadvantages of using Qt app development framework\n\nLet’s now talk about difficulties that clients and engineers can encounter while working with Qt.\n\nA more complicated UX\n\nThe user experience of the developed apps is not so smooth. On desktop platforms, it is easier to develop a native user experience because there are more common patterns and widgets. Mobile UX is different and there’s a lack of platform-specific things. With the default components in Qt mobile development, you do not get an ideal look and feel of iOS and Android.\n\nLicensing pitfalls\n\nQt offers LGPL, but it has limitations and requirements that you should satisfy if you are planning to distribute your applications. In some cases, the only acceptable choice is purchasing a commercial license.\n\nSource file size\n\nQt-based applications can have big source file sizes because of the Qt libraries. The source file size can affect the entire application size and load speed.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nTo complete some tasks it may be necessary to address additional resources, language bindings, or commercial support that can elevate the price of the project.\n\nVersion choice\n\nQt is updated regularly. Since you have to consider platform and library compatibility, it can be a tricky task to choose the most optimal Qt version to start developing your application.\n\nExcessive complexity for small projects\n\nSome Qt functions may seem superfluous for projects where simplicity and ease of use are a priority. Arguably a disadvantage, yet it’s good to know to make an informed decision.\n\nConcervativeness\n\nQt is relatively slow in adopting the novelties in the software development area. If you’re a fan of new trends and technologies, it can be quite a challenge to implement these into your project.\n\nQt and C++ for embedded devices\n\nWhy choose C++ and Qt for embedded devices?\n\nC++ sits between hardware and high-level software, allowing developers to access hardware while still making use of higher-level language benefits. Almost every embedded system is required to work for a long time, being stable and reliable, and that’s where C++ is pretty much the best. C++ is built on algorithms and this structure corresponds well to the structure of embedded projects, making a perfect match.\n\nC++ is quite a complicated language, and here’s where Qt comes into play. Since Qt is based on C++, it allows developers to use C++ libraries and benefit from the language’s flexibility. Qt engineers can create embedded systems with user-friendly interfaces, Bluetooth connectivity, internet access, and more. It can be software for a wide range of screen resolutions, infotainment car systems, medical embedded systems, etc.\n\nQt is an excellent choice for both GUI and non-GUI applications. If you need to create a GUI application that can run on multiple platforms, this framework is the optimal choice. Additionally, it enables you to develop high-performance applications more quickly.\n\nCases where Qt may be a good option\n\nKeeping in mind that the choice of technology should be based on the project needs and context, we’ll mention several scenarios where Qt is worth considering. The list is based on our experience.\n\nCross-platform project\n\nQt allows the development of an app that should work on various platforms. Qt allows developers to build apps for various OS from a single code, reducing time and effort for porting the software to each platform.\n\nEmbedded and IoT system with an interface\n\nSay, you need an embedded system with a nice interface. Qt has all the necessary tools to work with hardware and create interfaces for embedded systems like industrial controllers, medical devices, automotive digital systems, and more.\n\nMultimedia and graphics on multiple platforms\n\nQt has a lot of features to work with multimedia projects, making the framework a perfect choice for developing graphical editors, video and audio editing tools, and 2D and 3D graphics apps. Qt offers a rich choice of instruments for projects that require a user-friendly and intuitive graphic interface. Cross-platform availability included.\n\nMobile development 2 in 1\n\nIf you are looking for an optimal way to target all mobile devices, Qt is worth considering. Qt allows developers to build cross-platform mobile apps for Android and iOS, reducing time and effort in comparison to native development.\n\nLimited development time\n\nIf you’re short of time, Qt allows you to speed up the development process due to cross-platform availability and rich choice of ready-to-go tools. You have an all-in-one app for all platforms within a shorter time.\n\nThe existing software is already built with Qt\n\nSay, you already have Qt-based software and want to update or rework it. If you’re happy with the performance of an old app and the team, you may want to continue with Qt for not to lose previous results.\n\nLimited budget\n\nSay, you need an app for several platforms, but you can’t allocate resources for hiring dedicated teams of developers for each target platform. Qt can give you a chance to launch the project and make it successful while staying within the budget."
