        "text": "In the early 1990s, Eirik Chambe-Eng and Haavard Nord created the foundation for Qt as part of their university project. They developed a GUI library that worked across Windows and Linux and later established Trolltech to further develop and commercialize Qt. Qt was unique with its dual licensing model, offering both open-source and commercial versions, which attracted a broad range of users.\n\nQt’s popularity grew, especially after 1996, when German Mathias Ettrich used it to create KDE, a Linux desktop environment. This project helped to highlight Qt’s strengths and opened up new application possibilities.\n\nAfter Trolltech’s success, the company was taken over by Nokia, which planned to integrate Qt into their mobile devices. This period was marked by uncertainty for Qt, as Nokia had only acquired Trolltech to use the technology for their phones, and therefore had no interest in keeping it open-source. Fortunately, in 2012, the development of Qt resumed when Nokia sold the framework to Digia. Under the new name The Qt Company, Qt has seen a resurgence and excels, especially in automotive and embedded systems.\n\nToday, Qt stands as a leading framework in software development, continuing to evolve and stay relevant in the digital age.\n\nThe Qt framework is enriched through a range of add-ons and specialized extensions that expand its functionality and usability in specific application areas. These add-ons enable developers to customize and enhance their applications by integrating specific functionality that suits their unique needs.\n\nAn example is “Boot to Qt,” which allows the use of Linux-based, embedded computers as dedicated Qt devices, effectively eliminating the need to work with separate drivers. This type of add-on demonstrates how Qt can be adapted to work with specific hardware, enabling faster and more efficient development of dedicated devices.\n\nAnother important extension is “Automotive Qt,” which is tailored for the development of embedded systems in the automotive industry. This specialization of Qt highlights its flexibility and ability to be tailored to specific industrial needs. Additionally, “Qt for MCU” (Microcontroller Units) demonstrates Qt’s capabilities in very small, embedded systems, opening up possibilities in miniaturized hardware.\n\nThese add-ons and extensions illustrate Qt’s versatility and its ability to support a wide range of application areas. They are generally designed to be “special purpose” extensions, meaning they are available for those who need them, without overwhelming those who do not.\n\nQt has proven to be a versatile and powerful tool in the world of software development. From its original development as a solution for cross-platform GUI design, to its current status as a preferred tool for a wide range of applications, Qt has proven its durability and relevance.\n\nWith its ability to support development across different platforms, from desktop to embedded systems, and its ongoing development and adaptation to today’s technological needs, Qt stands as a vital resource for software developers.\n\nOur insight highlights Qt’s versatility and strength, not only as a GUI tool but also as a comprehensive framework that supports various aspects of software development, including network communication, database management, and user interface design."
