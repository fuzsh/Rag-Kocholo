Qt is a cross-platform application framework that is widely used for developing application software with a graphical user interface (GUI). It provides various tools and libraries that facilitate the creation of applications for desktop, embedded systems, and mobile platforms. Qt is known for its user-friendly APIs and modular architecture, making it a popular choice among developers looking to write code once and deploy it across multiple operating systems and platforms.

Qt falls under the category of Cross-Platform Mobile Development, offering developers the ability to create mobile applications that can run seamlessly on different operating systems such as iOS, Android, and Windows. With Qt, developers can write code in C++ or QML (Qt Modeling Language) and have it compiled to native code for each platform, ensuring optimal performance and native look and feel.

Founded in 1991 by Haavard Nord and Eirik Chambe-Eng, Qt initially began as a project within a company called Trolltech. The motivation behind Qt's development was to provide developers with a framework that would enable them to create applications that could run on multiple platforms without the need for extensive rewriting of code. Since then, Qt has evolved into a robust and versatile framework that is trusted by developers worldwide.

In terms of market share, Qt has established itself as a dominant player in the cross-platform development space. Its versatility, performance, and ease of use have contributed to its widespread adoption among developers and organizations. With the increasing demand for cross-platform mobile development solutions, Qt is expected to continue its growth trajectory in the future, catering to the evolving needs of the tech industry.
