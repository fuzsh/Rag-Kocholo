Qt Framework Practices for Handling of Security Concerns

The Qt Group prioritizes addressing potential vulnerability threats and security concerns in its products. With its broad cross-platform applicability and extensive API, the Qt framework is susceptible to cyber risks on diverse fronts. Furthermore, Qt is developed as a open source project, requiring vulnerability report analysis by designated staff members and external contributors. Since its inception, the Qt Group actively participates in the relevant steering groups and takes prompt action upon vulnerability reports. Vulnerability reports are governed by specific procedures outlined in the Qt Project Security Policy.
