You can run any of these pictures and\n\nthey’d be dragging and boring, but the minute you put music behind\n\nthem, they have life and vitality they don’t get any other way.\n\n—Walt Disney\n\nSongs written for Disney productions over the decades have become a\n\npotent part of American popular culture. Since most Americans first discov-\n\nered these songs in their youth, they hold a special place in our collective\n\nconsciousness. Yet there have been few serious studies of these beloved\n\nsongs. The purpose of this book is to describe and discuss hundreds of fa-\n\nmous and not-so-famous songs from Disney films, television shows, Broad-\n\nway productions, records, and theme parks, from the 1930s to the present\n\nday. The goal is not only to inform readers about these many songs but also\n\nto rekindle memories readers have associated with them.\n\nWhat is a Disney song? For the purposes of this book, it is any new song\n\nwritten for a Disney product, be it a feature or short film, a Broadway mu-\n\nsical, a television show or special, a made-for-video production, a record,\n\nor a theme park. But a Disney song is also a state of mind, a lyrical and\n\nmusical expression of an idea that harkens back to the simple but potent\n\npremise that first distinguished Walt Disney more than nine decades ago.\n\nWhether it is an animated fairy tale, a live-action adventure, a silly sitcom,\n\nor a Disneyland attraction, a Disney production is distinguished by its fine\n\nvii\n\nviii PREFACE\n\ncraftsmanship, ambitious goals, and generally optimistic view of life. The\n\nsame can be said for most of the songs created for these productions. The\n\nvariety of songs is impressive, from sunny kids’ songs and heartfelt blues\n\nnumbers to rustic folk songs and pulsating rock numbers. Yet there is\n\nsomething positive in the outlook of all these songs. The Disney experience\n\nis basically a hopeful one. The productions affirm life and avoid cynicism\n\nand despair. Even when the Disney artists tackle disturbing issues, such as\n\nracial inequality or the destruction of the environment, the tone is one of\n\nhope. A Disney song, regardless of the many and diverse forms it may take,\n\nis a small musical affirmation of what makes life worth living.\n\nWe have selected 940 songs and given them individual entries presented\n\nin alphabetical order. The songwriters and original singers are identified,\n\nas well as the source (film, television, theatre, theme park, or record) of the\n\nsong and other venues in which it might have been used over the years.\n\nNotable recordings of the song are also listed. But most important, an effort\n\nhas been made to describe each song and explain what makes it memorable.\n\nThe goal is to provide not a reference list but a true encyclopedia of Disney\n\nsongs.\n\nBoth short and feature films are covered, as well as movies made for\n\ntelevision. While the Disney Company also releases films and television\n\nprograms under the banners of Touchstone, Hollywood, and Caravan Pic-\n\ntures, these are only included here if it is felt they are truly in the Disney\n\ntone. Full-length and short video productions are covered, as are all the\n\nBroadway musicals produced by Disney. The company has long been ac-\n\ntive in recordings, starting with Disney Records, and introduced many new\n\nsongs in that venue; a sampling of these are included. Walt Disney was\n\namong the first Hollywood producers to branch out into television. Hun-\n\ndreds of Disney songs have been written and presented on programs such\n\nas The Mickey Mouse Club, Disneyland, Walt Disney’s Wonderful World\n\nof Color, and many shows on the Disney Channel. We have attempted to\n\nprovide a wide and representative selection of these, from the 1950s to the\n\npresent day.\n\nA brief history of Walt Disney’s interest in music is offered to intro-\n\nduce the reader to the special relationship the studio has always had with\n\nsoundtrack scores as well as songs. Following the entries is a listing of al-\n\nternate song titles to help the reader locate songs that are known by differ-\n\nent titles. There is also a directory of all the songwriters mentioned in the\n\nbook, along with lists of the Disney productions that utilize their work. A\n\nguide to recordings, videos, and DVDs and a selected bibliography are also\n\nincluded to help readers find these songs and books dealing with Disney\n\nPREFACE ix\n\nand Disney music. Because song terminology varies in meaning, a glossary\n\nof popular music terms is included to define these terms as they are used\n\nin this book.\n\nFinally, it should be pointed out again that a Disney song in this book is\n\none written for a Disney production and not one that is just interpolated\n\ninto the presentation. Disney has used classical music, Tin Pan Alley stan-\n\ndards, traditional folk songs, and pop songs in its productions. Unless they\n\nwere translated or largely reconfigured for the Disney presentation, they\n\nare not included here.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe would like to express our thanks to Michael and Dottie Sills; Jack, Julie,\n\nand Susannah Carr; Cathy Hischak; Kim Cargen; Amy Johnson; Robbie\n\nRozelle; Ron Mandelbaum at Photofest; Bill Whiting; and the people at\n\nScarecrow Press for their valuable assistance in the preparation of this book.\n\nWe hope they enjoy the results of their efforts, just as we hope this encyclo-\n\npedia will interest and please all lovers of Disney magic.\n\nxi\n\nA BRIEF HISTORY\n\nOF DISNEY MUSIC\n\nA great deal has been written about the evolution of the American musical\n\ntheatre, pinpointing the Rodgers and Hammerstein classic Oklahoma! as\n\nthe first integrated musical in which the music and lyrics augment the plot,\n\nallowing the story to grow and characters to develop through the score.\n\nRichard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein were pioneers in the field of the\n\nstage musical. Oklahoma! opened in 1943, and musical theatre changed\n\nforever. But when did this change happen in Hollywood movie musicals,\n\nand who was instrumental in finding a way to use music to tell the story and\n\ndeepen our understanding of the characters? It seems that one of the great-\n\nest proponents of this evolution of the film musical is Walt Disney.\n\nDisney had a deep respect for the power of music in storytelling and\n\nit is not surprising that some of his initial animated efforts are told pre-\n\ndominantly through song. The studio’s first talkie, the Mickey Mouse short\n\nSteamboat Willie (1928), not only used music as well as sound but made a\n\nconscious effort to coordinate the onscreen movement and sound effects\n\nwith the music on the soundtrack. Such Silly Symphonies as The Pied Piper\n\n(1933) and The Golden Touch (1935) took their cue from the popular oper-\n\netta form by singing through most of the story. In the most successful Silly\n\nSymphony short, The Three Little Pigs (1933), the breakout hit song “Who’s\n\nAfraid of the Big Bad Wolf?” managed to create a satiric and emotional\n\nresonance with listeners, becoming a symbolic laugh in the face of the\n\nGreat Depression. The popularity and sheet music sales of this song did not\n\nxiii\n\nxiv A BRIEF HISTORY OF DISNEY MUSIC\n\ngo unnoticed by Disney, and it is clear that he made very calculated choices\n\nregarding the music in his projects from this point forward.\n\nWhen Disney began preparing for his first feature-length animated film,\n\nhe was chided by many in Hollywood who thought audiences would never\n\nsit and watch a cartoon that was any longer than ten or twelve minutes.\n\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) proved the skeptics wrong, be-\n\ncoming the top grossing film to date. It would hold that record for one year\n\nuntil the monumental run of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer’s Gone with the Wind\n\nabsconded with the title. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a visual mas-\n\nterpiece of storytelling, yet the score by Frank Churchill and Larry Morey\n\nemerged as highly singable to the American public and is perhaps a major\n\nreason the movie held the audience’s interest for eighty-three minutes. The\n\nscore was nominated for an Oscar, and many of the titles—including “Some\n\nDay My Prince Will Come,” “Whistle While You Work,” and “Heigh-Ho”—\n\nbecame radio standards. Disney entered into this project with the idea that\n\nhe wanted the music to be part of the storytelling—not just in an exposi-\n\ntory or narrative way as it had in the Silly Symphonies, but as an emotional\n\noutgrowth and understanding of the characters’ feelings. The film audience\n\nwas to be privy to the internalized monologues of characters, allowing us to\n\nfeel with them instead of merely observing their story.\n\nSnow White changed the way Hollywood viewed the feature-length ani-\n\nmated film, but the road ahead was a rough one. World War II changed\n\nthe international film market, limiting the studio’s potential for distribution\n\nand financial growth. The cost of making animated features was high, and\n\nin the coming years the studio would not turn a profit on many films until\n\ntheir subsequent re-release. However, during this time, Disney Studios\n\nproduced superb and beguiling work. Pinocchio (1940), Dumbo (1941),\n\nand Bambi (1942) offer some of the lushest songs in the Disney canon.\n\nPinocchio’s “When You Wish Upon a Star” brought an Academy Award to\n\nthe songwriting team of Leigh Harline and Ned Washington. The songs\n\n“Baby Mine” from Dumbo and “Love Is a Song” from Bambi were both\n\nnominated for Oscars.\n\nIn the late 1940s Disney had to resort to less expensive projects, such as\n\nthe animated anthologies Make Mine Music (1946), Fun and Fancy Free\n\n(1947), Melody Time (1948), and The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad\n\n(1949). To appeal to the South American market and to replace the loss of\n\nEuropean ticket buyers during World War II, Disney produced the Latin-\n\nflavored Saludos Amigos (1942) and The Three Caballeros (1944). These,\n\nas well as two traditional films, Song of the South (1946) and So Dear to\n\nMy Heart (1948), employed a clever mixture of live action and animation.\n\nA BRIEF HISTORY OF DISNEY MUSIC xv\n\nSong of the South also garnered the studio its second Oscar for best song\n\nwith “Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah.” In all of these cases, music played a major role\n\nin the storytelling.\n\nAs the financially fraught 1940s ended, the studio needed a hit and it\n\nfound one in Cinderella (1950) by returning to the formula that was suc-\n\ncessful in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: a maiden in distress, a hand-\n\nsome prince, a wicked stepmother as a villain, and help from enthusiastic\n\nanimal friends. The movie hit pay dirt. More importantly, it marked a\n\nreturn to the style of storytelling that used a musical score, in this case by\n\nMack David, Jerry Livingston, and Al Hoffman. Disney hired these Tin\n\nPan Alley composers to create his first musical score that was more in step\n\nwith those of the modern musical theatre. The result was a hit score that\n\nincluded “A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes,” “The Work Song,” and\n\nthe Oscar-nominated “Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo.” Cinderella marked the first\n\ntime Walt Disney took control of the recording and distribution of a film’s\n\nmusic; thus Disney Records was born and a long tradition of bringing music\n\nand storytelling to families began.\n\nThe 1950s saw the rise of television as a new venue for Disney Studios,\n\nand music was a regular requirement of this emerging art form. Disney be-\n\ngan hosting his own program, entitled Disneyland, which debuted in 1954.\n\nThe following year, The Mickey Mouse Club made its debut. From these\n\ntwo popular shows, legions of new songs were introduced to the American\n\npublic, especially within The Mickey Mouse Club’s variety show format.\n\nTelevision proved to be a potent place for Disney to exercise his ideas for\n\nfamily entertainment. The studio has upheld this tradition over the years,\n\nand in the 1980s it spawned its own network in the form of the Disney\n\nChannel. More TV shows meant more theme songs, so there are literally\n\nhundreds of Disney songs ingrained in our collective psyche through the\n\navailability and affordability of television entertainment.\n\nIn 1955 the Disneyland theme park opened in Anaheim, California, and\n\nwith it came dozens of Disney attractions, shows, and parades full of origi-\n\nnal songs. Later, other Disney parks would spring up in Florida, France,\n\nJapan, and China, each utilizing the ever-growing list of popular Disney\n\nmusical numbers, including “It’s a Small World,” “Grim Grinning Ghosts,”\n\nand “There’s a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow.” Walt Disney World in\n\nFlorida is currently the most-visited attraction in the world, with millions\n\nof patrons passing through the gates each year, all of them entertained by\n\ndelightful Disney music.\n\nThe 1960s found Disney stretching himself with new musical storytelling\n\nideas, experimenting with new forms of music, and perhaps finding the apex\n\nxvi A BRIEF HISTORY OF DISNEY MUSIC\n\nof his artistic vision with Mary Poppins (1964), a mixture of live action and\n\nanimation that is the studio at its finest. The production values, special ef-\n\nfects, and casting are near perfection, and the score by Richard and Robert\n\nSherman is quite possibly the most evocative, colorful and at times haunting\n\none to be written for a Disney film. A highlight, “Chim Chim Cher-ee,” won\n\nan Academy Award for Best Song, but it was the wistful “Feed the Birds”\n\nthat would be Walt Disney’s favorite song to come from any of his films. The\n\nJungle Book (1967) was the last animated film directly supervised by Disney,\n\nand the music has a succinctly new flavor for a Disney film. The score has\n\na jazz and blues sound, quite unlike any of the previous scores written for\n\nanimated features. The song “The Bare Necessities” was nominated for an\n\nOscar. Disney never got to hear or see the final product before he passed\n\naway in 1966, but his vision for both art and music would live long beyond\n\nhis lifetime.\n\nAfter Disney’s death, the studio seemed to lose heart for a while. The\n\nmovie products turned out during the time from 1967 to the mid-1970s\n\nrange from uninspired to mildly entertaining, frequently missing Walt\n\nDisney’s magical touch. It is not until the studio regrouped in the late 1980s\n\nthat the magic seemed to return through the music of the composing team\n\nof Alan Menken and Howard Ashman. The Little Mermaid (1989) was so\n\nwell received that Disney Studios emerged once again as the top producer\n\nof family entertainment and, for our purposes, songs. Two songs from The\n\nLittle Mermaid were nominated for Oscars, with “Under the Sea” bring-\n\ning home the prize. Menken and Ashman’s next endeavor, Beauty and the\n\nBeast (1991), produced three Oscar-nominated songs with the title tune\n\nfetching the statue. Beauty and the Beast also holds the distinction of being\n\nthe only animated film to be nominated for Best Picture. Sadly, Howard\n\nAshman passed away from AIDS while working on his next animated fea-\n\nture, Aladdin (1992), but his efforts at the Disney studio opened the door\n\nfor many musicals to come. The Lion King (1994), Pocahontas (1995), The\n\nHunchback of Notre Dame (1996), and Tarzan (1999) proved that the Dis-\n\nney movie musical was alive and well.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Disney branched into two new areas of entertainment:\n\nthe Broadway musical and direct-to-home-video markets. As its maiden\n\nvoyage, Disney Theatrical Productions produced a stage adaptation of its\n\nhit animated film Beauty and the Beast in 1994. Composer Alan Menken\n\nreturned to the project and teamed with lyricist Tim Rice to create several\n\nnew songs to flesh out the existing score from the original feature. Although\n\nit was not critically well received, the piece was an audience favorite and ran\n\nfor thirteen years, paving the way for other Disney musicals on Broadway,\n\nA BRIEF HISTORY OF DISNEY MUSIC xvii\n\nincluding the critically acclaimed The Lion King (1997), the original musi-\n\ncal Aida (2000), Tarzan (2006), Mary Poppins (2006), and The Little Mer-\n\nmaid (2008). The critics have been reticent to embrace Disney as an artistic\n\npresence on Broadway, but the audiences have had their say, flocking to the\n\nfamily-friendly entertainments in droves. Each of these productions carried\n\nwith it new songs, creating a fully realized theatrical score.\n\nWith the advent of home video and DVDs, Disney cornered another\n\nmarket of family entertainment. Originally creating direct-to-video sequels\n\nto beloved classics and then imagining original works for this medium, the\n\ncompany has introduced a barrage of new songs into the lexicon of popu-\n\nlar music. Video and DVD sales of both classic and new films have made\n\nDisney entertainment accessible to myriad households and families around\n\nthe world. The music heard in these productions has become a part of our\n\neveryday culture. The overwhelming success and evolution of the Disney\n\nsong experience has become available to every man, woman, and child. To\n\nhave the Disney experience is to have a musical one.\n\nA\n\n“Absalom, My Absalom” is the stinging song of regret and loss from the\n\nbiblical concert King David (1997) which was presented on Broadway to\n\nopen Disney’s newly restored New Amsterdam Theatre. When Absalom\n\n(Anthony Galde), the son of King David (Marcus Lovett), enacts a revolt\n\nagainst his father’s army, he is killed in the conflict. David mourns for his\n\nson despite their estrangement and pours out his emotion in this song,\n\nsung over the body of Absalom. The number starts out gentle and somber,\n\nthen builds to a volcanic eruption of anger, pain, and regret. Alan Menken\n\ncomposed the distraught melody and Tim Rice provided the tumultuous\n\nlyrics.\n\n“Adventure Is a Wonderful Thing” is the rousing, parade-like song\n\nwritten by Michael Abbott and Sarah Weeks for the made-for-video film\n\nPooh’s Grand Adventure: The Search for Christopher Robin (1997). When\n\nWinnie the Pooh and his friends decide they must go on an expedition to\n\nsave Christopher Robin, Owl (voice of Andre Stojka) creates a map and\n\nsings this patriotic-sounding song of encouragement, praising the glories\n\nof adventure even if it includes quicksand and fearsome creatures. As Owl\n\ndescribes the types of adventures the group will have, the characters are\n\nseen on a three-dimensional version of the map as they meet with different\n\nkinds of dangers.\n\n1\n\n2 “ A D V E N T U R E S I N W O NCDHEARPLTAENRD #”\n\n“Adventures in Wonderland” is th1e electronic-sounding, disco-flavored\n\ntheme song for the live-action television series Disney’s Adventures in\n\nWonderland (1992) about a contemporary Alice who enters a magical other\n\nworld. The vibrating song is sung by Sarah Taylor over the opening se-\n\nquence in which Alice (Elisabeth Harnois) floats across a surreal landscape\n\nand meets characters from the Lewis Carroll books.\n\n“A-E-I-O-U” is the musical mantra of the mysterious Caterpillar (voice of\n\nRichard Haydn) in the animated film fantasy Alice in Wonderland (1951).\n\nOliver Wallace wrote the short and exotic song, which the Caterpillar sings\n\nas he blows smoke from his hookah in the form of the vowels he chants. The\n\nnumber is sometimes listed as “The Caterpillar Song.”\n\n“After Today” is the slightly rocking song in which various teenagers look\n\nforward to summer vacation in the animated film A Goofy Movie (1995).\n\nTom Snow (music) and Jack Feldman (lyric) wrote the rhythmic number\n\nand it is sung by high-schooler Max (singing voice of Aaron Lohr) who vows\n\nto no longer be such a goof and to win the heart of the pretty coed Roxanne.\n\nStudents on the bus, the sports field, and in school join in singing the catchy\n\nsong as they make their own plans for the day after school lets out.\n\n“The Age of Not Believing” is the Oscar-nominated ballad about the loss\n\nof a child’s innocence that Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman wrote for the\n\nmusical film fantasy Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971). The friendly witch\n\nMiss Eglantine Price (Angela Lansbury) and her youthful evacuees Carrie\n\n(Cindy O’Callaghan) and Paul (Roy Snart) prepare a magic flying bed for\n\ntravel, but the eldest youth, Charlie (Ian Weighill), who is eleven going on\n\ntwelve years old, doubts her powers of sorcery. So Miss Price sings of the\n\nage when a child starts to question everything and make-believe is coming\n\nto an end. The music from the song is used throughout the movie every\n\ntime the magical bed travels. Christine Ebersole made a distinctive record-\n\ning of the bittersweet ballad in 2003.\n\n“A La Nanita Nana” is a traditional Spanish folk song that was adapted and\n\narranged by David Lawrence for the television musical sequel The Cheetah\n\nGirls 2 (2006). At a restaurant in Barcelona, the American singing stars Gal-\n\nleria (Raven-Symoné), Chanel (Adrienne Bailon), Aqua (Kiely Williams), and\n\nDorinda (Sabrina Bryan) listen to a guitarist play the gentle and flowing lul-\n\nlaby and they sing it in Spanish from their tables with the singer Belinda.\n\n“ALL THE CATS JOIN IN” 3\n\n“Alice in Wonderland” is the dreamy title number sung by a chorus on\n\nthe soundtrack at the beginning and end of the 1951 animated film fan-\n\ntasy. Sammy Fain composed the warm music and Bob Hilliard wrote the\n\nchorale-like lyric, which lists the virtues of Wonderland and all the things\n\nAlice will find there. Rosemary Clooney made an effective recording of\n\nthe ballad combined with “The Unbirthday Song” from the same film, and\n\nyears later Michael Feinstein included it in a medley of songs he recorded\n\nfrom the movie.\n\n“All for Love” is the rock ballad from the adventure film The Three Mus-\n\nketeers (1993) that celebrates the dedication and valor of the three heroes,\n\nparticularly their devotion to true love. Bryan Adams, Robert John Lange,\n\nand Michael Kamen wrote the number, which is a variation on the muske-\n\nteer trio’s watch cry “All for one and one for all.” It is sung by Adams, Sting,\n\nand Rod Stewart on the soundtrack over the closing credits of the movie.\n\n“All for One” is the feel-good finale for the television movie High School\n\nMusical 2 (2007), a song of togetherness written by Matthew Gerrard\n\nand Robbie Nevil. Teenagers Troy (Zac Efron), Gabriella (Vanessa Anne\n\nHudgens), Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale), Ryan (Lucas Grabeel), Chad (Corbin\n\nBleu), Taylor (Monique Coleman), and others who have worked at the\n\ncountry club for the summer gather together around the pool and have one\n\nlast celebration of their fun in the sun by singing the spirited pop song.\n\n“All in a Golden Afternoon” is the operetta-like choral number that vari-\n\nous flowers sing in the animated movie Alice in Wonderland (1951). Sammy\n\nFain (music) and Bob Hilliard (lyric) wrote the lyrical number in which the\n\nvarious flora celebrate their beauty in front of Alice, who they think is also a\n\nflower. Barbara Hendricks and the Abbey Road Ensemble made a pleasing\n\nrecording of the song.\n\n“All the Cats Join In” is a visually and musically swinging sequence\n\nfrom the animated anthology film Make Mine Music (1946). Alec Wilder,\n\nRay Gilbert, and Eddie Sauter wrote the vivacious bebop music and it is\n\nperformed by clarinetist Benny Goodman and his orchestra while bobby-\n\nsoxers from all over town drop what they are doing and rush down to the\n\nmalt shop, where they engage in furious dancing. The ingenious animation\n\nkeeps pace with the music, the animator’s pencil furiously drawing objects\n\nas quickly as they are needed to tell the story.\n\n4 “ALWAYS”\n\n“Always” is the Polynesian narrative ballad written by Jeanine Tesori (mu-\n\nsic) and Alexa Junge (lyric) for the video sequel Lilo and Stitch 2: Stitch Has\n\na Glitch (2005). The Hawaiian girl Lilo (voice of Dakota Fanning) searches\n\nall over the island for a song to use in a hula competition and discovers this\n\nmelodic piece about the beauty of love. The number tells the mythologi-\n\ncal tale of the Hawaiian goddess Hi’iaka, who is the patron of the island.\n\nHi’iaka falls in love with a young native chief named Lahaiu and sacrifices\n\nmany things for his safety.\n\n“Always Know Where You Are” is the pulsating rock song written by\n\nJohn Rzeznik for the animated adventure film Treasure Planet (2002), a\n\nspace-age version of Robert Louis Stevenson’s Treasure Island. Rzeznik\n\nsings the driving number on the soundtrack, revealing the thoughts of Jim\n\nHawkins. The song is a musical vow to never forget a friend, referring to the\n\ncyborg cook John Silver, who has taken the young Jim under his care.\n\n“Always There” is the heartwarming song about family written by Melissa\n\nManchester and Norman Gimbel for the animated video sequel Lady and\n\nthe Tramp II: Scamp’s Adventure (2001). Having run away from home,\n\nthe young canine Scamp (singing voice of Roger Bart) mourns the loss of\n\nhis home and family, while the stray dog Angel (Susan Egan) longs for the\n\nfamily she never had. Back at home, Lady (Jodi Benson) and Tramp (Jeff\n\nBennett) sing about how much they miss and worry about Scamp, the four\n\nvoices combining in a gentle and moving quartet.\n\n“American Dragon” is the hard-rock number by Perry LaMarca that\n\nserves as the theme song for the second and succeeding seasons of the\n\nanimated adventure series American Dragon: Jake Long (2005). It replaced\n\n“The Chosen One,” the series’ original theme song. The Jonas Brothers sing\n\nthe repetitive song about the Asian American Jake, who can transform him-\n\nself into a tough, swift, and fearless dragon who defends the city from evil.\n\nThe Jonas Brothers also made a music video of the number in 2006.\n\n“Amigas Cheetahs” is the disco-flavored rock song by Will Robinson\n\nand Jamie Houston that is sung by the American teens Galleria (Raven-\n\nSymoné), Chanel (Adrienne Bailon), Aqua (Kiely Williams), and Dorinda\n\n(Sabrina Bryan) when they are in Barcelona in the TV movie sequel The\n\nCheetah Girls 2 (2006). During a concert in the Spanish city, the four sing-\n\ning stars sing about how they are friends to everyone in Barcelona and how\n\nthey have embraced the city during their stay.\n\n“ANOTHER PART OF ME” 5\n\n“Anastasia’s Theme” is the tender song of longing written by Alan Zach-\n\nary and Michael Weiner for the animated video sequel Cinderella III: A\n\nTwist in Time (2007). The Evil Stepmother has used magic to erase the\n\nprince’s memory of Cinderella and arranges a marriage between him and\n\nher daughter Anastasia (singing voice of Lesli Margherita). Although Anas-\n\ntasia sees her dream coming true, she questions in this reflective number\n\nthe validity of a love forced by magic and wishes the prince loved her for\n\nherself.\n\n“And Now to Sleep” is the soothing lullaby written by George Bruns\n\n(music) and Winston Hibler (lyric) for the nature film Perri (1957) about\n\na female squirrel and her first year of life in the forest. An unidentified\n\nfemale singer on the soundtrack sings the number, which comforts a young\n\none and encourages sleep. Nature footage of mother and baby animals\n\nsnuggling together in the night accompanies the song, which is also titled\n\n“Lullaby of the Wildwood.”\n\n“And Son” is the Italian-flavored duet, complete with concertina accom-\n\npaniment, that Stephen Schwartz wrote for the television musical Geppetto\n\n(2000) which looks at the Pinocchio tale from the toymaker’s point of view.\n\nAfter the Blue Fairy brings the puppet Pinocchio (Seth Adkins) to life, the\n\nproud Geppetto (Drew Carey) takes his new “son” through the village,\n\nproclaiming him perfect and their relationship ideal. Yet their optimism is\n\ndamped by Pinocchio’s naive actions, which indicate that not all is perfect.\n\n“Another Believer” is the hopeful song by Rufus Wainwright (music and\n\nlyric) and Marius De Vries (music) from the animated film Meet the Rob-\n\ninsons (2007). While Lewis works on a time machine to take him back to\n\nhis birth year, where he hopes to convince his birth mother not to abandon\n\nhim, Wainwright sings this wistful number about believing that the future\n\nwill bring a better life.\n\n“Another Part of Me” is the climactic celebration number written and\n\nperformed by Michael Jackson in the 3-D movie Captain EO at the Journey\n\ninto Imagination attraction at Epcot in 1986. Having conquered the evil\n\ntyrant Supreme Leader (Anjelica Huston), Captain EO (Jackson) sings of\n\none’s interconnectedness as a member of a shared world and the number\n\nexplodes into the final dance segment of the seventeen-minute film. Jack-\n\nson recorded the song for his 1987 album Bad. The Captain EO film was\n\nalso seen at Disneyland in California and at Disneyland Resort Paris.\n\n6 “ANOTHER PYRAMID”\n\n“Another Pyramid” is a song of exposition by Elton John (music) and Tim\n\nRice (lyric) for the Broadway musical Aida (2000). The Egyptian prime\n\nminister Zoser (John Hickok) welcomes his son Radames (Adam Pascal)\n\nback from the war with Nubia and informs him that the pharaoh is near\n\ndeath, his pyramid tomb is nearly completed, and it is time for Radames to\n\nwed the dying king’s daughter Amneris. Other ministers of the court join\n\nZoser in urging Radames to make Egypt greater by building more and more\n\npyramids. The song was recorded by Sting before the musical opened on\n\nBroadway.\n\n“Any Fool Can See” is a riveting song of transformation written by Marvin\n\nHamlisch (music) and Allee Willis (lyric) for the modern movie fantasy The\n\nDevil and Max Devlin (1981). Shy Stella Summers (Julie Budd) wants to\n\nbe a singing star but lacks confidence until the devil’s assistant Max (Elliott\n\nGould) uses his magic on her. She starts out singing the number as a mousy\n\nno-talent, but during the song Stella grows in power and explodes with pas-\n\nsion, becoming a belting superstar by the end.\n\n“Anything Can Happen (If You Let It)” is the optimistic song of self-\n\nfulfillment written by George Stiles and Anthony Drewe for the 2004 Lon-\n\ndon stage version of Mary Poppins. Nanny Mary Poppins (Laura Michelle\n\nKelly) sings the up-tempo number to the Banks household near the end\n\nof the show, arguing that your dreams will come true only if you believe\n\nin yourself and set out to win. Soon the family and the servants join in on\n\nthe cheery song, and the entire cast reprises it at the end of the musical.\n\nAshley Brown played Mary in the 2006 Broadway version and led the cast\n\nin singing the song.\n\n“Anything Can Happen Day” is the zesty theme song used for Wednes-\n\ndays on the television series The Mickey Mouse Club (1955). The Mouseke-\n\nteers announce in song that Wednesday is a day for surprises and that there\n\nwill be unexpected thrills on that day’s show. The bouncy number then\n\nleads into a roll call in which each Mouseketeer is called by name and en-\n\nters dressed as a particular kind of person (ballerina, fireman, and so on) or\n\nan animal. Adult Mouseketeer host Jimmie Dodd wrote the happy number\n\nand usually led the cast in singing it.\n\n“Anytime You Need a Friend” is the pop ballad about devotion to a\n\nfriend sung by the Beu Sisters over the final credits of the animated movie\n\nHome on the Range (2004). Alan Menken (music) and Glenn Slater (lyric)\n\n“ARE WE DANCING?” 7\n\nwrote the rockabilly number, which is one of two songs heard during the\n\nfinal credits. The other is “Wherever the Trail May Lead.”\n\n“The Apple Dumpling Gang” is the hootin’ and hollerin’ western-style\n\ntitle song written by Shane Tatum for the 1975 movie comedy about three\n\norphans who go out West and get involved with a pair of bumbling crooks.\n\nThe feisty campfire song, complete with “yeehaws,” tells the story of the\n\nyoung trio and is sung by Randy Sparks and the Back Porch Majority over\n\nthe opening credits of the film. The melody is also heard in the sequel The\n\nApple Dumpling Gang Rides Again (1979).\n\n“The Apple Song” is a merry list song written by Kim Gannon and Walter\n\nKent for the “Johnny Appleseed” section of the animated movie anthology\n\nMelody Time (1948). Young Johnny Appleseed (voice of Dennis Day) is\n\npersuaded to go out West and plant apple trees by his guardian angel (also\n\nvoiced by Day), who lists all the uses for apples and how the growing coun-\n\ntry is waiting for him to bring the fruit trees to the new land.\n\n“Appreciate the Lady” is the bluesy ballad written by Jim Stafford for the\n\nanimated film The Fox and the Hound (1981). The wise old owl Big Mama\n\n(voice of Pearl Bailey) sings the smooth number to the fox Tod (Mickey\n\nRooney) about how to woo the pretty vixen Vixey (Sandy Duncan).\n\n“Arabian Nights” is the exotic opening number written by Alan Men-\n\nken (music) and Howard Ashman (lyric) for the animated movie Aladdin\n\n(1992). A Middle Eastern merchant, voiced by Robin Williams, introduces\n\nthe film, but Bruce Adler provides the singing voice as the sly salesman\n\ncroons about the enchanted land of many stories. Because some moviego-\n\ners took offense at Ashman’s lyric about the barbaric tendency to cut off\n\none’s nose if they didn’t like your face, the lyric was changed to references\n\nabout the flat terrain and the intense heat when the movie was released on\n\nvideo. The number serves as the theme song for the animated television\n\nseries Aladdin (1994) and is reprised by Adler in the animated video sequel\n\nAladdin and the King of Thieves (1995).\n\n“Are We Dancing?” is the waltzing love song for the Philadelphian\n\nCordelia Biddle (Lesley Ann Warren) and the New Yorker Angie Duke\n\n(John Davidson) in the movie musical The Happiest Millionaire (1967). The\n\ntwo lovers first meet at a party in New Jersey and dance out onto the ter-\n\nrace to sing this entrancing number appropriate for the 1916 period of the\n\n8 “ARE YOU IN OR OUT?”\n\nfilm. Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman wrote the flowing music and the\n\nromantic lyric, which takes the form of a series of questions. Tami Tappan\n\nand David Burnham made a playful duet recording of the song in 2003.\n\n“Are You In or Out?” is the jazzy, upbeat number about a sinister con-\n\nspiracy from the animated video sequel Aladdin and the King of Thieves\n\n(1995). Randy Petersen and Kevin Quinn wrote the arresting number,\n\nwhich is sung by the thief Sa’luk (voice of Jerry Orbach) as he tries to con-\n\nvince some of his fellow outlaws to overtake Aladdin’s father Cassim and\n\nmake Sa’luk the king of the Forty Thieves. Among the voices featured as the\n\nfellow thieves are those of Jeff Bennett, Guy Stroman, Scott Barnes, Paul\n\nKandel, Gordon Stanley, David Friedman, Merwin Foard, Rob Paulsen,\n\nJess Harnell, and Clyde Kusatu.\n\n“The Aristocats” is the Gallic-sounding title song by Richard M. and\n\nRobert B. Sherman for the 1970 animated film, sung on the soundtrack\n\nby Maurice Chevalier, the last time the beloved French entertainer was\n\nheard in a movie musical. Chevalier came out of retirement to sing (in\n\nEnglish and French) over the opening credits. The number has the style of\n\na French café song as it describes the upper-class felines of Paris.\n\n“As Long as I’m Here with You” is the gentle ballad about friendship\n\nwritten by Mark Watters (music) and Lorraine Feather (lyric) for the made-\n\nfor-video film Pooh’s Heffalump Halloween Movie (2005). During the final\n\ncredits of the film, Joseph Lawrence sings on the soundtrack the folk ballad\n\nabout braving all of life’s difficulties as long as one’s friend is near.\n\n“As Long as There’s Christmas” is the seasonal song of hope written\n\nby Rachel Portman (music) and Don Black (lyric) for the made-for-video\n\nanimated musical Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas (1997).\n\nAlthough Belle (voice of Paige O’Hara) is trapped in the Beast’s castle, she\n\nbelieves there is still hope for a merry Christmas as she sings this flowing\n\nballad with Mrs. Potts (Angela Lansbury), Cogsworth (David Ogden Stiers),\n\nLumière (Jerry Orbach), and the other enchanted objects. Later in the film,\n\nwhen the Beast casts Belle into the dungeon for trying to celebrate Christ-\n\nmas, the song is reprised by Belle and the French tree ornament Angelique\n\n(Bernadette Peters). During the final credits, a duet version of the song is\n\nsung on the soundtrack by Roberta Flack and Peabo Bryson.\n\n“ATHENA’S SONG” 9\n\n“At the Ball” is the clever song of exposition by Alan Zachary and Michael\n\nWeiner in which two mice reenact the tale of Cinderella in the animated\n\nvideo sequel Cinderella III: A Twist in Time (2007). A spell has caused the\n\nprince to lose all memory of Cinderella, so her rodent friends Gus (Corey\n\nBurton) and Jaq (Rob Paulsen) act out in song and dance how the prince\n\nfirst met Cinderella at the ball, using a wind-up music box with a ballet\n\ndancer on it to play the role of Cinderella.\n\n“Athena’s Song” is the pleasing lullaby written by Jeanine Tesori for the\n\nanimated made-for-video prequel The Little Mermaid: Ariel’s Beginning\n\n(2008). The mermaid queen Athena (singing voice of Andrea Robinson)\n\nsings the gentle ballad about love and happiness under an endless sky to her\n\ndaughters at bedtime. The melody is put into a magical music box King Tri-\n\nton gives to his wife, and the song is heard throughout the movie whenever\n\nthe music box is opened. The song is also listed as “Endless Sky.”\n\nB\n\n“Babes in the Woods” is the operatic title song for the 1932 Silly Sym-\n\nphony film short loosely based on Hansel and Gretel. Bert Lewis wrote the\n\nnumber, which is sung by an uncredited voice on the soundtrack, telling\n\nhow two Dutch children are captured by an evil witch and almost added to\n\nher collection of humans turned into spiders and rats, but are rescued by a\n\nband of forest elves.\n\n“Baby Mine” is the heartbreaking lullaby ballad written by Frank Churchill\n\n(music) and Ned Washington (lyric) for the animated circus tale Dumbo\n\n(1941). Betty Noyes sings the number on the soundtrack as young Dumbo\n\nis comforted by his mother, who is locked up as dangerous and can touch\n\nhim only with her outstretched trunk. Les Brown (vocal by Betty Bonney)\n\nand Jane Froman both had popular records of the Oscar-nominated song\n\nand years later Barbara Cook, Ashley Brown, Kerry Butler, Steve Tyrell,\n\nPaige Morehead, Michael Crawford, and Bette Midler each made a heart-\n\nfelt recording of the lullaby.\n\n“Back in Business” is a bouncy pastiche number written by Stephen Sond-\n\nheim in the 1930s Depression-be-damned style for the film Dick Tracy\n\n(1990), where it was sung by a line of nightclub chorines during a mon-\n\ntage showing Big Boy Caprice’s illegal enterprises booming. Sondheim’s\n\nenergetic melody and dancing lyric are somewhat lost in the busy editing,\n\n10\n\n“THE BALLAD OF DAVY CROCKETT” 11\n\nbut the song has resurfaced on several occasions. Julie Andrews, Stephen\n\nCollins, Christopher Durang, Michael Rupert, and Rachel York sang it in\n\nthe Off-Broadway revue Putting It Together (1993); Liza Minnelli and Billy\n\nStritch sang and recorded the number in the 1992 Sondheim: A Celebration\n\nat Carnegie Hall; and Alet Oury made a complete recording (verse and re-\n\nfrains) with Julie Alderfer, Farah Alvin, Heidi Godt, Kelli Shrewsbury, and\n\nGretchen Weiss in 1997. Madonna, who was in Dick Tracy but didn’t sing\n\nthe number, later recorded it.\n\n“Baia” is the enticing ballad about the Brazilian resort city that is used so\n\neffectively in the animated travelogue The Three Caballeros (1944). Ary\n\nBarroso (music) and Ray Gilbert (lyric) wrote the Portuguese song, which\n\nis sung by the parrot Joe Carioca (singing voice of Nestor Amoral) as the\n\nport city is seen silhouetted in the red sunset.\n\n“The Ballad of Bullwhip Griffin” is a mock-heroic song about the brave\n\nand legendary Eric Griffin (Roddy McDowall), who is really a very stuffy\n\nBoston butler with a great deal of luck out West in the film The Adventures\n\nof Bullwhip Griffin (1967). George Bruns and Mel Leven wrote the tongue-\n\nin-cheek ballad, which is heard over the opening credits and throughout the\n\nfilm as a running wry commentary on Griffin’s misadventures.\n\n“The Ballad of Davy Crockett” was one of the few chart hits to come out\n\nof television in the 1950s. The song was written by George Bruns (music)\n\nand Tom W. Blackburn (lyric) for the popular adventure miniseries Davy\n\nCrockett (1954) featured on the weekly Disneyland show, and soon every-\n\none was singing it and buying imitation raccoon skin hats. The number is a\n\nnarrative ballad that relates the history of Crockett with more legend than\n\nfact, such as his killing a bear when he was only a young child. Fess Parker,\n\nwho played Davy, sang the song over the credits of the television show,\n\nthen reprised his performance as Crockett and sang it in the feature films\n\nDavy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier (1955) and Davy Crockett and the\n\nRiver Pirates (1956). New lyrics were written for the two feature films, and\n\nthe song, performed by a male chorus on the soundtrack, is used as a narra-\n\ntive link for the different episodes. Parker, Bill Hayes, and Tennessee Ernie\n\nFord each recorded the song, and each version sold more than a million\n\ndiscs. By the end of the decade twenty-three different recordings had been\n\nmade, selling more than 10 million copies. There was even a jazz version of\n\nthe song recorded by Louis Armstrong. Surprisingly, this all-American tune\n\nwas an international best seller as well. There were records made in several\n\n12 “THE BALLAD OF SMITH AND GABRIEL JIMMYBOY”\n\ncountries, including more than twenty different versions in France, and it\n\nwas the top-selling song in Japan for a while. Billy Cotton, the Cliff Adams\n\nSingers, Eddie Fisher, the Wellingtons, Eddy Arnold, the Kentucky Head-\n\nhunters, the Four Mosquitos, and Mannheim Steamroller were among the\n\nothers who recorded the ballad in the States. Disney legend has it that\n\nBruns and Blackburn quickly wrote the song at the last minute because the\n\nepisode was running short and they needed something to make the show fit\n\ninto the television time spot.\n\n“The Ballad of Smith and Gabriel Jimmyboy” is the folk ballad written\n\nby Bob Russell for the movie Smith! (1969), about a western rancher who\n\ndefends a Native American youth. Songwriter Russell sings the narrative\n\nnumber over the opening credits of the film, telling the tale of the Indian\n\nboy Gabriel Jimmyboy, who is falsely accused of murder, and the cattleman\n\nSmith, who comes to his defense. The seemingly genial song has a dark\n\nundercurrent of foreboding in the music, which foreshadows the disturbing\n\nevents of the movie.\n\n“The Bare Necessities” is the Oscar-nominated song of low-down, low-\n\nkey philosophy by Terry Gilkyson that was featured in the animated movie\n\nThe Jungle Book (1967). Baloo the Bear (voice of Phil Harris) sings to the\n\nman-cub Mowgli (Bruce Reitherman) about taking the easy road in life and\n\nlooking for creature comforts as the two friends cavort through the Indian\n\njungle. The lively number is in the form of a Dixieland jazz tune and is\n\nfilled with opportunities for vocal and instrumental improvisation. Harris’s\n\nrecording enjoyed some popularity, as did one by Louis Armstrong, and\n\nyears later there were notable records by Harry Connick Jr. in 1995, the\n\nJazz Networks in 1996, Bowling for Soup in 2005, Steve Tyrell in 2006, and\n\nKerry Butler in 2008. A bluegrass rendition of the song was recorded by\n\nMike Toppins, Glen Duncan, Billy Troy, Jim Brown, James Freeze, and\n\nDavid Chase. The song is heard in the animated television series Jungle\n\nCubs (1996), and in the video sequel The Jungle Book 2 (2003), it is re-\n\nprised by Baloo (voice of John Goodman), Mowgli (Haley Joel Osment),\n\nand Shanti (Mae Whitman).\n\n“Barking at the Moon” is a country-flavored song about finding happi-\n\nness with the home you have, written by Rilo Kiley for the animated movie\n\nBolt (2008). While the television canine star Bolt travels across the country\n\nwith the alley cat Mittens and the hamster Rhino, Jenny Lewis sings the\n\n“BE TRUE TO YOUR GROOVE” 13\n\nsong on the soundtrack. The clever montage shows Mittens teaching Bolt\n\nhow to behave like a normal pet as the lyric expresses contentment with an\n\neveryday dog’s life.\n\n“Be a Star” is the disco-flavored song about shining bright and getting\n\nnoticed, sung on the soundtrack by Tyra Banks during the final scene of the\n\ntelevision movie Life-Size (2000). George Blondheim and Mark Rosman\n\nwrote the splashy song while the teenager Casey (Lindsay Lohan) and her\n\nreal-life fashion doll Eve (Tyra Banks) cause a sensation at a fashion show.\n\n“Be Our Guest” is the Busby Berkeley–like production number in the\n\nanimated movie Beauty and the Beast (1991) that affectionately spoofs\n\nthe Hollywood musicals of the past. The enchanted candelabra Lumière\n\n(voice of Jerry Orbach) leads the silverware, plates, and other kitchen\n\nparaphernalia in the pseudo-French music hall number about the joy of\n\ndining. Alan Menken composed the can-can-like melody, Howard Ash-\n\nman wrote the slapstick lyric, and the merry list song was nominated for\n\nan Oscar. In the 1994 Broadway version of Beauty and the Beast, the\n\nnumber was led by Gary Beach as Lumière and the song was given a sa-\n\ntiric Ziegfeld Follies–like staging. A bluegrass rendition of the song was\n\nrecorded in 1998 by Mike Toppins, Glen Duncan, Billy Troy, Jim Brown,\n\nJames Freeze, and David Chase.\n\n“Be Prepared” is a sinister call to arms written by Elton John (music)\n\nand Tim Rice (lyric) for the animated film The Lion King (1994), in which\n\nthe scheming lion Scar (voice of Jeremy Irons) urges the hyenas to aid him\n\nin overthrowing the lion king Mufasa and putting himself on the throne.\n\nWhile the three main hyenas Shenzi (Whoopi Goldberg), Banzai (Cheech\n\nMarin), and Ed (Jim Cummings) provide the comic element in the number,\n\nthe song is actually a Fascist promise of a new age that is uncomfortably\n\nchilling. In the 1997 Broadway version of The Lion King, the number was\n\nsung by John Vickery as Scar, and Tracy Nicole Chapman, Stanley Wayne\n\nMathis, and Kevin Cahoon as the featured hyenas.\n\n“Be True to Your Groove” is the pulsating rock song about finding your\n\nown worth heard at the beginning and end of the animated made-for-video\n\nsequel The Emperor’s New Groove 2: Kronk’s New Groove (2005). Peter\n\nLurye, who wrote the disco-like number, sings it on the soundtrack with Sandy\n\nBarber when all the villagers are urging the chef Kronk to trust in himself.\n\n14 “BEAR IN THE BIG BLUE HOUSE THEME SONG”\n\nThe Lion King (1994) remains one of the Disney Company’s greatest screen successes, matched\n\nby its popularity on Broadway beginning in 1997. The young lion cubs Simba and Nala look\n\nforward to a fun-filled future with the song “I Just Can’t Wait to Be King.” Little do they know\n\ntheir future is going to be far from merry. (Walt Disney/Photofest)\n\n“Bear in the Big Blue House Theme Song” is the cheerful welcome\n\nsong by Tyler Bunch that opens each episode of the children’s television\n\nseries Bear in the Big Blue House (1997). After a blue dollhouse opens up\n\nand releases various Muppet creatures, the oversized Bear (voice of Noel\n\nMacNeal) leads the cast in this mildly rocking number that greets the view-\n\ners and promises fun.\n\n“Beautiful Beulah” is not a love song about a girl but a tribute to the\n\nsmall town of Beulah, Maine, which Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman\n\nwrote for the film musical Summer Magic (1963). Young Bostonian Nancy\n\nCarey (Hayley Mills) has written the gentle ragtime song about the town\n\nand she sings it to her mother (Dorothy McGuire) and younger brother\n\nPeter (Jimmy Mathers) while her elder brother Gilly (Eddie Hodges) ac-\n\ncompanies her on the piano.\n\n“The Beautiful Briny” is the carefree song about traveling underwater\n\nthat was used in a mixed animation and live-action sequence in the movie\n\nfantasy Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971). The harmless witch Miss Eg-\n\nlantine Price (Angela Lansbury) and her friend Professor Emelius Brown\n\n(David Tomlinson) sing the bubbly song as they travel below the surface\n\n“BEING MRS. BANKS” 15\n\non a magic bed with three children (Roy Snart, Ian Weighill, and Cindy\n\nO’Callaghan) and observe the animated flowers and sea life. The scene\n\nclimaxes with an acrobatic dance at the Beautiful Briny Ballroom where\n\nMiss Price and the professor win a trophy for their fancy footwork. Richard\n\nM. and Robert B. Sherman originally wrote the jovial song, having fun with\n\n“b” alliteration in the lyric, for a sequence in the earlier film Mary Poppins\n\n(1964), but it was cut. The Bedknobs and Broomsticks scene is similar to\n\na superior one in Mary Poppins in which the governess Mary (Julie An-\n\ndrews), her pal Bert (Dick Van Dyke), and two children (Karen Dotrice\n\nand Matthew Garber) enter an animated world and win a trophy for a horse\n\nrace. Yet “The Beautiful Briny” has a charm all its own, and the scene is\n\nperhaps the finest in the film.\n\n“Beauty and the Beast” is the entrancing title ballad from the 1991\n\nanimated film. The teapot Mrs. Potts (voice of Angela Lansbury) sings the\n\ngentle number while the Beast and Belle dance in the castle ballroom. The\n\nsong is also reprised at the end of the film with a chorale version as Belle\n\nand the transformed prince dance in the same ballroom. Alan Menken\n\ncomposed the flowing music and Howard Ashman wrote the simple but\n\naffecting lyric about how two tentative hearts are united in love. A record\n\nthree songs from the movie were nominated for the Best Song Oscar, and\n\nthis one won. Peabo Bryson and Céline Dion sing a duet version of the\n\nballad over the closing credits of the movie, and their recording was very\n\npopular. Among the other versions recorded were those by flutist James\n\nGalway, jazz musician Earl Rose, harpist Carmen Dragon, the Jazz Net-\n\nworks, Barbara Cook, Steve Tyrell, Paige O’Hara, Debbie Shapiro Gravitte,\n\nthe group Jump 5, and Barbara Hendricks and the Abbey Road Ensemble.\n\nIn the 1994 Broadway version of Beauty and the Beast, Beth Fowler was\n\nMrs. Potts and sang the number.\n\n“Behind the Clouds” is the optimistic country-western song written\n\nby Brad Paisley and Frank Rogers for the computer-animated film Cars\n\n(2006). Paisley sings the laid-back number on the soundtrack, reminding\n\none that even on dark, cloudy days, the sun is still shining above those\n\nclouds.\n\n“Being Mrs. Banks” is the revealing character song written by George\n\nStiles and Anthony Drewe for the stage version of Mary Poppins, which\n\nopened in London in 2004. The former actress Winifred Banks (Linzi Hat-\n\n16 “BELLA NOTTE”\n\neley) is having difficulty fitting into the strict upper middle class of London\n\nsociety and wonders if her role in life is to be nothing more than an organizer\n\nof the house. She reprises the number later in the show when her husband\n\nis having financial difficulty and she assures him that her primary job as Mrs.\n\nBanks is to love and support him. When Mary Poppins opened on Broadway\n\nin 2006, Rebecca Luker played Mrs. Banks and sang the song.\n\n“Bella Notte” is the warm serenade written by Sonny Burke and Peggy Lee\n\nfor the animated canine movie Lady and the Tramp (1955). Restaurateur\n\nTony (voice of George Givot) sings the romantic number during the film’s\n\nmost affecting scene, the spaghetti dinner shared by the streetwise mutt\n\nTramp and the refined cocker spaniel Lady as they dine in the alley behind\n\nTony’s restaurant. Tony accompanies himself on the concertina and his\n\nwaiter Joe plays the mandolin. The lyric is in English except for the Italian\n\ntitle phrase for “beautiful night” and the music has a gentle but very Italianate\n\nflavor. A studio chorus sings the song on the soundtrack over the opening\n\ncredits of the movie. Among the artists to record the ballad are Bryn Terfel,\n\nfolk singer Marylee, Steve Tyrell, and Barbara Hendricks and the Abbey\n\nRoad Ensemble. There was a jazz rendition by Earl Rose and a quartet ver-\n\nsion by Meredith Inglesby, Andy Karl, Tyler Maynard, and Keewa Nurullah.\n\nThe song is sung by Joy Enriquez and Carlos Ponce on the soundtrack during\n\nthe end credits for the video sequel Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp’s Adven-\n\nture (2001). The number is sometimes listed as “This Is the Night.”\n\n“Belle” is the extended musical sequence by Alan Menken (music) and\n\nHoward Ashman (lyric) that opens the story proper in the animated fairy\n\ntale movie Beauty and the Beast (1991). As the French country girl Belle\n\n(voice of Paige O’Hara) sings about the predictable ways of the townsfolk\n\nand dreams of something better for herself, the villagers comment on the\n\nbeautiful but odd girl who doesn’t seem to fit in. In a masterful interplay of\n\nsong and dialogue reminiscent of the best Broadway musicals, characters are\n\nintroduced and attitudes established. The arrival of the thickheaded Gaston\n\n(Richard White) in the sequence is particularly effective as he bounds onto\n\nthe scene and sings of his wish to marry Belle. Belle reprises the song later\n\nin the film after turning down Gaston’s crude marriage proposal, and she\n\nwonders if she will ever find happiness in such a place. Ashman’s lyric is\n\na triumph of storytelling and character development, and Menken’s music\n\nhas the classical air of a sprightly period minuet. The Oscar-nominated song\n\nwas sung by Susan Egan and the ensemble in the 1994 Broadway version\n\nof Beauty and the Beast.\n\n“THE BEST TIME OF YOUR LIFE” 17\n\n“The Bells of Notre Dame” is the prologue number for The Hunchback\n\nof Notre Dame (1996), one of the most complex musical sequences ever\n\ndevised for an animated film. The narrator Clopin (voice of Paul Kandel)\n\nrelates in song and storytelling the history of the hunchback Quasimodo:\n\nhow he was born and nearly killed, how he was hidden away, and how Paris\n\nhas become subject to the powerful judge Frollo. Alan Menken composed\n\nthe vivid, urgent music and Stephen Schwartz penned the lyric that even\n\nutilizes sections of Latin religious texts. The song is reprised briefly by Clo-\n\npin and the citizens of Paris at the very end of the film.\n\n“Berrily We Roll Along” is the brief but catchy number written by Patty\n\nand Michael Silversher for the holiday video Winnie the Pooh: Seasons of\n\nGiving (1999). Sent by Rabbit to collect cranberries for Thanksgiving din-\n\nner, Tigger (voice of Jim Cummings) and Eeyore (Peter Cullen) stumble\n\nthrough the Hundred Acre Wood as Tigger sings this peppy number about\n\nall the kinds of berries one can find if you put your mind to it.\n\n“The Best Christmas of All” is the gentle and reflective holiday song\n\nabout friends and family being the only things necessary for a special Christ-\n\nmas, written by Randy Petersen and Kevin Quinn for the made-for-video\n\nfilm Mickey’s Magical Christmas (2001). Gathered together at the House of\n\nMouse for a yuletide celebration, Mickey, Peter Pan, Cinderella, Belle, the\n\nBeast, and many others sing the warm carol at the end of the video.\n\n“The Best of Both Worlds” is the rocking theme song for the television\n\nseries Hannah Montana (2006) about an ordinary California teenager (Mi-\n\nley Cyrus) who has a secret life as a singing superstar. Matthew Gerrard\n\nand Robbie Nevil wrote the pop-rock song about a girl who gets to be both\n\na regular teen and a celebrity, and it is sung over the opening credits by\n\nCyrus, who also made a music video of the number.\n\n“Best of Friends” is the breezy ballad by Richard O. Johnston (music)\n\nand Stan Fidel (lyric) about an unlikely friendship in the animated movie\n\nThe Fox and the Hound (1981). The wise old owl Big Mama (voice of Pearl\n\nBailey) sings the poignant number about Tod the fox and Copper the hound\n\ndog as the two young friends play together, unaware that they are supposed\n\nto be enemies.\n\n“The Best Time of Your Life” is the catchy march song that was written\n\nby Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman to replace their “There’s a Great Big\n\n18 “BET ON IT”\n\nBeautiful Tomorrow” as the theme song for the Carousel of Progress attrac-\n\ntion when it was re-created for Disney World in 1975. The original number\n\nproclaimed the philosophy of General Electric, who had sponsored the\n\nexhibit at the 1964 New York World’s Fair. The new song, which cheerfully\n\nannounces that there is no time better than the present, is more in keeping\n\nwith the Disney philosophy. Yet the earlier song was so popular with visitors\n\nto the theme parks that it was reinstated when Carousel of Progress was\n\nrevamped in 1997. The number is sometimes listed as “Now Is the Time.”\n\n“Bet on It” is the revealing character song for a teenager who realizes he\n\nhas made some wrong choices in the television film sequel High School\n\nMusical 2 (2007). Antonina Armato and Tim James wrote the angst-ridden\n\nballad, which is sung by the once-popular Troy (Zac Efron) who realizes\n\nhe has alienated his friends and his girlfriend with his self-centered be-\n\nhavior.\n\n“Between Two Worlds” is the pop ballad written by Stacy Widelitz and\n\nBlaise Tosti for the made-for-video animated sequel Pocahontas II: Journey\n\nto a New World (1998). Judy Kuhn (singing voice for Pocahontas) and Billy\n\nZane (voice for John Rolfe) sing the romantic song, about how faith and\n\nlove can overcome any differences between two people, on the soundtrack\n\nduring the end credits of the video.\n\n“Beware the Jabberwock” is a silly but highly literate song written by\n\nDon Raye (music) and Gene de Paul (lyric) in 1947 for an animated se-\n\nquence in the film Alice in Wonderland (1951), but it was not used. Based\n\non Lewis Carroll’s famous poem “Jabberwocky,” the jazzy number is meant\n\nas a warning for Alice against the monster that inhabits the Tulgy Wood, us-\n\ning some of Carroll’s made-up words and adding a few invented by de Paul.\n\nA demo recording of the two songwriters singing the song was included as\n\nan extra when the film was released on DVD.\n\n“Beyond My Wildest Dreams” is the gleeful song of discovery written\n\nby Alan Menken (music) and Glenn Slater (lyric) for the 2008 Broadway\n\nversion of The Little Mermaid. After Ariel (Sierra Boggess) has become\n\nhuman, she sings to herself (because she has given her public voice to the\n\nsea witch) about how the human world is even better than she anticipated.\n\nThe song has a busy lyric listing the many wonders of life on land, and the\n\nmusic is equally rapid and bouncy.\n\n“BILL OF SALE” 19\n\n“Beyond the Laughing Sky” is the unused dreamy “I am” song written\n\nby Sammy Fain (music) and Bob Hilliard (lyrics) for the title heroine of\n\nthe animated movie Alice in Wonderland (1951). Alice lets her imagination\n\nrun free and pictures marvelous things in far-off places, the music soaring\n\ngently and the lyric filled with poetic images. The ballad was cut when it\n\nwas deemed too low-key for the character and because Kathryn Beaumont,\n\nwho provided the voice of Alice, had trouble singing it. The number was re-\n\nplaced by the more lively “In a World of My Own,” but the melody’s refrain\n\nshows up as “The Second Star to the Right” in Peter Pan (1953).\n\n“Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo” is the gleeful nonsense song the Fairy Godmother\n\n(voice of Verna Felton) sings in the animated film Cinderella (1950) to cheer\n\nup the title orphan while demonstrating her magical powers. Al Hoffman,\n\nJerry Livingston (music), and Mack David (lyric) wrote the sparkling num-\n\nber, and Perry Como had a hit recording of it. The Oscar-nominated ditty\n\nwas also recorded by such artists as Louis Armstrong, Dinah Shore, Ilene\n\nWoods, Brooke Allison, Barbara Hendricks and the Abbey Road Ensemble,\n\nMary Martin, and Gordon MacRae and Jo Stafford in a duet version. Bobby\n\nMcFerrin sang the song in a 1995 recording of the complete Cinderella score.\n\nThe number, sometimes listed as “Put It Together” or “The Magic Song,” is\n\nreprised, with a slightly altered lyric, by Michael Bradford in the animated\n\nvideo sequel Cinderella II: Dreams Come True (2002), where it is given a hip-\n\nhop treatment and is sung by Brooke Allison over the closing credits.\n\n“Biddle-Dee-Dee” is the lighthearted nonsense song from the movie\n\nToby Tyler (1960). Diane Lampert and Richard Loring wrote the carefree\n\nnumber, which is in keeping with the nature of the title character, an inde-\n\npendent orphan boy who runs away to join the circus.\n\n“Bill Nye the Science Guy” is the repetitive yet memorable title song\n\nfor the 1993 television series hosted by unconventional scientist Bill Nye.\n\nMike Greene wrote the simple jazz number, which is sung over the open-\n\ning credits as Nye is seen floating through a montage of science images.\n\nThe lyric mostly repeats the title of the show, which comes across as a bass\n\nrhythm line, and the number is punctuated by repeating the word “Bill” as\n\na percussive shout.\n\n“Bill of Sale” is the hillbilly romp written by Al Kasha and Joel Hirschhorn\n\nfor the partially animated film Pete’s Dragon (1977). When the backwoods\n\n20 “THE BIRD AND THE CRICKET AND THE WILLOW TREE”\n\nGogan family (Shelley Winters, Jeff Conaway, Charles Tyner, and Gary\n\nMorgan) find the runaway orphan Pete (Sean Marshall) living with the\n\nlighthouse keeper, Lampie (Mickey Rooney), and his daughter, Nora\n\n(Helen Reddy), they produce a bill of sale that says the boy belongs to\n\nthem. In counterpoint to their jaunty song, Nora sings her observations of\n\nthe disreputable Gogans and charges them with cruelty and abuse.\n\n“The Bird and the Cricket and the Willow Tree” is the frothy list song\n\nabout melody written by Paul Francis Webster (music) and Sonny Burke\n\n(lyric) for the film short Adventures in Music: Melody (1953), the first 3-D\n\nanimated movie ever made. Professor Owl (voice of Bill Thompson) in-\n\nstructs his classroom full of birds on how to find melody in nature. Sung by\n\nthe Disney Studio Chorus over a sequence showing animated birds chirp-\n\ning, crickets rubbing their legs together, and wind blowing through a willow\n\ntree, the song has a pleasant tune and lyrics that are simply a list of these\n\nmusical nature sounds. Parts of the movie, sometimes listed as Melody (Ad-\n\nventures in Music), were used in the 1956 film 3D Jamboree that was shown\n\nat the Fantasyland Theater in Disneyland. Although 3-D movies did not\n\ncatch on as Hollywood had hoped, this short film was a popular attraction\n\nat the theme park for many years. It was part of a planned series of movie\n\nshorts about music, but only one other one, Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom\n\n(1953), was made.\n\n“Blame It on the Samba” is the Latin number the Dinning Sisters sing\n\non the soundtrack of the anthology film Melody Time (1948). During the\n\nmusical sequence, Donald Duck and his parrot pal Joe Carioca, reunited\n\nfrom The Three Caballeros (1944), dance and frolic while a live-action\n\nEthel Smith plays the organ. Ernesto Nazareth composed the exotic music\n\nfor the original Brazilian song and Ray Gilbert provided the nimble English\n\nlyric for the film, describing the ingredients that go into the samba. The\n\nsong sequence was re-released as a movie short in 1955.\n\n“Bless Us All” is the harmonic song of thanksgiving the Cratchit family\n\nsings in the holiday movie The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992). Paul Wil-\n\nliams wrote the warm and gentle number and it is sung by Bob Cratchit,\n\nplayed by Kermit the Frog (voice of Steve Whitmire), Mrs. Cratchit, played\n\nby Miss Piggy (Frank Oz), Tiny Tim (Jerry Nelson), and other members of\n\nthe family as they sit around the table and share their humble Christmas\n\nfeast.\n\n“BLUE SHADOWS ON THE TRAIL” 21\n\n“Blow Me Down” is the oddball “I am” song for the sailor Popeye (Robin\n\nWilliams) in the oddball movie musical Popeye (1980). Harry Nilsson wrote\n\nthe unusual number capitalizing on the cartoon’s famous catch phrase and\n\nPopeye sings it when he arrives at the seaside town of Sweethaven looking\n\nfor his long-lost Pappy. Everyone in the village is eccentric and ignores the\n\ngruff sailor, but he takes it all in stride, confident that he can be happy here\n\ndespite the offbeat citizens.\n\n“Bluddle-Uddle-Um-Dum” is the tuneful charm song written by Frank\n\nChurchill (music) and Larry Morey (lyric) for the dwarfs in the ground-\n\nbreaking animated movie Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). Told\n\nby Snow White to wash up before dinner, the seven dwarfs gather outside\n\nat the water trough where Doc (voice of Roy Atwell) urges them to lather\n\nup with this fun song that imitates the sounds of washing, yodeling, and\n\nblubbering. The number is punctuated by snide comments by Grumpy\n\n(Pinto Colvig) until the six others force him to wash as well. The number is\n\nsometimes listed as “The Dwarfs’ Washing Song.”\n\n“Blue Bayou” is the atmospheric number by Bobby Worth (music) and Ray\n\nGilbert (lyric) that provided the background music for a lyrical sequence in\n\nthe animated anthology movie Make Mine Music (1946). The Ken Darby\n\nChorus sings the song on the soundtrack during a “tone poem” in which an\n\negret stops at a bayou to rest, finds a companion, and the two fly off toward\n\nthe moon that is reflected in the water. The poetic animation was originally\n\ncreated for a sequence in Fantasia (1940) and was set to Claude Debussy’s\n\n“Clair de Lune,” but was abandoned when the movie got too long.\n\n“Blue Beyond” is the lullaby-like song about trusting in friends written\n\nby Gordon Kennedy and Blair Masters for the made-for-video animated\n\nsequel The Fox and the Hound 2 (2006). Trisha Yearwood sings the gentle\n\nballad on the soundtrack after the friends Copper and Tod have a falling out\n\nand are not speaking to each other. The lyric is about longing for a friend\n\nwho will follow you anywhere you go.\n\n“Blue Shadows on the Trail” is the pleasing cowboy ballad sung by Bob\n\nNolan and the Sons of the Pioneers on the soundtrack of the “Pecos Bill”\n\nsegment of the animated anthology film Melody Time (1948). Eliot Daniel\n\n(music) and Johnny Lange (lyric) wrote the bucolic song that describes the\n\natmosphere of the desert at night. While the singers are live action, sitting\n\n22 “THE BOATNIKS”\n\naround a campfire, the desert around them and the night animals are ani-\n\nmated. Roy Rogers, Bing Crosby, and Vaughn Monroe and his Orchestra\n\neach had successful recordings of the song.\n\n“The Boatniks” is the bebopping title song for the 1970 movie comedy\n\nabout a bumbling Coast Guard captain and a gang of equally incompetent\n\njewel thieves. Bruce Belland and Robert F. Brunner wrote the pop number\n\nabout the intrepid Coast Guard, which is “nautical but nice,” and it is sung\n\nby a studio chorus over the opening credits.\n\n“Bon Voyage” is the perky and insistent title song for the 1962 film com-\n\nedy. Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman wrote the list song, which is sung\n\nby a chorus over the credits, about the preparations to be made and places\n\nto visit when the Willard family goes on a vacation to Europe. A portion of\n\nthe song is sung in French. The number is reprised over the closing credits\n\nof the movie.\n\n“Bonkers” is the frantic title song by Mark Watters for the 1993 animated\n\ntelevision series about the crazy Hollywood cop Bonkers D. Bobcat. The\n\nrapid jazz number, which invites viewers to join the cat-cop on the beat and\n\nto go bonkers with him, is sung over the action-packed opening sequence,\n\nin which Bonkers wildly bounces from one misadventure to another.\n\n“Boo Bop Bopbop Bop (I Love You, Too)” is the happy nonsense song\n\nthat illustrates the affection between the orphan Pete (Sean Marshall) and\n\nhis pal, the dragon Elliott (voice of Charlie Callas), in the partially animated\n\nmovie musical Pete’s Dragon (1977). Al Kasha and Joel Hirschhorn wrote\n\nthe saccharine but bouncy number in which the two friends find comrade-\n\nship and love even though they are so different.\n\n“The Boogie Beagle Blues” is the farcical rock-and-roll spoof written by\n\nMichael and Patty Silversher for a 1989 episode of the animated television\n\nseries DuckTales (1990). A gang of canine crooks boast that they have broken\n\nout of prison and are on a crime spree, proud of their mug shots put out by\n\nthe FBI. The song pastiches rock icons from the 1950s and 1960s, with refer-\n\nences to blue suede shoes and a howling harmony stolen from the Beatles.\n\n“Boom Shakalaka” is the silly tribal chant in the film Muppet Treasure\n\nIsland (1996) that spoofed tropical island movies. Barry Mann and Cynthia\n\nWeil wrote the rhythmic ditty which is sung by the cloth natives of a Ca-\n\nribbean island, preparing the entrance of their tribal princess Benjamina\n\n“BRAVE TOGETHER” 23\n\nGunn, played by Miss Piggy (voice of Frank Oz). The nonsense lyric repeats\n\nitself and the accompaniment is mostly hyperactive drumming.\n\n“Bop to the Top” is the pseudo-Latin number the conceited Sharpay Ev-\n\nans (Ashley Tisdale) and her spineless brother Ryan (Lucas Grabeel) per-\n\nform at the callback auditions in the television movie High School Musical\n\n(2006). Randy Petersen and Kevin Quinn wrote the silly number filled with\n\nSpanish phrases, and the sister-brother team, used to getting all the leads in\n\nthe school’s musicals, perform it with relentless energy and self-devotion.\n\n“’Bout Time” is the casual but heartfelt love song written by Richard M. and\n\nRobert B. Sherman for the film musical The One and Only, Genuine, Origi-\n\nnal Family Band (1968). Young lovers Joe Carder (John Davidson) and Alice\n\nBower (Lesley Ann Warren) agree that they have put off talking about and\n\nexpressing the love they have only written about to each other in letters. In a\n\nbucolic setting in the hills of Dakota, the two declare their love in the fervent\n\nbut lighthearted song. Joe and Alice reprise the number briefly at the end of\n\nthe movie. Louis Armstrong made a vivacious recording of the song.\n\n“A Boy Needs a Dog” is the saccharine song of canine devotion that is\n\nused satirically in the animated movie Teacher’s Pet (2004), based on the\n\n2000 television series. Kevin Quinn and Randy Petersen wrote the number\n\nabout how everyone needs a best friend and a dog is the ideal friend. It was\n\nused throughout the film as a kind of leitmotif. The boy Leonard Helper-\n\nman (voice of Shaun Fleming) sings it to his pet dog, Spot (Nathan Lane),\n\nwhenever he wants to remind the canine that he is a dog, and each sings it\n\nseparately when the two are separated later in the story.\n\n“The Boys Are Back” is the vivacious number by Matthew Gerrard and\n\nRobbie Nevil about how childhood resurfaces in grown-up males when they\n\nare faced with uncertainty, as heard in the film sequel High School Musical\n\n3: Senior Year (2008). Best friends and high school seniors Troy Bolton (Zac\n\nEfron) and Chad Danforth (Corbin Bleu) sit in a junkyard wondering and\n\nworrying about life after graduation. In a bonding moment, the two revert\n\nback to their childhood and the games of spies and superheroes they played\n\nin that very junkyard. The joyous number is filled with energy that captures\n\nthe playfulness of two little boys. Soon they use the various objects around\n\nthe junkyard as percussion instruments, much as in the Off-Broadway show\n\nStomp.\n\n“Brave Together” is the happy march song written by Michael and Patty\n\nSilversher for the video feature film Pooh’s Heffalump Halloween Movie\n\n24 “BRAVO, STROMBOLI!”\n\n(2005). The young kangaroo Roo (voice of Jimmy Bennett) and his pal\n\nLumpy the elephant (Kyle Stanger) sing the confident song about their\n\ncombined courage as they set off to trap the spooky Gobloon on Halloween.\n\nThe number is reprised during the end credits of the film.\n\n“Bravo, Stromboli!” is the mock operatic aria sung by the villain in the\n\nlive-action television musical Geppetto (2000). The evil puppeteer Stromboli\n\n(Brent Spiner) learns that his star attraction, Pinocchio, has run away but he\n\nvows, with comedic brio, to be revenged on the boy and to use the stringless\n\npuppet to make his fortune. Stephen Schwartz wrote the brash character\n\nsong in the style of a Rossini aria, with delightfully comic lyrics to match.\n\n“Brazil” is the durable samba number that has remained a Latin standard\n\nover the decades. Ary Barroso wrote the music and the original Portuguese\n\nlyric (the title then was “Aquarela do Brasil” or “Watercolor of Brazil”), then\n\nBob Russell provided an English lyric when the song was interpolated into\n\nthe animated film travelogue Saludos Amigos (1942). Aloysio de Oliveira\n\nsings the rhythmic number on the soundtrack with Eddy Duchin and His\n\nOrchestra, while a paintbrush creates watercolor scenes of the flora and\n\nfauna of Brazil. The catchy song was also featured in the movie The Gang’s\n\nAll Here (1943), where it was sung by Carmen Miranda, Oliveira, and the\n\nchorus; in Jam Session (1944), where it was sung by Nan Wynn; and by\n\nbig bands in Road to Rio (1948) and The Eddy Duchin Story (1956). Both\n\nXavier Cugat (vocal by the band members themselves) and Jimmy Dorsey\n\n(vocal by Bob Eberle and Helen O’Connell) had best-selling records of the\n\nserenade, and Les Paul recorded a unique version using multitrack guitars.\n\nThe song was a hit once again in 1975 with a top-selling disco version by\n\nthe Richie Family. “Brazil” inspired three film titles, and it was played on\n\nthe soundtrack of each movie: the 1943 Roy Rogers western, the 1944 Tito\n\nGuizar–Virginia Bruce musical, and the 1985 sci-fi satire.\n\n“Brazzle Dazzle Day” is the infectious song of joy written by Al Kasha and\n\nJoel Hirschhorn for the partially animated film Pete’s Dragon (1977). The\n\nlighthouse keeper, Lampie (Mickey Rooney); his daughter, Nora (Helen\n\nReddy); and the runaway youth Pete (Sean Marshall) celebrate a bright and\n\nglorious day that reflects their friendship as they cavort around the light-\n\nhouse while the camera takes in both the characters and the landscape.\n\n“Break of Day” is the flowing ballad that a studio chorus sings on the\n\nsoundtrack at the beginning of the nature adventure movie Perri (1957).\n\n“BUBBA DUCK THEME” 25\n\nGeorge Bruns (music), Ralph Wright, and Winston Hibler (lyric) wrote the\n\nnumber about how nature refreshes itself and begins life anew with each\n\nnew day. The footage accompanying the song is of a spring dawn in the for-\n\nest, with the morning mist rising over mountains, valleys, and streams.\n\n“Breakaway” is the pop ballad by Matthew Gerrard, Bridget Benenate,\n\nand Avril Lavigne that is used to illustrate a new adventure for the heroine\n\nin the film sequel The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement (2004). Kelly\n\nClarkson sings the number, about learning to fly, traveling to new places,\n\nand taking chances, on the soundtrack as the recent college grad Mia Ther-\n\nmopolis (Anne Hathaway) goes to Europe for the next stage of her life.\n\nClarkson’s recording was a pop hit in Great Britain and she also made a\n\nmusic video of the song.\n\n“Breaking Free” is the soaring and emotionally charged love ballad writ-\n\nten by Jamie Houston for the television movie High School Musical (2006).\n\nThe basketball jock Troy Bolton (Zac Efron, with singing assist by Andrew\n\nSeeley) and the mathematics whiz Gabriella Montez (Vanessa Anne Hud-\n\ngens) rehearse the song given to them for the callbacks for the school’s\n\n“Spring Musicale.” The lyric, about breaking free of stereotypes and seeing\n\na whole new version of themselves that they are starting to like, parallels\n\ntheir own recent history.\n\n“Brimstone and Treacle” is the sadistic character song for the evil nanny\n\nMiss Andrew (Rosemary Ashe) in the 2004 London stage version of Mary\n\nPoppins. George Stiles and Anthony Drewe wrote the harsh song in which\n\nGeorge Banks’s old nanny comes to Cherry Tree Lane to take charge of\n\nthe children Jane and Michael. The old crone describes her method for\n\nchild rearing, which consists of dosages of cod liver oil and bitter treacle,\n\nscrubbing with carbonic soap, and severe punishment for whimpering and\n\nthumb sucking. The number is reprised later in the show by Mary Poppins\n\n(Laura Michelle Kelly) who returns to the Banks’s household, stands up to\n\nMiss Andrew, and sends her on her way. In the 2006 Broadway version of\n\nMary Poppins, the number was sung by Ruth Gottschall as Miss Andrew\n\nand reprised by Ashley Brown as Mary Poppins.\n\n“Bubba Duck Theme” is the driving rock song by Michael and Patty\n\nSilversher that sings the praise of a prehistoric “cave duck” in the animated\n\ntelevision series DuckTales (1990). Bubba Duck is transported from the\n\npast to the present by Scrooge McDuck and the miser’s three nephews\n\n26 “BUG-A-BOO”\n\nbring the friendly visitor to school with them. There the duck demonstrates\n\nthat rock and roll is not new, and the students cheer Bubba in this 1960s-\n\nlike tribute, complete with “hubba hubba” and other rocking expressions.\n\n“Bug-A-Boo” is the peppy and silly disco song by Larry Groce that en-\n\ncourages kids to dance like bugs. The vivacious number was written for\n\nthe 1979 Disney Records album Mickey Mouse Disco but was cut before\n\nthe record was put to vinyl. The song was included in the Disney aerobics\n\nalbum Mousercise (1982) and then was later used on occasion in the televi-\n\nsion exercise program Mousercise (1983).\n\n“Bunnytown” is the sunny title song for the 2007 television series that\n\nutilizes puppets to play all the citizens of the kooky little town. A children’s\n\nchorus sings the simple ditty on the soundtrack during a montage in which\n\ncolorful bunnies go about their daily lives working, playing, driving cars,\n\nand acting like humans in a normal town.\n\n“Bye-Yum Pum Pum” is the lighthearted tango number written by Rich-\n\nard M. and Robert B. Sherman for the movie musical The Happiest Mil-\n\nlionaire (1967). Philadelphia heiress Cordelia Biddle (Lesley Ann Warren)\n\nasks her finishing school roommate Rosemary (Joyce Bulifant) for lessons\n\nin how to flirt with men, and Rosemary obliges with this silly Latin number\n\nabout how to be alluring. The song soon turns into a duet in which the two\n\ngirls do a wild Spanish-flavored dance in their dorm room. The music from\n\nthe tango is then heard at the dance where the two try out their flirtation\n\ntechniques.\n\nC\n\n“Cabin Fever” is the farcical song-and-dance number written by Barry\n\nMann and Cynthia Weil for the film Muppet Treasure Island (1996). Adrift\n\nin the Atlantic Ocean for weeks without a breeze to propel their sails, the\n\ncrew of the Hispaniola is going stir crazy and breaks out into a risible num-\n\nber that moves from calypso to square dancing to a conga. The sailors get\n\nso carried away that some of the cloth and human characters dress up like\n\nCarmen Miranda and cut loose before a wind comes along and everyone\n\nreturns to their senses.\n\n“The Cabin Raising Song” is the homespun list song by Richard M.\n\nand Robert B. Sherman that is used in a folksy scene of friendship in the\n\nfilm Those Calloways (1965). Vermont homesteader Cam Calloway (Brian\n\nKeith) has spent so much of his time building a duck sanctuary in the\n\nmarshes that the construction of his own home for his wife and child is\n\nfar behind. But the Calloways’ friends and neighbors, including Alf Simes\n\n(Walter Brennan), Ed Parker (Ed Wynn), Jim Mellott (John Larkin), and\n\nBridie Mellott (Linda Evans), show up ready to lend a hand. As the towns-\n\nfolk build the cabin, they sing the vigorous number with lyrics that list all of\n\nthe things that will be accomplished by sunset.\n\n“California Gold” is the catchy frontier song performed by a band of\n\nstreet musicians that is used to lure potential miners and prospectors to\n\n27\n\n28 “THE CALL”\n\nseek their fortune in the Gold Rush in the period movie The Adventures\n\nof Bullwhip Griffin (1967). Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman wrote the\n\nnumber, which entices young Jack Flagg (Bryan Russell) to run away from\n\nhis Boston home and strike it rich out West. The song is also listed as “Cal-\n\nI-For-Nee Gold.”\n\n“The Call” is the haunting, dreamlike song by Regina Spektor that is\n\nused so effectively at the end of the film The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince\n\nCaspian (2008). After the lion Aslan informs the Pevensie siblings that they\n\nhave become mature and that this will be their last visit to the enchanted\n\nland of Narnia, they magically disappear through an arbor of trees. Spektor\n\nis heard on the soundtrack singing the moving ballad about promising to\n\nreturn if one is called, so farewells are not needed.\n\n“Call Me a Princess” is the sarcastic, vampy number written by Alan\n\nMenken (music) and Howard Ashman (lyric) for the animated film Alad-\n\ndin (1992), but it was cut early on in the production process. The spoiled\n\nprincess Jasmine confesses in song that she knows she is obsessed with\n\nclothes, her hair, and other superficialities, but she likes being in the upper\n\nclass and always getting her own way. The song was discarded when the\n\ncharacterization of Jasmine changed to a restless young woman who wants\n\nto escape her royal lifestyle. Kerry Butler made a playful recording of the\n\nsong in 2008.\n\n“Call Me, Beep Me” is the Motown-flavored theme song written by Cory\n\nLerios and George Gabriel for the animated television series Kim Possible\n\n(2002) about a teen girl who has a secret life going on missions to save the\n\nworld from evil. Christina Milian sings the rhythm-and-blues number over\n\nthe opening sequence, urging listeners to give her a call if there is trouble\n\nand she will not fail them. Sometimes listed as “The Kim Possible Song,”\n\nthe number is also heard in the various made-for-television movies featur-\n\ning the female superhero.\n\n“Calling All Munchkins” is a silly call to arms song that Rizzo the Rat\n\n(voice of Steve Whitmire) sings with the other rats dressed as Munchkins\n\nin the television movie The Muppets’ Wizard of Oz (2005). Michael Gi-\n\nacchino, Debra Frank, and Steve L. Hayes wrote the short march, which is\n\nsung every time the Munchkins come to the rescue and help Dorothy and\n\nher friends.\n\n“CANDLE ON THE WATER” 29\n\n“Can I Have This Dance?” is the waltzing love song written by Adam An-\n\nders and Nikki Hassman for the film sequel High School Musical 3: Senior\n\nYear (2008). High school senior Troy Bolton (Zac Efron) has asked his girl-\n\nfriend, Gabriella (Vanessa Anne Hudgens), to the senior prom, which has\n\nthe theme “The Last Waltz.” Troy doesn’t know how to waltz, so Gabriella\n\nteaches him on the roof of the high school building, and the two sing this\n\nlovely duet as they dance together. A thunderclap sounds and soon the pair\n\nare dancing and twirling in the rain.\n\n“Can Love Stand the Test” is the country-western song by John Hiatt\n\nthat provides a romantic moment in the satiric film The Country Bears\n\n(2002). Bear singer Tennessee O’Neal (voice of Toby Huss) has been jilted\n\nby his longtime sweetheart Trixie (Candy Ford) but when they meet up at a\n\ncountry music bar, they listen to the humans Don Henley and Bonnie Raitt\n\nsing this affecting love song and the two bears are soon back together.\n\n“Can You Feel the Love Tonight?” is the Oscar-winning love song by\n\nElton John (music) and Tim Rice (lyric) from the animated film The Lion\n\nKing (1994). On the soundtrack, Joseph Williams and Sally Dworsky sing\n\nthe thoughts of lions-in-love Simba and Nala while meerkat Timon (voice\n\nof Nathan Lane) and warthog Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella) make comments on\n\nthe side about how love will destroy their trio. Although the song is a tra-\n\nditional pop ballad in music and words, the African tribal accompaniment\n\ngives the number a distinctive and haunting tone. The ballad is reprised\n\nover the closing credits of the film with a slightly altered lyric. Elton John’s\n\nrecording was a best seller, and there were also versions by Michael Craw-\n\nford, Elliott Yamin, Paul Fried, John Barrowman, S-Club, Sara Paxton, jazz\n\nmusician Earl Rose, pianists Jim Buchanan and John Bayless, and flutist\n\nJohn Galway with Mike Mower. The song is also used in the film My Best\n\nFriend’s Wedding (1997) and in the made-for-video sequel The Lion King\n\n1½ (2004). In the 1997 Broadway version of The Lion King, the number\n\nwas sung by Jason Raize and Heather Headley as Simba and Nala with com-\n\nmentary by Max Casella and Tom Alan Robbins as Timon and Pumbaa.\n\n“Candle on the Water” is the heart-tugging ballad written by Al Kasha\n\nand Joel Hirschhorn for the part-animated, part-live-action musical film\n\nPete’s Dragon (1977). Lighthouse keeper’s daughter Nora (Helen Reddy)\n\nsings the number as she looks out to the ocean from the lighthouse tower\n\nand prays that her sailor-fiancé Paul, who has been lost at sea, will return.\n\n30 “CARRYING THE BANNER”\n\nReddy’s recording of the Oscar-nominated song enjoyed some popularity.\n\nAnneliese van der Pol also recorded the ballad in 2006.\n\n“Carrying the Banner” is the rousing song of pride written by Alan Men-\n\nken (music) and Jack Feldman (lyric) for the period movie musical Newsies\n\n(1992). The newsboys who sell the World on New York City street corners\n\nin 1899 wake up before dawn, wearily singing of their tough life. But as the\n\nsun rises and they hit the streets, the “newsies” come alive, proud to “carry\n\nthe banner,” and even break into a vigorous dance. The song is reprised\n\nin the closing sequence of the film as the boys celebrate their victory over\n\nJoseph Pulitzer in a newsboy strike.\n\n“Casey Junior” is the rhythmic train song written by Frank Churchill\n\n(music) and Ned Washington (lyric) for the animated movie Dumbo (1941).\n\nA studio chorus on the soundtrack sings the chugging number about the\n\nlittle engine Casey Junior, who diligently pulls the circus train loaded with\n\nelephants and other heavy cargo. The title is a reference to the legendary\n\ntrain engineer Casey Jones.\n\n“Casey, the Pride of Them All” is the adoring ballad about the mighty\n\nbaseball player in the “Casey at the Bat” sequence in the animated movie\n\nanthology Make Mine Music (1946). Ray Gilbert, Ken Darby, and Eliot\n\nDaniel wrote the rousing song of affection that is sung by the crowd before\n\nand after the famous poem “Casey at the Bat” is narrated by Jerry Colonna.\n\nAlthough the action of the tale is animated, the song is illustrated with a\n\nseries of Currier and Ives–like stills showing the crowd gathering at the\n\nballpark.\n\n“The Castaways Theme” is a torchy lullaby sung by Mary Grant (Hayley\n\nMills) in the adventure film In Search of the Castaways (1962). Richard M.\n\nand Robert B. Sherman wrote the lovely song about hope for castaways of\n\nall kinds, and Mary sings it about her father, a skipper who was lost at sea\n\nnear New Zealand.\n\n“The Caucus Race” is a farcical list song written by Sammy Fain (music)\n\nand Bob Hilliard (lyric) for the animated fantasy movie Alice in Wonder-\n\nland (1951). On a seashore, the Dodo (voice of Bill Thompson) organizes a\n\nmethod to get dry. While he stands on a rock dictating instructions, various\n\nsea creatures race around him and sing about getting dry. Soon they are\n\n“CHILDREN” 31\n\nexhausted and a wave washes over the ensemble, so the whole experiment\n\nis a failure.\n\n“A Change in Me” is a moving ballad by Alan Menken (music) and Tim\n\nRice (lyric) that was added to the 1994 stage version of Beauty and the\n\nBeast after it had been running on Broadway for four years. When singing\n\nstar Toni Braxton took over the role of Belle in 1998, the songwriters pro-\n\nvided this delicate song in which the heroine notices that she is a different\n\nand better person having known and fallen in love with the Beast. Susan\n\nEgan and Ashley Brown each made a poignant recording of the ballad.\n\n“Cheetah Sisters” is the lite-rock number by Jamie Houston that serves\n\nas the theme song for the four teen singers in the made-for-TV musical The\n\nCheetah Girls (2003) and its sequel The Cheetah Girls 2 (2006). Galleria\n\n(Raven-Symoné), Chanel (Adrienne Bailon), Aqua (Kiely Williams), and\n\nDorinda (Sabrina Bryan) come from different races and backgrounds, but\n\nthey consider themselves sisters, as they profess in this sassy, proud song.\n\n“Cherish the Moment” is the pop ballad about remembering a special\n\nday, sung by the teen singing stars Galleria (Raven-Symoné), Chanel (Adri-\n\nenne Bailon), Aqua (Kiely Williams), and Dorinda (Sabrina Bryan) in the\n\ntelevision sequel The Cheetah Girls 2 (2006). David Lawrence and Faye\n\nGreenberg wrote the slightly rocking number, and the Cheetah Girls sing\n\nit on the soundtrack during a wedding scene.\n\n“Cherry Tree Lane” is one of the new songs written by George Stiles\n\nand Anthony Drewe for the stage version of Mary Poppins, which opened\n\nin London in 2004. The number is sung by Mr. Banks (David Haig), who\n\ndemands order and precision in his home; Mrs. Banks (Linzi Hateley), who\n\ntries (unsuccessfully) to provide that order; and the housekeeper Mrs. Brill\n\n(Jenny Galloway), who wryly comments on the chaos in the household. The\n\nexpositional number is reprised twice in the show by the same characters\n\nto illustrate the reactions to events that occur after Mary Poppins (Laura\n\nMichelle Kelly) arrives. In the 2006 Broadway version of Mary Poppins, the\n\nnumber was sung by Daniel Jenkins as Mr. Banks, Rebecca Luker as Mrs.\n\nBanks, and Jane Carr as Mrs. Brill.\n\n“Children” is a energetic list song about the difficulties of parenthood\n\nwritten by Harry Nilsson for the surreal musical Popeye (1980). When sailor\n\n32 “CHIM CHIM CHER-EE”\n\nPopeye (Robin Williams) and his long-lost Pappy (Ray Walston) are finally\n\nreunited, the old commodore launches into this patter song listing all the\n\ndifficulties of raising children, who never appreciate your efforts.\n\n“Chim Chim Cher-ee” is the Oscar-winning ditty by Richard M. and\n\nRobert B. Sherman that is used effectively in the movie musical Mary\n\nPoppins (1964). The melody is first heard as sidewalk artist Bert (Dick\n\nVan Dyke), as a one-man band, performs it for a small crowd gathered in a\n\nLondon park. Later he sings the number to cheer up the glum siblings Jane\n\n(Karen Dotrice) and Michael Banks (Matthew Garber), with Mary Poppins\n\n(Julie Andrews) joining him in the song. Although the lyric is in the vein of\n\na nonsense song, the music has a haunting quality and the number takes\n\non an almost reverent mood at times. The New Christy Minstrels and Burl\n\nIves each had successful records of the song, which in the original screen-\n\nplay was titled “Pavement Artist.” Louis Prima and Gia Maione recorded\n\nit as a duet, and in 1996 the number got a new interpretation by the Jazz\n\nNetworks. Other recordings were made by such artists as Louis Armstrong,\n\nKahorn Nakasone, Barbara Hendricks and the Abbey Road Ensemble, the\n\nBoston Pops, and a bluegrass rendition by Mike Toppins, Glen Duncan,\n\nBilly Troy, Jim Brown, James Freeze, and David Chase. In the 2006 Broad-\n\nway version of Mary Poppins, Gavin Lee played Bert and sang the number,\n\nas he had in the original London production in 2004.\n\n“Chip ’n Dale Rescue Rangers Theme Song” is the disco-flavored\n\nnumber by Mark Mueller for the popular 1989 Disney television animated\n\nseries. The rhythmic rock song is sung over the opening credits of the show,\n\nboasting that no espionage job is too big or too small for the chipmunk secret\n\nagents, comparing them to Holmes and Watson. Throughout the number,\n\nthe word “chip” is repeated in the lyric as an effective musical punctuation.\n\n“The Chosen One” is the driving rock number by Billy Lincoln, Kat Green,\n\nand Michael Gurley that served as the original theme song for the animated\n\ntelevision series American Dragon: Jake Long (2005) about an Asian Ameri-\n\ncan teen who can transform into a dragon that helps stop crime. The song is\n\nperformed by pop singer Mavin on the soundtrack and reveals the thoughts\n\nof Jake, who vows to travel the land and destroy evil. After the first season,\n\nthe number was replaced by the song “American Dragon.”\n\n“Chow Down” is the sinister yet comic character song for the three hyenas\n\nin the 1997 Broadway version of The Lion King. Elton John (music) and\n\n“THE CIRCLE OF LIFE” 33\n\nTim Rice (lyric) wrote the gluttonous number, which Shenzi (Tracy Nicole\n\nChapman), Banzai (Stanley Wayne Mathis), and Ed (Kevin Cahoon) sing\n\nas they lick their chops and prepare to eat the young lion cub Simba (Scott\n\nIrby-Ranniar).\n\n“Cinderella” is the enchanting title song written by Mack David, Jerry\n\nLivingston, and Al Hoffman for the 1950 animated fairy tale movie. The\n\nDisney Studio Chorus sings the dreamy number over the opening credits\n\nof the movie, promising Cinderella that she will live happily ever after if she\n\ngives her heart over to the possibility of such happiness.\n\n“Cinderella” is the pulsating rock number written by Lindy Robins and\n\nKevin Savigar for the made-for-television movie The Cheetah Girls (2003).\n\nRehearsing in an empty theatre, the teenagers Galleria (Raven-Symoné),\n\nChanel (Adrienne Bailon), Aqua (Kiely Williams), and Dorinda (Sabrina\n\nBryan) sing about the fairy tales their mothers once read to them as chil-\n\ndren. They are self-empowered girls now and are not waiting for any prince;\n\nthey vow to rescue themselves from any dragons that appear.\n\n“Cinderella Work Song” is the busy character number written by Mack\n\nDavid, Jerry Livingston, and Al Hoffman for the title heroine in the ani-\n\nmated movie Cinderella (1950), but it was cut from the final script. An early\n\nconcept in the film had Cinderella, after being promised she could go to the\n\nball if her chores are done, imagining herself multiplying into several girls\n\nin order to get the work completed. The frantic, repetitive melody evokes\n\nthe circles Cinderella is going in and the lyric is a tongue twister of addition\n\nand multiplication as the heroine imagines transforming from one scullery\n\nmaid into a regiment of housekeepers. Both the concept and song were\n\nlater eliminated, but bits of the idea can be found in “The Work Song.”\n\n“The Circle of Life” is the stirring song about the mysterious ways of\n\nnature that opens the animated film The Lion King (1994). As the various\n\nanimals on the savanna gather to pay tribute to the future Lion King named\n\nSimba, Carmen Twillie sings the entrancing number on the soundtrack with\n\nassist by Lebo M, whose African chanting made the Elton John (music) and\n\nTim Rice (lyric) song soar to an almost spiritual level. John’s recording, less\n\nreverent and more pop in flavor, was a major success. Other recordings were\n\nmade by Michael Crawford, Roan Keating, John Bayless, Oliver Shanti, Bar-\n\nbara Hendricks and the Abbey Road Ensemble, and Magpie. In the 1997\n\nBroadway version of The Lion King, the narrator Rafiki (Tsidii Le Loka) led\n\n34 “CIRCUS DAY”\n\nthe ensemble in the stunning opening number, and the song was used again\n\nin the made-for-video sequel The Lion King 1½ (2004).\n\n“Circus Day” is the carnival-like theme song used for Thursdays on the\n\ntelevision series Mickey Mouse Club (1955). Adult host Jimmie Dodd wrote\n\nthe lively song about Thursdays having a circus theme on the show, and he\n\nsings it with the Mouseketeers, dressed as big top performers, sideshow at-\n\ntractions, and animal trainers. The number then turns into a roll call in which\n\neach cast member shouts his or her name and demonstrates a circus feat.\n\n“Climb the Mountain” is the lighthearted march number by Franklyn\n\nMarks and By Dunham that is used throughout the adventure film Third\n\nMan on the Mountain (1959). The melodious number is reminiscent of\n\nKenneth Alford’s “Colonel Bogey March” from The Bridge on the River\n\nKwai (1957). It is about scaling the heights and is the theme song for the\n\nAfter the success of Mary Poppins (1964), Disney and other studios tried to re-create the\n\nspecial magic of that blockbuster. The Happiest Millionaire (1967) was one of their most costly\n\nattempts. Songwriters Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman wrote the score with Rex Harrison\n\nin mind, but Walt Disney preferred his favorite, Fred MacMurray (far right). Hermione Bad-\n\ndeley is the housekeeper doing the Irish jig and she is applauded by Lesley Ann Warren and\n\nTommy Steele. (Walt Disney/Photofest)\n\n“COMFORTING TO KNOW” 35\n\nambitious young climber Rudi Matt (James MacArthur), who is determined\n\nto reach the top of the treacherous Citadel, the Alpine peak on which his\n\nfather died. The song accompanies Rudi’s practice climbs, is whistled by\n\nRudi and his girlfriend, Lizbeth (Janet Munro), and becomes a soaring\n\ninstrumental piece in the film’s finale.\n\n“Colonel Hathi’s March” is the comic military number for a line of el-\n\nephants in the animated movie The Jungle Book (1967). Richard M. and\n\nRobert B. Sherman wrote the playful march in which the head elephant,\n\nColonel Hathi (voice of J. Pat O’Malley), leads his pack in military maneu-\n\nvers, his forgetfulness often causing collisions and pileups. Joining in the\n\nmarch and the song are the colonel’s wife, Winifred (Verna Felton); his son,\n\nJunior (Clint Howard); and the young man-cub Mowgli (Bruce Reither-\n\nman). In the video sequel The Jungle Book 2 (2003), the song is reprised by\n\na quartet of elephants voiced by Bob Joyce, Rick Logan, Guy Maeda, and\n\nJerry Whitman. The number is sometimes listed as “The Elephant Song.”\n\n“Colors of the Wind” is the Oscar-winning song of inspiration about\n\nnature and racial tolerance written by Alan Menken (music) and Stephen\n\nSchwartz (lyric) for the animated film Pocahontas (1995). (It was Menken’s\n\nfourth Best Song Oscar in six years.) The Native American girl Pocahontas\n\n(singing voice of Judy Kuhn) shows Captain John Smith the wonders of the\n\nland in the New World, arguing that it must be preserved to be understood,\n\nand tells him he must walk in the footsteps of the Native American in order\n\nto understand her people. Menken’s expansive music and Schwartz’s vivid\n\nimagery keep the song potent without being preachy. Vanessa Williams re-\n\nprises the ballad during the end credits of"
