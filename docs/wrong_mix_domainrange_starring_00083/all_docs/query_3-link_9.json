        "text": "Bonjorno and welcome to another blog post friends! Today we are looking into the history of Disney’s Rivera Resort, more specifically, the heritage of it and how Imagineers were inspired to create this resort based on Walt’s travels to this region!\n\nI was lucky enough to stay at this Disney Vacation Club Resort this past January and I am still in disbelief at how amazing it is. During my visit, I learned so much about the inspiration behind it that I myself was inspired to take a deeper dive and showcase to you all the creative process for this European Riviera right in the middle of the Walt Disney World Resort!\n\nWalt’s Grand Tour of Europe\n\nOne thing that people often don’t know about Walt Disney is that he loved to travel! Not only was it a passion of his, but often on these trips he did a lot of research for the company and would return home filled with ideas that later inspired movies, characters, and attractions!\n\nOne trip that was very memorable in the History of the Walt Disney Company was Walt’s trip to the European Rivera. Often referred to as Walt’s “Grand Tour of Europe in 1935” this period of his life brought so much growth to his enterprise. Walt shipped back over 300 books back from his travels abroad, including such children’s classics as “Pinocchio” “Alice in Wonderland” and “Peter Pan” which went on to become huge animated movies for the Studio. Click here for more information about his travels from Disney Parks Blog\n\nWhen creating the newest Disney Vacation Club resort, Disney’s Riviera Resort, Imagineering decided to pay tribute to Walt and Lillian’s European travels. On his extended tours of the European Riveria, Walt fell in love with the culture. The architecture, art, and stories of the region all became influences for future projects for the company after his trip. These elements, in turn, have also been reflected throughout the resort.\n\nA Look into the Riviera\n\nAt the heart of the Walt Disney Company, they are storytellers. So throughout the resort, guests are being transported into the narrative that they are on the European Riviera. The story is told not only through staying at the resort, but the restaurants, shops, lounges, pools, and other amenities help immerse guests into the theme. I have selected some of the more notable locations in the resort that are rich with information that help further enhance the story of this resort.\n\nVoyagers Lounge\n\nLocated on the lobby level, right next to Le Petit Cafe, the Voyagers Lounge is an area of the hotel where guests can relax and catch up on work or enjoy their coffee from the cafe next door. This area is home to a collection of artifacts, including reproductions of items from the Walt Disney Archives, that celebrate European storytelling, and Walt Disney’s love for travel.\n\nThis has become one of my favorite areas of the resort as it is such a relaxing and quiet place. The background music here is a collection of classic Disney songs covered in a Jazz style and sung in various European languages.\n\nTopolino’s Terrace — Flavors of the Riviera\n\nTopolino Terrace is the Riviera’s signature restaurant, located at the top of the resort. It pays homage to the Italian name for Mickey Mouse “Topolino”. The resort’s signature restaurant draws inspiration from the French and Italian cliffside restaurants along with the European Rivera and offers both Breakfast and Dinner options for guests. Click here to view the menu.\n\nArtwork\n\nHere at Disney’s Riviera, one of the most notable features of the resort is the artwork. According to D23, the official Disney Fan Club “ The resort features a unique collection of signature art, including more than 40 original works of art created by Disney and Pixar artists. The art is influenced by the Mediterranean region’s unique and renown art history—plus the gorgeous art of your Disney favorites.” Want to know what the coolest thing about this artwork is? You can actually take the art from the resort home with you! Located at the gift shop wishing the resort, La Boutique, there is a kiosk here where you can purchase the art found throughout the resort. Check out some of the pieces that you find down below!\n\nThank you all for taking this deeper dive into one of my favorite Walt Disney Resort Hotels with me! With some of my favorite food, artwork, and ambiance on property, it is definitely something everyone should check out on their trip to Walt Disney World. I had so much fun when I had the opportunity to stay here back in January and it was nothing short of amazing."
