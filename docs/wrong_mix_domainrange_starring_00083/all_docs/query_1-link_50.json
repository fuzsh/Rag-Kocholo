        "text": "The academic assessment of the products of the Walt Disney Company is usually highly negative, drawing out their sexist, racist, and mercenary factors. Although such views are not easily denied, their strong ideology often hides how Disney texts actually operate and how their audiences interact with them. This article explores how recorded music is used in the Disney theme parks to condition audience response, finding a middle ground between an ideological view, exploring the part music plays in social control, and a hermeneutic view, seeing how music functions in articulating and enhancing the experiences in which Disney's guests participate. Disney's Imagineers draw on the language of film music to create a wide variety of narrative musical spaces that give guests the impression that they navigate through these carefully staged narratives as protagonists. Film-musicological models show that guests are encouraged to feel that they control the respective spaces, although filtering the model through critical theory will demonstrate that the spaces can actually be seen as controlling them. While critical theory and structuralist hermeneutics might seem at first like strange bedfellows, analyses of both the narratives themselves and of their social effects can usefully reflect each other, together providing a more nuanced view of Walt Disney World's experiential texts than has been presented either in the academy or by Disney itself. We are in 1940s Hollywood and the hotel band is playing from the garden on the other side of the grounds. A group of unknowing guests approaches the popular hotel. They fill the elevator to begin a tour of the extravagant building, but things quickly begin to go wrong. The band can no longer be heard; instead, eerie music coming from an unseen source begins to gain prominence. It is in a minor key and features a repeated motive produced by an electric guitar against thickening orchestral textures as the suspense mounts. Nearby, a motley crew of space explorers takes a trip through the far reaches of the galaxy to full orchestral accompaniment (although there isn't actually an orchestra present on board the spaceship). Not far from there, a family dressed in shorts and t-shirts happily takes pictures in the snow, accompanied by jaunty Christmas music. These experiences might sound like they take place in a local multiplex cursed with poor soundproofing, but the varied soundscapes are not happening in films at all. We are not watching stories about these people; we are these people: the hotel guests, the space explorers, and the happy family. We are at the Disney's Hollywood Studios theme park in Florida at the height of the Christmas season; we are surrounded by music, and there isn't a cola-stained cinema seat in sight. A visitor at any of the Disney parks will find it impossible to avoid music. It could be argued that Walt Disney World in Florida is itself the most complex musical text in history: a forty-square-mile space in which everything has a score. The little academic work that has been done on music in the theme parks, however, has focused on its role in helping guests (Disney-speak for customers) identify with Disney products intertextually and nostalgically, rather than analyzing in detail\n\nAs a medium of communication, a song has a great impact in children’s development. A small number of children song generate children to sing adult songs, however, there are some adult songs which are not suitable to children in relation to lyrics and theme. The incomprehension of the lyrics and meaning existed in the song can be psychologically influential for the child's development. This study analyzes the role of Walt Disney’s cartoon soundtracks for character education to children. This is a qualitative-descriptive research, taking observation and in-depth interview to 10 informants who have children of 7-11 years old in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The results stated that the soundtracks How Far I'll Go and Let It Go bring positive characters in contents that are useful for character education. The character education taken from lyrics of the songs is conveyed and developed by vocabulary enrichment, discussion in easy-digested language, and storytelling. These require special time. The good changes in children’s good characters happen by time and process. Therefore, character education needs to be continued and developed in different ways. Keywords: character education; movie soundtrack; child development\n\nFor this project, I will first discuss the form and function of the &quot;wishing song&quot; and then examine specific wishing songs from a selection of films, placing the princess&#39;s &quot;wish&quot; in its historical and cultural context. The specific films I will focus on, such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Cinderella, The Little Mermaid, The Princess and the Frog, and Frozen, showcase the princesses&#39; wishes, ranging from love to freedom while including historical and cultural contexts. This research will frame the creation of my own Disney princess and wishing song based on the main concepts in the films listed above.&lt;br&gt;While I am a finance major, music is my first love. I do love numbers, too, and thus chose to major in finance for career purposes. I have been singing since before I could form sentences and love all things Disney. Creating a new Princess for our current environment and the direction that Disney is moving would help me, my peers, and the youn...\n\nSilencing doesn’t always refer to the removal of sound; it can also refer to the overwriting of a narrative or a recontextualization of events. Instead of removing a narrative – censorship that then leaves a gap to be questioned – changing the dialogue, inserting a new narrative, or changing the circumstances of remembering the events in question can reshape, obscure or even erase memories or associations of trauma. Consider, for example, the juxtaposition of lullabies and trauma in Disney films, specifically “Aloha Oe” in Lilo and Stitch, “Baby Mine” from Dumbo, and “You’ll Be in My Heart” from Tarzan. All three of these lullabies are situated in these films in the context of some sort of physical or emotional violence or trauma: in Tarzan the song helps to re-establish a sense of home after the audience witnesses the death of the eponymous character’s human parents; in Dumbo the lullaby recontextualizes the rather violent situation of the caged/enslaved elephants; and “Aloha Oe” is sung by Nani to Lilo in Lilo and Stitch to soften the trauma of their family being broken up by a government agency. However, music from Disney soundtracks exists both within the context of the films and outside of it: they are decontextualized as part of compilation albums, lullaby albums, played on the radio, and are incorporated into children’s choir and school concerts. Memory of music is complicated, and as Disney often plays lullabies over very sad moments, it is important to examine how the songs function in different spaces both within and outside of the films, and how the viewer then constructs meaning in between these varied contexts. As these songs are featured elsewhere, the songs become removed from the association they have with their particular placement in the films, and the connotations associated with them change. In effect, we can see through these instances, not only how music might shape perception and memory, but also, how memory of trauma or violence can be obscured.\n\nThe relationships between childhood and the media have been studied increasingly by means of Communication and Education. Their link with the identity, the habitat, the patrimony and cultural diversity has located these relationships focused on different psychological and multicultural studies as well as in critical pedagogy. This research is interested in knowing the effects in childhood of one of the parts of the audiovisual binomial: music in films, with a particular presence that takes place in the soundtrack. From a semiotic approach, this research explores some descriptive approaches and both content and musical analysis to attend to three contents: the characteristics of music in the two films selected for the research; the links between them and the film story and the representation of the world included, which is offered by the music, by analysing the animation films Happy Feet and The Lion King and carrying out a musical journey along their soundtracks. The analysis main goal is to know the effects of this kind of daily music that is close to children by means of films, by others and from others, their values and cultural domains. This research is part of a wider investigation that studies the effects of the music of the daily environment of children and young people, being focused on the study of the MEDIA, especially films and television. In short, our research has examined the way music and lyrics in the two selected animation films interact to produce meaning in children as spectators. The lyrics that act as presentation of the musical numbers of both films and their relationship with the songs that introduce have been thoughtfully analysed. The research has considered the planning of both films, the study of the music and outstanding musical numbers. Finally, they have been studied in a comparative way by means of content analysis of music and musical numbers. The results from the research have shown the support of the music to certain social groups and the characters' roles in detriment of other elements, the cultural domains as well as the role of music in the film story as narrator, as the one with the most knowledge, as the anticipatory element of the action. By means of these results, the research shows the way music in films for children often expresses much more than words. In conclusion, we can state that films soundtrack of and television programmes have considerable educational impact and social responsibility since it plays an important role in the construction of children and teenagers consciousness because it contributes to their cognitive, social and expressive, aesthetic and critic construction. The results of this research will be very useful as an orientation for the audiences, producers, television channels and educators as well for future curricular designs."
