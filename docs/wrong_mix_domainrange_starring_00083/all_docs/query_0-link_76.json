As we advance into the 21st century we begin to examine the impact these artists have had on this inﬂuential medium. What is a modern ﬁlmmaker? The phrase connotes a motion picture maker who is au courant—they make movies currently. The choices in this series are also varied to reﬂect the enormous potential of the cinema. Some of the directors make action movies, some entertain, some are on the cutting edge, others are political, some make us think, some are fantasists. The motion picture directors in this collection will range from highly commercial, mega-budget blockbuster directors to those who toil in the independent low-budget ﬁeld. Gus Van Sant, Tim Burton, Charlie Kaufman, and Terry Gilliam are here, and so are Clint Eastwood and Steven Spielberg—all for many and for various reasons, but primarily because their directing skills have transitioned from the 20th century to the ﬁrst decade of the 21st century. Eastwood and Spielberg worked during the sixties and seventies and have grown and matured as the medium transitioned from mechanical to digital. The younger directors here may not have experienced all of those cinematic epochs themselves, but nonetheless they remained concerned with the limits of ﬁlmmaking: Charlie Kaufman disintegrates personal and narrative boundaries in the course of his scripts, for example, while Tim Burton probes the limits of technology to ﬁnd the most successful way of bringing his intensely visual fantasies and nightmares to life. The Modern Filmmakers series will celebrate modernity and post-modernism through each creator’s vision, style of storytelling, and character presentation. The directors’ personal beliefs and worldviews will be revealed through in-depth examinations of the art they have created, but brief biogra-\n\nx\n\nSeries Foreword\n\nphies will also be provided where they appear especially relevant. These books are intended to open up new ways of thinking about some of our favorite and most important artists and entertainers. Vincent LoBrutto Series Editor Modern Filmmakers\n\nAcknowledgments Gratitude to my wife, Harriet Morrison. I will say again that she keeps our lives together—and this author functioning on a daily basis. This time, however, she was faced with a seemingly impossible situation that put the completion of this book in jeopardy. Harriet immediately mobilized—in other words, she saved the day, and that’s why I love her so. Rebecca Roes, my daughter, to whom this tome is dedicated, has the heart of a lion and the soul of an artist. My son, Alex (aka Slick), sommelier, knows everything about wine and a lot about the cinema. At Praeger, I thank Dan Harmon for getting this series off the ground and into reality and for choosing me to helm it. Dan is loyal and committed to ﬁlm literature. I offer my gratitude to everyone at Praeger for their invaluable assistance. To men who love men and to women and men who love each other, to lesbians and bisexuals—continue to follow your hearts. To Gus Van Sant for proving ﬁlm is an art beyond argument and for ﬁghting against being pigeon-holed. He is a ﬁlmmaker, not a gay ﬁlmmaker or a Hollywood ﬁlmmaker or an independent ﬁlmmaking ﬁlmmaker or an experimental ﬁlmmaker. He embraces his love of cinema—openly. Gus Van Sant is not originally from Portland, Oregon, but has adopted the city as his own. The city of Portland captures the spirit of his life’s artistic and personal commitment. I thank Ed Bowes, motion picture creator and ﬁlm instructor, for discussions concerning Van Sant and avant-garde cinema; John Campbell, for talking to me about his work as a cinematographer on Mala Noche, My Own Private Idaho, and Even Cowgirls Get the Blues; May Kassem, for her constant support and for providing a tape of Orson Welles’s Chimes at Midnight; Valdis Óskarsdóttir, for talking to me about Portland and the editing of Finding Forrester; motion picture editor Pietro Scalia for his insights on collaborating with Van Sant on Good Will Hunting; and Peter Tonguette, a Welles scholar, among other things, for discussing the inﬂuence of Chimes at Midnight on My Own Private Idaho.\n\nxii\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nAt the School of Visual Arts I thank my chairman, Reeves Lehmann, for his constant support of me as teacher and author and Sal Petrosino, Director of Operations, for his friendship, support, and kindness. I also must acknowledge Gene Stavis, ﬁlm historian extraordinaire, and historian Roy Frumkes, who always has an insight to share. My personal good wishes to the 2008– 2009 Thesis Committee, Ed Bowes, Joan Brooker, Mary Lee Grisanti, and Elzbieta Litwin, for all the lively debates on ﬁlm education and the art and craft of the movies—and for being there when the chips were down. I salute all my students past and present for sharing their thoughts on Van Sant and the cinema; they think I’m crazy every year when I tell them I’ve learned a lot from them. At American Cinema Editor (ACE) I thank the board for achieving such great work in the promotion of the art of editing. To my late parents, Rose and Tony LoBrutto, thank you for putting up with a rambunctious kid, letting me use the family movie equipment, and paying my tuition so I could attend the School of Visual Arts Film School which changed my life forever. Two relatives were key in stimulating and sustaining my interest in the movies very early on. Gene (Gino) Damiani, who photographed all the family movies and projected them in front of my eyes, developed my passion for the American Western as we sat in front of his black-and-white television watching every cowboy movie that was broadcast. When I started ﬁlm school and studied John Ford, I was thrilled to talk about this great master with my uncle, who replied “Who’s John Ford?” Rest in peace, dear uncle. Joseph Zoine, also departed, was the brother of the late Vince Edwards of Ben Casey fame. He went to the movies constantly, and we engaged in many stimulating conversations. Bless the good people, the cows, and the corn that surround me in Hillsdale, New York, my upstate haven. My gratitude to Dr. Jean Miller for her expertise and steadfast commitment. My thanks to James Robert Parish for writing his wonderful Gus Van Sant: An Unauthorized Biography, the only book on the director before this one. As always, my love and respect to all the paisans at Pelham Pizzeria. We lost Luigi Ruffolo this year, the man known as Gino, who fed me well and kept me close to my roots. His friendship will be missed. I thank master ﬁlm biographer Patrick McGilligan for his support and advice. Finally, I thank the late great ﬁlm director Rainer Werner Fassbinder, who, at the New York Film Festival on the occasion of screening his masterpiece Fox and His Friends (originally The Fist-Fight of Freedom), pronounced “Life is precious, even now.”\n\n1 The Traveling Artist\n\nThis book is an intensive examination of the maverick, openly gay, sometimesHollywood, sometimes experimental, sometimes true-life, actually born in Louisville, Kentucky, on July 24, 1952, sometimes epic moviemaker Gus Van Sant—the man so indelibly linked to the city of Portland, Oregon.\n\nPARENTS His dad, Gus Greene Van Sant, a World War II Navy veteran, attended Purdue University on a football scholarship but left school to become a traveling salesman whose territory covered Kentucky to Colorado. Van Sant Jr.’s mother, Betty, was from Kentucky. Married in 1950, both parents practiced the Episcopalian faith. In the ﬁrst year of their marriage, Gus Sr. became a round-the-clock salesman for a men’s pants company, Mertit Clothing, while his wife taught secondgrade students in an elementary school.\n\nFAMILY AND EARLY LIFE OF GUS VAN SANT Gus’s Dad was constantly on the move, and in 1953 the family relocated to Denver, Colorado. On June 12, 1956, Van Sant Jr.’s sister, Malinda Anne, was born. She was nicknamed Sissy, a coincidental connection to Sissy Henshaw in the Tom Robbins novel Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (1976), which the ﬁlmmaker would later adapt into a ﬁlm. Like Steven Spielberg, David Lynch, and Michael Moore, who reached various levels of the Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts, and even Eagle Scouts (Lynch), Van Sant joined the Scouts (but had attendance problems because of his\n\n2\n\nGus Van Sant\n\nfather’s caravan traveling show). The Scouts is a disciplined organization in which boys learn about the world they live in by studying and creating projects in different aspects of the sciences, nature, and environmental studies. Van Sant, who would later become an artist and be associated with the rugged terrain of Portland, embraced the spirit of the Scouts. The all-boy membership of the scouts made him feel comfortable, although this was not the venue of his ﬁrst homosexual encounter. Mr. Van Sant took another position with a higher-league ﬁrm and quickly became the regional manager. Eventually another move for the nomadic Van Sants occurred—this time to the extreme West Coast. Within half a year, Gus Sr. was promoted to company vice president. To keep Gus Jr. from having to face additional changes of school, his father settled the family in New York City, where the company’s corporate ofﬁces were located. Soon after, there was another move that took the family to Darien, Connecticut. For Gus Jr., this was his sixth home in only 10 years, and the transition was taking a toll on his psyche; however, it did teach the boy how to depend on and fend for himself. Eventually these qualities helped him morph into a rebellious young person with a mind of his own, a nonconformist who traveled his own route. Van Sant’s sense of rootlessness, a yearning to remain in childhood, crept into the themes of many Van Sant movies. Gus began to develop an interest in art and even won an award for one of his projects in a high school contest. The multimedia work was disturbing in its dark and, at times, bizarre point of view toward life, although his parents demonstrated their acceptance of his work by buying one of the paintings from the art show and hanging it in the family dining room.\n\nTHE ARTIST EMERGES In 1966, living in Connecticut, Van Sant Sr. saw his career continue to rise, leading to another company move, but this time the family remained in the same state and city. Gus Jr. created a space provided for him into a place to live and paint. Illness struck as Gus Jr. came down with rheumatoid arthritis, but private home schooling kept him up to speed with his classmates. Art teacher Robert Levine inspired young Gus Van Sant by working in a manner reminiscent of Andy Warhol, which involved artistic interest in the ordinary and a radical approach to tools and surfaces. The teacher was a role model that Van Sant could relate to in myriad ways—as a painter whose lifestyle the youngster understood and as someone who used cutting-edge art materials. He was also gay. English teacher David Soan encouraged Gus Van Sant to make 8mm movies, which he did using the family Kodak Super 8mm camera.1 The ﬁlms were collaborations with two fellow students and resembled the ﬁlms of Norman McLaren (Begone Dull Care [1949], Neighbours [1953], A Chairy Tale [1958]) and Robert Breer (Eyewash [1959], Breathing [1963], What Goes Up [2003]).\n\nThe Traveling Artist\n\n3\n\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK Gus was already traveling into New York City to explore its vibrant art and movie scene; from a summer job he earned enough money to buy a Super 8mm camera. He bought An Introduction to the American Underground Film by Sheldon Renan, a book that taught him the history and concepts that would inﬂuence his lifelong work, especially, Gerry (2002), Elephant (2003), Gus Van Sant’s Last Days (2005), and Paranoid Park (2007). At 16, Gus was working on Madison Avenue, but his parents deemed him too young to go to the Woodstock Music and Art Fair. He missed out on the festivities but managed to emulate his boss and ingest LSD 25—better known as acid. The psychedelic experiences expanded his artistic vision and linked him to the hippie subculture. At this time, Van Sant was aware he was gay—he was attracted to the homoerotic ﬁlms of Alejandro Jodorowsky (Fando and Lis [1968], El Topo [1970], and The Holy Mountain [1973])—but he was not overtly engaging in sex with men. At the dawn of the 1970s, the Van Sant family relocated to the place that would forever deﬁne the ﬁlmmaker and person Gus Van Sant—Portland, Oregon. In high school, Van Sant met cinematographer Eric Alan Edwards (Kids [1995], Over the Edge [2001], Management [2008]), who would shoot on six Van Sant ﬁlms, in some cases as additional camera, other times as director of photography. Along with another classmate, Carl Stevens, the young men created a 16mm ﬁlm2 about a brother and sister. The Happy Organ incorporated time-lapse photography and had a score with songs by Frank Zappa and others. Van Sant approached an important decision after high school. It was 1971; the Vietnam War was raging in Southeast Asia. The draft was active, but it seemed likely Van Sant would be eligible for a deferment because of his history of rheumatic fever. It is also possible that his homosexuality, though not common knowledge, became evident during the rigorous induction process, during which young men were asked about their sexual orientation.\n\nCOLLEGE: THE FILMMAKER EMERGES So it was to be college for Van Sant for educational and artistic reasons. He had only one school in mind, the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), because of its cultural and academic reputation. Van Sant was still interested in a life as a painter, and the school had an excellent art department. Eric Alan Edwards and fellow high school classmate Catlin Gabel both were on the RISD track, as well. The school and its environs also had a hippie community ﬁlled with those who walked the road less traveled—a perfect atmosphere for the eclectically artistic Van Sant. There were plenty of rock bands and performance artists. Van Sant took courses in painting and ﬁlmmaking.\n\n4\n\nGus Van Sant\n\nThe Van Sant family moved again while Gus was at RISD, this time from Portland, with its rich counterculture, back to the more exclusive Darien, Connecticut. In his sophomore year, Van Sant decided that he couldn’t make a decent living or survive as a painter, and he shifted to ﬁlmmaking. The painting background would become instrumental in shaping Van Sant as a motion picture director. He has a painterly approach to cinema composition, texture, and color. The eclectic artist also played guitar and wrote songs, as well as studying still photography. Van Sant is among a handful of ﬁlmmakers, including Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, and Stanley Kubrick, who understand how to apply music to their ﬁlms and to use music and lyric as an interpretive tool. The cinematography in every Van Sant ﬁlm carefully tells the story in light, form, and movement. His personal study of and work in still photography have enhanced Van Sant’s abilities to openly and creatively collaborate with his directors of photography. There was a lot of video work being produced at RISD, not television but a creative, experimental use of the electronic medium, and Van Sant drank in this multimedia mix available to him. Trains, traveling, and the hobo life play a signiﬁcant part in Van Sant’s ﬁlms. When he was 20, he rode the rails, and the sights and sounds of those experiences are revealed in visual images and especially in sound design in ﬁlms throughout his career. During the RISD years, Van Sant made several ﬁlms: Little Johnny (1972), a 40-second black-and-white short; the two-minute black-and-white 16mm 1/2 of a Telephone Conversation (1973); and his senior project, Late Morning Start (1975), 16mm color, 28 minutes. This last ﬁlm he describes as being Godardian, although Van Sant continues to state that he knows little about the French maverick. This is a curious fact because his tendency is to rediscover traditional movie genres, color, structure, and content seem markedly inﬂuenced by Jean-Luc Godard (Breathless [1960], Perrot le Fou [1965], Hail Mary [1985]). Van Sant graduated from RISD with a B.F.A. on May 31, 1975. He was 22 years old.\n\nOUT IN THE REAL WORLD After graduation, Van Sant and a group of ﬁlm majors from RISD traveled to Italy to observe some of the country’s ﬁnest ﬁlmmakers at work. Van Sant arrived in Rome, where he would return to shoot pivotal scenes of My Own Private Idaho (1991). The choices were remarkable. The group watched Federico Fellini (who died on the same day as River Phoenix, star of My Own Private Idaho) direct Fellini’s Casanova (1976). Van Sant would be inﬂuenced by another self-named Fellini ﬁlm, Fellini’s Satyricon (1969), which in the main was a gay story interpreted by a heterosexual director.\n\nThe Traveling Artist\n\n5\n\nFrom studying Fellini up close and on the screen, Van Sant learned about cinematic whimsy and saw a kind of surrealism that was in a manner different from that practiced by most experimental ﬁlmmakers. Also observed was Lina Wertmüller, Fellini’s former assistant director, shooting Seven Beauties (1975), which contained a ﬂashback structure important to the lexicon of Van Sant’s storytelling style. Pier Paolo Pasolini, arguably the ﬁnest gay ﬁlm director in the history of cinema, was making his difﬁcult and disturbing masterpiece Salo (1975). A group of students sat while the great ﬁlmmaker sound-mixed a sequence from the gruesome yet somehow brave and beautiful ﬁlm. Van Sant was able to get a personal invitation to Pasolini’s home. They discussed the adaptation of literature to the screen. Back in the states, Van Sant met a person who would change his life, the Beat writer William S. Burroughs. This led the young ﬁlmmaker to adapt a ﬁlm from the Burroughs short story “The Discipline of D.E.” (1973). Burroughs’s inﬂuence grew out of the writer’s experimental approach to his work as part of an early generation of gay men and out of his bohemian life style.\n\nHOLLYWOOD Van Sant decided to move to the West Coast to see if he could enter the Hollywood ﬁlm industry. Once there, he decided against living in the gay community of West Hollywood and rented a small apartment not far from Hollywood Boulevard. Van Sant loved walking up and down the once-illustrious but by-then seedy street of dreams, talking and hanging out with the dregs of society. He found a favorite restaurant, Johnnie’s Steak House, where he could get a steak and potato dinner for around three dollars. Gay hustlers, drug dealers, and users abounded on the street. Van Sant considered writing one day about this subject—which ultimately led to Mala Noche (1985). For eight months, Van Sant made the job-hunting rounds, with no success. He was slowly running out of money. He wanted to be on his own, so he didn’t write home to his father for reinforcement funds. His ship came in when he decided, out of the blue, to phone a person he had heard of but never even met—Ken Shapiro. Shapiro was an actor who had become an elementary school teacher in Brooklyn, New York. Shapiro had bought a video tape recorder and begun creating and taping satires of television series and commercials. In East Greenwich Village, he and a partner conceived of and opened the ﬁrst video theater, where they produced Channel One. This was a program of television spoofs that were not ready for prime time. It was a success that led to The Groove Tube (1974), a feature ﬁlm in living color. Produced for $400,000, it grossed more than $30 million. Shapiro relocated to Tinsel Town and teamed with Paramount Pictures and Lorne Michaels of Saturday Night Live fame. Michaels set about forging his future, and Shapiro planned his next movie for Paramount. Ironically,\n\n6\n\nGus Van Sant\n\nVan Sant has been quoted as saying that he had been told you could call Hitchcock up for a job, but he skipped over the director of Psycho (1960) and moved on to Ken Shapiro, who said “Yes” when Van Sant asked if there was a job available. Van Sant’s job was to take notes and organize materials for Shapiro and his comedy team as they worked on Shapiro’s second movie. Van Sant was paid by Paramount, a studio he wandered around while soaking in its hallowed back-in-the-day achievements. He now sums up his job as the guy who rolled the joints to give creative stimulation and inspiration to the writers. The Shapiro feature project, Ma Bell, concerned a teenager who works the telephone system to get free calls and depicts his relationship with “phone freaks,” as Parrish calls them in his biography of Van Sant. Occasionally, Van Sant would offer up a sketch idea, and it was summarily shot down by the seasoned pros. Van Sant moved out of his apartment for better digs on North Argyle Avenue in Hollywood. He shared the apartment with John Howell, an old buddy who was also interested in breaking into show business. Then Shapiro offered Van Sant the pool house at his home, which for a time Gus shared with another childhood pal, Jim Evans. Paramount was not forthcoming in support of Ma Bell, so the team began working on Groove Tube II and other movie ideas, eventually arriving at Modern Problems (1981), which was given the go-ahead at Twentieth Century Fox. Shapiro moved to Brentwood, and Van Sant had to move out of the pool house. Shapiro couldn’t give Van Sant a position on the project. He gave out jobs to all his friends, and his wife got an assistant spot, so that was it for Van Sant’s Shapiro period. The job had been part-time, so Van Sant had had time to work on his own material, and he received a sobering inside look at how the studios chew up directors and spit them out for breakfast. Shapiro gave his charge excellent advice—stay away from the studios and go indie, which was just what Van Sant now planned on doing.\n\nBECOMING GUS VAN SANT As the 1970s came to a close, and while Van Sant worked for Ken Shapiro, he continued his private study of the cinema, planning a career in ﬁlm for the future. At the local library, he read screenplays such as Citizen Kane (1941) and Jaws (1975). He was most impressed with the screenplay for Stanley Kubrick’s production of the Anthony Burgess novel A Clockwork Orange (1971). The form was unconventional and read like a poem, with the description down a narrow middle column and the dialogue stretching across the page. The lesson learned was that you could do anything you wanted to make a movie; what counted were content, story, characters, and craft.\n\nThe Traveling Artist\n\n7\n\nAlthough he hated production assistant work, Van Sant needed cash, so he toiled on Skateboard (1977) (he would later make Paranoid Park [2007], a skateboard movie like no other), directed by George Gage (Fleshburn [1984]). Next, Van Sant took Ken Shapiro’s advice and made a short, The Discipline of D.E. (1982), and a feature that didn’t become a feature, the notorious Alice in Hollywood (1981). As Van Sant slaved over the editing of Alice in Hollywood, he periodically found his ﬁnances under a strain, forcing him to take jobs that were available. During any free time, Gus would go to the movies and write screenplays. One of these, called Mister Popular (originally titled The Projectionist, but not the cult classic directed by Harry Hurwitz), concerns a high school projectionist who puts subliminal messages in audiovisual presentations. He becomes numero uno in the school through mind control. It was to be Van Sant’s next ﬁlm after the disastrous Alice in Hollywood. Although Van Sant lived near gay bars and the L.A. gay scene, he did not participate, explaining that he was in a ﬁlm world writing movies that he hoped to make someday. He continued to watch and “study” the gay hustler lifestyle but lived life through his screenwriting and ﬁlmmaking activities. Van Sant told The Advocate that he was “a late bloomer” who didn’t begin to participate in his now acknowledged sexual mode until he was around 30 years old. Van Sant was a solid Kubrick admirer, viewing the 9 A.M. show of The Shining (1980) for seven days when the ﬁlm opened at Mann’s Chinese Theater, a legendary Hollywood Boulevard theater in its own right. Ironically, just as Kubrick had told actor Vince Edwards that High Noon (1952), the classic Oscar winner, “wasn’t a very good movie,” Van Sant said the same thing about Kubrick’s attempt to make the scariest ﬁlm ever made: that it wasn’t “such a good movie.” However, because he thought he could learn and be inspired by the master’s newest motion picture, he watched it repeatedly. During 1980, Van Sant was disillusioned. Although he got an editing job here and there, he mostly temped as a secretary. It was during this process that Gus Van Sant discovered his artistic and actual home, in Portland, Oregon. Gus Van Sant senior continued his successful climb to business success. He had left one job at Warnco, then on to Consolidated Foods, Inc., as their Group Vice President. He then made the leap to owning his own business by taking over a woman’s sportswear ﬁrm and asked his son to relocate to New York City to work for one year in the company’s warehouse located in Secaucus, New Jersey. The warehouse was not far from midtown Manhattan, so Gus could get himself together for another try at big-time moviemaking. While in the factory, Gus continued taking notes for screenplays. One screenplay concerned vampires. Another was Fizzlem, concerning an honor student who becomes the town’s stumblebum. Other creative ruminations in Van Sant’s imagination were about country clubs, commuters, and\n\n8\n\nGus Van Sant\n\ndebutantes, the latter possibly inspired by the classic Bob Dylan line from Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again—“Your debutante knows what you need, but I know what you want.” On his own, Van Sant Jr. got in touch with the Cadwell Davis advertising agency, where he had worked for a decade back in the day, and procured a job as an assistant production manager for $44,000 a year, although it was basically an organizational position. Van Sant saved up all the money he could—it wasn’t much of a life, but he was heard to say that he was waiting for his cinematic break. He continued to write screenplays, practice still photography, and make short ﬁlms. My Friend (1982) was a three-minute 16mm color autobiographical ﬁlm about a sexual attraction Van Sant Jr. felt for a pal. It sports narration, like many of his features. For decades, many ﬁlm editors and ﬁlm teachers have said that when a ﬁlm isn’t working, you put in a narration. On the contrary, narration has existed since the beginning of sound ﬁlms and is a legitimate storytelling technique. Where Did She, Go? (1983), also three minutes long and in color 16mm, was about his departed grandmother, who gave him the deathbed advice to “buy IBM.”3 The seven-minute black-and-white Nightmare Typhoon (1984), also known as Hello, It’s Me, is about a caller who continuously phones the director. Van Sant also worked on his musical interests, writing songs, playing instruments, and adding sound effects like rain and thunder (which is why the sound design in Van Sant’s ﬁlms is so well done and so effective). An album of his called 18 Songs about Golf was marketed by Pop Secret Records. Van Sant’s love of music would lead to great soundtracks and his one musicthemed movie, Gus Van Sant’s Last Days (2005). This is who the young Gus van Sant was. Who he would become was a blender-mix of his sexual orientation, his artistic talent, and his love for Portland, Oregon, and the movies. He painted, sang, and wrote, but now he was also a ﬁlm director.\n\n2 To Feature or Not to Feature: The Beat Gay Mentor and the Openly Gay Opus ALICE IN HOLLYWOOD (1979) After returning from Europe and then working in Los Angeles with Ken Shapiro, Van Sant, who had directed and executed several short works, decided to make his ﬁrst feature. His original idea would come to fruition later with Mala Noche (1985), a ﬁlm about male hustlers. He shot footage on Sunset Boulevard of the men plying their trade, but only one shot eventually got into Alice in Hollywood. Van Sant scrapped the idea for a ﬁlm that would satirize the movie business. His initial concept was to do a version of Peter Pan1 in Hollywood, but that was replaced by a plan to tap into Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland,2 a fable that was beloved by hippies and the drug culture and that spawned the Jefferson Airplane’s hit song “White Rabbit” (Carroll as a photographer shot pictures of very young children that got him in trouble with the authorities). Van Sant called the adaptation a combination of Carroll’s work and Voltaire’s Candide, in which an optimistic young man becomes disillusioned when he sees corruption in the world. Van Sant had always been interested in street youth and underground cultures. He began hanging out on the Sunset Strip, which by the late 1970s no longer had the thriving hippie and music communities it had enjoyed in the 1960s. The famed Whiskey A Go Go had launched Johnny Rivers, the Doors, and other legends of the 1960s, but, by the end of the 1970s, punk music played in the hallowed hall. The Strip in the 1970s was inhabited by bums, druggies, and culture freaks—the lowest of the low. Van Sant, who had a nearby apartment that contained a cot and his ﬁlm equipment for production of Alice in Hollywood, got to know many of the Strip’s denizens and began making mental notes for a feature.\n\n10\n\nGus Van Sant\n\nAs an avid movie-watcher, Van Sant chose the genre of screwball comedy, an offshoot of the comedy ﬁlm, which utilizes farce, rapid pacing, and machine-gun dialogue. Screwball comedies from Hollywood’s studio system include Bringing up Baby (1938), The Lady Eve (1941), and To Be or Not to Be (1942). The script for Alice in Hollywood involves a young naïve actress who tries to break into show business. She is surrounded by the underground characters that populate the once-glamorous boulevard and is given advice and attention. She can’t get an audition no matter how hard she tries until ﬁnally one day she gets a “job” in a porn ﬁlm. Later on, she meets a television actor and still later has an opportunity to begin her career on a television show featuring a sleazy actor she had met. After becoming a success, Van Sant’s heroine refuses to hobnob with her former friends on the Strip as the ﬁlm becomes a morality tale. To raise the majority of the money, Van Sant Jr. went to his major investor, Van Sant Sr. The complete budget came in at $20,000. No one was paid. The investment was for equipment, production, and postproduction. Van Sant installed an editing bench in his tiny ﬂat, which was rapidly ﬁlling up with the footage for his feature. Occasionally the director would take his cast and small crew to his fav eatery, Johnnie’s Steak House, which doubled as a couple of restaurant sets in the ﬁlm. Van Sant’s hovel was also used for an apartment scene in the picture. For a dolly, a wheelchair was “procured” from a local hospital, and the cameraman was pushed down Sunset Boulevard to get desired shots. Director of photography Jean de Segonzac moved on to be a proliﬁc television director and as cameraman shot the indie classic Laws of Gravity (1992), Where Are We? Our Trip through America (1993), and Normal Life (1996). Tom Yore, the soundman, did sound and music on another indie classic, the documentary Hoop Dreams (1994). Everyone did his or her own make-up in a car or in the stairwell of a building. To relax, the team smoked pot. The shoot ended just in time for Thanksgiving, as the members of the ensemble waited for the ﬁlm to come out and launch their careers. Van Sant had a screening of the footage that lasted for hours and hours. As he slaved over the editing table, it became apparent that the ﬁlm was not a 90-minute or two-hour feature—it wasn’t any kind of feature ﬁlm. So, editor Van Sant (who would go on to edit or be part of the postproduction team on most his ﬁlms) kept trimming and altering the timeline as well as adding and subtracting scenes until the ﬁlm had a running time of 45 minutes—a deadly timeframe. A 45-minute movie is too long to be a short and too short to be a feature. A half-hour ﬁlm is a recognized ﬁlm form, and a 10-minute ﬁlm was legitimate back in the days when short ﬁlms were programmed with features. Forty-ﬁve minutes was, and still is, to the hapless ﬁlm student who refuses to cut a project or thesis down, box ofﬁce and ﬁlm festival dead-on-arrival.\n\nTo Feature or Not to Feature\n\n11\n\nEventually, Van Sant trimmed the 45-minute version to just under a half hour (29 minutes). He couldn’t sell the ﬁlm even when Ken Shapiro introduced him to industry types at 20th Century-Fox. He tried to enter it in the L.A. and Atlanta ﬁlm festivals—but it was rejected by both. Alice in Hollywood was never really completed or shown publicly. Of course, the investors (mainly Gus’s dad) lost all their money. The lesson was a painful one, but Van Sant learned that he needed a viable story about a topic that meant something to him. Eventually, this would lead him to Mala Noche. But Gus was becoming Gus Van Sant, ﬁlm director. He was ﬂexible on location, always ready and willing to shoot what was going on around him. A car crash on the Strip was ﬁlmed and incorporated into the ﬁlm. The cast reported that he understood acting and nurtured the performances. He was easygoing and likeable. Although the ﬁlm was a mess, it proved he could make a movie and had a vision of the world that would attract future audiences.\n\nTHE DISCIPLINE OF D.E. (1982) Van Sant had long been a hero worshiper of the Beats,3 especially the junkie who was a writer or the writer who was a junkie, depending how you perceived William S. Burroughs. The iconic and openly gay Beat ﬁgure was a mentor to Van Sant, who would later put Burroughs on ﬁlm in Drugstore Cowboy. For years he wanted to adapt the short story “DE,” and, after the disaster of Alice in Hollywood, he decided now was the time. The nine-minute, 16mm black-and-white sound ﬁlm featured Tom Sherohman, Michael L. McManus, Frank Birney, and David Worden. Sherohman wrote Modern Problems (1981), directed by Van Sant’s old boss Ken Shapiro, and played roles in Vernie (2004), To Lie in Green Pastures (2005), and Flourtown (2008). McManus appeared in The Kentucky Fried Movie (1977) (a competitor of Groove Tube), Poltergeist (1982), and Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol (1987). Frank Birney was also in Modern Problems and had roles in Jennifer 8 (1992) and Dave (1993). Worden was living with Sherohman, and his role in the ﬁlm, in which he played a student, is his only acting credit in a motion picture to date. The narration was spoken by Ken Shapiro. The story concerns a colonel who creates a calendar that has 10 months with 26 days allotted for each month. DE stands for “doing easy.” Throughout the colonel’s segment, he demonstrates ways to do everyday tasks in an easy, non-energy-draining manner. The Discipline of D.E. ends with the colonel transformed into Wyatt Earp as he schools a gunslinger on how to win in a gun battle. An offbeat comedy, the ﬁlm was shot by Van Sant with a handheld camera. He handled the actors with ease and grace and made them feel at home in their parts—a trademark of his work as a director to date. Van Sant’s interest\n\n12\n\nGus Van Sant\n\nin close-ups of objects is in play here and would continue with ﬁlms to come. On-screen titles are also used, and there is a focus on the male anatomy, with a man zipping and rezipping his ﬂy. Concerned about his lack of experience in ﬁlming a shootout, Van Sant storyboarded the 10 necessary shots. Utilizing drawings became a comfortable way for Van Sant (like Scorsese, De Palma, and Hitchcock) to work out sequences. The Discipline of D.E. was shown at the New York Film Festival in 1978 and was well received.4 When Burroughs appeared on Saturday Night Live in 1981, the short was almost aired, but at nine minutes it was considered too long for the rigors of network television scheduling. Most, if not all, great directors have a DNA recognizable from their earliest work. Van Sant in these early years was ﬁnding his style, based on his artistic instincts and inﬂuences. The ﬁlm begins with “Gus Van Sant Presents.” The “Jr.” is absent. The title image is milk from a broken glass dripping off a table; the sound of this action is heard. Fade-to-black—card: “from the story by William S. Burroughs.” From the outset, Van Sant is an assured and competent structuralist building the spine or skeleton of his nine-minute ﬁlm. The narration introduces the colonel. Shots and props deal with the man’s organizational skills. Ken Shapiro’s narration is spoken in Van Sant’s tone of choice—deadpan. The colonel writes precisely in a book about life in a Pullman car. Trains ﬁgure predominately in Mala Noche (1985), Paranoid Park (2007), and other Van Sant ﬁlms, either in image, sound, or both. Traveling, the road, and the Beat aesthetic are embraced by the young director, born too late to take an active part in the Beat Generation. His relationship with Burroughs and this story cinematically achieve a way of living the lifestyle through art. The colonel goes back in time and is “jolted back to the now.” The actor playing the colonel recalls the face of Udo Kier, the actor often used by Rainer Werner Fassbinder and who appears in Van Sant’s My Own Private Idaho (1991) and Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (1993). The black-and-white cinematography by Van Sant is clean, simple, and conscious of light as a still photographer would see it. The colonel begins to practice DE. An action such as throwing crumpled pieces of paper backward into a trash receptacle is described as replicating a Zen5 master’s use of a bow and arrow. Zen was an interest of the Beats, and the reference here is to the classic Buddhistinspired text Zen in the Art of Archery (1953), by Eugen Herrigel. This and books such as Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance (1974) by Robert M. Pirsig embrace the premise that one must ﬁnd the simplest path to complete knowledge on a subject. DE is Zen presented with dry humor. The state of relaxation during the procession of life, again a life principle of the Buddhist doctrine, is stated. The structuring of the short continues with a card that states, “The Colonel Issues Beginners DE.” A series of examples are given. The funniest is a student taking a large reel-to-reel tape recorder off his desk and placing it out of the way under his bathroom\n\nTo Feature or Not to Feature\n\n13\n\nsink. The narration is precise, ﬁlled with literary alliterations and metaphors. Repetition, the lifeblood of experimental cinema, presents practice. Picking up a cup of hot tea ends in spilling the steaming liquid on the duchess character. (Even Cowgirls Get the Blues also contains a duchess character.) This action/accident is shown in the next cut. A shot of a man zipping up his blue jeans with commentary on how to do this in the simplest way becomes a reference to the album cover of the Rolling Stones’ Sticky Fingers,6 which is a black-and-white photograph of a man in blue jeans—the zipper area prominent in the shot. The outward and direct gay image has the viewer staring at the area of a man’s “package.” The zipping implies that the penis can be taken out and shown to the audience, although it isn’t—it teases. A series of shots show a young man tripping and banging into objects. We are told the DE way is to go back and repeat—again the stress on repetition. We are instructed to “Get back on course and do it again.” We then see two shots of a man with a space helmet that contain a reﬂection intercut with a shot of the moon’s surface and the earth in the background. These may be an homage to Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). We are even told to pretend we are in a movie, a self-referential trope well used by avant-gardists. The concept of doing an action again is compared to doing a retake in a ﬁlm which makes the viewer wonder how many takes Van Sant made of each shot, another self-referential device. A shot of the young man doing nothing while sitting in a chair provides an opportunity to discuss DE and the art of doing nothing. The shot is a long take to support this mini-Godardian essay on the essence and ease of doing nothing the DE way. A structural cut-toblack changes to a sequence about the Western gunﬁght and DE. A man who appears to be the actor who played the colonel is now playing Wyatt Earp, saying in what appears to be lip synch, “It’s not the ﬁrst shot that counts, it’s the ﬁrst shot that hits.” The Discipline of D.E. ends with a Western scene. This is Van Sant’s early attempt at the Western. He would add elements of the genre to My Own Private Idaho (1991) and Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (1993). The sequence has Earp counseling a young man on how to win in a gunﬁght. Van Sant is precise and plays out the scene in just the right number of shots—a step-bystep account of DE at work in a Western bar shootout. The ﬁlm ends. The cast is listed, and three people are thanked, including Van Sant’s former classmates James Evans and John Howell.\n\nMALA NOCHE (1985) Van Sant created his signature work, Mala Noche, in Portland, Oregon. This ﬁlm, which includes male hustlers and gay sex, preceded My Own Private Idaho (1991)—the director’s breakout movie. Film history is a careful science, and too many who may have seen a Van Sant movie or two are unaware of Mala Noche and its connection to the major body of his work.\n\n14\n\nGus Van Sant\n\nThis ﬁlm rises above the ﬁrst efforts of Coppola’s Dementia 13 (1963) (actually, Coppola directed two nudie feature ﬁlms before that—The Bellboy and the Playgirls [1962] and Tonight for Sure [1962], but he doesn’t like to acknowledge them); De Palma’s feature debut, Murder à la Mod (1968); Kubrick’s ﬁrst feature, Fear and Desire (1953); and Scorsese’s long-form debut, Who’s That Knocking at My Door (1969).Van Sant had the canny knowledge to direct a ﬁlm that, while still decidedly amateur, was remarkably free, with some notable exceptions, of ﬁlm student or novice ﬁngerprints and sand traps. Van Sant got a high percentage of what he wanted on the screen, always an accomplishment for any director, experienced or inexperienced, working with a big, small, or “no” budget. This is an essential ﬁlm for anyone who wants to study Gus Van Sant and is available in a comprehensive Criterion DVD release. Mala Noche begins with a black-and-white vista reminiscent of a John Ford Western. The montage that opens Mala Noche features a ﬁrst shot that allows the viewer to experience a self-referential, self-reﬂective accidental moment, as drops of water kiss the upper left-hand regions of the camera lens while a guitar plays a sleepy but haunting bluesy melody and the sound effect of a moving boxcar train is heard. From inside the train a point-of-view shot is presented, passing a barn, then revealing a blur of trees. A close-up of Johnny, a young Mexican man (Doug Cooeyate in, up to this point, his only screen performance), is followed by a second Mexican man warming his hands over a Bunsen burner. Then, there is an invisible cut to the next shot, where the camera moves up to him rubbing his hands to keep them from freezing. The montage continues with the ﬁrst young man lit in deep chiaroscuro as he reads a comic book, then a medium close-up of his face turning to look out of the open space of the train. Another point-of-view shot reveals the traveling imagery he witnesses. The camera gets close to his face as the traveling shot continues while the sound of the train rumbling over railroad tracks persists. The young gazer’s face is repeated. Cut to black. A proﬁle shot of a lit cigarette jumps on as the titles begin, and the music is still bluesy but quiet—a guitar riff can be heard, along with the gentle tinkling of a soft melodic piano. Credits. The white squiggly lines give the sequence a handmade quality. Then, borrowing from his beloved experimental ﬁlmmaking brethren, a quarter-slice image of down-and-outers appears in the upper-right-hand corner. Walt, a young Caucasian male (named after the author of the novel, Walt Curtis) played by Tim Streeter (who appeared in two 1990 21 Jump Street television episodes) appears. Streeter looks like he was separated at birth from River Phoenix (Stand By Me [1986], Running on Empty [1988], Dogﬁght [1991]), who would appear in Van Sant’s masterpiece, My Own Private Idaho (1991) before dying of a drug overdose in front of Johnny Depp and partners’ Viper Room on L.A.’s Sunset Strip in West Hollywood. The character\n\nTo Feature or Not to Feature\n\n15\n\nworks in a low-rent convenience store and is the ﬁlm’s protagonist/narrator. Walt has sexual longings for Johnny, the Mexican hustler, and tries to seduce him every chance he gets. The store is a breeding ground for old-school alkies like the one who acknowledges to his partner and the viewer that Walt “likes men.” A time cut7 ﬁnds Johnny crouching in front of a garage or a car dealership. As Johnny talks to Walt, subtitles translate the conversation as the protagonist tries to get “his prey” to stay in his apartment. Streeter’s performance and the creation of the character by Van Sant, the screenwriter, embody a sweetness; he is not a vulture but a lonely, hopelessly romantic, failed Romeo. The sequence ends with a cut-to-black.8 Van Sant uses black to divide his ﬁlm. Very popular among ﬁlm students, black dividers provide structure and avoid opticals such as fades-to-black9 and dissolves.10 They also allow the creator to go from moment to moment or scene to scene or sequence to sequence freely and without elaborate narrative transitions. The technique can be deliberate or required because the coverage or narrative linking material was not available during the editing process. Fade from black11 to the image of Walt sitting at the bar with a Hispanic woman, Betty (Nyla McCarthy in her ﬁrst and only performance to date) embraces a conversation of Walt’s romantic feelings for Johnny. The stark blackand-white cinematography and Hollywood style shot/reverse shot12 covers a discussion led by Betty, who introduces the possibility of ﬁnding Johnny as she blows smoke into the air. Here, the smoke is not used for diffusion, but Van Sant was surely aware of the practice and boldly rejects it for his run and gun guerrilla ﬁlmmaking13 approach and commitment to a realistic and evocative atmosphere. Time cut. A car pulls up. Walt walks to the door of a video emporium. Intercut of a more-than-slightly-tipsy man sweet-talking Betty, who is sitting shotgun as this street trash tries to make time with her. Walt walks through blinding pools of light into the noisy video game emporium, where he ﬁnds Johnny playing Pole Position.14 From a psychoanalytical point of view, the name is highly allusive. Johnny discusses leaving the club in Spanish with his Mexican pal as white subtitles light up the lower third of the frame. This makes Mala Noche a partially foreign-language ﬁlm. The realism is worth the effort of reading the titles. Too few ﬁlmmakers have the courage to go this route and instead have foreigners speaking English with an accent. Some directors choose a British accent (this is often used for Roman soldier characters in religious epics). Stark intercuts15 are supported by clacking and whirling sounds transmitted by the now-primitive, then state-of-the-art video games. Walt expresses concern over Johnny—the object of his desire. On the game screen, Johnny’s “car” is demolished and graphically indicated as a crash-and-burn symbol. This can represent Walt’s efforts to build a successful relationship with the boy, who looks like a Mexican facsimile of Keanu Reeves’ character in My\n\n16\n\nGus Van Sant\n\nOwn Private Idaho (1991). The two pairs of men have an eerie connection. Both ﬁlms are about male hustlers, so Van Sant may have deliberately or subconsciously cast Streeter and Cooeyate to link the ﬁlms. Stark intercuts are supported by clacking and whirling sounds transmitted by the full-size game boxes. Walla16 voices play over a two-shot favoring Johnny as Walt expresses concern over the object of his desire. Walt stomps up to the car. Johnny, his friend, and Walt have a confrontation as a cutback returns to the failed pickup. Betty and the street trash exchange words, and out of nervousness she says to the low-life, “We’re going to cook him for dinner.” Betty suggests brown rice and vegetables, classic hippie cuisine. Walt ﬁnally convinces Johnny to leave with him. Johnny invites his friend, and Walt happily agrees. Cut to a grocery store shopping expedition. The menu changes. Hard cut to Betty’s apartment. Walt stokes up the ﬁre in a stove contraption outside the kitchen space. The preparation of the meal is in progress. Cinematographer John J. Campbell (My Own Private Idaho [1991], Even Cowgirls Get the Blues [1993], The New Age [1994]) served Van Sant’s vision by powerfully utilizing front and backlight to create a stark image in contrast to Walt’s tender personality. Mala Noche is truly a black-and-white ﬁlm. Before dinner is served, Johnny jumps up as he suddenly remembers that he didn’t give the key to Roberto. Cut to “A hard rain is going to fall”-type rain right out of a B movie17 ﬁlm noir18 occurs. Johnny runs up to Roberto, blames Walt (whom he refers to as a “faggot”—a line he repeatedly spews). Walt is excited about Roberto, who is carrying a boom box sitting in the front seat. They drive off. Time cut to the next scene. The meal begins with the dropping of pasta into a pot of steaming, boiling water. There is a discussion of where the men traveled as they hunch over a map. A train rushes by in a ﬂashback, with sound design that emphasizes their desperate story told in a choker close-up spoken in Spanish and translated by the white subtitles—a ﬁght and the vicious beating of the Mexicans are described. The ﬁlling of the screen with the human face is reminiscent of Carl Dreyer’s The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928). Walt translates to the pretty Betty, who is decked out in masculine clothing, but Van Sant never reveals whether she is a lesbian or just a stylish young woman. The Mexican men are attracted to her and remark that she is pretty as they check her out. There is a dramatic emphasis between a two-shot of the listeners and the choker close-up,19 which holds the enormous face in its gaze. A time cut ﬁnds Walt in a death conversation about experiencing the end of life though a story about McDonald’s hamburgers—a hidden metaphor for the harrowing life of the street hustler and the concept of a “meat market.” Van Sant would later create what critics call his death trilogy—Gerry (2002), Elephant (2003), and Gus Van Sant’s Last Days (2005). His next ﬁlm, Paranoid Park (2007), is about death, as well, as, in a sense, is Milk\n\nTo Feature or Not to Feature\n\n17\n\n(2008). There is death in many of his ﬁlms, and, like many directors, Van Sant has his own view. Death comes swiftly, when you don’t expect it. It comes in forms that can’t be predicted. Mexican music segues into a joyous dance; then there is another divisional structural cut to black. Structural ﬁlmmakers take up the concern of structure within the frame. Here Van Sant experiments with editorial structure. Later in his experimental period, especially on Elephant (2003), he would bring the inﬂuence of structural ﬁlm20 into his directorial vision, inspired by a lifetime of watching experimental ﬁlms. Van Sant also skillfully integrates Hollywood cinematic grammar with the handheld style seen in documentaries and by using the language of the experimental ﬁlm. These converge to form his personal style. Cut out to another rainy street right out of a B movie. Is Mala Noche a B movie? It was made inexpensively but was not meant to be shown with another movie. It has a controversial topic, like many Hollywood Bs of the past. It’s in black-and-white, like most B movies of the period. Is it a ﬁlm noir? Who is the femme fatale, and who is the doomed man? Betty and Walt don’t ﬁt the format. And who is the victim? Many scenes take place at night. The lighting is reminiscent of the ﬁlm noir style. As a cineaste, Van Sant has seen much of the canon of American and International cinema. He is also is familiar with ﬁlm noir and other cinema movements. As an eclectic and complex ﬁlm director, he borrows from what he has seen to create his style for each ﬁlm. Walt’s narration comes over black—he is then seen in a chiaroscuro choker close-up pessimistically discussing the unsafe driving habits of Mexicans. Close-up of a speedometer radio dial moving steadily left to right. Johnny is ecstatic about speed. There is a metaphor for speed and the rush of sexual activity. The vehicle is intercut with Johnny smiling as the memory of playing Pole Position is intercut visibly, intended to be a warm thought from a short time ago. The Mexicans enjoy the thrill of Johnny as the “Downhill Racer,” not on skis but in an aging boatmobile owned by Walt. At one point, Johnny is so out of control of the vehicle (Walt’s car) that he crashes and scrapes along the metal guard rail on the side of the road. Time cut. The car is stopped, and a feverish deal is in progress for Walt to penetrate Johnny’s bum. A spokesman, a manager, better known as a pimp, barters with the desperately-in-love Walt. The storyteller exits the car, enters the rooming house with his eye, and ﬂies up the stairs. The starkness of the photography details and emphasizes the human struggle going on in the out-of-date vehicle. At Johnny’s apartment, they are met by a female house martinet. “No visitors!” she shouts at them. Her performance is over the top and yet appropriate; she is just doing her job. A reverse angle is made. She is most unattractive inside and outside compared to the male beauties she confronts.\n\n18\n\nGus Van Sant\n\nTime cut. The boys are on the street. Walt, an otherwise sweet and nice guy, expresses his venom, calling the woman a “bitch,” a “fat cow,” using language to counter the words he used to the supple Mexicans he loves in a romantic and sexual manner. In the adaption process, Van Sant softens Walt’s character to suit his own sweet and gentle manner. This outburst is more consistent with the real Walt Curtis. Walt takes the other Mexican boy home. He tells him to be comfortable and says that he will return after completing an hour’s work. The boy looks tentative and nervous, like a victim in a ﬁlm noir ﬂick. He checks out the apartment, which is alien to his native culture. Church bells from an outside source ring, augmenting the image by imparting a religious aura. Walt is at work, and he cleans the ﬁlthy toilet bowls with an equally grungy mop. The bells ringing in the background, with echoed heavenly ambiance are in contrast to the graphic sex in the ﬁlm, which at times makes the point that those engaging in gay sex sing and ﬂy with the angels. To connect Walt with the sex he is thinking about, editor Van Sant intercuts the two actions, giving us a choice of views. Van Sant may not condone male hustling, but he clearly understands and has observed this speciﬁc aspect of gay life. To Van Sant, homosexuals are simply a part of the larger human family. “They all say that I’m openly gay,” Van Sant explained to Gary Indiana in a Village Voice interview published on October 1, 1991, “but they put that in as a little political footnote. . . . They don’t say anything about gayness. They just say, ‘He’s openly gay.’ They relate it a little bit to something, but they just get through with that a bit.” Walt glances up toward his apartment periodically while he works in the trashy package store. His sexual drive is building—the broom he sweeps with metaphorically becomes an extension of his sexual organ. Van Sant, like David Lynch and all good total ﬁlmmakers, is a master of sound design. Here the dominant use of a train off in the distance and the church bells make a strong statement about the director’s point of view. The train represents the Mexicans’ endless ride—with a stop—then it starts again. The bells are also a constant reminder of the public’s sense of right and wrong and what behavior will send you to heaven and what will send you to purgatory or the ﬁres of hell. In one scene, a guitar plays on the soundtrack. Crickets make their chirpy, two-syllable sound as accompaniment. Camera movement in Mala Noche is masterfully executed. When Walt enters the apartment, a pan moving in a backward direction picks up the image of Walt and then the refrigerator. Movement is expressive in cinema—this one speaks to desire and physicality. Van Sant brilliantly portrays Walt’s nature. This is a true story, but the director never makes value judgments, just pours insight into this multifaceted character. Bells and trains—the bells repeat endlessly.\n\nTo Feature or Not to Feature\n\n19\n\nThe photography ranges from light to dark. Here we are faced with glare that hurts our eyes, as if we had been in a dark bar for hours, then stepped out to a burning street, as in the cinematography that the late great Conrad Hall (In Cold Blood [1967], Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid [1969], American Beauty [1999]) accomplished in John Huston’s Fat City (1972). In Principal Photography: Interviews with Feature Film Cinematographers, Hall explains that he wants the viewer to experience reality. If a character is out in a bright sunny day, then spends time in a dark bar, when that person leaves the bar, the sunlight bearing down hurts both the character’s and the viewer’s eyes. The overall visual impact of the lighting in Mala Noche achieves this effect, giving the viewer a sense of time and place along with a Hitchcockian impression of voyeurism into a world most viewers haven’t seen in person, only in bad movies. The cinema has been deﬁned by theorists and critics as based on a voyeuristic act. Alfred Hitchcock was one of the cinema’s greatest voyeurs; it drove his dark vision. Van Sant would remake Psycho, a Hitchcock masterwork in which the audience watches as a young woman is stabbed to death in the shower. Water boils in a pot. This image relates to or reminds the viewer of the earlier shot of the pasta pot boiling and can be a metaphor for Walt’s anxious state or the physicality of the act of sex. The boy is sleeping; Walt makes coffee. The intercutting between the two characters and their action fuses them. The boiling liquid continues like an orgasm that can’t be contained. A long pan connects Van Sant to long-take masters such as Theo Angelopoulos (Anaparstasi [1970], Days of 36 [1972], Ulysses’ Gaze [1995]), Michelangelo Antonioni (L’Avventura, La Notte [1961], The Passenger [1975]), Godard (Breathless [1960], Weekend [1969], Notre Musique [2004]), and other international masters who used the uninterrupted take to control pace, create a distinctive mood, and draw the viewer into the ﬁlm. This works only for those who are willing, but those who are not are missing one of the cinema’s most valuable tools—suspending time. Warhol’s Sleep (1963), Empire (1964), and especially Blow-Job (1963) have undoubtedly inﬂuenced Van Sant, who copied the wizard of pop art and movies, doing everything but creating his version of The Factory, a silver-walled facility where art and movies were created and endless parties we held. Warhol was an inspiration to Van Sant. The sound design turns on its power once again as the aural wash of a train going by presents the reality of the Mexicans in their hobo lifestyle. A “By” occurs when a moving sound passes by a locked-in recording device such as a microphone, allowing the viewer/audience to feel as if this aural occurrence is happening to them as well as to the characters in the ﬁlm. Sound is a very powerful medium, and Van Sant utilizes the form in all his movies to get inside the head of the viewer.\n\n20\n\nGus Van Sant\n\nNaked actresses, most commonly displaying their breasts, abound in American cinema, sometimes for story and character reasons, other times for exploitation. Less common but also sometimes asked of the actress is full frontal nudity, where the focus is on the triangle of hair covering the female organ, leaving the more gynecological views for the porn industry. Male nudity has different standards. The bare chest and bottom are common, but the penis rarely is seen in commercial or independent movies. When it is, and actor Richard Gere may hold the record, it is ﬂaccid, without the length the porn industry uses as standard. The erect penis has been banned since the inception of the modern censorship (or monitoring) systems. (Two exception are Shortbus [2006] and Bruno [2009]). In Mala Noche, Van Sant respects reality, and when Walt is sexually excited, we see his erect penis. This is an art ﬁlm, so quick ﬂashes are enough, but the brevity of the shot does little if anything to affect the shock value. So Walt undresses, his penis erect, and gets in bed with the boy who is the subject of his ardor. The train sounds continue. The camera spins around the action; the pictorial contrast is high. Walt gets a jar of Vaseline to aid his rear entry. Flashes of body parts—again the scene is voyeuristic, the camera wildly capturing and reporting the event. The editing is jagged and rapid. A boiling image communicates the obvious. Some critics and theorists would classify Mala Noche as a road movie21 like Easy Rider (1969), Two Lane, Blacktop (1971), and the aptly titled ﬁlm Road Movie (1974). There certainly are enough scenes on the road, as well as train scenes and sounds, but in the end Mala Noche is neither porn nor blockbuster nor commercial or international—it is a relationship movie about the act of being alive with all the attendant pain, sorrow, and joy. Mala Noche should be considered a street movie. As Walt struts the streets as if he owns them, a voice-over tells us what he is feeling throughout the ﬁlm.22 This literary device is utilized in low-budget ﬁlms (Stanley Kubrick used it in his ﬁrst two amateur features, Fear and Desire [1953] and Killer’s Kiss [1955]). He was a supporter of narration throughout his career. Narration has its artistic applications and is used in down-and-dirty moviemaking, as well. The ﬁlmmaker does not need synch equipment—sound can be recorded on any machine and transferred (in this case on magnetic ﬁlm) and adjusted accordingly. The editor, here Van Sant, can cut images to the dialogue, music, and effects without dialogue, and when there is dialogue in this ﬁlm it is mainly looped. The actors spoke into a tape recorder while watching the screen. Van Sant knows all the tricks, blocking mouths with compositional elements, having a character speak while the camera is on the other’s back view. Obscuring the lip movement is the goal, but Van Sant is making a controversial movie, and these strategies are a way of getting the movie made. It’s the story and characters that motivated him to create Mala Noche, and he used any means necessary to get his ideas on ﬁlm.\n\nTo Feature or Not to Feature\n\n21\n\nStreet movies as a genre include The Children of Times Square (1986), Streetwise (1984), Streetwise (1988), and the cable television series The Wire (2002–2008) and The Shield (2002–2009).23 Van Sant knows the streets. Usually, street movies are about drugs or the homeless, but Mala Noche is about street people looking for sex, drugs, food—survival. Either Walt is wearing second-hand clothing or he’s worn out his iconic outﬁt featuring a ﬂoor-length coat and a plaid shirt. The wear of the coat is physical texture. Mala Noche is ﬁlled with human texture of life on the bum. Walt is a young man with pride, although many disdain him. He is above them all, running a store that looks like a warehouse, offering, booze, smokes, candy, any junk a convenience store carries, but this is no 7/11—it is the lowest of the low. What hours does Walt work? Why does he constantly go back to work, seemingly to spend all of his young life among family—the family of man that only God could love? Family is the theme of the majority of Van Sant ﬁlms. They could be called dysfunctional families, but they are beyond that—a tribe—the unwashed, the ignored, the powerless, the abused and the abusers—this is the heart of many Gus Van Sant movies. Clouds move across the sky. No matter what the location in a Gus Van Sant ﬁlm, this director is obsessed with capturing, either at high speed or slow, the image of ominous, sometimes majestic clouds passing over. It is as if God is sending down a directive. Van Sant is also a devotee of experimental ﬁlmmaking,24 especially of the 1960s and 1970s, and this ongoing signature may be his homage to ﬁlmmakers such as Stan Brakhage (Mothlight [1963], Lovemaking [1968], The Riddle of Lumen [1972], Bruce Baillie (Castro Street [1966], Quick Billy [1971], The P-38 Pilot [1990], and Ken Jacobs (Little Stabs at Happiness [1960], The Blond Cobra [1963], Tom, Tom, The Piper’s Son [1969]). Landscape shots are also present in Gus Van Sant ﬁlms. They often capture the scope, terrain, and neighborhoods of Portland, Oregon. They, too, have an avant-garde ﬁlm connection. Film scholar Scott MacDonald has dedicated an entire book, The Garden in the Machine: A Field Guide to Independent Films about Place, to the subject. A female sings a song in Spanish. The language complements the ethnicity of the characters. Portland, Oregon, is as synonymous with Van Sant as Saint Petersburg is with Dziga Vertov,25 Dublin, Ireland, with James Joyce,26 and New York City with Woody Allen, Martin Scorsese, and Sidney Lumet. Portland embraces each ﬁlm with its mentality and physicality (at times), but most of all it speaks to the character within the people in the ﬁlm. This identiﬁcation is cultural, social, and political. Home is where the heart is, and Portland, Oregon, is Van Sant’s spiritual home, as well as a place to live. Oregonians have a liveand-let-live philosophy that permeates Van Sant’s soul and manner. There are many images, signs, and symbols that stamp a Gus Van Sant ﬁlm. One is the side-part haircut he always sports that goes back to his youth\n\n22\n\nGus Van Sant\n\nand is still his style in middle age. This represents adolescence—most young men’s ﬁrst hair cut or, more accurately, hair comb when Mommy is no longer allowed to touch it. Van Sant is forever young and stays attracted to young men. This is not deviancy but admiration, love, and a hope that puberty will never end. Walt is an on-screen surrogate for Van Sant, just as Jean-Pierre Léaud27 was for François Truffaut in a series of ﬁlms featuring the character Antoine Doinel. In Mean Streets (1973), Harvey Keitel28 as Charlie Cappa plays the spirit and personality of Martin Scorsese. Keitel, like Walt in Mala Noche, shoots home movies. Who is ﬁlming the movie? Scorsese remains invisible (except for one frame in the opening home movies), but we see Walt capturing the proceedings before his eyes on camera. By transference, Walt becomes Gus. The ﬁlmic results of the home movies are from an amateur. Van Sant, like Scorsese, studied ﬁlm in college, but Van Sant had other inputs; both had the skill of drawing. Scorsese respected the avant-garde,29 but Van Sant embraced it. Both Van Sant and Scorsese understand the language and grammar of the home movie; the shaky cam, jumping from subject to subject, the momentto-moment action, the anxious and at times distracted “directorial eye,” playing with the camera apparatus as if it were a toy. The life of a young gay man includes negotiation. Dealing with a male prostitute for a man is no different from the endless deal-making that goes on hondling 30 with a female prostitute. The services are similar because, as the American youth shouted during the Clinton/Lewinsky mess,31 “Sex is sex!” Walt, an experienced patron in this area, gets to Johnny through his friend. Illegals deal with avoiding the law on a daily basis, and here Johnny eludes a cop. Insert of a clock. Metaphorically, time refers to the running length of the ﬁlm (78 minutes) or life expectancy or the voyage from youth to death. The store is so shabby that a bottle on a rope is used to open and close it. The Mexican faces are carefully photographed in a gritty documentary-like style, with no respect to screen direction. An abrupt cut to black. The Mexican cinema has long been strong and has produced many actors, directors, and craftspeople. John Huston (The Treasure of the Sierra Madre [1948], The Misﬁts [1961], Under the Volcano [1984]) and Sam Peckinpah (Ride the High Country [1962], The Wild Bunch [1969], Cross of Iron [1977]) were two unlikely models; both were macho men who despised gays and found a deep kinship with the land, people, and culture of Mexico. Van Sant displays here a fascination with the people and culture. The Mexican music in this ﬁlm is right out of Huston or El Jefe (Peckinpah). Mexico is featured in many ﬁlms, including Old Gringo (1989), The Mexican (2001), and Once Upon a Time in Mexico (2003), as well as in many back-in-the-day Westerns directed by the likes of Budd Boetticher (The Cimarron Kid [1952], The Tall T\n\nTo Feature or Not to Feature\n\n23\n\n[1957], Comanche Station [1960]), Howard Hawks (Red River [1948], Rio Bravo [1959], Rio Lobo [1970]), and Sergio Leone (A Fistful of Dollars [1964], The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly [1966], Once Upon a Time in the West [1968]). The car owned by Walt sports Oregon plates. A clear view of a license plate also appears in Van Sant’s Psycho (1998), but in that ﬁlm the numbers and letters have meaning for the actors, especially Anne Heche (Donnie Brasco [1997], Wag the Dog [1997], Birth [2004]) as the tragic Marion Crane. A shot of Walt in a landscape takes on the aesthetics of a classical painting. Walt fancies himself a hipster. He often wears sunglasses, as in skillions of movies, indie and Hollywood, as he walks down the Portland streets like a big shot, again recalling Harvey Keitel in Mean Streets. The on-screen representative projects a mind-image the director has of himself that is internal rather than based on reality. Sunglasses have been worn by many hipster actors, including Steve McQueen (The Magniﬁcent Seven [1960], The Great Escape [1963], Papillon [1973]), Tom Cruise (Risky Business [1983], Top Gun [1986], Jerry Maguire [1996]), and, most notably, Marlon Brando (A Streetcar Named Desire [1951], On the Waterfront [1954], The Godfather [1972]). Here they are utilized ironically. To put it in street terms, Walt is the king of shit-town. He waves to everyone like an American president on a visit or out campaigning. The shades make him a star. He swaggers, and the glasses represent his conﬁdence. Johnny strikes a pose like a muscleman. He is well built but skinny, no meat on the bone, so he looks silly, his six-pack more like one can of brew cut in half. A scene containing a waterfall reminds us of countless Hollywood movies, especially those featuring nature boy Johnny Weissmuller as Tarzan (who had no confusion about his sexuality, showing his stuff to students and actresses underwater and hoping for a romp in the hay later). Many movies feature waterfalls, such as Niagara (1953), Splendor in the Grass (1961), and Dr. No (1962); there are also many paintings, including “The Waterfall” by Shingei, “Kaaterskill Falls,” by Thomas Cole, and “Amazon,” by Lysack Gennadiy. Van Sant knows how to use his art and cinema history training to his best advantage. The guitar and whistling lend a haunting splendor to the shot and the scene. As if he were in a Warner Bros. gangster ﬁlm such as The Public Enemy (1931), Little Caesar (1931), or High Sierra (1941), Johnny takes to ﬁring the weapon as if it had been born in his hand. He acts like a gangster or a cowboy (both shoot guns—one drives a car, the other rides a horse), blasting off shots of hot lead indiscriminately as he drives too fast. The boom box plays Tex Mex, a music blending Texas and Mexican music. The street-carried boom box has been extinct since the development of MP3 player and points to Mala Noche as a period movie, a moment in time.\n\n24\n\nGus Van Sant\n\nThe use of Mexican slang and street talk like “gringo” come directly from the Walt Curtis book, pages 18 through 19. Curtis covers “abrazos,” which means “embraces,” to “watchalo,” which means “Look out for me.” Criterion,32 the high-end DVD distributor that specializes in presenting rare, unusual, and previously unavailable movies, courageously took on Van Sant’s controversial Mala Noche in 2007. In addition to the movie, the Mala Noche DVD contains an interview with Van Sant and a documentary on Walt Curtis that reveals insights into the man and his sexual proclivities. As to the technical specs, Criterion gave Mala Noche the careful and delicate technical treatment it deserves. The deﬁnition digital transfer of the ﬁlm in its original 1:33:1 aspect ratio was created on the Spirit 2K Datacine from a 35mm interpositive. Imperfections were removed by the thousands with the MTI Digital Restoration System, and the ﬁlm was encoded at highest bit rate for maximum quality. The original audio was restored, as well. Van Sant participated in the process and made changes The release was part of Criterion’s Director Approved series. Johnny is very good-looking (like most of the young men in Van Sant’s ﬁlms), but he is desperate. Johnny tortures Walt by scooting away with the car keys, then driving away without the ownership or the registration. Walt chain-smokes cigarettes. This package store from hell actually sells them individually because of the lack of funds the “patrons” ﬁnd themselves in. In his DVD interview, Van Sant (dressed in a delivery jacket bearing the logo of 7-Up, a beverage he seems to have an afﬁnity for; the original slogan, “You like it, it likes you,” speaks to Van Sant’s gentle demeanor) explains that he had little equipment or plan. He conﬁdes that the script was bad and that storyboards drawn for each shot were followed religiously. Van Sant applies long-lens technique, rack focus, and other cinematic grammar he picked up in school and from watching and making movies. The Mexicans play games with Walt’s car, and he begins to join in the tomfoolery. Exhausted, always horny, and addicted to smokes, booze, and pot, Walt is angry and laughing at the same time that he does not understand how he got into this mess but wanting Johnny even more as the illegal becomes the primo game player. The car is black like a hearse, and the wind continues to howl. Johnny goes through a series of muscleman poses. He is barechested, as is Walt, whose place of work has a No-Credit sign, with some slogan below it like “You have to bring your great grandfather with you, in order to get credit.” Time cut—Walt in store. In front of the Royal Hotel. Sound—rain. Walt walks down a long hallway (Van Sant repeats this image in his death trilogy Elephant [2003], Gerry [2002], and Gus Van Sant’s Last Days [2005], and most famously in Elephant, a metaphorical investigation into the Columbine tragedy). Jump cut on door knock. Time cut to the steps—Exterior of the hotel.\n\nTo Feature or Not to Feature\n\n25\n\nNow it is really raining as a backlight picks up the pelting downpour on the car. A window. The female manager stomps through the hallway. Van Sant, like his hero Hitchcock, performs a cameo appearance as a resident questioned by Walt regarding the Mexican’s whereabouts. Dissolves are plentiful in Mala Noche to link images and ideas. Electronic music by Creighton Lindsay33 and guitar play on the soundtrack. Next, Van Sant crafts a montage of Walt looking for Johnny. Voice over—Walt speaks over a bar discussion. Item—Night Train. This is a cheap wine not recommended by sommeliers but pitched on backin-the day television commercials by Sammy Davis34 and Cesar Romero35—it was practically wood alcohol. One states “You’ll love . . .,” insinuating that he wouldn’t go near the stuff. Before the 1970s, apple wine and other fruitspiked drinks came into vogue for teenagers; the hardcore winos in the 1950s and 1960s drank Night Train for a devastating high, usually ending in stomach problems. Night Train is a perfect metaphor to address the constant sound of trains going by and the method of transportation the illegals used to get from place to place. Cigarette packs are everywhere—Pall Mall, Camels, every kind but ﬁlter tip. These hard-living men and Walt himself like the taste of the tobacco on their lips and in their mouths. Coke is sold here, the soft drink that once had a smidgen of cocaine in its formula. The other way to get high with Coca-Cola was to put an aspirin in the bottle. Van Sant must like the un-cola; he has Walt sell it in the store. Walt sports a half-beard like a baseball player during a night game or American Idol ’s Ryan Seacrest. He appears scruffy and not pretty as he has looked throughout most of the ﬁlm. Cigarettes are sold separately so one doesn’t have to bum one off a buddy or companion. The brand isn’t revealed, but they must be cheap, not a premium brand like those described. The line “My friend Pepper” is spoken. Bud, the “King of Beers,” associated with ﬁne horses and the late Ed McMahon,36 is the brew of choice among alcoholics who don’t drink responsibly. “Cash only.” “No Change.” Old advertising logos are on the glass door, the art of America, Pop Art like that Van Sant created and admired. A singing saw refrains “Home on the Range.” Campbell and Van Sant backlight cigarette smoke so that it looks like a fog.\n\n26\n\nGus Van Sant\n\nIn a long take, a Caucasian pimp schools one of the Mexicans in how to make quick and easy money. He is a hustler and is dressed like a punk rocker, which by the ﬁlm’s release was a waning movement and today is still alive but weakened in spirit, more of a fashion statement than a lifestyle choice. One of the Mexicans becomes sick. He continually coughs and is given medicine. The sickness is represented in constant coughing, sweating; he can’t get up. Mariachi music plays. The other Mexicans have no respect for the sick. They practice martial arts. A new Mexican character shows the others his slick moves. Shots of them watching him are intercut, and there is a through-the-legs shot, which Van Sant had seen in many movies, such as the famous shot of Mrs. Robinson (the Dustin Hoffman character seen through the legs of Mrs. Robinson [Anne Bancroft]) in The Graduate (1967). Walt nurses Pepper back to health, giving him medicine, wiping his cold, sweaty brow. Intercut—ﬂashback—Johnny and Pepper have a fake ﬁght in happier and healthier times. Van Sant employs Iris shots, which go back to cinema’s early days. His command of ﬁlm language for his age and for a ﬁrst ﬁlm is impressive and applied correctly for the story he is telling and the characters in the storytelling. He certainly knew his D. W. Grifﬁth (The Birth of a Nation [1915], Intolerance [1916], Way Down East [1920]). Pepper wants a milk shake. Back in the day it was Coca-Cola syrup; now it’s calcium to rebuild a sick body. Fade to black. Walt inquires for work for the Mexicans but is told by a farm or industrial manager that it is the wrong season—he should come back another season when there is work. The distant church bells play “Silent Night.” It isn’t necessarily Christmas, but it may be. Pepper is still ill. Walt smokes a joint. Doctors have proved the medicinal powers of marijuana, but this doesn’t apply; Walt is the kind of retro-hippie who takes a toke at the beginning of the day and whenever he is stressed out, rather than pop an Ativan (Lorazepam) or the tranquilizer of the moment. Pan down Pepper’s body, to see, to want to heal. Mirror shot. These reﬂections of a subject in reﬂection go back to early cinema. Almost every director has employed them; this is a good one, getting into the soul of a character. The Spanish word molesto is used, implying that Walt is a pervert. Pepper ﬁghts Walt and tries to kick his caregiver off the bed. It is explained that the Mexican likes sex only at night and that is stereotypical—Walt is not. From viewing the documentary Walt Curtis:\n\nTo Feature or Not to Feature\n\n27\n\nThe Peckerneck Poet, directed by famed animator Bill Plympton (25 Ways to Stop Smoking [1989], I Married a Strange Person [1997], The Fan and the Flower [2005]) on the Criterion DVD, it appears that Walt is very selfconﬁdent when it comes to sex, what he knows about it, what he’s done, his technique of taking photos, and his use of a towel and other transactional habits. He also recites phrases as poetry or spoken answers to an interviewer. In this light, Streeter is a bad choice; he is a sweet boy, Walt more the “wild man” of Portland. Streeter does not play a poet in Mala Noche. The spirit if not the tenor of the real deal is kept, without many of the autobiographical details. Van Sant adapted the story of Walt and Johnny and friends and left the rest of the book for background color when needed in the script. A classical record is put on. There is a sequence of Pepper learning how to drive, a long pan, an ugly hair, piece of grass, or some unwanted sliver pops up in the top of the frame. When he approaches a curve, he doesn’t listen to Walt and crashes into the side wall. The car is towed from a pit by a trucker who attaches a line to the car. One ﬂashes forward to a similar image at the end of both Hitchcock’s and Van Sant’s Psycho. Black. Filmmakers either buy black ﬁlm or manufacture it themselves by shooting with the lens cap on. Pepper watches television. Friends are around. There is talk that Johnny may have been arrested going through immigration. In a possible homage to The Wizard of Oz (1939) a rainbow appears over Betty’s head while she is speaking to Walt. Pepper is outside talking to a girl. He likes girls better than boys, but having sex with boys earns him his keep, so he tolerates it. Black. A woman knocks on their door—she needs the police—she is not let in— sound of police siren accompanied by the singing saw. Cop. Slow pan into a Mexican—focus issue may be deliberate or error. Are the police after him? Shadows. Gun. Again we on are the street. We see a down-market Chinese restaurant, the kind where the food is great and the décor is nonexistent. A dark man is shot on a rainy street. There is fog; it is cold. Pappas means French fries in Spanish. Police capture him. Drunks.\n\n28\n\nGus Van Sant\n\nVan Sant did an excellent job of adapting Walt Curtis’s notorious book into a controversial ﬁlm. Curiously, Curtis has text, drawing, and photos that resemble the art of the “cut up” as practiced by Van Sant hero, collaborator, actor, and fellow openly gay man, William S. Burroughs. Walt is a West Coast Beat poet, and Burroughs plied his trade mainly in New York. The fact that Burroughs helped out a gay kid by selling him a story cheap is heartwarming and part of each man’s artistic history and legacy. Close-up of Johnny in the rain. It is most like real rain—not Hollywood rain from a garden hose. It has to do with that particular region of the United States that produces hearty independent souls like Curtis and Van Sant. In the guerrilla ﬁlmmaking tradition, Gus and his micro-crew shot where and whenever they could. They did not wait months for a storm to come in like David Lean (Lawrence of Arabia [1962], Doctor Zhivago [1965], A Passage to India [1984]). This is immediate ﬁlmmaking. Betty is there—as well as the singing. Looking for Johnny is as pointless as the waiting in Beckett’s Waiting for Godot,37 but he is found. A pair of cowboy boots—there is echo on the track—not Gold Star studios, where Phil Spector38 worked, but the kind you can get in an expensive or cheap (or homemade) sound studio. Theme music, piano and guitar. Johnny runs away. Lock in key—key in lock. Bad camera noise. If a camera is not blimped, it makes noise that can be covered up later with music, dialogue, or sound effects, but Van Sant wants reality, and this imperfection of cinema production is perfect for the ﬁlm and to deﬁne its young maker. Tequila. The Mexicans mimic a bullﬁghting routine. Hemingway loved bullﬁghting. It was actually televised on American television during the 1950s. The men are doing shots (a dangerous teen habit when they are downed fast and furious). Pack of Pall Mall—bottle of Tequila. A guitar is played. The police killed Roberto. Johnny throws Walt out of the room, Walt leaves without a ﬁght, even though he is called a puto, slang for faggot. Johnny notches it into the front of the door of Walt’s apartment with his stiletto knife. Again Walt struts down the street, knowing everyone and everyone knowing him—like Harvey Keitel walking into the red-lit bar in Mean Streets. Van Sant shot in Portland, where Mala Noche takes place. Scorsese was forced to shoot the New York bar and some street scenes in Los Angeles. Betty explains that she could easily make $150 a night dancing naked— this is before pole dancing and men’s clubs—she’s talking about dive bars, where men go to see women dance naked to music, usually from a juke box.\n\nTo Feature or Not to Feature\n\n29\n\nThe dancer tells the boss what to play. Women mainly just danced in those days. The girls covered up when their stint was up, when buying drinks for them was allowed. The woman needed money to support themselves and their families. Both now and then, the job attracts college girls with good looks and good bodies. Wet streets like in a ﬁlm noir. Walt keeps looking back at Betty as he drives away into the night. This scene is similar to the end of Scorsese’s Taxi Driver (1976). Walt is Travis, Betty is Betsy. Van Sant at this point and now and forever is a cineaste—he loves movies and watches them incessantly—by inhaling so many ﬁlms they reside in his memory bank and are bound to show up in a different form in his work. This is not copying or plagiarism but homage. Van Sant, like Scorsese, incorporates the references (this is also called “quoting”) while maintaining his personal vision. Before them, Godard accomplished the same cinematic feat. In a ﬁlm by Quentin Tarantino or Brian De Palma (Greetings [1968], Carrie [1976], The Black Dahlia [2006]), the references are the content of the ﬁlm, even as these directors also maintain a personal vision. The credits roll in color home-movie style, as at the beginning of Mean Streets (1973). Van Sant’s take on 8mm ﬁlm is good, but is this ﬁlm or tape? Scorsese’s medium is clearly 8mm ﬁlm and he has runouts, the dots that run through the end of a side or a roll, ﬂashes, and good stop-and-go motion. Van Sant approaches the ﬁlm technique of home movies as a ﬁne arts practitioner. In terms of era (the 1980s), he should have used video, but video doesn’t have those technical qualities—it’s a straight-on image, solid, with no grain but instead pixels. The end credits are white, executed in painterly style of the opening. Streeter puts a piece of plastic wrap over his face to depict either smothering himself or his becoming a monster. He smiles all through this—he is a funloving guy, not in the same way as Walt Curtis, whose idea of fun, according to the Plympton documentary, is having sex with dogs and masturbating to all-boy magazines. Mexican music plays over the credits. The actors go through a Beatles/Monkees-type running around, doing silly actions routine to a punk/New Wave song. Van Sant continues to shake the camera like an amateur making his ﬁrst movie, imitating those two popular pop groups. Ironically, the Monkees copied the Beatles, who copied silent comedies like the Keystone Kops from the cinematic 1910s and 1920s. Because Doug Cooeyate, who played Johnny, was not a trained professional, Arturo Torres mouthed dialogue attributed to this major character. Fellini’s Satyricon, based on an ancient text, involves sexual frolicking that supposedly led to the fall of Rome. The ﬁlm is referenced in Mala Noche by a scene in Satyricon, a hot night club in Portland. Fellini made his own interpretation, even putting his name in the title. Gus Van Sant would borrow this for Gus Van Sant’s Last Days. Kubrick claimed authority for the Anthony\n\n30\n\nGus Van Sant\n\nBurgess book, naming his ﬁlm adaptation Stanley Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange. These men are not claiming ownership but letting the audience/ viewer know that the ﬁlm is their interpretation of the established work they are watching. The credits are written on a plate with white paint like those TCM (Turner Classic Movie) spots, but not with neon, just in pure white paint. They are ﬂuid in style because Van Sant studied Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg,39 and Jasper Johns.40 Sunny Jim (aka Jed Stone), to whom the ﬁlm is dedicated, is a singer who performs in the Cayman Islands style. Mala Noche has ended.\n\n3 The Family Business\n\nDRUGSTORE COWBOY (1989) Gus Van Sant’s second feature ﬁlm, like Mala Noche, is about family—this time junkies. Historically, drug ﬁlms center on speciﬁc drugs, their effects on the body and mind, the drug lifestyle, medical issues experienced by the users, and the punishment if the users are arrested. Drugstore Cowboy examines these issues, but they are tangential; the ﬁlm’s focus is junkies as a family unit. Other ﬁlmmakers have been successful in putting these matters on screen, but in Drugstore Cowboy Van Sant dissects how junkies act with in-depth candor and microscopic intensity, examining their shared personalities as crafted by drugs, especially heroin, and their struggles to live, be free, or die. The story follows Bob Hughes (Matt Dillon, Over the Edge [1979], The Outsiders [1983], Wild Things [1998]), who also appears in Van Sant’s To Die For (1995); his wife, Dianne (Kelly Lynch, Bright Lights, Big City [1988], White Man’s Burden [1995], Charlie’s Angels [2000]); and their drugstore robbing friends Rick (James LeGros, Guncrazy [1992], Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle [1994], Zodiac [2007], who worked with Van Sant again on Psycho [1998]) and his on-screen girlfriend, Nadine (Heather Graham, I Love You to Death [1990], Boogie Nights [1997], Bobby [2006], and Van Sant’s Even Cowgirls Get the Blues [1993]). The characters in Drugstore Cowboy are a fully developed family unit: Bob, the father; Dianne, the mother; Rick, the somewhat dutiful son; and Nadine, the wayward daughter. They grapple with issues that all families, especially dysfunctional ones, face. Bob is a strong father ﬁgure and leader but is becoming exhausted because his lifestyle has worn him down. He is sexually\n\n32\n\nGus Van Sant\n\nimpotent and constantly on the run. He routinely gets into trouble with the law and eventually reaches a crisis, drops out of “the life,” returns home, and enters a methadone program to get clean. Bob is our narrator and begins and ends his journey in an ambulance after he’s been shot by a degenerate junkie/dealer. Dianne is tough as nails, a gun moll and femme fatale who is the getaway driver during the drugstore heists. She is sexually available but can’t get Bob interested because of his constant worry and impotence. Dianne still loves Bob but can’t handle the straight and narrow. She retains her good looks, but how long will they last? Rick is a loyal soldier and has been committed to Nadine. He can shoot junk with the best of them and has taken on a grunge rock1 star look before its time. He has an anger problem and an issue with patience. Nadine is a tragic ﬁgure, cute as a button, the member of the gang who causes physical commotions in the pharmacy, so Bob can loot the drug bins. Nadine is childlike. She is the youngest and has problems with ego and self-esteem. When Nadine complains she is not getting her fair share of the stash, she takes it for herself and overdoses. To dispose of her body, they hide her in an attic and later bury her in the woods. When Bob leaves to get clean, Dianne becomes Rick’s girl; he takes over the family business. Drugstore Cowboy also features a literary superstar as famous for being a junkie as he was for being the writer of Naked Lunch, Junky, and Queer. William S. Burroughs, who allowed Van Sant to make The Discipline of D.E., had his own movie career, including roles in Bloodhounds of Broadway (1989) and Twister (1989); his voice is heard as the preacher on the radio in The Book of Life (1998). In Drugstore Cowboy, Burroughs plays Tom the Priest, an old junkie. Van Sant was in his ﬁrst decade when the Beats roamed San Francisco and New York and traveled the country by car, inspiring Jack Kerouac’s masterpiece, On the Road. Van Sant has walked through the beatnik, hippie, punk, and grunge movements—a devotee of youth movements and artistic lifestyles, he creates ﬁlms that reﬂect their culture and history. Burroughs was an icon and a hero to the throngs who followed his exploits in literature and life. His most infamous act was shooting his wife with a bow and arrow. Van Sant cherished the anecdotes and sordid exploits that the openly gay Burroughs would recall for hours on end. In Drugstore Cowboy, Bob is an on-screen surrogate for Van Sant, listening to the old man for advice and admiring his longevity. James Remar (The Cotton Club [1984], Boys on the Side [1995], Blowback [2000]), who played the police ofﬁcer in Psycho (1998), plays Gentry, a detective who hounds and stalks Bob everywhere he goes and watches his every move waiting for a misstep. The drug lifestyle is portrayed as neither glamorous nor squalid. Drugstore Cowboy is a realistic ﬁlm (and at times a black comedy) that chronicles the day-by-day tedium, the boredom, the anxiety-ridden events that are a part\n\nThe Family Business\n\n33\n\nof the junkie lifestyle. The characters rarely talk about their lives; the rest of their conversation is about making a score, a big one that will feed their habits for more than a couple of days. Bob is a complex and multifaceted character. He owns a bag full of Ben Hogan golf clubs and is working on his handicap when Detective Gentry and his minions smash up Bob’s prize possessions. Bob is riddled with fear and superstitions he feels doom him. A principal phobia concerns putting a hat on a bed. To him, this can bring nothing but bad luck and in the ﬁlm causes (in Bob’s mind) Nadine’s death. In one scene, as a consequence of seeing a hat on a bed, the junkie family leader announces that the family members will be conﬁned to the house for an indeﬁnite period in an effort to ward off a negative outcome. Drugstore Cowboy is based on the book by James Fogle. The book was not released until 1990, when the author was out of prison, having served time for running drugs. Like Bob, he was a lifelong junkie. It was his ﬁrst literary attempt and received rave reviews from the New York Times, the Village Voice, and the Los Angeles Times. Drugstore Cowboy begins in an ambulance, with Bob narrating his story, so the action of the ﬁlm is in ﬂashback. The opening shot in which the camera looks straight down at Bob is a reference or homage to the notorious Andy Warhol ﬁlm Blow Job (1963), a 35-minute shot of a young man’s face as he is given fellatio2 by an unseen giver rumored by the IMDB Web site to be experimental ﬁlmmaker Willard Mass (Geography of the Body [1943], Narcissus [1956], Dionysus [1963]). The young man was Charles Rydell (The Sand Castle [1961], The Queen of Sheba Meets the Atom Man [1963], and Union City [1980]). Van Sant is skillful at placing the right music for the right moment or scene. Drugstore Cowboy begins with a female rendition of “For All We Know,” sung by Abbey Lincoln.3 There is a scratch on the record, a ploy Scorsese used in Mean Streets (1973), when he couldn’t afford a new copy. The song was written by Fred Carlin,4 Robb Wilson, and Arthur James, was published in 1970, and won the Academy Award that year for best song sung in a ﬁlm (Lovers and Other Strangers [1970], directed by Sy Howard, Every Little Crook and Nanny [1970]). It was sung in the ﬁlm by Larry Meredith. Another effective use of music and image occurs in a driving scene as the tribe passes by a bridge, cows, and a dirt ﬁeld seen from an aerial view. The song is a reggae tune, “The Israelites,” written by Desmond Dekker5 and Leslie Kong6 and performed by Desmond Dekker and the Aces. The Israelites were ancient tribes who traveled across the desert seeking land they felt God had given them. In Drugstore Cowboy, Van Sant portrays Bob and his tribe as the Israelites searching for their homeland while experiencing and ﬁghting the overwhelming toil of modern-day poverty. As in Mala Noche, Van Sant recreates home movies, this time using rapid camera movement, the lens swinging right to left, up and down, displaying\n\n34\n\nGus Van Sant\n\ngrain, pixels,7 and scratch"
