It is to be put in movie theaters on a date of February, 2021 but will be everywhere from TV to YouTube. You’ll know when it’s coming.\n\nSynopsis[]\n\n\"Ah, ah, ah, where should I begin? Whenever I think of you, my heart burns like an active volcano, and my body melts into a puddle of lava. My dearest Mr. McQueen, do you know how I feel? I'd be delighted if you found out! I'm so very distressed!\n\n~FLASHBACK~\n\nStorm, at a club:Oh, my sun, my hero, I have loved you so passionately, my Mr. McQueen. I might be your rival, but I'm also a lovesick race car who longs for you. Oh! My love, will you please...Ahem, let's try again.\n\nRipslinger, at the same club:What an annoying race car. He's gonna be in big trouble...REALLY, REALLY big trouble!\n\n~END FLASHBACK~\n\nAnd that's how it all began. With a plane. Really. Resulting from Ripslinger's voice recording of Jackson Storm singing high praises of Lightning McQueen, the whole entire World Of Cars falls into chaos. Now, the only one who can solve this mess is none other than Ripslinger himself! Meanwhile, McQueen deals with the feelings Storm had for him, and the rage of Sally.

The two of them ran out of control at a speed much too great because their brakes are on fire. Black smoke and sparks streaming out on both sides is how you can tell their brakes are on fire. This led the two to crash into anything, even somersaulting off things and in the air. That all ends with Linda and Jr. get into a violent rollover crash down the hill and through a brick wall. The two are taken to the hospital. While the hospital are fixing Linda and Jr. up, Sally and Lightning McQueen watch the news which is cars being interviewed about Linda and Jr. out of control incident. Rochelle is even interviewed as well about the brakes on fire incident. Once Linda and Jr. are out of the hospital, they are given much proper brakes.\n\nThe second time Linda and Jr. had to go to the hospital is because two of their tires blew out for the second time which made them crash through a barrier and knocked them off a steep cliff at the canyon in a world grand prix race.\n\nIt is revealed that Dusty has feelings for Blade Ranger but is too shy to admit it, and also afraid of how Ishani and/or Lil' Dipper will react. But, after hearing Ripslinger's footage, he gets the courage and finally confesses the whole lot in front of the entire crew. He also apologizes to Rip in the end and thanks him for \"helping out\", shocking the other air racers (especially Ishani) and Jackson.\n\nNatalie Certain turns out to be Miles Axlerod's hidden daughter in the movie.\n\nChick Hicks teams up with the lemons, attempting to prove that he's better than Lightning.\n\nNed and Zed get a girlfriend each, and Mia and Tia get a boyfriend each. Seeing this, Ripslinger says \"A car dating a plane, and another car dating another plane? That's weird!\" but congratulates his lackeys for finally escaping from being a single.\n\nThis is the first musical ever in the franchise.\n\nFirst, Ripslinger used to cheat on others, and in the first WATG Rally shown in the movie, they're the ones who cheat on him to kick him out of the race (with Kesha's This Is Me (the main theme) playing in the background), all but Dusty.\n\nPriyanka Chopra returns to voice Ishani, but her only lines in the movie are \"I never knew cheating was so fun! Try it, Dusty!\" and a shocked gasp, hence the reason why she is uncredited.\n\nIt is revealed that Bulldog and Siddeley are acquaintances.\n\nLightning and Jackson end up together, against all odds.\n\nRipslinger wanted to become a secret agent when he was a little plane, depicted in the song \"Cast Away\".\n\nIn the end, Ripslinger gets the same jet engines as Mater, only stronger, bigger, and faster.\n\nEl Chupacabra: Impossible!\n\nRipslinger: Ha-ha!\n\nDusty: Rip!\n\nRipslinger: Check it out! They let me keep the rockets!\n\nDusty: I'll see ya at the finish line, Ripstinker!\n\nRipslinger: Not if I get there first, farm boy! Yippee!"
