        "text": "Canadian DJ Aaron Lax is a force in EDM. Utilizing his talents, he creates captivating live shows that appeal to a broad audience. Furthermore, his knowledge enables him to collaborate with other artists.\n\nHe has an uncanny talent for breaking free of genre conventions that may stifle creativity. His music is both progressive and contagious.\n\nHe is known for his mau5head mask\n\nDeadmau5 first made waves around 2007 as an unconventional dance music producer with an innovative approach to production and an eccentric stage persona featuring his trademark mouse head helmet. He quickly rose through the ranks until becoming one of the biggest DJs worldwide.\n\nResurfacing from his hiatus with the album W, he collaborated with numerous DJs and launched his own record label mau5trap. His musical style spans multiple genres of electronic music while his stage show boasts eye-catching visuals and intricate set designs.\n\nHis iconic mau5head mask can often be found at his concerts and can be purchased directly from his website. Believed to have been inspired by a dead mouse discovered in his computer when he was younger, its unique shape now serves as his logo; and fans can purchase multiple variants.\n\nHis unique stage persona has earned him the moniker “Robotic DJ.” Known for his electrifying live performances and even making an appearance on Gossip Girl TV show, he has also become an outspoken advocate of music piracy, believing it facilitates artist discovery while stimulating creative growth.\n\nHe is married to Kelly Fedoni\n\nJoel Zimmerman, better known by his stage name deadmau5, is one of the most revered and influential producers of electronic music today. He has earned several prestigious accolades such as Juno and DJ Mag top 100 honors; also producing soundtracks to several films; touring with some of pop music‘s biggest artists; amassing an enormous following online; being one of the pioneers of streaming services – these accomplishments and more have cemented him a place among us all!\n\nRecently, Deadmau5 married Kelly Fedoni. On Instagram he shared a post showing her getting ready to walk down the aisle while also including photos from their firepit filled with fireworks – all hallmarks of an extraordinary event for any 36-year-old Canadian DJ like Deadmau5. No surprise then that his wedding wasn’t any less remarkable!\n\nThis couple currently reside in Campbellville, Ontario and purchased their 14,000-square-foot mansion for $5 million in 2014. It features six bedrooms and seven bathrooms as well as a pool and gym – plus it’s decorated with artwork like giant shoes and moose heads!\n\nHe has a daughter named Zoe\n\nDeadmau5 has built a huge following as one of the world’s premier DJs thanks to his lavish stage setups and iconic mouse head helmet. His performances provide a captivating sensory experience, with lighting and visuals in sync with his music – as seen for instance in Jonas Akerlund-directed action thriller Polar. Additionally he has ventured into film soundtrack composition – his first being Polar.\n\nBeginning his DJ career in Canada during the 1990s, DJ Mike began touring internationally before moving to the US where his single “Faxing Berlin” reached #1 on Billboard dance charts and helped gain him international renown and household fame.\n\nDeadmau5 not only composes and produces his own music, but he has also established the mau5trap record label to help promote emerging talent in electronic music.\n\nHe has long championed music piracy and encouraged fans to share his work. He often defends this stance by noting how it helps new artists discover and promote their own work, as well as supporting other electronic musicians such as REZZ and No Mana."
