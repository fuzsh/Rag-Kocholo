        "text": "Kurt is going through his favorite records. Read the explainer or view the master list.\n\nArtist: deadmau5\n\nTitle: Random Album Title\n\nReleased: 2008\n\nGenre: progressive house/trance\n\nRandom Album Title is the third album from Canadian house/trance maestro Joel Zimmerman under his stage name deadmau5 (pronounced \"dead mouse\" and not in any way related to Danger Mouse). He performs in a stylized mouse head helmet because after Daft Punk, that's what EDM artists just do anymore. His album titles all have bizarre names, like Album Title Goes Here, 4x4=12, and--a personal favorite of mine--W:/2016Album/.\n\nRandom Album Title was deadmau5's breakout record, largely on the strength of the single I Remember, which is just one hell of an earworm. I heard it during the club scene in the 2010 remake of GoldenEye 007 for the Nintendo Wii and decided I had to know more about what was going on with whoever this artist was. I Remember was also the fifth single from this album, which just proves to me that I have absolutely no understanding of the house/trance scene. The songs are mostly very long for pop songs, and are arranged in movements rather than an ABACAB verse/chorus/bridge structure. They have long intros and outros, obviously to make them easier to work into dance mixes. And indeed, the entire album plays out in a single uninterrupted mix where songs blend into each other rather than having clear starts and stops.\n\nI Remember is the record's centerpiece as far as I'm concerned, but Brazil, Faxing Berlin, and Slip all have solid melodic hooks underpinning them. I particularly like Slip because the meter is all over the place, so it gets stuck in your head while being impossible to count. If you like house/trance, you probably already know this record, and if not, this isn't a bad entry point, probably? It's a genre I don't follow very closely, but it's fun to dip a toe in and experience it. I missed rave culture entirely--I'm either five years too old or five years too young, I honestly have no idea which.\n\nLabels"
