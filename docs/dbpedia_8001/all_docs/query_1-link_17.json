        "text": "This Friday, January 25, Netflix will premiere the Jonas Akerlund-directed Polar, featuring an original score by electronic music superstar Deadmau5. For Deadmau5 (real name Joel Zimmerman), doing his first film score was a major moment in his life and career as he tells me.\n\nIt's something he gained the confidence to do after working with an orchestra on his acclaimed Where's The Drop show and album last year. Both of those moments, along with discovering Nine Inch Nails, seeing KISS in concert, getting married and getting off social media, made his Who I Am list of nine defining moments.\n\nHere he takes me through all of them, as well as major updates on his next tour and why he is a Netflix fan.\n\nNine Inch Nails, Downward Spiral (Age: Teens)\n\nI was like, \"I want to make music like that, how do I learn?\" That was the kind of kickoff for me. Having listened to all the top brand-name acts when I was going through high school that was the one that stuck out, that motivated me to go out and learn how to do it myself. I remember when Downward Spiral came out I rushed out to go grab it on cassette. Since I've been getting really into scoring films and stuff I've been paying closer attention to Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. I just watched Birdbox the other day. The first bits of music that came in I had no idea. I was like, \"That has got to be Trent Reznor and Atticus, one hundred percent has to be.\" And it was. I waited for the credits just to confirm that and I've been following them since The Social Network, Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and the work they did on Gone Girl. It's really cool seeing these guys line up their styling with the thematics of what's happening on the screen. That's a really cool thing to learn from. So maybe a co-collaboration where it's me and them doing some film would be a dream project.\n\nSeeing KISS In Concert (Age: Teens)\n\nThat was a defining moment cause I couldn't realize you could suck so bad at something and still put on a really great show. They're a monster show for sure [but] I didn't know a single song. I knew a couple but the point is I saw people leaving the show and nobody was talking about Gene Simmons' crazy, Les Claypool-like bass solo. They were talking about when the drummer blew up a piece of truss with the rocket launcher. And I thought those are the moments you need to create in a show, those wow moments. So the big thing I took away from that KISS concert was what would qualify as moments people are talking about. So I started to do antics like that in my show, right? So I would have a sequence where I would fake a blue screen of death, like my computer crashed. And you wouldn't believe how many people believed it. I'm headlining Ultra one year and I play a mash up of Martin Garrix and \"Old MacDonald Had A Farm.\" And honestly while I thought it was a great set all anybody wrote about was that. That's what got the attention, that's what made the show great apparently. I'm like, \"That's dumb, but that's the way it works.\"\n\nPutting On The Mouse Head For The First Time (Age: Twenties)\n\nThe first show I ever did wearing a mouse head was in Halifax. Everyone was staring at me going, \"What the f**k is that?\" And I'm feeling very out of place and awkward and I'm going, \"Oh god, they think I'm a clown.\" But it actually went really well. It was some sweaty little nightclub in some basement. It was weird, maybe about 150 people tops. And I had it, I just put it on and went, \"Yep, I'm Deadmau5, here's my mouse head.\" There was some confusion and then some acceptance. The idea actually came from Jay Gordon in Orgy. I had the mouse head done, it was modeled in 3D and everything and I used it as my logo for my web design and artwork and stuff, so that was my trademark. So that's what I would use and I was designing web elements for Orgy. I think I designed their MySpace page or something like that. And Jay asked me, \"What is this mouse head?\" I said, \"Oh, I don't know, my logo thing.\" Then Jay said, \"If you ever perform live you need to make that a real thing.\" I was like, \"Really? Whatever, bro. Shut up.\" And then I did, many years later after that.\n\nGetting Off Twitter And Facebook (Age: Thirties)\n\nI love it. These social platforms are for what purpose other than showing meals and look what I can do. The only other purpose I can see outside of that, for an artist or a public influencer is obviously advertising or promotion. So why not just give that to my manager and then I don't have to have a f**king aneurysm reading through a million tweets that are unrelated to that. I don't care anymore, I'm over it. So it's not to say I don't care about my fans or I'm cutting off my fans. My fans know how to find me. If you're a Deadmau5 fan you can still get in Deadmau5' head 24 hours a day/seven days a week. I'm not just gonna be a slave to these two beast noise machines where you post a picture of your cat and there's a 20-page thread on Trump under your cat picture. The world isn't ready for Twitter or Instagram, it's definitely not ready for Facebook in terms of how society works. It's a cool system and I'm not bashing it in the way it works. It's just the use of it. You want to get a hold of me you can text me. My fans want to get a hold of me you know where to find me.\n\nProfessional E-Sports (Age: Thirties)\n\nThe music making, the stage designing, everything, no matter how exciting and lucrative it is, still becomes monotonous. Sometimes I have to break up these periods of non-stop working to gaming. As I do that I'm meeting professional gamers online and playing with them, being the celebrity backpack, we'll call it. Being the cool guy kids want on their streams because he's Deadmau5, but we also have to backpack him because he's not a gamer like us. But funny enough I've actually gotten pretty f**king good at it so I've won tournaments. We actually just won $20,000 for Extra Life charity at a big OGN tournament, me and my team. We beat some of the pro players, that felt really good, beating the s**t out of those kids. My one gaming moment that defines my history was killing Dr. Disrespect from an internet cafe on a piece of s**t computer in Calgary. I was playing as I normally play and it's not that rare or impossible, but I stumbled into the same game he was in during that round, where it's like a hundred people connect to a game and then there's only one survivor or one team left. We got in the same game, I saw a guy up on the top of the hill when I was in a building, just took some shots and then when I killed him it showed his name. Then I was like, \"Oh my god, I killed doc.\" And he's a really great player.\n\nGetting Married (Age: Thirties)\n\nI got married. Being married has been cool. Now I'm not eyeballing the front row anymore (laughs). It's great. I found a chick I love and she loves me. She takes care of me. She's the best. She's not into electronic music, which is great, and she's doesn't sing, which is amazing! She's not a DJ, which is a f**king godsend. So it's all good. That has really calmed me the f**k down, not in the way that you think. I'm less stressed out. That's the thing with social media and things like that. I can understand maybe a single me five years ago on Twitter, you got someone you gotta impress, that kind of feeling. Now I don't have to do s**t. I truly don't care. I've got no one to impress.\n\nWhere's The Drop (Age: Thirties)\n\nScoring a legit symphony was insane. That was something that changed a lot of things because it was one of those unattainable things where I would always think, \"There's no way I have the capacity to compose and score 90 minutes of string arrangements and s**t like they used to do overnight back in the day.\" That was really cool because that then basically opened up accessibility into all those kind of venues where that kind of stuff is applied, whether it's film, or even more symphonies. It's achievable and it's not something I would think twice about if someone asked, \"Hey, I need to commission a string piece for this or that.\"\n\nPolar (Age: Thirties)\n\nDoing my first film score because having done the symphony, when I was approached by Jonas [Akerlund] to do the soundtrack I was like, \"Yeah, sure I can totally do it with the confidence that I could do it.\" As opposed to thinking, \"Oh man, I've never done anything like that before, I'm kind of freaked out. I don't know if I should take this because I'm not sure if I'll be able to pull it off.\" I think that's another reason why I signed on to it is I had a quick chat with the director and he seemed like the kind of guy that's more of a collaborator than a dictator. For instance he was really forgiving in the sense that I could write a really cool piece of music that didn't necessarily match the picture and then Jonas said, \"Wow, this is a really cool piece of music. I'm gonna edit the picture to this.\" Then sometimes the other way where it's like the picture was so good I had to force the music into that. But there was a lot of back and forth about that and I think that was an amazing way to work. Reason number two why I signed on cause I know if you're doing anything for Netflix it's pretty flexible in terms of content and stuff like that. I see a lot more things coming from Netflix than I do from Hollywood in general. I think the stars lined up right for this particular picture.\n\nUsing Touch Designer (Age: Thirties)\n\nYou know how a lot of artists play video content in the back? We've done that too forever, it's just tradition. Every performer ever, from EDM to rock, always has that guy sitting in the back showing those visual aspects. Because I'm a huge video gamer I'm playing video games thinking, \"If you can get graphics looking this good using real time in a video game why can't you do that on a LED wall?\" If you're showing a video of a circle going back and forth, then you're like, \"Oh, here's this moment in the track where I want the circle to go up and down.\" Since it's printed video you can't magically change the track to do that live, but if it was GPU accelerated you could cause the graphics are being produced real time. So now I'm getting into real time software and that just totally opened my eyes to my show content because now I could do all sorts of cool tricks. And this is something we're building right now for my next tour. So that's been a huge thing for me. All the visual standpoint in my performance is moving over to a real time environment. But it's obviously powered by some heavy lifting GPU beast machines. They're awesome and they're fun to play with, so I've been learning programming and shader code, lots of non-artistic things, more code driven, to create really cool visuals that are modular."
