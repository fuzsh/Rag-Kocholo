        "text": "Meowingtons, also known as Professor Meowingtons, was a pet cat belonging to deadmau5. Accompanying Zimmerman throughout his career, Meowingtons gained recognition and became an iconic figure within the realm of deadmau5 related media.\n\nHistory[]\n\nMeowingtons was adopted by Zimmerman at the Toronto Humane Society in 2009.[1] Soon enough, he began appearing in livestreams, albums, merchandise, Youtube videos, and more.\n\nIn 2010, Zimmerman mentioned working on an EP called Songs For Meowingtons, however the status of this project is currently unknown.[2] In 2011, the Meowingtons Hax Tour was named after the cat.\n\nIn 2012, Meowingtons appeared on the cover for > album title goes here < and its singles, \"Professional Griefers\", \"Channel 42\", and \"Telemiscommunications\". The same year, Zimmerman collaborated with Sol Republic to develop a line of headphones inspired by Meowingtons.\n\nIn 2019, it was revealed that Meowingtons was going to star in the abandoned animated project, Meowingtons & Mau5. In 2021, a remix of the track \"When The Summer Dies\" was made on behalf of Meowingtons.\n\nOn social media, Zimmerman teased a game he is developing titled Meowingtons Simulator.\n\nTrademark Dispute[]\n\nIn 2015, Zimmerman attempted to register a trademark for the name Meowingtons. However, the application was rejected due to the preexisting ownership of the trademark held by an online retailer specializing in cat-themed merchandise. Because the website was founded in 2014, Zimmerman initiated a petition to challenge the existing trademark, citing his previous usage of the same name.\n\nIn 2017, Zimmerman was sued by the retailer for trademark infringement and unfair competition. The owner claimed that the business did not get its name from Zimmerman's cat. On May 15th, Zimmerman filed a countersuit against the owner with intentions to take down her domain and website.\n\nThe dispute was eventually settled in 2018.\n\nDeath[]\n\nOn August 7th, 2023, it was announced via Instagram that due to a medical issue, Joel would have to put Meowingtons down the next day. The announcement of Meowingtons' passing occurred on August 8th, approximately at 3:30 PM EST.[3] Further details were not disclosed. Meowington's death coincided with International Cat Day.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nMeowingtons had several social media profiles, including a Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.\n\nHe also had a Onlyfans account for a brief period in 2021, making Meowingtons the first pet account in the platform's history.\n\nZimmerman named many songs after Meowingtons, although these have not seen proper releases.\n\nIn addition to Meowingtons, Zimmerman owns three other cats: Miss Nyan Cat, Kip, and Copycat.\n\nHe also used to own cats named Charlie and Noob, who have since passed away.\n\nShortly after Meowingtons' passing, he adopted two kittens named Dizzy and Dolly.\n\nGallery[]"
