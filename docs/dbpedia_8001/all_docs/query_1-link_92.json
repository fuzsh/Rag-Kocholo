        "text": "EpicSurf, a new stationary surf experience from the water park experts at Aquatic Development Group (ADG), has revealed that internationally acclaimed electronic musician and artist deadmau5 has chosen the firm as his surf wave technology partner.\n\ndeadmau5, whose real name is Joel Zimmerman, is an influential Canadian electronic music producer and performer who has made significant contributions to the genre.\n\nIn his spare time, deadmau5 enjoys surfing and has been seen wake surfing with leading sportspeople Austin Keen, World Champion Skimboarder, and Jake Caster, World Champion Wake Surfer – as well as Kx5 music collaboration partner Kaskade.\n\nCaster began coaching deadmau5 after meeting at Wake-to-Wake Watersports in Turks and Caicos.\n\nThe professional wake surfer has been a supporter of EpicSurf since its launch, having taken part in testing and then adopting the surf wave technology for training and leisure. deadmau5 decided to partner with EpicSurf as his surf wave technology provider after joining Caster at the EpicSurf demo wave in New York this summer. Here, he was able to practice his skills, spend time on the wave, and see the factory headquarters.\n\nAuthentic surf experience\n\nEpicSurf is a deep-water stationary surf wave created from genuine water waves. In contrast to sheet wave technology, this realistic deep-water wave provides surfers with a real surfing experience which can be customised to their skill level. The technology is suitable for beginners learning the basics, specialists honing their skills, adaptive programming and surf therapy. EpicSurf’s real wave surfing offers an optimal platform for training, progressing, and enjoying the mental, emotional, and physical benefits of surfing.\n\nThis groundbreaking surf system, built in the United States, generates true deep waves ranging from 3 to 5 feet on a small footprint. The experience is suitable for all surfers as it is easily customised for beginners learning to surf, through to professionals cross-training for their next ocean tournament."
