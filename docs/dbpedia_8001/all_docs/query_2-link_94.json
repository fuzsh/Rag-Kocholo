        "text": "Skrillex has said that fellow EDM producer Deadmau5 is an “asshole” and that the mouse-headed artist is in danger of being better known for insulting people on Twitter than for the music he makes.\n\nDeadmau5, real name Joel Zimmerman, was among the first big name artists to help support Skrillex as he began his career as a producer and DJ. However, Deadmau5 recently criticised Skrillex’s music, asking “what the fuck is this shit?” about Jack Ü single ‘I Need Ü’. The single was produced by Skrillex alongside Diplo and features Justin Bieber on vocals.\n\nNow, in a new interview, Skrillex admitted that he does not mind being on the end of a Deadmau5 insult, but that the near constant outburtsts have pushed him away from the music.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I’ll always have love for Joel because he put me on at an early time, but he’s an asshole. And everyone knows that, and he knows that. And that’s kinda his thing,” Skrillex told New York’s 92.3 Amp Radio.\n\n“I don’t take it personally because I’m secure with myself and what I do, I love what I do,” he added. “But I almost feel bad that that’s his one way of getting attention rather than going into music and curating. I think his attitude’s changed over the last couple years. I personally have become less connected to his music because his personality is almost overshadowing that, when he is such an incredible artist.”\n\nDeadmau5 most recent run in with another artist came when he insulted David Guetta after footage of the French DJ perfoming while surrounded by live horses and dancers wearing Native American headdresses emerged online.\n\nRecommended\n\nDeadmau5 took exception to what he perceived as animal cruelty and posted a series of tweets in which he labelled Guetta and the club owners as “stupid fucks” and described the DJ as “shitty” and “overpriced”."
