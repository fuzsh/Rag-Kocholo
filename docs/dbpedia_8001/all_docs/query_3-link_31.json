        "text": "The name of Joel Thomas Zimmerman may not sound very familiar to many. Deadmau5, however, probably does. The progressive house, electro, house, and electron music powerhouse has been around since 1998. He is also the founder of mau5trap, an electronic music label. He's also one of the highest paid electronic music producers in the world. According to YourEDM, Deadmau5 rakes in an smooth $400,000 - $1 million per show.\n\nDeadmau5 has received an incredible six Grammy Award nominations. He's worked with artists like Kaskade, MC Flipside, Rob Swire, and Wolfgang Gartner. He's produced music under a few aliases like \"Halcyon441,\" \"BSOD,\" and \"WTF?\"\n\nHow did Deadmau5 get his name, you ask? After Zimmerman graduated from Westlane Secondary School in Niagara Falls, he worked with an online music licensing company and as a programmer. He found a dead mouse in his computer and adopted the name.\n\nMTV named Deadmau5 as the house DJ for the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards. He then expressed his sincerest gratitude towards Lady Gaga and David Guetta for introducing him to electro pop and the mainstream music. 2011 saw the release of \"Raise Your Weapon.\"\n\nDeadmau5 Albums and EPs\n\nGet Scraped\n\nVexillology\n\nRandom Album Title\n\nFor Lack of a Better Name\n\n4x4=12\n\n>album title goes here<\n\nWhile (1<2)\n\nW:/2016ALBUM/\n\nstuff i used to do\n\nDeadmau5 is seen all over the internet, especially Twitter, with his \"Twitter rants,\" which are highly enticing to read. He usually takes to the social media platform to rip on other \"producers\" and DJs, calling them out as well. The mau5 has also been seen in a handful of video games throughout the years (this is where he originally got his music career going). You can hear his work in the following games: Dota 2, Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars, Saints Row: The Third, FIFA 13, Grand Theft Auto IV, Need for Speed: Most Wanted, Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit, Need for Speed: Shift, Midnight Club: Los Angeles, GoldenEye 007, Wipeout 2048, The Sims 3, Asphalt 8: Airborne, Test Drive Unlimited 2, and Sound Shapes.\n\nDeadmau5 has a biography and discography that could be a book. The influential producer, DJ, record-label founder, and head cheese is most certainly one of the most talented electronic music artists out there. He tends to produce music that is always unique, genre-defying, and brings about the iconic Deadmau5 sound. I'm excited to see what the mau5 has in store for the future.\n\nLennon"
