        "text": "By Peter Helman\n\nJoel Zimmerman, better known to the world as curmudgeonly EDM star Deadmau5, has a cat. That cat’s name is Meowingtons. Since being adopted in 2010, the famous Meowingtons has been featured on album art and merchandise, has had a compilation and a tour named after him, and has inspired the first-ever headphones designed specifically for cats. And now, as Billboard reports, Meowingtons has become the center of a legal battle between Deadmau5 and Meowingtons.com, an online store that sell cat-themed apparel and gifts.\n\nYou see, when Deadmau5 tried to trademark the name “Meowingtons” last year, his application was rejected. He discovered that the name was also being used by Meowingtons.com, which is run by a Florida woman named Emma Bassiri. Deadmau5 believes that she chose the name because she’s a longtime Deadmau5 fan, and now he’s petitioning the United States Patent And Trademark Office to cancel her trademark so he can establish his own.\n\n“This action arises out of Meowingtons LLC’s blatant attempts to exploit for its own commercial benefits the iconic “MEOWINGTONS” mark of internationally-renowned and respected progressive electronic music artist and producer, Joel Zimmerman,” attorney Irene Lee writes in the petition. “As a result of Deadmau5s fame, his cat — whom he named and is commonly referred to as ‘Prof. Meowingtons,’ ‘Prof. Meowingtons, PhD,’ and ‘Meowingtons’ — has become widely recognized in his own right and gained substantial fans and followers on social media.”\n\nDeadamu5 is claiming that the site’s “unauthorized use of the MEOWINGTONS mark has already caused actual confusion in the marketplace, chilling [Deadmau5]’s licensing program and depriving [Deadmau5] of the ability to control the use of its valuable intellectual property.” To regain the trademark, he’s using the concept of first use, arguing that while the online store didn’t launch until 2014, he’s been using the Meowingtons mark since at least 2011. You can read the whole claim here, and check out some cute pics of Meowingtons (the cat, not the site) below."
