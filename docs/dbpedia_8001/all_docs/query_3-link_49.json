        "text": "For over a decade, Joel Zimmerman, better known by his stage name Deadmau5, has been a household name in the world of EDM and house music. Known for his trademark mouse helmet and extravagant stage design, Deadmau5 is one of the highest paid EDM producers in the world, and performs his shows masked similarly to Daft Punk and Marshmello.\n\nBased out of Ontario, Canada, Deadmau5 has been nominated for six Grammy awards and has won a number of other industry accolades, including multiple DJ Awards and DJ Magazine Awards. With 8 studio albums to his name, along with a plethora of collaborations and associated acts, Deadmau5 is one of the most globally recognized EDM artists and has been a part of several video game titles, including DJ Hero 2 and Dota 2.\n\nDeadmau5 is well known to have an affinity for video games and technology, notably streaming on Twitch (until he was banned in February 2019) and maintaining a collection of drones. Additionally, the DJ has a collection of high end sports cars, including a McLaren Senna. In 2014, Deadmau5 faced backlash from Ferrari over his “Purrari,” a Ferrari 458 Spider which the artist had wrapped with the Nyan Cat and changed the badging on. Ferrari sent him a cease & desist letter leading Deadmau5 to sell the car and purchase a Lamborghini Huracan, which he modified in a similar fashion and christened the “Purracan.”"
