He predominantly produces progressive house music, as well as techno under the alias Testpilot. With six Grammy Award nominations for his work, he has collaborated with top DJs and producers such as Kaskade, Wolfgang Gartner, Rob Swire and Chris Lake. In 2007, Zimmerman formed his own record label, Mau5trap. He's now one of the highest paid electronic music producers in the world, alongside Marshmello and Daft Punk who also use masks to perform. His vibrant music has been featured in compilation albums such as Tiësto's In Search of Sunrise 6: Ibiza, plus Armin van Buuren's A State of Trance radio show. ‘I Don't Want No Other’, an early 12\" single released on vinyl and credited as Dred and Karma (an alias created alongside Derek Caesar in 2000), was the first taste of Deadmau5’s huge catalogue. ‘Deadmau5 Circa 1998-2002’, a self-released compilation album under the alias Halcyon441, followed in 2006. Get Scraped, his debut studio album, came in 2005 and was succeeded by Vexillology in 2006. His breakthrough album ‘Random Album Title’ was unleashed in 2008 and achieved gold certification in Canada, plus silver certification in the UK. Featuring seminal releases such as ‘Faxing Berlin’, ‘Not Exactly’ and chart hit ‘I Remember’ (with Kaskade), the project was soon followed by the acclaimed For Lack of a Better Name. BSOD (Better Sounding On Drugs) - another alias Zimmerman has used in collaboration with Steve Duda - released its fourth album, 4x4=12, at the end of 2010. With hits like ‘Some Chords’, ‘Animal Rights’, ‘Sofi Needs a Ladder’ and ‘Raise Your Weapon’, it cemented Deadmau5’s position as one of the world’s most successful electronic acts. Singles ‘The Veldt’ and ‘Professional Griefers’ (featuring Gerard Way) emerged in 2012 and were featured on Deadmau5’s sixth album, Album Title Goes Here. After leaving long-time label Ultra Records, Zimmerman took a creative break until the release of his seventh album, While(1<2), via Astralwerks and Virgin EMI in 2014. Supported by singles ‘Avaritia’, ‘Seeya’, ‘Infra Turbo Pigcart Racer’ and ‘Phantoms Can't Hang’, the album signalled another fresh start for the multi-platinum star. His eighth studio album W:/2016Album/ saw the light of day in late 2016, followed by releasing singles ‘Snowcone’ and ‘Let Go’. After composing the score for the 2019 action film Polar and unveiling singles ‘Satrn’, ‘Coasted’, ‘Fall’, he returned in 2020 with ‘Pomegranate’ and ‘Bridged by a Lightwave’ - paving the way for yet another remarkable album."
