        "text": "Deadmau5 has issued his newest single “Wet” under his techno alias testpilot, marking a decade since his alter ego’s debut release.\n\nDeadmau5, world-renowned Canadian producer and DJ, has taken the electronic music scene by surprise with his latest track “Wet” released under his techno alter ego, TESTPILOT. The song features a darker, grittier vibe compared to his signature progressive house style and explores a vastly different approach to his mainstream sound. The new single arrives ten years after his debut release “Sunspot (White Space Conflict)” under the TESTPILOT alias.\n\nJust over a week ago, Deadmau5 posted a snippet of “Wet” on Instagram leaving fans astounded as new music seemed implausible after years of no releases under the techno alias. Elements of heavy bass stabs, dark synths, and a brooding atmosphere in the song’s preview had the artist’s fanbase known as ‘The Horde’ flooding the comments with excitement and anticipation for its release.\n\nJoel Zimmerman, better known by his stage name Deadmau5, illustrates musical freedom through his TESTPILOT moniker by delving into underground sounds while maintaining his artistic craft. Zimmerman certainly pushes the boundaries as he strays from his Deadmau5 persona and puts emphasis on his technical abilities within a new genre. Undoubtedly, TESTPILOT provides ‘The Horde’ with an alternate experience than what they’re used to receiving from Zimmerman where “Wet” is a true testament to the odyssey into the techno realm.\n\nTESTPILOT emerged in the techno scene back in 2013 when he joined the stage with trailblazer Richie Hawtin for a back-to-back set at SXSW in Austin, Texas. Since then, he has performed masterclass sets all over the world including premier clubs such as Space Miami, Sound Nightclub, Brooklyn Mirage, and top festivals such as Creamfields, EDC Las Vegas, Coachella, and Ultra Miami. His versatility can further be displayed through his collaboration projects with Rezz (Rezzmau5) and Kaskade (Kx5).\n\nAlong with upcoming tour stops, you can expect a three-song EP titled ‘some ep’ from Deadmau5 to be released on July 19th on his label Mau5trap. The EP includes the new single “Wet” and his previous release earlier this month “Quezacotl.” Even more exciting, Deadmau5 dropped news in his discord that an album “should follow shortly” after the release of the EP.\n\n“Wet” has certainly established a defining moment for Deadmau5′ career as the fresh release marks a new era for his TESTPILOT alter ego. The track drops in perfect time during festival season proving to be a banger on stages internationally. You can now stream “Wet” on all platforms.\n\nFeatured Image X/deadmau5\n\nAbout The Author"
