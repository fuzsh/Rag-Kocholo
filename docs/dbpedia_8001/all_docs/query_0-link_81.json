        "text": "Joel Thomas Zimmerman, better known by his stage name Deadmau5, is one of the most well-known DJs in electronic music. His unique sound and imaginative live performances have amassed legions of fans; but who exactly is he?\n\nDeadmau5 is an American-Canadian electronic dance music (EDM) producer, performer, and composer who rose to fame during the 2000s. He is most recognized for his progressive house genre of music as well as his signature mouse head mask and elaborate stage shows featuring LED lights synchronized to his music.\n\nHis expertise lies in engaging his fans on social media and streaming platforms like Twitter and Twitch, where he engages them directly. A passionate car enthusiast himself, the artist owns multiple luxury and sports cars adorned with his iconic Nyan Cat design such as his Porsche Cayenne wrapped with its famous pink stripes. Additionally, he has even ventured into video game composition, writing music for such popular titles like Need for Speed and Absolver.\n\nDeadmau5 has released eight studio albums and is widely recognized as an accomplished producer in electronic dance music. His most recent effort, W:/2016ALBUM/, debuted atop Billboard Dance/Electronic Albums chart and earned him his second Grammy nomination. Additionally, Deadmau5 has made appearances on television as well as composed the soundtrack for Netflix movie Polar.\n\nDeadmau5 may not be known for using metaphors and lofty album titles, but his musical genius shines through in each track he produces. His ear for melody is enhanced by complex computerized synthesizers and effects, his signature vocal harmonies being reminiscent of 1990s pop and R&B while his beats often feature melodic leads that crescendo in intensity before receding at just the right moments – proof enough of deadmau5’s musical prowess!\n\nOver his career, deadmau5 has experimented with various genres of music, incorporating elements from multiple styles into his productions. While most of his works still fall within the progressive house genre, he has also dabbled with trance, dubstep and funk productions among others – creating an eclectic and captivating combination of sounds that remain signature to deadmau5.\n\nDeadmau5 has earned widespread respect for his revolutionary production techniques and live performances are equally as remarkable. The artist typically performs behind a large cube equipped with two LED screens on either side that combine to project visuals that accompany his music. For much of his set, crowd members could not see deadmau5, until eventually the cube rotated and revealed him with his iconic green light mau5head on. At that momentous moment, they cheered loudly!"
