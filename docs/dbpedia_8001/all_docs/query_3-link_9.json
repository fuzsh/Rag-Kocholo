        "text": "Better known by his stage name deadmau5 (pronounced “dead mouse”), Joel Thomas Zimmerman is a Canadian electro and house music producer, based in Toronto. He doesn’t like being called a DJ, though, and his sets are closer to live performances as he assembles tracks on the fly using cutting edge computer technology including software that he’s helped to write himself. “There are no CDs involved,” he explains. “It’s a technological orgy up there and I try and keep it more my music than anyone else’s. If people come out to see deadmau5, I want them to hear deadmau5 music.”\n\nHe’s at the top of his game, the first electronic artist to sell out 17,000 tickets indoors at London’s Earls Court last year, and then 25,000 outdoors at Victoria Park this summer. According to his production manager, he’s also a complete gear head! Having tried out the NEXO 45*N-12 monitors in the UK, he sourced a pair of the wedges at the start of his North American tour and liked them so much that he bought them. Now the N-12s go everywhere with him, including shipping out to South Africa for shows in November."
