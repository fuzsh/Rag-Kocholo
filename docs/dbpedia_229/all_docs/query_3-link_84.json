        "text": "An intellectual deliberation on sin, doubt, yes- God’s silence, persecution and cruelty/evilIn one of the opening scenes with Andrew Garfield, Adam Driver and Ciarán Hinds there’s a very nice shot of an empty cathedral and the symmetry in the frame of the hall behind them So there’s the start of something very strong visual/formally here with the overhead “God’s eye view” shot. There’s one of the grey stairs (a stunner, here below) and another one later overhead of the boat going to Japan. It’s such a strong start. And then it drops off and the next one of these\n\nTwo directors and two films- Ray Enright and Busby Berkeley—only one (Berkeley) is the geniusThe first half is nearly all Enright (I can tell this by the body of work of the two differing directors)—it is a fine little drama, the wipe edits and transitions are a nice touch (one tearing a picture) and give it a brisk and fun paceThe narrative is cat-nip to these depression-era audiences. The idol and idiot rich. The bit with the man-servant is great. He’s always giving a crazy look or sleeping in the background. The brilliance of the film is all in\n\nMike Leigh has his own voice, world and characters not unlike Fellini, Bergman or Woody Allen – his is the blue collar (Broadbent sporting a can of beer in the first 5 minutes and you get the idea that Leigh prefers “Mike” to “Michael” for this reason) middle-lower class in Britain, family dramas, a talented stable of actors, catchy scores, and the semi-ironic titles middle-lower class in Britain, family dramas, a talented stable of actors, catchy scores, and the semi-ironic titles These characters are grasping at strawsThe ensemble includes Jim Broadbent, Stephen Rea, Timothy Spall, David Thewlis—really impressive The\n\nStark visually, bleak in tone, and heavy in subject matter --- Tim Roth (debut as a director, obviously a very talented and accomplished actor) follows in the proud British tradition of Davies, Loach and Mike Leigh—debut year – 1999—similar to Lynn Ramsay’s Ratcatcher (which is superior) as wellTwo first-time younger actors are anchored by Tilda Swinton and Ray Winstone. The daughter- Lara Belmont is good—but the Tom character- Freddie Cunliffe needs a better actor here Two first-time younger actors are anchored by Tilda Swinton and Ray Winstone. The daughter- Lara Belmont is good The boy, Tom, is a peeper\n\nAn excellent script and lead performances from Steve Martin and Michael CaineFrank Oz certainly puts a stamp on the film because this two-hander does look at feel like the similarly-winning 1991 film What About Bob? If you wonder who the artist is—director vs. cinematographer – at least here- this is shot by long-time Fassbinder and Scorsese DP Michael Ballhaus and although there are nice shots of the on location shoot in the south of France—well—yeah—this is not Scorsese or FassbinderFilled with hilarious sketches. Martin has a solo improvisational scene at the jail that is fairly famous – but for\n\n1.0 in June 2019 A subtle character study—a story of first love and addition The final shot sticks with you—it’s a giant door opening—sounds simple- but given the context of the film, her awakening, naivety (not just sexual, but about life in general)—we’re going from the sealed off movie studio here to opening the door to the outside- an amazing visual metaphor The final shot sticks with you - genius - one of the best shots of 2019 The film, and it’s in the text, references the Jean-Honoré Fragonard titular artwork—intelligent discussion between Honor Swinton Byrne and Tom Burke.\n\nFuller. “If you don’t like Sam Fuller, you just don’t like cinema.” – Martin Scorsese. How about that? haha. For the purposes of this list fuller’s weakness is his best film (certainly he can’t match Carol Reed, Peter Jackson, George Lucas, Victor Fleming or some others that fall behind him on the list here). Where he whoops those names is in the depth of his body of work. Fuller’s 8th best film is damn good and has his stamp of authorship. His films are just strange-- B-movies, often visceral, grim gut-punches. He feels self-taught because he uses angles and\n\nWondrously- a confirmation of Mike Leigh’s auteur status in 1988. High Hopes is a contemporary family drama, an authentic character study, and a political critique of Thatcher’s 1980’sLargely plotless- everyday life and observational. Leigh is a realist and the details here feel just like the best written novels. The film revolves (as the camera rolls over to the flat next door) around three couples, a yuppie couple (Lesley Manville is one of them and her husband says “What makes this country great is a place for everyone, and everyone in his place”) couple living next door to the elderly\n\nThoroughly engaging, a damn funny film, and a meditation on greed, depravity, excess—and yes- this is Scorsese—sin. It’s a marathon—3 hours flat—but my god Scorsese has both a knack for narrative (his films are almost all long, though in 2013 this is his longest) and keeping the momentum going through interesting subject matter and energetic direction and editing. Casino is long and absolutely flies by, ditto for Casino, The Aviator, The Departed- we’re talking about some of the fastest 2+ hours in cinema and that’s a testament Scorsese I think there’s some clear rise and fall of the Roman\n\nFrom a content and storyline standpoint it’s a changeup for Scorsese- a softer subject matter, it isn’t violent, modern or set in New York. It’s a period film, Dickensian -- an orphan set in London. However, it is clearly one of the most beautiful films of 2011 featuring uncrazy Academy Award wins for best production design and cinematography-- another feather in the cap for frequent Scorsese collaborators Dante Ferretti and Robert Richardson. The mise-en-scene specifically is an absolute artistic feat. No detail seems to have been overlooked – from the craft and construction of the visual design and story—and\n\nArgento. Dario Argento is the master of Italian Giallo- a horror subgenre. His filmography (mostly on the strength of Suspiria) ranks him 98th and he’s definitely a style-plus auteur. That’s his case (and that’s why it may seem like I’m underrating him at #113 here). He has a single film that’s superior to anything made by Spielberg, The Coen Brothers, Cronenberg, Sirk, or Fincher. In fact, the only directors with a film rated higher on the all-time top 500 list than Suspiria- who I haven’t got to on my list of all-time directors- are Stanley Donen, Oliver Reed, Victor\n\nAffleck’s sophomore directorial effort after the impressive 2007 debut Gone Baby Gone (also set in Boston)Like Gone Baby Gone there are a ton of glorious helicopter establishing shots- this isn’t The Lord of the Rings-level establishing shots but still—really impressive--- both the beauty of it and that it’s a trait for Affleck as an auteur—we open with one, we get one before the Fenway heist set piece, and a dozen or more others Like Gone Baby Gone there are a ton of glorious helicopter establishing shots we open with one, we get one before the Fenway heist set piece,"
