        "text": "Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on Page 12.\n\nNow Playing\n\n* ''AMERICAN MOVIE,'' featuring Mark Borchardt and friends. Directed by Chris Smith (R, 104 minutes). An insightful, funny, not-to-be-missed documentary about a no-budget Wisconsin filmmaker who makes a horror film as if his life depended on it. And as Mr. Smith so affectingly reveals, Mr. Borchardt's hopes really do hang in the balance. This knowing and often hilarious look at try-anything indie filmmaking becomes a moving portrait of one man's uphill struggle and finds Mr. Borchardt often describing success and prosperity as his goals. Meanwhile his own life is eloquently presented as a very different, no less authentic kind of American Dream (Janet Maslin).\n\n''ANNA AND THE KING,'' starring Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat. Directed by Andy Tennant (PG-13, 140 minutes). The same story that inspired the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical ''The King and I'' is the basis for this movie about the British schoolteacher Anna Leonowens (Ms. Foster), who travels to Bangkok in 1862 to educate the 58 children of King Mongkut (Mr. Chow). Although the story has been given a contemporary multicultural perspective that is critical of British imperialism, the picturesque film tells essentially the same story but without the beloved songs, which are badly missed. Ms. Foster's Anna is another of her nobler-than-thou ice queens, and Mr. Chow's king is authoritative but less than thunderous (Stephen Holden).\n\n''BICENTENNIAL MAN,'' starring Robin Williams, Embeth Davidtz, Sam Neill and Oliver Platt. Directed by Chris Columbus (PG, 132 minutes). This year's gushy Christmas card from Robin Williams follows the 200-year quest of a household robot named Andrew to become human. Directed by the schmaltzmeister Chris Columbus, who steered this star through ''Mrs. Doubtfire,'' the movie is a joke-strewn sentimental man-machine allegory determined to make us feel good about being human that is punctuated by corny speeches exalting freedom, the joys of sex and the mystery of mortality. Except for Mr. Williams, the acting is strictly of sitcom caliber (Holden).\n\n* ''DOGMA,'' starring Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Linda Fiorentino, Chris Rock and Salma Hayek. Directed by Kevin Smith (R, 130 minutes). Mr. Smith's idea of angels in America is the notion of two cool dudes who take a hair-splitting, legalese approach to Roman Catholic doctrine and think it would be amusing to nullify all existence. And nothing in this wildly brazen, unexpectedly devout comedy is any less outrageous than that. Mr. Smith again shows off a rare gift for fusing his comic-book sensibility with serious debates and big, big laughs, even if some parts of his film (Ms. Fiorentino's performance, Mr. Rock's and semi-repartee from the ubiquitous Jay and Silent Bob) work better than others (an excrement monster). Making a gutsy leap into matters of faith, Mr. Smith miraculously emerges with his humor intact and his wings unsinged (Maslin).\n\n''DOUBLE JEOPARDY,'' starring Ashley Judd, Tommy Lee Jones and Bruce Greenwood. Directed by Bruce Beresford (R, 106 minutes). In a touristy thriller that roams from the coastline of Washington State to the French Quarter of New Orleans, Ms. Judd plays a woman who is free to kill her husband because she has already gone to prison for the crime (see title). Not even she is beautiful enough to get away with rote acting and a far-fetched plot, but she perks up as her character becomes less of a victim. In this coed homage to ''The Fugitive,'' Mr. Jones is on hand as another weathered sourpuss with a knack for barking orders. Mr. Beresford directs so unremarkably that it takes a line like ''I feel like I've grown in the last six years'' to signal the passage of time (Maslin).\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
