        "text": "The War Zone (1999)\n\nThe Movie: A dark family secret rears its ugly head when Tom (Freddie Cunliffe) is forced to leave London and move to Devon with his family.\n\nWinstone Grit: Winstone steals the show as the family’s patriarch, a gobby chatterbox who could be hiding something. Easily one of Winstone’s finest turns.\n\nOur Boy (1997)\n\nThe Movie: Woody (Winstone) and his wife Sonia (Pauline Quirke) attempt to come to terms with the death of their son, who was killed in a hit-and-run accident.\n\nWinstone Grit: Intense and brooding, Winstone brings shocking emotion to his role as a grieving father. No grit here, but you’ll probably find you’ve got something in your eye.\n\nLadybird Ladybird (1994)\n\nThe Movie: Docu-drama from Ken Loach, with Crissy Rock as (Maggie) a woman who fights Social Services for the right to keep her children after a string of abusive relationships.\n\nWinstone Grit: As abusive Simon, Winstone’s terrifying, flying into violent rages that are unsettlingly convincing.\n\nThe Proposition (2005)\n\nThe Movie: Captain Stanley (Winstone) makes a deal with gang member Charlie (Guy Pearce) – he can earn his freedom and a pardon if he tracks down his gang leader brother and kills him.\n\nWinstone Grit: At the top of his game, Winstone is ragged and unreasonable, and somebody you’d think twice about crossing. He dominates the entire film.\n\nGreat Expectations (2011)\n\nThe TV Series: The BBC’s most recent adaptation of Charles Dickens’ tome. Winstone appears as Magwitch, while Gillian Anderson is Miss. Havisham.\n\nWinstone Grit: Emerging from the moors filthy and wild, Winstone makes for a fantastically imposing Magwitch. Ralph Fiennes will have quite a job to match him in this year’s new movie adap.\n\nScum (1977)\n\nThe Movie: Alan Clarke’s tough crime drama, which examined the lives of young offenders serving time at Borstal, where no attempt at reforming the inmates was made (at the time).\n\nWinstone Grit: In his debut role, Winstone is effortlessly menacing as troublemaker Carlin, lending the film as much as grit as it demands – and then some.\n\nRobin Of Sherwood (1984)\n\nThe TV Series: Richard Carpenter’s retelling of Robin Hood, with Michael Praed as the princely vagabond, and Winstone playing Will Scarlet.\n\nWinstone Grit: Alternately haunted, vicious and stubborn, Winstone wears numerous hats as Scarlet, and creates a fully-rounded character that really shows off what he can do.\n\nThe Departed (2006)\n\nThe Movie: Martin Scorsese’s remake of 2002 Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs , starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon. Winstone plays Arnold ‘Frenchy’ French.\n\nWinstone Grit: Despite the likes of Jack Nicholson getting in on his gangster territory, Winstone practically steals the show here as a ruthless meanie.\n\nSexy Beast (2000)\n\nThe Movie: Retired safecracker Gal Dove (Winstone) is pulled out of retirement by callous gangster Don Logan (Ben Kingsley), leading to a mammoth heist.\n\nWinstone Grit: Underplaying it to perfection, Winstone is the ideal counterpoint to Kingsley’s venomous villain – a cockney wideboy with real low-key brilliance.\n\nNil By Mouth (1997)"
