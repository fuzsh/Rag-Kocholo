        "text": "If the story is implausible, the mood isn't. Sitting through the film is like spending 98 minutes in a meat locker. Roth had the courage to make The War Zone--if only he'd had the courage to deliver less of it!\n\nThe hint that this film has been overdone can be picked up from Roth's suggestion that watching his appalling movie is therapeutic to all the daughter-rapers in the audience. I quote from the press notes: \"If there is one abuser who sees this film and realizes what effect they've had on the child they've abused, it will have been worth making.\" But if you aren't abusing a child, will it have been worth watching? The War Zone (Unrated; 98 min.), directed by Tim Roth, written by Alexander Stuart, based on his novel, photographed by Seamus McGarvey and starring Tilda Swinton, Ray Winstone and Freddie Cunliffe, opens Friday in San Jose at the Towne Theater.\n\n[ San Jose | Metroactive Central | Archives ]"
