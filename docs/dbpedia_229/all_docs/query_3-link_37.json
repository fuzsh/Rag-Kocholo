        "text": "Ian Richardson, who lives in Brighton, had his glasses smashed and nose cut as he helped passengers restrain Freddie Cunliffe in January last year.\n\nCunliffe, who has the autistic disorder Aspergers Syndrome, lashed out and swore at cabin crew on a flight from Goa to Gatwick, Hove Crown Court heard yesterday.\n\nGuy Dillway-Parry, prosecuting, said the attack happened after the defendant took Valium and drank vodka he had bought on a stop-over in Bahrain.\n\nCunliffe, of Bow Road, east London, had rowed with girlfriend Lucy Jarman, slapping her on the head and forcing her to ask to be moved away from him.\n\nThe flight was forced to divert to Cyprus, where Cunliffe was removed from the Monarch Airlines Airbus.\n\nHe later admitted endangering the safety of an aircraft and to assaulting Mr Richardson and appeared for sentence yesterday.\n\nCunliffe has appeared in the TV documentary Rehab.\n\nHe was spotted for the part by award-winning film director Antonia Bird.\n\nMiss Bird told the court: \"I was quite amazed to hear about his behaviour on the flight. I have never seen anything like this from him before.\"\n\nRyan O'Neill, defending, said the effects of being separated from his girlfriend and being restrained triggered Cunliffe's behaviour.\n\nMr O'Neill said: \"It was at that moment the Aspergers kicked in. Freddie Cunliffe was not in control and fully responsible for his behaviour from then on.\"\n\nRecorder Vivian Ramsey QC said that Cunliffe's autistic disorder amounted to exceptional circumstance which allowed him to suspend a prison term.\n\nHe was given a six-month sentence suspended for two years.\n\nHe was also ordered to pay Ian Richardson Â£250 compensation for his injuries."
