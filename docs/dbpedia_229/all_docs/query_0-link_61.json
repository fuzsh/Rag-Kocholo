        "text": "ROTH MAKES DIRECTING BOW: Tim Roth, Oscar-nominated for “Rob Roy,” has become the latest actor to move behind the camera. Roth has signed a deal to make his feature directing debut on “The War Zone,” an adaptation of an Alexander Stuart novel to be financed by London’s Channel Four.\n\nRoth, who’ll next be seen toplining Giuseppe Tornatore’s Fine Line film “Legend of the Pianist on the Ocean,” chose for his helming debut a dark novel centering around a 15-year-old boy coming of age in a seemingly normal middle-class family that has just uprooted from London to the isolated Devon countryside.\n\nThe film will star Ray Winstone, who played the lead in Gary Oldman’s directing debut “Nil by Mouth,” Tilda Swinton (“Orlando”), Lara Belmont and Freddie Cunliffe. Stuart adapted his novel, and Sarah Radclyffe, Dixie Linder and Eric Abraham will produce. Roth’s repped by Ilene Feldman.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nTHAT’S A WRAP: The longest shoot in modern film history officially ended Jan. 31 when Stanley Kubrick completed the final bit of night shooting on “Eyes Wide Shut.” For those keeping score, that’s almost 15 months since production began Nov. 4, 1996. For an estimate of actual shooting days, subtract eight weeks of vacation — unusually high for a shoot, but not for one that spans two Christmases. Kubrick now begins postproduction, and Warner Bros. brass can only hope he cuts faster than he shoots, because the studio is anticipating a holiday release.\n\nWith wife and “Eyes Wide Shut” costar Nicole Kidman already busy on WB’s “Practical Magic,” Tom Cruise can now decide whether to star in the “Mission: Impossible” sequel or any of a number of plum projects. The only thing for sure is that the next picture will have a guaranteed stop date.\n\nD’ONOFRIO’S CHARACTER WORK: While playing roles ranging from the psychotic soldier in Kubrick’s “Full Metal Jacket” to the grotesque villain in “Men in Black” have made Vincent D’Onofrio a busy actor who hardly gets recognized on the street, he’ll risk losing that anonymity with a flurry of new projects.\n\nHe’ll star in “World on a Wire,” a Joseph Resnick-directed film to be distributed by SPE. “I get to play a character who’s actually two different people,” he said. “One’s in 1937 L.A., the other is contemporary.” He’s also joining James Spader in the big-budget sci-fi film “Supernova” at MGM, which gives him an odd romantic role: “I play a guy who runs a ship through a computer, but actually falls in love with that computer. Imagine Hal is a woman, and you get the picture.”\n\nD’Onofrio has also branched into producing in partnership with his manager, Ken Christmas. They produced the Dan Ireland-directed “The Whole Wide World” and “The Velocity of Gary,” the Salma Hayek-Thomas Jayne starrer that recently completed shooting.\n\nThey’ve got five others in development, one of which D’Onofrio will direct.\n\nWhile he might have seemed headed for lead roles after “Mystic Pizza,” D’Onofrio relishes the chance to play off-kilter parts: “I found out early that in most scripts, the supporting characters are all more interesting than the leads, and when the big studios weren’t allowing me to do the leads, I found a niche as a character actor, especially after ‘Full Metal Jacket.’ The work’s always interesting, and it allows me and my wife to do whatever we like and never be recognized or bothered.”\n\nPERMUT FITS TV BILL: Veteran producer David Permut, who’s worked on a wide variety of projects over the years, has scored a first: he’s set up a half- hour sitcom with Columbia TriStar TV and NBC based on his own early years spent under the tutelage of legendary promoter Bill Sargent. Sargent was the producer of such films as “Harlow” (with Carol Lynley) and the Richard Burton “Hamlet,” and was just as enterprising a promoter. That included offering the Beatles $50 million to reunite in 1975, and, post-“Jaws,” setting up a live close-circuit fight between a man and a great white shark.\n\nPermut started as a teen selling maps to the homes of the stars on Sunset Blvd. His days with Sargent were wild, but Permut knew he was in the right place when he and Sargent filmed their stage show “Give ‘Em Hell, Harry!” with James Whitmore for $230,000, and watched it gross more than $11 million as a movie.\n\nThe show will be written by Jonathan Prince and Billy Riback. The Permut project is almost the smallscreen equivalent to Jerry Weintraub’s “The Colonel and Me,” a Warner Bros. film to be written and directed by Ron Shelton about Weintraub’s days promoting Elvis with Col. Tom Parker."
