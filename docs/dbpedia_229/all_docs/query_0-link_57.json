        "text": "Winner of the Palme d'Or and Best Actress (for Brenda Blethyn) at Cannes—Mike Leigh’s rich characterizations (with an incredible stable of actors), and trademark bittersweet take on realism transcends the soap opera trappingsUnlike Leigh’s previous effort, Naked, this is no major triumph and miracle of mise-en-scene, but I do like the detail and juxtaposition of Spall (and his wife) and their house in comparison with Blethyn. It’s a story of class (always important to Leigh)—in one scene Spall’s wife is wearing a vest that matches her wallpaper family melodrama like almost all of Leigh’s work- tough conversations almost like\n\nThis is Leigh’s fourth archiveable film but there’s little in his three previous (all very solid) efforts that would make you think he’s capable of this. This is a stylistic visual atom bomb on top of being a character study that could be compared to There Will Be Blood or Taxi Driver. Mike Leigh’s Naked is blow-your-hair-back brilliant—a big, bold masterpiece and one of the best films of the 1990s Winner of best director and actor at Cannes It starts with a handheld tracking shot of David Thewlis’ Johnny having sex with a woman (who doesn’t look happy) in\n\nSoderbergh will finish the 2010’s decade with 7 archiveable films—a decade in which he retired. I love how prolific he is and can’t wait to see what he does in 2020—but I don’t think any of those 7 films from the 2010’s will make the decade’s top 100 High Flying Bird starts with a nice tracking shot going from the street outside to a swank Manhattan restaurant with the gold ceiling as background. This film is largely in the archives because of how much attention Soderbergh pays to background. This isn’t Ocean’s Thirteen in that regard (go back and\n\nViewing 1.0 March 2019 A film that’s ambitious in ideas and script, but not overly ambitious in film as art or filmmaking if you willThere are a couple of really nice shots—one of them is late with Lupita walking into the funhouse, the other is of the young Adelaide character at night walking on the beach with the lit up roller coaster surrounding her in the deep background There are a couple of really nice shots—one of them is late with Lupita walking into the funhouse, the other is of the young Adelaide character at night walking on the\n\nMovies that are this easy to watch (this is 152 minutes that absolutely fly by) don’t come along every year. Ford v. Ferrari boasts master craft acting and writing of the highest caliber It’s not really auteur cinema—Mangold is a very fine director, a pro, and the in-race editing here is the closest thing to an aesthetic triumph – but he has fashioned an entire film that captures charm- and that needs to be applauded. Apollo 13 is like this-- The Martian had it actually too—another film that stars Damon- back in 2015. Tony Joe White's Polk Salad Annie\n\nAn intellectual deliberation on sin, doubt, yes- God’s silence, persecution and cruelty/evilIn one of the opening scenes with Andrew Garfield, Adam Driver and Ciarán Hinds there’s a very nice shot of an empty cathedral and the symmetry in the frame of the hall behind them So there’s the start of something very strong visual/formally here with the overhead “God’s eye view” shot. There’s one of the grey stairs (a stunner, here below) and another one later overhead of the boat going to Japan. It’s such a strong start. And then it drops off and the next one of these\n\nTwo directors and two films- Ray Enright and Busby Berkeley—only one (Berkeley) is the geniusThe first half is nearly all Enright (I can tell this by the body of work of the two differing directors)—it is a fine little drama, the wipe edits and transitions are a nice touch (one tearing a picture) and give it a brisk and fun paceThe narrative is cat-nip to these depression-era audiences. The idol and idiot rich. The bit with the man-servant is great. He’s always giving a crazy look or sleeping in the background. The brilliance of the film is all in\n\nMike Leigh has his own voice, world and characters not unlike Fellini, Bergman or Woody Allen – his is the blue collar (Broadbent sporting a can of beer in the first 5 minutes and you get the idea that Leigh prefers “Mike” to “Michael” for this reason) middle-lower class in Britain, family dramas, a talented stable of actors, catchy scores, and the semi-ironic titles middle-lower class in Britain, family dramas, a talented stable of actors, catchy scores, and the semi-ironic titles These characters are grasping at strawsThe ensemble includes Jim Broadbent, Stephen Rea, Timothy Spall, David Thewlis—really impressive The\n\nStark visually, bleak in tone, and heavy in subject matter --- Tim Roth (debut as a director, obviously a very talented and accomplished actor) follows in the proud British tradition of Davies, Loach and Mike Leigh—debut year – 1999—similar to Lynn Ramsay’s Ratcatcher (which is superior) as wellTwo first-time younger actors are anchored by Tilda Swinton and Ray Winstone. The daughter- Lara Belmont is good—but the Tom character- Freddie Cunliffe needs a better actor here Two first-time younger actors are anchored by Tilda Swinton and Ray Winstone. The daughter- Lara Belmont is good The boy, Tom, is a peeper\n\nAn excellent script and lead performances from Steve Martin and Michael CaineFrank Oz certainly puts a stamp on the film because this two-hander does look at feel like the similarly-winning 1991 film What About Bob? If you wonder who the artist is—director vs. cinematographer – at least here- this is shot by long-time Fassbinder and Scorsese DP Michael Ballhaus and although there are nice shots of the on location shoot in the south of France—well—yeah—this is not Scorsese or FassbinderFilled with hilarious sketches. Martin has a solo improvisational scene at the jail that is fairly famous – but for\n\n1.0 in June 2019 A subtle character study—a story of first love and addition The final shot sticks with you—it’s a giant door opening—sounds simple- but given the context of the film, her awakening, naivety (not just sexual, but about life in general)—we’re going from the sealed off movie studio here to opening the door to the outside- an amazing visual metaphor The final shot sticks with you - genius - one of the best shots of 2019 The film, and it’s in the text, references the Jean-Honoré Fragonard titular artwork—intelligent discussion between Honor Swinton Byrne and Tom Burke.\n\nWondrously- a confirmation of Mike Leigh’s auteur status in 1988. High Hopes is a contemporary family drama, an authentic character study, and a political critique of Thatcher’s 1980’sLargely plotless- everyday life and observational. Leigh is a realist and the details here feel just like the best written novels. The film revolves (as the camera rolls over to the flat next door) around three couples, a yuppie couple (Lesley Manville is one of them and her husband says “What makes this country great is a place for everyone, and everyone in his place”) couple living next door to the elderly"
