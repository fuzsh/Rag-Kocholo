        "text": "An alienated teenager, Tom (Freddie Cunliffe) saddened that he has moved away from London, must find a way to deal with a dark family secret.\n\nI stumbled across this film while working my way through film decades on Prime. I tried to remain as unaware of this film as I possibly could because I felt like any deep background knowledge would hinder what I thought.\n\nThe directorial debut of Tim Roth, this film is one of those “families have secrets” set ups where the scenes simmer with angst until the truth is finally revealed.\n\nThe initially unremarkable camera work encapsulates the mutinae of family life set amongst almost overexposed shots of an isolated house in Devon. The long silences only add to the oppressive feeling of the film.\n\nThe camera work is claustrophobic and uses music minimally as we as an audience voyeuristically watch the family drama play out, coupled with the film’s casual use of nudity it really is quite a grotty experience. Tilda Swinton is good as the mother, whereas Ray Winstone as the menacing father was quite unsettling as the film played out. At times he was genuinely terrifying.\n\nWhile this film had good elements stylistically and the ending could be left up to interpretation, I don’t think this is a film I could rewatch."
