When a seemingly normal family moves from London to rural Devon, 15-year-old Tom (Freddie Cunliffe) stumbles into a shocking secret concerning his father (Ray Winstone) and 17-year-old sister, Jessie (Lara Belmont). Afraid of breaking up the family and upsetting his mother (Tilda Swinton), who has just given birth to a baby girl, he crawls into a shell and remains there, confused and alienated. Eventually, the situation boils over, and the truth is exposed. Roth shows that he has the ability to draw extremely emotional performances from Winstone and Swinton, as well as from newcomers Belmont and Cunliffe, who provide the film with its true heart. THE WAR ZONE is a brilliantly harsh and tragic family drama.",
