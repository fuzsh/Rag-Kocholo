        "text": "If any film just makes itself, maybe The League of Gentlemen is one such film. With a tremendous cast all on top form and a tight, tense script, the director and producer team of Basil Dearden and Michael Relph maybe just let Hawkins & Co do their thing. It's a shame that crime couldn't be seen to pay in those days, but I still think the ending (won't spoil it for those who still haven't seen it) gets it just about right.\n\nI still love Whistle down the Wind (1961), directed by Forbes with Richard Attenborough producing. It's such a gentle film, maybe not so believable now (kids are far too street-wise these days) but very moving at the end I think. The music, by Malcolm Arnold, is highly memorable, [see clip below, thanks to paul bonser for this] and the location shooting, on a bleak farm in Lancashire, is worthy of the more famous and feted New Wave films. I remember there was a very underrated series a few years ago, presented by Ben Fogle, called 'Big Screen Britain', which featured short 10 minute programmes on the locations of such films. Must check on youtube to see if you can watch them on there (just checked 31/03/13 - no.) If you've not seen this film, get it from the library or from netflix and settle down one afternoon, preferably in the winter, with the fire on and a nice cup of tea and enjoy; but have a tissue ready for the sad ending....(men of course are not allowed to get tearful so we have to pretend there's something in our eye, as I always have to do at the end of It's a Wonderful Life). This is one of the saddest scenes, as Alan Bates' 'Yes' comes too late, and Kathy never hears it:\n\nThis one is pure Forbes, who wrote and directed this careful, quiet study of old age and how society provides for the elderly, but I decided to include it here although it may end up elsewhre on the website one day (an 'unsung' film maybe). [I have now done so, in the unsung films section - Feb 2017] It was a brave/foolhardy venture; it's hard to think of a topic that fitted less well alongside the obsession with youth and energy that existed at the time, and indeed it's a wonder it got made at all, given its lack of box office appeal.\n\nAlmost European arthouse in its style, this is a tale of an elderly woman (superbly played by Edith Evans) in a ground floor flat in Oldham (Greater Manchester anyway, despite what it says on wikipedia) who hears voices (although she's probably just hearing the couple upstairs through the pipes) and complains to the long-suffering local police to no effect. Her husband left her 20 years ago, and her son is only using her so that he can hide the haul from a robbery. When she finds the money by chance, she believes in her own mind that she has come into a fictional inheritance, but she is soon robbed of her money by a woman (Avis Bunnage) she meets by chance in the Social Security office, and the woman's husband and son dump her near her home in an incredibly callous manner."
