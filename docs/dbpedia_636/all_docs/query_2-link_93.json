        "text": "His first great success was The Angry Silence (1960), made on a shoestring by Beaver Films, a company which Forbes had set up with Richard Attenborough. It was an honest and compelling account of a worker who refuses to join a political strike, finds himself sent to Coventry by his mates, and loses an eye in a fight; Forbes’s script brought him an Oscar nomination and won a Bafta.\n\nAs though to prove his versatility, Forbes next scripted The League of Gentlemen (1961), a comedy originally intended for Cary Grant. Instead Jack Hawkins played the retired colonel who collects together a band of crooked ex-soldiers who — under the name of Cooperative Removals Ltd — steal £1 million from a City bank. Forbes himself had a part in the film as a piano-playing gigolo, and his screenplay was widely praised for catching the right comic tone.\n\nHe made his debut as a director in the same year with Whistle Down the Wind. The story, scripted by Keith Waterhouse from the novel by Mary Hayley Bell, concerned some Lancashire children who mistake an escaped murderer (Alan Bates) for Jesus Christ — such being his exclamation when first discovered. It was a venture which could easily have been in bad taste, but Forbes managed to tell the strange tale without mawkishness. Meanwhile, his script of Only Two Can Play (1962), from Kingsley Amis’s novel That Uncertain Feeling, showed that he retained his comic touch.\n\nThough his subsequent films were of uneven quality, Forbes had a consistent talent for creating fat parts for distinguished actresses. Three of them — Leslie Caron in The L-Shaped Room (1962), Kim Stanley in Séance on a Wet Afternoon (1964) and Edith Evans in The Whisperers (1967) — were nominated for Oscars. Forbes always placed great emphasis on his actors. “Everything should be subordinate to the performance”, he said. “That’s why I’m not highly regarded in the more esoteric cinema magazines.”\n\nHis first Hollywood film came in 1965, when Columbia invited him to write and direct King Rat (1965), from James Clavell’s novel about his experiences as a prisoner-of-war of the Japanese in Singapore’s Changi jail. Though some critics complained that moral judgment was too blithely weighted in favour of the title character (an American corporal, played by George Segal, who has the whole camp in his grip in the manner of a Chicago gangster), it would prove one of Forbes’s most powerful films. Yet his next effort, The Wrong Box (1966), from a story by Robert Louis Stevenson, proved a costly, star-studded flop undermined by whimsy.\n\nWhen John Huston walked out of the production of The Madwoman of Chaillot (1969), from Jean Giraudoux’s play, Forbes was brought in as replacement director. An inveterate “stargazer”, he delighted in the opportunity to direct Katharine Hepburn and Yul Brynner, Danny Kaye, Donald Pleasence and Richard Chamberlain, all in the same film. And the cameraman was Claude Renoir. The filming coincided with les événements in Paris. “I suppose that to dine alone in Paris with Katharine Hepburn during a French Revolution, in a private room in the hotel where Oscar Wilde died,” Forbes breathlessly recorded, “must rate three stars in any personal Michelin.” The film, though, was rewarded with rather fewer stars.\n\nHis greatest opportunity came in 1969 when, at the age of only 43, he was appointed chief of production and managing director of Associated British Picture Corporation, then recently acquired by EMI. This gave him control of Elstree studios and of the production slate that constituted a large slice of the British film industry.\n\nSeen as “the great white hope” of British cinema, Forbes swept in with ringing words and reassuring deeds calculated to endear him to critics and unions alike. “I want,” he announced, “to encourage the film of ideas which is also entertaining, which is adult, which does not pander to the lowest common denominator and which does not depend on violence or sex for its transient excitement.” At the same time he called for a truce in labour relations and, as an earnest of his good faith, abolished clocking-in and promised an end to redundancies.\n\nHe also announced that 15 feature films would be made in the next 18 months at a cost of £10 to £15 million, a programme which he described as “the most ambitious attempt to revitalise the British film industry in 20 years”. In fact, Forbes was condemned to operate on a meagre £4 million “revolving” fund which, as he complained, “never revolved”. It did not help, either, that the first three productions under his aegis — And Soon the Darkness; Hoffman (with Peter Sellers); and The Man Who Haunted Himself (all 1970) — were flops.\n\nAttacking “the pornography of violence”, Forbes pledged himself to foster family entertainments, and gave the go-ahead to two successes: The Railway Children (1970) and Tales of Beatrix Potter (1971). The Go-Between (1970) was also well-received, though The Raging Moon (1970), which he himself scripted and directed, was considered by some to be self-indulgent and a misuse of the time that should have been devoted to managerial functions.\n\nThis would not have mattered had he achieved the single blockbuster that in Hollywood regularly bails out underperformers. But he did not. On the Buses (1971) was commercially successful enough, but hardly advanced the reputation of British cinema; while Dulcima (also 1971), from an HE Bates story, appeared to some critics to be more like Cold Comfort Farm than genuine melodrama.\n\nBy then financial wrangles were undermining Forbes’s position. His real difficulty was that as both head of production and managing director, he had divided loyalties. Artists always want more money, but management must keep them on a tight rein. No one person, perhaps, could have reconciled these conflicting demands, and in May — a year before his contract was due to expire — it was announced that Forbes had resigned . He would never again be quite such a force in British cinema.\n\nBryan Forbes had been born John Theobald Clarke in the East End of London on July 22 1926, and until the age of 13 was brought up at Forest Gate. His father was employed for 40 years as a salesman for the London Letter File Company in the Farringdon Road.\n\nHe was formally educated at West Ham Secondary School, but actually at the local cinemas. “If the Splendide was my village church,” he wrote, “the Queens at the top of Woodgrange Road was my Westminster Abbey.”\n\nDuring the Second World War he had the distinction of being twice evacuated — first to Lincolnshire, where he attended Horncastle Grammar School, and then to Cornwall, where he was entrusted to the care of the Rev Canon “What-Ho” Gotto and his wife, who gave him a sense of direction and purpose.\n\nJohn Clarke made his debut with the school dramatic society and was described, somewhat ambivalently, as “probably the finest 14-year-old Shylock of his generation”. Flushed with this success, he fired off letters to famous actors, and to others who might forward his career. Only Lionel Gamlin, at the BBC, replied, and in 1942 made his protégé (now back in London) question master of Junior Brains Trust. He also renamed him Bryan Forbes.\n\nThe fledgling actor next won a scholarship to Rada. “Accent, Forbes,” Sir Kenneth Barnes, the principal, told him. “Get rid of your Cockney accent or you’ll never amount to much.” But as soon as Forbes landed the role of Richard in Eugene O’Neill’s Ah, Wilderness! at Rugby he left Rada and subsequently played in Envy My Simplicity at Brighton. Thanks to the advocacy of Joan Greenwood, soon afterwards he appeared in Emlyn Williams’s The Corn Is Green at Worthing.\n\nHe left the Army in early 1948, and in February landed a leading role in The Gathering Storm (a rewritten version of Envy My Simplicity) at the St Martin’s Theatre. Through Dennis Van Thal, casting director at Pinewood, he made his debut in films as a dying soldier in Michael Powell’s The Small Back Room (1949). This was followed by a bigger role in All Over The Town (1949), while on television he appeared in Somerset Maugham’s The Breadwinner.\n\nMeanwhile, in December 1948 Forbes had played Jimmy in Daphne du Maurier’s September Tide, at the Aldwych, with Gertrude Lawrence in the lead. This was followed in 1950 by the lead in The Holly and the Ivy at the Duchess Theatre. On the screen he had a small part in The Wooden Horse (1950). In the same year he published a book of short stories, Truth Lies Sleeping, and also began to review for The Spectator and New Statesman.\n\nIn 1951 Forbes married the actress Constance Smith, and when she went to Hollywood he threw up the chance of a role in Rattigan’s The Sound Barrier to join her there. But neither his marriage nor his career prospered in America. He wrote a number of scripts, none of which was performed, and befriended the film director Raoul Walsh, who cast him in a small role in The World In His Arms (1952), and gave him the money to return to Britain.\n\nBack home he landed a part in Appointment in London (1952), a tear-jerker about Bomber Command starring Dirk Bogarde. Then Raoul Walsh, newly arrived in Britain, gave him a part and employed him as an additional scriptwriter on a film entitled Toilers of the Sea. But it was his appearance in a B-picture, Wheel of Fire (1953), that changed Forbes’s life: while filming in Marylebone shunting yards he met Nanette Newman, and they married in 1955.\n\nSlightly built, with a boyish appearance, Forbes lacked the stature and presence for leading film roles but seemed well suited to supporting parts as petty officers and NCOs in a variety of British war pictures such as The Colditz Story (1954), I Was Monty’s Double (1958) and The Guns of Navarone (1961). He also appeared in the adaptation of An Inspector Calls (1954) and in Satellite in the Sky (1956).\n\nIncreasingly, however, he was dedicating himself to writing. He had begun by doctoring other people’s flawed scripts, but gravitated to full-scale screenplays of his own. The first of these to be filmed was Cockleshell Heroes in 1955.\n\nDuring the filming of The Baby and the Battleship (1956), in which Forbes had a small part, he again helped with the screenplay. Rank offered a five-year writing contract and in its first year he wrote five full-length screenplays. Yet none of them saw the light of day, and it seemed to Forbes in 1957 that his film career was going nowhere.\n\nHe was thinking of accepting a partnership with a garage owner when he was offered a part in Carol Reed’s The Key (1958). His screenwriting then took off, and within a short space of time he wrote the screenplay for I Was Monty’s Double and co-scripted The Captain’s Table (1958), the highly-entertaining Danger Within (1958), and Man in the Moon (1960).\n\nHe then unwisely rejected the opportunity, offered by Cubby Broccoli, to direct the first James Bond film, Dr No. And though Forbes might have done better to have refused to write the script for Of Human Bondage (1964), he was soon swept up by success and Elstree.\n\nHis post-Elstree films as a director were a mixed collection. The Stepford Wives (1974), about a commuter village outside New York where husbands have replaced their wives with complacent clones, achieved a certain vogue, and was remade in 2004 with Nicole Kidman.\n\nThe Slipper and the Rose (1976) was a version of the Cinderella story. International Velvet (1978), which Forbes produced, wrote and directed, was a next-generation sequel to National Velvet (1935), with showjumping taking the place of steeplechasing. His last two films — Better Late than Never (1983), a risqué comedy with David Niven, and The Naked Face (1984), a Mafia thriller with Roger Moore and Rod Steiger — did not enhance his reputation.\n\nBy then he was largely working outside film. From 1958 he had owned a vast 1930s house, described as “a cross between a biscuit factory and an early Odeon cinema”, at Virginia Water in Surrey, and in 1971 he opened a bookshop nearby. (He had always been an obsessive book collector, with a particular interest in books about Napoleon.) There he served behind the counter on Saturdays and poured coffee for customers. He also acquired an art gallery in the West End.\n\nIn the 1970s he spent much time writing novels. His first, The Distant Laughter (1972), was followed two years later by Notes for a Life , a highly readable autobiography. Ned’s Girl (1977) was a biography of Dame Edith Evans, about whom Forbes had earlier made a documentary for Yorkshire Television. That Despicable Race (1980) was a history of the British acting tradition from Elizabethan times to the present.\n\nMeanwhile, he maintained his interest in the theatre. The Macbeth he directed at the Old Vic in 1980, with Peter O’Toole in the lead, became a celebrated theatrical disaster, to the extent of being a commercial success. By all accounts, rehearsals were a nightmare, and on opening night, with the curtain about to rise, Forbes found his star stark naked in the dressing room, sporting only a Gauloise. After the performance, Forbes took the unusual step of appearing on stage to defend his company and crew and was greeted with the catcall: “It can’t get any worse.” Forbes’s subsequent theatrical ventures (the whodunit Killing Jessica in 1986 and a production of Graham Greene’s The Living Room in 1987) fared only slightly better.\n\nIn 1990 Forbes suffered a severe disappointment when his 58th script — for a film about Charlie Chaplin — was rejected in favour of one by William Boyd. The decision was made by Universal, but Forbes was hurt that his long-time ally Richard Attenborough did not stand up for his version.\n\nHe was appointed CBE in 2004, and in 2007 received a Bafta Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nIn 1975, during the filming of The Slipper and the Rose, Forbes experienced agonising sensations in his right leg; in addition his eyesight was affected and his balance shaky. Doctors diagnosed multiple sclerosis. By adopting a gluten-free diet supplemented by vitamins, and dosing himself daily with oil of evening primrose, he succeeded in keeping the disease at bay. “I hope I don’t have a lingering end,” he said. “I’d prefer to fall face down over a bottle of Chablis.”\n\nBy his second marriage to Nanette Newman, Forbes had two daughters; the elder married the actor John Standing (Sir John Leon, 4th Bt)."
