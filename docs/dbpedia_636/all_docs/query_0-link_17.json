After his military service, completed between 1945 and 1948, he played numerous secondary roles in British film and theater productions, although he was forced to change his name from British Equity to avoid confusion with the teenage actor John Clark. At that time he also began to write for the big screen, receiving his first credit in Survivors: 2 of 1955. Another well-known screenplay written by Forbes at that time was The League of Gentlemen of 1959, in which he also had a part from actor.\n\nHe formed a film production company together with his collaborator Richard Attenborough in 1959, Beaver Films, with which he produced La tortura del silenzio (The Angry Silence) in 1960, on a screenplay by Forbes in which Attenborough played the part of the protagonist. In 1961 he made his debut as a director in Whistle Down the Wind, still produced by Attenborough. in 1964, Forbes wrote and directed Â£ 20,000 for Amanda, for which in 1965 he won the Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America, in the category \"Best Screenplay of a Foreign Film\". In the same year he wrote the third film adaptation of the novel by William Somerset Maugham Schiavo d'amore. In 1965 he went to Hollywood to make King Rat.\n\nFor The Torture of Silence in 1961 he was nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay and for Scarpetta and Rose (The Slipper and the Rose: The Story of Cinderella), a film he directed in 1977, he was nominated for a Golden Globe for the best foreign film.\n\nIn 1969 he was appointed as chief of production and managing director of the Associated British film studio (EMI), but for him the experience was not positive and he resigned in 1971, even though he was still partially responsible for the production of The Railway Children ( 1970). After this experience, the releases of Forbes' new films diminished, despite having a good success as director of La Angry Moon (1971) and La fabbrica delle Mogli (1975). The shoe and the rose (1976), International Velvet (1978).\n\nMarried in first marriage to Constance Smith in 1951, the marriage ended in 1955, and in the same year he married his second wife, actress Nanette Newman. The couple had two daughters: Emma Forbes and Sarah Standing (1959), the latter wife of actor John Standing."
