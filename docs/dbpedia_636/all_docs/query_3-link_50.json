        "text": "Being a Psychotherapist, we usually have a tendency to think that we are aware of the all the intricacies in our clients life and with continuous inflow of clients the process of therapy tends to become all robotic. Working with children sometimes becomes so insightful and provides us with many ‚Äúaha‚Äù moments. Sharing my experience of today while having a session with a child, discussing about their early life experiences, their current thought about themselves, others constant message for them and what not. My whole attention suddenly went towards ‚Äústrokes‚Äù that the child has been receiving not just by others but by themselves as well. The power of strokes is immense and unconsciously passed on very lightly during therapy. Moving beyond the therapy space, as family, friends, teachers, mentors we all forget the power that appropriate strokes can have in shaping the future of the child and unfortunately the plight is really bad! It can be as simple as I am proud of you, I appreciate your effort. One sentence has the power to change the direction of a child‚Äôs world! These simple anecdotes in my opinion help us to build a stronger individual and prepares children to be more confident and resilient in approaching the challenging situations in their lives! TransactionalAnalysis#psychotherpay#strokes#mentalhealthawareness#therapyinsights\n\nTHERAPY IS A BIT WEIRD. I was having this conversation with my supervisor and she said to me - Therapy is a bit weird, isn‚Äôt it? I mean you walk into a stranger‚Äôs office and then you start to share such intimate personal information with them. I thought about that and indeed, I agree. When prospective clients call to enquire about therapy, if its their first time, as is with a lot of people, they ask me often ‚Äì How does this help? And I used to struggle to explain to them and answer their question. Mostly because, therapy isn‚Äôt prescriptive. No, I can‚Äôt tell you how many sessions you‚Äôre going to take. Over time I prep my clients by letting them know how it is a painstakingly slow process. How it is a space where there is a lot of honesty, listening, followed by conversation and challenging belief systems at a pace that feels ok to them. I have come across different therapists with different styles of therapy. Some work short term, offering a package of 12 sessions or so and some work with clients for months or even years. The end goal of therapy is to not need therapy. I think. However, it takes some time to get there. While most people who come in to begin their work with me, know of this, in their waking world, the urgency stays. How does it help? Something shifts when one provides a safe space to express. Sometimes the silence in the room helps, sometimes its pointed questions, at a pace that feels alright to the client. There is a movement in energy in some form which transcends in the other areas of life. Eventually. So yes, it‚Äôs a bit weird. And we do our own work with trust building with the client. But, in my personal experience, therapy has played such a huge role to get me to where I am and let‚Äôs say I am a believer in the work and in the process. What's your experience with therapy? I'd love to hear! https://nivritti.co.in\n\nONE WEEK LEFT! REGISTRATION CLOSES TOMORROW! Group is more impactful than individual therapy. This is because with all the various dyads in a group setting, we have full access to our entire role repertoire. Our role repertoire is comprised of all the roles we play in life: child, caregiver, protector, peacekeeper, etc. With these roles available to us, the group facilitators can bring us to greater insight than in the isolated space of individual work. If you are stable in your trauma recovery journey and you're ready for new depths, join us Friday, July 19th from 9:00-4:00 pm. We will use psychodrama, Somatic Experiencing, and Internal Family Systems to take your trauma recovery journey to a level you didn't even know existed. What do our clients say about this group? ‚ÄúI've had some HUGE shifts in behavior with the work we're doing. I am not getting triggered all over the place...I have stopped people-pleasing so much...I'm able to say no and not feel guilty, and ask for what I need and not feel the need to explain and over-explain.\" \"I feel closer to myself and others. The work has catapulted me toward more willingness of self-discovery.\" Register: https://lnkd.in/e94jAc_v #EMDR #InternalFamilySystems #SomaticTherapy #SomaticMovement #SomaticExperiencing #SomaticHealing #TraumaRecovery #TraumaTherapy #TraumaHealing #DevelopmentalTrauma #ChildhoodTrauma #CPTSD #ComplexPTSD #ComplexTrauma #RVA #RichmondVA #ODAT #SoberLife #InnerChildHealing #InnerChildWork #Sobercurious #RecoveryJourney #RecoveryWarrior #GroupTherapy #GroupWork #Psychodrama\n\n~ On Closure in Therapy ~ Recently, I bid adieu to the very first client I saw as part of my private practice. The progression was gradual, from weekly therapy sessions, to monthly, to ever-so-often. Knowing that your client has reached a point where they don't need you or your continual support is an absolute moment of joy and pride for a therapist. YET, it can be so bittersweet. Therapy is never one-sided. My favourite thing to tell my clients is \"WE are in therapy\". This is because WE - therapist and client - take this journey together. Where my clients climb, so do I. And yet, with each client, I climb different terrains and take different roads to the destination of wellbeing. On this road, we BOTH learn. For my clients, they may learn to fight their inner demons, regulate their emotions and find their identity. For me, not only do I learn the ins and outs of running a business, but on a deeper level, I see how each person is cast from a different mould, with unique eccentricities that make them who they are. I learn to hold my own emotions, how people with so much trauma and baggage still want to unlearn and heal in the bravest possible ways. So, when we decide that our therapeutic journeys end here, it signifies to me that the road was rocky, but we made it. Therapist and client are meant to go their separate ways; waves of sadness and joy mingle together to create a bittersweet feeling. This, it's closure for the \"WE\". To all the people I've had the privilege of calling my clients, I want you to know, I learnt so much from you each session. Onwards and upwards! üåª\n\nAt Khiron Clinics, we integrate a bottom-up psychotherapy approach with other therapeutic tools that prioritise the body and expressive mind. Our team includes specialised professionals in trauma-informed art therapy, which offers a safe and calming space for exploration. Art, music, movement, play, and drama-based interventions have gained increasing recognition as effective therapeutic approaches for healing psychological trauma. Verbalising traumatic experiences can be challenging for many survivors, and even those who can articulate their experiences may face the burden of repeatedly recounting them in traditional talk-based therapy settings. This process can be mentally and physically draining and carries the risk of retraumatisation, where clients may feel like they are reliving their trauma. Art-based therapies offer an alternative. These modalities create a space that transcends the confines of traditional talk-based therapy, allowing both client and therapist to step into a realm that encourages greater comfort and freedom of expression. At Khiron, we believe in the power of diverse approaches to trauma processing. We empower our clients to embrace their best possible lives by employing a range of modalities, knowing that healing can manifest in different ways. #therapy #mentalhealth #healing\n\nWhy listening to YOUR body is the key to helping your clients. In this group, we learn bottom-up skills from the bottom-up. Meaning that instead of talking about theory and application, we will be practicing theory and application. Our professional stuck points are a reflection of our personal stuck points. Be prepared to gain insight into your own nervous system needs while also gaining the tools to better support the nervous system of others. On July 5th, we will focus on how to bring the body into the psychotherapy process. Participants will be able to: 1) Identify 2 evidence based reasons to use body based methods in psychotherapy 2) Define interoception 3) Identify how interoception is important for both therapists and clients 4) Identify ways to ensure that bringing the body based treatment modalities into session is safe and trauma informed. Join us in August when we will have an overview of action methods and celebrate our practice turning 5! As a gift, we want you to bring a friend for absolutely FREE! https://wix.to/YONPYGY\n\nAt Khiron Clinics, we integrate a bottom-up psychotherapy approach with other therapeutic tools that prioritise the body and expressive mind.

What they truly need is to be held with acceptance. Perhaps our clients don‚Äôt need to have anything poured into them. They need what‚Äôs inside of them to be cooked. The only information I give clients is my understanding of my area of expertise, which is a framework & a way of working. I typically might that the reason people generally suffer, & the symptoms that are associated with their suffering come from 1 source, something they couldn‚Äôt be taken in stride & handled Any therapy/healing is simply mastering what couldn‚Äôt be taken in stride A way to do this is easy to describe. When something can‚Äôt be taken in stride, in that moment a discomfort is born. We unconsciously identify with it, & relive echoes of its story over & over again. When we can choose to find the discomfort & become it from the inside out in the same way an actor chooses to fully embody a role without identifying with it, we begin the road to freedom from suffering. We no longer say I am it, we say, I am identified with the one who is experiencing it, holding it, & witnessing it with lovingkindness, while knowing I am not it. ultimately, symptoms, or reactivity releases #EstherGoldsteinLCSW #Mindfulness #Somatics #SomaticTherapy #SomaticHealing #MindfulnessTherapy #LifeCenteredTherapy #Boundaries"
