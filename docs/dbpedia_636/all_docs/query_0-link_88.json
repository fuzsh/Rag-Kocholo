These disorders can be an early sign of dementia or Parkinson disease and are associated with increased mortality. September 2023\n\nChronic Kidney Disease: Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n\nAndrew J. Goodbred and Robert C. Langan\n\nChronic kidney disease affects approximately 15% of the U.S. population; however, 9 out of 10 people do not know they have impaired renal function. The most common causes of chronic kidney disease are diabetes mellitus (38%) and hypertension (26%). More advanced disease is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and death. December 2023\n\nChildhood and Adolescent Sports-Related Overuse Injuries\n\nLaura J. Lintner, Jeremy Swisher, and Zachary E. Sitton\n\nWith early sports specialization, overuse injuries are becoming more common. Proper technique, resistance training, protective equipment, and avoiding early sports specialization are necessary for injury prevention in adolescents. December 2023\n\nDiagnosis and Management of Sodium Disorders: Hyponatremia and Hypernatremia\n\nNathaniel E. Miller, David Rushlow, and Stephen K. Stacey\n\nSodium abnormalities are electrolyte disorders associated with significant morbidity and mortality. An understanding of the pathophysiologic basis of these conditions can be helpful in diagnosis and treatment. November 2023\n\nJoint and Soft Tissue Injections\n\nJulie A. Creech-Organ, Sarah E. Szybist, and Jacqueline L. Yurgil\n\nMusculoskeletal conditions are reported by 48% of the population and are a significant component of primary care visits. A patient’s understanding of risks, benefits, and alternatives to injection promotes patient-oriented outcomes. August 2023\n\nFatigue in Adults: Evaluation and Management\n\nKelly M. Latimer, Althea Gunther, and Michael Kopec\n\nFatigue is among the top 10 reasons patients visit primary care offices, and it significantly affects patients’ well-being and occupational safety. Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome is a chronic, severe, and potentially debilitating disorder. July 2023\n\nTonsillitis and Tonsilloliths: Diagnosis and Management\n\nKelly Lacy Smith, Rachel Hughes, and Palee Myrex\n\nTonsillitis is most commonly caused by viruses. Treatment is focused on supportive care; however, if tonsillitis is caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus, it should be treated with antibiotics to prevent complications. Tonsillar stones may be associated with recurrent tonsillitis and are managed expectantly. January 2023\n\nPsoriasis: Recognition and Management Strategies\n\nKathryn K. Garner, Kattie D. S. Hoy, and Adriana M. Carpenter\n\nPsoriasis is an inflammatory skin and systemic disorder that affects 3.2% of the U.S. population, including 1% of children. It presents in various forms; treatment strategies are similar for most forms of psoriasis and based on body surface area involved. Special consideration is needed for treatment of children and patients who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or trying to conceive. December 2023\n\nOver-the-Counter Medications in Pregnancy\n\nElizabeth Allison Powers, Ryan Tewell, and Max Bayard\n\nThis article reviews the safety and effectiveness of over-the-counter medications for common conditions of pregnancy. October 2023\n\nPleural Effusion: Diagnostic Approach in Adults\n\nJoy Shen-Wagner, Christine Gamble, and Phyllis MacGilvray\n\nEvaluation of pleural effusion focuses on differentiating exudates from transudates, analyzing fluids, and determining the need for thoracentesis or specialty consultation. Accurate and early diagnosis is critical, with delays potentially causing complications and increased mortality. November 2023\n\n2022\n\nOffice-Based Urinalysis: A Comprehensive Review\n\nNathan Hitzeman, Dineen Greer, and Erik Carpio\n\nUrinalysis is a simple, inexpensive means of detecting urologic and systemic conditions such as infection, urolithiasis, malignancy, and metabolic diseases. Visual inspection of the urine, familiarity with dipstick testing, and point-of-care micros-copy are important diagnostic skills for family physicians. Urine dipstick test kits are widely available and easy to use. Results may be interpreted visually off the dipstick or by an automated machine. July 2022\n\nAntibiotic Use in Acute Upper Respiratory Tract Infections\n\nDenise K. C. Sur and Monica L. Plesa\n\nStudies show that many upper respiratory tract infections are treated unnecessarily with antibiotics. Antibiotics should not be used for the common cold, influenza, COVID-19, or laryngitis. Evidence supports antibiotic use in most cases of acute otitis media, group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis, and epiglottitis, and in a limited percentage of acute rhinosinusitis cases. December 2022\n\nSacroiliac Joint Dysfunction: Diagnosis and Treatment\n\nDavid P. Newman and Adam T. Soto\n\nSacroiliac joint dysfunction is a common cause of low back pain. A set of provocation tests that together have high sensitivity and specificity can help differentiate sacroiliac joint dysfunction from other causes of back and lower extremity pain. Manipulation combined with exercise can be an effective first-line treatment. March 2022\n\nEvidence-Based Contraception: Common Questions and Answers\n\nScott L. Paradise, Corinne A. Landis, and David A. Klein\n\nPrimary care clinicians are uniquely situated to provide holistic contraceptive care. This article addresses emergency contraception, fertility awareness methods of contraception, long-acting reversible contraception, and contraception options for transgender people with a uterus. September 2022\n\nArthropod Bites and Stings\n\nJoel Herness, Matthew J. Snyder, and Raquelle Suzanne Newman\n\nInsect and arachnid bites and stings account for up to 1 million emergency department visits annually in the United States. Arthropods' most significant effects on humans are as vectors for infectious diseases, and direct effects of their bites and stings are typically only a self-limited nuisance. August 2022\n\nCommon Oral Lesions\n\nDavid A. Randall, N. Lyn Wilson Westmark, and Brad W. Neville\n\nPatients with oral disease may present to their family physician before a dentist. Some lesions are purely localized to the mouth, and others have systemic manifestations. Common conditions include aphthous stomatitis, candidiasis, herpetic stomatitis, leukoplakia, erythroplakia, and oral lichen planus. April 2022\n\nFever of Unknown Origin in Adults\n\nAïsha David and Jeffrey D. Quinlan\n\nFever of unknown origin is defined as a clinically documented temperature of 101°F or higher on several occasions, coupled with an unrevealing diagnostic workup. The possible causes are typically categorized as infection, malignancy, noninfectious inflammatory disease, or miscellaneous. February 2022\n\nCluster Headache: Rapid Evidence Review\n\nOmojo Odihi Malu, Jonathan Bailey, and Matthew Kendall Hawks\n\nPatients with cluster headache experience severe unilateral pain located in the orbital, supraorbital, and/or temporal region that occurs from every other day up to eight times per day and lasts from 15 to 180 minutes. Attacks occur in clusters, are episodic or chronic, and are associated with ipsilateral autonomic symptoms and a sense of agitation or restlessness. January 2022\n\nLong COVID: Rapid Evidence Review\n\nEric Herman, Elizabeth Shih, and Anthony Cheng\n\nPostacute sequelae of COVID-19, or long COVID, has affected millions of people, with a broad range of symptoms such as fatigue, postexertional malaise, and cognitive dysfunction. Symptoms usually resolve over time. However, there are varying rates of recovery and outcomes, and the long-term prognosis is unclear. This article summarizes the best available evidence for the diagnosis and management of long COVID. November 2022\n\nMetabolic Surgery for Adult Obesity: Common Questions and Answers\n\nElaine Seaton Banerjee, Robin Schroeder, and T. Daniel Harrison\n\nMetabolic surgery reduces all-cause mortality by 30% to 40% at two to 15 years compared with patients with obesity who did not have surgery. Remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus occurs in as many as 70% of patients two years after surgery and is maintained at 10 years in about 30% of patients; other obesity-related conditions are also greatly reduced, and quality of life improves. June 2022\n\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder in Adults\n\nKatharine C. DeGeorge, Molly Grover, and Gregory S. Streeter\n\nGeneralized anxiety disorder and panic disorder are common mental health conditions often seen in primary care. Evaluation should be considered in patients who express recurrent, pervasive worry or present with multiple somatic symptoms not attributed to underlying medical conditions. Effective treatments include cognitive behavior therapy and antidepressants. August 2022\n\nHeart Murmurs in Children: Evaluation and Management\n\nBrian Ford, Sebastian Lara, and James Park\n\nThe lifetime incidence of murmurs in children is high. The presence of a murmur can indicate conditions ranging from no discernable pathology to acquired or congenital heart disease. All infants, with or without a murmur, should have pulse oximetry screening to detect underlying critical congenital heart disease. March 2022\n\nPruritus: Diagnosis and Management\n\nJedda Rupert and James David Honeycutt\n\nThe etiology of pruritus is complex and can include histamine, serotonin, and neuropeptide release, and neuronal itch signal transmission. General management includes trigger avoidance, liberal emollient use, limiting water exposure, and administration of oral antihistamines and topical corticosteroids. January 2022\n\nSmoking Cessation Interventions\n\nHeidi L. Gaddey, MaryAnn Dakkak, and Nicole Marie Jackson\n\nCigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States despite its known health effects. Although nearly one-half of people who smoke try to quit each year, only up to 1 in 20 who quit without support achieve abstinence for at least six months. November 2022\n\nBarrett Esophagus: Rapid Evidence Review\n\nCarl Bryce, Merima Bucaj, and Renee Gazda\n\nBarrett esophagus is estimated to affect up to 5.6% of the U.S. population. Risk factors for Barrett esophagus include gastroesophageal reflux disease, obesity, age older than 50 years, male sex, tobacco use, and a family history of Barrett esophagus or esophageal carcinoma. October 2022\n\nAcute Headache in Adults: A Diagnostic Approach\n\nAnthony J. Viera and Brian Antono\n\nA detailed history and physical examination can distinguish between key features of benign primary headaches and concerning symptoms that warrant further evaluation for a secondary headache. Among primary headache disorders, tension-type is the most common, although migraine headache is more debilitating. September 2022\n\nOrthostatic Hypotension: A Practical Approach\n\nMichael J. Kim and Jennifer Farrell\n\nOrthostatic hypotension is defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure of 20 mm Hg or more, or a decrease in diastolic blood pressure of 10 mm Hg or more within three minutes of standing from the supine position. Goals of treatment are reducing symptoms and improving quality of life. January 2022\n\nDiverticular Disease: Rapid Evidence Review\n\nJustin Bailey, Sheev Dattani, and Ann Jennings\n\nThis rapid evidence review briefly summarizes signs and symptoms of and tests and clinical prediction rules for diagnosing acute diverticulitis. Management is guided by symptom severity, development of complicated disease, and patient response to treatment. August 2022\n\nCeliac Disease: Common Questions and Answers\n\nPamela M. Williams, Lisa M. Harris, and Michael R. Odom\n\nCeliac disease may present with a variety of manifestations and develop at any age. This article presents evidence-based answers to common questions about the evaluation and management of celiac disease. July 2022\n\nAcute Diarrhea in Adults\n\nErica S. Meisenheimer, Carly Epstein, and Derrick Thiel In the United States, diarrhea accounts for an estimated 179 million outpatient visits, 500,000 hospitalizations, and more than 5,000 deaths annually, resulting in approximately one episode of acute diarrheal illness per person per year. Infectious noninflammatory diarrhea is typically viral in etiology and is the most frequent presentation; however, bacterial causes are also common and may be related to travel or foodborne illness. July 2022\n\n2021\n\nHip Pain in Adults: Evaluation and Differential Diagnosis\n\nRachel Chamberlain\n\nHip pain usually localizes anteriorly, laterally, or posteriorly. A focused history and physical examination can help differentiate the causes of hip pain, which is important for prescribing effective therapy. The history should include personal history of hip problems, sports activities, and injuries; family history of hip problems; and the location and quality of pain, aggravating and alleviating factors, and mechanical symptoms. Physical examination should include evaluation of gait, range of motion, and muscle strength; palpation of the painful area; and special tests as indicated. If imaging is needed, standing radiography of the hip and pelvis should be the initial test. January 15, 2021\n\nOnychomycosis: Rapid Evidence Review\n\nWinfred Taylor Frazier, Zuleica M. Santiago-Delgado, and Kenneth C. Stupka II\n\nOnychomycosis is a chronic fungal infection of the fingernail or toenail bed, causing brittle, discolored, and thickened nails. Confirming the diagnosis with a potassium hydroxide preparation is recommended before initiating treatment, which can include oral or topical therapies. Treatment choice should be based on shared decision-making. October 2021\n\nIrritable Bowel Syndrome: Questions and Answers for Effective Care\n\nJohn M. Wilkinson and Margaret C. Gill\n\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a heterogeneous group of conditions related to specific biologic and cellular abnormalities that are not fully understood. Psychological factors do not cause IBS, but many people with IBS also have an anxious or depressed mood, prior adverse life events, or psychosocial stressors. Physicians should understand the concerns and expectations of patients and the models that patients use to explain their illness and should empathetically respond to psychosocial cues. Anxiety related to the unpredictability of symptoms may have a greater effect on quality of life than the symptoms themselves. Patients who meet symptom-based criteria and have no alarm features may be confidently diagnosed with few tests. Treatments should focus on symptom relief and improved quality of life. June 15, 2021\n\nHome Blood Pressure Monitoring\n\nJeffrey M. Weinfeld, Kathryn M. Hart, and Jose D. Vargas\n\nHome blood pressure monitoring can confirm the diagnosis of hypertension after an elevated in-office blood pressure measurement. Although ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is the diagnostic standard for measurement, home blood pressure monitoring is more practical and accessible to patients. September 2021\n\nTopical Corticosteroids: Choice and Application\n\nStephen K. Stacey and Mark McEleney\n\nTopical corticosteroids are an essential tool for treating inflammatory skin conditions. These medications are classified by strength and the risk of adverse effects such as atrophy, striae, rosacea, telangiectasias, purpura, and other cutaneous and systemic reactions. The quantity prescribed depends on the duration of treatment, the frequency of application, the skin location, and the total surface area treated. March 15, 2021\n\nHypothyroidism: Diagnosis and Treatment\n\nStephen A. Wilson, Leah A. Stem, and Richard D. Bruehlman\n\nClinical hypothyroidism is present in one in 300 people in the United States, with a higher prevalence in female and older patients. Symptoms range from minimal to life-threatening. More common symptoms include cold intolerance, fatigue, weight gain, dry skin, constipation, and voice changes. The signs and symptoms that suggest thyroid dysfunction are nonspecific and nondiagnostic. A diagnosis is based on blood levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxine. There is no evidence that population screening is beneficial. Symptom relief and normalized thyroid-stimulating hormone levels are achieved with levothyroxine replacement therapy. May 15, 2021\n\nTinnitus: Diagnosis and Management\n\nSarah N. Dalrymple, Sarah H. Lewis, and Samantha Philman\n\nTinnitus is the perception of sound in the absence of an objective internal or external source. Tinnitus is a symptom, not a disease, and although it is typically not associated with a dangerous condition, it can significantly affect an individual’s quality of life. Guidelines recommend a standard approach to history and physical examination to determine the etiology, followed by audiometric testing and imaging, laboratory studies, and other testing as appropriate. Cognitive behavior therapy is the only treatment that has been shown to improve quality of life in patients with tinnitus. Avoidance of noise exposure may help prevent the development or progression of tinnitus. June 1, 2021\n\nRecent-Onset Altered Mental Status: Evaluation and Management\n\nBrian Veauthier, Jaime R. Hornecker, and Tabitha Thrasher\n\nPotential precipitating factors for the recent onset of altered mental status can be multifactorial and include central nervous system insults, systemic infections, metabolic disturbances, toxin exposure, medications, chronic systemic diseases, and psychiatric conditions. Clinicians must quickly identify and treat reversible causes to avoid poor patient outcomes. November 2021\n\nCare of the College Student\n\nBrian K. Unwin, Jeffrey Goodie, Brian V. Reamy, and Jeffrey D. Quinlan\n\nAlthough generally healthy, about 20% of students who attend college have special health care needs, including asthma, diabetes mellitus, and learning, mental health, and substance use disorders. Physicians can facilitate the transition of a youth to an adult model of health care by using structured processes to orient the youth to self-care. August 2021\n\nEating Disorders in Primary Care: Diagnosis and Management\n\nDavid A. Klein, Jillian E. Sylvester, and Natasha A. Schvey\n\nEating disorders are potentially life-threatening conditions characterized by disordered eating and weight-control behaviors that impair physical health and psychosocial functioning. Up to 8% of females and 2% of males are affected during their lifetimes. At least one-third of persons with disordered eating develop persistent symptoms that remain 20 years postdiagnosis. Co-occurring mood, anxiety, substance use, personality, or somatic disorders are identified in more than two-thirds of persons with eating disorders. Early intervention with symptom improvement decreases the risk of a protracted course and long-term pathology. January 1, 2021\n\nUnintentional Weight Loss in Older Adults\n\nHeidi L. Gaddey and Kathryn K. Holder\n\nUnintentional weight loss in people older than 65 years is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Treatment should focus on feeding assistance, addressing contributing medications, providing appealing foods, and social support. July 2021\n\nThe Preparticipation Physical Evaluation\n\nJames MacDonald, Marie Schaefer, and Justin Stumph\n\nThe preparticipation physical evaluation (PPE) is a common primary care medical visit for young athletes. In 2019, the American Academy of Pediatrics published updated PPE recommendations. The general goals outlined in these guidelines include determining general physical and psychological health; evaluating for life-threatening or disabling conditions; and serving as an entry point into the health care system for those without a medical home or primary care physician. The PPE should include a structured physical examination with focus on the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and neurologic systems. Screening for depression, anxiety disorders, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is also recommended. Consideration should be taken to address the needs and concerns of transgender athletes and athletes with physical and intellectual disabilities. May 1, 2021\n\nInterpreting SARS-CoV-2 Diagnostic Tests: Common Questions and Answers\n\nWilliam D. Nettleton\n\nThe spectrum of asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 transmission presents challenges for evaluating SARS-CoV-2 test performance for diagnostic or screening purposes and for interpreting test results. Molecular and antigen SARS-CoV-2 tests both have high specificity. However, antigen tests generally have lower sensitivity and thus greater potential for false-negative results, especially when performed more than five days after the onset of symptoms. This article addresses common questions about SARS-CoV-2 testing and presents an approach to interpreting diagnostic test results. April 15, 2021\n\nHealth Maintenance for Women of Reproductive Age\n\nHeather L. Paladine, Himabindu Ekanadham, and Daniela C. Diaz\n\nThis article focuses on screening and counseling for health conditions that are more prevalent in, or have a unique impact on, women, transgender men, and nonbinary individuals of reproductive age. Health issues including cardiovascular risk factors, obesity, hypertension, cancer, depression, intimate partner violence, sexually transmitted infections, and unhealthy drug and alcohol use should be considered. To have the greatest impact on health, physicians should focus on U.S. Preventive Services Task Force grade A and B recommendations with patients. February 15, 2021\n\nBipolar Disorders: Evaluation and Treatment\n\nGabrielle Marzani and Amy Price Neff\n\nBipolar disorders are common mental health conditions of variable severity that are difficult to diagnose. New diagnostic criteria and specifiers with attention on mixed features and anxious distress aid the physician in recognizing episode severity and prognosis. Early recognition and treatment of bipolar disorders improve outcomes. Physicians should consider bipolar disorder in any patient presenting with depression. Pharmacotherapy with mood stabilizers is a first-line treatment that should be continued indefinitely because of the risk of patient relapse. Active lifestyle approaches include good nutrition, exercise, and sleep hygiene. Monotherapy with antidepressants is contraindicated during episodes with mixed features, manic episodes, and in bipolar I disorder. Psychotherapy is a useful adjunct to pharmacotherapy. Patients and their support systems should be educated about the chronic nature of the illness, possible relapse, suicidality, environmental triggers, and the effectiveness of early intervention. February 15, 2021\n\nPeripheral Nerve Entrapment and Injury in the Upper Extremity\n\nSabrina Silver, Christopher C. Ledford, Kendall J. Vogel, and James J. Arnold\n\nPeripheral nerves in the upper extremities are at risk of injury and entrapment because of their superficial nature and length. Injury can result from trauma, anatomic abnormalities, systemic disease, and entrapment. Most peripheral nerve injuries seen by family physicians will involve neurapraxia, resulting from entrapment along the anatomic course of the nerve. History and physical examination alone are often enough to identify the injury or entrapment; advanced diagnostic testing with magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasonography, or electrodiagnostic studies helps to confirm the clinical diagnosis and is indicated if conservative management is ineffective. Initial treatment is conservative, with surgical options available for refractory injuries or entrapment caused by anatomic abnormalities. March 1, 2021\n\nNutrition Support Therapy\n\nMary N. R. Lesser and Lenard I. Lesser\n\nNutrition support therapy is the delivery of formulated enteral or parenteral nutrients to maintain or restore nutrition status. Family physicians can provide nutrition support therapy to patients at risk of malnutrition when it would improve clinical outcomes or quality of life. Physicians should initiate a thorough nutrition screening and assessment to determine an individual’s nutrition status and the potential need for nutrition support therapy. December 2021\n\nAlcohol Withdrawal Syndrome: Outpatient Management\n\nSamuel M. Tiglao, Erica S. Meisenheimer, and Robert C. Oh\n\nApproximately one-half of patients with alcohol use disorder who abruptly stop or reduce their alcohol use will develop signs or symptoms of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome can lead to tremors, insomnia, nausea and vomiting, hallucinations, anxiety, and agitation. September 2021\n\nTelemedicine Management of Musculoskeletal Issues\n\nNicole T. Yedlinsky and Rebecca L. Peebles\n\nTelemedicine has become a valuable tool during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Musculoskeletal issues are a common reason for primary care visits and can often be managed using telemedicine, especially if a standardized approach is used. This article discusses telemedicine methods and techniques, including visit preparation, virtual history collection and physical examination, and initial treatment options. Findings from the virtual history and physical examination usually suggest a likely diagnosis. However, physicians should have a low threshold for proceeding with further evaluation, including in-person visits, if the diagnosis or initial management is unclear. February 1, 2021\n\nInitiating Hormonal Contraception\n\nRuth Lesnewski\n\nMost patients can safely begin using hormonal contraception at any point during their menstrual cycle. A flexible, patient-centered approach to initiating contraception promotes health and enhances patients’ reproductive autonomy. A recent Papanicolaou test is not necessary before prescribing hormonal contraception. Most patients can begin using progestin-only contraceptives immediately after childbirth. Delaying contraception to wait for the next menses or for an appointment creates unnecessary barriers for patients. Clinicians can facilitate the use of hormonal contraception by providing anticipatory guidance about common side effects, giving comprehensive information about available contraceptive choices, honoring patients’ preferences, and eliminating office-related barriers. March 1, 2021\n\n2020\n\nOutpatient Management of Covid-19: Rapid Evidence Review\n\nAnthony Cheng, Dominic Caruso, and Craig McDougall\n\nWhen possible, patients with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 should be triaged via telehealth before they receive in-person care. There are no evidence-based treatments appropriate for use in the outpatient setting; management is supportive and should include education about isolation. In hospitalized patients, remdesivir should be considered to reduce time to recovery, and low-dose dexamethasone should be considered in patients who require supplemental oxygen. October 15, 2020 [Updated March 1, 2021]\n\nManaging Hypertension Using Combination Therapy\n\nDustin K. Smith, Robert P. Lennon, and Peter B. Carlsgaard\n\nMost adults with primary hypertension will eventually require treatment with at least two antihypertensive agents. This article focuses on combination therapy—when to initiate it, choice of agents, and special populations whose comorbid conditions influence those choices. March 15, 2020\n\nAcute Chest Pain in Adults: Outpatient Evaluation\n\nJohn R. McConaghy, Malvika Sharma, and Hiten Patel\n\nApproximately 1% of primary care office visits are for chest pain. Initial evaluation is based on determining whether the patient needs to be referred to a higher level of care to rule out acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Age, sex, and type of chest pain can predict the likelihood of coronary artery disease. Patients with suspicion of ACS should be transported to the emergency department. Those with low or intermediate risk can undergo outpatient testing. In those with low suspicion for ACS, consider costochondritis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and anxiety states. Other less common considerations include acute pericarditis, pneumonia, and heart failure. December 15, 2020\n\nFunctional Dyspepsia: Evaluation and Management\n\nAnne Mounsey, Amir Barzin, and Ashley Reitz\n\nDyspepsia affects up to 30% of the general population in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, with 70% of patients having functional dyspepsia. Symptoms include postprandial fullness, early satiety, and epigastric pain or burning. Perform a dyspepsia endoscopy for patients 60 years or older. For patients younger than 60 years, a test and treat strategy for Helicobacter pylori is recommended before acid suppression therapy. All patients should be advised to limit foods associated with increased symptoms of dyspepsia. January 15, 2020\n\nManagement of Hypertriglyceridemia: Common Questions and Answers\n\nRobert C. Oh, Evan T. Trivette, and Katie L. Westerfield\n\nHypertriglyceridemia is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and severely elevated triglyceride levels increase the risk of pancreatitis. Common risk factors for hypertriglyceridemia include obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Management starts with lifestyle modifications such as diet and exercise. Statins can be considered for patients with high triglyceride levels who have borderline or intermediate 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Icosapent can be added in patients at high cardiovascular risk if triglyceride levels remain high despite statin use. Fibrates, omega-3 fatty acids, or niacin may be considered in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia to reduce the risk of pancreatitis. September 15, 2020\n\nNeck Pain: Initial Evaluation and Management\n\nMarc A. Childress and Samantha Jayne Stuek\n\nThe broad differential diagnosis for neck pain requires an efficient but global assessment. Emphasis is typically placed on red flags that can assist in the early recognition and treatment of more concerning diagnoses, such as traumatic injuries, infection, malignancy, vascular emergencies, and other inflammatory conditions. August 1, 2020\n\nAtopic Dermatitis: Diagnosis and Treatment\n\nWinfred Frazier and Namita Bhardwaj\n\nAtopic dermatitis is a chronic relapsing and remitting inflammatory skin disease that causes intensely pruritic skin lesions. Maintenance therapy consists of liberal use of emollients and daily bathing with soap-free cleansers. Use of topical corticosteroids is the first-line treatment for flare-ups, with or without the addition of a calcineurin inhibitor. Ultraviolet phototherapy is a safe and effective second-line treatment for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. March 15, 2020\n\nUrinary Tract Infections in Young Children and Infants: Common Questions and Answers\n\nBrian Veauthier and Michael V. Miller\n\nThe decision to test for urinary tract infection should be based on risk factors and the child’s age. Urinalysis can help rule out infection and inform decisions about when to start antibiotics. However, urine culture is needed for definitive diagnosis. Antibiotic selection should be based on local sensitivity patterns and adjusted once culture results are available. September 1, 2020\n\nTickborne Diseases: Diagnosis and Management\n\nEmma J. Pace and Matthew O'Reilly\n\nThe incidence of tickborne disease is increasing in the United States. Patients presenting with flulike symptoms during the spring and summer months should be evaluated for a tickborne disease. Treatment based on experience and observation is recommended for tickborne diseases that fit the clinical presentation and geographic distribution of the disease. Early treatment with doxycycline has been shown to improve morbidity and mortality. Prophylactic treatment after tick exposure in patients without symptoms is generally not recommended. May 1, 2020\n\nManagement of Fever in Infants and Young Children\n\nJennifer L. Hamilton, Susanna G. Evans, and Munish Bakshi\n\nFebrile illness in children younger than 36 months is a concern with potentially serious consequences. Factors include poor arousability and increased respiratory effort. Urinary tract infections are the most common serious bacterial infections in these children. Antibiotic choice should reflect local patterns of microbial resistance. June 15, 2020\n\nShort-Term Systemic Corticosteroids: Appropriate Use in Primary Care\n\nEvan L. Dvorin and Mark H. Ebell\n\nShort-term systemic corticosteroids are frequently prescribed for adults by primary care physicians; however, short courses of the steroids are associated with adverse effects, including hyperglycemia, elevated blood pressure, mood disturbance, sepsis, and fracture. There is evidence against corticosteroid use in patients with acute bronchitis, acute sinusitis, carpal tunnel, and allergic rhinitis and for its use in patients with Bell palsy and acute gout. There is insufficient evidence supporting its use for patients with pharyngitis, lumbar radiculopathy, and herpes zoster. January 15, 2020\n\nFrequent Headaches: Evaluation and Management\n\nAnne Walling\n\nRepeated headaches can induce central sensitization and transformation to chronic headaches that are intractable and difficult to treat. Learn which red flag features to watch for that could signal serious underlying pathology. April 1, 2020\n\nGout: Rapid Evidence Review\n\nKarl T. Clebak, Ashley Morrison, and Jason R. Croad\n\nRisk factors of gout include male sex; obesity; hypertension; alcohol intake; and a diet rich in meat, seafood, and fructose-rich food and beverages. Gout is characterized by swelling, pain, or tenderness in a peripheral joint or bursa. Diagnosis is made using several validated clinical prediction rules. Arthrocentesis should be performed when suspicion for an underlying septic joint is present; synovial fluid or tophus analysis should be performed if the diagnosis is uncertain. Colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and corticosteroids all relieve pain in acute episodes. Indications for chronic urate-lowering therapy include chronic kidney disease, two or more flares per year, urolithiasis, the presence of tophus, chronic gouty arthritis, and joint damage. November 1, 2020\n\nChronic Diarrhea in Adults: Evaluation and Differential Diagnosis\n\nKristina Burgers, Briana Lindberg, and Zachary J. Bevis\n\nCommon causes of chronic diarrhea include irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, and microscopic colitis. The differential diagnosis for chronic diarrhea is broad; however, a thorough history and physical examination can narrow the diagnostic evaluation. April 15, 2020\n\nBasal Cell and Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinomas: Diagnosis and Treatment\n\nJonathon M. Firnhaber\n\nKeratinocyte carcinoma is the most common skin cancer malignancy found in humans. It is comprised of basal cell carcinoma and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. The increasing incidence of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is primarily in older patients and is attributed to cumulative ultraviolet light exposure. September 15, 2020\n\nOutpatient Burn Care: Prevention and Treatment\n\nJason S. Lanham, Nicole K. Nelson, Bryan Hendren, and Teneisha S. Jordan\n\nFor all types of minor burn injuries, the goal of initial treatment is to minimize the extent of the burn, clean the wound, and address pain. The burn surface should be cooled with running tap water. Although superficial burns do not require dressings, advanced dressings should be used for partial-thickness burns to promote reepithelization and protect the wound. Patients with full-thickness burns should be immediately referred to a burn center. April 15, 2020\n\nPeripheral Neuropathy: Evaluation and Differential Diagnosis\n\nGregory Castelli, Krishna M. Desai, and Rebecca E. Cantone\n\nPeripheral neuropathy is one of the most common neurologic problems encountered by family physicians. Common identifiable causes include diabetes mellitus, nerve compression or injury, alcohol use, toxin exposure, hereditary diseases, and nutritional deficiencies, although many cases are idiopathic. Diagnosis requires a comprehensive history, physical examination, and judicious laboratory testing. December 15, 2020\n\nPoint-of-Care Ultrasonography\n\nMichael J. Arnold, Christopher E. Jonas, and Rachel E. Carter\n\nPoint-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) reduces cost, radiation exposure, and imaging delays, and increases patient satisfaction. POCUS is useful in resource-limited settings, and the use of POCUS in primary care is increasing. March 1, 2020\n\nSepsis: Diagnosis and Management\n\nRobert Gauer, Damon Forbes, and Nathan Boyer\n\nTo improve sepsis diagnosis, which can be challenging, clinicians must obtain historical, clinical, laboratory, and radiographic data supportive of infection and organ dysfunction. After initial airway and respiratory stabilization, the sepsis bundle should be initiated (fluid resuscitation, antibiotics, lactate measurement, and cultures) within three hours of presentation. Vasopressor therapy is needed if fluid resuscitation is ineffective. April 1, 2020\n\nChronic Musculoskeletal Pain: Nonpharmacologic, Noninvasive Treatments"
