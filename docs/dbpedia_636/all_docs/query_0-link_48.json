        "text": "Megan J. Peterson is the Executive Director of Gender Justice and Gender Justice Action and a seasoned leader in the gender equity and reproductive freedom movements. She was brought into Gender Justice by its founders in 2016 and in 2022 started the 501c4 sister organization, Gender Justice Action, to engage in political work. Under her leadership, Gender Justice has experienced significant growth and increased state, regional, and national impact. Previously, Megan was Deputy Director for the National Network of Abortion Funds (NNAF) where she expanded its network of grassroots abortion funds, led coalition campaigns to repeal the Hyde Amendment, and significantly increased its donor and foundation funding.\n\nPrior to her nine years with NNAF, Megan served as Director of Development and Communications for Pro-Choice Resources (now called Our Justice) in Minneapolis and as a patient advocate at Planned Parenthood in St. Paul. In college she worked with the National Organization for Women in Washington, DC, and the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund (now called Legal Momentum). Megan lives in the St. Paul part of Minneapolis (Longfellow) with her pre-teen son and two dogs.\n\nAs Deputy Director at Gender Justice, Tana provides critical leadership management, shapes organizational culture, and guides work management processes.\n\nFrom high-profile museums to start-up cooperatives, Tana has extensive experience in non-profit leadership, strategic planning, and project development. She has co-created a wide range of projects for creative and learning communities in New York, Boston, and Providence. After years working on the East Coast, Tana is back in her hometown of Minneapolis, creating art and action through public art-based policy engagement, and through the development of a network of artist-led worker cooperatives.\n\nTana is a collaborator in multiple Black-led and BIPOC-led movements. She is a member of the Black Liberation and Abolition Cohort, a group called together in the immediate aftermath of the murder of George Floyd by the Minneapolis Police Department. Tana is a member of the Subversive Sirens, a Minnesota-based synchronized swimming team committed to Black liberation, equity in swimming and the aquatic arts, radical body acceptance in athleticism, and queer visibility. She is a cohort member of Don’t You Feel It Too?, a public art action and form of movement meditation that transforms the self while taking action in the world.\n\nErin Maye Quade is known as someone who will run head-first into a challenge. She is a proven leader with extensive experience in the private, non-profit, and public sectors who believes in evidence based-solutions and in our collective ability to come together and solve problems.\n\nCurrently, Erin serves as a Minnesota State Senator and as a Special Projects Advisor at Gender Justice. During her run for Senate, Erin went into labor while giving a speech at the DFL caucus in April, sparking a national conversation on misogyny in politics. When she was elected in November 2022, she became one of the first three Black women to be elected to the Minnesota Senate. She is also the first out lesbian in the Minnesota Senate and the first Black mom in the State Senate. She was also the first LGBTQ person—and among the youngest—to be endorsed as the DFL candidate for Lt. Governor when she joined Erin Murphy’s ticket in 2018.\n\nIn just one term as a State Senator, Erin has successfully led initiatives to expand reproductive freedom, protect LGBTQ+ rights, safeguard election integrity, and promote literacy. In particular, Erin’s leadership on reproductive freedom inside and outside of the legislature has been critical to making Minnesota a national leader for abortion access. Erin built UnRestrict Minnesota, the biggest reproductive freedom coalition in the state, into a powerful force in state politics. Thanks to her leadership, the coalition won a court victory overturning most of Minnesota’s abortion restrictions, elected the state’s first-ever pro-reproductive freedom legislative majority, and passed historic legislation expanding and strengthening reproductive freedom throughout our state.\n\nAs a State Representative from 2017-2019, Erin wrote bills to increase funding for public schools and special education and quickly established herself as a candid and fierce advocate for Minnesotans championing paid family leave; expanding access to affordable child care; ending childhood hunger; eliminating gun violence; and investing in treatment for mental health and substance abuse issues. As a Democrat, she is proud to have successfully passed bills through a Republican controlled House.\n\nErin previously served as Advocacy Director for Gender Justice, working to advance gender equity through public education, legislative outreach, strategic partnerships and coalition-building. Through her work with Gender Justice and UnRestrict Minnesota, she led the largest reproductive health, rights, and justice coalition in the state of Minnesota from 2019 to 2022. In this role, she laid the groundwork for a statewide movement that successfully expanded access to abortion care in Minnesota in the year after Roe was overturned.\n\nIn 2018, Rep. Maye Quade founded the Childhood Hunger Caucus, a coalition of businesses, nonprofits and policymakers dedicated to ending childhood hunger in Minnesota.\n\nErin doesn’t back down from tough fights, even when others tell her to stand back. After legislation to prevent gun violence was blocked, Erin held a 24-hour sit-in on the House floor to protest inaction on the issue and shared stories of victims and survivors of gun violence.\n\nMonica Meyer has been leading organizing, activism, fundraising and policy advocacy on behalf of issues of equity and justice since 1992. Monica’s most recent job was working for LGBTQ liberation as the Executive Director of OutFront Minnesota. During Monica’s twenty years at OutFront Minnesota, she loved getting to work with thousands of justice-loving people fighting to make Minnesota more loving and equitable.\n\nDuring this time, OutFront was involved in securing some key victories advancing LGBTQ equity including helping to form and lead Minnesotans United for All Families, the campaign to defeat a constitutional amendment banning same-sex couples from the right to marry and secure marriage equality through the Minnesota legislature. They also worked to pass one of the country’s strongest anti-bullying laws, a policy to secure trans inclusion in sports, and elect pro-equality candidates up and down the ballot.\n\nSome of Monica’s recognition includes the Humphrey Institute’s Public Leadership Award, the Lynx’s Inspiring Women Award, HRC’s Brian Coyle Award, the Charlotte Striebel Award from MN NOW and the MN School Social Work Association’s Friend of Social Work Award.\n\nMonica received her master’s degree in public policy from the Humphrey Institute at the University of Minnesota, and her undergraduate degree from Hamline University. She lives in NE Minneapolis with her family and loves being close to so much great art and food.\n\nJess Braverman is the Legal Director at Gender Justice, where she ensures that our litigation strategy not only promotes the dignity of our clients, but also advances our mission of removing barriers to gender equity.\n\nJess came to Gender Justice from the Hennepin County Public Defender’s office. After representing hundreds of clients in felony matters in the Fourth District, she spearheaded the office’s Special Litigation Unit, where she focused on racial profiling in policing. Jess developed litigation that challenged racially discriminatory undercover marijuana sting operations, which ultimately led to the end of the sting operations and the dismissal of dozens of wrongful charges.\n\nJess attended NYU Law School, where she was an Arthur Garfield Hays Civil Liberties Fellow with a focus on LGBTQ rights. She has worked with organizations dedicated to LGBTQ and gender civil rights advocacy, access to health care, immigration advocacy and workers’ rights. After graduating, Jess worked at the Legal Aid Society’s Juvenile Rights Project, representing young people in delinquency and child protection cases in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nMinnesota Lawyer honored both Jess Braverman and Christy Hall as 2021 Attorneys of the Year, alongside our co-counsel ACLU of Minnesota and Stinson LLC, for our transformative victory in N.H. v. Anoka-Hennepin School District. In August of 2022, Jess was celebrated by the Minnesota Lynx for her work to both ensure trans women can participate in sports and litigation for abortion access. During their Women’s Health Night, they presented Jess with a signed basketball in recognition of her accomplishments. Jess has also earned the 2020 Equality & Justice Award from the Minnesota Lavender Bar Association.\n\nChristina Sambor is the North Dakota State Director at Gender Justice, where she is working to develop a strategic presence in North Dakota to promote gender equity and protect the rights of North Dakotans. Christina is a licensed attorney. Prior to joining Gender Justice, she owned and operated her own law firm, focusing on family law, employment law, civil rights, and legislative advocacy. Christina has lobbied at the North Dakota State Legislature since 2015, advocating for vulnerable youth, victims of trafficking and domestic violence, unhoused individuals and the LGBTQ+ community. Through her lobbying and work with non-profits, Christina led efforts to strengthen laws that protect vulnerable North Dakotans, secured millions of dollars in funding to support direct service programs, and most recently led the fight against the wave of anti-trans legislation introduced in the 2023 ND legislative session.\n\nChristina has her Juris Doctorate from Pepperdine University in Malibu, CA, where she graduated cum laude and was a member of the Dispute Resolution Journal. She has obtained certificates in executive education from Harvard Kennedy School and the Georgetown School for Continuing Studies. She obtained her Bachelor’s Degree in Political Science from the University of North Dakota, graduating Phi Beta Kappa.
