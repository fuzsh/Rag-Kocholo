Now there\n\nis a sequel; teenage-star Tatum O'Neal in\n\nher first leading film role is grown-up ¡\n\nVelvet's orphaned niece Sarah,who rides to\n\nfame and romance in the J\n\nfilm of the novel opening ^^^^HÉ^ m\n\nsoon in Australia. M\n\nHere, in one long jj M\n\nsection, a love story . . M $0*\n\n?flB: WI\n\nnone Help\n\nnone Help\n\nThe woman with the unexpected\n\nname of Velvet walked along the\n\nedge of the sea at ebb tide under a\n\nsky the texture of greaseproof paper.\n\nShe was forty or thereabouts, though\n\nthere were few revealing clues in her\n\nface. She took the telegram and\n\nre-read its impersonal message.\n\n\"Getting married,\" it said, \"lt's silver\n\nand gold. Wish me luck. Love. Sarah.\"\n\nEver since it had been delivered that\n\nmorning, Velvet had tried to read\n\nhappiness into it, but the words were\n\ncoded for her.\n\nShe left the beach and took the long\n\nroute back to the house. As she turned\n\nthe last corner, she saw the old horse\n\nwaiting for her in the paddock below the\n\nhouse. She took a wrinkled apple from\n\nher pocket and fed it to him.\n\n\"That's all you love me for now, isn't\n\nit?\" she said. Then memory moved in a\n\nflash of colour to a dav many years\n\nTo page 123\n\nnone Help\n\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE 121\n\nbefore. \"Did we ever win, Pie?\" she\n\nasked. \"Did we?\"\n\nShe walked on, through the slanted\n\ngate, into the walled garden. She could\n\nhear the sound of the typewriter before\n\nshe saw John's face on the other side of\n\nthe window.\n\nVelvet had long since resigned\n\nherself to the chaos of his study, lt was\n\nall in such contrast to the serious work\n\nhe produced: a full-length novel every\n\neighteen months.\n\n\"How's it going?\" she asked.\n\n\"Three pages I fondly imagined were\n\nNobel prize standard and which I now\n\nthink are rubbish. You're still upset\n\nabout Sarah's telegram, aren't you?\n\nLook, it doesn't say she's married. All it\n\nsays is 'getting married'.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't mind, I'm happy for her if\n\nshe's really set on this whatever-his\n\nname-is-\"\n\n\"Scott.\"\n\n\"But what I think is hurtful is that she\n\ndidn't take the trouble to ring us, she just\n\nsent a telegram, lt's as though we mean\n\nnothing to her - oh, it's different for you'.\n\nYou've got your writing, and - \" Her\n\nvoice broke and she went quickly from\n\nthe room.\n\nFacing her on a table in the hallway\n\nwas a photograph of Sarah as a child, as\n\nshe was all those years ago - a slightly\n\ntruculent face, unformed, vulnerable.\n\nI suppose, if I'm honest, we didn't\n\ncare for her overmuch at the start, she\n\nthought. No, that's not true. I loved her,\n\nbecause she was my dead brother's\n\nchild, but I didn't like her. In the\n\nbeginning, there wasn't much you could\n\nlike.\n\nn that first morning all those years\n\nago, Velvet had stood amongst\n\nthe crowd at Heathrow.\n\nFrom time to time, the crowd would\n\nshift, and chauffeurs would hold up\n\nname cards.\n\nVelvet fingered her own card, with the\n\nname Sarah Brown on it. The last time I\n\nsaw her she was only a baby. They were\n\njust leaving for the good, new life in\n\nArizona, she thought. And now - this!\n\nShe had a sudden vivid picture of that\n\nlast scene in the desert, Donald's car\n\nleaving the road and the bright splash\n\nagainst the Arizona landscape as it burst\n\ninto flames on impact.\n\nSarah's Aunt Velvet (Nanette Newman).\n\nEasing her way to the front of the\n\nbarrier, she saw a child in the exit\n\ndoorway of the Customs Hall, caught a\n\nglimpse of a strained, somewhat surly\n\nface.\n\n\"Sarah?\" Velvet called. \"Are you\n\nSarah?\" The child stood like an island in\n\nthe crowd, staring, just staring.\n\n\"Hello, darling, I'm so glad you're\n\ndown safely at last, lt's so lovely to see\n\nyou.\" Velvet put her arms round the\n\nchild and kissed her, but it was like\n\nkissing a statue.\n\nThey found the porter with the\n\nbaggage and made their way back to\n\nwhere John was waiting.\n\nDuring the long drive home, Velvet\n\nmade several attempts to coax the\n\nchild from her shell. \"Uncle John\n\nput up some posters and pictures. I think\n\nyou'll like your room,\" she said.\n\nSarah said, \"He's not my uncle.\n\nYou're not married.\"\n\n\"No, that's quite right,\" Velvet said\n\ncarefully. \"Well, you can just call him\n\nJohn if you like.\"\n\n\"Or Mr Seaton,\" John said. \"Which-\n\never you prefer.\"\n\nThe next few days were a nightmare.\n\nAny attempt to draw Sarah out proved\n\nexhaustingly abortive.\n\nArrangements had to be made for her\n\nschooling, and Velvet visited the local\n\nschool to prime the headmistress as to\n\nwhat to expect.\n\n\"I'm not going to that school,\" Sarah\n\nsaid, when Velvet went into her room\n\nthat first morning.\n\n\"Oh, you'll like it once you've got\n\nused to it and made some friends. Come\n\non, up you get.\"\n\n\"If you make me go to school, I'll run\n\naway,\" she said.\n\n\"That's just silly. Where would you\n\nrun to?\"\n\n\"Home.\" For the first time Sarah's\n\nface mirrored what she was feeling.\n\nTears ran down her cheeks, and Velvet\n\nwas unexpectedly touched.\n\n\"You're not going to run away,\n\ndarling. I won't let you, because I love\n\nyou and this is your home now.\"\n\nShe sat down on the side of the bed\n\nnone Help\n\nnone Help\n\nSarah, uprooted from her old life,\n\ndrags her way home from school.\n\nand Sarah leaned into her and gradually\n\nthe tears subsided. Velvet got her\n\ndressed in the school uniform, and they\n\nwent down to breakfast as though\n\nnothing had happened.\n\nAt the school, Sarah was the object of\n\nmuch curiosity from the local children.\n\nDuring the mid-morning break, Sarah\n\nwas singled out by a group of bullies, led\n\nby a boy called Alan Wilson.\n\n\"Hey,\" he said. \"We've got a present\n\nfor you. From America.\" He pushed a\n\nflat tobacco tin toward her, and removed\n\nthe lid to reveal what appeared to be a\n\nblood-stained, severed human finger.\n\nlt was an old schoolboy trick,\n\nachieved by making a hole in the bottom\n\nof the tin, through which the prankster\n\npushed his middle finger. Suitably\n\ndaubed with red ink and bedded on\n\ncotton wool, it produced a revolting and\n\nauthentic mutilation.\n\n\"Dead Gl's finger,\" Wilson said with\n\nrelish. \"All the way from Vietnam.\"\n\nSarah turned and ran, climbing the\n\nschool fence and disappearing across\n\nthe field on the other side.\n\nShe was not found until nightfall, a\n\ncounty-wide police search having been\n\nset in motion as soon as her absence\n\nhad been reported. She was picked up\n\non a main road attempting to hitchhike,\n\nhaving covered some ten miles across\n\ncountry.\n\nBreakfast next morning was strained.\n\n\"Are there some nice boys and girls\n\nin your class?\" John asked. Sarah shook\n\nher head. \"There must be ¿orne. Did\n\nthey talk to you yesterday?\" Again the\n\nshake of the head. \"No? Why was that?\"\n\n\"I didn't talk to them.\"\n\n\"Frightened, were you? That why you\n\nTo page 127\n\nnone Help\n\nynfemânonâf Ueloet\n\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE 123\n\nran away? Tell me. I might be able to\n\nhelp.\"\n\n\"He had a dead finger.\"\n\n\"A what? Who?\"\n\n\"This boy. He had a dead finger. In a\n\ntin.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose it was a real dead\n\nfinger,\" John said.\n\n\"Yes, it was.\"\n\n\"I expect it was just a joke,\" Velvet\n\nsoothed. \"They always play jokes the\n\nfirst day, but it's never so bad after that. I\n\nbet you come home tonight and say\n\nyou've got a friend.\"\n\n\"I don't want any friends.\" Sarah got\n\nup and ran from the table.\n\nIt was quiet in the house, yet some-\n\nthing woke Velvet. She sat up, a\n\npremonition of danger making her\n\nskin clammy. She padded up to Sarah's\n\ndoor. The room was empty. She rushed\n\nback to her own room, calling \"John!\n\nWake up! Sarah's gone again. You ring\n\nthe police, and I'll get the car out.\"\n\nWhen she got under way, her headlights\n\nbounced off mist, alternating with clear\n\nstretches.\n\nShe accelerated too quickly, coming\n\ninto a misted area dangerously fast and\n\nthe car left the road, careering onto the\n\ngrass verge. Breaking to a halt, she got\n\nout and walked down the road, calling\n\nSarah's name.\n\nThen she heard the sound of a horse\n\ngalloping. As she listened intently, trying\n\nto track the sound to its source, a\n\nsection of mist shifted and on a nearby\n\nhill she glimpsed the black outline of a\n\nhorse and rider.\n\nShe ran toward it, running up the\n\nhillside. When she could see the horse\n\nand rider plainly, relief fought with\n\nanger, the anger taking over as she\n\nrecognised the horse as The Pie. Sarah\n\nwas astride him, bareback, crouched\n\nlow, riding as once, long ago, she\n\nherself had ridden.\n\n\"Sarah!\" she screamed. \"Sarah!\"\n\nThe child saw her then and the old\n\nhorse, sensing the familiar, slowed\n\ndown. Velvet ran the last few yards and\n\ngrabbed the bridle. \"Get off!\"\n\nSarah slid from the horse.\n\n\"You stupid little idiot, what d'you\n\nthink you're doing?\"\n\n\"Riding.\"\n\nThe slap of Velvet's hand across her\n\ncheek was like a pistol shot, and the old\n\nhorse backed off.\n\n\"Don't you cheek me. You don't ever\n\nride my horse without my permission,\n\nyou understand?\"\n\n\"What's so special about him?\"\n\nSarah stood her ground, blinking away\n\nthe tears. \"Just because he won some\n\nold race a hundred years ago.\"\n\n\"Now you listen to me!\" Velvet took\n\nher by the shoulders. \"I've just about\n\nhad enough of you! I'm sorry for you,\n\nvery sorry, because I know you're\n\nunhappy and you don't want to be here,\n\nbut that doesn't give you the right to\n\nmake everybody else's life a misery -\"\n\nShe broke off as they heard the\n\napproaching police car bumping over\n\nthe grass at the bottom of the hill.\n\n\"That's because of you,\" Velvet said,\n\n\"and that's the second time ip forty\n\neight hours. The police have more to do\n\nthan looking for silly little girls. And if you\n\nkeep running away, they'll send you to a\n\nspecial school and then you'll really\n\nhave something to be unhappy about\n\n. . . What?\"\n\n\"I didn't run away this time.\"\n\n\"Well, how were we to know? You just\n\ndo as you're told from now on and learn\n\nto live with it.\" Velvet moved down the\n\nhill toward the police car. \"George, I'm\n\nsorry, lt was a mistake this time and I\n\npanicked.\"\n\nnone Help\n\nSarah and Arizona Pie - the magnificent bay colt that changes her life.\n\nWhen he had left, Velvet walked past\n\nthe motionless child to where the old\n\nhorse was grazing. She stroked his\n\nstrong neck, some of his calm passed to\n\nher, and she was honest enough to\n\nrecognise and acknowledge the true\n\nsource of her previous anger.\n\nI was jealous of her, she thought. She\n\nmade me think of things I thought I'd\n\nforgotten, made me think of the day I\n\nrode The Pie into history at Aintree.\n\nWe won the Grand National, he and I,\n\nand I was hardly older than Sarah. Now\n\nit's all behind me, it's over. But for her\n\nit's just beginning.\n\nThe next day Velvet decided on a\n\nchange of tactics. She went to meet\n\nSarah on her way home from school.\n\nThe child had taken the long way round,\n\ngoing down along the beach, and Velvet\n\nnoted that she was still alone, still\n\nwithout friends, trailing her school\n\nsatchel in the wet sand, a forlorn and\n\nvulnerable figure.\n\n\"I think old Pie rather enjoyed his\n\njaunt with you,\" Velvet said after a while.\n\n\"Where did you learn to ride?\"\n\n\"At home.\"\n\n\"Did you have a horse of your own?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"I'll let you in on a secret. Pie's going\n\nto relive a bit of his past in a few weeks'\n\ntime. A very special occasion, so I have\n\nto get him really well groomed and\n\nsmart. Would you like to help me?\"\n\n\"What's it for?\"\n\n\"Ah, that's the big secret. We'll share\n\nlooking after him. You see, the reason I\n\nwas so cross with you yesterday - I was\n\nscared. Well, you can't get scared if you\n\ndon't care about somebody, and I do\n\ncare about you. I need you, just like your\n\nMummy and Daddy needed you.\"\n\n\"They didn't,\" Sarah said abruptly.\n\n\"Oh, of course they did.\"\n\n\"They didn't. They didn't need any-\n\nbody else. I was always in the way, that's\n\nwhy they always left me.\"\n\n\"Left you? Oh, Sarah darling, I'm sure\n\nthat's not true.\"\n\n\"lt is. You didn't know them. He\n\nwasn't your father, he was just your\n\nbrother.\"\n\nShe walked quickly away.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, Velvet\n\nnever referred to Sarah's blurted state-\n\nment. She also concealed, despite\n\nquestioning from Sarah, the secret\n\nconcerning The Pie.\n\nThe annual International Show Jum-\n\nping Championships were to take place\n\nin London a week or so before Christ-\n\nmas, and the organizers had invited her\n\nTo page 129\n\nnone Help\n\nynfemâhbnâ/ Uebef\n\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE 127\n\nto be their special guest of honour to\n\nmark The Pie's retirement.\n\nOn the actual day, with the secret still\n\nintact, Velvet went on ahead with Pie in\n\nthe horsebox. Later, John drove up with\n\nSarah, and when they arrived at the\n\narena, they were shown into reserved\n\nseats in the front row.\n\nThe preliminary rounds completed,\n\nthe house lights were lowered and a\n\nsingle arc light picked out the Master of\n\nCeremonies in the centre of the arena.\n\nHe carried a hand microphone and his\n\nvoice was amplified through the loud-\n\nspeakers.\n\n\"My Lords, ladies and gentlemen.\n\nBefore the final events I have a very\n\nspecial ceremony to perform.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's a pity Aunty Velvet's going to\n\nmiss it all,\" Sarah said, and John\n\nrealized that she still didn't suspect.\n\n\"There are some of us present\n\ntonight,\" the voice boomed, \"who will\n\nremember the year when the Grand\n\nNational was won by a fourteen-year-old\n\ngirl . . .\"\n\nJohn watched Sarah closely, but the\n\npenny had still to drop.\n\n\"lt was cause for celebration,\" the\n\nMaster of Ceremonies continued, \"and\n\nalas, cause also for disappointment,\n\nbecause the young lady was disqualified\n\nunder the rules. But rules or no rules,\n\nshe and her equally remarkable horse\n\nThe Pie were first past the post on that\n\nmemorable occasion . . .\"\n\nSarah gave a shriek of excitement.\n\n\"lt's her, isn't it? lt's Velvet and The\n\nPie? That was the secret.\" John\n\nnodded \"That was it.\"\n\n\"Tonight we are going to pay tribute\n\nto Velvet Brown - 'National Velvet' as\n\nshe was immediately nicknamed - pay\n\ntribute to her and to the horse she rode,\n\nfor the time has come when The Pie is to\n\nbe retired from stud. My Lords, ladies\n\nand gentlemen, I ask you to show your\n\nappreciation as National Velvet leads\n\nThe Pie on a last lap of honour.\"\n\nArc lights swirled toward the tented\n\nentrance, picking out Velvet and The Pie\n\nas she led him into the arena. The old\n\nhorse was garlanded with flowers, his\n\nrug bearing the colours Velvet had worn\n\non the day of their triumph. His ears\n\ncame up as he sensed the occasion and\n\nhe walked proudly round the edge of the\n\narena, the applause building.\n\nSarah was still clapping when Velvet\n\nhad left the arena, and later, on their\n\nreturn journey home, the excitement still\n\nlingered.\n\n\"You did win really, didn't you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Velvet said. \"I suppose I did in\n\na way ... we did, that is. lt was all The\n\nPie, really.\"\n\n\"Will there ever be another horse like\n\nhim?\"\n\n\"There might. You never know, there\n\njust might be.\"\n\nAfter that night, life with Sarah\n\nbecame easier. She was no longer the\n\nsurly rebel. She settled down at school,\n\nthough still disinclined to make friends,\n\nand she drew closer to Velvet and John,\n\naccepting them as surrogate parents.\n\nHer great obsession was the old\n\nhorse, and she spent long hours with\n\nhim in his winter stable.\n\nThere was a bay mare in foal at a\n\nnearby farm, the last mare to be sired by\n\nThe Pie. The foaling was imminent and\n\nlate one cold, wet March night the\n\nfarmer telephoned.\n\n\"I reckon this is it,\" he told Velvet.\n\n\"So if you want to show your young lady\n\nwhat it's all about, you'd best come at\n\nonce.\"\n\nEnjoying the excitement, Sarah made\n\nno objection to being roused up in the\n\nmiddle of the night.\n\nnone Help\n\nChristopher Plummer plays Sarah's Uncle John who has to struggle to raise\n\nthe money so that Sarah can compete in the big international events.\n\nAlthough she had questioned Velvet\n\nabout the process of birth, nothing had\n\nprepared Sarah for the actual event.\n\n\"Nice little colt,\" the farmer said. \"A\n\npretty little bay colt.\"\n\nVelvet and Sarah stayed on to watch\n\nuntil the farmer felt it wise for them to\n\nwithdraw.\n\n\"Could you call a horse Arizona Pie?\"\n\nSarah asked.\n\n\"If you wanted to,\" Velvet replied.\n\n\"That's what I'd call him. I expect\n\nhe'd be very expensive, wouldn't he?\n\nEven if the man wanted to sell him.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, he would.\"\n\nEver since the birth of the foal there\n\nhad been only one topic of conversation\n\nwith Sarah. She visited the farm every\n\nspare moment she had.\n\nOn her return from school one\n\nafternoon she went to John's study.\n\n\"You busy?\" she asked.\n\n\"No, I wouldn't say so. As a matter of\n\nfact I'm suffering from Writers' Block.\"\n\n\"Oh! ls it painful? Can I get you an\n\naspirin?\"\n\n\"I don't somehow think an aspirin\n\nwould cure it. What've you been up to?\"\n\n1 Trothing much. I wondered . . .\n\n|VI Are there any jobs you'd like\n\nmm* X done? I'm trying to earn some\n\nextra pocket money, you see. Could I\n\nhelp you with your writer's thing, your\n\nblock?\"\n\n\"Go away and think of a story -\n\ncould you do that?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!\"\n\n\"Then write it down and bring it to\n\nme. How's that?\"\n\n\"Terrific. Thanks, Uncle John.\"\n\nFrom then on, she began writing.\n\nHer earnings were deposited in a tin\n\nbox and at last the day came when she\n\njudged she had saved enough. She ran\n\nall the way to the farm.\n\n\"I think I've got enough.\" She took\n\nthe lid off the tin and showed the\n\ncontents to the farmer. She could see he\n\nwas impressed. \"So I've come to buy the\n\nfoal, ls it enough?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'd say that's enough, yes.\" He\n\nhesitated, looking away. \"Or it would\n\nhave been, like. But he's been sold, you\n\nsee.\"\n\n\"Sold?\"\n\n\"Aye. Someone come and bought\n\nhim only yesterday.\"\n\nFor a moment, his face swam away\n\nfrom Sarah. \"But they can't!\"\n\nTo page 131\n\nnone Help\n\njniernatiorml Uebet\n\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE 129\n\n\"Yes, it's unfortunate, like. But I\n\ndidn't know you were so keen. I had to\n\ntake the first definite offer, you see.\"\n\n\"Well, thank you.\" She hurried away,\n\nand as soon as she was safely out of\n\nsight she allowed herself to cry.\n\nJohn was waiting for her as she\n\napproached the house. \"Velvet was\n\nlooking for you,\" he said. \"She's in the\n\ngarden, picking blackberries.\"\n\n\"Hello, darling,\" Velvet called. \"You\n\nseem depressed.\" Sarah didn't answer.\n\n\"Go and see old Pie. He'll cheer you\n\nup.\"\n\nSarah wandered off, but without\n\nenthusiasm. The Pie was too great a\n\nreminder of her own loss. There was a\n\nhorse on the skyline, but it seemed too\n\nsmall to be Pie. She stared hard.\n\nAlthough it definitely wasn't Pie, it\n\nseemed familiar.\n\nThen as she stared the horse raised\n\nits head, and suddenly the pain she had\n\nbeen carrying drained from her. lt was\n\nthe foal, her foal! She spun around to be\n\nconfronted by the sight of Velvet and\n\nJohn hugging each other in shared\n\ndelight.\n\n\"lt is, isn't it?\" she screamed. \"My\n\nfoal! You bought him, it was you all the\n\ntime.\"\n\nShe did not hear their reply, because\n\nshe was running, jumping the ditch, then\n\nover the barbed wire fence, and running\n\non up the hill. And the foal, hearing her\n\ncries, loped toward her, then broke into\n\na trot, ears up.\n\nThey met in the middle of the field like\n\nlovers. She flung her arms round his\n\nneck, pressing her face into him as his\n\nhead came round to nose her.\n\nThe foal was duly christened Arizona\n\nPie, his pedigree framed and placed\n\nin position of honour in Sarah's\n\nroom.\n\nShe had only one ambition, and she\n\npursued it unremittingly. Arizona had to\n\nbe the best horse in the world.\n\nShe had natural talent for riding, her\n\nonly fault - as Velvet was quick to see\n\n- being that supreme confidence of the\n\nyoung that cannot be challenged by the\n\nexperience of others.\n\nSarah and Arizona went from\n\nstrength to strength. Soon she was\n\nriding him at local gymkhanas, at small\n\nshows in the neighbourhood, then in\n\nSarah and Arizona Pie become a team.\n\njumping competitions farther afield.\n\nAs the years passed, her room\n\nbecame decorated with cups and roset-\n\ntes as she progressed from junior events\n\nto more demanding trials. She herself at\n\nsixteen was maturing into beauty, and\n\nJohn's pride in her equalled Velvet's.\n\nHe was seldom prepared to leave his\n\ndesk and go out into the open to witness\n\nher triumphs, but he agreed to accom-\n\npany her and Velvet to a competition\n\nwhich Sarah set great store by.\n\nA succession of young hopefuls\n\ncompleted the course. Then even as\n\nSarah and Arizona took the first fence,\n\nJohn could not help noticing that she\n\nrode differently from the others. She\n\nmade it all look effortless, keeping\n\nArizona going smoothly and easily, and\n\nthe young horse made light work of the\n\nbig fences.\n\nHe was preparing to applaud wildly at\n\nwhat he was sure was going to be a\n\nfaultless round when, to his horror and\n\namazement, at the last fence Arizona\n\nbrought down two poles.\n\nThey joined the crowd in front of the\n\njudges' tent to watch the presentation of\n\nthe awards, then went to the saddling\n\nenclosure to find Sarah.\n\n\"Well done, darling,\" Velvet said.\n\n\"Pity about that last fence.\"\n\n\"I so wanted to win today,\" Sarah\n\nsaid. \"So he'd notice me.\"\n\n\"Who?\" John said, with a glance at\n\nsome admiring youths hovering nearby.\n\n\"Captain Johnson.\" She indicated a\n\nmiddle-aged man standing with the\n\njudges. \"You know who he is, don't you?\n\nHe trains the British Olympic team. I wish\n\nI'd done better.\"\n\nThe following summer was the most\n\nsuccessful yet for Sarah and Arizona.\n\nThey had now graduated to the top\n\ncompetitions.\n\nComing home from school one day,\n\nSarah suddenly ran toward the house,\n\nnarrowly missing being run over by the\n\nnone Help\n\npost van. \"Anything for me?\" she\n\nshouted, as she entered the hallway.\n\n\"Yes, there is. You were obviously\n\nexpecting something.\" John held out an\n\nenvelope.\n\n\"You open it.\"\n\n\"Dear Miss Brown,\" he read aloud. \"I\n\nam writing on behalf of the Combined\n\nTraining Selection Committee to inquire\n\nif you and your horse Arizona Pie are\n\navailable to train as possibles for the\n\nBritish team that will compete at the\n\nLedyard Three-Day Event in America\n\nthis autumn.\n\n\"If you are able to accept this\n\ninvitation I would ask that you and your\n\nhorse arrive at the Windsor Training\n\nEstablishment on the twentieth of this\n\nmonth for further evaluation. Yours\n\nsincerely, J. R. Johnson.\"\n\nHe looked up from the letter. \"What's\n\nall this? What, may I ask, is Ledyard?\"\n\n\"lt's just about the most important\n\nThree-Day Event this side of the Olym-\n\npics, that's all.\"\n\nSarah went on the appointed day to\n\nthe Training Establishment in\n\nWindsor Great Park where the\n\nBritish Equestrian Team has traditionally\n\nfound a home.\n\nShe put Arizona through his paces in\n\nfront of the selection committee.\n\nThe trial lasted perhaps twenty\n\nminutes and after it Captain Johnson\n\nconferred with his colleagues.\n\nShe brought Arizona back to him and\n\nwaited for the verdict.\n\n\"Tell me,\" Johnson said, \"what made\n\nyou think you were good enough for\n\nus?\"\n\n\"I've won prizes,\" she said.\n\n\"Have you? What for?\"\n\n\"Riding.\"\n\n\"Well, we wouldn't exactly call it\n\nriding, would we? Staying on a horse,\n\nperhaps. And where did you learn what\n\nyou call riding?\"\n\n\"In Arizona.\"\n\n\"Well, that explains it. Of course, you\n\nrealize they don't admit cowboys to the\n\nOlympics. I will say one thing though.\"\n\nHe walked round Arizona, examining\n\nhim with a practised eye. \"You've\n\nsomehow managed to get yourself a\n\npromising horse.\n\n\"But it's your promise we're talking\n\nabout, isn't it? We have to go back to the\n\nbeginning, start from scratch. Are your\n\nparents rich?\"\n\n\"My parents are dead.\"\n\n\"Oh. Sorry about that. Who looks\n\nafter you then?\"\n\n\"My aunt.\"\n\n\"ls she well heeled?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Betterfind out, hadn't you? This isn't\n\na cheap sport. So you'd better go home\n\nand have a chat with your aunt, then ring\n\nme and tell me when you can start.\"\n\nTo page 134\n\n131\n\nnone Help\n\nSnkrnaiionalc Debet\n\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE 131\n\nFor a moment, she didn't dare speak,\n\nconvinced that she had misheard him.\n\n\"When - I can start?\" she finally\n\nmanaged.\n\n\"Yes, isn't that what I said?\"\n\nSarah flung her arms round Arizona's\n\nneck. \"Did you hear that? He's going to\n\ntake us!\"\n\nBack at home, they celebrated her\n\nnews over dinner. But then came the\n\nsober reckoning when Johnson's blunt\n\nwords about costs had to be faced.\n\nSince The Pie had been retired from\n\nstud, Velvet had very little independent\n\nincome, and the whole burden fell on\n\nJohn.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Sarah said to John as\n\nshe kissed him goodnight.\n\n\"What're you sorry about?\"\n\n\"Giving you all this worry.\"\n\n\"I'm not worried, I'm just bankrupt.\n\nOnly kidding. Go to bed and sleep well.\"\n\nBut when she had gone, he turned to\n\nVelvet, asking soberly, \"How much are\n\nwe talking about, do you think?\"\n\n\"Probably a few thousand by the time\n\nwe're through.\"\n\n\"Ah well, then I'll just have to think of\n\nsomething brilliant, won't I? You go to\n\nbed. I want to think.\"\n\nIn the following weeks he worked\n\nsolidly, answering Velvet's inquiries as\n\nto progress with good humour.\n\n\"What sort of book is this?\" she\n\nasked.\n\n\"Oh, different. A novel.\"\n\n\"I thought you'd had novels.\"\n\n\"Well, I had a good idea and thought\n\nI'd follow it through.\"\n\nHe went to London to have lunch with\n\nhis publisher, and later he remarked to\n\nVelvet, \"Sarah had better start pack-\n\ning.\"\n\n\"How terrific! Why didn't you tell me\n\nat once? You are the most extraordinary\n\ncharacter.\"\n\nThe real surprise was still to come.\n\nOne day Velvet glanced at a pile of\n\nmanuscript on John's desk, and the title\n\npage caught her eye: \"Lust Valley\" by\n\nJack Delavie.\n\n\"Jack Delavie?\" Velvet frowned. \"I\n\ndon't know any Jack Dela -\" She gave\n\na little cry. \"lt's you, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Do you like the style? You see, Jack\n\nDelavie doesn't have my artistic\n\nscruples. He's only in it for the money.\"\n\nWhatever preconceived notions\n\nSarah might have had about\n\nCaptain Johnson's establish-\n\nment were immediately shattered.\n\nShe found there were only eight in the\n\nclass, three other girls and four men.\n\nBeth, the senior of the girls, seemed an\n\nautomatic choice from the start. She had\n\nan international reputation and a great\n\nhorse. Roger, the team captain from the\n\nlast Olympics, was the oldest of the men.\n\nHe said little and kept himself to himself.\n\nThe other two girls and three men\n\nwere friendly enough, but behind the\n\nwelcoming smiles and the genuine\n\nadvice there was no mistaking the\n\nrivalry.\n\nIn her letters home, Sarah revealed\n\nlittle of her real feelings, and never\n\nmentioned her loneliness, her sense of\n\nbeing isolated, separate from the rest of\n\nthe group.\n\nAs training progressed they spent\n\nmore and more time in Windsor Great\n\nPark, moving from single jumps to\n\nsimulated cross-country courses. John-\n\nson never relaxed. He imposed his\n\nstandards rigidly.\n\nBut he could surprise them by\n\nsuddenly showing another side of his\n\ncharacter. After a particularly gruelling\n\nsession, when they had been closely\n\nobserved by other members of the\n\nSelection Committee, Johnson called\n\nthem together for what they imagined\n\nwas to be a sarcastic post-mortem.\n\n\"There's hope,\" he said. \"You\n\nweren't brilliant this morning, but you\n\nTo page 136\n\nnone Help\n\nMemdtonal Uelwl\n\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE 134\n\nweren't entirely appalling. And just to\n\nprove to you what a basically soft-\n\nhearted character I am, I'm cancelling\n\nclass tomorrow. So off you go. Except I\n\nwant a word with you, young lady.\"\n\nHe crooked a finger in Sarah's\n\ndirection, then waited until the others\n\nhad dispersed.\n\n\"Don't look so scared. Now, whatever\n\nelse, I'll never tell you anything but the\n\ntruth. So, let's start with the good news.\n\nYou've worked very hard and you've\n\nmade extraordinary progress. Before\n\nyou're through you'll ride well enough to\n\nmake anybody's team.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"But the thing that worries me about\n\nyou has nothing to do with riding. Do\n\nyou know what I'm talking about?\"\n\nSarah shook her head.\n\n\"lt has to do with your personality.\n\nYou're too preoccupied with yourself.\n\nNobody can play this game on a\n\nhooray-for-me-to-hell-with-you basis.\n\nYou need the team, they need you.\"\n\nSarah thought about what he had\n\nsaid on the journey home, weighing\n\nthe compliment against the criti-\n\ncism.\n\nVelvet wasn't in when she arrived,\n\nand she explained to John that Johnson\n\nhad given them a day off.\n\n\"His loss is our gain. How's it going?\"\n\n\"OK, I guess. Next week's the big\n\nthing. They make the selection then.\"\n\n\"You depressed about something?\"\n\nhe asked. \"You sound a bit down. Are\n\nyou?\"\n\n\"Yes and no . . . Can I ask you\n\nsomething?\"\n\n\"Of course you can. What's bother-\n\ning you?\"\n\n\"I don't understand what makes me\n\ntick. See, I know what I'm doing wrong,\n\nbut I can't seem to do anything about it.\"\n\n\"What are you doing wrong?\"\n\n\"I don't make friends. At first I never\n\nwanted friends. Arizona was enough.\n\nAnd now that I do, I don't know how to\n\ngo about it.\"\n\n\"Well now. . . How shall I put it? You\n\ncan't wake up one morning and say,\n\n'Today I'm going to make a couple of\n\nfriends.' lt's like falling in love in a way.\n\nSometimes it's there all the time and you\n\njust haven't seen it. Look, to tell you the\n\ntruth, I don't know. But I can tell you that\n\nit will happen.\"\n\nThe day of reckoning had arrived.\n\nThe eight riders were assembled in the\n\nindoor ring to hear Johnson's verdict.\n\nJohnson suddenly appeared in the\n\ndoorway and began talking at once.\n\n\"I'll make this as quick and painless\n\nas possible. So the team for Ledyard. lt\n\nwas a difficult decision because natural-\n\nly under my tutelage you're all brilliant.\n\nThe final selection is Beth . . . Howard\n\n. . . Mike . . . and Roger.\"\n\nHe paused then looked at Sarah.\n\n\"Sarah will be the reserve.\"\n\nlt was less than she had hoped for,\n\nbut more than she had feared. I wasn't\n\nrejected, she thought.\n\nThey left for America five days before\n\nthe Ledyard Event was due to start.\n\nAs the horses were loaded into the\n\ncargo jet, Sarah was amazed by the\n\nefficiency of it all and the way Arizona\n\nbehaved. He allowed himself to be led\n\ninto the special horsebox without any\n\nfuss, in contrast to Roger's horse, Gold\n\nDust, who required a great deal of\n\npersuading.\n\nThe boxes were fork-lifted to the\n\nheight of the cargo door and then rolled\n\ninto position inside the cabin. They\n\noccupied most of the cargo area, the\n\npassengers being seated to the rear of\n\nthe aircraft and attended by a single\n\nstewardess.\n\nIn addition to the five riders and\n\nJohnson, the official party included\n\nseveral grooms and the team vet, Tim.\n\nThe grooms occupied special compart-\n\nments in the horseboxes in order to\n\nreassure their charges. The horses\n\nthemselves wore protective headgear.\n\nOnce the seat belt sign had been\n\nswitched off, Johnson went forward to\n\nthe cockpit to speak to the aircraft\n\nCaptain. \"We going to have a smooth\n\ntrip?\" he asked.\n\n\"Should do. Could be some clear-air\n\nturbulence. Just a bit.\"\n\nBack in the passenger cabin, Tim had\n\nleft his seat to check that all the horses\n\nwere all right. Arizona seemed totally\n\nunconcerned in his alien surroundings\n\nand was eating happily. Only Roger's\n\nGold Dust seemed unduly restless. Tim\n\nhad given him a mild tranquillizer before\n\ntake-off, but it seemed to have had little\n\neffect.\n\n\"Just behave yourself, do you hear?\"\n\nRoger was saying, stroking the horse's\n\nneck with a soothing rhythm. \"You've\n\ngot a first-class ticket and they've served\n\nyour meal before mine.\"\n\nNo sooner had the team got their\n\ntrays than the plane gave a sudden\n\nlurch.\n\nIn the cockpit Johnson peered\n\nthrough the windscreen at the apparent-\n\nly calm sky ahead, \"ls that the clear-air\n\nstuff you mentioned?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" The Captain made an adjust-\n\nment to some controls.\n\nTo page 138\n\nnone Help\n\nJnlemdbnalL Lkbet\n\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE 137\n\nJohnson pulled open the cockpit\n\ndoor and stumbled to the rear. Some of\n\nthe grooms were looking anxious. Roger\n\nhad returned to Gold Dust, who was\n\nreacting very badly to the turbulence.\n\n\"I've never known him like this,\" he\n\nsaid as Johnson came alongside the\n\nbox.\n\n\"I'll get Tim,\" Johnson said, but the\n\nvet had anticipated him.\n\n\"I don't want to give him another shot\n\nso soon after the first,\" he said.\n\nBeth had moved next to Sarah.\n\n\"What happens if any of the horses\n\nget really frightened?\" Sarah asked.\n\n\"Oh, Tim'll take care of them,\" Beth\n\nsaid, concealing her own mounting\n\nanxiety. \"He's marvellous.\" As she\n\nspoke, the plane seemed to drop\n\nstraight down for several seconds, and\n\nSarah gripped her arm instinctively.\n\nThen Gold Dust kicked violently\n\nagainst the rear panel of his box. They\n\nheard one of the grooms shout, and\n\nHoward and Mike slipped their seat belts\n\nand slithered forward to investigate.\n\nlt all became a nightmare to Sarah.\n\nShe could see Roger, Tim, and Johnson\n\nstruggling with Gold Dust who was\n\nrearing in his stall. His protective\n\nheadgear - a layer of foam rubber - had\n\nworked loose, and as he reared, his\n\nhead thudded against the ceiling of the\n\nfuselage.\n\nAgain he kicked back and Sarah saw\n\nthe metal retaining bolts holding the\n\nlocking bars in position suddenly jump\n\nout. She screamed.\n\nTim struggled back to his seat to get\n\nhis case of instruments.\n\n\"You'll have to give him another\n\nshot,\" Johnson shouted.\n\n\"I know, but it's dicey,\" Tim said. \"If |\n\ngive him the shot he needs, there's the\n\nchance I'll kill him. But if it's not big\n\nenough, he'll kick the plane to pieces. I'll\n\ntry and judge it.\"\n\n\"I'll go forward and have another\n\nword with the Captain.\" Johnson went\n\nforward. Tim filled a hypodermic.\n\nHe got the needle into the horse, but\n\nbefore he could empty the syringe Gold\n\nDust reared violently, knocking him off\n\nbalance.\n\nNow the horse went mad, lashing\n\nhis hind legs against the rear of\n\nthe box, frenzy increasing his\n\nstrength. The metal locking bar flew\n\nacross the passenger compartment,\n\nnarrowly missing the terrified stew-\n\nardess.\n\nThe Captain returned with Johnson.\n\nGold Dust had shattered the rear of the\n\nbox, and although Roger and Tim still\n\nhad hold of him it was obvious that they\n\nwere losing the battle.\n\nAs with the Captain of a ship, the\n\nCaptain of an aircraft has the ultimate\n\ndecision in any emergency. A mad horse\n\nin a jet at thirty thousand feet is more\n\ndangerous than a hijacker.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" the Captain shouted\n\nabove the noise, \"but you'll have to\n\ndestroy that horse. And do it quickly\n\nbefore the rest of them go berserk. I'm\n\nsorry, but there it is.\" He left them.\n\nWhile Johnson and Roger struggled\n\ntogether, Tim reached into his case.\n\n\"What are they going to do?\" Sarah\n\ncried.\n\n\"Don't watch.\" Beth put her arms\n\nround the younger girl, \"lt's soon over,\n\nand it doesn't hurt.\"\n\nAs Tim raised the pistol, Roger held\n\non as tightly as he could, talking all the\n\ntime, talking for the last time, to the\n\nhorse he loved. Only at the final moment\n\ndid he turn his head away. Then Gold\n\nDust was suddenly silent and the halter\n\nrope went limp.\n\nRoger slumped against the side of the\n\ncabin and tears poured down his face,\n\nthe sort of tears grown men give way to\n\nwhen grief is absolute.\n\nlt was a sombre arrival at Boston\n\nairport. Word of the tragedy had been\n\nradioed ahead and there was a sympa-\n\nthetic gathering of riders from opposing\n\nteams to greet them. As the British team\n\ngot into the waiting cars, two members\n\n_To page 143_\n\nnone Help\n\n(JnfemaiHonai Veloet\n\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE 138\n\nof the American team came up to\n\nexpress their sympathy.\n\n\"Whose horse was it?\" one of them\n\nasked.\n\n\"Roger Peacock's,\" Beth said.\n\n\"Gold Dust? Gee, that's terrible.\n\nThat's always been my nightmare. Will\n\nyou tell him how sorry I am? I don't want\n\nto bother him myself, not right now.\"\n\nHe stared past Beth to Sarah, then\n\nstood back as Johnson gave the signal\n\nfor the cars to move off.\n\nThe Ledyard International Horse\n\nTrials are unique, being held on a\n\nprivate farm in South Hamilton,\n\nMassachusetts and attract horses and\n\nriders from most sporting nations.\n\nA welcoming dinner party had been\n\narranged for the visiting teams, but\n\nJohnson felt he could not accept.\n\nHe told his team. \"I don't want to\n\nmake any hasty decisions, but obviously\n\nfirst thing in the morning we must sort\n\nthings out. You girls OK?\"\n\nBeth and Sarah nodded.\n\n\"Good. I'll say goodnight then. Take\n\ncare of yourselves.\"\n\n\"Do you think I'll get to ride?\" Sarah\n\nasked, when she and Beth were alone in\n\ntheir room.\n\n\"No idea. We'll know soon enough.\"\n\n\"That boy who spoke to you at the\n\nairport . . .\"\n\n\"Scott Saunders, you mean?\"\n\n\"ls that Scott Saunders? He's the\n\nAmerican team captain.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's right.\"\n\n\"He's good, isn't he?\"\n\n\"He's very good.\" Beth switched off\n\nher light, but Sarah had never felt less\n\nlike sleep. She was consumed with the\n\nfeeling that her life was about to change.\n\nNext morning, Johnson's manner\n\nwas brusque again.\n\n\"There's no sense in dwelling on\n\nyesterday's tragedy,\" he said. \"Roger,\n\neverybody knows what you're feeling\n\nand of course we feel for you, but we've\n\ncome a long way and you've all worked\n\ntoo hard to let this destroy our chances.\n\nSo this is what I've decided. You'll ride\n\nMagic, Roger, but you'll go second\n\ninstead of last.\"\n\nRoger nodded. \"That makes sense.\"\n\n\"Sarah,\" Johnson continued, \"I'm\n\nentering you as an individual competitor.\n\nIt'll give you the feel of an international\n\ncompetition without the responsibility of\n\nworrying about the team. Yes, Mike?\"\n\n\"Tim thinks there's some doubt about\n\nMagic. I thought he'd told you.\"\n\n\"No . . . he's had no chance. I've\n\nbeen with the Committee since break-\n\nfast. Let's go and see.\"\n\nThey all went to the stables, to be\n\ngreeted by a gloomy Tim.\n\n\"Johnny, I'm sorry, but it's not good\n\nnews. He's slipped his stifle-joint. You\n\nsee for yourself, he can hardly bear to\n\nput any weight on it.\"\n\nJohnson bent and examined the\n\nhorse. \"Any chance at all?\"\n\n\"In three days? No way.\"\n\n\"What now, Johnny?\" Roger asked.\n\n\"You'll just have to ride Arizona,\"\n\nJohnson said. \"You've got three days to\n\nget used to him. Let's hope the jinx stops\n\nhere. Get on with it.\"\n\nSarah stepped forward as Johnson\n\nwas about to leave.\n\n\"Could I say something, please?\"\n\n\"If it's to the point, yes. If it's\n\npersonal, no.\"\n\n\"lt's just that nobody but me has ever\n\nridden Arizona. I don't know how he'd\n\ngo for someone else.\"\n\nJohnson stared through her. \"He's a\n\nteam horse and Roger is our most\n\nexperienced rider.\"\n\n\"So I don't get to ride at all?\"\n\n\"Exactly. Anything else?\"\n\nSarah shook her head. Johnson\n\nturned and left. Mike put an arm round\n\nSarah's shoulders, but she was beyond\n\ncomfort.\n\nA party had been arranged for that\n\nevening, an informal gathering to help\n\nrelax the competitors.\n\n\"Why don't you change your mind\n\nand come?\" Beth said to Sarah.\n\n\"No, thanks all the same. I know I'm\n\nbeing dreary, so don't take any notice.\n\nJust go and enjoy it.\"\n\nSarah sat on in her room, and after a\n\nwhile she wandered off to the\n\nstables. Arizona whickered softly at\n\nher approach, and she thought how\n\nsmart he looked in his new rug with the\n\nUnion Jack on it.\n\n\"Now just because I'm not going to\n\nbe with you,\" she said, \"I don't want any\n\nacting up. You just go out there with\n\nRoger and show them how brilliant you\n\nare.\"\n\n\"Why aren't you at the party?\" a voice\n\nsaid behind her, and she turned quickly.\n\nJohnson had come into the stables.\n\n\"No special reason. I just thought I'd\n\nlook in on Arizona.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose you liked the deci-\n\nsion I made overmuch.\"\n\n\"You did what you thought best.\"\n\n\"Best for the team . . . and best for\n\nyou too, though I don't expect you to\n\nbelieve that right now.\"\n\n\"No, I don't,\" Sarah said honestly.\n\n\"Oh, you ride Arizona better than\n\nRoger, no doubt about it. You'll always\n\nride him better than anyone else be\n\nnone Help\n\nSarah falls in love with Scott, the\n\ncaptain of the US Olympic team.\n\ncause he's your horse. But Roger's got\n\ntwo things going for him that you\n\nhaven't. Can you tell me what they are?\"\n\n\"Experience?\"\n\n\"Judgment, really. Knowing how fast\n\nyou can push a green horse over a\n\nstrange course and stili finish. But as\n\nwell, Roger has the ability to sacrifice his\n\nown vanity for the good of the team, and\n\nthat's saying a lot.\"\n\nSarah took this in, then some of her\n\nresentment surfaced again. \"I still don't\n\nget it. How can he help the team more if\n\nhe gets less out of Arizona than I\n\ncould?\"\n\n\"Because Roger will finish on him.\n\nMaybe not brilliantly, but he'll get round\n\nand we'll have a team score. You might\n\nget round faster, but then you might not\n\nget round at all.\"\n\n\"lt still seems pretty unfair.\"\n\n\"Well, it's a pretty unfair process all\n\nround, isn't it, growing up? Everybody\n\nthinks they know better than you. But\n\nyou will ride for me one day, dear Sarah,\n\nI promise you that. And you'll not only\n\nride for me, but the greater glory of the\n\nsport and the honour of the team.\"\n\nHe patted Arizona, then turned back\n\nto Sarah.\n\n\"You see, I used to be a bit like you, a\n\nbit of a grandstander, only nobody took\n\nthe trouble to tell me, as I'm trying to tell\n\nyou, that the sun didn't actually shine\n\nout of me. I wish they had, it might have\n\nsaved me a lot of bother. Well, lecture\n\nover.\" He held out his hand.\n\n\"Now, if you'd like to put on a party\n\nfrock, you can take me to the dance. I\n\nwon't be the youngest you'll dance with,\n\nTo page 144\n\nnone Help\n\njntemôttonùl Ueloet\n\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE 143\n\nbut I'll certainly be the safest. What\n\nd'you say, cowboy?\"\n\nSarah hesitated a second, then took\n\nhis hand.\n\nHaving got to the dance, she enjoyed\n\nit. There was a good band, and by the\n\ntime she and Johnson arrived everything\n\nwas swinging. Johnson too had a certain\n\nflamboyant confidence in his dancing.\n\nThen a young man wearing the Ameri-\n\ncan team blazer cut in.\n\n\"Come on, Johnny, you can't mono-\n\npolize the talent all night,\" he said, and\n\nSarah turned to find herself facing Scott\n\nSaunders.\n\n\"Make one false move with her,\"\n\nJohnson said, \"and you'll never ride\n\nagain.\"\n\n\"Well, that was easier than I expec-\n\nted,\" Scott said, as he and Sarah went\n\nout on to the floor. \"I'm Scott Saunders,\n\nand you're Sarah, the British secret\n\nweapon.\"\n\n\"So secret,\" Sarah said, \"I'm not\n\neven riding. Roger's got my horse.\"\n\n\"That isn't a British accent.\"\n\n\"No, it's Arizona.\"\n\n\"You defected, huh?\"\n\n\"I escaped,\" she said, smiling.\n\nThe weather wasn't kind to Ledyard.\n\nFor most of the three days it rained\n\nsolidly, turning the Dressage rings and\n\nthe cross-country course into a dan-\n\ngerous quagmire.\n\nRoger and Arizona didn't do well in\n\nthe Dressage, mostly because Arizona\n\nwas impatient with its disciplines. Beth\n\nand Howard and Mike fared better, but\n\nby the end of the first day the British\n\nteam was well down the list.\n\nIt rained spasmodically throughout\n\nthe second day when the\n\ncross-country was staged, and there\n\nwere many spills and a large number of\n\neliminations. Roger and Arizona com-\n\npleted the course without mishap. The\n\nother three also got round, and by the\n\nend of the second day the team had\n\nmoved up into fifth place.\n\nOn the last day conditions improved.\n\nThe sun shone but then the rain started\n\nagain. The American team improved the\n\nlead they held.\n\nThe British team ended up in third\n\nplace.\n\nSarah came away from Ledyard with\n\na greater respect for the dangers of the\n\nsport and enhanced understanding of\n\nwhat Johnson had tried to teach her.\n\nBack at home, Sarah at first was\n\nrestless and on edge, finding that she\n\nmissed the companionship and the\n\nchallenge of being with the team.\n\nShe threw herself into training, taking\n\nnote of the many tips Velvet gave her,\n\nand her dedication was rewarded. She\n\nand Arizona had a brilliant season.\n\nTipped then as being on the short list\n\nfor the British team for the next Olym-\n\npics, she awaited the postman's daily\n\nvisit with crossed fingers, and willed the\n\ntelephone to ring.\n\nThe call, when it came, was typical of\n\nJohnson. \"How's that horse of yours?\"\n\n\"He's fine. Never better.\"\n\n\"Just as well because he's been\n\npicked for the Olympics. And since we\n\nwant to take your horse, I suppose we'd\n\nbetter take you too. How does that\n\nsound?\"\n\n\"lt sounds fantastic!\"\n\n\"Good. Well, you'll get the official\n\nletter tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Has Beth been chosen too?\"\n\n\"Yes, the old gang in fact. Beth,\n\nRoger, Mike, Howard and you. Let's\n\nhope we have better luck than Ledyard.\"\n\nThey went back to the training\n\nnone Help\n\nSarah watches sadly as another\n\nteam member rides Arizona Pie.\n\nestablishment at Windsor for the final\n\nweeks before leaving, and Johnson's\n\ndemanding Ledyard programme was\n\nnothing compared to the Olympic\n\npreparations.\n\nThese Games were being held in a\n\nmid-European country behind the Iron\n\nCurtain.\n\nThe British equestrian contingent left\n\nHeathrow Airport in time to become\n\nacclimatized to the foreign location. All\n\nthe media were out in force and because\n\nat eighteen she was the youngest\n\ncompetitor, particular attention was paid\n\nto Sarah.\n\n\"How do you feel being the baby of\n\nthe team?\" a television interviewer\n\nasked her.\n\n\"Sort of not here,\" Sarah said.\n\n\"Of course, riding is in your blood,\n\nisn't it? Didn't I see your famous aunt\n\nhere?\"\n\n\"Yes, she's here.\"\n\n\"Sarah's aunt is Velvet Brown,\" the\n\ninterviewer explained. \"Well, you know\n\nwhat they called your aunt when she\n\nwon the Grand National. National Velvet.\n\nMaybe we should start calling you\n\nInternational Velvet?\"\n\n\"Bit early for that,\" Sarah said.\n\n\"Well, I'm sure all our viewers join me\n\nin wishing you and the rest of the British\n\nteam every success.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" Sarah escaped thank-\n\nfully and made her way back to where\n\nVelvet and John were waiting in the\n\ndeparture lounge. \"I wish you were\n\ncoming too.\"\n\n\"You don't wish it any more than us,\"\n\nVelvet said.\n\nBut the cost had been beyond them.\n\nShe and John had spent their last penny\n\non ensuring that Sarah had everything\n\nshe needed.\n\nFlags flew from Olympic village\n\nflagpoles, and the directional signs were\n\nwritten in a score of languages. Every-\n\nbody was very friendly.\n\nThe British team were plunged im-\n\nmediately into their final training sche-\n\ndule. Although the horses themselves\n\nnever see any of the jumps before the\n\nevent, the riders are allowed to walk the\n\ncourse and take stock of the problems\n\nthey have to face. Johnson led his team\n\nout the moment permission was given.\n\n\"Well,\" he said on their return,\n\n\"whatever the outcome, win or lose, the\n\nfact is you all made it here, and that's a\n\nprize in itself. You know I'm not given to\n\nsentimental outbursts, but I'm proud of\n\nyou all.\"\n\nHe seemed embarrassed by even\n\nthis muted compliment, as they all\n\nagreed when he left them. They\n\nknew that he had still to pick the final\n\nteam and whatever their secret hopes,\n\nthey all avoided the subject.\n\nThe afternoon before the opening of\n\nthe Games, Sarah was alone in the room\n\nshe and Beth shared in one of the\n\ndormitory buildings. She was studying\n\nthe book of rules yet again when Beth\n\ncame in.\n\n\"Johnson's announcing the team at\n\nsix o'clock, but he told me first, which\n\nwas nice of him.\" There was a strange\n\nTo page 146\n\nnone Help\n\n(3nfemâfionâ/c Velod\n\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE 145\n\nnote in Beth's voice, and Sarah waited.\n\n\"You're riding, I'm not.\"\n\nlt was a difficult moment. Sarah's\n\nnatural elation fought with sympathy.\n\n\"Oh, Beth, I'm sorry. Really. I'm not\n\njust saying it.\"\n\n\"Had to be somebody. You don't\n\nhave to feel badly. I'm not crying.\" Her\n\nface suddenly dissolved. \"Yes, I am, but\n\ndon't take any notice. Don't say anything\n\nnice. Just leave me.\"\n\nSarah went out quietly, but the\n\nmoment she was down in the com-\n\npound, she began running through the\n\ncrowds of athletes, not knowing or\n\ncaring where she was going, just\n\nrunning for sheer joy. And she ran\n\nstraight into the arms of Scott Saunders.\n\n\"Look who's here!\" he said. \"Miss\n\nBrown from Cave Creek. Or maybe\n\nshould I say Miss International Velvet\n\nBrown. Did you see the papers?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" Sarah grimaced. \"Nausea-\n\nting.\"\n\n\"I thought it was cute. Well, you look\n\nhappy.\"\n\n\"I am, I am! I got chosen. I'm riding\n\nthis time.\"\n\n\"Congratulations! Can I buy you a\n\ndrink to celebrate? Though of course\n\nyou realize I shouldn't fraternize with the\n\nenemy. But I guess this is a special\n\noccasion.\"\n\n\"Everything's special, everything's\n\nperfect!\"\n\n\"Careful! For all you know, I might\n\nspike your drink.\" He took her arm as\n\nthey threaded their way through the\n\ncrowd.\n\nIt rained all that night, so that\n\nconditions for the Dressage Test\n\nwere likely to be heavy.\n\n\"And Dressage isn't our strong\n\npoint,\" Roger said ruefully. They were all\n\nin the stable area helping the grooms\n\nmake last-minute touches, every horse\n\nlooking superb.\n\nSarah had been nominated to ride\n\nlast for the British team. She felt dwarfed\n\nas she urged Arizona into the Dressage\n\nrectangle and took him down the centre\n\nline to stop in front of the judges. There\n\nwere three of them, and she dipped her\n\nhead toward the principal one who\n\nacknowledged her salute with a bow.\n\nAs she took Arizona into the first\n\nTo page 149\n\nnone Help\n\n%kmâhbnâ/c Debet\n\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE 146\n\nmovement of the complicated test, she\n\nfelt his slight hesitation, and knew that\n\nher own tension was being communi-\n\ncated to him. She willed herself to\n\nconcentrate on the patterns and nothing\n\nelse.\n\nShe could hear the echo of John-\n\nson's voice, all those shouted instruc-\n\ntions from the past, and now in the\n\nuncanny silence of the actual thing she\n\nlonged for the sound of his sarcastic,\n\ncomforting voice.\n\nSit upright, she told herself, look\n\nahead, hands still. She criss-crossed the\n\nrectangle, going from one alphabet\n\nmarker to the other. Relax your hands,\n\n/ou're gripping too hard. They notice\n\nthat, they notice everything. Now turn\n\nhim, now! And Arizona responded,\n\nhimself more confident now.\n\nConcentrate, Sarah kept telling her-\n\nself, concentrate. She felt she had been\n\nDut there for hours. The faces of the\n\nspectators were a blur behind the banks\n\nDf specially planted flowers that surroun-\n\nded the area.\n\nThen it was all over. The uniformed\n\nDfficial saluted as she and Arizona made\n\ntheir exit. She was just conscious of the\n\nnext competitor going past her to take\n\nup his position, but she only realized\n\nlater that it had been Scott.\n\n\"Well done,\" Johnson said. \"I know\n\nwhat it's like out there and you managed\n\nvery well. Not textbook perhaps, but as\n\ngood as I could have hoped for.\"\n\nAt the end of the first day the British\n\nwere placed seventh.\n\nThey woke next morning to the day of\n\nthe cross-country speed and en-\n\ndurance test, the heart of the\n\nOlympic Equestrian Three-Day Event.\n\nlt is in four stages, the first being\n\nsome miles of roads and tracks, de-\n\nsigned to warm up horse and rider. Then\n\ncomes the steeplechase, followed by a\n\nsecond and longer stretch of roads and\n\ntracks, after which there is a ten-minute\n\nbreak. Finally comes the cross-country,\n\nthe fourth and most gruelling stage.\n\nA minimum weight must be carried,\n\nand there are set time limits to be\n\nobserved.\n\nUnder Johnson's instructions, the\n\nmembers of the team had walked the\n\ncourse twice. \"And don't ever forget\n\nyour horse is seeing it all for the first\n\ntime, so you've got to think for him.\"\n\nSarah had tried to mentally photo\n\ngraph the most difficult parts of the\n\ncourse. But when they had walked it,\n\nthey had had it to themselves. Now the\n\ncountryside was dotted with clusters of\n\nspectators. There were colours every-\n\nwhere, officials darting about, cam-\n\neramen, television crews, and the hum of\n\nexcited voices.\n\nThroughout the first roads and\n\ntracks, she concentrated on saving\n\nArizona unnecessary exertion, dividing\n\nher time between cantering and walking.\n\nLike most of the riders she wore two\n\nwatches, a normal one and a stop watch.\n\nJohnson's training and her own\n\npreparations paid off, and she arrived at\n\nthe start of the steeplechase course\n\nwithout having incurred any penalty.\n\nShe set off fast in the steeplechase,\n\nletting Arizona jump at speed,\n\nwithout checking his stride. Again\n\nall went well for her, both in that and the\n\nsecond roads and tracks.\n\nJohnson had instructed them all to try\n\nto arrive at the start of the cross-country\n\nwith a couple of minutes to spare, thus\n\ngiving themselves twelve minutes to rest\n\ninstead of the statutory ten.\n\nSarah came into the starting box at a\n\ntrot, slipped out of the saddle, and was\n\nimmediately surrounded by a posse of\n\nBritish grooms who unsaddled Arizona\n\nand started to sponge him down with\n\nwater.\n\n\"Timing's spot on,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"Don't get over-confident but I think\n\nyou've done remarkably so far. How's\n\nArizona behaving himself?\"\n\n\"Enjoying every minute,\" Sarah said,\n\nsipping the glucose drink she had been\n\nhanded. \"I think he hated the Dres-\n\nsage.\"\n\nArizona was being towelled down\n\nnow. Two of the grooms were greasing\n\nhis legs thickly from body to hoof,\n\neverybody working quietly and\n\nefficiently. Johnson glanced at his\n\nwatch. \"Four minutes,\" he said.\n\nThey completed their grooming, and\n\nsaddled Arizona again, lt was only as\n\nSarah moved him into the starting box\n\nthat Johnson told her the bad news.\n\n\"lt's not confirmed yet, but it seems\n\npretty certain that Roger has had to pull\n\nout. So remember our talk at Ledyard.\n\nRide to get round, ride for the team.\n\nGood luck.\"\n\nThen the starter signalled her to go,\n\nand she urged Arizona forward into a\n\nstrong, relentless canter.\n\nThere were many spectators fol-\n\nlowing her with special interest, for not\n\nonly was she the youngest rider in the\n\nGames, but she rode with a verve that\n\nsome of the others lacked. But she didn't\n\nhear the applause in her wake. All she\n\n? was conscious of was the steady,\n\nthudding rhythm of Arizona beneath her.\n\nThis marathon course contained\n\nsome thirty to forty really formidable\n\nobstacles . . . vertical fences, spread\n\nfences, ditches, banks, water jumps.\n\nArizona was jumping strongly at all\n\nthe early obstacles, but after the halfway\n\nmark, Sarah could sense that he was\n\nstarting to tire. She heard the echo of\n\nJohnson's words: \"Don't get too\n\nconfident.\"\n\nThey came out of trees into strong\n\nlight, the sun having just burst through a\n\nlarge bank of clouds. For a moment,\n\nSarah was blinded, and she took the\n\nnext obstacle badly.\n\nArizona lost his stride and was\n\nawkwardly positioned in the following\n\njump. Then she was urging him up a\n\nbank on the other side to a gigantic\n\nbrush fence, lt seemed to tower over\n\nthem, and Arizona faltered.\n\nSarah lost a stirrup, and as Arizona\n\nrefused, she was flung off, thudding into\n\nthe middle of the brush. She fell clear of\n\nthe horse, but on to her left shoulder,\n\nand was conscious of a searing pain\n\nwhich blotted out sky and grass.\n\nnone Help\n\nOfficials retrieved Arizona, who had\n\nrun to one side of the fence. Scarcely\n\nconscious of what she was doing, Sarah\n\ngot to her feet. She knew that the rules\n\nallowed her to accept help to remount,\n\nbut as she picked up the reins with her\n\nleft hand the pain returned.\n\nShe trotted Arizona back down the\n\nbank and repositioned him for the\n\nsecond attempt. She knew that she had\n\nincurred twenty penalty points for the\n\nrefusal and another sixty for the fall.\n\n\"Don't refuse again,\" she begged.\n\n\"Please don't refuse again.\" She urged\n\nhim up the slope, the brush fence\n\nloomed again - and then she was\n\nsailing over.\n\n\"Oh, you darling! You darling, you\n\ndid it!\" she shouted, and heard the\n\napplause from the crowd for the first\n\ntime.\n\nTo page 150\n\nnone Help\n\n^jniemalionalc Ueloet\n\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE 149\n\nThen the pain in her shoulder came\n\nback in great waves, but it seemed\n\nstrangely remote as though it were all\n\nhappening to someone else. As she\n\ncleared jump after jump, the impacts\n\njarring the injured shoulder, it was\n\nArizona who was in control. The scenery\n\nand the spectators rushed by like\n\nspeeded-up film.\n\nOnly four more to go, or was it five?\n\nShe had a moment of total panic,\n\nthinking she had taken a wrong turn.\n\nThen as though sensing her pain,\n\nArizona summoned a last reserve of\n\nstrength and took all the remaining leaps\n\nwithout breaking stride. And suddenly\n\nthere was the end in sight. Spectators\n\nwere massed all the way to the finish,\n\nand she put her head down, praying that\n\nshe would last.\n\nThey crossed the electronic finishing\n\nline, and somehow she pulled Arizona\n\nround and headed him for the unsad-\n\ndling enclosure. She knew she could\n\naccept no help until she had weighed in\n\nagain. She slipped from Arizona's back,\n\nvaguely conscious of Beth, Tim, and\n\nJohnson coming forward smiling.\n\nShe managed to get on to the scales\n\nand off again, the saddle cradled in her\n\ngood arm. Then she felt the saddle\n\nslipping from her grasp, and a rush of\n\ngreen came up to meet her.\n\nAn ambulance rushed Sarah to the\n\nspecially constructed Olympic hospital\n\nwhere the British team doctor diagnosed\n\na dislocated shoulder and mild concus-\n\nsion. The effort of riding on after the fall\n\nhad torn the muscles and although the\n\nshoulder was quickly put back into\n\nposition, she awoke to pain.\n\nJohnson and the doctor were confer-\n\nring at the end of the bed.\n\n\"How's Arizona?\" she whispered.\n\n\"He's fine,\" Johnson told her.\n\n\"How did we do?\"\n\n\"Not bad,\" Johnson said. \"In fact, it\n\nwas a remarkable piece of riding. Mike\n\nand Howard also had good rounds.\"\n\n\"And what about Roger?\"\n\n\"Roger had to withdraw. His horse\n\nslipped a tendon.\"\n\n\"Have we any chance still?\"\n\n\"Yes, the cross-country really\n\nshuffled the pack. We're now in second\n\nplace for the medal.\"\n\n\"Who's first?\"\n\n\"The Americans. The West Germans\n\nare a close third to us, and the Aust-\n\nralians only two points behind them.\"\n\n\"Well, that settles it, doesn't it?\"\n\nSarah said. \"I have to ride tomorrow, or\n\nthe team will be eliminated. I'll be all right\n\nthough.\"\n\n\"You'll be all right if the doctor says\n\nyou're all right. You're not allowed\n\npain-killers, you know.\"\n\n\"I haven't got any pain.\"\n\n\"Tell that to the marines. You forget I\n\ntook a few spills in my time, and I know\n\nwhat a dislocated shoulder feels like.\n\nAnyhow, Sarah, the doctor will make the\n\ndecision. Not you, not me.\"\n\n\"I don't have to stay here, do I?\"\n\n\"No,\" the doctor said. \"You can go\n\nback to the Village, but take It easy. I've\n\nstrapped you up and I want you to stay\n\nstrapped. Those muscles have taken a\n\nbeating.\"\n\nMike was waiting outside, and he\n\nhelped her back to the Village.\n\nAs with Johnson, she wanted to\n\nconvince him that she felt all right, but\n\nher legs seemed to lack strength, and\n\nher whole body ached. Thank goodness,\n\nshe thought, that Velvet wasn't there.\n\nBut the BBC television cameras had\n\nbeen on the spot when she fell, and the\n\nincident was given prominence in that\n\nnight's coverage of the event. Before the\n\ncommentator had finished, Velvet had\n\nphoned through.\n\n\"Sarah, are you all right? Did you\n\nbreak anything?\"\n\n\"No, I just pushed my shoulder\n\nabout.\"\n\n\"Well listen, darling, you mustn't ride\n\nif it's dangerous. Nothing's worth that.\"\n\nSarah reassured her. Then the rest of\n\ntheir conversation left Velvet rather\n\npuzzled for she sensed that Sarah had\n\nsomeone else in the room and was\n\nTo page 152\n\nnone Help\n\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE 150\n\nanxious to finish the call. She was right,\n\nexcept that Sarah wasn't in a room but\n\non the stairway of her dormitory block.\n\nThe person with her was Scott\n\nSaunders. He had been on his way to\n\ninquire about her when they met there.\n\n\"You should be resting,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm ali right. But it was nice of you to\n\ncome. You had a great ride today.\"\n\n\"I got lucky,\" he said. \"What I came\n\nto say was, win or lose, I'm taking you to\n\ndinner tomorrow, ls that a date?\"\n\n\"Yes, it's a date,\" she said, and he\n\nleaned in suddenly and kissed her.\n\n\"Get some rest. Goodnight.\"\n\n\"Goodnight.\" For the first time since\n\nthe accident, she felt no pain.\n\nThe doctor was gloomy when he\n\nexamined Sarah next morning.\n\n\"Johnny, I think it's very questionable\n\nwhether she should ride. The shoulder's\n\nback in place, but obviously it's very\n\ntender, and I doubt if she'll have more\n\nthan fifty percent use of that arm.\"\n\n\"I have to ride!\" Sarah insisted.\n\n\"Please! Anyhow, all that can happen is\n\nthat I have to pull out. Let me go in and\n\ntake the first jump. If it doesn't work,\n\nwe're no worse off.\"\n\nAn official ducked under the flap of\n\nthe British tent.\n\n\"Excuse me, Captain Johnson, but\n\nthere's only five minutes left before the\n\nlist is closed. Have you decided yet?\"\n\n\"Tell him!\" Sarah pleaded. Johnson\n\nstared at her, then turned.\n\n\"All three members of the British\n\nteam will be riding.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you!\" Sarah cried.\n\n\"Right!\" Johnson said. \"Howard and\n\nMike. Sarah is riding last anyway, so if\n\nyou both get clear rounds, she can go,\n\nbut if we haven't a chance by the time\n\nshe's called, I'll scratch her.\"\n\n\"Understood,\" both men said.\n\nJohnson looked hard at Sarah.\n\n\"Fair?\" She nodded.\n\nThis third and final day's section\n\ncomprised show-jumping, for which the\n\nfences were not so difficult, but riders\n\nhad to face the tensions of performing in\n\nthe arena. The leaders' scores were so\n\nclose that, as the BBC commentator\n\nsaid, it promised to be a real cliff-hanger.\n\nBack in England Velvet and John\n\nwere more on edge than anyone actually\n\npresent. The entire event was being\n\ntelevised live, and they had invited some\n\nof the local villagers to share what they\n\nhoped would be a great celebration.\n\nNews that Sarah had passed the\n\nfitness test had been given, and John\n\nhad champagne on ice.\n\nThe first rider, one of the\n\nthird-placing West German team,\n\ntook the early fences with style,\n\nmaking it look easier than it was, and so\n\nperhaps relaxed slightly. He undershot\n\nthe water jump, and ended up by\n\nsending the top of the brick wall flying.\n\nThat seemed to be the pattern for the\n\nnext seven riders. They all began well,\n\nthen a minor fault led to errors, so that\n\nno competitor had turned in a clear\n\nround by the time Howard entered the\n\narena on Flying Scot, the most ex-\n\nperienced horse in the British team.\n\nHe cleared fence after fence without\n\na mistake, and when he approached the\n\nfinal challenge, a big, difficult triple, the\n\nBBC commentator could barely conceal\n\nhis excitement.\n\n\"He's over the first . . . and the\n\nsecond . . . and, yes, he's done it! And\n\ninside the time limit! So that's a clear\n\nround for Howard Purcell of Great\n\nBritain on Flying Scot!\"\n\nMike, riding later, chalked up the\n\nsecond clear round for Great Britain,\n\nand left the arena to prolonged ap-\n\nplause.\n\n\"Well, the pressure's really on the\n\nAmericans now,\" the commentator said.\n\n\"Scott Saunders, the American team\n\ncaptain, can't afford any penalty\n\npoints.\"\n\nScott was jumping faultlessly, but the\n\neasing of tension evidently made him\n\nrelax concentration. He seemed un-\n\naware that he was taking the course too\n\nslowly, never turning tight between\n\njumps.\n\nTo page 155\n\nnone Help\n\ncJntemâtionâlc Velvel\n\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE 152\n\n\"I think he'll have time faults,\" the\n\ncommentator said, as he finished.\n\n\"Yes!\" he exclaimed, as the cameras\n\nswung over to a shot of the official\n\ntiming. \"He got time faults. Well, that\n\nwas certainly the last thing we expected\n\nfrom a rider of his experience, lt just\n\ngoes to show that nothing is certain in\n\nthe Olympics.\"\n\nJohn moved to the ice bucket where\n\nthe champagne was waiting.\n\n\"Don't touch it!\" cried Velvet, \"lt's\n\nbad luck.\" Then suddenly on the screen\n\nthere was Sarah on Arizona.\n\nThere were no microphones near her,\n\notherwise the world audience might\n\nhave heard her whisper in Arizona's ear,\n\n\"Don't just do it for me, do it for your\n\nfather. He won the Grand National,\n\nremember? And you've got to show\n\nhim.\"\n\nAs she listened for the signal to start\n\nher round, Sarah felt the tension\n\nL build within her. But from the\n\nmoment Arizona took the first jump, she\n\nknew that he had not been put off by the\n\nexperiences of the previous day.\n\nThe pain in her arm vanished. Ari-\n\nzona's stride was smooth and rhythmic.\n\nJumping in copybook fashion, he took\n\nthe water high and wide. They cleared\n\nthe seventh, eight, ninth. The atmos-\n\nphere was electric. Unless a last-minute\n\ntragedy occurred, it was obvious that\n\nhistory was about to be made.\n\nEven some of those who had most to\n\nlose were willing the diminutive figure on\n\nthe flying horse to win. They were aware\n\nof her injury, and that the gold medal\n\nwas within reach, just three fences away.\n\n\"Now there's just the triple, and she's\n\nwell ahead of the clock!\" The commen-\n\ntator's professional voice broke with\n\nemotion.\n\nArizona met the last challenge on a\n\nlengthening stride. He cleared the first,\n\nand was over the second. Then time\n\nseemed to hang still, for Sarah, for the\n\nspectators, for those at home. Again\n\nArizona jumped . . . and they were over,\n\nand through the finishing beam.\n\n\"She's done it!\" the commentator\n\nshouted, casting neutrality to the winds.\n\n\"Sarah Brown has done it for Great\n\nBritain! No jumping faults, no time faults.\n\nWe shall have the official announcement\n\nin a few seconds, but I can tell you that is\n\nthe gold medal, ladies and gentlemen.\"\n\nThe whole arena erupted as the\n\nplacings were confirmed and flashed on\n\nto the electronic scoreboard, showing\n\nGreat Britain first, with USA second, and\n\nAustralia third.\n\nAs Sarah came into the unsaddling\n\nenclosure, she was surrounded by the\n\nentire British contingent.\n\nBeth was crying, even the usually\n\nunemotional Roger was misty-eyed, his\n\nown disappointment forgotten. Mike and\n\nHoward converged on her in a united\n\nhug. There was Tim, the team doctor\n\nand all the grooms, their faces shining\n\nwith pride.\n\nSuddenly Sarah realized what it\n\nmeant to be part of a team, that nobody\n\ncould do it alone, and that the sharing\n\nwas more important than anything else.\n\nJohnson came through the crush, and\n\nshe kissed him impulsively and saw his\n\nface redden.\n\n\"You've got to go out there again,\n\nyou three, and receive your medal.\"\n\n\"Our medal,\" Sarah said to him.\n\nBack home, John had opened the\n\nchampagne, and they were toasting\n\nSarah, Arizona, the whole British team.\n\nThey watched the team take the place of\n\nhonour in the middle of the presentation\n\ndais, Sarah standing between Howard\n\nand Mike, and with the American and\n\nAustralian teams on either side.\n\nAs Sarah bent forward for the Presi-\n\ndent of the Games to place the medal\n\nround her neck, the pageantry of it all\n\nmade Velvet start crying.\n\n\"I can't believe Sarah's actually\n\nthere! That she did it,\" Velvet sobbed.\n\nThe flags of the victorious nations\n\nwere hoisted, and as the band played\n\n\"God Save The Queen,\" and she felt\n\nHoward and Mike straighten to attention\n\nbeside her, the enormity of the occasion\n\noverwhelmed Sarah.\n\nTo page 159\n\nnone Help\n\njnlemaltonal Uebet\n\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE 155\n\nShe swayed slightly and felt she was\n\ngoing to faint, then Mike's fingers\n\ntightened on her hand, and the moment\n\npassed.\n\nSarah turned, looking for Johnson.\n\nHe stood alone, close to the horses, and\n\nhe had taken off his hat for the Anthem\n\nand was still bare-headed. She willed\n\nhim to look in her direction and finally he\n\nraised his eyes.\n\nShe saw his mouth move but there\n\nwas no means of telling what he was\n\nsaying to her, for the noise of the\n\ncontinuing applause swamped all, but\n\nhe was smiling and she hoped she had at\n\nlast convinced him that in conquering\n\nshe had also fought well.\n\nlt was late afternoon and for the\n\nsecond time that day Velvet walked\n\nnone Help\n\nFresh from the Olympics, Sarah introduces Scott to Velvet and John.\n\nalone along the edge of the sea. Four\n\ndays had passed since the excitement of\n\nthe victory. . . days of anti-climax, then\n\npuzzlement turning to anxiety when no\n\nword came from Sarah, and then, since\n\nthe arrival of the telegram, hurt.\n\nLooking up, she saw John coming to\n\nher across the sands. \"This came for\n\nyou. Special delivery.\" He held out a\n\nsmall package.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Darling, how should I know? I\n\nhaven't opened it. lt's addressed to\n\nyou.\"\n\nVelvet opened the package and\n\nfound a flat jewellery box. Inside there\n\nwas a folded paper with her name on it.\n\nBut a sudden gust of wind blew this to\n\nthe sand as though on cue, and she saw\n\nthat the box contained an Olympic gold\n\nmedal.\n\nAs she stared at it, John retrieved the\n\npaper. \"Don't you want to read what\n\ncame with it?\"\n\n\"You read it to me.\"\n\nJohn unfolded the paper and read\n\naloud, \"I know there's more to winning\n\nthan the prizes - you taught me that.\n\nBut since you never got to keep yours,\n\nI'd like you to have this. Love always.\n\nSarah.\"\n\nVelvet was crying now. John put his\n\narms around her and gently turned her\n\nround. \"By the way,\" he said, \"it was\n\nhand-delivered.\"\n\nShe stared across the sands. Two\n\nfigures were coming toward them, a girl\n\nand a tall young man. The girl rested a\n\nhand on the young man's shoulder while\n\nshe removed her shoes, then she started\n\nto run barefooted across the beach.\n\n\"lt's Sarah! You knew, you knew all\n\nthe time!\" Velvet said. Sarah ran to her,\n\nand they embraced. Then Sarah turned\n\nand led the young man forward.\n\n\"Scott,\" she said, \"I'd like you to\n\nmeet my parents.\"\n\nThe young man held out his hand and\n\nVelvet took it, but she couldn't see his\n\nface clearly for the tears in her eyes, and\n\nshe was not crying for herself now. She\n\nwas crying for the agony of happiness,\n\nfor what Sarah had said, for something\n\nshe had never known before, rrry\n\nCopyright (C) by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc.
