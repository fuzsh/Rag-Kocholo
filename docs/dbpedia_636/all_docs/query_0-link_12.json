        "text": "Sir John Standing (born John Ronald Leon, 16 August 1934, London) is an English actor. He was the voice of Mr. Brown in Hanna-Barbera's series of Paddington Bear.\n\nBiography[]\n\nSir John Standing is one of England's most respected stage, film and television actors. From a distinguished acting dynasty which includes his great-grandfather Herbert Standing (1846–1923) and his grandfather Sir Guy Standing (1873–1937) and his mother, actress Kay Hammond. He succeeded his father, Sir Ronald Leon, as the fourth baronet in 1964.\n\nSir John has worked productively on both the London and New York stages over the decades with leading parts in The Importance of Being Earnest, Ring Around the Moon, A Sense of Detachment by John Osborne and, most notably, Noel Coward's Private Lives, with Maggie Smith. Lesser known for his film work, he has nevertheless supported and enhanced such cinematic offerings as Young and Willing (1962), his debut film; King Rat (1965); The Psychopath (1966); Walk Don't Run (1966); The Eagle Has Landed (1976); The Elephant Man (1980); Nightflyers (1987); Mrs. Dalloway (1997), and A Good Woman (2004).\n\nSir John's prestigious television roles have included the classic mini-series The First Churchills (1969), Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (1979), The Choir (1995) and King Solomon's Mines (2004). In the United States, he has graced numerous weekly programs, including L.A. Law (1986), Civil Wars (1991) and Murder, She Wrote (1984). He co-starred briefly with Robert Wagner and Samantha Smith in the action series Lime Street (1985), which ended abruptly with the young girl's death in a plane crash. The 13-year-old Smith became an instant celebrity after she wrote a touching and concerned letter to Yuri Andropov, then president of the Soviet Union, about the relations between the two dominant powers and was invited to meet him in Russia.\n\nSir John's second wife, actress Sarah Forbes, is the daughter of director Bryan Forbes and actress Nanette Newman.\n\n[]"
