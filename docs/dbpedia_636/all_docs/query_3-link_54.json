        "text": "SAN ANTONIO - Former San Antonio Spurs player Bryn Forbes is in hot water yet again.\n\nForbes was arrested Tuesday morning and charged with assault of a family member.\n\nPolice were called out to the WaterWalk at The Rim apartments on the Northwest Side Monday for a disturbance. According to police records, Forbes went to the apartment of the woman who is the mother of their children and banged on the window while she was sleeping. She says they have had an on and off relationship for the last 13 years. Authorities say when she opened the door, he hit and started to choke her.\n\nInvestigators say the woman was able to run away and get help.\n\nRELATED |\n\nForbes is being charged with Assault-Family Choking/Strangulation.\n\nThe 30-year-old point guard, who recently played for the Milwaukee Bucks, was previously arrested on a family violence charge in February of 2023 for allegedly assaulting his then-girlfriend. Those charges were later dismissed after he completed pre-trial diversion.\n\nForbes initially played for the San Antonio Spurs from 2016 to 2020, and again from 2021 to 2022. He re-signed with the Milwaukee Bucks in December.\n\nThe investigation on his current assault arrest is ongoing."
