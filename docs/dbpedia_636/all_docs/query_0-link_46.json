        "text": "Margaret Anadu is a Senior Partner at The Vistria Group where she heads Real Estate. She is based in New York City.\n\nMargaret has devoted her career to investing which not only generates strong economic returns, but importantly has a demonstrable positive impact on underserved individuals, families, and communities. Margaret is widely recognized as one of the foremost experts on equitable access to capital having invested over $10 billion across hundreds of transactions throughout the United States and was named one of the most influential figures in U.S. commercial real estate by Commercial Observer.\n\nMargaret has been a trusted advisor to many senior government officials at the federal, state, and local levels on utilizing private capital to create more equitable communities. As an experienced investor and thought leader on public-private partnerships, Margaret is often asked to share her views including on CNN, Bloomberg, CNBC and Yahoo Finance. She was named to 40 Under 40 lists by Fortune, Black Enterprise and Crain’s.\n\nPrior to joining Vistria, Margaret was a Partner at Goldman Sachs where she was the Global Head of Sustainability and Impact for Asset Management and Chair of the Urban Investment Group (GSUIG), the first impact investing platform at a major U.S. financial institution and Goldman Sachs’ primary impact investing business. Under her leadership, GSUIG’s portfolio was primarily comprised of real estate with a focus on workforce, affordable, and mixed-income housing, but also included investments in community facilities, educational space, industrial facilities, green infrastructure, student loans, and small businesses. Margaret ultimately grew the business to over $2 billion of investments annually.\n\nWhile at Goldman Sachs, Margaret was the chief architect of the One Million Black Women investment strategy, the Firm’s $10 billion capital commitment to narrow opportunity gaps for Black women in the United States and by extension their families and broader communities. In addition, during the COVID-19 pandemic, she led a $2 billion relief effort for small businesses.\n\nIn April 2022, Margaret was appointed chair of the board of directors of the New York City Economic Development Corporation. She also serves on the boards of the Low-Income Investment Fund, the Center for an Urban Future, Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, and the Africa Center.\n\nShena Ashley, PhD became the head of programs within the Community Impact and Investment team at Capital One and President of the Insights Center and the Capital One Foundation in May 2022. In this role, she is focusing on accelerating an innovative and equity-enhancing national philanthropic strategy that is based on and integrated with the highest quality of data and evidence.\n\nPrior to starting her leadership journey in philanthropy, Dr. Ashley launched the Office of Race and Equity Research at the Urban Institute to stand as a center of excellence toward empowering race and equity consciousness throughout the field of policy research. This followed the collaborative launch of the Racial Equity Analytics Lab (REAL), an effort that brought data science and structural racism colleagues together to create data tools and methods in response to the lack of racially disaggregated data at the start of the COVID pandemic.\n\nAn accomplished educator, consultant, and researcher, Dr. Ashley has been quoted as an expert thought leader on issues of philanthropy and charitable giving in several national media outlets including The Washington Post, NPR’s Marketplace, and The Chronicle of Philanthropy among others.\n\nAs a nonprofit and philanthropy scholar, Dr. Ashley had the great fortune to lead the Center on Nonprofits and Philanthropy from 2016-2022. In that work, she led teams of researchers and strategists to build a research-in-action portfolio focused on community investing, equitable grantmaking, democratizing charitable giving, and nonprofit and philanthropic policy. Her passion for democratizing data led her to transform the National Center on Charitable Statistics to an open-data repository, which now makes decades of nonprofit data freely accessible to the public.\n\nDr. Ashley holds a Ph.D. in Public Policy from Georgia Tech and Georgia State University, a MPP from the University of Michigan and a Bachelor’s degree from Tennessee State University, a HBCU in Nashville, TN.\n\nPer Scholas is led by President and CEO Plinio Ayala. Plinio was born and raised in the South Bronx, just as it grew into a national emblem for urban poverty and disinvestment.

Under Plinio’s leadership, Per Scholas launched a customized training business, making the successful case for employers to fully invest in training for a workforce they can hire, which today supports 25 percent of Per Scholas operations. After proving the model in New York, Per Scholas launched tech training in Columbus, Ohio, in 2012. Growth has been continuous over the past decade, and Per Scholas now offers tech training, professional development, and employer connections in more than 20 cities nationwide. The Per Scholas model has been evaluated twice in Randomized Control Trials, the gold standard of evaluation, that has proven the efficacy and impact of the model twice over. Despite exponential growth, Per Scholas maintains stellar results and outcomes and has supported more than 20,000 diverse adults launch careers in technology. With Plinio at the helm, Per Scholas is one of the largest and most effective national workforce development organizations in America, with continued ambitions and growth goals for the future. Plinio often says that he can imagine no greater satisfaction than seeing overlooked people—many of whom have struggled with educational and public systems that seem designed to stymie rather than uplift them—finally channel all their passion and curiosity into transformative careers.\n\nSteve Benjamin was elected Mayor of Columbia, South Carolina in April of 2010 with a vision of transforming South Carolina's capital city into a talented, educated & entrepreneurial city of the New South.
