        "text": "I‚Äôve just finished working with Kirsty, and what an honor it‚Äôs been. Kirsty‚Äôs manager contacted me a few months ago and asked me to support Kirsty following her ADHD diagnoses. ‚û°Ô∏è When Kirsty first came to me, she described herself as being in a ‚Äúchaotic crisis‚Äù. Following her diagnosis she was overwhelmed with emotions - frustration, anger, shame, and confusion. She felt lost and unsure of who she was anymore. During our sessions, we delved deep into these emotions and her experiences. Together, we worked to help Kirsty understand her diagnosis and rediscover who she had always been. We developed strategies that empowered her both in her career and personal life. ‚û°Ô∏è The transformation was remarkable. By our final session, Kirsty had become confident, capable, and compassionate towards herself. ‚û°Ô∏è Her performance soared, and the changes were noticed by her team, her manager, her children, and her husband. Kirsty's journey is just one example of the transformations I witness regularly. My coaching approach is designed to be easy and relevant, not a one-size-fits-all approach. Yes, I have thousands of strategies in my toolbox, but they work best when tailored to suit the individual and their work environment. If you, or someone on your team, are struggling with a neurodiversity diagnosis and want to thrive, I invite you to explore my coaching packages. Together, we'll identify blockers, develop effective strategies, and ensure you become the person you truly want to be. ‚û°Ô∏è Ready to find the strategies and transformation that Kirsty experienced? Let's get started. Book a call with me today, link above ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Let‚Äôs chat üí¨\n\nAt the BACP Making Connections event, I was asked to present on my experience integrating my coaching experience into my therapy practice. However, what many of my colleagues were interested in is how I integrate trauma informed therapy approaches into my coaching practice. In her fabulous podcast 'How's work', relationship expert Esther Perel talks of how we bring our \"emotional dowry\" with us into our place of work. For those of us who have experienced trauma, this is part of that. Trauma is not an event, or something that happens to us. It's our response to something adverse. Trauma impacts our entire nervous system which has both physiological and psychological consequences. This is why it comes up BOTH in my therapy AND coaching practice.

Ever think about your own sturdiness? Sturdy is defined as strongly or solidly built. How strong or solidly built are you? Perhaps there is a slightly alternative meaning here I'm putting forth. I am listening to this excellent Huberman Lab podcast with Dr. Becky Kennedy: https://lnkd.in/g4czUY3C. She defines \"sturdiness\" as: The ability to connect to oneself and someone else at the same time. And also: Being true to (one's) own values and needs, and can connect to someone else who probably has different wants and needs, and slightly different values at the same time. So now having further defined \"sturdy\" beyond the dictionary definition, how sturdy are you? Can you be true to yourself and your own needs while connecting to someone else who may or may not have the same needs at the same time successfully? With minimal conflict inside you? With compassion and love both for yourself and the other person? In many clients I meet, this is the basis for many relationship issues they face. They don't know who they are, or what they want or need. Or maybe they do know some of that, but do not hold true to them. Or they may not honor someone else's needs/wants in a way that is relationship building versus relationship detracting. Or they may know a lot, but don't know how to relate to another person in a way that fosters relationship versus taking away from it. So potentially a lot to work on! Certainly great topics for coaching in session. Back to the original question - exactly how sturdy are you? And if you're not the sturdiest person out there, what about you makes you not so sturdy? And if it's worth it to you, how might you improve your sturdiness in life, which will make your true self as well as your relationships shine? #coaching #lifecoaching\n\nLissy Abrahams is a relationship therapist with a treasure trove of experience. She is an individual and couples psychotherapist and founded the Sydney-based therapy clinic, Heath Group Practice. Lissy works with clients around the world, has held positions on several psychotherapy associations, and has published academically. Lissy is the author of Relationship Reset and has a successful online course Fight Less, Love More and another coming soon - Transforming Couple Relationships (aka It‚Äôs time to pull up your socks!). Lissy's work has touched numerous lives, and in our conversation, we delved into the power of a Relationship Reset. There is so much gold in this chat. One of the highlights of the conversation was Lissy's emphasis on understanding our mammalian system. We often live lives disconnected from our natural selves, filled with distress and : detatchment. She urges people to do the work needed to enjoy and be in harmony with our inherent nature, creating a ripple effect that benefits everyone around us. This episode serves as a testament to the profound impact of understanding relationship dynamics and ensuring we align with our true selves. If you've ever felt adrift in your relationship or need strategies to ground yourself amidst life's chaos, Lissy Abrahams is a voice worth listening to. #leadership #relationshipreset #mindset #empowerment #leadingyou #leadingyoupodcast\n\nI'm deep into this brilliant book as I'm reviewing it alongside fellow coaches for EMCC UK 'conversations with authors' event next month. Is there a place for exploring bereavement, grief, and loss in coaching? Absolutely there is. Since 2020 I've noticed more and more clients bringing themes of distress, pain, grief, and loss to their coaching space. And why wouldn't they? The world has been through a seismic shift. We face so much now as human beings. So many profound changes to process - in the world around us, the society we live in, and our own lives. If you are coming to a coaching space with me, please know you can bring it all. Reading this book reminds me of the gift that coaching space offers. I am also aware of the vital importance of a place of safety and sanctuary where we can feel and think and say exactly what we need to. Where do you find that listening space? #leadershipcoaching #coachingpsychology #timetothink"
