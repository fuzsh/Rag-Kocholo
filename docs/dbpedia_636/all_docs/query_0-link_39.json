        "text": "On Thursdays the Chronicle of Philanthropy is highlighting stories and guest opinion essays for #TheCommons, our new project exploring how America‚Äôs nonprofits and foundations are working to heal the nation‚Äôs divides and build community. With guest essays from leaders in the nonprofit and philanthropy sector, we are looking at how the country is splintered along political lines but also by income, race, geography, culture, and more ‚Äî division that can threaten progress and even the nation‚Äôs stability. Organizations nationwide are bringing communities together and getting things done. We‚Äôll look at potential solutions and examine how philanthropy can do more ‚Äî and how it can avoid creating or deepening fissures. We named our new project The Commons to reflect our goal: to create a home where people come together to learn, share ideas, and gain new perspective. We invite you to explore the essays and perspectives shared throughout The Commons and to join the conversation in our LinkedIn group is which is an extension of that mission. Explore the stories at: philanthropy.com/commons Join the conversation at: https://lnkd.in/gtRhpn-Y\n\nOn April 2, the Chronicle of Philanthropy launches The Commons, a major new project to explore how America‚Äôs nonprofits and foundations are working to heal the nation‚Äôs divides. We‚Äôll look at potential solutions and examine how philanthropy can do more ‚Äî and how it can avoid creating or deepening fissures. The Commons is taking on far more than polarization and red vs. blue discord. We‚Äôre exploring income, race, gender, geography, and other areas of life where division threatens progress. The Commons brings you the rigorous reporting and expansive range of opinions you can count on from the Chronicle. Plus, we‚Äôre offering resources and tools that can help you and your organization act. #TheCommons\n\nIn the wake of the civil unrest that swept through Los Angeles in 1992 and shook the city to its core, Black, Latinx, Asian, and white community organizers were rushing from one meeting to the next to discuss how to channel the rage about racist policing, income inequality, and neighborhood neglect that had precipitated the violence and turmoil. There was much talk about what should be done right away. But in one of the meetings, in the midst of a sense of urgency and rush of ideas for rapid responses, one activist leaned back and commented: ‚ÄúThere is an urgent need to think long-term.‚Äù Philanthropy would do well to follow a similar strategy ‚Äî combining impatience about injustice with patience about strategy and centering the voice of marginalized communities. Jennifer Ito, Manuel Pastor, and Ashley Thomas of the USC Equity Research Institute urge foundation leaders to look past short-term fixes and the issue du jour and invest in the long-term work of building community power. https://lnkd.in/gxA9FS6C This article is part of a series on building #PeoplePower, sponsored by The California Endowment, that features contributions from power builders, scholars, and funders who share lessons how to build the power of communities of color.

Here are a few ways to get involved! üìöKnowledge: learn what offices are up for election, what those offices do, and who the candidates are. ü™ßYard Sign: easy way to show support for a candidate you like and bring them to the attention of people in your area. üó£Ô∏èDiscuss: find ways to cordially discuss the upcoming election. Local races are especially great to talk about as they are generally less divisive and have a greater immediate impact. üíµDonate: campaigns are expensive and even small donations can make a huge difference, especially in lower budget local races. üôã‚ôÇÔ∏èVolunteer: candidates need help with all kinds of things from voter outreach, to fundraising, to policy research and so much more! Any help is sure to be appreciated by the candidate you support. üó≥Ô∏èVote: make your voice heard! Never underestimate the power of your vote, especially when it comes to local elections. üèòÔ∏èTurnout: help with get out the vote efforts! Community organizing can often be what makes the difference in a successful campaign.\n\nSome communities and populations lack the power to determine their own destinies because there are people and interest groups with power who want to keep things the way they are. That is why building community power is always about challenging those that hold power and the structures that support them. Co-governance requires that bureaucrats cede authority. Marginalized communities gain power over economic and social policy only when corporate influence is diminished and white supremacy is derailed. Power building is therefore a conflict-ridden process. There is no way around the reality that building power for social and racial justices means making enemies. For some in the philanthropic community, that is an unwelcome prospect. It may be even harder to accept that philanthropy‚Äôs own power must recede as its trust in community leaders grows. https://buff.ly/4599CgC"
