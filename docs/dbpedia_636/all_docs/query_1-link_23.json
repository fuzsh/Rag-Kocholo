        "text": "Film director Bryan Forbes has died \"following a long illness\" at the age of 86, a family spokesman has said.\n\nForbes' work included the original 1970s thriller Stepford Wives and Whistle Down The Wind.\n\nThe \"giant of cinema\" was married to British actress Nanette Newman and had two daughters, TV presenter Emma Forbes and journalist Sarah Standing.\n\nForbes died surrounded by his family at his home in Virginia Water, Surrey, family friend Matthew D'Ancona said.\n\nForbes was made a CBE in 2004 for services to the arts and to the National Youth Theatre of Great Britain.\n\nHe was awarded the Dilys Powell Award for outstanding contribution to cinema at the London Film Critics' Circle Awards in 2006.\n\nMr D'Ancona said: \"Bryan Forbes was a titan of cinema, known and loved by people around the world in the film and theatre industries, and known in other fields including politics.\n\n\"He is simply irreplaceable and it is wholly apt that he died surrounded by his family.\"\n\nThe actor and director Kenneth Branagh paid tribute to Forbes describing him as a \"superb British film-maker of astonishing range\".\n\n\"In life and art he was courageous, passionate and humane,\" he said.\n\n\"In his early days as a writer and director he was a pioneering and revolutionary artist. We have lost a great man of UK cinema.\"\n\nHe landed supporting parts in several notable British films including An Inspector Calls (1954) and The Colditz Story (1955) - but it was not long before screenwriting and directing lured him behind the camera.\n\nTogether with Richard Attenborough, he set up Beaver Films in 1959. Its first release, The Angry Silence (1960), was written by Forbes and featured Attenborough in the lead role.\n\nHis directing career began in 1961 with Whistle Down the Wind, featuring child star Hayley Mills.\n\nForbes directed many more films in the 1960s and early 1970s, including Seance on a Wet Afternoon (1964), The Wrong Box (1966) and The Raging Moon (1971), which starred Nanette Newman, whom he had married in 1955.\n\nIn 1969 he took over as head of production and managing director of EMI-MGM Elstree, and under his tenure the studio achieved notable successes with The Railway Children and Tales of Beatrix Potter.\n\nBut it was a torrid time for the company, beset by financial difficulties and staffing issues, and Forbes resigned in 1971.\n\nHe then directed The Stepford Wives, based on the novel by Ira Levin, in 1975 and International Velvet, starring Tatum O'Neal, in 1978.\n\nFilm critic Mark Kermode paid tribute to Forbes on Twitter, writing: \"Once had the fan-boyish pleasure of telling Bryan Forbes how much I loved Stepford Wives. He was charming and self-effacing. A great loss.\""
