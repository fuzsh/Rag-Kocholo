        "text": "Topline\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has chosen Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to serve as her running mate in the 2024 presidential race—as Harris tries to gain ground on former President Donald Trump with just over three months until the November election.\n\nKey Facts\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines. Text “Alerts” to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\nWhat To Watch For\n\nWalz and Harris will make their first joint appearance at 5:30 p.m. EDT on Tuesday in Philadelphia.\n\nChief Critics\n\nWalz has faced backlash from Minnesota Republicans largely over his actions to protect gender-affirming care—a topic that has become central on GOP tickets. John Helmberger, the CEO of Christian conservative group Minnesota Family Council, argued Walz’s executive order to protect gender-affirming care “victimizes vulnerable young people.” In the weeks leading up to the nomination announcement, Walz also sparked Republican outrage after he referred to “weird people on the other side,” and criticized Trump’s laugh and apparent obsession of Hannibal Lecter as “weird.” In response, former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy called the “weird” argument “dumb & juvenile,” while Donald Trump. Jr. responded to claims that Trump running mate JD Vance is “weird” with a video posted of Harris with a drag queen.\n\nWhat Has Trump Said About Walz?\n\nThe Trump campaign attacked Walz in a video after Harris announced him as her running mate, labeling him as a “left-wing extremist.” Trump’s campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt also slammed Walz, saying it’s “no surprise that San Francisco Liberal Kamala Harris wants West Coast wannabe Tim Walz as her running mate,” claiming Walz has tried to “reshape Minnesota in the image of the Golden State.”\n\nWho Has Supported Walz As Harris’ Running Mate?\n\nA group of Democratic lawmakers praised Harris’ choice of Walz on Tuesday, including contenders Shapiro and Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., as well as President Joe Biden, former President Barack Obama, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and the Congressional Black Caucus PAC.\n\nWill Walz’ Minnesota Connection Help Harris In November?\n\nPresidential candidates have a long history of strategically choosing running mates in swing states or candidates who appeal to certain voters in hopes of gaining ground in the presidential election. This November, Minnesota will be a critical swing state for Harris, one of seven key states Biden won in 2020 that polls have shown to be close matches in 2024, along with Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. A Fox News poll conducted late last month found Harris leading Trump in Minnesota by six points (52%-46%) in a head-to-head match—Harris leads Trump 47%-41% in the poll when including third-party candidates such as independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (7%). That lead marks a turnaround for the Democratic ticket in Minnesota: An Emerson College poll released one week before Biden’s disastrous debate performance found the incumbent tied 45%-45% with Trump (10% undecided). Harris trails behind Trump in the four other swing states (Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Wisconsin), according to recent polls, and the two are tied in Michigan and Pennsylvania, according to Fox News’ poll.\n\nTangent\n\nSince launching her campaign, Harris has landed major endorsements from Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. One of her biggest endorsements came last week from former President Barack Obama. Sources close to Obama had said the former president wanted to wait until after Biden’s Oval Office address last week to make the announcement, and wanted his public endorsement to stand on its own, NBC News reported. Another source told The New York Times Obama wanted to wait until Harris was officially named the party nominee, a process that could unfold as early as Aug. 1, following a rules change approved by the Democratic National Convention’s rules panel last week (party nominees are typically chosen by delegates at the Democratic National Convention after the conclusion of the primary cycle).\n\nKey Background\n\nEven before his disastrous performance in a June 27 debate against former President Donald Trump, Biden—the oldest president in U.S. history—had faced questions over his age, perhaps most prominently after the release of a Department of Justice special counsel report in February that found multiple cases of Biden’s memory failing. Those concerns ramped up substantially after CNN’s presidential debate, a 90-minute affair that resparked mounting concerns over Biden’s advanced age and potential cognitive decline. Facing calls from donors, lawmakers and pundits to step down, Biden ultimately announced on Sunday he would end his reelection bid, and quickly endorsed Harris for president. Harris became the presumptive nominee the next day after swiftly amassing the support of enough delegates to clinch the nomination.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nForbesTrump-Harris Swing State Polls: Harris Leads By 1 Point Overall In Battlegrounds, Latest Survey FindsForbesKamala Harris Narrows VP Shortlist To These 2 Picks"
