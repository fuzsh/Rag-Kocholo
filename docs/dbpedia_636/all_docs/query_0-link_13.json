        "text": "From an early partnership with ­Richard Attenborough through to work on some of the most famous films of the Seventies, including The Stepford Wives (starring his wife the actress Nanette Newman) and ­International Velvet, Forbes had a career that spanned decades.\n\nMore recently he also garnered some success as a novelist with his last work, The Soldier’s Story, ­published just last year.\n\nJohn Theobald Clark was born in Stratford, East London, (he was a lifelong West Ham United supporter) and knew he wanted to be an actor from childhood.\n\nHe obtained a place at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (Rada) but didn’t complete his studies.\n\nHe did, however, make his screen acting debut in 1948 and over the next 10 years went on to appear in a number of films now considered to be classics, including An Inspector Calls and The Colditz Story.\n\nUnder Equity rules he was forced to change his name to Bryan Forbes, there already being an actor called John Clark (who went on to marry Lynn Redgrave.)\n\nBy this time Forbes had realised that he would prefer a career behind the camera and at the age of 33 was praised for his screenplay of Basil Dearden’s The League Of Gentlemen. The following year he courted controversy with Guy Green’s The Angry Silence, starring Richard Attenborough, about a man who refuses to join an unofficial strike.\n\nIn 1961 he directed his first film, the acclaimed Whistle Down The Wind, produced by Richard Attenborough, about three children who hide a criminal, believing him to be Jesus Christ.\n\nMany successes followed, including Séance On A Wet Afternoon, which he wrote and directed, Of Human Bondage and, in Hollywood, King Rat.\n\n__BREAK1RIGHT__\n\nIn 1969 he was appointed to a senior post at the film studio Associated Britain (later EMI) and, during his two years in the post, was partly responsible for financing The Railway Children and The Go-Between. He returned to directing with The Raging Moon, starring Newman.\n\nMore films followed, most notably The Stepford Wives in 1975, The Slipper And The Rose and The Naked Face, as well as the screenplay for Chaplin, directed and produced by Richard Attenborough.\n\nForbes began to write novels and several volumes of autobiography, as well as contributing to The Spectator magazine and serving as president of the National Youth Theatre of Great Britain.\n\nIn 1965 he won the Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for Best Foreign Film Screenplay for Séance On A Wet Afternoon.\n\nForbes was awarded the CBE in 2004 and in 2006 received the Dilys Powell Award for outstanding contribution to cinema at the London Film Critics’ Circle Awards.\n\nHis friends included the late Queen Mother, along with numerous showbusiness luminaries, although a long-standing rumour that Roger Moore had been best man at his ­second wedding was not true.\n\nForbes was married twice, first to Irish actress Constance Smith from 1951 to 1955.\n\nIn 1955 he married his second wife Nanette Newman, with whom he had two daughters, the journalist Sarah Standing, married to actor, John Standing, and the TV presenter Emma Forbes. All survive him."
