Punk rock began in the mid-1970s as a reaction to the commercialism of mainstream rock. It started in the US, UK, and Australia with bands like the Ramones, Sex Pistols, and The Clash. Punk rock was raw, fast, and abrasive. It promoted independence, individualism, and anarchy while rejecting authority and the status quo. Early punks dressed in torn clothes with colorful hair to distinguish themselves and spread their anti-establishment messages through fast, aggressive music and lyrics criticizing society, war, and corruption. Though some punk values were betrayed by bands signing to major labels, punk music continues to evolve and influence alternative rock today.",
