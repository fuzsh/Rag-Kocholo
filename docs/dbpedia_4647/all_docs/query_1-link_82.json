        "text": "Daily paper NRC.Next (15/03/06):\n\n4/5 stars\n\n\"The course is wayward but still accessible\"\n\n\"Although the term indie (for: independent) tends to loose its meaning after the mega-success of indie-bands like Franz Ferdinand and Artic Monkeys, there are still bands around that want to take an independent stand. Guitarband Zoppo from Amsterdam follows its own course with music that is, within all its waywardness, surprisingly accessible.\n\nTheir fourth album \"Don't Trust Scarred Survivors\" follows along the lines of edgy guitarmusic of Joy Division, Sonic Youth, Pavement and Dutch examples as Mecano and The Ex.\n\nExceptional about Zoppo is that, despite the lo-fi-ish megaphone vocals and piercing guitars, they reach a level of emotional expressiveness that since the heydays of Radiohead as a guitarrockband hasn't been heard this strong.\n\nHere you won't find casual three-chord songs on fantreeguitars, but carefully fitting parts of two string-fetishists (Cees van Appeldoorn and Arjan Tuin), who take there whole collection of guitars to gigs and to the Next To Jaap Studio of their supergrooving bassplayer Corno Zwetsloot, because for every song they need a different tuning and soundcolours.\n\nBecause of that 'Don't Trust.....\" has a great variety in passionate songs full of compelling rhythms and an atmosphere pregnant of disaster.\"\n\nDutch magazine OOR (15/03/06):\n\n\"In a way we step in a timemachine direction towards the heydays of American cultbands as Seam, Sebadoh, Unwound and not least Polvo. So we also talk about intelligent noiserock, in a melancholic setting, wistful lyrics and guitarparts according to the Sonic Youth commandments: dissonant, crossing, layered, perfectly capable to create thick threatening clouds over the songs and give the drums an elbow to the side. It's not the dynamics that do the job, but the nice voice of Van Appeldoorn, the beautiful vocal-melodies and, point taken, the so prettily recorded guitars that one would swear recorder in charge/bassist Corno Zwetsloot has been on a study-tour to the cellars of Steve Albini.\"\n\n8weekly webzine (17/03/06):\n\n\"Layered dissonant perfection\"\n\n\"High time for a bit of new spirit. It was more than worth the waiting, because the beautiful album Dont Trust Scarred Survivors has got that fiery element without doubt. From layered-ness to discordance, from tension to that musical recalcitration: it's got everything.\n\nPeople, a fantastic record has been risen from Dutch soil.\n\nPolvo is one of Zoppo's examples, but Zoppo at the same token has the against-the-grain sound of bands like Unwound and Sonic Youth. It's eleven perfect songs that all have a different touch and are ingeniously crafted.\n\nThe eruptions are pretty, but utmost controlled. The band shows its might and owns the creation. Awesome.\"\n\nDutch webzine KindaMuzik (28/04/06):\n\n\"Zoppo has made a first class album. A level that could be of use for a lot of youngsters. Timeless quality music that deserves all attention, but probably won't get.\"\n\nLiveXS (28/04/06):\n\n\"Personaly I consider former album Les Aumonts one of the best, if not THE best Dutch album of the last five years. The melancholy and desolate atmosphere that shined from the edgy indierocksongs, combined with the intimite voice of singer Cees van Appeldoorn didn't bring Zoppo a broader audience, but gained them quite some respect in underground circles and with the press. As good and catchy as that this album is not, but nevertheless still beautiful it is. This album you spin at home when you're alone and want to lock yourself out from all the bullshit around. More words I don't need.\"\n\nVido Liber on the Subjectivisten website (15/03/06):\n\n\"Don't Trust Scarred Survivors\" is spinning overtime at Vido's home. The album grows and grows and grows....\"\n\nJan-Willem Broek on the Subjectivisten website (15/03/06):\n\n\"With every new cd of Zoppo the band shows a new unique sound, which results in for everyone a different classic. For one person the second \"Belgian Style Pop\", full of electronics, pop and postrock, will be the standard, others will appreciate highly the more noisy third \"Les Aumonts\".\n\nNo matter which Zoppo you love, the red thread is always that beautiful melancholy that wanders around in the songs.\n\nAfter five years they're back with \"Dont Trust Scarred Survivors\", an interpretation of a lyric line from the Polvo song \"Tragic Carpet Ride\". Whether you can trust these scarred survivors or not, you know for sure they always will be different.\n\nWith squeaking guitars they start the cd and rapidly they create a sound that would make Sonic Youth jealous. Quietness follows, but they strike with melancholic beauty. This way they vary with loud and soft songs over the total cd, keeping as always melancholy high up. Amongst other things this effect is strongend by Cees van Appeldoorn's beautiful voice that penetrates deep into your body.\n\nThe songs are compact, fresh and in your face. with that they combine the best of themselves with elements of Sonic Youth, New Wet Kojak, Pixies, Idaho and The Fall. Besides Cees van Appeldoorn also Arjan Tuin (guitar), Ineke Duivenvoorde (organ, samples), Corno Zwetsloot (bass, guitar) and Paul van der Maas (drums) are in the party. In one of the most beautiful songs \"Get Over Cute\" Asta Cat (ex-Zoppo, ex-Seesaw) can be heard as guestsinger.\n\nIt's a catchy rock album that creeps under your flesh. Five years after their latest cd they again show in a wayward way to be able to make music that does matter\".\n\nDutch E-zne Musicfrom (25/04/06):\n\n\"After three/four spinnings the oysters open and a chain of pearls is waiting. The fourth Zoppo turns out, especially when it comes down to the underlying groundness, a first class listening trip. So many exciting and beautiful things are happening at the base of the in itself already strong songs that one is not easily done with listening.\n\nWe applaud Zoppo, as stubborn in style and attitude as they are and still getting better all the time.\n\nWith this 5-some every longplayer is a new fresh adventure. Deep respect!\"\n\nUK Zine Vanity Project (25/04/06):\n\n\"4th LP from the Amsterdam quintet. It is a sharp, fizzing record of skuzzy alt.rock dynamite, the brazen, stubborn attitude of pre-Ok Computer Radiohead coming through. Too Cool To Care has a tunnel-pipe post-rock calm, dark splendour. Their music has the deep clouding feel of Joy Division but allied to a genuinely inventive new-form of lo-fi scuzz. Theres One At Every Party sways through the battering, whining guitar noise, while Wrong Way Round rolling on a melancholic but chiming melody. Were in Editors/Interpol territory with this, but done with a gritty panache. Skif\"\n\nSerbia and Montenegro radio programme THE POWER OF THE WITCHES (25/04/06):\n\n\"ESSENTIAL LISTENING FOR THIS WEEK> Zoppo DONT TRUST SCARRED SURVIVORS on Transformed Dreams\n\nI like shoegazing. And I hate Sonic Youth. I dont like shoegazing as much as I did. And I dont hate Sonic Youth as much as I did. Zoppo remind me of SYs late early career (thats Evol or Sister) with filtered approach of new semi-shoegazers like Radio Dept. I like when people are feeling sad and can transform the feeling into bursting guitars. Into a firework of bursting guitars. Zoppo are from Netherlands. Or Holland. Or Amsterdam. Itd be funny to be at their concerts holding a girls hand and feeling the bits and pieces of eternity being blown away. I like Zoppo cause its our childhood that bares all the autenticity of our lives. And its worth being sad about it when its gone. And they remind me about it. And thats why I like them. And I never said everythings alright with me.\""
