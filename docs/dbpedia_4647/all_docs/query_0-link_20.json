        "text": "Unlike Dr. Dre, that other faux-medical badass beatmaker, Dr. Luke is a white guy. He lives in Los Angeles now, but he talks like the New York City hustler he once was. He “vibes” well, an invaluable skill in the song-making trade, where the writer needs to connect with the artist as soon as she walks in the room. Dr. Luke is slight of build and dresses in T-shirts and beltless jeans that hang low on his backside, exposing colorful briefs. His blue-green eyes droop at the outer corners, giving his face at rest a melancholy cast.\n\nLukasz Gottwald—his given name—has co-written or co-produced more than thirty Top Ten singles since 2004, a run to rank with the greatest hitmakers in pop-music history: Phil Spector, the Beatles, Michael Jackson. At forty, he’s still going strong: last week’s No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, Miley Cyrus’s “Wrecking Ball,” and the previous No. 1, Katy Perry’s “Roar,” are both Dr. Luke songs. Many of his hits—like “Roar”—are written with Max Martin, Gottwald’s Swedish mentor and frequent collaborator. If Luke is the Skywalker of pop songcraft, Max is the Obi-Wan: the reclusive master.\n\n“Lukasz is just one of those brilliant people who comes along once every five years,” Doug Morris, the head of Sony Music, which finances Gottwald’s label, Kemosabe Records, said recently, citing Jimmy Iovine as another. Kemosabe has nine acts signed to it, including Kesha and Juicy J. Gottwald also serves as an exclusive in-house hitmaker to an array of superstar artists on Sony’s major labels: Epic, RCA Records, and Columbia. Kelly Clarkson, Pink, Miley Cyrus, and Britney Spears are in constant need of new material, and Gottwald works hard to keep these ladies supplied with song. He has a publishing company, Prescription Songs, to assist him. Founded in 2005, Prescription comprises more than forty songwriters and producers. Gottwald takes a percentage of their publishing revenues, offering, in return, advances and access to top-tier artists. As Prescription has grown, his operation has become more specialized. “You can’t have a team of forty quarterbacks, or forty defensive backs,” he told me in July, when I spent several days with him in California, adding, “And, by the way, I don’t know shit about sports. So it’s a combination of artists, producers, top-liners, beatmakers, melody people, vibe people, and just lyric people.” Vibe people “know how to make a song happen, understand energy, and where music is going, even if they can’t play a chord or sing a note.”\n\nThe collapse of the album business—album sales hit historic lows this summer—has made Gottwald, who can reliably produce hit after hit, a sort of golden goose. He can’t guarantee a hit—it’s a tricky matter of “the right artist with the right song at the right time,” he says. But a hitmaker who understands all the ways to make a song irresistible, in its creation and production and its promotion and sales, has distinct advantages. He can make a song that’s also a business plan.\n\nStill, it’s always a gamble. With “Wrecking Ball,” for example, Gottwald wasn’t sure it was a smash, and he wagered against it, telling Cyrus he would buy her a Numi toilet like his, the ultimate in potty technology (it has a Bluetooth receiver that can stream music from a smartphone), if he was wrong. Cyrus told me, “Contrary to what he thinks, Dr. Luke isn’t always right. I bet him that ‘Wrecking Ball’ would go to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and it did. Now he has to buy me a ten-thousand-dollar toilet. I’ll be thinking of him every time I go.”\n\nDr. Luke’s home, in the Hollywood Hills, was being renovated, so he was living and working at his beach house, which he bought from Ozzy Osbourne, the Black Sabbath front man and reality-TV star. His studio is upstairs, in a formal, wood-panelled room that used to be Ozzy’s library. He occasionally sits in an Aeron office chair, at an array of computers, but more often he paces barefoot across the floor, pausing now and then to stretch his arches, yoga style.\n\nCirkut, Gottwald’s latest protégé, works beside him in the studio, serving both as a collaborator and as a sort of musical scrivener. Cirkut takes down the rhythmic and melodic ideas that issue from Gottwald day and night (and sometimes well into the next day), and moves them “inside the box”—the computer. Gottwald will say, “Let’s redo the ‘right now’s, because they should be simple, but everything else should be ornate, like a lead. Do the ‘ooh-ooh’s first. Let’s get eight falsetto ones, then eight full-voice ones, and I don’t know if we’ll Auto-Tune all of them or just some.” Cirkut will get to work, fingers chattering lickety-split over the keyboard, translating Gottwald’s wishes into Pro Tools. The ideas are first rendered graphically, on the screen that Cirkut stares into—bits of sound represented as colorful Lego-like rectangles embedded among other colored sonic blocks. Then Cirkut hits playback with a flourish, and the two have a listen. Cirkut, whose real name is Henry Russell Walter, is a skinny twenty-seven-year-old beatmaker, d.j., and music nerd from Toronto who scratched and mixed his way to a Prescription Songs contract, and has become a producer in his own right. Cirkut has a place in L.A., but for now he mainly sleeps at the beach house, because he and Gottwald work so late. Tonight they’ll be at it till 4 A.M.\n\nGottwald does not work exclusively inside the box, as do many producers, especially in the hip-hop world; rather, he blends live instruments with prerecorded samples. He began his career in music as a guitarist—he was the lead guitar player in the “Saturday Night Live” band for ten years—and he can be heard riffing and shredding on many of the tracks he produces. There are half a dozen or so beat-up-looking electric and acoustic guitars propped up around the studio, on which he frequently noodles. The baroque swoop of sounds in his best songs, such as Flo Rida and Kesha’s “Right Round” and Katy Perry’s “I Kissed a Girl,” evoke the primal ecstasies of eighties hair-metal, but the music has been recontextualized within a dance-pop framework. The eighties are a frequent source of inspiration. “I think there’s a way to do classic songs and produce them electronically,” he told me, “and I feel like the eighties did a lot of that. If you listen to Tears for Fears, they had great melodies and less rigid cut-and-paste.” He added, “My problem with eighties songs is they take too long to get to the chorus.”\n\nGottwald composes songs slowly, sometimes over many months, as he and his collaborators tinker with different ideas. When I visited, he had seven or eight songs in various states of completion. “I’ve got Juicy J—he’s my rapper, he had the biggest urban record last year. We have two songs we have to finish for him. No, three songs. Plus a Justin Timberlake record with Juicy J on it coming in right now. We’ve got seven songs with Katy Perry”—for her new album, “Prism,” of which Dr. Luke and Max Martin are the executive producers. “Sometimes I don’t even like to look at the list, because it stresses me out.”\n\nAlong with Max Martin, Gottwald often shares co-writing credit with several of his Prescription writers. He functions more as an editor than as a writer—“the ear you want in the room,” as Bonnie McKee, who signed on with Prescription in 2010, puts it. His friend David Beal says, “He knows how to spot the good idea that suddenly bubbles up in a session and becomes the foundation of the song.” He drives his co-writers hard. “He works like he’s never had a song in his life,” Benny Blanco, who used to occupy Cirkut’s chair and is now a major hitmaker, says. “The guy is never tired—ever.”\n\nBecause of the vagaries of working with artists, Gottwald rarely schedules sessions more than a day ahead. “Their plans always change. An artist is sick. Or an artist was going to work this week, but she got a corporate gig in Saudi Arabia and the guy is going to pay her a million dollars. I mean, a zillion things. Their boyfriend broke up with them. They met a guy and they’re going away to Hawaii. So planning is sort of useless.” However, while Gottwald prefers to delay finishing projects for as long as possible, “because I might hear something I like over the weekend,” label executives need to plan records months in advance. Inevitably, telephone screaming ensues. Downstairs at the house, the air is alive with pings and trills and ringtones, as the e-mails and texts and calls arrive from various Sony labels and the artists signed to them, seeking the doctor’s medicine. But Dr. Luke, like pop music itself, tends to deal only in the here and now. “I don’t do time well,” he explained. “There are hard deadlines, and I’ve learned to recognize what those are, and I can tell the difference in the calls, by the amount of calls, and the tone of voice on the other end, that this really needs to be done now.”\n\nMaking music is by no means the only thing that Gottwald does in the studio. He constantly checks on sales, radio, and social-media impact. He pores over Mediabase, a widely relied-on industry database for tracking radio spins. He scours the ever expanding number of charts purporting to measure a song’s popularity, parsing such mysteries as how songs that trail in traditional measurements (sales and spins) can still come out on top of the Hot 100, based on YouTube streams, which Billboard began counting last year. “I’m a bit of a numbers junkie,” he told me.\n\nGottwald’s cell phone rang.\n\n“Hey, man,” he said. It was Katy Perry’s manager, Bradford Cobb. “What’s up? Talk to me.” They discussed the idea of getting Drake, the Canadian superstar whose pop-rap sound has an easy-like-Sunday-morning appeal, to write a rap for the bridge on one of Perry’s upcoming singles. Neither was sure he would do it, but they wanted to have the track ready so that if Drake were to come into the studio he could listen to it, and record something on the spot.\n\nHanging up, Gottwald instructed Cirkut how to prepare the track. Then, saying, “I will make sure this is what Katy wants,” he left the library to call Perry in private, closing the wood-panelled door softly behind him.\n\nIn 1982, when Lukasz Gottwald was nine, he was living with his bohemian father and mother, an architect and an interior designer, on West Thirtieth Street, in Manhattan. Welfare hotels and brothels dotted the neighborhood, and there were crackheads in the lobby. His parents listened to jazz, which Lukasz grew to despise. On Saturdays, his father took him down to the checkerboard stone tables that used to occupy the southwestern corner of Washington Square Park, where the young hustler would challenge adult players to rounds of speed chess. The pace of the games, many played in under two minutes, suited the boy’s O.C.D.-like concentration. The standard wager was five dollars, and Lukasz generally won.\n\nGrandmaster Flash and the Furious Five’s song “The Message” was playing everywhere in the city that year. The funky rhythmic effects and the range of strange electronic sounds, created on a reverb-drenched synthesizer, delighted him. He started playing drums, but his parents wouldn’t allow them in the house, so he picked up his older sister’s guitar. Soon he was practicing six hours a day. Allan Grigg, who met Gottwald in New York, and is now a Prescription songwriter and producer known as Kool Kojak (he co-wrote “Right Round”), told me, “Whether it was playing chess or learning guitar, Luke always had this almost inhuman focus.”\n\nWhen he was fourteen, Gottwald attended a camp run by the National Guitar Summer Workshop, held at a boarding school in Connecticut. Jarret Myer, a fellow-camper, told me, “Everyone was, like, ‘You got to meet this kid Luke. He shreds—he’s so amazing!’ ” Myer was particularly impressed that for his end-of-camp recital Gottwald considered playing a medley of Run-D.M.C. songs. This kid was fresh.\n\nMyer and another camper, Brian Brater, attended Horace Mann, the academically rigorous Bronx private school; both went on to Brown. Gottwald went to eight different schools, including St. Luke’s and the Little Red School House, in Greenwich Village. “We were from different worlds,” Myer told me. “I can recall Lukasz coming to our houses and seeing all this homework, and being blown away, like, ‘What is all this?’ And I remember going to his house and he had a duffelbag full of weed. And he was, like, ‘Yeah, I deal, this is how I make money.’ He was fifteen years old and he had it broken down into a science. And I was, like, ‘Wow! I do homework, you do this, but we’re friends.’ ”\n\nGottwald explains, “I started growing some weed in my closet. I got some fluorescent lights from my school, and I hung them on chains, in this room, with tinfoil. And every time I watered the plants it would smell like crazy. So one day my dad was, like, ‘Dude, you have to get rid of the plants.’ And it just so happened that Mother’s Day was three days later. And I knew a guy who dealt on Twenty-second and Eighth. He had a photography studio, but he was really a drug dealer. So I wrapped the weed plants in floral paper, with ribbons on them, and walked right down the street, because he said he’d look after them. A month later, the plants are dead, and he felt bad about it, so he gave me a garbage bag of weed and I could sell whatever I wanted.”\n\nHe did not invest the same kind of energy in school. “I never could make it to morning classes. I never felt like I needed to do it. I remember being in class, and saying, ‘I don’t care about this, I don’t need to know this.’ ” (To this day, he says, he has yet to finish a book.) He got in trouble for bringing an alphanumeric beeper to class, so that clients (who at one point included his mother) could page him. When he was seventeen, Gottwald recalled, a music teacher of his, the guitarist Adam Rogers, had a talk with him. “He said, ‘Dude, you got to get serious. If you want to be a real musician, you can’t do this.’ And I stopped. And from then on I made my money playing guitar.”\n\nAfter high school, Gottwald enrolled at the Manhattan School of Music. He decided to study jazz. “The thing that made Luke hilarious back then, apart from the pot smoking, was that he was completely arrogant,” David Baron, a producer friend from those days, remembers. “One night, we were out to dinner with a whole group of people, and Luke starts talking about jazz. He’s, like, ‘What is jazz? You learn a chord, you learn a scale, and you just move your fingers up and down the neck—that’s it, right?’ And everyone is, like, ‘Um, I think jazz may be more than that. Maybe you should listen to Miles Davis.’ ” But within a year he was good enough to get a weekly gig playing at Augie’s Jazz Bar, on 106th and Broadway.\n\nGottwald made his first real money writing commercial jingles. He did the music for a popular Nike ad that ran during the 1994 World Cup. He hated it. “I didn’t like the people who were deciding things,” he said.\n\nIn 1997, Lenny Pickett, the “Saturday Night Live” bandleader, put out the word around music schools that he was looking for a young guitar player for the band. It had to be someone who could sight-read music. As he explained to me, “We had only two hours for rehearsal, so I needed someone who could pick the music up quickly.”\n\nPickett, who is the tenor sax soloist in the band (before “S.N.L.,” he was a horn player in Tower of Power), auditioned about forty young players. “Lukasz walked in,” he told me, “and—he’s hilarious—the first thing he said to me was, ‘You can stop the auditions right now.’\n\n“I said, ‘What do you mean?’\n\n“He said, ‘Because I’m the guy.’\n\n“So I said, ‘Sit down and read this music!’ He was very sure of himself.” Lukasz was right: he was the guy. “I liked the way he played,” Pickett continued. “I thought he had a really good rhythmic feel, he played with a lot of confidence, and he had a pretty large bag of guitar-player tricks. And he looked good, which is important on TV. He was thin, with that angular face that looks good on camera.”\n\n“Lenny was the coolest boss ever,” Gottwald told me. “He mentored me. Protected me. I think I was fired five times.” Of his decade-long stint with the band, he said, “I played a bunch of styles—Philly Soul, Booker T., the Delfonics. I learned a repertoire. And I learned about how to be a boss. It was fun, and then for me it became not fun. There was something more for me to do.”\n\nLater that day, Dr. Luke and Cirkut were joined in the studio by Bonnie McKee, one of the Prescription wordsmiths. Dr. Luke doesn’t like to write lyrics—that’s also “not fun”—and so people like McKee and J. Kash, another Prescription lyricist, are in high demand. McKee co-wrote the lyrics to five of Katy Perry’s smashes, and she also collaborated on “Dynamite,” with Taio Cruz, and “Hold It Against Me,” with Britney Spears, both huge hits.\n\nGottwald greeted McKee warmly in the open-plan kitchen, which looks out at the ocean. A vast array of hot-sauce bottles took up part of the counter. There were children’s toys scattered around, including a nifty-looking car that kids can sit in and drive by twisting the steering wheel. He and his girlfriend, a yoga instructor, have two children under two and a half.\n\nGottwald was sipping a glass of the extremely powerful cold-pressed coffee that he keeps in a half-gallon glass jug in the fridge. “I have crazy coffee,” he said. “It’s cold and black. We travel an hour to get this coffee.” He added, “It’s all I have left,” in reference to the healthy California life style he pursues these days, his druggy New York days long behind him. “I can’t even smoke pot anymore. I get paranoid and start worrying about e-mails.”\n\nMcKee, now twenty-nine, arrived in Hollywood from Seattle when she was sixteen, with a record contract and a chance at pop stardom. The album, “Trouble,” released in 2004, didn’t pan out, and McKee was dropped by her label and spent years trying to support herself with songwriting, hoping to get another shot. She was selling clothes in a vintage store on Melrose when she met a fellow nineteen-year-old singer-songwriter, Katy Hudson, from Santa Barbara, who had recently changed her stage name to Katy Perry, and who was also broke. “No money,” Perry recalled to me recently. “Car repossessed, no cell phone, everything dead and gone. No hope, basically.” They became friends and fellow-partygoers, collecting experiences they would use years later in the lyrics for “Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.).” In 2007, Perry got big; McKee remained behind, “in the trenches of Hollywood,” writing and recording songs “in shithole studios behind Carl’s Jr. junior.” She got her break in 2010, when Dr. Luke signed her to Prescription and asked her to help Perry write the words to the song “Teenage Dream.”\n\nThanks to that song, McKee had a second chance at her own teen-age dream. In addition to her songwriting gig, she was signed as an artist by Dr. Luke and L.A. Reid, whose gleaming pate and stylish eyewear are familiar from the TV show “The X-Factor,” where he was a judge. A new album would be released on Kemosabe and Epic, the Sony label Reid heads. The first single was “American Girl”—an ode to American teen-hood that, had McKee recorded it when she was a teen, might have made her a star.\n\nThe track had appeared on YouTube only a day earlier. Once a song is ready for the world, Gottwald often favors this kind of low-profile introduction, eschewing hard release dates for “soft” launches, sometimes leaking songs on YouTube and hoping they go viral. “I just put all these things out there,” he says, “and if something catches we focus our efforts around that.” His basic strategy is to have no basic strategy. Given the state of disarray in the music business, that might be a good plan.\n\nPerry, Kesha, Taio Cruz, and Adam Lambert, among others, appear in the video—Dr. Luke called in a lot of favors—lip-synching to McKee’s voice, a clever inversion of the usual arrangement, in which she helps them with the words.\n\n“What’re your views at now?” Gottwald asked.\n\n“Like, two hundred thousand.” McKee checked again on her phone.\n\n“Did Katy tweet it?”\n\n“Yes, she tweeted it. Kesha hasn’t tweeted it yet, though.”\n\n“You know what?” Gottwald paused and glanced out the windows at the beach, where the shadows were growing longer. “It’s almost better if she doesn’t, and waits a couple days and does it.”\n\n“And you know Katy has thirty million and Kesha has, like—”\n\n“Three,” Gottwald said, and smiled somewhat sourly. He signed Kesha (whose full name is Kesha Rose Sebert) as both a writer and an artist in 2005, when she was eighteen, and helped establish her with the hits “Right Round” and “Tik Tok.” But now that her pop-star dreams had come true she was proving hard to control. Relations reportedly became strained last year during the making of her sophomore album, “Warrior,” which Kesha wanted to use to establish her rock bona fides; others involved in the making of the record felt that she should continue in the party-girl dance-pop vein of her début, “Cannibal.” She recorded “Die Young,” produced by Dr. Luke, Cirkut, and Benny Blanco, and released it as the first single, in the fall of 2012. The song topped some charts, but immediately after the December 14th Newtown massacre it all but disappeared from the radio, and the Kesha haters went into a frenzy on Twitter. While Kesha had previously claimed to have written the lyrics by herself, on December 18th she tweeted back, “I Understand. I did NOT want to sing those lyrics and I was FORCED to.” When I asked Gottwald what was up with Kesha (he is also an executive producer of her MTV reality show, “My Crazy Beautiful Life”), he shrugged and said, “I haven’t heard from her in a while.”\n\nIn writing lyrics, McKee adheres to the Swedish school of pop songwriting championed by Max Martin. Words are chiefly there to serve the melody. “It’s very mathematical,” McKee explained. “A line has to have a certain number of syllables, and the next line has to be its mirror image.” I asked for an example, and she sang, “California girls, we’re unforgettable, Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top,” then said, “If you add one syllable, or take it away, it’s a completely different melody to Max. I can write something I think is so clever, but if it doesn’t hit the ear right then Max doesn’t like it.” Don’t these strictures make the songs formulaic? McKee didn’t think so. “People like hearing songs that sound like something they’ve heard before, that’s reminiscent of their childhood, and of what their parents listened to,” she said. “I mean, every once in a while something new will happen, like dubstep, where it’s, like, ‘Oh! This is robot future music!,’ but people still just want to hear about love and partying.”\n\nGottwald turned to Irene Richter, his majordomo. “Can you send an e-mail from me to Larry Rudolph”—a prominent talent manager—“and ask if he can get Britney and Miley to tweet the Bonnie video?” Rudolph manages both Spears and Cyrus. “Tell him Katy’s already done it twice, and use Jewish guilt. Say, ‘I know they weren’t able to be in the video, so at the very least could they tweet it.’ ”\n\n“How is it Jewish guilt if neither of them are Jewish?” McKee asked.\n\n“Because I’m Jewish.”\n\n“Oh, it’s contagious!”\n\nShould they offer the track for sale? Gottwald and McKee tossed ideas around. Should they upload “American Girl” to Vevo, the industry’s music-video channel, even though that would cannibalize views from YouTube? If they did a soft launch on iTunes and the song didn’t sell, that might hurt them with programmers, when they took it to radio.\n\nMcKee was there that day to record vocals for a song called “Right Now,” an anthem that Dr. Luke and Cirkut were producing. They went upstairs to the studio, and Cirkut played back what they had done so far. Afterward, Gottwald said, “I want to go with guitars and be Def Leppard big. You know what I mean?”\n\n“You’re speaking my language!” McKee said. She went into the vocal booth, a converted closet concealed behind the panelling, and sang the opening lines of the song about a dozen times. It contained the hook “right now,” twice, embedded in a suet of mixed metaphors. “There is a fire in my heart, right now, ready like a loaded gun, heart is like a battle drum, there isn’t time to fall apart, right now.”\n\nLater Cirkut would painstakingly “comp” all the takes—compare them syllable by syllable and stitch them together into the best possible vocal—which is how Dr. Luke and Max Martin record. Comping is so mind-numbingly boring that even Gottwald, with his powers of concentration, can’t tolerate it. However, “Max loves comping,” he said. “He’ll do it for hours.”\n\nGottwald’s discography begins in 1995, at Rawkus Records, an underground hip-hop label started by his friends from guitar camp Jarret Myer and Brian Brater, together with James Murdoch, a son of Rupert’s, whom they had met at Horace Mann. Myer, who had not been in touch with Gottwald during his college years, discovered that “Lukasz had applied the same obsessive focus he had brought to the guitar to learning how to make beats.” Beat-making—using drum machines and samplers to create a percussive bed for a song—evolved from the rhythmic breaks that d.j.s would incorporate into early hip-hop party music. Synthesizers and samplers vastly increased beatmakers’ powers. A key innovation was the touchpad controller, which allows the user to play the machine with his fingers. Gottwald had a tiny studio in the basement of a building on West Twenty-first Street, where he rented an apartment, and he would disappear into it for days at a time.\n\n“Those guys came to my studio and heard my stuff and said, ‘Why don’t you put out a twelve-inch?,’ ” Gottwald recalled, “and they started asking me to do remixes. And that’s how I learned about producing. I mean, I didn’t even know what a producer was. When I was remixing I realized I was producing, but not getting credit for it. You were just fixing someone else’s production, you know?”\n\nGottwald also released several records on Rawkus as an artist, under the moniker “Kasz.” His 1998 début, a twelve-inch single called “Wet Lapse,” combines the Chemical Brothers’ techno sounds with the more lyrical electronic music made by Fatboy Slim. These records weren’t intended to be commercial; at best, they would be heard by five thousand people in a club where Gottwald was d.j.’ing. The idea was to make tracks that one of Rawkus’s lineup of rappers, which included Mos Def and Shabaam Sahdeeq, would want to rhyme to. For some reason, rappers rarely chose Gottwald’s tracks, perhaps because they didn’t sound underground enough. The music is much edgier than his later pop songs—“Wet Lapse” is like the soundtrack to a sci-fi movie in which the aliens win—but it is exquisitely crafted. Myer remembers a remark made by Alchemist, a well-known hip-hop producer. “He said, ‘Yo, this dude could be really big.’ I never forgot that.”\n\nLenny Pickett, from “S.N.L.” says, “He had very good music skills, especially in the areas he needed to have them for producing music. Equally important, he had very good social skills, because if you don’t have those, doesn’t matter how good your tracks are, you’re going to end up being somebody’s helper.” Pickett continues, “He would bring tracks in on CDs and hand them to the cast people, and say, ‘If you’re writing something that fits this, feel free to use it,’ and so his tracks started making their way into the show.”\n\nIt was during the making of one of his last Rawkus records that “Dr. Luke” replaced “Kasz” as Gottwald’s nom de guerre. (It is not true, as legend has it, that the name derives from his mixing of Adderall and Ritalin with coke and MDMA to create the perfect studio cocktail that keeps you working through the night.) “I would tell people my name was Kasz, and no one could get it,” he told me. “And, like, why have a weird name you have to explain all the time? So, one day in the studio, Mos Def just said, ‘Nah, man, your name’s not Kasz. It’s Dr. Luke, man,’ ” and it stuck. Gottwald added, “The truth is, I don’t even like ‘Dr. Luke.’ I mean, I can’t change it now, but if I could I’d think of a cooler name.”\n\nThe vital spark in the musical emergence of Dr. Luke was meeting Max Martin. The Swede was coming off the enormous success of the Backstreet Boys album “Millennium” (1999), but a boy-band backlash was setting in, and his treacly synth-only sound was falling out of favor at Top Forty stations; he needed a new beat. Martin and some Swedish friends were in New York and Gottwald was enlisted as “their guide to the night life,” as he told me. “And then that turned into me going to Sweden to hang out with Rami.” This was Rami Yacoub, who was at the time Martin’s songwriting partner, with whom he wrote “. . . Baby One More Time” (1998) and “Oops! . . . I Did It Again” (2000), the early Britney Spears hits that helped establish the contemporary dance-pop template.\n\nMartin is not so much a musical as a melody genius; he relies on others to help make the sound. At first, Gottwald became Martin’s apprentice—his beat boy. David Beal, Gottwald’s old friend, who is now a media executive, said, “In the early days, Max had a lot to offer him. And Kasz saw that if he latched onto Max, he could take it to another level.” Gottwald provided Martin with guitar sounds, as well as impeccable track-making skills and up-to-the-minute beats. Martin taught Gottwald the formula for making hits. Though they possess wildly different temperaments—Martin, the son of a policeman, is modest and straitlaced—the two clicked.\n\n“I don’t know, man,” Gottwald replied when I asked him to describe the chemistry between them. “It happened really fast. It was magical.” Martin taught him, he said, “Instead of making tracks for five thousand people, why not make tracks for a million?”\n\nTheir first No. 1 together was Kelly Clarkson’s “Since U Been Gone,” a remarkable pop record that came out in 2004. It starts off sounding like an indie-rock song. Eight measures of stripped-down rhythm are played by Gottwald, using his “bad guitar” technique, an intentionally amateurish-sounding thrashing of the top two guitar strings, fretted in a G chord. Then a punk-rock bass starts, along with electronic-sounding percussion. A subtle burst of squalling feedback, one of the song’s signature guitar-rock sounds, leads into the distorted choral hook, “Since you been gone, I can breathe for the first time,” carried along on Clarkson’s powerful (and impeccably comped) vocal, for which she won a Grammy. Suddenly it’s a great sing-and-jump-up-and-down power-pop song (if you listen closely you can hear Gottwald singing over Clarkson’s voice), set to a rock-and-roll backbeat made with crashing drums and cymbals. The song then reverts to guitar rock in the next verse and bridge; we hear fingers squeaking on guitar strings, another indie trope. Everything is frosted with the electronic sheen produced by “dynamic range compression,” which pushes even the quiet sounds right into your face and gives the song an energy and sheer volume that make it stand out in the loud public places where the music is often played.\n\n“You can’t overstate the influence Max had on Luke,” Jarret Myer says. Myer is now a co-founder, with Brian Brater, of Uproxx, a digital-media company. “One day he is remixing underground records, and the next day he is doing Kelly Clarkson. After Max, he had no inhibitions.” The producer David Baron told me, “Nobody knew that Luke was going to become the Beatles of our generation, or whatever he is. He wrote tracks that were pretty awesome, but they were a lot like other people’s tracks. And then, when he had that first hit with Kelly Clarkson, it still sounded like Luke, but he had become a great songwriter.” Now other people’s tracks started sounding like his.\n\nIn 2007, Jason Flom, then the head of Virgin Records, signed Katy Perry, who set about recording her first pop album. When Flom didn’t hear a hit on it, he turned to Dr. Luke and Max Martin. Perry had met Gottwald several years earlier, somewhat reluctantly. At the time, she told me, she was fed up with “all these superhero-y aliases that people were using, like ‘The Matrix.’ So I said, ‘If he’s not a real doctor then I don’t want to meet him.’ ” But they did meet, and, Perry added, “We kind of hung out and really vibed well, and also he brought in Max Martin. It was always a combination pack. I really liked them together. They have great taste, and I have an intuition that has never failed me. I am very lyrics-based, and Max is very melody-based, and Luke is very track-based, so put the combination of us together and you get that ultimate pop song.” Together, in Gottwald’s West Twenty-first Street studio, they wrote “I Kissed a Girl” and “Hot n Cold,” which continued to develop the seamless blend of live instruments and synths that has become the Dr. Luke–Max Martin sound. Flom added those two songs to Perry’s album, “One of the Boys,” and they made her a superstar. The trio wrote four of the five No. 1 songs on Perry’s next album, “Teenage Dream,” which tied Michael Jackson’s album “Bad” for the most chart-toppers. Dr. Luke had as many No. 1s in 2010 as the Beatles had in any single year.\n\nPerry is on Capitol, so, in order to work on her new album, Dr. Luke had to ask Doug Morris, of Sony Music, for an exemption from his deal as a Sony-only hitmaker, which Morris granted. (Morris was less generous when Dr. Luke was momentarily enrobed as the third judge on the new season of “American Idol,” which has a deal with Universal. Morris put the kibosh on the doctor’s judgeship after the Hollywood Reporter and Time had already announced it.)\n\nMost of Perry’s new songs were written this spring. “Luke and Max came to Santa Barbara,” Perry told me, “and we’d hang out, go to the ocean, have nice dinners. There’s this really amazing studio we like to work at called the Secret Garden, and it’s in the woods of Montecito. We go there and listen to music, we do a lot of YouTubing, we drink some Chablis. Luke and his protégé Cirkut make these little beds of music for me to listen to, not too long, just kind of appetizer-size, and then they’ll do the full entrées if I like them.”\n\n“Roar,” the first single from the new album, was released in mid-August, and went to No. 1 three weeks later, easily besting Lady Gaga’s concurrent single, “Applause.” On the Internet, much was made of the song’s similarity to “Brave,” by Sara Bareilles, which had come out in April. The songs are in the same key and tempo—both begin with eighth notes played on the piano—and they share inspirational messages. (The hooks are, respectively, “You’re gonna hear me roar” and “I wanna see you be brave.”) Bareilles had no problem with “Roar”—the buzz gave her song a second life on the charts—tweeting, “All love, everybody. All love.” But other songwriters in similar circumstances have been less magnanimous. The Rubinoos, a power-pop group, accused Dr. Luke of using part of their song “I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend” in Avril Lavigne’s 2007 hit “Girlfriend”; The Asphalt, a rock band, charged him with stealing the hook from their song “Tonight” in Daughtry’s “Feels Like Tonight” (2008); and the songwriter Chrissy claimed that Dr. Luke knocked off her 2006 song “My Slushy” in Kesha’s “Tik Tok” (2009). Though lawsuits were filed in some instances, none were successful.\n\nIn a 2011 interview in American Songwriter, Gottwald defended himself against these accusations, saying, “A lot of things are similar. But you don’t get sued for being similar. It needs to be the same thing. Almost doesn’t count. Close but no cigar.” On the subject of “Brave,” he told me, “I like the song! But we wrote and recorded our song months prior to that song being released. I had never heard it before.”\n\nCharges of theft are rampant in the Top Forty business. Because so much pop music is mass-produced, according to a formula, a lot of it sounds alike. And, thanks to Internet mashups, it’s easy to hear how alike many songs really are. Marvin Gaye’s children recently accused Pharrell Williams and Robin Thicke of stealing one of Gaye’s songs in their summer hit, “Blurred Lines.” Thicke maintained that their song merely evokes Gaye’s “groove.” He told GQ in May, before the accusation surfaced, “Pharrell and I were in the studio, and I told him that one of my favorite songs of all time was Marvin Gaye’s ‘Got to Give It Up.’ I was like, ‘Damn, we should make something like that, something with that groove.’ ” In August, Thicke offered a six-figure settlement, which the family turned down, then sued Gaye’s children, asserting that there was no copyright infringement, before they could sue him.\n\nIf one examines Gottwald’s metamorphosis from Lukasz to Kasz to Dr. Luke, the progress is toward increasing control over the process of creating and selling music. (As Jarret Myer observed, “A lot of his personality is still tied to making sure he gets the right margin on dime bags. Sometimes he doesn’t let things go.”) But to have real control—to be more than the appetizer-maker to the queen—Dr. Luke needs to discover and develop his own superstars, so that he can participate in every aspect of their career. That’s what he hoped to do with Kesha, but things weren’t going exactly as planned. And Bonnie McKee’s song “American Girl” peaked at No. 87.\n\nGottwald has high hopes for Becky G, a sixteen-year-old Mexican-American artist he signed to Kemosabe in 2011. He saw her in a YouTube video, rapping over a Kanye and Jay-Z song, “Otis,” arranged a meeting, and signed her on the spot.\n\n“She’s got it,” he said. “A lot of these young kids are too ‘Star Search’-y—they’ve got a mother who has been hauling them off to auditions since they were little. But Becky isn’t like that. Whatever she has, she got on her own, from watching videos.” He added, “Becky G is a very nice respectful girl who was brought up right by her parents with solid values.” She’s also easy to work with, which is not always the case with rappers. But whether or not a respectful girl who follows orders will appeal to rap fans remains to be seen.\n\nBecky G, whose given name is Rebbeca Gomez, was scheduled to come over from her grandparents’ home in Inglewood on my final day at the studio. Gottwald wanted her to write a rap to the bridge in a Jessie J song he had co-written, “Excuse My Rude,” so that she could be featured on the record.\n\nBefore she got there, I asked Gottwald how he felt about turning forty. (His birthday was in September.) Hitmaking tends to be a younger man’s game (female hitmakers, though much less common than males, often last longer), and there’s widespread evidence that the magic goes away, sometimes overnight. When I asked Benny Blanco, who at twenty-five has already co-written fourteen No. 1s, whether he worried about this, he replied, “Totally, man. It could go away at any second. It’s very easy to fall off the horse in this game.” Dr. Luke didn’t seem too concerned, though he did allow, somewhat ominously, “All your instincts that make you successful, at some point in anyone’s life, those instincts will be wrong.”\n\nBecky G arrived, modestly dressed in a tracksuit. She is petite, with high cheekbones and a gap-toothed smile that is sassy but friendly. (She is the new face of Covergirl cosmetics, in both English and Spanish.)\n\nGottwald nodded toward Cirkut, and the Jessie J song began to play. The hook was “Excuse my rude but I really fucking hate you.” Everyone bobbed their heads to the beat. At the end, Gottwald said, “It’s a dope song. I think you can go hard on it.”\n\n“Oh, yeah,” Gomez said. “For sure. Make it gorilla!”\n\n“I know no one ever does anything bad to you because everyone loves you, but just imagine.”\n\n“I’ll just go on YouTube and read comments.”\n\n“Anonymous haters.”\n\n“Yeah.”\n\nGomez noted that her mother didn’t allow her to swear in her raps.\n\n“I think swearing, though it sounds cool, is overrated,” Gottwald said. “Usually, when you make the clean version, you have to think, and most of the time that one’s better.”\n\nThey went downstairs, where lunch had been procured from a takeout spot. Gottwald was seated at the head of the table, the barefoot paterfamilias of a pop empire, his turkey burger with avocado waiting behind a selection of hot sauces.\n\nBecky G, spying the kiddie car, sat down in it and, scrunching up her knees, began to drive in circles around the living space, childish delight in her face. Dr. Luke looked on, beaming. ♦"
