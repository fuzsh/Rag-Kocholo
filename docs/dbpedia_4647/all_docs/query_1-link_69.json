        "text": "A handful or so of the very biggest LGBTQ names on the pop music scene will make their way to D.C. this fall to perform for local fans. The all-star lineup includes two nights of Janelle Monae and one of the Brothers Osbourne at the Anthem, plus Rufus Wainwright at The Birchmere, Todrick Hall at Warner, and Tegan and Sara and boygenius at Merriweather Post Pavilion.\n\nThe lesbian Quin twins and the queer supergroup of Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers, and Lucy Dacus will both visit Merriweather next weekend as part of this year’s All Things Go festival, another one in which women account for more than half the lineup, and there’s clear queer appeal on tap, as well.\n\nObviously, All Things Go is not your typical festival — and that’s a big reason for its success. D.C. will also play host to another music festival this fall, as the first stop on the LoveLoud tour, a three-city mini festival raising awareness and funds for LGBTQ causes.\n\nIf you’re looking for a new queer artist to get behind, you could do worse than to look to the fall lineups at Comet Ping Pong and Songbyrd, as both venues have a notable number of promising LGBTQ artists to consider. Three acts we’d recommend checking out first are Chappell Roan at the 9:30 Club, Lauren Sanderson at the Black Cat, and Rosie Tucker at Comet Ping Pong.\n\nThe fall docket also presents concerts by two preeminent gay divas, Madonna and Patti LaBelle. But one of the most unexpected listings on offer the entire season pertains to one particular band listing at Blues Alley, where you’ll find the name of a popular local politician among the featured musicians.\n\n9:30 CLUB\n\n815 V St. NW\n\n877-435-9849\n\nwww.930.com\n\nChristian French — Opening sets from Ben Kessler and Lisa Heller (9/23)\n\nLow Cut Connie (9/23)\n\nMovements — With three opening acts Mannequin Pussy, Softcult, and Heart to Gold (9/26)\n\nNeon Trees — The Favorite Daze Tour with this gay-fronted Utah-based indie-glam-rock/dance band (9/27)\n\nThe 8th Annual Law Rocks — Legal professionals aren’t quitting their day jobs, they’re just moonlighting as rock stars to raise money for a charitable cause that since 2015 has raised over $615,000 for local nonprofits (9/28)\n\nRaye (9/29)\n\nKennyHoopla — The Raised by Wolves Tour, with support from Groupthink (9/30)\n\nSlowdive — Drab Majesty opens (9/30)\n\nIDK (10/1)\n\nExplosions in the Sky — Two nights of The End Tour, the first night featuring an opening set by Glom, the second The Experience Band (10/3-4)\n\nBenny Sings (10/5)\n\nSun Room (10/6)\n\nThe Aces — This queer act is out on the I’ve Loved You For So Long World Tour, and, in partnership with Sound Mind Live, $1 per ticket goes to support “future free-to-the-community mental health programming across the country” (10/7)\n\nMaisie Peters — A sold-out show on The Good Witch Comes to North America tour with support from Grace Enger (10/9)\n\nGeorge Clanton — U Street Music Hall co-presents this show with support from Frost Children and Death’s Dynamic Shroud (10/11)\n\nChromeo — Funk Yourself Tour by this fun and funky L.A. dance-pop duo (10/12)\n\nKings Kaleidoscope (10/13)\n\nLittle Dragon (10/13)\n\nMelt (10/14)\n\nDisco Lines — The Good Good Tour presented by U Street Music Hall (10/14)\n\nMaude Latour — Twin Flame Tour with Devon Again (10/15)\n\nJessie Ware — That!
