        "text": "A selective listing by critics of The Times of noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.\n\n* AARKTICA, Lit, 93 Second Avenue, at Fifth Street, East Village, (212) 777-7987. In the opening song of Aarktica's latest album, ''Pure Tone Audiometry'' (Silber), Jon DeRosa wonders, ''Am I out to sea, farther than I need to be?/To find my way home, I don't know.'' Aarktica's songs are extended reveries, built on loops of guitars and drums and occasional voices. The musical elements hover and circle, float by or bristle with distortion, as the songs drift through serenity and trouble. Tonight at 8, with Electric Bird Noise, Clang and Remora opening; admission is $5 (Jon Pareles).\n\n''AFTER YODEL: NEW SWISS MUSIC,'' Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501. Curated by the visual artist and turntablist Christian Marclay, this mini-festival connects the new improvised electro-acoustic music from Switzerland with its American counterpart. Tonight's musicians include Mytha, Norbert Moeslang, Dorothea Schurch and Stephan Wittwer, and finally Mr. Wittwer with the New Yorkers Lee Ranaldo and Alan Licht. Tomorrow: a duet between the Jacques Demierre and the Chinese pipa player Min-Xiao Fen; then the Koch-Studer-Schuetz trio. Sunday includes Ralph Steinbruechel and o.blaat, and another collaboration between Swiss and New York musicians, a duet between Martin Schuetz and the cellist Okkyung Lee. All shows begin at 8 p.m.; admission is $12 (Ben Ratliff).\n\nALLMAN BROTHERS BAND, Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, Manhattan, (212) 496-7070. The archetypal Southern rock band is still on the road, deploying Gregg Allman's weary blues moan and the chiming twin guitars of Warren Haynes and Derek Trucks, and letting those long jams ripple and peal. The band has just released its first album of new songs in nine years, ''Hittin' the Note'' (Peach/Sanctuary), though fans will still be bellowing '' 'Whipping Post'!'' Today and tomorrow, plus five more shows through March 30, all at 8 p.m.; tickets are $45.99 to $65.99 (Pareles).\n\nRICHARD BARONE, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, near Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200. Mr. Barone, who led the Bongos in the 1980's, is still attached to the alchemy of a well-turned melody with a touch of heartbreak in the lyrics and a hint of chamber-music intimacy. He has been putting together a Peggy Lee tribute for the JVC Jazz Festival and will be singing versions of songs by Cole Porter and Yoko Ono along with some of Ms. Lee's material. Tonight at 9:30; admission is $15 (Pareles).\n\nALESSANDRA BELLONI, St. James Chapel, Cathedral of St. John the Divine, 1047 Amsterdam Avenue, at 112th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 662-2133. Ms. Belloni is a singer, dancer and percussionist who plays the southern Italian tambourine called the tamborello and has spent years researching the music of Southern Italy. She plays love songs and galloping tarantellas, ritual chants and drumming for the Black Madonna and some ever-useful songs against the evil eye. The music incorporates both traditional and international approaches, with a group that includes John La Barbera on various stringed instruments (including the old Italian chitarra battente), Steve Gorn on bansuri (Indian wooden flute) and Mauro Refosco, a Brazilian percussionist. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $20, $15 for students and 65+ (Pareles).\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
