        "text": "Irish traditional music has moved through many spaces, from the kitchen to the dancehall, from the concert stage to the international festival space. Each space has impacted on the sound, identity and context for the music. Despite all of this movement, it is perhaps within the space most often associated with Irish traditional music, that of the public house session, that demonstrates not only movement in and through music, but the contours of society in Ireland and beyond. This paper develops from observations in a session space to observations of other session spaces and includes the voices of many of the stakeholders including the audience, the bar manager, the professional musician and the retired farmer who enjoys singing a few songs each week. Who these people are and their roles in the session are a reflection on the society in which we live. The session is bracketed between the end of the UEFA Champion’s League game featuring an English Premier League team and the time the taxi-driver comes to take people home, all readily aware of the new drink driving limits. The fluidity of music and people is readily evident. The man drinking a pint at the bar will sing a song; the tin whistle player will go for a while for a pint at the bar. Irish people sing American songs about ‘Hard Times’ and Polish people sing Irish songs about emigration. The bodhrán player is up from the city and is planning on going to the Tradfest up the country at the weekend. Some of the musicians are planning trips for St. Patrick’s Day – the manager wonders will there be anybody left locally to play. The commentary on the session is at once an exploration of musical practice and contemplation on Irish society at a time of great change and greater mobility."
