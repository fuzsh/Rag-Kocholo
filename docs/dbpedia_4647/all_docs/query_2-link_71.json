        "text": "Agent: Lori Peters\n\nBooking in collaboration with Prater Day virginia@praterday.com (Eastern US) and Lost Buffalo Artists molliefarr@lostbuffaloartists. com (Midwest)\n\nA century of forgetfulness and erasure has led to diminished public awareness of the Black string band tradition – and equally diminished numbers of Black string bands. Once numerous, these ensembles have grown few and far between. In recent decades, only one Black string band has emerged per generation. The 1980’s saw the birth of the Ebony Hillbillies. Nearly three decades later, the Carolina Chocolate Drops formed and took the tradition to new heights. As of 2023, a new Black string band has emerged to carry the torch: New Dangerfield."
