        "text": "I’ve always found what Hal Willner did to be something magical.\n\nThe term “producer” never seemed quite enough to describe Willner, who died today, just days after being hospitalized with the coronavirus. There was always something alchemical about the way he approached music, something wizardly about the manner in which he matched unusual talents with unexpected repertoire.\n\nTo be sure, he made some brilliant records that captured certain individual artists at or near their apex – Lou Reed’s Ecstasy, Lucinda Williams’ West, and most especially Marianne Faithfull’s Strange Weather all spring to mind. (Strangely, I spent a good deal of time last weekend with the latter album, after word of Faithfull’s own COVID-19 diagnosis came to light.) A product of the downtown music scene, and no doubt something of a beatnik at heart, he also helmed off-the-wall major-label records by Allen Ginsberg and William S. Burroughs.\n\nBut, like many fans of his work, I cherish him most for his mix-and-match tribute albums, which began with Amarcord Nino Rota, a homage to the composer of many great Federico Fellini scores released in 1981. Other fascinating collections, all featuring diverse multitudes of artists, devoted to Disney movie music, Kurt Weill, Thelonious Monk, and Charles Mingus followed. (I was not drawn so much to his similarly styled compilations of sea shantys, but I have never been especially nautical.)\n\nIn a 2006 review of another such project, about which I will say more in a moment, I noted, “The trouble with touchstones usually lies with the people who are touching them.” That was never a problem for Willner. He never really failed when he essayed an artistic canon, thanks to his cultural savvy, exquisite taste, great good humor, love of outliers and outlaws, and inherent embrace of risk and weirdness. Sometimes a track would miss the bullseye, or wouldn’t even hit the target, but one always sensed that he was stretching for the right combination, the outrageous or delightful pairing, the marvelous. Though he employed huge hordes of musicians on his records, they always ultimately sounded like his work. He had what the great producers all exhibit: a strong personality that was always felt in his recordings.\n\nThey were splendid things, but occasionally Willner took his productions to the stage; he was apparently quite active mounting unique evenings at St. Anne’s Cathedral in Brooklyn. He was always a New York guy, so those of us on the Left Coast seldom got to catch his live thing in action.\n\nBut in 2001, he decided to reprise a concept he had launched in 1999 at concerts in New York and London, and brought the Harry Smith Project to UCLA’s Royce Hall for one exhausting, mind-fucking night. My review of the show for the LA Weekly is oddly absent from the paper’s web archive, so I am necessarily reconstructing.\n\nThe photo at the top of this piece – shot by Bruce Weber at the venue on April 25, 2001, the day of the concert, and posted on Willner’s Facebook page today by Joel Zifkin – gives a notion of the sensibility that was at play in the producer’s work, and at that particular show. The Harry Smith Project was an attempt to bring the titular filmmaker, collector, amateur anthropologist, and OG New York boho scenester’s 1952 Folkways Records compilation Anthology of American Folk Music, the eccentric, timeless fount for the American folk revival, in all its oddball glory.\n\nJust look at that collection of talent. That’s Willner front and center. Among his collaborators, who put flesh on the old bones of early blues, hillbilly, Cajun, gospel, and traditional ballad material: Elvis Costello. Marianne Faithfull. David Thomas. Richard Thompson. David Johansen. Philip Glass. Steve Earle. Van Dyke Parks. Todd Rundgren. Garth Hudson. Beck. Don Byron. All those and more, backed by a house band that included Bill Frisell, Smokey Hormel, Richard Greene, D.J. Bonebrake, and the late Ralph Carney and Larry Taylor.\n\nIt proved to be a long evening that stretched beyond the five-hour mark. Inevitably, with something like three dozen tunes performed, there were some lags, but the highlights – some of which were heard and seen on the Shout! Factory CD/DVD box that was released five years later – lifted people out of their seats: Johansen’s “James Alley Blues”…Faithfull’s “John the Revelator”…Thomas’ “Fishing Blues”…Earle’s “Country Blues”…Thompson’s “The Coo Coo Bird”…Costello’s “Henry Lee.” When the house lights came up after 1 a.m., Hudson, the Band’s great keyboardist, sat down behind the hall’s pipe organ and played a recessional from outer space.\n\nIt was not so much an organized concert event as it was a series of unexpected, sharp collisions between performers and material. It maybe shouldn’t have worked, but somehow it did, most of the time. At its best, the Harry Smith gig offered moments of ineffable delight, usually as the result of a completely unanticipated combination of an artist and a song.\n\nIt was sorcery, really. But it all was down to Hal Willner, who always had a way with the wand. Sadly, we will have no more of his powerful juju."
