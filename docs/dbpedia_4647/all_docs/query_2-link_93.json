        "text": "Akron, Ohio-based indie poppers Librarians With Hickeys return with a new video for 2022, illuminating their 2021 hit “I Can’t Stop Thinking About You.”\n\nThe single is set for inclusion on their new album, Handclaps & Tambourines, this October on Big Stir Records.\n\nThe video for the single is an exercise in the liberties of the public domain, as the band utilizes found film clips via the Prelinger Archive from the early 60s to visually channel the feelings of longing imbued within the rhythm and jangle.\n\n“It seems to be about the various ways in which I was really missing that certain someone,” explains singer/guitarist Ray Carmen. “While on the surface it’s about someone missing their partner, underneath it’s really about the isolation of the past two years and not being able to see friends, loved ones, and band mates during the pandemic.”\n\nThe video itself, meanwhile, was created and cut by the band’s lead guitarist Mike Crooker.\n\n“It extols the virtues of both public domain film footage AND Dick York!” Mike says. “The video is a fun romp through found film clips via the Prelinger Archive. Sharp-eyed viewers might recognize bits used in shorts by Mystery Science Theater 3000 (MST3K) such as the monorail from the 1962 Seattle World’s Fair in “Century 21 Calling”. See how many you can spot! Included are wide range of subjects — the selling of cars, refrigerators, medication, how to survive an atomic war — and of course how to cope with heartbreak, love, loneliness and the crushing anxiety of modern life. Timeless!”\n\nLibrarians With Hickeys are: Ray Carmen (lead vocals, rhythm guitar, keys), Mike Crooker (lead and rhythm guitars, keys, backing vocals), Andrew Wilco (bass), and Rob Crossley (drums).\n\nCheck out the video below.\n\nVIDEO: Librarians With Hickeys “I Can’t Stop Thinking About You”"
