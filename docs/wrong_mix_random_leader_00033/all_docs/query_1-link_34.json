        "text": "Topline\n\nA months-long ownership dispute over the Minnesota Timberwolves is headed to arbitration this month, pitting the team’s prospective buyers—former MLB MVP Alex Rodriguez and e-commerce mogul Marc Lore—against the team’s billionaire owner in a nasty legal dispute, even as the Timberwolves push forward in their best playoff run in years.\n\nKey Facts\n\nSurprising Fact\n\nThe Timberwolves, a 1989 expansion team, have never won an NBA championship, and have never appeared in the NBA Finals, having only made the Western Conference Finals once in 2004, in which they lost in six games to the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nWhat To Watch For\n\nThe Timberwolves face elimination in a conference semifinal matchup against the defending NBA champion Denver Nuggets on Thursday night at 8:30 p.m. EDT. The Nuggets hold a 3-2 lead in the series, with the winner advancing to the Western Conference finals, playing the winner of the series between the Dallas Mavericks and the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nForbes Valuation\n\nWe estimate Taylor’s net worth at $2.9 billion, making him the 1,207th-richest person in the world.\n\nTangent\n\nRodriguez, a three-time MLB MVP and 2009 World Series champion with the New York Yankees, set an MLB record in 2001 when he landed what at that point was the largest contract in league history, at $252 million, before breaking his own record in 2008, opting out of the remainder of his 10-year deal for a new 10-year contract worth $275 million. Rodriguez also stands in fifth on the MLB’s all-time home run leaderboard, with 696 home runs over his two-plus-decade career, though that list is mired in controversy over the use of performance-enhancing drugs, which Rodriguez admitted to taking in 2009.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nStar TribuneMonetary damages could come into play during ongoing dispute over Timberwolves, Lynx sale ESPN.comSources: A-Rod, Lore get new backing for Wolves"
