        "text": "Minnesota Timberwolves 2022: News, Schedule, Roster, Score, Injury Report\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves compete in the NBA as part of the Northwest Division in the Western Conference. The Wolves decided on their name after they held a ?name the team? contest and finalized between ?Timberwolves? and ?Polars.??\n\nThe franchise has seen several logo re-brandings over the years, but they?ve always included the iconic Wolf as a part of it. Their most recent logo was unveiled in 2017, which contained massive changes from the previous one.\n\nThe logo contains a howling wolf in the foreground, supported by a basketball at the back. The phrase ?Minnesota Timberwolves? is arched at the top, and the logo?s color palette is designed to bring out the spirit of the city.?\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves play their home games at the Target Center, which has been their home since 1990. The arena has played host to several events and concerts, and Minnesota Lynx of the WNBA share this arena as their home along with the Wolves.\n\nWho owns the Minnesota Timberwolves??\n\nBillionaire businessman Glen Taylor owns a majority stake in the Minnesota Timberwolves franchise. He also owns a majority stake in the WNBA team Minnesota Lynx and Forbes estimates his Net Worth to be $2.5 billion.\n\nHead Coach and top executives\n\nChris Finch has been serving as the team?s head coach. The Wolves appointed him after Tom Thibodeau and another interim coach.\n\nSachin Gupta has executive basketball experience, and that is why the Wolves made him their President of Basketball Operations.?Sachin Gupta is also the current General Manager of the team, while Ethan Casson is the CEO of the Minnesota Timberwolves.?\n\nHistory\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves were formed in 1989 as the NBA?s expansion team. As mentioned at the top, they got their name by holding a contest. ?Timberwolves? was chosen as the most suitable name for the team.\n\nGenerally the case with every expansion team, the Minnesota Timberwolves initially struggled in the league. In fact, they failed to qualify for the playoffs during their first seven years in the association.?\n\nThe team then made a massive step towards development by signing Kevin Garnett. They selected Garnett with the #5 pick in the 1995 NBA Draft. Upon signing Garnett, the team made their first playoff appearance in 1997.?\n\nGarnett had a visible positive impact on the team and guided them to the playoffs for eight consecutive years. He grew dangerously good as the 2000s decade dawned, but he couldn?t get past the conference finals with the Wolves.?\n\nKevin Garnett also won his only league MVP award during his time with the Minnesota Timberwolves. He averaged a career-high 24.2 points and 13.9 rebounds during the 2003-04 season while shooting 49.9% from the field.?\n\nThe Wolves' downfall began when Kevin Garnett left the team in 2007. The franchise has struggled to get back on a strong note ever since its success days in the early 2000s. In fact, the Wolves have only made the playoffs once since the 2004-05 season.?\n\nTeam?s mascot and uniforms\n\n?Crunch the Wolf? is the official mascot of the Minnesota Timberwolves. According to the Wolves? website, Crunch was born in Minnesota wilderness with an undying love for the game and migrated to the franchise once they were formed in the Twin cities.?\n\nHe is a regular-entertainer during their home games and stands about six feet tall from the ground. The Wolves have even listed Crunch?s vertical jump as 15 feet (with trampoline)!\n\nThe primary uniform colors used by the Wolves are midnight blue, aurora green, grey, and white. These colors take charge in their jerseys and the color scheme varies depending on the type of uniform they wear for each game.?\n\nTeam?s sponsors\n\nElectronics and Fitness company ?Fitbit? is the main sponsor of the Minnesota Timberwolves. They also endorse their brand through jersey patches.?\n\nMoreover, the franchise also has tie-ups with other companies such as Homestead Road and CFMoto.??\n\nAchievements and History\n\nFounded?\n\n1989\n\nConference\n\nWesternDivision?\n\nNorthwest\n\nPresident\n\nSachin GuptaGeneral Manager\n\nSachin Gupta\n\nHead Coach?\n\nChris FinchArena?\n\nTarget Center\n\nChampionships (0)\n\n-Conference Titles (0)\n\n-\n\nDivision Titles (1)\n\n(2004)\n\nWebsite\n\nwww.nba.com/timberwolves\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves 2021-22 roster?"
