        "text": "The world is a miracle, unfolding in the pitch dark.\n\n— Barry Lopez, “The Mappist”\n\nJust because you can travel to a place doesn’t mean you can know it.\n\n—Alan DeNiro, “Salting the Map”\n\nLike most things with us fantasy readers and writers, it started with Tolkien.\n\nI saw the map at the beginning of my now-battered Ballantine version of The Hobbit all those years ago. The book had two maps in it, for crying out loud — my eleven-year-old self had never seen such a thing. I wondered if there’d be some sort of quiz at the end of the book — was Mount Gundabad at the northern or southern tip of the Misty Mountains? (No fair peeking!)\n\nI can’t tell you how many times I drew and re-drew that map. I think I even tried to recreate it on an old Apple II computer, using BASIC (ouch, just aged myself, big-time). I studied it, wondered about those Woodmen living on the western border of Mirkwood, and of course traced the path taken by Bilbo and the dwarves on the way to their final meeting with Smaug the dragon.\n\nAnd then I got a copy of The Fellowship of the Ring and saw how that little slice of the world from The Hobbit fit into the much bigger world of Middle-Earth, and I was hooked. Forget sketching the map of the land — I wanted to live there! (Orcs and wargs and all.)\n\n…\n\nRead More Read More\n\nDon’t bother just to be better than your contemporaries or predecessors. Try to be better than yourself.\n\n— William Faulkner\n\nBecause this series about riding about the dragon called Publishing is geared at writers just starting out writing fantasy stories and novels, I thought I’d pull together another list (I love lists!) that include all the helpful stuff I wish I’d known back in 1995, when I was just starting out.\n\nTen Things I Know Now That I Wish I’d Known When I First Started\n\nYOUR FAVORITE STORY OR NOVEL THAT YOU’VE EVER WRITTEN SHOULD BE THE ONE YOU’RE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW. Enthusiasm for your current project is priceless, in my opinion, and you should never rest on your laurels. Always try to improve yourself as a writer, just like an athlete or musician always works to get better for the next big game or performance.\n\n…\n\nRead More Read More\n\nI love writing. I love the swirl and swing of words as they tangle with human emotions.\n\n— James Michener\n\nSo you’re ready to embark on writing your new fantasy story, hopefully one that the folks at Black Gate will want to snatch up as soon as you type the words “The End” on it.\n\nYou’ve got your story idea, sitting there like a lump of Play-Doh that still conforms to the shape of the plastic container you just shook it out of. You know, that perfect cylinder shape that is exciting to absolutely no one.\n\nTime to start squishing and pulling and twisting. But where to begin, you ask? It all starts, of course, with your main character.\n\nAs we discussed earlier, most people tend to start a story with a person, in some sort of situation. But let’s just say you haven’t even gotten that far. You just have an average person, sitting in a white room. Nothing’s happening.\n\nLet’s start by getting inside that character’s head. Which you can do most effectively by asking questions:\n\nWhat is the one thing he or she (or it — this is speculative fiction, you know) wants the most out of life?\n\nWhat’s the one thing your protagonist will do nearly anything for?\n\nIs it an object? Another person? A goal? An idea?\n\n…\n\nRead More Read More\n\n“Every writer I know has trouble writing.”\n\n— Joseph Heller\n\nPreviously in this series about writing, we’ve talked about ways to get story ideas as well as different approaches you can take to writing your story, novel, comic script, screenplay, or other related screed, tome, or pamphlet.\n\nBut what about the single most important aspect of the writing process? Yes, I’m talking about butt-in-chair time. How do you get yourself into a good schedule and motivated to write?\n\nVery good question.\n\nMy answer? Below I’ve listed my top-ten list of tricks and techniques I’ve used that help me get more productive (and less annoyed with myself for not having gotten and writing done):\n\n…\n\nRead More Read More\n\n“There are nine and sixty ways of constructing tribal lays, and every single one of them is right.”\n\n— Rudyard Kipling\n\nOkay, writers. Let’s say you have a short story idea or two, but you don’t know the best way to write it. Some sage writers with some sales under their belts tell you that you Must Outline. Other wisened authors tell you to just, “Go where the story takes you,” that you shouldn’t outline at all.\n\nSo what’s a new writer to do? Who’s right?\n\nWell, they all are, of course. They’re right about what works for them.\n\nYou have to figure out what works best for you.\n\n…\n\nRead More Read More\n\nBeing a writer is like having homework every day for the rest of your life.\n\n— Lawrence Kasdan\n\nWhen John from Black Gate suggested I do a guest blog about writing for short fiction markets, I had to check to make sure he hadn’t intended his email for someone else. Surely he meant to send that email to my co-writer for the story “Devil on the Wind,” from Black Gate 14. That would be Jay Lake, who has over 200 story publications and counting.\n\nBut nope, the email was correct.\n\nAnd a quick look at my list of stories over on my website seems to confirm the fact that I may indeed have figured how to sell a short story — fifty story publications thus far. And I have thirty more stories out to various publishers (fingers crosssed!).\n\nHere’s the thing, though. You never figure out the trick to this writing gig. Soon as you think you’ve got it understood, you’re sunk.\n\nBecause you can’t rest on your laurels. Trust me on this — even though I’ve sold stories to great places like Asimov’s, Strange Horizons, Interzone, and to this fine magazine as well, I still get rejections aplenty. And while my focus has moved from short stories to novels, with the occasional comic script, I always have fun writing stories.\n\nBut I still have more to learn. Much more. And I’d like to share some of what I’ve learned along the way.\n\n…\n\nRead More Read More"
