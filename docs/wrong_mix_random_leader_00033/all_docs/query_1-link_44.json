(The route also ends in St. Paul, so we approve.)\n\nThe Minnesota State Fair used the craze to promote its annual Kickoff to Summer at the Fair this weekend, posting a photo of gopher mascots Fairchild and Fairborne pointing to the slogan on the Grandstand marquee.\n\nCould Edwards’ instant-classic phrase become the new state slogan after all? Gov. Tim Walz — who on Wednesday declared May 22 official “Wolves Back Day” in Minnesota with a statement that also used the first-letter trick to spell out the phrase — replied to the suggestion on X (formerly Twitter) with an excited-eyes emoji.\n\nAnd if you’re going to shout out your state pride, you’d better say it right: The phrase may be three words, but it’s two syllables, says comedian and media personality Sheletta Brundidge.\n\n“Dear White People,” she wrote in a graphic on X. “It’s actually pronounced BRING-YASS!”\n\nThe NBA Western Conference Finals, between the Wolves and the Dallas Mavericks, begin this week at Target Center in Minneapolis. No ticket? No sweat: For Friday’s Game 2 matchup, the team is holding an outdoor block party for fans in downtown Minneapolis.\n\nOriginally Published: May 22, 2024 at 11:31 a.m."
