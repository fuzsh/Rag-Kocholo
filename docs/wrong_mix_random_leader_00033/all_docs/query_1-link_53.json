        "text": "PHOENIX — Minnesota coach Chris Finch has a ruptured patellar tendon in his right knee after a collision with Timberwolves guard Mike Conley in the fourth quarter of the team’s playoff win over the Phoenix Suns on Sunday night.\n\nFinch was helped off the court and later left the arena on a cart. The Timberwolves confirmed the nature of Finch’s injury.\n\nConley was trying to dribble down the sideline when he collided with Suns star Devin Booker and ran into Finch. Conley tried to brace their fall, but Finch grimaced and immediately grabbed his right knee.\n\nHe was down for a few minutes, surrounded by Minnesota players, coaches and staff, before slowly getting up and being assisted off the court.\n\nMinnesota beat the Phoenix Suns 122-116 to sweep the first-round series, advancing to the second round for the first time since 2004.\n\nAssistant coach Micah Nori directed the team for the final 1:41. Nori said Finch was in the medical room getting checked out and that the team went down to see him after the game.\n\n“He’s obviously in good spirits and so are the guys,” Nori said.\n\nConley said he didn’t see Finch until the last moment and tried to hold him up following the collision. The veteran guard couldn’t help but tell a joke or two at the coach’s expense after the Game 4 victory.\n\n“I told him to sit his (butt) down — he shouldn’t be standing up like that late in the game,” Conley said. “He’s in the way. But prayers up for him, I’m sure he’ll be fine.”\n\n___\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA"
