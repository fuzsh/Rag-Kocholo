Liberal Democracy In Canada When evaluating the liberal democracy or constitutional monarchy in Canada it is imperative to identify that the Canadian governing system cannot unambiguously be either correct or incorrect. Hence, Canada s democratic system functions well enough; nonetheless it would further benefit from adopting a Nordic democratic socialist model as well as adopting a proportional representation electoral system. A Nordic democratic system would benefit the citizens by providing them with universal health care, closely similar wages, free and inexpensive education, public pension plans, and virtually free trade. Second, if Canada is to adopt a proportional representation system the citizens will be better represented. Despite these flaws in the liberal ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... This is an often overlooked freedom because one may forget that this freedom is not a freedom that every individual has. Specifically in many third or second world countries, people are eradicated because of their opinions or request for freedom and reform. Something as simple as civil disobedience has severe consequences in these countries. On the other hand, in Canada there are little to no consequences for civil disobedience or requesting the government to change their decision. Furthermore, in a sense the government allows pressure groups to be formed, and non government organizations to help other s lives. Additionally, courts in Canada are open to those who wish to challenge the laws. Finally, the media is not censored for those who wish to promote their beliefs. In many totalitarian countries, people are unknowingly snatched of the right to think on their own, and demand reform. As a result, though the Canadian liberal democracy may have flaws, the rights and freedoms that are often overlooked affect the everyday lives of the citizens and the government ...

Obviously, it is a serious risk to the environment, and comes with many more cons than pros. Why damage our world long term not that we haven t done that already when we can just find other ways to get water for the Californians? First of all, desalination is highly expensive. According to the NewsELA article titled, California Tries One Solution to Water Problems Treating Seawater, by the Sacramento Bee staff, getting water will cost $2,257 per acre foot. This is double the price of the authority s most expensive supply of water now. Double! Already the U.S. is investing too much money in things that could be solved in a much more practical way. We don t need desalination to provide water to people. Clearly, desalination is not a realistic idea, due to the cost of it. People s water bills will go shoot through the roof, and the project is expected to cost $1 billion. One acre foot can only serve two average homes per year, meaning that desalination will only meet 7% of San Diego s annual water needs. 7% is not worth it. 7% will do nothing but damage the oceans and ocean life. Think about it this way: say that a county has 150 homes in it (which isn t even a close number, by the way). Now take those 150 homes and multiply that by 2,257. The total is 338,550, meaning it will take approximately $350,000 to supply these homes with only 7% of the water that they ... Get more on HelpWriting.net ...\n\n4.

Management must always be motivating the team because of the highly stressful environment. Motivation comes in the form of verbal praise to monetary incentives at the end of every month. This is a gear that must be in constant motion to make the employees happy and efficient. The final principle is controlling. This is the management function of monitoring performance and making the necessary changes (Bateman, 2007). Keeping an eye on things is the way to be absolutely certain that everything is going according to plan. Problems will arise but this is why the plan executed in the beginning will help to create solutions. Bank of America, being so large, is monitored all the time.

In my opinion, I believe that kids should get an allowance for good behavior and doing chores. I believe this because your kid can get a reward, learn to have good behavior, and your parents mostly likely comes home from a hard day of work and needs help cleaning the house. Getting an allowance for doing good rewards your kid a lot in his/hers future. It also definitely helps with future behaviors. Kids know if they are doing really good for doing chores, they most likely get a reward. It teaches them to work hard and then they get an allowance. That can help for jobs and other opportunities.

Freedom is Slavery. Ignorance is strength. In George Orwell s 1984, a light is shining on the concept of a negative utopia, or dystopia caused by totalitarianism. Totalitarianism is, a form of government in which political authority exercises absolute and centralized control over all aspects of life and any opposing political and/or cultural expressions are suppressed. Having lived in a time of totalitarianism regime, Orwell had a firsthand account of its horrific lengths and negative affects. Within 1984, Orwell derives aspects of the actual government of his time to create, The Party , Big Brother , and the Thought Police . Using these fictional recreations of reality, Orwell s 1984 ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... Stalin use this concept in the 30 s for the same reason as the party; to make the people believe the government was legitimate. Another aspect of Orwell s prophetic novel is the thought of technology. During the time that Orwell wrote 1984, the radio was more comment than the television and computers had not even been considered. Nonetheless, Orwell found a way to include these things in his story. The tele screen could be related to the modern TV. Also, in the book, the control of machinery and sources of information are controlled by computers. Orwell uses technology in this book to show that these things that were made to help man, can lead to the corruptness and downfall of society, much like what is being seen today. Living in a world that continues to make advancements technologically and politically, a book written more than 50 years ago still warns the world of what could happen if government becomes too forceful. Because of George Orwell s strong hatred for totalitarianism and its life dictating qualities, readers can get a taste of the perfect dystopia . Though the people of today have been warned and are afraid of an all controlling government, they continue to allow the concept of 1984 to become more and more real. If people continue to just watch their governments make decisions and not ask questions, they will fall victim to its power.

The thought process behind the practice of first degree price discrimination is that the firm has enough accurate information about the consumer, and that products can be sold each time for the maximum amount that the consumer is willing to pay. The two more common examples of first degree price discrimination is called price skimming and all or none offers . Skimming refers to the demand function, as firms take the top of the demand of a given good to maximize profits on the sale. This, of course, requires that the firm know the actual demand for the good that it produces. The firm must divide its customers into distinct, independent groups based upon their respective demands for the good. The firm wants to first sell to the group who will pay the highest price for the new product. It then reduces the cost slightly and sells to another group with only a slightly less demand for the good. This process is copied on numerous occasions until the marginal revenue drops to equal marginal cost. While this example may seem similar to other examples of price discrimination, you should remember that the most significant difference here is that there are a virtually limitless number of possible prices that, if charges ...

Identity, and the process by which one s identity may be formed, is multi faceted. On occasion, this can be simple. For instance, Vladek is Jewish, and identifies as such, even admittedly conforming to a good deal of the stereotypes, such as miserliness, and is descended from a long line of Jews However, even for someone like Vladek, who never for a moment questions his identity in point of fact, the matter of identity can become complicated; there are times when he has to disguise himself as a gentile Pole to avoid racist persecution and for reasons of survival, making the transformation from mouse to pig in the context of the graphic memoir. During this time of disguise, the transformation is visually rendered by Spiegelman by having Vladek put on a pig mask; Spiegelman, as an artist, takes full advantage of his character s animalization: species are easily identified, and subsequently categorized by the human mind quickly. For others, however, their identities are not so fixed, not so firmly established. The author s wife, Francois, is French, but ... Get more on HelpWriting.net ...\n\n42. Sport And The American Dream Analysis Tennis, A Step to a Women s Athleticism Awareness Tennis is a sport that might not catch people s interest on TV, but it surely is a sport that people admire and love to play. The one reason why it might be very admirable would probably be because it is not inclusive to any race, ethnicity, or culture. If you look at the tennis players that are involved in the game, their backgrounds are not very similar to other tennis players. Unlike basketball, you would notice that it is dominated by African Americans. Despite that, one of the negative attributes of tennis is the dominance of males. Tennis is a game that is open to everyone; however, there are gender differences that affect the women players. Women don t get paid the same as men, men s finals attracts more attention and is awaited for more than women s finals, also the men tend to get more opportunities outside of tennis (commercials).

Feder had noticed that during the commentary the male skater would be judged on purely his skills, while the female would be judged according to how feminine her body looks. Relating this back to tennis, Serena Williams is a very famous and strong tennis player. However, she is seen as masculine because of her body structure. Williams has a large muscle mass and according to Elizabeth Newman in the article, No room for body image criticism in Serena Williams Grand Slam chase, she states that Williams always gets criticized for her body and how it doesn t fit into society s idea of femininity and beauty.

The lead female role, Ann Darrow, was played by Fay Wray, and the lead male role, Carl Denham, by Robert Armstrong. At the time, this movie was classified into three genres: adventure, fantasy, and horror. Most importantly, the composer of this film was Max Steiner. 72 years after the original King Kong was released, a new, three hour long version was released on December 14, 2005. Although the story line remained the same, there were some notable differences between the two. First of all, Ann Darrow was played by Naomi Watts, and Carl Denham by Jack Black. Second, the way Peter Jackson directed this film turned it into an adventure movie with more action and drama than the 1933 version. One of the most prominent differences that will be discussed in this essay, is the difference in music selections due to the different composer, James Newton Howard. The 1933 and 2005 versions of King Kong are constructed in slightly different ways. The 1933 version focuses mainly on the procession of Ann to the sacrifice altar. There are multiple panoramic shots of the large group of natives surrounding her and cheering on the sacrifice. Throughout this scene, it almost appears as though the same or very similar clips of these natives surrounding her are used in multiple places. The sacrifice itself is also emphasized in this version and turned into a big deal. One ... Get more on HelpWriting.net ...\n\n44.

Andrei eventually got out of being a serf, gained a high education, and went to university to become a lawyer. What made this unusual is his background, he was a serf, but now a highly intelligent person, not slave. Shortly after, there was an altercation between him and a professor, where the professor misunderstood Andrei and forcefully took him out of his class. This caused an outrage, because of the teacher s origin. They did not speak fluent Russian, and the students found this altercation to be absurd. This caused many things to happen at the school, and Andrei to be expelled where he then went to work on a farm. His story stops here, while Sonia s begins. Sonia did not want to become some sexist job that women were usually sent to, or just a plain housewife! She decided to pursue a nursing job, but while in her university got involved in an underground organization, the Chaikovsky Circle. This wasn t your run of the mill terrorist group; this organization was made to use peaceful ways to get their ideas across. One of those ways was to dress up like serfs and go on strike from their university. They went to heavily populated areas consisting of mostly serfs, and doing their work alongside them. They hoped to convince serfs that Alexander II isn t the god they think he is, but a terrible man. These failed attempts are what caused terroristic actions, explained in the next chapter, The Turn Toward Terrorism . This chapter explains the literal turn toward terrorism these small organizations became. After Alexander II s constant arrests, and the publication of the book What Is to Be Done? (A book that challenges all of Old Russia s ways) written by N. G. Chernyshevsky, caused even more followers and even more outrage.

This will ensure safety in case of any complications with the reactor. With regards to the advantages of nuclear fusion, the raw fuel or energy itself is readily available. The elements, deuterium and tritium are basically unlimited. Fusion will not emit toxic gas and other deadly compounds into the atmosphere, unlike burning coal. Fusion will only release helium gas, which will not have any effects on the atmosphere, as helium is very abundant on the atmosphere, therefore it will not contribute to global warming. With regards to disadvantages, the overall cost of constructing a facility which will harness the energy of nuclear fusion is extremely high. ITER s project costs 10 billion Euros. With nuclear fission, the advantages are that, it is inexpensive to create and harness the energy. Fission also does not create greenhouse gas. The disadvantages are that, wastes are created from fission which can directly harm life and there is a risk of a nuclear meltdown which will release electromagnetic radiation to its surroundings. With chemical changes such as fossil fuel burnings, the advantages are that a lot of energy is released during the combustion reaction and extremely cheap. Disadvantages are that, fossil fuels release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which contributes to global warming. From the stated advantages and disadvantages, nuclear fusion seems to the cleanest source of energy. It does ... Get more on HelpWriting.net ...\n\n46.

It was first discovered more than seventy years ago it was first found in 1940 by an English surgeon named Joseph Lister There are a number of genus species related to Listeria, but firstly I will discuss Listeria Monocytogenes, it can be is classed as an opportunistic pathogen ( an organism that is defined as a commensal bacteria which usually do not harm the host but can result in illness if the host is under stress or is suppressed), this infection is mainly related with dairy products such as cheese raw milk etc., meats and ready handled foods (Hill, C. et al 2009). Listeria Monocytogenes can be widely found in nature and can be predominantly quarantined from a variety of environmental surroundings such as soil, Air, Water, faecal samples of both animals and humans. The most common mode of entry of this infection is by direct digestion of uncooked food products however the infection can also be contacted directly from animal humans animals can carry the bacteria without showing any symptoms of illness. The ideal food conditions where the bacteria can thrive is foods which a long shelf life and can be refrigerated as the bacteria can withstand fridge temperatures also foods that may not need to be cooked example includes salads, coleslaw, unpasteurised milk etc. Listeria Monocytogenes can form two forms of known diseases these are called both Invasive and Non Invasive Listeriosis.

Why Is In Cold Blood Be Banned Violence in mass media has been constantly discussed in the past twenty years as a reasoning for teenage violence against others, between video games such as Doom and Call of Duty , movies such as Fight Club , Scream , American Psycho , and Natural Born Killers and social media dehumanizing acts of violence. Many parents have labeled anything that is not family friendly as a root cause of criminal behavior. Others also blame the amount of violence in media now as unhealthy to young people, solely because many don t know the line of what is real and not real. In Cold Blood , by Truman Capote, details the gruesome murder of the Clutter family in rural Holcolb, Kansas in November of 1959 committed by two men; Dick Hickock and Perry Smith. In Capote s novel, he describes the motives of the killers and their backstory in order to help humanize them. Some may say that because of both the violence and the humanization of the killers, the book should be banned. However, banning the book would be censoring something important for youth to learn from. This novel should be implemented in schools to let younger generations be aware of the real world, and to be aware that not everything is picture perfect in the world.

Gregor Mendel s Fruit Flies Essay Gregor Mendel s Fruit Flies Introduction From simple heredity experiments with garden peas, to cloning sheep, the field of genetics has come a long way. Now we are closer to mapping out the human genetic map due to advances in technology, and years and years of research. Perhaps the most influential and groundbreaking scientist, Gregor Mendel, he was responsible to provide a path to where genetics is now today with his experiments of garden peas. In lab, fruit flies were crossed to observe inheritance patterns in their offspring. The motivation for this was to further understand how genes and characteristics are inherited. To use fruit flies would be much more effective and easier because of a couple of reasons. The ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... The F1?s were then observed and then crossed to form the F2 generation. Genetic Hypothesis The F1 generation hypothesis is that with the Line A, B cross, the F1 for our group will be expected to be heterozygous dominant (VvBb) at both loci. This is because of the cross of Line A, which was consisting of Males with the genotype of vvBB, and of line B that were females with the genotype VVbb. As far as the F2 generations go, the phenotypes are expected to have a 9:3:3:1 ratio. There should be 9 brown, normal fruit flies, and 3 of each the brown, vestigial fly and the white, long fly. Finally, there is expected to be only one white, vestigial fly that possesses homozygous recessive alleles in both loci. There is a chance that there may be different outcomes to the F2 generation due to the possibility that the Line A and the Line B generation were not all homozygous dominant in wing type for females and eye color in males. Such a genotype in the males, vvBb, and such in females, Vvbb, may lead to a different ratio in the F2 offspring. Methods In the lab section, we observed two vials containing the Line A and B species. In order for us to further examine the flies, we ?knocked out? the flies with a chemical anesthetic known as Fly Nap. Placing the wand covered in Fly Nap into the vial, we ?knocked out? the flies. We then spilled the flies onto a piece of paper and examined them under a light microscope. What were examined were ... Get more on HelpWriting.net ..."
