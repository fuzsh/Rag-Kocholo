        "text": "Thilo Latrell Widder\n\nEver since sending one hilariously hopeful Twitter DM in June of 2022, Thilo has been covering the Timberwolves for Canis Hoopus. As the first ever person to graduate Bennington College in sports journalism (fact-checked) AND the first ever person named after Latrell Sprewell to work for Canis (fact-check pending), Thilo tries to leverage his stubborn passion to create articles that feel genuine in voice and human in tone. He loves to re-ignite those conversations you used to have at the lunch table in your highschool cafeteria -- you know the ones -- while injecting overlaps with his passions in film, food, music, social activism, and whatever new hyper-fixation he has going on. He currently covers Canis' weekly NBA recap \"In the Loopus\" as well as other editorial pursuits. Thilo excels at producing extremely niche articles with intros featuring wide reaching anecdotes ranging from Cronenberg poetry to RZA's discography, as well as custom graphics that sometimes hurt to look at for too long. He's looking forward to covering the Lynx in the new league year. You can find him on Twitter at @125St1Train."
