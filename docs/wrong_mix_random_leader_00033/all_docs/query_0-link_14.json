The Great Depression Movie Vs Book In my sixteen years of living, throughout my life, I ve mostly been told that that the book is better than the movie. From Harry Potter to the Hunger Games, most readers tend to feel that the book is able to capture more. More description, more development, more dynamic, they would say, just to name a few. Now I d never really fallen into that presumption, as I prefer to give each book and movie separate chances and never truly compare the two. Until I read It s Kind of a Funny Story. Modeled after his own experiences, the late Ned Vizzini wrote about a boy name Craig Gilner and his struggles with depression. Fortunately, this wasn t a foreign topic to me. Through reading this book I was able to compare his depression to the depression experienced throughout The Yellow Wallpaper (Charlotte Perkins Gilman). Having this previous experience, on depression not only helped me better dissect and understand Craig, as a character, but also modernized the ideas discussed in The Yellow Wallpaper. ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... Personally, I found Vizzini s character development to be extremely effective. By including flashbacks of Craig s life, I was able to see how different events led up to the current day Craig. Doing this, made me understand, why Craig felt certain emotions stronger than others. For example, throughout the novel Craig was often stressed with typical teenage issues such as schoolwork and maintaining friendships. He never truly had an outlet for his emotions. Through flashbacks, and explaining his childhood love for mapmaking, Vizzini was able to create a critical literary effect, as Craig s childhood passions ultimately proved as his ...

The Theory Of Rehabilitating Fender Shifted Into Focus More As the range of fields that study crime grew, the theory of rehabilitating the offender shifted into focus more prevalently. The aim of the theory of rehabilitation is to reform the offender, that is to say, rid them of their criminal ways. Cohen sees this task to be outside the capabilities of the justice system. The myriad of components that lead an individual to crime whether they are economic, psychological or otherwise, is too complex for the justice system to be able to grok fully. Cohen equates this project to the reconstructing of society as a whole. In order to truly be able to rehabilitate a single offender society itself might have to adjust in order to prevent this particular criminal from reoffending. Critics of the ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... Rehabilitation is arguably the most paternalistic of the three approaches. The state is declaring the self that the criminal has created is unfit for society and thus he needs to change. Humans have rights as autonomous agents to self rule, that is determine the person they wish to be. When the state endeavors to rehabilitate, it is attempting to mold the individual to conform to the general morals of society. The three philosophical approaches to the justification of punishment have each shown to have merit as well as flaws. I will now move on to providing my proposed resolution to the issue of punishment. The overarching theme amongst these three theories is that each attempts to safeguard society. Retribution attempts to achieve this by appealing to the general call of the community as a whole. This is to say that it expresses in the most natural way the community s condemnation for the crime committed. Cohen outlines that pure retribution, an eye for an eye literally, would not be a just practice due to it neglecting to acknowledge the two important facets of punishment, deterrence and rehabilitation. If a driver was driving negligently and crashed his vehicle inadvertently killing a pedestrian, it would do no good to have this driver crushed by a vehicle as well.

Moreover, researcher Torgeson and a group of his colleagues, conducted extensive research in 2007 regarding academic literacy for adolescents. Their findings pinpointed six critical factors underlying proficient reading performance at the late elementary, middle and high school levels. They are: Fluency of text reading Vocabulary or the breadth and depth of knowledge about the meaning of words; Active and flexible use of reading strategies to enhance comprehension; Background, or prior knowledge related to the content of the text being read; Higher level reasoning and thinking skills; and Motivation and engagement for understanding and learning from text (2007, p. 5). With these critical factors identified, I chose to focus on four components that result in barriers to comprehension and literacy when not in place. Those include insufficient vocabulary, background knowledge and motivation and engagement. Addressing the barriers with research based strategies is the way to improve literacy. According to the U.S. Department of Education, Many content area teachers do not realize the importance of teaching the reading strategies and thinking processes that skilled readers use in different academic disciplines and do not recognize the beneficial effects of such instruction on students ability to engage with their learning (U.S. Department of Education, n.d.).

Red squirrels are an important part of the ecosystem in which the oak lives. They are important because they eat off the oak trees.

The Effects Of Exercise On Body s Physical Condition Exercise has been proven to have a positive effect on our body s physical condition, but what about our minds? Mental exercise, too, is influential on our bodies to decrease our stress levels. Though, we know how important it is to do physical exercise and manage stress, yet still 42% of adults say they are not doing enough to manage their stress mentally (http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2014/highlights.aspx ). Research has shown stress puts detrimental effects to our bodies and well being. The simple motivation to exercise, especially under stress, can be difficult, but the ignorance to not exercise, can ultimately cost you your life. How does stress affect us? Stress negatively affects our bodies in a variety ways. Stress is a response our bodies have to a stimulant. When you watch a scary movie, the reaction to the startling moment is an act of stress. Though, stress is a normal bodily response, and Americans expect to have a little stress in their lives, according to APA (define). Though, too much stress is not good for the human body. When stress is experienced, a hormone called cortisol is released in the body. Cortisol is a stress hormone that has a great impact on physical and mental health.

For an officer to make an arrest, he or she must have more than a mere hunch yet less than actual knowledge that the arrestee committed the crime (Peak, 2009). Law enforcement officers need to make certain they understand probable cause is different than reasonable suspicion. A good example of a reasonable suspicion encounter is Terry V. Ohio, where an officer who had 39 years of experience in law enforcement observed two men standing on a street corner. It appeared based on the officer s experience the two men were casing a store because they both were walking up and down the street peering into the store windows, and then they would return to the corner to conference. While the officer ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... The officer did have reasonable suspicion to make contact and after locating the weapons he had his probable cause. There are four situations that Probable Cause is used; involving arrests with a warrant, arrests without a warrant, searched of items with a warrant, and searches of items without a warrant (V., D. C., Walker, J. T., 2015). Most of my encounters with individuals occurs on traffic stops; which require probable cause to stop them. My probable cause could be speeding, reckless driving or any traffic violation in the traffic law manual. Once probable cause is established then contact is made with the driver. If there is reason to believe that there is more than a traffic violation, such as an officer smelling marijuana inside the vehicle, then he or she can now have access into the vehicle. My probable cause to get into the vehicle is based on my training and experience that there was or is illegal narcotics inside the vehicle. If there is no probable cause to get into the vehicle and an officer feels there is more to the traffic stop than speeding, then the officer needs to build his reasonable suspicion to figure out what the driver is up to.

Beer Simulation Root Beer Simulation At the outset, I have to acknowledge that I had a problem with this simulation. Initially, in my first two orders, I confused the backlog and inventory sections, so that I believed I had a significant surplus in inventory. Therefore, rather than minimizing the bullwhip of supply and demand, I exacerbated the problem by limiting my supply well below the number of orders coming in, much less below what I could fill with the backlog and incoming orders. This error on my part certainly led to increasing instability, not only in my own incoming orders, but also in the entire supply chain. The simulation also kept auto filling my initial order, which was only 10,000 cases, despite me ordering a significantly larger number of cases. I could not get the simulation to operate properly and allow me to place a larger order. It kept auto ordering the 10,000 cases. I could not get it to place an order other than 10,000 cases. Because of this glitch, I continued to increase my backlog. I simply could not order more than 10,000 cases. I address this issue because the glitch certainly impacted my opinion of the computer simulation as a means of learning. In this scenario, the initial computer simulation was absolutely worthless as a learning tool. I made an error in my first order, but I do not think that error was meaningful. Instead, it appears that whatever number of cases I placed in my initial order would be the number of cases ordered over the next several ... Get more on HelpWriting.net ...\n\n14.

When I saw the way the Mexicans were behaving, I realized that it was connected to the idea of power that we have discussed in class. As the teacher said in class, Power is the ability or potential to bring about change (Storey). I believe that this idea applies to the Mexicans that I observed because they feel incapable to bring change in America, so they act a little shy in public spaces. In my opinion, if the American society treated all the people in the same way, avoiding the creation of stereotypes about people from different races, those people would behave in a different way. Because race is very important in America, people that is not white feel pressured to behave in certain way that will not bother people with power, just like how the Mexican that I say acted like. On the other hand, I have also made a connection to the concept that racism is socially constructed, when people started to look at me in different way because I was sitting with a white girl. This made me realize that because America does not feel comfortable about interracial relationship, they promote racism, and as consequence, Americans do not know how to act in situations like this, so they see it as strange or uncommon just like when they saw me with a white girl.

But then when George and Lydia venture into the nursery and nearly get mauled by what s supposed to be a hologram of a lion, tensions rise between Lydia and George. Lydia wants to shut down the nursery and the house due to her paranoia, while George wants to keep it open because he is almost 100 percent positive that his design is foolproof and no harm would come from it. Later, when the kids come home for dinner, they give off a very eerie vibe; they come in with pinched pink cheeks, bright blue eyes and are holding hands (similar to the horror movie, The Shining). Then the two children act as if they do not even know what Africa is when George brings it up talking about the nursery. Afterward, when Lydia and George are in bed they both have a strange feeling that Wendy changed the nursery and that Peter completely hacked into the system.

Current Policy Analysis and Evaluation: When evaluating our current system, the difficulty to isolate effects of the GST from the other changes in tax in ANTS shouldn t be underestimated (Valadkhani 2005). Former treasurer, Peter Costello (2010), points out how the introduction of the GST was used to replace existing wholesale sales taxes, and coincided with the removal of other inefficient state taxes and duties, and a personal income tax rate cut. To address concerns for lower income earners, the government simplified the family benefits program and provided private health insurance premium rebates (Costello 2010). Although perceived as a regressive tax, the combination of the GST (and compensation for equity) and progressive income tax, resulted in a relatively balanced redistribution system for the period between 1994 2002 (Warren, Harding Lloyd 2005 cited in Nguyen 2016, p. 108). GST tends to considered by economists as one of the more efficient revenue raising tax (Nguyen 2016). Internationally and domestically, there is a push by economists to shift the tax mix towards consumption taxes away from the more distortive income and company tax (CPAAustralia 2015; OECD 2014).

Common Sense Explanations And The Explanations Of C.... In this essay I will be exploring the differences between common sense explanations and the explanations of C. Wright Mills theory of The Sociological Imagination. Common sense is based on people s personal experiences and their opinions, very often constructed from social norms and generalised views. Whereas, the Sociological Imagination thought up by sociologist C. Wright Mills (1959) is based on the ideas of thinking critically and skeptically, in order to think sociologically. He wrote that in order to do this, we have to understand and grasp the link between current society and history, personal troubles and public issues. There are three main parts to Sociological Imagination: social structure, biography and history. In this essay I will set forth the ways in which each of these approaches would explain the topic of sexuality. I consider sexuality to be an umbrella term for various features, including sexual orientation, sexual activity, masculinity/femininity and gender roles. Each of which will be looked at in this essay in order to explore the topic of sexuality in relation to common sense and the Sociological Imagination. Sexual orientation is commonly viewed as the term to describe an individual s attraction for others; who they want to have sex with. This sexual attraction is what s commonly considered to be the representative of their sexuality. The common sense approach to sexual orientation is well educated on heterosexuality and the LGBT community. LGBT ... Get more on HelpWriting.net ...\n\n21.

Vegetation in the area composes a Boreal forest, and includes both coniferous and mixed wood forests. Conifer tree species include white and black spruce, balsam, jack pine fir, eastern white cedar, and tamarack, while the deciduous (hardwood) species are mainly white birch and poplar (https://www.ontario.ca/page/forest regions). Preliminary access can be made from the town of Cartier (population ~300 people) via HWY 144, from which the Fox Lake road and the Old Cartier Hwy provide access to within 5 km of the center of claim area. From the Old Cartier Hwy, forest and lake access roads provide light vehicle access to the center and southern parts of the property.

For example, sometimes the placebo effect can impact the speed at which an individual s cancer is accelerating. The placebo effect can alter the way an individual thinks by making them believe that a treatment is actually a drug. However, instead, the pill actually given to them is a sugar pill or a pill that is unrelated to their treatment. Therefore, the placebo effect is often effective because the individual blindly believes that this new drug will work and cure them.[6] According to the The National Cancer Institute 1 in 3 people will actually experience the placebo effect. On the other hand, the placebo effect can also have a negative impact by blindly convincing the individual that the pill consumed will result in undesirable side effects: nausea, headaches, anxiety, etc. In fact, scientific evidence suggests that the placebo effect effectiveness is partly due to the release of endorphins in the brain.

Mean Girls Is A Teen Comedy Film Deciding what is most important in life is often a struggle, especially during high school. Mean Girls is a teen comedy film loosely based on the self help book titled Queen Bees and Wannabes. The main character is a high school student named Cady that just moved from Africa and has been homeschooled her whole life. The American culture and society she is introduced to is embodied by the Plastics, who are the most popular girls at North Shore High: Regina, Gretchen, and Karen. The pressure put on Cady by society causes her to struggle to decide what her priorities should be. Mean Girls criticizes the traditional notions of femininity that are expected of women, as they are not required for them to be successful and accomplished. Consider the scene when Cady first goes to Regina s house, closer to the beginning of the movie. During this scene, the Plastics collectively walk up to a mirror and start stating what they dislike about their bodies. The fact that the Plastics, who are supposed to be the most popular and attractive characters in the film, are pointing out flaws on themselves induces feelings of superiority, because even they aren t perfect. The superiority theory as described by Rappoport suggests that this is humorous because feeling superior to someone, even subconsciously, causes pleasure and laughter.

The Role Of Blindness In Oedipus The King The word blindness can be used thematically and literally; thematically being someone can be ignorant or oblivious to see the truth or world around them, and in a literal sense it means that a person is physically blind. In Oedipus the King by Sophocles the role of blindness literally and thematically is used to show how the character Oedipus is oblivious to see the truth in his life is like Donald Trump, America s forty fifth president, on his views of climate change. Donald Trump is blinded by the fact that climate change is a real problem and in his mind the crazy weather is just the weather itself acting up. The author, Sophocles, of the play Oedipus the King, portrays the word blindness in two ironic ways. Though before the reader learns about this they must understand the purpose of why Sophocles used blindness , the author is trying to teach his audience to see clearly more around them, rather than being ignorant around the world that is around them. Oedipus, the main focus of the play, is seen blind in an important part of the play, when his wife, Jocasta, or later to be found out as his mom, finds out that the person she married is her son, and that she had, had children with him, so in the end she hangs herself, his wife was blind at the start just like her son, but now she sees that the fate of Oedipus was to come true.

The people of ancient Greece would look up to various gods, depending on what they were seeking. Apollo s name translates to strength , as he displayed this trait throughout his lifetime and had to be emotionally and physically stronger at times for the people of Ancient Greece. Apollo was a man of trust who excelled and supported all of the fine arts of the Greek civilization such as music, art, and poetry (God Apollo). One of the most underestimated traits of Apollo was his healing powers, in which he helped out many Greeks in desperate times, like the Trojan War (Cartwright). The Greek God Apollo was the most influential among Greek people because of his recognition for music, the truth, and healing powers. Apollo was born on the Greek island of Delios, from his parents Zeus and Leto (Regula). Zeus was the god of the Olympians who also controlled lightning and thunder, and Leto was the goddess of motherhood (Atsma).

The concept of civil culture is one often glorified within society, yet its power depends wholly on the ethical nature of those who uphold it. The novels, Lord of The Flies by William Golding and The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, demonstrate this prospect as through the narrative techniques of characterisation, plot, setting and style, they exemplify the moral decline of man under pressure to survive, ultimately resulting in savagery. Characterisation plays a major role in both texts as each character serves as a representation humanity and the faults within it. Throughout Lord of the Flies there is a developing inequality among the characters as social order is established based on the strength and ability of each. Consequently the weakest of those characters are placed at the mercy of the strongest, in essence giving them the power that motivates their transformation from well mannered British boys to unrestrained savages. Likewise inequality is demonstrated to the same extent within the Hunger Games as the weaker, less experienced tributes are hunted by the Careers , a pack of brutal children who become natural and effective killers.

Resource partitioning occurs amongst animals that share the same resources, such as food and space (Shoener 1974), and allows for their coexistence (May 1973). The different utilization of spatial, temporal, and trophic niches between sympatric species allows for their partitioning of resources (Jácomo et al. 2004). Difference in body mass is one of the factors that contribute to the coexistence of species in that different sized animals will generally eat different sized food items, therefore utilizing different resources and reducing competition (Wilson 1975; Jácomo et al. 2004). In the case of predatory carnivores, as predator body mass increases, the size of their prey increases (Gittleman 1985; Vézina 1985). Differences in body ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... The diets of the remaining mesocarnivores are relatively similar in that they all primarily prey on small to medium sized lagomorphs and rodents, with fishers having an affinity for porcupines. The remainder of the mesocarnivore diet consists of reptiles, birds, carrion, and with the exception of bobcats, fruit and insects (Cavallini et al. 2009). In this study, the diets of these carnivores in Keweenaw County will be analyzed to determine prey partitioning through scat analyses and the use of scent stations. Specifically, the hypotheses tested will be that black bears will consume primarily plant material, gray wolves will feed primarily on large ungulates, and amongst the mesocarnivores, predator body mass will correlate with prey size. In particular, the larger coyotes and bobcats will feed primarily on medium sized mammalian prey, such as snowshoe hares and cottontail rabbits, and the smaller red foxes, fishers, and American martens will feed primarily on smaller prey, such as voles, mice, and squirrels, along with porcupines in the fisher diet.

Furthermore, if debates over political or other issues begin to take a life of their own, they are commonly silenced by Chinese authorities.12 The Chinese authorities only permit these monitored bulletin boards both for their own benefit and because they recognize that there must be outlets for the average person to express their dissatisfaction with the government.13 Allowing the citizens to speak their mind functions to lessen the political tension, by acting as a release for their discontentment.

Analysis Of Getting Back To The Wrong Nature By William... Tai Beiserman Professor Nachumi ENGL 1100 26 April 2015 Blake s use of nature through Songs of Innocence and Songs of Experience William Bill Cronon, an environmental historian and vice Chair of The Wilderness Society, believes that because society differ its self from the nature, it makes the nature to be seen as wild, remote, and inaccessible. In his essay The Trouble with Wilderness; or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature , published in 1995 by the New York Times and in Uncommon Ground: Toward Reinventing Nature, Cronon traced the idea of wilderness throughout American history. Cronon presents the potential danger in society s traditional concept of wilderness. He points out how society detached itself from nature simply by idealizing it and thinking of it as something distant and remote. Approaching the concept of nature in this way leads to an ultimate separation of us, as members of society, from what we could consider to be our true home. As a result of that, the nature is seen as wild, remote and inaccessible. Although Cronon might be right to some extent, that is not always the case. Songs of Innocence and Songs of Experience were written by William Blake and published together in 1798. In Songs of Innocence and Songs of Experience the nature is a key feature; in some poems the nature seems to be close, and sometimes it is more remote.
