        "text": "Introduction\n\nWhen Rudy Gobert was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves, many analysts believed that the Minnesota Timberwolves would be a top team in the Western Conference. However, this team is currently tenth in the Western Conference, and now Karl-Anthony Towns may be out for up to two months due to a calf strain. I also am not one to speculate in negativity, but the way KAT went down a couple of games ago reminded me of how Kevin Durant went down in 2019, before he came back and tore his achilles. Today I decided to talk about some of the reasons why I think the Minnesota Timberwolves are not working, and what they could do try and fix them\n\nThe Paint is Clogged\n\nA little less than a month ago (November 2nd to be exact), Anthony Edwards mentioned in a post game interview that he had not gotten one dunk yet during the season. Anthony Edwards last year emerged along with Ja Morant as one of the most exciting new generation players of the league, with his insanely fast handles, jumpshot, and explosiveness in the paint. His shot selection did hinder him last season (and it still does), but he showed some amazing upside to his future despite the Timberwolves getting bounced in the first round. This season however, many people feel he has regressed heavily, but that’s not necessarily his fault. A lot of Edward’s game relied on him getting points in the paint, but thanks to having both Karl-Anthony Towns and Rudy Gobert in the paint, Edwards has not found a way to be able to do that. Minnesota’s entire game plan was to have KAT and Gobert dominate in the paint while Russell and Edwards along with the bench pick teams apart from the outside, but the issue is, players like Russell and Edwarss get their game going early by getting those easy shots in the paint. This was not an issue last year because this team did not have Rudy Gobert, and Karl-Anthony Towns would unfortunately prefer to sometimes play like a shooting guard on the perimeter instead of being a center. Last season Anthony Edwards was able to get into the paint unchallenged, but now Anthony Edwards is getting challenged from both the defense and his offense. This in turn forces ANT to become a much more perimeter driven player, which is fine, but ANT will not reach his full potential as is if he is forced to change his entire game up. The best solution to this to me seems to be doing something similar to Russell Westbrook and the Los Angeles Lakers, where you have either KAT or Gobert come off the bench with the second unit. This would not only allow Edwards to get a much better look at the paint, but allow both KAT and Gobert to dominate the game separately, instead of trying to force both of them to be forced in the paint simultaneously. After all, there is only so much ball that can go around between the stars in Minnesota.\n\nRudy Gobert is a Defensive Liability\n\nI think it is safe to say that the Utah Jazz absolutely fleeced the Minnesota Timberwolves with the Rudy Gobert trade. The truth is, Rudy Gobert and Karl-Anthony Towns cannot both be dominant bigs with both of them in the lineup, but that is not even my main concern about Rudy Gobert. My main concern is Rudy Gobert’s defense. While Rudy Gobert is a three time DPOY, Rudy is a huge liability for the Timberwolves once he gets outside the paint. In his time in Utah, teams such as Golden State abused Gobert in the pick and roll, and Gobert gave players like Stephen Curry some of the easiest playoff baskets of his career. Teams like the Utah Jazz, Golden State Warriors, and Phoenix Suns so far this season have been able to exploit Gobert in the pick and roll, and completely dominate the Timberwolves from outside. As I mentioned before, Gobert also struggles to create by himself with KAT in the same lineup as him, and the problem is, KAT is going to be playing with him 9 out of 10 times during a game. Gobert has had a couple of productive games these last few days, but keep in mind that those games came after Karl Anthony-Towns’s unfortunate calf strain. I expect Gobert to play some good basketball with KAT out for a few weeks, but unless Gobert learns how to not be as much of a liability defensively (really just learning how to stop the switch), teams will continue to use Gobert to hurt this Timberwolves team.\n\nKAT Needs to be a Dog\n\nBetween Rudy Gobert and Karl-Anthony Towns, to me it is safe to say that KAT is the better player between the two. Towns is a slightly less defensive liability, and has a much deeper offensive bag due to his perimeter game. The problem is, Karl has fallen way too much in love with his perimeter game. Ever since he won the Three-Point Competition at the All Star Game, I have seen KAT decide to take a forced three in transition instead of taking it to the point and go in for an easy bucket. I saw this heavily during their season against the Memphis Grizzlies series, where KAT’s confidence in his three point shot cost the Timberwolves multiple double-digit leads, and eventually their season last year. If KAT wants to have a chance to make a real impact on this team, he needs to go back to being a monster in the paint. When KAT dropped 60 points last season, it was not because he was a jump shooter (though he did have 7 threes), but because he was a force in the paint. KAT also had 17 rebounds in that game, and became one of the few players in NBA History to have 60 or more points and 15 or more rebounds. KAT in the past had success by being a dog in the paint, but more recently he had tried to reinvent the wheel of how his position is played. Yes, we have seen other bigs like Embiid, Jokic, and even Giannis expand their perimeter game, but all three of them also take it to the whole every night. People give players like Embiid criticism for attempting so many free throws per game, but that is only because he is trying to score in the paint in almost every possession he has the ball. Towns can still shoot threes, but he has to remember he became a star in this league by keeping most of his game in the paint.\n\nThe Main Man.\n\n(Make ANT the #1 Option)\n\nIn the words of what Devin Booker told the Timberwolves when he played this team “play team basketball.” Outside of this team trying to recreate what the Cleveland Cavaliers currently have (and failing at it), this team is not playing team basketball. On top of that, this team has not decided who is going to run the show in Minnesota. Take a look at the 2020 Boston Celtics for example. That team consisted of Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, and Marcus Smart just to name a few. While on paper this team should have at least gotten to the finals that year, they lost to the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals due to this team being undecided. Tatum and Brown were still unsure about who was going to take more shots each night, and while not having the skill set, it was clear Marcus Smart was the vocal leader of the team. Two years later, the Boston Celtics are currently 18–4, first in the Eastern Conference, and Jayson Tatum is on the top end of the MVP ladder. The thing that changed the most about this team was Jayson Tatum deciding that he was going to be the leader of the Boston Celtics. He still has off nights, but even in his off days, he takes it upon himself to lead the Celtics to victory night in and night out. The Minnesota Timberwolves have still not decided who the star of this team is going to be. Initially I think it was heading towards the direction of Karl-Anthony Towns, but Anthony Edwards had an explosion last season, making him the main topic of discussion when it came to Minnesota basketball. Throw in Rudy Gobert, and you have a team with three stars in this league who all want to be number one. Gobert left Utah because he and Donovan Mitchell would just not work, but he weirdly enough went to a team with two young stars, instead of just one. This team needs to decide who is going to be the number one option for this team, and then decide who their second and third options will be. A combination of Rudy Gobert, Karl-Anthony Towns, and Anthony Edwards could be extremely lethal, but they first need to figure out how to use it.\n\nConclusion"
