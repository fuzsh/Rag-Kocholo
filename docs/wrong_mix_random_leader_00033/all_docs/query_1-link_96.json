        "text": "The Philadelphia 76ers and Minnesota Timberwolves meet Tuesday in summer league NBA action at the Pavilion. Hereâ€™s a Philadelphia 76ers vs Minnesota Timberwolves Prediction. This article will include a Philadelphia 76ers vs Minnesota Timberwolves Pick.\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers Betting Preview\n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers look for a win to get a game above a .500 record in summer league play. The Philadelphia 76ers are averaging 92.2 points on 45 percent shooting and allowing 90 points on 40.2 percent shooting. Ricky Council IV is averaging 19.6 points and 1.6 assists, while Keve Aluma is averaging 19 points and 8 rebounds. Jeff Downtin is the third double-digit scorer and Jared McCain is grabbing 6.5 rebounds. The Philadelphia 76ers are shooting 32.8 percent from beyond the arc and 79.8 percent from the free throw line. The Philadelphia 76ers are allowing 31.1 percent shooting from deep and are grabbing 37 rebounds per game.\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves Betting Preview\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves look for another win to get off to a 3-0 summer league start. The Minnesota Timberwolves are averaging 93 points on 41.3 percent shooting and allowing 84 points on 38.1 percent shooting. Terrence Shannon Jr. is averaging 22 points and 3.5 rebounds, while Daishen Nix is averaging 15 points and 5.5 assists. Nadir Hifi is the third double-digit scorer and Josh Minott is grabbing 10 rebounds. The Minnesota Timberwolves are shooting 25 percent from beyond the arc and 72.5 percent from the free throw line. The Minnesota Timberwolves are allowing 34.7 percent shooting from deep and are grabbing 38.5 rebounds per game.\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers vs Minnesota Timberwolves Prediction\n\nThis game comes down to which Philadelphia 76ers side is going to show up and if they're going to play some of their better players. These bigger lines suggest teams are going to start sitting guys who have shown they're too advanced for the summer league. With all of that said, the Minnesota Timberwolves have looked sharp at both ends of the floor, and they're 2-0 SU through two games. The line is reasonable. I'll ride the hot hand and lay the chalk with the Timberwolves, as they improve to 3-0 SU in summer league play.\n\nThe pick in this article is the opinion of the writer, not a PickDawgz site consensus."
