        "text": "Early life\n\nEdwards was raised by his mother, Chrisha Yvette Edwards, and maternal grandmother, Shirley Edwards. His father, Roger Caruth, was reportedly a gifted basketball player, and he gave Edwards the nickname “Ant Man.” However, Caruth was largely absent from his son’s life. While growing up in Atlanta, Edwards initially was known for his football exploits, especially as a running back. By the time he was 11, there was already a YouTube video of his Pop Warner football highlights. But Edwards gravitated to basketball in middle school. When he was 13 years old, tragedy struck when his mother and grandmother both died from cancer. His elder brother (18) and sister (21) gained custody of Edwards.\n\nEdwards initially attended Therrell High School in Atlanta, where he became one of the top players in the country. During this time he adopted a grueling training regime. He later transferred to Holy Spirit Prep, and he helped the team win a Georgia state championship in 2018. Although he had offers from powerhouse college basketball programs, Edwards chose to play for the University of Georgia, so he could remain near his family. During his first season (2019–20), Edwards led all Division I freshman with a 19.1 points-per-game average, and he won SEC Freshman of the Year honors. However, he also committed 87 turnovers in 32 games and shot just 40 percent from the floor, including a meager 29 percent from three-point range. After the NCAA basketball tournament was canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Edwards announced that he was leaving Georgia for the NBA.\n\nNBA\n\nEntering the 2020 NBA draft, Edwards was considered a wild card. However, he was selected as the number one overall pick by the Minnesota Timberwolves. At the time, ESPN noted on its website, “He has sharp long-range shooting touch, an ability to score off the dribble and a nose for driving to the basket—plenty to overshadow his uneven one-and-done college season.”\n\nIn 2020–21 Edwards averaged 19.3 points per game and was the youngest NBA player to score 150 three-pointers. He finished second in the Rookie of the Year vote to LaMelo Ball. Edwards, who stands 6 feet 4 inches (1.95 meters) tall, continued to improve over the next two seasons, and Minnesota qualified for the playoffs in 2021–22 and 2022–23. However, the team lost in the first round both times.\n\n“He has that It factor.”\n\n—Timberwolves co-owner and former MLB star Alex Rodriguez, 2024\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Minnesota finished the regular season with a record of 56–26, and Edwards was seventh in voting for league MVP. He ramped it up in the playoffs, averaging 31 points and 8 rebounds per game in Minnesota’s first-round sweep of the Phoenix Suns; he scored 40 points in the final game of that series. In the Western Conference semifinals, Edwards averaged nearly 28 points per game, as the Timberwolves defeated the defending champion Denver Nuggets in a thrilling seven-game series. After eliminating the Nuggets, the colorful Edwards made news in the postgame interview with TNT commentator Charles Barkley. When Barkley told Edwards that he had not been to Minnesota in probably 20 years, Edwards replied, “Bring ya ass.” The expression quickly went viral and became a popular slogan in the state."
