        "text": "The title \"Ghostbusters: Afterlife\" was not chosen until the end of filming.[581]\n\nThe first people whom Jason Reitman showed the script to were the surviving members of Harold Ramis's family.[582]\n\nDuring auditions, Mckenna Grace initially played Phoebe more robotic and flat, going off the character side notes, but Jason Reitman asked her to put \"more Mckenna in Phoebe\" so she would be more expressive and have more emotions. They went from there and ended up somewhere along that line in the middle.[583]\n\nIn preparation for her role, Mckenna Grace watched the first two movies and read Violet Stiel's book \"Ghostbuster's Daughter: Life with My Dad, Harold Ramis\".[584]\n\nA skeletal animal ghost seen at Universal Studios Halloween Horror Nights 2019 Orlando was loosely based on some ghost concept art that was not going to be used in the movie.[Note 5]\n\nOther unused ghost concepts include a Dimetrodon ghost, an ornery school teacher, and cosmic terrors inspired by the Lovecraft mythos.[585]\n\nThe Sentinel Terror Dog started out as a different character. Francois Audouy asked Brynn Metheney to design a \"Terror Dog Minotaur.\" She suggested the name \"Sentinel\" based on Dungeons and Dragons. It was a guardian and an \"in-between\" creature.[586][587]\n\nThe first assembly cut of the movie had a run time of two hours and 56 minutes.[588][589][590]\n\nEveryone in the cast got a wrap gift, a custom Ghost Trap that turns on and off and its holder has the actor's name on it.[591]\n\nFor the opening of the movie, Cynthia Millar performed and recorded with the ondes Martenot from Abbey Road Studios in London. She previously performed with the martenot for the first movie.[592]\n\nJason Reitman asked Cynthia Miller what she could do with the ondes Martenot that was never done in the first movie. She went one full octave lower.[593]\n\nEven noise was sampled from the original score's multi-track recording. At a loud enough volume, viewers can hear a noise floor shift.[594]\n\nThe mountain was inspired by Castle Butte, a freestanding mesa in the Big Muddy Badlands of Saskatchewa and a relic from the Ice Age.[595]\n\nA photogrammetry model was done of Castle Butte then the visual effects team scaled it up, modified it, and digitally composited it into shots in the movie.[596]\n\nBob Gunton was the primary actor who portrayed Egon in Ghostbusters: Afterlife.[597]\n\nGreg Schlosser, a stunt driver, portrayed Egon in the opening scene when he drove the truck from the mine to the farm. He wore a sculpt done by Mitch Devane based on approved art done by Arjen Tuiten after Violet Ramis-Stiel visited the shop to look at his concepts.[598]\n\nThe entrance to the Shandor Mining Company was the Dorothy Ferry Bridge on Highway 848 that crosses Red Deer River in Drumheller.\n\nThe back of the Shandor Mining Truck indicates the brand is a GMC Ivanbuilt.\n\nIvanbuilt is a stand-in for Peterbilt.\n\nIvanbuilt refers to Ivan Reitman and \"Built in 1946\" references his birth year.\n\nThe die for the Ivan Reitman easter egg was made at Cornfield Customs then technician Pete Watkins pounded it out using old school techniques.[599]\n\nThere were only three left in existence of the truck bed chosen by Jason Reitman for Egon's Shandor Mining Company truck. The team made a replica based on pictures they could find. [600]\n\nParts of the Shandor truck have panels replicated with \"Oh So Soft Aluminum\" for the stunt. On cue, the technicians would trigger a hidden mechanism wirelessly to suck in the panel at the moment when Zuul is scripted to ram the side of the truck. At the same time, the stunt driver had to trigger the actuator system hidden inside the box on the right side of the truck body then the nitrogen arm under the truck performed the flip. They did light rehearsals to get the timing down but they had only one try to film the scene.[601][602][603][604][605]\n\nThe diner that the truck turns at, Spinners Roller Hop, was a set built in Beiseker, Alberta at the Apple Pie Diner and Gas Station.\n\nThe Farmhouse was built south of Calgary at Range Road 21A & 242 Avenue West, Foothills County, AB T0L 1W0, Canada.\n\nThree of the location scouts independently logged the farmland that would eventually be used for the Farmhouse set.[606]\n\nThe farmland used for the Farmhouse set is mainly for canola crops.[607]\n\nEverything at the Farmhouse was struck down and removed after production and returned to the way it was before production.[608]\n\nProduction designer Francois Audouy studied homes from \"Psycho\" to \"Days of Heaven\" for research in the making of the Farmhouse.[609]\n\nAn earlier concept design of the Farmhouse was more of a contemporary farmhouse.[610]\n\nFor locations like the Farmhouse, Bill Ives used a drone and did a couple of passes around the set location chosen then the images were uploaded into a computer and photogrammetry was done then set design was done in earnest.[611]\n\nThe antennas on top of the Farmhouse is a nod to the equipment on Ecto-1's roof rack.[612]\n\nThe Farmhouse was built from scratch twice, once in location in Calgary, Canada and on a soundstage.[613]\n\nThe production crew scouted dozens of farmhouses and barns in Alberta but they had either one great landscape, barn, or farmhouse and not all three. Eventually, they found a property with a beautiful knoll and great view up onto a ridge.[614]\n\nThe barn was 130 years old when it was found and it belonged to the Gibson family east of where the Farmhouse was built.[615][616]\n\nThe barn was found as is with a collapsed roof. The crew took it apart plank by plank. There was old lead paint peeling off so the team had to add a transparent paint to seal it up. A construction team in hazmat suits logged all the pieces of the barn and rebuilt it on the site chosen for the farmhouse which was a couple hours away. The team also had to add hidden structures to keep the barn struturally sound but still look decrepit.[617][618][619]\n\nThe glass used for the house was antique glass they bought, cut down to size, and laminated for safety.[620]\n\nThe wood used to build the house was brand new but it was theatrically painted to look old. Prefab took place months prior to the first day of filming at the Farmhouse set on location. Treatments were used to make it peel naturally.[621]\n\nThe lever for the Trap Field was moved at the last minute. A post was switched out to make it 4x4.[622]\n\nThe billowing smoke was a practical effect using dry ice.[623]\n\nThe P.K.E. Meter props in Afterlife were worked on by ISS.[624]\n\nThe original P.K.E. Meter props from the 1984 movie were 3-D scanned and the props used in Afterlife were made from those scans.[625]\n\nButtons on the P.K.E. Meter props in Afterlife can control the brightness and dimness of the lights and the animation on the screen.[626][627]\n\nThe arms on the P.K.E. Meter prop with the taser function swing up when the red button on the back is engaged.[628]\n\nZuul attacks Egon in a similar way she attacked Dana Barrett in the first movie with multiple arms popping out of the chair.\n\nArjen Tuiten, Special Make-Up & Live Acton Creature Effects Designer, puppeteered one of the Zuul arms. Tuiten's shop built the arms. There is more footage filmed of Zuul attacking Egon in the chair and is \"quite violent.\"[629]\n\nZuul leaves the Farmhouse in the form of a pink energy wisp like when the ghosts are released from the Containment Unit in the first movie, Chapter 21: Out of Biz.\n\nAt one point, there was a scene involving fliers for a funeral.[630]\n\nThe interior of Callie's apartment was filmed in the Congress Apartments at 725 13th Avenue Southwest, Calgary, AB T2R 0K8, Canada.\n\nOne cut of the movie went from Egon's death straight to Callie, Trevor, and Phoebe arriving at the Farmhouse.[631]\n\nTrevor's T-shirts were made for the movie.[632]\n\nThere is a straightened Slinky on Phoebe's night stand in her apartment bedroom in Chicago, a callback to Egon's line in Ghostbusters II, Chapter 5: Investigating Oscar, about straightening part of one in his childhood.[633]\n\nPhoebe's coveralls were made for the movie.[634]\n\nPhoebe's red shoes are by Billy Footwear.[635]\n\nPhoebe shines her headlight in Callie's face, similar to when Egon did so to Peter in the first movie when they interviewed Dana Barrett.\n\nPhoebe has a World Maker Faire 2012 poster by Molly Crabapple on her wall.\n\nCallie's eviction notice is seen more clearly in Domestic Trailer #1, released on December 9, 2019.\n\nThe name of the apartment is the Anderson East Estates, located on Barneson Street, Chicago, Illinois.\n\nThe name of the landlord is listed as Matthew Cohen.\n\nCallie and her children lived in 2B, it is seen on door eight seconds into Trailer #1.\n\nCallie, Phoebe, and Trevor losing their home and getting wrapped up in a paranormal event mirrors how Peter, Egon, and Ray were fired from Columbia University in the first movie.\n\nThe exteriors of the apartment were filmed at the Anderson Estates at 804 18th Avenue Southwest, Calgary, Alberta 13 T2T 0G8, Canada.\n\nThe first day of filming was at the Anderson Estates. Jason Reitman posted a photo from the first day near 801 18 Ave SW.[636]\n\n\"The Clapping Song (Clap Pat Clap Slap)\" plays at 6:35 during the montage of Callie and her children driving to Summerville.\n\nTrevor's shirt references the car company Chevrolet.\n\nAt the 7 minute mark, Callie drives by a set of buildings. This is the ghost town of Del Bonita, Alberta Canada.\n\nThe giant cowboy figure is a sign for the Bar U Ranch in Longview, Alberta, Canada at the AB-22 (Cowboy Trail) and Township Road 171A intersection.\n\nThe motel scene was filmed at the Badlands Motel at 801 N Dinosaur Trail, Drumheller, AB T0J 0Y1, Canada.\n\nAt the motel, Trevor's shirt is a Vienna Beef Chicago Style Hot Dog T-shirt.\n\nThe look of Summerville was in part inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright's winter home and school Taliesin West and Wright's students settling in the area.[637]\n\nAn intersection in Drumheller with a view of the water tower became an extension of Summerville's Main Street then after turning the corner, the town used was Fort Macleod where the Empress Theatre is located.[638]\n\nDuring the driving montage to Summerville:\n\nThey drive from the south to Drumheller from Highway Number 9 in the Bleriot Ferry area.\n\nThe Summerville Water Tower is the Drumheller Water Tower at 2 St. 2, Drumheller, AB T0J0Y4, Canada.[639] \"Summerville\" was digitally added to existing water tower in Drumheller.[640]\n\nThe words \"Summerville\" only appears on the water tower starting in Trailer #2. In the same trailer, the nearby Village Plaza signage has been digitally erased.\n\nThey drive through Drumheller, down Third Avenue East between First and Center Street\n\nIn background behind Trevor is the Summerville American Legion Post No 426 building.\n\nThe interior of Spinners Roller Hop is from the set at First Avenue and Sixth Street in Beisker, Alberta.[641]\n\nThere is a plate of Timbits in the sheriff's office. Timbits are native to Canada, bite-sized doughnut holes made from leftover doughnut dough.\n\nThe quote of Revelation 6:12 is from the King James Version of The Bible, \"And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood.\"\n\nThe quote is the one used by Ray in the first movie, Chapter 20: Keymaster, when he is talking to Winston in Ecto-1.\n\nThe barley field grown by the crew by the Farmhouse was harvested and sold after principal photography wrapped.[642]\n\nThe license plate of Callie's Subaru Outback is \"48IRG91\" and unscrambles into \"IRG1984\" or Ivan Reitman's Ghostbusters 1984.\n\nThere is a 1958 Cadillac Series 62 4 door hardtop outside the barn.\n\nA stack of books in the living room is a nod to the Symmetrical Stacking found in the New York City Public Library in the first movie, Chapter 3: \"Get Her!\"\n\nThe number sequence Phoebe looks up at when she first enters the Farmhouse is part of the sequence of years seen later in the movie in the mountain Temple of Gozer.\n\n1381\n\n1432\n\n1501\n\n1596\n\n1607\n\n1782\n\n1823\n\nPhoebe finds a small statue of Zuul on the desk.\n\nJanine Melnitz repeats one of her lines from the first movie, \"Can I help you?\" in Chapter 9: The 1st Customer.\n\nJanine's hesitance alludes to the romantic sub-plot between her and Egon in the first movie.\n\n\"Baby It's You\" plays at 11:55 in the scene where the family goes to the Spinners and Trevor sees Lucky Domingo for the first time.\n\n\"All Your Love (I Miss Loving)\" plays at 13:02 when the jukebox plays and Trevor is filling out the job application.\n\nLucky's name was first revealed on Amazon U.K. for the Plasma Series figure pre-order that was accidentally posted around March 28, 2021. It read, \"LUCKY: Lucky works at the local drive-in diner and isn't afraid to stir up a little trouble.\"\n\nNear Lucky is standing near a soda fountain advertising Coca-Cola, a product also in the first movie.\n\nLucky wears a vanity necklace of her name much like Patty Tolan did in the 2016 movie.\n\nDanielle Kennedy was on a vacation in Sun Valley, Idaho when she was called by her manager about a role in a movie called Rust City that involved the Roller Granny character on roller skates. Kennedy couldn't locate any so she donned a pair of ice skates and taped her audition video at an ice rink. She did one take running lines with a child at the rink. The sides given to Kennedy hid the family aspect of the movie. Instead of the \"Dirt Farmer had a family?\" it was \"Dirt Farmer had friends?\"[643][644]\n\nDuring filming of the scene with Roller Granny, Jason Reitman told Danielle Kennedy the line was \"Dirt Family had a family?\"[645]\n\nRoller Granny's \"Nope\" was improvised by Danielle Kennedy for her audition video. Jason Reitman liked at and kept it in the final version of the movie.**During filming of the scene with Roller Granny, Jason Reitman told Danielle Kennedy the line was \"Dirt Family had a family?\"[646]\n\nDanielle Kennedy was on the set for two weeks. The first week was rehearsals then she spent five days on the set during filming.[647][648]\n\nDanielle Kennedy had no idea, even during filming, that the Dirt Farmer was Egon Spengler.[649]\n\nSince the movie was shot out of order, the art department, paint department and the assistant directors had to identify Ecto-1 by four stages: under the tarp, after the tarp is off, after driving through the field, and after being splashed by the hydrant. The Ecto-1 wasn't simply covered in dust for earlier scenes, the crew had to do it in paint so that it stayed on.[650][651]\n\nThree Ecto-1s were used in the movie.[652]\n\nGhostlight Industries, based in Los Angeles, were commissioned to build the three Ecto-1 cars used for Ghostbusters: Afterlife.[653]\n\nGhostlight Industries had less than three months to build the three Ecto-1s.[654]\n\nWhile the two Ecto-1 hero cars were 1959 Cadillac models, the third Ecto-1 that was sliced into sections was a 1961 donated by a Ghostbusters fans.[655]\n\nThe Ecto-1a that Sony had in a storage container was one of the cars used to build Ecto-1 in Ghostbusters: Afterlife.[656]\n\nDuring the testing phase, one of the Ecto-1 cars was driven by the stunt driver in a parking lot. He tried to take it into a sideways skid and the wheels fell off. It was sent back to Los Angeles for an upgraded suspension and Ford Mustang axles.[657][658]\n\nSome of the moldings for the Ecto-1 built for Ghostbusters: Afterlife were recreated with 3D printings or fiber glass parts that were chromed when the original could not be sourced.[659]\n\nThe Ecto-1s in Ghostbusters: Afterlife had suspensions designed and built specifically built for the cars. They had General Motors LS3 crate engines with 550 horsepower.[660]\n\nFor the No-Ghost logo on the Ecto-1s for Ghostbusters: Afterlife, Francois Audouy recreated vinyl replicas of the logo then he integrated specific cracked patterns to simulate aging.[661]\n\nOn the way to summer school, Phoebe plays with a Rubik's cube in the car.\n\nIn one cut, Callie advised Phoebe to start winking so people would know when she was kidding.[662]\n\nThe Summerville Middle School was filmed at the W.G. Murdoch School at 1020 Mountain Avenue, Crossfield, Alberta T0M0S0, Canada.\n\nPhoebe states she loves learning.\n\nColin is wearing a New Era Oklahoma City Thunder NBA New Era Casual Classic Primary Cap and a Shepard Fairey T-shirt.\n\nPaul Rudd also improvised lines in a school interior scene along with what was written.[663]\n\n\"Cujo\" was chosen so the script could dovetail into a joke about \"Beethoven,\" a nod to Ivan Reitman. Reitman was a producer on \"Beethoven.\"[664]\n\n\"Rabbit Chase I\" from the movie's soundtrack can be heard at 18:58.\n\nThe \"Cujo\" reference was not meant as an allusion to the Terror Dog.[665]\n\nPodcast has Sony headphones.\n\nPodcast's real name was originally in script but it was later removed. Logan Kim does know what it is.[666]\n\nGrooberson's seismic map of Oklahoma places Summerville as a stand-in for Woodward, Oklahoma.\n\nWertheimer's Hardware was named after Jason Reitman's lawyer Alan Wertheimer.[Note 6]\n\nThe hardware store interiors were filmed at Howe's Brothers Lumber and Building store at 818 Railway Street in Crossfield.\n\n\"Muddy Water\" plays at 19:59 as Calie picks out painting supplies.\n\nCallie picks Behr Premium Plus Interior Eggshell Enamel.\n\nTracy Letts portrayed the hardware store owner in an uncredited role. The original actor had a conflict and had to be replaced. Letts, Carrie Coon's husband, was in Canada with her along with their son Haskell and got the job.[667]\n\n\"Cujo Attacks Car\" from the Cujo movie's soundtrack can be heard at 20:36.\n\nA Zaxby's cup is in Gary Grooberson's research room. Zaxby's was one of the restaurant chains participating in promotional tie-ins for Ghostbusters: Afterlife.\n\nPhoebe's line stating she figured Grooberson for a football coach is a callback to the first movie, Chapter 10: Checking Out Dana, when Dana told Peter he seemed more like a game show host than scientist.\n\nOn Grooberson's white board are some seismology terms like Trace Equalization, \"adjusting a seismic channel so that the amplitudes of adjacent traces are comparable in the sense of having the same rms value over some specified interval, or some other criterion.\"\n\n\"Wait a Minute Girl\" plays at 22:45 when the camera zooms in on the Spinners sign and before we see Trevor in the freezer.\n\nLucky gives Trevor a hoodie with a wolf on the back. Trevor is played by Finn Wolfhard.\n\nDuring Podcast's tour of Summerville, he and Phoebe walk past the Canadian Blood Services building in Beiseker.\n\nPodcast and Phoebe's tour was filmed in Fort MacLeod, as they walk past the Empress Threatre at 235 24th Street, Fort MacLeod, Alberta T0L 0Z0, Canada.\n\nPodcast points out Wertheimer's Hardware, where Callie presumably just shopped at.\n\nPodcast references the secret society known as the Illuminati and the notion that government is run by Lizard people. He implies he thinks Thomas Jefferson, Einstein, and Beyonce are Lizard people and are responsible for the Egyptian pyramids.\n\nThe theatre advertises a screening of Cannibal Girls, a movie directed by Ivan Reitman and also referenced in Ghostbusters II, Chapter 21: Tenth Level of Hell, and Bingo.\n\nWhen Podcast and Phoebe walk to the Shandor Mining Company, the Dorothy Ferry Bridge was augmented with CGI to make the area look bigger.\n\nBetween trailers and the final version of the movie, the background behind Phoebe and Podcast as they walk to the bridge to the Shandor Mining Company was digitally modified.\n\nIt is revealed the Shandor Mining Company extracted selenium from the mines, a callback to the first movie, Chapter 20: Keymaster, when Ray noted 550 Central Park West was built with selenium girders.\n\nThe base of the mountain was built on the Studio 3 sound stage and it filled up all the space. Jason Reitman challenged production to build more and more rather than use blue screen.[668][669]\n\nThe hieroglyphs on the side of the mountain match the ones on the Temple of Gozer in the first movie.\n\nThe drive Podcast hands Phoebe is a My Little Pony \"Rainbow Dash\" flash drive, a property of Hasbro, who took over the toy line during production of Afterlife.\n\nFrancois Audouy's design for the etched relief on the stone wall was directly based on the engraved doors from Ghostbusters, but to realize the concept, some subtle design modifications would be required to create an organic transition to the iconic ziggurat-stepped architecture. Kirsten Franson spent a long weekend building a working digital 3D model of the transition. A physical study was also built with the sculpting team. Art director Bill Ives built a photo-realistic 3D model of the entire stage set. For the debut of the stone stairway, two versions were built: a \"pre-stairs\" configuration of just the bas-relief rock wall, and a \"post-stairs\" configuration featuring the full transformed set. The visual effects team then bridged the pre and post transformation configurations with the four fully digital shots animating the stone stairway extending out of the bas-relief.[670][671]\n\nThe slot canyon walls were inspired by slot canyons in the Arizona badlands and the archaeological city of Petra in Jordan.[672]\n\nThe second floor of the Farmhouse was only at the house on the stage set in the Calgary studio.[673]\n\nThe armchair swiveling with Phoebe on it was a nod to the scene in the first movie when Dana is ambushed by Zuul.\n\nFor the floor puzzle, Jason Reitman consulted with magician and puzzle creator David Kwong, and commissioned puzzle designer David Shukan. Shukan created a thirteen-step solution that was then built to function practically on set.[674]\n\nThe P.K.E. Meter in the shot when Phoebe finds the Trap in the floor was digitally erased in Trailer #1.\n\nMusic from the MGM film \"Child's Play\" can be heard as the 1988 movie plays in class starting at 31:24.\n\n\"Child's Play\" was a childhood favorite of Jason Reitman.[675]\n\nThe comic book Grooberson was reading at around the 31:34 mark was Marvel Comics's Ultimate Avengers #4 (November 25, 2009).\n\nGrooberson references \"The Walking Dead\" franchise.\n\nIn Trailer #1, when Grooberson picks up the Trap, mist is green. In the movie, it is regular smoke.\n\nGrooberson refers to when the Ghostbusters blew up the roof of 550 Central Park West in the 1984 movie.\n\nThe clips Grooberson shows Podcast and Phoebe are original dailies from the 1984 movie when they arrived at 550 Central Park West for the battle with Gozer.\n\nA deleted take of Mrs. Reitman, Catherine Reitman, and Jason Reitman's cameo as background extras fleeing from 550 Central Park West from the first Ghostbusters movie.\n\nThese were stored in salt mines in Kansas by the movie studio.[676]\n\nThe Ghostbusters arriving at Central Park West and Peter greeting the crowd, from Chapter 25 \"Working The Crowd\".\n\nA daily of Egon and Janine hugging at the end of the movie, from Chapter 28: Crossing Streams.\n\nGary remarking \"cool\" when he learns Callie is single mirrors when Peter remarks \"good\" when he learns Dana lives by herself.\n\nGrooberson admits \"I always wanted to do this,\" in reference to using a Ghost Trap. In the first movie, Peter had a similar line when he performed the 'the flowers are still standing' trick in Chapter 13: \"Nice Shootin', Tex.\"\n\nEarly into writing the script, Jason Reitman reached out to Adam Savage, whom he is friends with, and asked for help in making one of the props for Ghostbusters: Afterlife. Savage suggested the Aztec Death Whistle and it was approved.[677] François Audouy sent Savage a design for the Death Whistle then he sculpted it in Sculpey polymer clay.[678] Production called for the Death Whistle props to look like \"rotted stone.\"[679] In 2019, over a couple of days, Adam Savage worked on seven Death Whistle props with Mythbusters Junior co-host Allie Weber. Three props are the hero version, two are for background shots, and two are for stunts.[680][681] He secretly signed them \"A A\" for \"Adam and Allie.\" The poured urethane plastic into the mold and used a type of resin called instacast.[682][683][684] Savage used Forstner bits to drill out two holes in the whistle end, one in each eye, and one under the jaw of each prop.[685] They used a Dremel tool to round out the rough edges.[686] They used a simple spray nozzle and blow drier as they lightly dusted coats on the base tan color and applying washes. For the look of rotted stone, they created they weathered look from using brown shoe polish, a black and burnt umber wash for browns, and a little bit of oil paint then some acrylic washes.[687][688] A pounce bag consisting of jersey t-shirt material filled with Fuller's earth was used to dirty up the props.[689] Savage used a special orange case made for the props and hand delivered them to Jason Reitman at the exterior Farmhouse set in Canada during principal photography.\n\nPaul Rudd and Carrie Coon improvised their characters' flirtation after Gary and Callie meet in the Farmhouse.[690]\n\nThe version of Tobin's Spirit Guide that appears in the movie is a first edition.[691]\n\nThe design of the Tobin's Spirit Guide prop was inspired by old first edition leather bound books in rare book collections.[692]\n\nIn addition to the Gozer pages, there were pages about ghost classifications.[693]\n\nMarie Massolin hand drew the Tobin's Spirit Guide cover art.[694]\n\nCreature designer Brynn Mettheney hand drew the Sentinel and Terror Dog engravings in Tobin's Spirit Guide.[695]\n\nA traditional book binder was engaged to manufacture the Tobin's Spirit Guide prop, complete with a stamped leather and gold-leafed cover.[696]\n\nPodcast and Phoebe look through a copy of Tobin's Spirit Guide, referenced in the first movie. There are illustrations of Terror Dogs, and Podcast reads a passage that mentions the Sumerians, Gozer, the Gatekeeper, and the Keymaster.\n\nThe first entry Podcast opens the book on is about water spirits.\n\nThe text is taken from \"Encyclopædia of Superstitions, Folklore, and the Occult Sciences of the World Volume II\", Chapter XVII, The Sea, pages 1073 to 1074.\n\nThe passage Podcast reads from has a reference to the \"Trick of Mecone\" from Greek mythology when Prometheus tricked Zeus for the benefit of mankind.\n\nThe passage Podcast reads refers to the Sumerians believing in a land of the dead. In Sumerian mythology, this realm was named Kur. It was said to be a dark and dreary cavern located deep underground where \"a shadowy version of life on earth\" existed. Some interpretations also refer to it as a desert. The dead did not have to undergo final judgment, nor were they punished nor rewarded for their deeds in life. They all ended up in the same place. The dead's quality of existence in Kur was determined by their conditions of burial. The ruler of Kur was the goddess Ereshkigal, who lived in the palace Ganzir.\n\n\"Can You Get To That\" plays 38:30 starting when Trevor examines the dirty mat to when Lucky and friends take Trevor to the mountain, enters the mining property in trucks, and ascends the hill to the mine elevator.\n\nThe scene of Trevor joining Lucky and her friends after work was longer and was akin to a \"Boogie Nights\" one take shot.[697]\n\nThe drive to the Shandor mine was filmed at Horsethief Canyon in Drumheller.[698] It is about 17 minutes north of Drumheller. A false ramp was placed on the road when they drive up.\n\nThe mine shaft built on the top of the mountain was only 6 feet deep.[699]\n\nIn the Trailer #1, the P.K.E. stream that shoots up the mine elevator was green. By Trailer #2, it was changed to orange.\n\nThe mine shaft entrance and elevator was added to the set location. It has since been removed and the hole filled back in.\n\nLucky reveals her family has lived in Summerville for four generations.\n\nThe teenagers looking down the shaft and seeing a figure say \"Gozer\" mirrors the first movie, Chapter 7: Fried Eggs & Zuul, when Dana Barrett looked in her refrigerator and sees a Terror Dog say \"Zuul\".\n\nThe ancient map that Grooberson notices while inside the Farmhouse first appeared off-screen as supplemental material with a tie-in merchandise release of Reebok shoes in November 2020.[700]\n\nGary notes Summerville isn't even a hundred years old, implying it was founded after 1921. Page 26 of Ghostbusters: Afterlife: The Art and Making of the Movie reveals Summerville was founded in 1928.\n\nThe pattern on Phoebe's maroon shirt are all the shapes on the Zener cards, the same used by Peter for his research at the start of the first movie, Chapter 2: Shock the Nerd.\n\nThe shirt was Danny Glicker's idea.[701]\n\nThe Farmhouse's shed was built from repurposed wood in the acquisition of the barn.[702]\n\nThe underground lab was built on the Studio 3 sound stage at the Calgary Film Centre.[703]\n\nThe underground lab set is actually two steel sea containers welded together.[704]\n\nTo populate the underground lab set, Paul Healy used screen grabs from the original movies, secret eBay accounts, and secretly got advice and assistance on Ghostbusters fan sites, forums, and threads.[705][706]\n\nWhen Phoebe slides down the fire pole to the underground laboratory, re-recording mixer Will Files reused the sound of when Ray Stantz slides down the fire pole in the original movie, Chapter 5: Fixer-Upper.[707]\n\nThe various specimens references Egon's hobby of collecting spores, mold and fungus he mentioned in Chapter 8: \"Bug-Eyes Thing\".\n\nThe Aura Video-Analyzer helmet used was a replica. After Paul Healy commissioned the replica, he found the right colander for the prop.[708]\n\nEgon's Stethoscope earphones from the library scenes in the first movie, Chapter 3: \"Get Her!\", appear on the stack of objects.\n\nThe locker door has a maid door sign seen at the Weaver Hall lab's door in the first movie, Chapter 2: Shock the Nerd.\n\nTo Phoebe's left, when she opens the locker, there is a Slinky. It disappears in one shot, then reappears in the next.\n\nThe flightsuits were replicated from the originals down to the small details like the knife pocket being above the seam, using fewer stitches for the patch, using a machine to sew the patches, and matching a repair above the right thumb of Mooglie.[709][710]\n\nPhoebe finds a Crunch bar in chest pocket of a flightsuit. In the first movie, Chapter 4: Terminated, Peter gave a Crunch bar to Egon after their encounter with the Library ghost.\n\nThe patches for the flightsuits in Ghostbusters: Afterlife were done by a local company in Calgary.[711]\n\nFor Ghostbusters: Afterlife, 78 total flight suits were made.[712]\n\nJanine's whale paperweight from the first movie is on top of the old computer.\n\nThe brain graphics are a nod to the first movie, Chapter 3: \"Get Her!\". when Peter recalled Egon tried to drill a hole in his head once.\n\nThere is a box of Cheez-Its on the desk. Egon ate some after Dana's interview in the first movie, Chapter 9: The 1st Customer.\n\nThe Medrad Mark IV Angiographic Injector Injection System is near the table. It was rolled out by a mover in the first movie when Peter, Ray, and Egon are fired from Columbia University in Chapter 4: Terminated.\n\nThe disassembled Proton Pack Phoebe finds in the underground lab was fabricated by The Hand Prop Room.[713]\n\nThe original Proton Pack used by Harold Ramis in the first movie was Lidar-scanned then rebuilt down to the millimeter and aged.[714] Ramis's daughter Violet Ramis-Stiel accompanied Jason Reitman and the crew when they went to Sony's archives to scan the prop. She tried on the prop and started to well up.[715]\n\nAround 17 molds of the Proton Pack were done.[716]\n\nThe hero pack props were cast in aluminum housing then wired with lighting effects.[717]\n\nSome of the little pieces that could not be sourced were molded, 3D printed, cast, and remanufactured.[718]\n\nFor budgetary and logistical reasons, the A.L.I.C.E. frames used for the Proton Pack props were knock-off versions bought from the same manufacturing stock run.[719]\n\nSeven Proton Pack props were made for Ghostbusters: Afterlife.[720]\n\nSome Proton Pack props were made on fly on set during filming of Ghostbusters: Afterlife.[721]\n\nIvan Reitman read a draft and commented Egon wasn't funny enough in the underground lab scene with Phoebe. Jason Reitman and Gil Kenan came up with the joke of Egon pointing the lamp at his framed diplomas.[722]\n\nThe Ghost Sniffer and Giga meter make a brief cameo in front of the wall where the framed diplomas are.\n\nPaul Healy could not locate a Bacharach Sniffer 300 nor a replica so he got real parts from six different sources and made one himself.[723][724]\n\nInitially, a puppeteer was manipulating the lamp with rods but needing better comedic pacing, Jason Reitman told him to just grab it with his hand and move it and they would digitally paint him out.[725]\n\nJason Reitman's original idea for Phoebe entailed a girl was in a corn field. She fired her Particle Thrower into the corn and it popped into popcorn. She ate the popcorn and smiled.[726] The popcorn flies up in the air, the girl catches it and eats it. The scene was filmed but it couldn't be quite pulled off so it was cut out of the movie.[727] There was an attempt to adapt the idea into a scene but it couldn't be pulled off and the scene was deleted.[728][729]\n\nPhoebe watches \"Old Ghostbusters Ad (1984)\" on a laptop in her bedroom. It is the commercial from the first movie, Chapter 7: Fried Eggs & Zuul.\n\nHowever, based on text overlay, the version used was not the one in the first movie. It is a fan-edit of the commercial uploaded by \"Core\" on June 9, 2017. It was assembled using the text-free commercial outtakes from the PlayStation 3 version of Ghostbusters: The Video Game.\n\nThere are several videos on the side bar:\n\nThe Pink P.K.E. Streams flying through the New York City skyline after Walter Peck had the containment grid shut down in Chapter 21: Out of Biz.\n\nThe Ghostbusters ad.\n\nThe video titled \"10 signs the government is run by Shandorians\" by sutrab has a thumbnail that is actually a pullback of a shot from the first movie. There is an arrow pointing to effects crew in the lower right of the Shandor Building matte painting shot.\n\nThe video titled \"The Ghostbusters: Where Are They Now?\" by ParanormalWatch has a thumbnail taken from a candid on-set photo of Dan Aykroyd and Bill Murray from the first movie.\n\nSlimer flying towards the camera at the end of the first movie, Chapter 28: Crossing Streams.\n\nA Poodle dog dressed as the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.\n\nOne video is \"Proton Acceleration with Megan Amram\" by Megan Amram.\n\nOne video is \"Savage Science of the Proton Pack\" by Adam's Savage's Tested. The thumbnail is of Adam wearing his Ghostbusters costume.\n\nCallie's \"it's just dinner\" is similar to when Dana Barrett downplayed her date with Peter in Ghostbusters II, Chapter 19: Scaring the Straights.\n\nPhoebe tells Callie not to be herself for the dinner, a callback to Phoebe's first day of school.\n\nSummerville Foundry was filmed at the Turner Valley Gas Plant in Calgary at Sunset Boulevard SE, Turner Valley, AB T0L 2A0.[730]\n\nPodcast welcomes her to \"Rust City.\" Rust City was the working title of Afterlife.\n\nThe Ecto Goggles prop was made by Studio Art & Technology.[731]\n\nPodcast reminds Phoebe she is 12 years old.\n\nPhoebe tells Podcast she met her grandfather. Podcasts asks if he banged walls and rattled chains, an allusion to Jacob Marley in \"A Christmas Carol.\"\n\nPhoebe tells Podcast to \"switch me\" like when Ray tells Egon in the Sedgewick Hotel elevator in the first movie, Chapter 11: We Got One!\"\n\nPhoebe testing the Proton Pack outside the Summerville Foundry was shot on day two of principal photography.[732]\n\nIt was the first time Mckenna Grace and Logan Kim met.[733]\n\nJason Reitman concluded, that based on the elevator scene in the first movie, there was a switch under the ion arm of the Proton Pack to turn it on. That was incorporated into the Proton Pack props on Ghostbusters: Afterlife.[734]\n\nWhen the Proton Packs arrived on the set, the on switch was discovered to be placed on the wrong spot. Holes were cut under the ion arms and the switches were put in their proper place. Peter White is credited with installing the switches at the last moment.[735] A tiny light switch was used and cut it down so the actual toggle looked like the switch breaker.[736]\n\nRe-recording mixer Will Files took the digitized work tapes from the original movie and added new notes to make the Proton Pack Phoebe uses sound rusty and miscalibrated. In the cyclotron start up sequence, Files recorded an old railroad welding turbine from the 1800s while the Particle thrower and Proton Stream sound was processed and made to sound like it was spinning around.[737]\n\nEric Reich helped secure the right wiring harness for the Proton Pack prop in Ghostbusters: Afterlife.[738]\n\nBen Eadie added a remote control module in the Proton Pack prop to control the speed of the motor in the cyclotron. It was utilized for close up shots of the cyclotron starting up for the first time in the movie.[739][740][741][742]\n\nMckenna Grace couldn't hit the trigger on the thrower so an ad hoc trigger was built near the wood grip.[743]\n\nThe sound that the motor makes inside the Proton Pack prop's cyclotron was used in the movie.[744]\n\nThe Proton Pack being turned on was the first sound design made for the movie.[745]\n\nRichard Begg's original sounds that were and weren't used were used for the Proton Pack start up sequence. The sound team carefully manipulated and stitched the unused sounds together. Then for the sound of the cyclotron spinning around, they created a doppler effect using software called Sound Particles. They fed a sound into it and the software created thousands of little sound particles.[746]\n\nLogan Kim could barely see when he wore the Ecto Goggles during filming. He even hit Mckenna Grace's face by accident once.[747]\n\nIt is revealed a photographing function was added to the Ecto Goggles.\n\nThe camera used for the Ecto Goggles was the Fujifilm Instanx Mini 9 Instant Camera. The guts of the camera were stripped out then put into the Ecto Goggles prop. The frame holding the flash module that pops up was custom built.[748]\n\nIn the interior Foundry scene, Logan Kim slipped and fell. While everyone was alarmed, Mckenna Grace was the only person on set who started laughing. Kim started laughing soon after.[749]\n\nBrynn Metheney worked on Muncher's design from February to May 2019.[750]\n\nBrynn Metheney did hundreds of concept designs of Muncher.[751]\n\nDuring development, Muncher went through many colors, including red browns, blues, purple, and gold. It wasn't until Brynn Metheney saw a concept from DNEG and settled on \"translucent blue sparkly.\"[752]\n\nJason Reitman initially described Muncher to Brynn Metheney as a \"weird little bulldog-like coin purse\" that could empty metal out of its body.[753]\n\nJason Reitman also described Muncher as being like the late Chris Farley and wanted a ghost that could go from \"cute to monster in a heartbeat.\"[754]\n\nBrynn Metheney's back story for Muncher was he is a desperate little ghost who could never be satiated with the amount of metal it gets and he was once a miner who couldn't get enough of the metal he was mining when he was alive. At one point, designs had Muncher with ten fingers on each hand, he was scarier, and grabbier. At some point visual effects supervisor Sheena Dugal gave Jason Reitman some reference photographs of the water bears and he was captivated. The Muncher design shifted to the water bear inspiration. Metheny rationalized the multiple arms were out of necessity so he could move around in confined environments.[755]\n\nArjen Tuiten did some concept art but the final Muncher design chosen was much different. Tuiten did later make foam latex skins of Muncher for the visual effects team to have reference for.[756][757]\n\nJosh Gad voices Muncher. Gad bumped into Jason Reitman on the Sony lot and was asked if he wanted to come and voice a ghost. They went into the studio and recorded right away.[758]\n\nMuncher is the same free floating class as Slimer.[759]\n\nMuncher was also an attempt to get back to how the original Slimer was scary and angry in the first movie.[760]\n\nIncidentally, on the Extreme Ghostbusters episode \"Back in the Saddle, Part 1\" which featured the new team teaming up with the original team, entailed ghosts that ate metal but had an ability to self-replicate when shot with proton streams.\n\nThe bit when Phoebe looks back at Podcast, and he gives the head shake was scripted.[761]\n\nArmorer Ben Eadie suggested \"Incoming!\" be shouted when Muncher fires projectiles in the Foundry. Ivan Reitman liked the suggestion, they filmed it, but it wasn't used.[762][763][764]\n\nThe thrower for the Ecto-1's gunner seat pack was lost at the Turner Valley Gas Plant so Ben Eadie had to scramble. He removed a Particle Thrower from a Phoebe Proton Pack prop and taped it to the gunner seat prop. They then added the tape to every thrower hose for continuity.[765]\n\n\"Boredom\" plays after Ecto-1 starts for the first time and the hood comes down at 53:39.\n\nOne of the first ideas that came to Jason Reitman for Ecto-1 was wheat drifting.[766]\n\nThe cast and crew spent a whole afternoon doing doughnuts with Ecto-1 in the barley field. The Ecto-1 used had the smell of toasted barley on it afterwards.[767]\n\nA CG version of Ecto-1 was used when it drove through the barley field.[768]\n\nA truck with the same wheelbase as the Cadillac stood in for Ecto-1 for the jump scene. It was fitted with the same tires as Ecto-1.[769]\n\nJeff Senca was the stunt driver for the Ecto-1 jump scene.[770]\n\nFor Ecto-1 jump scene, the car's speed was in the 35 to 40 mph range then it went 55 feet from take off to landing.[771]\n\nFor Ecto-1 jump scene, five cameras were placed at multiple angles.[772]\n\nFor Ecto-1 jump scene, the stunt truck landed on the stunt camera but the footage survived.[773]\n\nPhoebe reveals Trevor failed his driver's test three times. In real life, Finn Wolfhard has failed twice and didn't have a license during filming.\n\nThe scene where Callie and Grooberson eat dinner was filmed in the Enjoy Garden on Railway Street in Crossfield.\n\n\"Foolish Try\" plays during Callie and Gary's date at 54:53.\n\nOn Callie and Grooberson's table are a pair of orange Neko Lucky Cat Ceramic Tiki Mugs.[774]\n\nGary mentions the Arbuckle Formation, it is the deepest layer of rock underlying much of oil-ruch Kansas.\n\nThe restaurant has a Coca-Cola refrigerator.\n\nGary mentions allergy medication Benadryl.\n\nCallie reveals Phoebe's father couldn't connect to her. It's the only mention of her and Trevor's biological father in the movie.\n\nThe grain elevator Ecto-1 passes by was filmed in Dorothy. There is an old grain elevator at Highway 570 near 1st Street. The Art and Making of The Movie contends the elevator was digitally added.[775]\n\nTrevor and Phoebe allude to the events of the first movie.\n\nPodcast alludes to the final part of the events of the first movie, 550 Central Park West, and the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.\n\nThe Particle Thrower for the Ecto-1's gunner seat is shorter and lacks a barrel extension mechanism. It took inspiration from military vehicle weapons having a shorter barrel so troops could get in and out fast. The thrower was named the \"snub nose.\"[776]\n\nTrevor asking Podcast to stop breathing into his ear was improvised by Finn Wolfhard.[777]\n\nPodcast calls Muncher a Class 5, the same classification as Slimer.\n\nOne of the pieces on the bumper of the Proton Pack prop on the gunner seat kept falling off. In the 20 to 30 takes, Ben Eadie had to re-glue the piece back on each time.[778]\n\nThe Hero Ecto-1 used for stunt driving in Afterlife went through a couple suspensions just because of the extra weight from the roof equipment.[779]\n\nThe Muncher chase was built as an afternoon chase that crescendos at sunset. It was filmed over the course of principle photography in different towns. Jason Reitman considers it one of the most complicated pieces of filmmaking he has ever undertaken.[780]\n\nThe Muncher chase scene took all of principal photography to film.[781]\n\nThe Wertheimers Hardware storefront was filmed in Drumheller.[782]\n\nFilming of the Muncher chase was seen at the corner of Railway Street and Nanton Avenue in Crossfield, Alberta, Canada in August 2019.\n\nWhen Trevor, Podcast, and Phoebe, in Ecto-1, find Muncher eating a hydrant, that was filmed in front of Queens Hotel in Fort MacLeod.\n\nThe Proton Pack for the gunner seat was made by cutting up a foam stung pack prop with a hack saw[783]\n\nThe cage for the gunner seat was plastic or wood cut using a Glowforge.[784]\n\nAshley from the Alberta Ghostbusters designed a neutrona wand box that was ultimately unused. It ended up in her home.[785]\n\nThe initial idea for the gunner seat was to just bolt on a regular Proton Pack.[786]\n\nAt one point, the thrower for the gunner seat was going to be white and plastic.[787]\n\nThe gunner seat's Particle Thrower was designed by Kirsten Franson then built by The Hand Prop Room.[788]\n\nThe Gunner seat reveal was filmed in Fort MacLeod, on the corner of Second Avenue and 24th Street.\n\nThe Kenner Ecto-1 toy featured a similar blaster chair.\n\nSome of the shots of Phoebe on the gunner seat were filmed against greenscreen and composited in later. If a scene involved using a second unit and stunt double, the visual effects team did a face replacement with Mckenna Grace's.[789]\n\nIn pursuit of Muncher in Ecto-1, they turn off 2 Avenue onto 24th Street then past the Empress Theatre at 235 24th Street, Fort MacLeod, Alberta T0L 0Z0, Canada.\n\nThe theater signage blasted by Phoebe is that of Fort MacLeod's Empress Theatre.\n\nEcto-1 passes by the Empress Theatre twice during the chase but the second time, the theatre is digitally erased. Similarily, the Pioneer Trail store is passed twice.\n\nThe genesis of the Remote Trap Vehicle came from the desire to see an old fashioned 1980s car chase. Once the gunner seat was imagined, the Remote Trap Vehicle idea came soon after.[790]\n\nEarly concepts for the Remote Trap Vehicle's deployment in Ecto-1 included a swing out arm and a rotating turret door.[791][792]\n\nThe Remote Trap Vehicle prop was fabricated by Studio Art & Technology.[793]\n\nA Traxxas Stampede 4WD with a completely redone chassis was used for the Remote Trap Vehicle props.[Note 7][794]\n\nThe Trap doors on the stunt Remote Trap Vehicle don't open because it was used in the high speed chase scenes. The hero Remote Trap Vehicle props either started opened or closed then moved to the other position.[795]\n\nSean from the Alberta Ghostbusters casted a dummy version of the Remote Trap Vehicle that was to stuck out of the Ecto-1 halfway because it couldn't eject.[796]\n\nTo prevent it from being spoiler too early on in promotion, the R.T.V. was omitted in Trailer #1 during the turn. The look of the Proton Streams were also tweaked by the time of Trailer #2.\n\nThe Summerville post office seen during the Muncher chase bears a fictitious 74024 zip code. Summerville stands in for Woodward, which has the zip codes 73801 and 73802.\n\nThe post office used was from Drumheller.[797] and Fort MacLeod at Third Avenue East and Center Street.\n\nThe miners memorial in front of the post office was in Drumheller during filming.[798]\n\nA brief two second snippet of \"On the Road Again\" can be heard as Muncher flies through Spinner's Roller Hop at 1:00:52.\n\nDuring filming of Ecto-1 and the RTV following Muncher down the gravel road, Ben Eadie accidentally drove an RTV into some rocks and it crashed under a camera truck and it exploded and caught on fire. After the write-off paperwork was done, Eadie was told to throw the box of remains away but he put it in his car with the intent to do a restoration.[799][800]\n\nThe ominous scene of Trevor, Phoebe, and Podcast looking at Shandor Mine's mountain after trapping Muncher and realizing there's a connection mirrors when Egon, Ray, and Winston came up from the sewers in Ghostbusters II and realize the River of Slime was flowing to the Manhattan Museum of Art in Chapter 18: In the Tunnel.\n\nThe scene where Ecto-1 is pulled over by Sheriff Domingo was filmed in Fort MacLeod at the Alberta Wheat Pool Grain Elevator at 15 St & 1 Avenue.\n\nAfter being pulled over by the Sheriff Domingo, a Twinkie is seen in the Ecto-1's glove box.\n\nThe Summerville County Sheriff's Department was filmed at 1112 Railway Street, Crossfield, Canada.\n\nPhoebe, Trevor, and Podcast are arrested, similar to the Ghostbusters in the first movie.\n\nSheriff Domingo's first name is Sherman.[801]\n\nSheriff Domingo asks Phoebe \"Who ya gonna call?\"\n\nRay's Occult Books was faithfully rebuilt by the crew down to the red phone.\n\nFrancois Audouy is friends with Tom Duffield, who worked on Ghostbusters II, and grilled him when it came to creating Ray's Occult.[802]\n\nThe Ray's Occult Books set was built on a sound state at the Calgary Film Centre. It was in the same building as the Temple of Gozer set.[803]\n\nDuring development of the Ray's Occult set, it was decided to stay in business, Ray branched out and started selling crystals and incense and leased out space in the back of the store for a palm reader.[804]\n\nAfter the set was built and populated with props, Francois Audouy got an old dust machine used on Hollywood productions and released dust all over then he burned things like incense and patchouli to get the old bookstore smell and look down.[805]\n\nRay's arm tattoo references Revelation 6:12, a callback to the first movie, Chapter 20: Keymaster, when he talked to Winston in Ecto-1 (which Ray misquoted as being 7:12).[806]\n\nRay is wearing a Ray's Occult Books T-shirt in his first scene in the movie.[807]\n\nDan Aykroyd contributed to the dialogue in the scene where Phoebe calls the Ghostbusters' phone number and speaks to Ray.[808]\n\nRay's monologue in the Ray's Occult scene was originally way longer.[809]\n\nRay recalls he was in the slammer once, a reference to when the Ghostbusters were imprisoned briefly after the containment grid was shut down in Chapter 22: Holding Cell.\n\nRay gets nostalgic about the Reagan era, when President Ronald Reagen was in office in the 1980s.\n\nRay mentioned some actor bought up most of Tribeca and they lost the firehouse. In 1989, Robert De Niro founded TriBeCa Productions with Jane Rosenthal. They opened Tribeca Grill in 1990, organize the annual Tribeca Film Festival, and had stakes in the Greenwich Hotel.\n\nRay mentions Peter became Professor Emeritus of Advertising and Promotion at SUNY Cortland. The university is located in upper state New York near Ithaca and Syracuse.\n\nRay mentions Winston went into finance and became rich.\n\nIn a discarded ending of the first movie, the Ghostbusters expanded into an international franchise and Winston stepped out a limousine in a pinstripe suit.\n\nThe exact year Egon leaves isn't stated but Jason Reitman was operating by the notion that if you were born in the early 2000s, you would not have heard of the Ghostbusters.[810]\n\nRay mentions the Firehouse became a Starbucks.\n\nDeputy Medjuck is named after Joe Medjuck and portrayed by one of Dan Aykroyd's daughters, Stella Aykroyd.\n\nPhoebe's impulsive emotional outburst in the police station mirrors when Egon had an outburst against Walter Peck in the first movie, Chapter 21: Out of Biz.\n\nDuring chemistry reads, Carrie Coon did the argument scene used after the Sheriff's Office with Mckenna Grace.[811]\n\nThe close up of the red eye on the Terror Dog statue was a nod to when a similar manifestation happened in the first movie, Chapter 16: Dogs Drag Dana, of the Terror Dogs starting to break out of their statues.\n\nInteriors were shot in the Deerfoot City Shopping Centre's Walmart in Calgary. Walmart.[812]\n\nVery little was changed in the Walmart aside from changing the price tags from Canadian to U.S. Dollars, adding Fourth of July dressing, and gags for the Mini-Pufts and Terror Dogs.[813][814]\n\nProduction filmed at the Deerfoot City Walmart over three nights from store closing around 10 pm to 5 am the next day.[815]\n\nDuring filming at the Deerfoot City Walmart, Mckenna Grace and Josie Reitman, Jason's daughter, played around since it was reserved to him until 9 am the next morning. They rode around in tricycles wearing unicorn onesies shooting Nerf guns at each other. They later made a toilet roll fort in a shelf.[816][817]\n\nIn the first shot of Grooberson in the Walmart, on the far right is a Ghostbusters Slime Time black T-shirt on display.\n\nIn the same shot, on the right, the spelling \"Vision Centre\" is exclusive to Canada. It should have been changed to \"Vision Center.\"\n\nGrooberson picks out a pint of Baskin-Robbins. In the first Ant-Man movie, Paul Rudd's character Scott Lang briefly works at one until he's fired for lying on his resume.\n\nGrooberson chuckles at the blue velvet flavor of ice cream topping, a nod to David Lynch's \"Blue Velvet\" movie.\n\nA 10 ounce bag of Stay Puft Marshmallows cost $1.20.\n\nIncidentally, miniature versions of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man previously appeared in The Real Ghostbusters comic in 1989, bestial Marshmallow Minis in Ghostbusters: The Video Game, and Mini Pufts in the Ghostbusters: Deviation comic in 2016.\n\nJason Reitman and Gil Kenan didn't want to do another giant entity when they were thinking of how to reinvent the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. They immediately keyed into Gremlin-like creatures that just want to break everything, including each other.[818]\n\nJason Reitman's marching orders for the Mini-Pufts were like mischievous toddlers.[819]\n\nArjen Tuiten was going to have Billy Bryan make one practical Mini-Puft puppet, the one that bites Gary Grooberson, but they ran out of time in production and couldn't make one.[820]\n\nThe Mini Pufts were the hardest characters for Afterlife's VFX team to nail down.[821]\n\nThe Moving Picture Company team hand animated the Mini-Pufts and used toddlers as reference to recreate the elements of clumsiness and cuteness.[822]\n\nVFX Producer Kerry Joseph and his team studied footage of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man from the first movie but added more emotion to the eyes of the Mini Pufts.[823][824]\n\nThe Mini Puft in the middle of the s'more was one of the very first ideas during preproduction of Afterlife.[825]\n\nSeveral Mini Pufts are nods fictional characters:\n\nMary Poppins\n\nPinnochio\n\nIan Malcolm's famous pose from Jurassic Park\n\nTerminator's death in Terminator 2: Judgment Day.\n\nThe nod to Terminator 2: Judgment Day was a idea that came up on post-visualization.[826]\n\nThere were hundreds of voice tracks recorded for the Mini-Pufts.[827]\n\nThe voices of the Mini-Pufts area combination of the production crew, including editor Nate Orloff and lead sound effects designer Chris Terhune, and voice actors.[828][829][830]\n\nIt is revealed Stay Puft also has graham crackers called Stay Crisp.\n\nThe Mini-Puft destroyed in the blender was voiced by Will Files on helium.[831]\n\nSarah Natochenny and Shelby Young voiced the Mini-Pufts in uncredited roles.[832][833]\n\nSarah Natochenny was approached by Jason Reitman after he saw three videos she did for Variety Fair about voice acting. A couple days later, she was recording lines for Mini-Pufts.[834]\n\nSarah Natochenny recorded her lines from her closet.[835]\n\nThe actors picked Mini-Pufts to voice during a session then they would switch and do other ones in the next round.[836]\n\nIra Heiden knew Jason Reitman from playing broomball with him in Culver City. After Heiden heard about Reitman's involvement into a Ghostbusters movie, he emailed him. Heiden was hired to do ADR of various scared background people and ghosts coming out of the pit. After the session on October 16, 2020 was completed, he was asked to stay and was told he was also going to be recording for the Mini-Pufts.[837][838][839]\n\nIra Heiden voiced a Mini-Puft on the Roomba, the Mini-Puft with the jelly bean, the Mini-Puft drooling onto the grill, and one of the Mini-Pufts pushing a button on the blender.[840]\n\nAt one point, there was talk of changing the look of the Terror Dog. Arjen Tuiten felt strongly against that and wanted to keep the iconic look. He put his foot down and the original look was kept.[841]\n\nThe large Terror Dog sculpture was led by Norman Cabrera, a creature effects artist, Tanner White, Danny Wagner, and Bryan Ray. As time went on, workers came in sets to work on different aspects of the Terror Dogs.[842]\n\nArjen Tuiten met with Jason Reitman around January 2019 and they quickly hit it off within 10 minutes. Reitman visited Tuiten's shop a week later and talked about some ideas.[843]\n\nAbout a week later, Tuiten got a call asking if he would be willing to do the Terror Dogs as well. He quickly agreed to. Sony gave him access to never-before-seen stills of the original puppets and reference material for the sculptures.[844][845]\n\nTuiten and his team wanted to stay with the process used by the Boss Films crew rather than scanning and milling one out in foam. They started with making a Terror Dog maquette. Steve Koch sculpted the maquette. They photographed it, projected ut on the wall four times the size, made an armature, and used 600 pounds of wet clay. They spent two weeks sculpting.[846]\n\nBill Sturgeon, of Spectral Motion, took lead on the Terror Dog's body skin. All other head foam skins and cosmetic elements were handled in Tuiten's shop.[847]\n\nBill Sturgeon scanned the core and designed all the internal head and body mechanisms then Jurgen Heimann built them.[848]\n\nThe Terror Dog puppets ended up weighing close to 450 to 500 pounds.[849]\n\nFoam latex was chosen over silicon for the Terror Dog puppet due to weight issues. Silicon would have been about 500 pounds heavier.[850]\n\nLacking an oven of proper size, Tuiten turned to Bill Fesh for the foam skin.[851]\n\nThe Terror Dog's teeth was made with acrylic.[852]\n\nThe Terror Dog's horns and nails were made with urethane resin.[853][854]\n\nBill Sturgeon placed a linear actuator in the stomach of the Terror Dog puppet to mimic realistic breathing.[855]\n\nThe Terror Dog drool was actually a product called UltraSlime.[856]\n\nThe Terror Dog head was operated by around 21 servo motors.[857][858]\n\nWhen Gary Grooberson comes upon Vinz Clortho eating bags of dog food, Jason Reitman didn't think the sound the Vinz crunching the food sounded violent enough, so re-recording mixer Will Files added the sound of a lion eating an animal.[859]\n\nThe dog food is a callback to the first movie, Chapter 18: Terror on the Tavern, when Louis Tully initially thought someone brought a dog to his party and later he meekly offers it a Milkbone.\n\nVinz eats from Purina Dog Chow Complete Adult with Real Chicken bags.\n\nGrooberson was about to call Vinz a nice doggie like Louis did in the first movie but is interrupted by a roar.\n\nFor the Terror Dogs in Ghostbusters: Afterlife, re-recording mixer Will Files had work with sounds with low fidelity quality. Using the originals as a foundation, they edited it, augmented it, added their own voices pitched down to blend with the animal sounds.[860]\n\nVinz Clortho's clumsy exit was a callback to the first movie, Chapter 17: \"Who Brought the Dog?\", when he crashed Louis Tully's party.\n\nThe Terror Dog was a mix of puppetry and CGI.[861]\n\nThe crew studied various things for the Terror Dog's movements, including the Running of the Bulls and how the bulls regained their footing after smashing storefronts.[862]\n\nGrooberson running to his car and Vinz catching up was a night shoot in the Deerfoot City Walmart parking lot.\n\nLike Louis Tully, Grooberson has an awkward moment before he is possessed. The weight of Vinz causes his tires to go flat.\n\nJason Reitman was adamant about the visual effects team following Tuiten's sculpture so the maquette and sculptures were scanned and used for their models.[863]\n\nAs the other teenagers look over Phoebe, Podcast, Trevor, and Lucky's booth as they discuss the map, it mirrors when the Ghostbusters' cellmates started to get interested in their conversation about 550 Central Park West and Gozer in the first movie, Chapter 22: Holding Cell.\n\nOrlando is mentioned by Podcast.\n\nLucky confirms Ivo Shandor built everything in Summerville, including the mine, the foundry, the school, the library.\n\n550 Central Park West is alluded to.\n\nThe finale of the first movie is once again mentioned.\n\nThe sound stages used for the Farmhouse and Temple of Gozer were next door to each other.[864]\n\nThe mine shaft was built during the first week of photography.[865]\n\nThe Gozer statue in the temple was sculpted in 3D and zbrush.[866]\n\nThe Temple of Gozer set was built using a combination of three techniques: taking molds of real rocks, hand sculpting, and cutting on a four axis mill.[867]\n\nEverything above 15 feet tall and all the squeezes in the corner rocks of the temple set are real rock.[868]\n\nThe floor in the temple set was a foot of styrofoam sandwiched between plywood. During construction, a 10 person team cut a circle in the floor and slotted in the pre-built sacrificial death pit gateway.[869]\n\nThe mine elevator was built practically. It was 45 feet tall on a stage set that led to the the chamber set.[870]\n\nThe mine shaft was built on the Studio 3 sound stage in Calgary Film Centre.[871] The mine elevator lands in the Studio 2 sound stage where the Temple of Gozer set was.[872]\n\nDuring the filming of the elevator ride, Mckenna Grace and Logan Kim talked in Morse code with their flashlights.[873]\n\nAfter coming down the mine elevator, there is a statue of the pre-chosen form Gozer took in first movie.\n\nThe Gozer statue was heavily inspired Polish sculptor Stainislaw Szukalski.[874]\n\nPhoebe notes Gozer is genderless. In the first movie, Chapter 26: Gozer, Winston thought Gozer was male then Egon states it's whatever it wants to be.\n\nThe temple set's design was inspired by art deco, ancient Sumerian and Babylonian iconography, stepwells in South Asia, geometric patterns by architect Louis Sullivan, holy sites, monuments, mausoleums, cubist statuary, and a bit of Eastern European fascism.[875]\n\nIvan Reitman urged production to go bigger with the temple set. Production looked at other movie sets, like the Well of Souls from \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" for inspiration.[876]\n\nLucky finds out Trevor is only 15 years old.\n\nTrevor reveals he turns 16 in February 2022.\n\nLucky notes it is currently June.\n\nThere is a sequence of years etched in stone in the temple:\n\n1823:\n\n1883: 1883 was the year of the Krakatoa eruption, as mentioned.\n\n1908: The year of the Tunguska blast that Ray references at the end of the first movie.\n\n1945: The year World War II ended with the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\n1984, in reference to the first movie.\n\nThe most current year etched in stone is 2021, when this movie takes place.\n\nIvo Shandor's coffin was patterned after real glass enclosures used to display the embalmed bodies of infamous leaders around the world and religious figures across Europe. Kirsten Franson modeled one of Francois Audouy's sketches in 3D, which was then distributed to the construction department and crafted to be elegant and sophisticated.[877]\n\nIvo Shandor's tomb reveals he was born in 1855 and \"died\" in 1945.\n\nIvo Shandor's physical appearance incidentally matches how he looked in Ghostbusters: The Video Game (Realistic Versions). It was a coincidence, Arjen Tuiten did not look at the design from that game when he made his one concept.[878]\n\nWhile the year 2021 is inscribed in the stone, Podcast's line about Shandor's body being in the tomb was not fixed to from \"75 years\" to \"76\" to reflect it is 2021.\n\nThe Proton Pack props reserved for the 4 pack set up in the mine weren't up to Jason Reitman's expectations. Peter White and members of the Alberta Ghostbusters worked on them for a lot of hours over a weekend.[879][880]\n\nShannon Chapel worked on the P.K.E. Meter prop that controls the Proton Pack array.[881]\n\nThere was more about Callie's backstory that streamlined.[882]\n\nThe top antennae on the Proton Cannon affixed to the obelisk is amplified to detect ghosts sooner than a standard P.K.E. Meter. Upon detection the meter arms raise up and flip a switch to start the Proton Pack. The pack then sends electrical charges directly into the cyclotron via jumper cables and the cyclotron sends protons into the neutrona wand and the cannon fires instantly. A wire linked to the rest of the array triggers the other cannons.[883]\n\nRob Petkau, of Genesis Custom Sabers, also worked on the Proton Cannon's wand props.[884]\n\nThe Proton Cannons were initially mounted on a flat piece of metal but the Alberta Ghostbusters working on them made the bases that were used in the movie.[885]\n\nThe Proton Cannon with the odd looking panel was redone by Jordin Johanson of the Alberta Ghostbusters. Initially, it was covered with trap relays and sockets. He pulled them off and reworked them under the direction of \"what would it look like if the cyclotron assembly was completely pulled off?\"[886]\n\nJohanson used parts from a scrap bin to make its injector tubes so that it kind of looked like an ion arm power cell.[887]\n\nThe Proton Cannon with the separate mounted cyclotron was built under the premise of what it would look like if the cyclotron had to be removed or swapped out at some point.[888]\n\nOne of the Proton Cannon wands resembles the thrower muzzle from the Proton Pack seen in Ghostbusters (2016 Movie). That wand was shipped to the set from a prop company based in Los Angeles and only changed a little.[889]\n\nThe resistors on the Proton Cannons are a mix of real and casted.[890]\n\nThe components of the Proton Cannons are mostly fiberglass.[891]\n\nThe Alberta Ghostbusters left some easter eggs inside the Proton Cannons:[892]\n\nA random B-level Star Wars figure is on one of the bases.\n\nOne of the Alberta Ghostbusters' TK numbers is on one of the outer rings.\n\nThe Alberta Ghostbusters' logo is inside the prop where all the electronics are.\n\nThe business card of the then president of Alberta Ghostbusters is in one of them.\n\nThey signed the inside of the one with the big cyclotron.\n\nThey programmed shout outs that are commented out on the Arduinos that run the props.\n\nThe team of Alberta Ghostbusters technically broke on-set rules and installed the Proton Cannons and bases themselves using pipe fitting adapters bought from a local Home Depot on a holiday weekend.[893]\n\nCallie is wearing a Rails' \"Hunter Agave Rose Blue Plaid\" shirt.\n\nA framed photo reveals Callie took ballet in her youth.\n\nAn article reveals during her childhood in Chicago, Callie sold 10,000 boxes of Girl Scout cookies.\n\nPhotos from Coon's childhood and college years photos were used for the underground lab scene when Callie realizes Egon was keeping track of her life.[894]\n\nSome photos show that Callie was on a track team in high school.\n\nAn article reveals Callie went to college in Ohio, had a major/minor in English/Spanish/Psychology, wore #3 on her jersey on a woman's soccer team, was a four year letterwinner and co-captain, and in one season she was a second team All-OAC and third team All-Ohio pick\n\nOne of Egon's notes amid Callie's photos notes her dorm room shows serious fatigue in all load bearing, callback to Egon's assessment of the firehouse in the first movie.\n\nAt the 1:26:37 mark, left of Callie's left shoulder, there is a note card that lists Callie's second birthday in 1984. Thus, Callie was born in 1982.\n\nPossessed Callie's line \"There is no Mom, only Zuul\" is a callback to the first movie, Chapter 19: Peter's Date with Zuul, when she possessed Dana Barrett and told Peter, \"There is no Dana, only Zuul.\"\n\nPossessed Callie breathes heavily just like possessed Dana did in bed when the containment grid was shut down in the first movie, Chapter 21: Out of Biz.\n\nThe line was Jason Reitman's idea.[895]\n\nThe Proton Cannon that was blown up was not one of the hero pack props and was made of mostly foam.[896]\n\nPodcast puts on the Aura Video-Analyzer's colander helmet from the first movie, Chapter 20: Keymaster.\n\nThe scene around the model of the Farmhouse was filmed during reshoots but Logan Kim's voice had gotten deeper so several of his lines in that scene were deleted.[897]\n\nDifferent sizes of the Spengler flightsuit were made for Mckenna Grace and the stunt actors.[898]\n\nThe scene of Phoebe explaining to Trevor what a capacitor is was inspired by a time when Adam Savage once explained to Jason Reitman what a capacitor was. On the day of filming the scene, Reitman texted Savage to make sure that was the right way to say it. Savage texted back two different reads to use.[899][900]\n\nPossessed Grooberson is lying down in a pose mirroring possessed Dana in the first movie, Chapter 25: Working the Crowd.\n\nIt is revealed Zuul materializes a shiny dress from her host's clothing, the dress being a callback to a similar outfit possessed Dana wore in the first movie, Chapter 19: Peter's Date with Zuul and on.\n\nThere is a deleted scene of Podcast eating ectoplasm and pudding.[901][902]\n\nThe garage Ecto-1 exits out of was filmed at Crossfield Automotive next to where the sheriff's office was filmed.\n\nThe shot of the garage door rising up mirrors when the Ecto-1 drove out of the Firehouse to head to the Sedgewick Hotel in the first movie, Chapter 11: \"We Got One!\"\n\nThe Stay Puft Marshmallows mural was actually a 20 foot concrete vinyl applied to the brick building using heat guns.[903]\n\nAfter leaving the sheriff's office, Ecto-1 turns and passes by a Stay Marshmallows mural on the side of a building. This was filmed on Railway Street in Crossfield.\n\nThe Stay Puft Marshmallows mural was on the side of A&B Liquor Store building across the street at 1202 Railway (Railway St. and Nanton Avenue).\n\nThe shot of Ecto-1 turning past the Stay Puft Marshmallows sign was a recreation of the shot of Ecto-1 leaving the Firehouse after the Ghostbusters got their first call, seen in Chapter 11: \"We Got One!\"[904]\n\nThe \"Gozerian clouds\" were taken from the original 65 millimeter cloud tank footage from the first Ghostbusters movie stored in salt mines in Kansas by the movie studio.[905]\n\nGozer's throne was inspired by the basalt rocks in Northern Ireland's Giant's Causeway and the Italian architect Carlo Scarpa.[906]\n\nPossessed Callie and Grooberson's transformation into Terror Dogs mirrors Dana Barrett and Louis Tully's transformation in the first movie, Chapter 25: Working the Crowd.\n\nPhoebe's reaction to the transformation and Zuul's head turn was a nod to a similar sequence between Peter and Zuul in the first movie, Chapter 25: Working the Crowd.\n\nThe Terror Dog puppets were too heavy for the initial temple set so it had to be reinforced overnight to compensate.[907]\n\nThere was talk of Arjen Tuiten's shop doing stop motion animation for the parts when the Terror Dogs run up the stairs and when Callie and Gary transform. However, they simply ran out of time during production and the idea was discarded.[908]\n\nSheena Dugal and the creative worked with DNEG on a new technique to create a more ethereal look for Gozer when it moved in space, to convey that different parts of the character sliced forwards and backwards in time. DNEG created the look in Houdini but it was decided it just not right for Afterlife and was not used in the movie.[909]\n\nJason Reitman reached out to Olivia Wilde via text and asked if she wanted to be Gozer in Ghostbusters: Afterlife.[910]\n\nEmma Portner portrayed Gozer in Ghostbusters: Afterlife whenever unusual body language was required and did the body performance for the spirit of Gozer.[911]\n\nOriginally, Gozer's eyes were red but for unknown reasons, they were changed to black in post-production.[912]\n\nIt was Olivia Wilde's idea to add more spikes to the Gozer suit.[913]\n\nOlivia Wilde wasn't available to fittings prior to filming so Arjen Tuiten and his team had to figure it out on the fly the morning of Wilde's scenes.[914]\n\nPreparation for Olivia Wilde took five and half to six hours each day to get into costume and make up.[915]\n\nFrom the upper torso up to her mid-section, Wilde wore a zip-on silicon piece. Everything else was prosthetics. There was a forehead piece but Tuiten's team decided not to use it.[916]\n\nWhen Ivo Shandor is ripped apart by Gozer, an animatronic puppet with a switch blading mechanism was used. J.K. Simmons got to watch his puppet being ripped in half.[917]\n\nArjen Tuiten looked at hairstyles of the early 1900s and even Charles Dickens and did one concept design of Ivo Shandor. Jason Reitman immediately signed off on it. Two replica dummies were made total. Tuiten made one replica dummy of J.K. Simmons for the scenes when Shandor is in his coffin because Simmons would only be on the set for 1 to 2 days whereas filming for that scene was 10 days. The scene of Gozer ripping Shandor in half was filmed twice. The reset took only four minutes.[918][919][920][921][922][923][924]\n\nMitch Devane was the primary sculptor of the dummy while Tim Gore was the lead on painting the heads and hands. The dummy that split into was headed by mold supervisor Brian Rae.[925]\n\nThe regular dummy was made of silicone with an armature to ensure weight and positioning would stay correct when it was laid down in the glass coffin.[926] The splitting dummy had no issues on the set. It was filmed twice.[927]\n\nThe crew found the original special effects 70 mm footage of the pink P.K.E. streaks flying through the city, scanned them, and re-used them for shots in Summerville.[928]\n\nIvan Reitman suggested more wind on the set of Afterlife.[929]\n\nThe montage of ghosts terrorizing background actors was on 3rd Avenue and Centre Street in Drumheller.[930]\n\nThe Miner Ghost's name was first revealed in the Clue Ghostbusters: Afterlife Edition board game.\n\nThe Miner Ghost was puppetry designed by Arjen Tuiten and meant as a homage to the Zombie Taxi Driver from the first movie.[931]\n\nArjen Tuiten realized there wasn't a ghost similar to the Zombie Taxi Driver in the script and pitched his idea to Jason Reitman. It was approved. Tuiten assembled a puppet from what was still lying around his shop.[932]\n\nThere are unused concepts of several Miner ghosts, each named after a trait: \"Dynamite,\" \"Pick Axe,\" \"Lunchbox,\" \"Coats,\" and \"Shovel.\"[933]\n\nThere were several ideas for the ghost, including a school bus driver and a ghost that talks to the kids on the phone. Tuiten eventually got an idea to make him a ghost of one of Ivo Shandor's miners. Danny Glicker worked on the costume outfit.[934]\n\nArjen Tuiten mechanized an old legless skeleton in the shop, Tanner White mechanized the hands, and Bill Sturgeon did the eyes. Tuiten used old foam latex leftover from work on the Terror Dog and sculpted a face. The Miner Ghost was the first practical ghost Tuiten and his team filmed on the set. Three puppeteers operated the Miner Ghost, Tuiten, Ron Binion, and Richard Landon. Landon puppeteered the eyes off-camera with a remote control. Tuiten cable controlled the facial expressions underneath the counter. Binion operated the arms and hands. Initially, the Miner used his left arm. On the morning of rehearsal, Jason Reitman decided it would be the right arm instead. Filming only took one day.[935][936][937][938][939]\n\nOne of the new ghosts is based on the Bug-Eye Ghost made by Kenner in 1987 as part of its The Real Ghostbusters toyline.\n\nThe Bug-Eye Ghost was added into the movie during the delay caused by the start of the covid pandemic.[940]\n\nThe top of the Summerville Miners Memorial Is overflowing with ectoplasm. The base of the memorial has the date of the tragedy as May 20, 1945 and includes names of the miners who died. The side of the base was briefly seen during the Muncher chase when Ecto-1 turns at the post office.[941]\n\nA building is named after the late Tom Pollock, a studio executive, producer, and co-owner of The Montecito Picture Company along with Ivan Reitman. The building also bears Pollock's birth year of 1943.\n\nIn the final days of post-production, Jason Reitman digitally replaced \"Newcastle\" with \"Pollock\" in memory of Pollock.[942]\n\nIn one cut, Phoebe told more jokes to Gozer.[943]\n\nPhoebe tells Gozer she's 12 years old.\n\nThe shot of the RTV going up the ramp in to Ecto-1 is flipped, evidenced by the letters on the store signs in the background.\n\nThe finale on the Farmhouse stage set took just under three weeks to film.[944]\n\nA second Farmhouse set was built in the Calgary Film Centre. For the third act, the Farmhouse double had be built on a stage to control the elements since it took place at night and to be able to film with the young actors who per schedule regulations were limited to filming until 9 or 10 pm. Corn was harvested in southern Alberta and added to the set.[945]\n\nHalf of the Farmhouse set was rebuilt on the sound stage and half was moved from one set to the other like the trees which were on metal plates. The barn was cut up with a chainsaw and set up on the sound stage.[946]\n\nThe corn and barley on the sound stage was real. They were harvested hundred of miles away then trucked in and attached to little grids or plywood that could be moved around.[947]\n\nThe sound stages used for the Farmhouse and Temple of Gozer were next door to each other.[948]\n\nBill Murray was easy to get into contact with through Ivan Reitman and Gil Kenan, both who have directed him in past projects. Murray read the script, enjoyed it, and agreed to join the cast.[949]\n\nOn Bill Murray's first day on set, he was in his trailer trying to get the TV working so he could watch a Chicago Cubs game.[950]\n\nBill Murray had a tendency to strip the props off once a scene was done. In one instance, he left his Proton Pack prop on the floor and it was kicked by a crew member by accident. Ben Eadie had to glue some pieces back on.[951]\n\nOn the day Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Ernie Hudson filmed together, the first shot was done in the morning and was the part where Gozer throws them into the side of Ecto-1.[952]\n\nBill Murray added variations on Peter's barrage of insults at Gozer. Only some ended in the theatrical version. Finn Wolfhard suggested Trevor should laugh to annoy Gozer even more but Jason Reitman urged him to keep playing it low-key.[953]\n\nOlivia Wilde eventually broke character and laughed at Bill Murray's insults to Gozer.[954]\n\nJason Reitman advised Dan Aykroyd to join in and insult Gozer's godly aspects.[955]\n\nBill Murray made fun of Ernie Hudson for having a pad hidden under his spot on the dirt ground for the insult scene. Hudson quipped it was for the stunt man.[956]\n\nOlivia Wilde sat with Ernie Hudson for lunch while still in her Gozer costume. Wilde, in her spiky exoskeleton bodysuit and Pazuzu makeup, approached the introverted Hudson in the food line.[957]\n\nErnie Hudson accidentally hit Bill Murray's head with his Particle Thrower prop after Jason Reitman called cut on the scene. It left a mark but Murray returned a few minutes later.[958]\n\nBill Murray gave armorer Ben Eadie a certificate for a free massage on the last day of shooting. It was in a balled up envelope so Eadie thought it was his copy of the script as usual. When it was time to take the props off Murray, Eadie thanked him and tried to return the envelope. Murray called him a dumb ass and told him it was a gift.[959][960]\n\nThe parts where Trevor was seated on the Gunner chair was done for about three days straight. Dirt was blown into Finn Wolfhard's face. When he blew his nose between takes, dirt came out of his nose.[961]\n\nPeter refers to Gozer as \"Flattop,\" a callback to the first movie when Ray says, \"Aim for the flattop!\"\n\nRay addresses Gozer to stop in a similar way he did in the first movie, Chapter 26: Gozer.\n\nRay mentions:\n\nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\n\nDucks Unlimited\n\nThe Association for the Advancement of Retired Persons\n\nThe National Invasive Species Act, made effective October 26, 1996\n\nAs a callback to the first movie, Chapter 26: Gozer, Gozer asks the Ghostbusters if they're gods.\n\nOne line Bill Murray improvised was right before the Ghostbusters fire at Gozer and Peter says \"Count of three, go on two, one two blast.\"[962]\n\nPeter stalls Gozer by rambling on much like with Vigo in Ghostbusters II, Chapter 26: Ghostbusters vs. Vigo.\n\nAfter Phoebe shoots Gozer in the back of the head, there is a brief shot of Gozer with red eyes instead of black.\n\nLogan Kim filmed the scene where he has to scream and taser Mini-Pufts in Ecto-1 for 45 minutes. Members of the crew stood at the back of Ecto-1 and threw marshmallow goop at Kim. Some marshmallow got flung into his eye. He lost his voice afterwards.[963][964][965]\n\nJason Reitman knew very early on the ending of Afterlife would entail Ghost Egon. It took bleeding edge technology and the entire length of making the movie to accomplish it. Reitman didn't know it would be successful until the very end of the process.[966]\n\nBob Gunton did the performance capture for Egon's ghost.[967]\n\nThe process of creating Egon's ghost went to visual effects house MPC. They started in summer 2019 and took about two years to complete work.[968]\n\nMPC didn't know they were working on Egon's ghost until a bit later after the project was awarded to them and they saw the artwork.[969]\n\nMPC's work on Rachel in \"Blade Runner: 2049\" convinced Jason Reitman they could pull off Egon's ghost.[970]\n\nMPC made sure every detail was worked on: Harold Ramis's likeness, poses, hair, glasses, and even prescription. They sent a successful insert to Reitman while he was filming in Canada. MPC would also be on set.[971]\n\nMPC took the young photoreal version of Harold Ramis they made and slowly aged him to the age he would be in the movie as well as capture of Gunton, mainly his face. The main issues they had was getting Egon's hair right but to also make it feel like he was living on the farm for a long time.[972]\n\nThey also wrestled with how ghostly to make Egon.[973]\n\nIvan Reitman suited up and stood in for one shot for Bill Murray for an insert shot right after Peter switches on the thrower and one shot for the late Harold Ramis for an insert shot of Egon manifesting to help Phoebe fight Gozer.[974][975][976][977]\n\nIncidentally, Egon was briefly turned into a ghost in the The Real Ghostbusters episode \"Egon's Ghost\" and was briefly killed off in the IDW Publishing comics \"Ghostbusters: The Other Side\" and years later in the Ghostbusters International story arc.\n\nThe props in the Trap Field are Spirit brand Ghost Traps. There were 198 of them.[978][979][980]\n\nA team in Los Angeles and a team in Calgary worked on the Trap Field props. The LA team did the computer work. A DMX Lighting Controller was used to operate them.[981]\n\nWhen the Trap field is activated, the Mini-Pufts look like when the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man was caught in the explosion from the Ghostbusters crossing the streams in Chapter 28: Crossing Streams.\n\nOne of Lucky's hands emerges first from the Zuul husk similar to the end of the first movie, Chapter 28: Crossing Streams, with Dana.\n\nGary somewhat recalls he had sex with Callie while they were possessed and she confirms it. In the first movie, there is a deleted scene \"No, Louis!\" where Louis somewhat recalls it but Dana flat out denies it.\n\nPodcast emerges from Ecto-1 covered in marshmallow residue much like three of the Ghostbusters at the end of the first movie, Chapter 28: Crossing Streams.\n\nIt took an hour to apply the marshmallow residue to Logan Kim. It was a substance with cornstarch in it. Some would be glued to his face. A separate Ecto Goggles prop was used that was covered in the substance. After awhile, it would harden like Jell-O and the flightsuit would get really most and uncomfortable.[982]\n\nPodcast reveals the name of his podcast is \"Mystical Tales of the Unknown Universe.\"\n\nRay reveals he is the lone subscriber to \"Mystical Tales of the Unknown Universe.\"\n\nWhen Winston takes in the wear on Ecto-1, his wedding band is visible.\n\nAfter Egon disperses, there is a faint No-Ghost logo in the sky and dedication to the late Harold Ramis.\n\nThe shot of the Brooklyn Bridge was stock footage filmed by the crew of the first Venom movie re-used for the scene.[Note 8]\n\n\"Ghostbusters\" plays prior to the end credits at 1:52:38.\n\nThe mid-credits tag between Peter and Dana took half a day to film. There was a script but it was unnecessary. Bill Murray improvised different takes of the scene.[983]\n\nThe Zener cards and Electro-Shock Generator were used by Peter in the first movie, Chapter 2: Shock the Nerd, against two volunteers for his research into the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.\n\nPeter admits to only shocking the male volunteers, seen in the first movie.\n\nMckenna Grace's single \"Haunted House\" plays after the mid-credits tag at 1:55:46.\n\nMckenna Grace wrote \"Haunted House\" in March 2021 and did not intend it to be in Ghostbusters: Afterlife. She sent the song to Jason Reitman to ask him to direct the music video. He asked to include it in the end credits for Afterlife.[984]\n\nOnly one element in the Busy deleted scene was used for the end tag and the rest were built. The background sounds they added in were filtered to make it feel more like the 1984 movie.[985][986]\n\nThe deleted scene from the first movie, \"Busy\" is effectively made canon in this end tag.\n\nThe lobby scene was filmed at the Calgary Central Library on or around October 7, 2019 in one of the library's terrace-nestled outdoor amphitheaters.[987][988]\n\nWinston mentions he has children.\n\nWinston admits to covering the rent for Ray's Occult Books.\n\nJanine recalls interviewing Winston, seen in the first movie, Chapter 14: Welcome Aboard.\n\nWinston alludes to his steady paycheck quip in the first movie, Chapter 14: Welcome Aboard.\n\nWinston quotes one of his lines from the first movie, Chapter 26: Gozer, when they thought they defeated Gozer, telling Janine \"I had the tools and the talent.\"\n\nThe end tag was shot during the pandemic to complete an idea Jason Reitman had but couldn't fully realize during principle photography. He decided to shoot a couple things to augment the pieces he already had.[989]\n\nThe end tag was seen being filmed on August 11, 2021 at the Los Angeles Firehouse used in the original two movies. The Ecto-1 and Containment Unit were seen.[990]\n\nDuring filming of the end tag at the Los Angeles Firehouse, the crew took a lot of reference photographs and lidar scans of the whole building in advance if the interior of the Firehouse ever needed to be rebuilt.[991]\n\nMooglie is replaced by a Mini-Puft in the No Ghost logo for the final shot in the movie.\n\nIn 2021, Jason Reitman approached Stuart Reeves to make the tongue in cheek version of the Icon Ghost using one of the Mini-Pufts for Ghostbusters: Afterlife.[992]\n\nRick Moranis was approached to reprise Louis Tully by Ivan Reitman and by others but he declined.[993]\n\n↑ Youtube: Empire Movies- Ghostbusters: From Beyond International Trailer November 18\n\n↑ Facebook: SonyPicturesKH- Ghostbusters: Rise-International Trailer\n\n↑ Variety \"Ghostbusters: Afterlife Release Date Delayed a Week\" 9/1/2021\n\n↑ Comic Book Resource \"Ghostbusters: Afterlife Gets First Poster, Official Synopsis\" 12/6/19\n\n↑ Greene, James, Jr., (2022).
