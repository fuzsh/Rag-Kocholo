Philip Daniel Saunders (February 23, 1955 – October 25, 2015) was an American Head coach and basketball executive. He coached the Minnesota Timberwolves, Detroit Pistons and Washington Wizards. Saunders led the Minnesota Timberwolves to 8 consecutive NBA Playoff appearances including 1 NBA Conference Finals appearance, and led Detroit Pistons to 3 NBA Conference Finals with a career best 64-18 (.780) record in 2005-06.

On August 11, 2015, Saunders announced he had been diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma, for which he was undergoing treatment. Saunders planned to remain the Timberwolves' head coach and president. However, after Saunders was hospitalized for more than a month following complications in September, team owner Glen Taylor announced that Saunders would miss the next season. Saunders died on October 25, 2015 at the age of 60. On February 15, 2018, the Timberwolves held a "Flip Saunders Night" during which a permanent banner was unveiled in the Target Center honoring Saunders. A little over three years after his death, Flip's son Ryan Saunders took over as the Timberwolves' head coach following the firing of Tom Thibodeau.

On January 4, 2020, the south gymnasium at Cuyahoga Heights High School in Cuyahoga Heights, Ohio was renamed in Flip's honor. The event was attended by Flip's wife Debbie Saunders, Flip's son and former Minnesota Timberwolves head coach Ryan Saunders, other members of the Saunders' family as well as by the entire 2020 Minnesota Timberwolves basketball team.
