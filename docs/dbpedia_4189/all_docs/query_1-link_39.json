        "text": "The Kimbrough name is part of a blues dynasty, begun by the legendary Junior Kimbrough. His youngest son, Robert Kimbrough Sr. is driven to carry on his late father's hypnotic, polyrhythmic Cotton Patch Soul Blues—considered almost a genre unto itself. Here Robert reflects on losses and gains in his life and career.\n\nHe's been capturing Mississippi blues culture with his camera lens for nearly three decades. Bill Steber's images are evocative, provocative and memorable. They're also recognized worldwide. Here the acclaimed photographer, musician and artist takes on issues of race, culture, access and avocation.\n\n\"T-Model says, 'I ain't done' and pulls out this switchblade. Lightnin Malcolm told him to put that up, and Cedric Burnside knocked the blade out of his hand with drumsticks,\" recalls Sam Brand as he laughs about the craziness of that day.\n\nToday, 56 years after his birth and 18 months after his passing, David Kimbrough Jr. 3rd, remains a musical force. \"He was a blues Shaman in a sweat lodge, guiding the spirits. He had the ability to transport a roomful of people like few others,\" said friend Bill Steber after David's death in July 2019.\n\nAngie Mack Reilly lives on the Mississippi Blues Trail—in Grafton, Wisconsin...home to legendary Paramount Records. She's the closest thing Grafton has to a local blues historian, says American music journalist Amanda Petrusich. Angie has worked tirelessly since 2002 to preserve and commemorate Grafton's music legacy.\n\nThe great Delta bluesman Robert Johnson died on August 16, 1938. \"Brother Robert: Growing Up With Robert Johnson\" was released in 2020 by his \"baby sis\" with details of his life never before reported. Here we interview Elijah Wald, the Grammy award winner who wrote the foreword for this lauded book.\n\nA promotional poster of an old Delta bluesman with a National steel guitar in his lap grabbed his attention.\n\nSeeing Son House live on campus at Penn State in 1967 changed his life."
