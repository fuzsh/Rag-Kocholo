        "text": "Abduh, Muhammad\n\nMuhammad Abduh. Mark Sedgwick. Oxford: Oneworld, 2010. 152 pp. £30.\n\n\"Muhammad 'Abduh is one of the central Muslim reformers of the nineteenth century, combining political activism with his intellectual involvement in the modernist reinterpretation of the Islamic tradition in the early Salafiyya movement. As with all biographies, his life and thought are full of tensions, breaks and contradictions which this book illustrates quite well. … This book provides an accessible and concise introduction to the life and work of Muhammad 'Abduh. It is useful in teaching on modern Islam at both undergraduate and post-graduate levels. Researchers in the field gain a swift introduction to 'Abduh that incorporates the breadth of scholarship of the last decades on this eminent nineteenth-century Muslim reformer. … Instead of references, further reading suggestions are provided for each chapter in addition to a fairly up-to-date bibliography.\"\n\nOliver Scharbrodt. Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies 73.2 (2010): 320–21.\n\nAbuelaish, Izzeldin\n\nI Shall Not Hate: A Gaza Doctor's Journey. Dr. Izzeldin Abuelaish. Toronto: Random House Canada, 2010. 195 pp. $32.00.\n\n\"The strength of this book—and there are many reasons why it is one of the most affecting I have read on the subject of Israel and Palestine—is its personal angle. It tells the story of a man who grew up and raised eight children in the most densely populated, and one of the most impoverished, parts of the world: Gaza. … This gripping memoir suggests the best solutions for peace are emerging from the grassroots; time and again, politicians on both sides of the wall have let us down.\"\n\nJonathan Garfinkel. Globe and Mail, May 15, 2010: F14."
