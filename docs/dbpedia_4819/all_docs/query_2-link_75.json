All similar stories we have shared. I drove and noticed cars pulling over and I recognized there was an ambulance behind me. As it passed and they stared me through the window and cussed out on me like I was pea-brained person. Honest.. I can’t hear. When I drove out of Gallaudet gate, it was close call hitting the police man on a bike. He gestured he honked to warn me. My head shook and gestured I can’t hear him.

ASL stands strong. Skeleton keys show how ancient they were. Deaf people come by deaf generation, go to deaf residents (school), or deaf family. Maybe former Gallaudet University student and it is culture shocking. We use ASL all times on that campus.\n\nWe value or culture. See one skeleton key shows isolated or lone. Family members make decision for deaf child’ education. They might think their child has to meet their desires in speaking and hoping deaf child could fit in fair chance like hearing and normalcy.

Many deaf folks are having hard time finding jobs. Many American companies took the jobs away from USA to very cheap labor in China, Mexico, Philippines and other countries. I am a proud old man who has seen a rapid changes in America. Some good but mostly bad. However, I am quite pleased that young deaf people have or starting to have business owned (deaf owned) stores and restaurants. Even NASA has changed and now giving findings to Musk and other selfish billionaires to build their own rockets … and low wages to the rocket workers. Well two private space companies had two embarrassing rocket failures just recently. Musk lost over 40 silly internet satellites to recent sun flare. It is not NASA I used to know and work for.\n\nEnough of that. The deaf person is trying to find the set of key job opportunities but he is blind” and not able to land any high pay job. Gold key opportunities are much harder for deaf applicants to get those jobs. And of course, he is deaf and not being able to hear the bells. It is said that if a hearing person stood next to one of the big bells at Notre Dame (de Paris) Cathedral Church and it rang. He could lose all his hearing!!\n\nDAY 13 – RIVER (click image to see full artwork and advance slideshow.

It isn’t necessary to do auditory training with hearing aids or cochlear implants. It is difficult for hearing parents to understand and they play politics with “the right of options”. British and Canadian Deaf need to be educated about Alexander Graham Bell’s background banning sign language and Deaf marriages.\n\nCanadian artists designed AGB coins.\n\nGrow in Love by PDurr watercolor\n\nInspired by Betty G Miller “grow” artwork\n\nBlack background w hands signing Grow and Love\n\nPink handshape flowers with green eye lead vines come out of the top grow hand fingertips ans travel around down to the love arms Some of the vines form DNA\n\nUntitled by Dariusz Lisinski of Poland\n\nDariusz explaining his use of the dog with a bone motif https://www.facebook.com/1293143760/videos/pcb.3270352586585305/985225535429341\n\nASL Chakras by Jerry Grant (from 2016 challenge)\n\nASL styled chakra mudras.\n\nRoot, sacral, solar plexus, heart, throat, third eye and crown.

Some of us felt that we couldn’t be able to explain or express due to lack of English skills to describe the emotions or trying to detail but some hearing people were like “ oh “ and left, not trying to understand us deaf people. In the end, we gave up . A message is simply ignored.\n\nDAY 9 – Lamp (click image to see full artwork and advance slideshow. Scroll down to see info / specs / description from the artists\n\nInfo on artworks for Day 9 Lamp\n\nUzi’s Lamp by Laurie Monahan digital art inspired by Uzi Buzgalo’s art\n\nSocrates vs. Aristotle Nancy Rourke watercolor and ink 5″x5″\n\nThe motif of a lamp always has different meanings. This lamp represents as a ‘witness’ and a light shine to make things be visible.\n\nThe lamp shade is always in black colour in many of my paintings. I did a painting of Socrates vs. Aristotle in 2010 size 5 by 7 inch. https://www.nancyrourke.com/socrates.htm This sketch shows a yes and no signing going back and forth. The eyes lamp stand go back and forth watching them discussing.\n\nSocrates vs. Aristotle, 360 B.C. Socrates quoted by Plato in “Cratylus” he said “Deaf can express themselves in gestures movement.” Aristotle (384-322 BC) said “Deaf born senseless and incapable to reason.” Socrates signed “Yes, Deaf can” and Aristotle signs “No, Deaf cannot.\n\nThe Lamp (The Spot Light) by Mark Suffridge\n\nThe Lamp (The Spot Light). Some of you know my reputation as a recycling artist, meaning that I take parts of my older drawings into a new one. Most of my drawings are new but when I am in a hurry, I tend to look at my art parts that I drew in my file. Thus I recycle my old art parts into new one.\n\nThe Lamp represents the greed of the makers of CI. All the hands of the audiologists reaching out to poor deaf lady. Why the pills? To counteract the side effects of wearing CI … for the headache, for the dizziness and being moody hearing loud noises …. especially the footsteps.\n\nThe people in the back ore CEOs of CI companies, politicians, school administrators, observers and doctors. Why politicians? They are always looking for ways to cut the fundings. They are probably hoping that deafness will be the thing of the past and to close down state schools for the deaf to sell them to greedy developers.\n\nI have to be honest with you. I am now legally blind and deaf by birth. Because of my dimming and fading vision, I felt/still feel more vulnerable. For now my eye operations were successful last year but I am not out of the wood yet. I was 67 when I decided to have CI AS AN ADDED SECURITY TO MY WELL BEING. I do not believe in placing CI on babies and children who are too young to understand. Children have rights too. Personally for me, parts of my CI are already wearing out and the new parts I just got were very expensive. Highway robbery!! That is my story of The Lamp.\n\nVision by Bonita Harris mixed media 8.5″x11″\n\nDeaf humans are attracted to the lights. Yes hence.. brighter room is our field of vision.

Inspired by Katie Booth’s “The Invention of Miracles: Language, Power, and Alexander Graham Bell’s Quest to End Deafness” book. Should books about Alexander Graham Bell be banned? He was an eugenicist. He did not want Deaf to marry Deaf. He stole the idea behind the invention of the telephone. He did more harm to the Deaf. The list goes on…\n\nThe Leather Book by Charles Katz colored pencil and ink 8″x10″\n\nBook Cover by Charles Katz\n\nHello. This art work will be my first submission to the month challenge fun. I have watched and enjoyed so many art work over several years, knowing that I have something to throw. Now is the time.\n\nI decided to use “BOOK” as my first submission. The Leather Book is the title of the 11th chapter of The Deaf Child: A Mythology. This chapter focuses on the years from Stokoe’s work up to current time. Metaphorically, the leather book symbolizes the collection of research facts on ASL, DoDs, govt laws, art and literature, and more that turned the tide against oralism and audism personified by General Volt (Bell, Goldstein, and House).\n\nThe DCMyth is a “novel” in ASL (12 hours long in 139 clips). Translating all clips into English is in the works. Please note that images or motif of BOOK appears in other parts of this “saga”. In comments, I will add the art work of the cover of the book on the whole mythology. And maybe one or two more.\n\nlink to the playlist of vid clips of that chapter. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQB-qfAGy9hpAQcGDC-3TSNSgJXQwkZhM\n\nAnyone wanting to see the current draft of the electronic bilingual textbook on deaf history/studies can DM me. It will be published (on paper and electronically) someday in my lifetime BUT NEVER finalized until deaf people or sign language are eradicated\n\non this planet.

I felt so unimportant and decided to get their attention by shaking/waving my arm. I also said, “lookkkkkk at me. I’m not finished !! “ Often. Many years later, my mother called me via TDD ( just a few months before her death) to apologize for what happened during dinner times (or any where.) I was like “ what for?” Then She said she finally understood what it was like to be left out because her fiancé and friends talked in Spanish. She was lost. Her thoughts returned to the past where I was left out. I accepted her apology but it was unnecessary. Ahh!

I made this like a family tree because the challenge was started in 2012 with a 31 day in March and then on to 2014, February Challenge started.

The chopped trees signify the Deaf Jewish people who did not make it out and the trees with chopped limbs represent the non-Jewish Deaf people who were sterilized. The trees in the background on the left side represent future Deaf generations from Hilda’s tree as does the falling seed. I’m not content with how the pix came out. Hilda deserves so much more. Lily shares her family’s story in this short documentary called Exodus. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3gKrhdKmVo A few years after the film, Lily went back to Austria and learned more information about her Deaf father’s fate.

The first row, eye anticipating – most hearing parents want deaf child to speak. Second eye looking down ASL is a language. It is not broken English. Third eye encouraging ASL will gain Deaf child’s cognitive skills. The second row, first eye and third eye look at ASL as the forms of culture, sensory, and coginitive diversity. An image shows diversity. The third row, first eye knowing ASL is our primary mode of communication, second eye is like you see ASL will gain Deaf and language. Third eye looks concerns about parents’ expectations or preferences differently.\n\nLights are better for your Eyes by Laurie Rose Monahan procreate app\n\nLost in the World by Kathy Fisher-Abraham\n\nToo many things are happening in our lives.. everything is shattered in our eyes.

These were my precious memories of my late parents.\n\nUntitled by heidi storme digital work\n\nDeaf Infant by Bonita Harris ink 9″x11.5″\n\nOnce a mother gives a birth, mother finds out your infant is deaf. Most parents might get panicked or scared not knowing what to do. Just being parents and loving your deaf child.

Also, clock tells Deaf’s experience with feelings of over years and years of discrimination or oppression. We often get sick of hearing misconceptions about Deaf. We view them naive or ignorant. If I approach to a hearing person, I always see her/his speechless or clueless. I educate about Deaf culture. We always remind them we don’t want to be fixed or cure so respect us. We detest aggressive ones. We hope and fight for better education in Deaf children. We surely are happy being deaf and thinking our language is unique. We are not isolated.

This is about a Deaf oral child, language deprived with missing puzzles on the head, was trying to understand the word saying 3:45 (with yellow question marks) from the hearing adult. So, the hearing adult said, “big hand on nine and little hand on three”, and the Deaf child finally understood which is the yellow puzzle. The big hand points to the minutes (minute hand) while the little hand points to the hour (hour hand). My mother would tell me that the school bus will come at 3:45 pm and so she would say big hand at nine and little hand at three.\n\nShit Time by Jerry Grant (from 2020)\n\nMy art sums up what many have been feeling lately.\n\nOral Deaf Family by Bonnie Sandy marker 7″x10″\n\nHands of hour and minute represent only two “gestures” we used while we talked.
