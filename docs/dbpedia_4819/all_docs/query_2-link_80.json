        "text": "For my Deaf event, I went to a show at Brynn Mawr College called “Two by Twain and a Show of Hands” presented by the Nation Theatre of the Deaf. The show was separated into two acts with about five different types of skits. In Act I, A Show of Hands, the actors hid behind a curtain and stuck their hands out to sign jokes and stories. This part was a little confusing for me because they were mostly signing and at that point in the class, I was not as good as understanding the language as I am now. After this part, the actors told stories, fables, poems, puns, and more. The second act, Two by Twain, consisted of even more poems and short stories, including “The Story of the McWilliamses” and “Mrs. McWilliams and the Lightening.” For some acts, …show more content…\n\nIt was very interesting to see how quickly and smoothly the actors’ hands moved with each sign. In the parts where there was an interpreter, I learned a lot of signs very easily. The actors went through letters of the alphabet and explained how classifiers worked, manipulating their hands to show how an object is used or shaped, which was something we had discussed in class. They explained how people could do things with ASL that others cannot do with spoken words. For example, signing enables you to use letters and shapes to both spell a word and tell a story at the same time. The language involves so much expression with every part of your body, and the actors were very effective in showing how and why it is like this. They used all of their surrounding space to open their arms, move their bodies, act surprised or sad with their body language and facial expressions, and used other non-manual behaviors that we discussed in class, all to tell their story and help make meaning of …show more content…\n\nWhen the play first started, I was not sure what was going on because the signing seemed very fast and I could not follow along. For other parts of the play, the signing was so fast that I missed a lot and did not have time to even process what was being signed because it all happened to fast. At this point in the class, I also did not have enough experience to follow along and was trying to interpret in my head what the signs meant. Once the actor started interpreting, the signing was easier to follow. This experience is very similar to Mark Drolsbaugh’s from the story Deaf Again. I could not follow conversations or understand sign language, similarly to how Mark could not hear or understand the spoken language. Once someone translated though, I felt at ease, similarly to how Mark felt when he received a translator in school. Experiencing this made me realize how hard and frustrating it must be when a majority is communicating in a language that you cannot understand. It is natural to want to feel involved and want to communicate with others, but when you don’t understand what is going on, it is nearly impossible and very hard to learn. I can only imagine how a Deaf person in a language minority must feel when everyone else is communicating in spoken languages, and going to this show really helped me see the"
