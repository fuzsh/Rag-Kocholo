        "text": "Growing up with Deaf parents, Wink watched them recount their life story in American Sign Language (ASL). In 1987, Wink’s father was working nights at the post office with plans to go back to college when his life was redefined by the news that his wife’s car was hit by a train.\n\nWink’s mother’s accident framed the stories he grew up with. Looking back, he realizes just how much his parents taught him about life, hardship, love, the beauty of ASL, and the value of Deaf Culture. He witnessed firsthand ASL storytelling, being led through each scene and feeling the impact no matter how many times he’d seen the story. Those twists and turns he relived with his parents over the years have become part of him, eventually leading to the creation of My Father’s Gift. This show shares his parents’ powerful story.\n\nVisit the scene of his mother’s accident, and the confusion at the hospital. See his father fight to defend what he believed was right, no matter the cost. Peek later into Wink’s kindergarten class where, as a child of Deaf adults (CODA), he had his first introduction to the hearing world. Audiences can expect joy, frustration, sadness, and hope on this journey. Watch as Wink shares his father’s many gifts.\n\nReviews:\n\n-- “I laughed so hard my beret fell on William Stokoe's lap!” ~ Laurent Clerc\n\n-- “He truly hit a grand slam with this one” ~ “Dummy” Hoy\n\n-- “Pizza!” ~ Keith Wann\n\n-- “I’ve seen people suck before, but that was the suckiest piece of suck that ever sucked!” ~ Alexander Graham Bell\n\nPerfect for: Recovering S.E.E. signers, ignorant Alexander Graham Bell members, interpreters whose night job just got cancelled, and ASL students (no joke here, they are fragile).\n\n*No penguins are harmed during this performance"
