        "text": "This article describes the horrendous conditions under which a man (Mr Ward) died in Australia while being transported more than 220 miles by private security guards. The guards were employed by a company (GSL) which is part ofÂ G4S, a large outsourcing company with a Â£7.4 billion annual turnover. The Western AustraliaÂ State CoronerÂ found, in June 2009, that the State, the company and the workers had all contributed to Mr Wardâs death. The article also uncovers the fallacy that outsourcing aids competition between service providers which brings the cost of public services down.\n\nBy Clare Sambrook\n\nLast week in Western Australia, Graham Powell and Nina Stokoe, two former private security guards, pleaded not guilty to charges relating to the death of renowned Aboriginal elder Mr Ward, cooked to death while being transported more than 220 miles across searing Goldfields in a badly maintained van with faulty air conditioning in January 2008.\n\nPowell and Stokoeâs employer, then called GSL, is part of G4S, the outsourcing monster with a Â£7.4 billion annual turnover, which dominates the world security market. The UK is the companyâs home and a Â£1.2 billion chunk of business: G4S manages PFI deals, transports half a million prisoners a year, runs prisons and immigration detention centres (including, opening soon, the governmentâs new 'I canât believe itâs not child detention' facility at Pease Pottage near Gatwick). To G4S, our welfare state is a Â£159 billion opportunity-in-waiting, the dismantling of the NHS another exciting prospect for growth and enrichment.Â\n\nG4S, which may yet face corporate manslaughter charges here in the UK over last yearâs death of Angolan deportee Jimmy Mubenga after ârestraintâ by G4S operatives, has repeatedly tried to pin the blame for Mr Wardâs death on Powell and Stokoe alone. After the Western Australia State Coroner found in June 2009 that the State, the company and the workers had all contributed to Mr Wardâs death, Tim Hall, G4Sâs mouthpiece in Australia, insisted on national television that the companyâs procedures âwere not totally inadequate. Why this incident happened was because two officers disobeyed an instruction they were given to stop every two hours.â\n\nBut that isnât anything like the whole story. Indeed the case of Mr Ward provides a shocking glimpse behind the corporate spin, exposing shakiness in the logic that has propelled the global boom in privatisation of core public services.\n\nMr Wardâs final journey\n\nMr Ward was 46 years old when he was taken from his desert home-town of Laverton to the larger Outback city of Kalgoorlie to face a drink driving charge. He was a respected Aboriginal elder (his full name, for cultural reasons, may not be used), who had represented the Ngaanyatjarra lands within Australia and internationally. GSLâs Nina Stokoe described him to the Inquest as âa man in his 40's, 50's, Aboriginal with a dark skin. He was dirty.â\n\nAfter three and three quarter hours in the Mazda vanâs rear metal security âpodâ with slippery metal seating (facing sideways), and no air conditioning, on a day when outside temperatures soared to 40 degrees centigrade, Mr Ward died of heatstroke. He had third degree burns, most likely from contact with the searing metal floor of the van.\n\nâIt is clear that the deceased suffered a terrible death while in custody which was wholly unnecessary and avoidable,â said State Coroner Alastair Hope.\n\nA temperature monitor might have alerted Powell and Stokoe to Mr Wardâs ordeal, but there wasnât one. The CCTV didnât work properly, it hadnât worked for a long time, and this was known to company staff. A âvirtually uselessâ panic button was not marked in any way (even the police forensic officers couldnât find it), leaving Mr Ward no means to communicate his distress to the driversâ cab, to Graham Powell and Nina Stokoe who was anyway listening to her IPOD.\n\nThe company, said the Coroner, had âno written policiesâ requiring âreasonably regular physical checksâ on prisonersâ welfare. Staff testified that âthey had never been told to check the air conditioningâ. Indeed, GSLâs pre-trip checklist included no provision to note whether the air conditioning was working or not.\n\nThe ten or so security and prisoner transport staff based at GSLâs Kalgoorlie office âhad no prior security or custodial experienceâ, said Mr Hope. Their training, such as it was, had involved reading and being tested on what theyâd read, and, âthe only practical training which they had received was in the use of restraints and the use of force.â\n\nStaff knew the Mazda van was unreliable, but Stokoe testified that if she and Powell had refused the job the supervisor would have given it to someone else. The Coroner noted that it was a Sunday and Stokoe was âa casual employee who would be paid double time for the trip and she had never âknocked backâ any jobs offered to her as she believed that if she did so she might not get any further work.â\n\nSince Mr Ward was known to be âno troubleâ and âvery compliantâ, he might have been placed in the forward secure pod with padded seats and windows that could be opened when the air conditioning failed. But he wasnât, said the Coroner, due to âan arbitrary and inflexible rule of the company that all male remand prisoners taken from police lockups were to be regarded as âhigh riskâ.â\n\nStaff told the Coroner that GSL provided no water for prisoners; workers could buy it and later recoup their money, but: âAll staff said they did not bother doing this, as it was a cumbersome process.â For the trip, Mr Ward had a single 600ml bottle of water.\n\nRegarding the fog around commercial outsourcing deals the Coroner said: âPrecisely how the various proprietary companies interacted was not evident at the Inquest and it appears was not known to the Departmentâs representative . . . This case has highlighted some of the dangers associated with the privatisation of services when the state owes a non-delegable duty of care.â\n\nThe Coroner said: âAny reasonably compassionate person who viewed the prisoner pod in which the deceased was transported would be shocked.â\n\nAlarm bells ringing for years\n\nIn fact a reasonably compassionate person called Richard Harding, Western Australiaâs Inspector of Custodial Services, had viewed an identical Mazda pod more than seven years previously, and had published his misgivings in November 2001 in âReport of an Announced Inspection of Adult Prisoner Transport Servicesâ under the prescient heading: âALARM BELLS RINGINGâ.\n\nâThe locked compartment contained two inward-facing metal benches with no restraints or grab handles to prevent passengers from sliding around as the vehicle braked,â reported Harding. âThere was no natural airflow and very little natural light, for the back window was very closely grilled. The compartment was claustrophobic and cramped.â\n\nAbout the fleet that G4S was to inherit, a prison administrator told Harding: âThe vehicles are not fit for humans to be transported in. We are just waiting for a death to happen.â\n\nHarding opined that the benefits of contracting out had been tangible: âthe scope and extent of service needs have become more visible,â he said. âPersonnel, particularly police, have indeed been freed up to perform their core functions; a single provider has been able to integrate the service to a marked degree; and, for all its complexities, accountability has been very much enhanced.â\n\nBut, he said, in a paragraph that might usefully be Sellotaped to the foreheads of ministerial aides worldwide: âthe hazards have to this point offset those benefits. Divided responsibilities have enabled questions of passenger safety, dignity and reasonable comfort to be evaded. The Department and the Contractor have focused on commercial issues and have reached such a stage of mutual disillusionment that service quality is at risk, and neither party has monitored service quality in an appropriate way.â\n\nIf anyone in Australiaâs security industry had been deaf to Hardingâs alarm bells in 2001, perhaps they heard the howling sirens from the 2005 âReview of Victorian Prisoner Transportâ by the Stateâs Corrections Inspectorate, which found deficiencies in GSLâs performance including, âincomplete staff refresher training, poor record keeping, no regular reviews or updating of emergency management procedures, little adherence to servicing and maintenance. . .high breakdown levels of electronic surveillance equipment. . .compounded by poor quality vision, broken lights and âblind spotsâ, inoperative communications equipment which prevent prisoners from speaking with the driver and an inadequate emergency duress monitoring system.â\n\nAnd there was more. A federal government inquiry â known as the Hamburger Report â recorded in 2005 that GSL staff transferring five immigration detainees to the Baxter detention centre in South Australia the previous year failed to provide medical treatment for detainees âupon whom force had been used and who may have been injuredâ, failed to provide âbasic amenities including food and fluidsâ. The detainees had suffered âsensory deprivationâ, they were denied rest and exercise and their obvious distress and cries for help met with âdisregardâ. Denied access to toilet facilities, theyâd had to urinate on the floor in front of one another.\n\nRichard Harding, WAâs Inspector of Custodial Services, tried again to raise the alarm just months before Mr Wardâs death, urging yet again, in May 2007, the provision of food and water on long journeys, that âseat belts be fitted for all passengers,â that âpassenger seats to be preferably forward, or rear-facing, never sidewaysâ.Â\n\nHarding noted that the then Western Australia provider, AIMS, wanted to novate (in effect hand over) its contract âÂ with a year still to runâÂ to GSL. He opposed this âuncontested arrangementâ which âraises risksâ and âwould stifle competitonâ. The handover happened anyway, and GSL inherited AIMSâs dangerous vehicles, ill-trained staff and shoddy practices.\n\nâGovernment departments on the whole are not adept at contract management,â said Harding, âand our various reviews . . . have shown that the Department of Corrective Services is no exception.â\n\nThe alarm bells were getting louder. In July 2007 the Victorian Police Ombudsman reiterated concerns about GSL published two years previously by the Stateâs Corrections Inspectorate. Workers at a youth detention centre had complained about âthe poor state of health of young detaineesâ arriving with GSL. Food, water, toilet stops were still an issue. GSL told the Ombudsman it assumed that prisoners had âhad a meal prior to departure, or will receive a meal at the destinationâ. They were wrong about that. GSL said it did not give prisoners plastic water bottles in case they used them as weapons, urinated in them, threw them at staff.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Ward Inquest ABC Television interviewed Keith Hamburger, who had exposed GSLâs abuse of immigration detainees four years previously. ABC asked Hamburger, a career public servant who had held senior positions including Director General of Corrective Services in Queensland: âDoes it surprise you that these issues are still current years after you've written your report?â\n\nâThat's a matter of great concern,â said Hamburger, âbecause this is not rocket science, we're dealing here with duty of care.âÂ\n\nThe pressure of competition\n\nIn May 2009, G4S, describing itself as âa successful and experienced player in the Australian prison management industryâ, made a submission to New Zealand's Parliament backing a pro-privatisation bill.\n\nIt was sixteen months after Mr Wardâs death and G4S trumpeted its âwell established risk management and compliance frameworkâ, explaining it in a remarkable way: âRisk is identified, assessed and monitored through a risk management matrix and is managed through a continuous and proactive risk-based operational audit compliance programe that is both internal and external.â\n\nAll clear?\n\nThe company recycled some of privatisationâs commonly claimedÂ and frequently unchallenged virtues, including this one: âThe pressure of competition is a powerful incentive for tenderers to think of innovative ways of doing things.â\n\nIn the real world sometimes the âpressure of competitionâ is nowhere near as powerful as privatisationâs beneficiaries would have us believe. Take one eyepopping chapter in the history of G4S, formed by the merger of Group 4 and Securicor seven years ago . . .\n\nGSL had been a Group 4 subsidiary but in June 2004, just ahead of the merger, Group 4 sold GSL to two private equity firms. G4S chief executive Nick Buckles later told the Financial Times that the deal was struck âto ease the progress of the merger as there would otherwise have been competition issues over prisoner transportation.â Just three years after the sale âÂ Abracadabra! â G4S bought GSL back from the private equity people. It would âslot neatly into the next stage of G4Sâs strategy to focus on long-term government contracts,â Buckles told the FT.\n\nAlmost two years after Mr Wardâs death, and against no competition (due to âhuman errorâ the tender was not advertised) âÂ G4S was reappointed the State of Victoriaâs prisoner transport contractor.\n\nImpressing the investors\n\nThousands of miles away from scorchingly hot Kalgoorie, here in the UK G4S executives briefed financial analysts the other day. There was a slide show âÂ âCore values: Customer Focus, Expertise . . . Integrity (We can always be trusted to do the right thing)â. Director David Taylor-Smith ran through the companyâs UK business, Â£1.2 billion of it, Â£700 million with government âÂ the UK Border Agency, the Ministry of Justice, the National Offender Management Service. (Only yesterday morning G4S corporate development director Peter Neden sat in committee room 6 at the Palace of Westminster, arguing the case for âreformâ of the probation services.)\n\nâWeâre now bigger than the Scottish Prison Service and Northern Ireland Prison Service combined,â said Taylor-Smith. âSo weâre starting to get proper scale now in the UK as a kind of a credible alternative to national bodies running prisons.â\n\nThereâd been major wins in providing âfacilities managementâ for NHS hospitals: \"we do 13 acute hospitals now. So thatâs great.âÂ\n\nAbout Welfare to Work (âwhen thatâs clocked in next year that will be Â£130 millionâ), Taylor-Smith joked: âIâm just reminding those taxpayers, if there are British taxpayers in this room, Â£159 billion spent in this area of government.â G4S will be paid by results, managing subcontractors getting long term unemployed people back into work (or at any rate off the stateâs books).\n\nâWe see this as providing significant additional growth opportunities,â said Taylor-Smith, confiding: âTwo nights ago I was with [government ministers] Iain Duncan Smith, Oliver Letwin, Crispin Blunt and theyâre talking now also applying this into the prisons programmes, into drug programmes and also benefit fraud.â\n\n(It pays to get friendly with G4S. Former Labour Home Secretary John Reid was trousering G4S fees of Â£50,000 a year even before heâd left Parliament. Now Lord Reid is a G4S director.)\n\nThe analysts asked about Australia. The year after Mr Wardâs death G4S lost its contract to run Australiaâs refugee detention network and last month it lost the Western Australia court security and custodial contract as well (both pieces of business picked up by Serco).\n\nNick Buckles, who is paid Â£27,000-a-week, said of the Australian market: âWe haven't had a good run recently on care and justice because of a major incident that happened about three years ago.â\n\nBut, looking on the bright side, he said: âthere is only two or three major players, typically sometimes only two people bidding for care and justice. And with . . . our global expertise, in time we will become a winner in that market because there's a lot of outsourcing opportunities and not many competitors operating down there.â\n\nThis past April G4S pleaded guilty to failing to ensure Mr Wardâs health and safety and awaits sentencing; the maximum penalty is a Aus$400,000 fine."
