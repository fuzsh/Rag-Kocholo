        "text": "Chapter 4 focuses on the best-known animal host of plague, the rat, and the way in which it was photographically framed. Discussing examples from British India, the United States, Indonesia, Argentina, and Japan, the chapter argues that photography helped institute the rat as both a pandemic infrastructure and an agent of epistemological uncertainty: on the one hand, a species that spread and maintained plague across the globe and, on the other hand, an animal whose exact role in plague epidemics remained elusive and thus continued to fuel epistemic uncertainty, scientific research, and technological innovation in ways that integrated the globe in unprecedented ways.\n\nIt is almost impossible to find a plague-related news item today that is not accompanied by an image of a rat. The best-known carriers of zoonotic diseases, rats are so closely identified with plague that research articles about the role of other mammals in the spread or maintenance of the disease are met with enthusiasm in the media—and in some cases mistakenly hailed as exonerating rats from the spread of plague.1 This tautology between rat and plague is articulated in a context of framing an expanding range of non-human animals as hosts or vectors of infectious diseases such as influenza, Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and COVID-19.2\n\nIdentified for the first time in the 1870s and known as zoonoses (from the Greek zoon, for animal, and nosos, for disease), diseases that spread from animals to humans have formed a particular source of human anxiety since the rise of the emerging infectious diseases framework in the early 1990s.3 This has come to understand viral spillovers (i.e., interspecies jumps between nonhuman animals to humans) as potential sources of a future global catastrophic pandemic among what would presumably be a “virgin,” non-immune human population. Historians and anthropologists have dedicated much effort to elucidate and deconstruct the philosophical, epistemological, and biopolitical premises behind this pandemic imaginary, which has transformed animal-human contact into a perilous zone of interaction that could even lead to human extinction.4 In this imaginary, the rat plays a backstage role as an ancient foe that, while posing no direct existential risk to humanity, reminds us of the devastation brought about when zoonotic hosts are not scientifically understood and controlled.\n\nThe current status of rats should not, however, obscure their historical importance in the emergence of the image of nonhuman animals as epidemic villains and in the rise and dissemination of the notion of the pandemic. Contrary to popular perceptions, before the end of the nineteenth century rats were not believed to be carriers or spreaders of plague or any other infectious disease.5 If rats had long been considered to be “vermin” damaging to property and consuming or spoiling food resources, their only redeeming characteristic was widely believed to be their supposed disease-free nature.6 Hence while mid-seventeenth-century plague treatises noted the rat’s destructive impact on clothing and food, no mention of its connection with the disease was made.7\n\nTwo hundred years later, when in the 1840s British colonial officers in India observed that at the first sight of rat epizootics Garhwali villagers fled to the Himalayan foothills in fear of the “Mahamari” disease, they first dismissed this behavior as superstitious and then deduced that rats, like humans in the region, succumbed to excessively “vitiated” air.8 Indeed, the rat was considered to be uniquely able “to ‘clean’ and preserve itself from contamination by the filth and miasma of the sewer.” 9 Neil Pemberton notes that, “rather than being correlated with plague, the sewer rat’s appetite for putrefying matter saved human inhabitants from ‘periodical plagues,’ which [James] Rodwell insisted were the ‘result of deadly gases arising out of the putrefaction of animal and vegetable matter.’”10 Until the final decade of the nineteenth century, in Euro-American and colonial contexts the rat problem was seen not as a source of infection but as an issue of food destruction and of boundaries and their transgression, including the unwarranted nocturnal wonderings of the rat into private and familial spaces and its “invasive,” transnational character.\n\nScientists only began to study the rat’s ability to carry and spread diseases after the inaugural outbreak of the third plague pandemic in Hong Kong (1894).11 Tacitly mentioned by the discoverer of the plague bacillus, Alexandre Yersin, the potential role of the rat first acquired a central place in epidemiological frameworks of plague in British India.12 This marked the start of a biopolitical and epistemological transformation of the rat from “vermin” to “host/vector” and, at the same time, from a nuisance to modern history’s paradigmatic epidemic villain. Rather than being a sudden revelation, the transformation of the rat into Public Enemy No. 1 was mediated by intense scientific debate and was facilitated by the rat presenting itself as a quantifiable and universally recognizable object of hygienic intervention.13\n\nOver the first half of the twentieth century, an extraordinary effort to study and control rats and their contact with humans was undertaken on a global scale—what the English rat-expert Boetler called “a world’s war against the rat.” 14 This was a goal that was conceivable only within a pandemic framework and in turn further fostered the idea of the pandemic as a scientifically knowable and actionable threat to humanity. Combining techniques and technologies of epidemic control derived from a number of medical and sanitary traditions and backed by relevant laws and decrees, the global war against the rat focused on its eradication and isolation from humans.15\n\nThis was an effort not confined to cities or ports but also employed in the trenches of World War I and in rural areas where rats spread disease not only to humans but, as epidemiologists were terrified to discover, also to wild rodents, which were in turn transformed into long-term endemic disease reservoirs.16 Responding to this public-health menace and to the economic losses caused by rats as a result of food destruction (marking a damage of $200 million in 1917 for the United States alone) as well as by halting trade as a result of quarantines, anti-rat operations rapidly spread across the globe.17\n\nOften assuming the form of public health “campaigns,” the global war against the rat involved rat-proofing buildings and infrastructures, rat destruction by means of predators, poisons, viruses, and chemical gases, and the deployment of professional and civic bodies of rat-catchers.18 These operations assumed different guises in different colonial and metropolitan contexts, becoming entangled with class and racial narratives as well as with imperial, national, and local political and economic agendas.19\n\nCentral to scientific studies of rats and public health measures against them were questions regarding the way in which rats harbor and transmit diseases. Most important were questions about the link between disease epidemics among rats (epizootics) and human illness, including the extent to which rats functioned as disease reservoirs and how the migratory or “inva-sive” behavior of different rat species (especially Rattus rattus and Rattus norvegicus) impacted the spread of diseases. These questions were developed and debated in hundreds of scientific publications and numerous conferences, including the International Sanitary Conventions between 1903 and 1938, two international conferences on the rat (1928 and 1931), and through on-the-ground experience in the course of practical processes of rat control.20 Investing on long-standing understandings of the interaction between rats and humans but also unsettling these through new medical and epidemiological frameworks of infection, these questions fostered extensive international exchange on the scientific and public health aspects of what the leading Pasteurian Albert Calmette called the “global scourge” of the rat.21 Collaboration and antagonism on the subject were developed within and across nations, empires, and scientific schools.22"
