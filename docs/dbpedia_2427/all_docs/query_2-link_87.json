Epact ... x Roman Indiction . . 3 Solar Cycle ... 25 Julian Period . . 6633 The DOMINICAL OR SUNDAY LETTER for any year is that one of the first seven letters of the Alphabet which stands opposite the first Sunday of the year, when the first letter of the Alphabet is placed opposite the first day of the year, the second letter opposite the second day, and so on. It is obvious that if these seven letters be repeated in order opposite the remaining days of the year, the same letter which stood opposite the first Sunday will stand opposite every succeeding Sunday. Hence the use of the Dominical Letter in the Calendar is to indicate the days of the month on which the Sundays will fall in the different years. Leap years have two Dominical \"Letters, one of which indicates the Sundays during the months of January and February ; the other during the remaining months. The Dominical Letters for the present year are D and C. The GOLDEN NUMBER of a given year is the number which indicates the place of that year in the lunar cycle. This cycle is a period of nineteen years, and is called the LUNAR CYCLE because in every nine- teenth year the different lunar phases — new moon, full moon, etc. — happen on the same days of the month, though about one hour and a half earlier in the day. It is also called the METONIC CYCLE, from the name of its discoverer, Meton, an Athenian astronomer, who published his discovery at the Olympic games celebrated in the year^ 432 B.O. The first year of the Christian era is regarded as the second year of the current lunar cycle ; hence we have the following rule for finding the Golden Number of any given year : — Add 1 to the date of the year, and divide the sum by 19 ; the remainder is the Golden lumber. If there is no remainder, the Golden Number is 19. The Golden Number for the present year found by this rule is 2. For 1920+ 1-f- 19 = The EPACT of any year is the number which represents in days the age of the moon on the 1st January of that year. One lunar month according to the Ecclesiastical Calendar contains 29£ days. Twelve lunar months, therefore, contain 354 days. Hence if the first day of a lunar month coincides with the 1st January of a particular year, that moon's age on the next 1st January (supposing the year to be a common one) mil be 365 — 354, or 11 days. This number, 11, is then the Epact of that second year. For the third year of this series the Epact will be 2 (365 — 354), or 22; for 'the fourth year, 3 (365 — 354), or 33. But when the Epact is equal to or exceeds 30, a month is introduced or intercalated, and the Epact of the year is the remainder after deducting 30. For the fourth year .of the above series, therefore, the Epact will be 3, instead of 33. XXII.

It has no connection with any ecclesiastical feasts or religious observances, and was first employed, it is believed, by Constantino the Great. The Indiction continued to be employed for centuries by Popes and Emperors as a convenient method of reckoning time and of expressing dates. The point of departure of the Indictions was fixed by Pope Gregory VII. (1073-1085) to be the first day of the year 313 A.D. Reckoning backwards we find that the year 1 A.D. was the fourth year of the current Indiction. Hence to find the place of any year of the Christian Era in the current Cycle of Indiction we have but to add 3 to the date of the year in question and divide the sum by 15. The present year is, therefore, the third of the current Indiction. For THE SEASONS, 1920. MARCH. — Spring Quarter begins March 20. JUNE. — Summer Quarter begins June 21.

Cone., 24th January, 1918). In Ireland, flesh-meat is allowed at the principal meal on the Saturdays of Quarter Tense (outside of Lent) and on Vigils, which immediately precede or follow a Friday or other day of abstinence (Indult of Congr. of Council, 31st July, 1912). On Holy Saturday, the obligation of Fast and Abstinence ceases at mid-day. All the week-days of Lent, except those mentioned above, are days of Fast without Abstinence. All Fridays are days of Abstinence. If a Holiday of Obligation falls on a day of Abstinence or Fast, outside of Lent, the obligation of Abstinence or Fast is removed. On St. Patrick's Day the obligation of Fast and Abstinence is also removed (Congr Cone. 13 May, 1919). EMBER DAYS. The Ember Days or Quarter Tense are three days in each quarter of the year which are set apart by the Church for fasting and special supplication. The Ember Days are always the Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday — • (a) Next after the 1st Sunday of Lent for the Spring Quarter. (6) Next after Whit Sunday for the Summer Quarter. (c) Next after the Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross (14th Sept.) for the Autumn Quarter. (d) Next after the Third Sunday of Advent for the Winter Quarter. The dates of the Ember Days in the current year are as follows : — SPRING. Wednesday, 25th February. Friday, 27th February. Saturday, 28th February. SUMMER. Wednesday, 26th May. Friday, 28th May.

The Rogation Days will occur this year on Monday, 10th May. | Wednesday, 12th May. Tuesday, llth May. XXV111.

It is important that all who have property to bequeath, or instruction* to give for the Catholic education of their children, should mako their wills while their health and faculties are unimpaired. Instead of trusting in printed forms and directions, it is always better to obtain the help of an experienced lawyer. A will must be written in irikr on paper or parchment. It must be signed at the end by the testator,. in the presence of two or more witnesses, and he should, after signing. it, take it in his hands and say : \" I acknowledge this to be my last will and testament, and request you to witness it.\" The witnesses (who must be parties not interested in the will) will then sign in the presence of the testator, and of each other, writing fully and clearly their name, surname, residence and trade or profession, etc. It is not absolutely necessary for the witnesses to know the contents of a will. Obliterations and alterations should be avoided, and whei* they are necessary should be signed by the testator and witnesses. CATHOLIC PEERS OF DUKES. Norfolk (Eng.)
