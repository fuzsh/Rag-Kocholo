        "text": "Legend behind the name: The Destruction of Humanity & 7000 Jars of Beer\n\nBeer goes back a very long way. Even in the days when humanity was subject to raging tempers of earth trotting gods, yeast busily worked its way through vats of malty liquor to produce, what we now call, beer.\n\nâ€¦and so it was in Ancient Egypt, when the aging Sun God Ra summoned his daughter Hathor to task her with bringing some discipline upon the ignorant and disrespectful bunch the lowly humans had become, that Hathor, the ever agreeable Goddess of Joy transformed into her counterpart; Sekhmet The Destroyer, in order to stand up to the task. Sekhmet, however, was the very opposite of Hathor and before long her idea of discipline looked increasingly like mission creep as hundreds lay slain in her wake and the fields of Egypt were drenched in the blood of earthlings. Sensing Sekhmet was going way off script in terms of body count and method Ra instructed his chief priest to brew up vats of beer and dye them red with ochre hoping that Sekhmet would mistake it for human blood and drink herself into a stupor. 7000 jars of blood-red beer were poured over the fields and Sekhmet, unable to resist the sweet malty aroma of a fresh brew, drank it up and fell into a deep sleep."
