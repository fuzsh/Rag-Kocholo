Please register for the Waitlist via Eventbrite.\n\nYou may be interested in attending another of our Summer School 2024 courses, please check out the other courses on offer.\n\n—\n\nDates: 15-19 July 2024\n\nTime: 10:00-17:00\n\nFee: £560\n\nLevel: Beginners\n\nTutor: Eloise Dethier-Eaton\n\nSHORT COURSE OVERVIEW\n\nThis decorative surfaces course covers paper marbling techniques ranging from basic patterns to intricate designs, followed by trompe-l’oeil techniques to mimic natural materials like marble and stone on wooden surfaces. With guidance, participants will acquire a versatile toolkit of decorative painting techniques for applications in their own creative practice.\n\nCOURSE DESCRIPTION\n\nIn this course, you will firstly learn the art of paper marbling, a mesmerising process where patterns are achieved by dropping liquid paint on a surface of thickened water. At its simplest, this creates a delightful arrangement of blobby shapes, but various tools can also be used to create more intricate patterns. You will learn how to prepare all the materials so that you can later replicate this process in your own practice.\n\nYou will then work through a whole range of paper marbling techniques, from basic patterns such as Italian Vein and Swirls, through to more sophisticated ones like Nonpareil, Bouquet, Spanish Wave and Double Marble. Finally, using the marbled papers you have made, you will upcycle an unassuming shoebox into a striking item for your home.\n\nIn the second half of the week, you will use illusionistic techniques known as trompe-l’oeil (meaning ‘tricking the eye’) to mimic materials found in nature, like marble and stone. By layering abstract shapes directly onto wooden board surfaces with traditional tools and brushes, you will paint faux malachite, marble and onyx veining.\n\nThis course will set you up with the toolkit to apply these techniques in many different contexts, from fine art to interior design, set design and restoration – or wherever your imagination takes you. This experimental course will be process-based as you explore these techniques with City & Guilds of London Art School’s current Decorative Surfaces Fellow Eloise Dethier-Eaton.\n\nAbout your tutor\n\nEloise Dethier-Eaton’s multidisciplinary practice includes painting, printmaking and paper marbling. Eloise studied a BA in Fine Art & History of Art at Goldsmiths. In 2019-20, she did an apprenticeship in paper marbling, bookbinding and business administration. She graduated from an MA in Fine Art at City & Guilds of London Art School in 2023, before being awarded the Decorative Surfaces Fellowship at the School with the support of the Worshipful Company of Painter-Stainers.\n\nWhat’s included: all teaching and materials.\n\nWhat isn’t included: meals/refreshments. Please remember to bring snacks, water, a notebook, and a pen.\n\n10% discount available for City & Guilds of London Art School students, alumni and staff. Contact summerschool@cityandguildsartschool.ac.uk to receive the discount code.\n\nRobin Mason leaves the Art School\n\nAfter many years of dedicated contribution, Robin Mason, Head of Fine Art, will be leaving the Art School in March 2024.\n\nCity & Guilds of London Art School’s Board of Trustees extend their deep gratitude to Robin for his excellent leadership of the Fine Art department over many years.\n\nRobin studied Fine Art at Wolverhampton winning the Northern Young Contemporaries. Following his MA in Painting at The Royal College of Art he established a studio in London. He has continued to exhibit nationally and internationally and his work can be found in public, significant private and corporate collections including those of Unilever and the Government Art Collection.\n\nRobin joined City & Guilds of London Art School in 2000 as Lead Painting Tutor before becoming the Head of Fine Art, overseeing the existing BA course and launching the then brand-new MA Fine Art programme. In this time Robin developed the Fine Art courses in to the most challenging and creative courses students can choose to study. Encompassing contemporary and historical skills, theories and materials; art histories; visual and contextual research; entrepreneurship and project management.\n\nRobin has led a team with a distinctly nurturing approach, that has always been appreciated by students for genuinely taking time to support and challenge them in all these areas, enabling students to achieve exceptional results and move on to professional practice or further study with confidence and experience. His and his team’s belief in no ‘house style’; has ensured that with focus and ambition, all Fine Art students can fully explore ways of making and thinking, and develop their own artistic ‘voice’.\n\nRobin leaves the Art School with a legacy of teaching fit for its committed and talented students to continue to produce incredible work and ready for an exciting future.\n\nWords shared by students and alumni:\n\n“Robin, you made City & Guilds of London Art School the beautiful place it is, and we can’t thank you enough. We will all look back with the happiest memories; the projects, the community, the atmosphere. Thank you for also being supportive in my personal decisions while at the school. You made everyone feel so comfortable and cared for, and your gentle and lovely manner is invaluable. Wishing you all the best post C&G – keep making amazing art and being a wonderful person!”\n\nIris McConnell, Y3 BA (Hons) Fine Art\n\n“Robin, Thank you for everything. I cannot deny the role you have played in my decision to stay in London and give this whole art thing a try. You offered your help, with a special ability to know when it was needed the most. It made all the difference. It was a few years later that I learned, through sharing experiences with other students, that you had managed to do so for all of us. This is a rare unique quality that very few people have, the rest of us can only try. I am certain you will continue to inspire people in your next chapter and I wish you all the best. With loads of gratitude, Natalia”\n\nNatalia Gonzalez Martin, 2017, BA (Hons) Fine Art: Painting\n\n“Robin, I wanted to let you know how grateful I am that during my time at CGLAS you were the Head of Fine Art. Thank you so much for being there for all of us during the challenging times, for all the feedback, guidance and support. I think a lot about how all of my achievements as an artist post-graduation were a direct link to being on the BA course that you have structured so well. Thank you for supporting all of my crazy painting ideas through the years, allowing me to grow and seeing my potential when I didn’t even know it existed. I’m beyond grateful to have been taught and creatively guided by you. I wish you and your family all the best! Thank you so much again.”\n\nAysha Nagieva, 2021, BA (Hons) Fine Art\n\nDr Lois Rowe, Principal, would like to thank Robin for his enormous impact on Fine Art, the School and our wider community, and to wish him the very best for his future endeavours.\n\nThe whole Art School community thanks Robin for his dedication over many years and wishes him well.\n\nWe look forward to seeing his future projects and welcoming him back as our friend to Art School’s events.\n\nCity & Guilds of London Art School (CGLAS) will launch recruitment for a new Course Leader in Summer 2024.\n\nCurrent job opportunities can be viewed HERE\n\nThank you\n\nThank you for entering the Protect the Arts – Fundraising Raffle.\n\nEach £5 donation entitles the donor to one ticket/entry in the raffle.

At the moment, I’m working on a series of prints of medieval carved wooden figures seen in Paris earlier this year, using a crossover of disciplines – monotype, silk screen and soft pastel.\n\nAs the Silk Screen Fellow, I’m delighted to be working alongside the wonderful Niamh Clancy who was a great advisor and inspiration whilst I was a student. The upstairs print studio became my home during the year of study and I encourage students of any discipline to come and visit!\n\nOpen House Festival 2023\n\nCity & Guilds of London Art School is delighted to be part of the Open House Festival 2023 during our MA Show (2-9 Sept).

Members chose different motifs to sketch from to help inspire the designs we are working on for our coats of arms.\n\nWe then walked down the river to Two Temple Place, where we were able to see the impressive historic craftsmanship on display on the stone carved facade and the woodcarved interiors, currently showing contemporary art exhibition “Inside”.\n\nWe are most grateful to both of the teams that look after these special buildings for sharing the magic of these spaces and their stories with us!\n\nInterested in applying for our 2023/24 Saturday Club? To find out more about the Club and how to apply, sign up to our Club mailing list.\n\nExperimenting with clay, alginate and plaster\n\nThis week, our National Saturday Club members progressed to an exciting next stage of their project, preparing and practicing for woodcarving using clay. This involved modelling in clay to create three dimensional artworks, which has prepared them for carving in wood.\n\nThe members experimented with casting processes using alginate and plaster to get a sense of scale in texture and form, guided by Tutor Sarah Davis, and assisted by Second Year BA Carving: Woodcarving & Gilding student, Henry Brown.\n\nOur members are now almost ready to generate their final design of their coats of arms which they will carve in wood.\n\nTo help them decide which elements of this heritage object they’ll be including in their contemporary designs, they will be finding inspiration on an upcoming trip to Fishmonger’s Hall and Two Temple Place. Keep an eye out for updates on their designs!\n\nInterested in applying for our 2023/24 Saturday Club?

From 2018- 2021 Magnus was the Director of City & Guilds Art School Property Trust, which manages the properties occupied by the Art School. Magnus’ remit as Director, City & Guilds Art School Property Trust, encompassed the ongoing planning and delivery of the Art School’s Masterplan, as well as other strategic fundraising activity.\n\nMagnus was instrumental in the development and roll out of the Art School’s Masterplan since 2008, improving the campus and facilities as well as establishing additional support for the student bursary programme which now provides around 40% of undergraduate students with bursaries towards tuition fees, to ensure all those with the commitment and potential to be offered a place are able to take it up.\n\nMagnus leaves the Art School with facilities fit for its talented students and staff to continue to produce incredible work and ready for an exciting future.\n\nThe whole Art School and the Board of Trustees thank Magnus for his dedication over many years and wish him well in all his future endeavours. We look forward to welcoming him back as our friend to Art School’s events for many years to come.\n\nBelow are just some of the major projects Magnus delivered and secured funding support for over 13 years:\n\nPHASE 1 (2010-2014)\n\nThe renovation of the Art School row of six Grade 2 listed Georgian terrace buildings on Kennington Park Road, was completed in 2014 after five consecutive summers of work. Through Phase 1 we were able to refurbish and enlarge 35 studios; carry out a full upgrade of the Conservation Department; create the expanded Library, new seminar and meeting rooms, and install new lighting and centralised heating throughout.\n\nNEW FOUNDATION SPACES IN THE OLD VAUXHALL TELEPHONE EXCHANGE (2012)\n\nAnother important development connected to Phase 1 took place in 2012 with the relocation of the Foundation Department to the Old Vauxhall Telephone Exchange, a disused 1930s building adjacent to the Art School. This large space of 6,000 square feet was turned into flexible, multipurpose studios with workshop facilities and a lecture space, transforming the quality of facilities for the Foundation Department.\n\nPHASE 2 (2015-2017)\n\nFollowing on seamlessly from Phase 1, an extremely generous pledge from the Hamish Parker Charitable Trust funded the creation of a new entrance for the Art School, and a striking covered atrium space between the Georgian terrace and the studio buildings.\n\nBEYOND PHASE 2\n\nStone and Woodcarving Studios Renovation (2018-2019)\n\nWith the works completed in Summers of 2018 and 2019, this project equipped the Carving department with facilities that match the excellence and reputation of its then newly validated BA and MA courses, which are unique in this country and play a significant role in keeping alive specialist craft skills central to the preservation of important cultural heritage in the UK and internationally.\n\nBooks & Paper Conservation Studios (2020)\n\nIn Autumn 2020, the Art School launched its new undergraduate course in Books & Paper Conservation, after reaching an ambitious fundraising target to create and equip a suite of specialist Conservation Studios in its Georgian terrace. Named the Foyle Books & Paper Conservation Studios in recognition of the Foyle Foundation’s significant funding support for this and past studio and facilities development projects at the Art School. The project also encompassed the creation of new MA Fine Art Studios allowing relocation to another area onsite. The works were successfully completed, despite restrictions caused by the current pandemic.\n\nPHASE 3\n\nPlanning permission was granted in 2018 for the final phase of the evolution of the 2008 Masterplan. In 2023 the Art School is reviewing the current needs of the Art School to ensure its plans for the site continue to reflect its ambitions for the future and the priorities of its 2022-27 Strategic Plan.\n\nGilding work continues\n\nThis week, National Saturday Club Members continued to refine their Verre églomisé practice, lead by Tutor Sarah Davis, and assisted by Second Year BA Carving: Woodcarving & Guilding student, Henry Brown.\n\nUsing a range of resources, Members drew imagined beasts that reflected them as individuals, before drafting them onto larger glass panes, prepared through the Verre églomisé process using 24 carat gold leaf sheets.\n\nThese designs will be set in their wooden crests that they will begin to carve at the end of this term – keep an eye out for updates on their work!\n\nInterested in applying for our 2023/24 Saturday Club?

Trustees were pleased to celebrate the news that validating partner Ravensbourne University London had conferred the title of Professor Emerita in recognition of Tamiko’s long and distinguished career in Higher Education, her pedagogic and practice based research as well as her leadership at City & Guilds of London Art School. Read more HERE\n\nAt the event Tamiko spoke with conviction and warmth about her time at the Art School and how honoured she felt to have worked with such extraordinary colleagues and students. In all of her years working in Higher Arts education, she had not previously come across such a strong sense of community and shared purpose. She felt that this drive and commitment came from the strong focus on teaching by professionally active practitioners and that this had been core to the way the Art School had responded to the pandemic. After reflecting on memorable instances where staff members had acted ‘above and beyond’ with ingenuity, generosity and personal dedication, she spoke of her admiration for colleagues and students and her gratitude to the trustees and the wider community of friends who had supported the Art School over the years.\n\nCity & Guilds of London Art School’s Board of Trustees extend their deep gratitude to Tamiko for her excellent leadership and for her skill in steering the Art School through the particular challenges of recent times. They look forward to her future engagement with the Art School.\n\nTamiko is succeeded by Dr Lois Rowe, who took up the post of Art School Principal in September 2022.\n\nThe Art School is grateful to the Fishmongers’ Company for their generosity in hosting the lunch together with their ongoing support, including funding towards the Art School’s widening participation initiatives.\n\nLeft to right: Tamiko O’Brien; close up of brooch; brooch completed in Tom Ball’s carving studio.\n\nCopyright: City & Guilds of London Art School 2022 and Tom Ball Carving, 2022.\n\nSummer School 2023 is open for bookings!\n\nThe Art School’s 2023 Summer School programme is now open for bookings, with an early bird discount available until midnight on Tuesday 3 January 2023.\n\nView the Summer School 2023 programme here.\n\nThe Summer School programme, which runs over a three-week period from 3-21 July 2023, is a collection of short courses for adults (18+), focusing on the historic craft skills and contemporary fine art skills taught on the undergraduate and postgraduate courses at the Art School.

It was a delight to come together and celebrate our NSC member’s achievements and be joined by representatives of those who have supported the launch of the project: the Fishmongers’ Company and City & Guilds Foundation. We were also joined by our friends at QEST and NSC who have recently partnered to form the new Craft&Making strand of NSC programming, of which we are extremely proud to be a part of.\n\nIt’s been a term of drawing, painting, printing and gilding – next term, we’ll be taking on casting and starting to explore wood carving, preparing to design and create a coat of arms that represents how we understand ourselves, under the theme of “identity”.\n\nThank you to all the CGLAS students that were on site for the event to talk to members and guests about their practice and answer questions about the courses and their work.\n\nSELECTED HIGHLIGHTS FROM THIS TERM\n\nInterested in applying for our 2023/24 Saturday Club?

It can be used to overlay, accentuate and transform a monochrome work.\n\nInterested in applying for our 2023/24 Saturday Club?

What happens when we pair a Barbie pink with a scab-like crust, or a mud brown with a high gloss shine?\n\nThe students brought their own phrase to make an abstract painting from – sources varied from poetry, film, tv and music. Together we began to question harmonies, contrasts, paintings that shout and paintings that whisper.\n\nInterested in applying for our 2023/24 Saturday Club?

The other hosts include City of Oxford College and MAKE Southwest. The network will increase to ten Clubs by 2025.\n\nThis new National Saturday Club programme aims to introduce young people from across the UK to the world of craft and making, creating valuable opportunities for them to develop their creativity and practical skills. Club members will work with varied materials, such as wood, ceramics, glass, metal, and textiles, and will gain an understanding of the importance of retaining traditional craft\n\npractice, whilst ensuring that these skills and materials evolve and remain relevant in the modern world.\n\nThe National Saturday Club programme is free and open to 13–16-year-olds of all abilities. The Art School’s Saturday Club gives Members the rare opportunity to use traditional skills to make a series of hand-crafted artworks with a contemporary twist! Club Members will design their own coat of arms, featuring objects and symbols that demonstrate what’s most important to them. Over the course of the Club, they will learn an exciting range of techniques including etching, casting in plaster, gilding with gold leaf onto glass and carving in wood. They will take part in a Masterclass with a leading industry professional, visit a museum or gallery and exhibit their final artwork in the Summer Show at Somerset House. Visit our Club blog to see what Members have already been learning.\n\nArt School Saturday Club Members with Print Fellow Kristina Chan in our historic Print Room\n\nThrough the Craft&Making programme, Club members will be introduced to a wide range of careers in heritage and conservation, the built environment, and the creative industries. QEST and the National Saturday Club will engage with cultural organisations and industry, and will develop practitioner partnerships to support and enrich the new programme, supporting Club tutors and providing inspirational opportunities for the young people.\n\nDr Lois Rowe, Principal of City & Guilds of London Art School, said: “We are thrilled that the Art School’s Saturday Club has been chosen as part of the pilot for the National Saturday Club’s new Craft&Making programme. We are the only higher education provider in the UK specialising in the teaching of historic craft skills at degree level. We are committed to educating the next generations of crafts specialists and are delighted that through our collaboration with the National Saturday Club, we can offer local young people the opportunity to develop a passion for these endangered skills.”\n\nLucy Kennedy, Chief Executive of the Saturday Club Trust said: “We are delighted to be partnering with QEST to launch the Craft&Making Saturday Club, the seventh subject within the National Saturday Club programme. This programme will be vital in introducing young people to the breath of opportunities open to them within the world of craft and making, opportunities which are\n\ncurrently not visible within the mainstream curriculum. The programme will impart valuable practical skills which could lead onto rewarding careers and will support them to consider future study in the sector. At a time when we see many craft and making subjects, practices and skills declining nationally, it is even more important that young people have the opportunity to discover and be inspired by them at a pivotal moment in their progression.”\n\nDeborah Pocock LVO, CEO at QEST said: “We are really excited about the potential for this new partnership to inspire and encourage young people of all backgrounds across the UK to explore their creativity and hand-making skills. We hope that the Craft&Making Club will provide transformational opportunities for young people to build their skills, develop confidence and discover clear pathways of progression into craft-based occupations, unlocking hidden talents and growing a new generation of professional craftspeople and makers.”\n\nIf you are interested in applying to take part in the Art School’s 2023/24 Saturday Club, sign up to our mailing list and we will send you Club updates and 2023 application details.\n\nThe Art School is most grateful to those donors whose generous support has made our National Saturday Club possible: City & Guilds Foundation , Fishmongers’ Company\n\nLearning the emotional language of colour\n\nIn the past two weeks, Club Members have been working in smaller groups, alternating between two different workshops.\n\nIn our last blog, we visited Members discovering new talents in our Print Room, where tutor Kristina Chan taught the traditional process of soft ground etching on our historic printing press.\n\nMembers have also been exploring the emotional language of colour with tutor Kate Dunn!\n\nIn Kate’s workshops, Members used the colour wheel and words to interpret how emotions are held within colours. Club Members wrote a word on a piece of paper and submitted them anonymously. Everyone was then given a word at random from this collection to respond to through the format of an abstract painting.\n\nThe opening question for this session was: ‘If I told you I woke up feeling yellow this morning, how do you imagine I felt?‘\n\nInterested in applying for our 2023/24 Saturday Club?

Because the ground, or ‘wax’ is ‘soft’, this type of etching allows for a wide variety of mark making.\n\nStudents worked on zinc plates to create multi-tonal prints. In their second session, we will introduce colour into the mix!\n\nIn our next blog, we’ll share Members’ experiences experimenting with colour!\n\nInterested in applying for our 2023/24 Saturday Club?

All proceeds will go to the Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal.\n\nThe prints contained in this beautiful 10″ x 10″ boxed one-off set are all from editions of 20 and were made by artists who have worked in the City & Guilds of London Art School Print Room, either as a Tutor or Print Fellow, between 2017 and 2020.\n\nThe Art School’s traditional etching and engraving room was established by artist and master printmaker Jason Hicklin under Professor Norman Ackroyd in 1998, with the first Printmaking Fellowships taking place shortly after. The Fellowship offers artists who have a commitment to printmaking, and who have completed an MA in art making, a chance to continue developing their practice within the Art School’s lively atmosphere. Fellows also have the opportunity to gain teaching and technician experience with students enrolled across Foundation, BA, and MA courses while being supported by a dedicated team of tutors and professional staff. The Box Set works to represent the results of the Art School’s vibrant programme — for example Rachel Goodison completed her MA at the Art School prior to applying for a Fellowship position. Fellowship alumni, such as Blaze Cyan and Chris Roantree, have also returned as Tutors following additional periods of professional practice.\n\nFrom 1998 to the present day twenty-three individuals have held the post of Print Fellow.\n\nUnfortunately, professional practices across the UK were presented with unprecedented challenges due to Covid-19, and these artists’ practices are without exception. As a mode of cultural production, printmaking requires very specific industrious equipment that often cannot be reproduced in the domestic sphere. The Box Set works were meticulously crafted between three national lockdowns when Covid safety regulations allowed.\n\n“This project allowed me to escape into a world of metal, acid and inks helping to understand the situation we have come to find ourselves in.” — Jemma Gunning\n\nYet many of the works presented took inspiration from this new found collective condition. Jemma Gunning, for example, sketched during daily isolation walks; later responding to these sketches creating a haunting urban environment. Blaze Cyan’s work also draws upon ideas of haunting through the depiction of the raven as a harbinger of death, and invoking Edgar Allan Poe’s ‘The Raven’ wherein the narrator laments the loss of his love Lenore, echoing lost loved ones at the hands of Covid-19. Animality and environment feature in other works as well. Drawing inspiration from a 2019 artist residency in Australia’s Blue Mountains at a time when bushfires reached their peak, Kristina Chan depicts the tentative balance between the land, natural disaster, and human impact. Also invoking themes of history and time, Catherine Greenwood collaborated with a composer during the first national lockdown, connecting ancient landscape and human interaction through print and music in a duration of turbulence. Kathryn Graham focuses on walls; all encompassing and all surrounding. She explores the blur of boundaries between interior and exterior space.\n\nThe full set of images and documentation will be exhibited at Woolwich Contemporary Print Fair 2023, and artists can be contacted through their details afterwards for information on purchasing individual prints from the larger edition.\n\nArtist Biographies:\n\nEdward Adlington\n\nEdward Adlington (b. 1983) London-trained, Philadelphia-based printmaking artist and teacher.\n\nEd moved to Pennsylvania USA in 2020 and is currently working as an artist and Art Teacher from being a Print tutor 2018-2020 at the Art School and a research Fellow 2014-15 also working at Putney School of Art, London.

More precisely, I want to be a craftsman or an artisan focusing on making prints. Ozu Yasujiro is my favourite movie director, and probably my favourite artist. In an interview, he once said, “I only know how to make tofu. I can make fried tofu, boiled tofu, stuffed tofu. Cutlets and other fancy stuff, that’s for other directors.” Because he spent his entire career to make nothing else but “tofu”, he made the best “tofu”. Ozu probably did not consider himself as an artist, but a craftsman who repeatedly practiced the same craft until he reached perfection. This is what I want to be – a tofu maker; a craftsman in printmaking. Except through practicing the same craft repetitively and constantly, I do not know any other way to achieve perfection.\n\nhttps://band1009.wixsite.com/waiwongprints\n\n@whywrongwrong\n\nKeeping you safe\n\nAs we continue to move away from the disruption caused by the pandemic, we want to reassure current and future students that we remain committed to providing the best standards of education and care, alongside the highest levels of health and safety precautions, so that you are able to thrive and excel, and get the very best out of your time studying at the Art School.\n\nIf we are required to practise Covid-19 safety measures in the future, we will respond in much the same way as we have during the previous two years.\n\nSince the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, one of our top priorities, alongside the safety and wellbeing of students and staff, has been to maintain the high standards of specialist education we are known for and that our students expect and deserve. Even when the nation was in the tightest grip of the pandemic, we were not only determined to continue delivering the highest quality of courses, but strived to ensure our students could thrive and fulfil their ambitions, to secure their progression through their programmes and to continue on to employment or future study.\n\nIn order to achieve these objectives throughout this challenging time, we have continued to take an innovative approach to delivering the very best for our students.\n\nOUR RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC\n\nDuring periods of national Lockdown, we successfully embraced online teaching, delivering courses through a combination of online demos, tutorials, seminars and one-to-ones. Where appropriate, we even posted materials and worksheets to students’ homes so they could continue their hands-on practice from make-shift studios.\n\nWhen national safety advice and guidance allowed, we were amongst the first to open our doors to welcome students back into their studios, following an extensive period of meticulous preparation to create a safe environment for students and staff.\n\nBy adapting our facilities, extending our opening hours and term dates, working in bubbles and providing additional teaching, as well as strictly adhering to all social distancing, PPE, testing and safety rules, we were able to offer our students the studio-based learning experience that is essential for the depth of study we provide. Socially-distanced studio practice and small group tutorials were supported with online group seminars and lectures.\n\nTo celebrate and promote the achievements of students who were unable to exhibit their final work during 2020, we launched an online Graduate Showcase, and in 2021, hosted an additional in-person summer show for our 2020 Fine Art graduates.\n\nThroughout this difficult period, we have been dedicated to supporting students’ mental health and wellbeing. Our wonderful Access to Learning team, led by Teresita Dennis, has been providing a comprehensive and compassionate service and course tutors have been particularly vigilant about noticing signs of mental distress in their students. We introduced 24/7 free mental health support for students through Talk Campus, and in addition we provide a wealth of information on alternative mental health support organisations available to students.\n\nWHAT OUR STUDENTS SAY\n\nRecorded at the start of the academic year 2020/21, some of those who were students at the time, shared their thoughts about our response to the pandemic.\n\n“I feel so lucky to be at a school which simultaneously places student wellbeing and respect for Covid rules at the top of their priority list.” – Roberta Bloomer, Foundation Diploma Art & Design\n\n“The school is run in a way that not just considers, but actually centres around the student experience. In current times of Covid, where most institutions have reduced building access, City & Guilds of London Art School has found a safe and effective way of even increasing the number of studio-access hours.” – Gaurav Gupta, BA (Hons) Fine Art\n\n“At a time of such uncertainty and unrest, the Art School has dealt with everything with incredible integrity and diligence ensuring the wellbeing of all who attend and work on campus. Given most courses at the Art School are very practical and hands on, stringent safety measures have been put in place which has enabled the school to remain open and created a safe environment for all. The quality of the teaching is outstanding. It is clear that it is a place that is well loved and run by a very dedicated and passionate team of professionals.” – Joanne Grogan, BA (Hons) Historic Carving: Woodcarving & Gilding\n\n“Despite the ongoing global upheaval in education institutions as a result of the pandemic, the Art School has remained dedicated to upholding the needs of its students, ensuring we are still creatively supported and accommodating our growth as much as possible. Hearing about so many other art schools going online, I am so grateful I chose to come here. Not only are the tutors closely connected to the students in normal times, but even during the pandemic, they ensure that we are creatively guided, closely listened to and helped throughout this period, maintaining as much normality as they can.” – Filippa Seilern Aspang, MA Fine Art\n\nRemembering the Ravndal Family\n\nMartin Ravndal Hauge who died in his native Norway on 17 October 2022 aged 85, was a long-standing supporter of students at City & Guilds of London Art School, along with his wife Atla Lund Hauge who passed away on 20 February 2022. They will be greatly missed.\n\nMartin had spent a career teaching at the Institute of Biblical Studies at the University of Oslo and was a published author.\n\nAtla was a published children’s and youth author, teacher and winner of Riksmålforbundet’s children’s and youth book prize in 1995.\n\nMartin and Atla first came into contact with the Art School in the 1990s when their daughter Idun Ravndal a Norwegian Painter, studied Fine Art with us. Idun went on to graduate in 1994, but sadly died on 11 October 2002 aged just 33. In Idun’s memory and in recognition of her time spent at the Art School, Martin and Atla set up the Idun Ravndal Travel Prize to support a student to take a research trip each year towards their studies.\n\nMore recently in 2020, Atla and Martin made generous provisions for a future legacy which will provide further, long term support of Fine Art students, and will permanently recognise Idun’s very happy years at the Art School – which, in their own words, ‘gave insight and the basic rock on which to stand, to start from and to come back to’.\n\nIn 2020, the Art School unveiled its own memorial to Idun, through the renaming of one its Victorian fine art studios. The studio plaque celebrates Idun’s time at the Art School and was created by fine art alumna and then Painter Stainers’ Decorative Surfaces Fellow, Ana Kazaroff.\n\nWe send our deepest condolences to Martin and Atla’s friends and family.\n\nPicture-perfect start to new Saturday Club!\n\nA massive welcome to our wonderful Saturday Club Members as they begin their creative journey to discover new and exciting artistic talents!\n\nThe Club has been running for two weeks now, and so far Members have been exploring ideas about their own self-identity, how they see themselves and how they see others, through a variety of drawing challenges. These drawing workshops are the first step towards Club Members designing their own personal coat of arms by making a series of handcrafted artworks, with their final piece exhibited in the Summer Show at Somerset House.\n\nGuided by our wonderful and inspiring tutors, Sarah Davis and Tom Merrett, Members tested a host of different drawing materials and explored new techniques.\n\nUsing charcoal and twigs dipped in ink, Members set about drawing objects that represent the things that are most important to them. Amongst other things, they drew favourite teddies, a camera, drinks cartons, sweets, sea shells and jewellery.\n\nThe final work was displayed around the room and it looked amazing!\n\nThe group then moved on to drawing a series of self-portraits, employing different techniques along the way.\n\nThey began by creating collective portraits, spending two minutes adding to each other’s drawings using vividly-coloured chalk. Moving around the room and working from mirrors, they drew aspects of themselves onto each image.\n\nAfter this, Members began to draw one another, exploring facial features, line and space, creating eight portraits.\n\nThe workshop ended when Members tackled a self-portrait, choosing to work from a mirror, phone or from their imagination, with some fantastic results.\n\nFor the next few weeks, Club Members will get to know the Art School’s historic Print Room with tutor Kristina Chan, where they will learn the processes of soft ground etching and embossing. They’ll also work with tutor Kate Dunn to explore colour, expression and abstraction – can’t wait!\n\nInterested in applying for our 2023/24 Saturday Club?

These include ensuring the space is well ventilated and wearing safety googles and steel toe capped shoes.\n\nEach student was given a block of Levoux stone (a French limestone) and a plaster mould of an acanthus leaf. Their brief was to carve the acanthus leaf relief into the stone by following a step-by-step process used by cavers for centuries.\n\nImage: Adrian Gono\n\nStudents drew a grid over the acanthus leaf plaster cast and then over their stone block. They then drew the leaf design onto the block, using the grid to ensure accuracy.\n\nImage: Julian Sonta\n\nImages: Daniel Abbott; Thomas Yeung\n\nOnce the motif was fully mapped out, the students began carefully carving the stone, using a small chisel to start the process. They used Calipers and a T-square to ensure the carving was developing accurately, paying attention to the depth of the carving as well as the outline.\n\nImage: Noilin O’Kelly\n\nAfter employing further techniques to enhance and define the carving, the Conservation students proudly exhibited their final carved acanthus leaf motifs – brilliant work!\n\nWork by: Noilin O’Kelly; Kathryn Miller; Daniel Abbott; Lucy Wadsworth; Adrian Gono; Julian Sonta; Thomas Yeung\n\nThe images included in this blog are from the students’ detailed, non-compulsory process logs, compiled following the workshop.\n\nConservation graduate awarded funded traineeship in India\n\nThe Art School is delighted to announce that 2022 BA Conservation graduate, Alannah Hay, has been awarded a fully-funded place on the Architectural Conservation Training Programme at University College for Women, in Hyderabad, India, which takes place this month.\n\nOrganised with the World Monuments Fund, the Commonwealth Heritage Forum has developed this course as part of its new Queen Elizabeth II Platinum Jubilee Commonwealth Heritage Skills (CHS) Training Programme, to build capacity on the practical aspects of built heritage conservation, with a particular focus on working with lime. The course is also designed to share knowledge and experience between India and the UK. The CHS Training Programme offers six fully-funded Hamish Ogston Foundation Commonwealth Traineeships.\n\nThe Traineeships are available to students or trainees studying traditional building and/or heritage craft skills, as well as early career practitioners, from the UK. They will join six local participants on the course. The programme includes field visits to sites of architectural interest such as Charminar, Mecca Masjid, Chowmohalla Palace and Paigah and Qutb Shahi Tombs; demonstration and hands-on work with lime: masonry, plastering and construction; and lectures on architectural conservation and safety, conservation practices in India and site and project management.\n\nYou can read about Alannah and what she hopes to gain from the course on the Hamish Ogston Foundation website.\n\nWe congratulate Alannah on her success and look forward to reading her full report.\n\nImage: Qutb Shahi Tomb by Alaka123 – Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=51470189\n\nSummer placement: conservation around the UK\n\nAt the end of his second year on our BA Conservation: Stone, Wood & Decorative Surfaces course, Joshua Horsfall spent the summer working on a variety of conservation projects around the country with conservation companies Rupert Harris Conservation, Skillingtons Conservation Workshops and Sally Strachey Historic Conservation.\n\nIn his own words, Joshua details the work he has been involved with:\n\nGhandi statue in Tavistock Square. Stone cleaning and relaxing of the Bronze\n\nSince finishing my second year I have worked on numerous projects with a few different companies in the conservation world. I started in June working on the statues in Russell Square, Lincoln’s Inn Square, Tavistock Square and Bloomsbury Square, all in London.\n\nCleaning the stone on the Ghandi statue in Tavistock Square\n\nTavistock Square, statue of Dame Louise Brandreth Aldrich-Blake (1865–1925), a pioneering woman physician and surgeon in nearby hospitals, whose bust looks both into and out of the Square\n\nThis was with Rupert Harris Conservation and involved some introductions into the work they do on Bronze sculptures combined with the varied challenges of poulticing and mortar work on the different stone surrounds. I also worked with Rupert Harris on various projects a few months later in the summer, in St. Pancras Gardens, as well as little maintenance jobs all over the city.\n\nWaterlow Park, North West London. Reinstating the wings\n\nHardwick Hall, Derbyshire, 16th century decorative plaster\n\nI also spent some time back with my previous employer Skillington Workshop at Hardwick Old Hall in Derbyshire, conserving surviving Elizabethan plaster work which included some fine examples of the period style still intact after all these years. I have done little pieces there over the years but it was great to be a part of the large works which included lots of disciplines and trades working on site to preserve this building.\n\nEly Cathedral, Cambridgeshire, repairs and cleaning to the front porch column\n\nEly Cathedral chapel floor repairs\n\nAfter that I spent over a month working on the front porch of Ely Cathedral in Suffolk, focusing on the Purbeck Marble columns which were in need of some repairs and cleaning, as well as some restoration to the decorative floor in the chapel. I also managed to complete works at Newcastle Cathedral that I had been a part of before my time at the Art School, this was nicely rounded off with a visit from Prince Edward, the cousin of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nChopping out and replacing failed Bath Stone at Drews Park in Wiltshire\n\nAt the end of my summer break I had a great time working with some of the team from Sally Strachey Historic Conservation at Drews Park in Wiltshire, fitting stones and mortar repairs around the once mental hospital and now large picturesque residential park.\n\nSummer Placement: frames at Knole\n\nBA Conservation: Stone, Wood & Decorative Surfaces student, Carla Learoyd, is starting her final year on the course. Working at the Royal Oak Foundation Conservation Studio, Carla has spent seven weeks over the summer at the National Trust’s Knole conserving four frames and learning an array of new skills to take back to her final-year studies.\n\nIn her own words, Carla reflects on her summer at Knole:\n\nDue to Covid, not many institutions were offering work placements to students in 2021 so I was thrilled to be offered the chance to work at the National Trust property Knole House this summer for a period of seven weeks.\n\nI would be working under the supervision of my City & Guilds of London Art School frame tutor Gerry Alabone who is the Senior Furniture and Frames Conservator there.\n\nAcquired by Thomas Sackville, one of Queen Elizabeth I cousins in 1603, Knole House is set in the beautiful grounds of Knole Park, inhabited by herds of wild sika and fallow deer. I encountered deer of all sizes on my long walk up to the house every morning and each time I would frantically reach for my phone like a tourist in the hope of taking the perfect photo, which proved to be a very tricky task most of the time!\n\nMy best photo!\n\nMy placement was based in the Royal Oak Foundation Conservation Studio, which is a relatively new addition to Knole House, opening in 2017 following renovations to a 600-year-old barn made possible by National Lottery Heritage funding in 2013.\n\nThe conservation studio is such an inspiring place, with paintings conservators, ceramics conservators, object conservators and frames and furniture conservators all working together under the same roof. I was pleasantly surprised to see that several Art School alumni were working there at the same time as me which made me feel more at ease. So I must thank past students Miyuki, Nolly and Ieva for their friendship and advice during my time at Knole.\n\nOn my first day I was given a schedule by Gerry of tasks that I would be working on throughout the seven weeks including frame conservation, report writing, studio organisation and providing general assistance in the studio where needed. During my placement I managed to work on four different frames, all of which had different requirements.\n\nThe first two frames were 17th Century gilt auricular style frames that were recovered from the attic of Lacock Abbey in Chippenham.\n\nBoth frames had been adapted and cut up to make a larger third frame, so I was dealing with two small top and bottom pieces and two separate side pieces, all in a very poor condition with high levels of surface soiling. Most of the gilded surfaces were flaking, with some loose pieces vulnerable to future loss. The larger pieces also had structural issues to the mitred corners and splits to some areas of the sight edge (the inner edge closest to the painting) which was making them structurally unstable and difficult to handle.\n\nLeft & right: Images showing some of the soiling and flaking on the gilded surfaces\n\nThese frames required intensive treatment as the two sides were over 2.4m high and the full treatment that I carried out is too long to list here, so I have highlighted a few areas that I worked on. I carried out various tests to work out what the best cleaning methods, consolidants and adhesives would be and subsequently cleaned all surfaces, consolidated all loose and flaking gilding, and adhered any loose pieces that could be placed in their original location. I then addressed the issues that were affecting the structural stability of the largest pieces of frame. Following treatment, all pieces could now be confidently handled and stored.\n\nImages showing the bottom left corner before and after treatment to allow both surfaces to sit flush together\n\nMy second frame was a beautiful gilt frame with rococo style features from Hughenden Manor in Buckinghamshire. The brief for this frame was to provide a gentle clean to the surface to fully reveal the gilding scheme, to replace missing features and to create a cohesive overall look to the frame. There were also issues with the hanging fittings and the back edge had large areas of loss to the painted surface.\n\nMost of the frame had been water gilded but some later additions had been oil gilded and gaps in the gold leaf revealed the surface beneath.\n\nAfter cleaning the frame, I used dental putty to create a cast of an intact element to replace a missing leaf tip to the top left corner. This was the first time I had carried out this process, so it was great to have this practice. The rest of my treatment for this frame included re-gilding, distressing, and toning of the surface. I also used watercolours to tone in the back edge and removed current hanging fittings to make way for a new system to be fitted. I hadn’t carried out any toning of gilding before, so it was great to get some experience doing this. I had some great advice and help from Maria the decorative surfaces conservator and Miyuki who had lots of experience in this area.\n\nImages showing the moulding, application and gilding of a missing leaf tip\n\nImages showing an area of the back edge before and after toning in losses with watercolour\n\nThe final frame I worked on was a painted frame from Westwood Manor in Wiltshire that required cleaning and had some structural issues that needed to be addressed. In comparison to the previous frames, the treatment I carried out wasn’t as intensive, but it did allow me to replace a major loss to one of the corners and in the process practice my wood carving skills which were a bit rusty!\n\nImages showing the bottom left corner following the moulding and shaping of a new pine insert. The corner was then stained and polished to integrate successfully with the adjacent moulding\n\nUnfortunately, my time ran out before I could finish the frame, but I did manage to stabilise the loose corners and carry out some toning to the surface using watercolours before I left.\n\nImages showing one area of the outer edge before and after toning in areas of loss using Golden acrylic paints\n\nBefore I finished my time at Knole I was lucky enough to have a tour of the house from my supervisor Gerry, which only highlighted what an inspirational place Knole must be to work at.\n\nAside from the great experience I gained in the world of frames conservation, I really felt that I was part of the workforce because I was made to feel so welcome. It really feels like a little family there and everyone was happy to give me advice and tips if I asked.\n\nI must give a big thank you to Gerry who arranged the work placement for me. It was a pleasure to see how enthusiastic he is about all things Knole, and I will be able to transfer all the skills I picked up into my third year at the Art School.\n\nBut I must say that I think Gerry was most happy about mastering my exacting strong tea requirements! By the end of my placement, he had produced the perfect cup of tea with the colour that is now known as “Nan’s tan tights”! Thanks Gerry!\n\nSenior Frames and Furniture Conservator at Knole Gerry Alabone and me\n\nSo, if any future students have the chance to work at Knole, grab the opportunity but don’t get too hung up on taking the perfect deer photo as it will become an obsession!\n\nSummer placement: Sicily’s catacomb frescoes\n\nThird year BA Conservation: Stone, Wood & Decorative Surfaces student, Ethan Gallesio, carried out an observational internship at the paleochristian catacombs of Villagrazia di Carini, the largest catacombs in western Sicily, dating from 4th to 8th century A.D.\n\nIn his own words, Ethan describes the conservation work undertaken in the catacombs:\n\nEntryway to the catacombs\n\nMy internship focused for my part on the painted frescoes present in the galleries and cubicles of the catacombs. Most of the frescoes illustrated passages from the Old and New Testament, illustration made by craftsmen with the exception of one fresco representing Helena, mother of ​​Constantine the Great made with an artistic approach (use of other pigment and illustration techniques not present on the rest of the frescoes).\n\nFirst fresco made for a tomb of a children (Mechanically cleaned)\n\nSecond fresco painted arc for another small tomb representing Maria and the child with the three wise kings (laser cleaned)\n\nThird fresco representing Maria and the child seated (Mechanically cleaned)\n\nThe analysis carried out on these frescoes made possible to identify pigments such as red iron oxide, yellow ochre, brown manganese as well as cobalt blue present only in the representation of Helena being a very expensive material at the time.\n\nRepresentation of Helena (face on the left) with a blue background painted with cobalt pigments (Mechanically cleaned)\n\nDetail of the fresco depicting Helena\n\nThe frescoes being initially covered with sediment, the curators cleaned them with scalpels, cotton wool and deionizer water. Certain frescoes were cleaned using laser cleaning. A few years after salt crystals and a patina of limestone appeared on the surface making the frescoes less visible. The dampness of the catacombs causes erosion, and an aeration system has been placed to diminish those effects.\n\nPainted fragment with chalk and iron oxide residue\n\nSummer placement: conserving theatrical posters\n\nLaura Goodman, currently starting the second year of BA Conservation: Books & Paper, undertook a summer placement with Museum Conservation Services, working at the Theatre Royal in Bury St Edmunds, to carefully remove and conserve a collection of 1950s theatre posters that had adhered to a damp wall.\n\nIn her own words, Laura outlines the conservation treatment she carried out:\n\nAs my summer placement comes to an end, I thought I would share a project I’ve been working on throughout the summer. Working off site at the Theatre Royal at Bury St Edmunds to remove a collection of theatre posters from the 1950s.\n\nThe posters have been deteriorating in condition for a number of years and the paper has become very fragile, from continuous moisture damage.\n\nInitially, we used steam to soften the starch-based adhesive – although on some posters the paper is so brittle through mould and water damage that the only way to remove them is mechanically.\n\nThen we applied enzymes, as the adhesive is starch-based the enzymes ‘soften’ the adhesive resulting in a easier removal. We applied them directly on the posters for a couple of hours until removal.\n\nAfter removing the posters, we washed them on site to prevent any watermarks. Then we took them back to the studio for further conservation work, which will include lining for support and removal of the overpaint over the edges.\n\nSummer placements\n\nDuring the summer break, students on our Conservation programmes have the opportunity to put their Conservation skills and knowledge into practice on an exciting range of work placements and internships within the conservation and heritage sector. Here’s what some students got up to during Summer 2022.\n\nSicily’s catacombs – Ethan Gallesio\n\nThird year student on our BA Conservation: Stone, Wood & Decorative Surfaces, Ethan Gallesio, carried out an observational internship at the paleochristian catacombs of Villagria di Carini, the largest catacombs in western Sicily, dating from 4th to 8th century A.D. The conservation project focused on analysing the painted frescoes depicting passages from the Old and New Testament, in the galleries and cubicles of the catacombs.\n\nRead more >\n\nKnole House, Kent – Carla Learoyd\n\nBA Conservation: Stone, Wood & Decorative Surfaces student, Carla Learoyd, is starting her final year on the course.

In its previous incarnation as University of Central England, Birmingham City University was the first validating body to validate the Art School’s Fine Art Painting and Sculpture BA (Hons) degrees in 1997 and Conservation BA (Hons) degree in 1998, consolidating the Art School’s position as a centre of excellence for teaching contemporary fine art and the conservation of cultural artefacts. All BA (Hons) and MA degrees at the Art School are now validated by Ravensbourne University London.\n\nGraduating in Fine Art from Reading University, the Royal College of Art and the British School of Rome, John’s career as an artist and lecturer has involved national and international exhibitions and exchanges in both Europe and America. Employing an understated humour, his work tracks his life journey from the South of England, to the North and finally to the Midlands, and his fundamental quest to understand the meaning of belonging and the purpose of existence. John is currently an Associate Professor in Birmingham School of Art, Birmingham City University and a Senior Fellow of the Higher Education Academy.\n\nTamiko O’Brien\n\nTamiko O’Brien second from left during a visit from Urushi expert and Living National Treasure Kazumi Murose (third from left) to the Art School’ s carving and conservation studios in 2018\n\nIn July 2022, the Ravensbourne University London Professorial Appointment Sub-Committee conferred the title of Professor Emerita on Tamiko O’Brien, Principal at the Art School between 2014 and 2022. In their feedback, that considered Tamiko’s career in Higher Education to date, the panel referred to her ‘sustained strategic leadership over many years, particularly in the arena of curriculum development, innovation in learning and teaching, facilities build and development, and resource management ‘ as well as her ‘research and professional practice portfolio of activities, with residency schemes in UK, EU, Japan, supported by external funding, and evidenced by exhibitions and commissions and public events and symposia which she led, co-curated and contributed to’. The title was awarded by Ravensbourne University London through a process that involved external experts including Professor Paul Gough (Vice Chancellor at Arts University Bournemouth) and Professor Anita Taylor (Dean at Duncan and Jordanstone College of Art & Design).\n\nTamiko worked in Higher Arts Education at a number of institutions, including the University of the Arts London. Initially working as a Fine Art tutor and then course leader, she went on to work as head of school, associate dean and professor before joining the Art School as Principal. Her involvement in pedagogic research projects, including pro-bono work as the founding chair of the Fine Art European Forum and with the European League of Institutes of the Arts and EQArts, has facilitated developments in curricula and teaching practices as well as generated numerous student projects and international exchanges.\n\nThroughout her time in Higher Arts education, Tamiko has maintained her art practice, that since 1998 has involved working as one half of artist duo Dunhill and O’Brien. Rooted in the traditions of sculpture, their work is concerned with the procedures and problems of collaboration. Their aspiration, to make new work together unencumbered by individual taste, has led to projects involving elaborate processes, motorised apparatus and performative ‘research’ activities, as well as working directly with participants. They have received project funding and research awards including from the Arts Council England, Arts and Humanities Research Council, Daiwa Anglo Japanese Foundation and Great Britain Sasakawa Foundation, and have participated in exhibitions, residencies and projects in the UK, Ireland, Holland, Germany, Italy and Japan.\n\nKey developments at City & Guilds of London Art School during Tamiko’s tenure as Principal 2014-2022\n\nUnder Tamiko O’Brien’s leadership, the Art School team worked to significantly raise the level of ambition, introducing outward facing activity to better establish the Art School’s profile as a renowned centre of excellence. Alongside important work on governance and quality, measured through a highly successful Quality Assurance Agency Review and registration with the Office for Students, some of the key developments include:\n\nArtist in Residence scheme launch (2015)\n\nThis programme provides early and mid-career artists with a base and access to the Art School’s specialist facilities. Meanwhile, their engagement in the life of the Art School provides inspiration and valuable professional experience and contributes to the Material Matters research programme. To date, 14 artists have taken part, including several international artists, most recently Taku Obata.\n\nNew MA Conservation (2017)\n\nAfter many successful years running a Postgraduate Diploma in Conservation, City & Guilds of London Art School was proud to launch a new MA Conservation to run alongside the existing BA (Hons) Conservation course. Closely related to the BA, the MA involves high-level conservation projects, advanced conservation science, research, ethics and professional practice, and culminates in the completion of an ambitious practical conservation project, accompanied by an extended research and treatment report. The course builds on the department’s strong links with major institutions including the V&A, English Heritage and the National Trust.\n\nCollaboration – Tokyo University of the Arts’ Sculpture Research Lab (2017 – 2019)\n\nFrom May 2017 through to November 2019, the Art School engaged in a collaboration with Tokyo University of the Arts specialist Buddhist Carving Lab building on Tamiko’s longstanding connections with TUA from her time as an artist in residence. The collaboration included a visit from experts from TUA to the Art School with demonstrations for students as well as for London Craft Week and events at the V&A and British Museum. A reciprocal visit in 2019 to Tokyo involved a team of specialists from the Art School’s Historic Carving and Conservation Departments including Gerry Alabone and Rian Kanduth, and a conservator and wood and urushi expert from the British Museum.\n\nThe project was funded by the Daiwa Anglo Japanese Foundation, the Great Britain Sasakawa Foundation and Toshiba International Foundation, and provided rare opportunities for experts from the UK and Japan to exchange skills and develop links and provided students with in depth teaching from international experts .\n\nSummer School Short Courses Launch (2018)\n\nA diverse and inspiring portfolio of 3 & 5 day summer courses was launched in July 2018 . Taught by a range of professionally active tutors from the Art School’s degree and MA courses, the Summer School students benefit from their expertise, small class sizes and focus on historic and specialist skills and knowledge.\n\nThe programme has grown over the years and welcomed many individuals interested in exploring the Art School’s subjects. Between 2019-2021, funded bursaries for 18-25 year olds were offered thanks to a grant from the Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation.\n\nStone and Woodcarving Studios Renovation (2018-2019)\n\nThis project upgraded and expanded the Historic Carving department with facilities to match the excellence and reputation of its courses, which are unique in the UK and play a significant role in keeping alive specialist craft skills central to the preservation of the nation’s heritage as well as ensuring their role in contemporary architecture and craft.\n\nCarving courses validated as BA (Hons) and MA (2019)\n\nThe Art School’s longstanding excellence in the teaching of craft skills was recognised in in 2019 with the validation of the Art School’s Carving courses as BA (Hons) and MA courses, with pathways in Woodcarving & Gilding or Architectural Stone and MA Carving (which can also be taken as a PGDip Carving). Validated by Ravensbourne University London and entirely devised and delivered at the Art School these courses are only available at this level at the City & Guilds of London Art School .\n\nLaunch of new undergraduate course in Books & Paper Conservation (2020)\n\nAfter successfully reaching an ambitious fundraising target that enabled the Art School to double the footprint of the conservation department and create and equip a new suite of conservation studios and facilities in its Georgian terrace building in central London, the course launched with a full intake of first year students in September 2020. BA (Hons) Conservation: Books & Paper is the only course of its kind to be offered in London, and in the UK. The new award sits alongside and complements the Art School’s existing and highly-regarded BA (Hons) Conservation: Stone, Wood & Decorative Surfaces. This development also saw the expansion of our MA Conservation to include both research and practical projects in books and paper at an advanced level.\n\nThe addition of this new Books & Paper Conservation course has seen the Art School’s Conservation Department double in scale over the following three years, and follows the closure in 2018 of MA Conservation at Camberwell College of Arts, part of University of the Arts London (UAL). UAL donated specialist equipment and materials to support the set-up of the new course having identified City & Guilds of London Art School as a centre of excellence in the provision of craft and heritage training and the natural home of teaching in this specialism. Books & Paper conservation training in the UK has a long and important history and is very well respected internationally, attracting students from around the world, including the US where no specialist provision is currently available. Now that the Art School is offering the new undergraduate Books & Paper award along with clear progression to MA Conservation, the country’s educational provision for this specialist subject is significantly enhanced, giving students a wider choice and enabling them to progress directly into employment in the conservation world. The addition of this course strategically reinforces the Art School’s long-standing commitment to promoting and sustaining the legacies of important (and endangered) art and craft traditions, and of specialist skills essential for the future of our cultural heritage. The Books & Paper course now plays a crucial role in ensuring there are professionals available to work in this important area of conservation, enabling the continuation of the specialist knowledge and skills needed for the preservation of important works on paper.\n\nNew MA Fine Art Studios (2020)\n\nThe project encompassed the creation of new MA Fine Art studio facilities and a lecture room on the first floor of the adjoining Old Vauxhall Telephone Exchange building to allow for necessary studio relocations to accommodate the new Conservation course, resulting in an additional 500+ sqm of purpose-designed Fine Art studio and workspaces. The new spaces also significantly supported the Art School in reopening safely to students during the pandemic, enabling social distancing.\n\nThey now provide generous and attractive facilities supporting full recruitment to Fine Art courses and support excellence in studio based art practice.\n\nOur response to the Covid-19 pandemic (2020-2022)\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic impacted every aspect of the Art School’s activities since March 2020. The Art School, under Tamiko’s leadership, was pro-active in responding to the ongoing situation with our highest priority being the need to maintain the excellent standards we are known for, and that our students expect and deserve – not least to ensure our students were able to thrive and fulfil their ambitions, to secure their progression through their courses and on to employment or future study, and to uphold recruitment in order to avoid long term financial consequences. Despite the significant challenges, there were many important achievements to celebrate.\n\nMore detail of our response, including extended access and term times, can be found here.\n\nWidening Access & Participation\n\nWidening access and participation in our subject areas and creative higher education was an area of focus during Tamiko’s tenure though this was somewhat held back by the pandemic. Important groundwork was established that the Art School is successfully building upon including engagement in London Craft Week and the Big Draw with public events and activities, as well as building partnerships with Creative Dimension Trust and the National Saturday Club to offer activities for young people from groups who are under represented in Higher Education.\n\nCollaborations & Partnerships (to date)\n\nThe Art School has established a strong and expanding network of national and international art, creative and heritage-related institutions (as well as important links with private individuals). These collaborations translate year on year into significant professional and learning opportunities for current students as well as graduates, including placements, commissions and other forms of collaborative projects. Internationally, the Art School became a member of the Michelangelo Foundation’s European network of organisations committed to highest level craftsmanship and design.\n\nYou can read more about our partnerships and collaborations HERE.\n\nDick Onians\n\nEstablished carver and sculptor, Dick Onians, was awarded the Art School Fellowship in 2018 in recognition of his exceptional contribution to the Art School over many years. Dick taught Historic Carving Diploma and Postgraduate Diploma students at the Art School since 1978 until his retirement in 2018, and he is widely recognised by alumni and staff as an incredibly generous, thoughtful, knowledgeable and inspiring tutor and colleague, who has had a lasting influence on those he taught or worked with.\n\nAs a Cambridge Classicist who had begun his career as a teacher before devoting his life to art, Dick studied Woodcarving under William Wheeler, Stone carving under James Butler, R.A. and Life work at the Art School in the late 1960s, before becoming a freelance sculptor and teacher of carving. He continued doing this even after being invited back to join the Art School teaching staff as a Senior Carving Tutor in 1978. Until his retirement Dick was a constant source of inspiration to generations of our wood and stone carving students as well as to the Conservators, where his wealth of classical knowledge and deep appreciation of form were valued, and he became synonymous with the Art School. The quality of his Carving Teaching led to the award of a gold medal from the City & Guilds Institute, for which he wrote the entire woodcarving syllabus and ran accredited courses in evening classes and summer schools near his home in Hertfordshire. He then became the first recipient of the President’s Award for a City & Guilds teacher, presented to him personally by the Duke of Edinburgh in 2003.\n\nDick’s private work covers a range of genres, including the human figure and traditional ornament but concentrates on abstract sculptures in wood and stone with a focus on the invention of new forms. Much of his work is concerned with endlessness in time and space and with regeneration. Many of his pieces have been cast in bronze. His sculptures appear in private collections in the UK, Europe, Canada, Australia and the USA and he has public work in Greenwich and in the Docklands.\n\nDick is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Sculptors and a Liveryman of The Worshipful Company of Carpenters. He has written two books on the subject of woodcarving as well as contributing regularly to the woodcarving press and also writing for the Grove Dictionary of Arts.\n\nOli Epp\n\nFine Art alumnus Oli Epp, was presented with an Art School Honorary Medal in 2022, in recognition of his extensive work with alumna Nell Nicholas, in researching and preparing the Student Submission for the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) from 2015 to 2016. As the Art School’s first lead student representatives, Oli and Nell devised and led focus group meetings and summarised their findings in a detailed report submitted for the QAA Review in 2017. This was a considerable task undertaken in a voluntary and unpaid capacity.\n\nTheir approach demonstrated a generosity of spirit and determination to capture the student voice, and was particularly impressive because this project ran alongside their own intensive and highly successful studio practices.\n\nOli Epp’s paintings circulate a number of tragicomic aspects of 21st century living: the complexity of identity in the digital age, consumerism and consumption leading to control and addiction, anxiety and conflict. The paintings work in an endlessly cyclical way as Epp ironically questions idealisms, the pursuit of perfection, and the conflict that arises as a result.\n\nOli graduated with a BA (Hons) in Fine Art from City & Guilds of London Art School in 2017. He has exhibited internationally, founded the PLOP artist residency, and lives and works in London.\n\nCelestial carving commission for French convent\n\n© Julian Calder for QEST\n\nWe are delighted to share the exceptional work of 2021 Woodcarving graduate, Borys Burrough, who is completing a commission to design and carve a statue of St Dominic for Cours Notre Dame des Victoires, a Dominican Convent in Northern France.\n\nBorys was awarded the commission following the Art School’s open call for recent woodcarving alumni, to submit drawings and plans to create the statue, via one of our supporters. The competition brief, to create a carved, polychromed statue of St Dominic, was set by the Convent to mark the 800 year anniversary of the Saint’s death.\n\nSt Dominic (1170 – 1221) was a 12th century Spanish priest who founded the Dominican order of preachers. The completed statue will be placed on a niche about one and a half meters high in a chapel in the convent, amongst other wooden polychromed and gilded figures.\n\nBorys’ drawings of St Dominic\n\nSt Dominic, detail of fresco in Convento di San Marco, Florence; St Dominic by Fra Angelico\n\nAfter winning the commission, based on his pencil study of St Dominic and charcoal face study, Borys was asked to develop a clay model for approval by the convent. The full size clay model is approximately 80cm in height, and was developed based on feedback from the convent’s nuns, who had a very clear vision for how this St Dominic should look. His appearance is based on paintings of St Dominic by Fra Angelico (an Italian early renaissance painter) who was himself a Dominican friar. Unusually, the feedback process has been conducted by letter, as the nuns have not yet embraced modern communication technology.\n\nThe clay model of the statue\n\nOnce the clay model was finalised, Borys began the wood carving, which is nearing completion. The statue is carved in lime wood and will be painted, along with gilded elements including St Dominic’s golden cross and details on his book and cloak.\n\nThe carved statue – work in progress\n\nWork on the project continues and we look forward to sharing photos of the finished statue before it is transported to its new home in France.\n\nBorys graduated from MA Carving at City & Guilds of London Art School in 2021, having previously obtained his undergraduate Diploma in Ornamental Woodcarving & Gilding (now verified as a BA course) in 2018. Borys works as a professional woodcarver and gilder, with a focus on restoring and creating picture frames. As well as taking on private commissions, Borys works part time for antique picture framer and restorer Rollo Whately Ltd.\n\nBorys also undertook several commissions whilst studying at the Art School: a frame for a Van Dyck portrait; frames for two Dutch Old Masters.\n\nThe Art School’s extensive links and partnerships with institutions and individuals mean that we have a history of providing opportunities for placements and projects to both current students and recent alumni.\n\nTeresita Dennis\n\nTeresita Dennis was awarded the Art School Honorary Medal in 2022, in recognition of her exceptional work in establishing and effectively running the support services at the Art School, recognised as a model of good practice and commended by the Quality Assurance Agency. Her compassion, sound decisions, and immense dedication have been greatly appreciated by students and staff alike over the years.\n\nTeresita has worked in the Art School as a Senior tutor in Fine Art since 1999. Her role as a support tutor began in 2007 and since then she has developed the department to encompass the changing needs of students, with a focus on enabling access to learning and promoting confidence and inclusion, in relation to their individual needs.\n\nAs Head of Access to Learning, Teresita is trained to support students with a variety of learning differences, alongside making course-based needs assessments, individual learning plans, reasonable adjustments, facilitating DSA applications, providing pastoral care and giving advisory information and advice regarding mental health and general wellbeing.\n\nDr Lois Rowe\n\nDr Lois Rowe joined the Art School in 2022, following a successful career in Higher Education at the University of the Arts London (UAL), where she was Programme Director Fine Art and the Lead of Knowledge Exchange for Fine Art at Camberwell College of Arts and Wimbledon College of Arts.\n\nAlongside her career in Higher Education, Lois is a practising artist and researcher. Her art practice was shaped by an early career in theatrical costume design in Canada and Japan. Following a growing interest in textiles and soft sculptures, her work moved towards ‘animating’ her costumes and sculptures and her practice turned to producing and exhibiting film and video. Her work as an artist also involves writing and has focused on how art intersects with other disciplines, and she has published a series of written pieces on current cultural events.\n\nHer academic career has led her to initiate active research partnerships with organisations around the world, such as Ars Electronica, in Austria, where she curated Spectacular Resonance, a showcase of UAL interactive works. Lois also engages in pedagogic research and has organised a joint conference with OCADU in Toronto called Worlding Landscape which considers the different ways that art and land ownership are entwined and how pedagogic strategies can decolonise canonised perceptions of landscape.\n\nFollowing a Diploma in Theatre Studies at Dalhousie University, Lois"
