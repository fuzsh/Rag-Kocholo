        "text": "On February 19, 1948, Duff Cooper, the former British ambassador to France and a noted appraiser of women, went with his wife, Lady Diana, to a luncheon at Buckingham Palace with the King, Queen, and their two daughters, the Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret Rose (as Margaret was then called). Afterward he wrote in his diary, “We enjoyed it enormously. Conversation never flagged and was really amusing. Margaret Rose is a most attractive girl—lovely skin, lovely eyes, lovely mouth, very sure of herself and full of humour.” He added presciently, “She might get into trouble before she’s finished.”\n\nIt was not long before she did. The Princess, then 17, was already in love with one of her father’s courtiers, a love that would blaze across headlines and almost cause a constitutional crisis. Like her uncle David, the Duke of Windsor, she had become besotted with someone else’s spouse. Group Captain Peter Townsend, the King’s extra equerry, was a glamorous war hero who had been selected for royal service in 1944. Born in 1915, he was 15 years older than the Princess, whom he met for the first time when she was a 14-year-old in ankle socks. He came from a family that had served King (or Queen) and country for several generations. When the King asked him to escort his daughters riding or to the theater, keep a watchful eye while they danced with friends, or accompany them on picnics at Balmoral, the royal residence in Scotland, Townsend regarded it not so much a duty as an expression of devotion.\n\nAs Margaret neared the age at which first love strikes with all its force, the man she saw most of was the handsome, attentive Townsend. Despite his record as a courageous fighter ace, he was gentle, sensitive, and intuitive, qualities that appealed to the vulnerable core hidden beneath Margaret’s willful, confident exterior. When Townsend accompanied the royal family on a tour of South Africa in 1947, the two were in each other’s company every day. “We rode together every morning in that wonderful country, in marvelous weather,” the Princess told a confidante. “That’s when I really fell in love with him.”\n\nHistorical events seemed to doom their romance from the start. On February 6, 1952, King George VI died of lung cancer. His widow and her younger daughter moved into Clarence House, and Townsend went with them as comptroller; a few months later the Townsend marriage was dissolved. It was far easier for Margaret and Townsend to conduct a full-blown love affair within Clarence House, where the Princess had her own apartment, although at that stage the affair was still known only to a few. But when, at Queen Elizabeth II’s coronation, on June 2, 1953, the Princess lovingly picked a piece of fluff from the lapel of her lover’s tunic in plain view of all the television cameras in Westminster Abbey, their secret was out. Since Townsend was divorced, it was impossible for the new Queen, as head of the Church of England (which forbade marriages between divorced persons), to give her consent to someone as high in the line of succession as Margaret was. It was decided that the best plan would be for Townsend to leave the country for a year—at the end of which they were asked to wait another year. Townsend and Margaret saw each other again for the first time on October 12, 1955. Less than three agonizing weeks later, the two of them came to the conclusion that their love could have no happy ending. A statement was drafted in the Princess’s name:\n\nI would like it to be known that I have decided not to marry Group Captain Peter Townsend. I have been aware that, subject to renouncing my rights of succession, it might have been possible for me to contract a civil marriage. But mindful of the Church’s teachings that Christian marriage is indissoluble, and conscious of my duty to the Commonwealth, I have resolved to put these considerations before others. I have reached this decision entirely alone, and in doing so I have been strengthened by the unfailing support and devotion of Group Captain Townsend. I am deeply grateful for the concern of all those who have constantly prayed for my happiness.\n\nOnce the Townsend affair was over, the Princess put it resolutely behind her. Inside Clarence House it was hardly, if ever, mentioned. As the beautiful, tragic heroine of a star-crossed love, she aroused both chivalry and sympathy, and the country speculated eagerly about the men in her circle—would it be the Duke of Marlborough’s heir, Sunny Blandford, the Honorable Dominic Elliot, son of the Fifth Earl of Minto, or perhaps the rich and generous Billy Wallace who eventually won her? The Princess was giving no clues. Night after night, usually in a party of six or eight, she would visit theaters, restaurants, and nightclubs, smoking cigarettes through a long holder between courses and sipping whiskey.\n\nHer life developed a routine. She would stay in bed until 11, breakfasting on weak China tea and what she picked from a plate of fruit. She would then get up and have her bath, with the aid of Ruby Gordon, her dresser, and select her clothes and jewelry. Her shoes and cigarette lighters were cleaned every morning, and her hairdresser, René, called on her regularly. Sometimes she would play with her dogs, two Sealyhams named Pippin and Johnny and a King Charles spaniel named Rowley. At 12:30 she would appear looking groomed and fresh and go to her desk, on which sat a large glass of fresh orange juice and her mail. Then came lunch, with the Queen Mother and members of the household.\n\nWith them she was not always popular, in part because of her frequent rudeness to her mother. “Why do you dress in those ridiculous clothes?” she would ask, and she would become furious that drinks before lunch (notorious for their potency) would sometimes go on for an hour. The television set at Royal Lodge was another cause of trouble: Princess Margaret would simply switch it to another channel without a word if she did not like what the Queen Mother was watching. Yet the Queen Mother never lost her temper. Only by her hands could those who had served her for a long time tell that she was annoyed. “It was the way she moved a book, a piece of furniture, or a glass,” recalled her page William Tallon.\n\nMargaret was equally inconsiderate to her mother’s staff. If there was a Christmas party at Buckingham Palace, to which the staff of Clarence House were invited, the Queen Mother would invariably dine out with a lady-in-waiting or have something light so that her servants could get to the party, whereas Princess Margaret would deliberately have a dinner party that evening. It was a perversity that can perhaps be explained by the fact that—unlike the Queen Mother and the Queen, who had successively been the first lady in the land—Margaret, always number two, was determined to insist on her royal status.\n\nAt 28 she was at the height of her beauty and charisma, poised, stylish, and groomed to perfection. In one of the elegant evening dresses that made the most of her petite figure, swathed in furs and glittering with diamonds, she was an icon of glamour. She was imperious, and if she was bored, she showed it—at one small supper dance given in her honor, when her host asked her, “Ma’am, will you start the dancing?” she replied, “Yes—but not with you.”\n\nWhen one of Margaret’s dazzled admirers asked her in the spring of 1958 if she would sit for a photograph for him—he knew just the right photographer—she agreed. The chosen photographer was Antony “Tony” Armstrong-Jones, whom she had met a month or two earlier with Lady Elizabeth Cavendish, her lady-in-waiting. Immediately, Tony took charge of the sitting in his usual way. With the utmost politeness, he made her change her clothes, her jewelry, and her pose as if she were any other sitter, at the same time chatting away with his mixture of jokes, gossip about mutual friends, and stories of the theatrical luminaries he had photographed.\n\nMargaret, accustomed to unquestioning deference, had never met anyone like him. She decided that she wanted Tony in her circle, and after a while his face could be seen among the parties of six or eight people in which the Princess went to the theater or dined out. As he was not a known escort, no one paid any attention to the appearance of an extra man in her wide and varied acquaintance.\n\nNor did anyone notice when he came to his first luncheon party at Clarence House, on November 11, 1958. (“It will be too sad if you cannot come!,” Margaret had written two weeks earlier in her letter of invitation. “If you do, I must warn you immediately that I will bore you by forcing you to look at my photograph of Mamma in the heather, which has blown up very nicely.”) Tony was seated beside Margaret, with Princess Alexandra, Margaret’s cousin, on his other side.\n\nSoon she began paying secret visits to his studio in Pimlico. Her car would drop her unobtrusively in the adjacent, parallel road. Dressed as anonymously as possible in a tweed skirt, sweater, and headscarf, she would slip down a small alley that led to the studio’s backyard—at the back, the basement was at ground level—and down the spiral staircase into the small sitting room where Tony would cook them a simple supper.\n\nOccasionally he would whisk her off to the room he rented at 59 Rotherhithe Street, in a former pub on the Thames, where he could work in peace and entertain friends. His landlord, Bill Glenton, noticed that Tony was suddenly not only uncharacteristically secretive about his guests but also scrupulous about preparing for them. When he sprayed the entrance hall with an air freshener and replaced Glenton’s run-of-the-mill lavatory paper with soft, violet-tinted toilet tissue, it could have served as a hint that a special visitor was expected.\n\nWhen Margaret did come, it was usually in the company of friends, but sometimes, later in the year, they would meet there alone. Other meetings were at the houses of a very few close friends such as Lady Elizabeth and the Vogue features editor Penelope Gilliatt, and on weekends, when the Princess joined her mother at Royal Lodge, Tony would drive down to Windsor to see her. It was known that he was building an aviary there, and the assumption was that it was for the Queen Mother. As the year drew on, another excellent excuse for visits was his commission to take the 29th-birthday portraits of the Princess.\n\nThe Cure for Heartache\n\nFor Tony it was all overwhelming. He was used to pretty girls, from unsophisticated debutantes to models and actresses of varying degrees of experience, and he was aware of the effect his well-honed sexual expertise had on women. But Margaret was something different. She was gilded with the mysterious, mythic aura of royalty. Everything around her spoke of this. For a simple weekend country-house visit, the names of fellow guests had first to be submitted to her lady-in-waiting, accompanied by a dossier on each one. At every meal the Princess was served first, and no one could speak to her without first being addressed by her. In some houses, if she did not help herself to, say, potatoes, no one else could.\n\nShe was a challenge like no other—even to take the Queen’s sister on the back of a motorbike was something almost unbelievable, and the thought of a relationship overwhelming. Tremendously impressed by the Princess and all her qualities, Tony was also enormously proud of himself for becoming her lover. Each was a person of extraordinary sexual magnetism, with a libido to match. When they entered each other’s force field of attraction, their mutual gravitational pull was irresistible, and soon they were sexually besotted. That their passionate love affair was completely secret added to its intensity.\n\nYet, although by the summer of 1959 they were deeply in love and conducting an affair, he was still leading his busy private life at full throttle. Girls still came and went at the studio, and although the actress Jacqui Chan, his longtime girlfriend, was less in evidence, he was also carrying on an affair with the beautiful actress Gina Ward. On weekends, he often went to visit Jeremy and Camilla Fry, who had become his closest friends. Naturally, he took the Princess to see them at their house, Widcombe Manor, near Bath, and when she had weekend engagements or he could not see her, he often went there by himself.\n\nIn early October 1959, Tony went to stay at Balmoral for the first time. No one attached any significance to his visit, assuming that he was there in a professional capacity. Although he did not blend into the heathery, tweedy ambience of the castle in the way most visitors did, thanks to early outings with his father he was a good shot and, for Princess Margaret, the best of companions. While he was there, the Princess received a letter from Peter Townsend telling her that he was going to marry a Belgian girl of 19 named Marie-Luce Jamagne. The Princess, stunned by this piece of news, told Tony of the letter as they were out walking together on the last day of his visit, but she warned him not to ask her to marry him.\n\nShe was determined to show the world what was in fact the truth: that she was no longer in love with Townsend and that his marriage would not wound her. On her return from Balmoral she went to stay with Lord and Lady Abergavenny at Eridge, in Kent, in a large house party, fortuitously on the weekend that the papers carried the news of Townsend’s engagement. Raymond Salisbury-Jones (son of Sir Guy Salisbury-Jones, marshal of the diplomatic corps), who sat beside her at dinner the first night, recalled, “The next morning a message came round to every room in the house that the Princess absolutely was not to see the papers. I get quite a lump in my throat when I think about this, as it must have been a very difficult moment for her. So we all talked about all sorts of other things.”\n\nThe bond between Tony and the Princess was steadily strengthening, a fact acknowledged by the Queen Mother, who, unlike many others in the royal family, approved of him wholeheartedly—so much so that she gave a party for her daughter and the man Margaret now clearly loved. Ostensibly, this dance, at the end of October 1959, was to welcome Princess Alexandra home from Australia. There were 250 guests, who danced until three a.m. Tony and Margaret, scarcely able to hide their feelings for each other, were finally asked by the Queen Mother to lead a conga up and down the staircases and through the rooms of Clarence House.\n\nBy Christmas, the lovers had decided on marriage. Only a few people knew of this, in particular Jeremy and Camilla Fry, who had offered a “safe house” where they could be alone together during this last part of their courtship. “Was the second weekend you stayed much easier than the first?” wrote Camilla to Tony after one visit. “I am sure PM enjoyed it more this time. She seemed so much easier to talk to.” It was, in fact, while staying at Widcombe Manor with the Frys that they became engaged.\n\nThe Queen’s consent naturally had to be sought, and during the royal family’s Christmas sojourn at Sandringham, their country estate, Tony went down to visit—he had not been asked to stay, as this might have given the game away. After giving her consent, the Queen, who was pregnant with Prince Andrew, asked if they would refrain from announcing their engagement until after the birth of her child.\n\nThe Word Goes Out\n\nTony, aware that the longer such an explosive secret was kept the greater the likelihood of its emerging into the public domain, decided to spend a few weeks with his sister, Susan, the wife of John Vesey, the Sixth Viscount de Vesci, in Ireland. Back in his studio, Tony told his staff that he “might soon be doing something else.” Most of them thought he meant films. Possibly, if they had known about his conversation two months earlier with the young interior designer David Hicks, they might have picked up a hint. “I’m going to make a very grand marriage,” said Hicks. “Oh, really?” said Tony. “Who to?” “Lady Pamela Mountbatten,” replied Hicks proudly. “Oh, I don’t call that grand,” responded Tony.\n\nKnowing that his engagement would soon be announced, Tony was aghast when his lawyer father, Ronald “Ronnie” Armstrong-Jones, told him that his own marriage—his third—was about to take place: both Tony and Susan, aware that a three-times-married father-in-law for the Princess would make a juicy morsel for the press, begged Ronnie to postpone it for a few months. But he was adamant, saying to Tony, “Why can’t you change the date of your wedding?” On February 11, Ronnie, who was 50, married the 31-year-old flight attendant Jenifer Unite in Kensington Register Office. It was not exactly an auspicious omen.\n\nWhen the Queen gave birth to Prince Andrew, on February 19, 1960, the long wait was nearly over. Margaret had told one or two of her closest friends, swearing them to secrecy. But the strain of keeping the secret and ensuring that nothing discreditable leak out began to show. Telephoning a friend, the writer and journalist Francis Wyndham, Tony said in a tremulous voice that he thought he might be having a nervous breakdown, adding almost immediately, “What is a nervous breakdown?” Wyndham, who had known Tony since they both worked at Queen magazine, was confused by this sudden change in someone he had always found to be sparkling company, and he suggested that Tony go away for a while. “But I’d only have to come back,” he replied.\n\nOn February 24, five days after Prince Andrew’s arrival, Tony was at last able to tell his assistants that in two days’ time there would be “an announcement.” His Princess would soon be able openly to wear the engagement ring he had given her—a ruby surrounded by a marguerite of diamonds that he had purchased at the jeweler S. J. Philips for £250 ($700).\n\nOther disclosures would be more difficult. On Thursday night he telephoned Gina Ward. At first she was too staggered by his news to feel anything but shock and disbelief, simply saying over and over again, “Tony, you can’t take this on.” “But I can, I can,” he said in the eager way so familiar to her. “And anyway,” she cried, “you’re in love with me! You’ll have an awful life.” Only after the call was over and she realized that he had no doubts or second thoughts did the pain of her own loss strike home. (Nevertheless, she was to remain an adoring and lifelong friend.)\n\nOn the morning of Friday, February 26, Tony’s great friend and fellow photographer Robert Belton, who was renting a room in the choreographer John Cranko’s house, in Pimlico, was told by Cranko’s housekeeper that Tony Armstrong-Jones was on the telephone for him. “Can I come and see you?” asked Tony. “Yes, sure,” said Belton. When Tony arrived he asked Belton to get in the car, then drove it 400 yards from the house. “I’m getting married to Princess Margaret and they’re announcing it tonight after the six-o’clock news,” he told Belton, and then asked him if he would tell Jacqui Chan before the announcement. She was filming at Pinewood Studios, so Belton rang and left a message that he would pick her up after work. There was a long silence after he told her, and then she said, “Well, I hope she can cope better than I could.”\n\nAt Clarence House, Sir Arthur Penn, the treasurer, told the staff that all leave was canceled for the following weekend. When those who normally accompanied the Queen Mother, such as William Tallon, arrived at Royal Lodge that Friday, the staff were called into the canteen, where Sir Arthur told them that Princess Margaret was engaged. “Who to?” was the immediate response. “Well, a photographer—called Armstrong-Jones,” said Sir Arthur. From the assembled staff, few of whom had heard of Tony, there was a long-drawn-out “Ooh!” of disappointment. Most of them had thought it would be the immensely wealthy Billy Wallace, one of her most favored escorts. Then the Princess herself told them, adding that Tony would be arriving “with all his goods and chattels” that night.\n\nNot many miles away, driving back to London with rain beating on the windshield, Jacqui Chan and Belton heard on the car radio: “It is with the greatest pleasure that Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother announces the betrothal of her beloved daughter the Princess Margaret to Mr. Antony Charles Armstrong-Jones, son of Mr. R. O. L. Armstrong-Jones Q.C. [Queen’s Counsel] and the Countess of Rosse, to which union the Queen has gladly given her consent.”\n\nAs soon as the engagement was announced, warnings flew thick and fast amid the stream of congratulations. Those closest to the couple were the most distressed. Lady Elizabeth Cavendish asked the Princess if she was quite sure about her feelings, “because you won’t always know where he is and he won’t always want to tell you.” Tony’s brother-in-law, Lord de Vesci, who knew the Princess very well, advised, “Tony, for God’s sake don’t.” Sir Jocelyn Stevens, Tony’s friend since childhood, cabled from Lyford Cay, his estate in the Bahamas: “Never was there a more ill-fated assignment.” Peter Saunders, an Oxford friend, who did not like the Princess, thought Tony would put himself into a very difficult position. “These people aren’t for you,” he warned. “They will chew you up and spit you out. I know it’s a physical thing at the moment, but at the end of the day for goodness’ sake don’t do it.”\n\nOthers felt the Princess was the one who should be warned off. When the Queen Mother telephoned the photographer Cecil Beaton and told him of the engagement, Beaton said, “Oh, how wonderful, you must be thrilled, ma’am, how simply marvelous, he’s terribly clever and talented.” When he put the telephone down he said in tones of disgust, “Silly girl!” Even Noël Coward, a fervent royalist, noted in his diary, “He [Tony] looks quite pretty but whether or not the marriage is entirely suitable remains to be seen.” When Cecil Beaton told his Wiltshire neighbor Lord Pembroke of the engagement, Pembroke exclaimed, “Then I’ll go and live in Tibet!”\n\nThe writer Kingsley Amis, perhaps to get his own back for a trick Tony had played on him when he had been rude about the Princess (whom he had never met), reacted by bad-mouthing both of them, calling the Princess “famed for her devotion to all that is most vapid and mindless in the world of entertainment … and her appalling taste in clothes” and describing Tony as a “dog-faced tight-jeaned fotog of fruitarian tastes.”\n\nFor Tony’s mother, Anne Rosse, his engagement to Princess Margaret was the culmination of all her social ambitions. She had been fearful that he would marry Jacqui Chan, whom she disliked on purely social grounds. “She wanted me to make an upwardly mobile marriage,” said Tony. From being “my ugly son,” he was now her pet, and the approval he had always craved was at last forthcoming, but for all the wrong reasons. Ronnie, on the other hand, was deeply upset. “When he was cross he would sign his letters ‘RAJ’ and not ‘Your loving father,’” recalled Tony. “Now I got one saying, ‘Boy, you would be mad to marry Princess Margaret—it will ruin your career.’ My father loved Jacqui Chan and would have liked me to marry her.”\n\nA frisson of horror ran through many of the courtiers. Sir Alan Lascelles, who had done much to destroy the Princess’s romance with Peter Townsend, was equally unhappy about this one, lamenting to Harold Nicolson, the author and diplomat, that “the boy Jones has led a very diversified and sometimes a wild life, and the danger of scandal and slander is never far off.” Nicolson noted in his diary, “At least Mr. Jones is not a homo, which is rare these days.”\n\nTony went into hiding, staying at the house of his friend Simon Sainsbury’s brother in Eaton Terrace before moving into Buckingham Palace, on February 29. Here he had a bedroom and sitting room on the first floor, reached by an elevator. His meals were served on a tray, and a footman looked after him. He would enter with his own key by the privy-purse door; both at the palace and Royal Lodge his arrival would be heralded with the code words “The Taj Mahal is coming.” His secretary, Dorothy Everard, came to work for him in the next room.\n\nTo move from relative anonymity to royal life, even with the comparative restraint then shown by the media, meant a serious adjustment. He had to learn to walk two paces behind the Princess, to look attentive and smiling at all times, to say nothing controversial, and (in public) always to wait until the Princess had finished speaking so as to be sure never to interrupt her. Then there were such minor but important points as clapping with raised hands so that he could be seen to be clapping, to say nothing of the complications of precedence. Usually these were strictly observed, but at lunchtime in royal households, for instance, people sat where they wanted, and while engaged couples could be placed together, married couples never were.\n\nPress attention was unremitting—even their first engagement photograph, taken for The Times, had been interrupted by a helicopter buzzing overhead, and Tony and the Princess had had to dart for cover under the rhododendrons of the Royal Lodge gardens. For friends, it took a long time to overcome the seeming unreality of the situation. Robert Belton, receiving a telephone call from Tony at Buckingham Palace, with the noise of music in the background, said, “I can’t hear you very well—could you turn the radio down?” “That’s not the radio,” responded Tony, “it’s the band—they’re changing the guard. Do you want a favorite played?” After a week he asked his assistant, John Timbers, to go and see if there was any mail at his studio. It was piled so high that Timbers could barely get through the door.\n\nOnce Tony and Margaret were officially engaged, the celebratory dinners began. One was with the Honorable Colin and Lady Anne Tennant (whose wedding Tony had photographed four years earlier). Both the Tennants knew the Princess well. Anne had carried the Queen’s train at the coronation; Colin was a great friend of the Princess’s, and before his marriage a frequent escort. As Margaret loved the Caribbean, neither of the Tennants was surprised when they learned over dinner that the couple would be spending their honeymoon there. “Why don’t you stop off at Mustique?” said Colin, who had bought this beautiful little island in 1957 for £45,000 ($126,000). “Anne and I will be there, living in our hut, and we won’t bother you at all.”\n\nTony was, naturally, constantly invited to Clarence House. His future mother-in-law, the Queen Mother, had become extremely fond of him, although some of her household took the same attitude toward him as the palace courtiers. To observant eyes, this slight frostiness could be discerned in the simple matter of pre-lunch drinks. These were served from a trolley, usually martinis or gin and Dubonnet, while in the corner an old-fashioned phonograph quietly played 1930s tunes such as “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes.” The Queen Mother, who did not want footmen in the drawing room before lunch, left the serving of drinks to her private secretaries and equerries, most of them former soldiers, who quietly and efficiently poured them out for Elizabeth, the Princess, and their guests. But, for Tony, who was neither royal nor by now really a guest, they resented performing this service.\n\nA Royal Wedding\n\nThe wedding was set for May 6, 1960. Anne Rosse had wanted Tony to have his oldest half-brother, Lord Oxmantown, as best man. But Tony’s underlying resentment at what he saw as his mother’s lifelong neglect, only emphasized by her about-face when he got engaged to the Princess, put that idea to rest. Instead, as Buckingham Palace announced on March 19, he intended to have his best friend, Jeremy Fry. Two weeks later, on April 6, it was revealed that Fry had stepped down owing to a recurrence of jaundice. The real reason, discovered but not stated by the press, was that Fry had been convicted at Marlborough Street Magistrates Court, London, in 1952 of a minor homosexual offense, for which he had been fined £2 (this was at a time when homosexual behavior was still a criminal offense).\n\nJeremy Thorpe, a close friend of Tony’s since their Eton days, was briefly considered, but a discreet inquiry by the chief constable of Devon discovered that he also was thought to have homosexual tendencies. In the end Tony settled for a man of irreproachable reputation, Dr. Roger Gilliatt, the husband of Penelope Gilliatt, who was not only the son of the Queen’s gynecologist but a prominent neurologist in his own right.\n\nThe public enthusiasm for the wedding was immense. It was wonderful and romantic, the beautiful young Princess finding happiness again with a magnetically attractive young photographer after sacrificing a great love. When they went to the opera with the Queen Mother in March, the whole audience stood and cheered.\n\nIn the heady excitement of being able to be together openly, Margaret and Tony never stopped to think of what difficulties could lie ahead. She was fascinated by his haute bohemian world, so different from the one in which she had been brought up. He believed absolutely that he could cope with the pressures of living within the protocol and values of a court life that, despite two World Wars, had hardly changed since Victorian days, and the friendliness with which he was treated by the royal family did nothing to dispel this conviction. From their point of view, his intelligence, natural finesse, excellent manners, and obvious devotion to Margaret spoke heavily in his favor. He was the first commoner in 400 years to marry the daughter of a monarch; for the more farsighted members of “the firm,” to include someone who had worked for his living all his adult life added a welcome contemporary note to an institution often accused of living in the past.\n\nDeeply in love, seeing each other at their best, happiest, and most unselfish, neither Tony nor Margaret realized that they were both, au fond, accustomed to getting their own way—and making life extraordinarily unpleasant for anyone who prevented them. As one friend put it sadly, “They were both center-stage people, and only one person can occupy the center at any given moment.”\n\nMay 6 was a clear, bright day. From the flagpoles along the Mall hung white silk banners with the initials T and M entwined on red Tudor roses, and a 60-foot arch of pink and red roses had been erected in front of Clarence House. There was a grandstand outside Westminster Abbey and discreetly hidden television cameras inside (it was the first royal wedding to be televised).\n\nAmong the 2,000 guests were not only the expected array of statesmen, peers, ministers, and close friends of the bride and groom, but also the three living wives of the bridegroom’s father—including the groom’s mother, Anne Rosse, dressed to the nines in a Victor Stiebel suit of gold brocade with a mink collar. Jacqui Chan, escorted by Bob Belton, arrived in a car sent by Tony, and slipped through a side door. Other guests included Tony’s housekeeper and the postman from his father’s village in Wales.\n\nThe bride, by contrast, did not ask any of the Clarence House staff who had cared for her for years. Margaret had not made herself popular with them, treating those who looked after her inconsiderately and with maddening demands that often caused endless extra work. Lord Adam Gordon, the comptroller of the household, summed up the feelings of many of them in a remark heard by William Tallon, who was standing close by. As Margaret passed him where he stood on the top step as the glass coach waited to take her to Westminster Abbey, Gordon bowed and said, “Good-bye, Your Royal Highness,” adding as the coach pulled away, “and we hope forever.”\n\nMargaret made an exquisite bride. Her dress, designed largely by Tony and his friend Carl Toms, though ostensibly by Norman Hartnell, had three layers of organza over tulle. With it she wore her magnificent Poltimore tiara (known to her intimates as “me second-best tarara”), high and regal-looking with its stylized diamond leaves and flowers scintillating against her dark hair. Her wedding ring was of Welsh gold—some of the gold from which the Queen’s wedding ring was made had been set aside for Margaret—her high-heeled shoes were white, and she carried a bouquet of white orchids.\n\nTony was a slight, elegant figure in his wedding morning coat, by the tailors who had made suits for him since he was an Eton schoolboy, Denman & Goddard of Sackville Street. Gina Ward, sitting on the aisle, watched him as he proceeded carefully down it, his slight limp from his childhood bout with polio barely noticeable. Outside the abbey and down the Mall, there were packed crowds of onlookers. As Tony led Margaret onto the Buckingham Palace balcony soon after one o’clock, to stand there with the Queen, Prince Philip, and the royal children, the cheering rose to a crescendo.\n\nAt the wedding breakfast for 120 afterward, with the band of the Grenadier Guards outside playing Princess Margaret’s favorite tunes from Oklahoma!, Prince Philip made a short speech welcoming Tony as the newest member of the royal family, to which Tony replied before he and the Princess cut the six-foot wedding cake. After the breakfast, Tony and the Princess, now in yellow silk, drove in an open-topped Rolls-Royce to Battle Bridge Pier, on the Thames (near London Bridge), where the royal yacht, Britannia, was waiting. As the Princess stepped on board, her personal standard was flown, and five minutes later Britannia set off downstream.\n\nEarly one evening, as the Tennants sat by their house on Mustique, looking out to sea, they saw Britannia arrive and lower a boat. A young officer came ashore in it to ask if they would like to come aboard for dinner. “I sent a message back saying we’d love to,” said Anne Tennant, “but that, as we hadn’t had a bath for a month, could we possibly have a bath first? Our hut was very primitive—no hot water, electric light, or anything like that.” They were given a cabin and a bath, and during the course of dinner Colin Tennant told the newlyweds of the beautiful empty beaches of white sand, suggesting they choose a different one every day. There were eight of them on the three-mile-by-one-mile island.\n\nFrom then on, each morning sailors from Britannia would go to the chosen beach, set up a miniature camp with a small tent for shade, and lay out a picnic lunch and drinks before departing to leave the couple entirely alone. In the evenings they would join the Tennants for drinks. During one of these evenings Colin, realizing that he and Anne had not given them a wedding present, said to his old friend Margaret, “Look, ma’am, would you like something in a little box or … “—waving his arm about—“a piece of land?” “A piece of land,” replied Margaret, looking at Tony, who smiled in agreement, although the offer actually confirmed his growing dislike of Colin: wedding presents, Tony felt, should be given to a couple jointly, rather than to one person only, as Colin clearly intended.\n\nThree weeks later, on June 18, the Armstrong-Joneses arrived back in England. On their return, they moved into No. 10 Kensington Palace, a smallish, detached 18th-century house on the north side of the palace, while the apartment designated for them, No. 1A, was being restored.\n\nTo the delight of Anne Rosse, they spent New Year’s 1961 at Birr Castle, her husband’s country estate in Ireland. Margaret asked her old beau, Billy Wallace, and Tony invited Jeremy and Camilla Fry—a clear signal that, although he had been unable to have Jeremy as his best man, the friendship was still strong. His sister and Lord and Lady Rupert Nevill were also there. The visit was not altogether sunshine and light. Margaret disliked what she thought of as Anne’s “posing” and deliberately did not tell Anne by what name to call her; Anne, who did not dare risk a snub, did what she could to rectify this lack of intimacy by calling her new daughter-in-law Darling.\n\nAt the top of his profession before his marriage, Tony had never envisaged giving up work, although he knew that the commercial photography he had done previously was no longer a viable option. One day when he and Margaret were staying with Jeremy and Camilla Fry, Cecil Beaton came over for a drink before lunch. When Beaton fulsomely congratulated the Princess on her marriage, adding, “May I thank you, ma’am, for removing my most dangerous rival,” Margaret replied, poker-faced, “What makes you think Tony is going to give up work?” Beaton paled.\n\nOn January 23, 1961, Tony joined the Council of Industrial Design as an unpaid adviser. It was work for which he was eminently suited, with his faultless eye for design and his capacity for taking endless trouble to achieve a desired end. But it was at best part-time, as he would soon discover, and not enough to use up his fizzing energy.\n\nThat autumn Tony was elevated to the peerage. One of the reasons he accepted a title, he later said, was for the sake of the child Margaret was about to bear. Highly unlikely though it was that the new baby should ever succeed, if it was a boy it would be close in line to the throne—and would it have done to have a former Mr. Jones as King? On October 3, 1961, Tony became the Earl of Snowdon, with the courtesy title of Viscount Linley of Nymans.\n\nAt the end of October the Princess moved back into Clarence House to await the birth of their baby. The question of children had never been discussed before their marriage; once married, Tony found that he desperately wanted them, and the Princess lovingly agreed. On November 3 their son, David Albert Charles, was born by Cesarean section. Princess Alice of Athlone, who came to lunch to see the baby, remarked when she came down from visiting Margaret, “Almost anyone could be that boy’s mother—he’s so like his father.”\n\nDavid was to be christened in December, at Buckingham Palace, which naturally meant a christening photograph. Because Tony had given up his photographic studio, he no longer had an assistant. He still, however, photographed members of the royal family for their private albums and to record special family moments. As he himself necessarily had to be in many of the wedding or christening groups, he needed someone of proven experience and absolute discretion to help him, both to set up the picture and to click the shutter once he had dashed into the group. The obvious person was Bob Belton.\n\nAt his first royal-group photograph, of the six-week-old David Linley at Buckingham Palace, Belton was terrified. He and Tony had set up their equipment in the White Drawing Room, and then Tony had gone to join the christening party of about 200, leaving Belton alone with his nerves. Just before the royal family was due to enter, he went to check the cameras. As he did so, the door opened and a two-year-old child ran in, followed by a woman. “I’m sorry,” she said as she chased the child. “At this age they get their fingers into everything.” Belton looked up to see the Queen, who smiled and said, “You’re Tony’s friend.” Her manner was so relaxed and friendly that his terror left him, though there were still occasional pitfalls. Tony had reassured him that the royal family was very easy to “direct,” and that if you wanted the Queen to turn her head, say, slightly to the left, you simply said, “Ma’am, please could you look to the left.” What he had not reckoned on was that in the large christening-group photograph there were seven women entitled to be called ma’am, so when he uttered the fateful sentence seven heads swiveled as one.\n\nTony was immediately besotted with his son, so much so that two months after David’s birth he did not want to leave him and fly with his wife for their planned three-week winter holiday in Antigua. But as Margaret, who had been brought up largely by nannies and governesses, pointed out, provided little David got his bottle every four hours, he would not mind whether it was his mother or the new, very experienced nanny, Verona Sumner, who gave it to him. (Unlike the Queen, Margaret did not feed her children herself.) Sumner, an excellent nanny, was another who disliked Tony, mainly because he wanted too much to do with “her” baby.\n\nLondon’s Top Couple\n\nNo. 1A Kensington Palace, one of two habitations in a beautiful Christopher Wren building and the largest of the apartments in the Kensington Palace complex, had for many years been allowed to run down and was so dilapidated when it was proposed for the Snowdons that they were unable to move into it until mid-March 1963.\n\nMore servants were needed to run the household at No. 1A, a four-story residence with about 20 rooms. The Princess, who had never done anything for herself except wash her King Charles spaniel and dry him with her hair dryer, would not have contemplated even the lightest task, such as arranging flowers. The male staff—chef, chauffeur, butler, under-butler, and footman—were Tony’s province. The female—housekeeper, nanny, nursemaid, kitchen maid, and dresser—were engaged by the Princess. Ruby Gordon, the Princess’s original dresser, had shown her hostility to Tony once too often and had been replaced by Isobel Mathieson. For the Snowdons’ servants, life was hard work. The average working day for the butler and under-butler, for example, began at 7:30 a.m. with the setting up of calling (early-morning tea) trays and breakfast trays and ended at 10:30 p.m., after the dinner dishes had been washed.\n\nHard though the terms seem today, there was much competition for a place in the Snowdon household: nowhere else could such a large and interesting collection of the best-known faces in the land be seen at close quarters. While the Snowdons were still in complete, loving accord, Kensington Palace became the most enjoyable place in the country to be asked to. Tony and the Princess were undoubtedly the nation’s most popular and glamorous couple. They were highly visible and royal at a time when being invited to a royal palace was the ultimate social accolade.\n\nTheir parties were gatherings of the beautiful and the famous: Dudley Moore, the comedian and musician, would play the piano; Cleo Laine would sing, along with her husband, the jazz musician John Dankworth; Peter Sellers, the comedic actor and close friend of Tony’s, would become different comic characters; Spike Milligan, the Goon Show creator, and the songwriter Richard Stilgoe would play off each other; John Betjeman, the future poet laureate, would tell stories.\n\nAnyone who was asked to spend an evening en famille, often with the Princess playing the piano and singing songs from one of the musicals she loved, felt especially honored. Even such hardened sophisticates as Noël Coward invariably recorded these soirées as “charming,” confiding to his diary that when she sang his songs, accompanying herself on the piano, “Princess Margaret surprisingly good. She has an impeccable ear, her piano playing is simple but has perfect rhythm, and her method of singing is really very funny.”\n\nThe Snowdons also made the most desirable of guests, for those who had the nerve to ask them back. After Angie Huth (later to blossom as a novelist) and her first husband, Quentin Crewe, a friend of Tony’s from their days together at Queen magazine, had been invited to lunch at Kensington Palace, she thought of asking the Snowdons to one of her after-dinner parties. “We always had the people of those days—the Rolling Stones, [the film-and-TV critic] George Melly, the Tynans [Kenneth Tynan was England’s leading drama critic]—so we thought they might enjoy it. I rang up Princess Margaret and asked her if she’d like to come, and she said she’d love to. I remember [the agent and publisher] Anthony Blond being very drunk, [the popular singer] Sandie Shaw standing there with bare feet as usual, Elaine Dundy [Mrs. Tynan] sitting under the piano, and Shirley MacLaine holding hands with [the novelist] Edna O’Brien. Princess Margaret absolutely adored it, and they stayed until seven a.m. From then on we were tremendously good friends.”\n\nKenneth Tynan, a great party giver, would ask the Snowdons with such people as the actress Jean Marsh, the playwright Peter Shaffer, the poet Christopher Logue, and the polymath Jonathan Miller, along with Spike Milligan, the director Peter Brook, the writer Alan Sillitoe, the comedian Peter Cook, and their respective wives.\n\nFor the Princess especially, these gatherings were diverting, for when she found she was expecting her second child she canceled virtually all her public engagements (pregnancy was a much more private affair then) and, to fill her days, saw as many friends as she could. Since Angie Huth was pregnant at the same time and had been ordered by her doctor to stay in bed for six months, Princess Margaret and Tony would often stop by, set up a screen at the foot of her bed, and watch a film. Often, if the Crewes had no one to cook for them, complete meals for four would be sent on trays to Wilton Crescent from Kensington Palace.\n\nOne Star Too Many\n\nCracks soon began to appear in the Snowdon marriage, though at this early stage they were visible only to those closest to them. The trouble was that both were stars, accustomed to being the focus of attention, and a certain competitiveness was almost inevitable. The Princess was royal, but Tony was magnetic, and wittier. There were arguments and, more ominously, the beginning of the put-downs, then usually disguised as a joke, that were later so to unnerve the Princess. In the late summer of 1963, when they were invited by the rich Greek shipowner Stavros Niarchos to stay on his private island of Spetsopoula, friends on a nearby island held a party to celebrate Margaret’s birthday, August 21. Tony arrived, bringing with him a present for everyone except his wife. Later a barbecue was planned, and the Princess shouted from upstairs to Tony, “Oh, darling, what shall I wear?” He replied, “Oh, I think that ball gown you wore last week.” Margaret, knowing it was a celebration, aware of the grand Niarchos style, and brought up in ball-gown culture, suspected nothing and arrived downstairs dressed to the hilt to find everyone else in jeans and sandals.\n\nBack at home, pregnant, bored, and aware that her husband was steadily immersing himself more and more in his work and the coterie of those with whom he worked closely, she became more rather than less possessive, trying to track him down by telephone or turning up unexpectedly at a restaurant or at his studio. Tony would come home later and later, usually to disappear immediately to his basement workroom or to the office next door. His low boredom threshold, his solipsistic view of the world, his need to be surrounded by the witty and beautiful, his instinct to push away a woman if he felt hemmed in by possessiveness or “clinginess,” and his scarcely conscious determination to do something or meet someone only when he wanted to meant that he would often refuse Princess Margaret’s demands that he “come and meet X.” On these occasions, he would shut the door and remain out of sight, leaving the imperious Margaret at a loss.\n\nAlthough the Princess had less to do than usual, Tony, conversely, had never been busier. There were still portraits—Charlie Chaplin laughing at lunch in a restaurant in Vevey, Switzerland, his napkin held up to his face; David Hockney in a Paddington street carrying a huge gold handbag (in an era when even a satchel carried by a man would have been looked at askance); Sophia Loren in an ornamental bath, her small, naked son in the crook of one arm. More important, there was the opening in October 1964 of the Snowdon Aviary at the London Zoo, a 150-foot-long, 80-foot-high tour de force of gauzy metal net in pyramidal shapes held up by aluminum poles. Designed by Tony and two colleagues, it looked almost as weightless as the birds flying around inside it, yet the filmy mesh used 118 miles of wire.\n\nThe birth of their second child, Sarah Frances Elizabeth, in the nursery of 1A Kensington Palace on May 1, 1964, brought the Snowdons together again temporarily. Immediately, Tony sent his assistant to Feltons, the flower shop on Brompton Road, for a huge bouquet for his wife, and, anxious not to go against the protocol that decreed that the Queen must be the first to know of the baby’s birth and sex, instructed him, “If they do it up in pink ribbon, hide it—otherwise the press’ll know that it’s a girl.” An hour after the birth, he was allowed to see Margaret and his daughter. Then he telephoned the Queen, the Queen Mother, his own mother, and his sister.\n\nMother and baby were soon visited by the Queen Mother, sparkling with diamonds but clad in deepest black with black osprey feathers in her hat, as the court was in mourning for the King of Greece. She was followed by her sister-in-law Princess Alice, who came down the stairs remarking, “This must be a very happy day for you, Elizabeth.” “Well, it is, Alice,” responded the Queen Mother, “but I find it so difficult to look convincingly happy in black.” Unfortunately, “convincingly happy” would soon be a phrase that could not be applied to the Snowdon marriage.\n\nTheir divorce, however, would not occur until 14 years later. On May 10, 1978, a statement was issued from Kensington Palace: “Her Royal Highness The Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon, and the Earl of Snowdon, after two years of separation, have agreed that their marriage should be formally ended. Accordingly, Her Royal Highness will start the necessary legal proceedings.”\n\nExcerpted from Snowdon: The Biography, by Anne de Courcy; © by the author."
