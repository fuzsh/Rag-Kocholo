Where a moment before the room had been filled with the sound of grunts, squeals, and squeaks, the author and his wife ­were greeted by an ex­pec­tant silence as sixty healthy-­ looking pigs turned ­toward the door, sat down on their b­ ehinds—­and coughed. The surprisingly ­human sound of sixty coughing pigs has stayed with us to this day. For the purposes of this book, the sound is doubly significant ­because t­ hese coughing pigs had not received any antibiotics. Instead, they w ­ ere part of an experiment by the pig farmer, who was giving us an impromptu two-­hour tour of the farm’s facilities. Having heard of my research, the farmer insisted that I get an inside look at how conventional agriculture ­really works. The ­family farm specializes in fattening piglets and selling them for slaughter. While its capacity of 4,000 pigs is small compared to US concentrated animal feeding operations, the farm we ­were touring is a fairly typical example of pig production in northern Eu­rope. One of only two surviving farms in the village, it had formerly also produced crops, raised ­cattle, and bred ­horses. However, following the 1960s, it had heeded the maxim of “get big or get out” and specialized in pig production. While it still grows cereals to feed its pigs, the farm’s c­ attle have long since gone and h ­ orses are now mostly kept as lodgers paid for by wealthy urbanites. As part of a fine-­tuned just-­in-­time production system, the farmer starts the day by checking international commodity prices on the Chicago Board of Trade’s website. If the price is right, pigs are bought and sold with a click. Despite 1\n\n2 • The Sound of Coughing Pigs\n\ningrained agricultural pessimism about market outlooks, business is g­ oing well. The farmer is a well-­respected member of the local community and has just built another high-­tech pig sty. And yet, the farm’s ­future seems uncertain. One of our farmer’s main concerns is the increasing po­liti­cal focus on husbandry practices in conventional agriculture. Getting planning permission for the new sty was challenging enough ­because of local complaints about the smell. However, in an accurate premonition, the farmer is most concerned about mounting pressure on Eu­ro­pean Union (EU) regulators to restrict routine antibiotic use on farms. And this is where we come back to our coughing pigs: caught between competing expert narratives, the coughing pigs are the farmer’s own DIY experiment to gauge w ­ hether antibiotics are r­ eally necessary for the farm’s mode of production. It seems that they are. Although no costly disease diagnosis was made, the other piglets reaching the farm on the same lorry received antibiotics prophylactically and did not fall ill. In a business where the difference between profit and loss is de­cided by the length of time and the amount of feed it takes to produce an animal, coughing pigs are a prob­lem. So what is the farmer to do? Sacrifice a business model that has worked for more than forty years or support lobbying efforts to delay the implementation of stricter antibiotic regulations? This was the dilemma the pig farmer posed to us. What follows is the history of how this antibiotic dilemma came about.\n\nThe Antibiotic Dilemma Antibiotics are part of a wider f­ amily of antimicrobial drugs with activity against a variety of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other eukaryotic parasites. Revolutionizing the medical marketplace from the early twentieth ­century onwards, modern antimicrobials comprise synthetic antimicrobials (e.g., sulfonamides), biological antibiotics—­substances produced by microorganisms to act against other microorganisms (e.g., penicillin), and semisynthetic or modified biological antimicrobials (e.g., methicillin).1 In public discourse, the terms antibiotic and antimicrobial are frequently conflated. For the sake of simplicity, this book uses the most well-­known term: antibiotic. The modern prominence of antibiotics is hard to exaggerate. In schools, ­children learn the story of Alexander Fleming’s 1928 discovery of the antibacterial qualities of the Penicillium notatum mold, museums feature exhibitions on “yellow magic,” and patients and doctors routinely take and prescribe antibiotics for vari­ous ailments. So common and impor­tant have antibiotics become that recent books even talk of an “antibiotic era”2 in ­human medicine from the 1930s onward. What is, however, often forgotten is that antibiotics have also come to play a significant role in food production. In fact, more than 50 ­percent of global antibiotic production is not destined for ­human use.3\n\nThe Sound of Coughing Pigs • 3\n\nThe origins of non-­human antibiotic use lie in the interwar period. Starting during this time, dramatic changes began to transform livestock production. Over the following decades, sizes and animal concentrations grew rapidly while new breeds and production systems changed the biological rhythms of livestock production. Although ­there ­were significant variations between dif­f er­ ent sectors and regions, growing numbers of animals dis­appeared into confined high-­input housing systems or mixed indoor-­outdoor systems. Breeding programs and fierce competition resulted in the dominance of a small number of animal breeds that ­were particularly efficient at converting feed into meat. Meanwhile, concentration pro­cesses increased both the productivity of animal husbandry and the investments necessary to survive oversaturated markets. In a pro­cess known as vertical integration, many producers now contract or work directly for larger corporations, which often control not only animal production but also feed production, slaughtering, and pro­cessing.4 Changes w ­ ere particularly impressive in the poultry industry. Whereas a meat-­producing broiler chicken took 112 days to reach an average market weight of 2.8 pounds in 1935, it only needed 47 days to reach a live market weight of 4.7 pounds in 1995.5 Chickens’ bodies changed accordingly. Starting in the 1950s, heavier broiler chickens began to replace older va­ri­e­ties like the Rhode Island Red.6 Since then, poultry meat has become a cheap and popu­lar food with a small number of companies dominating international production.7 Pig and ­cattle production have also become more concentrated—­although the pro­cess was often more fragmented and confinement slower to develop.8 In the twenty-­first c­ entury, the intensive (confined and concentrated) and industrial (integrated) production of animals is fast becoming the global norm.9 One of the most formidable obstacles faced by expanding animal production is infectious disease. Prior to the interwar period, farmers had already attempted to increase herd densities. However, despite the use of antibacterial compounds like organoarsenics, infectious disease remained a serious threat. This situation changed during the 1940s. Within a de­cade, cheap antibiotics became routine components of the agricultural fight against bacterial infection.10 Farmers soon found that antibiotics could also be used prophylactically to prevent infections from spreading in the first place. A significant third ­factor contributing to agriculture’s antibiotic adoption was that even small doses of some antibiotics—if fed regularly—­a llegedly enabled animals to metabolize feedstuffs more efficiently. The mechanics ­behind the so-­called antibiotic growth effect remain unclear. While postwar researchers believed that antibiotics optimized the microbial flora in animals’ digestive systems,11 con­temporary theories posit (1) that by inhibiting bacterial digestion, antibiotics maximize the amount of available sugar, (2) that feeding antibiotics f­avors vitamin-­ producing bacteria and combats toxin-­producing bacteria, and (3) that antibiotics favorably change the acidity of animals’ stomachs.12\n\n4 • The Sound of Coughing Pigs\n\nAlthough the past seven de­cades have seen consistent controversies over the mechanisms, extent, and very existence of the antibiotic growth effect,13 antibiotics’ tripartite function of combating and preventing infection and saving feedstuffs was a winning combination. Alongside other similarly impor­tant interventions like new vaccines, improved housing, nutrition, and breeds,14 antibiotics aided a significant reduction of animal mortality. Whereas mortality in US broiler production was 10 ­percent in 1945, it sank to 8 ­percent in 1950, 6 ­percent in 1960, and 4.8 ­percent in 2015. Meanwhile, feed efficacy improved from 4 pounds of feed consumed to produce one pound of meat in 1945 to 2.5 pounds in 1960 and 1.82 pounds in 2018.15 Then as now, the bound­aries between therapeutic, prophylactic, and growth promotional antibiotic use frequently blurred. Antibiotics also entered other areas of food production. In addition to a brief ­career as food preservatives, they are still used to combat bacterial infections of crops and fruit and to protect bees.16 While it is impor­tant to note that agricultural industrialization would have occurred with or without their discovery,17 cheap antibiotics thus greatly facilitated the monoculture-­like concentration of organisms and the substitution of h ­ uman l­abor in modern livestock production. Over time, antibiotics’ extensive use created significant infrastructure-­like physical and cultural dependencies in global food production.18 While antibiotic infrastructures continue to influence con­temporary husbandry and disease management systems, the resulting chemical cornucopia has also come at a price. Agricultural antibiotics face three dif­fer­ent strands of criticism. First, according to some critics, antibiotics have enabled a neglect of animal welfare and allow inhumane factory farms to profit from animals’ suffering. Second, many consumers and health authorities are also concerned about drug residues in food, ­water, and the environment. Some antibiotics are allergenic and can e­ ither sensitize individuals or trigger existing antibiotic allergies.19 Allergic reactions can range from stomach irritations to the eruption of painful hives on the skin. In the worst case, allergies can trigger a life-­threatening anaphylactic shock when antibiotics are administered in higher doses. A third and increasingly vocal group of critics focuses on antibiotics’ se­lection for antimicrobial re­sis­tance (AMR).20 Although agriculture’s exact contribution to the global AMR burden remains contested, bacteria’s increasing ability to “resist” antibiotics is now widely held to be one of the most pressing global health challenges of the twenty-­ first ­century. The ­causes of AMR are complex. Bacteria can be ­either intrinsically resistant to an antibiotics or acquire re­sis­tance to it. In the case of intrinsic re­sis­tance, the natu­ral characteristics of a bacterium’s biology (e.g., cell wall or metabolism) can make it “immune” to certain antibiotics. For example, the iconic penicillin G is in­effec­tive against most gram-­negative bacteria, which possess double cell walls. Other bacteria may also already “naturally” possess the mechanisms with which to “resist” antibiotics, such as enzymes that deactivate\n\nThe Sound of Coughing Pigs • 5\n\nFIGURE A.1 Modes and mechanisms of AMR transfer.\n\nantibiotics, the ability to modify antibiotic target sites, or efflux pumps with which to pump antibiotics out of the bacterial cell. By contrast, acquired re­sis­ tance arises from spontaneous bacterial mutations and the acquisition of resistance-­conferring mobile genes. Increased tolerance to an antibiotic ­will give a bacterium an evolutionary advantage over its peers the next time it is exposed to the respective antibiotic or to substances with similar effects (co-­selection).21 Intrinsic and acquired re­sis­tance can pass from one bacteria generation to the next (vertical gene transfer). However, bacteria also possess the remarkable ability to “communicate” information on how to resist antibiotics among each other in a pro­cess called horizontal gene transfer. Whereas mutations bring new AMR genes into the world, horizontal gene transfer is the major force spreading ­these genes across the globe. Horizontal gene transfer can e­ ither occur as a result of transduction, during which re­sis­tance genes (R-­factors) are inserted into the bacterial genome by viral bacteriophages; transformation, during which bacteria absorb free-­floating resistance-­encoding DNA sequences; and as a result of conjugation (“bacterial sex”), during which bacteria exchange small circular DNA strands called plasmids, which encode R-­factors.22 It is difficult to exaggerate the implications of horizontal gene transfer. ­Because ge­ne­tic information can be exchanged between bacteria of dif­fer­ent\n\n6 • The Sound of Coughing Pigs\n\nspecies, an antibiotic-­resistant yet innocuous Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacterium can pass on its re­sis­tance to a pathogenic Salmonella bacterium. Significantly, it is often not just re­sis­tance against one but against several antibiotics that is transferred en bloque. This en bloque transfer occurs ­because re­sis­tance genes tend to be stockpiled in mobile regions of the bacterial genome that are more easily transferred to other bacteria—­the mobilome—­such as plasmids and integrons. Any bacterium receiving such a genomic island via horizontal gene transfer can immediately resist multiple antibiotics. Exposing this bacterium to one of ­these antibiotics or related substances ­will automatically co-­select for all of the other re­sis­tance information encoded on the genomic island.23 Even sublethal concentrations of antibiotics, such as diluted antibiotics in rivers or in animal feeds and medicines, can select for clinically relevant re­sis­tance genes.24 Once established, resistant organisms and genes routinely cross geographic and species borders. With approximately 60 ­percent of all infectious diseases (and 75 ­percent of emerging infectious diseases) affecting ­humans shared by other vertebrate animals, the se­lection of resistant pathogens in one population can have serious consequences for the other.25 This is not only true for established zoonotic pathogens but also for seemingly harmless bacteria. In associated methicillin-­ resistant Staphylococcus aureus the case of livestock-­ (CC398 MRSA), researchers found that the strain had originated as an antibiotic susceptible ­human Staphylococcus aureus strain that had jumped to livestock, where it had acquired re­sis­tance to methicillin and tetracycline (prob­ably as a result of agricultural antibiotic use) before reinfecting ­humans in contact with farm animals.26 Horizontal gene transfer means that a similar ecological blurring of AMR risks is also occurring b­ ecause of the spread of AMR genes selected in one species and geographic environment to another. De­cades of continuous antibiotic use have led to a significant enrichment and se­lection for AMR in the global microbiome. It is uncertain ­whether ­there is a way back from this Anthropocene of the cell.27 Although the higher energy cost of maintaining AMR means that some bacteria may regain sensitivity once se­lection pressure is decreased, ­others may not. The case of the mobilized colistin resistance-1 (mcr-1) allele serves as a warning. In November 2015, Lancet Infectious Diseases reported that re­sis­tance against colistin, a member of the old antibiotic class of the polymyxins, had been detected in E. coli samples from Chinese pigs. Polymyxins w ­ ere commonly used in Chinese agriculture but also serve as last-­resort antibiotics in Western hospitals. Chromosomal polymyxin re­sis­tance via point mutations was well known and had relatively high fitness costs. What was alarming about the 2015 re­sis­tance detection was that the mcr-1 allele was encoded on a plasmid (i.e., prone to horizontal gene transfer) and associated with significantly lower fitness costs. ­Because polymyxins ­were rarely used in Chinese hospitals, AMR in local ­human populations had prob­ably\n\nThe Sound of Coughing Pigs • 7\n\narisen in agriculture; mcr-1 spread rapidly.28 Within a year, researchers had detected it in ­human and animal samples from five continents. Although plasmids containing mcr-1 have, at the time of writing, failed to accumulate re­sis­ tance to carbapenems, the other group of antibiotics used to treat resistant Enterobacteriaceae, this is likely only a ­matter of time.29 The case of mcr-1 highlights the potential of untreatable pandemic strains emerging as a result of local antibiotic exposure in h ­ umans, animals, or the environment.\n\nFarmyard Realities Faced with surging AMR and no new antibiotic classes since the 1980s, a growing number of politicians, experts, and consumers agree that the combined price of AMR, residues, and inadequate welfare outweighs the productivity benefits conferred by agricultural antibiotic use. ­Others disagree. Back on the farm, our farmer’s answer is mixed. In the case of residue and welfare allegations, the farmer denies that t­ here are serious prob­lems. Although individual black sheep may ignore guidelines, strict Eu­ro­pean testing and new legislation have solved previous prob­lems. The farmer is more defensive when it comes to AMR: Yes, AMR is a significant prob­lem. But who is to say that agricultural antibiotics are responsible for it? A ­ ren’t patients and doctors more to blame for antibiotic overuse? ­Don’t consumers drive agricultural antibiotic use by demanding cheap meat? And why should the farmer stop using antibiotics if foreign competitors continue to use them? The farmers’ opinions are legitimate and should be taken seriously. They also reflect more than seventy-­five years of disputes over agricultural antibiotic regulation and increasingly fragmented notions of antibiotic risk. Understanding the ­factors driving this fragmentation of perceptions and resulting impacts on antibiotic regulation is the central aim of this book. Breaking with previous historiography’s emphasis on ­human antibiotic use, it provides a unifying lens through which to analyze the often contradictory actions and perceptions of multiple actors and groups. What emerges is a familiar story of spreading dependencies and narrowly conceived regulatory solutions. Perhaps more importantly, it is also a story of how one group of substances acquired multiple meanings in dif­fer­ent communities. This second story not only complicates moralistic accounts of “Big Ag” or “Big Pharma,” it also serves as a cautionary tale about short-­term thinking when it comes to current drug licensing and antibiotic stewardship.30 Two observations on the nature of risk and group formation help the book tackle its topic. The first observation is that differing risk cultures (epistemes) have played a crucial role in allowing global antibiotic use and AMR to rise to ­ ecause risk epistemes are difficult to reconstruct by looking at current levels. B one nation in isolation, the book compares the development of antibiotic risk\n\n8 • The Sound of Coughing Pigs\n\nepistemes in the United States and the United Kingdom. Both nations w ­ ere key to structuring the antibiotic infrastructure underpinning modern food production. However, the comparative analy­sis shows that distinct cultural priorities, agricultural infrastructures, and regulatory path dependencies produced very dif­f er­ent risk epistemes. The book’s second central observation is that each national risk episteme was strongly influenced by how antibiotic risk was staged in three overlapping social spheres: the general public, the agricultural community, and the regulatory community. Communities in each sphere developed their own understanding of antibiotics’ risks and benefits. Over time, diverging understandings fostered the formation of rival groups and triggered increasingly fierce clashes over how agricultural antibiotics should be viewed, used, and regulated. Clashes occurred both within and between spheres. The wider national risk episteme was a continuously evolving reflection of ­these domestic clashes. The book’s twin focus on risk epistemes and communicative spheres is inspired by sociologists Ulrich Beck and Niklas Luhmann. In his seminal Risikogesellschaft (1986), Ulrich Beck highlighted the importance of risk for driving societal action. According to Beck, risk is the probability-­based anticipation of catastrophe but not the catastrophe itself. Socie­ties and individuals constantly strive to avoid predicted risks. ­Because every­thing can theoretically be interpreted as a risk, ­there is a constant strug­gle over ­whether a risk is real, negligible, or urgent.31 Risk’s infinite nature also means that no definitive expertise is pos­si­ble. In the virtual world of risk, “no one is an expert or every­one is an expert.”32 As a consequence, the “objectivity of a risk is the product of its [cultural] perception and [social/objective] staging.”33 Within ­every society, existing inequalities mean that certain groups ­will be more successful at staging their version of risk and distributing resulting burdens than ­others. Often, the poorest and weakest end up bearing the greatest risk. Understanding how risk-­ based group identities emerge and interact is crucial if one wants to unravel the patchwork of national and international regulations that has emerged around antibiotic use. It is ­here that the communicative sociology of Niklas Luhmann can serve as a useful tool. According to Luhmann, e­ very society comprises multitudes of smaller subsystems with relatively autonomous modes of communication: the smaller the group, the more distinct its communication and attitudes. Each subsystem or sphere attempts to frame or stage its version of real­ ity for other spheres. A society’s values, identities, and risk definitions are the contingent result of this potpourri of competing worldviews.34 As the anecdotal example of our pig farmer and recent social sciences research show, perceptions of antibiotic risk have certainly begun to differ between farmers and the wider public as well as between dif­fer­ent countries—­even experts’ risk heuristics have been found to be affective and culturally biased.35 ­These findings should not surprise us. Over the past three de­cades, science and\n\nThe Sound of Coughing Pigs • 9\n\ntechnology studies (STS) research has revealed the rootedness of risk in distinct—­often national—­contexts. Sheila Jasanoff has described how cultural values, ­legal systems, and differing modes of knowledge production have created unique “civic epistemologies.”36 Historians have also explored who gets to decide ­whether risks are relevant, can be regulated, and should be monitored. In this context, Alexander Schwerin has highlighted the role of national “risk epistemes”—­the complex nexus of po­liti­cal interests, expert epistemologies, institutional path dependencies, and technological heuristics—in deciding over the perception and management of environmental and technological ­hazards.37 Emphasizing the role of risk evaluation and management is impor­tant. In contrast to an unavoidable calamity, risk is both a ­hazard and an opportunity. Historically, formal risk definitions have played a significant role in transforming hazardous technologies from unpredictable dangers into calculable and thus manageable entities.38 Phenomena that can be predicted can be accounted for and integrated into cap­i­tal­ist modes of re­distribution and commodification. In the context of chemical and phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal regulation, numerous historians and STS scholars have pointed to the role of threshold models and boundary values in allowing hazardous substances to permeate workspaces, environments, and ­human bodies. In contrast to a zero-­tolerance attitude ­toward risk, exposure to chemicals, radiation, and other ­hazards is deemed acceptable if it stays below a defined level. Large parts of industrial production now depend on the normalization of risk by a specialized regulatory branch of science.39 For ­those who are unwilling to accept this normalization of risk, a lucrative market offers ways to further reduce exposure via insurance, “pure” food, or “safe” housing. However, not every­body can afford to opt out of normal risk. In most countries, risk exposure varies significantly along familiar socioeconomic divides.40 What is generally accepted as normal risk can also shift. Tolerance of technologies is often linked to historically fluid cultural notions of purity and naturalness.41 According to Sheila Jasanoff: “The demarcation between the natu­ral and the unnatural in any society is not given in advance but is crafted through situated, culturally specific forms of boundary work.”42 For regulators, the shifting results of public, industrial, and scientific boundary work pose a constant challenge: What if some experts say that the theoretical risk of a new technology is too ­great for it to be licensed but ­others disagree? Should a potentially beneficial technology be licensed even if prevalent cultural sentiment is against it? Should one wait ­until concrete proof of harm arises or should one listen to societal “gut instincts” and enforce precautionary bans? What if a technology is already on the market and new evidence challenges previous safety models? Over time, two contested philosophies have developed to address this epistemic challenge. One philosophy holds that concrete evaluations of proven\n\n10 • The Sound of Coughing Pigs\n\ncosts and benefits should decide over technological regulation. The other philosophy holds that precautionary bans are justifiable if ­there is strong reason to suspect harm—­even without conclusive evidence of it having occurred.43 The long conflict about agricultural antibiotics takes us right to the heart of the competitive staging of risk, its distribution, and the intricacies of precautionary and cost-­benefit regulation. From the 1940s onward, socie­ties had to decide which of antibiotics’ benefits to enjoy at the cost of which risk. Meanwhile, changing conceptions of food safety and evolving AMR science repeatedly led to redefinitions of antibiotics’ “true risk.” Caught between agro-­industrial interests and vocal medical, consumer, and animal welfare activists, regulators strug­gled to define boundary values for safe agricultural antibiotic use. One person’s meat was another person’s poison. Over time, dif­f er­ent risk epistemes led to divergent regulation: reacting to industry pressure and public concerns, US regulators focused on monitoring food and milk for antibiotic residues. Meanwhile, new surveillance technologies and popu­lar concerns made British regulators prioritize AMR over residue h ­ azards. In 1969, the British Swann report recommended precautionary bans of low-­dosed growth promoter feeds containing medically relevant antibiotics. Swann-­inspired growth promoter bans ­were subsequently ­adopted in Britain and the Eu­ro­pean Economic Community (EEC) but not in the United States, where regulators continued to focus on preventing residues and favored cost-­benefit evaluations. In recent de­cades, the regulatory gap has widened with the EU expanding antibiotic growth promoter bans between 1997 and 2006 and announcing plans to ban prophylactic and forms of metaphylactic (control treatment of animal groups) antibiotic use by 2022 in late 2018.44 Although the effects of bans on AMR remain contested, EU agricultural antibiotic sales roughly stagnated between 2011 and 2014 with approximately 9,909 tons consumed in 2014 before falling by about 20 ­percent to 7,860 tons in 2016.45 By contrast, the United States did not enact full statutory bans. While sales increased by 22 ­percent to 15,576 tons between 2009 and 2015, voluntary feed restrictions, industry reforms, regulatory threats, and changing consumer preferences have, however, led to a significant drop of consumption by about 30 ­percent to 10,933 tons between 2015 and 2017.46 This book’s four-­part structure reflects its transnational scope and the importance of the three domestic spheres—­public, agricultural, and regulatory—in shaping national risk epistemes. Each part studies a distinct phase of British or US antibiotic history and is divided into three chapters. Of ­these, one focuses on the public, one on the agricultural, and one on the regulatory perception and management of agricultural antibiotics. Inspired by Michelle Mart’s analy­ sis of US attitudes t­ oward pesticides, each chapter explores dominant themes and mutually reinforcing discourses on antibiotics.47\n\nThe Sound of Coughing Pigs • 11\n\nAnalyzed sources include national and regional newspapers, consumer and activist publications, fashion and lifestyle magazines, cookery books, organic and conventional farming magazines, agricultural and veterinary manuals, industry publications, and archival material from regulatory agencies. However, ­there remain limits to what ­these sources can tell us. Many of them are elite and ­were written about rather than by actors themselves. Meanwhile, media reporting on antibiotics was often monolithic and conservative in its framing of mainstream opinion. ­There is also no guarantee that information in handbooks, newspapers, or official publications was taken seriously by producers or consumers. Fi­nally, the sheer wealth of material means that it is impossible to cover all of the nuances of antibiotic opinion. This means that depictions of consumers, regulators, and farmers ­will often remain ideal types—­a fact exacerbated by the book’s transnational comparison, which to a certain degree depends on generalizable categories. However, ­these limitations should not deter curiosity or research. Although their coverage remains eclectic, keyword-­ searchable databases now give historians access to an unpre­ce­dented wealth of material on actors’ lives and opinions. The digital repositories informing this book have been chosen to reflect as many po­liti­cal and regional perspectives as pos­si­ble. While no single source group can fully reconstruct actors’ opinions and actions, grouping as many as pos­si­ble together provides a more detailed— if still grainy—­picture. The book’s four parts are ordered chronologically. Following a brief introduction to antibiotics and AMR, part 1 studies the emergence of agricultural antibiotic use in the United States. Chapter 2 describes the initial public optimism about agricultural antibiotics before analyzing the effects of 1950s concerns about chemical additives, carcinogens, and food purity on substances’ image. The chapter also highlights the divide between risk perceptions of AMR in medical and agricultural settings. Chapter 3 shows that antibiotics quickly ­ ere seamlessly acquired infrastructural relevance within US agriculture and w incorporated into existing feed industry marketing channels. Focusing on risk perceptions among conventional and organic farmers, it highlights that US farmers knew ­little about the new miracle drugs’ effects or potential ­hazards. Chapter 4 then describes the challenges US officials faced when regulating antibiotics. It shows that agricultural antibiotics’ risks ­were initially deemed negligible by a regulatory matrix that focused on “classic” toxic and carcinogenic ­hazards. Lacking resources and a coherent policy framework, regulators ­later strug­gled to enforce drug compliance and respond to AMR warnings. Part 2 focuses on Britain. Chapter 5 reconstructs how British public perceptions of antibiotic risk differed from ­those in the United States. During the 1960s, traditional concerns about animal welfare and new warnings about infectious re­sis­tance on factory farms created a power­ful alliance for AMR-­focused\n\n12 • The Sound of Coughing Pigs\n\nreform. Chapter 6 studies antibiotics’ hesitant adoption by Britain’s diverse agricultural community. It discusses the importance of close corporatist ties between the National Farmer Union (NFU) and government officials in overcoming initial skepticism regarding antibiotics and ensuring that ­later reforms did not harm farmers. Chapter 7 reconstructs how British officials first licensed antibiotics and then reviewed their use three times during the 1960s. Although their demands ­were repeatedly watered down, public health experts’ use of a technology called bacteriophage typing to track the spread of resistant organisms played a decisive role in forcing officials to implement precautionary yet narrow restrictions of antibiotic feeds as a result of the 1969 Swann report. Part 3 returns to the United States. Chapter 8 asks why US perceptions of agricultural antibiotics remained relatively unaffected by Eu­ro­pean AMR concerns. Between the 1970s and the mid-1990s, public opinion on antibiotic stewardship remained divided. This division was caused by ongoing residue fears, concerns about “stagflation,” and the increasingly partisan nature of environmentalist politics. Chapter 9 highlights how US farmers strug­gled to come to terms with non-­agricultural criticism of antibiotic use during a time of increasing economic pressure. It shows how hostility t­ oward government intervention and a seeming lack of alternative production methods made most conventional farmers support lobbyists’ campaigns against antibiotic restrictions. Although the mid-1980s saw organic intensification and financial pressure facilitate a market-­driven conciliation with conventional agriculture, it did not trigger a wider reform of production methods. Chapter 10 analyzes US officials’ reaction to new risk scenarios involving horizontal gene transfer. It shows that officials ­were divided in their assessment of precautionary Eu­ro­pean bans and underestimated industry opposition to antibiotic reform. ­A fter failing to restrict agricultural antibiotic use four times during the 1970s, government officials reverted to ­earlier policies of nonstatutory reform. Part 4 covers the era following the implementation of the Swann report in Britain. Chapter 11 reconstructs the 1970s fragmentation of public pressure for antibiotic reform, the re-­emergence of concerns about agricultural AMR se­lection around 1980, and the 1996 bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) crisis’s role in reigniting national reform campaigns. Chapter 12 studies the ­limited impact of initial antibiotic restrictions on British farming. A ­ fter a brief reduction during the early 1970s, agricultural antibiotic use soon recovered and continued to increase ­until the late 1990s. Similar to the United States, most British farmers continued to see antibiotics as an impor­tant component of modern production and risk management. It was only when corporatist decision-­ making began to fracture during the 1980s that AMR and residue ­hazards ­were discussed more extensively. Following the 1996 BSE crisis, agricultural opposition to further growth promoter bans was l­ imited. Chapter 13 asks why the\n\nThe Sound of Coughing Pigs • 13\n\nSwann report failed to curb ­either antibiotic use or AMR. It emphasizes the importance of interministerial rivalry and corporatist ties in watering down many proposals of the original report. With British efforts stagnating, Eu­ro­ pean integration played a decisive role in reinvigorating British antibiotic reform from the 1980s onward. Returning to our farmer and the coughing pigs, chapter 14 recapitulates the tumultuous history of agricultural antibiotics’ perception, use, and regulation. It asks ­whether this history can provide insights for current regulators. The chapter tells four cautionary stories about narrow reforms, infrastructural entanglements, epistemic fragmentation, and short-­termism before arguing for a new policy emphasis on microbial resilience.\n\nPart I\n\nUSA From Industrialized Agriculture to Manufactured ­Hazards, 1949–1967 Despite antibiotics’ Eu­ro­pean roots, it was in Amer­i­ca that the “antibiotic era” truly began. Profiting from early and reliable access to cheap antibiotics, US consumers, farmers, and regulators played a crucial role in deciding which forms of nonhuman antibiotic use ­were commercially ­viable and publicly acceptable. The three chapters of Part One map the early highs and lows of antibiotics’ ­career in US food production. They show that agricultural antibiotics’ rapid adoption was enabled by their seamless integration into agro-­pharmaceutical supply chains, their nontoxic properties, and the neo-­Malthusian framework of Cold War politics. The emergent antibiotic infrastructure soon began to cause prob­lems for consumers and farmers alike. However, reforms proved difficult. Facing a growing cost-­price squeeze, farmers felt unable to reduce antibiotic use. Attempting to reconcile consumer and producer interests, officials strug­gled to adapt regulatory frameworks. Between the 1950s and mid-1960s, a lack of cohesive antibiotic policies and the prioritization of antibiotic residues over AMR se­lection led to a “narrow” official focus on guaranteeing pure milk and establishing “safe” residue tolerances for meat. Although external pressure and new scenarios of horizontal gene transfer triggered a review of agricultural antibiotic use in 1965, the residue-­focused US risk episteme remained intact.\n\n2\n\nPicking One’s Poisons Antibiotics and the Public This chapter traces the turbulent history of agricultural antibiotics’ public image in the United States. Analyzing newspaper reports, fashion magazines, and cookbooks, it shows that agricultural antibiotics’ initial status as guarantors of plenty and signifiers of pro­gress became double-­edged during the late 1950s. This crisis of trust began with reports of antibiotic residues in food and milk and was exacerbated by a series of scandals surrounding the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Significantly, public awareness of antibiotic ­hazards other than residues remained ­limited. In the case of AMR, concerns centered on medical overuse and seldom touched on agricultural antibiotic use.\n\nEuphoria Although the use of naturally occurring antimicrobial remedies is prob­ably as old as humanity itself, the first half of the twentieth c­ entury saw the revolutionary introduction of effective, industrially produced antimicrobial drugs. Launched in 1910, Paul Ehrlich and Sahachiro Hata’s antisyphilitic Salvarsan (arsphenamine) triggered a large-­scale hunt for further “magic bullets” against disease. Scientists searched for substances that only targeted prokaryotic bacteria cells while leaving eukaryotic animal cells unharmed. In the 1930s, the discovery of Prontosil (Sulfamidochrysoïdine) by Gerhard Domagk and his colleagues at Bayer and the subsequent synthesis of chemically related drugs seemingly answered this challenge. The synthetic sulfonamides cured previously fatal 17\n\n18 • USA, 1949–1967\n\nbacterial infections and achieved prominence by saving the life of President Roo­se­velt’s son in 1936 and of Winston Churchill in 1943. Sulfonamides’ arrival also marked a high point for a new form of industrial phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal research. Housed in phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal laboratories, microbiologists screened compounds for antibacterial effects while chemists purified, mass-­produced, and modified promising compounds.1 By the 1940s, many sulfonamides’ toxic properties and growing bacterial re­sis­tance resulted in a second round of antibacterial research. A growing number of researchers now grew interested in the antimicrobial substances produced by certain microorganisms, which Selman Waksman termed “anti-­biotic” (“against-­life”) in 1941.2 Of this second generation of antibiotics, penicillin is undoubtedly the most iconic. Isolated and refined from the fungus Penicillium notatum in Oxford and subsequently modified and mass-­produced in the United States, penicillin cured many sulfonamide-­resistant infections. The vast resources deployed by the Allies to upscale penicillin production also made it exemplary of a new kind of planned “Big Science.”3 With production of both sulfonamides and unpatented penicillin expanding rapidly ­after 1945, prices collapsed and phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal companies began to search for new, patentable antibiotics. They did not have to look for long: employing mass-­screening techniques, companies experienced an antibiotic gold rush. In 1943, a team surrounding Selman Waksman had already discovered streptomycin. In 1946, Parke-­Davis isolated chloramphenicol. One year ­later, the Lederle Laboratories branch of American Cyanamid launched aureomycin (chlortetracycline). In 1949, Pfizer isolated terramycin (oxytetracycline), and Selman Waksman discovered neomycin. Meanwhile, Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin’s decryption of penicillin’s molecular structure indicated that a bountiful age of tailored antibiotics might be forthcoming.4 The resulting 1950s antibiotic euphoria is best captured in a series of paintings commissioned from American artist Robert Thom by drug manufacturer Parke-­Davis in 1957. Reminiscent of Norman Rockwell’s parallel portrayals of American plenty, Painting 39 of Thom’s series is titled “The Era of Antibiotics” and features a w ­ oman screening inhibitory substances beneath a portrait of Alexander Fleming. On the other side of a glass win­dow, a technician tends to gleaming fermentation tanks. The painting’s caption reads: “Intensive research continues to find antibiotics that ­will conquer more of man’s microbial enemies.”5 Thom’s martial confidence in antibiotics’ efficacy was indicative of wider enthusiasm about the alleged defeat of microbial scourges like pneumonia, tuberculosis, gonorrhea, syphilis, and typhoid. With reproductions of Thom’s paintings hanging in their offices and waiting rooms, physicians confidently prescribed a rapidly expanding array of new antibiotics to patients. Despite reports of overprescription, allergic reactions, and the fatal side effects of chloromycetin (chloramphenicol), public and medical trust in the new drugs\n\nPicking One’s Poisons • 19\n\nFIGURE 2.1 ​ The Era of Antibiotics, painted by Robert A. Thom for Parke, Davis & Co.\n\nAPhA Foundation.\n\nremained unshaken.6 Reacting to and further stoking public demand, pharmacists and drug companies advertised both medical antibiotic use and supposedly prescription-­free antibiotic lozenges, nose sprays, mouthwash, toothpaste, and shaving balms in newspapers and magazines like Good House­keeping.7 Bastions of upper-­middle-­class taste like Vogue and Life soon featured adverts for Hi and Dri neomycin deodorants: “Fi­nally . . . ​a deodorant that ­really works ­because it does the job medically!”8 The rapid growth of public and medical demand was welcome news for major antibiotic manufacturers like Lederle Laboratories and Pfizer, the majority of whose profits soon came from antibiotic sales.9 However, the flood of new antibiotics also increased competition. Keen to maximize profits, manufacturers looked for additional antibiotic outlets. The veterinary market seemed particularly promising. Discussed in more detail in chapter 3, sulfonamides and antibiotics like gramicidin had been used against bacterial udder infections in cows (mastitis) and gastro-­enteric poultry infections since the late 1930s. While many of the new biological antibiotics w ­ ere initially deemed too expensive for use on animals, the postwar price decline meant that both pet o­ wners and farmers could increasingly afford antibiotic treatments.10 Nontherapeutic antibiotic applications proved equally popu­lar. Since the 1910s, medicated feeds and metabolism-­enhancing supplements had become increasingly popu­lar on\n\n20 • USA, 1949–1967\n\nUS farms.11 This market increased dramatically during the 1940s. In 1948, the identification of vitamin B12 as the hitherto mysterious animal protein ­factor (APF) and the discovery that antibiotic fermentation wastes ­were B12-­rich strengthened lucrative links between antibiotic producers and the US feed industry.12 This link was further strengthened in 1949 when Lederle researchers Thomas Jukes and Evan Ludvik (E. L.) Robert Stokstad claimed that low— or subtherapeutic—­levels of aureomycin in fermentation wastes caused additional gains when fed to growing animals.13 Announced in April 1950, the so-­called antibiotic growth effect not only opened a large new outlet for the oversupplied antibiotic market but also received glowing coverage in national and regional newspapers across the po­liti­ cal spectrum.14 In 1951, the Washington Post gushed: “Each week 80,000 chicks are produced and moved to [Armour and Co.’s] Ches-­Peake farm . . . . ​ By scientific feeding, controlled temperatures, germ-­killing rays, w ­ ater treated with such drugs as terramycin, aureomycin, and antibiotics [sic], the birds are ready for slaughter in three-­fourths the time by ordinary methods.”15 Meanwhile, Time magazine described how Pfizer was shaking up conservative farmers with the help of “synthetic sow’s milk spiked with terramycin.”16 Thanks to antibiotics, “platoons of l­ ittle pigs w ­ ere enjoying a peril-­free infancy . . . ​none are trampled or eaten; no luckless runts are left teatless.”17 On Pfizer farms, piglet mortality had declined from between 21 and 33 ­percent to 5 ­percent.18 Sows could be “put back to work” immediately instead of “performing no other ser­ vice than can be performed by the milking machine at the nearest dairy.”19 Impressed by rapidly rising sales in 1954, Dow Jones Com­pany–­owned Barron’s National Business and Financial Weekly sagely predicted “a steadily rising market for animal medicines in the foreseeable f­ uture.”20 While American c­ hildren entered home-­made growth promotion experiments on rats at local science fairs,21 penicillin co-­discoverer Alexander Fleming predicted that penicillin’s use as a growth promoter might someday exceed therapeutic uses.22 Trust in the new “miracle drugs” was such that antibiotics’ use as food preservatives and plant sprays was greeted with similar enthusiasm.23 In 1953, the Washington Post rejoiced: “antibiotics are becoming won­der drugs to save food crops . . . ​give us more and tastier meats, even aid in making beer and whisky.”24 Better Homes and Gardens speculated that streptomycin could well “prove to be the long-­heralded ‘injection’ to cure plant diseases.”25 According to the Desert Sun from Palm Springs, antibiotics not only “promise[d] h ­ ouse­wives food that ­will keep for weeks”26 but also “toothsome w ­ haleburgers” and “­whale steaks,” which would make “ ‘mighty fine eating’ if properly preserved and prepared.”27 American Cyanamid and Pfizer began to market antibiotic preservatives from the mid-1950s onward. Described by Maryn McKenna, Cyanamid’s Acronization pro­cess (dipping poultry in chlortetracycline) was celebrated in the national and regional media, was explic­itly advertised on packaging, and\n\nPicking One’s Poisons • 21\n\nwas awarded Good House­keeping’s vaunted Seal of Approval. By 1958, more than half of US slaughter­houses had purchased Acronize licenses. Fish ­wholesalers soon also began using antibiotic preservatives.28 Nowhere was antibiotic enthusiasm greater than among the authors of Scientific American: proclaiming an “antibiotic age”29 in 1952, the magazine noted that the ­wholesale market value of antibiotic and vitamin B12 feed supplements was already worth from $40 million to $50 million. With production costs of antibiotics like penicillin falling from $20 to 4 cents per 100,000 units between 1943 and 1951, it was obvious that agricultural antibiotic use would continue to expand.30 Another article claimed that chemical technologies like antibiotics would advance “agricultural efficiency at least as much as machines have in the past 150 years.”31 By taming capricious nature, a chemical revolution was fi­nally allowing ­humans “to ­free [them]selves from the dismal philosophy of Robert Malthus.”32 Scientific American’s attack on “dismal” Malthusianism supported a central tenet of postwar US politics. According to eighteenth-­century En­glish cleric Robert Malthus, the ­human population’s exponential growth would always exceed the linear growth of agricultural productivity. As a consequence, population growth would eventually be halted e­ ither by preventive checks on fertility or positive checks—­such as rising mortality through famine.33 ­A fter reaching dismal heights during the interwar period, the 1950s saw Malthusian rhe­toric challenged by new agricultural technologies and population control programs. According to the New York Times, the “chemical revolution on the farm” had “all but [wiped] out the Malthusian fear.”34 Significantly, providing plenty was also seen as an effective way to contain communism. With communist parties performing well in Eu­ro­pean elections and making gains in Asia, American planners began to equate prosperity and development with social stability and pro-­US values. In his inaugural 1949 “Four Point Speech,” President Truman promised to “embark on a bold new program for making the benefits of our scientific advances and industrial pro­gress available for the improvement and growth of underdeveloped areas.”35 For patriotic US researchers, politicians, and journalists, promulgating agricultural plenty and efficiency-­ boosting technologies like antibiotics became a moral duty.36 Speaking at the 1953 meeting of the National Farm Chemurgic Council, biochemist H. J. Prebluda claimed that applying antibiotics in farm soil “may do for crops what penicillin and other antibiotics do for animals . . . ​this may solve most of the world’s hunger prob­lems, thus eliminating one of the ­causes of unrest upon which communism has tried to capitalize.”37 In a similar vein, major news­ papers like the New York Times and Washington Post equated rising US meat and antibiotic consumption with American leadership:38 “Nowadays the doctor arrives with a station wagon full of hypos, stimulators, pills and penicillin and Buttercup gets the benefit of modern medicine.”39 According to the\n\n22 • USA, 1949–1967\n\nFIGURE 2.2 Life also celebrated AGPs. Art Shay, “Pigs of Different Diets,” Life, October 1953. ©Art Shay/Art Shay Archive.\n\nSan Bernardino Sun, even Soviet delegates w ­ ere impressed by the extensive use of antibiotic growth promoter feeds (AGPs) on American farms.40 With antibiotic factories and supplies already serving as a popu­lar form of US foreign aid, AGPs ­were also mobilized as Cold War assets for ­human nutrition. Speaking at the 1950 meeting of the American Chemical Society, Wash­ others had ington State College researchers reported that young rats whose m been fed antibiotics grew faster ­because of residues in ­mother’s milk. It might also “be desirable to feed antibiotic concentrates to physically retarded ­children in order to increase their growth rate.”41 Following promising domestic tests on navy recruits, prison inmates, and ­children in ­mental institutions and public schools, antibiotic supplements ­were trialed as foreign aid. During the 1950s, US researchers trialed antibiotic diets for ­children in ­Kenya, Jamaica, Haiti, and Central Amer­i­ca.42 The ­trials received positive regional and national news coverage. In 1951, Nevin Scrimshaw, founding director of the International Institute of Nutrition of Central Amer­i­ca and Panama, enthused that\n\nPicking One’s Poisons • 23\n\nFIGURE 2.3 Cyanamid advertisement, “2,000,000 More of You to Feed,” 1953.

To most observers it seemed as though the constant stream of new antibiotic blockbusters would not only eliminate “man’s microbial enemies” but also break the Malthusian trap and defeat poverty-­fueled communism. That this antibiotic feast came at a price was rarely discussed.\n\nResidues and Allergies As discussed in chapter 1, agricultural antibiotic ­hazards can be roughly divided into residues, AMR se­lection, and the facilitation of welfare abuse. However, not all ­hazards received equal attention. By far the most potent American concerns about agricultural antibiotics centered on residues in food and milk. Residue concerns mirrored and reinforced popu­lar fears about the invisible contamination of food, the environment, and citizens’ bodies. The success of muckraking bestsellers like The Jungle (1906) or 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs (1933) ­ ere already deep-­seated in Americans’ colshows that contamination concerns w lective consciousness. However, postwar research and debates significantly increased public wariness of long-­term exposure to invisible ­hazards.45 Chemical residues in food seemed particularly problematic. In 1949, Republican representative Frank B. Keefe successfully lobbied for a congressional Select Committee to Investigate the Use of Chemicals in Food and Cosmetics. Following Keefe’s death, Demo­cratic representative James J. Delaney took over the committee’s chair.46 In 1951, the select committee’s report attacked the use of inadequately tested synthetic substances and demanded legislation to protect the public from carcinogens and latent poisoning.47 Published during a time of rising concern about cancer rates, the report received widespread media coverage and focused Americans’ attention on potential long-­term h ­ azards of the many new substances being used in ­houses, gardens, and food production (chapter 4).48 Although Delaney’s committee did not address mostly nontoxic and noncarcinogenic agricultural antibiotics, this did not mean that antibiotics’ reputation was safe. During the 1940s, it emerged that some ­people ­were allergic to certain antibiotics. Allergies to β-­lactam antibiotics like penicillin w ­ ere particularly frequent, and allergic reactions could range from mild skin irritations to painful hives or a lethal anaphylactic shock. Between 1953 and early 1957, 1,070 “life-­threatening” allergic reactions to antibiotics and 1,925 “severe reactions” ­were reported to the FDA. The cases included 72 penicillin-­related deaths.49 Meanwhile, studies on nurses revealed that constant antibiotic exposure could lead to hypersensitivity.50 Concerns about exposure to allergenic antibiotics in hospitals ­were, however, slow to spread to the agricultural sphere. In what was to become one of the main features of US antibiotics reporting, commentators frequently treated risks posed by antibiotic use in medical settings as distinct from t­ hose posed by use of or exposure to the same substances in nonmedical settings. This was\n\nPicking One’s Poisons • 25\n\ninitially also true for antibiotic contaminated food and milk.51 During the early 1950s, publications like True Republican from Illinois warned rural readers that “indiscriminate use of drugs [was] dangerous”52 in medicine but did not mention nonmedical forms of antibiotic use on farms. In 1951, New York Times journalist Jane Nickerson regarded antibiotic residues in milk as an “in­ter­est­ing, if not too serious”53 annoyance, which merely complicated cheese production by inhibiting bacteria cultures. Wider attitudes ­towards antibiotic residues only began to change following the 1956 publication of an FDA survey, which found that up to 10 ­percent of US milk might be contaminated with penicillin. Although officials claimed that detected levels ­were insufficient to create new allergies, residues could trigger existing allergies.54 The fact that residues had been found in milk made the FDA survey particularly poignant. Described by Kendra Smith-­Howard, milk held a special place in the minds of US consumers. A symbol of health, milk was associated with feeding the young, infirm, and vulnerable.55 Prior to the Second World War, mea­sures to secure milk purity had centered on the eradication of pathogens like tuberculosis.56 However, a­ fter 1945, definitions of milk safety and purity increasingly encompassed the absence of chemical and radioactive adulterants. This made the FDA’s penicillin residue detections particularly damaging and reduced public commentators’ previous tolerance of US farmers’ direct access to high-­dosed antibiotics.57 In the wake of the 1956 milk scandal, US media reports on food ­hazards and cancer risks increasingly lumped agricultural antibiotics together with other dubious “chemicals” like DDT and chemical dyes. Antibiotic residues also emerged on the prob­lem radar of the surging US consumer movement.58 In 1956, the New York Times reported on the International Union Against Cancer’s symposium in Rome. Speaking at the symposium, William Hueper, head of the US National Cancer Institute’s Environmental Cancer Section, listed ­ azards in food production. The list included dyes, thickeners, synchemical h thetic sweeteners, preservatives, bleaches, fat substitutes, pesticide residues, chemical sterilizers, wrapping materials, estrogens, and antibiotics.59 In the same year, journalist James Rorty and physician N. Philip Norman published the second edition of their popu­lar Tomorrow’s Food. The book’s preface warned about new ­hazards posed by the “tremendous postwar increase in the use of highly toxic pesticides by farmers, the employment of hormone fatteners . . . ​and the adulteration of pro­cessed foods with a multitude of new and inadequately tested chemical additives.”60 Whereas Delaney’s committee had mostly ignored agricultural antibiotics in 1950, the authors now discussed the residue ­hazards of antibiotic feeds and sprays and criticized new residue tolerances for legalizing “the ‘calculated risks’ of mass poisoning.”61 Agricultural antibiotics’ cultural association with carcinogenic chemicals became especially damaging when food safety concerns reached fever pitch\n\n26 • USA, 1949–1967\n\naround 1960. In 1959, the so-­called Delaney Clause of the 1958 Food Additives Amendment (chapter 4) forced the FDA to take action against millions of pounds of cranberries produced with the herbicide and suspected carcinogen aminotriazole ahead of Thanksgiving, the most impor­tant date in cranberry growers’ year.62 Hitting the US cranberry industry hard, the scandal heightened popu­lar fears that farmers ­were abusing dangerous chemicals—­including antibiotics. Concerns ­were reinforced by the FDA’s nearly simultaneous disclosure that 3 ­percent of analyzed US milk samples contained “substantial residues”63 of pesticides and that 3.7 ­percent contained penicillin residues.64 With residue fears damaging the US cranberry and dairy industries, wary consumers also started abandoning new antibiotic preservatives amidst complaints about the dubious quality of preserved produce. In reaction, some companies began to advertise “non-­acronized” chickens.65 A series of bestselling exposés fanned the flames of public distrust of agricultural antibiotic use. In 1960, journalist and ­f uture Pulitzer Prize winner William Longgood published The Poisons in Your Food. Longgood’s introduction invited consumers to inspect their shopping baskets: “Then ­there’s the milk you give the c­ hildren . . . . ​But did you know the odds are . . . ​one to ten it contains antibiotics? . . . ​Sunday’s chicken may have traces of antibiotics, arsenic and artificial sex hormones . . . . ​The roasts or steaks prob­ably have traces of hormones, antibiotics and the inevitable poisons that went into the ­cattle’s diet.”66 Similar to Tomorrow’s Food, Longgood accused congressionally mandated residue tolerances of legalizing “mass poisoning . . . ​by granting FDA the right to determine how much poison residue may remain on marketed food.”67 For ­ ere no longer miracle substances but sinLonggood, agricultural antibiotics w ister contaminants. Contrary to official assurances, cooking did not destroy antibiotic preservatives, and the 1956 milk scandal had shown “how precarious the public’s margin of safety is when a dangerous drug is placed in the hands of laymen . . . ​who are expected to exercise their sense of responsibility at the risk of losing money.”68 Linking them to rising allergic reactions, Longgood also claimed that antibiotic residues acted as “vitamin antagonists” and masked disease in slaughtered animals.69 Longgood’s book provoked angry reactions. In Science, William J. Darby, an influential nutritionist from Vanderbilt University, attacked The Poisons in Your Food as “an all-­time high in ‘bloodthirsty pen-­pushing’ ” from the “bias of the non-­scientific, natu­ral food-­organic cult.”70 Longgood’s “authorities” ­were “the cult leaders . . . ​or a few true scientists whose work or expressions have been taken e­ ither out of context or out of time.”71 Dispensing with a bibliography, some of Longgood’s claims ­were indeed sketchy. However, the fact that his book managed to elicit a review in Science showed that the days of ­wholesale chemical optimism w ­ ere over. In popu­lar culture, the promised chemical cornucopia of the 1950s was acquiring the b­ itter aftertaste of invisible residues.\n\nPicking One’s Poisons • 27\n\nLonggood was not the only one to fan concerns about chemicals and antibiotics in food and the environment. Authors associated with the US organic movement ­were equally active. Based in Pennsylvania, publicist Jerome Irving (J. I.) Rodale was a long-­standing critic of conventional agriculture (chapter 3). For much of the 1950s, Rodale’s advocacy of organic food production, healthy nutrition, and self-­improvement had, however, only attracted a fringe readership.72 This changed during the 1960s. Between 1961 and the end of the de­cade, readership of Organic Gardening and Farming nearly doubled from 270,000 to over 500,000 while readership of the consumer-­oriented Prevention reached about 725,000.73 During this time, antibiotics played an increasingly prominent role in Rodale’s criticism of conventional nonorganic agriculture. In 1961, Rodale’s The Complete Book of Food and Nutrition summarized several years of Prevention’s dietary advice. The book echoed Longgood by warning about antibiotic-­contaminated milk but also referred to agricultural AMR se­lection, spreading allergies, the dangers of antibiotic food preservation, and alleged links between penicillin residues and blood clots. According to Rodale’s increasingly influential publishing empire, healthy animal produce only came from “antibiotic f­ ree” organic farms.74 A further reputational blow for agricultural chemicals’ image fell in 1962 when ­Silent Spring, the iconic bestseller by marine biologist Rachel Carson, launched a frontal attack on chemical polluters and on DDT in par­tic­u­lar. Similar to antibiotics, the insecticide DDT was initially regarded as a success story of war­time science and postwar commercialization.75 DDT’s similarity to anti­ ere: it quickly became clear that DDT use could select for biotics did not end h re­sis­tance in insect populations and result in residues, which accumulated in animal tissues. DDT concentrations ­were especially high t­ oward the top of the food chain. In the case of Amer­i­ca’s heraldic animal, the bald ea­g le, DDT resulted in thinner eggshells, which ­were unable to support the weight of brooding parents. Significantly, Carson also accused DDT and other chemicals of causing cancer. Of ­Silent Spring’s seventeen chapters, five ­were devoted to pesticides’ and herbicides’ carcinogenicity.76 Profiting from ­earlier bestsellers like The Poisons in Your Food and anarchist Murray Bookchin’s contemporaneous Our Synthetic Environment,77 ­Silent Spring’s fusion of environmental and health concerns led to heated American debates about regulation of private, official, and agricultural chemical use.78 In December 1962, the Washington Post claimed that ­Silent Spring had turned chemical use into “the most controversial non-­political subject in American agriculture.”79 Resulting debates about DDT and per­sis­tent pesticides also affected the cultural framing of chemically unrelated substances. Although Carson did not discuss them in her book, American public debates about agricultural antibiotics would for a long time be framed according to the residue-­focused language of ­Silent Spring. Growing consumer concerns about invisible chemical and antibiotic residues in US food ­were paralleled by a series of phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal corruption scandals\n\n28 • USA, 1949–1967\n\nand safety scares, which resulted in a loss of public confidence in the integrity of American drug manufacturers and their regulators. The 1950s had been a golden era for the US phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal sector. Venerated as “merchants of life,”80 companies’ value had more than qua­dru­pled to $2,200,000,000 between 1945 and 1958.81 However, companies’ be­hav­ior had on occasion also been questionable. Between 1959 and 1962, investigations by the Senate’s Antitrust and Mono­poly Subcommittee shed a harsh light on dubious mark-up prices, marketing practices, and attempts to drive generic drug producers out of business. The most damaging findings came to light in May 1960, when Demo­cratic senator Carey Estes Kefauver’s subcommittee announced that it was investigating extra income received by the head of the FDA’s Antibiotics Division, Henry Welch. Between 1953 and 1960, Welch had received $287,142 for his role as editor-­in-­chief of the journals Antibiotics and Chemotherapy and Antibiotic Medicine and Clinical Therapy. Financed by industry, the widely distributed journals contained articles designed to advertise antibiotic products—­ sometimes prior to their licensing by Welch’s division.82 Industry representatives had even edited some of Welch’s official speeches—in one case, a Pfizer slogan had been written into a speech to “jazz it up.”83 A defiant Welch was forced to resign from the FDA in mid-­May 1960.84 Although Secretary of Health Arthur Flemming ordered a review of all of Welch’s licensing decisions,85 the 1961 thalidomide scandal added to public concerns about FDA and industry standards. In 1957, the West German com­pany Chemie Grünenthal had launched a new substance called thalidomide as a sedative and soporific suitable for pregnant w ­ omen. Despite evidence linking thalidomide to neural damage and fetal malformation, Grünenthal continued to market thalidomide ­until November 1961. By then, fetal exposure to the teratogen was believed to have caused an estimated 10,000 malformations and several hundred deaths.86 Fortunately, thalidomide had not been licensed for US markets. Despite repeated requests, FDA reviewer Frances Oldham Kelsey had deemed industry data insufficient. Kelsey’s heroic story, however, also highlighted how lucky Americans had been. With no requirements for manufacturers to submit clinical ­trials or report adverse effects, Kelsey’s doubts had been the only ­thing standing between thalidomide and the US market.87 Reacting to the thalidomide scandal and Kefauver hearings in 1962, President Kennedy awarded Kelsey the President’s Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Ser­ vice88 and signed the so-­called Kefauver-­Harris Amendment. The 1962 amendment mandated prelicensing efficacy tests of new drugs via controlled clinical ­trials and required manufacturers to report adverse effects from 1963 onward.89 However, the reputational damage had been done. Not only had con­ temporary food, chemical, and phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal scandals revealed gaps in consumer protection, they had also tainted post-­war narratives of agricultural and chemical pro­g ress. During the 1960s, this reputational shift led to a\n\nPicking One’s Poisons • 29\n\ncurious divide in US reporting on agricultural antibiotics. On the one hand, fears of global overpopulation and communism continued to engender cross-­ party and cross-­regional support for antibiotic-­f ueled plenty. On the other hand, programs of defending democracy with agricultural chemicals now had to be justified against a growing list of environmental and health warnings. Even optimistic reports on chemicals’ ability to tame nature now demanded that farmers contain “synthetic” substances so as not to adulterate “natu­ral” food and bodies. In 1963, Scientific American claimed that underdeveloped countries still depended on Western food imports produced with the help of “finely calculated diets and rations, synthetic hormones, . . . ​drugs and vaccines to control disease.”90 However, the magazine was now also forced to assuage consumer concerns by using the classic argument that harmless substances did not exist: “­there are only harmless ways of using them.”91 A defensive line of reasoning also began to characterize industry rhe­toric. In 1961, the US Manufacturing Chemists’ Association published a booklet entitled Food Additives: What They Are, How They Are Used. The booklet was designed to help physicians and nutritionists inform consumers about the benefits of the ongoing “food revolution” and the role of chemical additives as “an impor­tant ‘tool’ of food science.”92 However, this revolution was in danger. Although Americans ­were “better fed and in better health than at any time in history,” “unpre­ce­dented population growth”93 threatened food security. Further chemical use was key if Americans wanted to preserve a “plentiful, varied, nutritious, safe, eco­nom­ical and good-­tasting”94 food supply. Attacking irrational faddists and organic gardeners and employing Cold War rhe­toric,95 the booklet praised “natu­ral” antibiotic preservatives without which it would be impossible to feed the crews of “our atomic submarines” which “can cruise for months in a hostile environment without surfacing even once.”96 It is hard to judge just how seriously the average US consumer took industry advice or residue warnings. On the one hand, a keyword analy­sis of popu­ lar cookery books does not reveal a marked rise of chemical concerns.97 Specialist publications like the Princi­ples of Nutrition (1959) included positive discussions of antibiotic growth promotion, and 1960s regional reporters continued to exhort readers to “give thanks to science for all that lush meat” produced by “pampered”98 animals. On the other hand, the flood of new US publications ­either attacking or defending agricultural chemicals is indicative of a wider shift in public discourse, which also affected antibiotics. Once enjoying near universal support, agricultural antibiotics’ had become culturally tarnished via association with other suspicious chemicals. This association had significant implications for the public staging of antibiotic risk. With both the media and whistle-­blowing bestsellers focusing on antibiotic residues in food and milk, other aspects of antibiotic risk like agricultural AMR se­lection ­were consistently overshadowed.\n\n30 • USA, 1949–1967\n\nRe­sis­tance Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, t­ here was a surprising dearth of American public debates about AMR se­lection on farms. This was not ­because of lacking knowledge. Although many AMR mechanisms ­were still unknown, experts ­were well aware of the general phenomenon. During the 1930s, physicians had already noted that certain bacteria developed re­sis­tance against sulfonamides.99 In 1940—­one year ahead of penicillin’s first clinical trial—­Oxford researchers described penicillin-­resistant staphylococci.100 Echoing e­ arlier warnings by gramicidin discoverer René Dubos,101 penicillin discoverer Alexander Fleming used his 1945 Nobel Prize lecture to warn about antibiotic overuse and AMR.102 However, prior to the discovery of bacteria’s ability to exchange genes conferring AMR (R-­factors) via horizontal gene transfer (chapter 1), most experts remained confident that AMR could be contained by avoiding “irrational” antibiotic use, employing drug combinations, and improving infection control. If all of t­ hese mea­sures failed, the development of new antibiotics would eventually solve prob­lems.103 During the 1950s, American experts and media outlets thus responded to rising AMR with campaigns for “rational” antibiotic use. Although most commentators saw “no reason to think antibiotics are on the way out,”104 papers like the Madera Daily News and San Bernardino Sun warned that one could “develop a sort of tolerance”105 to penicillin and that “Your Neighbors’ Won­ der Drugs Can Make You Sick; Careless Use Builds Up Resistant Germs.”106 Mid-1950s hospital outbreaks involving resistant pathogens like Staphylococcus 80/81 added urgency to “rational” antibiotic use campaigns.107 In 1958, Surgeon General Leroy Burney categorized antibiotic resistant staphylococci as a “prob­ lem of national significance.”108 Described by historian Scott Podolsky, US infectious disease experts like Maxwell Finland from Boston City Hospital used the opportunity to attack sales of popu­lar but inefficacious fixed dose combinations of multiple antibiotics as well as American physicians’ accommodativeness to phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal marketing.109 In 1959, Finland warned: “physicians who are overconfident of germ-­killing won­der drugs are living in a fool’s paradise where their patients may die.”110 While American medical prac­ti­tion­ers ultimately escaped calls for greater statutory oversight, AMR concerns ­were one of the reasons ­behind the US government’s decision to move against inefficacious products with the 1962 Kefauver-­Harris Amendment (chapter 4).111 Curiously, widespread concern about AMR se­lection in medical settings did not translate into alarm about similar pro­cesses on the farm or in the environment. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, most American commentators treated AMR in the hospital as distinct from AMR on the farm. With the exception of a 1952 reader’s letter to the Washington Post,112 none of the analyzed US media sources addressed the fact that resistant organisms could emerge in animals and\n\nPicking One’s Poisons • 31\n\nspread to h ­ umans or spread from ­humans to animals.113 The closest an article came to addressing agricultural AMR se­lection was in the Madera Daily Tribune in 1962. Titled “Mass Murders Have Changed Bacteria,”114 the article cited research by bacteriologist George Eastman according to which large-­scale antibiotic use had allowed resistant salmonella to “overgrow”115 sensitive species but failed to mention instances of antibiotic use beyond h ­ uman medicine. The epistemic divide between ­human and nonhuman antibiotic use and microbiota also characterized whistle-­blowing bestsellers. Although William Longgood and Lewis Herber warned about AMR se­lection in ­humans as a result of residues in food and milk, they did not connect their residue-­oriented criticism of agricultural antibiotics with AMR se­lection in the environment or with con­ temporary campaigns for “rational” antibiotic use.116 It was only in 1966 that the curious epistemic divide of reporting on medical and agricultural AMR began to be challenged. Following reports by Scientific American,117 the prestigious New ­England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) warned about the dangers of horizontal AMR proliferation on August 4, 1966. Instead of merely passing on re­sis­tance to subsequent generations, bacteria could exchange AMR blueprints—­R ­factors—­horizontally across species borders (chapter 1). Horizontal gene transfer meant that locally emerging re­sis­tance could spread rapidly throughout the regional and global environment. Ecological proliferation scenarios also implied that AMR se­lection on farms could be just as dangerous as AMR se­lection in hospitals. Referring to R-­factor transfer as “infectious drug re­sis­tance,” NEJM’s editorial blamed the “precipitous rise in frequency of R ­factors” on the “increasing use of antibiotics not only in clinical practice but also in the care and feeding of livestock.”118 Relying strongly on British research (chapter 5) and invoking what would become a standard apocalyptic genre of AMR warnings, NEJM specifically accused low-­dosed antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs) of “providing a constant se­lection pressure on R ­factors that can readily be transferred to man”—­“­unless drastic mea­sures are taken very soon, physicians may find themselves back in the preantibiotic ­Middle Ages.”119 Early American media reactions to the NEJM editorial ­were surprisingly muted. Eight days ­after the editorial was published, the New York Times intuitively compared the potential implications of horizontal AMR warnings to the impact of Carson’s ­Silent Spring: “the available evidence suggests that the development of such hardy microbes is greatly facilitated by the widespread feeding of antibiotics . . . . ​Put bluntly, ­people may be paying for cheaper and better meat by suffering more and graver infectious diseases.”120 However, this harsh attack on antibiotic feeds remained exceptional. Most other US newspapers initially greeted NEJM’s warnings with silence. The silence was in part due to the pending release of an FDA report on veterinary medical and nonmedical uses of antibiotics. Published three weeks ­after the NEJM editorial, the report acknowledged that antibiotics w ­ ere being misused but l­imited AMR warnings to the\n\n32 • USA, 1949–1967\n\npresence of residues in food. Calling for an end to antibiotic food preservation, stricter punishment of residue offenders, and more research on antibiotics’ ecological effects, the FDA report effectively refocused public attention on residue rather than AMR ­hazards (chapter 4).121 Most media outlets followed the FDA by ­either downplaying or linking concerns about agricultural AMR se­lection to already familiar residue-­focused risk scenarios. Time magazine described the “contagious cuddling” between bacteria but relativized NEJM’s warnings of pre-­antibiotic ­Middle Ages: some experts ­were “calmly argu[ing] that laboratories are producing new antibiotics too fast for germs to catch up.”122 Drawing an analogy to Upton Sinclair’s bestseller, the Washington Post criticized the FDA for having allowed an “antibiotic jungle”123 to spread with regards to food preservation but failed to focus on AMR. Further articles in the New York Times also rehashed analogies between antibiotics, ­Silent Spring, and residue scandals.124 Equating the absence of residues with a reduction of AMR, a reader of the Washington Post encouraged farmers to capitalize on consumer insecurities: “­There are quite a few of us who go out of our way to buy such pure foods . . . ​—at a price.”125 The 1960s w ­ ere thus a confusing time for the American public: their sense of risk heightened by the Kefauver hearings, ­Silent Spring, and residue scandals, US citizens remained exposed to an unattenuated stream of optimistic reports about agricultural plenty and the necessity of curbing threats like overpopulation-­induced hunger and communism. Newspaper subscribers could read about chemical dangers in one issue only to encounter praise for “pushbutton farming”126 and “coddled swine” getting “plenty of food, shots, pills [and] antibiotics”127 in the next. In terms of agricultural antibiotics, pervasive fears of invisible poisoning made consumer activists and the media prioritize risk scenarios focusing on residues and contaminated food. Although reports on allergic reactions gradually linked debates about penicillin exposure in medical and agricultural settings, more abstract fears of AMR remained focused on medicine. This epistemic fragmentation between AMR se­lection in ­human and nonhuman settings would have a lasting influence on the US antibiotic risk episteme. Commentators only gradually connected the two spheres of agricultural and medical AMR se­lection following NEJM’s popularization of British research on horizontal re­sis­tance proliferation. However, as reactions to the 1966 FDA report show, the dominance of residue-­focused risk scenarios subordinated concerns about agricultural AMR se­lection to fears of invisible antibiotic residues. As a consequence, public opposition to agricultural antibiotic use remained fragmented and un­co­or­di­nated. Frustrated by US consumers’ seeming complacency about food-­related dangers in 1964, Washington Post journalist Sue Cronk noted: “the biggest worry the American ­house­wife has when she shops for meat is likely to be how much it ­will cost—­not ­whether it ­will be safe for her ­family to eat.”128\n\n3\n\nChemical Cornucopia Antibiotics on the Farm This chapter reconstructs antibiotics’ adoption and ensuing conflicts in the US agricultural sphere. ­A fter 1945, antibiotics w ­ ere rapidly integrated into all areas of US food production. This rapid introduction was facilitated by growing pressure to expand and intensify agricultural production and by a sophisticated sales network connecting phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal producers with farms. By the early 1960s, antibiotics had acquired infrastructural importance in many production sectors. Although US farmers shared public antibiotic optimism, they soon expressed concern about the negative effects of chemical-­driven intensification on smaller producers. However, all-­out rejection of agricultural chemicals remained ­limited to organic farmers. While conventional farmers attempted to curb antibiotic residues in sensitive products like milk, growing public concerns about chemicals instead provoked angry outbursts against “irrational” faddists. Similar to the US public sphere, AMR ­hazards ­were rarely discussed. Despite warnings by veterinary bacteriologists, most agricultural commentators did not discuss potential public health implications of AMR se­lection on farms.\n\nThe Origins of Agricultural Antibiotic Use US agriculture’s rapid adoption of antibiotics was no coincidence. Beginning in the interwar period, the Taylorian logic of Henry Ford’s factories gradually spread throughout the countryside. A new generation of agricultural experts, 33\n\n34 • USA, 1949–1967\n\nofficials, and producers wanted to apply the princi­ples of quantification and mechanization to US farms. Already farming larger acreages and producing more animals than Eu­ro­pe­ans, US farmers further expanded and also began to rationalize production. Interwar farms employed accounting techniques alongside new technologies like tractors, hybrid seeds, and pesticides.1 Farmers also invested in more intensive ways of producing livestock. Conceptualizing animals as machine-­like feed converters, farmers began to purchase premixed fortified rations from specialist producers like the Commercial Solvents Corporation or Pfizer. While farmers’ motivation was to produce more meat with less feed, manufacturers saw farms as lucrative outlets for industrial surplus and by-­products. Connecting farmers with phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal manufacturers was an increasingly sophisticated network of veterinarians, local feed-­mixers, and government extension officials.2 Rising output soon exceeded demand. Attempting to maintain incomes despite sinking commodity prices, US farmers increased their production by 13 ­percent between 1917 and 1929. Unsurprisingly, prices continued to sink. By the end of the 1920s, it cost more to produce many commodities than farmers earned from selling them. Unable to ser­vice their debts, many farmers suffered bankruptcy, and the US farm population declined from 32.5 million in prewar years to 30 million in 1930. Only very efficient or large farming operations remained profitable due to lower production costs. When commodity prices declined by another 37 ­percent during the ­Great Depression, even the most efficient producers strug­gled to survive.3 Reacting to farmers’ plight, the Roo­se­velt administration launched a comprehensive program of agricultural aid. Passed in May 1933, the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) was designed to reduce surpluses, stabilize prices, and enhance farmers’ purchasing power. The AAA allowed the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to administer adjustment payments to farmers, who in turn agreed to reduce production of surplus commodities. Together with compensated slaughter programs and other initiatives, the AAA was supposed to restore the relative purchasing power—parity—of agricultural goods to prewar levels. However, in attempting to alleviate the ­Great Depression’s impact, New Deal mea­sures increased agricultural intensification pressure and subsidy dependence: by 1941, one-­third of US gross farm income was derived from direct or indirect federal payments.4 Paying producers to slaughter animals and take land out of production also incentivized them to produce more with remaining assets—­thereby putting larger farmers at an advantage. As a consequence, the farms that survived the ­Great Depression ­were culturally and eco­nom­ically geared to strive for factory-­like efficiency, scale, and technological sophistication.5 When commodity prices recovered, production boomed. Reacting to Amer­i­ca’s entry into the Second World War, Congress passed the 1942 Emergency\n\nChemical Cornucopia • 35\n\nPrice Control Act and the Steagall Amendment. Legislators guaranteed commodity prices at around full parity for the duration of hostilities and for two years afterward to incentivize farmers to maximize production and invest in productivity increases. Ensuing transformations w ­ ere particularly dramatic in the livestock sector: whereas New Dealers had ordered the compensated slaughter of about 6 million hogs in 1934, the new price guarantees encouraged farm investment and a significant rise in production.6 Parallel war-­induced grain, protein, and ­labor shortages, however, soon threatened rising outputs. US researchers ­were hastily commissioned to find solutions. Described by historian Mark Finlay, one of ­these researchers was Damon Catron. At Purdue University’s Work Simplification Laboratory, Catron launched a systematic attempt to overcome shortages in the pig sector ­ ere fattened on pastures with efficiency increases. Farrowed in spring, animals w during summer and autumn, and mass slaughtered ahead of winter. The resulting pork glut often overwhelmed pro­cessing facilities and depressed prices. By contrast, Catron’s vision for production resembled an integrated car assembly plant that divided a pig’s life into distinct stages: breeding, farrowing, weaning, rebreeding, and finishing. Removed from pastures, animals ­were to be “assembled” all-­year-­round in optimized indoor environments and fed tailored rations prior to their final disassembly in an abattoir.7 This Fordist vision of animal production faced significant challenges. While intensification was already underway in poultry farming, the overwhelming majority of US pigs ­were still held in outdoor or mixed indoor-­outdoor systems. Most US c­ attle w ­ ere kept on pastures.8 Convincing t­ hese producers to abandon their low-­cost systems and invest in confined intensive production proved challenging. Disease posed another obstacle. On both sides of the Atlantic, previous attempts to increase animal densities in more confined systems had been stunted by a corresponding growth of disease pressure: infections had wiped out herds or diminished productivity.9 It was ­here that the advent of antibio­ tics had a significant impact. During the late 1930s, producers had already used organoarsenics, inorganic sulfur compounds, sulfonamides, and biological antibiotics like gramicidin to treat individual animals (e.g., mastitis in cows) or larger groups of animals. However, drug prices ­were high, and incorrect dosages could poison animals. This situation began to change during the 1940s. The American poultry industry was a leader of this change. In 1939, Cornell veterinarian P. Philip Levine reported that the only recently marketed sulfanilamide had shown efficacy against coccidiosis—­a protozoal infection of the intestine. Researchers soon reported the successful use of other sulfonamides like sulfamethazine, sulfadiazine, and sulfaguanidine to both treat and prevent coccidiosis in poultry and foulbrood in bees. Developed with the support of phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal companies, safe sulfonamide ratios in ­water and feed soon enabled the mass medi­cation of\n\n36 • USA, 1949–1967\n\nentire flocks and ­were also used against other diseases like fowl typhoid (Salmonella gallinarum) and Pullorum disease (Salmonella pullorum).10 What had once been devastating herd and flock diseases seemed increasingly controllable. With the end of the war easing military demand, veterinary antibiotic treatments became cheaper and more widely available. Described by Susan Jones, ads for Lederle’s sulfathiazole began to appear in poultry magazines by 1946. In the same year, Merck patented sulfaquinoxaline. Originally developed as an antimalarial but licensed against coccidiosis in 1948, sulfaquinoxaline became the first antibiotic product officially approved for inclusion in animal feeds and proved extremely lucrative. Poultry farmers could now medicate entire flocks with only minimal (and often without) veterinary supervision.11 While sulfonamides paved the way for routine therapeutic antibiotic use, it was the nonspecific application of antibiotics that would transform agro-­ pharmaceutical relations. ­There was already a lucrative market for animal feed supplements in the United States (chapter 2).12 However, researchers continued to puzzle over why certain feeds supported animal growth and o­ thers did not. The animal protein f­ actor (APF—­also known as anti–­pernicious anemia ­factor) was at the center of this puzzle. Nutritionists had long known that feeds enriched with fishmeal, cow and chicken manure, or fermentation wastes ­were more effective at promoting growth than feeds containing cheap vegetable protein alone. Meanwhile, expensive liver extracts and cod oil had been found to be both effective against pernicious anemia in ­humans and to promote animal growth.13 With animal protein imports from Japan and Norway interrupted during the Second World War, researchers redoubled efforts to isolate and find alternative APF sources.14 The APF hunt led to unexpected results: in 1946, a University of Wisconsin team including Peter Moore and the colorful Thomas Donnell (­later Sir Samurai) Luckey reported that a combination of sulfasuxidine and streptomycin increased the growth of chicks when fed alongside folic acid.15 The Wisconsin researchers had been studying the role of B-­vitamins for animal growth by using antibiotics to “knock out” parts of the digestive system. They had expected streptomycin to sterilize the gut and create a growth-­retarding vitamin deficiency. To their surprise, the opposite had happened. However, the Wisconsin team and other academic groups researching the feeding of waste products like mycellium from penicillin production failed to realize the practical and commercial implications of their observations.16 This changed three years ­later. In 1948, research by the University of Mary­ land and Merck as well as by Glaxo in the United Kingdom led to the isolation of vitamin B12 and its identification as the mysterious APF. In a lucrative spinoff, Merck not only discovered that Streptomyces griseus (the organism producing streptomycin) produced B12 but that industrial fermentation wastes accruing ­after streptomycin extraction still contained large amounts of the\n\nChemical Cornucopia • 37\n\nvitamin. Far cheaper than other animal protein sources, fermentation wastes of biological antibiotics could be fed directly to animals as APF growth promoters. ­There was a particularly large market for B12/APF supplements in the Midwest where animal husbandry and the product"
