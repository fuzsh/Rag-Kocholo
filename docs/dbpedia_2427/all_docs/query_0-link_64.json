The newly-formed 53rd Battalion was composed of members from the 1st Battalion- a New South Wales Battalion. Joining the 14th Brigade in the 5th Division, the Battalion Commander was to be Lieutenant-Colonel Ignatius Norris, a former Militia Officer. At the time of formation, the Battalion was retained in the old 1st Battalion lines at Tel-El-Kebir.\n\nIn March 1916, ‘D’ Company got its first official Company Commander; Charles Arblaster. Hailing from Melbourne, Charles had entered the Royal Military College at Duntroon in 1912, graduating shortly after war was declared in October 1914. He then enlisted in Broadmeadows in November 1914 joining the 8th Light Horse Regiment as a Subaltern. He had been a temporary Captain prior to a wounding on Gallipoli and after recuperating was unable to return to the 8th Light Horse Regiment. The fact that his Temporary-Captaincy had elapsed also made him feel neglected. Then came opportunity- the 53rd Battalion. Arblaster was accepted into the 53rd Battalion and appointed Captain, OC ‘D’ Company. Other officers who were to join the Battalion were, amongst dozens, a British Army Major Oswald Croshaw (April 12th). He was to act as Battalion Second-in-Command. The Battalion was trained in Egypt until they were transported to France, arriving there on June 27th, 1916. Captain Arblaster’s diary notes that throughout the first-half of July they inspected the ‘very simple breastwork trenches’. He was obviously not too impressed in the trenches, however they were to use this trenches in an upcoming attack near a place called Fromelles\n\nCaptain Arblaster, whilst still a Light Horse Officer. Dated 1915\n\nOn the eve of Fromelles, the Company was still under the command of Captain Arblaster. These were the officers in the company.\n\n13 Platoon OC - Lt Albert Bowman 14 Platoon OC - 2Lt Charles Mudge 15 Platoon OC - Lt William Noble 16 Platoon OC - 2Lt Beresford Nelson\n\nAt 11am on July 19th, the Battalion was under heavy enemy shelling, likewise the Germans across No Mans land. After a wait of over 6 hours, the step-off time lurched closer. At 5:43pm, a mix comprising of half of 'A' Company and half of 'B' Company went over the top in the first wave. This was closely followed by the second halves of 'A' and 'B' Company. Third and fourth waves were also half 'C' and half 'D' Company. The battalion took the first enemy lines but faced fierce counter attacks. In the initial attack, Second Lieutenant 'Bere' Nelson was struck down by a machine gun burst some 20 yards short of the German first line and mortally wounded (Nelson was subsequently 'left behind' the following day). Second Lieutenant Charlie Mudge was blown up by a bomb around the time the Battalion took the first lines, shrapnel punctured his lungs. Private Gowndrie of his platoon said later ‘he (Mudge) said “Gowndrie, I’m done”. I asked him if I could do anything for him but he said “no”’. Lieutenant William Noble had also made it into the first line of trenches where he was badly wounded ‘covered in blood and dirt and never a move out of him’. Within the half hour of the fighting, Lieutenant Noble and Second Lieutenants Mudge and Nelson were dead and Lieutenant Bowman rendered unconscious by a shell; Lieutenant Colonel Norris, his Adjutant and the most senior Company Commander (Major Sampson) were also dead. Captain Arblaster apparently took command of the Battalion following the destruction of the Battalion chain of command, and over the night of July 19th/20th proved himself to be a ‘cool and brave leader’. In a counter attack, the good Captain evenly distributed bombs to the men along the line and personally led a charge into the open. During the night, Lieutenant Bowman awoke from his unconscious state and joined elements of the 55th Battalion. Captain Arblaster was on the left flank with the Battalion, fighting off small bombing parties. His right flank was being pressured which consequently blocked off any supplies he could've received. Arblaster led a charge to hold the right flank, though in vain. Arblaster fell severely wounded in that charge.\n\nBy 4am, the 53rd Battalion was starting to give way; they were exhausted and struggling to keep ground. A wounded Captain Arblaster gave the order to charge back to the Australian lines. At 4:20am, Colonel Cass (In command of the operation) wrote to the Brigadier 'The 53rd have lost confidence temporarily and will not willingly stand their ground'.\n\nOn the early morning of July 20th, the Germans shelled the lines once more- this consequently led to more casualties. By dawn, the Germans had a machine gun enfilading the recently-captured trenches. Lieutenant Bowman and his motely crew of the 55th Battalion were somewhat disorganized with no clear orders. Bowman sent Private Bolder to find Colonel Cass to get clear, definitive orders on what to do. Private Bolder nor Lieutenant Bowman never found Colonel Cass.\n\nAt 7am, the Germans managed to capture a trench on the right flank along with all the occupants. When Bowman found out about this, he went investigating once more going up and down nearby trenches for superiors. When asked the situation, he said 'We're in a hell of a mess and I don't know how we are going to get out of it!'. This confused situation was shared all along the front. At 8am, Bowman's position was surrounded. He ordered the men to burn whatever important items they may have that might be of use to the Germans. Shortly after 8am, he surrendered.\n\nAs stated prior, Captain Arblaster was left behind. He was captured by the Germans and subsequently sent to hospital. He died of septicaemia in Douai due to his wounds a few days later. Major Hughes (32nd Battalion) shortly after the war wrote to the parents of Captain Arblaster and commented on his death.\n\n“The poor fellow (Arblaster) was very badly wounded. What happened before he arrived at the Hospital I cannot say, but in Hospital he was well treated and all possible was done for him. The first day, he was conscious, though suffering great pain. His wounds were dressed then, but nothing further was done. The next day his arms (both were broken) were set, under an anaesthetic. He appeared somewhat easier that night. Next morning he was again given attention, but the Surgeon told me that his case was very serious. Towards mid day he appeared to lose consciousness, and died in the early afternoon.”\n\nWhen the 53rd Battalion exited the line following Fromelles on July 20th, the strength of the Battalion stood at an eye watering 4 Officers and 222 men. All of 'D' Company's platoon commanders were put out of action indefinitely- either killed or captured.\n\nFrance. 11 November 1918. View of the concrete blockhouses in the German third line on the Fromelles-Aubers Ridge. It was towards these positions that the 14th Australian Infantry Brigade attacked in the battle of Fromelles on 19 July 1916.\n\nDue to the manpower shortage, the 4 Companies were merged into 2 composite companies; that is, ‘A’ and ‘B’ Company under Captain Thomson, ‘C’ and ‘D’ Company under Captain Murray. The Battalion didn’t see much action for the following months; however by September 1916 they were climbing back up to an adequate strength. By this time, Major Croshaw was now a Lieutenant Colonel commanding the Battalion. Croshaw was a British Army regular, attached to the Australian Imperial Force. He had seen service on the veldt with the Hussars and as a Brigade Major on Gallipoli. He was Second in Command of the 53rd Battalion at Fromelles, however was detached for Brigade duties and therefore saved from death.\n\nEnter Captain Robert ‘Bob’ Ramsay MC (pictured on civi street towards right); He had served on Gallipoli where he was commissioned in the field and won the Military Cross for actions at Lone Pine. He had been originally assigned to the 53rd Battalion, however was reassigned as Brigade Bombing Officer. Due to an accident in Egypt he was hospitalized, then he was invalided to England before he was passed as fighting fit. Reassigned to the 53rd Battalion, he joined the Battalion at Fleurbaix on September 4th. A week later at Lamotte, the Battalion went back to its traditional format with ‘D’ Company now under the command of Captain Ramsay. Ramsay was described by his Battalion Commander Lieutenant-Colonel Croshaw as ‘(the) devil, but if hell were peopled with devils of his ilk, I should ask for bi-annual leave there from the other place.’ The Battalion Chaplain, a fairly popular man by the name of Kennedy (who later authored the Whale Oil Guards which can be classed as the Battalion's history) wrote of him ‘Among the officers there was Captain Bob Ramsay. Bob, while yet a Lieutenant, had been awarded the Military Cross for bravery in Gallipoli. In the line, there was no more capable Company Commander. He was a father to every man in his company. He understood Australians thoroughly, and though he maintained strict discipline, was perhaps the most popular officer in the battalion. In the trenches he never touched alcohol. His care for the men's safety and comfort won him the regard and admiration of the Colonel. In No Man's Land he was as happy as if he were stalking kangaroos in the bush of Queensland, and was as unconcerned under a machine-gun barrage as if it were only a summer's shower-burst. In the line no officer was truer to his trust. Out of the line no officer was more irresponsible. His escapades were nightly occurrences. Many of them were laughable in the extreme. On one occasion he persuaded the driver of a motor waggon to give him a ride to Amiens. Bob's first care on arrival was to fill the unsuspecting Tommy with strong liquor and so put him out of action for at least twenty-four hours. Ramsay was perhaps the most talented officer in the old regiment. He was certainly the most interesting problem in contradictions I've tried to sole. Had Bob Ramsay, when younger, adopted soldering[sic] as a profession, had he in addition been possessed of the advantages that a liberal education bestows, I am quite sure that his military career would have been exceptionally brilliant. Even as things were, with only an ordinary education but with considerable natural ability, he was a company commander who would make his mark in any regiment. At any rate he was an asset to us. In the line he thought of nothing else but his job. Out of the line he was the most rollicking and apparently the most irresponsible officer in the Battalion. Nevertheless he was never absent from morning parade, and always appeared trim and soldierly. His laugh was a speciality, and so was his gift of winning men's affection. Captain Bob, as the men called him, could lead the way to the most dare-devil and hazardous stunts, and there was not one N.C.O., or Private, who wouldn't follow him.’\n\nI believe that around this time, Second Lieutenant William Waite joined ‘D’ Company from the Light Horse. Second Lieutenant Waite was raised from the ranks and an original 1914er, having joined the 4th Light Horse Regiment on Gallipoli in May 1915. Later serving with the Light Horse in France, he joined the 53rd Battalion to replenish losses, joining their ranks in mid-late September 1916. Waite was to prove his worth the following years in trench-raids and at Peronne. Second Lieutenant Waite’s arrival was followed by Second Lieutenant Reginald 'Reg' Hill, also of the Light Horse, who arrived at the battalion in October 1916 and thereupon joined ‘D’ Company. On September 4th, Corporal Sydney Campbell was appointed Sergeant, then Temporary Company Quartermaster Sergeant on the same day, replacing Sergeant Austral Hunter Burns (K 19/7/16) and CQMS Edwin Sattler (W 19/7/16) respectively. On November 12th, Company Sergeant Major John Green reverted at his own request to Sergeant.\n\nOn October 20th, Corporal Egerton Judd was promoted to Sergeant, 16 Platoon, vice Sergeant Davis' field commission. A week later, Sergeant Judd was killed in action. Corporal Mawson would take his place as Sergeant of 16 Platoon.\n\nOn November 17th, 'D' Company's new Company Sergeant Major was picked; Sergeant Frederick Loney was appointed Temporary Company Sergeant Major. This promotion was confirmed on December 14th after he had shown great gallantry in action. Frederick Loney was a rather odd character though- his real name was Frederick Syer and he was at Rabaul with the Royal Australian Navy on HMAS Encounter when men of the Kennedy Regiment mutinied. He deserted on June 28th, subsequently joining the AIF on the same day under the name Loney.\n\nIt was during this time that 16 Platoon was left in the capable hands of Sergeant Mawson. He commanded the platoon from November to December 1916 during the absence of an Officer- however, he went down the line with a sickness on December 16th, with Lance Sergeant Francis Thompson assuming the rank of Temporary Sergeant for 16 Plt during Sergeant Mawson's absence.\n\nBully Beef and Whale Oil\n\n(December 1916 to March 1917)\n\nDuring the reconstruction period of the Battalion, Lieutenant Colonel Oswald Croshaw made the decision for the men to apply whale oil to their helmets to make them look smarter, thus earning the battalion the name ‘The Whale Oil Guards’. Also during this period, a young Private James Marshall joined ‘D’ Company as a Signaller when he was merely 18. He kept a diary on him throughout his service, describing his experiences as well as drawing them. In early 1917, he experienced his first patrol with Lieutenant Waite and the effect of the whale oil against the moon.\n\n‘Well for our first night out on patrol, Mr Hill and Mr Waite tossed to see which would go out and Mr Waite won. There were twenty of us altogether, so felt pretty confident if we should meet Fritz. It was a brilliant moonlit night and with the snow on the ground, it was very bright indeed. We had hardly started out when we realised the great effect of our 'whale oiled' tin hats in the light. After wandering around for about an hour or so, we de[c]ided on a definite course of action. Mr Waite went one way with most of the party and Frank Cooling took four of us with him. We had barely gone 50yds when we saw a blaze of light in front of us and felt machine gun bullets in dozens around us. I was in a shell hole very quickly (before the bullets had time to reach us I think) and found Frank on the edge hanging on to the Germans rifle we had souvenired from a sniper earlier,; I tried to get him into the hole with me during which time our faces were about nine inches apart. Fritz firing at our radiant headgear was lobbing his missiles right between us, & it was (a) mighty unpleasant feeling too. One scratched the top of my helmet, & another went through the back of Frank's tunic. He soon opened up on the others though, who were attempting to get away, and so we took advantage of our chance, only to run into a 'flare king' about 50yds away. The rest of the patrol then saw us and we got out of a nasty position thanks to them. As the gunners saw the lot of us by the flare, we soon went home, and very quickly too.’\n\nA sketch drawn by Private James Marshall in France in 1917 at Le Transloy; Courtesy of Mitchell Library, State Library of New South Wales\n\n‘Another night we went out and found a party of men in a trench whom Mr Hill challenged, all of us thinking that at last we had some Germans at our mercy. Imagine our chagrin at getting our own password back from each one of the party. It was one of our own outposts who had started out to come home an[d] got lost. Another night though, we did bag a Germans party and left an officer & a couple of men there. The next morning as it was very misty we decided to go out and collect any papers or souvenirs on them. Tom Lucas and myself went out and found them, collecting various maps and papers, also a watch. I took an Iron Cross ribbon and on shewing it to Mr Hill was much surprised when he told me that they carried the Cross with them. He got out first and collected a brand new [Iron] Cross of the 1st class. I had to be satisfied with a helmet badge which I got later.’\n\nLieutenant Waite’s trench raids were noticed by the powers that be. From his Military Cross citation, ‘This officer took out strong patrols at night many times between 13th March and 5th April 1917. He performed exceptionally good work and showed great skill in the conduct of these patrols, thereby obtaining most valuable information which led to the entering of enemy lines at, and near [LE] TRANSLOY, and started the advance of the whole line. The information obtained by this officer and his patrols was also very largely responsible for the successful attack on DOIGNIES and LOUVERVAL on April 2nd. This work entailed lying out close to, and sometimes inside, the enemy's wire on several wet nights in succession’.\n\nBy this time, a fairly older subaltern by the name of Lieutenant William Lindsay had joined the 53rd Battalion. Lindsay had been working for a cement company when he joined the Militia in Portland in early 1914. He had been promoted to Lieutenant in July 1914 and had assisted in home-defence schemes shortly after war was declared. When 1915 came about he changed his tone to recruiting, working alongside Captain Eade at Lithgow. By 1916 he had been an instructor at Bathurst Camp when he was commissioned as a Lieutenant in March 1916. He took his first patrol out in March 1917. He described it in a letter home..\n\n\"On the night of the 16th I was detailed to take out my first patrol. I went out about midnight to some old gun pits well in front of our line and there found two other patrols; all of us under a Captain.\"\n\n\"After trying to find out information in the usual way, we were all sent out in turn to make a diversion. I was the last sent out. I had orders to do a certain thing which I accomplished with my heart in my mouth. I was then ordered to push into the enemy trench, so I started off feeling very scared, but luckily for me the Germans went out as we came in, and we had the satisfaction of capturing the trench we had been pounding at all winter.\"\n\n\"I found out afterwards that the other two patrols had got in about half an hour before me. I had charge of that portion of the trench for a few hours till my Coy. Commander came up with reinforcements and took over, when the Battalion advanced about a mile.\"\n\nIdentified is Lieutenant Waite in the bright overcoat in the front. Possibly to Waite’s left with his cap reversed is Captain Bob Ramsay; Dated Early 1917\n\nDuring March 1917, it appears Second Lieutenant Albert Cooper had temporary command of ‘D’ Company. He was however killed when a shell blew him up on March 29th, 1917. In the Red Cross report, a soldier said ‘A couple of men (LCpl Clark, Ptes Whitton, Coe and Adams) were buried by a shell and he (Cooper) rushed out with a shovel to try and dig them out and was killed himself’. Second Lieutenant Waite erected a cross on his grave; they both had risen from the ranks of the 4th Light Horse Regiment. Speaking of shellfire, Second Lieutenant Waite made good use of the time according to Private Marshall who wrote ‘One day during a heavy bombardment by Fritz Mr Waite and I passed a very good hour or so in studying the mechanism of Germans rifles and various kinds of bombs. Though it seems rather a prevarication, we quite forgot that there was a bombardment on.’. Second Lieutenant Waite was also a souvenir hunter; Private Marshall recalls a hilarious incident involving Waite and souvenirs, ‘There was also the day when we had a 24 hours battle over a souvenir. In front of one of our bombing posts there was a big crater with several defunct Germans in it. The Adjutant, Quack, our O.C. and Mr Waite were very keen on souveniring them and at last the latter took the risk and hopped over. On looking over the other side he naturally got rather a shock to see that Fritz had a bombing post there, and he soon knew it was occupied too. He came back at the ‘toot’ followed by dozens of ‘broomstick’ bombs. He retaliated with a dozen or so of Millsies. Fritz then gave us some pineapples, which was answered by Captn. Ramsay with several rounds from the Stokes, giving one Germans a fine rise in life. As he went up about fifty feet he saw things from a very lofty aspect. We then got some of his Minnies, and had a casualty through it, which set the Captain going. After withdrawing the men from the post he got the 18pdrs. onto it and completely obliterated it.’\n\nA drawing by Private James Marshall, ‘D’ Company, 53rd Battalion of the Somme; Courtesy of Mitchell Library, State Library of New South Wales\n\nOn March 13th, Temporary Sergeant Francis Thompson was promoted to substantive Sergeant for 16 Platoon. Originally he was filling in for Sergeant Mawson who had gone sick on December 16th, 1916 however Mawson was subsequently invalided home. On March 14th, Captain Ramsay had a lucky escape. He had been near Captain Trevor Francis of ‘B’ Company when a shell blew him and ‘B’ Coy’s CSM to bits, however leaving Captain Ramsay unscathed by some luck. An OR was killed by accident when a bomb went off near them on March 23rd whilst in the line, else it was mostly smooth sailing at Le Transloy.\n\n‘Toots’ and ‘Broomstick’ bombs\n\n(April 1917 to August 1918)\n\nFor the first half of April the Battalion was poised at Thilloy. On April 15th, both Second Lieutenants William Waite and Reginald Hill were promoted to two-pip Lieutenant. A week later on April 22nd, the Battalion was transported to Becourt Camp, spending their ANZAC Day there. From the 1st to 6th of May, the Battalion trained and took part in sports at Becourt. They moved off to the Reserve Line on May 7th at Beugny-Ypres line, the following day moving up to the frontline occupying a point near Beugnatre. This location was near a location known as Bullecourt where plenty of Australians had fallen fighting over less than 5 days prior. Their location was plastered with gas shells upon their arrival. On May 10th, Lieutenant Hill got a Blighty wound- a gunshot wound in the left hand, leg and foot. The following day saw 3 Other Ranks killed as well as 16 wounded by artillery fire. The day after that saw heavier artillery, 2 Other Ranks killed and 17 wounded. The following day had lighter artillery, and they were relieved on the night of May 13th/14th by the 54th Battalion in the line. The relief was complete by 2:15am on May 14th. Upon daylight breaking, they took up the Support Line near Noreuil. Compared to the previous line, the artillery was a lot less active, however, gas shells were fired on the evening of May 14th, wounding 2 Other Ranks. On the night of May 18th/19th, the Battalion moved to the frontline to relieve the 54th Battalion. The relief was complete by 1:45am. During that same period, a few reinforcements joined the Battalion. On May 22nd, the Battalion saw movement out in No Man's Land, moving towards their line. Upon the unknown object moving closer, it turned out it was a pair of 16th Battalion men who had escaped their captors. The Battalion was relieved once more on May 25th by the 12th R.R.R. By the end of the month, ‘C’ and ‘D’ Company were training at a place called Bealencourt.\n\nThe first half of June 1917 was spent training at Bealencourt, until June 15th when they were transported to Bouzincourt via a train ride from Varennes and a route march to Bouzincourt. A few shells were dropped, however they arrived safely at Bouzincourt at 4:30pm. The rest of the month was spent training once more. During their training there, Sergeant George Mitchell of ‘C’ Company died in a fire. On June 27th, Second Lieutenant Robert ‘Roy’ Lee (pictured right) joined the Battalion and was appointed Platoon Commander in 'D' Company. Roy, a native New South Welshman, had served in the New South Wales Lancers in peacetime and was commissioned into the AIF in January 1917 when he was 23. On July 3rd, Lieutenant Lindsay got a pip-up to Captain, making him the second-in-command to Captain Ramsay. On July 3rd, the Battalion marched to Bolton Camp. On the 18th, they were in Rubempre. The youthful Second Lieutenant Robert Lee then was sent to the ANZAC Corps School for an Infantry Course on July 22nd. Shortly before Polygon Wood, Lieutenant Hill was marked ‘P.B’, as was Private Marshall as he recounts in his diary..\n\n‘Mr Hill was marked P.B. and could not get up the Battalion as he wished, so I did not forget to jib him about it. There was naturally a little excitement on the day when he was orderly officer and could not at first be found. The R.S.M. was in my tent discussing it when he (Mr Hill) found that he could not stay under the table any longer so he had to come out and do his duty. Rather rough on him as he was no soldier. Just before the Polygon Wood stunt came off he went up with a draft to see the Battalion but they would not let him stay as he wished to do. So he had to come back and moan with me. We both detested the place and the crowd that infested it and would have been glad to get away from it. Eventually he did while I was in hospital.’\n\nOn September 1st, Lieutenant Colonel Oswald Croshaw reassumed command of the 53rd Battalion at Lynde, having been wounded by a shell some 6 months earlier. 2 weeks later the whole Battalion route marched to Reninghest. On the 22nd they were recorded at ‘Halfway House’. On the night of September 24th/25th, they moved to the support line in front of Glencorse Wood. At midnight on the night of 25th/26th, the Battalion moved up to take its position at the assembly line. At Zero Hour, 5:50am on September 26th, the barrage opened up on No Man’s land and the Battalion rose out of their trenches, to the barrage. 2 Companies of the 53rd led the attack and advanced towards the Butte whilst remaining 60 yards short of the barrage to avoid shrapnel. 2 Platoons captured the Butte after short hand-to-hand fighting. They captured the main objective by around 6:25am, however Lieutenant-Colonel Croshaw was missing and command had fallen to Captain Roberts. On the morning of September 26th, ‘D’ Company's Company Sergeant Major Frederick Loney was tending to 'A' Coy CSM Harry Brewer after the latter had been paralyzed by a burst of bullets in the spine. Whilst he treated him, a sniper shot Loney through the neck- he died instantly, near ANZAC Redoubt. The following day, Captain Ramsay suffered a Blighty wound with a bullet fracturing his left tibia and was carried out by a Company Runner (Pte John Rowley). Despite Captain Lindsay being Ramsay's Second-in-Command and obvious successor, it appears that Captain Albert Edward Jackson MC took over command of the Company. Also, 'D' Coy's CQMS Sydney Campbell was wounded and was subsequently replaced by Corporal Daniel Madden, who assumed the rank of CQMS on September 29th. Total Battalion casualties for the action stood at 8 officers and 342 other ranks killed, wounded or missing. Amongst them was 'A' Coy CSM Harry Brewer, who was carried out alive at 4pm and treated in a pillbox. During the night, a shell landed directly on the pillbox- blown to bits.\n\nA drawing by Private James Marshall, ‘D’ Company, 53rd Battalion of 'on the road at night on the Somme'; Courtesy of Mitchell Library, State Library of New South Wales\n\nOn October 1st, the 53rd Battalion was given a new commanding officer- Lieutenant Colonel W.J.R Cheeseman MC, late 30th Battalion. The following day, the battalion was transported to Reningheist Staging Camp arriving there on October 3rd. On October 10th, Lance Corporal Jim O'Rourke and Private Reg Edgeworth and two others were playing cards in a dugout in the supports at Zonnebeke when a shell exploded ontop of them. The two other unnamed men escaped, however O'Rourke and Edgeworth were half-buried and badly wounded. Private William Walmsley wrote in the Red Cross report-\n\n'When we ran up to them we found O'Rourke and Edgeworth half buried and both dying. O'Rourke died in my arms. Both men died when I was there..'\n\nLieutenant John Ridley (Lewis Gun Officer) presided over the burial service for both men.\n\nAfter a short spell of re-training, the Battalion re-entered the line with their CO on October 17th, entering the support line on ANZAC Ridge near Zillebeke. They remained in the support line until the 21st when they were relieved by the 30th Battalion. They were then transported to a place called Dickebusch, then onto Wippenhoek Area where they remained from October 25th to November 4th when they were transported to Neuf Berquin Area. On November 10th they were transported to the Locre Area, and the following day to the Kemmel Area, then the day after that to the support line at Wytschaete Area. On the night of November 13th/14th the Battalion assumed a position in the front line, relieving the 2nd Battalion Wiltshire Regiment; ‘D’ Company 53rd was to relieve ‘B’ Company Wiltshires in the Left Support Line. On the night of November 15th/16th the 54th Battalion relieved the 53rd Battalion’s left and as a result, ‘D’ Company relieved ‘B’ Company in the Right Support Line. The Battalion held the front line until the night of November 28th/29th when they were relieved by the 60th Battalion. From there, the Battalion was transported back to the Kemmel Area. On December 1st, the Battalion was bivouacked at Ramillies Camp and just under 2 weeks later the Battalion was transported to Desvres, then on the 14th to Menty. For the rest of December 1917 the Battalion was entrained with little else occurring of note.\n\nIn January 1918, Captain Jackson appointed his new Company Sergeant Major- Samuel ‘Frank’ Cooling. He had proved himself at Polygon Wood where he was recommended for the MM (which was promulgated in the London Gazette on January 14th 1918 on page 845). During this time, the Battalion was settled in Menty. On January 31st, the Battalion would wind up in the reserve line at Wyschaete. They moved up into the frontline nearly 3 weeks later on February 20th relieving the 56th Battalion; ‘D’ Company 53rd relieved ‘D’ Coy 56th. On the night of March 1st whilst still in the line, the ‘D’ Company was in support near the line near Hollebeke. A party was sent out on a wiring expedition, containing 1 Officer, 10 men. From what can be pieced together, a minenwerfer landed in between the party at around 10pm and this was the result.\n\nOfficer Commanding the party is unknown [Possibly Lt Anslow]\n\nLance Corporal Keith Comb was blown to bits by the shell\n\nPrivate Stan Mears was killed by the shell\n\nPrivate Ralph Pendleton was mortally wounded in the body and thigh\n\nPrivate Hill was mortally wounded and apparently killed from concussion\n\nPrivate Fred Kafer was wounded in the head and buttocks\n\nPrivate Johnston was wounded\n\nPrivate Joe Taylor returned unwounded\n\nPrivate James McDonald returned unwounded\n\nPrivate Arthur Whiteford returned unwounded\n\nPrivate Nathaniel Wheatley returned unwounded\n\nPrivate Walmsley said after the fact that ‘(they) were so badly blown about that we could not even find their paybooks’. A temporary cross was erected on the point and the bodies were reburied after the war in the Somer Farm Cemetery. Comb and Pendleton and buried together as are Hill and Mears. On March 21st and 3 weeks in the front line, a barrage fell on the 53rd Battalion’s forward posts in the line. After a few casualties had been taken, they were relieved by the 56th Battalion on the same day. They were transported to the Wippenhoek area on March 26th, then the Louvencourt on the 28th followed by the Harponville area on March 31st and remained there for nearly a week.\n\nMembers of ‘C’ Company, 53rd Battalion in the reserve line. Dated April 1st, 1918\n\nOn the night of April 5th/6th, the 53rd Battalion relieved the 17th Lancers in the Front Line near Villers-Bretonneux. ‘D’ Company was to be held in reserve, ‘C’ Coy in the support line and ‘A’ and ‘B’ Coys to take up a position in the frontline; a total of 20 officers and 498 other ranks entered the line. At dusk on April 6th, Lance Corporal Harry Kelly and Private John Christie both of 15 Platoon were sent out on a rations fatigue. Whilst on this fatigue, a HE Shell landed quite near to the both of them, killing them. Their causes of death are subjective-\n\nPrivate Mick Lennon stated '..with the exception of a slight scratch on Christie's forehead (there were) no wounds on either of them, so came to the conclusion that they had been killed by the concussion of the explosion'\n\nPrivate Fines Godding stated 'One (was killed) by bullet and the other with HE shell'\n\nEither way, a shell ended both of their lives atleast indirectly or indeed directly.\n\nOn April 8th, two lighting patrol were sent out containing 30 men from ‘D’ Company each under two Subalterns from another company. They patrolled no man's land during the night and reported no enemy movement upon their return. On April 9th, Captain Lindsay was seconded to the 175th [or 174th] Brigade as a Liaison Officer leaving D Company down an officer.. The following day saw Sergeant Jack Croker rejoining the Company in the field, assuming command of the Lewis Gun Section attached to D Company- all these Lewis Gun Sections were overseen by an Officer, Lieutenant John Ridley [Later MC]. On the morning of April 11th, Captain Jackson was slightly wounded. He was not moved down the line and remained at his post. On April 17th at 4:30am, the company was badly shelled with gas. Casualties included the Battalion Commander (Cheeseman), ‘D’ Coys Lt Roy Anslow, CSM Cooling and CQMS Madden; all of whom were ‘gassed’ in the shelling. CQMS Madden's replacement would be Corporal Tom Akeroyd, however he would be promoted to substantive Sergeant the following month. CSM Cooling's replacement would be Sergeant Francis Thompson\n\nOn April 28th, Lieutenant Robert Lee along with 3 other subalterns and 62 other ranks reported to the Battalion Headquarters to be taken onto strength. Lieutenant Lee was assigned to ‘D’ Company. Captain Lindsay took over command of the Company on May 3rd after returning from his secondment. Shortly after Captain Lindsay returned, it is noted that Lieutenant Robert Lee was the OC 14 Platoon in a report. Speaking of which, it is in this period that a few fieldbook excerpts from Captain Lindsay survive. Below are the surviving pages which record promotions, recommendations, reports and plenty of information on a company level.\n\nOn the night of May 4th/5th, the 53rd Battalion moved from the reserve line to the front line, relieving the 54th Battalion. ‘D’ Company 53rd relieved ‘D’ Company 54th Battalion in the line on the right. At 11pm on May 6th, Lieutenant Hill (‘D’ Coy) took a patrol of 10 men out into no mans land. Voices were heard however no enemy sighted and they returned without incident at 1am on May 7th. On the night of May 8th/9th, the 54th Battalion relieved the 53rd Battalion and the former moved down to the reserve line. A week later in the late evening of May 16th, the Battalion relieved the 30th Battalion in the Hamel Sector. ‘D’ Company 53rd relieved ‘B’ Company 30th in the Right Reserve. At 12:10am on May 18th, Lieutenant Hill took out a patrol with 11 men; They found the location of a forward post with atleast 12 enemies, a wiring party was heard before the patrol returned at 1:40am. On the afternoon of May 18th, 18 pounders fired accidentally onto the 53rd Battalion’s front line. One of the shells badly wounded an other rank who nearly had his whole leg severed off by a shell. At 12am on May 23rd/24th, Lieutenant Hill took out another patrol with 4 men. They moved up the Vaire-Hamel road and reconnoitered the area. An enemy trench was found full of men but else nothing of note was found. They returned to the friendly lines at 1:15am. On the night of May 28th/29th, the 53rd Battalion was relieved by the 55th Battalion and the Battalion moved down to the reserve line. On the night of May 31st/June 1st, the 53rd Battalion was relieved in the reserve line by the 13th Battalion; they proceeded to settle in the Querrieu area. Whilst out of the line, new uniforms were issued, boots fixed, barbers at work and so on. On June 7th, Lieutenant Waite MC arrived back at the battalion, following a bullet in the buttocks at Polygon Wood during September last. He had an interesting time in England - moreover, losing his seniority after using a forged railway ticket and presenting said ticket to a Railway Transport Officer. An altercation and he loses seniority, though he still remains a Lieutenant and platoon commander. On June 11th, the ‘Kookaburras’, otherwise the 5th Division Concert Party supplied the Battalion with ample entertainment, performing for them in Querrieu. On June 15th, Lieutenant Hill and Major Roberts DSO were marched out to form a nucleus alongside 63 other ranks, depriving ‘D’ Company of atleast 1 officer. That same day, the Battalion moved up to the reserve line at the Franvillers System. They were to remain there until the night of June 26th/27th when they relieved the 30th Battalion in the front line. ‘D’ Company 53rd relieved ‘B’ Company 30th in the reserve. On June 30th, Lieutenant Waite (‘D’ Coy) took out a patrol and returned with an enemy machine gun, 2 belts, containers, pack, rifle and greatcoat. After quite the spell in the front line, the Battalion was relieved by the 55th Battalion on the night of July 10th/11th, and thereon moved to the support line. On the night of July 17th/18th the 53rd Battalion relieved the 54th Battalion in the front line, however moved back down to the reserve line after being relieved by the 54th Battalion on the night of July 19th/20th. By this time it was evident that there was a stunt planned in the air.\n\nA photograph of Lieutenant Waite taken whilst in England. His Military Cross is pinned up. Dated 1918\n\nOn July 27th, the Battalion moved from the reserve line to the Front Line in preparation for the stunt. By nightfall, the battalion stood at 23 officers and 543 Other Ranks. By the morning of July 28th, ‘A’, ‘B’ and ‘C’ Company were in the line whilst ‘D’ Company was in support. The 53rd Battalion was to participate in an action at Morlancourt on July 29th, 1918. ‘D’ Company had the pure luck to be a carrying party for the action. At 1.25am, the attack began. Information into what ‘D’ Company did throughout the day is not mentioned in the War Diary, however a recommendation for the Military Cross was written up for Captain Lindsay, explaining what the Company was doing. This recommendation didn’t lead to anything, however it read in part..\n\nThis Officer was incharge of 2 platoons who acted as carrying parties for the attacking troops in the attack on the enemy trenches near Morlancourt.\n\nIt was owing to his excellent judgment and personal direction and supervision that the carrying parties (strength 45) were able to cross and re-cross “No Mans Land” in the open although subjected to Artillery and Machine Gun fire with the loss of 1 man.\n\nGreat quantities of stores, rations and water were carried by these parties and dumps established in the captured enemy line. During the night following the attack(,) ration parties carrying hot food to the men in the front line were caught in a severe enemy artillery ‘strafe’ lasting from 10.15pm to 5.am next morning.\n\nCaptain LINDSAY personally led these parties to their destination in doing so exposing himself to very great danger and although on one occasion he was badly shaken by a shell he still continued his work.\n\nOn July 30th, the Battalion came out of the line and was moved to Vaux-en-Amiénois, to which they arrived at on July 31st at 6am. August 1st saw the whole Battalion getting haircuts and company inspections across the Battalion. The next few days passed without notoriety. On the night of August 4th, the Battalion marched to the bivouacs at Querrieu, arriving at said location at 2am. The following day on the 6th, battle orders were received from the brass and the whole of the battalion was overcome by a wave of excitement for the upcoming stunt. They remained at Querrieu until the morning of August 8th, 1918..\n\nThe Last Hundred Days\n\n(August 1918 to November 1918)\n\nOn August 8th, 1918 at 1.45am, the Battalion moved from Querrieu to the start line for the forth-coming advance. The strength of the 53rd stood at 24 officers at 432 Other Ranks. After 2 hours of waiting for Zero Hour, the trench whistles blew at 4.20am. The Battalion advanced into the morning mist. After 5 minutes of stumbling around at dawn, elements of the brigade captured the trenches near Villers-Bretonneux. By 7am, the 53rd Battalion consolidated on the recently-captured trenches in preparation for another advance. By midday, the Battalion was at Cerisy Valley. At 4pm the Battalion was advancing onto Bayonvillers where they halted and fully consolidated. During the advances on August 8th, Captain Lindsay was riding a horse when a shell landed next to the horse; the horse was blown to bits and two men wounded, however it left Captain Lindsay unscathed. These casualties would be the only ones suffered by the 53rd Battalion on that day. By the end of the day, the men were exhausted from the 12 mile advance, however the men were galvanized when they heard of the successes along the line. Private Marshall who had served in D Company before a transfer to Headquarters Company recorded the actions at Morlancourt in his diary ‘We stayed near Corbie till the barrage started, then we began to advance. The trip to our starting point was not without it’s excitement. Fritz planes were very busy and at one halt, when the troops were all smoking, he came in our direction at a great pace. But nothing extraordinary happened. We stayed on the right of the village of Villers Brettonneux(sic) for a few hours, and moved on again. We knew that it was going successfully as there were no enemy guns firing, and that was a great comfort to us too. Our big guns had been brought right up under the Germans’ noses on the night before so they had no need to move forward then. There were crowds of prisoners everywhere, and the troops spent a good deal of time in souveniring them. All of the prisoners were sure that they had lost the war, and that we would go right on to Berlin. Just before we moved off, there was a little excitement. We were all sitting about talking, when there was a terrific explosion just behind us. A big shell of a new ‘toute suite’ variety had landed about 20 yards off. There had been absolutely no sound of it’s approach at all. Naturally we all had the wind up about some more coming unannounced, but the next went further off and we heard the report of the gun first, then the shell hurtling overhead. They were fired [at] long intervals and all over the country. So we knew that he had one gun still.’ The following day, the Battalion remained in the positions captured the previous day. Strength was increased to 28 Officers and 552 Other Ranks. On August 17th, Lieutenant Reg Hill proceeded to England for a few weeks leave.\n\nOn August 22nd, Second Lieutenant Rupert Dent joined ‘D’ Company as a Platoon Commander. He was a new boy, however a Duntroon man (Dec 1916) making him very desirable, considering that most Duntroon men had been repurposed into sandbags or rear-echelon duties. He had applied for a commission in 1915 but only arrived in England in May 1918. After a spell of training, he was on his way to France with the 53rd Battalion. Despite his higher education, Second Lieutenant Dent was still the new boy and the officer with the least seniority in ‘D’ Company, however still better educated. He was to be in a stunt after nearly a week at the front. As an addition, on August 28th, CQMS Madden rejoined the Battalion after having been in England after being gassed in April 1918.\n\nSecond Lieutenant Rupert Dent. Date unknown\n\nAt 1am on September 1st, the Battalion was treated to a hot meal- for some, it would be their last. At 3.30am, the battalion moved into ‘Florine’ and ‘Prague’ Trench. As ‘C’ Company was taking up their position they were met with the most interesting sight- Germans in their trench. A quick fight ensued, with the Germans firing an SOS flare leading to a barrage falling very nearby with ‘C’ Company coming out ontop. At 6am, the whistle blew and the Battalion began their attack. The positions of the companies were ‘A’ Company - Right ; ‘B’ Company - Right Support ; ‘C’ Company - Left ; ‘D’ Company - Left Support.\n\nIn the initial advance, the Battalion was met by a heavy wire belt which was supposed to be cleared in an earlier artillery barrage. Despite heavy fire raining down on them, soldiers from Lt Waite’s platoon started to cut the wire with the motivational support of their Lewis Gunners. After what felt like an eternity, a passage was forged through the wire, allowing the attack to continue.\n\nThe ‘heavy wire belt’ that the 53rd Battalion had to cut through. This particular photograph was taken on September 2nd, 1918; Only a day after the fact with the bodies still remaining\n\nThe Company broke through the heavy wire belt and advanced to the objectives. Shortly after breaking through the wire, 'D' Company's CSM Samuel 'Frank' Cooling was shot through the calf in the left leg. Despite the wound, he continued to push on with Lt Roy Anslow's 16 Platoon. On the other side of the advance through Anvil Wood performed by ‘A’ and ‘B’ Company, a 77mm Field Gun was spotted nearby and manned by the enemy. Private Currey from ‘B’ Company didn’t hesitate and taking a Lewis Gun firing from the hip either dispersed or killed all the enemy manning the gun. Not too long afterwards, Major Murray sent an urgent message to ‘D’ Company to inform them that his left flank was in the air. Captain Lindsay moved his company to the flank of ‘C’ Company with the aim of providing support due to the absence of the 23rd Battalion. ‘D’ Company provided splendid support however sustained severe casualties via machine guns. At 11am, Lieutenant Anslow was with his 16 Platoon in an entrenched machine gun position. They were all bunched up in the trench when a barrage of 5.9inch shells landed around their position. A shell landed in the middle of the platoon, killing Lieutenant Anslow, Sergeant Taylor, Corporal Hayward, Lance Corporals Upton and Barrie as well as Privates Masson and Ries. The shell also wounded 3 others, but either way 16 Platoon was severely hindered by the loss of their senior NCOs and their officer. A wounded CSM Cooling took the initiative and commanded what remained of 16 Platoon to the objective.\n\nBurial marker for the Anslow and his men killed by the shell. Dated 1918\n\nAt some point not too long after Anslow’s death, Lieutenant Waite had spotted an unmanned German 77mm Field Gun that had been recently liberated by Private Currey. He sent Signaller Hopkins to get it ready for action. When Hopkins arrived there he was assisted by Private Crank. The pair loaded and fired the gun to great effect on the enemy despite no knowledge about firing a field gun. They began firing on the enemies amassing on the left flank despite heavy machine gun fire. After a great many shells were fired, the enemy dispersed and both men returned to their companies.\n\nAt around 4:40pm, Captain Lindsay had suffered a gunshot wound; a bullet that fractured his left tibia. Despite his wound, he led an attack, supervised consolidation of a new position further forwards before allowing stretcher bearers to take him back to the RAP. Lieutenant Dent also was wounded by a burst of machine gun bullets which found its mark in his left shoulder. By 5pm, Lieutenant Waite was the last officer of ‘D’ Company still in the fight. He led the company with vigor towards St Denis [62c.I.22] via the St Denis-Mont St Quentin Road, killing 12 Germans along the way, settling in a location known as the Sugar Factory, with the object of making it a forward post. Waite, with his 20 men was greatly assisted by Sergeant Cuthbert Lineham who by now was commanding one of the platoons. Also of assistance was Corporal Charlie Smith who helped in collecting bombs, ammunition and other items to resupply the men; when they reached the Sugar Factory, Smith volunteered to keep a casting eye over the enemy, reporting their movement to Waite. Whilst holding the Sugar Factory, the Company wiped out a machine gun nest some 200 yards away to his front. However, unbeknownst to Waite, he had lost contact with his own Battalion and was under threat of being completely cut off and therefore risked capture.\n\nAbove is the rough ground that Waite and his Company advanced through on September 1st, 1918 towards the Sugar Factory. Infact, towards the centre-left of the photograph in the distance following along the mini-rise on the right, you can see what remains of the Sugar Factory- 3 corner pillars. Dated September 15th, 1918.\n\nMessengers were sent out to try and tell him to fall back, yet no one found him. Shortly after midnight, a certain Private Currey (‘B’ Company) volunteered to find Waite in the dark to tell him to withdraw. He went out for the first time, not running into any Germans by some luck. When he came back to friendly lines, he went out again to no avail. The third time his Company Commander said it had to be done, to which Currey said ‘If I can’t find Mr Waite, I will stand up and shout to him’. Currey went out to find Lieutenant Waite and his party once more at 3am. When 8am rolled around and he still hadn’t found Waite, Currey yelled out ‘Waitsey, Come Back!’. A reply was met with machine guns, bolt actions, the whole kitchen sink. Luckily for everyone involved, Lieutenant Waite heard the message from Currey and quickly began bringing his company out of the Sugar Factory back to friendly lines. Private Patrick Allan, a machine gunner, was the last to leave the Sugar Factory position. Waite withdrew the Company under a smoke screen to the crossroad near Saint-Denis (62c.I.22.a.7.6) under the cover of a bank. He remained there until told to fall back by Major Murray. Peronne was a success by all accounts, with Mont St Quentin and Peronne falling over the next day or two. ‘D’ Company had gone into the line with 4 Officers and 90 other ranks - the whole battalion suffered 11 officers and 241 Other Ranks as casualties - of whom 4 officers and 47 other ranks of the Battalion were killed (11 other ranks to DoW). Captain Lindsay suffered a Blighty wound; fractured tibia on the left leg, similar to his previous Company Commander some 11 months previous. He also was to score a Military Cross at Peronne. ‘D’ Company was only left with 1 officer who had survived unwounded.. Dent had also got a Blighty wound (GSW right shoulder) and Anslow was killed with his men, leaving Lieutenant William Waite MC, as last officer standing from ‘D’ Company and by default took command of ‘D’ Company after Captain Lindsay. Coy Sgt Major Cooling had also copped it and was evacuated to hospital, making Sergeant Lineham the acting CSM until Cooling returned shortly after the wars end. Oddly enough, Waite also scored a decoration, earning a Bar to his Military Cross. Lieutenant Waite assumed command of ‘D’ Company shortly after Peronne, presumably the day after on September 2nd. It is unknown how long he was in temporary command, however whilst Waite was Company Commander he had time to write up a recommendation to the Commanding Officer. It read..\n\nC.O.\n\n53rd BATTALION A.I.F\n\nI wish to bring before your notice the conspicuous gallantry and bravery in action of NO.2153 PRIVATE CRANK during the recent operations at PERONNE.\n\nDuring the early stages of the attack, a 77mm Field gun was captured with about 70 rounds of ammunition. Private Crank in company with another man*, at once set to work to find out how to detonate the shell and fire the gun. Having ascertained this, he at once brought the gun to bear on the enemy who were massing, apparently for a counter attack on the left flank of the Battalion.\n\nImmediately upon the 77mm gun opening fire, the enemy brought intense artillery and Machine Gun fire to bear on the gun; notwithstanding this, Private Crank and his comrade continued to fire with great rapidity, causing heavy casualties, and finally compelling the enemy to disperse. He then rejoined his Company.\n\nLater in the day noticing the enemy again massing on the left flank, he, in company with another man**, remanned the captured gun and continued firing it until all the ammunition was exhausted, despite renewed enemy artillery and Machine Gun activity, and despite the fact, that there being no way of cleaning the gun there was grave risk of the barrel bursting.\n\n(Signed) W.Waite Lieut.\n\nO.C “D” Company 53rd Battalion A.I.F\n\n*The other man was Lance Corporal Cec Weatherby; later a DCM\n\n**Cec was wounded shortly after the first gun instance, the other man was Private Arthur Hopkins; later an MM\n\nThanks to Lieutenant Waite’s recommendation, Crank was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal despite an original recommendation for a Victoria Cross. There were many recommendations made to men of the 53rd Battalion relating to the Peronne stunt. Below are ones from 'D' Company.\n\nCapt William Frederic Lindsay. Recommended for the MC (Awarded)\n\n'During the attack on PERONNE on 1st September, 1918, Captain LINDSAY led his Company with the utmost gallantry in the attack.\n\nDuring the advance, the left flank of the Battalion was imperilled and Captain LINDSAY under terrific Machine Gun FIre got his Company in position in the open, and brought fire to bear on the enemy massing, inflicting casualties and causing them to disperse. His action undoubtedly allowed the advance to continue and removed a serious menace to that flank of the Battalion. Throughout the action he set a fine example, and much of the success of the Battalion was due to the skillful handling of his Company.\n\nLater on during the action, he again led an attack and although wounded, established a line with his Company and supervising the consolidation before permitting the stretcher bearers to carry him to the R.A.P'\n\nLt William Waite MC. Recommended for a Bar for his MC (Awarded)\n\n'For most conspicuous gallantry an devotion to duty in action. During the attack on PERONNE on 1st September 1918 despite strong Enemy wire entanglements and Machine Gun and Artillery Barrage, Lieut. WAITE with his platoon forced a passage through the wire and moved forward to the attack. While the advance was in progress, the enemy was observed to be massing on the left which was an exposed flank, and Lieut. Waite despite heavy casualties brought his Platoon into action in the open and inflicted so many casualties in the enemies ranks that he was forced to disperse and allow the advance to continue.\n\nIn the second attack all the Officers of his Company became casualties, and he assumed command, and established posts well forward, which he successfully held until ordered to withdraw by the Commanding Officer [Lieutenant Colonel Cheeseman].\n\nHe displayed the utmost gallantry, and such disregard of personal safety throughout, that he won the admiration of all ranks.'\n\n3261 CSM (WO.II) Samuel Frank Cooling MM. Recommended for a Bar to his MM (Never Awarded)\n\n'This NCO has been with the Battalion since its formation and has at all times displayed the utmost gallantry, initiative and constant good work both in and out of the line.\n\nHe did valuable work on patrols on the SOMME 1916-17 and was badly wounded at BULLECOURT in May 1917\n\nIn POLYGON WOOD in September 1917 he showed great dash, courage and initiative. Although wounded on the tapes he went forward, urging his men on, showing utter disregard for his own personal safety, his conduct helping greatly towards the success of the operation.\n\nAt PERONNE in September 1918, CSM Cooling again set a fine example to his men, being wounded at the beginning of the operation he carried on, and when his platoon officer (Lt Anslow) was killed he took command till the objective was reached.'\n\n3582 Sgt James Patrick Joseph Sullivan. Recommended for the MM (Never Awarded)\n\n'In the attack on PERONNE on the morning of the 1st September, Sergeant Sullivan took his platoon into action and remained in command throughout the attack. He displayed very high powers of leadership and maintained complete control of his command throughout. He took every opportunity of reorganizing his platoon as casualties occurred and by utter disregard for his own personal safety set a splendid example to his men, into whom he infused a spirit of absolute confidence in their leader.\n\nOn reaching the final objective he rendered very valuable assistance to his Company Commander during the organization of his Company.'\n\n5474 LCpl Amos John Turner. Recommended for the MM (Awarded)\n\n'In the recent attack on PERONNE on the 1st September 1918, this N.C.O. showed great coolness and daring in working his Lewis Gun. Throughout the action he kept up a constant fire although he himself was subjected to heavy machine gun and artillery fire, and inflicted a large number of casualties on the enemy. In the latter part of the advance he was severely wounded in the shoulder and also had the Butt blown off his gun. However, he still continued in action until loss of blood and weakness forced him leave the line for medical attention.'\n\n2474 LCpl Richard Quantrill. Recommended for the MM (Awarded)\n\n'In the attack on PERONNE on 1st September 1918 this N.C.O. rendered the greatest assistance to his Company Commander in controlling and reorganising his section. When the objective was reached he took charge of an isolated post on the Left Flank displaying splendid powers of leadership and control. Under heavy artillery and machine gun fire he assisted in digging out several men who had been buried by shells and helped attending to the wounded.\n\nAt all times he set a splendid example to the men of his Platoon.'\n\n4852 LCpl Albert Edward Lonsdale Smith. Recommended for the MM (Awarded)\n\n'For conspicuous courage and coolness in action during the attack on PERONNE on 1st September 1918. This N.C.O. when in Charge of a Lewis Gun displayed great initiative in the early part of the advance in supplying covering fire for his Platoon. During the greater part of the advance he used his gun from the hip and was successful in gaining superiority of fire thus enabling his platoon to advance. Later while covering the consolidation of his Company he was almost surrounded by the enemy; however he brought his gun into action and was successful in beating them off. He kept his gun firing until it was put out of action by a direct hit. Smith at once returned to his Company, procured another gun and brought it into action inflicting great losses on the enemy and silencing two enemy Machine Guns.'\n\n2247 LCpl Oscar William Smith. Recommended for the DCM (Awarded)\n\n'For conspicuous gallantry and determination in action at Peronne, 1 September, 1918. He was sent to get in touch with the brigade on the left, and had to cross open ground swept by machine gun fire. On the way he was held up by a machine gun post, which opened fire. He at once shot the observer, killed the crew of six, and captured the gun.'\n\n5380 Signaller Arthur John Hopkins. Recommended for a DCM (Awarded MM)\n\n'For conspicuous gallantry during the attack on PERONNE on 1st September 1918. During the early stages of the attack an Enemy 77.mm. gun was captured with a large supply of ammunition. He helped another man to work this gun having first ascertained how to detonate the shells, and fire the gun, despite the fact that the enemy immediately opened up with heavy artillery and machine gun fire directed against them, and despite the fact that owing to their being no method of cleaning the gun there was great danger of the barrel bursting. The fire from this gun was brought to bear on a quarry on the left flank of the Battalion, where the enemy were assembling, apparently with a view to a counter attack, and such heavy casualties were caused that they were forced to disperse. The action of this man contributed largely to the success of the operation as the Left Flank of the Battalion at that time was in a very exposed position, and if a counter attack had been launched there would have been grave risk of the Battalion being cut off.'\n\nIn a Special Order posted by Lieutenant-Colonel Cheeseman on December 13th, 1918, it announced all the awards for the Peronne stunt. There was a VC, DSO, 2 bars to MC, 6 MCs, 7 DCMs, 2 bars to MM and 19 MMs. Of these, members of D Coy were awarded..\n\n1 Bar to MC - Lieutenant Waite MC\n\n1 MC - Captain Lindsay\n\n1 DCM - Pte Oscar Smith\n\n4 MMs - Coy Sgt Maj Lineham, Sgt Croker, LCpl Brickie Smith, Sig Hopkins,\n\nIn the days following Peronne, Lieutenant Hill would return from his leave, assuming command of his platoon once more. On September 4th at the bivouacs at Herrecourt, the General Officer Commanding 5th Division, with Brigadier-General 14th Brigade inspected and addressed the men of the 53rd Battalion with great praise in respect of the actions at Morlancourt and Peronne. The following day saw a thunderstorm roll onto them whilst they moved their bivouacs. By this time, the Battalion stood at 23 officers and 281 men. On September 7th whilst the Battalion was camped at Le Mesnil, Major Lucas and Lieutenant Waite went back to Peronne to check that all battalion dead were buried. It had turned out that the 1st Brigade had been bivouacked at Peronne and had buried all the dead. On September 12th, a few German planes were spotted overhead- 2 were shot down and 3 turned tail and ran. On that same day, some machine gun practice took place during which time 'D' Coy's 5343 Private Beech was accidentally killed by a live bullet mixed in a machine gun belt. On September 26th, some 2 weeks after the aerial attack, Lieutenant-Colonel Cheeseman called a conference of all Company Commanders. During this conference, the Colonel outlined an upcoming stunt to come in the following days. At 7:30pm the following day, the Battalion marched out of Le Mesnil and moved towards a place near Hervilly.\n\nOn September 30th, Colonel Cheeseman was sent away to a conference at 3am on an upcoming attack that was to occur later that day. With zero hour fixed for 6am, they were expected to step off at below adequate fighting strength. The Battalion’s Companies were instead to work in conjunction- 'A' and 'B' Company would work together on one objective whilst 'C' and 'D' Company would take on another. Captain Wilson would take 'C' and 'D' Company into the attack whilst Captain Jhonson MC took 'A' and 'B'. A certain Lieutenant Arthur Thompson would assume command of 'D' Company. Little is known of his service, mainly due to the fact that his record consists of virtually 3 pages. What is known is that he was 18 when he enlisted in 1915, and was granted a commission the following year.\n\nThe Battalion passed the jump-off point just a few minutes past 6am; the role of ‘C' and 'D’ Company was ‘that of mopping up the (Bellicourt) Tunnel and vicinity’. On the advance to the tunnel, the company came under intense machine gun and artillery fire. Captain Wilson ably led the two Companies past the first line of trenches at 9am, before he was shot through the neck (severing his windpipe) with a machine gun bullet. He fell, his death almost instantaneous.\n\nAround this time, Lieutenant Thompson was severely wounded leading 'D' Company along a canal. Lieutenant Hill was leading his 15 Platoon the far flung left flank of the company, but due to heavy casualties being taken he was eventually separated from the company, leaving himself and 6 of his men isolated on that flank of the line. It is said that he continued the advance with merely Sergeants Smith, Callaghan and Quantrill, a Corporal and 2 other men to avoid the flank of the battalion collapsing. After a short advance they were met with a most unusual sight- a machine gun strong post which was pouring enfilading fire on the battalion. Lieutenant Hill didn’t hesitate; he personally led a skeleton charge against the post, killing 20 Germans and capturing 3 machine guns. It was only a very short time before he became a double entrance dugout which had machine guns on each entrance.. Lieutenant Hill, assisted by Sergeant Charlie Smith, collected a few stick grenades and gallantly ran towards the bunker with revolver in hand, shooting 3 men along the way and lobbing grenades all the while. When the smoke cleared, he had killed 15 along the way basically singlehandedly, also capturing 2 machine guns. He then received immediate orders to assist ‘A/B’ Company at the Le Catalet Trench System at around 2pm. Upon reaching said location, he ‘commenced bombing up the trench, and cleared it for a distance of 600 yards’ with Private Charlie Baker leading as the 'bayonet man'. He and five men in that bombing party had killed 20 odd and captured 7 machine guns, however was obliged to withdraw 200 yards when he was too far from the line. Upon falling back, he established a vital bomb block at around 3pm with the valuable assistance of Sergeants Smith and Dick Callaghan whilst Corporal Reg Lyons watched from afar, providing support along with Sergeant William Smith. The bomb block is listed at location A.22.d.45.65. The bomb block was held until midnight. During the action, Lieutenant Hill is also listed to have captured 2 German 77mm field guns.\n\nThe men of that party were-\n\nLt Reginald Hill [Officer Commanding; awarded DSO]\n\nSgt Charlie Smith [awarded DCM]\n\nSgt Dick Callaghan [awarded DCM]\n\nSgt Richard Quantrill [awarded MM]\n\nT/Cpl Charlie Taylor [awarded MM]\n\nLCpl William Borserio [recommended MM]\n\nPte Charlie Baker [recommended MM]\n\n*It is confusing as to how many men were involved due to confliction of stories, however I believe it was only 1 officer and 6 men that were involved in that 'charge', per citations.\n\nOn October 1st, Lieutenant Hill, Sergeant Quantrill and a handful of other ranks went out on patrol to find the German line. They were successful in this, also locating some German machine gun posts in the process; in that daylight patrol, no one was wounded despite coming under machine gun fire. At 9:30pm on October 2nd, the Battalion was relieved by the 6th Inniskilling in the line. At the end of it, Lieutenant Hill was the subject of many letters. Lieutenant Cooke, Sergeants Quantrill, Charlie Smith and one of the Corporals involved all sent in recommendations to Colonel Cheeseman. As a result of his exemplary gallantry, Lieutenant Hill was awarded a DSO for his actions, and the others involved duly decorated.\n\nThen-Second Lieutenant Hill. Dated perhaps 1916-17.\n\nOn October 3rd, the Battalion buried Captain Wilson MC, Lieutenant Althouse and Second Lieutenant Ralph MM at Tincourt. Also, Captain Jhonson MC, OC of ‘A/B’ Company was to die of wounds sustained in the action on October 2nd, 1918. Despite the casualties, spirits were apparently high whilst the battalion billeted at Villeret. The following day, Lieutenant-Colonel Cheeseman MC addressed the troops, thanking them for their effort in the battle just a few days prior. Reorganization is said to have taken place during this time. On October 5th, they winded up at Le Mesnil then onto St Maxent on October 7th. Upon arrival at St Maxent, the Battalion stood at 24 Officers and 306 Other Ranks. For nearly a week it rained on the Battalion in varying strength until the clouds cleared on October 13th. Around this time, Lieutenant Justin Cooke, 53rd Battalion was appointed Captain which coincided with his taking command of ‘D’ Company, 53rd Battalion in October 1918. He had started out as a recently-married Second Lieutenant in 1915 with the 8th Battalion in Victoria and had worked his way up to Captain with only one wound stripe on his sleeve for a gas attack in April 1918.\n\nThe then-Lieutenant Justin Cooke, whilst with a Training Battalion in England.\n\nFor the rest of October 1918, inter-battalion competitions took place with men from each company representing their companies. Decides from that, the war diary states ‘(St Maxent) is mostly without extraordinary incident’. This is a bit of an understatement- On October 5th, Sergeant Croker was admitted to hospital with Broncho-Pneumonia. He succumbed some 9 days later. He was later awarded an MM and Bar for actions at Peronne and Bellicourt. He was the last wartime casualty for D Company before the armistice.\n\nOn October 22nd, the strength of the Battalion was depleted and stood at 27 Officers and 289 Other Ranks. Lieutenant-Colonel Cheeseman saw the positives of the depleted numbers by stating ‘it is possible to train every man (on) the Lewis Gun, and the Battalion in consequence is becoming a Battalion of Lewis Gunners, which is most useful knowledge to have in case of emergency’. By the turn of the month the battalion had only risen to 29 Officers and 328 Other Ranks. On November 8th the ‘Miss Lina Ashwells Concert Party’ performed a few sketches for the Battalion in St Maxent. On November the 11th, 1918, Colonel Cheeseman paraded the battalion under unknown pretenses. He began reading parts of Prince Litchnowsky’s disclosures showing why Germany was to blame for the war, and commented at the end as a side note “By the way, hostilities will cease at 11am today”. Everyone was rejoicing, less a few who didn’t believe that it was actually over. When the whole village found out, ‘the village immediately became almost festive with bunting’.\n\nThe surviving members of ‘D’ Company, 53rd Battalion were photographed with merely 5 officers* and 42 men with their appropriate webbing on. At the end of the war, soldiers of the Company returned home and were subsequently discharged in 1919/20, returning to civilian life.\n\n*One of the officers may be Temporary Company Sergeant Major Lineham\n\nIdentified is Lieutenant William Waite MC (Later Bar); second from front, sixth from left. Also identified is Lieutenant Justin Cooke who is on Waite’s left shoulder with a tall posture.\n\nIt is worth noting that Lieutenant Rupert Dent, who had been wounded at Peronne on September 1st was getting acquainted with Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon; later known as the Queen Mother to most. He met her whilst he was recuperating at Glamis Castle in Scotland and they became good friends and very fond of eachother. They took walks in the garden and taught Elizabeth a thing or two. When Rupert was to be Returned to Australia, Elizabeth's mother wrote in a letter ‘I want to thank you for the good advice you gave my Elizabeth. I profited by it even more than she did. I needed it more than she does. Do let us hear from you from time to time. We shall never forget you’. Dent destroyed the letters to avoid embarrassment however his family still knew about it all. When he was asked by his children about how close they were, Rupert responded ‘Well, we took lots of long walks together. A gentleman doesn't tell’. In 2013, surviving letters of the affair were found in an old drawer and later sold for the large sum of $3600 AUD.\n\nA final bit worth mentioning; Company Sergeant Major Samuel Cooling MM had joined the 53rd Battalion in Egypt in 1916. He then served at Fromelles where he was wounded; later wounded at Polygon Wood; then wounded on April 17th during an attack; then finally wounded at Peronne. He had been wounded at every major attack committed by the 53rd Battalion with the exceptions of the quiet period at Le Transloy, the battle near Bellicourt and actions on August 8th 1918. He finished the war with 4 wound stripes to his name.\n\nAt wars end, the officers and men of the 53rd Battalion had 1 VC, 5 DSO’s, 24 MCs and 3 bars, 28 DCMs, 76 MMs and 4 bars, 4 MSMs, 20 MiDs per the AWM Of these numbers, atleast 1 DSO, 2 MCs [1 bar], 5 DCMs and 15 MMs [1 bar] are known to have been awarded to the officers and men of ‘D’ Company. The Battalion had also suffered a total of 657 dead- either from Killed in Action, sickness, missing, etc. Of that number, atleast 86 can be accounted for from ‘D’ Company.\n\nHonours known to be awarded to the officers and men of 'D' Company\n\nDistinguished Service Order\n\nLieutenant Reginald Valentine Hill D.S.O, MiD\n\nMilitary Cross\n\nCaptain William Frederic Lindsay M.C\n\nLieutenant William Waite M.C and Bar\n\nDistinguished Conduct Medal\n\nC.Q.M.S Daniel Madden D.C.M\n\nSergeant Charles Smith D.C.M\n\nSergeant Richard Leslie Callaghan D.C.M\n\nCorporal Henry Hubbert D.C.M\n\nCorporal Oscar William Smith D.C.M\n\nMilitary Medal\n\nC.S.M Samuel Frank Cooling M.M\n\nT/C.S.M Cuthbert Claude Lineham M.M\n\nSergeant Jack Everard Burns Croker M.M and Bar\n\nSergeant James Joseph Fox M.M\n\nSergeant Reginald Armand Lyons M.M\n\nSergeant Vincent John Scully M.M\n\nSergeant Richard Quantrill M.M\n\nL/Sergeant James William Haines M.M\n\nCorporal James Henry Harrop M.M\n\nCorporal Charles Taylor M.M\n\nLCpl Amos John Leslie Turner M.M\n\nLCpl Albert Edward Lonsdale Smith M.M\n\nSignaller Arthur John Hopkins M.M\n\nPrivate James Donald Black M.M, MiD\n\nPrivate John Semple M.M\n\nSurvivors of ‘D’ Company\n\nBelow are the names of those who served in the Company throughout the war who survived the war.

Their experience is not exceptional, rather their journey echoes one that most young men had with the Infantry from 1916 onwards. They arrived together in France in early October 1916 as draft replacements, as most men after 1915 did, into a battle proven and bruised Infantry Battalion. My great uncle was amongst these 70 men. At War’s end some twenty-five months later less than a handful would remain. This is their story.\n\nMost of the men came from the towns North of Manchester: Radcliffe, Oldham, Blackpool, Accrington, Burnley and such. A number came from further afield such as Durham, Birmingham, Stoke, Cardiff or the suburbs of Manchester itself. In the main they were Lancashire men. They were labourers, farmers, mill workers, printers, miners, clerks, butchers, a schoolteacher and a solitary glass polisher.\n\nThere is no comprehensive history for these men. I have used their medal roll to identify and confirm them as a group. Surviving service records, Unit war diaries, pension cards, newspaper archives, casualty reports and a variety of archive documents have been considered. There are still gaps. I have attempted to be factual and have tried to avoid any conjecture but in some cases I have made some reasonable assumptions.\n\nTheir shared experience began with Infantry training at Press Health in Shropshire. This was initially with the 21st Reserve Battalion of the Lancashire Fusiliers. Their journeys to basic training were mixed. In the main they appear to have been volunteers but a number comprised some of the first mobilised conscripts of the campaign. Those conscripted were sent direct to the 21st from civilian life.\n\nMany others had volunteered in December 1915 under the Derby Scheme and were mobilised at Preston in May 1916 into the Royal Field Artillery (RFA). A handful of men from the Northeast of England were equally briefly in the RFA but found their Unit transferred to Preston alongside the others and into the 8th Reserve Battery, 2a Reserve Brigade. Other men found themselves conscripted into the RFA equally briefly. After a month or so all the RFA men were sent en-masse on the 17th of June to the Lancashire Fusiliers for Infantry training, at the time the Army needed more infantrymen than gunners so there was little choice or science involved.\n\nFor a few men, their journey was different. One man was a territorial solider who had finished his period of engagement but then was rapidly returned to the Colours via conscription. Other men had volunteered, but following unknown but not unusual delays were conscripted straight into the 21st.\n\nThey were not necessarily all together or in the same training platoons at Press Heath but they would have been going through training at the same time. When they arrived in Shropshire, the battles of 1914 and 1915 were long past. The pre-war regular army was largely gone, the originals very few and the impact of the Battles of the Somme from July 1916 would be being realised whilst they sweated through their four months of Infantry training in Shropshire.\n\nA further administrative change occurred on the 1st of September towards the end of their course when the Army re-organised all the Infantry training units. The bespoke regimental system was deemed too inefficient and more generic Training Reserve Battalions (TRBs) would now be formed. Our men became part of the 72nd TRB. It’s likely they didn’t notice any difference.\n\nPte Tom Cunliffe 27561 from Blackburn almost didn’t get accepted at all as he was just 5ft tall. The Lancashire Fusiliers didn’t want him, but the Army insisted, and he stayed. Pte Robert Collier 27562 from Stockport kept going absent without leave with punishments of increasingly severity. He was absent for 24 days over five occasions. Why he kept receiving leave as he never seemed keen or able to return on time remains unknown. Both would be dead in less than a year. In fact, from surviving service records a theme of men being 24 or 48 hours late back from leave was quite common. They appear to have received pre deployment leave in the middle of September and many took advantage of an extra day or two with family before returning to face a minor punishment. No doubt it was deemed worth the small fine and confinement to barracks give what they knew was coming.\n\nOn Friday 6th October 1916, training complete, they left for France. On the Saturday they arrived at No 30 Infantry Base Depot (IBD) at Etaples. This was the wrong Depot for men joining the Lancashire Fusiliers but the recent reorganisations in the Army meant the rules were changing. At some point back in the UK it had been decided that these men were needed in the 1st Battalion East Lancashire Regiment and as such they would go to 30 IBD for kitting and preparation and not 23 IBD, the Lancashire Fusilier Depo"
