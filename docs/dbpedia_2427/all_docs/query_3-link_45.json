The explosion\n\nof violence in 1993 pitted the mostly Zairian Tutsis and Hutus against other Zairian ethnié·groups in the region, but\n\nthe situation was exacerbated by the arrivai in Goma of some 720,000 largely Hutu refugees from Rwanda after the\n\ngenocide in July 1994.1 The influx of refugees served to reignite the ethnie violence and to break down the HutuTutsi\n\nalliance, leading to attacks against the Tutsi population by both sides. The violence in North Kivu has left\n\nhundreds dead, some 250,000 displaced and approximately 16,000 Tutsis forced to flee as refugees to Rwanda. The\n\ngoal of the attacks is to drive out rival ethnie groups and to create ethnicatly pure enclaves. ·\n\nThis\"report focuses on the violence against Tutsis, which has been particularly severe since late 1995, and\n\nescalated in 1996. Given the recent history of unresolved conflict in the region and the arms flows into the area that\n\naccompanied the refugees, an esèalation of deadly violence in North Kivu was sadly predictable.\n\nThe conflict in North Kivu is complex and involves a series of shifting conflicts among the ethnie groups\n\nand the refugee community. The conflict originally involved the Hutu and Tutsi ethnie groups, known as the\n\n••aanyarwanda,'' who constitute nearly half of the population of North Kivu but have been largely excluded from\n\nregional political office and administrative posts, against the Hund~ Nyanga, and Nandê ethnie groups (autochtones),\n\nwho consider themselves native to the region and have sought to protect their potitical power. Despite the long\n\nhistory of the Banyarwanda in Zaïre, the other groups have accused them ofbeing foreign interlopers, exploiting local\n\npopulations and unworthy of citizenship and political power. Sorne Zairians feared that the Banyarwanda had\n\ndesigns to take over North Kivu, which further increased the animosity toward them.\n\nBeginning in March 1993, Hunde, Nyanga, and Nande militia groups called Mai-Mai or_ Bangirima,2 which\n\napparently had the support of local Zairian political officiais, began to attack the Banyârwânda popuiàtion in several\n\nzones of North Kivu. ln response, the Hutu, who were the main targets of the attacks, formed their own militia.\n\nAttacks and counterattacks by rival ethnie militia continued for nearly six months, leaving approximately 6,000 dead\n\nand displacing an estimated 250,000. Through the action oflocal nongovemmental organizations (NGOs), churches,\n\nand the intervention of the central Zairian govemment, which deployed elite troops in Masisi, a tenuous peace was\n\nrestored to the region in July 1993, and most people were able to retum to their home cÔmmunities. However, none\n\nof the underlying political issues weie resolved, thus setting the stage for the resumption of violence.\n\nTI1e genocide in neighl:ioring Rwanda in 1994 and the subsequent flight of mostly Hutu Rwandan refugees\n\ninto North Kivu fanned interethnic tensions in the region. The Rwandan refugees arrived in Zaire well-anned, and\n\nthey worked to politicize and organize the local Zairian Hutu population,joining together with Zairian Hutu to fonn\n\njoint Interahamwe3 militia groups. The massive inflow of refugees augmented significantly the numeric advantage\n\n1According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), in June 1996 there was a total of 1.1 million\n\nRwandan refugees in Zaire: 716,000 in Goma; 316,400 in Bukavu; and 71,800 in Uvira.\n\n2The tenns \"Bangirima\" and \"Mai-Mai\" both refer to militia èomposed of groups that considered themselves autochthonous\n\nto North Kivu. White the tenns are used to some extentintêrcliangeably bY. the population in the region, \"Mai-Mai\" generally\n\nrefcrs to Hunde and Nyanga militia in Masisi and Walikale, white \"Bangirima\" are Hunde, Nyanga, and Nande militia in Rutshuru\n\nand Lubero.\n\n• . .. •dl!f. • ' •• I •,-... JThe lnterahamwe, which means \"those who attack togetlièr,\" was founded in Rwanda as the youth wing of the National\n\nRwandan Movement for Democracy and Developmënt (MRND), the party.of fonner President Juvenal Habyari~~~a'. Following\n\nthe introduction ofmultiparty politics in mid-1991, the Interahamwe gradually was fransfonned into a civilian militia.\n\nHuman Rights Watch/Africa and FIDH 2 July 1996, Vol. 8, No. 2 (A)\n\nof the Banyarwanda, increasing tensions between the Banyarwanda and other groups. In addition, genocide and\n\nethnie conflict in Rwanda led to a divide within the Banyarwanda community in Zaire between Hutu and Tutsi, a·nd\n\nthousands of Tutsis in Zaire crossed over to Rwanda and Uganda in the months following the end of the genocide:\n\nIn late 1995; the level of violence in North Kivu intensified sharply, following several confrontations in\n\nMasisi between Zairian soldiers and various militia groups. Attacks by rival Interahamwe and Mai-Mai/Bangirima\n\nmilitia quickly spread throughout Masisi and Rutshuru Zones. In contrast to the 1993 conflict, Hutu have had an\n\nupper hand in recent clashes, due to their abundant armaments and extensive militia organization, but Mai-Mai have\n\nalso succeeded in pushing Hutu out of certain areas, particularly in Walikate, Lubero, and Rutshuru. Tutsi, who have\n\nnot been involved in the militia, have been attacked by both Interahamwe and Mai-Mai, and ihousands have been\n\nforced to flee into Rwanda. Violence by various militias in North Kivu has gradually intensified and spread into the\n\nsurrounding zones ofLubero and Walikate.\n\nZairian authorities have shown little interest in ending the violence. On the contrary, testimony from\n\nwitnesses interviewed by Human Rights Watch/Africa and the Fédération Internationale des Ligues des Droits de\n\nl'Homme (FIDH) researchers indicates complicity in the violence against Tutsi on the part of Zairian government\n\nofficiais and military personnel at the local, regional, and national levels. Witnesses report that local Zairian officiais\n\nand soldiers participated in recent militia attacks against Tutsi, and there is ev.idence of official involvement in\n\nattacks by Hutu and Hunde militia since the beginning of the conflict in 1993. National and regional politicians have\n\nbeen unwilling to take steps that might hait the attacks, including publicly denouncing the abuses and supporting a\n\ndisciplined military presence in the region to protect civilians. The few soldiers and police stationed in the area have\n\nthemselves frequently profited from the situation, looting from the various sides and essentially selling their services\n\nto the highest bidder, which has contributed to the climate of impunity. The regional governor fueled the conflict\n\nin 1993 when he suggested that security forces would assist efforts by Nyanga and Hunde to \"exterminate\" the\n\nBanyarwanda.\n\nThe international community has responded to the growing conflict in North Kivu with silence and\n\nindifference. The poor handling of the refugee crisis exacerbated the simmering conflict in North Kivu, with\n\npredictable consequences. Efforts by local and international NGOs to alert the international community about the\n\npotential for renewed violence were ignored. In April 1996, even as killings were taking place on a daily basis and\n\nthousands were being displaced, France announced a resumption ofbilateral aid to the Zairian government:' which\n\nhad been eut off in late 1991.\n\nThe conflict is also increasing tensions between the governments of Rwanda and Zaire, with each side\n\naccusing the other of manipulating the refugee situation in their respective country and with both sides denying\n\ncitizenship to the Tutsi refugees. The Zairian government denies that the Tutsi refugees are Zairian, and\n\nrepresentatives of the government have gQne so far as to deny that Kinyarwanda is even spoken in Zaïre. The\n\nRwanda government contends that the refugees are Zairian citizens fleeing violence, and established a refugee camp\n\nin Gisenyi, about a kilometer away from the border. Despite appeals by the United Nations High Commissioner for\n\nRefugees (UNHCR) that the camp be moved away from the border, the govemment has refused. Clearly, the presence\n\nof refugee camps so close to both side~ of the border poses serious security risks for the refugees and for their hast\n\ncountries. If the conflict continues to escalate, bath Zaire and the Great Lakes region in general cou Id face further\n\ndisastrous consequences.\n\n4françois Raitberger, \"Mobutu hails 'courageous; French Aid to Zaïre,\" Reuters, April 26, 1996.\n\nHuman Rights Watch(Africa and FIDH 3 July 1996, Vol. 8, No. 2 (A)\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nTo the International Community:\n\n• · Hold the Zairian government accountable for the actions against the Tutsi population in North Kivu and other\n\nattacks against civilians. The government must be urged to launch an immediate investigation into the\n\ncomplicity of its military and civilian personnel in the attacks, and to prosecute those responsible.\n\n• Encourage the peaceful and voluntary repatriation of Rwandan refugees from Zaire. The international\n\nc-0mmunity should provide the means necessary to isolate the camps to prevent further infiltration of ex-FAR\n\nand Rwandari Interahamwe into North Kivu. and to ensure that Zairian soldiers involved in abuses against\n\nrefugees be prosecuted.\n\n• Pressure the Rwàndan govemment to improve its human rights record and to create a climate conducive to\n\nthe return ofRwandan refugees. Provide adequate support for the Rwandanjudicial system and urge the\n\nR wandan government to begin free and fair trials for those accused of involvement-in the I 994 genocide,\n\nso that refugees currently in Zaïre can be guaranteed just treatment upon their return to Rwanda.\n\n• Monitor the conduct of Zairian forces involved in Operation Kimia toward the civilian population to ensure\n\nthat civilians from ail ethnie groups are protected and that ail militia are disarmed.\n\n• Deploy international monitors at airports and border crossings in eastern Zaïre to enforce the UN arms\n\nembargo against the formër Rwandan military and militia.\n\n• Support the establishment of a UN commission of inquiry into the abuses against civilians in North Kivu.\n\n• Ensure that no bilateral or multilateral assistance, other than humanitarian aid, is provided to· the Zairian\n\ngovernment unless it ends ail support to the militias operating in Zaire, investigates and prosecutes soldiers\n\nresponsible for abuses against civilians, and complies with Security Council Resolution 978 calling on\n\nmember states to arrest persans suspected of participating in the genocide in Rwanda for prosecution in\n\nnational courts or by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.\n\nTo the Governmeot of Zaïre:\n\n• Immediately cease ail support for Mai-Mai, Bangirima, Interahamwe, and any other militia with a record\n\nof gross human rights abuses. This should include an end to the provision of armaments and logistical\n\nassistance, participation by government officers and military personnel in militia attacks, and public\n\npronouncements of support for the militia by military and political officiais.\n\n• Leaders at all levels of government -national, regional, and local- should publicly denounce the ethnie\n\nviolence in North Kivu. lnvestigate and identify those political, administrative, and military officiais who\n\nhave participated in militia attacks or profited from the insecurity to pillage or rape, and immediately remove\n\nthem from their posts and begin prosecution.\n\n• The right to nationality must be respected. The government of Zaïre must cease denationalizating those\n\nmembers of the Banyarwanda community who qualify for Zairian citizenship; no one should be rendered\n\nstateless.\n\n• The Zairian government must support efforts to encourage the peaceful and voluntary repatriation of\n\nRwandan refugees in Zaïre. Ail assistance to the former Rwandan government, ex-Forces Armées\n\nRwandaises, and Hutu militia mÙst be stopped; in particular, the provision of arms and related training and\n\nmaterials in violation o(the United Nations embargo against these forces.\n\n• The Zairian government must cooperate with the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and bring\n\nperpetrators of the 1994 genocide to justice, including turning over indicted suspects to the International\n\nTribunal. ·\n\n• Ensure security to allow the safe return of Zairian Tutsi refugees from Rwanda .\n\n• Allow access throughout North Kivu for local and internationaljournalists and other independent observers .\n\nTo the Govcrnment of-Rwanda:\n\n• Create conditions within Rwanda that would favor the peaceful and voluntary return of refugees from Zaire,\n\nincluding respecting rights to freedom of expression, movement, and assembly regardless of ethnicity and\n\nHuman Rights Watch/Africa and FIDH 4 July 1996, Vol. 8, No. 2 (A)\n\n•\n\nbeginning trials for those currently imprisoned in Rwanda under accusations of participation in the 1994\n\ngenocide.\n\nProvide safe and secure haven for refugees from the conflict in Zaïre. Locate the refugee camp a sufficient\n\ndistance from the Zaïre border that refugees will not be exposed to the threàt of attack from zàire. The\n\ncurrent site, 800 meters from the Zairian border, places the refugees at risk.\n\nEstablish screening procedures in the refugee camp to determine if the Tutsis from .Zaïre qualify as refugees .\n\nORIGINS OF THE BANYARW ANDA COMMUNITY IN ZAIRE\n\nThe region of North Kivu lies on the northe~ shores of Lake Kivu, along Zaire's eastern border with Rwanda\n\nand Uganda. The Region is divided into six administrative zones: Masisi, Rutshuru, Kalehe, Walikale, Lubero, and\n\nGorria,5 it contains a diverse ethnie mix of Hunde, Nan de, Nyanga, and Tembo, as well as the Kinyarwanda-speaking\n\nHutu and Tutsi, together known as Banyarwanda. The Banyarwanda made up roughly 50 percent of the population\n\nin North Kivu (though they constitute the majority in certain regions), with the Hutu comprising about 40 percent\n\nand the Tutsi about 10 percent.\n\nThe origins of the Banyarwanda population in North Kivu are diverse. The arbitrary establishment of\n\ncolonial boundaries placed a large population of people formerly subject to the Rwandan king outside Rwandan\n\nterritory.6 The capricious manner in which the European colonial powers carved up the African continent placed\n\nseveral regions formerly connected to the pre-colonial Rwandan kingdom within the boundaries of the Belgian\n\nCongo. Under the principles set down in the 1885 Conference of Berlin and formalized in a convention signed in\n\n1910 between Germany, Belgium, and England, the Rwandan territories ofGoma, Jomba, Bwisha, and the Island\n\nof ldjwi, among others, were attached to the Belgian Congo, while the region of Bufumbira was integrated into the\n\nBritish colony of Uganda. Accordingly, some of the Banyarwanda descend from families that have lived for\n\ncenturies on land which today lies within Zaïre.\n\nWhen Belgium assumed control of Rwanda from German y during the First World War, Rwanda was already\n\n·a densely populated territory. Belgian colonial administrators established a policy encouraging Rwandans to\n\nemigrate into Zaïre to supply labor for plantations that were being establishe~ in the lightly populated district of\n\nMasisi. Administrators in Kivu and Rwanda signed a formai agreement in 1937 organizing the migration and\n\ncreating Rwandan areas within Masisi. Other Rwandans were brought in as laborers in Kalehe, Rutshuru, and Shaba.\n\nIn addition to the formai program of tabor migration, which continued until 1955, many H;utu and Tutsi -both from\n\nRwanda and from Jomba and other territories within Zaïre- independ~ntly migrated into the districts ofMasisi,\n\nWalikale, Rutshuru, and Lubero seeking land for cultivation or for grazing goats and cattle.7\n\n•\n\nIn addition to economic migrants, North Kivu has welcomed thousands of poli.tical refugees fleeing conflicts\n\nin Rwanda. After the uprising against Tutsi colonial administrators in Rwanda in 1959, thousands of Tutsi fled into\n\nZaïre. Thousands more Tutsi arrived in Zaire during repeated outbreaks of ethnie violence in Rwanda in the eariy\n\n5Each zone within the region is sub-divided into several collectivities, anq these collectivities are themselves sub-divided into\n\nlocalities and groupements.\n\n6Aloys Tegera, \"La réconciliation commu~;utaire: Le cas des massacres au Nord-Kivu,\" in A~dre Guich~oua, editor:ï.~s ·\n\ncrises politiques au B11run_di et au Rwanda (/993-1994) (Université des Sciences et Technologies de Lille, 1995), pp. 395-402;\n\nUNHCR, \"La sitμations dans le Masisi et les propositions de la Sous-Délégation,\" March 18, 1996.\n\n'Tegera, \"La réconciliation communautaire,\" p. 396; UNHCR, \"La situation dans le Masisi.\" March 1996.\n\nHuman Rights Watch/Africa and FIDH 5 July 1996, Vol. 8, No. 2 (A)\n\n1960s, in 1973, and again in the early 1990s.• Finally, in 1994 nearly one million mostly Hutu refugees fled into\n\nNorth Kivu at the end of the genocide and in advance of the Rwandan Patriotic Front taking power in Rwanda. White\n\nthe majority of these recent refugees has been housed in refugee camps, others have settled outs ide the camps in the\n\nzones of Goma, Masisi, Rutshuru, and Kalehe and have integrated into existing Hutu communities.9 The villages\n\nin North_ Kivu were frequently multiethnic, and these Hutu communities are often found within villages consisting\n\nof other ethnie groups.\n\nBorder changes, economic migration, and political conflict have combined to make Banyarwanda the largest\n\ngroup in North Kivu and a sizable majority of the population in certain areas of the region. Of the estimated 600,000\n\npeople living in Masisi zone before interethnic violence broke out in 1993, 75-80 percent were Banyarwanda, while\n\nthe remaining 20-25 percent were primarily Hunde, along with some Nyanga and Tembo. Banyarwanda were also\n\nthe majority iri parts of Bwito and Bwisha collectivities in Rutshuru zone, and they were the largest group in Goma.10\n\nSOURCES OF CONFLICT\n\nLand distribution and economic competition have been at the root of conflicts between the Banyarwanda and\n\nother groups looking for political power. In general, th~ Tutsi have cleared large tracts of land in the region to use\n\nas pasturage for grazing their cattle and goats, white the Hutu predominantly cleared land for fanning. As the\n\nBanyarwanda population has increased, particularly following the arrivai of many Tutsi refugees front Rwanda\n\nbeginning in 1959, they have gradually migrated further and further from the Rwanda border. In Walikale, Masisi,\n\nand other districts, the Banyarwanda have cleared large areas of forest to use for farming and grazing, Ieading to\n\nconflicts with the local Hunde population who have traditionally used the forests for hunting game. The\n\nBanyarwanda have been quite successful in the regional and national economies, supplying livestock and produce\n\nto markets as far away as the Zairian capital Kinshasa. The relative prosperity of the Banyarwanda has contributed\n\nto resentment by other groups in the region.11 Despite their numeric significance and long history in North Kivu, the\n\nBanyarwanda have enjoyed little politieal power, at least in terms of formai politieal and administrative positions.\n\nResidents of North Kivu have disagreed about the treatment of the Banyarwanda in Zaire. The Banyarwanda\n\nbelieve that they have been discriminated against in terms of employment and education. However, other Zairian\n\ngroups contend that the Banyarwanda have had advantages over other Zairians, including disproportionate access\n\nto higher edueation in Zaïre. The perception on both sides of the conflict that the other has been privileged bas clearly\n\nfueled resentments and increased tensions between the communities. · ·\n\nAnother key issue in the conflict involves nationality, which was recognized and later taken away from the\n\nBanyarwanda. Other ethnie groups in Kivu have justified their political dominance by arguing that the Banyarwanda\n\nare foreigners who have no claim to Zairian citizenship. In practice, members of other ethnie groups make no\n\ndistinction between those Banyarwanda whose families lived on Zairian territory prior to colonial boundary changes\n\nand those whose families migrated into the area more recently. It is important to note that the nationality issue has\n\nbeen used only against'the Banyarwanda. and not against other ethnie groups that were divided along Zaire's borders\n\nat independence.\n\n,;.Masisi ou la guerre oubliée,\" ANB·BIA Supplement, p. viii; Tegera, \"~ réconciliation communautaire,\" p. 397.\n\n9\"Masisi ou la guerre ou.bliée,\" p. viii; UNHCR, \"Repatriation·ofRw~ndan Refugees from Eastern Zaire,\" ~arch 1996.\n\n1°Tegera. \"La réconciliation communautaire,\" pp. 398-399; UNHCR, \"Repatriation ofRwandan Refugees from Eastern Zaïre.\"\n\n11 Marc Hoogesteyn, \"Anned Rwanda Hutus uproot spear•carrying tribesmen,\" Reuters, February 21, 1996; Tegera, \"La\n\nréconciliation communautaire,'' p. 399; and Human Rights Watch/FJDH interviews with Zairian refugees in Rwanda, April 1996.\n\nHuman Rights Watch/Africa and FIDH 6 July 1996, Vol. 8, No. 2 (A)\n\nThe issue of nationality has been a recurrent source of contention in Eastern Zaïre, especially relating to voter\n\neligibility in electoral periods. After Zaïre gained independence in 1960, a nationality law granted Zairian citizenship\n\nfor anyone who had been living in Zaïre for ten years. Although most Banyarwanda quatified for citizenship under\n\nthese terms, provincial authorities in North Kivu excluded them from civil service posts in the early 1960s. A 1972\n\nlaw adopted as part of President Mobutu's \"authenticity\" program reiterated the principles of the earlier nationality\n\nJaw, granting Zairian citizenship to anyone whose family was living in Zaïre on January 1, 1960, and had since\n\nmaintained continuous residence.12 In Article 15, nationality was specificalty granted to people from \"RuandaUrundi\"\n\nwho were on Zairian (Congolese) territory before January 1, 1950 and continued to reside in Zaïre. No\n\ndistinction was made between Banyarwanda who had lived in Zaïre for generations and those who had arrived as\n\npolitical refugees or economic migrants in later years.\n\nThe nationality issue came to the fore again in 1981 when the Zairian parliament approved a revision to\n\ncitizenship laws that accorded citizenship onJy to those who could demonstrate that their ancestors lived in Z~ire\n\nprior to August 1, 1885. Although many Banyarwanda qualified for citizenship under these new ru les, ancestry was\n\ndifficult to demonstrate, and in practice both the non-Banyarwanda public and the govemment tended to treat\n\nBanyarwanda as a single group. The law did not specifically state that citizenship would be revoked from those who\n\nhad already acquired it; nevertheless, the effect of the law was to deny citizenship rights to a substantial portion of\n\nZairian Kinyarwanda-speakers and practicalty denied rights to most others.13 The nationality issue was summarized\n\nin a report by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on human rights in Zaïre as folJows:\n\nThe tensions [in North Kivu] are caused by two retated probtems. The first arises from the right of\n\nthe Banyarwanda to Zairian nationality. This was recognized in the 1964 Constitution and in the\n\nlaw of 1965, which allowed them to vote in 1965 and 1967; it was left unchanged in the 1967\n\nConstitution, and confirmed once again by Decree Law No. 71-020 of 1971; then it was restricted\n\nunder Law No. 002 of 1972 to those living in Kivu since before 1960, abolished by law in 1981 t!nd\n\ntaken over by the CNS [Sovereign National Conference] in 1992. The second problems is derived\n\nfrom the first, namely that recognizing the Banyarwanda as Zairians would give them the right to\n\nvote in any elections which might be held.14\n\nIn practice, however, the 1981 Jaw was never active)y enforced, and identity cards were never revoked. After\n\nofficially enjôying the rights of citizenship for two decades, the Banyarwanda did not passively accept the revocation\n\noftheir nationality. In the mid-1980s, Hutu from throughout North Kivu fonned an ethnie organization, known as\n\na \"mutual,\" to unite Hutu and defend their interests. Initially an agricultural association, MAGRIVI, the Agricultural\n\nMutual ofVirunga, gradually became politicized. In 1991, when Banyarwanda were excJuded from participation\n\nin the national conference held in Kinshasa to debate the political future of the country, organizers of MAGRIVI urged\n\nHutu in North Kivu to protest by rejecting the authority oflocal Hunde chiefs and refusing to pay taxes, a particularly\n\nserious threat given the economic importance of the Banyarwanda.'s\n\n12Jean-Baptiste Kayigamba, \"Zaire-Human Rights: Thousands Flee Ethnie Cleansing,\" lnterPress Service, April 7, 1996; U.S.\n\nCommittee for Refugees (USCR), \"lnducing the Deluge,\" p. 9.\n\n13See \"Ordonnance-Loi No 71-020 due 26 mars 1971 relative à l'acquisition de la nationalité congolaise par les personnes\n\noriginaires du Rwanda-Urundi établies au Congo au 30 juin 1960,\" and ''{.oi No 81-002 du 29 juin 1982.n Also see: UNHCR.\n\n\"Repatriation ofRwandan Refugees from Eastern Zaire;\" USCR, \"Inducing the Deluge,11 pp. 8-9.\n\n14United Nations Commission on Human Rights, \"Report on the situation of human rights in Zaïre, prepared by the Special\n\nRapporteur, Mr. Roberto <;,arret6n, in accordance- wtih Commission resolution 1995/69,\" E/CN.4/1996/66, 29 January 1996, p.10-\n\n11.\n\n15Kayigamba, \"Zaire-Human Rights.\"\n\nHuman Rights Watch/Africa and FIDH 7 July 1996, Vol. 8, No. 2 (A)\n\nTHE OUTBREAK OF VIOLENCE\n\nWith democratic elections becoming an increasingly imminent possibility in the early 1990s, the growing\n\npolitical organization of the Hutu posed a serious threat to the political power ofHunde, Nande, and other ethnie\n\ngroups. Given the numerical majority of Banyarwanda, members of other groups would have difficulty retaining\n\nthe chieftaincies and other political positions, and their associated prerogatives, ifBanyarwanda were allowed to vote.\n\nTI1e threat of losing power in elections was particularly serious for Nyanga and Hunde, who compriseà _:,nly 4 and\n\n3 percent, respectively, of the population of the region of North Kivu as a whole.16 Local authorities th\\,;S !aunchic:~\n\na program in 1991 to identify and register Zairian nationals, a process that sought to exclude most Banyarwanda, and\n\nmake them ineligible to vote in future elections.17\n\nPolitical conflicts combined with continuing clashes over land use to create a highly volatile situation in\n\nNorth Kivu. Tensions in the region came to a peak in March I 993 when the then govemor of North Kivu, Jean-Pierre\n\nKalumbo Mboho, publicly questioned the nationality of Banyarwanda and suggested that the security forces would\n\nassist efforts by Nyanga and Hunde to \"exterminate\" Banyarwanda. The govemor was suspended in late July I 993.18\n\nAttacks by Mai-Mai militia in Masisi and Walikale zones and Bangirima in Rutshuru and Lubero zones\n\napparently began several days after the governor's comments. Hutu protests over the arrest of a MAGRIVI leader\n\n.seem to have been the spark that ignited the violence. On March 20, Mai-Mai attacked Banyarwanda at Ntoto market\n\nin Walikale, after Banyarwanda raised a political party flag that other groups erroneously claimed was the flag of\n\na foreign government. By the next day, violence had spread throughout Walikale and Masisi zones.19\n\nThe U.S. Committee for Refugees reported that 1,000 people are estimated to have been killed injust the first\n\ntwo days of fighting. By April, attacks against Banyarwanda had spread into Lubero and Rutshuru zones. With\n\nanned support from local gendarmes, Mai-Mai and Bangirima militia attacked Hutu and Tutsi with guns, machetes\n\nand spears and bumed hundreds of homes. After several months of such attacks, some Banyarwanda, primarily Hutu\n\nwho could build on the existing MAGRJVI organization, formed their own militia groups to counter-attack, killing\n\nHunde and Nyanga and buming their homes.20\n\nViolence by ail sides in North Kivu continued from March until July 1993. Official Zairian govemment\n\nstatistics estimated that 6,000 people were killed during the six months of the conflict, but estimates of the number\n\nof dead by OXFAM, Medecins Sans Frontieres, Caritas, and other in~ependent observers range from 7,000 and to as\n\nhigh as 40,000, the large majority being Hutu. The UNHCR est.imated that 350,000 people were displaced by the\n\nviolence.21 The fighting started a process of ethnie pogroms and clearances in which members of the dominant ethnie\n\n16Tegera, \"La réconciliation communautaire,\" p. 399.\n\n17USCR, \"lnducing the Deluge,\" pp. 9-10:· .\n\n11Amnesty International, \"Zaïre: Violence Against Democracy,\" September 16, 1993, p. 22 and \"Masisi ou la guerre oubliée,\"\n\np. viii. ·\n\n''Raymond Luaula, \"Leur nationalité zaîroise ne se marchande pas!,\" Umo/a (Kinshasa), February 28, 1996, p. 2; \"Masisi ou\n\nJa guerre oublié;\" p. vii; Tegera,''La réconciliation communautaire,\" pp. 395-396; USCR, \"Inducing the Deluge,\" p. 10.\n\n20\"MasisÎ ou la guerre oubliée,\" pp. vii-viii; Tegera, \"La réconciliation c~~in~nautaire,\" pp. 395-396; USCR, \"Inducing the\n\nDeluge.\"\n\n21\"Masisi ou la guerre oubliée,\" p. vii; Hugh Nevill, \"Explosive ~ix crackting in Eastern Zaire,\" Agence France Presse.\n\nOctober 18, 1994; UNHCR, \"Repatriation of Rwandan Refugees from Eastern Zaire\"; Kayigamba, \"Zaire-Human Rights.11\n\nHuman Rights Watch/Africa and FIDH 8 July 1996, Vol. 8, l'.'Jo. 2 {A)\n\ngroup in each area drove out members of minority ethnie groups.

The violence in\n\n1993 began a process of establishing ethnie enclaves where ethnie groups had formerly lived together in multiethnic\n\ncommunities. Communities that had formerly included Hutu, Tutsi, and Hunde, now became almost exclusively\n\nHutu or exclusively Hunde.22\n\nThe position of Tutsi in this conflict varied from one area to the next. ln some areas, they were lumped\n\ntogether with the Hutu as a single Banyarwanda population and thus were targeted. ln o~er areas, because they were\n\nnot organized politically, they were not considered threatening and were left untouched. According to Emmanuel,\n\na Munyarwanda from Walikale, \"In Masisi ... sometimes the Hunde killed Tutsi, sometimes Hutu killed Tutsi. In\n\nIkobo, the Hunde left the Tutsi atone. In Kisimba, Hunde chased out both Hutu and Tutsi. And in Bwito, Hutu\n\nchased out the Hunde, and the Tutsi stayed.\"23 According to other sources, in some areas ofMasisi and Rutshuru,\n\nHutu and Tutsi joined together to fight against the Hunde and other groups.2\n\n'\n\nAlthough the Mai-Mai and Bangirima were civilian militla composed primarily of youths, both local\n\nwitnesses and international observers agree that they were acting with the approval and encouragement of local\n\n·Hunde and Nande govemment officiais. According to ~girabakunzi, a Tutsi from Lubero zone:\n\nThe traditional chiefs, the baami, said that the Hutu were chased out [of Lubero and Walikale]\n\nbecause of MAGRIVI. There was much hatred against the Hutu mutual association MAGRlVI. This\n\norganization had entered into potitics and was trying to have its own chiefs. Because ofthis, there\n\nwas a big conflict between the chiefs, who were Nande and Hunde, and the Hutu. The Hutu were\n\nchased by groups of bandits who were not afraid of shedding blood. But the chiefs were behind\n\nthem. They were supported by the chiefs. After they were done, there was not a single Hutu left in\n\nour area. But we Tutsi did not have any problems. The chiefs told us that they had no problems\n\nwith the Tutsi, because we did not have a mutual association.\"\n\nThe role of the Zairian military and security forces in the 1993 conflict is unclear. Sorne witnesses claim\n\nthat members of the Forces Armées Zaïroises (F AZ) joined with the Bangirima in attacking Banyarwanda. Sorne\n\nHunde claim that FAZ soldiers were offering special protection to the Banyarwanda, who, unlike the Hunde, could\n\nafford to pay for the service. Reports from several organizations of the Catholic Church contend that gendarmes\n\noffered extensive support to the Mai-Mai for its attacks. Numerous accounts make clear that in many cases rather\n\nthan intervening to calm the situation, soldiers took advantage of the insecurity to loot from bath sides in the\n\nconflict.16 What is clear, however, is that the govemment threatened to strip the Kinyarwanda-speaking population\n\nof its Zairian nationality and so to marginalize it from political life, a goal shared with those attacking them. At the\n\nsame time, the governor had openly expressed support for their \"extermination/'\n\n22La commission justice et paix/Diocese de Goma, \"Masisi: ·zone devastée, victime de sa richesse, du tribalisme ou du\n\npouvoir, Mondé Nouveau (Goma), November-December 1995; USCR. \"lnducing the Deluge\"; and testimonies taken by Human\n\nRights Watch/FIDH from Zairean refugees.\n\n23Human Rights Watch/FIDH interview, Gisenyi, Rwanda, April 17, 1996.\n\n24Kayigamba, \"Zaire-Human Rights.\"\n\ni~Human Rights Watch/FIDH interview, Nkamira Transit Camp, Rwanda, April 5, 1996.\n\n26USCR, \"Inducing the _De luge,\" p. 1 O; \"Masisi ou la guerre oubliée,\" p. viii.\n\nHuman Rights Watch/Africa and FIDH 9 July 1996, Vol. 8, No. 2 (A)\n\nThe violence continued in North Kivu with varying degrees of intensity until July 1993, when a group of\n\nchurches and local non-govemmental organizations (NGOs) brought members of the warring groups together in ar\n\neffort to ease tensions in the region. The meetings concluded that the conflict had been manipulated by Zairian\n\npoliticians, but failed to resolve the underlying issues. Also in July, President Mobutu visited Goma and\n\nsul>sequently deployed troops from the Special Presidential Division (DSP), the country'~ most elite military division.\n\nThe DsP did not overtly take sides, but rather helped to prevent fighting and to bring some order to the area.27\n\nHowever, the key issues of nationality, land distribution, and political representation had not been resolved, and\n\ngovernment officiais at both the provincial and national levels showed no interest in seeking a lasting resolution.\n\nSevera( meetings sponsored by OXFAM, church groups, and other local NGOS brought together members ofvarious\n\nethnie groups in early 1994. The meetings produced proposais for bringing a lasting peace to the region --chief\n\namong them a resolution to the nationality issue-- but the proposais received no response frcim government officiais.\n\nWith tensions still high and tens of thousands of people still displaced from their homes, conrutions were ripe for\n\nrenewed conflict. 21\n\nGENOCIDE IN RWANDA AND ETHNIC CONFLICT IN ZAIRE\n\nThe spark that reignited ethnie violence in North Kivu was the genocide set into motion in Rwanda after the\n\nairplane crash that killed the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi in April 1994, and the renewed fighting between the\n\nRPF and Rwandan govemment forces. When word began to filter into Zaïre about the massacres taking place in\n\nRwanda, sharp divisions developed between the Tutsi and Hutu communities in Zaïre. Reportsïndicate that a few\n\nHutu attacks against Tutsi in Zaïre took place as early as May of 1'994, but violence against Tutsi becarne much more\n\nwidespread after the arrivai in North Kivu of an estimated 720,000 Hutu refugees from Rwanda in July. The majority\n\nofthese refugees, many of whom were involved in massacres of Tutsi in Rwanda, settled in refugee camps around\n\nGoma, but others integrated into local Hutu communities in Goma, Rutshuru, Kalehe, and Masisi.29\n\nWitnesses report that Interahamwe militia continued their violence against Tutsi after their arrivai in Zaïre\n\nand the first attacks by Interahamwe against Tutsi in Zaire took place the last week of July 1994. Semasaka, a Tutsi\n\nwho was living in the town of Sake in southem Masisi, recounts the attack on bis family in August 1994:\n\nThe Hutu refugees fleeing Rwanda came to Masisi in July 1994. They tried to stay in groups\n\ntogether. They wanted to continue what they had started in Rwanda. The Hutu who came from\n\nRwanda held secret meetings at night with the Hutu from Zaïre, and the Zairian Hutu began to (onn ..\n\nInterahamwe together with the Rwandan Hutu. They began to steal cows, to take Tutsi women by\n\nforce. They began to kill and pillage and rape, just as they had done in Rwanda ... The area is vast\n\nthere, and there were many cows, so it was a good place for us. But you can't stay in a place where\n\nthey are killing you.\n\nMy family was attacked by Rwandan military [ex-FAR, Forces Armées Rwandaises]. I was atour\n\nhome at Centre Sake with my mother and father and six children. A large group attacked. They\n\nwere wearing R wandao military unifonns.

My family had been there in Masisi since\n\n1959.30\n\nThe anti-Tutsi violence in Masisi and Rutshuru zones continued for several months, reaching a peak in\n\nSeptember, then diminishing in October. The Zairian army sent approximately one hundred troops to Masisi in\n\nOctober to reinforce the military presence in the region, but according to reports from the area, the military often\n\njoined in the looting and killing. The violence drave many Rwandan Tutsi refugees, like Semasaka, whose families\n\nhad been in Zaire for decades, to flee to Rwanda, where a govemment installed by the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan\n\nPatriotic Front (RPF) had taken power.\"\n\nEven after this wave of violence diminished, tensions in North Kivu remained high. The arrivai in the region\n\nof the Hutu refugees intensified anti-Banyarwanda sentiment among other groups in North Kivu. The new refugees\n\nthemselves were a highly potiticized group who, according to many sources, worked to politicize local Hutu.\n\nNumerous witnesses interviewed by Hum an Rights Watch/ Africa and FIDH reported that Hutu refugees from Rwanda\n\nintegrated into Zairian Hutu communities. Sorne reports indicate that they gave militia training to local Hutu, similar\n\nto the training given to Interahamwe in Rwanda before the genocide.32 The Hutu community in Zaïre thus became\n\nincreasingly well organized and increasingly well armed, due to the massive quantities ofweapons brought by the\n\nrefugees and the Rwandan army fleeîng the RPF, or flown into Goma afterwards as the routed army regrouped.u\n\nThe additional F AZ troop reinforcements that the govemment in Kinshasa sent to Masisi and other parts of\n\nNorth Kivu in 1994 in response to the influx ofRwandan refugees and renewed tensions seems to have contributed\n\nto the insecurity. Rather than sending the more disciplined DSP, the govemment sent a regiment known as the\n\nParachute Commandos or \"Paras,\" who were underpaid and undisciplined, and began to prey on the population.\n\nThe Paras demanded bribes, pillaged, and, according to various reports, chose sides and participated in the\n\nlocal conflict. Nzamwitakuze, a Tutsi refuge from Bahunde collectivity in Masisi, explained. \"The govemment\n\nplaced soldiers around, but the. soldîers themselves just came to attack and pillage goods.11\n\n,.\n\nIn May and June of 1995, the ethnie militia, known collectively as the \"combatants,11 (abacombattant)\n\nlaunched renewed attacks.35 The Mai-Mai and Bangirima groups ofHunde, Nande, and Nyanga fought with Hutu\n\n30Human Rights Watch/FIDH Interview, Gisenyi, April 6, 1996.\n\n11La commission justice et paix, \"Masisi: Zone devastée,\" pp. 12-13; Nevill, \"Explosive mix crackling in Eastern Zaïre''; and\n\nHuman Rights Watch/FJDH interviews, Gisenyi and Nkamira, April 1996.\n\n321n late 1993 and early 1994, pararnilitary training was given to Interahamwe members, including instructions on how to Joad\n\nand tire a gun.

As mentioned above, \"Mai-Mai\" and \"Bangïrima\" are used to some extent\n\nïnterchangeably, but they also have a regional basis. The tenn \"combatants,\" (abacombattant) is used by some people in the area\n\nto refer to ail ethnie militia but the tenn is used by others to refer to the Hutu mititia. The term \"lnterahamwe\" is used by some\n\nto refer to ail Hutu militia and by others exclusively to refer to Hutu militia from Rwanda. Given the mixing of Zairian and\n\nHuman Rights Watch/Africa and FIDH 11 July 1996, Vol. 8, No. 2 (A)\n\nInterahamwe militia in Masisi and Rutshuru. Both sides attacked villages, pillaging and buming homes, displacing\n\nthousands of people and furthering the process of establishing ethnie enclaves. At this time, Tutsi families, both\n\nZairian nationals and refugèes from Rwanda's ethnie conflicts in the 1960s and 1970s, were ·targeted by both groups.\n\nAccording to Livania, a young woman from Bishusha in Rutshuru zone:\n\nBefore the arrivai of the Interahamwe, there were no problems for Tutsi in our area. After the\n\nInterahamwe came, problems started with the Bahunde. The Bahunde said, \"What are you doing\n\nstill here when others are returning to their country?\"\n\nThe signais of trouble began in May [1995]. The combatants came little by little, pillaging. The\n\nHunde pillaged at one bouse and then another. They came in groups of more or less ten people,\n\npillaging here and there. Things became really hot in June, when there was a great number of homes\n\npillaged. These groups, though, came only to pillage. No one was killed or hurt. The killing in our\n\narea bas just started now .... The Hunde began to pillage the abjects from the bouse and cattle. Tuen\n\nthe Interahamwe followed after with threatening comments. These attacks in our community took\n\nplace during one week [in June 1995). The Hunde came several times and attacked. They took\n\nthings, then left. Tuen the Interahamwe would corne around and tell us to leave. They did not\n\nattack, but they came by to threaten us.36\n\nAs with the attacks in July and August 1994, these renewed assaults encouraged many ofthose Rwandan\n\nTutsi families who had been living for decades as refugees in Zaire to retum to Rwanda. While some Tutsi would\n\ncertainly have chosen voluntarily to retum to Rwanda following the victory of the RPF, the violence carried out by\n\nthe Interahamwe and Mai-Mai forced many Tutsi to leave Zaïre against their will. Through pillaging, these Tutsi\n\nfamilies lost their livestock and their household goods, and in fleeing they lost their land. According to UNHCR,\n\n38,000 Tutsi retumed to Rwanda from Zaïre in 1995. According to various reports, rather than calming the situation,\n\nthe Zairian military participated in the pillaging. Nevertheless, by July 1995 the fighting and attacks had again\n\ntapered off.37 •\n\nTHE CURRENT CONFLICT\n\nWhite the potential for an escalation of fighting in North Kivu was quite high, when fighting broke out in\n\nJuly 1994 and May 1995, the Zairian govemment made no concerted effort to intervene to establish order and protect\n\ncivilians. In fact, the Zairian govemment was complicit in the distribution of arms to the former Rwandan military\n\nand militia. Throughout the refugec crisis, the Zairian govemment bas supported the former Rwandan authorities and\n\nfacilitated the training and arming of its troops and militia in the refugee camps. The govemment bas allowed its\n\nterritory to be used as a conduit for weapons supplies to the ex-FAR, and cargo companies based in Zaire have acted\n\nunder contracts with Zairian officiais to transport these weapons.31 The vast increase in arms flows to the region has\n\nbeen a key factor in exacerbating the conflict in North Kivu, and helped set the stage for a renewal of interethnic\n\nfighting and killing in Kivu. The situation is further complicated by the fact that the Zairian security forces stationed\n\nRwandan Hutu in the militia, the term \"Interahamwe\" is used in this report tp refer to all Hutu militia.\n\n16Interviewed in Nkamira commercial center, April 16, 1996.\n\n37UNDHA, \"Situation Report on Masisi and R.~tshuru\"; UNHCR, \"Situation dans le Masisi.\"\n\n\"Human Rights Watch Arms Project, \"Reanning with Jmpunity: International Support for the for the Perpetrators of the\n\nRwandan Genocide\"; UNHCR, \"Situation dans le Masisi.\"\n\nHuman Rights Watch/Africa and FIDH 12 July 1996, Vol. 8, No. 2 (A)\n\nin North Kivu are poorly equipped, paid and disciplined, which creates a situation where they may sell their services\n\nto the highest bidder and foot from ail sides.\n\nBecause of the fighting, communities in Masisi and Rutshuru that formerly enjoyed ethnie diversity have\n\nbecome increasingly monoethnic as the dominate ethnie group in each community forces others to flee. Villages in\n\nthe area are increasingly identified ~s \"Hutu\" or 11Hunde11 or ''Nande.\" As such, they become the targets of the militia\n\nfrom rival groups. Since December 1995, thousands of.Hunde and Nyanga have fled from Masisi to Kisimba and\n\nlkobo areas in Walikale, while others have fled to Goma and parts ofRutshuru. Mai-Mai have also driven Hutu out\n\nof certain areas, particular~y in Rutshuru and at the extremities of Masisi. In February J 996, the International\n\nCommittee of the Red Cross estimated that 150,000 people from Masisi had been displaced since November 1995.39\n\nBy mid-May, Doetors Without Borders USA estimated that the number of displaced had risen to 250,000.4°\n\nThe latest round of interethnic violence began in southem and eastem parts of the Masisi zone in November\n\n1995. Several factors contributed to rising tensions in the region that set the stage for renewed violence. Threats\n\nby President Mobutu and other members of the Zairian govemment to close the Rwandan refugees camps by the end\n\nof December seem to have increased the anxiety ofRwandan Hutu refugees, many of whom believed that they would\n\nbe arrested or killed ifthey were forced to retum to Rwanda. Hutu.leaders in the camps began to talk ofMasisi as\n\na \"Hutu-land,\" where Rwandan Hutu could settle as an alternative to retuming to Rwanda, which had become a\n\n'1Tutsi-land.11 These claims infuriated the area's Hunde, Nyang~ and Tembo, who view Masisi as their ancestral\n\nterritory and have feared the creation of a \"greater Rwanda\" or :'Hutu-land\" in the region, and their leaders catled\n\nfor the camps to be closed and the refugees repatriated. Public comments by General Eluki, the chief of staff of the\n\nZairian army, auring an official VÎ$it in Goma in November, appeared to give official sanction for the\n\n\"autochthonous\" groups to take up arms once again. In a public setting and in the presence of journalists, General\n\nEluki stated that the Hunde, Nyanga, and Tembo were justified in fighting for the land of their ancestors and seeking\n\nto expel \"foreigners,\" which was interpreted by other groups in the region to mean all Banyarwanda, not simply the\n\nHutu refugees.41\n\nThe immediate spark that reignited the interethnic fighting in Masisi seems to have been conflict over local\n\nresources, particularly firewood, in the vicinity of several Rwandan refugee camps. Clashes in early December\n\nbetween Mai-Mai and Zairian army soldiers at Bikenge, Masisi town, and elsewhere intensified the level.of combat,\n\nand violence quickly spread throughout southem Masisi. Mai-Mai appear to have launched most of the initial attacks\n\nagainst Hutu, but Hutu Interahamwe groups quickly responded with attacks oftheir own on predominantly Hunde\n\nand Nyanga villages. Because of their vast numerical superiority and better arrnaments, the Hutu militia were quickly\n\nable to dominate. By the end ofDecember, Interahamwe attacks had driven thousands ofHunde, Tembo, Nyanga,\n\nand Tutsi out of parts of Masisi, particularly areas near the refugee camps.42\n\nIn the first months of 1996, fighting gradually spread into other parts ofMasisi and Rutshuru. Witnesses\n\nreport that the Hutu militia groups that have been involved in the attacks have contained a mixture ofRwandan and\n\nZairian Hutu. Nzamwitakuze, a young refugee from a cotlectivity catled Bahunde in southeastern Masisi, explains\n\nthat attacks began in his community in late 1995:\n\n39Hoogesteyn, \"Anned Rwanda .. / Reuters, Feburary 21, 1996.\n\n•\n\n0samantha Bolton, \"3,000 Tutsi under threat in Masisi-Zaire: Only im.mediate evacuation can save lives,\" Medecins Sans\n\nFrontieres, press release, May 22, 1996.\n\n•\n\n1\"Masisi ou la guerre ~ubliée,\" p. viii; UNHCR, \"Repatriation of Rwandàn Refugees.\"\n\n•\n\n2Marc Hoogsteyn, \"Forty killed in Zaire dispute on Rwandan refugees,\" Reuters, December 12, 1995; Commission justice\n\net paix, \"Masisi: Zone devastée,\" pp. 12-13.\n\nHuman Rights Watch/Africa and FIDH 13 July 1996, Vol. 8, No. 2 (A)\n\nWhen the Interaharnwe came to attack, they took everything.

Our neighbors were attacked, and our own cows were\n\npillaged, so we fled in fear. We fled to the church at Matanda.43\n\nDespite being outnumbered and out-gunned by the Interahamwe, Mai-Mai a.nd Bangirima groups have\n\ncontinued not only to defend their communities but to launch attacks against Hutu and Tutsi in Masisi and Rutshu~\n\nforcing bath groups to flee certain areas. Comments by the govemor and other political and military officiais made\n\nthe militia believe that they have the support of higlier authorities in their struggle.\n\nBeyond the practical fear of losing political power, the. Mai-Mai and Bangirima militia have been inspired\n\nto continue their struggle by a strong sense of moral purpose. For many Hunde and Nyanga, the war is a noble\n\nstruggle to defend their ancestral lands and historical prerogatives against people thëy view as foreign interlopers.\n\nThe conflict in Masisi and Rutshuru bas expanded beyond guerrilla-style raids on villages, in which people\n\nare killed, women raped, and goods stolen. ln recent months, open combat between Mai-Mai and lnterahamwe bas\n\nbroken out as the groups struggle for control of territory, with Tutsi, who have sought refuge in towns that have\n\nbecome predominantly Hunde, targeted for killit}g by Interaharnwe.
